A study of the solidification curves of several binary systems of fluorides
gave the following results; AlF3 gives definite compounds, A1F3 . 3MF, in
which M = Li, Na, X, Rb, Cs. With Na, K and Rb it also forms compounds,
2 AlF,+ 3 MF existing in 2 modifications, and separated by a particular tem-
peratire. For Na this temperature is 6000, for X 3009, for Rb 350°. fThe
systems NaF-FPbF,, and NaF-CdF, are represented by 2 very slightly concave
(toward the X-axis) curves intersecting at the eutectic point. No solid
solutions were observed in the systems investigated.

CA 7, 2904). The system NajAlFg (m.p. 999°) - Als0; was followed up to
50 mol. % Al505; mixed crystals were formed on the NazAlFg side conteining
20% A1203 and The eutectic was at 973-8° and 32-3% A1203. The results for
the system Na,AlFg-NaF agree with those of Fedotiev and Ilyinskii, with
the exception”that the eutectic was found to be at 886° and 23% NajAlFg, and

Investigations on the Temperature-Coefficients of the

VII. The Specific Surface-Energy of the Molten Halides
of the Alkali Metals.

F. M. Jaeger (Groningen)

Verslag Akad. Wetenschappen 23, 611-27 (191%4)

The surface tension of a number of molten salts of the alkall metals
was determined with the same app. which has been previously used for
other liquids (cf. CA 9, 738). The necessary measurements of the d. of
the various salts as a function of temperature required for the calcn. of
the molar surface-energy have not yet been completed and will be published
later. The variation with temperature of the specific surface-energy in
ergs/cm? (Xt) of all the salts may be represented by the expression X =
a - b(t - tg) +c(t - t5)© in which tg is the m.p. and a, b and c are
constants. The values of tg, a, b, and ¢, resp., of the various salts
are as follows: LiF, 840, 255.2, 0.126, 0; Licl, 608, 1k0.2, 0.076, O;

From these results 1t is apparent that Xy as a function of t is very nearly
a straight line in all cases. The following conclusions are drawn from
the observations: (1) in the case of the four halides of the same alkali
metal the temperature coefficient b of X decreases continually with in-
creasing at. wt. of the halogen atom; (2) at the same temperature the value
of X for the same halide of all the alkalil metals decreases gradually

with increasing at. wt. of the alkali metal; at the same temperature X

for the four halides of the same alkali metal gradually decreases with in-
creasing at. wt. of the halogen atom. The relations, however, do not
possess a simple additive character. Finally, reasons are given for
believing that the liguid ILi salts possess a higher degree of molar com-
plexity than the salts of the other alkali metals........-

Thermal Analysis of Mixtures of Alkali Hydroxides
with the Corresponding Halides

I. Compounds of Potassium

Giuseppe Scarpa

Atti accad. Lincei 2L, 1, T738-46 (1915)

It has long been known that some metallic oxides can combine with
their respective halogen salts to form definite and stable compds. (called
hydroxyhalides). Considerable work has been done on these compds. in the
wet way but very little has been done at high temps. on the behavior of
the oxides with the halides. Ruer (Z. anorg. Chem. 49, 365(1906) studied
the system PbO-PbCl,, Sandonnini (Atti accad. Lincei 23, I, 959 (191k4)
studied PbO-PbBr, and PbO-PbF, and Truthe (CA 6, 2372) studied Cus0-CusCls.
The 1st pairs form well-defined hydroxyhalides while the last 2 show no
formation of compds. S. has extended these data and this paper is a re-
port on the K compds. The systems KOH-KF, KOH-KCl, KOH-KBr, KOH-KI were
investigated. The study of these systems i1s made difficult by the fact
that it is hard to find a container that is not attacked by KOH and by
the fact that KOH tends to absorb large amts. of moisture and CO, from
the air. The mixts. were placed in a Ag crucible (since this material is
little acted upon by fused KOH in the absence of 0 at moderate temps.);
this is placed in an Fe cylinder, covered with a porcelain cover and the
whole put in a resistance furnace in a current of Ho0- and COo-free N.

A Ag-Ni thermoelement made and calibrated in the lab was used to measure
the temps. since a Pt-~-PtRd couple is attacked. The Ag-Ni couple was
covered with a small Ag cylinder in making the solidification p. detns.

and the slight changes in the Ag and Ni were found to be without ap-
preciable effect on the e.m.f. For temps. above 900° (for KOH-KF mixts.
containing much KF) & Pt crucible and Pt-PtRh couple were used with success.
The KOH used was 89.53% KOH, 1.4T% KoCO3 and 9% Hp0; the latter was re-
moved by heating it 45 min. at 500° in the furnace in an atm. of N. The
m.p. of this KOH was 380° (Hevesy (CA 4, 2763) found 360° and Neuman and
T

Bergve (CA 8, 3533) found 345°) and the point of transformation was 260°
(Hevesy, 2480). The KF solidified at 857° (Plate (CA 2, 502) found 859.9°
and Karandezen (Centr. Min. Geol. 1909) found 867°). The solidification
ps. of all the mixts. of KCH and KF stand between those of the 2 compo-
nents which are completely miscible in the solid state and give mixed
crystals of 1 kind only. Thus the point of transformation of KOH that
results from the solidification p. curve gradually falls with the increase
of the concn. of KF. The KC1l used in the study of KOH-KCl m. 776°. 1In
this system the primary crystn. curve falls from the solidification p. of
KC1 to that of KOH and shows an elbow at 430° at 67 mol. % KOH. The mixts.
from 36 to 67 mol. % KOH show, besides the primary arrest, a secondary
arrest of crystn. at 430°; the mixts. from O to 25 and 47 to 100 mol. %
KOH show an interval of crystn. due to the formation of mixed crystals.
This system belongs to the 4th type of Roozeboom since it gives 2 kinds
of mixed crystals and a miscibility break. The point of transformation
of KOH is markedly lowered by KCl and at 82 mol. % KOH is 120°. The
point on the descending crystn. curve limiting the solid soln. of KC1l

in KOH could not be accurately detd. The KBr used in the system KOH-KBr
solidifies at T60°. The solidification diagram of this system shows that
the 2 components, if the formation of mixed crystals in the mixts. con-
taining only small amts. of KOH is disregarded, are completely miscible
in the liquid state. The eutectic arrest is at 300° with 75 mol. % KOH
and disappears at O and 85 mol. % KOH. The point of transformation of
KOH is rapidly lowered at first by the addition of KBr but becomes nearly
constant at 2050 with 90 mol. % KOH. The KI used in the system KOH-KI
solidifies at 695°. The primary crystn. curve descends from the m.ps. of
the 2 components and intersects at the eutectic at 250° at 73 mol. % KOH.
The point of transformation of KOH lies a little above the eutectic arrest.
The system KOH-KF gives solid solns. in all proportions; KOH with KC1l and
KBr gives solid solns. of 2 kinds with a miscibility break; KOH and KI
gives a simple eutectic.

II. Compounds of Sodium, Ibid. 955-61

In continuing the expts. described above the systems NaOH-NaF, NaOH-NaCl,
NaQOH-NeBr and NaOH-Nal were studied. The methods and technic were the
same. The NaOH attacks Ag less than KOH and since it is stable at high
temps. higher temps. could be used without any decompn. taking place.

The NaOH used was 97.46% NaOH, 1.64% Na oC03 and O. 9% HyO. The m. and
solidification points of NaOH are 3100 and 290° (Hevesy found 318.k4° to
299.5° and Neumenn and Bergve found the solidification p. to be 300°);
the m.p. of NaF was 1005©C. The system NaCH-NaF showed the formation of
mixed crystals with miscibility break, while KOH-KF gave 2 kinds of solid
solns. The primary curve of crystn. lies between the solidification ps.
of the 2 components and shows a slight break of 90 mol. % NaOH. For
mixts. from 20 to 90 mol. % NaOH there is a 2nd arrest at 360°. The pt.
of transformation of NaOH is somewhat lowered and forms, with the limit
of the solid soln. of NaF in NaOH, a eutectic which shows a max. at 80
mol. % NaOH and which disappears at 5 and 100 (?) mol. % NaOH. In mixts.
of 5 to 80 mol. % NaOH it was possible to det. the duration of the eu-
tectic arrest, but from 80 to 100 mol. % NaOH the arrest due to the trans-
formation was also present. The system NaOH-NaCl shows a diagram similar
to the preceding. The NaCl m. 8060. The primary crystn. curve shows

a break at 350° and 75 mol. % NaOH; from 10 to 75 mol. % NaOH there is

_a 2nd arrest at 360%. The pt. of transformation of NaOH is rapidly
lowered by small amts. of NaCl with the solid soln. of NaCl in NaOH as the
1imit and the formation of an eutectic arrest which is at a max. at 73 mol.
4 NaOH and disappears at 5 and 100% NaOH.  The solidification p. of NaBr
is 776°. The system NaOH-NaBr shows complete miscibility in the liquid
state. The primary crystn. curve shows 2 branches which intersect at the
eutectic, 260° and 80 mol. % NaOH. There is not even a slight tendency

to form solid solns. The Nal m..665°. The system NaOH-NaI gives a de-
composable compd.” From the solidification p. of Nal the primary crystn.
curve descends regularly to 65 mol. % NaOH where there is a distinct
break; then it descends further and intersects the descending solidification
p. curve from the solidification p. of NaOH in a eutectic at 220° and 83
mol. % NaOH. In the mixts. up to 65 mol. % NaOH there is a 2nd arrest

in the solidification p. curve at 300° which has a max. duration at 40 mol.
% NeOH. This arrest coincides with the formation of a compd. decomposable
on melting; 2 NaOH+ 3 Nal is probably its formula. The pt. of trans-
formation of NeOH in a mixt. containing 3 mol. % NaIl is practically the
same as that of pure NaOH. Thus the systems NaOH-NaF and NaQOH-NaCl give
s0lid solns. of 2 kinds with a miscibility break; NaOH-NaBr gives a

simple eutectic; NaOH-NaI gives a compd. decomposable at fusion (probably
2 NaQH - NaI).

Thermal Analysis of the Mixture of the Alkali
Hydroxides with the Corresponding Halides III.
Compounds of Lithium

Giuseppe Scarpsa

Atti accad. Lincei 24, IT, 476-82(1915)

In 2 preceding papers (CA 9, 2828) the behavior of KOH and NaOH with
the K and Na halides was described; it was found that the tendency to
give compds. increases from K to Na. S. has now extended these expts.
to Li to see if with its smaller electroaffinity compared with Na there
is a further increase in this tendency. The same methods and app. were
used a8 before. The LiOH used contained 98.5% LiOH, 0.5% LiC03 and
0.T% H»O. The Li salts were dehydrated in a Pt crucible. The m.p. of
LiOH was found to be 462° (DeForcrand, Compt. rend. 142, 1255(1906) found
4450); that of LiF is 840C. The system LiOH-LiF shows complete misci-
bility in the liquid state and gives solid solns. in limited proportions.
The primary crystn. curve drcps from that of LiF to a eutectic at 4300
at 80% LiCH and rises to the f.p. of LiOH. The freezing curve shows the
eutectic arrest from 5 to 85 mol. % LiOH. LiCl m. 605°. The primary
crystn. curve of the system LiOH-LiCl drops from the f.p. of LiCl to a
eutectic at about 290°, showing a break at 50 mol. % LiOH and then
rising to the m.p. of Li0OH. The eutectic arrest for mixts. of 45-100
mol. % L1OH lies at about 285° and shows a max. duration at about 65 mol.
% LiOH. Mixts. from O to 50 mol. % LiOH show another arrest at 315°
which has a max. duration at 40 mol. % LiOH. This arrest corresponds
to the formation of a compd. decompg. on fusion, which is probably 2
LiOH-3 Licl, wiBr m. 550°. The diagram of the system LiOH-LiBr is
similar to .hat of LiOH-LiCl. The eutectic lies at 275° with 45 mol. %
LiOH. Mixts. of O to 70 mol. % LiOH show & eutectic arrest which disappears
between 75 and 100 mol. %; at the latter compns. there is an arrest at 310°
which is max. at 75 mol. % and corresponds to the decomposable compd.

3 LiOH- LiBr. LiI m. 440°. The primary crystn. curve of the system LiOH-
LiI drops from the m.p. of LiOH to the eutectic 180° at 45 mol. % LiOH

and shows a strong break at 75 mol. % LiOH and then rises to a temp. of

310° at 80 mol. %, which must be due to the formation of a compd. not

stable at the m.p.; it must be 4 LiOH. LiI. The results show that the
tendency to give compds. between the alkali hydroxides and the halogen salts
of the same metal increases graduslly on passing from K to Na to Li or

with diminishing electroaffinity of the ion. This agrees with the theory
of Abegg and Bodlander (Z. anorg. chem. 20, 453(1903)) on electroaffinity
and formetion of complexes. The results of the 3 papers are summarized
thus:

The methods used for the determination of density are described.
The d. of liquids was determined with s pycnometer, or, in the case of
compounds, such as the low-boiling aliphatic amines, which absorb CO2
and HoO with avidity, with a volumeter. With inorgenic salts of high
melting point the d. was determined by the hydrostatic method, using a
float of Pt, suspended by a fine Pt wire from the pan of an analytical
balance. Following are the results for the compounds whose sp. surface
energy vas given in CA 9, 2024; first the temperature range used is
given, then the empirical formula expressing the d. as a function of the
temperature, then the value ofSH/St in ergs per degree; when only one

Sardonnini (Gazz. chim. ital. 41, 377 (191L4); cf. CA 7, 3284) studied
the system LiCl and MgCl, and found that it gave a continuous series of
mixed crystals. T. examined the system LiF-MgF,. 30 g. of mixts. of the
pure salts were fused in a Pt crucible by means of a small Pt-resistance
elec. furnace. The results are given in a table and a dlagram. The temp.

on cooling was followed to 300° but showed no eutectic arrest in any of
the mixte. The curve for the beginning of crystn. falls from 840°, the
m.p. of LiF, to a min. of 670° at 68.2 mol. % MgF,, rises slightly to 690°
at 78.99 mol. % MgF, and then rises sharply to lOgO0 at 88.5 mol. % MgFo.

The app. was not suited for observing the m.ps. of higher mixts. of MgF,,
which is estd. to be about 1400° (Beck, CA 4, 279). The form of the
diagram and the lack of a eutectic in all mixts. lead T. to conclude that
mixed crystaels are formed in all ratios. Owing to the fact that the
components have different cryst. forms it is believed that the mixed
crystals are decomposed but thermal evidence of this decomposition could
not be obtained.

The results of X-ray analysis confirm the conclusion reached from
those of thermal analysis (c¢f. Tacchini, CA 19, 1368) that Li and Mg
fluorides form solid solutions, the mixed crystals undergoing decompo-
sition at a low temperature. At the ordinary temperatures, solid solutions
of the LiF type contg. up to 20% MgFo may be prepd. The replacement of
a certain No. of MgF, mols. by a corresponding No. of double LiF mols.
causes neither appreciable change in the LiF space lattice nor the ap-
pearance of new lines in the corresponding X-ray photograms, but, Jjust as
in other similar cases, the formation of the mixed crystals is accom-
panied by a slight increase in the volume of the elementary cell.

The fusibility of the system LiF-MgF, was determined by mixing given
weights of the previcusly dried salts, melting in & Pt-Ir crucible, and
obtaining the cooling curve by means of a Pt-Pt-Rh couple by taking read-
ings every 15 sec., the rate of cooling being 20° per min. Pure LiF m.
837°, pure MgFo, 1225°. The eutectic mixt. contains 53% MgF, and m. 718°.
Between O and 53% MgF, there is no eutectic, showing that LiF gives con-
tinuous solid solutions with MgF,. At 90% MgF, there is another eutectic
point, showing that there are no solid solutions along this branch of the
curve. The solidified mixtures with high LiF contents are white and have
a porcelain-like structure. Cryst. structure appears with increase in MgF,,
and with 85-90% on cooling the crucible is filled with MgF, needles. All
the mistures contract on cooling. The fused eutectic readily dissolved

place, which is greater for the alkali hydrides than for the alk. earth

Fluorescence and Solid Solution
Mabel K. Slattery
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. l&, TT77-82 (1928)

NaF and LiF, activated to fluorescence by the addn. of small amts. of
U, show no difference in crystal structure from the pure salts. This may
be due to replacement of ILi or Na by U in the lattice at random points,
no distortion being expected since U has a quite small atomic radius.
Mixts. of LiF and NaF (5% to 50% LiF) and & small and uniform amt. of U
were fused. The fluorescent lines show a shift from the positions found
in the pure fluorophors, but this shift is the same for all mixts., the
increase in intensity of the LiF lines being the only change in going
from the 5% to the 50% LiF mixt. Also the amt. of shift of the NaF x-ray
diffraction lines is the same for all mixts. It thus appears that some
L1 had entered the NaF lattice but the remainder had crystallized
separately. It finally appears that an increase in crystal dimensions
causes an increase in wave-length of the fluorescent emission.

The electrolysis of melts of fluorides requires heat- and corrosion-
resisting materials. In a melt of MgF, at 950°, Fe was the least and Ni
the most resisting, with Cr in between; after 6 hrs. Fe showed an av. loss
of 10.3%, Cr 9.3%, and Ni a very slight increase in wt. due very likely
to a thin film formed on the surface. Cr-C steels show at first with
increasing C content a deterioration; with higher C content near the
eutectic point an improvement takes place. Ni steels show with increasing
Ni content an increase in corrosion resistance. Si has a slight improving
influence. Cr and Ni increase the resistance considerably. Addn. of Al,
Mo or Cu seems also to have a favorable effect. Replacement of Ki by Co
leads to strong corrosion. In general, under the influence of molten
MgF>, pure Ni is the most resistant, highly alloyed Cr-Ni steels are a
close second, while the typical heat-resisting C-Si steels are compara-
tively strongly attacked. The actual loss in material for all tests is
tabulated.

action effect equal to 11.6 kg.-cal. the equil. is shifted toward the side

ing a simple eutectic system, the square of the system (obtained by
projecting the crystn. surface on the prism base, representing the prop-

Determination of Crystal Densities by the Temperature -

Lithium Fluoride

Clyde A. Hutchison and Herrick L. Johnston

 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 62, 3165-8 (1940)

A method is described for detg. the ds. of crystals to the fifth
decimal place, which is a combination of "temp. flotation" of small
crystals with calibration of the flotation liquid by hydrostatic weighings.
By this means the d. of LiF was found to be dss = 2.63905 £ 0.0001. This
value of the d. was used to compute the lattice const. of LiF. With the
at. wt. of F taken to be 19.00 and Avogadro's No. taken as 6.064 x 10°3,
this yields aps = 4.01736 * 0.00004A. However, an addnl. uncertainty
that may be as " high as 0.00050A. is involved because of an uncertainty of
0.01 unit in the at. wt. of F. Corrected to a wave-length scale which
also uses N = 6.06k x 1023 and takes the d. of NaCl (20°) as 2.1638,
recent x-ray measurements of Straumanis (cf. CA 32, 412L4-8) yield ayg =
4.01732 + 0.00004A. in complete agreement with the above figure. An
addnl. uncertainty of at least 0.00020A. is involved because of a min.
uncertainty of 0.0002 unit in the d. of NaCl. The possible future util-
ity of a combination of d. and x-ray measurements on LiF in providing a
standard of wave-length measurements, in detg. the precise value of
Avogadro's No. or in comparing the at. wt. of F with that of Cl is in-
dicated.

crease linearly with drop in temp., whereas their mol. vols. as a function
of the compn. at 1000° and 1100° deviate slightly from the law of addi-
tivity. The mol. vols. v, at any temp. can be expressed by: vy = 136-36.5a

The lattice spectrum, sp. heat, and thermal expansion of LiF and
NaF are calcd. by methods based on Raman dynamics of crystal vibrations.
The mutual repulsion of the nearest F ions is considered in addn. to
those existing between the neighboring ions Li and F for the calcn. on

By means of x-ray and thermal analysis of the system NaF-BeF, the
following double salts were established: NapBeF) which melts congruently
at 6159, whereas at 220 and 330° its polymorphic transformations occur;
NaBeF, which melts with decompn. at 360-70°; NaF - 2 BeF, which decomposes
at 2880 without melting. BeFs, prepd. from (NHu)g BeF), by distn. of NH)F,
suffers polymorphic changes at 4259 and 528° and softens at 600°, with
occurrence of transparency at 780°. Molten BeF,, on cooling, solidifies
to a glass without formation of any of its cryst. forms. On solidification
of melts of BeF, with NaF the former seps. in a cryst. form. An analogy
was detected between the x-ray data of this form of BeF, and that of o-
quartz; this material has the following const. with hexagonal cell

Anomalous Behavior of Fused Cryolite
T. R. Scott (Council Sci. and Ind. Research, Melbourne, Australia)
Nature 157, 480-1 (1946)

Natural cryolite (Na;AlFg) fused in Pt gives a "wetting" melt that
may creep over the edge of the crucible. The addn. of 0.02% Pb or Bi
and comparable amts. of Tl makes the melt nonwetting. Tl is volatile,
and its effect is temporary. The addn. of 5% of other compds. does not
interfere with the effect of Pb or Bi. With K3A1F6, 5% Pb or 0,25% Bi
is required to mske the melt nonwetting. Melts of synthetic cryolite
prepd. in Pb vessels are nonwetting; prepd. in rubber or Pt, are wetting.
Melts of NapSOl, NaF, NasWO), and KoS0) are affected like cryolite;
melts of NaCl and NaPO; are not. PbF, forms a wetting melt in Pt which
becomes nonwetting on %he addn. of twice its wt. of cryolite. No
theoretical explanation if given.

The KF-NaF-MgF, system studied is one of the L triple systems
forming the faces of the compn. tetrahedron of a quadruple system of
Li, X, Na, and Mg fluorides, which is being investigated primarily to
find fluoride fluxes for the refining of nonferrous metals and their
alloys. The compds. in the KF-NaF-MgF, system det. the nature of the
quadruple system as & whole, as the fourth component, ILiF, does not
form any addnl. compds. and serves only as & solvent. The method used
33

was the visual-polythermal method, where the temps. at which the first
crystals appear and the last disappear are detd. by means of a Pt/Pt-Rh
thermocouple. The formation of 3 compds.-2 KF . MgF,, KF - MgF,, and NaF-

In continuation of investigations of the fluorite lattice (cf. CA

were studied conductometrically. Pure SrF, and LaF,; were prepd. by

repeated pulverization and heating, at 1100° of mixts. of SrF, and LaF
until x-ray examn. showed that equil. was reached. Roentgenographic ana
d. data on the mixts. are tabulated. The technique of making the cond.
measurements is described in detail, and the results obtained at various

principles developed in the previous part, it was possible to calc. on a

Double Fluorides of Potassium or Sodium with
Uranium, Thorium, or Lanthanum

W. H. Zachariasen (Univ. of Chicago)

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 70, 2147-51 (1948)

Many double fluorides were found in the system KF-UF), KF-ThF), KF-
LaF3, NaF-UF),, NaF-ThF) and NaF-LaFq by the x-ray diffraction method.
The observed diffraction intensities can with good approximation be
attributed to the heavy atoms since the scattering powers of K, Na, and
F are small compared to those of U, Th, and La. Since g small number
of degrees of freedom is involved, the number and positions of the
heavy atoms within the unit cell can be detd. from the intensity meas-
urements. The vol. of the unit cell, V, and the number of heavy atoms
within it, Ny, are thus accurately known exptl. quantities. The vol.
of the unit cell for fluorides of the heavy elements under considera-
tion can with good approximation be attributed to the F atoms alone,
with the heavy-metal atoms fitting the interstices between the anions.
The vol. requirement of a ¥ atom may be set at Vp = 18A.3; exptl. values
are for UFg 18.1, UF), 19.4 UgFg 16.9, «-UFg5 19.0, S-UF5 17.0, UFg 19.3,
LaF3 18.2. 7 The mean values for the vol. requiremeuv of a K or a Na
atom obtained from a number of known crystal structures are Vi = 214.3
and Vy, = TA.3. V = NyV, + NgVp, where N, and Ny are, resp., the
number of alkali atoms and of F atoms per unit cell, and V, is the vol.
requirement of an alkali atom. N,, Ny, and Np are not independent,
since the valences must be balanced. Thus N, and can be detd. in
terms of the experimentally known V, Vg, Vas and . In the systems
AF-XFYy, Ny = (V-UNxVp)/Vy + Vp) and Np = (V + UNgVy) /vy + V)5 in the
systems AF-XF3, Ny = (V-3NxVp)/(Vp + Vp) and Ny = (V + 3NgV,)/(Vy + Vg).

other. The product is a mixt. of the 2 known forms of PbF,, cubic and
orthorhombic. The proportion of the cubic form is the higher the slower
the reaction. With very dil. solns., almost pure cubic (octahedral) FbFo
was obtained. Replacement of Pb(NOz), by Pb(OAc), favors the cubic form.
Interdiffusion of concd. solns. yieids almost pure rhombic PbF,. By
goniometric detns., the latter belong to the class of rhombic dipyramids.
The rhombic form goes over monotropically into the cubic form. The
transition point was redetd., by X-ray and microscopic examn., to 3159,
considered more accurate than previous detns. (400, 200, or 280°). The
d. of the cubic and rhombic forms are detd. to 7.750 and 8.445 resp.

The cubic form can be obtained and maintained at lower temps., altho it

Comparison of the Catalytic Activities of Some

(Free Hydroxyl Radicals)

Mikko Tamura and ShoJji Shida

Rev. Phys. Chem. Japan, Shinkichi Horiba Commem. Vol. 1946, 115-20

The negative catalytic effect of some solid salts on the combustion
of H, and some org. compds. may be caused by the recombination of H atoms
and OH radicals on the solid surfaces. To test this theory, water vapor
was passed thru a Wood's discharge tube, past a thermometer coated with
the solid salt, thru a trap cooled with solid CO, and alc., and finally
was pumped out by a vacuum diffusion pump and sn 0il pump. The rise in
temp. was measured for KF, KCl, KBr, KI, KCl, NaCl, RbCl, LiCl, NaF, LiF,
LipCO3, NaoSOy, NapCO3, NaNO3, KpSO), NHLCI, KNO% MeClo, Ca(NOa)g, CaFo,
Pt, KQCO3, and glass. The order of catalytic activity decreased in the
order Rb, K, Na, Li for carbonates, halides, and nitrates and in the order
metal, carbonates, nitrates, halides for K and Na salts. The fluorides
and sulfates of K and Na are inactive. In general, the more pos. the
cation and the less neg. the anion, the more active the salt. For the
alkali halides, the smaller the lattice energy, the greater the catalytic
activity.

UFg was vaporized in a heavy-wall, Ni-plated calorimeter. The heat
of vaporization of the solid was measured at 7 temps. and of the liquid at
L temps. covering the range from 4O to 90°. The app. was tested before
beginning the measurements by obtaining the heats of vaporization of water

heats of vaporization were used to obtain a consistent correlation of the
vapor pressures, heat of fusion, and triple point given in the literature.
The results are expressed as vapor pressure equations and an equation of
state for the satd. vapor. From these equations and the National Bureau
of Standards values for the thermodynamic properties of the solid and
liquid, the entropies of the ideal gas are calcd. and compared with those
given in the literature from spectroscopic data and mol. structure. The

Ultraviolet Absorption Spectra of Rubidium and

Nature 164, 753-4 (1949)

To det. the dissocn. energy, D. of mol. fluorine, the absorption
spectra of RbF and CsF were measured in the quartz ultraviolet. At
about 900° for RbF and T50° for CsF, continuous absorption is detectable,
with max. absorption at 2150A. for RbF and at 2100 for CsF. As the
temp. 1s raised, diffuse bands appear at longer wave lengths. Some
30 for RbF to 2980 and 25 for CsF to 2710 have been measured. From
these Dig - (RbF) and Dyg (CsF) were detd.; coupled with the heats of
formation, Q(MF), the latent heat of vaporization, L,g (MF), they give
a value of D(F,) of 50 % 6 kcal., which is incompatible with one of
40 + 3 kcal. as detd. from C1F. Further work is necessary to bring
these values more into line but it appears certain that the bond strength
of mol. fluorine is considerably less than that of mol. chlorine.

Tmproved Crystallization of Lithium Fluoride

of Optical Quality

Donald C. Stockbarger (MIT, Cambridge)
Discussions Faraday Society 1949, No. 5, 299-306

Pure LiF is prepared by bubbling CO, through saturated ag. LisCO
solution at room temperature and mixing the LiHCO4 which is formed wi%h
HF solution. The LiHCOg3 is added to the HF slowly with agitation, and
the addition is stopped while acid is still present in excess. LiF
crystals are prepared by lowering the melt, which is contained in a Pt
41

crucible, through a temperature gradient in an air furnace. The major
difficulties are the control of the temperature and line voltage, the
avoidance of reaction with water vapor, and the avoidance of color in the
resulting crystals. Superior crystals can be grown at greater expense

in a vacuum furnace. These crystals have much better transmission char-
acteristics in the ultraviolet and infrared than crystals grown in air.

A Theory cf Dielectric Polarization in

Shepard Roberts (G. Elec. Co., Schenectady, N. Y.)
Phys. Rev., T7, 258-63 (1950); cf. CA 4k, 392 4

A theory of dielec. polarization is described in which each ion in
an alkali halide crystal is considered as a sep. entity capable of being
distorted internally by an elec. field. Three stiffness coeffs. suffice
to describe the interaction between the local elec. field and the polariz-
able ion. The Lorentz internal field is valid for this calcn. Optical
and dielec. polarizabilities per mol. and infrared absorption frequencies
in alkali halide crystals calcd. by this method are in substantial agree-
ment with exptl. Electronic polarizabilities of free (gaseous) ions are
also calcd., and a novel "pseudo-piezoelec."” effect is predicted.

Alkali Al fluorides, particularly cryolite, are made by dissolving
fluorspar in alkali, adding alkali aluminate and pptg. with COp, the
quantity of COp, is limited so that some free alkali remains in soln.,
and this is then used for prepg. fresh alkali aluminate by leaching
sintered or smelted Ca aluminate. The soln. may be used alternately
for extg. the alkali-fluorspar sinter and the Ca aluminate, and when
its alkalil content has increased sufficiently (e.g., to 150 g/1) the
excess alkali is pptd. with COo as bicarbonate and heated to convert
the bicarbonate to carbonate, which is then returned to the process.

expression for the difference in pressure between the 2 sides of a curved

Aluminum Fluoride Hydrates

Z. anorg. Chem. 262, 54-60 (1950)

Detailed descriptions are given for the prepn. of hydrated AlF
by solution of (a) Al(OH)3,_ (b) ignited Al,03 (600°) and (c) Al metdl
in ag. HF. The first two starting materials lead to basic salts, which
are not in chem. equil. with the soln. These solns. may contaln a
peptized colloid that causes the compn. of the resulting fluoride to
depend upon the previous history of the material. Neutral Al¥F, hydrates
(mono - and tri-) are obtained from solns. of Al metal dissolveéd in
aq. HF. The monohydrate is obtained by long drying on a steam bath;
the trihydrate is obtained by exposure of the monohydrate to air satd.
with water vapor, followed by drying over concd. HoSOy. Debye X-ray
diffraction photographs support the claims for the mono- and tri-
hydrates, but cast doubt upon the existence of a 3.5 hydrate.

Solubilities of Salts in Water at High Temperature
Harold Simmons Booth and Richard MacPherson Bldwell
(Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, O.)

J. Am. Chem. Scc. T2, 2567-75 (1950)

A technique for the measurement of solubilities at high temps. and
pressures was developed, in which filtration of the satd. soln. is
effected by quenching the high-pressure vessel. The solubilities of
CaF,, BaF,, and LiF and SrSQ), were measured up to, or past, the crit.
temp. of water. The previously investigated solubilities of -CasSQ) and
Nao,50)y at high temps. were checked and extended. The dependence of
the soly. of LiF in water above its crit. point on the d. of the solvent
was measured at several temps. The very low solubilities of the salts
investigated in the region of the crit. point made it seem unlikely that
the recrystn. from their pure aq. solns. of these salts would be a
practical method for the making of synthetic crystals of optical quality
unless at appreciably higher temps. and pressures. The precision of
the results obtained compared well with other measurements in the same
region, most of which required far more complex app.

The system was studied at 25° and at 75° by the thermostatic method
of detg. solubilities and by investigating the elec. cond. There are 5
regions where the stable solid phases are: (1) AlF, - 3 Ho0; (2) solid
solutions of A1F3 - 3 HpO in chiolite, which latter compd. appears to
have the formula 3 NaF - 2 A1F3, corresponding to the compd. found in the
binary system NaF-AlF», rather than 5 NaF - 2 AlF,, corresponding to the
naturally-occurring mineral; (3) chiolite; (4) solid solutions of chiolite
in NeF, with no indication of the compd. 11 NaF - 4 A1F3 previously reported
(CA 38, 3542-1), but having an upper limit of soly. corresponding to a
Na/Al ratio of 2.7 - 2.8; (5) NaF (not investigated). Binary fluorides of
Na and Al dissolve in water with decompn. and, consequently, R NaF - AlF
was not found. The compd. NaAlFj, was not isolated, but it is possible
that it is formed as a monohydrate in concentrated solutions of A1F3.

All form simple eutectics except the system CaFo-CaClo, where there is a
peritectic point in addition to the eutectic. The reciprocal system has
6 crystn. regions where the solid phases are, respectively, LiF, CaFo . CaClp,
CaCl,, and®and & - LiCl. There are 3 eutectic points, lying on a slightly
curved line, having values of temperature (©C), equiv. % Ca, and equiv.

Irreversible-reciprocal System of Fluorides and Iodides

of Scdium and Potassium, of the Transition-to-singular Type
F. P. Platonov

Trudy Moskov. Sel'sko-Khoz. Akad. im. K.A. Timiryazeva
1946, No. 36, 42-56

The L 1ateral binary systems, and 2 diagonal binary systems, and 6
quaternary cross-sections were investigated to characterize the reciprocal
 

23

system. The system NaI-NaF is a simple eutectic system, the m. p. decreasing
from 667° for Nal to a eutectic m. 603°, contg. 18 (mole)% NaF, then rising
to 990o for Nal'. The KF-KI system is of the same type, the m.p. decreasing
from 850° for KF to a eutectic m. 5449, contg. 34% KF, then rising to 680°
for KI. Nal and KI form a continuous series of solid solutions, with m.p.

of mixtures going through a min. of 5830 at 42% KI. KF and NaF form a
simple eutectic m. T10°, contg. 40% NeF, and there is a limited range of
solid solutions, with KF dissolving in NaF to the extent of approximately

4%, and NaF in KF about 10%. The steble diagonal cross-section NaF-KI forms
a simple eutectic, m. 631°, contg. 12% NaF. This is a stable system, since
the solid phases are the pure components NaF and KI, and none of the prod-
ucts of their reaction appears in the diagream. The metastable diagonal cross-
section KF-Nal has 3 crystn. regions: a Nal region from Nal down to a
eutectic m. 5789, contg. 12% KF; a KF region from KF down to a eutectic m.
678°, contg. 78% KF, and a central region characterized by a maximum at 8400,
50% KF, and corresponding to the reaction product NaF. In this central
region, below the liquidus curve there are other metastable equil. with the
result that the curve showing the temperature of complete solidification
decreases from the eutectic at 678° to another eutectic-like point at about
540°, 60% KI, then goes through a maximum of 620° at 50% KI, decreasing to

a broad min. of 560° at 30% KI, and rises gradually to the eutectic at 5789,
From these data and those of the quaternary cross=-sections, a 3-dimensional
model was constructed for the reciprocal system, and the conventional planar
representation by projection of the model on the compn. plane. The stable
diagonal NaF-KI divides the diagram into 2 ternary systems: (1) the NaF-KI-
KF system contg. 3 regions where the solid phases are NaF, KI, and KF, resp.,
and a ternary eutectic point at 5420 contg. 95.5% K, 64.5% I; (2) the system
NeF-KI-Nal contg. 2 crystn. regions where the solid phases are NaF and solid
solution of Nal in KI, with a min. in the copptn. curve at 560 . The entire
reciprocal system thus has 3 crystn. regions, where the solid phases are NaF,
KF, and solid solutions of Nal and KI. In the NaF region, which occupies
most of the diagram because of its smaller soly., the isotherms below T00°
intersect at very oblique angles, an indication of the irreversibility of the
system and of the fact that this irreversible-reciprocal system is of the
transition-to-singular type. A comparison of the system NaF-KCl, NaF-KBr,
and NaF-KI shows that increasing heats of reaction (7.6, 9.1, and 10.6 kecal.,
resp.) are assocd. with increasing areas of crystn. of the stable components
in the resp. systems in planar representstions (73.73, 77.85, and 82.54% of
the total area, resp.) and by increasing vols. of crystn. in 3-dimensional
models (82.79, 86.78, and 87.89%, resp.)

In every system the e.m.f. reaches a maximum at asbout 660°, while short-
circuit currents reach a maximum at slightly higher temperatures. Under stm.
pressure the maximum e.m.f. values of the systems lie within a narrow Zzone
(2.0 - 2.3 v.), but under reduced pressure the max. e.m.f. values are small
but differ from each other; I 1.68, IT 1.86, IIT 1.65, IV 1.59, VII 1.LO,

bly, the values for the systems IV, VII and II being 92, 21, and 2%, resp.,

BaClp, 9580, SrCls and BaCl, form solid solutions over the entire concn.

SrCly « SrFp m. 962°, and there are 2 eutectics: 753°, 13% SrFp; and 9620,
63% SrFo. The compd. undergoes a phase transition at 890°, intersecting the
liquids curve at 25.5% SrFpo. BaF2 and BaCly form a similar system: BaFp -
BaClp m. 1008°; eutectics at 854°, 19% BaF, and 936°, 73.5% BaFo; and tran-
sition point 940°, 30% BaF,. The system SrCly, - SrFp - BaClp . BaFj, is
characterized by solid solutions over the entire concn. range, with a min.
m.p. at 9060, 36% BaClp - BaFp. The diagonal binary system SrClp - BaFp.
has 4 crystn. regions where the solid phases are: (1) solid solutions of
SrCls in BaClp; (2) and (3) « - and P~ cryst. modifications of solid solutions
of SrCly, - SrF, in BaClp - BaFp; (4) solid solns. of SrFp in BaFp, causing
breaks in the liquidus curve at 730°, 3.5% BaFo; 862°, 15% BaFo; 9230, 62%
BaFo. The other diagonal system BaClo - SrFo also has 4 regions: (1) all 4
pure compds.; (2) and (3) - and f- cryst. modifications of solid solutions
of the two binary compds.; (L4) solid solutions of SrFs in BaFo, causing
breaks in the liquidus curve at 800°, 15.5% SrFo; 890°, 31.5% SrFo; 917°,

57% SrF,. On the basis of the binary diagrams and of i quaternary mixtures,
planar and 3-dimensional models were constructed for the reciprocal system.
The latter shows the crystn. surface to be composed of 4 parts. There is an
almost planar surface dropping down rather steeply from the SrF, - BaFp side
to a trough, where the solid phase is a series of solid solutions of SrF, in
BeFo. Next there is a saddle, in the central portion of the diagram, the
peaks of which correspond to the 2 binary compds., and the surface then drops
to another trough; in this region the solid phases are the « - and f-modifica-
tions of solid solutions of the 2 binary compds. Finally, there is an almost
planar surface up to the SrCl, - BaC12 side, where the solid phase is a series
of solid solutions of the chlorides. As a result of the relatively small

heat of reaction of 4.6 kcal., and because of the stable complex compds.
formed in this system, the important relationships are not along the diagonals
but are in sections divided by the line connecting the 2 binary compds.

The Electrolysis of Fused Salts I. Electromotive
Force Observed in the Salt-Metal Systems

Hiroski Nozaki

J. Electrochem. Soc. Japan 16, 31 - 3 (1948)

The emf observed in some metal-salt systems enclosed in a Pt crucible
under atmosphere or reduced pressures are: 1.65 v. at 6750 for Al-AlF
1.68 v. at 630° for Al-cryolite, and 1.67 v. at 7259 for Al-NaF. The ghort-
circuit current is 100 ma. in the lst system when an Al rod 25 mm. in length
and 20 mm. in diameter and a Pt crucible of 45 mm. depth and 40 mm. in dia-
meter are used. In the 2nd system the corresponding current is very small.
In the 3rd system metallic Na is produced at both electrodes.

IT. Consideration of the appearance of the electromotive force in the salt-
metal system and its relation to electrolysis, Ibid 33-6

The emf observed in the 1lst system above can be explained by the solu-
tion of & new Al compd. which is assumed to have a lower valence, e.g.,
Al,Fg + Als=6 AIF. The main parts of the emf. of the 2nd and the 3rd
systems are probably due to the same reaction in addition to exchange
reaction as Na3A1F6 + Ale==3 Na + AloFg and 2 NaF + Al+=— 3 Na + Na3A1.F6.
These conclusions are also supported by the unpublished thermodynamic calcns.
of N's collaborators. The results obtained from the Na cryolite and NaAlpFg
systems also coincide with the above explanation.

III. Electrolysis of aluminum and sodium fluorides. Ibid. 60-2

Current voltage curves in the electrolysis of fused salts were detd. at
gtout 1000° in a graphite crucible with the molten metal at the bottom as the
cathode and a Pt wire in the fused salt as the anode. The inside wall of the
crucible was covered completely with a MgO lining to prevent the wall from
acting as the cathode. In the system with the Al cathode and cryolite the
current was very small, increased rapidly from 1.63 v. approaching a comnst.
value, and again increased linearly from 5.5 v. It was concluded that the
lst discontinuity was due to the decompn. of the A1013 - m Al dissolved in
the fused salt as assumed above, while the 2nd was due to the decompn. of
cryolite. In the system NagAlFg + AlpFgE (mol. ratio 8:2) and NazAlFg + 6 NaF
56

(mol. ratio 7:3) the lst discontinuities were at 3.6-7 and 2.8 v, resp. In
the system of NaF with & Na cathode the lst discontinuity of the lst run was
not clear, probably because of the solution of the Na formed in NaF, while
the 2nd indicated the decompn. of NaF at about 4.0 v., corresponding to the
theoretical value of 4.2 v. In the 2nd run in the same system, a finite
current was cbserved at O v. from the existence of Na already formed in the
fused NaF.

A1F3) the lowest cond.; conds. of neutral baths and of those containing CaF2
are intermediate. Addition of Al,O, lowers the cond. of all baths, perhaps
because it raises their viscosity (Rlluminio 19, 133 (1950)). The data, pre-

the uncertainties inwAHz g are estimated to be * 10 and * 5 kcal/mole for
crystal and vapor, resp.  Values for the dihalides are less certain. The values
are used to discuss the relative stabilities; the cryst. monochalides are only
slightly less stable than the trihalides, but the cryst. dihalides are defi-
nitely less stable. Gaseous mono- and dihalides are both less stable than the

Alkali halide crystals bombarded within an electron microscope
show a generalized photographic effect. In macro-crystals (0.2-0.002
cm.) equil. F-center formation slowly reversible after bombardment
ceases, and stable entrapped metal colloids in the crystal lattice
were observed. Jonization pulses were noted only during bombardment.
In micro-crystals (10-0.01 i) electron-diffraction techniques showed
the presence of metal, oxide, or carbonate after bombsrdment of
halide. A postulated sequence of events under bombardment includes
ionization, capture of Cl- electron to produce C1°, migration of C1°
to exterior of crystal and disintegration of crystal from center out.

Electronic Structure of the F-Center in Alkali

Halide Crystals

Toshinosuke Muto

cf. C.A. 44, 87751 -

Two perturbation methods for solving the Schrodinger equation
for an electron captured in the F-center are suggested; the 1lst method,
which corresponds to the at. wave function approximation, is based
on the assumption that the potential due to the surrounding iomns in
the crystal lattice is approximated by the periodic static potential
due to perfect lattice (that part due to the missing neg. ion is sub-
tracted). The 2nd one, which corresponds to the mol.wave function
approximation, is based on the assumption that the potential is ap-
proximated by the sum of that due to the nearest ions and that due
to the other ioms.

Plato (CA 2, 502, 3019), and Gemsky (CA 8, 2536). The visual poly-
thermal method was used for the investigation. Two diagonal and 23
interior lines (of intersection) form the square liquidus diasgram of
the reciprocal system. The pure salts are represented at the corners
of the square. The most sharply defined, stable line of the system
is the KoCl,-BaFo line. The next in order of stability is the K,Clp~
BaF,-BaCl, line. The BaF, region occupies 50.12% of the field; next
is the BaF,*BaCl, region %28.13%). These two fields are characterized
on the space model by two sharply defined ridges (space folds). There
are U eutectics at 575° (BaFo, KoFs, KoClp), 616, 625, and 728°. The
last 3 contain no KoFo. The nonreversible, reciprocal system of the
diagonal type is characterized by the formation of the compd. BaF, ¢
BaCl,, which does not affect the direction and displacement of the
displacement reactions. This is also true of the chlorides, which

A Quantum-Mechanical Treatment of the Lithium
Fluoride Crystal

G. C. Benson and G. Wyllie (Bristol Univ., Engl.)
Proc. Phys. Soc. (London) 64A, 276-82 (1951)

A simplified quantum-mech. model for the LiF crystal is described.
The lattice parameter, cohesive energy, and compressiblity are calcd.
by use of 3 different choices of wave function for the F~ ion in the
crystal; these are (1) the Hartree wave functions for the free ion F~,
(2) wave functions orthogonalized to the ls-orbitals of the 6 nearest
neighbor Li ions, (3) functions similar to 2 but based on wave functions
for the free ion, that have been contracted to give agreement with the
- diamagnetism of F~. The results obtained in (1) are in fair agreement
with the empirical values. ILarge discrepancies are observed when the
more complete wave functions (2) are used; this indicates that the
Hartree wave functions for the free ion are too diffuse. Results of
(3), which agree well with expt., substantiate this interpretation.
It is assumed that the metal and halogen ions are arranged in the usual
cubic lattice array and that the structure is completely ionic. Purely
central forces act between ions, and the force between two ions that
are not nearest neighbors is considered to be the ordinary electro-
static term. Only uniform lattice deformations are allowed, and the
energy assocd. with the thermal vibration of the ions is not considered.
Repulsion between the closed shells of the halogen ions is probably
gignificant in most Li halides. An exam. of the ratios of the radii
of the various halogen ions to that of the Li% ion indicates that only
in the case of F is there some justification for neglecting this effect.
