CHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-

SALT BREEDER REACTORS

W. R. Grimes

ABSTRACT

% Results of the 15-year program of chemical research and develop-
2 ment for molten salt reactors are summarized in this document. These
. results indicate that 7LiF—Bng-UF)_L mixtures are feasible fuels for
thermal breeder reactors. ©Such mixtures show satisfactory phase be-
havior, they are compatible with Hastelloy N and moderator graphite,
and they appear to resist radiation and tolerate fission product ac-
cumulation. Mixtures of TLiF-BeFQ-ThFu similarly appear suitable as
blankets for such machines. Several possible secondary coolant mix-
tures are available; NaF-NaBF3 systems seem, at present, to be the

most likely possibility.

Gaps in the technology are presented along with the accomplish-
ments, and an attempt is made to define the information (and the
research and development program) needed before a Molten Salt Thermal
Breeder can be operated with confidence.

CHEMI CAL. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-

SALT BREEDER REACTORS

Use of molten fluorides as fuels, blankets, and coolants offers a.
promising and versatile route to thorium breeder reactors. Mixtures con-
taining fissile and/or fertile materials have been studied in consider-
able detail, and sﬂown to possess liquidus temperatures, phase stability,
and physical properties which are suitable for the purpose. These fluo-
ride mixtures éppear to be compatible with structural metals and with
graphite suitable for use in a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor; such compati-
bility seems assured under irradiation at MSBR conditions. Cheap, low-
melting fluoride coolants for MSBR have not yet been demonstrated but
promising leads are available; the relative simplicity of the coolant
problem lends assurance that a reasonable solution can be found.

A reference design for a 1000 MW(e) Molten Salt Breeder Reactor has
recently been,published.l The state of knowledge of molten salts as
materials for use in that reactor and in attractive alternatives or
improﬁements is described in some detail in the following pages. An at-
tempt is made to define thbse areaswwhereadditional knowledge is neces-
sary or fery_desirableand_té_estimaﬁé the effort_required'to obtain this

knowledge for a molten'saltfbreeder reactor and a breeder reactor experi-

‘ment.

SELECTION OF MSBR SALT MIXTURES®™”

General RéQﬁirEments for the Fluids

 

A molten salt'reaétor'makes the following stringént minimum demands

upon its fluid fuel. The fuel must consist of elements of low (and prefer-

 
 

 

 

ably very low) capture cross section for neutrons typical of the energy
spéctrum of the chosen design. The fuel must dissolve more than the
critical concentration of fissionable material at temperatures safely be-
low the temperature at which the fuel leaves the heat exchanger. The mix-
ture must be thermally stable and its vapor pressure must be low over the
qperatihg ﬁemperature range. The fuel mixture must possess heat transfer
and hydrodynemic properties adequate for its service as a heat-exchange
fluid. It must be relatively non-sggressive toward some otherwise suit-
able materisl--presumably & metal--of construction and_toward some . suit-
eble modérator material. The fuel must be stable toward reactor radia-

- tion, must be able to survive fission of the uranium--or other fissionable
material--and must tolerate fission product accumulation without serious
deterioration of its useful properties.

If such reactors are to produce econamical power we must add to this.
list the need for reactor temperatures sufficiéntly high to achieve
genuinely high quality steam, and we must provide a suitable link (a
secondary coolant) between the fuel circuit and the steam system. We
mustlalso be assured of a genuinely low fuel cycle cost; this presupposes
a cheap fuel and en effective turn-around of. the unburned fissionable
material or (more reasonably) an effective and economical decontamination
and reprocessing scheme for the fuel.

If the reactor is to be a breeder we must impose even more. stringent
limits on permissible parasitic neutron captures b& the reactor materials
and provide sufficient fertile matefial either in a breeder blankét or in

the fuel (or in both). If & blanket is used it must be separated from
 

 

the fuel by some material.of very low neutron cross section.

The demands imposed upon the coolant and blanket fluids differ in
obvious ways from those imposed upon the fuel system. Radiation intensity
will be considerably less in the blanket--and markedly less in the cool-
ant--than in the fuel. Efficiency of the blanket mixture as a heat trans-
fer agent may be felatively unimportant, but a high concentration of
fertile material is essential and an effective recovery of bred material
is likely to bervital.

Choice of Fﬁel and Blanket Composition
General Considerations

The compounds which are permissible major constituents of fuels or
blankets for thermal breeders are those tha# can be prepared from beryl-
ljum, bismuth, boron-11, carbon, deuterium, fluorine, lithium-T, nitro-
gen-15, oxygen, and the fissionable and fertile isotopes. As minor
constituents one can probably tolerate compounds containing the elements
listed in Table 1.

Of the known compounds containing useful concentrations of hydrogen

(or deuterium) only the hydroxides of the alkali metals, the saline hy-

‘drides of lithium and calcium, and certain interstitial hydrides (zir-

conium hydride, for example).shoﬁ adequate thermal stability in the 1000°F
to 1300°F temperature range. [Acid fluorides (NsHFp, for example] might
be'pérmissible'in IGW“conéentrations at lower temperatures.] The hy-

drides are veryzstrong:réQucing agents and are most unlikely to be useful

components of any uraniferous iiQuid'fuel-system. Alkali hydroxides dis-

solve extremely'small Quantitieé of uranium compounds at useful reactor

temperatures and are very corrosive to virtually all useful metals at

 
 

 

such temperatures. One concludes, therefore, that hydrogen-rich com-
pounds, which might provide self-moderation to molten fuels,-are-not use-
ful in practical fuel or blanket mixtures.

The non-metals carbon, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, and
oxygen each form only high melting and generally unsuitable binary com~
pounds with the metals of Table l. From these non-metals, however, a
wide variety of oxygenated anions are available. Nitrates, nitrites,
sulfates, and sulfites can be dismissed as lacking adequate thermal sta-
bility; silicates can be dismissed because of undesirably high viscosi~
ties. Phosphates, borates, and carbonates are not so easy to eliminate
without study, and phosphates have, in fact, received some attention.

The several problems of thermal stability, corrosion, solubility of urani-

un and thorium compounds, and, especially, radiation stability would seem

b

to make the use of any such compounds very doubtful. - L
When the oxygenated anions are eliminated only fluorides and

chlorides remain. Chlorides offer mixtures that are, in general, lower

melting than fluorides; in addition UCl3 is probably more stable than UF3

with respect to the analogous tetravalent compounds. For thermal reactors,

fluorides appear much more suitable for reasons which include (1) useful-

ness of the element without isotope separation, (2) better neutron

economy, (3) higher chemical stability, (l4) lower vapor pressure, and

(5) higher heat capacity per unit weight or volume. Fluoride mixtures

are, accordingly, preferred as fuel and blanket mixtures for thermal

reactors. The fluoride ion is capable of some moderation of neutrons ;

this moderation is insufficient for thermal reactors withrcores'of reason-— —

able size. An additional moderator material is, accordingly, required.

Choice of Active Material

Uranium Fluoride. -~ Uranium hexafluoride is a highly volatile com-

 

pound clearLy unsuited as a.componept of high-temperature liquids.'_UOQFg,
though relatively nonvolatile, is a strong oxidant which should prove
very difficult to contain. Fluérides of pentavalent uranium (UF5, U2F9,
etc.) are not thermally stable and should prbve prohibitively corrosive
if they could be stabilized in solution. |

Uranium tetrafluoride (UFh) is a relatively stable, non-volatile,
non-~-hygroscopic material, which is readily prepared in high purity. It
melts at 1035°C, but this freezing point is markedly depressed by several
useful diluent fluorides. Uranium.trifluoride (UF3) is stable, under
inert atmospheres, to temperatures above 1000°C, but it disproportionates

at higher temperatures by the reaction <
o
hUF3 S 3UF, + U

Uranium trifluoride is appreciably less stable in molten fluoride solu-

4,5

tions. It is tolerable in reactor fuels only insofar as the equilibri-

un activity of uranium metal is sufficiently low to avoid reaction with

2

the moderator graphite or alloying with the container metal. Apprecisable

concentrations of UF3 (see below) are tolerable in LiF—BeF2 mixtures such
as those used in MSRE and proposed for MSBR. In general, however, urenium

tetrafluoride must be the major uraniferous compound in the fuel.

Thorium Fluoride. - All the normal compounds of thorium are quadri-

 

valent; ThF, (melting at 1115°C) must be used in any thorium-bearing
fluoride melt. Fortunately, the marked freezing point depression by use-

ful diluents noted ebove for uranium tetrafluoride applies also to thorium \
 

 

)

tetrafluoride.
Choice of Fluoride Diluents

The fuel systems for thermal reactors of the MSRE and MSBR types
require low concentrations (0.2 to 1 mole %) of uranium, and the proper-
ties (especially the melting temperature) of such fuels will be essential-
ly those of the diluent mixture. Blanket mixtures (and perhaps fuel
systems for one-region breeders) will require considerable concentrations
of high-melting ThFh. The fuels must, if they are to be compatible with
large steam turbines, be completely molten at 9T5°F (525°C).

Simple consideration of the nuclear properties leads one to prefer

T

as diluents the fluorides of Be, Bi, 'Li, Mg, Pb, Zr, Ca, Na, and Sn (in

that order). Equally simple considerations (Table 2) of the stability of
diluent fluorides toward reduction by common structural metals,6’7 how-
ever, serve to eliminate BiFB, PbF2, and probably SnFé from consideration.

No single fluoride can serve as a useful diluent for the active
fluorides. BeF2 is the only stable compound listed whose melting point
is close tqthe required level; this compound is too viscous for use in
the purerstate.

The:very sﬁable flubridés.éf the alkaline earths and of yftrium and

Oxide-Fluoride Equilibria

The phase behavior of pure fluoride systems is such that adequate
fuels and blankets seem assured, but the behavior of such systems is mark-
edly altered by appreciable concentrations of oxide. Since all commercial
fluoride prepafations conﬁain some oxide (and water which reacts with the
fluorides at high temperature to produce oxide) methods must be devised
to remove this contaminant to safe levels before use of the fluoride mix-
ture in the reactor. Avoiding contamination by oxide of the molten mix-
tures during reactor operation and maintenance was possible in principle
but, before the excellent operating experience with MSRE, was not at all
certain in practice. Accordingly, careful studies of oxide-fluoride equi-
libria in fluoride melts have been made to establish (1) the effect of
contaminant oxide on MSRE fuel, and (2) the ease of removal of oxide to
tolerable levels prior to reactor usage of the melts.

Measurements of reaction equilibria between water vapor in hydrogen

Because of limitations inherent in the transpiration method used, the
equilibrium quotients for these two reactions were less aécurately deter-
mined than was the previous one for Be(Q saturated melts (ca. i_;O%,
respectively, compared to *+ 5%). They were sufficient to show, however,
that both oxide and hydroxide increase in stability with increasing tem-
perature. The stability of hydroxide with respect to oxide, however,
decreases with increasing temperature. Hydroxide can, accordingly, be
readily decomposed in these fluoride melts by sparging with an inert gas
(e.g., hydrogen).

Fuel and Blanket Compositions

T

LiF, BeF Zth and UFh

- The fuel chosen for MSRE was a mixture of o
consisting of 65-29.1-5-0.9 mole %, respectively, of these materials. The
Zth we:: added, as indicated above, to eliminate the possibility of pre-
cipitation of UO2 through inadvertent contamination of the system with
reactive oxide. [The general precautions regarding cleanliness in MSRE
and the apparent success of the fuel preparation and handling procedures
for that‘operation_have gone far to remove apprehension from this source.
No samples removed from MSRE have contained more than 100 ppm of oxide,
" and no precipitated oxides have been observed on examination by optical
.microscopy,] Since chemical reprocessing techniques (probably distilla-
tion)‘will certainly be applied to the MSBR fuel system and since such a
reprocessing scheme can be éxpected to remove oxides, it seems very likely
tha£ Zth,need ﬁot be a constituent of MSBR fuel.

On the basis of information presented above the reference fuel select-
ed for use in the MSBR is a ternary mixture of TLiF-BeF2-233UFh (68.3-
7'31;5—0.2.mole %) (see-Fig. k) which exhibits a liquidus temperature of ap-
proximately‘h50°c., Equilibrium crystallization of this fuel mixture
proceeds according to the folloﬁing sequence: On cooling in the tempera-
ture interval 450 to h38°C,.éLiF-BeF2 is deposited from the fuel. At
438°C, the salt mixtﬁreSolidifiés éhd produces a mixture of the two
éfYStalline phaées, 2LiF-BeF2 and LiFfUFh, comprised of approximately 89
, and épproximétely 11 wt % LiF-UF) .

wt % 2LiF:BeF
" The blanket salt selected for the MSBR is the TLiF--BeFe—Th_Fh-ternary

mixture (71-2-2T7 mole %) (see Fig. 6), which exhibits a liquidus tempera-

ture of approximately 560°C. Equilibrium crystallization of this blanket

 
 

 

30

mixture is as uncomplicated as that of the fuel. Only the two solid
phases, LiF-ThFh and a solid solution of 3LiF-ThFh which incorporates Be2+
in both interstitial and substitutional sites, are formed during solidifi-
cation, and these solids are coprecipitated throughout the crystallization
of the salt.ll
Choice of Coolant

The secondary coolant is required to remove heat from the fuel in the
primary heat exchanger and to transport this heat to the power generating
system, Iﬁ the MSBR the coolant must transport heat to supércritical
steam st minimum temperatures only modestly above TOO°F; in MSRE the heat
was rejected to an air cooled radiastor at markedly higher temperatures.

The coolant must be possessed of adequate heat transfer properties
and must be compatible with Hastelloy N structures. It should not react
energetically with fuel or with steam, it should consist of materials
whose leskage into the fuel would not necessitate expensive separations
procedures, and it should be relatively inexpensive. To assure easy com-
patibility with the steam generation circuit the melting temperature of
the coolant should be below (and preferably considerably below) TOO®F.
Other demands (especially in the neutron economy and in radiation stabili-
ty areas) are clearly less stringent than those upon fuel and blanket
mixtures.

The coolant mixture chosen for MSRE and apparently shown to be satis-

T

factory in that application is BeF, with 66 mole % of 'LiF. Use of this

2
mixture would require some changes in design of equipment for the MSBR
since its liquidus temperature is 851°F; moreover, it is an expensive

material. The eutectic mixture of LiF with BeFs, (48 mole % LiF) melts at
 

‘duced and, accordingly, corrosive or chlorides [AlCl

31

near TOO°F (see Fig. 1) but it is both viscous and expensive. The alkali

- metals, excellent coolants with real promise in other systems, are un-

desirable here since they react vigorously with both fuel and steam. Less
noble metal coolants such as Pb° or Bi° might be tolerated, but they may

not prove compatible with Hastelloy N.
19

Several binary chloride systems are known ™~ to have eutectics melting

below (in some cases much below) TOO°F. These binary systems do not, how-
ever, appear especially attractive since they contain high concentrations

of chlorldes [T1cl, ZnCl BiCl CdClE, or SnClE], which are easily re-

2? 2°

3» ZrClh, HfClh, or
BeCIQ];Which'are very volatile. The only binary systems of stable, non-
volatile chlorides are those.containing LiCl; LiCl-CsCl (330°C at 45 mole
% CsCl), LiCl-Kcl (355°C at 42 mole % KCl), LiC1l-RbCl (312°C at 45 mole %
RbCl). Such systems wouldrbe relatively expensive if made from TLiCl, and
they could lead to sérious contamination of the fuel if normal LiCl were
used.

~ Very few‘fluorides or mixtures of fluorides are known to melt at tem-

peratures below 370°C. Stannous fluoride (SnF ) melts at 212°C. This

material is probably not stable durlng long term service in Hastelloy N;

moreover, its phase diagrams W1th stable fluorldes (such as NaF or KF)

| probably show high meltlng p01nts at relatlvely low alkali fluorlde concen-—

tratlons.

Coolant mlxtures of most . 1nterest at present are those based on
fluoborates of the alkall metals. The blnary system NaF-NaBFh is describ-
eat? 2 ‘as having a eutectlc (at 60 mole % NaBFh) meltlng at 580°F. Pre-

llmlnary unpublished studles at this Laboratory suggest strongly that this

 
 

 

 

 

32

published disgram is in error, and that the NaF—NaBFh.eutectic melts at
near T16°F. There is same evidence to suggésf that boric oxide sub-
stantially lowers the freezing point of NaF—NaBFh mixtures and we believe
that the Russian workers may have used quite impure materials. It is like-
ly,'howéver, that the material (pérhaps even with a moderate amount of
1_3203) may be useful. It should prove sufficiently stable to radiation

for service as coolant, and the equilibrium pressure due to

NaBFhl z BF3 + Nan

shoﬁld prove satisfactorily low. Estimates of the heat transfer.énd fluid
properties of this material appear attractive. The extraordinarily high
cross section of boron should permit small lesks in the heat exchanger to
be recognized immediately, and removal of traces of BF3 from the fuel by
continued treatment with HF should be possible. Compatiblity of the
NaF—NaBFh mixture with Hastelloy N will probably be satisfactory (see sub-
sequent sections), but such compatibility remains to be demonstrated.

If the NaF—NaBFh eutectic system proves unsuitable by virtue of its
freezing point, preliminary data (see Fig. 11) suggésts that freezing
points below TOO°F can be obtained in the ternary systemNaF-KF—BFB.

Should experience prove the NaF—NaBFh mixture (or its closerelatives)

unsuitable, coolant compositions which will meet the low liquidﬁs tempera~
8,19 or

9

ture specification may be chosen in the NaF—BeF2 .NaF-LiF—Ber,
KF—Zth—AlFSQ:L systems. These materials are almost certainly compatible
with Hastelloy N, and they possess adequate specific heats andrlow vapor
pressures (see section below). They (especially those including LiF) are

moderately expensive, and their viscosities at low temperature are certain-

CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY OF MSRE MATERTALS

Successful operation of the MSRE requires compatibility of the molten
fuel mixture with unclad graphite and Hastelloy N during years of rapid
circulation of the fuel through an sppreciable temperature gradient. Such
compatibility must, moreover, be assured while the fission process produces
its intense radiation field and the buildup of fission product species.

To evaluate these implied problems has required a large research and de-
velopment program in which many tests have‘been conducted over a period of
several years.

Details and specific findings of the large program of corrosion test-
ing are presented és e separate paper in this series.28 In brief, com-
patibility of the MSBR materials is assured by choosing as melt constitu-
ents only fluorides that are thermodynamically stable toward the moderator
graphite and toward thé structural metal, Hastelloy N, a nickel alloy con-
taining about 16% Mo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe. The fuel and blanket components

within tolerable"limits.  The chemical properties of the materials and the
nature of their several interactions, both with and without radiation and

fission, are described briefly in the following.

the equilibrium activity of U° which results is sufficiently low to avoid
reaction with the moderator graphite or appreciable alloy formation with

at 1000°K (T727°C) the activity of uranium in equilibrium with melts con-

4

taining various U*3/U* ratios leads to the data of Table 6. It is obvi-

ous that large quantities of UFh must be reduced if apprecisble uranium

UFh'were reduced to UF3;

These data reveal clearly that chromium is much more readily oxidized
than iron or nickel. Accordingly, any oxidative attack upon Hastelloy N
'should be expected to showzselective attack on the chromium. Such oxida-
tion and selective attack follows from reactions such as the following:

Reactions implied under (1) and. (2) ebove will proceed essentially-
to completion at all temperatuies within the MSBR circuit. Accordingly,
such reactions can lead (if the system is poorly cleaned) to a ﬁoticeable
rapid initial corrosion rate. thever, these reactions do not give a sus-
tained corrosive attack. | |

The feaction of‘UFh'with Cr, on the other hand, has en equilibrium
constant with a small temperature dependence; hence, when the salt is
forced to circulate through e tempereture gfadient, & possible mechanism
exists for mass transfer and continued attack.

If_nickel, iron, and.molybdenum'are assumed to be completely inert
diluents fof chromium (as is approximetely true), and if the circulation
rate in the MSBR is very rapid, the corrosion process can be simply de-
scribed. At high flow rates, uniform concentrations of UF3 and CrF2 are
maintained throughout the fluid cireuit; these concentrations satisfy (at
some intermediate temperature) the equilibrium constanf for the reaction.
Under these steady-state conditions, there existe some temperature-inter-
mediate between the maximum and minimum temperatures of the circuit, at
which the initial surface composition of the structural metal is at equi-
livrium with the fused salt. Since the equilibrium constant for the chemi-
cal reaction increases with increasing temperature,_the chromium concené
tration in the alloy surface tends to dec:eese at temperatures higher than
T and tends to increase at temperatures lower than T. [In some melts (NaF-
LiF-KF-UFh, for example) AG for the mass transfer reaction is qﬁite large,
and the equilibrium constant changes sufficiently as a function of tem-
perature to cause formation of dendritic chromium crystals in the cold

zone.] For MSBR fuel and other LiF-BeF,-UF) mixtures, the temperature

V
 

 

"

43

dependence of the ﬁass—transfer reaction is small, and the equilibrium is
satisfied at reactor temperature conditions without the formation of
crystalline chromium. |

Thus, in the MSBR, the rate of chromium removal from the salt stream
by deposition at cold—fluid regions is controlled by the rate at which
chromium diffuses into the cold-fluid wéll; the chromium concentration

gradient tends to be small, and the reSulting corrosion is well within

- tolerable limits. In the hot-fluid region, the alloy surface becomes

’

depleted in chromium, and chromium from the interior of the wall diffuses
toward the surface. This rate of diffusion is dependent on the chromium
concentration gradient. Since diffusion occurs by a vacancy process and
in this particular situation is essentially monodirectional, an excess of
vacancies can accumulate in the depleted region. These vacancies precipi- .
tate in areas of disregistry, principally at graih boundaries and impuri-
ties, to form voids. The voids in turn asgglomerate and grow in size with
increasing time and temperature. The resulting subsurface voids are not

interconnected with each other or with the surface.
The mechanisms described above leed to such observations as (a) the
complete independence_of COrrosion'rate from flow rate for a given system

*

and (b) the increase in corrosion with increase in temperature drop as well

as with increase in mean'temperaturerwithin a system,

The results 6f;nﬁmérou§longftermteéts have shown that Hastelloy N
has'excellent cofrosipnlresiSténcé ﬁolmolten_fluoride mixtures at tempera—
tures well sbove those__ anticipated in MSBR. The attack from mixtures
similar to'the MSBﬁ fuel ét'témperatures as high as 1300°F is barely ob-

servable in tests of as long as 12,000 hr. A figure of 0.5 mil/yr might

 
 

 

Ly

be expected.31 Even less corrosion occurs in the blanket where the UFh

concentration is very low. Further, the mechanical properties of
Hastelloy N are virtually unaffected by long-time exposure to the molten
~fluoride fuel and blanket mixtures. Corrosion of the container metal 5y
the reactor fuel and blanket does not seem to be an important problem in
the MSER.

Thié encouraging status fof metal-salt compatibility certainly applies
to the coolant mixture if & reasonable NaF-BeF2 or NaF-LiF—BeF2 mixture is
chosen. It is likely that the'NaF—NaBFh coolant mixture will also prove

compatible with INOR-8, but no detailed experimental proof of this is

available. The free energy change for the chemical reaction

BF3(g) + 3/20r(s) > 3/2CrF2(E) + B(é)

is about +30 kcal at 800°K.32

The reaction is, therefore, quite unlikely
to occur, and similaer reactions with Fe, Mo, and Ni are much less so. In
addition, the above reaction becomes even less likely (perhaps by 10 kcal

or so) when one considers the energetics of formation of the compound

NaBFh and dilution of the NaBFh by NaF. However, the following reaction

BF () + (X + 3/2)M(s) > MkB(S) + 3/2MF

3(g 2(%)

is almost certainly the one to be expected. Thermbchemical-data for the
borides of Cr, Ni, Mo, and Fe do not seem to have been established. Very

stable borides such as TiB, and ZrB2 show free energies of formation of

2
-67 and -68 kcal/mole (or about -34 kcal/boron atom) at 800°K.33 The

borides of Mg (M’gB2 and MgBh) show free energies of formation of less than

33

=10 kcal per boron atom. Unless the borides of the Hastelloy N constitu-

ents are very stable, it would appear that the alloy will prove resistant

to this coolant. However, such compatibility must be demonstrated by ex-
periments.
Compatibility of Graphife With Fluorides
Graphite_does not reaét chemicdlly with molten fluoride mixtures of
the type to be used in fhe-MSBR. Available thermodynamic data6 suggest

that the most likely reactiqn:

hUFh + CZ CFh + hUF3

should come to equilibrium at CFh pressures below 10-8 atm. CF) concen-
trations over graphite-salt systems maintained for long periods at elevat-

3k to be below the limit of detection

ed temperatures have been shown
(> 1 ppm) of this compound by mass spectrometry. Moreover, graphite has
been used as a container material for many NaF—Zth-UFh, LiF-BeF2—UFh, and
other salt mixtures with no evidence of chemical instability.

The MSBR will contain perhaps 20 tons of graphite. Several potential
problems in addition to that of chemical stability have been considered.
These include (1) hazardous incresse in uranium content of core through
permeations of the graphite by fuel, (2) reaction of fuel material with
oxygenated gaseous species'desorbed from the graphite, and (3) carburiza-
tion 6f the HasteiloyN sfrucﬁufegby'éarbon dissolved, suspended, or other-

wise carried in the circulsting sait.r These possibilities have been

studied experimentally and found to be inconsequential or to have practic-

applied pressure, surface tension of the nonwetting liquid (about 130
dynes/cm), and the pore size spectrum of the graphite specimen. Hdwéver,

since the void volume of the graphite may be about 16% of the core fuel

volume, detailed testing of pérmeation behavior has been necessary. Typi

cal‘tests35

with MSRE graphite_have exposed enguated specimens to MSRE
fuel mixtures at 1300°F;»applied pressures were set at 150 1b, a value of
three times the reactor design pressure. The observed permeation did not
change with tiﬁe after a few hours. In these tests 0.18% of the graphite
bulk volume was permeated by the salt; such permeation is well within that
considered tolerable during MSRE operation. Specimens permeated_to this
extent have been given 100 cycles between 390 and 1300°F without detect-

able change in properties or appearance.

Radiation Effectsl’S"S’Bh’36

A considerable body of information about the stability and compati-
bility of MSBR materials under irradiation from fissioning fuel has been
obtained. These studies were motivated by the concern that neutrons, beta
and gamma rays, and fission fragments might cause radiation damage to fuel,
metal, and graphite structural components. Fission fragments, which should
produce localized regions of dense ionization and radiolysis in the molten
salt, might affect fuel stability and corrosion behavior.

Early In-Pile Tests on NaF—Zth—UFh Fuels

 

The earliest studies of radiation effects on molten fluoride systems
were done in the molten-salt ANP program. These tests used NaF-Zth-UFh
mixtures and Inconel containers. Such ifradiations, with melts and metal

chemically similar to those propésed'for the MSBR, were performed over &

wider range of power density and temperature thah were used in more recent
irradiation work in support of the MSRE. More than 100 static capsule
tests were carried out in thermal neutron fluxes from 10ll to 10lh neutrons
cm sec_l, with fission power densitiés from 80 to 8000 w/c, at tempera-
tures from 1500 to 1600°F, and for irradiation times from 300 to 800 hr.
Chemical, physical, ahd metallographic tests indicated no major changes in
the fuel or the Inconel which could be attribﬁted to the irradiation
conditions. Corrosion of Inconel was comparable to that found in unir-
radiated controls. Three types of Inconel forced-circulation in-pile
loops were operated with NaF—Zth-UFh melts at fission power densities of
400 to 800 w/cc, maximum temperatures of 1500 to 1600°C, and for 235 to
475 hr at full power; corrosive attack on the Inconel was no greater than

in corresponding out-of-pile tests (wall penetrations less than 3 mils).

Early Tests on LiF—BeF2-UFh Fuels

 

The first irradiation test on an'LiF—BeFLbased fuel was a graphite~
fuel compatibility test in the MTR. Two Inconel capsules containing
graephite liners filled with LiF-BeF,-UF) (62-37-1 mole %) were irradiated

at 1250°F for 1610 and 1492 hr, and at average power densities of 954 and

- 920 w/ece, respectively. Thé-eprsure reéulted in no apparent damage to

the graphite, and negligib;éféorrosion to the Incoﬁél which was exposed
fd,the salt thrOUgh:smaliuthés ih the graphite liner.

In the next test, two small Hastelloy N capsules ﬁere‘filled with the

same’ LiF-BeF,~UF, mixture and irradisted for 5275 hr in a flux of 1 to

2 x lO:VI',4 heutr¢nscm-2“sec-latan initial power density of 1170 w/cc and

a temperature of 1250°F to an estimated T5% burnup. The failure of one

 
 

 

48

capsule at this time forced términation of the experimént. The results of
later tests suggest that fuel radioiysis at ambient reactor temperature
during shutdowns may have contributed importantly to the capsule failure.

Two forced-circulation Hasteiloer loops containing the‘above-LiF-
BeFe—UFh mixture were also installed and operated in the MTR. These were
designed to operate at 1300°F maximum temperature, 190 w/cc power density,
and a linear flow velocity of 2.5 ft/sec. Pump failure terminated the
first test after 860 hr and the second after 1000 hr. Métallographic eX-
emination of the metal from the first loop revesled a moderately eroded
region (approximately 2 mils deep) in one of the sharp bends in the high-
flux region. Metal specimens from the second loop showed a negligible
degree of corrosive attack. Since later in-pile tests confirmed the good
corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N, it is suspected that the first loop
was fabricated from substandard alloy.
Testing of MSRE Fuels

The ORNL~-MTR-U4T7- series of capsule irradiation experiments was design-
ed to test the stability and compatibility of actual MSRE materials (graph-
ite, Hastelloy N, and fuel salt) under conditions approximately those of
the MSRE, with emphasis on the interfacial behavior of molten salt and
graphite. The capsules were relatively large to provide adequate speci-
mens of graphite, fuel, and Hastelloy N for thorough postirradiation exsmi-
nation.

In the U7-3 test, four Hastelloy N capsules (see Fig. 12) containing
graphite boats holding a pool of fuel salt (BeF2-UFh-LiF—ThFh-Zth, 23.2-
1.4-69.0-1.2-5.2 mole %) were irradiated for 1594 hr at meximum tempera- -

tures of 800°C and maximum power densities of 200 w/cc to a burnup of sbout

with the fuel to provide a more'extreme test of graphiteéfﬁel cdmpatibility
at high tempefature. When the capsules were dlsmantled the frozen fuel

the irradiated fuel was aliowed to freezé-an& cool below 100°C did radio-
lytic decomposition take placé. .

The 47-b irradiation assembly comprised of four large Hastelloy N cap-
sules (seérFig.'13), each containing a 0.5-in.-diam graphite specimen sur-
rounded by & 0.2-in. annulus of fuel, and two smai_l Hasfelldy N capsules

containing a 0.5-in.-0OD graphite cup nearly filled with fuel. The largé

‘capsules contained about 25 g of fuel (BeF -UFh-LlF-ThFh—Zth, 22.6-0. -

same fuel; the other 10 g of & similar fuel of higher UFh concentration

to 800°c (900°C for the small 1.4 mole % UF), capsule), at average power

The gas analyses detected no CFh or other fluorine-containing gases in any
of the 36 gas samples; CF), deliberately added to the capsules during ir-
radiation was radiolytically decomposed at a rate which decreased with tem-
perature and seldom exceeded L4%/hr. .
Particular care was given to the postirradiation examination of the
graphite specimens. No uranium deposits were found by chemical analysis,
by delayed neutron counting of neutron activated specimens, or by x-radio-

graphy of thin sections. It is therefore clear that uranium deposition on

graphite is associated only with fuel radiolysis at low temperatures, and

that the reaction does not take place between graphite and molten fission-

ing fuel. In addition, visual, metallographic, and x-ray diffraction ex-
aminations of the 47-6 graphite specimens failed to reveal any differences
between the irradiated graphite and unirradiated controls. Also, the
Hastelloy N capsule wall specimens from run 47-6 appeared unaffected by
the exposure based on visual and low-power magnification examination.
Metallographic examination of unetched specimens revealed no change in
wall thickness (less than 1 mil change). |
Conclusions from In-Pile Testing of Molten Salts

In summary, the 47- series'of_irrédiation studies has been generally
reéssuiing as to the radiatibﬁ staﬁility and ccmpatibility of Hastelloy N,

graphite, and fuels based on lithium and beryllium fluorides. The cor-

- rosion that is known to occur, i.e., that due to mass transfer, does not

seem'to;be influenced by pcwer density. It has been shown that the prin-
cipal_disturbing effects_are‘conseQuences of low-temperature fuel radioly-
sis which is easily suppressed by maintaining the irradiated fuel at a

temperature above (conservatively) 200°C. On the basis of the L7- series

 
 

 

56

tests, the limits of this'reassufance}in'regard‘to radiatioh effects on
MSBR materiels extend to temperatures of about lhOObF and power densities
of about 100'w/cc.

The two previous loop tests onrsimilar LiF;BeF2 fuels, described a-
bove, extend the limits of dssurance tO‘power densities of 200 w/cc at
1300°F with regard to'corroéion of Hastelloy N in the absence of graphite.
There has been no indication of the U7- series experiments that graphite
introduces problems in addition to the expected one of Hastelloy N carburi-
zation (when the two are in close contact).

The previous capsule tests with LiF-Ber-UFh fuels, carried out with
no provisions to circumyent the low-temperature fuel radiolyéis effect,
suggested that salt power densities of at least 1 kw/cc may be permissible.
Also, the numerous tests with NaF-Zth-UFh fuels in Inconel at temperatures
up to 1600°F and power densities up to many kilowatts per cubic centimeter
exhibited tolerable compatibility characteristics. With respect to radia-
tion effects, there is no obvious chemical reason to suppose that a gross-

ly different salt behavior would be observed using MSBR materials.

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS IN MOLTEN SALTS3“S

Fission products will be produced in & 2225-Mw(th) MSBR &t a rate of
about 2.3 kg/day. In the reference MSBR'design, the fuel salt volume is

about T00 ft3

and the-fissilé inventory about 700 kg; with these values
the fission product concentration after 50 days accumulation would be about
15% of the fissile concentration. Thus, it is clear that fission product
concentrations can be significant even with high processing rates, and
that fission product behavior needs to be considefed in specifying reactor
operating condifions.
Physical Chemistry of Fission Products

Fission and its immediate aftermath must be a violent process; the
very energetic major fragments are probably deficient in electrons at their
origin, and, as they lose energy by cbllisions, they undoubtedly produce
additional ionization within the medium. It seems certain, however, that
electrical charge is conserved in this,précess; electrons and protons are
heither created.nor déstroyed by . the fission event. It follows, therefore,
that when fission of UF) occurs in an inert environment [as in a (hypo-

thetical).completely inert container] the reaction
| o o :7 - + -
- UFh-+ n ¥ 2FP +2n +,hF

must in a statlstlcal sense, satlsfy the conditions that (l) the salt be

_electrlcally neutral and (2) redox equllibrlum be established among the

numerous ionic spec1es.r In an 1nert contalner such catlon—anlon equlva-
lence (and redox equlllbrlum) mlght be satlsfled w1th uranlum valence

states above h and with p051t1ve 1on formatlon by Nb, Mo, Te, or Ru. The

MSBR contalner metal (Hastelloy N) is not completely inert and the fuel

 
 

 

58

contains a small concentration of UF3, so additional possibilities exist

- for this system. Should the fission product cations.ﬁrove inadequate for
the fluoride ions plus the fiésion product anions (notably I ), or should
they prove adequate only by assuming element valencerstatesltdo highrto be
- thermodynamically compatible with Hastelloy N, the container metal would
be constrained to supply the cation deficiency.

Thermochemical data from whiéh,the st&bilify of‘fissidnlproduct
fluorides in complex dilute solutions can be predicted‘are lacking in many
cases. BSuch information which appears definite is briefly described in
the following sections.

Rare Gases
The fission products krypton and xenon are volatilized from high-tem-

34,37

perature melts as elements. The solubilities of these gases in mol-

ten fluoride mixtures38’39’ho

obey Henry's law, increase with increasing
temperature, decrease with increasing atomic weight of the gas, and vary
somewhat with composition of the solvent. Henry's law constants and heats
of solution for the rare gases in LiF--BeF2 mixtures are shown in Table 9.

The positive heat of solution ensures that blanketing or sparging of the

fuel with helium or argon in a low-temperature region of the reactor can-

not lead to difficulty due to decreased solubility and bubble formation in

higher temperature regions of the system. [There is no evidence of
trouble from such source in MSRE where the He is appiied in the pump bowl
at the highest temperature in the circuit.]

The very low solubilities of these gases suggest tha£ they shoﬁld be

readily removed from reactor systems. Only a small fraction of the calcu-

lated xenon poisoning was observed during operation of the Aircraft Reactor

that the removal step is chemically feasible.
Elements in Periodic Groups I-A, II-A, II-B, and IB-B

Rubidium, cesium, étrontium, barium, zirconium, yttrium, and the
lanthanides form very stable fluorides."TheSe fission préducts should, ac-
cordingly, exist in the molten fuel in their ordinary valence states. A
variety of studies of many typésvéhows'that iarge amounts of Zth, the
alkali fluorides, and the alkaline earth fluorides can bédiséolved in MSBR
fuel mixtures at operating températures. Since the tfifluorides are less
soluble, the solubility behavior of the fluorides of yt£rium and the rare

43,4y L5

_earths, and of plutonium _haé been examined in some detail. The
saturating phase from solutions in LiF—BeF2 and related mixtures is the
simple trifluoride; when more than one rare earth is present, the saturat-
ing phase is & (nearly ideal) solid solution of the trifluorides. Such
solid solutions are known to accommodate UF3 and it is very likely that

they would include PuF. as well. The solubilities of these solid solutions

3
depend strongly on composition of the melt; the solubilities may be near
the minimum value for MSBR fuel compositions. Even then, howéver, the
solubility (near 0.5 mole % at MSBR operating temperatures) is such that
many months would be required for the reactor to saturate its fuel with
these fission products. In any case, reprocessing to remove the rare
earths, and particularly neédymium, is required in the interest of neutron
economy .

The above statements regarding rubidium and cesium do not apply to
that fraction of these elements originating in the graphite as daughters

of the rare gases which have permeated the moderator. These alkali metals

form compounds with graphite at high temperature but the absolute amounts

are so small that difficulties from this source are unlikely. Damage to
the gfaphite.by this'mechanism will, as a matter of.course, be looked for
in all future radiation and fission sfudies.
Other Fission Products

These products include molybdenum, ruthenium, technétium, niocbium, and
telluriumproduced in relatively high yields with rhodium, palladium,
silver, cadmium; tin, and antimbny in yields ranging from small to trivial.

The available thermochemical data
of these elemen£s-wou1d be (if they were present in the pure state) reduced
to the métal by chromium at its activity in Hastelloy N or by UF3 at
reasonable concentyations in the fuel salt.

The high-yield noble metals (Mo, Nb, Ru, Tc, and Te) have polyvalent
fluorides which are generélly quite volgtile and moderately unstable. The

formation free energies for NbF MoF6, and UF6 may be calculated with

5’
relatively good accuracy because of recent measurements at Argonne of the

heats of formation of these éompounds by fluorine bomb calorimetry.hT-hg

The entropies and heat capacity data also are available.so While the
people at Argonne have measured RuFE,Sl no entropy or heat capacity data

seem to be available:

From these values and the availsble heat capacity data the following ex-

pressions for AGf were derived. In the Case of RuF5, Glassner's6 earlier

In Fig. 15, calculated equilibrium partial pressures of the gases are
plotted vs the UF3/UFh ratio in the melt. As the oxidizing power of the

melt is increased,NbF5 is expected to appear first, followed by MoF6, and

then RuF_. Uranium hexafluoride has a lower dependence on oxidizing power

fluorldes of Nb Mo, and Ru are formed in the melt the result would be

correspondlngly lowered equlllbrlum gas pressures and lowered power

If the chemically active fission products shown in Table 10 occur as

. Bée+, 13+, 3% (rare earths), Zrh+, and Mt
and if krypton, xenon, molybdenum, technetium, and ruthenium occur as
elements, and if no fission product species are removed from the réactor,'
then the total fission product yield mﬁltipliéd by the valencé-(iXiZi) will
be 3.475 and 3.560 at 11.6 and 116 days, respectively. If all krypton and
xenon nuclides of half-life greater than 5 ﬁinutes are removed from the
system before they decay, the comparsable ZXiZi valueg become 3.21 and 3.26.
If all krypton and xenon nuclides with half;lives greater then 1 minute are
removed before decay, the IX.Z; values aré 3.06 and 3.09 at 11.6 and 116
days, respectively. The above EXiZi values (which seem inadequate to
satisfy the fluoride ions released by the fissioned uranium)suggeSf that
thé fission process is per se oxidizing to UF3 and ultimately to Hastelloy
N. Results of many in-pile tests of compatibility of the materials, how-
ever, suggest that fission does not lead to corrosion of this container
metal. |

If, on the other hand, all the molybdenum formed MoF6 and the techne-.
tium formed ‘I'cF5 then the fission process would require more than 4 fluo-
ride ions per fission event and the fission process would per se be reduc-
ing to UFh' Even for the rather unrealistic case where all xenon and
krypton species with half-lives in excess of 1 minute were removed the
X 2, values would be near 4.5. This would require reduction of one mole
of UFh to UF3 for each 2 moles of uranium fissioned.

Both extremes (that is a strongly oxidizing or a strongly reducing

action of the fission process) seem unlikely. It seems likely that a

fraction of the molybdenum, niobium, and technetium exist as fluorides
 

 

 

o

67

(of valence lower than this maximum) and that, accordingly, the net effect

of fission is neither markedly oxidizing nor markedly reducing to the

~Hastelloy N-UFh system.

Should. subsequent long-term tests at high burnup prove the fission
process to be oxidizing the cure would seem to be relatively simple; if the
burned uranium were made up by addition of UF3 (or UF3.+ UFh) the problem
would be solved. Similarly, if the fission processes were (unexpectedly)
reducing toward UFh the makeup of burned uranium could be as a mixture of

UF5 (or UF6) with UF).

CHEMICAL, BEHAVIOR IN MSRE
General

The Molten-Salt Resactor Experiment operated during six separate
periods in 1966; virtually all of the operating time accumulated aftéf mid-
May_was at the maxiﬁum possible power of about T.5 M#. The reﬁctor accumu-
lated approximately 11,200 Mwhr during the year. Additional operation in
1967 (essentially ali at maximum.powér) led to:accumulatioh of an addition-
al 21,000 Mwhr as of the scheduled shutdown on May 10,:1967;

During periods of reactor operation, samples 6f thé reactor salts were
remofed routinely and were ansglyzed for major constituents, corrosion
pfoducts and (less frequently) oxide co#tamiﬁation. Standard semples of
fuel are drawn three times per week; the LiF—BeF2 coolant salt is sampled
every two weeks. ' -

Current chemical analyses suggest no perceptible composition changes.
for the salts since they were first introduced inté the reactor some 20
months ago.

While analyses for Zth and for UFh agree quite well with the material

T

balance on quantities charged to the reactor tanks, the values for 'LiF and

BeF2 have never done so; analyses for LiF have shown lower and fOrw'BeF2

have shown highervalues than the book value since startup. Teble 11 shows
a comparison of current analysis with the original inventory value. While
the discrepancy in LiF and BeF2
nothing in the analysis (or in the behavior of the reactor) to suggest that

concentration remains a puzzle, there is

any changes have occurred.

Routine determinations of oxide (by study of salt-H,.0-HF equilibria)

e

2

continue to show low values (&bout 50 ppm) for 02-. There is no reason to

69

believe that contemination of the fuel has been significant in operations

to the present.

MSRE maintenance operations have necessitated flushing the interior of
the drained reactor circuit on four occasions. The salt used for this oper-

7

ation consisted originally of an 'LiF-BeF, (66.0-34.0 mole %) mixture.
Analysis of this salt before and after each use shows that 215 ppm of
uranium is added to the flush salt in each flushing operation, correspond-

ing to the removal of 22.7 kg of'fuel-salt residue (about 0.5% of the

charge) from the reactor circuit.

 

Corrosion in MSRE
The chromium concentration in MSRE fuel is 64 ppm at present; the en-

tire operation seems to have increased the chromium concentration only 26

ppm. Thié increase cérreéﬁbndsfto,remdval of about 130 g of chromium from

the ﬁetal of the fuel circﬁith If;this were removed uniformly it would
repréSent removal of chrqmium;to é depth_of gbout 0.1 mil. Analyses for
i:oh and nickel in the system are relatively high (120 and 50 ppm respec-

+
tively) and do not seem to represent dissolved Fe2+ and N12 . While there

 
 

 

 

 

T0

is considerable scatter in these enalyses, there seems to be no indication
of corrosion of the Hastelloy N by the salt.

rThe absence of corrosion--though in general accord with resuits from
a wide variety of out-of-pile corrosion tests--seems somewhat surprising
for the following reasons. The UF3 concentration of the fuei'ﬁdded to MSRE

was markedly less than intended. Careful reexsmination of the production

records and study of the reaction

an additional 1100 grams of U3' should have resulted. With that originally

the uranium in the system could have been trivalent. An attempt, however,

3+
to determine the U3 (by the H _-HF reaction above) after 11,000 Mwhr of

2
MSRE operation indicated that less than 0.1% of the uranium was trivalent.
Fission of the 550 grams of uranium (corresponding 11,000 Mwhr) could
certainly not have oxidized more than 40% of the 1350 grams of vt vhien
had apparently been oxidized. The remaining 800 graﬁs (approximately)
could have been oxidized by inadvertent contamination (as by 60 grams of

HEO desorbed from the moderator stack). However, the réte of corrosion

even by this relatively oxidizing'fuel melt remained imperceptibly slow.

Addition of beryllium metal (as 3" rods of 3/8" diameter in a perfo-
rated basket of nickel) through the samplihg system in the pump bowl served
as a convenient means of reducing Uh+ to g3t during reactor operation. 1In
this form beryllium appeafs to react at about 1.25 grams per hour so that
some 600 grams of U3+ are produced by an 8 hour treatment. Some 30 grams
of Be have been added in this way to create an additional 1.6 kg of U3+.
During the subsequent 20,000 Mwhr of operation (which burned 1 kg of urani-
um) this 1.6 kg of U3 seems to have been oxidized. Again, it seems likely
that the fission process was responsible for okidizing a substantial frac-
tion, but ndt all of, this material.

Additidnal‘beryllium will be added to MSRE fuel as soon s power oper-
ation is resumed; it is tentatively planned to reduce at least 1% of the
U* to U3* at that time.

The lack of corrosion in MSRE by melts which appear to be more oxidiz-
ing than those intended can be rationalized by the assumption (1) that the
Hastelloy N has been depleted in Cr (and:Fe) at the surface so that only

Mo and Ni are eXposed to attack,'with Cr (and Fe) reacting only at the slow

rate at which it is furnished to the surface by diffusion, or (2) that the

noble-metal fission,produhfsf(see gections following) are forming an ad-

herent and protéctivé platé on the feactor_meta1.

Behavior of Fission Produétssy?5$°'

Helium is inffddﬁcedfihtq the‘puﬁp-bOVl.of MSRE at & rate of about U4

liters per minute; this helium serves to strip Kr and Xe from the fuel in

the pump bowl’and to'swéep,these gases to the charcoal-filled traps far
downstream in the exit gas system. Since a relatively'small'fraétion (less

than 10%) of the fuel mixture is bypassed through the pump bowl, the ef-

ficiency of removal of the fission product gases should not be very high.
However, the Xe poisoning of MSEE st T Mw is onlj about 0.3% in AK/K, &
value considerably less than was anticipated. This low poison level is
probably due to stripping of Xe within the fuel system into hélium bubbles
which are known to circulate (at perhaps 0.2% by volume) in the fuel salt.

- Samples of MSRE fuel, drawn in 10 to 50 cc metal samples at the sampl- -
ing station in the pump bowl, have been routinely analyzed, by radiochemi-
cal techniques, for 14 fission product isotopes and, in some cases, for
239Np and 239Pu produced in the fuel. In general, the fission product
species which are known to possess stable fluorides are present in the cir-
culating fuel at approximstely the éxpected concentration levels. Tﬁe best

fluorides, and no precursors of consequence typicaliy and consistently show
concentration levels some 15% lower than those calculated from power levels
based upon heat balances for the reactor.

Those elements whose fluorides are known to be relatively unstable
(molybdenum, niobium, ruthenium, tellurium, and silver) are found in the
salt at considersbly less than the expected conceﬁtration. If calculations
of amounts expected are based upon concentrations of 9lsr, about 60% of the

and, especially, of specimens from the vapor phase as described below do
show several surprises. |

An assembly of MSRE graphite and Hastelloy N specimens was exposed on
the central stringerrwithin the MSRE core dufing its initial operation.
This asseﬁbly was removed during the July 17 shutdown after 7800 Mwhr of
reactor operation, and many specimens have been carefully examined.

No evidence of alteration of the graphite was found under examinsation
by visual, x-radiographic, and metallograephic examination. Autoradiographs
showed that penetration of radioactive materials into the graphite was not
uniform andrdisclosed a thin (pefhaps 1- to 2-mil) lasyer of highly radio;

active materials on or near the exposed graphite surfaces. Examination of

the metal specimens showed no evidence of corrosion or other danger.

Rectangular bars of graphite frcﬁ'the top (outlet), middle, and bottom
(inlet) region of this central stringer‘were milled in the hot cell to re-
move six succeésive leyers from each surface. The removed lsyers were then
analyzed for several fission'product isotopes.

The results of analysis of the outer layer from the graphite specimens
are shown in Table 12. It iscleaf that, with the assumption of uniform
deposition on or in all fge*mddergtérjgréphite,‘appreciable.fractions of
Mo, Te, and Ru and a largé fracﬁion.of.ﬁhe&Nb are assbciated with the

tion with several hundred angstroms of relatively noble metals.

The only gas-liquid interface-in the MSRE (except_for~the contact be-
tween liquid and the gas-filled pores of the moderatof graphite) exists in
the pumplﬁowl. There a salt flow of about 60 gpml(B% of the total system
flow) contacts a helium cover gas which floﬁsthrough #he bowl at U4 liters/
min. Provisions for direct seampling of this exit gas are planned.but have
not yet been installed in the MSRE. |

Samples of the liquid fuel are obtained by lowering arsampler, on a
stainless steel cable, through this cover gas and into the liquid. It has
been possible, accordingly, to detect chemically active fiésionproduct
species in this cover gas by radiochemical analysis of ﬁhe.stainless steel
cable and its accessories which contact only the gas phase and by analysis
of special getter materials which are attached to the cable. Coils of
silver wire and specimens of Hastelloy N have generally been used as get-
ters for this purpose. No quantitative measure of the isotopes present in
the gas phase is possible, since no good estimate can be made of the gas
volume sampled. The quantity of material deposited on the wire specimen.
does not correlaste well with contact time (in the range 1 to 10 min) or
with the getter materials studied.

The quantity of material deposited, however, is relatively large.
Table 14 indicates relative amounts found in typical tests. There'is no
doubt that Mo, Ru, Te, (and from subseqﬁent tests, Nb) are sppearing in
the helium gas of the pump bowl. The quantities are, moreover, surprising-
ly large; if the materials are presumed to be vapors the partial pressures
would be above 10-6 atmosphere. The i¢dine isotopes show perceptibly dif-

ferent behavior. Iodine-135, whose tellurium precursor has a short half-

life, does not appear, while ~~ I and ~~-I, both of which have tellurium

precursors of appreciable half;life,'are foun&. These findings--along with
the fact that these iodine isotopes argvpresgnt in the salt at near their
expegted concentration--suggest that any iodine in the vapor phase comes

as a result of volatilization of the tellurium'precufsors.

Early attempts to find uranium on the wires (as from evolution of UF6)
were ﬁnsuccessful. More recent attempts--perhaps with the oxidation po-
tential of the salt at a higher level--have shown significantluranium depo-
sition corresponding to several parts pér million in the gas phase. It is
possible, But it seems unlikely, that "salt spray" could account for this
observed uranium. Salt spray certainly does not account for the observed
noble metal species carried in the gas.

The behavior of these fission product species in the gas phaSe'seems
to correlate poorly--if at all--with the UF3/UFh ratio in the fuel melt.
Concentrations of Mo, Nb, Ru, and Te in the gas phase seem to‘increase (or
decrease) together but were unaffected--within the considerable scatter of
the data--by the deliberate addition of beryllium to the MSRE melt. The
concentrations of these elements in the fuel decrease (after correction for
radiocactive decay) during reactor shutdowns; such behavior would be expect-
ed if they plate out upon metallic or other surfaces. Concentrations in
the gas phase decrease somewhat more than>those in the salt but the dif-
ferences seem much smaller than should be attributsble to (for example)
some radiation chemistry oxidation process to produce MoF6, etc.

It seems most unlikely thet these data can be reconciled as equilibri-
un behavior of the volatile fluorideé. It is possible that the MSRE metal

is plated with a noble-metal alloy whose thickness is several hundred

L

angstroms, and it is conceivable that the UF, /UF_ ratio is near 10 . The
, | y/ U3

compound NbF_ could show an appreciable pressure under these circumstances.

>
The other possibilities such as MoF6,.TeF6, and RuF5 would require much
higher UFL/UF3 ratios, and it seems.most uplikely that any single redox po-
tential can yield the relative abundance observed for these isotopes.

The recent findings of‘silver and palladium isotopes in relatively
high concenﬁration in the gas phase seem (since these elements certainly
lack volatile fluorides) to case additional doﬁbt on species such as MoF6,
Rqu, etc. as the gas-borne species.

One possible explanation of the available data is the following: The
noble metal species (Mo, Nb, Ru, Te, Ag, Pd, and probably Tc) occur--as
thermodynemics predicts--in the elemental state. They originate as (or
very rapidly become) individual metal atoms. They aggregate at some finite
rate, probably alloying.witﬁ one another in the process and become insolu-
ole as very_minute colloidal particles which then grow at a slower rate.
These colloidal particles are not wetted by the fuel, tend to collect at
gas-liquid interfsces, and oan readily be swept into the gas stream of the

helium purge of the pump bowl .They tend to plate upon the metal surfaces

of the system, to form carbides (Nb and Mo only) with the graphite, and

(as extraordlnarily flne smoke") to penetrate the outer layers of the

moderator. Whlle there are difflculties with thlS interpretation it seems

| more plauslble than others suggested to date.

It is clear that further study and addltlonal data from MSRE and from

sophlstlcated in-pile loop tests will be required before'the-detalls of

fission product behavior can be uoderstood.

Fluoride mixtures required for the MSRE wefe prepared by-a batch

process in a facility initially designed to support the various:chemicél

is shown in Fig. 17. Starting materials were weighed into appropriate
batch sizes and simultaneously transferred.by vibratory conveyor to a melt-
down furnace assembly. In addition to providing a molten charge to each
of two adjacent processing units, the meltdown facilify was utilized for
preliminary purification of the fluoride mixtures. Beryllium%metal turn-
ings were added to reduce structural-metal impufities to their ihsoluble
metallic states. The molten mixture was also sparged with helium and hy-
drogen at relativeiy high flow rates to remove insoluble carbon by entrain-
ment.

 Primary salt purification was achieved in each of two batch prbcess-
ing units. The melts were inifially‘sparged with é géseous mixture of an-

SEPARATIONS PROCESSES IN MSBR FUELS AND BLANKETS

Use of molten salt reactors as thermal.breeders will obviously require
effective scheﬁes-for,decontamination of the fuel and for recovery of bred
uranium from the blanket. No provision, however, was made for on-streanm
removal of fission products from the MSRE, and fuel reprocessing has re-
ceived less attention to date than have more immediate materials problems
of this and éimilar machines. No detailed rgprocessing scheme has, accord-
ingly, been demonstréted.

Recovery of uranium from molten fluorides by volatilization as urani-

um hexafluoride and the subsequent purification of this UF6 by rectifica-

tion or by sorption-desorption on NaF beds is well demonstrated. Recovery

of bred urenium from blankets or removal of uranium (where necessary to
facilitate other processing operations) from the fuel, therefore, is clear-
ly feasible. Such volatility processing is described in some detail else-

56

where in this series.

57

More recent studies”’ have shown that the LiF, BeF2 (and Zth, if
present) can be recovered quantitatively, along with much of the uranium,
by vacuum distillation at temperatures near 1000°C; very encouraging de-
cohtamingtion-faétors frqm fare earth fluorides (which are left behind in
the stillbottoms).have beeh demonst:ated. As is described elsewhere in
this series’C this distillation procedure combined with recovery of UFy by

fluorination shows real promise as a fﬁelrprocessing technique.

‘Several other techniques have,shown promise, at least'in preliminary

testing.‘-A brief Summary;ofrthese is presented in the following.

Possible Separation70f Rafe Earths from Fuel

The rare earth fission products, which are the most important nuclear

 
 

 

20

poisons in a reactor fram which xenon is effectively removed, form vefy
stable trifluorides with a portion of that F_; released as fiséion of uran-
~ium as UFh' There is no doubf, therefore, fhat these fission products are
dissolved in the molten fuel and are availsble for reprocessing.
By Solid-Liquid=Equilibria | |

The limited solubility of these trifluorides (though sufficient to
prevent their precipitatibn under ﬁormal MSBR conditions) suggested &ears
8go a possible recovery scheme. When a LiF;Ber-UFh melt (in the MSBR
coﬁcentration fange) that is saturated withld single rare‘earth fluoride

(LaF_,, for example) is cooled slowly the precipitate is the pure simple

3’

trifluoride. When the melt contains more than one rare earth fluoride the
precipitate is a (nearly ideal) solid solution of the trifluorides. Ac-
cordingly, addition of an excess of CaF3 or LaF3 to the melt followed by
heating to effect dissolution of the added trifluoride and cooling to ef-
fect crystallization effectively removes the fission product rare earths
from solu.tion.hh It is likely that effective removal of the rare earths

and yttrium (along with UF_ and PuF3) can be obtained by passage of the

3

fuel through a heated bed of solid CeF., or LaF_. The price, which is al-

3 3

most certainly too high, is that the resulting fuel solution is saturated

with the scavenger fluoride (LaF, or CeF3, whose cross section is far from

3
negligible) at the temperature of contact.

Since the rare earth fluorides seem to form with uranium trifiuoride
solid solutions similar to those described above it is possible to con-
sider UF3 as the scavenger material. It should be possible to reduce the
fuel UFh to UF3 and then by passage of the solution through a bed of UF3

to remove the contaminant rare earths; in principle, by careful control of

the columnn tempersture (and, thereby, the solubility of UF3) one could ob-
tain from the column a fuel of-the correct uranium concentration which
could be returned to the reactor after oxidation (by HF or HF--H2 mixture)
of UF, to UFh' While the process deserves further study, the great insta-

3

bility of UF, in solutions of high UF3/UFh ratios and the great ease with ‘

3
vhich the metallic uranium alloys with structural metals will probably make
the process-unattfactive in practice.

Removal of rare earth ions, and other ionic fission product species,
by use of cation exchangers also seems an appealing possibility. The ion
exchanger would, of course, need (1) to be quite insoluble, (2) to be ex-
tremely unreactive (in a gross sense) with the melt, and (3 ) to take up
rare earth cations in exchange ions of low neutron cross section. For
rare earth separations it would pfobably suffice if the material exchanged
normal Ce3+ or La3* for the fission product rare earths; other separation

: ' +
schemes (such as distillstion) would be required to remove the Ce3‘ or

La3

* but they could operate on a much longer time cycle. [The bed of CeF3
described above functions in an ion exchanger; it fails to.be truly bene-
ficial because it is t00ﬂsqlﬁb1e'in the melt. ]

Bi Reduction

The rare earth fluorides are very stable toward reduction to the |
metal. For example, at 1000°K the reaction

gLaF (¢c) + Be(c) -> %La(c) + BeF

where ¢ and £ indicate crystalline solid and liquid, respectively, shows

+ 32.4 kcal for the free energy of reaction. With the LaF. in dilute solu-

3
tion and BeF2 in concentrated solution in LiF—BeF2 nmixture the free energy
change is, of course, even more_unfavorable. However, the rare earth
58

metals form extremely stable solutions”  in molten metals such as bismuth.
Beryllium is virtually insoluble in bismuth and forms no intermetallic
compounds with this metal. Accordingly, the reaction

where d indicates that the species is dissolved in 2LiF-BeF2, ¢ indicates
crystalline solid, and Bi indicates a dilute alloy in bismuth, can be made
to proceed essentially to completion. Accordingly, LaFé can be reduced

and extracted into molten Bi from LiF—BeF2 mixtures.

tures of BeO, Th02, or UO, has been demonstrated. Precipitation of

2
an oxide of protactinium, adsorption of protactinium on the added oxide,
or (more likely) formation of a solid solution of protactinium oxide with
the best oxide, has been shown to be essentially complete, The process
has been-deﬁonstrated to be reversible; treatment of the oxide-fluoride
mixture with asnhydrous HF dissolves the added (or precipitated) oxide and
returns the protactinium to solution from which it can readily be repre-
cipitated. It seems likely that protactinium might be removed from the

blanket by passage of a side stream through a tower packed with ThO (or

2
possibly Be0O); the protactinium, in some unidentified form, would remain

on the bed and would there decay to 233U outside the neutron field. In

its passage through the packed bed of oxide the blanket melt becomes satu-
rated with oxide ion. This oxide ion concentration would probably have to
> before the melt
could be returned to the blankét sﬁream.

. EE Reduction

The possibility ofrecovery'of pfotactinium from realistic LiF-BeF,-
ThFh blanket mixturesby_redgction has been‘examined experimentally with
su;prising'and‘encouraging_results.63' No real information exists as to
the free énergy formetion of thefluorides of protactinium. Accordingly,
' 233

experiments were performed in which traces of Pa were added to LiF-BeFe-

ThFh melts, the melts were carefully treated with HF and H2 to insure

 
 

 

 

96

conversion of protactinium to fluoride and its dissolution in the melt,

and the solution subsequently treated with a strong reducing agent. Some

experiments used ThPb, in lead or ThBi3 iﬁ bismuth as the reductant; other

2

tests have used metallic thorium. Ih each case, the protactinium remained
in molten fluoride solution (as judged by radiochemical analysis of filter-
ed samples) until the reducing agent was added and was removed, upon ad-
dition of reductant, to very loﬁ concentration levels. Figure 21 shows\
the data for a typical case. The removal has been shown to be nearly
quantitative at both traces (less than part per billion) levels and at
realistic concentrations (50 ppm) of 231p, traced with 233pg. The process
has also been shown to be reversible; sparging of the system with HF or
HF-H2 mixtures returns the protactinium quantitatively to the molten fluo-
ride solution.

lRecovery of the precipitated protactinium has proved to be more dif-
ficult. Attempts to obtain the deposited protactinium in molten Bi or Pb
have been generally unsuccessful in equipment of irdn, copper, niobium,
or steel; the deposited protactinium was only fleetingly (if ever) dis-
solved in the molten metal. When thorium was used as the reductant no ap-
preciable concentration of protactinium was found in the excess thorium.
Careful examination of sectioned apparatus shows some protactinium on the
vessel walls, and some appears to remain suspended (in easily filterable
form) in the salt. The mechenism of removal of protactinium from the salt
mixture remains far from certain. It appears likely that the thorium (or
slightly weaker reducing sgent) reduces protactinium to form a moderately

stable intermetallic compound (perhaps with Cr or Fe) which is filterable,

is not dissolved by the molten lead or bismuch, and is readily decomposed

Attempts to recover the protactlnlum by reductlon with metalllc thor—
ium in steel equipment in the presence of added iron surface (steel WOOl)
have shown some promlse.sh In a typical experlment, some 320 grams of
LiF-ThF) (27 mole % ThEh) contaiaing'Blppm (26 mg) of‘protactiniaﬁ was

added to the mixture, and it was'treated firstrwith & mixture of HF and H,

‘and then with H, alone. Four grams of steel wool (grade 00, 0.068 m /g

surface area) was placed in a low—carbon-steel llner inside another nickel

vessel. The contents of th;s vessel were then treated with purlfled hydro-

- gen at,800°0 for several hours torremove}as much as possible of the oxide

surfaee contaainatioh of the steel weol and liner. The two vessela ﬁere
then'connected together at room temperature and heated to about 650°C, and
the.salt was transferred to the steel—liaed vessel. After two separate‘
exposures of the salt to a.solld thorium surface, as 1nd1cated in Teble 15,

-

the salt was transferred back to its original conta1ner and allowed to
cool in helium. The steel—lined vessel was cut up, and samples were sub-
mittedkfor‘analysis. |

The data in Table 15 show that 99% of the protactiniuéiwas;precipi-‘
tated in a form that would not pass through a sintered copper filter after

a fairly short exposure to solid thorium, but nearly 7% was in the un-

filtered salt that was transferred back to the nickel vessel after ex- .

posure to thorium. About 69 g of salt was associated with the steel wool

in the steel liner in the form of a hard ball. ' Partial separation of the

salt from steel wool was effected by use of a magnet after crushing the
ball, and the ifen;rieh fraction hed‘the higher protectinium concentration.
The small amount ofprotactiniuﬁ found on tﬁe‘veesel wall is especially
notable. “Coprecipitatioh of metallic protactinium and iron (and possibly
nickel) wouid help to account for the manner in which protactinium settled
out on, and adhered tp, the steel wool surface.

On the basis of presently available information, thorium reduction of

protactinium from molten breeder blanket mixtures in the presence of steel

- wool is believed to be a promising recovery method warranting further in-

vestigation.
Recent experiments have shown, in addition, that the handling of pro-
tactinium is simplified somewhat if graphite serves as the container.

When irradiated thorium metal (containing

red thfough the bismuth and is oxidizedAby HF and dissolved in the LiF-

‘establish (1) the rate at which such a system can be made to work, (2) the

quentity of reducing metals transferred to the recovery salt, and the

| completeness to which the reaction can be easily driven. The system--

~which seems to have several useful variations--does, however, look promis-

ing.

It is also clear that, as in the rare earth reduction process,
electrochemical reduétion 6f the protactinium fluorides should be success-
ful. In ﬁhis case, it might seem especially promising if (as now seems

likely) the protactinium is being reduced in the presence of metal to a

‘stable intermetallic compound. Attempts to reduce protactinium electro-

chemically with a variety of metallic electrodes to ascertain (1) the

type end composition of the intermetallic compound, and (2) whether a

- simple'recovery process with;a'solid'electrode'can be achieved are

scheduled for study.

MSBR IN-LINE ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The rapid acquisition of data concerning the compositions of the fuel,
coolant, and cover gas is highly desiréble in the operation of a fluid fuel
reactor. To be of most ﬁalue the data should be representative of the re-
actor at zero time preferably with as little time-delay as possible in
order to evaluate changes in composition'ffom normal conditions and to
take requisite action. This state can only be attained by in-line analy-
sis. Investigastions are under way to‘developinstrumenfation capable of
providing instantaneous data. "It is proposed to devote considereble ef-
fort in this direction as part of the MSBR program. The alternative is to
sample the fuel and coolant.at periodic intervals and remove the sample .
for enalysis at an appropriate analytical laboratory. This procedure is
time-consuming and thereby suffers obviously from a definite time lag in
providing information so that unknown events and information concerning
these events are out of phase.

Although in-line instrumentation is a well-established technique, its
application to molten salt reactors is essentially in its infancy - parti-
cularly in regard to radiation and its effect on maintenance of operating
equipment. The objective is thus to apply the successful in~line techni=-
ques that hawe been used to control many nonradiocactive chemical processes
to control the reactor fuel, coolant, and cover gas.

Helium Cover Gas

Ip addition to the anticipated impurities (atmospheric contaminants,
CFh’ Kr, and Xe) have been found to represent significant contaminants in
the MSRE off-gas system. While it has not yet been possible to measure

hydrocarbons in the MSRE blanket gas, ofganic deposits have seriously
 

 

L4

103

interfered with the operation of the MSRE off-gas system and hydrocarbons

‘in concentrations of severaluhundred.parts per million have been found in

the off-gas from the MSRE pump test loop and in simulated pump lesk ex-
periments. (These experiments indicate that most, if not all, of the
hydrocarbon enters the pump bowl through a mechanical joint which can be
welded iﬁ future models.)  In these tests the total hydrocarbon concen-
tration was measured continuously by a flame ionization detector and the
individual_hjdrocarbons -~ principally light unsaturates -- were identi-
fied by ges chromatography.

Gas chrqmatography is a near perfect technique for automated analysis.
This techniﬁue is now highly devéloped ahd refined, and considerable ex-
perience hasrbeen gained from research in other reactor programs on the

analysis of helium by gas chromatographic techniques. The determination

of perménént gas impurities in molten salt reactot'blanket gases will re-

quire an instrumentrof imprQVed sensitivity thét~is compaiible with
intense radiatibn.. A simple ohrdmatograph has been used to measure ppm
and lower concentratlons of H 2, 2, CHh,_Kr, Xe, and CFh in the off-
gas frcm an MSRE in—p1le test. Thesé contaminants were resolved on a 10X
molecular sieve column and measured w1th a hellum dlscharge detector,

which has the follow1ng llmlts of detectlon.

The defermination of H20 and 002 will require a morelcomplex instru—
ment with multiple columns; probably a three-cplumn instrument will be
required for all ﬁhe above camponents. Also it will be-necessary to eli-
minate all organic materials of construction completely if.extendéd depend-
able operstion is to be obtained with highly radioactive samples. An all-
metal pneumatically actuated sampling vaive is being developed for this
application. This valve will also be operable at high temperaturgs to
minimize the adsorption of traces of méisture.' The effects of hydro-
carbons on the chromatograph has not been tested bu@ will probably require
some modification of the proposed instrument.

Gas chromatography is the most highly developed method for the suto-
matic analysis of hydrocarbon mixtures; however, the resolution of the
complex mixtures anticipated in thg blanket gas requires columns packed

rwith organic substrates, which are not compatible with the highly radio-

active samples. Also, the experience with the pump test loop has indicat-

ed that the continuous_measurement,of,the total concentration of hydro-
carbons would provide adequate information for. reactor operations. These
measureménts, made with a\flame ionization. detector, provided data to dif-
.ferentiaxe between possible locations of lesks; conversely, the complete
analyses were of value only in development studies for the selection of
means of removing the hydrocarbons. The flame ionization detector would

probably nof_be suitable for in-line analysis of the reactor blanket gases

because its operation would inject substantial quantities of air inmto the

off-gas system. An alternate method which will not introduce contaminants
is'being'develoﬁed. VIn this tgchnique the hydrocarbons are oxidized to
carbon dioxide and water with copper oxide, and the thermal conductivity
of the combusted stream is compared with that of the same gas after the

002'and H20are removed by ascarite and magnesium perchlorate. This
method has been tested with a bench top apparatus and found to give a sig-
nal proportional to hydrocarbon concentration over the range of interest
with a limit of detection below 10 ppm. If possible, a similar spparatus
will be tested on the off-gas of the MSRE. |

tinuous monitor of the U(III) concentration in the molten fuel sélt.-' 
Similarly & relatively weak peak at 1000 my in thé absorption spectra of

The effect of the spectra of the various fissidn.ﬁroducts is-not known
primarily becéuse their equilibrium oxidatién-sﬁates'are.not*known with
¢ertaiﬁty. It seems reasonable to assume, however, that little if any ef-
fect ﬁill be 6bserved. Perhaps the most interference will pefrom the
rare earths, probably as soluble fluorides. 'On the basis of experimental
evidence the rare-earth spectra in molten fluoridq salts should present
sharp but insensitive absorption peaks.

Recently a very intense absorption peak at 235 mpu has been found for
U(IV) in LiF-BeF,, melts. Preliminary estimates indicate that this peak
could be used for the in-line measurement of uranium concentrations as
low as 5 to 10 ppm. If no interfering ions are present,‘the-ﬁeak'could be
applied as a sensitive detector of leaks into coolant salt streams and to
meaéure residual uranium in depleted reprocessing streams.

The design of a spectrophotometer to be used in these proposed appli-
cations is rather well defined. Modification of an existing commercial
spectrophotometer, a Cary Model 1L4-H manufactured by Applied Physics
Company , wil; adequately meet the design criteria. In order to eliminate

most of the radiation which is present in the salt sample the optical path-

length of the spectrophotometer will be extended ca. three feet; at the

has been applied to

molten salts successfully. Approximate potentials for observed electrode

reactions for several electroactive species are shown in Fig. 24. Theo-~

metal ions as long as the potential difference is at leasf 0.3 v. The

The three-electrode system also offers significant potentlal as a
technique for in-line monitorihg_qf'uranium in reactor fuels. In MSRE
. type melts at 500°C U(IV) to U(III) reduction waves have beén'found to be
reproducible to beﬁter than 1% in measurements during e twouhour period,
and to about 2 to 3% for intermittent measurements taken over a one-month
period. If the reproduc1b111ty could be 1mproved the technlque could also
be used to_measure trivalent uranium. The\ratlo_of reverse to forward

voltammetric measurement is the precision of definitioﬁ of the area:of the

limit the electrode area by inserting a 20-gauge platinﬁm wire only 5rmm
into the meltsrto limit the_currénts to measurable valﬁes. It is appérent
.that only a small change in melt level will produce a significant error in
electrodeareé. / | |

A new voltammeter is being built that will ﬁeasure twentyfold-higherk'

currents so that an electrode with more repfoducible area can be used.

This instrument also permits faster sweep rates which will minimize theV

effects of stirring in flow cells which will be necessary for process an-
alysis. With these refineménts it is possibie that uranium can be continu-
ously monitored with accufacy_that is comparable to that of hot cell analy-
ses. An alternate method for défining the electrode area is to use an
inéulating sheath. Boron nitride sheaths have been used with some success

but are slowly attacked by the salts. The teéhnique would be greatly

‘simplified if & really compatible insulator were available, and a materials

development program would appear to be merited.

A new phenomena which may offer a combihed electrolytic and gas analy-
sis technique for oxide determination has recently been observed. When
LiF--BeF2 melts are electrolyzed in vacuo at the potential (+ 1.0 v) of an
anodic_wave which has been attributed to the oxidation of o#ide ion, gas
evolution is noted at the indicator electrode. The gas was found to be
predominantly 002 (resulting from the reaction of electrolytic oxygen with

the pyrolytic graphite electrode or the graphite container) with lesser

quantities of CO and 02. If 100% current efficiency can be achieved, a

coulometric method would result. Alternately the evolved gases could be

purged from the electrolytic cell and analyzed ges chromatographically.

Determination of Oxide by Hydrofluorination

The duantitative evolution:of oxide as water by hydrofluorination of

“molten fluéride salt:mixtﬁres has been successfully applied to the deter-

mination of oxide in the highly radioactive MSRE fuel samples. The sampl-

ing ladle, contéining about 50 g;Of salt, is sealed in = nickel hydro-
fluorinator with a delivery tube spring-loaded sgainst the surface of the
salt."After7the'system is pﬁrged at 300°C with a hydrofluorinating gas

mixture of anhydrous HF in hydrogen, the salt is melted, the delivery tube

 
 

 

 

 

11k

is driven beneath the surface of the salt, and the melt is pﬁrged with |
hydrofluorinating gas mixture, the oxide being-evolved as water. ' The ef-
fluent from the hydrofluorinator is paséed through a sodium‘fiuoride
column at 70°C to remove the HF, and the water in a fractioh of thié‘gas
stream is measured with the cell of an electrolytic moisture monitor. The
integrated signal from the moisture monitorlcell is proportional to the
concentfation of oxide in the sample.‘-The water is efolved éuite rapidly
with anaelyses essentially complete within aboutl30 minutes after the salt
is melted. Most of this time is consumed in purging the water ffam the
sodium fluoride trap and in "drying down" thé cell. |

The components required to carry out this determination in the hot
cell are shown in Figs. 25 and 26. Figure 25 shows from left to right:
the sampliﬁg ladle; a nickel liner, which protects the hydrofluorinator
bottom; the hydrofluorinator top, with its replaceable delivery tip and
baffles to retain the salt in the liner; the hydrofluorinator bottom and
a clamping yoke to seal the hydrofluorinator via a Teflon O-ring. Figure
26 shows the assembled hydrofluorinator in the furnace on the right con-
nected with a pneumstically actuated coupler to the compértmentrwhich_
contains the sodium fluoride column, the moisture cell, a capillary gas
stream splitter and the necessary valving and connections. |

At the reactor startup samples of flush salt and fuel were analyzed
by both the hydrofluorination and KBth methods with satisfactory agree-
ment. The KBth results were positively biased by abéut 20 ppm ﬁhich is
readily explained by atmospheric contamination of the pulverized salt.
Since the reactor has been operating at power the results of the éamples

analyzed have fallen in the renge of 50 + 5 ppm.

The hydroflueridatdon method should be equally applicsble to the
analysis of MSBR samples, as no interference is anticipated from thorium.
Because the reaction is rapdd and quantitative it offers promise for ap-
plication to process analysis and might also be combined with a determi-
nation of reducing power. The reactions involved in the process determi-

nation are as follows:

and '
UFy + HF 2 UF) + 1/2 Bt (2)
or M° + nHF 2 MF_+ n/2 Ht , | (3)

with evolved water and hydrogen measured.

Application of reaction (1) could be carried out by either of two
techniques. In the simplest approach the molten salt would be subjected
to a single-stage equilibration with HF in.a hydrogen or helium carrier
and the oxide computed from known equilibrium constants. This approach is
subject to several problems; the most serious of which is.that activities
of oxide rather than concentrations are measured. Thus precipitated

oxides are not determined. Also, it would be necessary to maintain accu-

rate;temperature control because equilibrium constants of the reaction

are relatifely dependent on_temperature} An slternate approach which

would circumvent the sbove problem but would requlre a more complex ap-

rparatus is to equlllbrate a8 constant stream of the fuel with a counter-

" current flow of - hydrofluorinatlng gas. By proper selection of parameters

(HF concentratlon temperature contractor des1gn and flow rates) it is
theoretlcally poss1ble to approach quantltatlve removal of oxide from the

effluent salt so that a steady state is reached in which the water evolved

 
 

118 b

is equivalent to the oxide introduced in the salt stream. Rate constants
for hydrofluorination are not available.
Thorium and Protactinium

All of the experimental work on the proposed methods has been carried
out on MSRE type salts but should also provide adequate analyses for the
MSBR fuel. In the analysis of the MSBR blanket the presence of thorium |
and protactinium must also be considered. A§ this time the in-line analy-
sis of.fhorium does not appear essential to the operation of the reactor --
&8 possible exception is the monitoring of thorium in the core to detect
leaks between the blanket and thg éore; Also, on the basis of its spectro-
photometric, electrical and therﬁédynamic properties, thorium is #ot ex—
pected to interfere significantly ﬁith any of the proposed methods. The
in-line analysis of protactinium must be coﬁsidered as a priority determi-
nation because the concentration of protactinium must be maintained at a
low level in the blanket for efficient breeding. In the sbsence of.ei- | ‘
perimental data, the spectrophotometric method appears to offer the most
profitable avenue of investigation. ,;
Reprocessing System |

Monitoring of the continuous fuel reprocessing system will probably
be of even more 1mportance than the monitoring of the main reactor ;ystem,
because the compositions of the reprocessing streams are more subject to
rapid operational control. Moreover, the reprocessing system offers
several avenues for the temporary or permanent loss of fissipngble
material. Salt streams which will require continuous measurement of trace
concentrations of uranium include the effluents from fluorinators of the

fuel and blanket reprocessing streams. Part of the residual uranjum in \EJ
 

of

119

either of these streams is subject to permanent loss either in the still
bottoms of the fuel Sysﬁem or in the ﬁaste of the blanket fission product
disposal.. The in—line analysis of major concenfrations of uranium in the
meke-up stream frqm.the recombiner will also be required for inventory
control. With the possible exception of a change in the concentration and/
or nature of the corrosion products the techniqueé that are developed for
the analysis of reactor salts should be edually applicable to the reproces-
sing systém;

| Gaseous effluents streams from thé UF cold traps and the recombiner
systém could introduce temporary losses via transfer of uranium to the off-
gas.syStem and will reqﬁire in-line analysis for trace concentrations.

Gas streams that contain major concentrations of UF6 (e.g., effluents from
the fluorinators) can probably be adequately monitdred by ultraviolet
spectrophotometers, bﬁt no coﬁpletely satisfactofy methﬁds,have yet been
found for the in-line analysis of trace concentrations of uranium in gas
streams. OSeveral techniques are being considered to monitor the Fluid

Bed Volatilify Pilot Plant, and any mefhods developed should be ideally

suited for the MSBR reprocessing system.

PROPOSED PROGRAM OF CHEMICAL DEVELOPMENT

The chemical status of molten fluorides as reactor materials, present-
ed in some detail in preceding sections, indicates strongly that thermal
breeders based upon these materials are feasible. The discussion<aﬁove,
however, points out several problem areas that remain and numerous speci-
fic details that require examination and experimental-invesfigation. A
brief summéxy'of these areas and specific plans for the necessary studies
islpresented under the several headings below. An estimate of the manpower
and money required, over the next 87years, to accomplish these research
and development activities is presented as Table 1T.

It is axiomatic that the course of researcﬁ and development activities
is seldom smooth and is difficult to predict in detail for a long period.
Researches lead to valuable findings that can be exploited, and unsuspect-
ed problems arise and require additional efforts for their solution. It
is very unlikely, therefore, that this budget breakdown will pfove accurate
in detail, but the overall sums and manpower, year by year, should be suf-
ficient for the purpose.

Phase Equilibrium Studies

Equilibrium phase behavior of the proposed fuel and blanket systems
is relatively well established. A careful and detailed examination, using
all the most advanced techniques, should be made of the region close to
the proposed compositions in the fuel and, especially, in the blanket
system. In addition, the join from the LiF—UFh eutectic, through the fuei
composition, to the barren fuel solvent will require some examination.
None of these studies is urgently needed in the next year or fwo. Be-

end hydroxides in LiFfBeFQ-ThFh systems &t and near the blanket compo-
sition. A study of distribution of uranium and thorium between the antici-
pated (U'--Th)O2 solid solution and the molten fluoride phase as a function
of temperature and melt composition will follow. Extension of this study
to include equilibrium distribution of protactinium will also be done if
oxide processes for this element still appear attractive. It is expected
that & 2-man effort can answer, during the next three years, the urgent
questions that affect fuel and blanket production techniques and system
cleanliness requirements. Minor questions and careful refinement of some
of the data are expected to justify a continuing effort at a slower pace
thereafter; |
Solution Thermodynamics

We feel a distinct need for more information about thermodynamics of
many possible fission product or corrosion product species in dilute solu~
tion in fluoride melts. We need to augment‘the program now under way
which attempts to obtain this data by EMF measurements and by direct
measurements of chemical équilibria. The following several items would be
acéorded’nearly_equal priority:

EMF Study of M/MF_Electrodes

 

Experiments using metal/metal fluoride electrodes with reference
, | - + :
electrodes such as Be/Be2 or,H2, HF/PA will attempt to determine the
identity, solubility, and thermodynamic stability of lower valence fluo-

rides of such elements as niobium; molybdenﬁm, ruthenium, technetium, and

copper in LiF-BeF2 melts. The priority order for these elements is prob-

ably the order listed. The method should also be used, as opportunity

 
 

 

Lttt 1§ e a1 82 007 0 Bt e AR SR s S e i

124

permits, to firm our present values for the fluorides of iron, chromium,
and nickel. Such studies should prove of real value in (1) decisions as

to suitability of improved container metals (such as niobium) and (2)

-evaluation of possible fission prodﬁct species and behavior. These EMF

studies would, at least in the initial stageé, be coupled with measure-
ments of equilibria such as
Nb + XHF 2 Nbe + X/2 H2.
Thermodynamics of Rare-Earth Fluorides

We hope to measure AGf and AHf for crystalline rare-earth trifluoridesi

These data are badly needed in order to calculate AGf values for the dis-
solved salts from solubility data.

Electrochemical Deposition Studies

Liquid bismuth solutions of niobium, molybdenum, ruthehium, and

technetium will be studied (1) to investigate the feasibility of electro-
chemical deposition and (2) to determine activity coefficients of metal
solutes in the liquid bismuth. These studies also could support present
studies of chemical reduction of rare earths (and Pa) into Bi, by_demon-

strating electrochemical reduction of the same ions.

Activities of LiF and BeF2

should be extended over a wider temperature interval and composition range
to confirm, improve, and extend our knowledge of thé’thermodynamics of the

LiF-BeF, system. [If a suitsble Th® | ThF) electrode can be demonstrated,

2
a similar study in the LiF-ThF) and LiF;-Ber;-ThFh systems will be made. ]

Other Studies

As time permits and the need requires we would attempt (1) study of
reaction equilibria involving BF3 (especiglly with structural metal ele-
ments and alloys) in mixtures of interest as coolants, and (2) continued
study of the reaction

oHF + 5°~ 2 H,S + H,.
Physical Properties

We believe it unlikely that the physical property values listed in
this_docUment for fhe fuel, the blanket, and the.several-coolants are in
error sufficient to cause rejection of the fluid. Howe;er, the state of
knowledgé of physical and heat transfer properties of these fluids is un-
satisfactory, and a considerable effort will be required to establish the
values with precision. - |

Vapor preééures need—to be evaluated for the several mixtures
(throughdecompositiop'pressurés of the BFbeaSed coolants will be estab-
lished with their'phase.behévior);Z'Since_the Valﬁes are known to be low,
these meaéurements d6 not pgguég deserve a high priority, but studies with
the'fﬁel'should be included ear1y sihce they will essist with the distil-
iatibﬁ sfﬁdies._- |

Density, ¢oefficiént'ofithérmal-exPansion, and viscosity data will be

required to confirm the prééént"eétimates. .Specific heat and heat of

 
 

 

 

126

fusion values are also needed. All these values will, if sufficientlyr
high accuracy can be achieved and if & sufficient concentration range is
covered, be helpful in checking'presentmethéds for estimating the proper-
ties and will be usefu; in attempts to f@rmulate a consistent theory of
high température liquids.

Surface tension measurements of fhe several salts, and theirrélose
compositional relatives, should be eétablished during the next two years
as time and resources permit. | |

fhermal conductivity is the property that is most difficult to
measure for molten salts (as for other.liquids), and the one for which‘a-
vailable information is most insufficient. A program for measurement of
this property for fuel, blanket, and any of‘the materials likely to be
chosen as coolant is urgently required. Thermal conductivity of liquids
can be estimated with some precisiqn if the velocity of sound in the liquid
is known; measurements of sonic velocity in the molten salt mixtu:es
should, therefore, be undertaken as a reasonable backup effort.

Radiation Effects and Fission Product Behavior

These two items promise to be the most demanding, and the most ex-
pensive, in the list of necessary chemical ﬁevelopment activities. No ad-
verse effects of radiation upon the fuels, the‘moderator, or the compati-
bility of the fuel-graphite-metal system have beep observed. Howevef, no
realistic tests of these combinations have been made at power densities
so high as those proposed for MSBR. Studies presently under wey, and radi-
ation facilities presently available, should_by early FY 1968 permit long-
term tests to high fuel burnup at power densities in the 300_kw/lit¢r

range. Such studies are done in in-pile thermal convection loops. which
 

 

he

 

127

expose & very high fraction of the totai fuel to the highest flux; the as-
sembly is equipped so-thaﬁ samples of gas can be taken at will, samples of
fuel can be withdrawn, and samples.of enriched fuel can be added as desir-
ed. These tests will be valuable both in assessment of possible radiation
damage problems and in evaluation of fission product behavior.

We are convinced that'exposures at.even higher power densities (up at
least to 1000 Kw/liter) are necessary in this program end we will attempt
to design and operate suchrfacilities. Success in this venture would per-
mit not only an accelerated tést program for the nuﬁerous possible problem
areas but would also safely assess such reactor accident possibilities as
blocked flow channels, pUmp'stoppages, etc. We hope that such tests can

be conducted at the Oak Ridge Research Reactor in loops cooled by thermal

convection, and the considerable sums budgeted for the effort are predi-

cated on that hope. If the studies must be done elsewhere, or if forced
convectionfloops (with.the,attendant punp development problem) must be
used, then fhe estimatés of stgff and funding required are‘certainly too
low. |

With careful analysis of off-gases fram such systems and rapid radio-

,chemical analysis cf.fuelsaﬁplés,ve'éhould'get definitive data on

, fission’broduct'behaviorat'trulyrealistic~concentrations and production
crates; Careful checks of graphite and metal frcm such tests immediately

rafter termination of the run should afford realistic data on distribution

of flssion products in these materlals.

Radlation levels,'fram gamma;rays;and-frOm.the delayed neutrons, in
the coolant mixturecare;~clearly, much lower than those for the fuel, but’

radiation damage to the BFB-based'coolants.is not necessarily a trivial

 
 

 

 

 

128

m&tter. When such a coolant mixture is eSt&blished,as to phase behavior,
heat transfer capability, and compatibility, it shogld be givén.a long-
term test at higher-than-realistic radiatién levels to‘see whether such
damage is a possibility.

Fission Product Sgpérations

The distillation process is, at present, the expécted technique for
reprocessing of the fuel mixture, and development activities associated
with that process are described in another report in this series. A small
effort on vapor-liquid equilibria in direct suppoft of that development |
“will continue, as needed, as a portion of the present program.

Highest priority will, for the present, bé devoted to the study of
reduction of rare-earth fluorides from L:'LF--Be.F2 mixtures intq dilute salloys
of the rare-earth metals in bismuth, or into stable intermetallic compounds
of other types. These studies can be carried by mid-1968 to a point where
a sound evaluation of their potential can be made. If the process shows
promise, it will be useful to examine electrochemical vs chemical tech-
niques for its prosecution, and it msy prove necessary to investigate means
of recovery of lithium from the rare earth-bismuth alloy.

The search for insolﬁble compounds which are stable toward the molten
fuel and which are capsable of ion exchange reactions with rare-earth cat;
ions in the fuel mixture will be continuéd. Attempts will be made to use
Zr02 doped with traces of rare-earth oxides, uranium carbide dopéd with
rare-earch carbide, and other refractory compounds, as well as any promis-

solution becomes aveilsble. Should nicbium or moiybdenum, for example, be
shown to exist in the fuel mixture as‘-a fluoride, their removal by chemical
or electrochemical means will be attempted.
Study of the,equilibrium
HF + I -+ HI + F_

will be continued and extended to'include effects of melt composition and

temperature. This technlque may prove valuable in removing a major frac-

tion of xenon precursors on a short time cycle end may minimize require-
ments for impermeability_of the graphite'moderator and core structure. If
these studies continue to:aPPEar'prdmising,‘they should be extended to ine
clude possibie removal'of'tellurium7by'volatilization of H2Te.
Protactinium'Chemistry |

The.surprising fact tnat protactinium as fluoride is removed from
very dilute solutions in LiF-BeF,-ThF) by reduction with thorium metal (or
with moderately stable intermetallic.compounds of thorium) represents a
breakthrough which must be exploited. Accordingly, first priority will be
given to continued and increased study of this reaction. Primary attention
must be paid to determination of the ultlmate state of the protactlnlum, it

is- presently believed to be a stable 1ntermetallic compound. Success in

'this venture should permlt systematic study of means for recovery of the
”'element. Technlques which Wlll be applied at both tracer (ppb) and real-
:istlc (ppm) concentrations will 1nclude electrochemlcal reductlons with a

";varlety of metal electrodes, and chemical reductions in the presence of

: selected metallic constltuents._'

The process by whlch protactinium'is precipitated'by an excess of

> will continue to be examined. Attempts will be made to estab~
lish that passage of the melt through beds of oxide (ZrO2 will be included)

Be0 or ThO

will remove the protactinium without reaction with other constituents. If
this is true, as previous tests have strongly suggested, a:careful study
~of the effect of extraneous ions, of the behavior of uranium, and of the
extent of contamination of thé melt by oxide and hydroxide ion will be made.

Mefhods for recovery of the protactiniumxor of the
whichever of these processes.séems promising will be undertaken as soon as
an understanding of the removal mechanism permits. |

Development of Continuocus Production Methods

As the discussion of production téchnology.above makes clear, the
present production methods have been adequate for materials for MSRE; ﬁhe
fuel, coolapt, and flush salt were furnished in a high and completely
satisfactory state of purity. It seems very likely that the present unit
processes will serve to prepare MSBR fuel and (perhaps with minor modifi-
cations) blanket. However, the 25,000 1b of material for MSRE required
nearly a year to prepare in the existing batch processing facilities, and
provision of a considerably larger quantity for an MSBR would be gquite un-
economical if this equipment were used.

The purification process is quite a simple one. It seems ceitain
that it can be engineered into a continuous process with the throughput per
unit of time and manpower much greater thaﬁ that of the present batchroper—
ation. The relatively smallldevelopment effort adjudged necesséry for this

conversion is scheduled so that the finished plant could be available for

run-in on large quentities of salt needed in the engineering-scale tests.

Chemical Services

Under this heading are lumped the many and diverse ways in which the
molten salt chemists perform services in direct support of other portions
of the development effort. These ways range from (1) examinstion and
identification (as by the optical microscope) of deposits found in engi-
neeriné.test loops, (2) determination of permesbility of graphite specimens,
(3) in-place hydrofluorination of batches of salt before reuse in test
equipment, (4) manufacture of small batches of special salt compositions
for corrosion or physical property tests, and (5’ liaison emong the engi-
neers, reactor.operators, hot-cell operators, and enalytical chemists so
that the many specisal samples receive proper handling and data from them
are reasonsably interpreted..

It is difficult to specify, long in advance, the details of such
services, but many years' experience encourages us in the belief that the
suggested level will be needed.

Analyticel Development

In order to apply in-line analytical techniques to the MSBR, con-
siderable preliminary.information and_data.mnst,be gatheredtso that a
sound evaluation of possible successful reactor,applicationé can be made.
This approach will.permit g'quiﬁumjshift of effort to those concepts that
appear to be most~ffﬁiﬁfﬁl._Fof}eiaﬁﬁle;,ﬁhe.expériencegained in the
analyéis of hydrocarbons inthefMSRE'offégaé,is being used now in the de-

order of priority.

I. 8. Construct a lsboratory facility which will piovide s flowing
salt stream, probably driven by & gas 1lift. Provision will be made for the
addition of contaminants to the salt inclﬁding oxide, sampling, capability
for hydrofluorination and electréiytic treatment of the salt. This facili-
ty will be used to provide tests of eléctrdchemical methods for uranium and
corrosion products and for measuring'the electrochemical potential of the
salt vs a standard reference cell. | |

b. Initiate investigation of a countercurrent equilibration
methpd for the determination of oxide by hydrofluorination.

c. Accurately determine reproduc{bility of operation of spectro-
photometric cell for future application to determination of uranium and

protactinium.

Ny}

ITI. Continue basic inves?igations of electrode-précesses to observe
if chromium, oxide, and trivalent uranium can be determined in this manner.
III. Investigate materials as insulators for reference electrode.

IV. Conduct in-pile testing of any in-line techniques which prove
successful in Section I. '

V. Develop gas chromatographic analyses compatible with high activi-
ty. Includes radiation testing of packing materials, testing solid ad-
sorbents for hydrocarbons. Development of all metal valving. Testing ef-
fect of radiation on detectors.

VI. Investigation of alternate continuous methods of in-iine gas

‘analysis, e.g., thermal conductivity, referencing gas after chemical sepa-

"ration to original gas stream.
