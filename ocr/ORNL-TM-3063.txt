AN EVALUATION OF THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
HASTELLOY N SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS — FOURTH GROUP

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

- ABSTRACT

 

Two heats of standard Hastelloy N were removed from the
core of the MSRE after 22,533 hr at 650°C and exposed to a
thermal fluence of 1.5 X 1021 neutrons/cm? and a fast fluence
> 50 kev of 1.1 X 10%! neutrons/cm®. The mechanical proper-
ties have systematically deteriorated with increasing fluence.
However, the change in ropertles is due to the helium
produced by the 1 B(n,x)”1Li transmutation and can be reduced
- by changes in chemical composition. Some of these modified
heats have been exposed to the core of the MSRE and show
improved resistance to irradiation.

The corrosion of the Hastelloy N has been largely due to
the selective removal of chromium. The rates of removal are
much as predicted from the measured diffusion rate of chromium.
Other superficial structure modifications have been observed,
but ‘they likely result from carbide precipitation along slip
bands that were formed during machining.

 

INTRODUCTION

The Molten~Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a single region reac-
tor that is fueled by a molten fluoride salt (65 LiF—29.1 BeFo—5 ZrF,—
0.9 UF;, mole %), moderated by unclad graphite, and contained by

- Hastelloy N (Ni~16 Mo-7 Cr—4 Fe-0.05 C, wt %). The details of the reac-

tor design and constructidniban_be'fbund elsewhere.® We knew that the

neutron environment would produce some changes in the two structural mate-

- rials - graphlte and Hastelloy N. Although we were very confldent of
~ the compatiblllty of these materlals with the fluoride salt,'we needed

to keep abreast'ofrthe_p9581ble;development of-corros1on.problems within

the reactor itself. For these reasons, we developed a surveillance

(

program that would allow us to follow the property changes of graphite

S0
v

and Hastelloy N specimens as the reactor operated.

O

The reactor went critical on June 1, 1965. After many small prob-
lems were solved, normal operation began in May 1966. We removed four
groups of surveillance samples. The results of tests on the first three
groups were reported.2_4 This report deals primarily with the results
of tests on samples removed with the fourth group. The fourth group
included two heats of standard Hastelloy N used in fabricating the MSRE
and three heats with modified chemistry that had better mechanical proper-
ties after irradiation and appear attractive for use in future molten-
salt reactors. The respective history of each lot was (1) standard
Hastelloy N, annealed 2 hr at 900°C and exposed to the MSRE core for
22,533 hr at 650°C to a thermal fluence of 1.5 X 1022 neutrons/cm?,

(2) two heats of modified Hastelloy N, annealed 1 hr at 1177°C and exposed
to the MSRE core for 7244 hr at 650°C to & thermal fluence of 5.1 x 1022
neutrons/cm?, and (3) a single heat of modified Hastelloy N, annealed 3
for 1 hr at 1177°C and exposed to the MSRE cell enviromment of N, + 2 to e
5% 0, for 17,033 hr at 650°C to a thermal fluence of 2.5 X 101°
neutrons/cm?. The results of tests on these materials will be presented
in detail, and some comparisons will be made with the data from the

groups removed previously.

are arranged in three stringers. Each stringer is about 62 in. long
and consists of two Hastelloy N rods and a graphite section made up of
various pieces that are joined by pinning and tongue-and-groove joints.
The Hastelloy N rod has periodic-reduced sections 1 1/8 in. long by
1/8 in. in diameter and can be cut into small tensile specimens after it
is removed from the reactor. Three stringers are joined together so
that they can be separated in a hot cell and reassembled with one or
more new stringers for reinsertion into the reactor. The assembled
stringers fit into a perforated Hastelloy N basket that is inserted into
an axial position about 3.6 in. from the core center line.

A control facility is associated with the surveillance program.
It utilizes a "fuel salt" containing depleted uranium in a static pot
that is heated electrically. The temperature is controlled by the MSRE
computer so that the temperature matches that of the reactor. Thus,
these specimens are ekposed to conditions similar to those in the reac-
tor except for the static salt and the absence of a neutron flux.

There is another surveillance facility for-Hastelloy N located
outside the core in a vertical position about 4.5 in. from the vessel.

These specimens are exposed to the cell enviromment of N> + 2 to 5% O,.

Materials

The compositions of the two heats of standard Hastelloy N are given
in Table 1. These heats were air melted by the Stellite Division of
Union Carbide Corporation. Heat 5085 was used for making the cylindrical

portion of the reactor VéSSél'and heat 5065 was used for forming the top

~and bottom heads. These materialS'wefe given a mill anneal of 1 hr at

1177°C and a final anneal of 2 hr at 900°C atxORNL after fabrication.

The chemical compositions of the three modified alloys are given

 in Table 1. The modifications in composition were made principally to

imprové the alloy's,resiStanéejtdnradiation demage and to bring about

-general improvements in the fabricability, weldability, and ductility.®

Alloys 67-551 and 67-504 were small, 100-1b heats made by the Stellite
Division of Union Carbide Corporation by vacuum melting. They were
finished to 1/2 in. plate by working at 870°C. We cut strips 1/2 in. by
1/2 in. from the plates and swaged them to 1/4-in.-dism rod. Two sec-
tions of rod were welded together to make 62-in.-long rods for fabri-
cating the samples. The rods were annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C in argon
and then the reduced sections were machined. Heat 7320 was a 5000-1b
melt made by the Materials Systems Division of Union Carbide Corporation.
' Part of the heat was fabricated by the vendor to 5/16-in.-diam rod and .
was sinterless ground to obtain the needed 1/4 in. stock.k The material

was annealed 1 hr at 1177°C and then the reduced sections were machined.

Test Specimens

The surveillance rods inside the core are 62 in. long and those
outside the vessel are 84 in. long. They both are 1/4 in. in diameter
with reduced sections 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in. long. After
removal from the reactor, ﬁhé rods are sawed into small mechanical prop-
erty specimens having a gage section 1/8 in. in diemeter by 1 1/8 in.
long.

The first rods were machined as segments and then welded together,
but we described previously an improved technique in which we use a
milling cutter to machineAthe_reduced sections in the rod.? This tech-
nique is Quicker, cheaper, and requires less handling of the relatively
fragile rods than the previous method of making the rods into segments.
The standard Hastelloy N rods were machined and welded together and the

modified alloys were prepared by milling.

IRRADTATION CONDITIONS

The jrradiation conditions for the various groups of surveillance
specimens that have been removed are sumarized in Table 2. The reac-
tor operated from June 1965 until March 1968 with a single change of
fuel salt in which there was a 33% enrichment of 235U. After this
period of operation the uranium in the fuel was'stripped'by Tluorination
and replaced with 233y (ref,m7). This charge of salt was used until the

present group of samples was removed. Referring again to Table 2, the

standard Hastelloy N in the core was exposed to both salts and the modi-

fied Hastelloy N in the core was exposed only to the 1atter salt. The

same salt has been used_ln_thg control facility throughout operation.

The specimens outside the core (designated "vessel" specimens)

 were'exposed to the cell envifonment of N» + 2 to 5% 0s.

Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests of unirradiated control speci-
mens were run in conventional creep machines of the dead-load and lever-
arm types. The strain was measured by a dial indicator that showed the
total movement of the specimen and part of the load train. The zero
strain measurement was taken immediately after the load was applied.

The temperature accuracy was +0.75%, the guaranteed accuracy of the
Chromel-P—-Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run in lever-arm
machines that were located in hot cells. The strain was measured by an
eXtensometer‘with rods attached to the upper and lower specimen grips.
The relative movement of these two rods was measured by a linear differ-
ential transformer, and the transformer signal was recorded. The
accuracy of the strain measurement is difficult to determine. The exten-
someter (mechanical and electrical portions) produced measurements that
could be read to about *0.02% strainj however, other factors (tempera-
ture changes in the cell, mechanical vibrations, etc.) probably combine
to give an overall accuracy of +0.1% strain. This is considerably better
than the specimen-to-specimen reproducibility that one would expect for
relatively brittle materials. The temperature measuring and control
system was the same as that used in the laboratory with only one excep-
tion. In the laboratory, the ccntrol system was stabilized et the
desired temperature by use of a recorder with an expanded scale. In the
tests in the hot cells, the control point was established by settlng the

controller Wlthout the ald of the expanded-scale recorder. This error

_'and the thermocouple accuracy combine to give a temperature uncertainty

of about *1%.-
The ten31le tests were run on Instron Universal Testlng Machines.

The strain measurements were’ taken from the crosshead travel and gener-

. _ally are accurate to *2% straln.

The test environment was air in all cases. Metallegrepnic examina-

tion showed that the depth of oxldat;on was small, and we feel that the

environment did not sppreciasbly influence the test results.

 
 

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Visual and Metallographic Examination J _ e

W. H. Cook was in charge of the disassembly of the core surveil-
lance fixture. As shown in Fig. 1, the assembly was in excellent mechan-
-ical condition when removed. The Hastelloy N samples were more
discolored than noted previously; however, surface marking such as
numbers were readily visible. The detailed appearance of the stringer
has been described previously by Cook.® The Hastelloy N surveillance
rods located outside the core were oxidized, but the oxide was tenacious.

Metallographic examination of the Hastelloy N straps that held the
graphite and metal together revealed intergranular cracks. A typical

crack is shown in Fig. 2 and extends to a depth of about 3 mils. A
similar strap on the modified samples which had been in the reactor for
7244 hr had cracks to a deﬁth of about 1.5 mils. These straps are about
0.020 in. thick and they likely encountered some deformation while being
removed. However, the cracks were quite uniformly spaced on both sur-
faces of the straps, and their genefal gppearance attests to a general
corrosion that rendered the grain boundaries extremely brittle. Examina-
‘tion of unirradiated control straps failed to reveal a similar type of

cracking.

such a thin film. The etched view in Fig. 3(b) reveals some carbide
prec1p1tat10n near the surface and grain boundaries that are generally
lined with carbides. Heat 5085 was exposed an identical time and
typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 4. The unetched view in
Fig. 4(a) shows a modified grain boundary structure to a depthiof about
2 mils. Etching [Fig. 4(b)] reveals a grain boundary network of car-
bides. The grain boundaries near the surface seem to etch differently
from the rest of the sample, but little more can be said.

We interpreted these observétions as being indicative of some cor-

rosion and performed one further crude experiment to reveal the depth of

this attack. One tensile sample had been cut too short for testing, and

we bent the remaining portion in a vise. The sample was then sectioned
and examined metallographically; the resulting photomicrographs are shown
in Fig. 5. The tension side cracked to a depth of about 4 mils whereas
the compression side did not crack. Both-sides etched abnormally to a
depth of about 4 mils. | |

' Samples of heats 5065 and 5085 that were exposed to the static bar-
ren salt in the control fac111ty'were examined. Figure 6 shows'typical
photomlcrographs of heat 5065 after exposure for 22,533 hr. There is
some surface roughening, but no structure modification near the surface

such as that shown in Fig. 3 for the sample from the reactor. Likewise,

" heat 5085 (Fig. 7) showed some surface effects that were minor compared

with its irradiated counterpart in Fig. 4.
Thus, there is little doubt that the samples in the core experienced
some modifications, apparently to a depth of 3 to 4 mils. This alters

up to about 12% of the sample cross section and can be expected to influ-
ence the mechanical properties;“ We shall dwell fUrther on thls very

bles and dislocations were present.

MEchanical-Pfoperty Data — Standard Hastelloy N

Two heats of standard Hastelloy N were exposed to the MSRE core
environment for 22,533 hr at 650°C and received a thermal neutron fluence
of 1.5 x 10?1 neutrons/em®. Similar control samples were exposed to
static barren fuel salt for a corresponding length of time. The results
of tensile tests on heat 5085 are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 for |
unirradiated and irradiated samples, respectively. The fracture strains
are shdwn as a function of test temperature in Fig. 9. With increasing
temperature the unirradiated samples exhibit first an increase in frac-

ture strain, then a sharp decrease, and then an increase. The irra-

diated samples followrthe same general pattern except for the absence

of a ductility increase at high temperatures. However, the levels of
the fracture strains are lower for the irradiated material over the
entire temperature range. For both materials the fracture strain
decreases with decreasing strain rate. Another difference in behavior
between the irradiasted and unirradiated samples is that at the highest
strain rate (0.05 min~!) the fracture strain begins its precipitious drop
at a lower temperature for the irradiated material.

Further characteristics of the effects of irradiation on the ten-
sile properties of heat 5085 are apparent when the ratios of the irra-
diated and unirradisted properties are compared (Fig. 10). The yield
stress is from 10 to 20% higher for the irradiated material at test tem-
peratures up to 760°C. The ultimate tensile stress is about 20% lower
for the irradiated material and drops even further as the test tempera-
ture is increased above 500°C. The fracture strains of the irradiated
samples are about 50% of those of the unirradiated samples up to about

500°C, above which the reduction is even greater.

The results of tensile tests on the samples of heat 5065 are sum-
marized in Tables 5 and 6. The fracture strains of these samples are
shown in Fig. 11 as a function of test temperature. The results are
quite similar to those shown in Fig. 9 for heat 5085. A notable excep-
tion is the much higher fracture strains at low temperatures of heat 5065
after irradiation. The ratios of the irradiated and unirradiated ten-
sile properties are shown in Fig. 12. The yield stress was not altered
appreciably by irradiation. The ultimate tensile stress was decreased
about 10% by irradiation at low test temperatures and up to 35% at high
temperatures. Similerly, the fracture strain was reduced about 10% at
low temperatures, and this reduction progressed to about 85% at high
test temperatures.

The progressive change in the fracture strain'with increasing
fluence is illustrated in Fig. 13 for heat 5085. The fracture strain
has been reduced over the entire range of test temperatures investigated.
A similar trend was noted at a slower strain rate of 0.002 min~1
(Fig. 14), although the absolute values of the fracture strains were
lower than noted in Fig. 13 at the higher strain rate of 0.05 min~!.
These samples have experienced various holding times at 650°C and some
of the property changes can be attributed to thermal aging. The frac-
ture strains for several sets of control semples of heat 5085 are com-
pared in Fig. 15. At low test temperatures and at 760°C and above the
fracture strain seems to show a progressive decrease with increasing
holding time at 650°C. At intermediate temperstures the behavior is
more complex. At a test temperature of 650°C, the results indicate a
progressive decrease in fracture strain up to an exposure time of
A15,289 hr and then an increase with further aging time. |

Heat 5065 was not included in one set of surveillance samples, but
there are sufficient daté to follow the property changes with fluence
and aging time at 650°C. The fracture strain is shown in Fig. 16 as a
function of temperature for various fluences. At low test temperatures,
excluding the one'apparently anomalous point, the fracture strain was |
actually higher for irradiation to fluences of 1.3 and 2.6 X 101°
neutrons /cm?. Higher fluences reduced the fracture strain at low test
temperatures, but not to values as low &s noted in Fig. 13 for heat 5085.

At test temperatures above 550°C the fracture strain decreases progres-
sively with increasing fluence. As shown in Fig. 17 some of these
changes in fracture strain can be attributed to thermal aging at 650°C.
Except at test temperatures above 750°C, the fracture strain is lowest
for the material aged 15,289 hr and is improved after aging 22,533 hr.
The changes in properties at low test temperatures are less than those
for heat 5085 (Fig. 15).

As d1scussed prev1ous1y in thls series of reports, the changes in
fracture strain at low temperatures were not expected. Although the
fracture stralns have not reached values below 20%, we are still 1nter-
ested in its progress1on Our experlence to date is summarized in

F1g._18. If the noted effects were due simply to thermal aging, then

" the results should correlate with the time at 650°C. Obviously such a

The higher susceptibil-

ity of heat 5085 to this type of embrittlement is not understood, since
heat 5065 actually has a higher carbon concentration (Table 1, p. 4).
The data in Fig. 18 defy extrapolation, so one cannot conclude whether

the room temperature embrittlement is likely to become worse.

‘In these discussions of tensile properties we have emphasized the

changes in fracture strain and made little mention of strength changes.

Some pertinent data are summarized in Table 7 for heat 5085. The sam-
ples were tested at 25 and 650°C and include thrée histbries: (1) as
annealed, (2) thermally aged, and (3) irradiated. The changes in yield
strength are likely significant, but the main point is that they are

The minimum creep rates are shown as & function of stress in
Fig. 20 for heat 5085. As noted previously, neither irradiation nor

aging has a detectable effect on the creep rate. The data deviate from

- the line shown in Fig. 20 atfboth extremes. At high stresses, the irra-

diated samples fail at such low Strains that a minimum creep rate is not

 established over‘long‘éﬁough'pefiod for measurement. At low stress

The fracture strain is the parameter_most affected by irradiation,

" and a variation of this parameter with minimum creep rate is shown in

tion of the fracture strain with increasing thermal fluence.

in the two types of tests. The most striking feature is.the marked

dependence of the fracture strain of the irradiated samples on the strain

rate and the rather weak dependerice of the fracture strains of the

unirradiated samples on the strain rate.

The irradiated samples at this

high fluence level show a general decrease in fracture strain»with
decreasing strain rate, with a possible slight increase in fracture
strain at very low strain rates.

The sensitivity of the fracture strain of heat 5085 at 650°C to
the helium content is illustrated in Fig. 23 for three strain rates.
This material contains 38 ppm B (Table 1, p. 4) that can yield an equiv-
alent amount of helium when transmuted. (Several factors contribute to
the relationship that 1 ppm of natural boron by weight leads to
1.1 ppm He on an atomic basis.) The points shown in Fig. 23 all come
from surveillance samples from the MSRE. The two higher strain rates
are obtained by tensile testing, and the fracture strain decreases with
increasing helium content. The 0.1% strain rate is the creep rate that
corresponds to the lowest fracture strain (Fig. 21). The fracture
strain drops abruptly with the presence of 1 ppm He and then decreases
gradually with increasing helium content.

The creep properties of heat 5065 are illustrated in a series of
graphs similar to that just presented for heat 5085. The stress-rupture
properties at 650°C are shown in Fig. 24 for heat 5065. The rupture

in Fig. 19 for heat 5085. The unirradiated samples that were aged for
22,533 hr at 650°C in static barren fuel salt have longer rupture lives
than the as-receivedrmaterial. The minimum creep rates are shown in
Fig. 25 and show a lack of sensitivity to any of the variables being

that the two heats respond to irradiation quite similarly. Heat 5065
contains about 23 ppm B (average of the four values in Table 1, p. 4),
and the variation of the ffacture strain with helium content is shown

in Fig. 28. The behavior is quite similar to that noted in Fig. 23 for
heat 5085. Thus, the lower borori (and hence helium) :concéntration in
heat 5065 results in .a‘béﬁtthe same properties as the higher boron level
in heat 5085. IR -

strains are shown as a function of test temperature in Fig. 29. Irra-
diation reduces the fracture strain over the entire range of test tem~
peratures, but the magnitude of the decrease is much greater at elevated
temperatures. The sharp drop in fracture strain with increasing temper-
ature occurs at a lower temperature for the irradiated material. The
ratios of the irradiated“éﬁd'unifradiated.pr0perties are shown in

Fig. 30. The yield stresSjis higher'for the irradisted material over

the test temperature rangeof'550.to 760°C. The ultimate-tensile strength
is about the same for the irradiated and unirradiated material but shows
& gradual decline with increasing test temperature. The fracture strain
 decreased due to irradiation,rﬁith the reduction being about 80% at 850°C.
'~ Some idea of the tensile properties of heat 7320 due to aging and
irradiation can be obtained from Table 13. The yield strengths at 25 and
" 650°C are increased by aging;fat a test temperature of 650°C a further

increase occurs due to irradiation. The changes in ultimate tensile

strength are rather small and likely within experimental error. The

fracture strain is decreased by aging and by irradiation; the magnitude

 

of the decrease is much larger at the test temperature of 650°C.

The results of tensile tests on the control and irradiated samples o
of heat 67-551 are given in Tables 14 and 15, respectively. The fracture |
strain is shown as a function of test temperature in Fig. 31. The frac-
ture strain at low temperatures is not influenced by irradiation, but
above 400°C the fracture strain is decreased by irradiation. However,
the fracture strains at high temperatures are higher than those for
either heat 7320 (Fig. 29) or the standard alloy (Figs. 9 and 11, pp. 18
and 22, respectively). The ratios of the irradiated and unirradiated
tensilé properties are Shdwn in'Fig. 32. The yield stress is generally
about 25% lower for the irradiated material. The ultimate tensile
strength is reduced only abOut_lO% by irradiation when tested below 550°¢C,

‘but is reduced up to 30% as the test temperature is increased. The frac-

ture strain is unaffected byrirradiation up to test temperatures of 500°C;

~above this temperature:théifractﬁre strain decreases progressively with

- increasihg test_temperature;f Some values of the tensile properties at

25 and 650°C are given_in_Tqblerlé, Aging at 650°C seems to increase
the yield_ﬁtrength at both 25 and 650°C; however, the strength of the
irradiated material is quite close to that of the as-annealed material.

The ultimate tensile strength is increased only slightly by aging and

decreased by irradiation. At 25°C the fracture strain is reduced from
79.6% to 52.3% by aging, and irradiation does not cause any further
change. At 650°C the fracture strain is decreased by aging and decreased
further by irradiation.

The creep-rupture properties of heat 7320 are summarized in
Table 17. These results are compared in Figs. 33, 34, and 35 with those
for unirradiated samples that were given a pretest anneal of 1 hr at
1177°C. The stress-rupture properties in Fig. 33 show that the aging
treatment given the controls, 7244 hr at 750°C, increased the rupture
life. The irradiated samples failed after longer times than did the
unirradiated sa.mples that were sn.mply annealed 1 hr at 1177°C, but
'ruptured in shorter times than the control semples However, the minimum
- ereep rates shown in Fig. 34 seem'to fall within & common scatter ‘band
~ for all conditions._ Thus, neither 1rrad1at10n nor aging seems to have a
detectable effect on the minimum creep rate The fracture strain is
shown as a function of strain rate in Fig. 35, The fracture stfains of
the unlrradlated samples vary from about 30% in a tensile test to about
10% in a long-term creep test. The irradiated samples have lower frac-
ture strains that vary from 9 5% for the fastest tensile test to 2 to 3%

for creep tests.

Fig. 35. Fracture Strains at 650°C of Heat 7320 in the Unirradiated
and Irradiated Conditions. Irradiated to a thermal fluence of 5.1 X 10%°
neutrons/cm® over a period of 7244 hr at 650°C.

The results of creep-rupture tests on heat 67-551 with 1.1% Ti are
given in Table 18. The stress-rupture properties of the control and
irradiated samples are compared in Fig. 36 for 650°C. The irradiated
samples generally fail in slightly shorter times than the unirradiated
samples. The minimum creep rate seems to be unaffected by irradiation,
although there are two data points that seem to be anomalous (Fig. 37).
The fracture strains of this alloy (Fig. 38) are higher in both the
unirradiated and irradiated conditions then those for heat 7320. The
fracture strains of the unirradiated samples varied over the range of
43 to 25% and those of the irradiated samples varied from 22.6 to 5.8%
over the range of strain rates studied.

One heat of modified Hastelloy N containing 0.49% Hf (heat 67-504)
was exposed to the cell environment for 17,033 hr at 650°C. The .thermal -
fluence was 2.5 X 10'° neutrons/em?. This same heat of material was

fracture strains of about 50% up to 500°C, above which the fracture
strain dropped progressively with increasing temperature. Irradiation
to a thermal fluence of 5.3 X 102C neutrons/cm® at 650°C in fuel salt
over a period of 9789 hr resulted in a low fracture strain at 25°C (which
may be anomalous), fracture strains of about 45% up to 500°C, and
decreasing fracture strains with increasing test temperature. The most
striking feature is that above 550°C the fracture strains are lower for
material irradiated in N, + 2 to 5% Oy for 17,033 hr to a fluence of
2.5 X 101° neutrons/em? than for those irradiated in fuel salt for
9789 hr to a fluence of 5.3 X 10%C neutrons/cm®.
Some values of the tensile properties at 25 and 650°C are given in
Table 20. The yield stress at both test temperatures was increased by
aging and by irradiation. The ultimate teﬁsile stress at 25°C was
increased by aging and by irradiation; at 650°C it was increased by
aging,ybut decreased. by irradiation. We have already discussed the

changes in the fracture strain.

The results of Creep-rupture tests on heat 67-504 are summarized
in Table 21. These results and those obtained previously'! were used
to prepare Figs. 41, 42, and 43. The stress-rupture propertiés in
Fig. 41 show that the rupture'lifé was not changed appreciably'by aging,
at least for 9789 hr at 650°C. The stress-rupture life was reduced at
least two orders of megnitude by the lower fluence and only a factor of
2 by the higher fluence. The mi ndmum creep rates in Fig. 42 show that
this property was not changed as much as the rupture life. Aging for
9789 hr increased the'minimﬁm creep, but samples irradiated over the
same period had a lower creep rate than the aged samples. The samples
irradiated to the lower fluénce had a creep rate an order of magnitude

higher than that of the as-annealed material. The fracture strains are

material had a fracture strain of 66.9% if unirradiated and 16.5% if
irradiated. If the material was strained 5% at 650°C then annealed 1 hr
at 650°C and this pattern continued until failure, the unirradiated sam-
ple failed with 95.4% strain and the irradiated sample with 25.8% strain.
A sequence of tests was performed on unirradiated samples at 650°C in
which the annealing time was varied from 2 to 60 min; the results show
that this variable had little effect on the fracture strain. At a test
temperature of 760°C the fracture strain was 35.5% for an unirradiated
sample and 8.7% for an irradiated material. Samples were also tested by'
straining 3%, annealing 1 hr at 760°C, straining 3%, and repeating this
sequence until failure. The fracture strains were 96.0 and 23.7% for the

unirradiated and irradiated samples, respectively. These tests have
 

 

57

demonstrated that there is not, for each test temperature, & unique
strain at which failure occurs; rather, the fracture strain depends upon

the loading history.

Metallographic Examination of Test Samples

The tensile samples that were tested at 25°C at a strain rate of
0.05 min~! and at 650°C at a strain rate of 0.002 min~! were examined.
An irradiated sample of heat 5085 from the core that was tested at 25°C
is shown in Fig. 44. The fracture is primarily intergranular. There is
a high frequency of edge cracking that extends to a depth of about 4 mils.
The microstructure in the 4-mil region near the surface etches differently.
At a 650°C test temperature (Fig. 45)'the fracture is intergranular with
no evidence of plastic deformation of the individual grains except adja-
cent to the fracture. This sample aiSo had the modified structure and
edge cracks that extend 10 mils into the sample. The control samples of
heat 5085 that were annealed for 22,533 hr at 650°C in static barren fuel
salt are shown in Figs. 46 and 47. The sample shown in Fig. 46 wasr
tested at 25°C. The fracture is predominantly intergranular, but there
are no edge cracks. There is a very thin layer near the surface where
‘the structure is modified slightly. The microstructure is generally
characterized by large M¢C-type carbides, many of which cracked during
deformation, and a network of almost continuous carbides along the grain
and twin boundaries. When tested at 650°C (Fig. 47) the fracture is
intergranular. There is some edge cracking, but not as frequently as
noted in Fig. 45 for the irradiated sample. Another factor that should
be considered in comparlng Flgs 45 and 47 is that the irradiated sample
in Fig. 45 failed after stralnlng only 5% (Table 4, p. 18), whereas the
" unirradiated sample in Fig. 47 strained 24% (Table 3, p. 17) ‘before frac-
turing. The higher straln should have increased the number and depth of
edge cracks. The observed opp051te trend indicates some influence of
the exposure to the reactor env1ronment on the fracture characteristlcs
- near the surface. _

microstructure of a sample tested at 25°C is shown in Fig. 48. The

fracture is mixed transgranular and intergranular. The same structural
modification and edge'cracking that were noted in heat 5085 (Fig. 44)
are also present in heat 5065. A sample of heat 5065 tested at 650°C is
shown in Fig. 49. The fracture is intergranular'with little evidence
of deformation of the adjacent grains. The microstructure at the edge
is modified to a depth of about 4 mils, and cracks extend to a depth of
about 10 mils. A control sample tested at 25°C is shown in Fig. 50.

The fracture is mixed transgranular and intergranular, and the grains
are elongated in the direction of stressing. There is no edge cracking.
There are copious amounts of carbides, both of the large primary car-
bides and the finer carbides formed during the long annealing treatment
at 650°C. The microstructure of a control sample of heat 5065 tested at
650°C (Fig. 51) shows an intergranular fracture and some edge cracking.
Again the frequency of cracking is less than that noted for the irra-
diated material shown in Fig. 49.

Heat 7320 was exposed to the MSRE core for 7244 hr at 650°C. Typi-
cal micrographs of a sample tested at 25°C are shown in Fig. 52. The
fracture is predominantly transgranular and the flow lines and the elon-
gated grains attest to therdeformation of the matrix. There are some
edge cracks to a depth of about 3 mils, but the microstructure is not
modified at the sample surface. Microstructures of an irradiated sample
tested at 650°C are shown in'Fig. 53. The fracture is intergranular.
There are edge cracks that extend to a depth of about 10 mils, but the
microstructure is not modified near the surface. A control sample that
was tested at 25°C is shOthiﬁ'Fig 54, The fracture is transgranular
with the grains being elongated in the direction of streSS1ng There is
no edge cracking. The unstressed microstructure gives a hint of the
'very fine matrix precipltatlon thatris ‘present in this alloy. -Photo-
“micrographs of a control sample tested at 650°C are shown-in'Fig. 55‘
The fracture is 1ntergranular, and there are no edge cracks such as were
.noted in the irradiated sample (Fig 53).

Heat 67-551 was exposed 1n the MSRE core for 7244 hr at 650°C. The
fracture at 25°C (Fig. 56) is mixed transgranular and 1ntergranular and

not modified, but edge cracks extend to a depth of about.8-mils. A con-

is largely transgranular, and there are no edge cracks nor structural
modifications. The high magnificétion view shows the fine carbide pre-
cipitates that form during the long thermal anneal. At 650°C the frac-
ture is intergranular with numerous intergranular cracks scattered
throughout the sample (Fig. 59). A few cracks are near the surface, but
these are to be expected in light of the 31.5% strain (Table 14, p. 40)
that occurred in this sample before failure.

Heat 67-504 was exposed to the MSRE cell environment of N, + 2 to
5% 0, for 17,033 hr at 650°C and had an oxide film of 1 to 2 mils: when
tested at 25°C (Fig. 60) the fracture was mixed transgranular and inter-
granular, although most of the deformation occurred within the grains.
There was no edge cracking. When tested at 650°C (Fig. 61) the fracture
was primarily intergranular. There were edge cracks to a depth of
15 mils. Since there were no controls to compare with these samples, it
is difficult to say whether the frequency and depth of cracking are
greater than would be expected.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The mechanical property changes of the standard HastellOy N in both
the irradiated'and unirradiated conditions have fdllowed very. regular
trends throughout its exposure in the MSRE and in the control facility.
Heats 5065 and 5085 have been used throughout the surveillance program.
Exposure to the static barren fuel salt up to 15,289 hr brought about a
gradual reduction of the tensile fracture strains in both heats; further
exposure up to 22,533 hr caused a slight improvement ovef the strains
observed after 15,289 hr (Figs. 15 and 17, pp. 24 and 25). These changes
were small compared with those observed after irradiation, aﬁd we attrib-
ute them to the precipitation of grain-boundary carbides. These changes
in tensile properties occurred without detectable change in the creep
strength at 650°C (Figs. 19 and 25, pp. 30 and 34).

Irradiation of both heats caused a general decrease of the fracture
strain with increasing thermal fluence at test temperatures of 25 to
850°C. The fracture strains at lowltemperatures are lower for heat 5065.
We attribute the reduction in fracture strain at low temperatures to pre-
cipitation of carbides and demonstrated previously that it can be'
recovered by annealing to coarsen the carbide.l? We attribute the embrit-
tlement at high temperatures to the helium formed by thermal transmute-
tion of 1B to form “He and "Li. This embrittlement cannot be recovered
by annealing. The presence of helium in the material influences the
creep properties at 650°C by reducing the rupture life and the straih at
fracture; the creep rate is unaffected (Flgs 19 through 26, pp. 30
through 34). The effects on the rupture life are greater at hlgher stress
levels and decrease to 1n51gn1flcant below about 10,000 psi. (The maxi-
mum operating stress!® in the MSRE is 6000 psi.) The changes in the
fracture strain are of utmost importance and are slightly dependent ﬁpon
the thermal fluence (Figs. 21 and 26). Figure 23 shows more clearly the
sensitivity of heat 5085 to the preseﬁce of helium and how this sensitiv-
ity at 650°C depends upon the strain rate. A thermal fluénge_of only
1.3 X 10'° neutrons/cm® produced sbout 1 ppm (atomic) He and reduced the
fracture strain from 30 to 2% when the material was crept at a rate of
O.l%/hr. The strain rate results in the lowest fracture strains with
slower rates resulting in slightly higher values. Figure 28, pl 36,
shows that this same general behavior holds for heat 5065 although the
amounts of helium produced are actually lower. The MSRE vessel has
received a thermal fluence of about 4 X 10'? neutrons/em®, and Figs. 23
and 28 indicate that the fracture strains will not drop much more with
continued operation. The control rod thimbles have received a thermal
fluence of about 2 X 10°! neutrons/cm?. They should be extremely brittle,
but are normally subjected to only a slight compressive stress.

The greater strain rate senSitivity of the irradiated Hastelloy N
at 650°C is illustrated in Figs. 22 and 27 for heats 5085 and 5065,

- respectively. For heat 5085 the fracture strain of the unirradiated
material varies from 32 to 21%, a decrease of 34%, and the irradiated
‘material varies from 9.3 to 0.5%, a decrease of 95%. For heat 5065 the
corresponding reductions are-35%'for the unirradiated material and 97%
for the irradiated material.

The question of primary concern is whether the Hastelloy N has
corroded more rapidly during the previous surveillance period than
previously. We have at least three parameters or phenomena that can be
observed or measured that likely are dependent upon the corrosion rate.
The first measure is the chemical change of the salt during reactor
operation. Since the chromium observed in the salt can hardly come
from anywhere except the Hastelloy N, we cannot question this parameter
as a measure of the corrosion rate. Second, we can observe changes in
the microstructure. Figures 2, 3, and 4, pp. 9, 10, and 12, show typi-
cal changes, but these observations are difficult to interpret without
additional information. Third, the mechanical properties themselves may
be altered or the crack patternS'that develop may be useful indications
of the effects of corrosion on the mechanical properties. The property
changes themselves are not very useful in this case because we have only
matched sets of control samples and surveillance samples. The control
samples are exposed to a static barren fuel salt that does not match the
corrosiveness of the MSRE fuel circuit. The surveillance samples are
exposed to & neutron fiueﬁceiand to a more corrosive salt circuit. Thé
irradiation effects predominate, s0 the effects of the added corrosion
are not large enough to seé;by Obéérving the mechanical property changes.
Thus there are several measures of corrosion in the MSRE, but they are
‘all subject to interprefatign.'Because-of the importance of this sub-
Ject, let us review thé.pérﬁinént'facts and observations.

1. Before the last,periodwof.dperatibn, the salt was removed from
the MSRE and processed to remove the uranium and replace it with 233U,
 This processing left the salt fairly oxidizing, and it was necessary to
adjust theboxidationpotentiai'by adding beryllium“metal._ Thé chromium
contént:ofithe salt\was'bnlj 40 ppm when placed in the reactor and rose
over a few weeks to a level Qf'aboﬁt 100 ppm. This apparénfhcorrosion

codld be accounted for by uniformly removing the chromium from the

 
 

 

80

Hastelloy N to a depth of 0.3 mil. The total increase of chromium in
the salt during the entire MSRE operation would require uniform chromium
extraction to a depth of 0.4 mil. However, the diffusion rate along the
grain boundaries can be about 10° the rate through the bulk grains,l*
and it is more likely that chromium be removed to greater depths along
the grain boundaries.

2. Electron microprobe examination of the sample in Fig. 5, p. 13,
revealed a definite chromium gradient near the surface and a surface
chromium concentration of nearly zero. A diffusion coefficient of
4 x 10"14 cm?/sec for chromium was computed based on the shape of the
profile which is in excellent agreement with the value of 2 X 10714 em?/sec
measured by Grimes et al.l’ (Fig. 62).

3. Complete loss of chromium from Hastelloy N does not result in
the type of microstructural modification that was observed, not does it
cause embrittlement.1© VWe made laboratory melts containing from O to
9% Cr with the standard Hastelloy N base composition. The. amount of car-
bide precipitate increases and the grain size decreases as the chromium con-
tent increases. The alloy is weaker in creep at 650°C without chromium,
but the fracture strains are not dependent upon the chromium concentration.

4. Similar microprobe scans have been made on control samples where
the modified structure is also present. The resolution is much better
on these samples where the background radiation is not present. The
gradients measured in a sample that had been in the control facility for
15,289 hr at 650°C are shown in Fig. 63. The chromium is.depleted and
the iron is enriched near the surface. These chemical modifications
extend only a short diétance into the material. These changes wotld not

be expected to produce the microstructural changes.

they were handled considerably during disassembly. Thus one cannot con-
clude whether the cracks were formed during service or in handling after-
wards. The microstructure was not modified near the surface of thése
stréps, |

6. A surface microstructural modification has been observed spas-
modically during this entire pregram. The photomicrographs of the
various lots of heat 5085 that were examined are presented in Fig. 64.
The modified microstructure has been present to some degree in all sam-
ples including the irradiated and the control samples. It is difficult
to say that the modification has grown any worse.

7. We have been able to produce a microstructural modification
quite similar to that shown in Fig. 65 by sinterless grinding Hastelloy N
and then annealing it for long periods of time in argon at 650°C
(Fig. 65). Thus, the layer may well be associated with cold working and
the manner in which this alters carbide deposition near the surface. |

8. There is a definite tendency for the samples removed from the
MSRE to show progressively more edge cracking during postirradiation
testing as the time of exposure increases. As shown in Fig. 66 for sam-
ples stressed at 25°C, the frequency of edge cracks 'increases with expo-
sure, but the maximum depth is constant at about 4 mils. The control
samples do not show much edge cracking.

9. Microprobe scans on irradiated samples failed to reveal any
fission products in the sample. However, the inability to analyze solely

the material in a grain boundary makes it impossible to conclude that
| no fission products are entering the metal. We plan to dissolve progres-
sive layers from the sample surfaces for chemical analysis to answer this
question. !

The observations on the alloys of modified Hastelloy N are quite
important. Heats 7320 (0.5% Ti) and 67-551 (1.1% Ti) were exposed to
the MSRE core for 7244 hr at 650°C. The properties of heat 7320 were
not as good as we have observed for other 0.5% Ti-modified alloys irra-
diated at 650°C. However, the properties after irradiation in the MSRE
are equivalent to those measured after irradiation in the ORR in & helium

environment. The properties of heat 67-551 are outstanding. Both of

these heats seem to demonstrate some small property'changes due to ther-
mal aging. These changes are not large, but must be followed to longer
times to make sure that they do not become large.

These two modified heats did not show a structural modification
near the surface, but did exhibit edge cracking when tested. The fre-
guency of edge cracks is much higher than noted for the controls.

One of the most confusing observations was the poor mechanical
properties of heat 67-504 from outside the core. This heat was pre-
viouslyl® exposed to the core for 9789 hr to a thermal fluence of

5.3 X 102%° neutrons/cm®. The present group of samples outside the core

was exposed to N, + 2 to 5% 0, for 17,033 hr and received a thermal
fluence of 2.5 x 101° neutrons/cmz. The latter group had poorer mechan-
ical properties than the group exposed to the higher fluence. The
rupture life at a given stress level was less (Fig. 41, p. 54), the
minimum creep rate higher (Fig. 42, p. 54), and the fracture strain lower
(Fig. 43, p. 55). The photomlcrographs in Figs. 60 and 61, pp. 76 and 77,
show some surface oxidation but no othe;‘unusual features. Two heats
should have been used, heat 67-502 (2% W + 0.5% Ti) and heat 67-504

(0.5% Hf). Postirradiation chemical analyses showed the presence of
0.5% Hf, but no tungsten was present. Hence, we have concluded that
only heat 67-504 was included in these tests.

Our surveillance program has given us the opportunity to look at
several alloys of modified composition. The creep properties of these
heats are compared with those of standard Hastelloy N in Fig; 67. The
curves were drawn through only four or five data points in each case,'
SO siight differences in s;ppg_are not significant. The rupture lives
of .the modified‘alloys'are within a factor of 2. The rupture lives of
the irradiated, modified heats are about equivalent to those of uwnirra-
diated standard Hastelldy N. The creep rates, shown in Fig. 67(b), are
loﬁer for fhe mbdified alloys by as much as a factor of 3. Heats 67-502
and 67-504 have the lowest creep rates. The postirradiation fracture
strains are shown in Fig. 67(c). Quite a range of fracture strains
resulted with a minimum of about 0.5% for standard Hastelloy N and a
minimm of about 7% for heat 67-551. Heats 67-502 and 67-504 had frac-
ture strains of 6.4%; heat 7320 was not much better than standard
Hastelloy N with only 2.8%.

ane of the modified alloys have shown any adverse corrosion behav-
ior in the salt. Thus, it would appear that we have several alloys that
are suitable for use in future reactors that operate at 650°C. However,
as discussed previously, these new alloys are very sensitive to irradia-
tion temperature and the proposed 700°C operating temperature of a
breeder is too high for these alloys.l® Present work offers encourage-
ment that an alloy that is stable at 700°C can be developed by adding

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The heats of Hastelloy N used in fabricating the MSRE have shown &
systematic deterioration of mechanical properties with increasing neutron
fluence. The material expoeed for the longest period of time in the
core has reached a thermal-fluence of 1.5 x 10?1 neutrons/cm? and a fast
fluence (> 50 kev) of 1.1 X 102! neutrons/cm®. These values are quite
close to those anticipated fer future reactors with a 30-year design |
life. The ductility of the material was too low, but the microstructure
was free of irradiation-induced voids and defects other than helium bub-
bles. Several heats of the modified alloys have been exposed to the MSRE
and these have bhetter postirradiation properties. They also seem to
have good corrosion resistance.

The standard Hastelloy N removed from the core shows some evidence
of corrosion. The corrosion seems generally to be due to the selective
removal of chromium, as predieted by prenuclear tests.- Some observations
that have not been explained adequately are (1) the presence of grain-
boundary cracks in the straps that held parts of the surveillance assem-
bly together, (2) the modified microstructure near the surface, and
(3) the formation of intergranular'cracks originating from the surface
when irradiated materials are strained.

' One of the modified alloys, heat 67-504, was ‘exposed to the cell
enviromment. This heat had been previousLy exposed to the MSRE. The
fiuence was. higher in the core, but the postirradiation properties were
_superlor to those of the material exposed to the cell env1ronment We

presently have no explanatlon for the observed behevmor.
