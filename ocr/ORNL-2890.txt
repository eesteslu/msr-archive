MOLTEN-SAIT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY

Part 1. Engineering and Component Development

1.1 Component DevelopmentlandrTestingr'

 

Development work on molten-salt-lubricated bearings was continued.

In the series of seven coneluded tests the start-stop tolerance of journal
bearings made of INOR-8 was investigated. In all but two cases, tests
were carried to seizure or impending seizure. Time of operation ranged
from 3 to 379 hr. The largest number of start-stop cycles per test was
260. Signs of metal-to-metal rubbing were evident on bearing surfaces.
Serious ingassing was observed during bench tests of the hydrodynamic
thrust bearing. Remedial efforts are being continued, and further bench
tests are proposed. 7

Two‘pumps equipped with hydrodynamic bearings were bench tested and
then tested in molten salt. Seizure occurred in both after short operation
in salt, and the failures were attributed to dry bearings caused by ex-
cessive restrictions in the suction path of the bearings.

No evidence of self-welding was found between INOR-8 surfaces immersed
in molten salt at 1200°F. Coefficients of dry friction for INOR-8 on INOR-
8 and for INOR-8 on stainless steel were found to be fairly constant in
the 900 to 1800°F temperature range, a good average value being 0.25.

Eleven long-term corr051on loops nompleted one year of operatlng time
in this quarter. Tests on two INOR-8 loops and one Inconel loop were ter-

minated for metallurgical examination; the results are not yet available.

One loop was shut down temporarily due to pump failure and a subséquent
0il fire. The test will be continued after repairs and reloading. The
second of three sample inserts was removed from loop 9354-4 after-l0,000
hr of operation. Findings on this insert are described in Sec 2.1. Two
new INOR-8 loops were started up with BULT-14 salt. These loOps'have
double-walled inserts at the exit of the second resistance'heater.

The PKP centrifugal pump with Fulton Sylphon bellows-mounted seal has
logged 17,878 hr of operation in NaK at 1200°F. Only negligible leakage
was observed. The MF-type centrifugal pump is operating in a region of
cavitation in salt 30, and service time of more than 20,000 hr has been
recorded to date. The average upper- and lower-seal leakage rates amounted
to 30 and 12 cc/day, respectively.

Trouble-free operation of the small frozen-lead pump seal continued.
Total service time is 12,000 hr. The large frozen-lead-seal test was dis-
continued. |

An apparatus for testing graphite-metal seals is under construction.
A seal in the annulus between a 5-in.-0D graphite tube and a larger, mating
Inconel section will be attempted first. '

Sectioning of the first two in-pile loops was completed, and metallo-
graphic and analytical examinations are in progress. A test program was
launched to explore the behavior of graphite under conditions similar to
those encountered in graphite-moderated molten-salt reactors. Bench tests
have been completed, and the first experiment is scheduled for insertion

in the MIR early in 1960.

1.2 Engineering Research
The viscosity of the fuel mixture BULT-14 (LiF-BeF,-UF,-Th¥,, 67-18.5-
0.5-14 mole %) was determined in the temperature range from 550 to 800°C

 

Comparison with previous results on other salt compositions containing a
high percentage of ThF, shows a maximum deviation of 18% at the extremes
of the temperature range. Enthalpy measurements with the BelT-15 mixture

(LiF-BeF,~-ThF,, 67-18-15 mole %) yielded a heat capacity varying from 0.343

 

Btu.1b™}.(°F)™1 at 1000°F to 0.304 Btu-1b™1.(°F)7! at 1500°F. The appa-
ratus for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient, B, of molten salt
mixtures was tested by using HTS (NaNoz-l\IaNog, -KNO;, 40-7-53 wt %). The
coefficient B was 3.63 x 107%/°C between 215 and 315°C; comparison with

data obtained from density measurements shows good agreement.

Preliminary results were obtained for heat transfer with BULT-14 flow-
ing in heated Inconel and INOR-8 tubes. The system was operated continu-
ously for about five weeks without difficulty. Axial temperature profiles
show the effect of the laminar-turbulent transition in the hydrodynamic
boundary layer in the entrance section of the tube. The heat transfer ap-
pears to be about half that which would be predicted from earlier studies
with molten salts; this discrepancy may result frdmlan uncertainty in the
value of the thermal conductivity for BUIE-14 used in the analysis of the
data. A 23% difference between the resultssin the Inconel and INOR-8 tubes

cannot be explained, at present.

Part 2. Materials Studies

2.1 Metallurgy

In an effort to join graphite to graphite and graphite to metal for
molten-salt reactor service, an alloy (48p Ti—48% Zr—4% Be) was developed
and had satisfactory wetting and flowing characteristics. However, because
of its poor corrosion resistance to molten fluorides, other alloy systems
are being investigated. Promising alloys in the Au-Ni-Ta system are under
study, and alloys in the Ni-Nb, Ni-Mo, Ni-Nb-Mo, Ni-Nb-Ta, Pd-Ni-Ta, and
Pd-Ni-Mo systems are being prepared for testing. Preliminary work in
electric-resistance brazing of graphite to graphite, using molybdenum as
the brazing alloy, has also been undertaken.

The second of three—INOR-S corrosion inserts was removed after 10,000
hr from an INOR-8 forced- convection loop._ Weight-loss evaluations indi-
cated the insert to have lost 2‘0 mg/cm?, whlch corresponds to a wall

f thlckness decrease of O 09 mll if unlform removal of the Wall is assumed.
rExamlnatlon of three InCOnel forced—convectlon loops, whlch clrculated
-"fll;fluorldes for one year, was completed.; Two of the loops showed normal at-
'4}:tackéin the form of 1ntergranular and general v01ds to. a depth ranging from
fl toila mils. The third loop was heav1ly attacked to depths ranging from
'1”37fi18 t0738 mlls Salt in the latter loop showed appreciable oxide contami-

   

 

   

W}Fifteen grades of graphlte were class1f1ed according to thelr re51st-

 ance to permeation‘by molten fluorides at 150 psig at 1300°F in 100-hr

tests. Grade GT-123 wasrfound to have a bulk-volume permeation of less

than 0.5%, the maximum specified for the reactor, despite the high test

 
 

 

 

 

 

pressure. Bismuth has been used to fill the accessible voids in AGOT -
graphite prior to exposing it to molten salts. Tests are being conducted
to detérmine to what extent the bismuth-permeated graphite will pick up
salts during standard permeation tests.

When held in direct contact with graphite for 20 hr at 1300°F, LiF-
BeF,-UF,; (62-37-1 mole %) apparently gettered completely the oxide contami-
nants inrthe gfapﬁitét.No precipitation was detected radiographically in
the LiF-BerfThF4-UF4 (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %) after it had been in contact
with graphite for 500 hr at 1300°F in 'a vacuum.

INOR-8 specimens showed no metallographic indications that carburiza-
tion had occurred after being in contact with TSF graphite at 1000 psi for
700 hr in salt environment at 1300°F. |

Four braze materials showed good resistance to fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,,
62-37-1 mole %) during a 5000-hr corrosion test in a thermal-convection
loop with a 1300°F hot-leg temperature. Corrosion tests of 100-hr duration
indicated that the usefulness of titanium-, zirconium-, or beryllium-con-
taining braiing alloys in fuel 130 would be limited in pure nickel or INOR-
8 containers at 1300°F. Heavy attack due to the transfer of the refractory

material to the nickel or INOR-8 container walls was oObserved.

.2.2 Chemistry and Radiation Effects

 

Detailed description of the ten subsidiary binary and ternary systems
incorporated in the LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, quaternary system 1s nearly completed.
Among the questions as yet incompletely answered by phase-equilibria studies
on breeder fuels is that of detailed crystallization paths for compositions
of reactor interest. '

The.identification of the isomorphic compounds N&F-BéFg-BUF4 and
NaF -BeF,+3ThF, 1s of especial academic interest since NaF-BeF,:3UF, has
been erroneously reported in the literaturé‘as N&FJKUEg;,'

The solubility of HF in molten fluoride“bréeder‘fuels has been cor-
related ﬁith SOlvent composition by means of-a'doncentration scale based
on the excess or deficiency, in equivalent per cent, of:alkali ﬁluoride .
for complete coordination of higher-valence cations in the solvent; that
is, Na,BeF, and Na,;ZrF, correspond to complete coordination and represent
the limit of complexing power of the cation.

Exchange reactions in molten fluorides, particularly those that might

be of interest in reprocessing schemes, are being explored. Many of the

';718 as,high as 4 to 5%, and thls system is therefore belng investigated

reactions potentially useful for removing rare earths are subject to in-
terference by essential ingredients in the fuel.

The diffusion of chromium, which is the rate-limiting process for
long-term corrosion in molten fluoride breeders, is strongly dependent on
grain size, and hence on annealing history. Under equivalent conditions
there is no significant difference between the diffusion coefficients of
chromium in INOR-8 and in Inconel; thus the steady-state corrosion rate
is predicted to be higher by a factor of 15/7 in Inconel, since this is
the ratio of chromium concentration in the two alloys.

Except for one unexpiained and palpably misfunctioning case, sampled
corrosion test loops are demthtrating predictable and satisfactory be-
havior in long-term tests.

Exploratory studies on the hygroscopicity of fuels and on the possi-
bility of drying at low tempepatures without extensive hydrolysis have
given additional qualitative evidence of the extreme sensitivity of the
fuels to moist air. . | |

Evidence of formation of a graphite intercalgtion compound with MoFs,
was found, but this compound is not expected to be encountered in reactor
operatien. |

Several grades of extrudedpgraphite, but none of the molded types,
show less than 1 vol % permeetion by breeder fuels at 60 to 75 psig and

'1300°F.

About 740 kg of purified fuel mixtures was processed during the quar-

ter. INOR-8 corrosion test capsules have been removed from the MIR after

| 5500 hr of exposure and a 75% uranium.burnup.

£5J L Molten-Salt-Lubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

 

= Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings

 

Investigations of journal bearings operating in molten salt 130 (LiF-
BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) were continued throughout the quarter. Four
tests were performed to investigate start~stop ability of carburized

INOR-8 journals operating at temperatures from 1200 to 1500°F in INOR-8

4ﬂ

bearlngs having three axial grooves, three were conducted to investigate
performance of the three-helical-groove INOR-8 bearing at 1200°F. A test,
No. 22, of the performance of Inconel for comparison with INOR-8 is in
progress. All test pieces were fitted with a radial clearance of 0.005
in., (measured at room temperature). A summary of the test conditions is
presented in Table 1.1.1. |

Test 15 was terminated When impending seizure became evident upon
restarting the run following a 30-min shutdown for repairs in the off-
gas line. The support pins vere twisted and partially severed from the
bearing sleeve. This condition, a result of poor attachment, possibly
gave rise to the impending failure.

Test 16, which was a repeat of test 15 with new parts, was terminated

i

on schedule. Examination indicatéd'that rubbing damage was somewhat less
€ than that experienced during a similar test at 1200°F.
Test 17 was terminated by seizure during start-stop cycle 129. The

test pieces exhibited galling and metal transfer, evidences of rubbing.

 

Test 18 was conducted until selzure occurred between the bearing
- end Journal fThey d1d not meetfdlmensional spec1fications, the test

end of the grooves. The flow restrictor was a thin disk having an inside
diameter 0.010 in. larger than the inside diameter of the bearing. The
test was terminated because of a slight roughness in the drive-motor
power trace. Examination of the test pieces did not reveal any apparent
cause for this problem.

Test 21 was a continuation of test 20, except that the flow restric-
tion on the bearing grooves was reduced by adding a 1/16- by 1/16-in. V-
notch to the shim at each groove. The fest was terminated by apparent
seizure in the 600-rpm run with 375 lbf load. There was slight evidence
of rubbing between the test surfaces.

Test 22, now in progress, is being performed with an Inconel journal

and a three-axial-groove Inconel bearing.

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings

Bench tests were performed on the thrust-bearing tester with the
thrust bearing immersed in oil; Gross ingassing was found, and a number
of modifications were investigated as pbssible corrective measures. Sev-
eral of these were promising}ibut further bench testing with other modifi-

cations is in order prior to hot tests in molten salt.

Test df Pump Equipped with One Molten-Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing
Bench tests were conducted'on‘the 6riginal pump design, shown in
Fig. 1.1.1, to investigate the performance of the overhung motor, of
the oil slinger in pumping lubricant to the upper bearing, and of the
journal bearing immersed in oil
The overhung motor was found to exert a large rotating radial load.

Investlgatlons show, however4f hat the load can be reduced to tolerable

  

,levels if the electrlcal balahce of the motor is 1mproved In the in-

 

::";‘terest of speeding the 1nvestlgatlo:fof a molten-salt bearlng applled to

Two journal-bearing configurations were tested in oil at room tem-
perature and in molten salt 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) at 1200°F.
The oil tests were performed with the pump assenbled except for the im-
peller; the complete assembly was operated in the tests with molten salt.
The first bearing tested had three axial grooves and was mounted rigidly.
The bearing operated successfully in o0il under load, and the pump was
subsequently placed in operation with molten salt. The pump was rotated
for 10 min at 1000 rpm and another 10 min at 1200 rpm; at 1200 rpm the
pump delivered a flow of 100 gpm. The operation was terminated as a re-
sult of seizure of the pump rotary element, which is believed to have oc-
curred in the molten-salt-lubricated journal bearing.

The other bearing had three helical grooves with a flow restriction
at the discharge (upper) end. The bearing was mounted flexibly on gim-

bals. It operated satisfactorily in oil but subsequently failed by sei-

 zure in operation with molten salt.

Study of the configuration near the bearing revealed that the im-
peller hub probably presented too great a restriction to flow of salt
into the bearing at the lower end; the bearing therefore pumped itself
dry in the molten-salt tests. This condition was probably responsible
for both the failures. During the oil tests this condition was not
present, since they were made without the impeller present. The flow
passage into the bearing has been increased by removal of material from
the impeller hub and the lower end of the bearing sleeve. Preparations

are being made for a third test.

Self-Welding of INOR-8

One INOR-8 self-welding experiment was performed at 1200°F, on loose-

 

fitting pins pressing against the sides of holes, a condition encountered
with gimbal-mounted bearings. The test was performed in a bath of molten
salt 107 for 1000 hr under a load of 200 1lb,. Examination of the test

f
pieces revealed no evidence of self-welding. A similar test will be per-

- formed at 1500°F.

Friction Tests on INOR-8
Friction tests were performed at MIT' on INOR-8 rubbing against INOR-8

 

and on INOR-8 against stainless steel. Four tests were performed, each of

which covered a temperature range of 70 to 1830°F. The relation between
the coefficient of friction and temperature is shown in Fig. 1.1.3. Note
thdt in each test the coefficient drops off over the range of 700 to 900°F

and then, in general, remains at approximately 0.25 on up to 1830°F.

Mechanical Seals for Pumps
The modified Fulton Sylphon bellows-mounted sea.l,2 undergoing test

 

in a PKP type of centrifugal pump, has accumulated an additional 3048 hr
of operation since the previous report period, for a total of 17,878 hr.
The pump con'tinuers, to operate at constant conditions of 1200°F loop tem-
perature,'2400—rpm shaft speed,'and 1200-gpm NaK flow. The seal leakage
in both the test seal and the Durametallic upper seal has been negligible.
The pump was stopped once to check the drive-motor brushes.

MF Performance Loop

 

An MF type of centrifugal pump has continued in operation® and has
logged more than 20,000 hr of continuous operation. Since the previous
report period the pump has continued operation in a region of cavitation

at 2700 rpm, 645 gpm, and 2.5 psig pump-tank cover gas pressure in molten

to replace the air filter on the motor-generator set and once (for 10 min)
to replacé the brushes in the d-c drive motor. The pump upperé and lower-
seal leakage rates havé averaged approximately 30 and 12 cc/day, respec-

tively.

Frozen-lead Pump Seal

 

The small frozen-lead pump seal being tested on a 3/l6éin.-dia shaft,
as described previously,? has operated continuously since the start of its

operation on June 13, 1958. The accumulated operating time, as of October

31, 1959, was 12,000 hr. There was slight leakage of lead during the first

100 hr of operation; there has been no further leakage.

Testing of the large frozen-lead pump seal was discontinued.

Remote Maintenance Demonstration Facility

 

Construction of the equipment in the Remote Maintenance Demonstration
Facility was completed during July. The entire loop of piping (made of
3-1/2- and 6-in. Inconel pipes) was stress-relieved at 1500°F for 2 hr.

A check of torque settings on the bolts of the freeze flanges after the
stress-relieving operation revealed that all suffered loss of tightness;
in some instances the bolt torque was reduced to as little as 40% of the
original setting. To assure constant bolt torque on the freeze flange
Joints during thermal cycling, the use of disk springs was suggested.
Three sets of Bellville-type springs are presently being tested for this
applicatibn.

A system of controlling the air flow to the cooling passages of the
freeze flanges was designed, and construction drawings were completed.

- It is believed that such a flow control will eliminate the adverse effects
of the differential thermal expansion between the Inconel flanges and
copper seal rings and will improve the gas-tightness of the system during
thermal cyclings.

The loop was tested for vacuum-tightness with the flange bolts tight-
ened to their original setting after stress-relieving. A pressure rise
of.52 n was recorded in a 56-hr period with the loop isolated. The system

was originally evacuated to 17 u.

Design, Construction, and Operation of Materials-Testing Loops

Forced-Circulation Corrosion Loops

 

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops
was continued. Table 1.1.2 gives a summary of 16 loop operations during'
the period, with accumulated hours of operation at test conditions. Eleven
of the loops have operated for a full year., (Four other loops with one |
year of operation had been terminated earlier.%)

Operation of INOR-8 loops MSRP-8 and -9 and Inconel loop 9377-4 was
terminated during this period for metallurgical examination. The two.
INOR-8 loops had operated without an incident; no dumping or freezé-up
of the salt was experienced in the loops although both sustained at least

five building-power failures. The LFB pump in the Inconel loop had been

Examination of the loops 1s 1n progress.

INOR-8 loop 9354-3 was shut down in September when a pump failure
resulted in an oil fire. The pump has been replaced, and operation of
the loop will be resumed on receipt of a new batch of salt.

INOR-8 loop 9354-4 was shut down in September, after 10,000 hr of
operation, for the removal of the second'oflthree sample inserts® con-
tained in the hot leg. Results of the examination of this insert are
given in Sec 2.1 of this report. Operatioh was resumed with the remaining
(third) insert.

INOR-8 loops MSRP-7 and -10 were shut down for the removal of tubing
sections from the hot leg after 8760 hr (one year) of operation. The sec-
tiohs-were replaced and operation was resumed. The sections are now being
examined by the Metallurgy Section.

Two new INOR-8 loops, MSRP-14 and -15, were placed in operation with
salt BULT-14 in October. Both loops contain molten-salt sampling devices

and three jacketed insert sections. The double-walled inserts were placed

at the exit of the second resistance-heater section as shown in Fig. 1.1.8.

The close-fitting combination of jacket and insert was designed to give
the same cross section and flow areé as the matching loop tubing.. Loop
MSRP-14 is operating with a high wall temperature of 1300°F, and MSRP-15
with a high wall temperature of 1400°F.

Graphite-Metal Seal Tests

Several designs for graphité-to-mefal frozen-salt seals have been
proposed. In the first of the configurations to be tested, the frozen-
salt seal will be formed in a narrow annulus between a 5-in.-0D graphite
tube and a slightly larger Inconel tube. Such a seal could be used in
8, molten4sait breeder reactor as the seal between the fuel salt and
breeder salt. A sectional view df the test-joint design is shown in Fig.
1.1.9. |

Manufacture of parts for the seal-test apparatus is nearly complete,
and construction of the test loop has been started. It is expected that:
the first test of the seal will be made before the end of November 1959.

vicinity of x/d = 10. :Further, the location of this temperature peak
should be relatéd”to the"configuration'of the tube entrance in that the
transition should‘occur farther downstream for a rounded entrance than
for a sharp-edged entrance. This may explain the shift in the location
of the peak between the curves a and b of Fig. 1.2.9; this same difference
between the temperature patterns in the Inconel and INOR-8 sections has
been observed in all runs made to date. Although a sharp-edged entrance
was specified for both sections, welding of the thin-walled tubes into
the heating lugs (mixing-chamber end plates) may have altered this situ-
ation. Thus it is not possible at this time to define exactly the en-
trance configuration. Far downstream.(x/d_>-40) the temperature curves
assume the character observed in earlier studies with molten salts® under
similar conditions of uniform heat input at the wall and established flow
and temperature filelds. |

was based on the heat gaihed by the fluid in passing through the test

whether there exists a progressive film formation for the BUIT-14 salt in

2.1 METALLURGY
" Graphite Brazing Studies

* Graphite has been prosted'for use as the moderator of a molten-salt

reactor. This material coald be placed in the core in simple shapes or

. f)

- as a'complex structure such as a heat exchanger that would form a section
of the primary'lbOp system. The latter case would probably require graph-
ite-to-graphite and graphite-to-metal joints that have structural integrity
‘and, to an extent leak-tightness _

A program has consequently been 1nit1ated to investigate various tech-
niques for producing Joints W1th graphlte and to evaluate their usefulness
for molten-salt-reactor serv1ce A prellmlnary literature survey revealed
a notable scarc1ty of JOlning technlques applicable to high-temperature-
reactor technolegy. Procedures_for wettlng graphlte are relatively well
known, but eiperience in-pfsdﬁeing reliable joints in complex assemblies
is lacking.' One‘serious pfobiem is related'to the gross differences be-
tween the thermal-exPansion eeefficient of graphite and those of common
brazing alloys and structural_materials.

Metals having a strbngttendency to form carbides wet graphite readily
when they are molten. 'Therefere5 alloys containing these carbide-forming
metals appear promising as brasing alloyslfor_joiningrgraphite to itself

and to metals."Zirconium and'titanium{appear especially attractive, since

their thermal-expan51on coefflclents are relatlvely low {see Table 2.1.1)

   

and since thelr melting p01nts can be reduced s1gn1f1cantly by only small

For molten-salt service, however, the uses of this particular alloy are
limited by its poor resistance to corrosion in this medium (see "Brazing
Material Evaluation in Fuel 130," this section). '

This development of other brazing-alloy systems is therefore being

undertaken in an effort to find more compatible materials. Utilizing

niobium, tantalum, and molybdenum as the primary carbide~-forming elements,

a number of alloy systems are being studied in detail to determine their
applicability for joining graphite. Alloys in the Au-Ni-Ta System.have
indicated promising wetting characteristics, and several alloy compositions
from the gold-rich corner of the ternary diagram have been selected for
further study. The relatively high thermal-expansion coefficients of gold-
rich alloys, however, may limit their use for Jjoining graphite. Other al-
loy systems which will be investigated include Ni-Mo, Ni-Nb, Ni-Nb-Mo,
Ni-Nb-Ta, Pd-Ni-Ta, and Pd-Ni-Mo.

Preliminary experiments have also been undertaken to determine the
feasibility_of electric-resistance bonding of graphite to graphite, using

molybdenum as the braze metal. So far, experiments have been confined to

installed at the end of the hot-leg section of thls loop to provide data
on the weight changes of INOR-8 in contact with a beryllium-base fluoride
fuel mixture. The schedule-spec1f1ed removal of one insert after 5000
hr of exposure, another after 10,000 hr, and the third after 15,000 hr.
Operation of the loop began in July 1958 under the conditions:

Salt mixture LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %)
Meximum fuel-metal interface 1300°F
temperature
Minimum salt temperature 1100°F
AT - 200°F
Reynolds No. 1600
Flow rate 2 gpm

Examination of the second insert, although not yet complete, indicates
that an average weight loss of 2.0 mg/ecm® (#3%) occurred along its 4-in.
length. If uniform removal of surface metal is assumed, this weight loss
corresponds to a loss in wall thickness of 0.09 mil. No detectable loss
in wall thickness was noted,in'comparing micrometer measurements of the
inserts taken before and after test. |

The first of the 1nserts which was removed from the loop after 5000
hr, showed a weight loss of l.8_mg/cn3 (2%), or a loss in wall thickness
of 0.08 mil. The similarity of these values to the values obtained after
10,000 hr indicates that no significant weight loss occurred after the
first 5000 hr of loop operation The errors listed with these values are
based on estlmated llmlts of prec151on of the instruments used to measure

crystallization of the matrix near the inside surfaces of the insert. There

~ is reason to suspect the latter possibility, since a reaming operation was

performed on the inserts prior to service and undOubtedly induced some
cold work along the inside surfaces. A review of the recrystallization'
properties of INOR-8 indicates that recrystallization of the material can
be initiated at 1300°F folloﬁing prior cold work.? Grain growth of fhe
recrystalllzed material would be extremely slow at this temperature Whlch
would help to explain the extremely fine crystallltes apparent. o

‘Examination of Three Inconel Pump lLoops. — Chemical and metallographic
results have been obtained for three Inconel pump loops which completed
one year's operation. Operating conditions for these loops are shown in
Table 2.1.2.

Mbtaliographic examination of loop 9344-1, which circulated salt 123
for 8760 hr at a maximum temperature of 1300°F, showed heavy attack in the
form of intergranular and general voids along both heater legs, as shown
in Fig. 2.1.8. In the first heater leg, attack ranged from 18 to 31 mils
in depth and in the second leg, from 18 to 38 mils., The unheated bend

Permeation of Graphite by Molten Salts

 

 

The permeatlon of various grades of graphite by molten fluoride salts
is being 1nvest1gated in- tests3 at 1300°F (704°C) for 100 hr at 150 psig,
using the weight increase of the test specimen to calculate the wvolume of
graphite that is permeated by the salt. Table 2.1.5, a summary of results,
lists 15 grades of graphite in order of resistance to permeation. These
grades were manufactured as low-permeability graphite, with the exception
of CT-158, CCN, CEYB, R-0013, AGOT, and TSF. The permeation values for

the pipe material are considered high, because no effort was made to seal

~ the ends of the pipe specimens to prevent the exposure of the more contin-

uous and accessible voids produced in the axial direction as a result of
fabrication. Pipe specimens with sealed ends are being made to be tested
for permeation, since values for them should be more applicable to reactor
designs.

Most of the testing was done with LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5
mole %); however, NaF-ZrF,-UF, (56-40-4 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1
mole %) were also used. Under the test conditions the extent of permeation
by the three salt mixtures Was essentially the same; other test conditions
will be investigated. No wetting of the graphite by the salts was ob-
served. |

Salt permeation studies with additional grades of graphite, including
studies to show the effect of exposure time and graphite shape, were begun.

An effort is belng made to preclude the fuel pickup by initially fill-
ing acce551b1e v01d spaces 1n the graphlte W1th bismuth, thus allGW1ng no

 

u; space for the salt. Approximatfly‘60% of the access1ble4 v01d spaces of

Removal of Oxide Contaminants from Graphite ,
Previous tests have shown that exposing graphite to fuel 130 (LiF-
BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) at 1300°F (704°C) will result in the precipita-
tion of UO,, and that this reaction is essentially complete within 5 hr
when the fuel is in vapor-phase contact or in direct contact with the
graphite. This indicated that oxide contamination might be removed from

| _the‘gréphite by vapor-phase or direct-contact gettering. Results that
 

 

9

"

indicated partial success in two such tests, with fuel 130 as the gettering
agent, have been reported.’

A direct-gettering test, which has been completed, was apparently
successful in removing oxide contaminants from the graphite. In the test
a charge of fuel 130 was in direct contact with an AGOT graphite crucible
for 20 hr at 1300°F (704°C) in a vacuum. The ratio of the bulk volume of
the graphite to the volume of the salt was 27:1 (an arbitrary standard
selected for such tests). Radiographic examinations at room temperature
indicated that a normal quantity of UO, had precipitated. The gettering
charge of fuel 130 was removed and replaced by a fresh charge of fuel 130,
which was held an additional 20 hr at 1300°F. Radiographic examination
showed no precipitation, indicating that the preceding gettering operation
was successful. _

Since the cost of fuel 130 would make i1t an uneconomical gettering
agent to use on a full-scale reactor, cheaper gettering agents are also
being investigated. A hydrogen test is in progress.

Tests similar to those described above are being made with LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %). Three such tests with AGOT graphite
have continued for 500 hr, and no precipitation has been detected in the

salt by radiographic examinations.

Compatibility of INOR-8 and Graphite in Direct Contact

The tendency for INOR-8 to carburize when in direct contact with
graphite is being investigated.as part of the over-all INOR-8-graphite—
salt compatibility program. TSF grade graphite and INOR-8 specimens were
held in contact at 1300°F‘a£ 1000 931._ Mbdifled stress-rupture apparatus

alloys which may be useful 1in the fabrication of metal-to-metal joihts in
such a heat exchanger is being evaluated. The method used to subject
brazing alloys to the corrosive environment in the hot leg of a thermal -
convection loop has been described éarlier,6 and corrosion test results .
on a series of brazing alloys subjected to fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1
mole %)} for 1000 hr at a 1300°F hot-leg temperature in such a loop have
been reported.? B

‘The results of a 5000-hr test made under the same conditions are out-
lined in Teble 2.1.6. Copper, gold-nickel, and the Coast Metals alloys
showed good corrosion resistance. A depleted region to a depth of 3.mils
was observed along each of the Coast Metals alloy fillets after the‘tést..
Results of earlier corrosion tests on these alloys in NaF-ZrF,-base fuels
and in liquid metals indicated that this depletion was due to the leaching
of the minor constituents boron and silicon from the alloy by the bath,
and it appears that boron and silicon are also being leached by fuel 130..
This depletion has no detrimental effect on the alloy, since a nickel-rich,
corrosion-resistant matrix is left. A 10,000-hr thermal—convection-loop
test on Inconel and INOR-8 lap joints brazed with the five brazing ma-
terials listed in Table 2.1.6 is in progress.

Some refractory-metal-base alloys, being developed by the Welding and
Brazing Group for possible application in joining graphite tp graphite,
were given a static corrosion test in fuel 130 for 100 hr at 1300°F. Nickel,
because of its comparative inertness to fluorides, was used as the test-
container material. Test results, listed in Table 2.1.7, showed large
welght losses for each alloy. In order to determine the alloying element
or elements responsible for the heavy attack, the following static corro-
sion tests in fuel 130 were conducted at 1300°F: (1) titanium was tested
in containers of titanium, nickel, and INOR-8, (2) zirconium was tested
in containers of zirconium, nickel, and INOR-8, and (3) beryllium was |
tested in a nickel container. Large weight losses (Table 2.1.8) were ob-
served for specimens tested in nickel or nickel-base containers, while |
smell weight losses were found when specimen and container were of the

same metal. Substituting an INOR-8 (containing 70% Ni) container for one

Phase Equilibrium Studies

 

The System BeF,-ThF,-UF,
The most favorable fuels for breeding with molten fluorides are ob-

 

tained from the LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, quaternary system. Of the ten binary
and ternary systems which are incorporated as limiting cases in this qua-
ternary system, enly the system BeF,-ThF,-UF, has not been described pre-
viously. Spot checks have shown that only two primary phases, those of
BeF, and of the ThF,-~UF,; solid solution, are involved in the BeF,-ThF,-
UF, phase disgram. As in the ThF,-UF, binary system, no minimum exists
in the THF4-UF4 solid-solution liquidus surface in the ternary system.
Isotherms for such of the liquidus surface in the ternary system can be
approximated by straight lines between the bounding binary systems BeF,-

Th¥, and BeF,-UF,.

The System BeF,-Thi',

Some of the information on previously reportedl preliminary phase

 

diagrams for BeF,-ThF, was uncertain because BeF,-ThF, mixtures containing
more than 75 mole % BeF, are too viscous to reach equilibrium, even in
periods as long as three weeks. This difficulty is greatly alleviated by
small additions of NaF or LiF, and the BeF,-ThF, binary diagram has now
been established with the aid of short extrapolations from work on the
ternary systems. Figure 2.2.1, showing a eutectic at 527°C and 2 mole %

ThF', , is regarded as a final diagram.

composition, which was reported by Eichelberger et al.? in their investi-

gation of the system NaF-BeF,-UF,. Moreover, studies at this laboratory

in the system NaF-BeF,-ThF, have shown that a primary-phase field exists

Gas Solubilities in Molten Fluorides

 

Solubility of HF in Fuel Solvents
As previously reported,4v5 the solubility of HF has been measured

 

over wide composition ranges in both BeF,~- and ZrF,-base solvents. In
each type of system, compositions rich in alkali fluorides showed marked
increases in.the solubility and in the héat of solution of HF. The tran-
sition to higher values appeared to occur as the alkali fluoride content
exceeded the stoichiometry for coﬂmlete complexing of the Be™ as BeF4-f
and the Zr4* as ZrF, , thereby providing "free" fluorides for forming
HFQ“. |

Several schemes were examined in an attempt to correlate the solu-
bility of HF with the composition of the solvent. One which works well
is the use of a composition scale in terms of equivalent per cent free
NeF as shown in Fig. 2.2.2. Compositions corresponding to Na,BeF, and
Na;ZrF, are considered to contain 0% excess NaF. Other compositions con-
tain an excess or a deficiency of NaF; equivalents are calculated on the
basis of 2 for Na,BeF, and 3 for NaZrF, in obtaining equivalent per cent
compositions according to this scheme.

Figures 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.2.5, applying to different temperatures,
demonstrate the good correlation achieved for solubilities in NéF-ZrF4 and
NaF-BeF, compositions. Solubilities are expressed in terms of the Henry's
law constant. The curves in the figures are logarithmic and give straight-
line plots on semilog paper. The effects of both temperaturerand compo-

sition are accommodated in the expression

Exchange Reactions in Molten Fluorides

 

Experiments with exchange reactions for reprocessing molten-salt re-

actor fuels have continued.® Important characteristics for potential solid

exchange reactants are insolubility in molten fluorides and chemical in-
ertness toward reactor fuel constituents.
gtudies of oxide reactions in molten fluorides have shown that the

rare-earth oxides are sufficiently insoluble to qualify as possible ex-

change agents.’ The exchange of CeO, with cerium ion in the solvent LiF-NaF

(60-40 mole %) and the effect of subsequently added CeF; on the equilibrium

Ce¥F4(4) + CeO,(s8) = Ce*0, + CeF,

are shown in Fig. 2.2.6., Similarly, in the same solvent, the removal of

lanthanum-tracer activity with La03 and the effect of subsequent additions.

of CeF3 are shown in Fig. 2.2.7. These experiments, while not carriéd out
in realistic fuels, nevertheless illustrate the effectiveness of exchange
proceéses in molten fluorides. The exchange of lanthanum with cérium is
interesting as a possible method for replacing nuclear poisons, such as

samarium, gadolinium, and europium, with more innocuous rare earths such

as cerium. Unfortunately, as shown in Fig. 2.2.8, Ce0, reacts readily with

+)

UF,; in the solvent LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %). Hence, reprocessing with rare-
earth oxides would prohably be limited to reactor fuels from which uranium
had been removed by prior treatment. Figure 2.2.9 illustrates the unfavor-
able effect of ThF, and BeF, on the removal of tracer-cerium activity from
solution by exchange with CeO,.

Experiments to investigate the exchange properties of carbides are
also under way. The results of two experiments to study the removal of
hafnium activity with hafnium carbide are shown in Fig. 2.2.10. These re-
sults illustrate the unfavorable effect of UF, on the exchange reaction
in the solvent LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %).

Attempts to.remove barium activity with Cr,05 and BeO from the solvent
LIF-Bng-ThF4 (67-18-15 mole %) were not successful. Similarly an attempt
to remove cerium activity from the same solvent with BeO was unsuccessful,
The addition of Al,;05 toO LiF-BeFZ-ThF4 (67~l8-l§ mole %) containing cerium
activity caused the precipitation of ThF, without any detectable removal
of cerium activity from solutlon.

These experiments show that exchange reactions for reprocessing molten-
salt reactor fuels are in many cases adversely affected by essential con-
stituents in the fuels. The presence of thorium and beryllium, for example,
interferes with exchange reactions involving CeQO, and HfC. Further searches

for suitable exchange agents will include the rare-earth carbides.

Fig. 2.2,11. Diffusion Coefficients of Cr>! in Various Nickel-Base Alloys.

a high-temperature investigation conducted on similar alloys by Russian
investigators,? are shown for comparison.

It has been found that grain size, and therefore the annealing history
prior to the diffusion experiments, has a marked effect on the diffusion
coefficients. For example, photomicrographs of Inconel specimens H; and
H, revealed that the average grain size was much greater in H; than in H,.
The effect of annealing conditions is easily seen by comparing curves 5
and 7 of Fig. 2.2.11 and also the individual values for H; and H,. An ad-
ditional amnealing effect is manifest in the reproducibility of diffusion
behavior. The data of curve 7 (specimens annealed at 800°C) tend to show
a higher degree of scattering than those of curve 5 (specimens annealed
at 1150°C), which suggests that an 800°C annealing temperature fails to

eliminate grain variations which might exist between specimens.

The over-all diffusion coefficients obtained for INOR-8 specimens are
shown as points on curve 6 of Fig. 2.2.11. At temperatures greater than
700°C, the INOR-8 coefficients are of the same magnitude as the Inconel
coefficients. This means that the rates of chromium diffusion in INOR-8
are approximately 7/15 of the rates in Inconel, at least at higher temper-
atures. The ratio 7/15 corresponds to the ratio of the chromjum concen-
trations in the alloys. |

At temperatures below 700°C, the INOR-8 coefficients appear to fall
considerably below the Inconel coefficients. This sudden drop might afford
a partial explanetion of the encouragingly low molten-salt corrosion rates

exhibited by INOR-8 within the 500 to 700°C temperature range.
Another point of interest is that observed corrosion results fre-

quently represent considerably faster rates than predicted on the basis
of diffusion in the cold zone as the rate-controlling step if the diffu-
sion coefficients from Fig. 2.2.11 are used. This suggests that there is
frequently an extended period of uncompensated oxidation, largely extra-
neous, which precedes the establishment of a steady-state regime. An ex-

treme example of this is described in the next section.

Chemical Analyses of Corrosion Test Loops

Periodiec sampling to follow the corrosion behavior in pumped loop
systems has continued.l® An INOR-8 loop, containing LiF-BeF,~ThF, -UF,
(62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %) has been operating for 9300 hr with a hot-zone tem-
perature of 1300°F and a cold-zone temperature of 1100°F. As shown in Fig.
2.2.12, the chromium content reached a steady-state value of 500 ppm after
about 1000 hr. Sampllng was temporarily dlscontinued after 5000 hr in

order to malntaln a sufflclent fuel volume in the loop, the scheduled test

'period for the loop is l5 OOO hr ‘Thls loop appears to be follow1ng the

By contrast an Inconel 1oop, operatlng under the same condltlons,

-rjhas shown a steady increase in chromium concentration in the fuel as il-
“ cflustrated in Flg 2 2 13. After about 2000 hr some additional fuel was
-'fadded to compensate for the depletlon due to sample removals A slight

sump; this resulted in another dilution because, contrary to intended op-
erating procedures, a large residue of uncirculated salt had remained in
the sump since the original filling. As the chromium concentration has
increased to 4730 ppm in 7000 hr, the uranium concentration has dropped
from 2.8 to 1.5 wt %. This is the behavior predicted for continuing ex-
posure to an extraneous oxidant, such as air, but a rigorous examination
of the system did nét disclose any evidence of a leak or other means of
exposure to air. |

In another loop, of INOR-8, a salt mixture with a higher concentration
of uranium, LiF-BeF-UF, (70-10-20 mole %), has-been pumped under similar
conditions for 5500 hr. The analyses suggest, as shown in Fig. 2.2.14,
that the expected steady-state chromium concentration has not yet been
reached; this is somewhat surprising.

Three additional. test loops, scheduled for periodic sampling, were

placed in operation during the past quarter.

Solubility of CrF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 Mole %)

for FeF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 mole %) is pure FeF,; this is still being veri-
fied. The smaller equilibrium quotients in LiF-BeF, result from stronger

complexing in a more basic solvent.

Hygroscopic Behavior and Dehydration of Breeder Fuels

It has been generally recognized that breeder fuels based on LiF-BeF,
as solvent are very hygroscopic and prone to hydrolysis, but no specific
experimental evaluation of the problem had been made., Some salts can be
dried without extensive hydrolysis, and drying at low temperatures is fre-
quently helpful.12 Trials were made to explore the prospects for removing
water from breeder fuels at low temperatures. Two compositions, LiF-BeF,-
UF, (62-37-1 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %), were
prepared by melting with ammonium bifluoride. These preparations were then
examined by x-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques and found to be
typical samples. Only traces of UO, were present.

A sample of each, ground to 100 mesh and weighing approximately 10 g,
was placed in a nickel crucible and exposed to water-saturated air at room
temperature. The initial rate of weight increase was 2.0% per day for each
composition. As exemplified in Fig. 2.2.15, for the sample with ThF,,
after 40 days the total weight of the sample had increased by 23% and the
rate of increase was 0.32% per day; for the sample without ThF, the corre-
sponding values were 30% and 0.38% per day. These weight percentages are
based on the original weight before exposure. The samples were then placed
in an oven exposed to air at 133°C. Within'24 hr they had returned to the
- orlglnal Welghts. But on COntlnulng the drying to obtain a constant weight,

rthe samples contlnued to drop very slowly to values 0.3 and O. 4%, respec-
' tlvely, below the - startlng'welght Uhfortunately, the salts at this state
‘could not be dlstlnguished from.uncontamlnated fuel by elther x-ray dif-
—jifractlon or petrographlc techniques._ '
| The samples were then melted 1n a ‘vacuum dry box at: 30 to 50 p, and
'a release of gas bubbles was observed There was a further welght loss
of 0 6 and l%, respectlvely, fer the samples W1th and w1thout ThF,. At

areas. The green portion had a higher U0, content than the starting ma-
terials; the black portions were predominantly UO,, and it was estimated
that from 20 to 40% of the uranium had been converted to UO,. Evidently
the uranium had served as an oxide scavenger for the melt.

A second pair of samples was treated as above except that the baking
in air was eliminated. ZEach sample went directly from the humidifier to
the vacuum dry box, where it was dried at 135°C for 2 hr at 30 to 50 p and
then melted. Bubbling occurred as before, and the final samples were 1.5
and l% below the starting weight. The samples fused after vacuum drying
were essentially identical with the fused samples from the first experi-
ment.

It was concluded that the weight losses on prolonged drying'were at
least in part due to the substitution of 0 (wt 16) for 2F (wt 38) as a
consequence of hydrolysis, and that a satisfactory reconditioning of fuel

by a simple drying operation 1s unlikely.

Graphite Compatibility Studies

 

Penetration of Graphite by Molten Fluorides

Continuing studies*? of the permeation of graphite by fuel mixtures
at approximately 1 atm led to the following conclusions.

Early experiments, in which only slight permeation of graphites such
as AGOT occurred, reflected the effect of surface oxide in the graphite
as a source of plugging by the formation of insoluble U0,. Such results
could be altered to give easy permeation by using fuels with a larger oxide
solubility, or by previously removing the oxide by treatment with H,. When
easy permeation was achieved, the relative composition of the fuel in the
graphite was normal, in contrast to therearlier behavior which involved
complications due to oxide precipitation. Long-term tests gave the same
amount of permeation as short‘ones} There was good agreement belween the
permeation obtained by experiment, in the absence of oxide interference,
and the permeation calculated on the basis of the phy51cal interaction be-
tween a nonwetting liquid and a porous medium. '

Tests at lower pressures have been discontinued in favor of more per-
tinent studies at 60 psig, corresponding to reactor conditions. At these
higher pressures the permeation is increased in the expected manner, and
differences in behavior doe to the presence of oxide are usually not ap-
parent. For example, when dealing with a readily perneable graphite, such
as AGOT, little effect is noted as a result of pretreatment with H,.

Attention has recently centered on the amount of permeation to be ex-

pected at 60 p51g in varlous grades of graphlte, typlcal results are shown

~in Table 2.2.3. In the usualfprocedure the graphlte spec1mens were baked

Intercalation of Graphite with Molten Salts

The possibility of intercalation compounds of graphite and molten
fluorides is unlikely, in view of the wide experience in handling fuels
in graphite with no evidence of chemical reaction. However, because of
the prevalence of intercalation of chloride with graphite,l# it was of in-
terest to explore the phenomenon.

Of the 20 principal fission elements, niobium, technetium, and pos-
sibly molybdenum fluorides seemed most likely to exhibit intercalation with
graphite. Most of the other fission-element cations form stable fluorides.
which have been included in melts in graphite crucibles in the course of
other investigations in the Reactor Chemistry Division. Also, the more
noble metals would be expected to exist as the free element and therefore
would not intercalate. While molybdenum is also likely to be uncombined,
it could-possibly form a low-valence fluoride. Fluorides of molybdeﬂum

with a valence lower than six have been studied very little. Niobium forms

a stable pentafluoride which has not yet been evaluated in graphite. Very
little is known of the chemistry of technetium, but it seems to resemble
rhenium more closely than it does manganese.

When treated with molten molybdenum pentafluoride, graphite swelled
to form an intercalate. A graphite tube (3/8-in. OD, 1/4-in. ID) was
sealed in a copper capsule with MoFs; and maintained at 100 to 150°C for
17 hr. The unreacted MoF,; was distilled off by heating to 200°C. As a
result of the treatment part of the graphite tube had crumbled, but the
outside diameter of the intact portion had increased to 1/2 in., Exposure
to water caused the tube to evolve heat and hydrogen fluoride in-a manner
similar to the behavior of pure MoFs.

Molybdenum hexafluoride also gave evidence of intercalation, and a
similar phenomenon has been noted repeatedly with UFg. Such strong oxi-
dizing agents as these could not survive in a reactor, but would be reduced

to a lower valence state by reaction with the containing walls.

Diffusion of Rare-BEarth Fission Products in Graphite

The development of techniques for the study of diffusion of rare
earths in graphite is in progress. Specimens of graphite are to be im-
pregnated with breeder fuels containing a trace quantity of Eul®2,154,
The activity distribution in the graphite will be determined before and
after eXposure to clean fuel salt by microcore drilling of small graphite
samples from the face of a section of the graphite rod. Tube furnaces,
furnace controllers, and Inconel fuel contalners for the leaching operation
have been procured _ Equipmeht for microcore drilling has been designed

Molten Ammonium Bifluoride as a Reagent |
Reactions of molten ammonium bifluoride have been useful for prepar-
ing aiarge number of metal fluorides and ammonium fluometallates.l6 Ad-
ditional reactions of ammonium bifluoride have been explored. '
| Ammonium dichromate dissolved in ammonium bifluoride at 125°C to form
an orange melt which vigorously bubbled and rapidly became green at about
200°C. Ammonium hexafluochromate{III) had formed by the following reac-

tion:

6NH,HF, + (NH,),Cry0n — 2(NH,);CrFe + 7H0T + N1
Chromic acid reacted similarly:

ENH,HF, + 2Cr0; — 2(NH,);CrFg + 6H,01 + NpT + 48R 1

Cerium trifluoride was prepared by the thermal decomposition of a
complex, presumably ammonium hexafluocerate(III), made by reacting molten

ammonium bifluoride with ceric oxide:

Lithium hydroxide monohydrate, enriched in isotope 7, was converted
into the anhydrous'fluoride by fusion with ammonium bifluoride and elimi-

nating volatiles at about 350°C.

Radiation Effects

Corrosion Tests Uhder Radiation

 

Two static-corrosion capsules, made of INOR-8 alloy, were irradiated
in the Materials Testing Reactor. TFuel compbsition and test conditions
are summarized in Table 2.2.4.

Failure became evident from the release of radioactivity into the offé
gas from one of the capsules. The two capsules were installed as a unit;
so it was necessary to terminate the test for both capsules.

The Chromel-Alumel thermocouples attached to the capsules showed ne

sign of failure, and the capsules are being removed from the reactor by

a process designed to preserVe the thermocouples. The capsules will be
examined in the hot cells at ORNL.
Metallographic tests will be made on the metal, chemical analyses will

2.3 FUEL PROCESSING

Emphasis is being placed on modification of the hydrofluorination—
vdlaﬁilization process for application to MSR salts éontaining ThF;; The -
proceés as originally developed was satisfactory for the recovery of_ura-
nium from core and blanket salts in a two-region reactor and for the re-
cycle of L17F and BeF, used in the core fuel. 1 fThere was no provision in
this process, however, for the handling of thorium, which is partlcularly
desirable in core salt, wvhere frequent processing is necessary. The hy-
7drofluorihation~volatilization process has as an attractive feature the
- fact thdt the processed material remains in the fluoride form and thus re-
quires little further treatment before re-use in the reactor. Retentibn
of this feature is one objective of the work.

fThe use of hot aqueous NH,F solution appears definitely'prdmising-for
procéssing'ThF4-bearing fuels, and further work in this directidn'Séems |
apprdpriafe. The possibility of using ClF;-~HF as a solvent for thersimul-
taneous solution of UF, and LiF no longer appears attractive becausé an
appreciable concentration of Cl¥F,; represses the LiF solubility and because
the solubilities of UF, and ThF, are unsatisfactory. The NO,-HF system
appears attractive for the simultaneous dissolution of LiF, BeF,, and UF,,
but it does not show sufficient ThF, solubility.

Thorium Fluoride Solubility in Aqueous NH,F Solutions

An exploratory test indicated that ThF, was soluble to about 5 wt %
in 50 wt % aqueous NH,F solution at the boiling point, which is high enough
to be of interest for processing. Typical fuel salts contain about 60 wt %
TWF,. Experimental data indicated increasing ThF, solubility with increas-
ing temperature and increasing NH,F concentration, although some @ifficul—
ties were encountered in sampling solutions at or near the boiling point.
The ThF, solubility in 50% solution at 105°C was 49 mg/ml in a sample pi-
petted from a solution in which the solids had been allowed to settle, and
" was 43 mg/ml in a sample filtered through sintered nickel. The solubility
dropped rapidly with decreasing temperature, to about 12 mg/ml at 60°C and
4.9 mg/mlfat_25°c. In 43% NH,F solution at 25°C the solubility was only

"y

0.4 mg/ml. The solid formed when these NH,F solutions of ThF, were cooled
or diluted was not ThF,, but rather a compound (or compounds) involving
NH,F and ThF,. The compositions of solids formed under various conditions
are being determined. |

The investigation is being extended to measurements of the solubili=-
ties of the other fuel components — LiF, BeF,, UF,, and rare earths — both
individually and collectively. The effect of other components on the ThF,

solubility has not been measured.

Fuel -Component Solubility in ClF,-HF

Mixed ClF5-HF solvent appears unsatisfactory for a one-step process
to dissolve both uranium and LiF. Further experiments confirmed the ob-
servations reported previous],'y2 that Cl¥s; in HF causes_a‘drastic reduction
in the LiF and BeF, solubilities with MSR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,,
62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %). The presence of significant amounts of C1F; in HF
decreased the solubility of LiF from ~100 to ~20 g/kg, and of BeF, from
30-40 to < 5 g/kg. Uranium solubilities were generally about 0.25 g/kg;
although significant, they are_too low to dissolve all the uranium as-
sociated with the dissolved LiF and BeF,. Rare-earth and thorium fluorides
are very insoluble in these solutions; rare-earth solublilities were in the
range 0.0001 to 0.0005 mole %, based on dissolved salt.

The U(IV), which has a low solubility, 1s probably not converted under
these conditions to the highly soluble U(VI). Operation of the ClF,-HF
system at a_higher temperaturerend pressure to obtain conversion appears

~ that values would be higher at NO, concentrations above 10 mole %; uranium
solubilities are presumably high in the absence of LiF and BeF,. Thorium
solubilities were generally low, and rare-earth solubilities were mostly
about 0.001 to 0.002 mole %, based on dissolved salt (the most'reliable'
value, from an experiment discussed below, was 50-fold less than this).

With 2.7 mole % NO, (Table 2.3.1) the BeF, solubility was unexpectedly
high, corresponding almost exactly with the NO, content on a mole basis.

The LiF solubility was only about half as high as expected. The uranium

solubilities account for about one-third of the uranium associated with

the dissolved salt except with 10 mole % NO,, where it accounts for all =
of it. With 5 mole % NO, the total salt solubility is a little over 100
g/liter, which is a reasonable value for processing.

In another experiment with approximately 2 mole % NO, in HF, the so-
lution was decanted from the undissolved excess salt and both were analyzed
separately. The LiF, BeF,, uranium, and thorium solubilities were 33, 52,
0.5, and 0.04 g/kg, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the values
reported above. The NO,-HF solution dissolved 56% of the LiF, 79 of the
BeF,, 5% of the uranium, and 62% of the cesium activity, but only 0;086%"_
of the cerium and 0.05% of the promethium. The much larger samples per-
mitted more accurate determinations of the rare-earth activities than in
the experiments reported in Table 2.3.1. The total rare-earth solubilities
were 0.000042 mole % calculated from the cerium determination and 0.000029
mole % calculated from the promethium determinations, based on dissolved

LiF and BeF,. 1 - e

The above results were obtained at room temperature. As NO, was added
to HF, the boiling point rose rapidly to about 56°C at about 25 mole % NO,
and then dropped to the boiling point of NO, (21°C) with about 60 mole %
NO,, &t which point a second phase appeared. The second phase appeared
to be nearly pure NO,. Salt solubilities would probably be significantly
highef‘at the boiling points, since salt solubilities in other HF systems

have been observed to increase with temperature.
