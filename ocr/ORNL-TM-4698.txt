SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT

A water-mercury system was used to study the effect of geometric
variations on mass transfer rates in rectangular contactors similar to
those proposed for the MSBR fuel reprocessing scheme. Since mass trans-
fer rates were not accurately predicted by the Lewis correlation, other
correlations were investigated. The following correlation was found to

fit the experimental results:

60 k. L n n
— 11 o 2088 (Reﬂ(%) (D.S + Tg')
V1 1 1

Mass transfer rates are being measured in a fluoride salt~-bismuth
contactor. A 6~in.-diam mild steel contactor has been installed in the
flow—-through reductive extraction facility for this purpose. Experimen-
tal results from these runs indicate that the mass transfer rates in the
salt-bismuth system fall between the Lewis correlation and the modified

correlation given above.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS: CONTINUATION
OF ENGINEERING~SCALE EXPERIMENTS

Four engineering-scale experiments (MTE-1, -2, -2B, and -3) to study
the steps in the metal transfer process were completed prior to the ter-
mination of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program early in 1973. The last
experiment, MTE-3, used salt and bismuth flow rates that were 1% of the
estimated flow rates reguired for processing a 1000~-MW(e) reactor. We
plan to continue these studies in a new experiment, designated as MTE-3B

{identical to MTE-3).

The carbon steel vessels used in experiment MTE-3 are being replaced
with new vessels. Fresh carrier salt, bismuth, and lithium chloride will

be used.
vi

Results of measurements of the mass transfer coefficients for radium,
europium, lanthanum, and neodymium, cobtained during operation of experi-
ment MTE-3, indicated that many of the coefficients were lower than pre-
dicted by literature correlations. The reason for this is presently not
known; consequently, additional studies are reguired in order to obtain
data necessary for determining the size and type of equipment required
for removal of the rare-~earth fission products from molten-salt reactor

fuel.

Examination of the MTE-3 carbon steel vessels indicated that no
serious corrosion had occurred on the inside surfaces of the vessels
exposed to salt and bismuth during 1 year of operation at 650°C (although
the oxidation-resistant coating on the outside surface of the vessel
failed to completely protect the carbon steel). Photomicrographs of the
bismuth phases indicate that the surfaces in contact with the salts are

enriched in thorium and iron.
CONTINUCUS FLUQORINATOR DEVELOPMENT

Autoresistance heating tests have been continued in the fluorinator
mock-up using LiF-BermThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) salt. The squipment was
returned to operating condition, and five experiments were run. Although
correct steady—state operation was not achieved, the results were

encouraging.

A two-dimensional electrical analog was constructed to study current
flow through the electrode sidearm and other critical areas of the test
vessel. The model used constant-resistance paper cut in the shape of
the sidearm. An electric field was produced between isopotential lines
of conductive silvexr paint connected electrically to a constant-voltage
source. The resulting flux lines were measured using a high-impedance
voltmetex. These studies indicate that no regions of abnormally high
current density existed in the first nine runs with the present auto-
resistance heating equipment. Localized heating had previously been the
suspected cause for the failure to achieve proper operation of this

equipment.
1. TINTRODUCTION

A molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be fueled with a molten
fluoride mixture that will circulate through the blanket and core regions
of the reactor and through the primary heat exchangers. We are developing
processing methods for use in a close-coupled facility for removing fis-
sion products, corrosion products, and fissile materials from the molten

fluoride mixture.

In January 1973, the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) Program was inter-
rupted for about a year. The program was reinstated at ORNL again in

January 1974, and the study of several operations associated with MSER

processing was resumed. The remaining parts of this report discuss:

(1} development of mechanically-agitated salt-metal con-
tactors,

(2) examination of the vessels in which metal transfer
experiment MTE-3 was carried out, and

(3) experiments of autoresistance heating of molten salts
conducted in a mock~up of a frozen wall fluorinator.

This work was carried out in the Chemical Technology Division during the

period January through June 1974.

2. SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT

J. A. Klein

A critical step in the proposed MSBR processing scheme is the extrac-
tion of rare earths from the fluoride fuel carrier salt to an interme~
diate bismuth stream. One possible approach would be to use a mechanically-
agitated nondispersing contactor in which bismuth and fluoride salt phases
are agitated in order to facilitate the mass transfer of rare earths

across the salt-bismuth interface.

During the period covered by this report we have correlated mass
transfer coefficients which were measured in a water-mercury system with
those which were collected from the open literature for agueous-organic

systems. We have completed four experiments in which mass transfer
coefficients in a fluoride salt-bismuth system were measured. This work

is discussed in the following sections.

2.1 Background

.1, : . : .
Lewis 1investigated mass transfer rates in mechanically-agitated
nondispersing contactors, all of the same size, using several agqueous-

organic systems. He fitted his results with the following empirical

 

equation:
1.65
60 k_L n
1 . -6 2
= 6.76 + 10 (L) | Re, + Re_. —— + 1 , (1)
Vv 1 2N

where

- \ NL p
Re = Reynolds number = - ,
N = stirrer speed = rps,
I. = stirrer length = cm,
k = mass transfer coefficient, om/sec,
- : 3
o = density = g/cm’,
n = viscosility = g/cm-sec,
: . . . 2
v = Xkinematic viscosity = n/p = cm /sec, and
1,2 = phase being considered.
For the case in which N1 = N2 and Ll = Lz, the above eguation can be
reduced to the form
1.65
60 kL e 0, °
wmee——— = 6,76 % 10 (L) jRe_ {1 + —— ] + L. (2)
vy 1 °q

For Lewilis' work, where the densities of the various phases varied from

3 . :
0.8 to 1.2 g/cm” but the stirrer length was kept constant, this correla-
tion effectively uses only the Reynolds number of the phase being con-

sidered.
2 . . . X -
McManamey correlated his own data with Lewis's results by the fol-
lowing ‘expression, which is similar to that used by Lewis but includes the

Schmidt number:

 

00 k. L .. Re

n 1 n Re. 1
1 1 L
where
S¢ = Schmidt number = n/oD, and
- . i s 2
D = diffusion coefficient = cm /sec.

Note that the dependence on the Schmidt number is fairly weak. This equa-

tion can be reduced to:

60 koL

) —
= (0,102 (L) {Re )O'J 1 + L (5c.) 0.37 . (4)
vl 1 5 1

Again, the Reynolds number of the phase being considered is the domi-
nant factor, although it is raised to a different power from that used by

Lewis (i.e., 0.9 rather than 1.65).

3 : : . . . .
Mayers developed a slightly more involved correlation of the

following form:

60 k_ L na\L.9 n.\=2.4
2 : ~
-~f£~£ =  0.1896 (Rel ReQ)l/L'<w£> <0.6 + f2> (Scl) 176 . {5)
Y1 b "1
This equation reduces to:
. -2, 0.5
0 5t i - i,y ~1/6 {72 o
"“’“"\’)’““‘“‘“ = (0.18956 (Rel) (;r‘) <0.6 + “‘:") (Scl) ’ (;-w} . (6)
1 1 _ N1 71

This correlation indicates that the viscosity and density of each
phase affect the mass transfer ccoefficient. This correlation is based
3

on data covering a limited range of densities (0.8 to 1.2 g/cm’).
All of the above equations corrxelate the large amount of aqueous-
organic data very well; the Mayers and McManamey correlations provide a
slightly better fit than the Lewis correlation. However, in all cases,
1 and n, were the only parameters varied to any significant extent.
The other variables were either held constant or were varied over very

N, 7
small ranges.

2.2 Experimental Studies Using Water-Mercury Systems

r

Previous reports have shown that a water-mercury contactor using

the reaction

+ 2+
Pb2 [HZO] + Zn [Hg] - Zni{lg] + Zn [HZO]

is suitable for studying mass transfer rates in this system. These stud-
ies have indicated that, although results were generally similar to the
predictlons of the Lewis correlation, significant deviations from the
correlation do exist. 1In order to reconcile these discrepancies, we

have studied the effect of geometric variations on mass transfer rates

in rectangular contactors similar to those provosed for the MSBR fuel

reprocessing scheme.

2.2.1 Experimental procedures

 

Three rectangular contactors were fabricated in the followling sizes:
5-1/4 in. x 7 in., 7-3/4 in. x 10-1/2 in., and 11-5/8 in. x 12-1/2 in.
The two smaller vessels were constructed of Plexiglas, while the larger

was constructed of stainless steel.

Agitator blades having diameters of 3, 5, and 7 in. were fabricated.
One set of blades had a constant height of 3/4 in.; another set had a
constant blade diameter/blade height ratio of 4.0. All of the blades

were four-vaned straight paddles.

Each contactor was used to make a large number of experimental runs
in which the phase volume, blade size, and agitation rates were varied.

Agitation rates were limited to values below the point at which dispersion
of the phases became apparent. The paddles used in the two phases were

identical in sigze.

Details of sampling and analysis of data are included in a previous

report.

2.2.2 Results

Results obtained using the 7~3/4- by 10-1/2~in. contactor and a 5000-
cm volume for each phase are compared with the three correlations in Figs.
1-3. Similar results were obtained for other contactor sizes. Table 1
gives the data for the water-mercury system. Phase 1 1s mercury; phase

2 is water.

Experimental mass transfer coefficients ranged from 5 to 30% of the
values predicted by the Lewis correlation. The slope of the data deviated
significantly from that of the Lewis correlation; it agreed very closely
with the slope of the McManamey correlation, although experimental values
were only 15 to 30% of predicted values. Thus it appears that the
McManamey correlation 1s only slightly better than the Lewis correlation.
The slope of the Mayers correlation also matches that of the data very

well but underpredicts experimental results by 40 to 50%.

The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, as well as the remainder of the
data, indicate that the mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the
stirrer length, L, ralsed to a power different from that associated with
the Reynolds number. The exponent of L is 1 in the Mayers correlation
rather than approximately 2 as in the other correlations. This change
improves the correlation; however, it also seems to overcompensate to

some extent.

Using the Mayers correlation as the best of the existing correlations,
we added two additional terms to include the effect of the density ratio
of the two phases (pl/p2) and a dimension ratic (L/H), where H is the
height of an individual phase. The tank size or phase volume was shown

to be unimportant except in the manner in which it affects H.

The constant was determined using the aqueous-organic systems as well

The modified correlation fits the experimental water-mercury data

2.3 Comparison of Correlations with MTE-3 Data

A comparison of the mass transfer coefficients reported6 from the
experiment MTE-3 with both the Lewis and modified correlations was made
in order to test the fit of the correlations with an actual salt-bismuth
system. Results of the comparison are shown in Table 2. The data indi-

fer coefficients, the modified correlation usually underpredicts them —

salt-bismuth flow~through facility. This experimental system (Fig. 5)
allows (1) pericdic cleaning of the feed salt and metal, (2) removal of
surface contamination from the salt-metal interface, and (3) variation
of the distribution ratio of the material of interest between the salt

and the bisuuth.

2.4.1 Experinmental eguipment

 

The new stirred-interface contactor makes use of the existing piping,
equipment, and instrumentation present in the mild-steel reductive extrac-
tion system. The contactor, which is geometrically identical to that used
with the water-mercury system, consists of a 6~in.-diam carbon-steel
vessel containing four l-in.-wide vertical baffles. The agitator con-
sists of two 3~in.-diam stirrers with four noncanted blades. A 3/4~in.
overflow at the interface allows fdr removal of interfacial films, as well
as the salt and metal outfleow. The system is operated in essentially the
same manner as was emploved with the packed column.7”ll The salt and bis-
muth phases were equilibrated prior to an experiment. After the salt and
metal phases had been transferred to the feed tanks, 97Zr and 237U
tracers were added to the salt. With this technique the rates at which
zirconium and uranium tracer transfer from the salt to the bismuth could

be measured in a system that was otherwise at chemical equilibrium.

K, = . , and (24)

The above equations can then be used to calculate maszs transfer coef-
ficients from experimental results (i.e., the ratio of tracer concentra-

tiong in any two of the salt or bismuth flows).

Approximately 1l0-liter volumes of salt and bismuth were available,
allowing flow rxates up to 200 cc/min. Experimental values of D, the
distribution coefficient for the material of interest, will vary somewhat;

however, 1f D is made large enough, Egs. (23), (24), and (25) reduce to:

Uncertainties in the distribution coefficient do not affect the accuracy
of the overall mass transfer coefficient. However, when D is very large,
the overall mass transfer coefficient is essentially the individual salt-
phase coefficient since resistance to mass transfer in the metal phase is
negligible in comparison. This is seen by allowing D to assume large

values in Eg. {(11).

2.4.3 Experimental results

 

Four runs have been completed to date. All runs were performed in a

similar manner except as discussed below.

While the fluoride salt and bismuth are in contact in T5, the treat-
ment vessel, a sufficient quantity of bervllium is electrolytically
added to the salt to give any desired uranium distribution coefficient
(Du)' Since it is impossible to completely exclude oxidants, beryllium
needs to be added periodically in order to maintain a relatively high
distribution coefficient. Periodic transfers of salt and bismuth through-

out the system are also performed to maintain the system at equilibrium.
19

Prior to a run, the salt and bismuth phases were separated by pres-
surizing T5 and transferring salt to T3 and bismuth to Tl. Approximately

7 mCi of 97Zr—-97Nb and 50 to 100 mCi of 237U 0. were then allowed to dis-

378
solve in the salt phase for about 2 hr. Activities of the 952r and 2360,

which were also present, were negligible.

Salt and bismuth streams were passed through the contactor vessel by
controlled pressurization of both Tl and T3. The contactor was maintained
at approximately 590°C for each run. Both phases exit through a common
overflow line, separate, and return to tanks T2 and T4. Periodic sampling
of both exit streams was accomplished by means of flowing stream samplers
installed in the exit lines from the contactor.

samples taken were first counted for 237U and 97Zr, then pulverized,
dissolved, and counted again for 2378 (at this point, 97Zr had decayed to
a very low level). Counting twice was done in order to correct for the
self-absorption in the solid salt or bismuth samples of the 207.95-kev 8
from 237U. No similar correction for the self-absorption of the 97Zr—97Nb
{(743.37 keV and 658.18 keV B“, respectively) activity could be done because
of the shorter half-life. A complete wet analysis was also run on each

sample. Mass transfer rates could then be calculated from the ratios of

tracer concentrations as discussed previously.

Run TSMC-]1 was mainly a preliminary experiment designed to test the
procedure. In this run, the salt and bismuth flows were approximately
200 cc/min and the stirrer rate was 123 rpn. Unfortunately, the distri-
bution coefficient was too low to effect any significant mass transfer;

thus mass transfer rates could not be accurately determined.

Run TSMC-2 was performed without difficulty. The salt and bismuth
flow rates were 228 and 197 c¢¢/min, respectively. The distribution coef-
ficient for this run was determined to be approximately 1.5, which was

ltower than desired but high encugh to give meaningful results.

A bismuth line failure occurred immediately preceding run TSMC~3.
During the resulting delay for repairs, the 97Zr decayed and only the
237U tracer could be used. The remainder of the run went smoothly. The
salt and bismuth flow rates were 166 and 173 co/min, respectively; the

stirrer rate was 162 rpm. A high Du (> 40) was maintained for this run.
20

In run TsMC-4, flow rates of 170 and 144 cc/min were set for the
salt and bismuth flows; a stirrer rate of 205 rpm was maintained. Both
distribution coefficients as determined from samples taken before, after,
and during the run were greater than 200. [This value is sufficiently
large that Egs. (26-28) are valid.] Large distribution coefficients can-—
not be determined precisely due to the inability to determine very small
amounts of uranium in the sali phase. No significant problems were

encountered during this run.

Results for these four runs are shown in Table 3. As noted previ-
ously, results from run TSMC~1 are not meaningful. The three egquations
for determining the mass transfer rates [Egs. (26), (27), and (28)] were

used to calculate values for the mass transfer coefficient.

2.5 Contactor Area Required for MSBR Processing Plant

An estimate of the area required for a one~stage contactor for
removing rare earths from the fuel salt can be made by using the mass

transfer coefficients measured in the salt-bismuth flow-through facility.

The flowsheet assumes a total reactor fuel salt volume of 47,500
liters, with a salt flow of 55 cc¢/sec; this would give a 10~day removal
time for the salt. Of the rare earths, cerium has the shortest removal
time (16.6 days). Therefore, approximately a 60% efficiency is needed

for the proposed stirred interface contactor.

From Eg. (18),

 

CS/C = — = 0.60 (29)

if D 1s made large and the following reference values are used:

F2 = 780 cc/sec = bismuth flow rate,
Fl = b5 cg/sec = salt flow rate, and
area =

36.7/KS.

Substituting values of mass transfer coefficient from Table 3 into Eq.

(29) gives the following results:

2
A = 9 ft ; and
if KS = 0.054 cm/sec = highest experimental wvalue,
2
A = 0.7 ft .

These values for the area of the proposed contactor would seem to be guite
reasonable. However, the actual area which would be reqguired for a con-
tactor in a processing plant would be somewhat larger because the distri-
bution coefficient in the contactor would not be as large as was assumed

in the above calculation.

2.6 Conclusions

A new correlation has been developed to account for the effect of
large density differences and variations in the stirrer length/phase
depth ratio. The correlation given in Eg. (7) accurately predicts the
experimental results for the water-mercury system as well as the results
for the aqueous-organic systems reported in the literature. A flow-
through, stirred-interface contactor was installed in the mild-steel
reductive extraction facility. Mass transfer rates for a molten fluoride
salt--hismuth system were measured using this contactor. These measured
rates fell between the predictions made by the Lewis and modified corre-
lations, except when high stirrer rates were used; in the latter cases,
high mass transfer rates were obtained. If these values of mass transfer
coefficient prevail, the required mass transfer area in an MSBR processing

plant would not be unreasonably large.

3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS: CONTINUATION
OF ENGINEERING-SCALE EXPERIMENTS

H. C. Savage

The present processing flowsheetl3 uses the metal transfer process
for removing rare earths from molten-salt breeder reactor fuel salt. In
this process, fuel salt that is free of wranium and protactinium but con-
tains the rare earths is countercurrently contacted with bismuth containing
reductant to extract the rare earths into the bismuth. The bismuth stream,
which contains the rare earths aﬁd thorium, is then countercurrently con-
tacted with LiCl. Because of favorable distribution coefficients, signif-
icant fractions of the rare earths transfer to the LiCl along with a
negligible amount of thorium. The final steps of the process consist in
extracting the rare earths from the LiCl by contact with bismuth having

lithium concentrations of 5 and 50 at. %.

Four engineeriﬁgwscale experiments (MTE-1l, -2, -2B, -3) have been
carried out to study the steps in the metal transfer process and to obtain
information such as mass transfer rates of the rare earths between the
salt and bismuth phases necessary for determining the size and type of
equipment needed for the process. The results obtained in these experi-

, 14~17 .
ments were reported previously. The selective removal of rare earths

(lanthanum and 147Nci) from MSBR fuel carrier salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-
BeF2~ThF4) and transfer to Li-Bi acceptor alloy were demonstrated in
experiments MTE~1, -2, and -2B. HMTE-3 was a larger-scale ‘experiment,
which included features such as mechanical agitation of the salt and
metal phases to improve mass transfer rates of the rare earths across the
three salt-metal interfaces. This experiment was designed to measure the
mass transfer rates across the three interfaces as a function of agitator

spead for comparison with calculated values using a mass transfer corre~

lation developed by J. B. Lewis.l8

Experiment MTE-3 (shown schematically in Fig. 6) consisted of three
interconnected vessels: a 1l4~in.-diam fuel salt reservoir, a 10-in.-
- diam salt-metal contactor, and a 6-in.~diam rare~earth stripper. The salt-

metal contactor was divided into two compartments that were interconnected

through an opening in the bottom of the divider by a pool of bismuth con-
taining thorium and lithium. The stripper contained an Li-Bi solution.

A mechanical agitator was used in each compartment of the contactor and
in the Li-Bi stripper to promote mass transfer across the ithree salt-
metal interfaces. All vessels were fabricated of carbon steel and had

an oxidation-resistant coating of nickel aluminide on the ocutside sur-

faces.

The purpose of experiment MTE~3 was to evaluate the contactor and
stripper described above for use in removing rare earths from molten-
salt reactor fuel. Fluoride and LiCl flow rates were about 1% of those
requlred for removing rare earths from a 1000~MW(e) MSBR. The operating
temperature was about 650°C; the Qhases were 72-16-12 mole % LiF—BeFZwThF4
fuel carrier salt, 0.13 at. % Th~Bi sclution containing about 100 wt ppm
of lithium as reductant, and a 5 at. % Li-Bi sclution in the stripper.
In this process, the rare earths are extracted from the car:ier salt into
the Th~Bi solution. The rare earths are extracted from the Th-Bi into

molten LiCl and are subsequently stripped from the LiCl into Bi-Li alloy.

Mass transfer coefficients for radium, europium, lanthanum, and nec-—
dymium were measured during 13 runs for comparison with values predicted
by literature correlation,l8 Agitator speeds of 100 to 400 rpm were used.
Many of the mass transfer coefficients were found to be substantially
lower (4 to 15%) than_predicted.19 Termination of the MSR Pfcgram nre-
cluded further investigation of the mass transfer rates and postoperative
examination of the MTE-3 equipment to determine the reason for the lower-
than-~expected transfer rates. The system was shut down and placed in
standby condition, with all salt and metal phases frozen, in February

1973.

We plan to continue studies of the mass transfer rates of rarve earths
between fuel carrier salt, bismuth, and LiCl in a new experiment desig-

nated as MTE-3B. New vessaels, salts, and bismuth will be used.
26

3.1 Examination of MTE-3 Equipment and Materials

Metal transfer experiment MITE-3 was malntained at approximately
650°C for about 1 year (v8700 hr). During the final run (EU-9), in which
an agitator speed of 400 rpm was employed, Fluoride salt was entrained
into the LiCl in the contactor17 (v10 wt % fluoride into the LiCl}). This
resulted in the transfer of thorium into the LiCl, €from which it was sub-
segquently extracted inte the Li-Bi solution in the stripper. After run
EU~9 the experiment was shut down, cooled to room temperature, and placed

in standby. (This was in February 1973 when the MSR Program was termi-

nated. )}

Removal of the three agitator assemblies for examination of the
molybdenum shafts and agitator blades and, if feasible, reuse in experi-
ment MTE-3B required that the salt and metal phases in the contactor and
stripper vessels be melted. After all heater circuits and recalibration
of instrumentation had been checked, the contactor and stripper vessels
were heated to approximately 650°C and the agitator assemblies were
removed without difficulty. The agitator ports were immediately secaled
with blank flange cover plates and the vessels cooled to ambient tempera-
ture. During the removal of the agitators, an argon atmosphere was main-

tained in the vessels.

A cursory visual examination indicated that the molybdenum shaft and
blades were in good condition. No areas of heavy corrosion attacks were
noted. However, some areas of the shaft and blades contain deposits of
salt and metal which must be removed for a more-detailed and meaningful
examination. Therefore, whether or not the molybdenum agitator can or
should be used in experiment MTE-3B has not been determined. (Note:

The shaft on the agitator from the LiCl side of the contactor was acci-
dently broken, after removal, in an attempt to remove the pin holding the
molybdenum shaft to the agitator drive unit.) Figure 7 is a photograph

of the molybdenum agitator shafts as removed. Note that the agitator from
the LiCl side of the contactor shaft is hollow at the break point. This
1s not in accord with the engineering drawing for the shaft (M12172 CD

027 E Rev. 5), which indicates a solid construction at the broken areas.

We removed the thermal insulation from MTE-3 and some of the stainless
steel shim stock surrounding the electric heaters. The outside surfaces
of the carbon steel vessels (ASTM-AL06 Grade B with a nominal composition
of Fe; C, 0.30% max; Mn, 0.29-1.06%; P, 0.048% max; S, 0.058% max; Si,
0.10% min) were found to be badly oxidized due to failure of the oxidation-
resistant coating. These vessels had been maintained at v650°C for approx-
imately 1 vear (8700 hr). The depth of oxidation was estimated to be
1/16 in. or less and thus did not significantly affect the mechanical
integrity of the vessels (initial wall thickness = 3/8 in.) at the oper-—
ating conditions of MTE-3. The oxidation-resistant protective coating
consisted of 0.015- to 0.020-in.-thick nickel aluminide® applied by flame
spraying with wire flame spray eguipment. We contacted a representative
of METCO, who recommended that a much better coating would be obtained by
using a nickel-chromium alloy with aluminum composite in powder form
(METCO No. P443+-10) applied with plasma spray equipmenlt. Test sections
of carbon steel pipe with the two coatings described above have been pre-

pared for comparative evaluation.

We obtained samples of the salts (fuel carrier salt and LiCl) and
bismuth from the MTE-3 vessels by removing a 2-in.-diam plug across each
salt-metal interface. A layer of material of different structure (Vv1/3
in. thick) appeared to exist between the LiCl--Li~Bi phases in the
stripper, whereas no comparable film was seen at the interfaces bebtween
the LiCl--Bi~Th and the fuel carrier salt--Bi-Th phases in the contactor.
Corrosion of the inside surfaces of the 2-in.~diam vessel wall seclions

appeared minimal on visual examination of the 2~-in.-diam plugs.

A small (v1/8- by vl/4-in.) sample cof bismuth was taken at each of
the three metal-salt interfaces for metallographic examination. Each
section included the bismuth surface in contact with the salt phase.
Photomicrographs of these samples are shown in Figs. 8-10. As seen,
there i3 some foreign material at each surface of the bismuth which was
in contact with the salt phase (fluid carrier salt and LiCl). Whethex

this material was present during operation of metal transfer experiment

MTE-3 or segregated at the surface when the phases were cooled without

agitation is unknown.

Scanning electron microprobe analyses were performed to identify the
material seen at the interfacial surfaces of the bismuth. Results are
shown in Figs. 11-13. The bismuth in contact with the fluoride carrier
salt contained a surface layer which was enriched with thorium and iron.
Thorium and iron, along wilth some manganese and lanthanum (lanthanum was
one of the rare earths used to measure mass transfer rates in MTE-3), were
identified at the surface of the bismuth in contact with the LiCl in the
contactor. TIron and thorium were alsco identified at the surface of the
bismuth in contact with the LiCl in the stripper. The Bi-~Th and the Li-
Bi phases, as well as the salt phases, contained significant amounts of
iron (see Table 4), undoubtedly as a result of corrosion of the carbon
steel vessels. A petrographic examination was made of a sample of the
fluoride salt from the contactor at a point near the Bi~Th phase and the
tank wall. This examination indicated that the sample consisted princi-
pally of crystals of BLiFwThF4. According to the phase diagram of the
72-16-12 mole % LiF“BerﬂThF4, 3LiF~ThF4 would be expected to crystallize
from solution on cooling--especially at or near the tank wall. No oxides

were found in the sample.

A section of the Li-Bi--LiCl across the interfacial area from Lhe
stripper ({(which included the laver of material of different structure
between the Li-Bi and the LiCl) is being examined by scanning electron

microscopy. No results have been obtained as yet.

3.2 Status of Experiment MTE-3B

We plan to continue measuring the mass fransfer rates of rare earths
between salt and bismuth in a new experiment, which is designated as
MTE~3B. The wvessels, salts, and bismuth that were used for MTE-3 will
be discarded. New carbon steel vessels are being fabricated, with mid-
June being the estimated completion date. After the vessels have been
received, assembly of the equipment will begin. Based on the results of

MTE-3, initial experiments will be made at agitator speeds up to 300 rpm.

4. CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT

R. M. Counce J. R. Hightower, Jr.

4.1 Autoresistance Heating Tests

A nonradicactive experiment to demonstrate that a layer of frozen salt
will provide protection against corrosion in a continuous fluorinator
requires a heat source in the molten salt which is immune toc attack by
the gaseous fluorine. We have previously shown20 that autoresistance
heating of the salt is feasible, and have designed and built a fluorinator
mock-up to test a design for an electrode sidearm to keep the electrode

cut of the fluorine stream.’

Five experiments (AHT-1 through -5) were run in the fluorinator mock-
up before the MSR Program was interrupted (between January. 1973 and
January 1974). This equipment rémained idle, but intact, during this
period. The equipment has now been returned to operating condition, and

testing of autoresistance heating in it has been resumed.

Experiments AHT3-6A, ~6B, ~7, ~8, and -2 were carried out during this
report pericd. In runs AHT3-6A, -6B, -8, and -9, the autoresistance
heating was begun when the wall temperature of the test section was cooled
to 350°C, the lowest temperature at which liquid can exist in the Lif-

BeF2—ThF4 system. No internal heating was attempted in run AHT3-7.

The circuit resistance during cooldown in runsg AHT3-6A and -6B
remained at about 0.01 teo 0.03 § until the wall temperature dropped to
approximately 500°C, where the fuel salt begins to freeze. As the wall
temperature decreased from 500°C to 350°C, the resistance increased; at
about 350°C, it increased dramatically. Presumably, this occurred because
the salt film becomes completely nonconducting only when the temperature
is sufficiently low to preclude the existence of ligquid. In the LiF»BeF?w

ThF4 system, no liquid can exist below 350°C.

When the wall temperature reached 350°C, autoregistance heating was
started. We had planned to increase the current through the salt until

the wall temperatures indicated steady state. However, steady state was
38

not attained. Instead, the resistance through the conducting path
decreased suddenly from 0.5 & in run 6A and 0.4 { in run 6B to zero,
indicating a loss of film integrity and subsequent shorting of the heating

current.

Increases in the wall temperatures at the time of shorting indicated
that the shorting occurred near the bend in the electrode sidearm nearest
tc the electrode. This was thought to be due to localized high current
densities. The sidearm and other critical areas of the test vessel have
been modeled to determine if localized high current densities might exist.

The modeling procedure and results are discussed in the next section.

In run AHT3-7, the wall temperature of the test vessel was lowered to
425°C and the remaining ligquid salt was transferred to the feed tank.
Internal heat generation was not attempted. The frozen salt wall was
inspected after the equipment had been cooled to room temperature. The
salt was almost completely frozen across the vessel just above the lower
sidearm inlet, although a much thinner salt layer (v3/4 in.) was present
just below the inlet and higher in the test section. This freezing was
caused by contact of the unheated argon with the liquid salt. Heaters
have been added on the argon lines to the test vessel to help alleviate

this problem.

After the effects of the cold argon had been reduced, the maximum
resistance durilng autoresistance heating increased dramatically in AHT3-6A
and -6B to 0.5 and 0.4 I, respectively. In run AHT3-8, which was made
after heaters had been added on the argon lines, the maximum resistance
was 2.4 @ during autoresistance heating. During the period of autoresis-
tance heating (25 min), the current was increased from 5 A to 24 A. The
salt temperatures continued to decrease during this time but appeared to
be approaching a constant value (above room temperature). After 25 min
of autoresistance heating, the resistance suddenly decreased while the
temperature rose rapidly in the bend of the electrcde sidearm near the
electrode, indicating that this was the area in which the salt film had

malted.

Experiment AHT3-9 was performed using the same procedure as before,

except that the current was limited to a maximum of 17 A. The electrode
39

in these tests consisted of a 1/2-in. Inconel tube extending to the inter-
section of the centerlines of the vertical section and the sloping section
of the electrode sidearm (see ref. 21). 1In the first nine runs, the salt
depth in the electrode sidearm above the end of the tube wés measured by
bubbling argon through the tube. Before run AHT3-9 was started, this
measurement had indicated that the salt level in the sidearm was lower
than that measured in the main compartment (gas-salt contacting zone) of
the test vessel. Also, abnormaliy high resistances were observed during
this run. The highést resistance during autoresistance heating in AHT3-9
was 4.3 . At the end of the experiment, the salt was transferred to the
feed tank from the test vessel. The captive volume of salt in the elec-
trode sidearm could not be removed. After the equipment had been allowed
to cool, the electrode was removed and examined. The lower & in. of the
1/2-in. Inconel tube of which the electrode was made was missing. Thus

far, we have no explanation for this phenomenon.

4.2 Distribution of Current bDengities in the
Autoresistance Heating Egquipment

We have constructed an electrical analog of the electrode sidearm in
order to determine if there are regions of localized high current density
which might be causing the frozen salt film near the electrode to melt.
The analog was made from electrically conducting photographic paper* cut
in the shape of the sidearm and the contained electrode. With the use of
this special paper, a two~dimensional model may be constructed for the

' . . 22
study of steady-state current flow in simple or complex geometry.

The geometric model used isopotential nonconducting wall conditions,
which were represented in the model by lines of conductive paint.** By
giving the opposing walls separate and distinct potentials, we were able
to produce an electric field which could be mapped using a high-impedance

voltmeter with an electric probe.

tance of this paper was sufficiently high for use in this study.

The isopotential lines generated bhetween the walls in this manner
represented current flow lines. By shifting the electrodes 20° to the
ends of the model, the iscopotentials would represenl the potential gra-

dient in the system.

The Bivar potential source and probe used for measuring the electric
field were made by Electronic Associates, Inc., of Long Beach, New Jersey.
An accompanying Variplotter, also made by Electronic Associates, Inc.,
provided the c¢onnections to the voltage source and an insulated surface
to hold the model. A high-impedance voltmeter was reguired to measure

the field potentials.

The lines in Figs. 14-16 represent current stream lines. The distance
between two stream lines in Fig. 14 represents the passage of 12.5% of
the total current. 1In Figs. 15 and 16, the distance between stream lines

represents 10% of the total current.

Figures 14 and 15 show that there are no regions of abnormally high
current densities in the vicinity of the two bends in the electrode side-
arm. The present sideaym design seems adeguate with regard to localized

heat generation rates.

Figure 16 shows an alternate electrode design which would further
reduce localized heating at the sidearm bend near the electrode. This
design has the additional advantage that it could also be used as the
device for introducing the feed to the fluorinatcor without fear of
impinging a jet of hot salt against the frozen wall and destroying the

insulating film near the electrode.
