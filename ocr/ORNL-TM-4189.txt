EVALUATION OF HASTELLOY N ALLOYS AFTER NINE YEARS EXPOSURE
- TO BOTH A MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALT AND AIR
AT TEMPERATURES FROM 700 TO 560°C

ABSTRACT |

A Hastelloy N thermal convection loop, some portions of which consisted of a Hastelloy N alloy
modified with 2% Nb for improved weld properties and containing LiF—23 mole % BeF,-5 mole % -
ZrF4—1 mole % UF4—1 mole % ThF4, was operated for 9.2 years at a maximum temperature of
700°C and a minimum of 560°C. Loop operation ended with the occurrence of a salt leak. The failure
of the loop was attributed to a reaction between impurities in a ceramic bushing and the modified
Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing. Microscopic examination of the loop tubing revealed that mass transfer of
material (material removal and deposition) did occur. The attack, which occurred in the hot section,
was manifested in the formation of voids, in a zone of maximum depth of 4 mils. Deposition was
noted on the colder portions. On the basis of salt analysis and microprobe analysis of the tubing, the

" mass transfer appeared to be selective with respect to chromium, which is what would be predicted
from thermodynamic considerations. The actual void formation and chromium depletion agrees
favorably with that predicted from calculations. No difference in corrosion could be seen in the
standard Hastelloy N and the modified Hastelloy N—2% Nb alloy. No change in mass transfer could be
seen in-the welded areas. A two-layer oxide of 2 mils thickness was the maximum formed under the
heaters in 9.2 years exposure to air. Hastelloy N is much more resistant to mass transfer than type
304L stainless steel exposed to the same salt under similar conditions. It was concluded from this

_experiment that Hastelloy N is suitable for long-term use as a container material for the molten salt
used in this test and has acceptable air oxidation resistance at the temperatures tested.

o

INTRODUCTION

‘Hastelloy N (initially known as INOR-8, nominal composition 72% Ni—16 % Mo—7 % Cr—5 % Fe) was
developed at the Oak- Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP)
Program and was viewed as the most promising container material for molten fluorides exposed to the
severe (800°C) ANP conditions.! Actual use of Hastelloy N in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)
and in many experimental programs has shown that the alloy is an effective container material for molten
fluoride salt under a variety of conditions. However, during routine qualification of welders on Hastelloy N
material in 1961 (before widespread use of the alloy) the presence of a possible weld-cracking problem was
detected in one heat of the alloy. Both bend tests and metallographic examination revealed the incidence of
cracking, and a cursory examination of the welding procedures indicated no obvious remedy. Because of
the importance of this problem Lan investigation was immediately started to determine its seriousness and to
develop preventive methods.

In one effort to overcome the weld-metal cracklng difficulties, an expenmental Hastelloy N weld-metal
composmon containing 2 wt % Nb was investigated. This filler metal was developed in the course of the
Hastelloy N welding program conducted by the Welding and Brazing Laboratory of ORNL and was
considered exceptionally promising in view of its excellent elevated-temperature mechanical properties.?
Welds made on the suspect heat of plate exhibited no evidence of weld-metal cracking, either in bend tests
or in metallographic sections. Wire from two laboratory melts of this alloy was deposited with no evidence

- of defects in the weld metal, indicating that use of this alloy would prevent weld-metal cracking.

Because of the possible widespread use of the modified alloy in a molten fluoride salt environment,
corrosion tests were scheduled to evaluate the resistance to salt attack of Hastelloy N that had been
modified by the addition of 2% Nb. In addition to corrosion data on Hastelloy N—2% Nb, it was planned
that these tests would also supply data on the corrosion properties of various types of weld junctions listed

below:

1. Hastelloy N welded with Hastelloy N weld rod,
2. Hastelloy N welded with Hastelloy N—2% Nb weld rod,

" 3. Hastelloy N—2% Nb welded with Hastelloy N—2% Nb weld rod.

Since molten salts in a reactor system would most likely be used as heat transfer fluids, the corrosion test
was conducted in a loop system which would provide flow and a temperature gradient. The test system
used was a Hastelloy N thermal convection loop (deSignated loop 1255) similar to the ones shown in Fig. 1.
The temperature gradient is produced by heating a portion of the loop while insulating or exposing the
remainder of the loop to ambient air as necessary to provide the desired temperature difference. The salt
flow results from the difference in density of the salt in the hot and cold portions of the loop. The
maximum temperature chosen for this test was 700°C and the minimum 560°C. The velocity of the salt T
resulting from this temperature difference was approximately S fpm. L,/

The experiment was started April 11, 1962, and, with only a few minor interruptions, operated until
July 20, 1971. On the day operation was ended, the amperage t6 the loop heaters decreased to one-half of
normal. Investigation revealed that half the main heaters were open and, in addition, grounded (which often
indicates the presence of salt); At this time, all power to the loop was shut down. After cool-down, the
insulation and heaters were removed, revealing a small amount of salt on the outside of the tubing,

During the last few years, we planned to operate the loop as long as possible to provide long-term data
on mass transfer in a fluoride salt, air oxidation of Hastelloy N, and corrosion properties of various weld
junctions. Thus, the failure provided an end to the experiment. In this report, we will discuss the loop
failure, the compatibility of the Hastelloy N alloys and their welds with the salt, and the air oxidation of
the alloy. The results of this experiment are still quite significant in that recent developments® have
indicated that certain Hastelloy N alloys containing additions of Ti, Hf, Nb, and Zr have good mechanical
properties (better than standard Hastelloy N) after being irradiated at 760°C. Thus, the possibility of using
a modified alloy similar to the one tested in this experiment still exists. |

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND MATERIALS

Figure 2 is a photograph of a typical thermal convection loop with heaters and thermocouples installed
but without insulation. Thermocouples are located at the top of the hot and cold leg, at the bottom of the
cold leg, at the insert specimen locations, and over the modified Hastelloy N tubing. A schematic view of
the loop is shown in Fig. 3. The parts of the loop we will refer to"are the hot leg (heated vertical tubing),
cold leg (unheated vertical tubing), upper crossover, and lower crossover. The major portion of the loop was
constructed of ¥%-in. sched 10 standard Hastelloy N pipe (approx 0.675 in. OD) from heat No. Y-8460
(Superior Tube) and an experimental heat specified as Haynes SP-19. The top 9 in. of the hot leg contained
two tube inserts. The top insert was Hastelloy N—2% Nb, and the bottom one was standard Hastelloy N.
The inserts were 3-in.-long cylinders, 0.595 in. OD, 0.025 in. wall, which were fitted into machined
portions of the loop tubing, thus retaining the same flow cross section throughout the loop.The next 6-in.
section of the hot leg was Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing, and the remainder of the loop was standard
Hastelloy N. The Hastelloy N—2% Nb alloy was from experimental heat MP-13. The compositions of the
alloys are given in Table 1. i

In forming the modified Hastelloy N tubing, a ¥;-in. slab was first rolled and cross-rolled until the final
thickness was approximately 0.040 in. The sheet was then formed into a tube and welded with Hastelloy
N-2% Nb weld wire. The insert tubing was swaged to approximate size and then machined to final

 tolerance, while the loop tubing was used as fabricated.

Prior to filling, the loop was heated under a vacuum of 10 u for leak-checking and bake-out. The loop
was then filled with flush salt, which was dumped after 2 hr, and then was filled with the operating salt.
The salt used was the pmposed MSRE fuel salt with a nominal composition of LiF—23 mole % BeF,—$
mole % Z1F4—1 mole % UF4—1 mole % ThF,. The operating temperatures are given in Fig. 3. '

- This loop had no facility in which to dump the salt at the end of operation, so the salt was frozen in
place. To remove the salt, various portions of the loop were cut into small pieces, placed in a graphite-lined
nickel container, and heated under argon for 4 hr at 800°C.

- RESULTS
Loop Failure

The loop failure occurred in the middle of the hot leg under the ceramic bushing between two sets of
heaters. The bushing material used was grade A Lava, which was manufactured by the American Lava
Company. Grade A Lava is hydrous aluminum silicate fired after machining to dnve off the chemlcally
bound water and develop a hard electric insulator. '

Background. Metal-bushing compatibility problems have previously existed, and at least one case
involving Hastelloy N at ORNL has been reported.*:5 In 1964, ORNL conducted a corrosion program in
support of the SNAP-8 electrical-generating system. A “‘chromized” Hastelloy N was used as the fuel
cladding and contained NaK. Several instances of excessive corrosion were noted on the exterior of the
“chromized” Hastelloy N tubing underneath ceramic bushings similar to those used in loop 1255. The first
instarice noted was on a loop after 552 hr of operation at design temperature, 760°C maximum, 593°C
minimum. The corrosion was found during replacement of heaters. No NaK leakage had occurred. Exterior
pitﬁng was found on the chromized %-in.-OD, 0.072-in.-wall Hastelloy. N tubing under the ceramic
bushings (grade A Lava, unfired) used to space the electric heaters from the tubing (Fig. 4). The attack was
noticeable on the tube wall at the location where the temperature was estimated to have reached 675°C,
and the attack increased toward the high-temperature end of the tubing, where the temperature was
calculated to have been approximately 785°C. The maximum attack found near the hottest end of the tube
(Fig. 5) was 0.037 in. deep, as determined by external measurements and x rays of the area. While the exact

nature of this attack was not determined, it was attributed to oxidation-inducing volatile material driven
out of the ceramic bushings. Subsequent to this, all ceramic bushinés of the grade A Lava type were fired at
1100°C prior to installation. |

The second case of exterior corrosion on chromized Hastelloy N happened later in the same program on
another loop.5:¢ The exterior corrosion occurred on the ¥%-in.-OD, 0.072-in.-thick wall of the hot-spot
section, which was operating at 785°C. A NaK leak developed after 1300 hr of operation. Visual inspection
of the failed area showed that the Hastelloy' N piping had been excessively oxidized in very localized areas
under the fired ceramic insulator bushing in the heater section. Figure 6 shows both the hole through which
the leak occurred and an adjacent area with accelerated oxidation that had not quite penetrated the wall. A
magnified section taken through the area adjacent to the hole is shown in Fig. 7. The metallographic
examination revealed a mixture of metal and oxides in the corrosmn products which x-ray-diffraction
analysis proved to be mostly nickel and NiO.

The circumstances surrounding this 1nc1dence of catastrophlc oxldatlon suggest that breakdown of the
normally protective oxide layer on the pipe exterior surface was attributable either to contamination from
some unknown element or compound in the ceramic bushing or to oxygen starvation in the stagnant area
under the bushing. An Inconel shim was placed between the ceramic bushings and the tubing to eliminate
these conditions in the remaining loops. '

Loop 1255. Figure 8 shows a macrograph and a micrograph of the failed region that ended the
operation of loop 1255 (Fig. 3). The tubing in this section of the loop was modified Hastelloy N with the
2% Nb added. The longitudinal weld which joined the tubing is also shown in Fig. 8z. A micrograph of the
weld wilt be seen in a later section of the report. Electron beam scanning images were made of the area just
to the left of the portion of the tube wall that was attacked (circled area of Fig. 82). This area, shown in
Fig. 8b, included the Inconel 600 shim stock {foil) which covered the thermocouple, a spongy oxide which

also included frozen salt that had leaked out, and a layered oxide found on both sides of the foil. The
electron beam scanning images are shown in Fig. 9. The quantitative values are given in Table 2.

The analysis of the spongy-oxide—salt mixture combination shows an agglomerate of oxides and metal
which includes the elements zirconium, molybdequm, iron, nickel, and chromium. The composition shown
in Table 2 reflects an average of three readings in different areas for each element. The zirconium probably
comes from the salt, while the other elements are constituents of the alloy which have been removed from

the Hastelloy N during the failure process.

The foil, which analyzed as 90% Ni-9% Cr—1% Fe, was documented as Inconel 600, and its purpose
was to cover the thermocouples. The nominal composition of Inconel 600 is 76% Ni—16% Cr—8% Fe; thus
it was possible that iron and chromium were depleted from the Inconel 600 during the reaction that caused
the failure. It is also possible that the foil was not Inconel 600.

The adherent metal oxide on this alloy would normally contain only nickel and chromium, but the
ahalysis also showed substantial quantities of elements that were present in the spongy-oxide—salt mixture.
Thus, this analysis represented a mixture of reaction products. |

at the outer surface, with the amount of material removed decreasing as the inner surface is approached.

Mass Transfer

The salt ana}ysis before and after test is given in Table 3. Of importance here is the large amount of
chromium after test, representing a large increase, with little if any change in the other constituents or
impurities. . IR

Figure 11 shows representative micrographs of the inside surface (eprséd to Sa}f) of specimens and
tubing completely around the loop. Note the attack and void formation in the heated areas (hot leg) and
the deposition in the cooler regions. Figures 12 and 13 show micrographs of the inside surfaces of the insert
specimens. Figure 12 shows the modified Hastelloy N—2% Nb insert specimen from the top of the hot leg
(A, Fig. 11). The salt temperature at this position was approximately 695°C. Voids extend 2 mils into the
matrix. The etched specimen shows that the etching characteristics of the material near the surface are
quite different from the matrix. This generally ‘represents depletion of an alloy constituent — in this case,
chromium. Figure 13 shows the standard Hastelloy N insert specimen located 6—9 in. below the top of the
hot leg (B, Fig. 11). The salt temperature at this location was apprdximately 675°C. These voids extend
about 3 mils into the matrix. Again, the etching delineates the depleted area.

Figure 14 shows through-wall sections of both insert specimens. The inner surface of the insert
specimens was exposed to the salt, while the outer surface was in contact with the inner surface of the loop
tubing, which was directly under a heater. Note the poor outside surface of the modified alloy. In
fabricating these specimens, the material was swaged and machined; this is the surface resulting from these
operations. We also note that the areas modified by heating (outer surface) and by corrosion (inner surface)
have approximately the same affected thickness (5 mils) for both alloys. On the outer surface, the depth of
disturbance (as seen by the disappearance of the precipitate, probably carbides) is 5 mils. On the inner
surface, the layer that contains the voids is 2 or 3 mils deep, with carbide removal (probably redistribution)
extending another 2 mils. It is also noted that the precipitates in the standard alloy are spherical, while
those in the modified alloy are platelike. Thus the niobium addition also affects the morphology of the
carbides in ‘the Hastelloy N. X-ray diffraction of electrolytically extracted Pprecipitates (matrix dissolved)
from the modified alloy shows the presence of both M C and NizMo. The metallic constituents of M4 C are
primarily nickel and molybdenum with some chromium. The carbide is rich in silicon as compared with the
matrix. : |

Figure 15 is the modified Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing away from the failure (D, Fig. 11). The
témperature of the salt at this position during operation was approximately 650°C. Voids at this location
extend 3 to 4 mils into the matrix. An electron microprobe scan analysis of the salt-exposed surface
disclosed a chromium- and iron-depleted area of 75 i (3 mils). Table 4 gives quantitative values for the alloy
constituents as obtained by the microprobe. Figure 10 shows similar void formation on the inner surface of
the Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing at the point of failure.

Figures 16 and 17 show the standard Hastelloy N tubing at the lower portion of the hot leg. The voids
extend about 2 mils into the alloy in Fig. 16, at approximately 630°C (E, Fig. 11), and 1 mil in Fig. 17, at

Air Oxidation

Flgure 22 shows mlcrogxaphs of the outs:de of the tubing which had been exposed to air. The oxide
layers on the outside of the loop tubing underneath heaters are shown in Figs. 2325, and the oxide layers
on the loop tubmg just exposed to air are shown in Figs. 26—28. Figures 23—25 (4, B, C, Fig. 22) include
the hot leg and lower crossover, while Figs. 26—-28 (D, E, F, Fig. 22) include the upper crossover and the
cold leg. The salt temperatures in these areas were 560 to 660°C. The outside surfaces underneath heaters
are appreciably hotter than the salt because of the temperature gradient across the salt film at the inside
surface. This temperature difference mainly results from the fact that we have laminar flow. Because of the

damage done to the outer surface of the tubing by the salt leakage at the failure, no outer surface samples
from the upper portion of the hot leg were available for oxide layer analysis. Two layers of oxide, probably
NiO and Cr, 03, are seen on most of our oxidized specimens. The existence of the Cr, 0; on our Hastelloy
N tubing is verified by the presence of chromium-depleted areas at the outer surface which extend into the
matrix of the oxidized alloys. It is also interesting to note in Figs. 236 and 26b that etching completely
destroyed the lower oxide layer, and Cr,0; is readily attacked by our etchant. In Ni—27% Cr alloys
exposed to oxygen at 800—1200°C, NiO forms at the outer surface, followed by Cr, O, adjacent to the
matrix.” In oxidized Ni-Cr alloys with 3—10% chromium, the outer layer is NiO, followed by Cr,05
particles in a nickel matrix next to a surface.® The etching of the oxidized samples disclosed extensive
intergranular penetration which extended about 3 mils into the matrix. No oxide penetration greater than 3
mils was seen. |

Weld Corrosion Resistance

Figure 29 is the weld between the Hastelloy N tubing that covered the insert specimens and the
modified Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing. The upper right piece is the tubing, while the upper left piece is an
insert spacer above which sat the insert specimen. The left side was exposed to the salt and the right side to
air. The temperature of the salt at the weld was 665°C. The outside of the tubing was exposed to a heater,
so its temperature was higher than 665°C. Figure 30 shows the Hastelloy N insert spacer, the center of the
weld, andf the modified Hastelloy N tubing after exposure to the salt. Figure 31 shows the Hastelloy N
tubing, the weld, and the modified Hastelloy N tubing, respectively, after exposure to air.

DISCUSSION
Temperature-Gradient Mass Transfer

The corrosion resistance of metals to fluoride salts has been found to vary directly with the “nobility”
of the metal — that is, inversely with the magnitude of the free energy of formation of fluorides involving
the metal. Accordingly, corrosion of multicoinponent alloys tends to be manifested by the selective
oxidation and removal of the least noble component. In the case of Hastelloy N, corrosion is selective with
respect to chromium, as seen in this experiment. The selective removal of chromium by fluoride mixtures
depends on various chemical reactions, as follows:

1. Due to impurities in the salt, for example,
FeF, +Cr=CiF, + Fe. (1)
2. Dissolution of oxide films from the metal surface, for example,

2Fe* (from film) + 3Cr = 2Fe + 3Cr** . | : 2

If pure salt contaihing UF4. (and no corrosion products) is added to a Hastelloy N loop operating

- polythermally, all points of the loop initially experience a loss of chromium in accordance with the Cr-UF,

reaction, Eq. (3), and by reaction with impurities in the salt (such as HF, NiF,, or FeF,). Impurity
reactions go rapidly to completion at all temperature points and are important only in terms of short-range
corrosion effects.

The UF, reaction, however which is temperature-sensmve provides a mechanism by which the alloy at
high temperature is continuously, depleted and the alloy at low temperature is continuously enriched in

* chromium. As the corrosion -product concentration of salt is increased by the impurity and UF, reactions,

the lowest temperature point of the loop eventua]ly achieves equitibrium with respect to the UF, reaction.
At regions of lugher temperature, because of the temperature depen ce for this reaction, a driving force
still exists for chromium to react with UF,. ‘Thus, the corrosmn-product concentration will continue to
increase, and the temperature points at equilibrium will begin to move away from the coldest temperature
point. At this stage, chromium is returned to the walls of the coldest pénnt of the system. The rise in

corrosion-product concentration in the circulating salt continues until the amount of chromium returning
to the walls exactly balances the amount of chromium entering the system in the hot-leg regions. Under
these conditions, the two positions of the loop at equilibrium with the salt, termed the “balance point,” do
not shift measurably with time. Thus, a quasi-steady-state situation is eventually achieved whereby
chromium is transported at very low rates and under conditions of a fixed chromium surface concentration
at any given loop position. A schematic of this mass transfer process is shown in Fig. 35. Our results in this
experiment show material loss in the hot portions of the loop and material deposition in the cold portion.

Void Formation

The formation of subsurface voids as seen in loop 1255 is initiated by the oxidation of chromium along
exposed surfaces through oxidation-reduction reactions with impurities or constituents of the molten
fluoride mixture. As the surface is depleted in chromium, chromium from the interior diffuses down the
concentration gradient to the surface. Since diffusion occurs by a vacancy process and in this particular
situation is essentially unidirectional, it is possible to build up an excess number of vacancies in the metal.
These precipitate in areas of disregistry, principally at grairi boundaries and impurities, to form voids. These

~voids tend to agglomerate and grow in size with increasing time and/or temperature. Examinations have

demonstrated that the subsurface voids are not interconnected with each other or with the surface. Voids
of this same type have been developed in Inconel 600 by high-temperature oxidation tests and
high-temperature vacuum tests in which chromium is selectively removed.? Voids similar to lthese have also
been developed in copper-brass diffusion couples and by the dezincification of brass.1® All of these
phenomena arise from the so-called Kirkendall effect, whereby solute atoms of a given type diffuse out at a
faster rate than other atoms comprising the crystal lattice can diffuse in to fill vacancies which result from
the outward diffusion. | ' - |

The time dependénce of void formation in Inconel observed both in thermal- and forced-convection
systems indicates that attack is initially -quite rapid, but then decreases until a straight-line relationship
exists between depth of void formation and time.! This effect, which is illustrated in Fig. 36 for the salt
mixture NaF—46 mole % ZrF;—4 mole % UF,, can be explained in terms of the corrosion reactions
discussed above. The initial rapid attack shown for both types of loops stems from the reaction of
chromium with impurities in the melt (reactions 1 and 2) and with the UF, constituent of the salt (reaction
3) to establish a quasi-equilibrivm amount of CsF, in the salt. At this point, attack proceeds linearly with
time and occurs by a mass transfer mechanism discussed earlier. During this latter stage of attack the
chromium content of the salt remains at essentially a constant value. This can be seen by referring to Table
S, where chromium concentrations are shown for fluoride salts at a series of operating times. Note that
between the 50 hr and 1000 hr operating times, no significant increase in CrF,; content has occurred.

21,000 hr, and the only change in salt chemistry was a chromium increase to 570 ppm. Table 6 gives the
chromium concentration in the salt for various times. These data indicate a_ gradual decrease in mass
transfer with time. No voids were seen in any Hastelloy N specimens from NCL-16.

In comparison to this loop there appears to be more mass transfer in loop 1255. The increase in
chromium concentration of the salt is about the same in both cases if you assume a linear increase with
time. However; this .is generally not the case, and we would expect very little additional increase of
chromium in the salt of NCL-16. Thus, the chromium concentration in the salt of loop 1255 would
probably have been much higher than that of NCL-16 after 30,000 hr. Also, as mentioned above, no void
formation was seen in any specimens from NCL-16.

Com'parison of Mass Transfer in Loop 1255and a Type 304L Stainless Steel Loop

A thermal convection loop of type 304L stainless steel has contamed salt from the same batch as loop
1255 for over eight years at a maximum temperature of 688°C and a minimum temperature of 588°C. A
plot of the weight change of specimens in the loop as a function of time and temperature is given in Fig. 38.
These specimens were placed in the loop after the loop had operated three years. Figure 39 shows the voids
formed in the specimen exposed at 688°C for 5700 hr. Microprobe analyses of this specunen disclosed an
appreciable chxormum gradient for 1 2 mils. ' '

‘Comparisons between loop 1255 and the type 304L stamless steel 100p show that the void formation in
the stainless steel after 5700 hr equaled that of the Hastelloy N after 9.2 years Thus, exposed to identical
fluoride salts under similar conditions, it appears that Hastelloy N is more res1stant to mass transfer.

as those discussed previously are noted Posmons (temperatures) above the zero line will probably lose
material, while those below will gain material. : '

. A simple calculation based on the increase of 1700 ppm chromium in the salt durmg operation gives us
some insight on the amount of material removed. The amount of material that would have to be removed
to equal the number of grams of chromium found in the salt was 2.2 mils of Hastelloy N over one-half the
length of the loop. It is assumed that half the loop gained material while half lost material. Thus, the
average depth of complete chromium depletion in the hot leg would be 2.2 mils. Based on past experience

 
 

34

\.

and results schematically represented in Fig. 40, this means we could expect a maxunum depletion of 4.4
mils at the hottest position at the top of the hot leg, 700°C, decreasmg to zero at 630°C. We have assumed
that all positions at temperatures below 630°C gain weight.

Micrographs of the inside surfaces of insert specimens and loop tubing that were exposed to the salt
disclose regions of both material loss and gain. In most cases the micrographs agree with the calculations
and with Fig. 40. Fewer voids were seen in the regulaf Hastelloy N than the Hastelloy N modified with 2%
Nb; however, the temperatures were different, so no definite statement can be made comparing the
compatibility of these two alloys. The concentration of chromium corrosion product in the salt was never
large enough to cause precipitation in the cold leg, so no plugging trends were ever noted. -

Failure Analysis

In Fig: 8, the shim stock (foil) that covered the thermocouple can still be seen. This shim stock was
located between the ceramic bushings that separated the heaters in the center of the hot leg. The failure was
adjacent.to the shim stock and was directly under a ceramic bushing. The failure in loop 1255 looked very
much like the loop failure referenced in an earlier portion of this report. Thus, on the basis of the earlier
work and our findings, we - attribute the failure to a reaction between the bushing and the modified
Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing. It would appear, although it cannot be proved that the bushmg in question
was perhaps unfired or at least contained impurities responsible for the failure. With time and temperature,
the moisture and other impurities, normally removed before installation, reacted with the outside surface,
moving inward until the tubing was finally penetrated. At this time the molten salt leaked outward and
caused the noticeable failure of the heaters.

It is worth while to mention that MoO; melts at 795°C and the eutectic between MoO, and M003 is at
778°C. Thus one might also consider the possibility of a low-melting combination between MoO; and an
oxide associated with the bushing that could lead to a failure of the type mentioned in this report. |

Air Oxidation

Our observations of the air oxidation of the Hastelloy N during the 9.2 years of operation disclosed
about a 2-mil-thick layer-of mixed oxide as the worst condition. As the temperature decreased (Figs.
23—28), the oxide layer thickness decreased, along with a decrease in intergranular penetration and
chromium depletion.

As part of the molten salt corrosion program, the outside of Hastelloy N tubing containing fluoride salt

is routinely examined to determine its behavior under air oxidation conditions.!! Table 7 gives some
typical results. The only evidence of intergranular penetration was seen in the material exposed for 11,300
hr, and in this case the penetration was quite small.

Thus, we conclude that Hastelloy N in service at temperatures below 700°C has shown good resistance
to air oxidation, with penetration not exceeding 2 mils/year.

Weld Corrosion Resistance

Part of the purpose of this experiment was to determine the corrosion resistance of various types of
weld junctions:

2. Hastelloy N welded with Hastelloy N—2% Nb weld rod,
3. Hastelloy N—2% Nb welded with Hastelloy N—2% Nb weld rod.

We found no difference in the corrosion (either in air or salt) of the weld and the adjacent alloy. The
corrosion that occurred at the base of the Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing weld (Fig. 32) was interesting as it
showed much greater corrosion at the tip; the voids extended much deeper into the alloy at this point. The
weld corrosion resistance was as good as that of the alloys.

CONCLUSIONS

1. We saw, from microscopic examination of the loop tubing, that mass transfer of material (material
removal and material deposition) did occur during the 9.2-year exposure of the Hastelloy N alloys to the
LiF—23 mole % BeF; —5 mole % Z1F4 —1 mole % UF,—1 mole % ThF salt. |

2. The attack, which occurred in the hot section, was manifested in the formation of voids. The

“maximum depth of the void zone was 4 mils. Deposition was noted on the colder portions.

3. On the basis of salt analysis and microprobe analysis of the tubing, the mass transfer appeared to be

selective with respect to chromium, which is what would be predicted.

4, The actual vond formation and chromium depletion agree favorably with that predicted from
calculations.

5. No mass transfer difference could be seen between the standard Hastelloy N and the modified
Hastelloy N—2% Nb alloy. - '

- 6. No increase or decrease in mass transfer could be seen in the welded areas. |

7. A two-layer oxide of 2 mils thickness was the maximum formed in 9.2 years exposure to air.

8. The failure of the loop was tentatively attributed to a reaction between the impurities in a ceramic
bushing and the modified Hastelloy N—2% Nb tubing, | |

9. In comparison with type 304L stainless steel exposed to salt from the same batch and under similar

* conditions, Hastelloy N is much more resistant to mass transfer.

10. Hastelloy N is suitable for long-term use as a container material for a molten salt of the type used
in this test and has acceptable air oxidation resistance at the temperatures used.
