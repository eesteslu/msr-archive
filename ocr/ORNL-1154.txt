SUMMARY

This quarterly progress report
of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion
Program at the Qak Ridge National
Laboratory i1s divided into five parts:
- RBeactor Design, Shielding Hesearch,
" Materials RBesearch, Alternative
Systems, and Appendixes, each of which
15 discussed separately in this summary.

Part I.

REACTOR DESIGN

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
{$ec. 1). The design of the high-
temperature Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment has been modified to use the 30-
1n. core instead of the 36-in. core,
as proposed in the last report. All
reactor components are on order with
deiivery expected this coming quarter.
Design of the external fluid circuit
is essentially complete, and many of
the major components are on order.
Construction of the building facility
is on schedule.

Experimental Beactor Engineering
{Sec. 2)., Recent developments have
included a frozen-sodium seal for a
centrifugal pump, satisfactory cper-
ation of an electromagnetic pump and
of a canned-rotor pump with sodium,
operation of a liquid-metal valve at
1500°F without self-welding, and oper-
ation of a mock-up of the reactor
liquid-fuel system. Technigues have
been developed further for the handling
and purification of sodium and sodium
systems to minimize oxygen contami-
nation; this bas contributed appreci-
ably to the successful eoperation of
these systems at high temperatures.

Reactor Physics (Sec. 3). The
resctor physics calenlations have been
dz=voted largely tostatics and kinetics

 

of the ARE, although some analysis of
a sodium hydroxide reactor and a full
aircraft-size BeO reactor were com-
pleted, The uranium investment 1n the
ARE 1is 29.2 lb, the slight increase
over previous estimates being due
largely te increased structural and
material poisons in the completed
design. As the change in reactivity
for normal control is relatively
insensitive to the location of the six
cuter control rods, they have been
located to maintain the most unifeorm
flux distribution. Calculated kinetic
responses of the ARE to arbitrary
changes in reactivity, as a result of
possible accidents or failures, show
the system to be well damped. Pre-
liminary calculations of a sodium
hydroxide reactor designed at ORNL
have yielded data on leakage and
absorption spectra of the core and
indicate a critical mass of approxi-

mately 32 1b.

Critical Experiments (Seec. 4). The
preliminary reactor assemblies which
are being, or have been, investigated
include simulations of the air-water
aircraft reactor, proposed by General

sodium causes negligible corrosion to

Radiation Damage (Sec, 14). Although
a number of fuel capsules have been
irradiated in both the pile and
cyclotron, complete data are not yet
available ewing to the residual activaty
of the capsule. From preliwinary
results 1t appears unlikely that
radiation will have a2 significant
effect on the fuel. On the other
hand, the thermal conductivity of
incoenel appears to decrease by a factor
of 2 iu less than a week of exposure
in the X-10 pile. The flux devendence
of this decrease has not been de-
termined, but a temperature anneal of
the effect has been demonstrated.
As regards creep under irradiation,
there 1s a definite reduction in
primary creep due to airradiation with
347 stainless steel. However, after
long periods of strain, 200 hr and

Part IV, ALTEBNATIVE SYSTEMS

The major effort of the Aircraft

Ridge Natienal lLaboratory is directed
toward a 1500°F liquid-fuel reactor.
However, research is 1in progress both
here and at associated laboratories on
several other reactor systems which

show promise. Among these alternative

systems recelving consideration are
the supercritical water reactor and
two configurations for a cirvculating-
moderator reactor.

Supercritical ¥aisr Reactor (Sec.

circulating sodium hydroxide as both
moderator and coolant and a fixed

has been proposed by The H. K. Ferguson
Co. The reactor is designed to deliver
140 megawatts at the desigu point of
0.8 Mach and 35,000 ft in a modified
B-52 airplane, with a maximum power at
of 230 megawatts. The
uranium investment in this reactor is

tributable to the poor heast-transfer
characteristics of sodium hydroxide,
which necessitates a large amount of

of this moderator-coolant reactor is
likewise specified as sodium hydroxide.
A 2.5-ft spherical core using liquid
fluoride fuel 1s expected to deliver
200 megawatts with a maximum wall
temperature of 1500°F. An essential
feature of this design is the use of
eannular fuel elements to attain the
high ratio of heat-transfer surface to
fuel volume necessary with the hy-
droxide coolant. '

High-Temperature Power-Plant Studies
{Sec. 18). North American Aviation,
Inc., has conducted an investigation
of high-temperature (above 1800°F)
helium and sodium liguid-vapor power
cycles with regard to their application
to a Mach 1.5, 45,000-ft-altitude
aircraft. They conclude that a helium-
cooled reactor cannot achieve the
supersonic propulsion of aircraft
even 1f reactor temperatures as high
as 3300°F and helium pressures in the
range 1000 to 2000 psi should be used.
On the other hand, a liquid-metal-
cooled reactor operating in conjunction
with a sodium liquid-vapor compressor
Jet system does appear feasible for
the supersonic aircraft.

Analytical Chemistry {(Seec. 18).
Chemical analysis is required in
almost every phase of the reactor
program. Although some of these
analyses are routine, the development
of many new analytical techniques is
required. In all, over 400 samples
were submitted for analysis during
the last quarter and over 1700 determi-
nations were made. The n-butyl bromide
me thod, which has been developed for
the determination of oxygen in sodium,
1s extremely accurate for oxygen
contaminations down to 0.015%.  The
oxygen content of argon and helivum 1s
now determined by a colorimetric
method which gives excellent precision
below 25 ppm. Methods are also being
developed for the determination of
metallic corrosion products in fluoride
fuels and metallic coolants and for
the determination of oxygen in lithium
and lead. '

ANP Division

The Aircraft Beactor Experiment
(ARE) is a 3-megawatt reactor designed
to provide first-hand experience with
a high-temperature (1500°F) reactor.
Recent modifications of the ARE design
have been permitted for convenience
where this has not affected the operat-
ing temperature of the core. In
particular, the smaller core, proposed
in the last report, (') has been adopted
and consideration 1s being given to
the use of NeK since this coolant would
eliminate the need of preheaters.

The external-fluid, electrical, and
control circuits have been generally
established and detailing is now 1in
process. The design of the fluid
circuit is sufficiently well defined
to permit ordering of heat exchangers,
blowers, and associated tubing. The
reactor control signal will now be
obtained from both inlet and coutlet
coolant temperature. The reactor will
contain si1x control rods symmetrically
dispersed around a central safety rod.

Construction of the building facility
for the AREis proceeding as scheduled.
The excavation 1s complete and most of
the concrete foundation has been laid.

will be retained. Initial shipments
of BeO have been made.

FLUID CIRCUIT

Detailed layouts of all aspects of
the external fluid circuit are currently
being made. The availability of the
various components from either at-hand
stock or commercial suppliers 1s being
determined, and in some cases the
procurement of these i1tems has been
initiated. The use of NaK as the
reactor coolant will eliminate the
need of preheaters in the coolant
system. The helium monitoring circuit,
the reactor room and pump-room space
cooling circuits, and the control-rod
cooling circuits are being reanalyzed
in an attempt to obtain dual usage of
some of the components.

Heat-Disposal Circuit. The heat-
disposal systems provide for heat
transfer from NaK to helium to ethylene
glycol to water. The NaK-to-helium
heat exchangers and the helium-to-
glycol heat exchangers have been
studied in detail, and the configu-
rations which appeared to be most
attractive have been reviewed with two
prospective suppliers, the Griscom-
Russell Company and the Vulcan Copper
and Supply Company. FEach of these
companies confirmed our basic approach
and have submitted formal gquotations
for the heat exchangers. As each of
the prospective suppliers has agreed
to quote on the basis of l-in. inconel
tubing in the NaK heat exchanger, the
tubing has been requisitioned to favor
the optimum delivery date. The afore-
mentioned companies also confirmed the
calculated helium flow rates and
pressure drops, enabling the release
of requisitions for the helium blowers.
Invitations to bid have been extended
to six blower manufacturers; the bids

have been received and currently are
being evaluated. The glycol-to-water
heat exchangers have been found inY-12
surplus, and their custody has been
transferred to the ARE project.

It has been decided to revise the
NaK system to provide for upward flow
from reactor to an expansion tank,
then down from the expansion tank to
the heat exchangers and down from the
heat exchangersto the low point immedi-
ately above the dump tank, and from
there to the pump and the reactor.
This revision places the pump on the
low-temperature side of the heat ex-
changer and obviates the need for
employing the pump as a surge chamber.
It 1s planned to maintain pump level
control by means of a forced helium
flow through an orifice, the area of
which 1s adjusted by the NaK level.
It has also been decided to employ a
mechanical valve in the dump tank line
rather than to maintain the liquid
level by gas pressure as previously
contemplated.

Contamination of Helium System.
Failure of a fuel element 1s expected
to release xenon and krypton to the
NaK circuit and in turn to the helium
present at the various NaK free sur-
faces. Studies have indicated that
the helium so contaminated must be
held for several days before being
After several
possible scrubbing arrangements had
been investigated, 1t was decided to
make this helium circuit a closed
loop with a valved line to the stack,
permitting release after any desired
waiting time. This system will 1in-
clude a low-pressure reservolr, a
scrubber, a small compressor, amonitor,
aod a high-pressure reservoir.

may contain the fused fluoride fuel in
a fuel system consisting of perhaps

Full-scale mock-ups of portions of the

tlock-up No. 1 was a crode-but-guick
system constructed froem glass tubes,
rubber stoppers, etc. and using colored
water to simulate the fuel. It served
primarily to indicate valving arrange-
ments, gage requirements, and operat-
ing techniques which would be needed
for working with mock-up No. 2.

Mock-up No. 2 was a carefully con-
structed all-glass full-size fuel
system employing tetrachlorvethylene
(sp. gr. 1.6) to simulate the liquid
fuel. Work with this system revealed
data on bubble formation, filling and
empiying rates, flushing methods, etc.,
all of which were applicable to mock-
up No. 3.

Mock-up No. 3, which bas been
assembled, 1is an all‘meta] system con-
structed from 316 stainless steel
3/16-in.-0.d. tubing and is capable
of operating at temperatures up to

tubing of this size the fuel mixture
of fluorides has been successfully

was 1nstalled in a figure-eight loop.
Teflon packing rings were used for
shaft sealing, and level indication
and control were taken from the liguid
surface in a tank mounted at the side
of the pump housing. Flow observed
during operation was 7.5 gpm at ap-
proximately 45 ft of sodium, but the
difficulties of simultanecusly con-
trolling the three liquid levels 1in
the system under dynamic conditions
inhibited smooth operation. The
initial run lasted for 3% hr at a
sodium temperature of 795°F before
failure of the shaft seal;
operation the final

reaching a temperature of 900°F, but

terminated when the pump became starved
and hence was unable to pump smoothly.

Examination of both these runs
after shutdown i1ndicated a failure of
the ligquid-level control system. In
the first run the pressure equalizer
line between the pumpand level control
tank became plugged, allowing sodium
to rise through the seal. This satu-

ation was corrected by additional

heaters and insulation on both the
ligquid and gas lines between the
pump and level control tank. The

explanation for the intermittent
pumping 1n the second test was failuve
of the level indication and control
equlpment to maintailn a satisfactory
liquid level in the pump. Subsequent
checks did reveal considerable variation
between the two liquid levels during
operation. Difficulties encountered
1n maintaining constant liquid level
in the surge tank and in the pump
indicated that this method of control
was impractical.

Canned-Rofor Pump (A. R. Frithsen
and M. Richardson, Reacter Experimental
Fngineering Division). The 1%-hp
fluid-bearing pump (Fig. 2.1}, de-
scribed in the last report, (?) has
been operated with water and NaK
without detectable wear. The first
test was made in a water~circulating
system and continued intermittently
for a total of 1200 hr running time.
Examination of the pump parts after
dissassembly showed no visible or
measurable wear or corrosion. All
clearances were the same as before the
test was begun. :

In a subseguent test the diametrical
clearance between the motor rotors and
motor cans was reduced from 0.017 to
0.012 in., and the pump was then used
to circulate NaK for a total running
time of 90 hr. During most of this
period the temperature was held at
200 to 300°F, although short runs
were made at room temperature and also
as high as 400°F. No indication of
wear or corrosion was found on any of
the parts upon dissassembly, Lut a
considerable accumulation of alkali
oxides was found at the tabs of the
motor cans and close to the walls of
the pump volute where the liguid 1is
believed to have been relatively
stagnant. A Fischer-Porter Flowrator
was used for flow measurements and
operated with complete satisfaction
even at the higher (400°C) tempera -~
tures. :

Rotor Pump,”” ANP-65, ep. cit., p. 170.

 

The limitation on operating temper-
ature for this pump 1s believed to be
determined by thermal damage to the
insulation in the motor windings. To
increase the permissible operating
temperature, an order has been placed
with the General Electric Company for
winding two motor stators with class H
wire which 1s capable of withstanding
a temperature of 500°F. 1In addition,
a proposal has been requested from
Allis-Chalmers Company for special
wire which can be used at TO0°F. With
the latter winding and by cooling the
liquid fed into the motor cans, it is
expected that liquid metals or salts
can be pumped at 1000°F or higher.

A 3-hp fluid-bearing pump has been
designed and has been partially fabra-
cated to test a number of revisions in
the design of the smaller pump and to
determine the practicability of seal-
ing up the smaller model. This pump
is expected to be ready for check ‘runs
with water about October 1. |

Level Tank Pump (W. B. McDonald,
ANP Division). A Duriron conventional
pump has been modified for operating
while immersed in liquid metals. This
pump has a capacity of approximately
12 gpm at a 40-ft developed head. A
conventional packing gland is used to
seal the shaft, and a labyrinth fitting
closely about the shaft minimizes the
amount of liquid metal by-passed to
the level tank. This pump will operate
while tmmersed in liquid metal in a
level tank and will be driven by a
motor on an overhung shaft mounted on
top of the tank. ‘Actual testing
awalts the availability of a test loop.

were taken at lower temperatures, the
larger part of the operation was con-
ducted at 750°F, which was the maximum

TEST LOOPS

A. G. Grindell, Engineering
and Maintenance Division

The "calibration" loop and the
"sodium manometer' loop, both of which
were designed to calibrate and other-
wise check flowmeters, have been
operated with liquid metals during the
past quarter. To date the more sig-
nificant application of these loops
has been in conjunction with pump
tests.

Calibration Loop. The calibration
loop, which was designed primarily to
check electromagnetic flowmeters
against venturi types and to check the
performance of electromagnetic pumps,
has been equipped with heaters, thermo-
couples, pressure measuring devices,
a lock valve for operating on a con-
stant weight of sodium, and a static
cold leg for continually removing
oxygen from the circulating sodium.

20

The system was degreased with per-
chloroethylene, evacuated, outgassed
at 800°F, and flushed twice with
sodium at 800°F. 1In this condition
it has operated satisfactorily as a
test loop for the G. E. electromagnetic
pump described above.

Sodium Manometer Loop. The sodium
manometer loop is an experimental loop
designed to afford means of developing
testing, and gaining experience on
flow-nozzle manometer type flowmeters
and simultaneously developing and
testing electromagnetic flowmeters.
The first attempt to pump sodium dur-
ing the period resulted in electro-
magnetic pump cell failure and sodium
fire during the start-up.

The loop was dismantled, repaired,
and restarted. In this test the
electromagnetic pump was provided with
a flexible secondary conductor, and
during the first 2 hr of operation at
constant power input, flow increased
from 2.5 to 9 gpm. This increase in
pumping rate was attributed to 1in-
creased wetting of the pump cell wall,
and increased pump 1nput power over-
heated the flexible secondary con-
ductor. Pump power was decreased, but
loop temperature was taken up to 890°F.
The pump failed after27 hr of operation
owing to the inadequate current capacity
of the flexible secondary conductor;
another conductor 2% times the cross-
sectional area of the first 1is now
being fabricated.

SEAL TESTS

Development of seals for pumps
handling liquid metals or other coolant
at 1500°F has received attention
throughout the period. Tests have

 
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

been conducted simultaneously with
pump experiments in some instances,
while 1n others tests have been con-
ducted in simulated equipment. The
seal types i1nclude a frozen-sodium
seal, metal-to-metal seals, and metal-
to-metal seals at the end of a bellows.

Frozen~Sodium Seal (W. B. McDonald,
ANP Division). A seal employing the
principle of solidifying a column of
sodium around a rotating shaft is
under development. The testing device
consisted of a pot containing sodium
at 1500°F. A sleeve extended from
below the sodium level i1n the pot to
the outside, and a shaft rotated inside
this sleeve. Sodium was forced by gas
pressure into the annular space between
the rotating shaft and the sleeve. A
refrigeration coil, to cool the sodium
to below its freezing point, was wound
around the outside of the sleeve and
soldered to 1t to increase thermal
conductivity. The rotating shaft was
1% in. in diameter with a diametrical
clearance of 0.032
shaft and sleeve. By the end of the
period this seal had operated for
approximately 400 hr against a pressure
of 18 psi1. The coolant employed was
kerosene refrigerated by passing
through a coil immersed in a dry ice
and ethylene glycol bath.

in. between the

At the end of the period a second
test using sodium at 1500°F but with
the pressure differential increased to
26 psi was underway. Also, a con-
ventional centrifugal pump was modified
by adding a frozen-sodium seal and was
installed in a pump test loop (Fig.
2.3). The relatively short space
between the pump and the bearings 1is
expected to limit the temperature to
which the circulating sodium can be
raised; however, this pump was de-

 

livering 15 gpm of sodium at 650°F at
2000 rpm at the end of the period.

Bellows Seal (A. P. Fraas and M. E.
LaVerne, ANP Division). A Dureg stain-
less steel centrifugal pump(3): was
reworked to provide radial holes in
the rear face of the impeller to keep
the seal cavity dry and was operated
for 80 hr with sodium at temperatures
up to 1000°F. Tests with water showed
that the design is effective in
scavenging liguid that leaks into the
seal cavity through the labyrinth seal
on the rear face of the impeller. The
test with sodium was discontinued when
finely divided sodium was found in the
silicone 01l circulated over the outer
side of the bellows seal. Since only
gas should have been i1n contact with
the inner side of the seals, and since
the liquid level contrel had given
difficulty with sticking of a solenoid
valve, the rig was disassembled for
inspection., All parts were found in
good condition except the bellows
which found to have two axial
cracks on the periphery of two con-
volutions. The test will be repeated
with another bellows.

Graphite) ring sandwiched between a
stationary member and a rotating member
made of Ketos tool steel sealed suc-
cessfully against a gas pressure of 10
psi at a seal temperature of 350°F for
450 br. Shaft speed was approximately
2000 rpm. This test was termimated at
450 hr in order to make changes in the
test equipment to enable NaK vapors to
be i1ntroduced to the sealing members.

INSTRUMENTATION

ANP Division

The development of suitable instru-
ments for indicating flows, pressures,
levels, ete. 1s an 1mportant con-
sideration for the adequate testing of
liquid-metal systems and for the
successful operation of the ARE.
Hecently considerable thought has been
given to these instrumentation problems,
with the result that a study has been
made of all types of level control
devices to determine the advantages
and the disadvantages of each. The
types studied include electroresistance,
electromagnetic, electroreluctance,
gas flow, and float, and recommended
applications for each have been com-
piled. This work has been done with
the view to designing a vigorous re-
search program to develop adequate
instruments for application by both
the Experimental Engineering and the
ABE groups.

spark plug type
probes are being used to control
levels. This method is simple but
unreliable because of periodic short-
ing out of the probes. FElectro-
resistance probes for: level indication
are to be investigated 1n an experi-
mental system which is presently under-
going fabrication. FExperimental work
1s to determine the merits of this
type of probe as a possible replace-
ment for the spark plug type.

At the present,

A model of the gas-flow control has
been set up in the Liquid Models Test

 

Laboratory, and the operating charac-
teristics are being studied with water
as the liquid. Experimental work on
other types is in the planning stage.

During the gquarter two magnets for
use with électromagnetic flowmeters
were made by using two U-shaped Alnico
V pieces and cold-rolled steel spacers.
These magnets givea flux of 1500 gauss
across a 1l4%-in. gap. Using L-in.
stainiess steel tubiang with these
magnets, a flow of 20 gpm pgives an
induced voltage of 10.6 mv.

The low-flux magnets have advantages
in that their use permits existing
equipment to be used for vecording
high flows, and braking effect in the
tlow circuit 1s reduced. When {flows
are below 10 gpm, the magnet strength
should be above 2500 gauss to allow
the same recording egquipment to be
used with higher accuracy.

Consideration of their atomic

supposition, a 304 stainless steel
standard globe valve was reworked to
provide a zirconium washer floating on
the valve stem hetween the seat and
the valve disk of 347 stainless steel.
The reworked valve was operated 1in

with three valves in parallel on the
same rig, one valve having a zir-
conium washer, one a molybdenum washer,
and one just the standard stainless

steel valve disk.

VALVE-PACKING EXPERIMENTS

W. C. Tunnell, ANP Division

Since the ABRE system as designed
requires valves to operate at 1500°F,
a program for determining valve design
characteristics 1s underway. If con-
ventional valves should prove un-
satisfactory, 1t 1s likely that a
bellows type valve would be a suitable
alternative. Such a valve would re-
quire packing to provide safety
features and also to permit temporary
use of the valve 1n case of bellows
failure. Experiments to determine
satisfactory packing materials for use
with sodium are in progress.

Following isa list of the materials
tested and the pressures and tempera-
tures reached during preliminary in-
vestigatlions:

1. Amosite asbhestos: held sodium
for 21 hr at 1500°F under 15 psi

before leaking.

ps1 pressure; no leaks were
observed before experiment was
terminated,

6. Soda ash: leaked sodium at
1300°F under 10 psi pressure.

Since this experiment was considered
a preliminary screening operation for
selecting possible packing materials,
no effort was made to operate the
valve stem when the sodium reached
1500°F. Other egquipment is being
designed with smaller clearances be-
tween the sealing parts of the pack-
ing glands to afford more conclusive
tests of powdered or granular materials.

CONTAMINATION OF LIQUID-METAL SYSTEMS

The corrosion of metal containers
by liquid metals, in this case primarily
is attributed to the oxygen

contamination in the system.
precautions to exclude oxygen from
ligquid-metal systems, including the
use of 1nert-gas blankets and cleaned
systems, had been taken, but they did
not succeed 1in limiting corrosion to
the desired level. It became apparent
that even the small remaining oxygen
contamination was a fault, and conse-
quently provisions for its reduction
have been developed. The three main
sources of oxygen, barring leaks, are
from scale in the mechanical system,
from the sodium charged to the system,
and from the inert-gas atmosphere used
with the system. Oxygen contamination
from cach of these sources is minimized
by technigques now in use. |

put into operation to remove welding
scale, oxides, absorbed gases, etc.,
to reduce contamination of circulating
coolant. These systems are now being
degreased with hot perchloroethylene,
after which they are evacuated and
outgassed at approximately the temper-
ature of operation. An experiment 1is
underway 1in the calibration loop to
test the efficiency of preconditioning
a systemwith sodium prior to operation.
In this experiment, in addition to
degreasing and evacuating, sodium was
circulated at 800°F and removed, and
clean sodium was introduced. This
second batch of sodium was circulated
for 3 to 4 hr at 800°F also and then

dumped. Clean sodium was provided for
operational use. By the end of the
period, the loop had operated for

approximately 175 hr with no apparent
difficulty due to faulty cleaning
procedures.

Equipment has been installed for
descaling stainless steel alloys by
the "Virgo Salts" process promoted by
Hooker Electrochemical Company. 1In
this process the metal 1s immersed in
a molten caustic, which converts scale
to salts soluble in hot dilute hydro-
chloric acid. After these salts are
removed by hydrochloric acid, parts
are brightened and passivated by a
dip in nitric acid. No results show-
ing the efficiency of this process
were available by the end of the
quarter.

Removal of sodium from systems after
operation is a problem also receiving
attention during the period. Sodium
1s now removed from small tube passages
by immersing the entire assembly in a
water bath which is heated up to 100°C
by live steam. When the residual
sodium hés melted, 31t i1s forced from
the small passages by gas pressure.

Of course, some burning and small
explosions occur which require that the
operation be conducted in the open,
but no danage to equipment has been
experlienced. Sump tanks are now
emptied by heating to above the melt-
ing point of sodium and flowing it
either by gravity or gas pressure into
an ash can immersed im a heated o1l
bath which keeps the sodium from pro-
jecting above the surface, thereby pre-
venting a combination oi1l-and-sodium

Purification of Liguid Metals
(.. A. Mann, ANP Division). Methods
of purifying liguid metals to reduce
the oxide content to acceptable levels
for use in convection loops, figure-
el1ght loops, pump test loops, etc.
have been 1mproved. In the method
now 1n use scdium or NaK 1s held at
approximately 250°F for at least 24 hr
to allow suspended oxide particles
time to agglomerate. The metals are
then filtered through a S5-p sintered
stainless steel filter into another
fill tank. From this tank the metal
is again filtered through a 5-u filter
into the operating system., Analytical
results indicate that double filtration
consistently reduces the oxide content
to below 200 ppm. The results also
indicate that no appreciable reduction
1s achieved with further filtration.

Purification of Inert Gases (L. A.
Mann, ANP Division). 1Inert gases used
for blanketing ligquid metals in operat-
ing systems require purification to
minimize oxXygen content. Argon gener-
ally contains on the order of 20 to 50
ppm oxygen, and helium cylinders have
shown as high as 65 ppm (chemical
analyses are reported in Sec., 19). A
purification apparatus has been put
into operation which removes oxygen
from blanketing gases by bubbling

26

through a column of NaK. Tests thus
far indicate that use of this system
consistently reduces the oxygen con-
tent of gases used in operating systems
to below 15 ppm, which is considered a
safe level, As an added precaution,
helium cylinders have been set aside
for the exclusive use of the ANP
Experimental Engineering Group, and
these cylinders are never permitted to
go below 100 psi to prevent air from
being introduced. These methods, which
are currently 1in use,

INVESTIGATION OF SODIUM CONDENSATION

H. R. Bronstein, ANP Division
Condensation of sodium in gas-
pressurizing lines leading to operat-
ing systems was investigated further
during the quarter. Electrostatic
precipitation showed that plugging was
due to a solid aerosol phenomenon, and
that quantities of sodium removed by
the precipitator were of such a magni-
tude that a means of returning this
condensate to the main tank should be
sought. Consequently, the precipitator
was redesigned to allow for periodic
or continuous melting of the sodium
collected. The experiment was rerun
on a dynamic gas flow basis with traps
placed after the precipitator to col-
lect any sodium getting through it.
No sodium was detected beyond the
electrostatic precipitator.

NaK traps have been suggested as a
possible solution for the problem of
gas-line plugging. Models of several
types have been built, and their
operating characteristics are being
studied with air and water. From
information obtained from these tests,
a trap for use with operating systems
may be designed. '

A group fromthe MIT Practice School
investigated three methods of reducing
or preventing sodium plugging of
blanketing-gas lines during the period.
These methods were (1) electrostatac
precipitation, {(2) a sodium condenser
coil immersed in a het oil bath, and

{3) a NaK bubbler. Although all methods

 

tested proved to be partially effective,
results of work by this group indicated
that the oil-bath trap was the most
practical. Design improvements would
increase the efficiencyofall methods,
however.

The oil-bath condenser causes
particles to condense on the walls of
the tubing because of its long length
and curvature, and, upon condensation,
the sodium flows back into the main
tank by gravity since the oil tempera-
ture is maintained just above the
melting point of sodium. Additional
experiments to determine the effect
of variations in tubing length and size
and bath temperature were recommended.

ARE COMPONENT TESTS

and engineering drawings are being
prepared for construction of facilities
for full-scale ARE components testing.
Five all-steel completely enclosed
test cells are to be erected, four
of which are 1dentical 1n design and
are to be used for measuring physical
and operating characteristics of
individual components such as pumps,
pipes, valves, instruments, heat ex-
changers, etc. prior to their use with
the ARE. The other test area, larger
in size, is to be used for testing
components 1in combination and will
include facilities for testing one

The heat-exchanger model designed
for testing in the figure-eight loop
has been tested with NaK at 800, 1000,

transfer coefficient as a function of
the flow rate has been obtained. The
experimental data give values as much
as 40% below those calculated from
Lyon's formula ¢(*) at low flow rates,
but check closely at high flow rates.

3. REACTOR PHYSICS

N. M. Smith, Jr.,

The principal subjects of activity
have been the calculation of the
static characteristics of the design
referred to here as the "ARE of 10
June 1951" and extensive calculation
of the kinetic behavior of the ARE by
machine tcchniqﬁes. The design of 10
June 1951 refers to an ARE of two-
thirds the core volume of that in the
design of 10 March 1951, Besides
reduction of core size, manufacturing
specifications and tolerances required
a reduction of the average demsity of
moderator in both core and reflector
and an increase in structure and
coolant volume, The effect of the
densi1ty changes overrides the effect
of reduction of core size, resulting
in a net 1ncrease 1n uranium inventory
requirement. Minor changes 1in the
static coefficients which resulted are

The uranium investment required is
estimated to be 27.8 lb +10%, -20%,
for the depleted, hot, poirsoned,
instrumented reactor with control rbd
thimbles in place. Allowance for
expansion of liguid fuel through the
boron curtain adds a requirement of
1.4 1b to the above figure, yielding
a total inventory requirement of 29.2
b of uranium. :

The effectiveness of mutual shadinhg
effects of a hexagonal array of seven
2-in, BR,C control rods has been calcu-
lated using three-group procedure
made equivalent to the 3Z2-group pro-
cedure for a homogeneous reflected
reactor. With one rod in the center,
and six on a ring surrounding the

 

Physics Division

center,. the total reactivity ef-
fectiveness is insensitive to changes
in the radius of the ring between 6.5
and 10.5 in. Absorption in the perman-
ently placed thimbles will reduce the
differential effect of the seven rods
to 0.22 1n Ak/k. Muatual shading to
the extent of a reduction of ef-
fectiveness of seven isolated control
rods by 14% 1s indicated by the calcu-
lations,

The kinetic response of the ARE to
arbitrary changes of multiplication
constant and to changes in inlet
coolant temperature for various values
of neutron lifetime and of fuel temper-
ature coefficient has been studied and
graphs are presented. The results
show that the fuel temperature responds
in an overdamped fashion to reactivity
changes well over prompt critical.

A start-up accident throwing the
reactor prompt critical at a low
(300-watt) level was studied, re-
sulting in a tolerable transient,

These calculations have been made
by starting with steady-state initial
conditions and by numerical integration
of the set of nonlinear differential
equations by IBM machine procedure.
Work bas continued on the development
of other IBM calculations: multiregion
problems, reactor solutions in cy-
lindrical coordinates, and the effect
of a boron layer between core and
reflector. | :

Variocus problems relating to the
physics of reactor calculations or
to the physics of the ARE arediscussed.
These include a proper formulation for

31
 

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

the age theory of the relation between
neutron flux and slowing-down density,
the transmission coefficient of a
boron curtain, and heating in the
boron curtain,

Calculations have been started on
the physics of hydrogeneous reactors,
and in particular for a NaOH moderated
and cooled reactor. Results are quoted.

IBM CALCULATIONS

Production Report (F, C. Uffelman
and P. Johnson, Uranium Control
Department). Reactors. During the
period ending September 1, 1951 the
IBM section completed calculations on
84 reactors. Included in these 84
reactors were four bare reactors
calculated by the end-point linear
approximation method and three adjoint
reactors. This brings the total number
of reactors calculated by the EPLA
method since calculations were begun
in February to 182 reactors,

Programing for the calculation of
reactors with an absorbing layer be-
tween core and reflector 1s very nearly
complete. PBecause the method{(!) used
consists in making two parallel calcu-
lations for flux distributions in the
reactor and combining the results of
these calculations for each group be-
fore going on to the next group, the
calculation of a reactor blanketed
with B,C will take between five and
six times as long as the calculation
of a regular reactor.

Cores and Reflectors. During the
period ending September 1, 1951 average
cross-sections and constants were
calculated for 26 cores and reflectors,
and "constant'" variations were calcu-
lated for 34 cores and reflectors. Of
the cores calculated, 16 were hy-
drogenous and required calculation of
the following factors in addition to
those calculated for nonhydrogenous
cores:

constant B and once for the variable

A new set of cross-section boards
and procedures 1s being set up for
calculation of special cross-sections
and constants, The new set-up will be
more flexible but slower in operation
than the specialized set-up used for
regular nonhydrogenous cores, so that
the old set-up will continue to be
used for regular cores and reflectors.

Summary of Calculations on the ARE
(B. T. Macauley, USAF). Multigroup
reflected-reactor calculations on the
latest ARE design, hereafter referred
to as the design of 10 June 1951 and
1llustrated in Fig. 3.1, were made
during the past quarter. The core of
this design, having auranium inventory
of 25 1b, is referred to as Core 93.
The composition of the core and the
design data are given in Table 3.1.

Two series of reflected reactor
calculations were made; the first
consisted of a spherical core having
the properties listed in Table 3.1 and
surrounded by the side reflector
(Reflector 519), and the second series

34

of calculations consisted of a spheri-
cal core having the properties listed
in Table 3.1 and surrounded by the
bottom reflector (Reflector 520),
The constituents in both the side and
bottom reflectors are given in Table

3.2,

Calculations were made using the
compositions of the ARE core (Core 93)
except for varying the uranium con-
centration and using Reflector 520.
The results were plotted showing how
keff varies with uranium investment
(Fig. 3.2). Also, calculations were
made using Core 93 (25 1b uranium
investment) and each of Reflectors 519
and 520, varying the core thickness to
show how k varies with the reflector

thickness %gig. 3.3).

and show the same general relations
as indicated in Fig. 3.3 for the ARE
core (Core 93).

The reflector saving for the ARE

The total effect on reactivity of

investigated. The pattern was one

same radius equally spaced around the
center rod, Five different distances
from the axis were tried for the ring

15 not sensitive to rod placement in
the region investigated, 1.e., 6 to
10 in. from the axis. This 1s caused
by the fact that two opposing factors
atre acting. When the rods are put
close to the axis they are inserted
into a tegion of higher undisturbed
flux but the shadowing effect of rods
on each other is large; on the other
hand, when the rods are put farther
from the axis they are inserted into a
region of lower undisturbed flux, but
any one rod does not tend to feel such
a large flux depression caused by the

 

insertion of neighboring rods. The
two effects counteract to givea rather
broad region of good rod placement. It
is known from previous calculations (3
however, that if the rods are very
close to the axis or very far oput
toward the reflector, a sharp loss in
combined effectiveness is incurred.
Since the hexagon moderator blocks are
about 3% in. across flats, it develops
that the possible radii awvailable for
rod placement are 3%, 7.5, 11.235 in.,
ete. The closest to optimum place-
ment is 7.5 in., and this has been
adopted in the current ARE design.

KINETICS OF THE ATRCERAFT
REACTOR EXPERIMENT

M. J. Nielsen, USAF
J. W. Webster, Physics Division

In the last qguarterly report 1t was
mentioned that solution of the non-
linear kinetic equations for the ARE
was in progress on the IBM machines,
Three graphs were included showing the
calculated response of flux (or power)
and fuel temperature toa step increase
in reactivity of 0,009125 (25% over

prompt critical).

This quarter the adaptation of the
kinetic equations to solution by IBM
machines was continued. Three types
of problems were comsidered: (1) the
response to astep change 1n reactivity
with the coolant inlet temperature held
constant, (2) the response to a change

 
 

in the coolant inlet temperature with
no control rod motion, and (3) the
response to a change in the coolant
inlet temperature with the control
rod being activated by the change in
coolant inlet and outlet temperature,

The equations and method of solution
have been written up in ANP-68,(9)
Solutions for the ARE (3-megawatt) and
ANP (200-megawatt) reactors and for
variations of parameters in the neigh-
borhood of those for the ABE and ANP
will be distributed in report form in
the near future.,

The results of kinetic calculations
completed to date by this method are
presented i1n the form of curves of
fuel temperature vs.
time, and phase plots of flux vs. fuel
temperature. The latter type of plot
has the advantage that the new asymp-
totic steady-state flux and fuel
temperature can be shown.

flux vs. time,

Most of the curves have to do with
the response of the flux and fuel
temperature to a sudden change of con-
trol rod position or to an accident
such as a deformation that might cause
a step increase in k. The changes in
reactivity inserted are 8k = 0.002,
0.004; 0.006, and 0.009125 where the
last represents a 25% increase over
prompt critical. The corresponding
flux and fuel-temperature response
are illustrated in Figs. 3.14, and
3.15. A phase plot combining these
two figures is given 'in Fig. 3.16.
Various parameters are changed to study
their effect, for example, the neutron
lifetime, the uranium mass-reactivity
coefficient which has to do partly
with the effectiveness of the B,C

of Kinetic Equations of Cylindrical Liquid-Fuel
Reactors, ANP-68 (Sept. 18, 1951).

curtain at the top of the core, and the
conductivity of the fuel. The reactor
is assumed to be at its design power
of 3 megawatts at time zero except in
one calculation — investigation of
start-up accident -~ 1n which the
power 1s taken as 300 watts at t = (.

In none of the cases considered
does the energy release seem sufficient
to damage the reactor, and 1in all
cases the fuel temperature responded
in an overdamped fashion, The fuel
temperature for the case of &k =
+0.009125 stabilizes out at a new
temperature 186°C hotter than the
design value of 800°C when no counter
control rod action is taken. There
is, of course, some magnitude of 5k,
which would cause temperatures result-
ing in failure of the fvuel tubes or
fuel solution before the stabilization
occurred,

Mass-Reactivity Coefficient. The
investigation of the effect, on the
response, of assuming different values
for the uranium mass-reactivity coef-
ficient (Figs. 3.17 and 3.18) demon-
strated the strong sensitivity of the
response to this quantity. It 1is
clearly very important that the B C
curtain be as opaque to neutrons as it
is possible to make 1t. '

Fuel Conductivity. The increase 1in
the fuel conductivity by a factor of
10 had remarkably little effect on the
response to a ok_ (Fig. 3.19). The
explanation seems to:be that the heat
input to the fuel due to fission 1s
rather large compared toc the loss by
heat transfer to the coolant during
the time of the power pulse. Hence a
change in the coocling term {(which is
about a factor of 2 rather than 10
since the conductivity affects only

one term of several in the heat-
transfer expression) does not markedly
affect the shape or magnitude of the
power pulse,

Neutrom Lifetime. Variation of
neutron lifetime | was calculated only
for the case of 8k less than the
delayed neutron fraction (and with the
stabilizing effect of the fuel expansion
neglected in order to see more clearly
how the lifetime affects the growth of
flux). For 8k, larger than [, the
delayed neutron fraction (and no self-
stabilization), the flux grows, of
course, approximately like

5oc o PHeTA) N

When 8k _ is less than the fraction
of delayed neutrons, the flux also
increases very rapidly initially (as
if all fission neutrons were prompt)
with an initial slepe inversely pro-
portional to the lifetime., However,
after a time which 1is directly pro-
portional to the lifetime, the flux
curve flattens out with a rather sharp
"knee"™ and rises from then on with the
"stable'" reactor period {(when there
are no self-stabilizing features).
The stable reactor period is a function
of the 8k _ but not of the neutron
lifetime. The rapid initial rise 1in
the flux is due to the fact that the
rate at which delayed neutrons are
being returned to the population 1is
almost equal to the rate at which
delayed-neutronemitters are being
created, while the flux 1s still near
the steady-state value. The reactor
thus behaves momentarily as 1if all
fission neutrons were prompt. These
facts are borne out qualitatively 1in
comparing the flux response to a dk_ =
0.002 for three different assumed

56

lifetimes (Fig. 3.20). Equation
11.35.3 of TID-386¢1%) provides a
mathematical interpretation of the
flux behavior as obtained (Fig. 3.20).

Although the effect on reactivity
of the fuel expansion was not included
in these calculations, it is apparent
that for step changes in reactivity
less than the fraction of delayed
neutrons the peak power 1n the power
pulse (when fuel expansion is allowed)
will be roughly independent of the
neutron lifetime for lifetimes smaller
than 10°* sec.

Start-Up Accident. In regard to
the investigation of the response to a
start-up accident, the results (Fig.
3.21) indicate that a step change in
reactivity at low power will be less
serious than the same step change at
high power from the point of view of
fuel temperatures reached,

Coolant Temperature. The response
of the flux and fuel temperature to a
step increase i1n the inlet coolant
temperature of 100°C is shown in Fig.
3.22. Since the rise 1in the coolant
temperature as the cooclant passes
through the ARE core (at design power
of 3 megawatts) 1s 194°C, the drop
through the heat exchanger is roughly
the same. A rise in reactor inlet
coolant temperature of 100°C implies
a rise of heat-exchanger outlet temper-
ature of approximately 100°C. The
temperature drop through the heat
exchanger must have been 94 instead of
194°C., This implies that the external
power requirement was suddenly reduced
from 3 to (94/194) x3 = 1.45 megawatts,
Calculations on the reactor were made

found that the reactor would,

of 1.575 megawatts, assuming no change
in control-rod setting. This is very
close to the new power demand, but,
even 1f the coolant circuit from heat-
exchanger outlet to reactor inlet was
long enough to allow the reactor to
settle to this new power, several more
circuits of the coclant accompanied by
small incremental temperature adjust-
ments would be required before the
power output settled to the
requirement.

Actually,
regulating control rod in motion by an
error signal which 1s such a function

it 1s planned to set the

of the 1inlet and outlet coolant temper-
atures that the point in the reactor
coolant pass which 1s at 1250°F under
design power remains at this tempera-
ture (this point is about one-third of
the way through the reactor). The
inlet coolant temperature, outlet
coolant temperature, and fuel tempera-
ture will adjust themselves to new
conditions when a new power reguire-
ment 1s made, but always with the
fulcrum point of the coolant at 1250°F,
The scheme ensures that the coolant
pumps which are located at the reactor
coolant inletendwill not be subjected
to high-temperature coolant {(approxi-
mately 1500°F) when the reactor is at
low power. This would occur 1f the
control rod was not moved.

An interesting feature of the curves
showing the response of the flux to a
step increase 1n coolant temperature
of 100°C is the "thermometer" effect
of the fuel-tube expansion.

This

60

expansion lets more fuel into the core
momentarily and the power increases.
The fuel 1tself soon feels the thermal
effect of the coolant temperature,
however, at which point fuel 1s lost
to the core owing to expansion above
the B,C curtain, and the power starts
down.

PREPARATORY PHYSICS CALCULATIONS

Correction to "Wigner Formuia for

(M. C. Edlund, Physics Division)., In

This expression, correct for hydrogen

nonhydrogenous moderators can be
obtained from the integral represen-
tation of gq.

 

(ll)This procedure for obtaining a correction
to the Wigner formula, and in particular the
method of eliminating the d[Z (u)]/du from the
Taylor’'s series expansion of zqu(u') was polnted
out to the author by E. Greuling and G. Goertzel.

The Transmission Coefficient of the
B,C Curtainin the ANP and ARE Reactors
(C. B. Mills, Physics Division). A
boron carbide curtain 1s part of the
design of the ANP and ARE reactors.
The transmission coefficient as a
function of lethargy of this curtain
is required for determination of
criticality coefficients and the
neutron lethargy and space distribution.

The B,C curtain is 2 in. thick in
the ANP and 1 in, thick in the ARE
reactor. In both cases i1t 1s a dense
layer thickly studded with coolant-
tube holes. For purposes of calculation
the transmission of a solid slab is
first computed and then a constant
correction due to the total aperture
of the holes is added. The transmission
coefficient is almost unity for the
high-energy neutrons. For thermal and
near-thermal neutrons, the holes
provide the only leakage through the
curtain.

The transmission 7y of a layer of
thickness T and macroscopic absorption
cross-section 3_ is given by the
integral

e~ Y

 

y = 2(2,T)?

66

This function has been integrated
numerically,(!*) The leakage through
the holes i1s evaluated by assuming a
cosine distraibution of neutron ve-
locities (as for ) with a probability
p{x) of being x cm off the axial line
at each hole being 27x. A projection
of the solid angle subtended by the
reflector side of the hole permits
evaluation of the probability of a
neutron traversing the opening. A
table of the fraction of the neutrons
penetrating the B,C curtain at each
lethargy group is given in Table 3.5.
This table will be used for a trial
solution for the neutron flux in the
vicinity of the absorber, An iteration,
requiring new values of v to fit the
more accurate form of the flux, may be
required,

Hieatinmg in the Boron Carbide Curtain
in the ANP Reactor (C. B. Mills,
Physics Division). A solution of the
reflected ANP reactor, including the
effect of the boron carbide curtain
intended to shield the fuelreservoirs,
is not yet complete. The possibility
of some secondary effect preventing
the use of this curtain 1s of some
interest prior to a more exact calcu-
lation., One such possibility is the
heating in the curtain due to absorption
by the B!'%(n,a)Li’ reaction, with a
release of 2.88 Mev.

The model used for an approximate
value of total heating per square
centimeter and power distribution is a
bare reactor with the ANP power distri-
bution, The boron curtain side of the
ANP reactor will be essentially bare
because of the high absorption and low
reflection.

THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE BEACTOR”

C. B. Mills,

Tt is necessary to determine the
critical mass of an almost spherical
reactor, 1.25 ft in radius, con-
taining sodium hydroxide as a coolant,
moderator, and reflector, The fractions

are

Sodium hydroxide moderator 75.00
316 stainless steel structure 20.23
Fuel, uranium, 50 1h/f¢3 4.77

This problem is essentially different
from those previously solved by the
ANP Physics Group because of the way
in which neutron diffusion and slowing
down in hydrogen must be treated. Most
methods of solution which treat hy-
drogenous materials correctly are nat
correct for this reactor because of
the large absorption and slowing-down
effect of the
stainless

oxygen, and
steel, An admittedly
approximate method, (1) first used
by this group to study the effect of
water on criticality on the ARE
reactor, (?%) which sums the effects of

sodium,

continuous slowing down of neutrons in
heavy materials with the discontinuous
slowing down 1in hydrogen, was applied
to this problem. This method of
solution has been discussed in some
detail separately,(17)

A convenient proof of the signifi-
cance of the results of the method
used 1n the sodium hydroxide reactor
can be found in the application of the
same method to the critical experi-
ments conducted at K-25 in 1949, (%)
Both reflected and bare, large and
small reactors were constructed and
criticality data were obtained. A
small bare and a large reflected
reactor with high and low uranium
concentration, respectively, were
chosen for the check calculation. ' In
for one calculation the

slowing-down term was

neglected for a check on the relataive
importance of this term for a known
reactor, The derivation of the re-

The effects of hydrogen and heavy
mass moderation in the sodium hydroxide
recactor are separated 1n absorption
and leakage spectra (Figs. 3.24 and
3.25). Neutron leakage and fission
spectra are shown for the two cases

72

For the first, hydrogen moderation
only is 1included, and, for the second,
both heavy atomand hydrogen moderation
are i1ncluded. The same comparison 1s
made for the water-moderated reactor
in Figs, 3.26 and 3.27,. Fission
spectra and neutron leakage for the
reflected water-moderated reactor are
given in Figs. 3.28 and 3.29,.

The analysis of the applicabilaity
of the Goertzel method 1s not yet
complete (primarily because of the
difficulty with which croess-section
data were obtained and the multigroup
constants formed), but certain tentative
statements can be made:

1. Hydrogen is respoansible for
most of the neutron moderation
in the sodium hydroxide reactor.

fective multiplication constant

different by only 4.28% for Ak/k.

2. The multiplication constant 1n
the calculated water-moderated
reactor 1s lower than the
critical-experiment value by
3+ 1%.

3. The critical mass of the 200-

megawatt sodium hydroxide
moderated and cooled reactor is

in the vicinity of 45 1b of

4. CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A. D. Callihan, Physics Division

The Critical Experiment Group,
which is responsible for the experi-
mental investigation of preliminary
reactor assemblies, has completed the
investigation of one assembly and is
now taking data on another. The
first mock-up was that of the aircraft
reactor, proposed by General Electric,
which employs water as a neutron
moderator and air as a heat-transfer
medium. - Two modifications of this
reactor with the same hydrogen-to-
carbon-to-uranium atomic ratlo were
considered, and the distribution of
thermal neutrons throughout the com-
ponents was compared. The second 1in-
vestigation, still in progress, 1s a
study of the power and flux dis-
tributions through a graphite-uranium
reactor with carbon-to-uranium atomic
ratio of 990. '

CRITICAL ASSEMBLY OF AIR-WATER REACTOR

The study of the proposed air-water-
cvele aircraft reactor, initiated at
the request of the General Electric
Company and executed with the co-
operation of some of their personnel,
has been completed for the present.

In this reactor metallic uranium
of high U??® enrichment was inter-
spersed among blocks of graphite which
simulated the proposed uranium—silicon
carbide core material, and a meth-
acrylate plastic served as an adequate
substitution for water. The plastic
was in 1%-in.-thick horizoental layers
between 4%-in.-thick layers of uranium-

bearing graphite. The critical mass

 

of the assembly was about 29 kg.
Measurements of the thermal-neutron
distribution through a unit cell
showed a high concentration in the
hydrogenous material. The thermal
flux in the plastic was 1.8 times the
average in the graphite and 3.6 times
that at the surface of the uranium.

The thickness of the individual
uranium pieces was 0.01 1in.; this
introduced some self-shielding {rom
incident neutrons. In an experiment
to evaluate the extent of this effect,
a standard piece of uranium was re-

placed by five pieces, each 0.002 ia.
thick, with aluminum foil separating
adjacent ones. In this technique

recoiling fission fragments collect on
the aluminum, and their activity is a
measure of the fission rate in, es-
sentially, the surface layer of the
uranium adjacent to the aluminum. A
comparison of the activities on the
successive aluminum surfaces gives,
relatively, the fission rates at
0.002-1in. intervals throughout a fuel

piece. In the reactor under study the
average fission rate throughout a
0.01-1in, fuel piece was 84% of that

occurring at its surface.

The observed large thermal-neutron
concentration in the plastic implied
that the moderator-fuel inhomogeneity
was causing a significant increase 1in
the uranium requirement. Conseguently,
the plastic thickness was reduced to
% in. and was placed between the
graphite-uranium layers, maintaining
the same H:C:U atomic ratio as before.
because of the

Tt was

necessary,

dimensions of available materials, to
alternate the ¥%- plastic layers
between 3- and 1%-in.-thick graphite
layers, thereby probably not achieving
optimum fuel-moderator homogeneity.
The critical mass of this modification
of the original assembly was 18.5 kg,
and a more uniform distribution of
thermal neutrons throughout the com-
ponents resulted.

The data are reported more fully
elsewhere. (1)

of simple reactors of good geometry
for cowmparison with theoretical pre-
dictions. The first of these, de-
scribed in the-twoe preceding ANP
guarterly reports (ANP-60, ANP-65),
was a bare cube having a beryllium
moderator. Further simple reactor
studies were postponed in order to
carry out the air-water-cycle reactor
investigation described in the above
paragraphs., On completion of these
studies a graphite-uranium reactor was
assembled, consisting of the 0,01-1n,
thick uranium metal disks separated by
4-1n.-thick blocks of graphite, the
C:U atomic ratio being 990, It 1is a
rectangular parallelepiped 45 by 45 by
44 1in. Insufficient materials were
available to make the system critical
without a reflector so 3 1in. of
graphite surrounds four sides of the
core. The loading 1s about 45 kg of
uranium. Measurements of power and
flux distributions are being made.

5. BULK SHIELDING REACTOR

J. L. Meem, Physics Division

The mock-up of the unit shield has
been completed with the water-reflected
Bulk Shielding Reactor. Preliminary
analyses of the data indicate that an
ideal unit shield for a 200-megawatt

reactor with a 3-ft right square

cylindrical core will weigh 124,000 1b.

The construction of the divided shield
is nearly completed, and preparatory
shadow shielding measurements are
reported. The spectroscopic instru-
ments required for the divided-shield
measurement appear to be satisfactory.
This reactor; formerly known as the
"swimming pool" or the "Shield Testing
Reactor," is now identified as the

Bulk Shielding Reactor (BSR).

REACTOR OPERATION

All measurements during the past
quarter, including those on the unit
shield, have been made with the water-
reflected reactor.('? Because of the
urgency of the unit shield measure-
ments, the check on the power of the
reactor by measuring the heat rise of
the water through the fuel elements
has not been completed.

Preliminary measurements using the
gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer
(see below) indicated that to measure
the spectrum at the face of the reactor
a complete set of cold fuel elements
would be required. These cold fuel
elements have been obtained. '

MOCK-UP OF THE UNIT SHIELD

During the past quarter the measure-
ments on the mock-up of the unit shield
have been completed and a report is
being written. Preliminary analysis
of the data indicates that an 1deal
unit shield around a 3.8-ft-diameter
spherical reactor (approximating a
3-ft right square cylinder) operating
at a power of 200 megawatts will weigh
about 124,000 1b. Final evaluation of
this weight will be given in the above-
mentioned report. The limits of error
of all the measurements will be
analyzed so that the weight for this
mock-up can be definitely bracketed.

Measurements were made of gamma-ray
ionization, thermal-neutron flux, and
fast-neutron dosage along the center-
line beginning at the face of the
shield and proceeding outward into 'the
water. HRuns were made with different
concentrations of borated water up to
0.4% boron by weight.

With the borated water in the
shield, it was observed that the
neutron-flux distribution in the
reactor was altered. Since this would
change the fast-neutron leakage,
neutron-flux measurements with gold
foils were made throughout the reactor
following the procedure in ORNL-1027.

over the corresponding shield weight

value for a unit shield differs from
that in the preceding section because
of the difference in the core size as
well as in the boron concentrat1on of

The saving in weight is primarily
the result of the addition of boron
which, by further reducing the number
of high-energy capture gamma rays pro—
duced in the shield, allows the lead
to be placed at smaller radii for the

Physics Division

A simplified design for the patch
required to prevent excess neutron
leakage from ducts perforating a
divided (water) shield can be made on
the basis of the duct test measurements
completed to date. The weight of a
patch needed for a single 6-in.
aluminum- filled duct surrounded by a
1-in. air-filled annulus was found to
be approximately 1000 lb exclusive of
duct or container. '

The calculation for this patch
weight was based on the data and con-
figuration presented in Figs., 7.1 and
7.2. The duct 1s straight and extends
beyond the shielda distance sufficient
to attenuate the neutrons to the same
level as 105 cm of water, which is
given in ANP-53¢!) as the thickness of
the divided shield on the rear of the
reactor. The extension is surrounded
by a cone of water which attenuates
nentrons scattered radially to the
appropriate level. This level is the
intensity at the edge of the shield

multiplied by the ratio of the area of
the shield covered by the cone to the
area of the cone.

Some assumption had to be made with
regard to the attenuation radially
from the duct since experimental
limitations prevented measurement of
the thickness required for such a
patch, The attenuation of water for
the Lid Tank source was used as an

testing facilities has permitted the
semiempirical establishment of im-
portant radiation attenuation relations.
An expression was derived for attenu-
ation of neutrons from a point source
in water by analysis of data taken at
the Bulk Shielding Reactor. Similarly,
analysis of Lid Tank data has yielded
an approximate formula for the total
centeriine gamma dose which has been
applied to subsequent experiments,

In the continued investigation of
radiation hazards in the ARE, further
calculations were made on the acti-
vation of the Be(O moderator, the
detection of leaks in the fuel elements
by means: of radioactive tracers, and
the activation of nitrogen and helium
in the reactor pit.

Calculations show the divided-
shield weight to be higher than origi-
nally estimated, owing chiefly to
symmetry and angular distribution
considerations, Some new effects have
been computed relative to the shadow-
shield theory which may prove that
this device 1s much less useful than
previously believed.

A shield using ammonia in place of
water has been considered which would
provide a decrease in shield weight of
about 7% at takeoff and 13%at landing.

Pb-H,0, and Fe-H,0 were treated by a
method ‘similar to the one used by

neutrons was there calculated to be
attenuated in water as follows:

where P(S) 1s the uncollided dose at a

The source was taken to be the
leakage from the side of the reactor
facing the detector. To simplify the
analytical work the source is here
assumed to be circular instead of
rectangular. With these assumptions
1t was possible to fit the shape of
the experimental attenuation curves by
using removal cross-sections for lead
and 1ron of 3.4 and 2.0 barns, re-
spectively, which values are the same
as those obtained in the analysis(*%)
of Lid Tank thermal data. The oxygen
cross-section neecded was 0.8 barn.
The neutron build-up was assumed to be
that for pure water, as given 1n pre-

INTERPRETATIGN OF LID TARK
GAMMA -RAY DATA

A. Simon, Physics Division

An approximate formula for the
total centerline gamma dose 1in the
Lid Tank has been applied to several
experiments. The variation in gamma
dose with the number of slabs in a
uniform lead-water shield was re-
produced satisfactorily for several
positions of the detector. In addition,
the variation of gamma dose with
degree of boration of a uniform lead-
water shield was also reproduced.
Differences between experimental and
theoretical normalization factors can
be explained 1n terms of neglect of
gamma build-up in water.

SHIELDING CALCULATIONS FOR THE ARE

Consideration of the radiation
hazards associated with the ARE has
led to the analytical evaluation of
several such possible hazards. The

affect the weight of the ANP-53
neutron shield.

The first-scattered dose at the
crew, with any appreciable
amount of lead crew shielding,
is nearly independent of initial
source energy down to around
1 Mev. Below that it drops off
very rapidly owing to the in-
creased lead absorption. The
SFAC calculations by the National
Bureau of Standards indicate
that the radiation leaving the
reactor shield does not contain
any extremely large proportion
of its energy 1n low-energy
photons. The current practace
of assuming the source energy
flux to be concentrated at 3 Mev
thus does not lead to error.

Scattering in the lead at the
crew shield has been calculated
using build-up factors computed
by The Rand Corporation. The
resulting increase in dose 1s a
factor of 2.5 for 1.55 cm of
lead and about 4 for 2.5 cm of
lead.

It has usually been assumed that
in the zone not shielded by the
shadow cap the gamma rays emerge
radially from the reactor shield.
However, i1f they deviate from
the radial direction, the effect
of the shadow is partly nullified.
Thus, i1if the emerging rays are
uniformly distributed in angle
from the radial out to 30°
zero thereafter, the advantage
gained by the shadow shield
drops (in a typical case) from
around 16 to 2. This appears to
be one of the most significant

and

effects uncovered so far.

evaporation cof the boil-off ammonia,

welght savings from use 6f ammonia
thus appear to be appreciable, but
whether this advantage would be offset
by the obvious disadvantage of carrying
a large volume of a hard-to-handle ma-
terial is still a question.

Mechanical Requirements of an
Ammonia Shield. Anhydrous ammonia has
a vapor pressure of 1 atm at -28°F and
must therefore be refrigerated to take
care of inleakage of heat from the
atmosphere as well as that due to
neutron and gamma radiation from the
reactor. The mechanical requirements
for maintaining an ammonia shield are
refrigeration equipment, a pressure
shell to maintain the liquid at 120°F
in case the refrigeration fails, and
insulation to reduce heat influx. Since
the heat flux into the shield due to
nuclear radiations from the reactor
is quite large, a higher temperature
inner shield layer of water, con-
ventionally cooled, and lead 1is pro-
vided. The lead in this inner shield
is inserted as a "heat trap" to lower
the heat flux into the ammonia.
Approximately 1 ft of water 1s pro-
vided to remove neutron heat as well
as to reduce secondary gamma production
in the lead heat trap. The heat pro-
duced in the ammonia is calculated from
the gamma flux 1t will receive. A
section of this shield assembly is
shown 1in Fig. 8.1.

Calculational Procedure. The total
heat energy (H, inBritish thermal
units) entering the ammonia from the
gamma heating of the iron and lead
heat trap during a 25-hr flight may be
expressed in terms of the thickness
(T, in centimeters) of the lead {(assum-

ing a 3-in. ircon pressure shell):

The lead heat trap is assumed to
replace some of the lead (for gamma
shielding) on the rear crew shield
disk. But since increasing the thick-
ness of the heat trap increases the
total weight and also decreases the
amount of NH, required for boil-off
refrigeration, the shield must be
optimized with respect to weight for
these two design variables., The

When this in-
formation is combined, the total weight
of the ammonia shield, which for the
purposes of this calculation includes
the lead heat trap, the rear crew
shield, and the boil-off ammonia, may
be expressed in terms of the thickness
of the lead heat trap. The weight of
the shield is then minimized by taking
the first derivative of the variable
weights with respect to the thickness
of the lead trap. The thickness of

Lithium at 1000°F has been circu-
lated in the X-10 reactor for one week
in a 316 stainless steel loop and sub-
sequently examined. The primary purpose
of this experiment 1s to study the
Bremsstrahlung activity produced by
beta decay of lithium. Li?, created
by the reaction Li7(n,B)Li8%, decays
with a 0.88-sec half-life, giving a
12.7-Mev beta ray. This beta ray 1is
absorbed in the lithium stream and the
container walls (1/16-1in. stainless
steel ), producing the Bremsstrahlung
activity. Preliminary analysis of the
data indicates the average energy of
the Bremsstrahlung to be about (.06 Mev
with an average intensity of 2 x 10°
Mev/cc/sec. Actual operation of the
loop 1s discussed in this report in
the section on radiation damage, where
it may be noted that there was no
significant amount of corrosion,.

Radiation Detection Equipment. The
1on chambers used 1n this experiment
were cylindrical in shape (4 1in. in
diameter, 4 in. high) with one of the
bases a thin-walled aluminum "window."
The chamber was filled with air at
atmospheric pressure, and its walls
were maintained approximately 150

volts above ground. The chambers and
their amplifying and recording equip-
ment were bench-tested with Co®? of
various strengths so as to simulate
the line sources of the circulating
lithium in the external pile loop.
A lead brick with a 2-1n.,-diameter
hole was placed between the source and
the counter to act as a collimator for
radiation coming into the counter.
The in situ calibration curves were
approximately linear and of the form
S = AR - b where S 1s the source
strength per unit length of pipe, R 1is
the recorder reading (the amplified
chamber response), A i1s a constant
inversely proportional to the distance
of the source from the counter, and b
is the background correction which
varies directly as pile power level,

CORROSION RESEARCH

‘W. D, Manly, Metallurgy Division
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

"W. BR. Grimes and F. Kertesz, Materials Chemistry Division

The corrosion program has been ex-
panded to include corrosion by hydrox-
1de and fluoride coolants as well as
the corrosion by liguid metals and
fluoride fuels already under investi-
gation for some time. Although the
majority of the corrosion data are
from static tests, a moderate number
of data on liquid metals are available
for thermal-convection loops. Forced-
convection loops are being developed,
but this development has not yielded
many significant corrosion data as yet.

In general, corrosion of incornel
and stainless steel by pretreated and
carefully handled fuel mixtures in the
absence of radiation is not sufficiently
severe to cause failure in operation
for several hundred hours at 800°C.
Limited experience at higher tempera-
tures suggests that corroesion at 1000°C
will not be excessive. Platinum,
contemplated as thermocouple shield
material, 1s not appreciably attacked
by the fuel mixture contained in:a
platinum or an inconel capsule. Welded
or brazed joints of platinum to inconel
are attacked by the molten eutectic.

Experience with fluoride coolants
indicates that corrosion, at least 1in
the absence of radiation, will not be
a serious problem with either inconel
or the stainless steels.

Corrosion problems encountered with
hydroxides and with hydroxide-bearing
materials, however, are a great deal
more serious. Sodium hydroxide, eather
commercial or specially pure material,

 

1s extremely corrosive to stainless
steel or inconel. Copper, monel, and
nickel are much more resistant although
mass transfer occurs with these ma-
terials. The corrosion by commercial
potassium hydroxide which has been
freed from excess water 1s noticeably
less severe than that by sodium hydrox-
ide but is sufficiently bad to preclude
use of inconel and stainless steel at
the preéent. Some tests with barium
and strontium hydroxides conducted with
dehydrated commercial material have
that these materials are less
corrosive than the dalkalies. These
results are preliminary, and the lack
of reproducibility in multiplicate
tests 1s a serious problem, :

indicated

While the results obtained to date
with hydroxide-bearing systems are
not encouraging, it should be noted
that (1) only in the case of sodium
hydroxide has pure hydroxide been
available for use; (2) inert, rather
than reducing, atmospheres have been
used: and (3) the metal walls have
been in the as-received condition,
While it is not obvious that changes
in technigue will result in improved
corrosion resistance, 1t 1s suggested
that many variables remain to be tested
before 1t can be stated that corrosion
of stainless steel and inconel by the
alkalies is necessarily so severe as
to preclude their use.

An extensive number of corrosion
tests, both static and dynamiec, have
conducted with sodium. It 1s now
apparent as a result of this work that

been

sodium may be contained with little if
any corrosion. Recent static corrosion
tests with sodium at 1000°C in 316
stainless steel for periods up to 1000
hr revealed no surface reaction and
did not indicate any significant weight
change. Operation of thermal con-
vection loops of inconel and several
of the stainless steels with sodium
for 1000 hr at 815°C produced very
little corrosion,. Indeed, 1t now
appears that little more can be learned
of sodium corrosion by operating
additional loops of inconel or stain-
less steel with sodium. It remains
to be demonstrated, however, that a
circulatory failure will not occur with
saodium in a forced-convection loop 1in
which flow rates are higher and temper-
ature changes greater.

Metallographic examination of several
lithium- and lead-containing thermal-
convection loops, operated during the
past two quarters, 1indicates severe
corrosion of the hot leg and somewhat
less severe corrosion of the cold leg.
Only one of nine such loops completed
the scheduled 1000-hr test; all but
one of the other eight failed because
of an obstruction in the cold leg of
the loop. This obstruction is a build-
up of corrosion products,

and completely satisfactory for
handling the fluorides, since mixtures
thus treated have consistently demon-
strated low corrosion rates on inconel
and a wide variety of stainless steels.
The penetration of inconel by a typical
fuel mixture in 100 hr at 800 and

1000°C does not excezed 4 mils. The
penetration of the stainless steels
(304, 310, 316, 330, 347, 446) in 100

hr at 800 and 1000°C did not exceed
2 mils and was generally less than 1
mil., The corrosion of platinum, in-
troduced in thermocouples, has been
shown to be negligible in the fluorade
fuel at these temperatures,

The Pretreatment Process (G. J.
Nessle, H. S. Powers, and C, J. Barton,
Materials Chemistry Division). 1In a
previous report(3?’? the improvement in
corrosion which resulted {from treat-
ment of the fluoride fuel with pieces
of stainless steel and incomel at B850
to 900°C prior to filling of the cor-
rosion capsules has been described.
While no mechanism for this improve-
ment has been demonstrated, it appears
likely that this treatment removes
traces of hydrogen fluoride which
result from hydrolysis of some of the
UF, in the fuel. A photograph of an
inconel sample which was used to
“"scavenge' the active 1mpurities 1in a
fluoride bath is shown in Fig. 10.1.
The fluoride thus freed from theactive
impurities, and containing some 1iron,
nickel, and chromium 1n solution, was
used for making the static fluoride
corrosion tests,

Mixture was "Deactivated" at 950°C for 100 hr. The smallest divisions offthe

scale in the photograph are 1/100 in.

A comparison test has shown that
corrosion by untreated fluorides which
had been vigorously outgassed and then
sealed with a helium atmosphere enclosed
was not appreciably different from
that obtained when the capsules were
sealed with an air atmosphere. :

Pretreatments of the metal surface
has not been successful in minimizing
corrosion., Pickling, oxidation, and
decarburization of the metal surface
have seemed to result in increased
corrosion., The oxide film on the
surface as received seems to have
reasonably good corrosion resistance
properties, ‘ ‘

It has been found that some of the
fuel samples, whether pretreated with
structural metals or not, do contain
appreciable quantities of uranium
oxide. Sedimentation experiments in

sealed capsules have shown an in-
crease in uranium content in the lower
section of the capsule without a cor-
responding change in the fluoride

Note very severe intergranular attack.

addition, filtration of the molten
fuel through sintered stainless steel
has removed significant amounts of
black uranium oxide. However, uranium
oxide did not increase the corrosion
rate. ' '

Pretreatment of the ligquid fuel
with structural metals serves to
introduce appreciable quantities of
iron, chromium, and nickel 1nto the
fuel melt., Chemical analysis of such
fuel mixtures indicates the presence
of 600 to 1200 ppm of irom, 200 to 1000
ppm of chromium, and 30 to 200 ppm of
nickel after pretreatment although
the compounds actually involved have
not been identified. The variation in
concentration observed indicates that
not all these impurities are dissolved.
This is borne out by the fact that some
sedimentation of the iron seems to
occur during the I00-hr corrosion
tests, It also seems evident that the
nickel content of the pretreated fuels
is reduced during the subsequent cor-
rosion testing while the chromium

content 1s not, Further studies are
required, but 1t appears that con-
siderable chromium is dissolved in the
fuel and that the nickel present after
pretreatment may be electrolytically
deposited on the corrosion specimens
at the expense of chromium from the
test metal, The amounts involved are
small enough to make demonstration of
this phenomenon difficult. It seems
likely, however, that pure chromium
may have some advantages as the pre-
treatment metal,

Corrosion of Structural Metals
(H. J. Buttram, N. V. Smith, C. R.
Croft, and J. A, Griffin, Materials
Chemistry Division; A. D. Brasunas,
L. A. Abrams, and E. E. Hoffman,
Metallurgy Division). It appears from
studies to date that corrosion of
inconel and stainless steel by care-
fully handled fluoride fuels is not a
serious factor. Furthermore, improve-
ment of the pretreatment process and
of handling techniques for the pre-
treated material should result in
further improvements. Three different
fuel mixtures, the binary system
NaF-UF, (75-25 mole %), the ternary
system NaF-KF-UF, (46.5-26-27.5 mole
%), and the ternary system NaF-Bel, -UF,
(76-12-12 mole %), have each been
tested at 800 and 1000°C with no
significant difference in corrosion.
In general, the corrosion of inconel
specimens in 100 hr with each of these
fuels was of the order of 2 to 4 mils;
that of several stainless steels was
around 1 to 2 mils.

By NaF-UF,. Several static cor-
rosion tests have been completed using
the NaF-UF, fluoride mixture with a
composition 75 mole % NaF and 25 mole
% UF,. Tnconel and 347 stainless steel
were exposed for 100 hr at 1000°C
(1830°F) to the fluoride cutectic

106

which had been pretreated with these
metals for 150 hr at 150°C,

The attack by treated fluoride on
inconel, in the form of subsurface
was noted to a depth of 0.004
in. as shown in Fig. 10.2. The 347
stainless steel was less severely
attacked as may be seen in Fig. 10.3,
where the subsurface attack was limited
to 0.002 in., The nature of the cor-
rosion product has not been determined
An analysis of the fluoride bath after
testing gave the following results:

By NaF-KF-UFé. The results of
corrosion testing of stainless steel
and inconel with the NaF-KF-UF, fluoride
fuel have been very satisfactory. The
pretreatment technique has reduced the
corrosion of these metals to mnearly
negligible proportions with very little
intergranular penetration of the
specimens, The photomicrograph re-
produced as Fig. 10.4 shows a heat-
treated incoenel specimen and Fig. 10.5
shows the type of corrosion te be
expected from the NaF-KF-UF, eutectic

in 100-hr exposures at 800°C. Figure

less steel specimen, and Fig. 10.7

shows the corrosion in stainless steel
after 100 hr exposure to NalF-KF-UF,
eutectic at 800°C, The inconel speci-
men shown, attack toadepth of 2 mils,
is by no means the best specimen of
this metal tested. The stainless steel
specimen, attacked to a depth of 1 mil,
is typical of the 304, 310, 316, 330,

and 347 stainless steel samples tested.

In multiplicate experiments 1inm

been shown that the major fraction of

the corrosion observed occurs in the
first few hours. Little additional
effect 1s apparent after 1000 hr of

exposure.

the reverse of the findings listed
above for the binary fluoride mixture,

A number of fluoride-corrosion
tests were made on commercial alloys
using a mixture of 10.7 mole % BeF,,
68.0 mole % NaF, and 21.3 mole % UF,.
The materials tested are listed 1in
Table 10.1 together with notes taken
while the exposed specimens were being
studied on the metallograph and results
from bath analyses. The attack in all
cases was not severe. Some decar-
burization was observed, but this 1s
not a highly objectionable type of
surface instability.

Weight losses are undoubtedly caused
by solution of the metal sample into
the fluoride bath as indicated by bath
analyses which are also reported in
Table 10.1. Weight gains, 1in spite of

110

some loss by solution, must be in-
terpreted as absorption of one or more
bath constituents (fluoride or metal)
into the metal specimen. Comparison
of results of analyses of the fluoride

Corrosion of Piatinum (D. G, Hill,
Consultant, Materials Chemistry
Division). Thermocouples are to be
inserted in a number of ARE fuel tubes
to determine the center temperatures
of these structures. Since platinum
was suggested as the material for the
tubular thermocouple wells, 1t has
been necessary to examine the resist-
ance of this metal and of some welded
joints to the fluoride melt.

Platinum slugs immersed in the raw
or pretreated fuel, NaF-KF-UF4, in
platinum capsules showed noappreciable
corrosion as measured by weight changes.
Microscopic examination of prepared
specimens revealed occasional shallow
pitting which may have been due to
local impurities. 1In a similar test
using liquid sodium metal instead of
the fluoride fuel mixture, the platinum
metal was completely consumed. These
test data will be reported in detail
later. At this time 1t appears that
pure platinum will prove satisfactory
although perhaps nickel plating of the
material will be desirable. The brazed

above the liquid level.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Platinum specimens exposed 1n
inconel capsules in a manner such that
the metals were in contact under the
melt level showed similar and some-
what more severe pitting; pretreated
fuels caused 2 slight deposit to form
on the platinum. This deposit has
been tentatively identified as nickel
perhaps electrochemically transferred
from the i1nconel walls., Platinum
wires suspended so that they were 1n
direct electrical contact with the
inconel capsule above the melt only
and were partially immersed in the
fuel mixture showed only minor pitting
when examined by metallographic tech-
niques. The wires seemed stiffened
and slightly roughened and may possibly
have had some deposited nickel. This
type of construction, which approxi-
mates that proposed for the special
fuel tubes, will probably prove
satisfactory.

Brazed joints of platinum and in-
conel, prepared with pure silver,
copper, and nicrobraz, were shown to
be completely unsatisfactory when
immersed 1in the fuel mixture in an
inconel capsule. Both the platinum
and the inconel were seriously attacked;
the platinum virtually disappeared from
the nicrobrazed samples. Chemical
analysis, however, revealed no dis-
solved platinum in any of the fluoride
melts. Tt appears that the attack on
the welded platinum must have resulted
in finely divided dispersed metal or
electrodeposited platinum. Tt will
probably be necessary to design the
special tubes so that the inconel tube
extends beyond the active lattice and
through the coolant header, with the
brazed joint, therefore, outside
core and well above the coolant
fuel levels.

STATIC CORROSION BY MODERATOR COOLANTS

A. D.

Virtually all the work on moderator
coolants has been confined to studies
of corrosion by alkali and alkaline
earth hydroxides. These materials

have been studied under various con-

ditions 1n copper, monel, nickel,
inconel, and stainless steel Nos. 316,
321, and 347. Thus far corrosion by

sodium hydroxide has been examined at
some length, Preliminary data on
corrosion by potassium hydroxide,
barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide,
and lithium hydroxide are also pre-
sented.

The corrosion data have all been
obtained in 100-hr tests at 800, 815,
or 1000°C. 1In general, the corrosion
by hydroxides is more severe than that
by the fluoride fuels. Sodium hy-

droxide, in particular, 1s about the
most corrosive of the hydroxides
studied; the surface penetration of

inconel and several stainless steels
varies from 7 to 16 mils, Only nickel,
monel, and copper of the metals tested
with sodium hydroxide show better (mno
evidence of attack) corrosion resis-
tance. FEach of these metals, however,
1s subject to mass transfer. Cor-
rosion by potassium hydroxides 1is
severe — around 6 to 7 mils — but not
nearly sosevere as by sodium hydroxide.
The attacks by strontium and barium
hydroxide are of about the same order
of severity, 1.e., 5 to 7 mils,

 
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

To date the commercial grade and
the dehydrated commercial grade hy-
droxides have been used in most of
these experiments, and further re-
duction in corrosion rates may be
expected as purer quality hydroxides
become available. Weight changes of a
metal cofrosion specimen 1n pure
(99.8%) sodium hydroxide was less by a
factor of 3 to 4 than those obtained
with commercial grade. '

Capsule Technique with Hydroxides.
The capsule technique used so success-
fully in fuel and coolant testing has
required considerable modification for
this study. Most of the molten hy-
droxides, regardless of state of purity,
tend to crawl on the capsule surfaces
and make welding of the closed capsule
virtually impossible., Tt has been
necessary to add the powdered hy-
droxide 1n a manner such as to avoid
contact with the upper portion of the
wall and to seal the capsuvle without
melting of the material or to use a
double-capsule technique in which the
inner or test capsule is unsealed.
Neither of these technigues 1is com-
pletely satisfactory and a better
method is needed.

Corrosion by Sodium Hydroxide.
Commercial sodium hydroxide attacks
stainless steels and inconel strongly.
Monel, copper, and nickel are much
more resistant; nickel slugs exposed
to the alkali resemble electropolished
specimens. The corrosion problem with
these metals is, however, complicated
by the phenomenon of mass transfer for
which the mechanism is still in doubt.

The corrosion tests made with sodium
hydroxide. using inconel and stainless
steel specimens and container tubes
gave evidence of appreciable inter-
action. Photomicrographs of inconel

 

and 316 stainless steel specimens
exposed for 100 hr at B00°C to de-
hydrated commercial sodium hydroxide
are shown in Figs., '10.8 and 10.9,
respectively. These should be compared
with Figs. 10.4 and 10.6. A very
heavy oxide layer which contains some
metallic particles is formed on the
exposed surfaces. Purified sodium
hydroxide containing less than 0.15%
each of water and Na,CO, shows asimilar
but considerably less marked behavior
with stainless steel and inconel.
Weight changes observed on the metal
specimens in pure sodium hydroxide are
less by a factor of 3 or 4 than those
obtained in similar tests with com-
mercial material,

A photomicrograph of anickel speci-
men exposed to sodivm hydroxide is
shown in Fig, 10.10. There is no
evidence of a corrosion reaction,
although some metal loss due to solution
may have occurred. The possible
solution-deposition phenomenon
commonly referred to as "mass trans-
fer," remains the major deterrent to
the use of nickel as a hydroxide
container. An intensive study of this
phenomenon has been started, and
apparatus 1s being constructed teo
study solution deposition in a thermal
gradient under static and dynamic
conditions,

Corrosion by Potassium Hydroxide,
Potassium hydroxide tested only as the
dehydrated commercial product also
tends toattack the chromium in inconel
and stainless steel. Typical photo-
micrographs of such tests with inconel
and 316 stainless steel as shown in
Figs. 10.11 and 10.12 indicate that
the corrosion is very severe but is
not so violent as for NaQH. Nickel,
monel, and copper containers are also

attacked less severely. It seems

at least at somewhat lower tempera-
tures. Tests with pure potassium
hydroxide will be repeated as soon as
the material 1s available.

Corrosion by Other Hydroxides.
Corrosive attack by strontium and
barium hydroxides appears to be less
severe than the attack obtained in
tests with sodium hydroxide. Nickel
and copper appear moderately resistant
while inconel and stainless steel are
strongly attacked. Figure 10.13
illustrates the attack on inconel
obtained in 100 hr at 1500°F with
strontium hydroxide. This should be
compared to the sodium hydroxide attack
on inconel shown in Fig. 10.8. The
attack by strontium hydroxide on iron
and on 318 stainless steel at 1500°F
in 100 hr is illustrated in Figs. 10.14
and 10.15, respectively. The oxide
layer formed is quite heavy, especially
in the case of 1ron in which several
oxide layers (probably FeO and Fe,0,)
are evident, The eutectic mixture of
strontium and barium hydroxide did not
differ appreciably from the con-
stituent hydroxides. It should be
noted that the dehydrated commercial
materials have been used in these tests,
It is possible that the pure materials
will be less corrosive,

Lithium hydroxide tested as the
relatively pure dehydrated commercial
material seems to resemble sodium
hydroxide in its corrosive charac-
teristics. A thick layer of corrosion
product 1s formed on inconel and stain-
less steel; copper and nickel are
reasonably resistant,

parent metal of the container,
cases 1n a very uniform manner,
redeposited on certain areas of the
container or in discrete particles 1in
the liquid 1s referred to as "mass
transfer.” It 1s not certain at
present whether the phenomenon is shown
by all the other hydroxides or whether
metals other than nickel and copper
exhibit the phenomenon. There 1s also
some gquestion as to whether 1t occurs
in completely isothermal systems,

Mass transfer may be explained 1in
nonisothermal systems by assuming a
high thermal coefficient of solubility
of nickel in the fused alkali. Such
an explanation 1s acceptable 1n the
case of mass transfer in liguid metals,
but true solution of unreacted nickel
in fused alkali is somewhat harder to
accept. If the transfer can be shown
to occur 1n completely isothermal
systems, then another explanation 1is
patently required.

Chemical-Reaction Mechanism for
Mass Transfer., Jt is possible that
the mechanism of mass transfer can be
explained on the basis of chemical
reactions. For purposes of this dis-
cussion nickel 1s used as the example.
Other metals might, obviously, be
chosen.

The first stepin the reaction chain
may be either

Ni + Na,0 -——> NiO + 2Na + H,
or

2Ni + 2NaOH —> 2Ni10 + 2Na + 1,

Experimental evidence for these re-
actions is found in the work of Villard
who demonstrated the distillation of

sodium and of H, by heating a nickel
boat containing sodium hydroxide in a
Sodium and H,,

quartz tube. oT some -

times Nall, could be collected at the
cooled end of the tube, the products
depending on the conditions. Thus

the second reaction shown should in-
clude the possibility that the actual
product is NaH, This work demonstrates
that, although the free energy change
is unfavorable to the reactionsg,
reaction does occur so that, 1f a
further process displaced the equi-
librium, continued attack on the metal
might take place.

The further reaction may be the

disproportionation reaction
2N10 = Ni + Ni0,

Under the more common conditions of
aqueous solution and strong acids, the
equilibrium in this type of reaction
is far to the left. Tt is considered
possible that, in the extreme con-
ditions of high temperature and very
strongly basic solvent, the equi-
librium 1s shifted to the right. Such
reversals of equilibrium waith a change
in conditions are well known in organic
reactions, The scanty information now
available on reactions in fused sodium
hydroxide does not forbid the theory
for this unexplored mediunm. :

further reactions are certainly
possible:

NiQ, + 2NaOH = Na,NiO; + H,0

NiQ, + 2Na = NiD + Na,O

The water produced in the first of
these possibilities would react with

metallic sodium, regenerating sodium

hydroxide for further corresion, while
the Na,0 produced in the second would
be immediately available for reaction
with more nickel.

Thermodynamically the total process
is only the transfer of nickel from
impure wall metal to very pure nickel
found in the deposit; such a process
operates with a decrease of free energy
even at a constant temperature. If the
temperature varies from place to place
or from time to time, the differing
temperature coefficients of the several
reactions might operate in such a way
as to increase the rate of the process,

DYNAMIC CORROSION TESTS IN
THERMAL-CONVECTION LOOPS

E. M. Lees, ANP Division
J. L. Gregg, Consultant, ANP Division
R. B. Day, Metallurgy Division

During the period June 1 to August
31, 1951, the ANP Experimental Engi-
neering Group has continued testing
dynamic corrosion of liquid metals
on various materials in conjunction
with the Metallurgy Division. Tests
of this nature conducted in thermal-
convection loops afford a practical
means of evaluating the usefulness of
certain materials with liquid metals
or other circulating coolant, supply
fundamental information on the suita-
bility of fabricating techniques,
afford opportunities to test certain
instruments under development, and
provide experience from which adequate
techniques for operating larger scale
dynamic systems may be formulated.

Metallographic examination of six
lead-containing and three lithium-
containing loops operated during the
preceding quarter¢®’ have been com-
pleted. Operation of all but one of
these loops was prematurely (before
1000 hr) terminated, and all but one
of these failures was due to internal
obstruction in the cold zone of the
loops. In general, the corrosive
attack of both lead and lithium on the
variety of steels and alloys tested
1s most severe in the hot zone of the
loop with some attack usually apparent
in the cold zone. The solid particles
released to the circulating lead and
Jithium streams are apparently "trapped”
in the cold lead, accumulate, and
eventually plug the loop.

 

(5)"Dynamic Corrosion by Liquid Metals,”
ANP-65, op. cit., p. 150.

124

During the past quarter, primarily
sodium was tested in the thermal-
convection loops. JIn no case was
there a failure with a sodium-con-
taining convection loop in which the
failure was due to sodium corrosion.
The successful operation of loops with
sodium at 1500°F and preliminary re-
ports of metallographic examination on
loops sectioned after 1000 hr of
operation indicate quite strongly that
inconel and types 310 and 316 stain-
less steel suffer very little cor-
rosion by slowly flowing sodium at
temperatures up to 1500°F. The
successful operation of a 310 stainless
steel loop fabricated from Y%-in.-o.d.
tubing with a wall thickness of only
0.020 in. may be cited to indicate the
relative inertness of stainless steel
to sodium at 1500°F.

Corrosion by Lithium and Lead. A
number of thermal-convection loops
which were operated with lead and
lithium were examined after failure.
The hot-leg temperature was approxi-
mately 1500°F, although much higher
temperatures were obtained momentarily
when internal plugging obstructed the
natural convective flow. Failure
occasionally occurred at these higher
temperatures, not from internal cor-
rosion by the molten metal but rather
from external causes, such as arcing
or high-temperature air oxidation. As
flow restriction, due to corrosion,
was quite frequent with both lead and
lithium, so were the i1ntervals of
excessive temperature, and this
probably contributed appreciably to the
failure rate with these loops.

The life of the various loops tested
with lithium and lead, the compositions
of the loops, and metallographic notes
are given in Tables 10.3 and 10.4,
respectively. The metallographic

notes were made after examination of
random samples of the hot leg, cold
leg, and welded sections. The extent
of corrosion was dependent upon the
materials involved, the temperature,
and the time of interaction. It should
be kept in mind that the temperature
was not actually controlled but merely
attained by initially selecting a
certain power input to obtain approxi-
mately 1500°F at the beginning of the
test, when convective flow was un-
obstructed, When partial or complete
plugging developed as a result of
metal crystal formation in the cold
leg, as shown 1in Fig. 10.19, heat
losses were reduced and the hot-leg
temperature was increased. This was
corrected manually and the test was

completely plugged or until it actually
failed., A point of failure 1s shown

in Fig. 10.20.

Althongh it is accepted that the
corrosive attack in the hot zone is
appreciable, there is a general mis-
conception that attack in the cold
zone is negligible or even nonexistent,

bonded directly to the tube walls but
may merely be trapped there. The
opxide layer shown in Fig. 10.23
separates the metal crystals from the

possible. '

An attempt was made to determine
the composition of the metal crystals
by quantitative analysis. Neglecting
lead, the following elements were
detected: |

In the cold zone of a 316 stainless
steel (18% Cr, 10% Ni, 3% Mo) loop
after 138 hr of operation: 67% Fe,
6% Cr, 24% Ni, 3% Mo.

In the cold zone of a 446 stainless
steel (26% Cr) loop after 62 hr
operation: 63% Fe, 37% Cr.

The composition varied somewhat and
these values are averages of analyses
made in different areas of the cold
zones.

Corrosion by Sodium. Materials
tested with sodium during the quarter
included inconel and types 310, 316,
and 347 stainless steel. FEighteen
loops were taken out of service, 14
of which completed the scheduled 1000-
hr tests with sodium at 1500°F. Three
stainless steel (two 347, one 310)
%-in. thin-walled tubing loops failed
after less than 150 hr of operation
owing to leaks in the welds, and one
inconel loop failed after 350 hr owing
to a plugged gas line 1n the liquid
level control system; thus none of
these failures are directly attributa-
ble to the use of sodium. Included in
the 14 loops completing 1000-hr tests
was one 310 stainless steel thin-

 

walled loop. On the three loops
operating with sodium at the end of
the period, one 1inconel loop was
operated at 1600°F, and one each of
inconel and 316 stainless steel at
1500°F. The increase in successful
runs over the preceding guarter is due
largely to (1) improved methods for
purifying and introducing liquid metals
into the systems (2) improved methods
for degreasing, cleaning, and fabri-
cation, and (3) improved methods for
heating and temperature control.

The sodium-containing loops are now
being examined. Preliminary metal-
lographic examination of some of these
loops indicates very little corrosion,
Small test specimens of similar and
dissimilar composition were suspended
in the hot and cold legs of these loops.
Examination of these specimens has
indicated that although weaght changes
are small, the hot-zone specimens lost
weight but the cold-zone specimens
gained weilght,

Tt is believed that little can be
learned by operating additional thermal
loops with sodium except for the pur-
pose of testing a particular joint or
component. Although it hasbeen proved
that thermal-convection loops can be
operated without plugging and without
appreciable attack of the loop material
by sodium, it remains to be proved
that a forced-convection loop can be
operated with sodium in one section at
1500°F and 1000 to 1200°F in another
section without plugging. Therefore
future tests in figure-eight forced-
convection loops will determine whether
there will be sufficient attack on
inconel or stainless steel to result
in plugging in addition to testing
simulated components or flow channels.

The damage caused by the resulting
fire was sufficient to require com-
plete dismantling of the loop. Total
operating time for this experiment was
insufficient to test revised cleaning
procedures which i1ncluded repeated
flushing with hot sodium until the
oxide content remained low,

In an effort to prevent repetition
of loop failure being caused by
auxiliary equipment in future tests, a
General Electric electromagnetic pump
has been tested in a separate loop to
determine its reliability prior to its
installation in the figure-eight loop.
To prevent future failures due to
external electrical arcing, specifi-
cations have been drawn up for a
70,000-Btu/hr gas furnace for heating
figure-eight loops, and these specifi-
cations have been submitted to the
Purchasing Department for bids or
proposals.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND HEAT-TRANSFER RESEARCH

H. F. Poppendiek, Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The influence of the free-convection
mechanism within liquid-fuel elements
upon the fuel temperature structure 1is
being investigated both experimentally
and theoretically. Mock-up systems
which simulate the actual fuel-element
systems have been studied. Volume
heat sources were produced by means of
resistance heating, and temperatures
were measured with thermocouples. An
apparatus has been built which will be
used to study the velocities of the
free-convection cells. A theoretical
analysis of the free-convection heat
transfer existing in the fuel element
has been completed for the laminar
flow case; the turbulent flow analysis
is currently being completed. These
solutions are to be used to predict
temperature distributions in liguid-
fuel-element systems.

Five Bunsen 1ice calorimeters for
the measurement of heat capacity are
now in operation., Experimental work
and analyses have been completed for

apparatus for the determination of
thermal conductivity of solids is in
operation and additional conductivity
measurements on various densities of
boron carbide have been obtained. The
radial -flow apparatus has been com-
pleted.

Two pieces of eguipment have now
been constructed for the measurement
of liquid densities. The density of
the NaF-KF-UF, eutectic has been
determined in the range 535 to 1000°C.
The apparatus for the measurement of
viscosities is scheduled for com-
pletion by September. Work has been
retarded by delays in fabrication of
parts.

An apparatus which will be used to
determine the heat-transfer coef-
ficients of fused hydroxides and salts
has been nearly completed, These
fluids are potential reactor coolants.
Some preliminary heat-transfer data
for a boiling-mercury system have been
determined and the figure-eight lithium
system has yielded some data.

laminar flow between two parallel and
infinitely long plane bounding sur-
faces. In the system it was postulated
that heat was generated uniformiy and
that the long convection cells were in
the laminar flow regime. A report
based on this analysis 1s being pre-
pared. A similar analysis wz2ll be
made for a system in turbulent flow.
These solutions will also be duplicated
for cylindrical coordinate systems.
The solution indicates that, for a
system in which the distance between
the parallel plates 1s 0.18 in., the
axial temperature gradient is 100°F/ft
and the physical properties are identi-
cal te the measured values for the
NaF-KF-UF, eutectic; the temperature
difference which would exist 1f all
the heat were transferred by con-
duction is reduced by 25.5%. This
result is based on a value of 1 centi-
poise for the dynamic viscosity.
If the viscosity is greater than 1
centipoise, the reduction in tem-
perature difference will be smaller

than 25.5%.

Measurement of the Fuel-Element
Temperature Distribution (F. E. Lynch
and M. Tobias, Reactor Experimental
Engineering Division). A new apparatus
has been devised for measuring the
effects of free convection on the
temperature distribution in tubes
filled with fluid in which heat 1is
being generated by electrical means.
Because of the fragility and com-
plexity of previously constructed
devices, considerable difficulty has
been encountered in making a series of

Work will be started soon on lead,
bismuth, and lead-bismuth eutectic,

A modification of the original ice
calorimeter has been made and included
in the five calorimeters. The heat
content of 2 sample is measured by
noting the change in volume of a pure
ice-water mixture. The mixture is
contained in a lucite shell in which =
hollow finned copper cyvlinder 1is
sealed. The copper cylinder receives
the sample at a known temperatnre,.
Jece i1s melted in the lucite shell and,
by noting the change 1in volume i1n the
ice-water mixture, the heat content of
the sample way be calculated. To
prevent heat from getting into the
system from any source other than the
sample, the lucite shell was surrounded
by ice. However, impurities in the
surrounding i1ce lowered 1ts melting
point encugh te cause noticeable
freezing of the water in the lucite
shell., The lucite shell was therefore
surrounded by 2 in, of S:1-0-Cel
insulation contained in a steel shell.
The steel shell was kept at 0°C by
surrounding 1t by 1ce. The heat
leakage into the lucite shell was
small.

An appreciable error can occur in
the measurement of the actual tempera-
ture of the sample. At high tempera-
tures, variations of 5 to 10°C have
been found on the surface of capsules
placed in the most uniform tempera-
ture position in the furnace. It 1is
felt that tube furnaces longer than
those now in use will reduce thzs
error. Manufacturers are being con-

Thermal Conductivity of Liguids

Basel, Reactor Experimental Engineering

of the fused salt NaF-KF-U¥F, (com-
position 46,5, 26, and 27.5 mole %,
respectively)} has been measured using
the OBNL Deem type apparatus,¢!? The
average conductivity of four measure-
ments was 0.53 Btu/br fo-°F at temper-
atures ranging from 643 to T700°C.
These data were urgently needed and
no check runs were made with sodium.
As several imperfections an the design
of the apparatus have become apparent,
measurements with this apparatus have
been discontinued.

A new apparatus, the ORNL Deem type
No. 2, which has a bellows seal instead
of the Pb-Bi seal used in apparatus

plete and is scheduled for cperation

The construction of the apparatus for

Operation of the system 1s anticipated
sometime within the next month. The
first material to be tested in the

of NaF-KF-LiF having a melting point
of 454°C, Future fluids to be tested
include NaOH and the eutectic mixture

A schematic diagram of the experi-
mental system 1s given in Fig. 11.3.
The charge is first melted under vacuum
in the melt tank and then moved by
applying argon gas pressure to tank A.
In an experimental run the molten fluid
1s pushed by gas pressure through the
heat exchanger and i1nto tank B. Tank
B rests on a scale, and cumulative
welght readings are made to determine
the fluid flow rate, Temperatures of
the outside surface of the heat ex-
changer are obtained by means of
chromel-alumel thermocouples spark-
welded to the tube wall. An electric
current 1s passed through the wall of
the heat exchanger tube, and the heat
input 1s determined from the measure-
ment of this current and the voltage
drop along the heat exchanger. The
inlet and outlet temperatures of the
test fluid are measured by thermo-
couples on the tube wall in the iso-
thermal regions immediately before and
after the test section. The 1nside
wall temperature is calculated from
the outside wall thermocouple readings.
At the conclusion of a run, lasting
approximately 30 min, the fluid 1is
pushed through the return line 1nte

Preliminary results
obtained for the
experiment owing to condenser failure
in the high-frequency induction heater
employed as a heat source. However,
using pure mercury, temperature dif-
ferences of approximately 100°F were
observed between the metal surface
and the boiling fluid for a heat flow
rate of about 50,000 Btu/hr ft2?, The
large temperature difference observed
in this case was probably due to non-
wetting of the heat-transfer surface
by the boiling mercury. In addition,
considerable temperature fluctuations
were observed in the boiling liguid,
accompanied by bumping. The apparatus
has been moved to a new location to
utilize another induction heater, and
further results will be forthcoming.

Heat Transfer im Molten Lithium
(C. P. Coughlen and H. C. Claiborne,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division)., During the past quarter
the figure-eight lithium system was
placed in operation, and preliminary
heat-transfer data were obtained. To
remedy pump and instrumentation dif-
ficulties whichwere encountered during
operations, extensive alterations have
been made and a new Einstein-Szilard
pump has been obtained on loan from
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company.
The new pump will permit operation
over a

much larger range of velocities
in the

test heat exchanger.

The experimental results obtained
with a concentric-pipe heat exchanger
are preliminary because of the 1im-
perfect operation of the auxiliary
squipment which prevented the attain-
ment of complete equilibrium and
because of the low flow rates obtainable
(1140 to 1600 lb/hr in the annulus and
980 to 1150 1b/hr in the core pipe).

 

1951

Separation of the i1ndividual heat-
transfer coefficients was not possible
under these conditions.

The overall heat-transfer co-
efficients determined experimentally
ranged from 4100 to 5160 Beu/hr-ft?-°F,
Heat balances checked to within 24%
with an average deviation of 12.5%.
The major errors in the heat-balance
data undoubtedly resulted from in-
complete equilibrium and the un-
certainty itn the flow measurements.

A comparison of the Nusselt modulus
computed from the experimental data
with that of Lyon(?) and that of
Isakoff and Drew('?) is shown in Fig.
11.4. The experimental values are 16
to 80% higher than those found by
Isakoff and Drew when using mercury

for an L/D = 38. Saince L/D % 30 for

the lithium heat exchanger, the
Nusselt modulil are expected to be
somewhat higher than those for a

It is interesting to note that
welded joints with average penetration
of 70% of the header thickness of
0.062 in, exhibited strength and
ductility comparable to welds with
complete penetration. Failures in both
types of joints occurred in the heat-
affected zone immediately adjacent to
the weld, as would be expected since
this area 1s that of minimum cross-
section. Partial penetration requires
considerably less critical control

of the variables of the cone-arc
method, Complete penetration 1is more
142

difficult to achieve with consistency,
and 1t is expected that even more
difficulty will be encountered when
experiments with thinner header sheets
and smaller tubing are attempted.

Strength values for joints brazed
with nicrobraz in preliminary experi-
ments are included in Table 12.1. The
lower tensile strength and somewhat
higher elongation of these specimens
may be attributed to the annecaling
received in the brazing operation,
Brazing of basic joints for evaluation
and comparison with welded joints will
recelve major consideration in future
work.

fatigue Tests, In order to evaluate
further the quality of tube-to-header
joints, a rotating tubular beam fatigue
test was developed. The header plate
is immovably clamped with the tube
extending into a rotating eccentric
cam. The test is effectively torsion-
less since the eccentric cam, within
which the tube end rides, i1s equipped
with roller bearings, Specimens were
5.8 1n, long and were rotated at 1125
rpm at a pre-set deflection. '

A limited number of data are pre-
sented as an S-N scatter band curve in

Fig, 12.1. Further tests are necessary
for conclusive evaluation. It may be
noted, however, that welds incorpo-
rating complete penetration, whether
manual inert arc, cone arc, or brazed,
exhibited superioer fatigue life to
those joints with partial penetration.
This condition was not evident on ex-
amination of tensile data. The lower
fatigue life of these welds may be
attributed to the lack of penetration,
and, as a result, the presence of a
"notceh."™ The evaluation of fatigue,

All-Weld-Metal Tensile Tests. The
properties of weld deposits in inconel
plate are of interest since the ARE
reactor shell and other components
will be fabricated from thick plate,
A limited number of tests have been
conducted using Y-in. inconel plate
and various filler metals to provide
all-weld metal 0,357-1n. tensile
specimens., The remaining weld deposits
were reserved for quantitative analysis
and static corrosion tests in liquaid
sodium and a fluoride fuel mixture.

TABLE

The results of room-temperature
tensile tests are presented in Table
12.2. 1t may be noted that the physi-
cal properties of the inert-arc and
metal-arc weld metal were comparable
with one exception. The weld deposit
of the Inco No. 42 welding rod was
definitely inferior. This rod was
designed for oxyacetylene welding;
however, chemical analysis being con-
ducted may explain these relatively
inferior physical properties.

15 expected that the use of Dy-Chek
(a compound used to check for flaws
in welds), followed by microscopic
examination of weld surfaces, hydraulic
pressure testing of assemblies, and
helium leak testing will prove useful
in detecting major flaws., This prﬁw

Samples of the weld deposit from

treated in liguid sodium at 1000°C for
100 hr and in a ligquid sodium-—po-
tassium—uranium fluoride mixture at
816°C for 100 hr, There was no sig-
nificant loss or gain in weight of auny
of the sawples. Metallographic ex-
amination indicated a weld immunity to
attack by these liquid metals during
the interval of test,

A recent prob-
because of de-

Special Weld Tests.
Jem which has arisen
parture from the tube-to-header type
of reactor involves sealing off of the
inconel tubing under a positive helium
pressure, Preliminary experiments have
been performed which indicate that
pressures of 25 psig of helium can be
held within inceonel tubing by appli-
cation of mechanical pressure to crimp
the tubing. While still under mechani-
cal pressure, the tubing is sheared
from the pressure source and is then
welded shut, Pressure-tight tubes with
gages brazed on one end for verifi-
cation have been subjected to swaging

 

experiments in an attempt to accomplish
a uniform cylindrical closure more

suitable to the newly proposed ARE
design,

Another recent problem involves the
use of a hydroxide as a cooling medium
in preference to sodium. Negotiations
are 1in progress with the International
Nickel Company for cladding of welded
inconel tube-to-header pairs with
various thicknesses of nickel. These
test specimens will be evaluated for
corrosion properties as plated and
atter diffusion treatment, Plating
experiments with nickel and copper
will also be conducted at Oak Ridge
using the facilities of the Research

The installation of equipment in
the creep laboratory is essentially
complete, The installation in the
stress-rupture laboratory for testing
in liquid metal 1s about 7T0% complete
and 1t 1s hoped that testing can be
started in September.
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The creep-testing program was
started early in June. The initial
emphasis was to traln nine new tech-
nicians as well as to determine proper
operating conditions for the equip-
ment, Preliminary results from creep
tests on 316 stainless steel, inconel,
and niobium have shown that the labo-
ratory is functioning properly. These
early results are affected by some
inaccuracies which are being overcome.

Creep of 316 Stainless Steel.
Duplicate sheet specimens of 316
stainless steel (0.500- by 0.065-in.
reduced section) have been loaded to
3000, 4000, 6000, 7000, and 8000 psa
at 815°C in an argon atmosphere. There
1s considerable scatter of the results,
and this work 1s being repeated with
closer attention to details. The
scatter probably reflects the struc-
tural i1nstability of the stainless
steel.

Creep of Inconel. Sheet specimens
of 1inconel in the as-received temper
(0.500- by 0.065-in. reduced section)
have been loaded to 3000, 5000, 6000,
and 8000 psi at 815°C in an argon
atmosphere., Duplicate tests check
very well, and the results are close
to the published data. Also, speci-
mens were heated to 1120°C in vacuum
for 2 hr and air-cooled; the treatment
increased the grain size by a factor
of about 16. Following this anneal,
specimens were loaded to 5000 and 8000
psi. At B00O psi there was close
agreement between duplicate tests, but
the rupture life was much shorter than
With

the 5000-ps1
vs., time curves for the coarse- and
fine-grained materials were nearly
identical. Loadings of coarse- and
fine-grained material will be made at
3000 psi; it 1s expected that the

coarser grained material will have a
considerably longer rupture life at
this and lower stress levels.

Severe intergranular cracking has
been observed on the inconel sheet
specimens. These cracks appear to
originate at the edge. To see if this
is truly an edge effect, one inconel
0.505-in. bar specimen has been loaded
to 3000 psi. Unless the same type of
cracks develops on the round bar, it
can be assumed that this type of crack-
ing is an edge phenomenon and need be
considered only in the rare case 1in
which exposed and stressed edges occur.

Creep of Niobium. Two niobium
specimens were loaded to rupture at
815°C in argon. Rupture occurred at
26,000 psi with about 20% elongation.
One specimen loaded to 6000 psi has
been in test for 650 hr with a negli-
gible elongation. Work on niobium has
been temporarily suspended pending
delivery of additional sheet stock.

Creep Test of Loaded Inconel Tube,
A study is being made of the effects
of multicomponent stress systems on
creep. An inconel tube % in. in o.d.
with the wall thickness reduced to
0.010 in., for a length of 3% in. was
sealed at one end and loaded to 66.6
psi internal pressure with argon. The
tube was heated to 1800°F, and the
pressure was maintained until the tube
ruptured, the failure being longi-
tudinal. This loading gave the follow-
ing stresses:

Tangential 1500 psi (tension)

I.ongitudinal 750 psi (tension)

Radial 35 psi (compression)

A similar sheet specimen loaded in
tension to 1500 psi at 1800°F ruptured

STRESS-RELAXATION TESTS

R. B. Oliver, Metallurgy Division

Eight simulated stress-relaxation
tests for type 316 stainless steel
were conducted at stress levels of
5000, 10,000, and 20,000 psi using the
Baldwin creep-rupture machine. All
tests were made at a temperature of
1500°F. After 16 hr the stress was
about 4600 to 4800 psi regardless of
the initial stress level. Stress-
relaxation curves are also to be
obtained for inconel and nickel A,

Design work for stress-relaxation
tests on inconel bolts in sodium at
1500°F has been completed, but con-
struction of the equipment has not
been finished.

FUEL-ELEMENT FABRICATION

G. M. Adamson £. S, Bomar
J. H. Coobs

Metallurgy Division

The work on fabrication of solid
fuel elements has progressed along the

 

lines discussed in the last report. (!
An additional fabrication technique,
rubberstatic pressing, is now also be-
ing i1nvestigated., With all fabri-
cation technigques the use of a screened
fraction of sintered;UO2 seems to be
desirable,

Hot Rolling. After a plate has
been fabricated by hot-rolling it is
desirable that it be drawn to final
size, Since a suitable drawbench is
not available, cold-rolling was sub-
stituted, A set of plates was fabri-
cated by the procedure outlined in
OBNL-987. They were hot-rolled at
1100°C to a reduction of 75%, Six
plates, each containing 30% U0, , were
made; three had matrices of iron and
three of 302 stainless steel. Plates
from each set were then given additional
cold reductions of 1CQ, 25, and 50% by
hand-rolling., The plates with iron
matrices rolled very well, showing
only minor evidence of segregation
of the UO,. However, the units with
matrices of stainless steel suffered
considerable segregation and striation
of the UO,. 1In neither case was the
bond between the core and cladding
material altered. Figures 12.2 and
and 12.3 are representative of this
work.

To determine the effect of using
coarse U0, in the fabrication of cores
a high-temperature induction furnace
was assembled, A toctal of 330 g of a
special high-purity UQ, was sintered
at 2100°C in a hydrogen atmosphere.
The average weight change amounted to
a loss of 0.5%. After being sintered
the coarse fragments of U0, were
uniformly gray in color and quite hard.
The apparent density had been increased
by a factor of 3. The sintered product
was then ground and divided into
various size ranges by screening.

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

The -100, +200 mesh size fraction
of the U0, was mixed in two batches
with -100 and -325 mesh 302 stainless
steel. Compacts were prepared in the
usual manner and rolled at 1120°C to
reductions of 50, 75, and 90%. Me-
tallographic examination indicated
segregation of the coarse U0, (Fig.
12.4a) to be less semsitive to the
particle size of the matrix stainless
steel powder than is normal UQO,
(Fig. 12.4b). However, a tendency to
agglomerate into localized groups for
reductions greater than 75% was noted.
There was alsoc some evidence of the
U0, particles penetrating into the
cladding layers.,

To conserve on stainless steel an
attempt was made to use mild steel
tubing instead of stainless as the
protective covering. The samples
were rolled at 1100°C; however, they
were heavily oxidized before receiving
the first pass through the mill. On
metallographic examination it was
evident that the oxidizing conditions
had penetrated to the compact and had
prevented adequate bonding. Further
tests will be made, and it is hoped
that a satisfactory atmosphere may be
obtained by changing the adjustment on
the gas dissociator.

Mechanically Formed Matrix. The
work in the X-10 Shops on developing
a method for punching molybdenum
plates and obtaining a high percentage
of open area, has been held up waiting
the delivery of carbide punches., Other
methods of forming a suitable mechani-
cal matrix are being placed on an in-
active basis until the accompanying
bonding problems have been solved. A
low-temperature induction furnace 1is
being assembled for these solid-phase
bonding studies., Bonding will be
tried both with and without load. The

 

furnace 1is nearly completed and 1is
expected to be placed 1in operation. as
soon as the induction furmaces are

ready.

Loose-Powder Sintering. Work on the
sintering of loose powders 1is:
being carried out 1n our own furnaces.
The first run was to be one of a series

now

to determine optimum sintering temper-
ature and was to be run at 1250°C.
Instead of the intended as-received
UD,, a size fraction {-100, +325 mesh)
of the high-density sintered UOQ, was
used by mistake. With 30% coarse U0,
in 320 stainless steel a fair bond was
found at 1250°C., JIncreasing the
temperature to 1280°C did not give a
definite improvement in the bond.
Another sample using regular UO, was
prepared and sintered as above; how-
ever, very little bond was obtained.

Rubberstatic Pressing. Rubberstatic
pressing has been used during this
quarter as an additional fabrication
technique. A drawing (Fig. 12.5)
shows how this procedure may be used
to press a powder layer onto the inner
surface of a tube. Pressure applied
to the steel punches is transmitted
through the rubber and presses the
powder tightly onto the inner side of
the tube. This 1s followed by a
sintering operation. This technique
is being used as a fabrication method
on both 'solid fuel elements and con-

‘trol rods.

In the first specimen tried in the
fuel-element work the lower half of
the powder layer was 302 stainless
stee}l, and the upper half was electro-
lytic iron. After being pressed under
40 tsi and sintered at 1250°C, the
stainless steel was well bonded
but the iron had pulled away during
sintering, A series of samples was

compatibility of UQ,-iron or U0, —302
stainless steel cores in contact with
316 stainless steel, cladding sections
of hot-rolled plates were sealed 1in

contents were held at 1000°C for
100 hr. Metallographic examination
disclosed a diffusion layer of less
than 0.00]1 in. between the 1ron cores
and the 316 cladding and none between
the 316 cladding and the 302 cores.
Both of these results were in agree-
ment with earlier tests,

CONTROL-ROD FABRICATION

This group i1s now starting work on
the fabrication of control rods for
the ARE. While hot-rolling and rubber-
static pressing are both being in-
vestigated as possible fabrication
procedures, the most likely method, at
present, seems to be a simple canning
of powders. Materials now being in-
vestigated as possible control ma-
terials are B4C and HfOz, but the
investigation 1s being expanded to
include development of refractory
boron, hafnium, or cadmium compounds,

As a preliminary investigation ZrQ,
was used as a substitute for Hf02, and
some plates were prepared with the
standard hot-rolling technique. While
these two compounds are similar chemi-
cally, there is a considerable differ-
ence in their density; however, it is
not likely to affect this preliminary
work. Cores with 30% by volume of
ZrOzijlnickel, iron, and 302 stainless
steel were fabricated. They were clad
with nickel or 316 stainless steel by
hot-rolling at 1100°C. Table 12.3 is

vestigation.

METAL CLADDING OF BERYLLIUM OXIDE
Gerity Michigan Company of Adrian,
Michigan, has been attempting to
developa plating procedure for cladding
beryllium oxide. The only oxide
readily available at the beginning of
this investigation was some high-fired
material left from the Daniels
and several crucibles of low-density
porous material. The high-faired
material had a dark film on the sur-
face which prevented any bonding. The
porous material introduced considerable
difficulty from gases and/or solutions

reactor

becoming entrapped in the pores and
then forming blisters during subsequent
heating., If this problem can be
solved, the Gerity investigators are
gquite optimistic that a successful
cladding may be plated on. However,
two samples which they gave us and
which appeared to be satisfactory did
not have enough mechanical bond to
allow mounting for metallographic

152

study. They have been asked to give
this phase of the work a2 low prioraity
and to push their electroforming

investigation.

REFRACTORY METALS

A survey of the literature on
molybdenum and niobium has been under-
taken in preparation for future work
with these metals. Simple tests are
being run on available specimens to
confirm or disprove some of the
questionable data.

13. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

Research in the ANP Chemistry
Group has, as indicated by previous
reperts in this series, been con-
cerned almost entirely 1n the past
with development of liquids for use
as aircraft reactor fuels. While
such studies stil]l constitute an
appreciable fraction of this effort,
the program has been broadened 1nmn
recent months to include study of
nonmetallic liquids for use as
moderators and/or heat-transfer
fluids (coolants) for such a re-
actor. These researches have 1in-
cluded a small number of physical
property determinations, as well as
the phase-equilibrium and thermal-
stabi1lity studies necessary to
demonstrate the chemical properties
of the liquids.

Nine fluoride-fuel systems, both
ternary and quaternary, may be singled
out as covering a useful range of
uranium concentration {up to about
200 1b of uranium per cubic foot)
and with satisfactory melting points
(below 550°C). UF,;, which might be
used as a fluoride-fuel component,
has been prepared with only 0.8 wt %
of impurities. In the development
of homogeneous reactor fuels, solu-
tions of UO; in NaOH-Na,B,0, show
promise, together with the NaOH-L10H
system previocusly developed.

The moderator-coolant program
requires a stable (at 800°C) hy-
drogenous liquid with good heat-
transfer properties. Yhile sodium

1s an acceptable heat-transfer
medium, the existence of a corrosion-

resistant container for this fluid
at this temperature has not been
demonstrated. For these studies
quantities of sodium hydroxide
assaying better than 99.8% NaOH by
welght are now routinely prepared.
In addition, potassium hydroxide,
barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide,
lithium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide,
and several binary hydrogenous
systems are being considered for this
application.

The development of nonmetallic
coolants has been largely confined
to consideration of non-uranium-
bearing fluoride systems 1n con-
Junction with the fuel development
program. Eleven fluoride systems of
usable liquid range and low cor-
rosiveness are listed, although thear
heat-transfer properties are not
sufficiently well known to permit
evaluation of their usefulness.

FUEL DEVELOPMENT

Research on liquid fuels 1s still
directed toward development of low-
melting solutions of UF, 1in alkala
and alkaline earth fluorides and
toward development of self-moderating
fuels, with the former program having
the major emphasis. Research on the
fluorides has progressed so that 1t
is possible to list nmine liquad
systems, covering a wide range of
uranium concentrations, which have
satisfactory melting points. Ul,,

investigation of systems containing
lithium fluoride. From an inspection
of Table 13.1 1t 1s apparent that
lithium fluoride would be a valuable
addition to the list of possible
fuel components. The most valuable
mixtures without LiF would seem to be
the first three listed in the table.

The various fuel systems studied
during the period are discussed
briefly under appropriate headings
below.

NaF-LiF-UF, Previous studies(S$)
had indicated the existence of a
low-melting region in this ternary
diagram around 31 mele % UF, and
16 mole % NaF. Recent data have
permitted construction of the equi-
librium diagram, as shownin Fig. 13.1.
The low-melting region covers a wide
area on the diagram; two separate
eutectic points apparently exist
inside the 550°C contour.

KF-LiF-UF, Substitution of KF
for NalF resulted in higher melting
points in nearly all parts of the
diagram. The areas showing melting
points below 525°C are very small
although the 550°C contour encloses
a large area of the diagram. The

these preliminary studies products
of varying purity were obtained for
study. Typical material from these
runs was shown to be a black material
of specific gravity 8.83 (X-ray
density 9.06) which was inscluble 1n
all except oxidizing solvents.
Chemical analysis showed the material
to be about 90 wt % UF,.

Experiments 1n cooperation with
personnel from the Mass Spectrometer
Group of the Stable Isotopes Division
showed that 10 to 12 wt % UF, was
left unreacted i1n the product. It

 
L]

was shown that at 750°C UF, is stable
under 10°° mm Hg but that at 800°C
the disproportionation into UF, and
metallic uranium 1s significant; the
disproportionation rate increases
rapidly with temperature.

Since 1t appeared that low-tem-~
perature reaction for prolonged
periods with proper precautions to
ensure homogeneity of the reaction
mass and to prevent build-up of re-
action products on unreacted UF,
offered the optimum conditions for
preparationof pure UF,, the following
procedure was adopted: Pure UF, was
vacuum~dried at 450°C for several
hours and ground te pass a 200-mesh
seive. This UF, was charged into a
10-in.-long by 3~in.~diameter stain-
less steel container with the stoi-
chiometric quantity of clean uranium
turnings and several stainless steel
balls. The reagents were again
vacuum-dried at 450°C for several
hours befere reduction of the uranium
to powder by repeated formation and
decomposition of UH;. After final
decomposition of the hydride, the
container was evacuated and sealed.
The contents were homogenized by
grinding with the steel balls. The
reaction was allowed to proceed 16 hr
at 900°C, and, after cooling and
grinding of the contents, the sealed
container was maintained at 900°C an
additional 8 hr.

The product of this reaction has
been shown by chemical analysis teo
be 99.2 wt % UF;. This material is
of sufficient purity for use 1in
phase equilibrium studies. It seems
likely that this material is of
considerably higher purity than any
which has previously been produced
elsewhere. A report on this research
will be i1ssued in the near future.

 

Homogeneous Fuels (J. D. Bedman
and L. G. Overholser, Materials
Chemistry Division). The high
solubility of uranium as UO; in
mixtures of sodium and lithium hy-
droxides has been discussed in a
previous report.¢’’ This solution
might well be of interest as a
homogenecus fuel 1f separated lithium
isotopes were available and 1f the
corrosive liguid could be contained.
A small amount of research has been
done to ascertain whether similar
solubility of uranium can be demon-
strated with other hyvdroxide-bearing
materials.

The data in Table 13.2 indicate
that mixtures of barium hydroxide
with lithium or sodium hydroxide are
of little value in this connection.
It 15 established that, at moderately
high temperatures, the solubility of
uranium 1ncreases with temperature
and with increasing concentration of
lithium hydroxide; the solubility at
750°C, however, never reaches a value
high enough to be of interest as a
fuel.

MODERATOR-COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

To be effective as a modera-
tor—heat-transfer fluid for the
aircraft reactor the ligquid must
obviously have good heat-transfer
properties, must be thermally stable
above 800°C, and must contain hy-
drogen. Hydrogen-bearing compounds

162

with the required thermal stability,
even without regard to probable
radiation stability, are not numerous.

Development of moderator coolants
1s concerned at present primarily
with preparation of very pure alkali
and alkaline earth hydroxides and
with phase equilibrium studies of
various mixtures of these materials
with other compounds. In so far as
ligquid ranges, moderating power, and
heat-transfer properties are con-
cerned, several of the materials and
mixtures tested could be considered
satisfactory. In addition to the
pure hydroxides several binary hy-
drogenous systems, such as hydroxide-
hydroxide, hydroxide-fluoride, and
hydroxide-borate, are being examined.

Preparation of sodium hydroxide
assaying better than 99.8% NaOH by
weight has been placed on a routine
basis. Pure potassium hydroxide has
not yet been prepared in guantity
although small-scale preparations
using recrystallization from isopropyl
alcohol have been accomplished. Pure
barium hydroxide, prepared by re-
crystallization from aqueous solution
followed by dehydration of the re-
sulting octahydrate, should soon be
available 1n sufficient quantity for
corrosion and physical property
testing. Methods for purification
of lithium and rubidium hydroxides
are sti1ll under study.

Obviously, the atmosphere in the

free of carbon dioxide and water.
This 1s accomplished in the case of
the flasks by introducing purified
nitrogen. This gas 1s used to force
the solution from flask C into flask

reduce bumping during the removal of
alcohol. The nitrogen atmosphere

The results of several runs in-
dicate that pure sodium hydroxide
may also be obtained by removal of
carbonate from a concentrated aqueous
solution of the hydroxide, followed
by dehydration at 450°C under vacuum.
For this method a 50 wt % solution of
sodium hydroxide is made up in a
wax-lined vessel, the suspended
sodium carbonate 1s removed by
firltration, and the clear filtrate
1s dehydrated in a nickel vessel,
first at 200°C and finally at 450°C

under vacuum.

The results of the analysis of
sodium hydroxide purified by this
method are given in Table 13.5. A
comparison of these data with those
given previously indicates that the
hydroxide may be about as effectively
purified by this method as by the
ethyl alcohol process. This method
may be applied to quantity production
more easily than the ethyl alcohol
process.

(D. E. Nicholson, C. W. Harvill,
and D. R. Cuneo, Materials Chemistry
Division; F. A. Vingiello, Hesearch
Participant, Materials Chemistry
Division; and BR. P. Metcalf, Physics
Division). Preliminary studies
have shown that potassium hydroxide
cannot be purified by the ethyl
alcohol process used for sodium
hydroxide. Apparently the potassium
hydroxide~~alcoholate i1s extremely
soluble in ethyl alcohol and also
is relatively low melting and probably
more stable than the cerresponding
sodium compound. Limited success
has been obtained by using iscpropyl
alcoheol, and a study of the use of
this compound and of other alcohols 1s
underway.

Equipment 1s being set up for the
purification of strontium and barium
hydroxides. The method used entails
separation of the insoluble carbonate
in aqueous solution, recrystallization
as the octahydrate, and finally de-
hydration under carefully controlled
conditions. The secup, which is
constructed of nickel, should permit
purification of pound batches of the
hydroxides. - '

Purified lithium hydroxide mono-
hydrate, availlable commercialiy, was
debhydrated at 200°C under vacuum.
The dehydrated material so obtained
contains approximately 0.1% lithium
carbonate and less than 0.,1% water.
Rubidium hydroxide, reported to be
99.5% pure, was found to contain
approximately 5% carbonate and 15%
water. The dehydration of this
material is being investigated at
present.

been confined to a study of the
decompesition pressures of barium
hydroxide hydrates and anhydrous
barium hydroxide. The existence of
the monohydrate and octahydrate has
been established by numerocus ex-
perimenters, but there appears to be
some doubt regarding the existence of
the trihydrate. The decomposition
pressures for the following systems
have been reported:(%+19)

These references also include com-
parable data for the strontium hy-
droxide systems. It mlght be noted
that for anhydrous barium hydroxide
the decomposition pressure reaches
1 atm at about 1000°C and the cor-
responding temperature for anhydrous
strontium hydroxide 1s 700°C. The
hydrates exert too high pressures at
elevated temperatures to be of very
much practical value.

Pressure measurements have been
made on barium hydroxide systems by
means of two different types of ap-
paratus. One type uses a nickel
chamber equipped with a diaphragm
for containing the sample, and the
pressure exerted against the diaphragnm
is measured by balancing against a
known pressure on the opposite side

was used for measuring the pressure
of a sample of barium hydroxide ap-

relatively low temperatures. Values
obtained are given in Table 13.6.
These values are 1n fair agreement
with those reported in the literature.
Measurements were not made at higher

in temperature control.

The other type of apparatus
employed a tin manometer,using
nitrogen to balance the manometer.
Experiments with this apparatus
using barium hydroxide containing
about 2% water showed no measurable
pressure at 370°C. For material
corresponding to barium hydroxide
monohydrate, a pressure 1n excess
of 1 atm at 390°C was observed.
These measurements are all of a
preliminary nature and additional
work must be done before any con-
clusive results will be forthcoming.

Binary Hydroxide Systems (K. A.

C. J. Barton and J. P. Blakely,

166

system Ba(OH),-Sr(OH), has been
studied in some detail by thermal-
analysis methods because these
materials have been reported to be
somewhat less corrosive than the
alkali hydroxides. Figure 13.6
shows the completed phase diagram
for this system. There is evidence
for a solid transition in the com-
position range near the eutectic.
While these researches were made with
dehydrated commercial materials
which contained some carbonate, 1t
is safe to say that mixtures of
usefully low melting point are
available in this system., It 1s
likely, however, that the decom-
position pressures are relatively

high at 1500°F.

The system L10OH-NaOH has been
examined because certailn mixtures
of these materials dissolve ap-
preciable quantities of UO;. The
equilibrium diagram is shown in
Fig. 13.7. The low-melting eutectic
(219°C) contains 27 mole % LiOH;
there 1s evidence of a compound
NaOH*LiOH with incongruent melting
point. The thermal effects observed
at about 180°C are probably due to a
solid transition.

Phase diagrams for the systems
NaOH-KQOH, NaOH-RbOH, and RbOH-KOH
have been reported. (1) Phase
studies of the other possible com-
binations will be deferred until
more pressing problems are finished
or until it becomes clear that one of
the systems offers appreciable ad-
vantages from the corrosion stand-
point.

RADIATION DAMAGE

D. S. Billington, Physics of Solids Institute

A. J. Miller, Research Director’s Division

Radiation damage and radiation-
induced corrosion in the prime con-
stituents of the airplane reactor core
have been under examination during the
past few months. The X-10 graphite
pile, the Y-12 cyclotron, and the
Berkeley cyclotron have been utilized
as radiation sources., The limitations
in the significance of the information
being obtained are due mainly to the
low flux i1n the graphite pile and the
lack of methods for correlating effects
of accelerator particles with those of
pile radiations. In addition, the
Berkeley cyclotron has a low beam
current, and the Y-12 cyclotron needs
a more uniform beam and efficient
target~cooling mechanisms that will
allow it to be used for irradiating

after approximately
100 hr of operation. Up to this test
time there appears to be slightly less

about 10% greater creep strain after
200 hr and nearly 20% more strain than
the corresponding bench test after

about 250 hr, Type 347 stainless steel

stress was 1500 psi, and the tempera-

ature was 1500°F.

The creep of 347 stainless steel

of 1500 psi has been measursd by the
cantilever creep apparatus in the X-10

reported here the duration of the test
is much longer and the total strains
much qmaller than 1n any other reported
creep tests under irradiation. This
could, in view of the ignorance of the
mechanisms accounting for creep defor-
mation at slower rates, be responsible
for the apparent difference in results.

These creep measurements under
irradiation will be supplemented by a
tensile creep apparatus which is being
designed for use with the LITR. This
tensile apparatus will provide amn
independent check of the cantilever
creep apparatus measurements of creep
under irrvradiation. Anocther creep

The effect of radiation on the
stability of the molten fluoride fuel
contained in inconel is currently under
investigation using the X-10 pile and

of irradiated samples are not yet

analysis of the first cyclotron-

pressure build-up under pile irradi-

Corrosion data on the first three
capsules irradiated are given in
Table 14.1. There is no evidence of
accelerated corrosion due to 1irradi-
ation.

Micrographs were made of cross-
sections 1n the i1rradiated and un-
irradiated zones of the capsule from
run 1. These micrographs(8) show
that in some areas, apparently dis-
tributed at random through the irradi-
ated zone, an 1increase 1n graln size
has taken place. No conclusions have
been drawn yet as to the nature of
this change. The microhardness was
found to have an average value of 89.5
Knoop hardness numbers in the irradi-
ated zone and 89.3 in the unirradiated,
compared with an average of 106.5 over
the whole surface before bombardment.

Additional irradiations of molten
lithium 1n iron capsules have been
carried out, and the analytical re-
sults are being obtained. This will
complete the study of lithium 1in 1iron
for the present time. The next series
of irradiations will be made on molten

Nuclear Development Associates,

As a result of an extensive analysis
of the supercritical water reactor
first proposed in WASH-24,(?) Nuclear
Development Associates has advanced
detailed specifications for a feasible
desi1gn, The reactor and shield com-
prise an ll-ft-diameter sphere of
water with a 2.5-ft square-cylinder
active core at its center., The reactor
will deliver 400 megawatts
maximum wall temperature of 1290°F and

with a

a fuel investment of approximately 25
1b. The proposed fuel elements are of
the sandwich design considered in the
last quarterly report,(?) and the core
design utilizes a flat neutron flux.
The pressure shell introduced some
problem of weight, but the overall
shield weight, 180,000 1b, remains well

within specifications,

OUTLINE OF A SPECIFIC DESIGN

Apart from some insertions {(pressure
shell, thermal shield for pressure
shell, gamma-ray shadow shielding cap,
flow headers, etc.) the reactor and
its shield may be approximately
visualized as an 1ll-ft-diameter sphere
of water, in the interior of which are
spaced some 200 parallel fuel assemblies

to form a 2.5-ft sgquare-cylinder

FUEL ELEMENTS AND ASSEMBLIES

Further consideration of the fuel-
element possibilities discussed 1in
the last quarterly report¢3’ has led
to the selection of an oxide type
element, The use of powder metallurgy
technigques to form a fuel sandwich
composed of a sintered UO, and stain-
less steel powder layer rolled between
two pieces of stainless steel seems
particularly attractive. The original
work at ORNL‘3***’ produced successful
sandwiches of this type with an over-
all thickness of 30 mils; however,
other research has indicated that this

figure might be lowered considerably,
The powder metallurgy technique dis-
tributes the UO, in separate tiny
pockets in the interior of, in effect,
an otherwise continuous piece of
stainless steel. It appears that there
will be sufficient free volume to
accept the fission gases at moderate
pressure, Thus, pending in-pile tests
of this fuel-element type, we are
inclined toward some optimism regard-
ing 1ts chances for ultimate success-
ful development.

A stainless steel (347 or 316 Nb)
sandwich of 20 mils total thickness,
with the central layer about 10 mils
thick and containing, some 10% UO, by
volume, 1s suitable. There are many
conceivable ways of arranging such
plates into assemblies. Figure 15.2
illustrates one arrangement designed
to give stiffness, maintain spacings,
permit thermal expansions, etc. Here
alternate flat and corrugated fuel
plates are stacked to fill a square
unfueled tube. The contact of the two
fueled walls has been estimated from
NACA-TN-2257 to run 30°F hotter than

the average metal wall temperature,

REACTIVITY

It appears desirable to keep the
thermal-neutron flux radially flat in the
core to minimize the amount of stain-
less steel needed for heat-transfer
purposes, If the amount of fuel
needed was dependent only upon the
amount of steel used, then this flat-
flux design would obviously minimize
the critical mass as well, Furthermore
it 1s actually found, with appropriate
simplifying assumptions, that uniform
thermal flux in the core does accompany
minimum critical mass, Thus flattening
the neutron flux operates directly to.

minimize the fuel content, as well as
indirectly by minimizing the amocunt of
steel,

The problem solved was the follow-
ing: Given a region containing
moderator and given some fuel (pure
fissionable material, or a definite
mixture of fissionable material and
structure)}, what is the minimum amount
of the fuel and how should 1t be
distributed in the moderator in order
to obtain a ecritical assembly? By
assuming that (1) the reactor is
thermal, and (2) the volume occupied
by the fuel is negligible, 1t was
proved that there 1s a region in the
moderator in which fuel should be
placed, and in this region the thermal
flux should be constant. The fuel

182

distribution can be obtained for
suitably shaped systems.

The above restrictions are well
satisfied for pure U?3% immersed in
an infinite sea of water, heavy water,
beryllium, or carbon. Thus we are
now in a position to calculate the
minimum critical mass of a chain-
reacting assembly moderated by any of
the usual moderators. This calculation
has not yet been carried out. A
calculation for the same power output,
and the results of an illustrative
calculation using the same power
output and with the same assumptions
otherwise, comparing a reactor with
uniform fuel-tube loading with the
flat-flux reactor has been made. Both
reactors had cores 75 c¢m long and 67
cm in diameter and reflectors with
outer diameters of 100 cm. The flat-
flux reactor had 300 kg of stainless
steel. The uniform fuel reactor
required, for the same power output,
1.54 as much stainless steel and 1.41
as much urantum,

STABILITY

Calculations of the equivalent bare
reactor have been expanded to include
the detailed flux shape in the reflected
reactor and a fairly detailed repre-
sentation of the space variations of
flow and heat transfer. First results

have been obtained and will be reported
as soon as they have been analyzed.

The general procedure is to con-
sider first small oscillations from
equilibrium. The periods of the
system are then obtained as the
eigenvalues of the problem. A vari-
ational principle is used to convert
the system of partial differential
equations to a matrix problem, which

build-up processes cccurring inside

certainties in the energy distribution

shield weights were made for the super-
critical water cycle for a range of

reactor core slzes, reactor-crew
separation distances, and reactor
powers., The basic shield used was

essentially that described in ANP-
53,(%) modified to include several
inches of 1ron near the core because
of the pressure shell and its heat
shielding. This iren layer was
considered useful shielding material,
since the fast-neutron flux for this
design was considerably smaller at the
pressure shell than the primary gamma
flux. (The thermal-neutron flux
reaching the i1ron was considered
stopped by a boron laver.} Then an

16. CIRCULATING-MODERATOR-COOLANT REACTOR: HKF

Atomic Energy Division, The H. XK. Ferguson Co., Inc.

A study of a subsonic anircraft
reactor using circulating sodium
hydroxide as both mederatoer and coolant
and a fixed fuel of UFJ3 dissolved 1in
alkalil and alkaline earth fluorides
has been completed by the Atomic Energy
Divisiocn of The H. K. Ferguson Ce,
under contract to OBNL. As a result
of this study it was concliunded thatr
the circulating-moderator-coeclant
reactor can provide ample power for a
subsonic airplane. Actually the
performance of the aircraft is inter-
mediate between the NaOH homogeneous
and the UBi circulating-fuel reactors
discussed in previous quarterly re-
ports. %37 Principal advantages of
the circulating moderator-ccclant
system over the other two include the
use of a moderator of known properties
and behavior and the fact that the
secondary coolant is not made radio-
active, which simplifies the shielding
problem. The main drawback, in addition
to the fact that a suitable container
for sodium hydroxide isnot yet assured,
is the multitude of metallic heat-
transfer tubes in the core through
which heat is transferred from fuel to
coolant, The present study was con-
fined to the reactor because it was

The reactor delivers 140,000 kw at
the design point of 35,000 ft and Mach
0.8, with a coclant outlet temperature
of 1380°F, inlet 1180°F. The maximum
heat flux i1s 530,000 Bru/frt?2-hr, At
sea level 1t provides 230,000 kw.
This 1ncrease 1s accomplished by in-
creasing the temperature rise through
the reactor (inlet 1007°F, outlet
1335°F) while increasing the heat flux
{maximum 870,000), and i1t permits
climb from sea level at 720 ft/min at
a speed of 250 knots.

REACTOR CHARACTERISTICS

The present reactor design has the
characteristics of all fixed-{fuel
reactors: (1) the heat must be trans-
ferred first through the fuel and then
through the canning material; (2) the
coolant flow must be distributed in
accordance with the flux distribution;
and (3) the core must contain a compli-
cated structure subject to thermal and
mechanical stress and to radiation
damage. This reactor utilizes the
type of ligquid fuel planned for use in
the proposed ARE reactor at ORNL, the
essential difference being the use of
hydroxide as the combined
coolant and moderator as compared with
the OBNIL use of a fixed moderator of

sodium

186

BeO and a coolant of sodium. Sodium
hydroxide was specified as the moderator
coolant in the HKF proposal because 1t
is considered to have the best combi-
nation ol properties for this use:
adequate slowing-down power; does not
freeze, decompose, or have a high vapor
pressure 1n the operating temperature
range; and 1ts neutron absorption 1s
not excessive for this type of reactor.

An advantage of this design over
the homogeneous sodium hydroxide
reactor and the circulating-fuel
reactor 1s that the fuel does not
circulate ogutside the reactor during
operation. This tends to decrease the
reactor shield weight, and, more
1lmportant, avoids irradiation of the
heat exchanger and outside coolant
fluid with delayved neutrons. It also
eliminates loss of delayed neutrons
The large number of

noncirculating-fuel aircraft reactors,

CORE DESIGN

The reactor core is a square cylinder
32 in, 1in diameter. The sodium hy-
droxide moderator cooclant flows down-
ward through small, closely spaced
inconel tubes, Fuel occupies the
space between the tubes. A jacket of
sodium hydroxide around the core acts

 
 

FOR

as a reflector as does the sodium
hydroxide in the top and bottom headers.
l.Lead provides a gamma shield to pro-
tect the pressure shell against over-
heating. The sodium hydroxide flows
inside the tubes, thereby ensuring
against hot spots which could be
caused by interruptions in flow, which
would occur if the flow were outside
the tubes.’ This positive flow path
is believed necessary, as sodium
hydroxide has poorer heat-transfer
properties than sodium, for example.

The fuel was designed to be drain-
able, in order to decrease greatly the
uranium inventory for a group of planes.
This advantage, however, brings with
it a serious leakage problem, Since
the fuel 1s in a common container, it
could all escape through a large leak.
The effect of small leaks i1s minimized
by balancing pressures so that coolant

leaks into the fuel, rather than the
reverse.

CIRCULATING-MODERATOR-COOLANT REACTOR:

ORNL

R. W. Schroeder

H. R. Wesson
ANP Division

A preliminary design of a hydroxide
cooled and moderated reactor has been
defined. A 2.5-ft spherical reactor
should be able to deliver 200 megawatts
with a maximum wall temperature of
1500°F and a maximum coolant outlet
temperature of 1450°F, Only 115
megawatts 1s believed adequate for
flight at Mach 0.75 at 35,000 ft. An
essential feature of the design 1s the
use of annular fuel elements to attain
a high ratio of heat-transfer surface
to fuel volume., These design studies
were based on the use of sodium hy-
droxide, as 1ts properties are better
known than those of the other possible
hydroxides.

FLUID-CIRCUIT SPECIFICATIONS

After exploratory investigations, it
was decided to attempt to design a 200-
megawatt reactor with a 2.5-ft spherical
core, with a maximum wall temperature
in contact with the coolant of 1500°F,
and with coolant inlet and outlet
temperatures of 1100 and 1450°F,
respectively., These temperatures
imply a permissible coolant film drop
of 400°F at the inlet end, and 50°F at
the outlet end. The thermal con-
ductivity of sodium hydroxide 1is poor
relative to the thermal conductivities
of liguid metals, causing heat-transfer
coefficients and film temperature drops
to suffer. Attainment of the 50°F
film drop at the outlet end therefore
indicated special treatment to be
necessary. With all other variables
fixed, film drop varies directly with

188

unit power and inversely with V928
where V 1s fluid velocity. Therefore
the design should be such as to permit
the coolant to exit from a region of
minimum power, and such as to permit
high coolant velocities at the dis-
charge end of the flow path. Con-
versely, lower velocities can be
employed at stations farther removed
from the discharge end,
mizing pressure drop.

thereby mini-

FUEL-ELEMENT DESIGN

Fuel-element studies indicated the
ratio of heat-transfer surface required
to fuel volume required to be high,
approximately 1000 ft? surface to
0.33 ft*® volume. (The fuel volume is
based on the use of fused fluorides
with a uranium density of 150 1b/ft3,
and an estimated critical mass of
50 1b.) The use of cylindrical fuel
elements with fuel filling the elements
would have involved a prohibitive
number of very small tubes. The use
of annular fuel elements, with fuel
in the annulus and coolant moderator
flowing inside and outside the element,
permitted acceptable fuel temperature
gradients, and a mechanical design of
enhanced simplicity and ruggedness.

Aerodynamic studies here indicate
that L/D ratios of the order of 4.0 to
5.0 represent a maximum attainable
range for large supersonic aircraft
at Mach 1.5 and 45,000 ft. Values at
the higher end of the range can be
achieved only with an exceptionally
clean airframe and high-impulse
engines., (This 1s in sharp contrast
to L/D values of the order of 5.7 to
6.5 quoted generally in the literature
for systemswithrelatively low-impulse
engines.) A consequence of reduced
aerodynamic performance i1s i1ncreased

HIGH- TEMPERATURE POWER PLANT STUDIES

Inc.

North American has investigated
compressor Jets as a means for the
attainment of the necessary high
temperatures. In the binary com-
pressor-jet cycles, the working medium
in contact with the high-temperature
components need not necessarily be an
oxidizing fluid. If the operating
temperature of the radiator is main-
tained below 1800°F, the problems of
obtaining suitable high-temperature
materials may be significantly reduced,
since all high-temperature components
are not subject to oxidation.

On the basis of experiments con-
ducted at North American and elsewhere,
there appear toexist materials capable
of withstanding high temperatures
(up to 3500°F) in nonoxidizing atmos-
pheres. DBefore these materials can be
considered seriously for engineering
application, a major developmental
effort 1s required to establish tech-
niques by which they can be fabricated
into useful components. Furthermore,
much has to be learned about the cor-
rosion resistance of these materials
to the various coolants and the work-
ing medium proposed. Some pre-
liminary experimental work along these
lines has been undertaken at this
laboratory. To date, results are
encouraging but not yet conclusive.
For example, static corrosion rates of
3250°F sodium vapor on molybdenum are
apparently well within the required
Iimits for the aircraft power plants.

FOR

North American has conducted an
analytical investigation of high-
temperature compressor jets to de-
termine the plausibility of such
systems and to provide a guide for any
future experimental work that might be
undertaken, The aim in this work has
not been to establish the feasibility
of systems that might be constructed
in the near future. The aim has been
rather to determine whether an extensive
matertals and component development
program for high-temperature com-
pressor-Jjet application would be
justified. |

An integrated reactor, power plant,
and airframe study has been conducted
for several proposed systems, carried
out 1n sufficient detail to determine
if a plausible supersonic airplane is
achievable., Some systems guickly
appeared severely limited in per-
formance and onlvy a small amount of
analytical detail was reguired. This
was true for the gas-cooled reactors.
The sodium liquid-vapor compressor jet
was developed in considerable detail
and appears to be one plausible
system, In all cases the analysis was
dependent on extrapolaticens of rela-
tively meager experimental data on
properties of materials and working
fluids. The numerical results that
have come out of these analyses are
not intended to be final and fixed
and should be considered in the light
of their intended exploratory purpose.

Several airframe configurations and

power plant is housed within the
fuselage, and side inlet scoops are
provided for air intake. A shielded

the ship some 50 ft forward of the

crew members and the necessary control
equipment. The power plant is aft of
the reactor; the fuselage diameter is
approximately 13 ft at this section.
The power plant consists of a sodium-
vapor generator heated by molten tin,
located immediately aft of the shielded
reactor. Sodium vapor passes to five
turbines mounted circumferentially
around and entirely within the fuselage.
Each turbine is directly coupled to a
303-1b/sec air compressor which drives
atr aft and across a common radiator,
the sodium condenser, which occupies
the entire fuselage diameter. Air
continues aft through a nozzle pro-
ducing the propulsive thrust; the
sodium condensate 1s pumped forward
to the vapor generator,

The task of developing such a power
plant as described above would require
a very extensive effort. However, 1f
the appraisal of supersonic aerodynamic
performance is correct, and 1f amanned,
supersonic nuclear vehicle 1s required,
a program of this sort should be under-
taken, The sodium cycle is suggested
as one possible approach, not neces-
sarily aunique one, which on the basis
of preliminary studies appears to have
no fundamental limitations that pre-
clude 1ts development,

supersonic propulsion of aircraft
cannot be justified. In no case does
it appear that a supersonic vehicle
can be achieved, even when considering
reactor temperatures as high as 3300°F
and helium pressures in the range of
1000 to 2000 psi. There are fundamental
limitations involved having to do with
the comparatively poor heat-transfer
characteristics of the gaseous coolants.

A basic requirement for a high-
performance aircraft is light, compact
heat-exchange equipment with minimum
auxlliary power requirement. Jt 1s
well known that at moderate pressures
and temperatures gaseous coolants are
several orders of magnitude poorer in
these regards than the liquid coolants.
Increasing gas pressure tends to reduce
this difference, as does 1ncreasing
temperature differentials between hot
and cold fluids. At high pressures
equipment becomes more compact and
pumping power 1is reduced, but little
or no weight saving 1s accomplished
since heavier walled equipment 1is
required to accommodate the increased
pressure. The requirement that temper-
ature differentials in heat-exchange
equipment be large forces the maximum
power plant temperatures to 2 high
level without any realizable thermo-
dynamic benefit, While temperatures
in this analysis as high as 3300°F
were considered, air specific impulses
remained relatively low (approximately
30 1b thrust/lb air/sec). In all
specific designs considered for the
helium system, no plausible supersonic
vehicle was found. Specific power
plant weights in excess of 2.6 1b of
power plant per pound thrust were
obtained in all instances. Even

ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY"

C. D. Susano, Analytical Chemistry Division

Satisfactory chemical methods have
been developed or suitably modified
for the determination of metallic cor-
rosion products -~ principally iron,
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and
platinum — in reactor fuels composed
of eutectic mixtures of fluoride
salts., Two colorimetric methods for
low concentrations of cobalt in fluoride
salt mixtures and alkali hydroxides
were found to be too i1nsensitive
(sensitivity, 100 ppm) for the purpose.
Work is continuing on this problem.

A crystalline material, which was
deposited in the lithxum at a hot-
cold junction in a coolant test systen
during an extended shutdown period, was
identi1fied by X-ray-daiffraction
and chemical analysis as a
mixture of slightly contaminated
lithium hydride and hydroxide. A
method for the determination of carbon
in lithium, both carbide and carbonate
carbon, has been developed.

analvysis

A review of the analytical work for
the various phases of the ANP Program
shows that approximately 50% of the
work is concerned with the analysis of
reactor fuels of the mixed fluoride
salt types, 30% with the analysis of
sodium and lithium, and the remainder
with miscellaneous samples quite
in nature. A total of 1781

The n-butyl bromide method, which
is now being used regularly for the
determination of oxygen in sodium, is
found to yield excellent results for
oxygen concentrations of 0.015% or
greater. Studies are being made of
refinements of this method so that it
may be applied with reasonable accuracy
at even lower concentrations. A search
is being made to find a liquid medium
suitable for use in melting sodium
samples from metal tube containers;
certain hydrocarbons which are under
test appear to be promising for this
application. Preliminary tests
directed toward the adaptaticn of
the method of Pepkowitz and Judd®?)
(for oxygen in sodium) to the determi-
nation of oxygen and nitrogen in
lithium do not appear promising.
However, an apparatus 1s under con-
struction for use in determining the
oxygen content of metallic lead.
The method to be used incorporates
modifications and refinements of the
technique used by Funston and Reed(??
for the determination of oxygen in
bismuth.

The oxygen content of inert gases
{(principally helium) is now being
determined by a colorimetric method
which gives excellent precision below
25 ppm; at higher concentrations of
oxygen the precision drops off sharply.
An alternate method will be tested as

In the course of the development of
methods for the determination of me-
tallic corrosion products in NaF-KF-UF,
and NaF—Ber—UF4 euntectic fuel mix-
tures, a considerable amount of infor-
mation has been accumulated as to the
solubilities of these mixtures 1n
various reagents. This information is
being compiled and will be 1issued as
a separate report.

Methods and techniques have been
developed for the determination
of metallic corrosion products -—
chiefly iron, nickel, chromium, and
molybdenum — 1in two reactor fuels,
the ternary eutectics NaF-KF-UF, and
NaF-BeF, -UF,. At present only the

the standpoint of corrosion studies.

Spectrographic Results. The eu-
tectic mixture was prepared for spec-
trographic analysis of corrosion
products as described in previous
reports. (**5) The agreement of spec-
trographic and chemical results was
satisfactory for iron, nickel, and
chromium. Molybdenum was not de-
termined spectrographically. Since
the spectrographic preparation is time-
consuming and the results essentially
substantiate the chemical results,
spectographic tests have been dis-
continued.

Development of Colorimetric Methods,
Two reagents for the determination of
traces of cobalt in fluoride eutectics
and fused alkali metal hydroxides,
tetraphenyl arsonium chloride and
sodium diethyl thiocarbamate, were
investigated. Neither showed sufficient
sensitivity under the conditions
imposed in this case, 1.e., the limited
amount of sample available and the
number of other determinations required
on the same sample. The lower limit of
sensitivity for these reagents 1is of
the order of 100 ppm. Other reagents,
nitroso R salt in particular, will be
tried, and the procedures examined for
possible means of inmcreasing sensi-
tivity.

The procedure for the colorimetric
determination of chromium has been
standardized to give 5% accuracy 1in
the range 100 to 20,000 ppm by adopting
the procedure of G. F, Smith(%) which
assures holding all the chromium in
the same valence state.

Excellent precision has been obtained
in determining molybdenum in quantities

D, L. Mananing and W. K. Miller

The need for s method for the
determination of small amounts of
oxygen in lead has led to the in-

vestigation of the method of Funston
and Reed.{(®} This method invelves the
measurement of the reducticn in volume
of hydrogen when heated in centact
with the sample; however, the total
volume of the apparatus is so large in
comparison with the swall change in
volume during the reaction that the
method is highly inaccurate. A new
apparatus is being designed to correct
this failing in which a small known
volume of hydrogen is introduced 1into
a combustion chamber and allowed to
burn with the oxygen from the lead,
When the reaction is complete, the
remainder of the hydrogen 1s swept out

URANIUM TREFLUOBIDE IN URANIUM
TETRAFLUORIDE

W, K. Miller and D. [, Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

Uranium trifluoride has recently
been prepared in anticipation of 1ts
use in esutectic fuel mixtures for
nuclear reactors. Since 1ts preparation
generally includes reduction of UF,,
analytical procedures used to determine
UF, purity must be able to separate
the two fluorides. Tt was hoped to
find an oxidizing agent which would
oxidize U(ITT) to U(IV) with no effect

on the tetravalent 1on already present.

 
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10,

Of those mild oxidizing agents which
were tried, including water, ammoniacal
silver nitrate, and ferric sulfate—
hydrofluoric acid, only water appeared
promising, although ammoniacal silver
nitrate is still under investigation.

The amount of UF, may also be
determined by measuring evolved hydrogen
by the reaction

+ 3UF, + 2H,

4UF, + 4HC] ——> uCl1, ,

The apparatus used for this is similar
to that for the Dumas nitrogen determi-
nation except that a reaction flask
fitted with a dropping funnel replaces
the Dumas combustion tube., The evolved
hydrogen is swept into the gas buret
by a stream of CO, Farly results are
not too consistent, but it is believed
that by reducing the volume of the
apparatus better precision can be
attained. | '

The most promising method so far
considered 'is based on the total
reducing power of the sample. An
excess of standard ceric sulfate 1s
added to a mixture of the sample and
aluminum sul fate, and the excess is
titrated with standard ferrous ammonium
sulfate, Results obtained from this
method are compared with those from
the hydrogen evolution method on a
single sample in Table 19.1.

Clusters of pink transparent crystals
