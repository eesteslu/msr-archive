REACTOR POWER MEASUREMENT AND HEAT TRANSFER PERFORMANCE
IN THE MOLTEN SAIT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

C. H. Gabbard

- ABSTRACT

‘The operating power of the MSKE was routinely determined by a heat
balance on the fuel and coolant salt systems performed by the on-line com=
puter. This gave a calculated full-power level of 8.0 MW. However, changes
in the isotopic composition-of uranium and plutonium in the fuel salt indi-

~ cated a power lower than the 8 MW by about 7 - 10%. Attempts to resolve

this discrepancy included a measurement of the coolant salt flow rate by

" the radioactive decay of activation products in the coolant salt, a recal-

culation of the coolant system Pressure drop, and a heat balance on the air

'side of the coolant radiator. These efforts to date have been inconclusive,
‘but the coolant salt flow rate was found to be the only potential source

of significant error in the heat balance. A calibration check of the

‘differential pressure cells reading the coolant flow venturi will be made
. during the scheduled post-operation examinations. ;s

" The heat-removal capabilities of the fuel salt to coolant salt heat

y ekchanger and coolant salt to air radiator were below the predictions of

the original design calculations and limited the full-power output of the
MSRE., In the case of the primary heat exchanger, the overestimate was
due to the use of erroneous, estimated physical property data, the thermal

’ conductivities in particular, for the fuel and coolant salts. When ac-
curate, measured values of physical properties were used with the heat

transfer relationships for conventional fluids, the calculated performance
of the primary heat exchanger agreed with the observed value. In the case
of the radiator, the overestimate in the design was only partially ex-
plalned by the ﬁmproper selection of an air "film" temperature. '

 INTRODUCTION

Operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) from 1966
through 1969 provided a unique opportunity to measure heat transfer in
equipment using molten fluoride salts in the temperature range of 100014
1200°F over an extended period of time, Analysis of these data has led
to conclusions regarding the adequacy of conventional design. procedures

and the change (or lack thereof) in heat transfer resistances in this

Eg molten-salt system over more than 3 years of operation., This report.

describes the problems associated with measuring the power of the MSRE
'gthen deals with predicted and observed heat transfer coefficients. Qtn;

| The MSRE design and operation are described in detail 1n References 1
 and 2. Figure 1 shows the layout of the important components. Fuel salt
was - circulated at about 1200 gpm through the core, where 1t was heated by
the fission chain reaction, then through a 279~ ft2, cross-baffled shell- '
and-tube heat exchanger where it transferred heat to & second salt flowing
through 1/2-inch tubes. Heat was removed from the coolent salt and dissi-

pated to the atmosphere in an air-cooled heat exchanger ("coolant radlator")

~ with 3/h—inch tubes .
MEASUREMENT OF REACTOR POWER

The official operating power of the MSKE was determined by meking a
heat balance around the fuel and coolant systems. This heat balance,‘
which vas routinely calculated by the on-line computer, is more fully
described in References 3 and 4, The various nuclear power instrumen-
tation systems {1linear chambers,-fission chambers,'and safety chambers)
vere calibrated to agree with the nuclear power &s indlcated by the heat_
balance. . '

The heat balances calculated through March 1968 indicated 8 nominal
full-power level of gbout 7.2 MW. There was some reason to suspect this
value,,however, because data from reactor operation at different power
levels strongly suggested that the coolant salt specific heat was a con-
stantrrather than the temperature-dependent relastion that was?being usedh

in the heat balance.5 Two leboratories (ORNL and the National Bureau of
'Standards) independently measured the coolant salt specific heat, arriving
at values in good agreement with each other but substantially higher (in
the MSRE temperature range) than the previously used value.® The new .
measurements also showed virtually no variation with temperature.  The
new, constant value of the specific heat was incorporated into the computer
Prior to the beginning of operation on U-233 fuel in January 1969 The
calculated full-power level was changed from 7.2 to 8.0 MW as a result of
the specific heat revision._', ' |

As results of precision isotopic analyses of the heavy elements in
the fuel salt became available, independent determinations of reactor
power were obtained from the'changes in uranium and plutonium isotopic
‘jcompositions. The most recent evaluations of these isotopic data yielded
A full-power level of T7.34 + 0.09 MW (References 7 and 8). The heat
balance calculation has been reviewed as described below in attempts to
resolve the discrepancy between the measured heat balance power'and the

pover indicated by the changes in isotopic composition of the fuel salt.
Normal Heat Balance Calculation

At significant power levels, the dominant term in the heat balance

was the heat removed from thecoolant salt at the radistor. From Table I,
which shows the relative importance of the various terms in the heat_r
balance for operation at full power, it is clear that there was little
opportunity for significant overall error due to the other terms; '

| The heat removed at the radiator was calculated from the mass flow
rate, the speciflc heat of the coolant salt, and the temperature drop
across the radiator Possible sources of error in each of these were
examined | :

_ The salt temperature drop across the radiator was measured at thermo-
couple wells at the inlet and outlet. Three calibrated-thermocouples

were installed in each well with two from each well being used in the heat
balance. Although the laboratory calibrations of the' thermocouples indj-
cated a AT error of about -O,3°F,.there was concern that larger systematic

errors might exist in the,installed;condition. To test this possibility,
in November, 1969 the reactor system was operated isothermally at 1210°F,

. 1070°F, and 1010°F to. determine the error that would actually occur in
.'ioperation over the . temperature range of the coolant system., The indi-
,tcated AT error for the coolant system at full power was +0. 23 B which

'would cause a 0.h4 overestimate in the calculated power.. A second test
%o determine the 1nfluence of the radiator air flow on the thermocouple

”’reedings showed no detectable effect

" The coolant salt den51ty is believed to contribute a ;'l%'nncertainty

'1to the heat removal term, and the revised specific’ heat measurement had
a stated uncertainty of +1, h% -

The only remalnlng potentlal source of a significant error-is in the

tmeasurement of the coolant salt volumetric flow rate.  The volume flow

~ rate of the coolant salt -was measured at the radiator inlet by a venturi
 

 

flow meter with two channels of readout Each readout channel consists
of a differential pressure cell and the associated electronics to supply
& linear flow signal to the computer.. The differential pressure cells are
connected to the venturi pressnre taps and are isolated from the high-
| temperature salt by'metal'diaphragm segls and NaKEfilled lines. A review
~of the ventnri manufacturer's calibration data disclosed an error in con-
verting»the differential head from water to mercury which,had)causedta
-2.9%_reduction in the measured flow rate® and in the radiator heat-removal
term. Another possibility for error, which still exists, is in the cali-
bration of the differential pressure cells. The flowmeter readings were
checked for evidence of trapped gas or compressibility in the NaK?filled
lines byfobserving the flow readings as the coolant system,overpressure
was increased from 5 to 65 psi during a coolant-system-pressure test.
There were essentially no indicated flow changes on either;channel during
this test. The actual range calibration of the differential pressure
cells cannot be checked until later this year when the coolant piping
will be cut so that known pressure signals can be applied to the cells
Two independent attempts to determine the coolant salt flow rate are
described below. However, the results of these two efforts vere incon-
clusive and the final assessment of the flow rate will belmadedfrom the
calibration check of the differential pressure cells. | |
Taking the nominal full power of 8.0 MW and spplying the 2.9% flow
- error and the 0.4% AT error, the heat balance would indicate a power level
- of 8.2 + 0.16 MW as compared to 7.34 * .09 MW indicated by the isotopilc
analysis of the fuel. If all of thiS’discrepancylwere'asaigned»to the
coolant salt flow rate in the heat balance, the flow rate would have to
be lowered from the nominal value of 850 gpm to 770 gpm [

Coolant Salt FlOW'Measurement by Decay of Circulating Activation Products

o Because the accuracy of the differential pressure cells reading the
coolant salt flow venturi could not be checked until some months.after .
 the end of reactor operation, an attempt was made during the laatpower
nm in December 1969 to measure the coolant salt flow rate by the decay of
activation products in the salt. Nitrogen-l6 and-fluorine-20vwere produced

in the coolant salt by neutron reactions with fluorine in the heat ex-
changer, These activities then decayed with half-lives of T.4 sec and
11.2 sec respectively as the salt was pumped around the coolant loop.

 We were also hopeful of finding long-lived activities from impurities in

the salt that would have been useful in making a geometry calibration of
the equipment. A high resolution gemma spectrometer with a 4096-channel
analyzer was available for detecting and -counting the various energy peaks
that might be present. | |

Two holes were drilled in the high-bay floor to the coolant cell so
that the coolant salt piping could be scanned at two locations while the
reactor was‘operating-at full power, These two locations were separated
by & total circulating salt volume of 20.9 £t3 which included the radiator,
the coolant pump, and the EOS;line. This volume would give decay times
of 1 and 1.5 half-lives respectively for the ®°F and 16N at the design
flow rate, Correction factors were estimated to account for the effects
of mixing by the side stream through the relatively stagnant coolant pump
tank and for the effects of the line-205 flow that bypassed the radiator
volume. The effects of possible flow variations through different sections
of the radiator tube bundle were found to be negligible.,,

Preliminary data showed that the background count was obscuring the
count from the coolant plplng Lead bricks were stacked around the de-
tector to reduce the background count and the diameter of the collimator
used to aim the detector was increased from l/8-in to 1/2-in. to increase
the count rate from the coolant line The background remained high com-

pared to the count rate from the coolant cell, but the ability to resolve

| 'the count rate into discrete energy peaks and the limited time avallable

for the experiment led us +o begin the. actual data collection. Although

,“ the background count was higher than desired for the experiment ‘the radi-
ation wa.s - below 2 mR/hr and was not a biOlOgical hazard. o

Data were collected on magnetic tape for a total active counting -

_i_time of. about 11 hours at each of the locations on the ‘coolant piping.
. Two sets ofrdata,were-takenaat_the_second-location with_about six inches

of lead shielding between the detector and the hole to the coolant cell.
 

 

The first count measured the background count in the high bay, and the
second count was taken with a small S6Co source to calibrate the gamma
. energy to the channel number of the analyzer. N o |

The data were analyzed by a computer program which gave the integral
count rate for each energy-peak in the spectrum; 'The baCRgroﬁnd count
appropriate for each Particular peak was. automatically subtracted by the
- .computer program. A comparison of the two gamma spectra with and without
the lead shielding between the detector and coolant piping indicated that
'only-the-l.63FMev energy peak from 2°F_woold'be useful in calculating the
coolant flow rate. None of the other peaks, including two that corre-
sponded -to the 6.13 and T.12-Mev gammas from 1°N, were attenuated by the
- 8ix inches of lead shielding. These energy peaks that were not attenu-
 ated were believed to be capture gammas‘from_the'reaotor‘cell'shielding.

. The detector was located near the ends of the top shield'blocks'at the
southwest corner of the high bay and there was a field of gamma photons
~and fast neutrons from beneath the top shield blocks. -

The coolant salt flow rate as calculated from the decay of the
1.63-Mev photons from 2°F was 610 gpm as compared to 850 gpm indicated
by the flow venturi. Although'the 610 gmm is probably 20 to 30% below
the actual flow and the measurement was not useful for its intended pur-
pose of resolving the power discrepancy, this method of7measuring the
flow rate appears to be feasible if the proper ﬁrecautions are'taken in
setting up the experiment., The largest source of'érrOr,in7the-experiment
was probably in the geometry differences between the two scanning points.
This type error could possibly be eliminated by a more careful design of
the counting stations to ensure low background and similar countingige—
ometries, or by spiking the cOolanf sélt'ﬁith a 1onger?lived-activityi*
that would be essentially uniform throughout the coolant loop. This
activity could then be used to;provide a geometry calibration factor be-
:tween the two counting'stations. Other important sources of error could
be in the effective salt volume between the two stations or in the effects
of the high background. The reactor was shut down -a short time after the
data wer; taken and there was no opportunity to refine the experiment.

Coolant System Pressure Drop

The coolant salt flow rate of 850 gpm measured by the flow venturi

was within the range originally predicted from the calculated coolant

system pressure drop and the performance characteristics of the coolant
pump. A range of 850 to 940 gpm had been originally predicted by allowing
+ 10% variation on the calculated pressure drop and a *+ 5% flow vari-
ation on the coolant pump}: A flow rate 10% below the design range would
require a large.error'in the’head'loss’calculation Oor an unreasonsbly poor
pump efficiency. - '_ |
There is no convenient way to check the performance curve of the
installed coolant‘pump, but the system head loss was recently recalculated
by the writer at the design flow rate of 850 gpm. Table II gives the
revised head losses of the various components of the coolant system.
Allowing for a + 15% uncertainty in salt viscosity, the calculated coolant
system head loss ranged from 9h to 99 feet of ‘salt as compared to the
original design value of 78 ft Actually, a somewhat greater uncertainty
band is probably required to account for the selection of friction factors

and coefficients for entry and exit losses. The head loss of 99 ft would

give a predicted minimum flow of about 800 gpm based on the coolant pump

wvater test data and allowing for & 5% lower flow in the MSRE than in the

water test pump. However, -this cannot be taken as a precise flow calcu-

‘lation because there are a large number of assumptions in the pressure

drop calculation. and because the actual coolant pump characteristic curve

'might not be within the 5% margin. The minimum predlcted flow rate of
- 800 gpm is still above the TTO gpm required to resolve the discrepancy

‘in reactor power.

Air Heat Balance Calculastion

The radiator air system provided an opportunity to make an inde-
rendent measurement of the operating power of the reactor. .Héat baiances
- on the air system were completed in May 1966 and these were in general
agreement with the salt heat balances using the revised value of the
coolant salt specific heat. The stack,airuoutlet.temperature*for these
heat balances was measured at a,single point near the stack wall and the
air flow measurement was based on the reading of a'pitot-#enturi'flowmeter '
at the center of the stack. The relation between the flowmeter reading |
and the total stack flow had been previously determined at several flow
rates frbm velocity profiles takén'with a hot wire anemometer. These
velocity profiles were taken at ambient air temperature. This measure-
ment related the total stack air flow directly torthe computer readout of
the flowmeter output and did not involve the.manufactuferfé butput Vs
velocity calibration data.
 

11

The only point at which air velocities could be measured was at a
1ocation about 50 feet up the TS-ft“high 10-ft-diameter air stack., This
location would give upstream and downstream L/D ratios of 5 and 2.5
respectlvely. Both upstream and downstream distances are insufficient to
ensure a normal flow distribution, and flow disturbances could be intro-
duced by either the sharp 90° corner at the bottom of the stack or by
wlnd effects at the top of the stack. R

Since the air stack could also have a temperature distribution as
well as a velocity distrlbutlon and since the velocity distribution might
change under actual oﬁerating conditions, two air heat balances were
completed in the fall of 1969. For these heat balances, the mounting of
thewpitot-venturi-was-modified!and-a thermocouple was added so that
welocity and temperature;traverses could be taken onitwo perpendicular
diameters across the stack while the réactor was operating at power., A
new velocity calibration°was:alsotcompleted'on.the pitot-venturi prior
to using it in running the ‘traverses,

obtained for the partial power operation. The large variations in these
velocity distributions are an indication of the difficulty in obtaining
an accurate flow measurement. _ B

- At the present time, the accuracy of the salt heat balance must be
given precedence over the air heat balance for the following reasons.

1. The two air heat balances taken at different power levels were
inconsistent with each other as indicated-by the ratios of air
heat balance power to salt heat balance power shown in Table IIT.
The salt heat balance power at various power levels was in
agreement"withatheneutron flux power indication from the com-
pensated ion-chamber and mas therefore proportional to the |
actual power. '

2. The difficulty in obtaining the true air flow and temperature
rise with the large varlations as shown in Figure 3.

3. Unaccounted heat losses and air leakages from the radiator
enclosure.

The construction and instrumentation of the radiator air system were not

intended for precisionrmeasurements'as-required for a heat balance and

therefore the difficulties encountered were not surprising.
PERFORMANCE OF THE MATN HEAT EXCHANGER  AND RADIATOR

The 1nitial escalatlon of the ‘MSRE power level in Aprll and May of

1966 showed that the heat transfer capabllity vas below ‘the de31gn pre=-

diction for both the primary heat exchanger and the radiator. ‘With the

reactor system operating W1thin its design temperature range, the maximum

'i:power 1evel of the reactor as calculated by the computer heat balance was
':limlted by these components to about 7 2 MW as compared to ‘the nominal
fffull-power rating of 10 MW Slightly higher power could have been achieved

'p'by ralsing the fuel temperature, but the large temperature increase re-

'f}fquired to obtaln only a small power ‘increase made this lmpractical

 The original designs of both the heat exchanger and the radiator

'were rev1ewed to determlne the cause of the lower than expected per-'

- formance. The actual operating performance was also carefully monitored
 

 

16

to determine if the reduced performance was caused-by some factor associ-
- ated with the operation. A more complete discussion of the initial evalu-
ation of this problem is given in Reference 10.
Design Review
Primary Heat Exchanger | 7
The primary heat exchanger is a conventional cross-baffled, U-Tube

exchanger as shown in Fig. 4. Fuel salt circulates on the shell side at ;
1200 gpm and coolant salt circulates at about 850 gpm through the tubes.
The exchanger now contains 159 half-inch tubes on a triangular pitch.
For a more detailed description, see Reference 1. |

- The methods used in the design of the MSRE heat exchanger are those
commonly followed in designing heat exchangers of this type. The tube-

side coefficient was computed from the Sieder-Tate equation, and the

shell-side coefficient was computed from a correlation by Kern.,ll Im-

plicit in the use of these procedures is the aSsumption that the fused
salts behave as normal fluids, Previous heat transfer work on fused salts .
had shown this to be a valid assumption for both flow inside tubes and
on the outside of tube bundles.Z 13 _ |
The design calculations tend to give a conservatively low prediction
of the heat-transfer capability (effective UA) for four reasons. First,
the correlation for shell-side coefficient by Kern is conservative, i.e.,
his design curve falls below the data points rather than through the mean,
This would tend to make the predicted shell-side coefficient low by O -
20%- Since the shell-side resistance is about a third of the total, the
~ effect of this conservatism on the predicted overall coefficient, U, is
about O - 64. Second, the predicted coefficient would also be low because
an additional resistance of about 11% was added arbitrarily to allow for
scale. This was done even though it has been shown, both iﬁ_and out of o
pile, that the salts do not corrode or deposit scale on Hastelloy-N under

MSRE operating conditions. The third conservative approximation was in

the definition of the effective heat-transfer surface area. Here no -
credit was taken for the bent part of the tubes, i.e,, the active length .\i;

of the tube was taken to be the straight'portion between the thermal
barrier near the tube sheet and the last baffle. This approximation was
made in recognition that the thermal efficiency of the return bends might
be less than that of the straight portions. Nevertheless, this region
contains 7 to 8 percent of the total tube area and will transfer a signifi-
cant amount of heat. Finally an additional 8% of active heat- transfer
‘area was added to the computed requirement as a contingency factor.- The
net result is that a deliberate margin for error of over 20% was 1ncluded
I1n the heat exchanger design.

Between the design and the operation of the heat exchanger some
| modifications were made.' When the heat exchanger was hydraulically tested
withrwateribefore being instailed in the reactor, the shell-side pressure
drop was excessive and the tubes vibrated. To reduce the high pressure
| drop;‘the~outermOSt row of four tubes was removed and the corresponding
holes in the baffle ‘plates were plugged. To alleviate the tube vibration
‘problem, an inpingement baffle was placed at the fuel salt inlet. In
addition the tubes were "1aced" with rods next to each baffle plate to
restrain the lateral movement.of the_tubes. A 1aced structure-was also
built up in the return bend to make these_tube.projections'behave as 8
unit, and the tubes essentiallyﬂsupport_eachother;sNo:attempt was made
to measure the overall heat-transfer coefficient,_hnt,it’does not appear
that these changes were enough to affect the conservatism.in'the original
design. The effect of the rods and impingementrbaffle was probably negli-
gible. The loss in heat transfer by the removal of the four tubes was also
relatively small. The heat-transfer area of the'remOVed tubes was only
about 2.5% of the total; the effect on capacity was probably less because
these particular tubes, by virtue of their proximity to the shell, would
be expected to have heat-transfer coefficients below the average. a

At the time the design review was completed in the'summer of 1966,
we concluded'that the design methods were appropriate the assumptions
conservative, and that subsequent modifications should not have used up

the margin of safety believed to be provided in the design.

-~_1The three remaining possible causes of the low heat transfer were:
1. . That a buildup. of scale was occurring on the tubes even though
| , this was believed impossible. _
- 2. That the-tube-surfaces were being blanketed with a gas film.
3. - -The physical properties of the fuel and coolant salts used in

the design were ‘not the correct values.

,Subsequent operation of the ‘reactor, as discussed later in the report,
. showed that the heat. transfer was constant with time, indicating no buildup

of scale and that there,was-no,evidence»of gas filming, However, a re-
evaluation of the physical properties showed that the thermal conductivity
of:both the fuelfand‘QOOlant salt5was-sufficiently below the value used in
the design to account for the overestimate of the overall coefficient..

~Table IV on page723;of’this‘report shows a comparison of the original
- physical property data to the latest values and.shows the effect on the

‘calculated heat transfer coefficients.

Coolant RadiatOr'

- The heat transfer surfaces of the radiator consist of 120 unfinned
3/h-inch tubes, each about 30 ft long.r The S-shaped tube bundle, con-
sisting of lO staggered banks of 12 tubes each, 1is located in a horizontal

'; air duct 50 that air blows across the tubes at right angles Doors can

be lowered just upstream and downstream of the tubes to vary the air flow
over them A bypass duct with a controlled damper and the option of using

either one or two blowers provide other means of varying the air pressure

'drop across the radiator A detailed description of the . radlator and 1ts

';enclosure is given in Reference 1.

- As in the des1gn of the primary heat exchanger the Sieder-Tate

~equation was ‘used to calculate the ‘heat- transfer coefficient on the inside |

of_the,tubes. The same comments as. to: validity of method and accuracy of

salt properties apply 4in both designs. ‘In the radiator, however, only 2%

_;of the calculated: heat-transfer resistance was inside the tubes, 80 no
.conclusions with regard to accuracy of :the inside film calculations can

- be . drawn from the -observed performance.
 

 

20

- Over 95% of the resistance is on the air side. This coefficient was

~calculated using an equation by Colburnfrecommended9by McAdams .14 This
equation is well-prdven for cross-flow geometries identical in all es-
sentiale to the MSRE radiator. The difficulty with applying. the equation
to the MSKRE design is the very large difference between'the'tube.tempera-
ture and the bulk temperature of the air.  The phySical-propérties of the
air vary so much over this range that relatively large variations in the
heat-transfer coefficient can be calculated depending on which temperature
is selected for the evaluation of the physical properties. The MSRE de-
"'Jsign,calculaticn‘used air -properties at,the.temperaturejofithe outside
" surface of the tubes. The procedure recommended by McAdams is to evaluate
the properties at a "Pilm temperature” defined as the average of the sur-
face and the bulk air temperatures. Had this been done, the outside film
coefficient .(and.the overall coefficient) calculated for the MSRE radiator
would have been lowered from 60 to 51.5 Btu/(hr-ft=-°F), Even-icwer'values
would have resulted if the physical properties had been_evaluated_nearer
the temperature of the bulk of the air. S

 The heat-transfer coefficient calculated using the recommended air
£ilm temperature was still greater than the observed value by about 20%
A contingency factor of this magnitude would not be unreasonable when the
large air-to-tube surface temperature difference is coneidered and when the

':unconventional geometry of the tube bundle within its enclosure is con-

" sidered. However, the original radiator design had included only a h%

'overdesign.

Analysis of Performance

Zrimary Heat Exchanger
The heat transfer performance of the main heat exchanger has been.
monitored throughout the power operation of the MSRE by two methods. The
overall heat transfer coefficient was evaluated by-a'procedure-described
in References 10 and 15 which was developed to eliminate the effects of |
certain types of thermocouple errors. The overall coefficient was calcu-
lated frdm the equations: | |

‘When the MSRE was. flrst operated at significant power levels, the

- Reference 10 presents a complete discussion of this problem and the pos-

been properly designed using the salt physical property data available

- at that time but that some of the physical properties, the thermal con-

‘ductivities in particular, were substantially below the values used in

the design. Table IV shows a comparison of the physical property data
used in the original design: to the current data. The heat transfer coef-
ficients calculated by the conventional design procedures using these two

. The measured overall heat transfer coefficients have ranged from 646
to 675 with an average of 656 Btu/(hr-ft2-°F) for 8 measurements. These
measurements were made on the basis of nominal full power at.8.0 MW and
a coolant salt flow of 850 gpm. If the actual flow rate were 770 gpm,
which would be the flow consistent with a power level of 7 3h MW, the
measured overall coefficient would be 594 as compared to a calculated
value of 599 Btu/(hr-£t3-°F). These measured coefficients were based on
- & total effective surface.arearof 279'ft2; This area includes the U-bends
but excludes the area between the tubesheet and its thermal barrier. The
original design calculations excluded the area in the bends to provide
an additional margin of safety. The above data show that the conventional
heat transfer correlations are applicable to molten-salt heat eXchangers
and that the-erroneous Physical property data used in the original design
'was'thezonly cause for thegoverestimate'of the heat transfer capability.
In all other respects, the heat exchanger.performance has been fault-
less. There has been no indication of leakage either to the outside or
between the fuel and coolant salts, no indication of tube vibrations after

the modifications mentioned earlier, and no indications of flow restrictions.
Coolant Radiator

Although the radiator was monitored continuously during power opera~-
tion of the reactor for changes in performance, “the only measurements of
the heat transfer coefficients were made in 1966. The design,and.instru-
mentation of the radiastor and its enclosure were not intended to provide
data for an accurate determination of the radiator heat transfer coef-
ficient. However, these coefficients could be estimated fromrthe available
data at'any time the radiator doors were fully open. The overall coef—

ficients were calculated using the standard heat transfer equation

The difficulty in applying this equation was in the measurement of the

outlet air temperature. A direct measurement at the top of the air stack

could be made only when the bypass damper was completely closed and then

a correction was required to account for the air flow from the annulus

blowers. For other conditions, the ocutlet air temperature was calculated

from a salt and air heat balance across the radiator. The air flow and
temperature measurements were made with the original instrumentation and
stack flow calibration discussed in the AiereatlBalancelsection of this
report' ‘No attempt has been made to reevaluate”the radietor heat trans-
fer based on the recent flow or temperature traverses because of the dis-
crepancies that still ex1st in these measurements. '

The radiator overall heat transfer coefficients vs air pressure drop
assuming a nominal full*power of 8.0 MW are shown in Fig. 6. The dis-

continuity when the second'hlower_was energiied was originally believed

to be the result of direct air impingement from the second blower. How-

ever, this could be a result of flow or temperature errors and the calcu-
lational procedures. The observed overall coefficient evaluated at full

pover was L2.7 Btu/(hr- -5 °F) ais compared to the corrected design value

- 51.5 Btu/(hr- £t2-°F),

In all other respects;fthe performance of the radiator was completely
Satisfactory., The heat transferuremained constant through the life of the
reactor sndfthere'ﬁere'no.salt7lesks or other difficulties with the radi-
ator itself. There were some early difficulties with ‘the radiator en-

closure whlch are discussed 1n another report 16 These difficulties were

 eliminated by modiflcations to the enclosure and doors.

'CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

_ The MSKE heat'exchanger'and-radiatorﬁperformed completely satis-

,factorily except that the heat removal capability uas less than intended,

In regard to the overall operation of the MBRE the power limitation im-

) 1posed by the heat removal system was not a serious problem. All of the
~ goals of the MSRE were successfully achieved at the attainable power level,.

The analysis of the prlmary heat exchanger performance ‘showed that

.the conventional heat transfer correlations are applicable to molten salts:
- the initial overestimate of “the heat exchanger performance was completely

‘resolved by the revised physical property data for the fuel and coolant

salts, Operation for more than 3 years showed no loss in hegt transfer

capacity with time as a result of corrosion, scale, flow bypassing, or

: flow restrlctlons

In the case of the radiator, a discrepancy still exists between the
calculated and observed performance. The cause for this discrepancy has
not been deflnltely established It would appear that (l) the air-side
heat transfer correlation was not completely suitable for the large-
surface-to-air temperature difference that existed in the radistor, or
(2):there were air flow leakages, bypassing, or air flow variations in
this particuler installation that caused the low heat tramsfer. Regard-
less of the reason for the overestimation of the radiator Performance, it
is clear that the L, contingency factor in the orlginalldesign was in-

- suffic1ent The unusually" low contingency factor for heat transfer equip-
ment occurred because the ba31c radiator design was completed early in the
| fMSRE design when the nominal design power was still 5 MW, The radiator

tr'and main heat exchanger were designed for 10 MW to ensure adequate per-
girformance When the nominal power rating of the MSRE was later raised to

- 10 MW .the. radiator had only" a h% overdesign. An obvious but often ig-

'nored design principle, would be to evaluate the performance over the
"maximum possible range of the physical property data and operational

o _variables and then use . the resultlng performance range as part of the basis

in selectlng a contlngency factor. A 1arger degree of overdesign would

have been indicated for.the-radiator if this procedure had been followed.
 

28

Thus far we have been unsble to explain the discrepahcy'between the
power indicated by the salt heat balance and that indicated by long-term
changes in the isotopicrcomposition of ‘the fuel salt. The air heat
balances indicated a lower power than the salt heat balance but the ac-
.curacy of these measurements is not sufficient to override the salt heat
balance. The coolant salt flowmeter is the only element that has not yet
been checked as thoroughly as possible. A lower cooleht ealt'flow'rate
was indicated by the decay of circulating activation products and also‘by
e_the'recalculatibn of the coolant system head loss. However, neither of

these methods is very accurate. The most relisble value of the flow rate

should be determined from the planned calibration of the flow element

dlfferential-pressure cells,
