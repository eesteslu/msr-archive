Herb McCoy first worked at ORNL as an
undergraduate coop student out of Vir-
ginia Polytech in 1953. In 1955 he married
Ann Thompson, a Laboratory Personnel
Division employee, and transferred to UT,
where he received his M.S. in metallurgy
in 1958, the year he joined the ORNL staff.
His work at the Laboratory has been with
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion, the Gas-
Cooled Reactor, and currently the Molten
Salt Reactor Experiment. McCoy heads up
a group that is engaged in fundamental
studies on the mechanical properties of
metals in the Metals & Ceramics Division.
The story he tells here of the development
of the particular alloy that would stand up
under the exacting demands peculiar to
the MSR is one of innovationand ingenuity.

The INOR-8 Story

By H. E. McCoy

HE PHYSICISTS’ NOTEBOOKS are filled with
| attractive reactors that probably will never be
built because of inherent materials problems. The
factors usually involved are excessively high op-
erating temperatures and corrosiveness of the fluids
involved. Other reactors have been constructed
without full consideration of the component materi-
als, and their operation has been plagued with prob-
lems. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at ORNL
might well have been one of these problem cases,
had not the talents of several individuals and the
facilities of the Laboratory and several commercial
metal producers been applied to developing a struc-
tural material for the metallic parts of the reactor.

This material had to be chemically compatible with
molten fluoride salts and capable of being fabricated
into complicated shapes such as characterize the
containment vessel, piping, and the heat exchangers.

Such a material was developed; it was -called
INOR-8 at the Laboratory, but commercially it is
known as Hastelloy N and Allvac N. This alloy
has performed admirably in the MSRE, but the
- prospects of molten salt power reactors with plant
lives of 30 years means that we must develop a
modification of this alloy that is more resistant to
embrittlement by long-term neutron irradiation.
Let us look briefly at the development of INOR-8
and then analyze the. progress toward developlng
an improved modification of this alloy for future
molten salt power reactors.

During the 1950’s when the Unlted States was
attempting to develop a.nuclear- powered aircraft,
one of the concepts cons1dered was a reactor fueled
with UF, contained in a mixture of other ﬂuorlde
salts. A relatlvely complicated reactor, called the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was constructed
and operated to demonstrate this concept. The fuel, a
mixture of NaF, ZrF,, and UF,, was pumped through

small Inconel 600 tubes at temperatures up to
1620°F. Inconel 600 is a nickel alloy containing
chromium and iron. The tubes were surrounded by
blocks of beryllium oxide that served as moderator
and reflector. The reactor achieved criticality in
November 1954 and operated 221 hours before
being dlsmantled for examination.

The ensuing perlod between the successful ~
operation of the ARE in 1954 and criticality of the
MSRE ‘in June 1965 saw a change from thinking
of molten salt reactors in terms of military applica-
tions to the concept of their use as civilian power
plants. The work on ‘molten salt chemistry and
materials development that took place during this
period resulted in a vastly simpler core design than
that of ARE.

Much of the comphcatlon of the ARE core came
from the fact that the Inconel 600 tubes were neces-
sary to separate the molten salt from the beryllium
oxide moderator-reflector, which was not compatible
with the salt. Graphite is also a good moderator,
and the discovery that graphite and salt are com-

patible allowed the core to become a block of graphite

with small holes for fuel passages. Assuming that

the graphite is available, the big materials ques-

tion becomes, What material can be used for the

containment vessel and the other metalhc parts of

Fluorine is very reactive with metals, so many
jump to the conclusion that the fluoride salts are
equally reactive. The free energy of formation is
commonly used to measure the stability of a com-
pound; a compound is stable if the free energy is
negative and the stability is greater the more neg-
ative the free energy. Table 1 shows the relative
stabilities of several fluorides of interest, including
the potential fuel salt constituents as well as the
structural metals under consideration.

Since the fuel compounds are more stable than the
structural materials, the salts and the metals should
be satisfied with their respective roles and the cor-
rosion rate should be low. However, the relative
ranking of the metals indicates that nickel and
molybdenum are least likely to form fluorides and
that chromium is most likely. Thus, a reasonable
container material for these salts would be a nickel
or molybdenum base alloy with minimum quantities
of chromium and iron. The question arises, Why
not use pure molybdenum or nickel? Pure molyb-
denum is difficult to fabricate and is quickly re-
legated to the role of alloying addition to nickel
to give strength. Pure nickel is quite weak at high
temperatures and acutely sensitive to impurities
such as sulphur and phosphorus and would not be
suitable for use in an engineering system. Both

FALL 1969

nickel and molybdenum oxidize rapidly at high
temperatures and would have to be protected from
exposure to air; alloying with chromium is normally
used to alleviate this problem in nickel base alloys.
We have already mentioned the Inconel 600 that
was used in the ARE. However, this alloy corroded
to depths of 10 mils in 1,000 hours when exposed

to circulating salt at a maximum temperature of

1500°F and would not be suitable for a long-term
application. The nature of the attack is shown in
Figure 1.

The list of available commercial alloys was
searched further. Two, Hastelloys B and W, satis-
fied the corrosion requirements, but “aged,” i.e.
became very brittle, after being heated for long
periods of time.

Development of INOR-8

This completed the screening tests on the avail-
able commercial alloys and all attention was turned
toward developing a new alloy in late 1956. The
application was still the ANP program where the
service temperature was 1500°F. The requirements
for this alloy were 1) good corrosion resistance to
fluoride salts, 2) good oxidation resistance, 3) moder-
ate strength and ductility at high temperatures,

4) stable properties at the service temperature, 5)
ability to be melted and fabricated into complex
shapes, and 6) ability to be joined by welding and
brazing. As you may have already gathered, such
a program involved several experimental disciplines.
We have already mentioned corrosion, mechanical
properties, fabrication, joining and physical metal-
lurgy. Fabrication in this case involved shaping 5-
ton ingots into useful items like plate, pipes, rods
and sheets, using such techniques as forging, rolling,
swaging, extrusion, and drawing. Physical metal-
lurgy is a term that covers about everything that
is not included in the other terms, but its principal
aspect here was a study of the stability of the vari-
ous alloys by aging at temperatures of 1200°F to
1500°F.

38

This program was directed by W. D. Manly of
Union Carbide; ORNL’s H. Inouye served as the
program’s technical conscience in addition to being
involved in much of the experimental work.

The facts accumulated at this point indicated that
the alloy base should be nickel, with molybdenum
(less than 20%) for strengthening, and some chro-
mium for oxidation resistance (less than the 15%
in Inconel 600). The melting practice used at that
time introduced small amounts of manganese, sili-
con, boron, oxygen, nitrogen, and some iron since
some of the chromium was charged as ferrochrome.
The metals used for melting stock also contain
small amounts of sulphur, phosphorus, carbon, and
myriad other impurities since scrap from previous
melts is quite often used. And so a commercial melt

OAk RipGeE NATIONAL LABORATORY Review
becomes a multicomponent system, and the so-called
scale-up from small laboratory to large commercial
melts is an important and unforeseeable experience.

The largest portion of the development program
spanned the years of 1956 to 1958. Small melts up
to 100 lb could be made at ORNL and larger ones
of 5,000 t0 10,000 Ib were made by Battelle Memorial
Institute, International Nickel Company, Westing-
house, and Haynes Stellite. The small ingots were
‘used as a screening step and larger melts were
made of only the compositions that appeared at-
tractive. (The screening step was taken because
these alloys cost about $6 per 1b.) The large batches
of metal, or “heats,” were fabricated by the vendors
with ORNL personnel on site in most cases. The
fabrication data derived from this were extremely
valuable to both parties involved, since this was an
unknown alloy, of which a 10,000-1b mass had to be
gotten to a useful shape. Fabrication was in the
form of tubing for corrosion studies, sheet for me-
chanical prp,perty measurements, and thick plate
for joining studies. The New England Testing Lab-
oratory near Boston assisted in the mechanical
property studies, and welding assistance was avail-
able from Rensselaer Polytech.

Hundreds of small melts were made by metallur-
gists at ORNL and large melts were made by the
vendors of the alloys shown in Table 2. All of these
alloys fabricated well except INOR-4. This alloy
contained 1.5% titanium and 2% aluminum. These
elements in this concentration form a very brittle

intermetallic compound with nickel called “gamma

prime.” It forms the basic hardener in a series of
nickel base alloys developed in recent years. Such
alloys require special fabrication procedures not
practicable for our purposes.

My casual mention that most of the alloys fabri-
cated well does not pay adequate tribute to the team
(Inouye, T. K. Roche, D. E. Rosson and G. Golston)
who worked many hours at ORNL and in the fab-
rication shops of the vendors. At this time most of
the tubing available was made by forming flat
strips into a cylindrical shape and welding the con-
tacting pieces together. This was called “welded

tubing” and had a terrible reputation for being

badly flawed. What we really wanted was a seam-
less tubing. The normal procedure for getting this
is to deform an ingot some by forging (hammering),
extrude this forged piece to obtain a tube shell (a
crude pipe with a thick wall), and draw, i.e., stretch,
this tube to obtain high quality, thinwalled tubing.
The extrusion step was the difficult part. Extrusion

FaLL 1969

involves simply pushing the metal through a die
to obtain a particular shape. This is what you do to
tooth paste, but metals take a good deal more push.
To minimize the energy required, the metal is usu-
ally heated nearly to melting point, transferred
quickly to the extrusion press, and shoved through
the die in a matter of a few seconds. This procedure,
however, consistently gave scrap instead of a tube
shell. One of the team, in a moment of inspiration,
reasoned that the energy of extrusion alone could
be enough to heat it up and might even exceed the
melting point. The solution? Slow down the rate of
extrusion. We ended up with good tube shells that
were later drawn into miles of tubing by Superior
Tubing Company. |
The corrosion experiments on these alloys showed
that the corrosion susceptibility increased in this
order: iron, niobium, uranium, chromium, tungsten,
and aluminum. It is very close to that predicted
by the relative stabilities of the fluorides, i.e., alumi-
num would like to be a fluoride more than any of
the elements listed and will be attached prefer-
entially by a fluoride salt. Tungsten is the only

“element that fell appreciably out of place. The cor-

rosion rates of alloys containing only nickel, molyb-
denum, iron and chromium were found to be quite
acceptable. Jack Devan and Bob Evans showed by
two very good tracer experiments that the corrosion
rate of such alloys in a fluoride salt containing UF,
was controlled by the diffusion rate of chromium
in the metal. The corrosion reaction involved chro-

" mium in the alloy reacting with UF, in the salt to

produce UF,; and CrF,, both of which are soluble in
the salt. This reaction can be written:

Cr(dissolved in + UF.s = CrF:(dissolved + UF;

The reaction is temperature-dependent and the net
effect 1s that chromium is removed from the hotter
parts of the system and deposited in the cooler parts.
Thus, the chromium level should be as low as pos-
sible to obtain the lowest corrosion rate in fluoride
salts.

However, Inouye’s studies of oxidation in air
revealed a need for chromium. As Figure 2 shows,
the oxidation rate decreased markedly as the chro-
mium level was increased. In fact, as much as 6%
chromium was required to obtain an oxide that was
adherent and kept the metal from oxidizing too rap-
idly. And the need for 6% chromium was corrobo-
rated by the observation that of the alloys shown
in Table 2 only INOR-7 and INOR-8 had acceptable
oxidation resistance at 1500°F.

All of the alloys had adequate strength, because
of the 15 to 20% molybdenum present. Titanium and
aluminum increased the strength even further,
but the gains in strength were not worth the fabri-
cation problems mentioned earlier. The precise
levels of chromium and iron did not affect the
strength appreciably. |

All of these alloys could be welded by the tung-
sten electrode with inert cover gas (TIG) process
as long as the boron, sulphur and phosphorus levels
were each below 0.01%. These are impurity ele-

40

 

ments and they can be kept at this level with rea-
sonable care. |

All of these factors led ultimately to the alloy
composition specified in Table 3. The final composi-
tion 1s nearest to that of the experimental alloy
INOR-8, which is how the alloy has always been
known at ORNL. A patent application was filed
on March 3, 1958 and patent No. 2,921,850 was
issued on January 19, 1960 to H. Inouye, W. D.
Manly, and T. K. Roche.

Molten Salt Reactors for
Civilian Power

The ANP program was discontinued in 1960 and
the mission of the program was shifted to civilian
power reactors and became known as the Molten
Salt Reactor Program. A demonstration reactor
was needed and construction on the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE) began in 1961.

Very little additional development was done.
Long-term corrosion experiments were conducted
and the mechanical properties were measured on
several heats procured for the MSRE to insure that
the properties were equivalent to those measured
for the development heats of INOR-8. One problem

OAK RiIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY Review
 

worthy of mention developed in the form of cracks
that occurred during welding. The cause of this was
never determined, but as a consequence the heats
of INOR-8 for the MSRE were purchased from
Haynes Stellite (now Materials System Division of
Union Carbide) on the specified condition that their
weldability be first demonstrated by the vendor.
The actual number of heats rejected as a result of
this clause is not known, but we got the general im-
pression that the markedly improved quality re-
sulted from some revisions in the melting practice.

The fabrication of the metal components of the
MSRE proceeded without major incident and the
reactor went critical on June 1, 1965. The heat ex-
changer shown in Figure 3 gives an idea of the com-
plexity of the structure. In all, some 100,000 lbs
of INOR-8 went into fabricating the system. The
performance of the MSRE has been extremely satis-

- fying to all concerned and the role of INOR-8 in this

success story is a vital one. We have removed
several pieces of INOR-8 for examination and have
not been able to detect any corrosion. In spite of
this, however, the salt in the MSRE continues to
pick up chromium from the metal, and the amount
after about 30,000 hours at 1200°F is equivalent
to removing the chromium from a surface to a depth
of about 0.7 mil (a human hair is one to three mils
thick).

Need for Improvement

Since the MSRE was fabricated, we have found
that INOR-8, like most iron and nickel base alloys,
is embrittled by neutron irradiation. Metallurgists
and solid state physicists have known for many

41

TIME (hr)

years that metals are hardened when they are ir-
radiated at relatively low temperatures. This hard-
ening is referred to as “displacement damage,” since
it is caused by atoms being displaced from their
normal positions by neutrons. These displaced atoms
interfere with the normal mechanisms of deforma-
tion and make the metals stronger. If the neutron
irradiation occurs at higher temperatures, thermal
motion enables the displaced atoms to return to
their normal positions and no hardening is observed.
This self-annealing temperature is about 1000°F
for alloys such as INOR-8 and the general conclusion
until about 1966 was that these materials could be
used in a neutron environment at higher tempera-
tures without significant change in properties.

However, more recent work has shown that this
assumption was wrong and that the ductility of al-
loys such as INOR-8 at 1200°F is reduced drastically
by neutron irradiation. This embrittlement has been
attributed to the helium that is produced by the
transmutation of boron-10. A thermal neutron re-
action, it can be written:

1B 4+ n — “‘He + "Li

Cyclotron injection experiments have shown that
the damage is due to the helium rather than the
lithium. Boron is present in these alloys as an im-
purity that comes primarily from the refractories
used during melting (1°B constitutes only 18.2%
of natural boron). The cross section for this trans-
mutation is quite high and all of the °B will be
transmuted to helium in a molten salt reactor after
a neutron fluence of about 1 X 102! neutrons/cm?.

The exact mechanism by which helium embrittles
these alloys is not understood, but ease of crack

and unirradiated (curve A) samples of INOR-8. The samples

propagation seems to be the most dramatic effect.
This is best measured in the response of a metal
sample to a sustained load in the irradiated and
unirradiated conditions. Such tests are normally
referred to as “creep tests,” and simulate the type
of loading experienced by a reactor vessel under
steady-state operation. The load (force) or stress
(force per unit area) is applied and the resulting
deformation is observed. This deformation or creep
will cause small cracks to form in the metal that
eventually link together until the sample fractures.
A well-behaved engineering material such as
INOR-8 will respond as shown in curve A in Fig-
ure 4. When this same material is stressed while
being irradiated, curve B is obtained. A lot of metal-
lurgy is tied up in the shape of these curves, but the
important fact for our analysis is that the curves
are identical for the irradiated and unirradiated
samples for the first 100 hours, or up to where the
irradiated sample fractured. Thus, the processes
that cause the stressed metal to deform (creep) are
not influenced by irradiation, but the irradiated
sample fractures in a shorter time owing to the
easier propagation of cracks. This is illustrated
further by the photomicrographs shown in Figure 5.

Tests were run to determine quantitatively the
effects of this embrittlement on the materials used
in the MSRE structure. These tests showed that the
fracture ductility was reduced as the quantity of
helium in the metal was increased by going to higher
thermal neutron fluences. Another important ob-
servation was that the fracture ductility depended
heavily upon how fast the metal was deformed. The
lowest fracture ductilities occur at a deformation
rate of about 0.1% per hour. Such high deformation
rates would not be encountered normally in a re-
actor system but may occur during transients in-
volving rapid change in temperature and pressure.
The ductility then improves slightly as the deforma-
tion rate is reduced further to a more realistic rate
of 0.001% per hour. (The MSRE was designed to
deform at a rate no higher than 0.00001% per hour.)

The properties of INOR-8 are adequate for the
MSRE where the anticipated thermal neutron flu-
ence is less than 5 X 10" neutrons/cm?. However,
the design lifetime of a power reactor such as the
Molten Salt Breeder (MSBR) is 30 years and the
fluence on the vessel will be at least 1 X 102! neu-

OAK RipGE NATIONAL LABORATORY Review

 
trons/cm?. The need for an alloy with better resist-
‘ance to embrittlement, therefore, is evident.

Reduce the Boron Content?

You might think the obvious solution to a problem
that results from the presence of boron would be to
get rid of the boron. And although at low deformation
rates the fracture ductility is reduced from 30 to
3% by the presence of only 1 ppm helium, we pur-
sued this avenue for a short time. The main source
of boron is from the refractories (ceramic vessels)
used in melting the alloys. The regular melting
practice used in making the metal for the MSRE
produced material with 20 to 50 ppm boron. By
employing vacuum melting practice and using
very pure components the content was reduced to 1
to 2 ppm, probably the lowest attainable by com-
mercial vendors. We have even made small labora-
tory melts containing .02 ppm boron, but we found
that even these alloys were very brittle after ir-
radiation. Thus we have been forced to conclude

that the levels of helium required to embrittle this
alloy are so low that reducing the boron level will
not offer much improvement.

Modification of the Chemical
Composition

A closer look at the mechanism of embrittlement
by helium reveals several other important charac-
teristics. Metals are made up of grains, or small
crystals. At low temperatures they usually frac-
ture across the grains (intragranular) and at ele-
vated temperatures they fracture along the grain
boundaries (intergranular). Helium is embrittling
to these alloys only in the temperature range where
the fracture is intergranular. Since helium is nearly
insoluble in metals and moves very slowly, it fol-
lows that only the helium that is generated near
the grain boundaries can have an effect on the frac-
ture process. Since the range of the transmuted
helium atom is only about two microns in iron and
nickel, the B atoms must be located very near the
grain boundaries. With the boron present in parts-

Figure 5. Photomicrographs of the samples plotted in Figure 4. The irra-
diated sample on the right shows relatively few cracks that occurred before
they linked together to cause fracture, in contrast with the unirradiated
sample ( left ) which deformed 13% before fracturing but showed
numerous cracks

 

FaLr 1969

43
- per-million concentrations the shattering effect

it has is surprising. However, the boron atom is
smaller than that of iron and nickel and is not ac-
commodated easily in the crystal structure. Thus
boron gravitates toward the grain boundaries where
the arrangement of atoms is interrupted by the in-
tersection of grains of different orientations. Hence,
the laws of nature provide a mechanism for concen-
trating boron in a region where it is most detri-
mental.

One solution to this problem that seems reason-
able is to add an element that will react with the
boron to form a stable compound. Ideally, by suit-
able annealing, the compound could be deposited
as fine precipitates located within the grains rather
than at the grain boundaries. However, the location
of the precipitates along the grain boundaries may
be acceptable if the transmuted helium remains
associated with the precipitate and does not in-
fluence the fracture process. Very fine precipitates
along the boundaries can even retard the propaga-
tion of cracks and might prove beneficial from this
standpoint. Hence, the key item in our thinking
was to add small amounts of elements such as tita-
nium, zirconium and hafnium that formed com-
pounds with boron. |

One thing to understand here is the extreme im-
portance of the electron optic equipment that has
only become available in recent years. An ingenious
device, the microprobe analyzer, is capable of de-
termining the chemical composition of an area about
two microns in diameter, permitting analysis of
both the precipitates and the surrounding areas
(matrix). These precipitates can be extracted and
collected by a process which involves dissolving
away the matrix material. They can then be identi-
fied by x-ray diffraction, analyzed by normal wet
chemistry techniques, or placed in the electron mi-
croscope for electron diffraction and for qualitative
analysis by the microprobe attachment for this
instrument. The metal can also be corroded with
acids until it can be seen through by the electron
microscope to determine its structure and the role
that the precipitates play in deformation and frac-
ture. Moreover, these same techniques can be ap-
plied to irradiated samples since very small amounts
of material are involved. This work has been per-
formed by R. E. Gehlback, J. O. Stiegler, R. S.
Crouse, and H. V. Mateer and has been the key
item in the program to modify INOR-S8. »

We also examined the other elements in INOR-8
for the purpose of simplifying the alloy as much as

X

- possible. The microstructure shown in Figure 6 is

characteristic of the standard Hastelloy N. The
large precipitates are carbides of the MC (six metal
atoms to one of carbon) type where M is 50% Mo,
40% Ni, 5% Cr, 1% Fe, and up to 4% Si. These par-
ticles are located in “stringers” in the metal, causing
the grain size to be much smaller near the stringers.
The particles themselves are very brittle, and frac-
ture as the material is deformed. When the material
is irradiated and is also relatively brittle these
cracks can propagate to cause failure. The particles
are too large to improve the strength, so we sought
to eliminate these from the microstructure.

Our analysis of the matrix (excluding the preci-
pitates) revealed that only about 12% of the Mo was
actually dissolved in the alloy. The bulk of it went
to form the massive MgC carbides. We made several
small melts with varying Mo content and found
that alloys with 10% and 12% Mo were free of the
massive precipitates and those with 14% and greater

OAK RiDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY Review

 
 

Mo concentrations contained the precipitates. The
strength penalty for decreasing the Mo content from
16% to 12% was modest enough and we decided to
make this change in the alloy composition.

As mentioned previously the amount of chromium
in the alloy was a compromise between resistance
to oxidation and to salt corrosion. Hence, we did
not alter the concentration of this element. The ad-
dition of chromium as ferrochrome also adds about
4% iron. We did not think the iron was harmful,
but its elimination gave us one less variable.

Because of the very reactive elements (titanium,
zirconium and hafnium) that we were adding, we
chose to use the vacuum melting practice, in which
the molten alloy is not exposed to air. This melting
technique has become very common over the past

few years and is preferred by most vendors for melt-

ing even standard INOR-8. The vacuum melting
practice also reduces the amount of so-called “re-
sidual” elements introduced such as manganese,

silicon, boron, nitrogen and oxygen. Nickel-base
alloys are notorious for being embrittled by small
amounts of sulphur, so we retained some manganese
in our specification to tie the sulphur up as a stable
Mn-S compound. The other residual elements were
kept as low as possible.

Recent work by C. E. Sessions has shown that the
strength of INOR-8 depends very strongly on the
carbon content. As the C is decreased below the
normal (0.04% to 0.08%), the strength decreases
dramatically; higher concentrations improve the
strength gradually. Inouye had observed earlier
that they could not fabricate tubing from material
containing more than 0.1% C. These factors in-
dicated that we should leave the carbon specification
at 0.04% to 0.08%.

Our resulting modified alloy then contained 12%
molybdenum, 7% chromium, 0.2% manganese, 0.06%
carbon, and small additions of titanium, zirconium
or hafnium.

important feature is the grain boundary
lined with small MC-type carbide
precipitates. These help to

disperse boron and

inhibit crack propagation

along the boundary.

Properties of the Modified Alloys

Several small melts were made to investigate the
effects of T1, Zr and Hf on the mechanical properties
after irradiation. (The behavior shown in Figure 7
is characteristic of the Ti addition.) These samples

were irradiated at 1200°F and then tested in the

hot cell to determine the strength and ductility
after irradiation. Both parameters were improved
dramatically as the titanium level exceeded 0.3%
to 0.4%. Zirconium and hafnium brought about
similar improvements.

We sought to keep the titanium, zirconium and
hafnium additions as low as possible for two rea-
sons. First, these elements depress the melting
point of nickel-base alloys and can cause cracking
in the early stages of a melt or during welding. A
second reason is that these elements form brittle
compounds with nickel. The exact levels required
to achieve undesirable results were not known, so

46

 

we started with very low concentrations.

We obtained a few 100-1b ingots from commercial
vendors to have some plates for investigating the
weldability. We found that the zirconium reduced
weldability when only 0.05% was present. We did
not investigate these alloys further. Alloys con-
taining up to 1% Ti and 1% Hf had good weldability.

We could not afford to carry parallel development
programs on alloys containing titanium and haf-
nium additions. Titanium is present in several iron
and nickel base alloys, so we felt more comfortable
with this addition and proceeded further with its
development. Our development schedule for the near
future included several 100-lb melts to study the
effects of variations in titanium and carbon levels
and one 5,000-1b melt. (The original development
program for INOR-8 involved about 30 melts of
this size, but today’s austerity does not allow this
approach.)

Our initial irradiation tests were carried out at

1200°F, operating temperature of the MSRE. The
strength and fracture strain of the titanium-modified
alloys were excellent after irradiation, and welding
studies showed that they generally had good weld-
ability. The single 5,000-1b melt fabricated well
and about 50% was converted into useful products.
This large heat had one idiosyncrasy: it cracked
when welded with filler metal from the same heat.
However, sound welds were made with eight other
heats of filler wire and we were not concerned about
the basic weldability of the titanium-modified alloys.

All seemed well with our new alloy until, anti-
cipating that molten salt breeder reactors will
operate at 1300°F, we irradiated some samples at
higher temperatures. Much to our dismay, we found
that the samples irradiated at 1300°F and higher
reverted to about the same limitations as the stand-
ard alloy.

We examined thin sections of some of the irra-
diated samples in the electron microscope and found

Figure 8. Another sample of the same
composition irradiated at 1300°F before
creep-testing at 1200°F. This one deformed
only 0.4% before it fractured, so fewer
dislocations occurred. Much of the

of precipitates and contain occasional

present are coarse and of the M,C type.

that the microstructure varied dramatically with
irradiation temperature. The microstructure shown
in Figure 7 was noted after irradiation at 1175°F
and creep testing at 1200°F. The most important
feature is the grain boundary lined with very small
particles. If you tried to shear this boundary, you
would probably find that it is very strong and that
these particles would make crack propagation dif-
ficult. These particles were found to be carbides of
the MC type where M consists of molybdenum and
the modifying elements added such as titanium,
niobium, zirconium, or hafnium. A sample of the
material irradiated at 1300°F and tested at 1200°F
has the microstructure shown in Figure 8. The
grain boundaries in this sample are free of preci-
pitates for large distances and the precipitates
present are relatively coarse. Occasional helium
bubbles are visible along the grain boundaries.
The precipitates in this sample are of the M,C type
with M being 90% molybdenum and 10% chromium.

Recall that the proposed mechanism of embrittle-
ment of this alloy during irradiation involves the
accumulation of helium (from transmuted boron-10)
at the grain boundaries. The fine precipitates
formed at 1175°F would disperse the °B and also
provide a boundary that resists crack propagation.
Both of these factors probably contribute to the
good properties of the alloys containing the fine
MC precipitate. The coarse M,C type would not be
effective in either regard.

Thus a critical part of our improved alloy seemed
to be the fine MC precipitate and we looked at
further chemical modifications that would make this
carbide stable at higher temperatures. From our
own work and from the literature, we compiled a
list of those carbides which were favored by various
alloying elements of interest. This list (Table 4)
only indicates the trend, and the alloys have to be

-made to determine how much of each element is

required to form the desired MC carbide. For ex-

ample, adding titanium favors the formation of the
MC type, but we found in an alloy containing 0.5%
Ti that MC was formed at 1200°F and that M,C was
formed after long periods of heating at 1300°F.
This type of information could only have been
gathered by making the experimental alloy.

We have irradiated several alloys containing var-
ious concentrations of the elements listed in Table
4. To date alloys having chemical compositions that
cause the formation of the MC type precipitate
have very good mechanical properties after irradia-
tion. The properties of several of the more attractive
alloys and those of standard Hastelloy N are com-
pared in Figure 9. These alloys were all irradiated
at 1400°F and retained their good properties. The
properties of the alloy containing 1% Ti with 1% Hf
are very good, and those of the alloy containing 0.5%
Ti with 2% Nb are acceptable.

Further work will be required to decide the exact
composition of the alloy to be used in future reac-
tors. The information obtained from our small melts
will be used to write specifications for several large
5,000-1b melts. These alloys will be tested to deter-
mine their strength and ductility after irradiation.
Large sections will also be welded to insure that the
alloys can be joined. These studies will lead to a final
chemical specification that will be used for procur-
ing materials for future molten salt reactors.
