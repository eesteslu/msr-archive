The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a novel reactor design that utilizes the
graphite-matrix high-temperature fuel of helium-cooled reactors, but provides cooling with a high-
temperature fluoride salt. For applications at temperatures greater than 900°C the AHTR 1is also
referred to as a Liquid-Salt-Cooled Very High-Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR). This report
provides an assessment of candidate salts proposed as the primary coolant for the AHTR based upon
a review of physical properties, nuclear properties, and chemical factors. The physical properties most
relevant for coolant service were reviewed. Key chemical factors that influence material compatibility
were also analyzed for the purpose of screening salt candidates.

Some simple screening factors related to the nuclear properties of salts were also developed. The
moderating ratio and neutron-absorption cross-section were compiled for each salt. The short-lived
activation products, long-lived transmutation activity, and reactivity coefficients associated with
various salt candidates were estimated using a computational model.

Table A presents a summary of the properties of the candidate coolant salts. Certain factors in this
table, such as melting point, vapor pressure, and nuclear properties, can be viewed as stand-alone
parameters for screening candidates. Heat-transfer properties are considered as a group in Sect. 3 in
order to evaluate the combined effects of various factors. In the course of this review, it became
apparent that the state of the properties database was strong in some areas and weak in others. A
qualitative map of the state of the database and predictive capabilities is given in Table B. It 1s
apparent that the property of thermal conductivity has the greatest uncertainty and is the most difficult
to measure. The database, with respect to heat capacity, can be improved with modern instruments
and modest effort.

In general, “lighter” (low-Z) salts tend to exhibit better heat transfer and nuclear performance
metrics. Lighter salts also tend to have more favorable (larger) moderating ratios, and thus should
have a more favorable coolant-voiding behavior in-core. Heavy (high-7) salts tend to have lower heat
capacities and thermal conductivities and more significant activation and transmutation products.
However, all of the salts are relatively good heat-transfer agents. A detailed discussion of each
property and the combination of properties that served as a heat-transfer metric is presented in the
body of this report.

In addition to neutronic metrics, such as moderating ratio and neutron absorption, the activation
properties of the salts were investigated (Table C). Again, lighter salts tend to have more favorable

activation properties compared to salts with high atomic-number constituents. A simple model for

X1
estimating the reactivity coefficients associated with a reduction of salt content in the core (voiding or
thermal expansion) was also developed, and the primary parameters were investigated. It appears that
reasonable design flexibility exists to select a safe combination of fuel-element design and salt
coolant for most of the candidate salts.
Materials compatibility is an overriding consideration for high-temperature reactors; therefore
the question was posed whether any one of the candidate salts was inherently, or significantly,
more corrosive than another. This is a very complex subject, and it was not possible to exclude
any fluoride salts based on the corrosion database. The corrosion database clearly indicates
superior container alloys, but the effect of salt identity is masked by many factors which are
likely more important (impurities, redox condition) in the testing evidence than salt identity.
Despite this uncertainty, some reasonable preferences can be recommended, and these are
indicated in the conclusions. The reasoning to support these conclusions is established in the

body of this report.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a novel reactor design that utilizes the
graphite-matrix high-temperature fuel of helium-cooled reactors, but provides cooling with a
high-temperature fluoride salt [1,2]. The purpose of this report 1s to provide a critical review of
relevant properties of candidate salts for use in the evaluation and ranking of coolants for the
AHTR. Considerable experience exists with molten salts; however, previous nuclear experience
with molten salts was for reactor systems that contained fissile and fertile material in the primary
fluid (which served as both fuel and primary coolant). The AHTR uses solid fuel and “clean™
coolant salt. Also, the AHTR is expected to operate at much higher temperatures than previous
applications. Hence, the property and composition requirements may be quite different than those
for previous applications, and a new assessment of options is required.

High-temperature operation (>700°C) and new compositions have been evaluated based on
open literature and internal reports available to the authors, and on use of the best available
estimation techniques. Recommended estimation methods are identified when possible, and
measurement techniques are briefly discussed when necessary. A number of salt compositions
have been examined in detail in previous studies—e.g., eutectic compositions of LiF-BeF,, NaF-
BeF,, LiF-NaF-KF, and NaF-ZrF,. These salt systems serve as endpoints for an investigation of
more complex systems that can offer more favorable properties.

The screening logic for selecting primary and secondary salt coolants established by Grimes
[3,4] many years ago still applies to the selection of the AHTR coolant. Grimes” basic
conclusions remain true today; however, the evaluation criteria are slightly different for a primary
coolant application. Grimes first considered all the elements that could possibly be used in a
molten salt coolant based on thermal neutron-capture cross-sections (values <1 barn). This list 1s
shown in Table 1. He then applied a number of additional screening criteria to candidate

compounds. Grimes required that elements must form compounds that:

exhibit chemical stability at T > 800°C,
are stable under intense radiation,
melt at useful temperatures (<525°C) and are not volatile,

are compatible with high-temperature alloys and graphite, and

SNk D=

dissolve useful quantities of fertile and fissile material.

Only the last item (#5) does not apply to the AHTR primary coolant. The omission of this
requirement does not affect the elements that can be considered; rather, it broadens the list of
potential candidate mixtures of these elements. The results of this screening process are shown in
Table 1.

Three basic salt systems exhibit usefully low melting points and also have the potential for
neutronic viability and materials compatibility with alloys: (1) alkali fluoride salts, (2) ZrF,-
containing salts, and (3) BeF,-containing salts. These three families of salts are the basis for the
examination of properties in this report. Other coolants (water, liquid metals, and additional salts)
are included as a basis for heat-transfer comparisons in Sect. 3, even though they are not suitable

candidates for the AHTR coolant.
2. REVIEW OF PROPERTIES

2.1 THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES

2.1.1 Melting Point
Without question, the melting (or freezing) point is the single most important physical

property for a candidate coolant. The requirement for a low freezing temperature depends, to some
degree, on the system design, and especially on the power-generation machinery. Because salt
coolants possess high heat capacity, the temperature drop in the primary loop is typically small —
between 50 and 100°C. For the design and operation of salt-fueled reactors, such as the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment (ARE), the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and the Molten Salt
Breeder Reactor (MSBR), a requirement was established that the primary-salt freeze temperature
should provide a significant temperature margin (>100°C) to freezing throughout the plant. Thus,
fuel-containing salts, which also served as the primary coolant for fluid-fueled designs, were
required to have freezing points below 525°C to be considered useful [4]. The 525°C limit was also
dictated by the need for the primary coolant to exchange heat in a practical manner with the
secondary coolant. The previous generation of secondary coolant salts were expected to operate in
a steam generator, so a secondary-salt freezing point less than 400°C was required [5].

The situation for the AHTR 1s different from that of these fluid-fueled systems, but some
useful analogies can be drawn. We do not know exactly what the power-generation machinery or
heat-transfer loop will require of a secondary coolant, thus we cannot predict exactly what the
freezing point requirements will be for the primary coolant. However, we can assume that a high-
temperature reactor of the type envisioned by the AHTR will use gas turbines of some type for
the highest-temperature portion of the power-generation machinery and will not require freezing
points as low as those required by steam systems.

Therefore, while the requirement for a low freezing point is not as fundamental a constraint
for the AHTR system as for previous systems, it will still be highly desirable for the purposes of
having cheaper materials and simpler systems everywhere in the plant. The requirements for the
freezing point for AHTR coolant will probably exist somewhere between the limits established
previously for the MSBR fuel salt (525°C) and secondary salt (400°C). Because molten salts are a
new technology for the nuclear industry, it is highly desirable to use a system with as low a
freezing point as possible in order to simplify the materials, components, and system

requirements. Salts that freeze below 400°C should be given priority, all other factors being equal.
An extensive database of phase diagrams exists for salt systems of all types [6,7]; therefore,
there 1s very little need to pursue estimation techniques. Because no single-component salt freezes
at a sufficiently low temperature, multicomponent mixtures of salts are required. Nearly all of the
binary phase diagrams of interest have been measured, and many of the ternary systems have also
been investigated. In general, the primary lowering of the freezing point (as much as 500°C)
occurs with the addition of the first salt to a pure component. Additional lowering of the freezing
point can be achieved by adding a third component, but these freezing-point depressions are of a
lower order (~50°C). Additional components are typically important for reasons other than
lowering of the freezing point (e.g., cost, neutronics, or some other physical property).

The families of fluorides that are useful for primary coolant applications have already been
identified [8]: (a) alkali-fluorides, (b) ZrF,-salt mixtures, and (c¢) BeF,-salt mixtures. Table 2 lists
the primary eutectic compositions in each family in order of freezing point. Simplified phase
diagrams [9] of the most important binary systems are included in Figs. 1-3.

In creating the list in Table 2, we excluded certain compositions for reasons that may not be
readily apparent. For example, in the phase diagram of BeF, systems, there exist very low
freezing-temperature compositions in the BeF,-rich region, and it would be natural to include
these 1n a list of low-freezing candidates. However, experience has demonstrated that these BeF,-
rich systems are not good candidates because they are very viscous due to the associative
behavior of BeF; in these mixtures. Table 2 also includes some systems normally excluded from
consideration as primary coolants. Potassium-containing salts are usually excluded from
consideration as a primary coolant because of the relatively large parasitic capture cross-section
of potassium. However, potassium-containing salts are commonly used in non-nuclear
applications and serve as a useful frame of reference (e.g., FLiNaK). As can be seen in Table 2, in
all cases, there are rubidium analogs to the potassium systems that have freezing points close to
that of corresponding potassium systems. Rubidium has a parasitic thermal neutron-capture cross-
section much lower than potassium; however, it also possesses epithermal resonance absorption

bands.

RbF
A discussion of ternary systems requires that we introduce some of the material on vapor
pressure developed in the next section. The desirability of considering ternary salt systems is
discussed below for each family of salts.

The alkali fluorides possess simple ternary low-melting eutectic compositions listed in
Table 2; therefore, phase diagrams do not need to be examined. These ternary systems possess
only modest melting point depressions (~40°C) compared to the binary eutectics. The ternary
eutectic compositions are favored in preference to the binary eutectics because they substitute
inexpensive NaF for expensive 'LiF and neutron-absorbing KF. The ternary eutectic in the LiF-
NaF-BeF, system possesses a 25°C melting-point depression compared to the NaF-BeF, eutectic,
but this mixture does not seem useful as a coolant because 1t does not offer a significant
advantage over the NaF-BeF, eutectic, and yet it requires the addition of an expensive
component: 'LiF.

The ternary systems containing ZrF4 offer more promising possibilities. The ternary eutectic
in the LiF-NaF-ZrF, system possesses a large phase field (Fig. 4) with melting points below
500°C, and distinct eutectic compositions at a Na:Zr ratio of 1. These ternary eutectics
(42-29-29 and 26-37-37 mol %) are the most promising candidate coolants because (a) they
maintain ZrF, <40 mol % (necessary for low vapor pressure) and (b) they provide a significant
melting point depression (40—64°C) compared to the NaF-ZrF, binary system. The eutectic
composition of 30-24-46 is not favored because it offers little melting point advantage and yet
still imposes high ZrF, vapor pressures and significant 'Li content.

The NaF-RbF-ZrF, ternary system, (shown in Fig. 5) also possesses some attractive
compositions with low melting points. The advantage of replacing RbF with NaF is that NaF is
relatively inexpensive, it has a lower effective neutron cross-section than RbF, and compositions
with lower ZrF, content (and thus lower vapor pressure) can be considered. The very lowest
melting point regions (T <400°C) shown in Fig. 5 are not significantly different than the RbF-
ZrF, eutectic compositions. The eutectic regions in the neighborhood of Na:Rb = 1.44 have a
number of interesting properties. Quite a few eutectic mixtures exist with melting points in the
neighborhood of 420-430°C. Figure 6 displays the liquidus temperatures along the line
Na:Rb =1.44, and indicates a minimum melting point region in the neighborhood of
ZrF,=39-43 mol %. A composition of 33-23.5-43.5 melting at 420°C was selected as a
candidate coolant because it is likely to have the best neutronic behavior among these particular

compositions.

It should be noted that all of the systems containing lithium will require highly enriched "Li.
In the family of alkali-fluoride salts, all of the mixtures with acceptable freezing points contain
lithium. The BeF, and ZrF, families of salts possess low-freezing points that do not contain
lithtum. Numerous compositions listed in Table 2 contain no lithium and are relatively low-cost,
low-freezing point mixtures that are likely to exhibit suitable physical properties. Salts containing
enriched lithium will certainly have better neutronic performance than their analogs containing
Na, Rb, or K, but at a significant extra expense associated with isotopic enrichment. If
1sotopically enriched materials are to be considered, then the boron-containing fluoroborate
mixtures could be added to this list. The option of enriching boron for this particular application
has never been proposed before, and there 1s no apparent basis for estimating the cost of enriching
boron to the extreme levels required for this application (as was done for lithtum). In addition to
the 1ssue of isotopic enrichment, an assessment of the BF; volatility in all of the fluoroborate salts
will need to be considered. For the basis of property comparisons, fluoroborates are considered in

a separate section of this report.

13
2.1.2 Vapor Pressure and Vapor Species
Most fluoride salts exhibit very low vapor pressures. Only compounds with higher oxidation

state cations (such as BF;, UF¢, and MoF) exhibit high vapor pressures. A few of the elements
useful for coolants (BeF,, ZrF,) exhibit appreciable vapor pressures (>1 mm Hg) at 800°C.
Table 3 catalogs the normal boiling and freezing points of single-component salts and of a few
key multicomponent mixtures [10].

As 1s evident in Table 3, mixtures of these pure components will always exhibit lower vapor
pressures (higher boiling points) than the most volatile constituent. Therefore, these salts do not
exert significant vapor pressures (> 1 bar) except at very extreme temperatures. The MSRE
operated with a cover pressure of 5 psig of helium, and the MSBR was designed for a cover

pressure of 40 psig.

“Estimated by extrapolation of lower-temperature data (~1100°C).

However, other factors are important. Even in a low-pressure system, the magnitude and
nature of vapor produced from the salt needs to be evaluated. Experience with the ARE and the
MSRE shows that very low salt vapor pressures (<1 mm Hg) simplify the off-gas system design

and that certain vapor species can present problems.

14
In any high-temperature salt system, a purged cover gas will be necessary. The transport of
significant amounts of salt vapor in this cover gas system can cause problems. In the operation of
the ARE, it was found that the vapor over the ARE salt (53%NaF-41% ZrF,-6%UF,) was nearly
pure ZrF,. Because ZrF4 sublimes rather than boils, ZrF, “snow” was found 1n the exhaust piping.
The ZrF, was not returned to the salt reservoir by condensing as a liquid and draining back to the
salt reservoir. Elaborate “snow traps” were designed (Fig. 7) to mitigate this problem [11], but 1t
appears that a wise choice of salt composition can eliminate it completely.

The experience with the MSRE was quite different. The MSRE salts (65%L1F-29%BeF,-5%
ZrF4-1% UF,) exhibited very low vapor pressure, more than 100 times lower than the ARE salt.
The vapor over the MSRE salt was also of a different character. This vapor contained both LiF
and BeF, in a proportion that melted at a low temperature, such that the condensate would drain

back to the reservoir as a liquid.

Vapor pressure is the physical property that is most sensitive to salt composition. Studies
have been conducted to understand the effect of composition on the vapor pressure and vapor
species of the thermodynamically non-ideal systems containing ZrF, and BeF, [12]. The results
of these studies are useful for understanding and selecting the optimum coolant salt composition

and are briefly reviewed in the following paragraphs.

15
The effect of salt composition on vapor pressure can be explained with the Lewis acid-base
theory [13]. The native volatility of compounds containing the “acidic” constituent (Zr*", Be*")
can be suppressed by donation of fluoride anions from the “basic” alkali fluoride constituent. The
product of this donation is a low-volatility coordination-complex that is an integral part of the
molten salt solution. Not all the alkali fluorides are equal in their ability to donate fluoride anions
for coordination compounds. The affinity of alkali cations for their own fluoride anion decreases
with increasing atomic number; thus, the heavier alkali elements will more readily donate their
fluoride anions. Therefore, heavier alkali fluorides are more effective in reducing the native
volatility of the compounds containing the acidic species (Zr*", Be").

The effect of salt composition on vapor pressure 1s readily apparent in the BeF, and ZrF,
systems. Figures 8 and 9 display the suppression of volatility as the ratio of alkali fluoride content
increases so that it satisfies the coordination-bonding demands of the polyvalent cation. These
figures also show the heavier alkali fluorides are more effective in suppressing the native
volatility of the compound containing the polyvalent element (e.g., beryllium or zirconium).

The decrease of vapor pressure due to coordination bonding is also accompanied by a change in
vapor composition. For a system rich in alkali fluoride, the vapor consists primarily of the alkali
fluoride. For salt compositions that exist at the optimum ratio that just satisfies the coordination
demands of the system, the vapor species 1s an association complex of the alkali fluoride and the
polyvalent cation. For systems deficient in alkali fluoride, the volatile species 1s the parent

compound containing the polyvalent cation. These trends are also indicated in Figures 8 and 9.

From a practical standpoint, we should favor salt compositions with very low vapor pressures
(<1 mm Hg at 900°C) that generate vapor species that readily melt after condensing. This
corresponds to salt compositions with a ZrF, mole fraction in the range of ~20-45%, and with a
mole fraction of BeF, less than ~35-45%, depending on the alkali cations present and the

temperature under consideration.

2.1.3 Density
Fluid density is important for the purpose of gauging the heat transport capability of a coolant

in both forced convection and (especially) natural convection. Density is among the most
straightforward of properties to measure and is one of the most readily estimated for new
compositions. Liquid salt density decreases linearly with increasing temperature. As expected,
low atomic number salts tend to be light (sp.g. ~2) and high atomic number salts tend to be heavy
(sp.g. > 4). Table 4 contains salt density equations developed from experimental measurements

for some of the candidate AHTR salts [10].

NaF-ZrF, (57-43) 3.650-0.00088T(°C)

 

It was discovered that there 1s a simple and accurate method for predicting salt density based
on additive molar volumes [14]. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researchers compiled a
list of single-compound molar volumes, given in Table 5, that allows estimation of mixture
densities to an accuracy better than 5% and permits useful density estimates for all of the AHTR
candidate mixtures. The following relationship is recommended for prediction of molar volume

and density for salt mixtures:

Pui(D) =X X, M; [ X, V(D) (1)
where
X; = mole fraction of component i
M; = formula weight of component i (g/mole)
V:(T) = molar volume of component i at temperature 7

Values in Table 5 at two different temperatures allow interpolation or extrapolation to other
temperatures.

There is no a priori reason to select a salt based on density alone, except that salts that have a
large density change with temperature may remove heat by natural convection better, resulting in
better cooling. Very dense salts may develop undesirable hydrostatic heads and may make extra
demands on pumping equipment, or may require consideration of buoyant graphite. Density will
be factored into heat transfer metrics along with other fluid properties in Sect. 3. Density
equations for candidate coolants not measured are listed in Table 6 according to the method of

additive molar volumes.

2.1.4 Heat Capacity
Fluoride salts have relatively large heat capacities — in fact, they rival water in their ability

to carry heat. The product of density and heat capacity is ~1 cal/cm’-°C, the same value as for
water. In the case of salts, the densities are somewhat greater than 1 g/cm’ and the heat capacities
are less than 1 cal/g-°C, but the product is ~1 cal/cm’-°C.

There is no fundamental theory that allows one to predict the heat capacity of various salt
compositions, but the empirical method of Dulong and Petit, which assumes a contribution of
8 cal/°C per mole of each atom in the mixture, has been the most successful estimation method

[14]. The Dulong and Petit estimation equation takes the form

Cp:8°ZXiNi/ZXl‘Mi, (2)

where
X; = mole fraction of component i
N; = atoms per salt constituent i (g/mole) [ =2 for alkali halides, = 3 for BeF,, = 5 for ZrF,]
M; = formula weight of component i (g/mole)
This method is accurate to only +£20%. Results for salts containing BeF, and ZrF, were more
accurate (=10%) than those for the alkali fluorides. A measurement of the FLiNaK heat capacity

in 1982 [15] gave the value as

C,=0.2333+2.54 x 10"« T[K] cal/g-°C . (3)

This expression gives a heat capacity at 700°C of 0.48 cal/g-°C, which is ~7% higher than the
value measured at ORNL (0.45) in the 1950s [10]. Experimentally determined and estimated
values of heat capacity are shown in Table 7. It should be noted that most of these experimental
values were determined with relatively crude calorimeters as judged by today’s standards. The
experimental accuracy for these older measurements is no better than =10%. Modern calorimeters
are capable of much more accurate measurements.

The measurement of the MSRE coolant salt (67%L1F-33%BeF,) was refined and is more
accurate (better than £2%) than the other values [16]. The variation of heat capacity with
temperature 1s small and is typically neglected during preliminary calculations. The temperature

variation was not resolved within the accuracy of most previous measurements.

2.2 FLUID TRANSPORT PROPERTIES

2.2.1 Viscosity
Molten salts exhibit normal fluid behavior. They are Newtonian fluids and exhibit the typical

exponential decrease in viscosity, u, with reciprocal temperature:

u (cP) = A exp (-B/T(K)) . (4)

Viscosity varies more with temperature than with any other fluid property. There are no truly
predictive models for molten salt viscosity; therefore, viscosity has been measured for many
systems by complementary methods. Even though there is a significant database, there are a
number of important mixtures for which no information exists; therefore, it is necessary to
examine the variation of viscosity with composition and to identify trends and bounds.

The information for binary mixtures is fairly complete and 1s displayed in Fig. 10 [10]. All of
the three families of low-melting salts have mixtures that exhibit reasonably low viscosities
(<10 cP) that make their use as industrial coolants possible. In contrast to other properties,
compositional changes can have significant effects on fluid viscosity. These changes are evident

in the variation of viscosity for different compositions within a binary or ternary system.

Fig. 10. Range of viscosities for various salt systems.

Viscosity, like vapor pressure and melting point, is strongly influenced by associative
phenomena in the fluid phase. The influence of salt composition is most dramatic in the BeF,
systems. The Be®" cation has a special tendency to self-associate in fluoride melts that do not
possess the requisite number of fluoride anions (1:4 Be:F) to satisfy the coordination demand of
Be®". The association of Be*" cations leads to an extended network that acts to increase the
viscosity of the molten salt. The thickening of the melt as the BeF, content increases (and the
Be:F ratio in the entire melt decreases) is shown in Fig. 11 for LiF-BeF, [17] and in Fig. 12 for
NaF-BeF, [18]. This thickening restricts the useful range of composition to less than 45% BeF,.
Figure 12 also reveals that the identity of the alkali cation in these systems has an effect. The
more basic rubidium and sodium cations more readily donate the fluoride anion to Be*" than does
the lithium cation, resulting in a decreased amount of Be*" self-association. Substitution of
sodium for lithium, and rubidium for sodium or lithium, will lower the viscosity in these BeF,
systems. The effect of potassium 1s expected to be intermediate between that of sodium and
rubidium. Highly viscous pure BeF, was investigated to see whether it displayed non-Newtonian

behavior. No deviation from Newtonian behavior was found [19].

It 1s more difficult to assess ZrF4-salts in the same manner as BeF, salts [18]. The ZrF, phase
diagrams have narrow low-melting regions; therefore, it is not possible to investigate large
composition changes without also changing the alkali cation identity. Figure 13 displays the
broadest low-melting phase field of NaF-ZrF, with a solid line. Within this range of ZrF, content
(42 to 52%), the change in viscosity is not large, but it does increase slightly with increasing ZrF,
content. The effect of adding or replacing the alkali cation is the same in the BeF, system: lighter
alkalis increase the viscosity, and heavier alkalis reduce the viscosity.

The variation in viscosity of various alkali fluoride mixtures is not large (Fig. 10) and follows
the same basic trend found for the BeF, and ZrF, systems. Heavier alkali mixtures are less
viscous than lighter alkali systems.

It should also be noted that the three families of salts represent three distinct classes of liquid
behavior. The alkali fluorides are ideal mixtures of very similar chemical constituents with very
little associative behavior, whereas both ZrF, and BeF, mixtures are potential glass-formers [20].
BeF,—rich mixtures are “strong” glass formers characterized by extended association of cations
into networks of large extent, thus giving rise to high viscosity “glassy” mixtures. BeF, is the
fluoride analog to the S10, glasses. Mixtures of ZrF, and alkali halides represent a different class
of “fragile” glass mixtures that form due to a particular type of mixture thermodynamics that
inhibits crystallization and preserves an amorphous structure during the liquid/solid phase
transition. The ZBLA (ZrF,-BaF,-LaF;) and ZBLAN (ZrF,-BaF,-LaF;-NaF) glasses used for
infrared optics are examples of this type of fragile glass [21]. These types of fragile glasses are
different than network glasses in that the glass-forming compositions are relatively low-viscosity
fluids rather than high-viscosity fluids [18].

The accuracy of previous viscosity determinations can be assessed by comparing the early
ORNL measurements conducted during the 1950s and 1960s and the few recent investigations
[22-23]. These comparisons can be made for systems of alkali fluorides and ZrF,-mixtures and
are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. The deviation between the older and newer measurements 1s about
10%, with the older measurements predicting higher values. The older ORNL values are based
on agreement of measurements obtained from capillary efflux and rotational viscometers. The
newer measurements were obtained from a novel oscillating cup viscometer customized for high
temperatures and sensitive to low-viscosity fluids. This agreement between newer and older
values 1s within the error band reported for the older measurements (£20%). For more
sophisticated viscosity correlations and extrapolation to higher temperatures, the methods

recommended by Veliyulin [24] can be used.

2.2.2 Thermal Conductivity
The thermal conductivity of molten salt is the most difficult fluid property to measure, and 1t

has led to the greatest amount of confusion and error in heat-transfer calculations. This state of
affairs 1s reflected in the general scientific literature on molten salt conductivity [25-27] and in
the work focused on molten salt reactors [28—30]. In early studies at ORNL using a variable-gap
apparatus, conductivities were reported that were four times higher than the value now believed
to be correct [18]. An improved variable-gap apparatus was designed to minimize the errors due
to convection and bypassing heat flow [29]. A far lower thermal conductivity was measured with
the improved apparatus, and these results were more similar to the values found for other salt
systems using hot-wire and annular cylinder techniques [30].

These errors in the measurement of thermal conductivity led to a number of erroneous
conclusions [31]. All of the systematic errors in measurement led to higher apparent values for
thermal conductivity. When heat-transfer studies were conducted using the “high” value for
thermal conductivity, it was found that the heat flow was lower than expected based on universal
correlations for convective heat transfer. Because of the unexpected “low” heat flux, it was
postulated that a significant film resistance must exist, and 1t was assumed that some type of
insulating film impeded heat flow between the salt and the metal. A film coefficient was assumed

in order to correct for this apparent discrepancy—but the discrepancy actually resulted from an

26
error 1n calculating the thermal conductivity of the salt. Numerous corrosion studies on alloys
exposed to salt for many years show that there 1s no such film on the surface of metals and that
there 1s no heat-transfer impediment due to insulating films. Fluoride salts are excellent fluxes for
both oxides and fluorides and quickly dissolve corrosion products. Metallic corrosion products
are dissolved in the salt solution. It was also found that “the overall heat transfer coefficient of the
MSRE heat exchanger did not change during 22,000 h of salt circulation and 13,000 equivalent
full-power hours of operation, thus indicating no buildup of scale and no evidence of gas filming”
[32]. Detailed forced-convection heat-transfer measurements confirmed this same behavior in
out-of-pile tests with the MSBR fuel salt composition [33].

The high values for the measured conductivity also caused confusion in the modeling and
correlation of molten salt conductivity. To account for the high values of measured conductivity,
Gambill [34] proposed that molten salts contribute to conductivity due to a diffusional
mechanism, in addition to the normal vibrational mechanism. Later studies showed that the
primary mechanism for heat transfer is from vibrational modes; therefore, molten salts have
conductivities in the same range as solid dielectrics [25].

Because measurement of high-temperature fluid thermal conductivity is a difficult task with a
number of potential sources of error, considerable scatter exists in the experimental database.
However, if the most reliable results using the hot-wire and annular cylinder methods are
compared, the results are more consistent and are amenable to modeling. The most successful
model for predicting the thermal conductivity of molten salts was proposed by Rao and refined by

Turnbull [25]:

k (watt/m-K) = 0.119 « T, « p*" [ (M/n)"'7 | (5)
where
T,, = melting point (K)
p = molar volume of the molten salt at (cm’/mole)
M = average formula weight of the salt (=X X; M; )
n = the number of discrete ions per salt formula (= 2 for simple salts like NaCl)

This model was originally proposed for simple one-component salts such as NaCl, but has
been extended to mixtures with polyvalent cations. Mixtures of salt components are expected to
exhibit a thermal conductivity slightly below the mole-fraction weighted average of the single
components due to disruption of the vibrational modes of the quasi-crystalline lattice. The
application of this model to salts with polyvalent cations requires an assignment of the 1on-
number n, based upon some assumption for speciation. Both of these factors introduce some
uncertainty in the predictions for more complex salt systems. For all of the estimates below it has

been assumed that n = 2.

27
Ignatiev and Khoklov [35,38] recommend an empirical equation that is simply a function of

temperature (7) and salt formula weight (M) for correlating thermal conductivity:

k (watt/m-K) = 0.0005+T(K) + 32.0/M — 0.34 . (6)

The database for the Russian correlation includes a large number of alkali halides, BeF-salts,
and salts containing UF, and ThF,. Table 8 presents the measured thermal conductivity values for
halide salts that are expected to be the most reliable and the results of both predictive methods.
The trend of decreasing thermal conductivity with increasing formula weight of the salt has been
found in other measurements on pure halide salts and their mixtures [25, 36-38]. There are

almost no reliable data on the thermal conductivity of ZrF,-containing salts.

3. HEAT-TRANSFER COMPARISONS

It 1s useful to compare the heat-transfer performance of the AHTR candidate coolants to other
coolants with which we have experience, or would like to consider for related applications
(secondary heat transfer fluids). With the exception of water, the temperature of 700°C was
selected for comparison because this permits properties to be evaluated more readily. A
temperature of 300°C was selected for water, because this 1s a typical coolant temperature used in
the primary circuit of existing nuclear power plants.

Table 9 lists the properties of the coolants to be used in the heat-transfer comparisons, as well

as the properties of ten candidate AHTR salts.

Generalized heat-transfer metrics are a useful tool for grouping coolant performance in the
absence of more detailed system designs. Bonilla [39] has provided general figures of merit
(FOM) based on minimal pumping power for a given coolant temperature rise as the objective

function for forced convection:

FOM (forced convection, turbulent) = u**/ (p* sz'g) , (7)

29
L = viscosity
p = fluid density
C, = heat capacity

For natural convection cooling, Bonilla also provide the following groups for passive cooling:

FOM (natural convection, turbulent) = [ uo'zl B p Cpl'g] 036 (8)

FOM (natural convection, laminar) = [ u/ B p’ Col 03 9)

where
B = volume expansivity = 1/p « dp/dT [1/°C] .
During evaluation of secondary coolants for the MSBR, Sanders [5] proposed a FOM related

to the area required for the primary heat exchanger:

FOM (heat exchanger area) = uo'z/ [C,"¢ k"¢ p*°] . (10)

Sanders recommends that this FOM be used only for comparison within a coolant group type
(salts, metals, or other). All of these FOMs are “golf-scores” — i.e., lower numbers correlate with
better performance. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the various FOMs for the comparison of
candidate coolants.

In general, we can conclude that the lighter molten salts (those not containing large quantities
of higher-atomic-number elements, e.g., rubidium and zirconium) have somewhat better heat
transfer performance than the heavy salts. The one exception is the laminar regime of natural
convection. In most passive cooling situations, the turbulent natural convection component is of

primary importance.

4. NUCLEAR PROPERTIES

An assessment of the neutronics properties for several coolant options was performed to
evaluate the effect of various salts on the standard operating conditions of the reactor and the

long- and short-term effects of neutron activation of the primary salts.

4.1 PARASITIC NEUTRON CAPTURE AND MODERATION

The thermal-spectrum AHTR reactor core design consists of three major constituents: the
fuel, the moderator, and the coolant. The purpose of the moderator (graphite) is to reduce the
energy of neutrons so that they will be easily absorbed in the fuel to cause additional fissions.
Any neutrons that are captured and fail to generate a fission reaction are considered parasitic to
the critical chain reaction in the core. Graphite has a very small probability of capturing neutrons;
therefore, the major component of parasitic neutron capture 1s the liquid-salt coolant. The
parasitic-neutron-capture rate is directly related to the efficiency of fuel utilization: increased
parasitic neutron capture requires additional fuel to maintain a critical system. If the coolant also
moderates neutrons, this benefit can offset the parasitic capture.

The relationship between capture and moderation is especially significant during a theoretical
accident scenario, when all or part of the coolant could be displaced with a void, such as boiled
coolant, a gas bubble trapped in the system, a blocked coolant channel, or a breach of the reactor
vessel. In these “beyond-design-basis™ accident scenarios, the increase in reactivity should be
minimized (preferably, there should be a decrease) when the void displaces the coolant.

Table 12 displays the parasitic-neutron-capture rates (relative to pure graphite on a per-unit-
volume basis) for the candidate salts from Table 2. The table also displays the moderating ratio, a
FOM that relates the effectiveness of moderation versus the parasitic neutron capture for a given

energy range:

& (AE ) = rate of energy loss (lethargy gain) due to neutron scattering for a

As indicated in Table 12, the total neutron capture of light water (H,O) is very large, much
larger than that of the other traditional coolants, such as heavy water (D,0) or graphite, and also
larger than that of most of the salts. However, the excellent moderating power of light water leads
to a much larger moderating ratio than that of any salt coolant. The neutron-capture rates of the
salts are much larger than those of (pure) graphite; therefore, minimizing the coolant in the core
will improve the fuel efficiency substantially from a neutronics perspective.

The BeF,; salts have the best neutronics properties (large moderating ratios and small parasitic
capture rates), while the alkali fluorides have the worst. The salts with low moderating ratios can
be expected to have the highest increase in reactivity when a void displaces coolant.

The results in Table 12 were produced in a pin-cell calculation using the TRITON/NEWT
depletion sequence with the CENTRM resonance processing tool from SCALES. 1, with a 238-
group ENDF/B-VI cross-section set. The "Li enrichment is 99.995% in the LiF constituent.

4.2 REACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS

The thermal-spectrum Liquid-Salt-Cooled Very High-Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR or
AHTR) core consists of three constituents: TRISO fuel, graphite-moderator, and molten-salt
coolant. A distinct feature of the liquid-salt cooled version of the Very High-Temperature
Reactor (VHTR) is that a major component of parasitic neutron capture, and a significant amount
of moderation, can reside in the liquid-salt coolant. The relationship between capture and
moderation 1s especially significant during transients or accident conditions; for example, when
coolant is removed from the core by a temperature-driven density change, a coolant void is
postulated, a gas bubble is trapped in the system, or a breach of the primary circuit occurs. For
these scenarios, the increase in reactivity due to coolant-density reduction should be minimized or
mitigated when the transient or accident occurs.

A prismatic VHTR system was chosen to evaluate these scenarios. The standard hexagonal
fuel-block consists of TRISO particle fuel (25% packing fraction, 15% enriched), a 1.27-cm-
diam. fuel channel, 108 coolant channels, and 216 fuel channels. Because of the superior heat-
transfer properties of the salt compared to those of helium, the coolant channels were reduced to
0.935 cm in diameter (7% of the block volume). The results for this study were produced from a
pin-cell calculation using the TRITON/NEWT depletion sequence with CENTRM resonance-
processing tool from SCALES. 1, with a 238-group ENDF/B-IV cross-section set. AHTR salt
coolants were analyzed with the TRITON lattice physics sequence within SCALE. A 'Li
enrichment of 99.995% was used for lithium-containing coolants (unless noted otherwise). More
detailed documentation of this model is available in a recent report [40].

Table 13 displays the coolant density coefficient (reactivity change due to coolant expansion
on heating) and the coolant void ratio (CVR), which is the change in reactivity due to a 100%
voiding scenario, for a variety of salt coolants in the AHTR design with Er,O; poison. All salts
except LiF-BeF, contribute a positive coolant density coefficient and CVR. Positive voiding or
coolant density coefficients are often characterized as “forbidden™ zones for reactors, but it is
important to look at the entire reactivity response of the core before passing judgment on the

reactor response.

It 1s necessary to consider that the AHTR is a pool-type reactor operating at near-atmospheric
pressure with a margin to boiling for the coolant of ~500°C. Thus there can be no
depressurization, which leads to a sudden loss of coolant. Off-normal conditions that result in a
decrease of coolant in the core are either caused, or accompanied by, a temperature change.
Therefore, the total temperature coefficient should also be considered in the choice of salt
coolant. A loss of forced circulation (e.g., break in a major coolant pipe) will result in an
increased coolant temperature, but note that the fuel temperature also will rise more quickly. A
sudden reactivity insertion will cause a rise in coolant temperature, but this rise will lag behind
the rapid rise in fuel temperature. Therefore, the relative magnitude and sign of the coolant
temperature plus the coolant density coefficient (or total coolant temperature coefficient) should
be considered with respect to the total noncoolant (fuel plus graphite) temperature coefficient.

Table 14 shows a group of temperature coefficients for an AHTR fuel block for conditions
with and without Er,Os poison. The total coolant temperature coefficient is far smaller than the
noncoolant negative temperature coefficient. This effect is more pronounced when erbium
poison is added to the core because a small change in temperature substantially increases the
fraction of neutrons in the 0.3 eV resonance of '*’Er.

Therefore, if the possibility of a complete voiding without a temperature change can be
removed from consideration (as 1s assumed with liquid-metal fast reactors), the significance of a
coolant density change must be considered with respect to all other temperature coefficients. For
any scenario driven by a rapid reactivity insertion, coolants that exhibit small negative
temperature coefficients do not control the system response because the total response 1s

dominated by the negative reactivity effects in the closely coupled fuel. However, for salt

“Computations conducted with 99.995 "Li

coolants with a positive total coolant temperature coefficient, a coupled neutronics/thermal-
hydraulics analysis (e.g., PARCS or NESTLE coupled with RELAP) must be performed to
understand the net reactivity effect. In this regard, it 1s useful to define a new parameter, the
coolant safety ratio, which is the ratio of the magnitude of a positive (total) coolant temperature
coefficient and the total noncoolant temperature coefficient. For instance, a coolant safety ratio
of 1.9% 1mplies that the fuel and graphite must increase only 1.9°C to offset a 100°C increase in
coolant temperature.

These safety-related parameters for the leading coolant candidates are shown in Table 15.
The design basis for the AHTR includes a two-batch core with a 1.5-year cycle and a burnup of
150 MWd/kgU. Therefore, because of differences in parasitic capture of the salt, the enrichment
levels were varied to reach these design specifications. The following parameters were varied in

our calculations in order to explore the effects on reactivity coefficients: (a) coolant volume

fraction (7%, 15%); (b) Er,O; poison level in the fuel-compact matrix (0, 5 mg/cm’); and (¢) 'Li
enrichment level (99.995, 99.9). The calculations were also performed with the simplifying
assumption that the temperature rise was uniformly distributed over all materials in the core (fuel-
coolant-moderator). This assumption is likely to cause an exaggeration of the positive reactivity
contributions arising from the salt coolant.

A careful comparison of the results in Table 15 reveals that the reactivity coefficients that
affect safety, other than CVR, depend more on the coolant fraction and poison content than the
choice of salt coolant. Therefore, each of the salt-coolant options can provide adequate protection
during a temperature transient if coupled with a properly designed fuel block. When a

coolant/fuel-block combination has a positive total coolant temperature coefficient, a coupled

38
neutronics/thermal-hydraulics assessment should be performed to determine the significance of
the positive coefficient. It is also apparent that the lithium enrichment is significant for the LiF-
BeF, coolant, but not for the LiF-NaF-ZrF, coolant; because the Zr constituent dominates neutron
capture. Therefore, to achieve the optimum neutronic performance, the LiF-NaF-ZrF, coolant

does not have to use extremely high "Li enrichment (as is typically assumed).

4.3 SHORT-TERM ACTIVATION

The parasitic neutron captures in the salt activate the coolant materials, which results 1n the
flow of additional, often radioactive, isotopes throughout the coolant circuit. Alpha and beta
radiation cannot travel through the coolant pipes without being absorbed; therefore, the activation
products of significant interest are high-energy gamma emitters. Many very short-lived activation
products (T, < 1 sec) are present but are insignificant because they will decay before traveling
out of the reactor vessel. Many of these isotopes will be filtered out of the coolant during
operation. The noble gases (helium, krypton, and most of the tritium) will come out naturally with
no removal work required. The last traces of tritium can be gas-sparged under chemically
reducing conditions. Carbon will not be in solution and can be removed. Therefore, these i1sotopes
have been removed from our analysis of activation products. Figures 16 and 17 show the
activation levels of the coolant options and their constituent components, respectively, at three
time steps after the irradiation stops (either because the coolant left the core or because the reactor
was shut down). The primary activation product in water is '°N (T, = 7 s). Along with °N, the
two 1sotopes with similar half-lives and high-energy gamma emission that are significant in
fluoride salts are *°F (T, = 11 sec) and "?O (T,, = 27 s). These two isotopes are the major
contributors in the salt with the lowest activation level (LiF-BeF,). Because there are no
intermediate-lived activation products in this salt, after a single day, the activation levels are
nearly zero, a level similar to water. However, because the 1-min activation levels are 5 orders of
magnitude larger than water (on a per-unit-mass basis), online maintenance may be restricted.

Like sodium coolant, salts with a sodium component have a significant concentration of **Na
(T2 = 15 h) when irradiated. This will impede refueling operations because the exposure levels
will still be significant after a few days of decay. Potassium is naturally radioactive, due to “’K,
but with activation, a substantial amount of **K (T,,, = 12 h) is produced (along with several other

1sotopes). This leads to very large activation levels for several days after irradiation ceases.

Coolants with a rubidium component have several significant activation products (**"Rb,
*Rb, and *°Rb) with a range of significant half-lives (1 min, 18 min, and 18 days, respectively)
and high-energy (>0.3 MeV) gamma radiation. As shown in Figures 16 and 17, the activation
level of rubidium salts due to **Rb is still significantly higher after 10 days than coolants without
rubidium. Zirconium contains an even greater number of significant activation products (°"™Nb,
’’Nb, *’Zr, ’Nb, *°Zr) with a range of half lives (1 min, 1 h, 17 h, 35 days, and 64 days), but the
activity 1s less than that of rubidium by an order of magnitude for under 10 days of post-
irradiation decay.

Based on activation factors, priority should be given to the LiF-BeF, salt; however, salts
without a rubidium or zirconium component will decay to acceptable levels after several days, so
that maintenance and refueling can be performed in close proximity to the coolant. For salts that
contain zirconium or rubidium, the activated coolant could be pumped from the core and replaced
with a clean salt for planned outages; or robotics could be used for refueling, maintenance, and

inspection.

4.4 LONG-TERM ACTIVATION

Because of unstable isotopes produced by its prolonged irradiation, disposing of the coolant
may present challenges at the end of the lifetime of the reactor. Therefore, we have also
considered the transmutation of each coolant and the significant long-lived activation products
produced. All types of radiation (alpha, beta, and gamma-ray emissions) were considered
significant for long-term disposal.

Tables 16 and 17 show the activity levels of the coolant salts after 1 or 10 years of cooling
following a 60-year exposure. To simplify the table, the activities are nominal values (£50%) for
the indicated salt constituents irrespective of the specific coolant salt composition. For example,
all candidate salts that contain beryllium were found to have a 1-year activity of

1.5-2.5 x 107 Ci/g. As shown in Table 16, the activity of each coolant component is below

300 pCi per gram of coolant, and two orders of magnitude less for non-zirconium-containing
salts. After 10 years of cooling (Table 17), these levels are reduced to the very long-lived
isotopes, with *’K (the naturally occurring isotope) being the only high-energy gamma emitter.
The highest activity is from *°Cl, produced by the (n,ar) reaction with *’K. Therefore, after a
modest cooling period, the handling of all non-potassium salts should be relatively acceptable
with minimal shielding. Sodium-22 has a very small activity (2 nCi/g) after 10 years and a
comparably short half-life (3 years). Therefore, sodium, like lithium, does not pose a long-term

risk for waste disposal.

Three of the isotopes listed in Table 17 (‘’Be, *°Cl, ™Nb) are not specifically addressed in
the 10 CFR 61 regulations for control of low-level waste [41]. Chlorine-36 occurs in relatively
high concentrations in potassium salts and has a high ingestion dose conversion factor and a high
environmental mobility. Therefore, it poses a potential risk for long-term migration from a low-
level waste (LLW) disposal facility, especially in a contaminated well/drinking water exposure
scenario, which must be analyzed for the licensing of a LLW facility. However, *°Cl can be easily
separated from the salt and disposed of separately. Beryllium-10 is a long-lived beta emitter with
unknown environmental mobility properties. The parent to *"Nb is **Zr, which is very long-lived
(1.5 million years) and cannot be easily removed from the constituent salt. Although *™Nb poses
the greatest long-term disposal risk of the salts considered, its activity level after 60 years of use

in an AHTR appears to be sufficiently low to qualify as LLW.

5. COST OF THE SALT

There are many important economic factors to be considered with respect to selecting
coolant; however, at this stage of the AHTR design, it 1s most useful to focus on the cost of
acquiring the salt coolant. The most important “salt cost” is that associated with a significant
deployment of the AHTR. Unfortunately, we cannot predict this cost because many of the
constituents of candidate salts are not commodity chemicals, and the cost associated with
deploying significant numbers of AHTRs would swamp the existing markets and change the price
that 1s offered.

However, there are some basic trends and facts that can be used to help understand the
classification and costs of various salt constituents. In 1971, ORNL conducted a survey of
potential coolants that could be used as the secondary coolant in the MSBR design [5]. In the
context of this survey, solicitations were made to vendors to provide prices for candidate salts.
The goal was to establish an estimate of the unit prices required for supplying the coolant
inventory (~280,000 liters) for a 1000-MWe MSBR plant. Some vendors could not supply
estimates for an order this large, and extrapolation methods were employed to refine the estimates
when possible. The results of these 1971 price estimates are shown in Table 18. A more recent
survey of commodity [42] pricing for relevant salt constituents is included as Table 19.

Based on the 1971 study and the more recent commodity values, it is evident that the
constituents of candidate coolants fall into three categories: (a) relatively inexpensive commodity

chemicals (NaF); (b) moderately expensive specialty materials produced on a large scale (Zr-

metal, LiF); and (c) very expensive specialty materials ('LiF, Be). For the 1971 study, the price
of 99.995% "Li was assumed to be $120/kg-LiF. Some of the values for Zr-prices in
Tables 18 and 19 do not reflect the cost associated with hafnium removal.

It 1s possible that this classification could change for some constituents based on market
factors not yet considered. For example, there are two alternative raw material sources for
obtaining hafnium-free ZrF,: (a) recovery of irradiated cladding and fuel-element hardware, and
(b) recovery of ZrF, from spent pickling-solution streams (from hafnium cleaning of Zircalloy). It
1s also possible that the market could change the specialty prices associated with RbF and KF
compounds. Alkali ores possess considerable amounts of Rb and K minerals that remain unused
and accumulate 1n tailing piles. Rubidium has an unusual position with respect to markets.
While the world market for rubidium is extremely small (4 tons/year), it ranks as the 23™ most
abundant element on earth (16™ most abundant metal)—more abundant than copper, lead, and

zinc; and much more abundant than lithium or cesium.

6. CHEMICAL CONSIDERATIONS

6.1 BACKGROUND, CONTEXT, AND PURPOSE

The purpose of this section is to provide an assessment of key chemical factors related to the
choice of the primary coolant for the AHTR. The most important chemical factor in this selection
concerns the maintenance of acceptably small levels of corrosion for the metal alloy that will
serve as primary containment. Alloy corrosion is the key materials-compatibility issue that is
influenced by salt chemistry. Section 2 contains a review of candidate AHTR coolants and their
properties, and Table 2 lists potential candidate salts. The review of coolant properties represents
an update, a correction, and an extension of the previous summaries conducted many decades ago
[10, 43].

The application of molten salt coolants is based on a 50-year history of molten salt nuclear
technology, principally at ORNL. To appreciate the merits of using such high-temperature
liquids as coolants in AHTRs, it is worthwhile to review some of that history as it pertains to
AHTR applications. Although many more-extensive reviews of molten salt reactors exist, these
might be too expansive in scope for those interested only in specific topics such as those
concerning AHTR technology. Therefore, this overview will focus on key aspects in the

development of these unique high-temperature fluids as they pertain to AHTRs. This report will

45
then focus in detail on these key elements that will lead to consideration of molten salt coolants
for further development.

The use of molten salts in nuclear reactors has been an evolutionary process that included the
parallel development of containment materials, physics, engineering, etc. Necessarily, this broad
effort required the commitment of a large number of scientists and engineers over at least three
decades. It 1s worth emphasizing that the use of molten salts was not originally envisioned but

instead appeared as part of the evolutionary process to meet design requirements.

In the 1950s, a nuclear-powered strategic bomber was conceived that could stay aloft for

more that a month and be diverted to a target should the necessity arise in this era of the Cold
War. To power such an aircraft, a test reactor—the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE)—was
constructed [44]. A major requirement for this reactor was that it have a very high power density
to keep the weight in the aircraft at a minimum. Originally, a more conventional design of solid
fuel pins with liquid metal (sodium) was planned. However, the need for the high power density
and safety could not be met with solid fuel, which might be inadequately cooled in such a design.
Therefore, it was decided to develop a liquid fuel that could operate at a high power density
and that was inherently safe because of a negative power coefficient. In other words, if the
reactor power went up excessively, the thermal expansion of the fluid fuel would cause a natural
lowering of the amount of fuel in the core and thus decrease the overall reactor power. A search

then began for a high-temperature fluid that would satisfy the following requirements [4]:

Consist of elements of low-neutron-capture cross-section.

Dissolve more than the critical concentration of fissionable material at

temperatures safely below the temperature at which the fuel leaves the

heat exchanger.

3. Be thermally stable with low vapor pressure over the operating
temperature range.

4. Possess heat transfer and hydrodynamic properties adequate for its service
as a heat-exchange fluid.

5. Be relatively nonaggressive toward some otherwise suitable material of
construction, presumably a metal, and toward some moderator material.

6. Be stable toward reactor radiation and be able to survive fission of the
uranium or other fissionable material. Must tolerate fission-product
accumulation without serious deterioration of its useful properties.

7. Be relatively inexpensive and capable of an economical reprocessing

scheme.

Various inorganic compounds such as halides, nitrates, hydroxides, and carbonates were
considered, and many of these were tested in the laboratory, primarily for corrosive action on
potential container materials. Of these many classes of inorganic compounds, fluorides were
deemed much more suitable for reasons that include improved neutron economy, better
moderating efficiency, higher chemical stability, lower vapor pressure, higher specific heat, and
usefulness of the element without isotope separation [45].

For the ARE, a mixture of NaF and ZrF, was used as the fluoride solvent [46] for the UF,
fuel component to make a solution of NaF-ZrF,-UF,(53.09-40.73-6.18 mol %). The containment
metal used for this liquid fuel mixture was a nickel-base alloy, Inconel, (15% Cr, 7% Fe,
balance Ni1.) [47]. Although it was initially planned to use a sodium-cooled, solid-fuel-element
reactor, the reactor design evolved first to that of a sodium-cooled, stationary-liquid-fuel reactor
and finally to that of a circulating-fuel reactor employing sodium as a coolant for the reflector
[46]. The ARE operated in November 1954 for 221 h at a maximum thermal power of 2.5 MW.

Postoperative examination of the reactor components [48] plus experimental corrosion-loop
testing revealed that Inconel corrosion was excessive for long-term operation but could be
improved by adding molybdenum to the alloy. Furthermore, corrosion loops indicated that
Inconel was more severely corroded with fuel salts made with all alkali-metal fluorides than those
made with NaF-ZrF, mixtures, suggesting that the chemical composition of the fuel salt played a
significant role in controlling the corrosion chemistry. Extensive development in materials
research [49-53] resulted in the production of an improved nickel-base alloy, INOR-8 (17% Mo,
7% Cr, 5% Fe, balance Ni).

The period following the successful operation of the ARE evolved to the design and
prototype construction of an Aircraft Reactor Test (ART). The work progressed with further
development and testing until the Atomic Energy Commission terminated the ANP project in
1957 [54]. This novel molten salt technology was then turned to civilian interests in the

development of molten salt breeder reactors with the design and construction of the MSRE.

6.1.2 Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
The MSRE represented the first step in developing a breeder reactor. To this end, 1t was

necessary that the molten solvent components consist of elements with especially low thermal
neutron cross-sections in order to achieve the highest possible breeding ratio in the breeder
reactor prototype [55]. The MSRE was planned to test the combination of new components and
the overall reactor design—without including the breeding stage.

It was constructed of INOR-8 (now 1dentified as Hastelloy N) for improved corrosion

resistance and fueled with LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, (64-30-5-1 mol %). The LiF component was

47
enriched Li-7 for better neutron economy. Neutron moderator graphite filled the reactor core in
the shape of rectangular stringers that provided channels for the circulating fuel. The fuel was
circulated from the reactor core at 650°C to a heat exchanger operating at 550°C.

Corrosion in the reactor circuit was controlled by reducing approximately 1% of the UF,
solute to UF3, so that the oxidative equilibrium between the chromium of the Hastelloy N

container was shifted to the left:

Cr + 2UF4 > CI'Fz + 2UF3 (12)

Postoperative examination of the reactor container showed that corrosion was successfully
minimized by this redox method of control. It was observed that the fuel salt produced only very
minor, barely detectable levels of corrosion, whereas for the coolant salt, the corrosion was not
detected at all [56].

Further postoperative examination showed that fission-product tellurium diffused into the
Hastelloy N grain boundaries and caused an unacceptable stress-cracking embrittlement of the
metal. Radiation hardening of the Hastelloy N and diffusion of trittum (produced by the action of
the neutrons on the lithium component of the solvent) were also of concern for future reactor

applications.

6.1.3 Molten Salt Breeder Reactor
In 1972, following the success of the MSRE operations and encouraging R&D solutions to

the postoperative findings, the next step in development was to move toward a breeder reactor
[57]. However, competition with the broad Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR)
program curtailed further extensive progress. Nevertheless, significant developments in two
areas of interest are worthy of recognition: materials and fuel salt chemistry.

This historical overview covering the development of molten salt technology over several
decades should demonstrate how various aspects evolved. The selection of an appropriate molten
salt medium and the effects on the container material (corrosion) are the two subjects of focus in
this report. They will be discussed separately with recommendations, as appropriate, for

application to coolant technology.

6.2 MATERIALS FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE FLUIDS

Inconel was originally found to be superior to non-nickel-base alloys and therefore used in
the ARE. However, the extent of corrosion was still excessive for prolonged reactor operations.

As aresult, an alloy development program was initiated based on the encouraging results found

48
with Inconel [52]. Studies were started [63] on the Ni-Mo system, which exhibited excellent
corrosion properties both from the standpoint of measurements of equilibrium solubilities on
various metals in salt mixtures and on the basis of tests that were made with the commercial alloy
Hastelloy B (composition: 29% Mo, 5% Fe, balance Ni). Corrosion rates for this alloy were
found to be quite low at temperatures in excess of 900°C and very much lower than those for
Inconel under comparable conditions. However, Hastelloy B suffered from several adverse
characteristics. Poor fabricability and embrittlement after operation between 650°C and 815°C,
coupled with poor oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, disqualified Hastelloy B despite
its excellent corrosion resistance.

In developing an improved nickel-base alloy containing chromium for long-term salt service
it was found that a significant change in the oxidation rate* occurs at about 6% Cr. At this
composition, the oxide changes from the NiMoO, type to one that is predominantly the Cr,O3
type [58]. Since a high chromium content is undesirable from the standpoint of fused fluoride
corrosion, only a slight excess of chromium is desired for the proposed alloy. Molybdenum,
which strengthens nickel alloys, was reduced in amount to the point that a solid solution of nickel
and molybdenum would be stable at all temperatures of interest.

On the basis of extensive testing, an alloy designated as INOR-8 (now identified as
Hastelloy N with composition 17% Mo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe, balance Ni) was selected as the most
promising container material for fused fluorides. Interestingly, the iron content was included so
that the chromium could be added as ferrochromium rather than pure chromium with the resulting
decrease in costs. This alloy served the operation of the MSRE 1n an excellent fashion, and it was
only after reactor operations that some deficiencies were observed.

As stated in Sect. 6.1.2, postoperative examination of the MSRE revealed the damaging
effects of fission-product tellurium, resulting in the development and testing of modified alloys
for future containment purposes. It was found that additions of titanium or niobium produced a
modified Hastelloy N alloy that had good resistance to both radiation embrittlement and
intergranular cracking by tellurium [59,60]. Furthermore, it was seen that controlling the molten
salt oxidation potential had dramatic effects on the extent of cracking [61] as shown in Figure 18.
This technique of salt chemistry control by redox changes was performed during the operation of
the MSRE and known even before then as a technique for preventing corrosion of all metal
alloys, 1s clearly one of the best means of corrosion control. Consideration of redox control is an

integral and important factor for salt selection for AHTR service and for the system design.

6.3 CHEMISTRY OF MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALT COOLANTS

The selection and effective use of molten salts as high-temperature coolants depends on an
understanding of the chemistry. Of major importance in this understanding are:
(1) the ability to produce and maintain a high level of purity, (2) phase diagram behavior for
mixtures, (3) the utilization of acid-base effects, and (4) the control of the redox potential of the

salt medium as it affects corrosion and other chemical processes.

6.3.1 Salt Purification

Molten salt use typically begins with the acquisition of raw components that are combined to
produce a mixture that has the desired properties when melted. However, most suppliers of
halide salts do not provide materials that can be used directly. The major impurities that must be
removed are moisture/oxide contaminants, to prevent severe corrosion of the container metal.

Once removed, these salts must be kept from atmospheric contamination by handling and storage

50
in sealed containers. During the ANP/MSRE era, a considerable effort was devoted to salt
purification by HF/H, sparging of the molten salt and 1s described in numerous reports [45, 52,
62—64]. Besides removing moisture/oxide impurities, the purification also removes other halide
contaminants, such as chloride and sulfur. The sulfur is usually present in the form of sulfate and
1s reduced to sulfide 1on, which is swept out as H,S in the sparging operation. Methods were also
developed to ensure the purity of the reagents used to purify the salts and to clean the container
surfaces used for corrosion testing.

Another means of purification that can be performed after sparging involves simply reducing
the salt with a constituent active metal such as an alkali metal, beryllium, or zirconium. While
such active metals will remove oxidizing impurities such as HF, moisture, or hydroxide, they will
not affect the other halide contaminants that affect sulfur removal. Therefore, it seems inevitable
that the HF/H, sparging operation, either by itself or followed by a reducing (active metal)
treatment, will be a necessity.

Although a great deal of effort can be devoted to purifying the molten salt mixture in the
manner described above, it is primarily useful in producing materials for research purposes
without the possibility of interference from extraneous impurities. In the final application of
molten salts, one can envision that a less strenuous and less expensive purification treatment

might suffice for high-temperature-coolant purposes.

6.3.2 Phase-Diagram Behavior
Salt components by themselves often have melting points and/or other properties that

preclude their use. For example, the alkali fluorides individually have melting points in excess of
800°C, which make them difficult to use alone as a liquid medium. However, the combination of
two or more of these component salts can produce low-melting mixtures that satisfy the melting
point requirements of a system. Furthermore, some properties of individual components, such as
viscosity (for pure BeF,) or vapor pressure (for pure ZrF,), are reduced along with the resulting
melting point by combination with other salt components. For these reasons, a large effort had
been devoted to the study of phase diagrams for various mixtures of fluoride salts.

While many combinations are documented in various references [6—7] it 1s conceivable that
the phase diagram of some salt mixture for high-temperature-coolant applications has not been

determined. Particular salt systems are discussed in Sect. 2.

6.3.3 Acid-Base Chemistry
A less obvious but equally important chemical aspect is that of the molten-salt acid-base

chemistry. To put it in proper perspective, one should realize that an aqueous chemical process

51
could never be developed without controlling of the acid-base properties of the solution, because
most chemical processes simply do not work well otherwise. Similarly, this control can be
essential in molten salt chemistry. The major obstacle in understanding the acidity effect 1s in
comprehending the nature of this Lewis acid-base property, in which an acid is defined as an
electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. For molten fluorides, ZrF,, UF,, and
BeF, would be examples of Lewis acids. These acids would interact with a Lewis base, F-, in the

following fashion:

ZrF, + 2F — ZrFg (13)

Salts that easily give up their fluoride ions—the alkali metal fluorides—interact with the
acidic salts that accept them to form complexes as shown in Eq.13. The effect of such
complexation 1s a stabilization of the acidic component and a decrease in the chemical
(thermodynamic) activity. Although these concepts were realized in the early developmental
stages of molten salt chemistry, a more macroscopic (thermodynamic) view of solvent changes
was taken and resulted in the laborious measurement of activity coefficients for individual
components 1n specific salt mixtures. A classic presentation [65] of activity coefficients for
numerous fluoride salts (Fig. 19) as a function of increasing LiF content (1.e., increasing basicity)
in the LiF-BeF, mixtures formed the basis for much of the understanding of that time. It was
invaluable for predictions of equilibrium concentrations of reactive components in these
solutions. Prior to that, there were such suggestive observations [55] that corrosion of Inconel
was much worse with the ternary alkali metal fluoride eutectic (a basic salt solution) than with
NaF-ZrF, (an acidic salt solution) containing UF,. We now explain this as being due to an
increase in the stability of the corrosion product by complexation with the higher activity of the
fluoride 10ns 1n the basic salt mixture. Such acid-base properties are also seen in the viscosity
decrease of acidic BeF, (viscous because of cross-linking through a Be-F-Be bridging network)
with additions of the basic component F™ to form monomeric BeF, ions of normal solution

viscosity (~1-10 cP):

Ber + 2F — BGF4= (14)

Acid-base effects are also seen in vapor-pressure changes of volatile ZrF, to form the nonvolatile
Z1F¢ ion:

53
Today, the understanding of the more microscopic coordination chemistry of these systems
through the use of various spectroscopies that can identify the coordination behavior of the ions
enables a prediction of these chemical equilibrium shifts, at least on a qualitative scale. Acid-
base chemistry then becomes an essential factor in the selection of constituents for high-

temperature coolants.

6.3.4 Corrosion Chemistry
Corrosion has long been a major problem in the use of metals and is a major concern in using

such materials for containment purposes. Consequently, years of study have been devoted to
corrosion chemistry in various media, but especially in aqueous solutions. Indeed, this same
concern has prevailed for metallic containment of molten salts and was actively pursued
throughout the years of development.

Unlike the more conventional oxidizing media, the products of oxidation of metals by
fluoride melts tend to be completely soluble in the corroding media [58]; hence, passivation is
precluded and corrosion depends directly on the thermodynamic driving force of the corrosion
reactions [50]. Design of a chemically stable system utilizing molten fluoride salts, therefore,
demands the selection of salt constituents that are not appreciably reduced by available structural
metals and the development of containers whose components are in near thermodynamic
equilibrium with the salt medium.

Examination of the free energies of formation for the various alloy components in Inconel or
Hastelloy N shows that chromium is the most active of the metal components. Therefore, any
oxidative attachment to these nickel-base alloys should be expected to show selective attack on
the chromium. Such oxidation and selective attack follow from reactions such as the following

(in Eqgs. 16—-19) [4] for the fuel salt:

Impurities in the melt with dissolution of the CrF,

Cr + NIF2 — CI'Fz + Ni (16)
Cr + 2HF — Cer + H2 (17)

Oxide films on the metal

2NiIO + ZI'F4 — 2NIF2 + ZI'Oz (18)

54
These reactions are followed by reaction of NiF, with Cr:
Reduction of UF, to UF;
Cr + 2UF4 > 2UF3 + CI'Fz (19)

Of course, in the case of a coolant salt with no fuel component, reaction (19) would not be a
factor.

Redox processes responsible for attack by molten fluoride mixtures on these alloys result in
selective oxidation of the contained chromium. This removal of chromium from the alloy occurs
primarily in regions of highest temperature and results in the formation of discrete voids in the
alloy [66]. These voids are not, in general, confined to the grain boundaries in the metal but are
relatively uniformly distributed throughout the alloy surface in contact with the melt. The rate of
corrosion has been measured and was found to be controlled by the rate at which chromium

diffuses to the surfaces undergoing attack [52].

6.4 COOLANT SALT SELECTION FACTORS RELATED TO CORROSION

From the list of potential coolant salts, none are intrinsically corrosive to the metal alloy
components. This view is based on the thermodynamic stability of the fluoride components
relative to those of the alloy metal and is described in depth by Grimes [4] and summarized here
in Sect. 6.3.4, Corrosion Chemistry. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated over the past several
decades 1n systems operating up to 850°C.

Nevertheless, the evidence for selecting a coolant based on corrosion is not adequate at
present. Previous studies focused on the corrosion by salts containing uranium, in which uranium
1s the key factor in the intensity and nature of alloy corrosion [cf., Eq. (19)]. A good
understanding of fuel-salt corrosion was developed, but we do not know the precise mechanism
of persistent (i.e., mass-transfer) corrosion of nickel alloys with coolant salts. We must assume
that redox-sensitive species, such as Cr(II/III) and Fe(II/IIT), are important factors in this process
[51, 67]. However, with limited analytical resources, other factors apparently present in previous

studies must be evaluated to identify all truly significant trends.

6.4.1 Oxidation State of Corrosion Products [68]
During the ANP program, a continuing effort was made to understand the oxidation state of

corrosion products such as Cr, Fe, and Ni in different salts. Although these studies were crude by
today's standards, the basic trends of oxidation state stability, shown in Table 20, were apparent

and helped explain the corrosion phenomena that were being observed in fuel salts.

55
Table 20. Predominant oxidation states of dissolved alloy
constituents in various molten salts

 

FLiNaK Cr(111) Fe(11/111) Ni(Il)
NaF/ZtF, Cr(1l) Fe(Il) Ni(ID)
2LiF/BeF, Cr(1l) Fe(Il) Ni(II)

 

It 1s apparent that FLiNaK has a distinct behavior. As a strongly basic solvent, it would tend
to stabilize the M(III) oxidation state and could provide for a stronger corrosion driving force due

to the variation between cation [Cr(II/III), Fe(II/III)] oxidation states with temperature.

6.4.2 Temperature Dependence of Dissolved Chromium Concentration [69—71]
The equilibrium level of dissolved chromium has been measured for fuel salts, but not for

coolant salts. Although the information on fuel salts is not directly applicable to coolants, we
expect that fuel systems that experience minimal corrosion would also be better coolants. Review
of the dissolved chromium levels for various fuel salts in Table 21 again reveals that FLL.iNaK
stands somewhat apart from the other salts as supporting a higher degree of corrosion. It also
appears that there i1s some benefit in avoiding a very acid (high-ZrF, or BeF,-content) system and
that a salt mixture that has a nearly complete coordination shell (2:1 ratio of alkali halide to Zr or
Be and heavier alkali salt) has the least potential for supporting corrosion based on the
temperature sensitivities shown in Table 21.

This approach is a significant oversimplification, as the identity of the various species is very
important. For example, the saturating species that contain chromium is different for each of these

salts. However, for a first approximation, Table 21 provides a useful guide.

6.4.3 Polythermal Corrosion Test Loops with Coolant Salts
Although less than 10% of all corrosion testing was done with salts that were free of uranium,

this small fraction amounts to a significant body of work because of the extensive test program
that was carried out. The results of testing for uranium-free salts are summarized in Table A.1 in

the appendix.

56
Table 21. Equilibrium level of dissolved metals for
pure elements in contact with various fuel salts

A quick inspection of this table reveals that Hastelloy N (INOR-8), just as it 1s for fuel salts,
1s a superior choice (rather than Inconel or SS) for coolant salts. The corrosion is so intense and
the duration so short for most Inconel loops that it is hard to make a judgment about which salt
supports the least corrosion. It is clear that FLiNaK is certainly among the worst. For INOR-8
loops, the corrosion is so minor that it is hard to sort out corrosion effects due to the salt’s
composition. Some additional Inconel loop tests [72—73] were conducted with special fuel salt
mixtures in which the ZrF, and BeF, concentrations were varied in an attempt to select the best
composition. However, these tests were somewhat inconclusive because of the short test duration
(500 h) and the impurity effects. Within the resolution of these tests, the trends indicated in
Table 21 were verified: very basic (FLiNaK) and very acidic (LiF-ZrF,) salts showed the worst
performance. Nevertheless, the proper control of redox factors, as described in Sect 6.4.4, can

make even these salt mixtures acceptable with respect to corrosion.

6.4.4 Redox Control Factors
At various periods at ORNL, the control of the oxidation-reduction state of the salt was

explored as a means to minimize corrosion. During the ANP period, this approach was found to
be somewhat effective. However, it was not practical, because strong reductants either reduced
zirconium or uranium in the salt to a metal that plated on the alloy wall or resulted in some other
undesirable phase segregation. During the MSRE operation, periodic adjustment of the
U(II)/U(IV) ratio was effective in limiting the corrosion in the fuel circuit. Keiser also explored
the possibility of using metallic beryllium to reduce corrosion in stainless steel containing a
LiF-BeF; salt [74]. This treatment was effective only as long as the solid beryllium was

immersed in the salt. There was little, if any, buffering capacity in this salt to maintain the

57
reducing environment throughout the melt. Del Cul et al. have identified and tested candidate
agents that could be used as redox buffers to maintain a reducing environment in the coolant
circuit [75].

None of these redox-control strategies have been developed to the extent that we can rely on
them for a definite salt selection. However, we can make some useful observations in this regard.
For a lower-temperature system (<750°C), it appears that Hastelloy N is fully capable of serving
as a containment alloy without the need for a sophisticated redox strategy. Even an alkali
fluoride such as FLiNaK could be suitable.

For temperatures in excess of 750°C and for alloys that will contain more chromium (as most
higher-temperature alloys do), it appears that a reducing salt will be needed to minimize
corrosion. Inconel without the benefit of a reducing environment was found to be unsuitable for
long-term use. Only a mildly reducing environment is possible with a ZrF,-containing salt since
a strongly reducing redox potential would reduce ZrF,, itself. Much more reducing systems can
be devised with either FLiNaK or BeF; salts. Some very important material compatibility issues
will have to be explored in order to use a highly reducing salt at these higher temperatures,
because events such as carbide formation and carburization/ decarburization of the alloy (not
discussed in the report) become a significant threat.

Should low-chromium/chromium-free alloys or suitable clad systems be devised as a
container, then these problems with salt selection will largely disappear. However, in the absence
of this solution, it appears that there are two strategies: (1) select a salt that should support the
minimum level of corrosion in the absence of a highly reducing environment (some ZrF, salts,
BeF, salts) or (2) select a salt with a large redox window that can be maintained in a highly
reducing state (FLiNaK, BeF, salts). Given the expense and difficulty of doing development work
with beryllium-containing salts, it seems logical to explore the most promising ZrF, salts without

strong reductants and to explore FLiNaK with strong reductants and/or redox buffers.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1 CONCLUSIONS

Based on the preceding review of nuclear, physical, chemical, and economic properties of
candidate salts for the AHTR, the following conclusions were reached:

Salts composed of low-atomic-weight constituents (“light” salts) possess superior heat-
transfer metrics for use as the AHTR coolant. Heavier salts are also relatively good coolants and

would likely prove acceptable for design purposes.

58
Analysis indicates that the key reactivity coefficients (and their net effect) that control
response to transients are more strongly affected by parameters associated with the fuel-block
design (coolant volume fraction, poison level, and distribution) than by the identity of the
particular salts under consideration. A computational framework was developed to evaluate these
factors and was used to evaluate the various candidate salts. It appears that acceptable fuel-
element designs can be found for most of the salts used in this study.

Activation levels in AHTR candidate coolants appear to be acceptable from both an
operational and long-term disposal standpoint. Only the LiF-BeF,; salts are very low-activation
materials that support minimal shielding requirements. The other salt coolants have operational
characteristics similar to those of sodium-cooled reactors. The disposal of all of the salt
candidates as LLW after 60 years of operation and 10 years of cooling should be possible,
although some simple pre-treatment may be required for certain coolants.

No consensus exists to select a particular salt based on its corrosion behavior with high-
temperature alloys.

A number of the ZrF,-containing salts appear to offer the best potential for achieving a low-
cost coolant. The economic basis for these judgments is very important for the selection of a

candidate and needs to be refined.

7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS

The selection of a suitable coolant salt should be based on numerous factors, including
chemical, physical, nuclear, metallurgical, and economic factors. It 1s evident from past decades
of experience that fluoride melts have an established advantage over the few other coolants that
had been considered previously for extreme-temperature service (>700°C). The following
remarks are directed primarily toward selection based on chemical factors that relate to corrosion,
with the understanding that the overall assessment will need to account for other factors.

Proper selection of a coolant salt based on chemical differences is based largely on the acid-
base properties of the combination, as described in Sect. 6. Both predictions and measurement of
the container-metal-fluoride equilibrium concentrations are higher in basic salts as compared with
neutral or acidic media. Some corrosion loop experience tends to corroborate this observation.
Unfortunately, however, no systematic study of such a phenomenon has been made during these
experiments.

A neutral or slightly acidic salt melt would be predicted to be the most advantageous with
respect to corrosion behavior. However, basic salt melts tend to have significantly lower vapor

pressures and lower viscosities, and these properties might present a problem (for example, ZrF4

59
and BeF,). Therefore, any selection of a coolant based on chemical considerations must,
necessarily, be a compromise of all factors that might affect performance.

In this regard, it 1s recommended that two types of salts should be studied in the future:

(1) Salts that have been shown in the past to support the least corrosion and are neither strong
Lewis acids nor strong Lewis bases (i.e., “neutral”). Salts containing BeF, and ZrF, in
the concentration range 25-40 mol % fall into this category.

(2) Salts that provide the opportunity for controlling corrosion by establishing a very
reducing salt environment. The alkali-fluoride (FLiNaK, FLiNaRb) salts and the BeF,-
containing salts fall into this category.

It 1s too early to make final recommendations for exact salt compositions, since the particular
salt composition to be chosen will need to be determined from a carefully conducted trade study

that balances the various selection factors for a particular reactor design.

7.3 CANDIDATE SALTS

Separate recommendations are made for work in the future with respect to (a) analysis and
computations, and (b) experimental work. These recommendations do not constitute a final
selection, rather they identify important candidate salts that exhibit important properties that

should establish useful boundaries for future evaluations.

Further computational analysis of AHTR candidate salts is recommended on the following basis:
1. ZrF,-salts that have the potential for low cost and special properties:

- NaF-ZrF,and related ternary mixtures :
1. NaF-ZrF, (59.5-40.5) potentially least expensive
ii. 'LiF-NaF-ZrF, (42-29-29) very low vapor pressure
1. RbF-NaF-ZrF, (34.5-24-41.5) low melting point (420°C)

2. BeF,-salts that have superior nuclear properties and heat-transfer performance:

- NaF-BeF, low melting point salt (340°C)
- 'LiF-BeF, neutron transparent salt, very low activation
All alkali fluoride compositions require significant amounts of 'Li, and the mixtures with the
most favorable heat-transfer properties (FLiNaK)) have the poorest neutronic performance. The
BeF, and ZrF, salt systems both have compositions that melt below 400°C and do not contain

lithium, whereas the alkali fluorides do not.

60
Further experimental work is recommended with the following salts:

1. NaF-ZrF4and related ternary mixtures :

1. NaF-ZrF4(59.5-40.5) potentially least expensive
ii. "LiF-NaF-ZrF, (42-29-29) very low vapor pressure
111. RbF-NaF-ZrF, (34.5-24-41.5) lowest melting point

2. Alkali fluoride salts (e.g., FLiNaK) as a reference salt. These salts will establish the
bounding corrosion response, and permit corrosion studies under a wide range of redox
conditions.

The corrosion and properties database for BeF, salts is rather extensive. BeF, salts are
expensive, and they impose significant costs in conducting tests. It is likely that much of the
information needed for work at temperatures above 750°C can be gathered initially with other
inexpensive and less hazardous salts. This leaves the option open for a future selection of BeF,

salts, should that option prove to be the best one.

7.4 FUTURE WORK

The database for salt thermal conductivity and heat capacity needs significant improvement.
In particular, the properties database for ZrF,-salts is in question and merits further investigation.

An integrated materials design and testing strategy will be required to make the optimal
choice of salt based on corrosion metrics. It is recommended that the salt-chemistry, corrosion-
chemistry, and alloy-selection studies be conducted as a joint effort.

Although there remain a number of technical i1ssues with respect to molten salt coolants, a
better understanding of economic factors for the production of industrial-scale quantities of these
materials 1s even more urgent. It is recommended that a study be done to place the cost of salts for
an industrial deployment on a sound footing. At present, only NaF can truly be considered a

commodity chemical for the production of salt.
