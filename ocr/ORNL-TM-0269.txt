JRlb&T Calculatlans

For the purpoae of this study a rather simyle conflgnratlon of . reactar,
heat ewchanger, and plplng was chosen as shown in. Flg. I. . All calculatxens
were done on the baszs of one heat exchanger and one set of rlsers and &awnu,
-cmmers. ance the frictzonal losses in tha pmplng are determined prlmarlly
| the 5 ngle r;ser can.be replaceﬂ by a: number of rlsers hav1ng the same height

'and total crass sectzona. leewlse, the heat exchanger can be replaaed by a

tubes .
The - fmllawmng expression was derlved fOr the helght cf the riser (see

Biscusaion

On the basis of this prellmlnary 1nvest1gation, 1arge natural convec-
tlmn reactors 4o not seem to be vEry attractlve._ The elmmination‘af fue&
pumps seems to be more than balanced by the increase in.fuel‘valume, and

number of haat exchanger tubes alﬁhdugh it is possible that the 1arge ﬁumher

of heat exehanger tubes can be reduced by using fuel outside of fiwned tubes.
