FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of: the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at
OBNL records the technical progress of the research on the circulating-fuel
reactor and all other ANP research at the laboratory under its Contract W-7405-
eng-26. The report is divided into four parts: I. Reactor Theory and Design;
1T, Shielding Research; III. Materials Research; and IV, Appendixes. Each part
has a separate Summary and Introduction.

The Aircraft Nuclear Propulslon Project is comprised of some 300 technlcal
and scientific personnel engaged in many phases of research directed toward the
nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A considerable portion of this research 1is
performed in support of other organizations participating in the national ANP
effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is directed toward the
development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The nucleus of the effort on circulating-fuel reactors is now centered upon
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment - a 3-megawatt high-temperature prototype of a
circulating-fuel reactor for the propulsion of aircraft. The current status of
the ARE is summarized in section 1; however, much supporting research and
developmental information on materials and problems peculiar to the ARE will be
found in other sections of Part I and Part III of this report, in addition to
the general design andmaterials research contained therein. Shielding Research,
Part 11, is devoted almost entirely to the problems of aircraft shielding.
 
SUMMARY AND

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(sec. 1) is now well into the transi-
tion period between design andreality.
The design is essentially complete,
almost all the components are onorder,
and a substantial number of these
have been received and installed in
the ARE Building. The significant
modifications during the past quarter
include completion of the off-gas
system design (incorporating holdup
tanks rather than charcoal adsorbers)
and the inclusion of a reactor by-pass
(so that the fluid circuits may be
checked out independently of the
reactor). Coincident with the com-
pletion of the reactor design, the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment Hazards
Summary Report, ORNL-1407, was sub-
mitted to the AEC for approval. It
is anticipated that even though the
experiment may be completely assembled
by the summer of 1953, a significant
and indeterminant period will be re-
quired for shake-down operation before
the reactor becomes critical. |

Valves, pumps, instrumentation,
and other components of both the
fluoride fuel (NaF-ZrF,-UF,, 50-46-4
mole %) and reflector coolant (NaK)
circuits are being developed for the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (sec. 2).
In most instances, these components
have been tested on smaller than full-
scale prototypes of the actual ARE
components. Tests are now under way;
however, on the full-scale pumps,
valves, and some instrumentation
designed for the reactor experiment.
At this time, centrifugal pumps with
both gas seals and frozen seals have
operated satisfactorily for extended
periods at temperatures between 1200
and 1500°F. A combination packed and
frozen seal has been specified for
the ARE pump. Although a bellows type
of seal has been specified for the
ARE, a considerable program has been
undertaken on high-temperature, self-
lubricating seals.

INTRODUCTION

The rotameter type of flowmeter
and the modified Moore Nullmatic
pressure transmitter have both operated
satisfactorily at high temperatures
(~1400°F). Neither of these instru-
ments is affected by the ZrF, vapor
above the fuel. Vapor traps of the
type that will be required in the gas
system above the fuel surge tanks have
been satisfactorily developed.

The heat transfer coefficient of
an aircraft type of sodium-to-air
radiator, in which the radiator fins
were sectioned every 2 in. 1in the
direction of air flow, was increased
20% over that of the same radiator
with plain flat fins. :

The general design studies (sec. 3)
were confined to performance analysis
of a Sapphire turbojet engine in which
the engine radiator performance was
extrapolated from a sodium-to-air
radiator section tested at ORNL.
Performance data for both the radiator
and engine are presented. Arrange-
ments have been completed with the
Wright Air Development Center for
their participation in the development
of high-temperature liquid-to-air
airvecraft radiators.

The several reactor physics studles
(sec. 4) include those of oscillations
in a circulating fuel reactor, a
technique for reactor calculations,
and the temperature-dependence of a
cross section exhibiting a resonance.
The damping influence of fuel circula-
tion has been demonstrated even when
the earlier assumptions are replaced
by more realistic conditions. With
regard to reactor calculations, 1t 1s
shown that the slowing down of neutrons
in parallel slabs of materials with
different properties can be described
in some instances by a set of 1mages
of the original neutron source,

Critical assemblies of both the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment and a
reflector-moderated reactor have been

tested (sec. 5). Critical mass,
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

control rod effectiveness, flux and
fission distribution, and self-
shielding factors have been determined
for this 1nitial reflector-moderated
assembly. As was expected, this as-
sembly gave rather peaked flux dis-
tribution curves, and the lumped fuel

resulted in rather large self-shielding
effects. Measurements on the ARE
critical assembly continued. Cali-
bration curves for the ARE control
rods were obtained, and the effects
of various core components on reac-
tivity were compared.

1. CIRCULATING FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
| J. H. Buck
Research Director’s Division

E. S. Bettis
ANP Division

A few relatively minor changes in
the design of some phases of the
Aircraft Reactor KExperiment have been
made 1n the past gquarter., These
changes involved the off-gas system
and the fuel disposal system, pri-
marily, and are discussed below.
There have been no changes in the
general design, and detailing of con-
struction and installation designs
has been largely completed. Installa-
tion of equipment in the building has
proceeded at an accelerated rate
throughout the quarter but has not
yet reached the expected peak rate.
Components from outside vendors, as
well as those fabricated 1n ORNL

shops, are being received in increas-
ing quantity; but some of the major
items, notably, the heat exchangers,

have not yet been received. It 1s
expected that all components will be
on hand by the end of the year.
Component testing is proceeding in
the experimental engineering labora-
tories (sec. 2}, but the final component
testing 1s to be done in the ARE
Building. It is new planned to by-
pass the reactor so that a thorough
system test can be made before the
nondrainable reactor is tied into the
~ circuit. This procedure will make
 possible a complete shake-down run
without the possibility of incorporat-
ing a nondrainable component 1in the
system. The design change necessitated
by this alteration in operational
procedure is minor and will be effected
in the field. Considerable effort
during the quarter went 1nto the
preparation of the “Haz ards Report, (1)
which, in addition to serving the

purpose implied in the name, provided
the first draft of an operations manual
for the experiment.

It is practically impossible to
predict a date for satisfactory opera-
tion of the ARE. There are no means
available for predetermination of the
time required to correct difficulties.
It is not so difficult to attempt to
predict a date for the completion of
the installation of equipment, and
therefore a date for beginning the
system test in the building. At
present it is expected that the system
will be ready for initial testing
near the first of June 1953. No
uranium will be added to the system
until all reasonable checks have been
made to ensure the integrity of the
entire assembly.

FLUID CIRCUIT

G. A. Cfisty, Engineering Department

The previous report(z) discussed
design changes necessitated by the
higher fuel viscosities. In brief,
the higher viscosities reduced the
Reynold’ s number of the heat exchanger
tube side and changed the heat transfer
coefficient to such an extent that the
calculated minimum film temperatures
were 1n the vicinity of the freezing
point. Two corrective measures were
discussed; redesigning the heat ex-
changers and increasing the flow rate
through the entire circuit. The first
change has been accomplished. The
need for the increased flow rate has
been obviated by an accurate measure-
ment of the fuel thermal conductivity;
the new value of £kis 1.5 Btu/hr*ft"°F,
whereas 0.5 had been used in earlier

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

analyses. With this higher conduc-
tivity value and the redesigned heat
exchangers, the calculated minimum
film temperatures are comfortably
above the freezing point, with the
original flow rate, Restoring the
flow rate to its original value will
reduce the reactor inlet temperature
to 1150°F and reduce the maximum
system pressures and pressure shell
stresses.

It has been decided to employ NakK
as the reflector and pressure-shell
coolant. This has necessitated com-
plete redesign of the reflector-
coolant heat exchangers, primarily
because NaK will extract more heat
from the fuel tube elbows and other
components washed by the coolant than
would the lower conductivity salt
around which the earlier calculations
were based. The heat exchangers have
been re-engineered and currently are
being constructed. The changes re-
ferred to above are reflected 1n the
revised flow sheet, Fig. 1.1.

Detailed engineering designs for
most of the outstanding i1tems have
been released during this quarter.
The items included were such components
as the fuel system surge tanks, the
reflector-cooling system surge tanks,
the reflector-cooling system heat
disposal loop and ducting, the thermal
barriers, the water system piping, the
glycol surge tank, the off-gas dis-
posal system, and some of the fuel
system piping. The redesigned ARE
pump is described in section 2, “Ex-
perimental Reactor Engineering,” and,
as stated therein, initial tests are
now in progress. Delivery of the
bellows type of valves that will be
used in the fuel and reflector systems
is expected within a month. The parts
for these valves are being supplied by
Fulton Sylphon Co., but the valves
are to be welded at ORNL.

STRESS ANALYSIS OF PIPING

R. L. Maxwell J. W. Walker
Consultants, ANP Division

The maximum stresses that will be
encountered in the piping for the ARE
have been calculated to be approxi-
mately 24,000 1b/in.%. Since these
stresses will be somewhat relieved by
creep at the operating temperature,
this stress value 1s only significant
in defining the stress range of the
pipe in going from the cold to the hot
condition. If the stresses were
completely relieved by creep, this
would correspond to a strain of about
1%.

In order to reduce the loads and
stresses in the pipe in the hot con-
dition, the piping will be pre-
stressed, or presprung, by an amount
equal to 75% of the total thermal
de formation. This will have the
effect of putting the maximum loads
on the pipe in the cold condition and
reducing to a large extent the load
in the hot condition. Because of the
uncertainty of realizing the designed
cold spring in the actual instal-
lation, only partial credit should be
taken for prespring. However, the
loads and stresses in the cold con-
dition were determined by considering
the full amount of the prestressing,
and the loads and stresses in the hot
condition were determined by con-
sidering only 50% prespring. This 1is
in agreement with accepted practice.

The maximum stresses in the cold
condition will be higher for the same
deformation than in the hot condition
because of the difference 1in the
modulus of elasticity. The maximum
values of the stresses are:

Cold § .. = 25,000 lb/in.?
12,000 1b/in.?

HOt Smax =
The maximum stress in the cold con-
dition is about one half the yield-
point stress, and the maximum stress

REACTOR

The reactor design, with the ex-
ception of very minor changes, remains
as previously described. All detailed
drawings have been released to the
shop. The beryllium oxide blocks have
been sized and are ready for assembly
into the core. The pressure shell has
been received from Lukenweld, ¢*’ the
reinforcing segments for the head have
been welded in place, and the head
holes have been bored. The various
core pressure-shell components are
currently being fabricated and as-
sembled.

INSTRUMENTATION
R. G. Affel, ANP Division

Installation of all instrument
panels has been completed. Approxi-
mately 80% of the process instruments
have been mounted and supplied with
electric power and/or compressed ailr.
The remalning instruments should be
installed by January 15, 1953. Minor
instrumentation changes have been made
to accommodate the design changes in
the pump seal. All major process
instrumentation components are de-
tailed and either on hand or on order.
It is planned to complete the instal-
lation of instruments on the panels
so that as work in the pits proceeds,
the sensing elements, when installed,
may be checked directly to the panels.

To date, 21 of a series of instru-
mentation prints have been issued and
shop fabrication started. The series
includes such items as the fuel
circuit flowmeter, the reflector-
cooling system (NaK) electromagnetic
flowmeter, the NaK purification system
electromagnetic flowmeter, the ta-
chometer mountings for the reflector
coolant and fuel helium fans, and the
liguid-level indicators for the re-

flector coolant and fuel surge tanks.

(3’The Lukenweld Division of The Lukens Steel Co.

Detailed prints of the vapor traps
required by the ZrF, condensate (cf.,
sec. 2, “Experimental Reactor Engi-
neering’”) for the surge tanks and the
hot fuel dump tank have been issued
and sent to the shops for fabrication.
Location of thermocouples on the
system has proceeded at a satisfactory
pace. Two prints showing thermocouple
construction have been issued and sent
to the shops. Since the system will
require approximately 750 thermo-
couples, every effort is being made to
run the thermocouple extension wires
to their approximate pit locations
before the pits have major components
placed within them. It is believed
that this procedure will expedite
final installation and test of the
temperature instrumentation.

OFF-GAS SYSTEM

S. A, Hluchan, Instrument Department
H. L. F. Enlund, Physics Divasion

The previous report(4) described an
activated-carbon off-gas scrubber
cooled by liquid nitrogen. Further
analyses have shown that the liquid
nitrogen consumption would be 1in
excess of 1000 1b/day because of the
decay heat of xenon and krypton 1f the
gases were held for less than 100 min
before reaching the scrubber. The
nitrogen consumption did not become
reasonable until the gases were held
up for many hours before admittance to
the scrubber. In fact, with little
additional difficulty, the gases could
be held up until they decayed suf-
ficiently to be discharged from the
stack and the need for the scrubber
would be obviated. Accordingly, it
has been decided to abandon the carbon
scrubber in favor of mechanical re-

tention.

gas, which will contain the volatile
fission products (Be, I, Xe, and
Kr), ¢5) passes through a NaK vapor
trap (where the Be and I are removed),
then into two holdup tanks (to permit
the decay of Xe and Kr), and is then
released in the stack. However, the
release of gases to the stack 1is
dependent upon two conditions: the
wind velocity is greater than 5 mph
and the activity, sensed by a monitor,
is less than an established maximum
value. The monitor is located between
the two storage tanks, which are
connected 1in series. Provision is
also made to exhaust the reactor pits
through the holdup tanks in the off-
gas system at a rate of 27 cfm (the
limit of the exhaust system). The
off-gas system 1s shown schematically
in Fig, 1.2.

With a static helium atmosphere in
the surge and dump tanks, the volu-
metric flow rate of fission gases 1is
a maximum of 0.0014 cfm. In order to
have a measurable flow of gas, the
fission gases are mixed with a fixed
air bleed of 10 cfm between the first
holdup tank and the monitors. The
minimum flow rate past the monitors
then 1s 10 cfm, and the maximum is
37 ¢fm (that 1s, 10 c¢fm from the fixed
air bleed plus 27 c¢fm 1f the room 1is
being exhausted at the same time).
The monitor setting can then be based
on the premise that the flow 1s 37 cfm,
and the setting will be conservative
by a factor of 3.7:1 wher the minimum
flow rate prevails.

The second holdup tank 1s placed
between the monitors and the stack
valve to increase the gas transit time
between the monitor and the valve to
ensure that the valve will have time
to close after the monitor signals the
presence of excess activity.

Maximum Activity of Stack Gases,
The maximum activity of the stack
gases has been calculated by assuming

 

(SJM. M. Mills, A Study of Reactor Hazards,
NAA-3R-31 (Dec. 7, 1949),

12

that the average energy of disinte-
gration is equal to 1 Mev.*? The
design of the off-gas system includes
two vacuum pumps that deliver a maximum
of 27 c¢fm and a blower that discharges
10 ¢cfm to give a total of 37 cim
maximum discharge through the monitor,
The maximum permissible ground concen-
tration for the 1-Mev fission-product
activity 1s

MPC = 1.6 x 10°% ue/cm® .
At 37 cfm, or 1.05 x 105 cm?®/min, and

with a permissible activity discharge
rate of 0.832 curie/min, which produces
the above MPC, the activity per cubic
centimeter should not exceed

m_g;gégm__: 0.8 Mc/cms ’

1.05 x 10°
as determined by the radiation moni-
tor. The monitors that control the
positions of the stack valve will be
set to prevent discharge as soon as
the activity of the gas rises above a
predetermined level.

The discharge rate of xenon and
krypton fission products to the atmos-
phere must be such that the activity
1is within the above limit. The
effective system holdup, before the
monitors, is 11.4 ft3, or 3.53 x 10°%
cm?® (the volume of one tank plus
piping). If it can be assumed that
the decay time of the fission products
is equal to the system volume divided
by the flow rate, the total energy at
a particular time can be calculated.
This energy must be converted to
disintegrations per unit time by
considering effective energy changes
in relation to the variation of 1so-
topic concentrations with time. The
values of permissible and calculated
stack activity have been plotted in
Fig. 1.3, together with the permissible
discharge rate, as determined by the
National Committee on Radiation Pro-

It will be noted that after 8500 min
of holdup, corresponding to a discharge
rate of 20.8 cm®/min through each

Normal Discharge from the Surge
Tank. The maximum pressure within the
surge tank is limited by a 5-psig
pressure regulator in the gas supply
system. The maximum discharge rate
from the surge tank is limited by a
Bourdon restrictor to 20 cm®/min with
a 3-psi pressure differential. At
this flow rate through each of two
restrictors, the holdup volume of the
system 1s such that it will allow
sufficient decay time, as required by
the above calculation, to permit the
discharge of the off-gas directly up
the stack. The change of effective
energy owlng tc the persistence of the
longer lived isotopes has been ac-
counted for when ground concentration
of this gas is considered.

Gas Vented from the Fuel Dump Tank
During Dumping. In considering waste
gases from the surge tanks, 1t has
been assumed that all gaseous products
escape 1nto the surge tanks during
operation. Actually, 1t is expected
that some portion of the fission-
product gases will remain in the fuel
and that some fraction of this portion

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

will be released when the fuel is
admitted to the radicactive-fuel dump
tank. When fuel i1s admitted to the
fuel dump tank, 1t is expected that
helium will be displaced at a rate of
the order of 5 ¢fm. This helium,
after passing through the NaK scrubber
and the first holdup tank, will be
admitted to the monitors. Should the
monlitors sense excess activity, the
stack valve will prevent discharge,
and the vacuum pumps will permit
recirculation through the holdup tanks
and monitors. The recirculation
should homogenize the gases and ensure
that the monitor i1s sensing a repre-
sentative sample. When the gases have
decayed sufficiently to permit release,
the monitor-controlled interlock will
open the stack valve.

2. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

Developmental work on components
for high-temperature dynamic fluid
systems has continued, with the effort
- being primarily on pumps, seals, heat
“exchangers, and instrumen tation.
Centrifugal pumps with both gas seals
and frozen seals have operated suc-
cessfully over the temperature range
of 1200 to above 1500°F, and operational
dif ficulties with these pumps have
- become less frequent. Techniques have
been developed for remotely stopping
~and restarting pumps 1lncorporating a
frozen-fluoride seal.

Emphasis has also been placed on
seal research 1n an effort to find
better materials for packing rotating-
shaft seals and valve-stem seals.
In the search for materials that will
~have negligible change in physical
properties at high temperatures and
will furnish some lubrication to the
- shaft at these temperatures, several
promising materials were found. A
. program is under way to develop a
face seal that will seal high-temper-
ature fluids against a gaseous atmos-
" phere, with the minimum leakage.

Various rotating-shaft seals for
containing high-temperature liquids
have been tested. To date, the best
results have been obtained with a
- packed seal in which the pumped liquid
~may be frozen. A program is under way
for developing a special type of seal
~in which a material different from
" the liquid being pumped and having a
higher melting temperature 1s injected
1nto the seal and frozen. Tests
conducted to date indicate that this
type of seal shows promise.

Heat transfer tests have been
conducted with the sodium-to-air
~radiator, and the sodium inlet temper-
" ature has been increased to 1700°F.
The radiator tested had 15 fins per
inch, which were sectioned every
2 inches. This gave a net improvement
~of 20% in the over-all heat transfer

coefficient, as compared with that for
an unsectioned radiator, A bi-fluid
heat transfer system has been con-
structed, and shake-down tests have
been conducted satisfactorily.

The rotameter type of flowmeter
that uses a tapered core riding inside
an induction coil as the float-position
sensing element has given very satis-
factory performance.’ This type of
flowmeter will be used in the ARE.
The Moore Nullmatic pressure trans-
mitters, modified for high-temperature
operation, have given trouble-free
performance during several hundred
hours of operation with pressure
transmitter temperatures as high as
1400°F. Pressures up to 70 psi were
measured.

Techniques for the vacuum distil-
lation of small guantities of Nak
fromliquid systems arebeing developed,
since all the NaK used for cleaning
the ARE fuel system cannot otherwise
be removed. Tests have continued for
determining the temperature-dependence
of gas line plugs above systems
employing a ZrF, -bearing fluoride
mixture. Vapor condensation traps for
this ZrF, vapor, in which the vapor
is bubbled through the eutectic
NaF-KF-LiF, have been satisfactorily
tested. _

Improvements made in the plant
facilities are the installation of a
helium distribution system, the
expansion of the fabrication shop
facilities, the completion of the
instrument shop facilities, and the
installationof six gas-fired furnaces.

600 to 800°F

The packing of the pump was made up
of Inconel braid with mixtures of
graphite powder and nickel powder
between the layers of braid. The pump
shaft was coated with Stellite No. 6.

Operation of the pump was charac-
terized by frequent power surges of
the driving motor because of shaft
seizing in the seal area. Tricresyl
phosphate and lead glass were periodi-
cally injected into the seal as
lubricants, with indeterminant results,
Postrun examination of the shaft
showed very severe scoring in the
frozen seal region (0.036 in. on the
diameter of the 1 1/2-in, shaft).

The second run of this pump was of
600 -hr duration, Loop shutdown was
caused by leakage of the pump flange.
Changes made 1in the pump and in the
operating procedure before this run
wer e:

1. pump shaft resurfaced to remove
scoring of first run,

2. packing changed to nickel-foil
wrapped braid with graphite powder
be tween packing layers,

3. no lubricants injected.

Operation was much smoother than
that of the first run. This seemed
to be primarily the result of closer
temperature regulation of the frozen-
seal area. 1t was found that 750 to
BOO°F was the most satisfactory range
for relatively smooth operation.
lLeakage of solid fluoride from the
seal at these temperatures varied
approximately from 1 to 3 g/day. The
packing temperature was maintained at

1050°F.

18

A stop-start technique for the
frozen seal was developed during this
second run. Upon turning off the
motor power, the pump coasts freely to
a stop. However, the shaft becomes
immovable in approximately 30 seconds.
Therefore calrod heating is applied to
the frozen seal area and the tempera-
ature brought to an indicated 850°F,
The seal then loosens, and the operation
may be resumed with no leakage. Timing
1s important, since the application
of too much heat may result in heavy

seal leakage. A quick means of
cooling the seal, such as an air
blast, must be used i1f the frozen

seal is completely removed,

A second Durco pump has been
modified to i1nclude a combination
packed and frozen seal. This pump has
accumulated 84 hr of operation at
1200°F and flow rates up to 60 gpm.

Operation of this pump has been
very difficult because of unexplained
sei1zing 1in the seal area. Temperature
rises along the seal area indicate
that the taking place 1in
the packing area of the seal. This
cannot be definitely concluded,
since the shaft has not been
examined in that area.

Some stop-start data were obtained
during one of the runs. It appeared
that a very definite temperature range
(750 to 820°F in this case) was needed
for remote loosening of the shaft and
subsequent startup without leakage,.
The start-stop procedure was repeated
five times, and successful operation
followed each trial, However, this
performance could not be duplicated
in later trials. Part of this incon-
sistency 1is thought to be caused by
the chip retainer, which 1s being
removed for the next run.

seizing 1s

however,

One other change 1s being made in
the seal geometry in an attempt to
obtain more consistent operation.
The radial clearance between shaft
and wall in the frozen seal region is
being increased from 0.010 to 0,040
in. to more closely duplicate the
design of the first combination seal
"pump, discussed above, which ran
satisfactorily. ‘ :

Pump with Frozen-Sodium Seal.
Approximately 4000 hr of operation
had been accumulated when the test
of the pump with the frozen-sodium
seal had to be terminated because of
leaking flanges and failure of a
thermocouple well. The final run
was of 1000-hr duration at a pump
temperature of 1100°F, '

Postrun examination of the pump
showed no measurable wear of the
shaft in the frozen-seal area. Scoring
of the rear face of the impeller,
- which indicated inter ference with the

housing, was very severe and was
probably the source of pump noises
during the last run. ' :

Allis-Chalmers Pump. During this
quarter the Allis-Chalmers pump that
has a hydrostatic bearing was tested
with NaK as the system fluid. When
this pump was first tested, the shaft
gas seal provided by Allis-Chalmers
was used. The seal consisted of three
Graphitar rings, each of which had
three 120 ~deg segments. The room-
temperaturediametral clearance between
shaft seal rings was designed to be
between 0.0065 and 0.008 inch. At
operating conditions (approximately
170 gpm, 45-ft head, and elevated
temperature), the diametral clearance
and the gas leakage to atmosphere past
these rings were to approach zero.

In the first test, the gas leakage
past the seal was excessive, and a
large amount of gas was entrained in
the system fluid. Therefore two
modifications were made to the pump:
a rotary face seal was added to
decrease gas leakage to atmosphere,
and additional baffling, suggested by
Allis-Chalmers, was placed in the
region above the pump impeller to
reduce gas entrainmentin system fluid.

The second test revealed that the
additional baffling did materially
reduced gas entrainment in the system
fluid and also that the rotary face

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

seal reduced gas leakage toa tolerable
level. The unlubricated rotary face
seal, however, squealed and chattered
aftera very short period of operation.
Further testing indicated that the
seal operating temperature was sensitive
to changes in pump suction pressure,
a condition that may be overcome by
using a balanced bellows seal. These
tests indicate that this pump will
give satisfactory performance when a
good gas seal is incorporated in the
design. A frozen-sodium gas seal 1is
presently being fabricated for test
in this pump.

Laboratory-Size Pump with Gas Seal.
The laboratory-size centrifugal pump
with a gas seal, described previ-
ously,(1) has been operated for a
total of 1275 hr with the fluoride
fuel NaF-ZrF -UF, (46-50-4 mole %) at
temperatures up to 1500°F. The average
fluid temperature during this period
was approximately 1350°F. The satis-
factory performance data obtained are
presented in Fig. 2.1. The pump
discharge pressure and pressure drop
across the venturi were measured by
means of the null-balance level-
indicator systen.

The initial difficulty of liquid-
level detection in the pump bowl at
high shaft speeds has been overcome.
The turbulence in the liquid surface
has been reduced by additional baffling,
and the action of the probes used
for level detection has been quite
satisfactory up to shaft speeds of
4400 rpm.

The rotary gas seal ~ Graphitar
No. 30 lubricated with spindle o0il
running against hardened tool steel -
has functioned with ‘extremely small
gas leakage and without maintenance
or appreciable wear during the total
running time. Oil leakage past the
seal assembly was collected, and 1t
was found to amount to less than
1 ¢m?® per 24-hr period. The only

A second pump has been fabricated
and installed in the fluoride loop
of a bi-fluid heat exchanger system.
No radical changes have been planned
in the present design. However, some
effort has been put forth to simplify
the construction of the shaft and
radiation heat shields.

ARE Pump. It is now planned that
the pumps for the ARE fuel circuit are
to be similar to the ANP experimental
engineering model FP. Figure 2.2
shows an assembly-section view of the
pump. A standard commercial pump base
with ball bearings that support a
horizontal, overhung shaft provides
the foundation., The pump casing is
supported through the sealing head and
casing extension. The sealing head
1s sealed to the pump casing with a
commercial oval-ring gasket in a
bolted flange joint, By removing this
Joint from the hot region near the
pumped liguid and away from regions
requiring preheating, satisfactory
sealing 1s readily accomplished. '

Pump suction and discharge con-
nections to the circulating system
are made by welding. The pump impeller
is an Inconel casting from standard
Worthington Pump Co. The
discharge case 1s machined from heavy
Inconel forgings and has a concentric
volute and a welded tangential dis-
charge. The impeller is double-keyed
to the overhung shaft and i1s held
in place by a thrust nut and a locking
screw. Normal radial clearances are
employed between the impeller hubs and
the sealing labyrinths, and an axial
clearance of 5/32 in. 1in either
direction prevents jamming resulting
from differential thermal expansion,
The shaft seal is of the frozen-packed
design; the gland for the stuffing
box provides the region for the frozen
seal. To prevenl cracking or checking
of the hard surface material on the
shaft, the material is applied as a
loose-fitting, prefabricated sleeve,
The concentricity between seal and
shaft and the differential expansion
are controlled by angle-beveling the
inside of both ends to the geometrical
angle of the sleeve.

A cartridge type of electric heater

slinger arrangement is provided just
outboard of the seal gland to maintain
a suitable temperature on the oil
seals and bearing. Two independent
heaters are provided on the outer
surface of the seal shell for further
control of the temperatures in the
seal region. Provision is made for
the circulation of a coolant through
selected portions of the shaft. Circu-
lation of lubricating o1l through
the bearing housing 1s provided to
minimize effects of radiation damage
to the lubricant.

The pump (Fig. 2.2) provides a
seal for NaK for system cleaning by
maintaining molten sodium in the gland
groove and freezing on both sides of
the annulus. During operation with
fluorides, this annulus will serve as
a shield to prevent the loss of
enriched material by guiding the
expected slight leakage to a con-
tainer. The coolant for freezing the
sodium is to be kerosene at approxi-
mately S0°F, A beveled surface on the
gland makes a metal-to-metal s'eal
against the inner edge of the seal
shell to form a NaK-tight seal around
the outer surface of the gland. This
frozen-sodium seal also seals the
system during vacuum removal of the
NaK. During operation with NaK, the
cartridge heater is removed from the
center of the shaft, and a squirt-
tube arrangement is inserted to circu-
late cooled kerosene.

The only alteration necessary to
make the pump suitable for circulating
NaK as a moderator and reflector
coolant is the elimination of the
shaft sleeve and the seal heaters.

on packed seals for pumps and valves,
and screening tests have been made on
a number of packing materials for
possible use as lubricants. The test
consisted of heating the material
under compression to 1500°F for a
period of time and then comparing the
heated material with the original
material. The materials tested
included C (graphite), PbO, Ni,0,,
Ni,0, + PbO, PbO + Mo, Ni,O, + Mo,
CrF,, Ni,0, +C, PbD + C, Pb,(OH),CrO,,
MoS,, Ni, 0, +MeS,, MeS, + Mo, BN+ MoS,,
BN, Ni,0, + BN, BN + C, ZnS, CeQ,, and
CaF,. The tests indicated that the
following materials may possibly be
useful as high-temperature lubricants:
C (graphite), N1203,~Ni203 + Mo,
Ni203 + C, MoSz, MoS2 + Mo, MoS2 + BN,
and BN + C. CeO, may be a fine
abrasive. It 1s planned to further
test these materials in contact with
fluorides,

One test apparatus for screening
materials has been built and operated
that consists of a fluoride pot with
stuffing boxes on the top and bottom.
A single shaft is inserted through
both the stuffing boxes, and the
material to be tested 1s conhtained in
the spring-loaded glands. The shaft
1s reciprocated by an air cylinder,
and the power requirements can be
measured. Graphite and MoS, have
been vested at 1000°F in this device
with no fluoride leakage out of the
stuffing boxes. However, the fluoride
wets the surface of the shaft and 1is
carried i1into the packing where it
causes the shaft to bind with the
packing, and the power reguirement
becomes excessive. Mixtures of
graphite and MoS, with powdered
fluoride have also been tried in
these glands, but there was no fluoride
in the pot. The results were similar
1n that the powdered fluoride melted
and caused the gland walls and the
- shaft surface to bind. _

One other test device that is being
assembled has 1dentical packings
located at each end of a lantern gland

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

in a heated container with a rotating
shaft through the assembly. The
equipment is designed so that liquids,
such as fluorides or lubricants, can
be introduced under pressure into the
lantern gland. This assembly 1is
mounted so that spring tension prevents
rotation, and the torque required for

operation can be measured.
Packing Compression Tests, As

reported previously,(?? experience
with high-temperature packing materials
indicates thatin almost every instance
stuffing boxes have required re-
tightening after they reached operating
temperature. Therefore a series of
tests have been run onvarious materials
to determine their compression charac-
teristics. A dial indicator for
measuring the expansion or contraction
of the material being tested was
mounted on the test apparatus. In
the tests, a l-in.-thick layer of the
material being tested was subjected
to a compressive force of 75 psi and
the compression was measured. The
material was then heated to 1500°F
and held at that temperature until
the dial indicator showed no further
change. After reachingthis equilibrium
condition, the material was held at
1500°F for a further period of 1 hr,
and the compression was again measured.
The change in compression, that is,
the difference between the compression
before heating and the compression
after heating, 1s given in Table 2.1.
This test procedure was repeated
several times for each material. In
all tests thus far, with the exception
of the test of nickelic oxide, there
was little, 1f any, further dimensional
change after the initial heating.
Packing Penetration Tests. A
series of tests has been run to
determine the wetting susceptibility
of various materials. The materaal
to be tested is compressed by a heavy
washer and screw in a contailner.

to pusE the stem through the packing material
in order to disassemble the apparatus. The
material contracted several thousandths of an
inch when cooled after each heating period.
Upon the fourth heating, thematerial expanded
sTightly.

Material was easily removed from the apparatus
and was apparently unchanged.

Material had to be chiseled from the apparatus.

Material had to be chiseled from the aspparatus.

 

Fluoride 1s introduced above the
material being tested, and gas pressure
1s applied to drive the fluoride
through the material.

Graphite, when compressed, was not
gas tight, and when the fluoride was
loaded there appeared to be a definite
interface between the fluoride and
graphite, which indicated that the
graphite was not wetted by the fluoride.
The test ran 240 hr with a pressure of
30 psi above the fluoride.

Boron nitride, when compressed,
also was not gas tight; however, after
the fluoride was loaded the test ran
26 hr with 5-psi pressure above the

24

fluoride without leakage of the
fluoride i1nto the boron nitrade.
The pressure was then increased to
10 psi and leakage began. There was
some greenish color a1n the boron
nitride. The main leakage path of the
fluoride appeared to be along the
walls of the container and the screw
stem toward the hole 1n the bottom of
the container for the screw stem.
Stainless steel braid was compressed
and heated to the annealing temperature
twice and further compressed after
each heating. The material permitted
free flow of gas before 1t was filled
with fluoride. ITmmediately after
filling, fluoride leakage occurred at
only 1-psi pressure. The leakage soon
stopped, and the gas flow was somewhat
retarded. When the pressure was
increased £o3 psi, most of the fluoride
was forced from the container., Exami-
nation showed that only a small amount
of fluoride had adhered to the braid.

Attempts were made to run tests of
molybdenum disulfide and nickelic
oxide, but these materials were so
“fluid” that the container would not
hold them. Parts with smaller clear-
ances are being fabricated. ,

Face Seal Tests. Face seals are
being considered for high-temperature
use with both gases and liquids. All
tests have been run in air at room
temperature with speeds of about
1600 rpm and pressures of up to 14 psi.
The following combinations of materials

were tested 1n air, without added
lubrication:
Carboloy (gréde 779} vs. Carboley {(grade 779)

Carboloy {grade 779) vs. graphite (grade C-18)

Graphite (grade C-18) vs. graphite {grade C-1§)
In the test of Carboloyvs. Carboloy,
a loud, grinding noise developed
within 5 min, and inspection showed
that annular grooves had been worn
into each surface. Operation with the
other two combinations of materials
was satisfactory until chattering
developed when a temperature of about
550°F was reached at the seal because
of the heat of friction. If graphite
depends upon a layer of tightly held
moisture for some of its lubrication

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

qualities,(3*4) then this chattering

may be due to the driving-off of
surface-held moisture at a more rapid
rate than 1t can be supplied by
diffusion from the interior of the
graphite. The time required for the
test seals to reach the chattering
stage was usually between 1/2 and
4 hr; however, in one test the Carboloy
vs., graphite seal operated satis-
factorily for 42 hours. The area of
seal contact was 1 1/2 in.? in each
test, and the seal contact force was
varied from 5 to 20 pounds. Similar
results were obtained when Carboloy
vs. graphite seals were tested with
MoS, and RbOH used as lubricants.
Although some seals showed relatively
little chattering, therewas, generally,
a marked increase in the torque
required to overcome the seal frlctlcn
as the seals heated up.

Combination Packed and Frozen Seal.
A seal consisting of a stuffing box
packed with powdered graphite in which
the slight leakage of fluoride was
frozen in the packing compression
member was operated for a period of
215 hr at temperatures from 970 to
1500°F with system pressuresthat
varied from 16 to 37 ps Leakage
rates were measured at_various temper ~
atures and pressures in an attempt to
determine the most favorable operating
conditions.

During this test there was no
indication of shaft seizing by the
seal. Spectrographic analysis of the
leakage showed the constituents to be
Co, B, Cd, Cr, Fe, K, Ni, and Si, as
well as Na, U, and Zr. Chemical
analysis of the leakage indicated that
the Na, U, and Zr constituents were
present in very nearly the same
proportions as in the fluoride in the
system. A second test, with a similar
packing, in which the compression
member 1s spring loaded to keep tension
on the graphite at all times has been
in operation for approximately 350 hr
with only small leakage of solid
fluoride and with no operational

difficulties.
¥rozen-Lead Seal. A test, similar

to previous tests with sodium, was
conducted to determine the operating
characteristics of a frozen seal when
lead is used as the system fluid.
The equipment consisted of a chrome-
plated stainless steel shaft rotating
in a finned sleeve in which the frozen
seal was formed. A pot to contain
the hot lead to supply the seal was
attached to the finned section. The
finned sleeve was provided with a
heater for melting out the frozen
seal 1in order to resume operation
after a shut-down. A portion of the
finned section was shrouded so that a
blast of air could be directed across
the seal when required. This test
operated for a period of 526 hr with
leakage occurring when the finned
section temperature was permitted to
exceed 600°F. The lead temperature
in the pot was between 1000 and 1200°F,
and the system pressure was 8 ps1.
Very smooth operation was experienced,
with no tendency toward shaft seizure.
The test was terminated when the seal
became too hot and caused an excessive
loss of lead. This test 1indicates
that a lead pump with a frozen-lead
seal can be expected to give as satis-
factory performance as a sodium pump
with a frozen-sodium seal.

Frozen-Sodium Seal. Preliminary

26

tests have been conducted to determine
the feasibility of using a frozen-
sodium seal for sealing a high-temper-
ature NaK pump. This design consists
of a heated annulus around the shaft
to which molten sodium 1s supplied
from an attached container. Sodium 1in
the annulus i1s kept molten at all
times. A coolant passage 1s located
on either side of the molten sodium
for freezing the sodium around the
shaft and preventing sodium leakage
from the annulus. The temperature of
the NaKis reduced to below the melting
point of the sodium at the frozen
sodium-to-NaK interface. In the
initial tests, some difficulty has
been encountered with heat conduction
by the solid shaft to the region of
the frozen-sodium seal that 1s suf-
ficient to melt out the sodium forming
the seal when the NaK bath 1is at
temperatures greater than 500°F;
however, 1t 1s expected that internal
cooling of the shaft will eliminate
this difficulty.

These tests indicate that such an
arrangement will satisfactorily seal
the rotating shaft of a NaK pump 1f
the temperature of the NaK at the
NaK-to-sodium interface 1s below the
melting point of the sodium and
sufficient internal cooling of the
shaft 1s provided to prevent the
melting of the frozen-sodium seal.
This design 1s being incorporated
into the pumps for the moderator-
cooling circuit of the ARE and also
in the pumps for the 1nitial circu-
lation of NaK through the ARE {fuel
circult.

Bellows-Type of Valve Stem Seal
(G.M. Adamson, R.S. Crouse, Metallurgy
Division). Two, 3-ply, Inconel
bellows 2 in. in diameter and 3 1in,
long were examined for the Experimental
Engineering group. The bellows had
been fabricated at the Fulton Sylphon
Co. by using a special rolling technique.
The first one had been i1mmersed in the
fuel mixture NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %) for 975 hr and the second one
for 1975 hr at 1500°F.¢%> The first
bellows examined had fluorides between
the outer and center ply and the
second one, which was full of fluorides,
had failed completely.

The most important observation made
during this investigation was that the
wall thickness of the bellows was
much less than that expected. Instead
of the thickness being 0.027 in.,
the average thickness was only 0.022
inch. What was even more serious was
that the bends were even thinner. In
the first bellows, the bends had been
thinned an additional 34% and in the
other 21%. In the first bellows,
several spots in the outside ply were
less than 0.002 in. thick. |

The first bellows probably failed
through one of the thinned down areas
in the outer ply. No definite cause
for the complete failure of the second
bellows can be given. When examined,
this bellows contained many circumfer-
ential cracks. Although it i1s certain

that some of these cracks were made

after the test, 1t is probable that
some of them were fabrication cracks
and were the cause of the failure.
In both these bellows, considerable
self-welding between the plies was
found at the bends. _

The manufacturer was contacted, and
two similar bellows were obtained for
examination in the "“as received”
condition. Two other 3-ply bellows
1 3/8 1in. in diameter and 6 in. long
were also sent for examination. The
two 2-1n. bellows are even thinner
than those discussed above. Both
these bellows had an average thickness
of 0.018 inch. The plies were more

nearly uniform and the thinning in the
- bends was 16.7 and 12.5%. The two
smaller bellows also had an average
thickness of 0.018 inch. The reductions
- found 1in the bends of these two were

16.7 and 11.1%. No self-welding or
fabrication cracks were found in any
of these bellows.

Sodium-to-Air Radiatoer. The third

sodium-to-air radiator performance
and endurance test was started during
the quarter and ran for 1212 hr before
failure., The running time at the
varioussodium inlet temperaturee is
given in the following:

Failure occurred at a sodium inlet
temperature of 1700°F, and the resulting
fire did very little damage because
the system was dumped as soon as the
leak was indicated by a heavy smoke
discharge from the air duct. No fire
fighting was necessary, and the sodium
outside the system was allowed to burn
1tself out. _

Again, as 1in both of the previous
tests, a center tube between the
header and top fin on the sodium inlet
side of the radiator failed. The
tubes 1in this radiator were fabricated
from type 316 stainless steel and had
0.025-2n. walls in contrast to the
type 304 stainless steel tubes with
0.015-1n. walls used in the previous
designs.

Since all three failures occurred
in the same location, 1t is possible

27
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

that a localized stress was set up in
the shorter tubes between the header
and the fin matrix during the brazing
operation. Such stress may be relieved
by increasing the spacing between the
headers and top fin.

Considerable difficulty was en-
countered after about 400 hr of
operation of this test in keeping the
radiator tubes free fromoxide buildup,
which would have eventually caused
plugging. The plugging that occurred
in the cooler sections of the radiator
could be temporarily relieved by
shuttingoff the air flow and operating
under isothermal conditions, at 1200°F,
for approximately 1 hour. After
normal operation resumed, the
plugging would start again, and after
several hours a drop 1a heat transfer
performance would be observed.

A by-pass filter circuit was
designed into the loop to prevent such
oxide plugging, but 1t was rendered
almost inoperable becausecf inadequate
flow regulation. A small orifice was
used to reduced the flow through the
filter caircurt, but the orifice
plugged easily at the low flow rates
necessary for lowering the fluid
temperatures in the filter.

A throttling valve was substituted
for the orifice, and the fluid entering
the filter was held at 600 to 800°F
below the main stream temperature,
Approximately one-eighth of the total
system flow was continuously passed
through the filter, and the radiator
was cleaned sufficiently to rumn about
500 hr without serious tube plugging.
When the temperature of the sodium
entering the radiator was raised
to 1700°F, some tube plugging started
again and had not been satisfactorily
cleared before the failure.

The radiator was of the same
general design as that of previous

was

models, and the fin spacing was 15
fins per inch. The fins were cut
through, interrupted, and slightly

against mass air flow rate per square
foot of face area (Fig. 2.3). An
improvement of about 20% in the over-
all heat transfer coefficient was
achieved over the continuous fin
exchanger, as shown by the dashed
line. The accompanying increase 1in
air-pressuredrop was between 10 and 15%.

Bifluid Heat Transfer System.
Assembly of the bifluid loop reported
previously(®) has been completed. The
NaK system has been filled and the
electromagnetic pump has been checked.
Various minor changes were necessary,
such as correcting reversed thermo-
couples and clearing gas lines.
Considerable effort was required to
get the electromagnetic pump started.
The trouble, however, stemmed entirely
from nonwetting or uncleanliness of
the pump cell. When the NaK was
heated 1n the sump tank so that the
pump cell temperature reached 450°F,
the pump started i1immediately. A flow
rate of 11 gpm at 250 v input to the
pump primary coil was achieved. This
pump is a G-E model G-3, with a modified
cell that has nickel lugs welded into
the sides of a type 316 stainless
steel throat.

The electromagnetic flowmeters will
be calibrated against the NaK venturi
to complete the shake-down of the NaK
system.

The fluoride system has been filled
with the fluoride fuel, NaF-ZrF4-UF4
(50-46-4 mole %), and check runs are
being made before combined operation
of the two-fluid systems 1s undertaken.
The gas seal of the fluoride pump was
operated dry up to 5000 rpm to check
for gas or o1l leakage, but none was
apparent. Vibration of the pump and
support structure at the high speed
was slaght,

Dynamic corrosion data of interest
to the ARE will be obtained in the
heat exchanger of this loop (a small-
diameter nickel tube). A temperature

rotameter type of flowmeter had been
installed in a high-temperature
fluoride loap and that 1t had not
operated successfully. The difficulty
encountered with the flowmeter was
binding of the tapered-core position
indicator in its housing as a result
of thermal distortion. The details of
construction of this flowmeter and 1ts
principle of operation were given
previously.(7)

Other such flowmeters have been
constructed with increased clearance
around the tapered core to prevent
binding. One has operated for a
period of 600 hr and measured flows up
to 17 gpm at 1300°F. The temperature
of the static fluoride in which the
tapered core operates is 1100°F. Flow
measurements have been accurate to
within 10%. It was found that such
accuracy can be maintained for long
periods 1f close control is maintained
over the temperature of the fluorides
in which the tapered core 1s operated.

A similar flowmeter, with a capacity
to 60 gpm, has been installed and is
operating successfully 1n a larger
test loop. This 1instrument can be
adapted for ARE use.

Rotating-Vane Flowmeter. The
rotating-vane flowmeter manufactured
by the Potter Instrument Co. and
modified by the Experimental Engineering
group, as reported previously,(®) has
been installed in a high-temperature
loop. Attempts to measure flow with
this instrument have been unsuccessful.
Under loop operating conditions, no
signal that can be calibrated in
terms of flow can be obtained from
the flowmeter., One difficulty ex-
perienced i1s that the loop heater
circuits cause 1nduced voltages in the
pickup coil that are greater than the
signal expected from the flowmeter;
however, when the heater circuits are
turned off for short periods, no
useful signal 1s detectable with the
present i1nstrumentation. It 1s

thought that thermal distortion at
this temperature (1300°F) caused the
bearings to seize and render the
instrument inoperable, This instrument
will not be available for examination
until tests with the loop in which 1t
has been placed have been terminated
and the loop has been dismantled.

Diaphragm Pressure-Measuring
Device. The diaphragm pressure-
measuringdevice reported previously{®>
which utilizes a linear differential
transformer to measure the deflection
of a diaphragm, has been i1in operation
for more than 100 hr at temperatures
up to 1040°F., The diaphragm in this
instrument is made of 1/16-in.,, flat,
Inconel stock 3 in. in diameter.
Preliminary tests indicate that the
operation is reliable up to 1000 °F
over the range from 0 to 40 psi. To
date, the instrument has been tested
only with inert gas against the
diaphragm; however, it 1s not expected
that the introduction of molten
fluorides will radically change the
operating characteristics of the
instrument, The only observable
effects of 1ncreased temperature are a
shift of the zero point and an increase
in the slope of the performance curve
(Fig. 2.4). A second instrument 1is
being fabricated that will operate
with fluorides at 1000 to 1100°F
against the Inconel diaphragm.

Moore Nullmatic Pressure Trans-
mitter. The Moore Nullmatic pressure
transmitter reported previously,(19)
which was modified to prevent the
fluorides from coming 1in contact with
the bellows pressure-sensing element,
has been installed in a high-tempera-
ture fluoride loop and has operated
successfully for approximately 200
hours. The pressure-transmitter
temperatures have ranged as high as
1400°F, and pressures have been
measured up to 70 psi. A slight zero
shift has been encountered with

Static corrosion tests of 3-ply
Inconel bellows 1n the fluoride
mixture NaF~ZrF4-UF4 (46-50-4 mole %)
at 1500°F indicate that such bellows
may be incorporated in the Moore
Nullmatic pressure transmitters and
operated with the high-temperature
fluorides 1in contact with the bellows.
Six such instruments, rated at Q0 to

100 psi, have been ordered from the
manufacturer.

It is also possible that an instru-
ment constructed with single-ply
type 316 stainless steel, type 347
stainless steel, or nickel bellows may
be used with the ZrF,-bearing fluoride
fuels, sinceit is possible to maintain
the fluid in static condition and
to keep the temperaturein the pressure
transmitter between 1000 and 1100°F
and thus minimize the effects of
corrosion. (Results of preliminary

31
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

static corrosion tests of stainless
steel, Inconel, and nickel 1in these
fluorides indicate little corrosion.)

The possibility of locating the
instrument beneath the loop and
completely submerging the bellows 1in
a bath of molten lead with a tempera-
ture gradient in the lead from 1100°F
at the top to Just above the melting
point at the bellows is being in-
vestigated. This would provide a
molten lead - molten fluoride interface
that would make possible pressure
transmittal from a 1500°F fluoride
stream without exposing the bellows
to damaging temperatures. Static
tests have indicated that the fluoride
mixture will remain on top of the
lead and will not mix with the lead.

NaK Distillation Test. The use of
cutectic NaK alloy (78 wt % K, 22
wt % Na) for cleaning the ARE {fuel
circuit 1s planned. It is anticipated
that about 95% of the NaK in the entire
fuel circuit can be drained and the
remainder will be removed by vacuum
distillation under heat, An experi-
mental unit has been constructed, and
the first test of vacuum distillation
of NaK has been conducted. 1In this
test, approximately 6 1b of eutectic
NaK at 1200°F was distilled from a
boiler by wusing a small vacuum pump
that pulled continuously from the
receiver and maintained a pressure of
less than 2 mm Hg. A steady flow of
approximately 3 scfmof helium was
maintained through the system. This
operation continued intermittently for
approximately three days; however,
there was some down time on the system
because of gas leaks and other equipment
failures. This test indicated that
under attainable operating conditions,
this quantityof NaK could be distilled

32

from a boiler in somewhat less than
16 hours.

Gas-Line Plugging., It was reported
previously(1!) that continued tests
were being conducted to determine the
extent of gas-line plugging from the
vapors of a bath of the fuel mixture
NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (46 -50-4 mole %) at
various elevated temperatures. A
summary of the results of the tests,
to date, follows:

1. In operation at 1050°F, there
wasno gas-line plugging during 1488 hr
of testing.

2. 1In operation at 1300°F, all
lines partly plugged after 666 hr of
operation. Upon examination, the
lines appeared to be totally plugged,
but the plugs were sufficiently porous
to allow the passageof gas at approxi-
mately onc-tenth that of the initial
flow rate.

3. In operation at 1500°F, all
lines plugged solid ain 100 hr of
operation.

These tests indicate that gas
lines may be expected to operate
satisfactorily in a system contailning
this fuel, providing the free surface
of the fuel adjacent to the entry gas
lines 1s at a temperature in the range
between 1050 and 1100°F. Above these
temperatures, some difficulty may
be expected.

ZrF, Vapor Condensation Test,(12)
In the absence of reliable vapor-
pressure data for ZrF,, tests were
conducted to determine the minimum
container-wall temperature needed to
minimize or prevent condensation of
ZrF, on the walls. Each of four
1-in.-IPS tubes 18 1n. long was
charged with approximately 180 g of
the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (46 -50 -4
mole %). The fuel was maintained at
1500°F in each tube, and the portions
above the fuel tubes were maintained
at different temperatures, ranging

______ for each tube.

' These conditions were maintained for
300 hours. The tubes were then
sectioned and examined for crystal
~deposits of ZrF,. Correlation of
“crystal deposits on the inside tube
walls with the various tube-wall
 temperatures during the test indicates
that the ZrF, vapor given off by the
fuel at 1500°F will condense on any
" surface that is at a temperature of
1250°F or lower. When the tube-wall
temperature 1s maintalned at a temper-
ature greater than 1250°F, no deposits
of ZrF, crystals will be formed.
These data check reasonably well wath
available vapor-pressure data for
ZrF, and for the fluoride mixture
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %).

offset completely by the saving already
accrued from complete elimination
of the labor formerly required to
carry out the time-consuming process
of filling empty ecylinders with helium
at the tank car, transporting the
cylinders to intermediate storage,
performing individual purity tests
spectrographically on each cylinder,
distributing the cylinders to work

empty cylinders to the tank car for

expansion of the machine shop and
relocation of every fabrication work

reduced, better housekeeping 1is
achieved, and a more workable ar-

The use of oxygen and acetylene
cylinders has been eliminated by

The nonmagnetic laboratory benches
are supplied with electric outlets,
grounding busses, and piped supplies
of helium, natural gas, oxygen, and

in the area 1s adequate. Installation
of an air-conditioningsystem designed
to maintain this laboratory at constant

start in the near future.

53. GENERAL DESIGN STUDIES
A, P. Fraas, ANP Division

A program for the development of
liguid-to-air radiators for turbojet
~engines has been outlined. Because of
the magnitude of the work involved,
the Air Force (Wright Air Development
Center) is planning a program for the

development of radiator fabrication
" technigues., The performance of a
radiator already tested at ORNL(!? has
 been extrapolated to that of a full-
scale radiator, and the data have been
~used to analyze the performance of a
Sapphire turbojet engine incorporating

such a radiator. Performance data for
~ both the radiator and engine appear to
be very encouraging.

Further design and analysis of
reflector-moderated reactors(2) have
been held in abeyance pending the
completion of critical experiments
to determine feasibility., Preliminary
results of the first critical assembly
are described in section 5, “Critical
Experiments.” ‘ ;

ATIR RADIATOR PROGRAM
A. P. Fraas, ANP Division

Further analytical and design
studies have been carried out on tube-
and- fin radiators. The results of this
work, coupled with the experimental
test results, indicate that 1t 1s not
possible to predict the heat transfer
pertformance of various radiator core
geometries closely enough to ascertain
which of the several designs 1is the
best one without testing them. A set
of rough scrting calculations indi-

cates, however, that tests on the
cores listed in Table 3.1 should be
made, Since this constitutes a con-

siderable program of test work that is
more closely related to the engine

than to the reactor, the Wright Air
Development Center has agreed to try
to carry out, through contracts with
vendors, part of the program; heat
transfer information and endurance

one or more sources of radiator supply

should be established. :

RADIATOR PERFORMANCE

G. D, Whitman H. J. Stumpf

Performance calculations show that
a radiator core with 30 fins per inch
should be very satisfactory even
though it would operate at Reynold’s
numbers far down in the laminar flow
range., Therefore a unit was built and
prepared for test, which 1s described
as type L in Table 3.1.

The performance characteristics of
a full-scale radiator were calculated
on the basis of test data obtained for
the core element described as type C
in Table 3.1 (cf., sec. 2, “Experi-
mental Reactor Engineering’). Figure
3.1 shows the performance data 1in the
form of a chart that gives ‘“heating

Nickel fins were assumed 1instead of

of the air temperature rise to the
temperature difference between the air
entering the radiator and the sodium
entering the radiator,

the weight given above, 4256 1lb, 1is

HEAT EXCHANGER DESIGN CHARTS
A. P, Fraas M. E. LaVerne

The OBRNL-ANP liquid-to-liquid heat
exchanger design and development
efforts have been based on a matrix of
closely spaced small-diameter tubes
that permit practically pure counter-
flow operation, This type of matrix

40

has exceptionally good heat transfer
characteristics. In the course of
full-scale aircraft power plant design
work, a number of charts for this type
of heat exchanger has been prepared.
These charts were intended, in part,
to show the effects of the various
parameters in a readily understandable
form and, in part, to simplafy and
reduce markedly the chore of making
detailed design calculations. The
charts, togetherwith brief explanations
and sample calculations to illustrate
their use, have recently been issued.(®
The subjects covered are (1) heat
exchanger matrix geometry, (2) fluid
flow and pressure loss, (3) heat
transfer coefficient, and (4) per-
formance of a series of counterflow
heat exchangers.

4. REACTOR PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen, ANP Division

In the theory of power oscillations
in a circulating-fuel reactor, 1t 1is
now possible to demonstrate the damping
influence of the fuel circulation, even
if some of the previous assumptions
are replaced by considerably more
general conditions. Specifically,
it 15 no longer necessary to assume
that all particles of the fuel spend
the same time in the reactor and that
the fuel and power distributions are
constant over the reactor. The more
general condition (Eq. 1), which
replaces the old assumptions, covers,
among other things, the case in which
the power distribution is constant
only in the direction of flow, but not
necessarily in the direction perpen-
dicular to 1it, and in which there are
a number of alternate fuel paths, each
with a different fuel transit time.

In the field of reactor calcu-
lations, it was found that the slowing
down of neutrons in parallel slabs of
materials with different properties
can be described, under some not too
unrealistic conditions, by a set of
images of the original neutron source.
The images are somewhat similar to
those which would be obtained 1f the
neutron source were replaced by a
light source and the interfaces between
the slabs were replaced by mirrors or
refracting surfaces.

For some time, attempts have be en
made to obtain a better understanding
of the nuclear physics involved in the
temperature coefficient of reactivity.
These attempts have now resulted in an
explicit expression for the tempera-
ture dependence of a macroscopic
absorption cross section., The tempera-
ture dependence is caused by the
thermal motion of the atoms.

Calculations specifically carried
out for the ARE and Fireball Critical
Experiments are reported in connection
with these experiments (Sec. 5).

OSCILLATIONS IN THE CIRCULATING
FUEL REACTOR :

W. K. Ergen, ANP Division

It was shown previously(l) that,
under certain conditions, the circu-
lation of the fuel introduces a damping
of power oscillations of a reactor.
These previous comnsiderations have
since been gemeralized, and the
damping can still be demonstrated,
even if one drops the assumptions that
all particles of the fuel spend the
same time 1in the reactor and that the
flux and power distributions
constant over the reactor.

The delayed neutrons are still
neglected, and it 1s still assumed
that a change AT of the average fuel
temperature T causes an instantaneous
change ~aAT in the reactivity and that
the inlet temperature is constant,
The old assumptions of constant fuel-
transit time and constant flux and
power distribution are replaced by the
much more general condition that

are

where € 1s a positive constant associ-

and P 1s the reactor power. The
kernel K{o) has the property dK/do g 0,
and, for o greater than some fixed
value A, K(o) = 0. The term €P
corresponds to the instantaneous
increase 1n reactor temperature due to
the power generation. The integral

represents the fact that the memory
of the earlier power history 1is
continually “washed out’’ by the
circulation of the fuel, for instance,
because fuel which has “seen’” the
earlier power history leaves the
reactor.

It is convenient to take the inlet
temperature as zero on the temperature

scale. Then Eq. 1 is equivalent to
T = € f G(og) P(t -~ o) do (2)
0
with
G(0) =1 , (3)
G(®) =0 , (4)
dG/do = -K(o) (5)

The second equation describing the
kinetic behavior of the reactor is,
as 1n the previous calculations,

*

P=-2P(T-T,) , (6)

where 7 1s the prompt-neutron gener-
ation time, and T, is the average
temperature the reactor reaches in the
equilibrium state. This state 1is
is characterized by a constant power,

P,.
Limits on the Oscillations. As in
the previous considerations, it is to
be shown first that the power remains
bounded., Since, for ¢ > A, dG/do =
~-K(c) = 0 and G(®) = 0, it follows
that G(o) = 0 for o 2 A. This means,
physically, that the power prevailing
at t ~ A, has no i1nfluence
on the temperature T at time t, for
instance, because all the fuel present
at time t - A, or earlier, has left
the reactor before time t.
-~ A is the time
at which the reactor power passes
through P, and is rising. Eventunally
the reactor heats beyond T,, the
temperature at which P = 0, and then
the power has to start dropping.

or earlier,

Assume now that ¢

The attainment of the temperature
T, and the connected drop in power
have to occur at time t, at the latest,
because, unless the power drops before

42

t, it will have exceeded P, during
the whele time interval t — A to t,
and even P, would have been sufficient
to raise the temperature to T,. This
shows that the power cannot start at
P, and rise continuously for a time
interval in excess of A,

Also, the rate of increase in log
P is limited, as can be seen from
Eq. 3, where the temperature cannot
be less than 0, the inlet temperature,
Since both the rate of increase and
the time of increase are bounded, the
maximum is bounded, too. Furthermore,
if the reactor power stays above P,
for the time A, it has to drop below
P, before it can rise again, because
the temperature could not otherwise
go below T,, When the power has gone
below P, and starts increasing again,
the above argument again holds,

A similar argument shows that the
power has a finite lower limit,
Actually, the limits found by the above
consideration are far wider than the
limit obtained in practice, but they
show that there are no antidamped
oscillations that would increase to
infinity.

Periodic Oscillations. It is now
of interest to determine under what
conditions periodic oscillations of
constant amplitude can occur. For
this purpose, one multiplies Eqs. 1

and 6:

P(t) -—f do K(o) P(t - o) | . (1)

If Eq. 7 is integrated over a period
p of the oscillation, the left side
becomes zero because of the periodi-
city. The same applies to the integral
of

d

The remaining integral is transformed
by partial integration:

Again, because of the periodicity,
the first term on the right has the
same value at ¢ = p and t = 0, and
hence only the second term remains on
the right side. Noting that

At this point, it 1is convenient,
though not essential, to choose the

units of P in such a way that log P
is always positive throughout the
oscillation. This is possible, since
P is bounded below. If log P is always
positive, a theorem(z) regardlng
inequalities becomes applicable. [t
has only to be noted that log P 1s a
monoton increasing function of P. The
theorem states that the expression
in the bracket 1s never negative. [t

is zero only 1f P(t — o) = P(t) for
all t, that is, i1f o is a multiple of
the period p. dK/do was assumed to
be nonpositive; hence, the whole
integral -8 1s £ 0. :

It has been shown before that, for
any periodic oscillation, the integral
over a period of the left side of
Eq. 7 is equal to zero. Hence, the
integral over the right side, which 1is
equal to the integral 8, has to vanish,
too. The condition for this is,
according to the above, that dK/do
vanish, except possibly at the points

where the square bracket in integral 8
vanishes, that 1is, at the points where
o 1s a multiple of the period. At
these points dK/do may even go to ~®
without vielating the condition for
periodic oscillations.,

Speci fic Examples. The previously
considered case of constant transit
time and constant power distribution
is obtained from the above general
case by giving K(o) the specific
values K(og) =1/8 for o <& and K(o) = 0
for o > 6 (compare Eq. 1 with Eq, 2
of ORNL-1227, p. 43,¢!) or Eq. 2 of
Y-F10-109, p, 2(!?), dK/do = 0 at all
points except o = & (where dK/do = —x),
and periodic oscillations persist only
if € is a multiple of the period,

If the power distribution is only
constant in the direction of fuel
flow, but not necessarily 1in the
direction perpendicular to 1it, and if
there are a number of alternate fuel
paths with transit times 6, , 8,, ...,
¢ , respectively, then the above

material that has the same properties
as the reflector. The refracted
source 1is always positive.

That the solutions satisfy, for
their respective regions, the dif-
ferential equations 3 and 4 and that
they also satisfy the boundary con-
ditions 5 and 6 can be shown by direct
substitution. _ f

The constancy of m and n 1s not a
bad assumption in many cases, because
the scattering cross section and,
hence, £ and & are usually constant
over a wide lethargy range. The
constancy of the scattering cross section
is not a necessary condition for the
constancy of m and n. For instance,
if the £’s and u's are constant and
the scattering cross sections in both
media vary in such a way that their
ratio remains constant, m and n would
still remain unchanged. However, there
are few practical examples in which m
and n are constant and the scattering
cross sections vary. The most im-
portant, but somewhat trival, example
1s the case i1n which the two media are
of the same material and differ only
in density. Then the “image source”
will have strength zero. The refracted
source has the strength 1, and there
is the same amount of material between
the refracted source and the boundary
x = 0 as there is between the actual
source and the boundary.

If the macroscopic absorption cross
section 2 is not zero, then the image
method ¢an be applied only in the
somewhat trivial and not very realistic
case in which

An interesting generalization of
the method can be made 1f there are
a number of parallel plane layers of
different properties, with one of the

This generalization can be shown on
the example of Fig. 4.1, Here a

A, D, Callihan, Physics Division

During the past guarter some
inaugural experiments were done on a
critical mockup of the proposed
reflector-moderated aircraft propulsion
reactor, ! and the preliminary results
are reported. The initial experiment
on the reflector-moderated arrangement
was assembled from on-hand materials
and is a correspondingly poor simulation
of the actual reactor., Nevertheless,
the assembly became critical with a
critical mass of 13.5 kg, The flux
distributions obtained show the ex-
pected high thermal flux in the
moderator island and reflector. A
more realistic mockup of the reflector-
moderated reactor

The program of measurements on a
critical assembly simulating the ARE
reactor, described earlier, was com-
pleted, and some of the results are
reported.

the theoretical prediction of high-

theoretically expected, particularly
pronounced for thermal neutrons (the

the indium-foil activation data and
de fined as the ratio of the activation
by neutrons of energy below the cadmium
cut-of f to the activation by all
neutrons, is plotted in Fig. 5.5 for
the horizontal traverse of Fig. 5.3.

values practically coincide in the
center of the fuel and in the bulk of
the reflector. The discrepancy at the
fuel surface is not surprising, since
all practical calculation methods,
including the “age’’ multigroup method,
are not exactly valid near boundaries.

One of the projected measurements
with this assembly was the evaluation
of the regulating and safety rods of
the ARE reactor. It was necessary to
install the rod at the center of the
core, thereby replacing the central
fuel tube and the central column of
BeO. As shown in Fig. 5.7, the removal
of the fuel tube decreased the re-
activity $1.07, Since the BeO column
removal lowered the reactivity an
additional $2.63, 1t became obvious
that the loading was insufficient to
permit a measurement of the rod.

The available excess reactivity was
increased by adding UF, to the fuel
mixture in the stainless steel, thereby
increasing the U?3% density from 0.163
g/cm® to 0,214 g/cm3®. When the fuel

mixture was reloaded in the Be(, the

Similarly, the insertion of the final

the reactivity because of effects

method, which utilizes the prompt

decrease and gives the result in terms
of the effective delayed-neutron
fraction. The rod assembly was mounted
7 1/2 in., from the center of the core,

and both the regulating rods and the
safety rod were measured there. The
following results were obtained: “weak”
regulating rod (0.145 g of B,C per
linear inch), $0.80; “strong” regulating
rod (0.68 g of B,C per linear inch),
$1.60; safety rod, $5.50. _
In the Aircraft Reactor Experiment

assumed that the regulating rod in the
center of the core would be worth 0.4%
in Ak/k, and that the safety rod at a
position 7 1/2 in. from the center of
the core would be worth 5% in Ak/k.
Hence, the regulating rod seems to be
somewhat more effective thannecessary.
The safety rod is somewhat less
effective than was previously assumed,

E, P. Blizard

J. L, Meem, Associate

Physics Division

The Lid Tank Facility has been
applied directly in experiments needed
to solve problems of immediate interest
in the design of the air ducts through
the reactor shield of the GE-Convair
airplane (sec. 6). These experiments
are essential, since the configuration
is so complicated thatit ispractically
impossible to calculate., Neutron and
gamma 1sodoses around mockups of the
GE-ANP inlet and outlet ducts have been
obtained. The data obtained provide
the information necessary for specifi-
cation of the duct shields. In
addition, some measurements have been
made to determine the induced activities
around the duct. The leakage around
an alternate ducting arrangement is
also being measured. |

The Bulk Shielding Facility (sec.7)
has been applied, in part, to further
alr-scattering experiments. Although
these experiments are not yet con-
clusive, indications are that the
earlier experiments gave doses that
were too high; but the designs of the
1950 Shielding Board are not yet com-
pletely vindicated. The BSF has also
been used to extend the spectral and
dose measurements on the NEPA divided-
shield mockup. These data will now be
used to improve the calculation of the
dose at the crew position, Additional
experiments now under way at the BSF
include the irradiation of animals and
the measurement of the energy release
per U**° fission, |

The Tower Shielding Facility (sec.,
8) has been approved and the Laboratory
is committed to a schedule that calls

for completion of comstruction in
November 1953, Detailed engineering
design has been contracted to the
architectural firm of Knappen, Tippetts,
Abbett, McCarthy, who have revised the
tower design to eliminate cantilever
trusses., lhe new design had a signifi-
cantly higher neutron-scattering back-
ground than earlier designs; conse-
quently, alternate designs are now
being studied. Initial tests with the
completed facility, whichwill probably
make use of the GE-Convair shield
design, are scheduled to commence 1in
1954, ]

The nuclear measurement (sec. 10)
studies include an experiment to
determine the angular distribution of
neutrons scattered from nitrogen and a
new calibration of the fast-neutron
dosimeter. The angular distribution
of neutrons was measured by utilizing
the 5-Mev Van de Graaff accelerator.
Analyses of the pulse-height distri-
butions of the nitrogen recoils indi-
cate a definite change in the dif-
ferential cross section of nitrogen
that is associated with the resonance
value and an increase in the forward
scattering. The fast-neutron dosimeter
was ‘“calibrated,” in a bioclogical
sense, at the Zero Power Reactor at
Argonne National Laboratory by taking
advantage of a situation in which a
high fast-neutron dose wasaccidentally
received by an individual. Tt was
found that the ZPR leakage fluxes and
fast-neutron dose readings 1in the
water reflector were quite similar to
those expected from a comparison with

the BSF data.

The Lid Tank Facility has been
applied primarily to a study of air
ducting for the GE-ANP reactor.
Partial mockups of i1nlet and outlet
“annular” ducts have been tested for
neutron and gamma attenuation, The
isodoses wmeasured arocund the ducts
indicate the proper shield shape in
the presence of the ducts.,

In addition, some experiments have
been carried out to determine the
activation of engines, structure, etc.
to be expected from neutrons that leak
out via the ducts., Possible methods
of improving the situation were ex-
plored when 1t was seen that the
activation could be excessive.

Multiple ““wavy’ cylindrical pipes
were also tested as an alternate duct
design. Although these are no doubt
superior to the “annular’ ducts as far
as shielding is concerned, they present
more difficult engineering problems.

G-E OUTLET AIR DUCT

Neutron Dose Measurements. With
the determination of the effect of the
transition section on the fast-neutron
dose and the thermal flux, the measure-
ments on the G-E outlet air duct have
been completed.(!) Figures 6.1 and
6.2 show thermal isodoses made with a
BF, counter and the automatic plotter.
Figure 6.3 gives the results of center-
line measurements with this counter.
Fast-neutron measurements are exhibited

in Figs. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7,
There is a slight discrepancy
between the measurements of thermal
and fast neutrons. The center-line
data should coincide when the relaxation
length exceeds 7.5 cm. The discrepancy
has been attributed to

sensitivity of the BF; counter during
the month-long series of readings.
Unlike the fast neutron dosimeter, this
counter was not recalibrated during
the thermal-neutron experiment.
Despite the suspected slow drift in
sensitivity, the shape of the 1sodoses
should be reliable and should furnish
adequate information on the effect of
the transition section.

Two additional sources of error
should be mentioned. The relays that
operated the 1isodose plotter introduced
a few spurious counts, which caused
the plotter to operate 1 to 2 cm
further from the source than it should
Besides this, the effective
center of counting moved about inside
the detectors, depending upon the
direction of the flux gradient, and
introduced an error in position esti-

mated at not more than 2 cm over the
range from the center line to the
side of the duct.

In repositioning the duct after
changing the transition section, 1t
was inevitable that a slight variation
in the distance from the source axis
should occur. Table 6.1, which gives
the actual coordinates of four points
on the duct identified in Fig. 6.1,
may be used in making precise calcu-
lations - the drawings give only
average position.

Calculated Neutron Dose. A calcu-
lation of the effect of the duct with
no transition section on the center-
line dose has been made with some
success. As can be inferred from the
isodose plots, the center-line dose 1s
not affected much by the side arm of
the duct. The calculation therefore
deals with an 8 1/2-in. air space
(essentially a void) in front of the
source plate.

G-E INLET AIR DUCT

A mockup of the G-E inlet air duct
has been tested in the Lid Tank Facilitw
Some gamma shielding in the form of
slabs of 7/8 in. of iron and 1 1/2 in.
of lead was used to simulate the
design shield along the center line.
In spite of care in choosing from
available slabs of iron and lead, it
was 1mpossible to make the mockup
simulate the actual situation very
closely, As a consequence, caution
should be used in applying the gamma
data to the design.

Thermal- and fast-nentron and gamma
data were taken with the standard Lid
Tank instruments, and the results have
been converted into isodose plots,
Figs., 6.9 and 6.10. It is unfortunate
that the source strength was completely
inadequate to enable measurement of
the fast-neutron dose at the end of
the duct, *

The final step in this experiment
was to study the attenuation of the

INDUCED ACTIVITY AROUND A DUCT

An experiment has been performed 1n
the Lid Tank Facility with the primary
object of determining the order of
magnitude of the induced radioactivity
to be expected outside the air ducts
in the GE-ANP initial engine shield.
In addition, 1t was desired to estimate
the value of thin boron shields in
lowering this activity, to investigate
the utility of BF,-counter measurements
in predicting activation, and to
determine the effect of borating the
shield water around the ducts,

The mockup of the G-E outlet azir
duct that had been previously tested(®)
was modified by the addition of a tank
so that borated water could be placed
around the duct. Figure 6,12 shows
the configuration. The outside of
this tank simulated the outside of the
design shield. Measurements were made
at the end and the side of the duct,
as indicated in Fig. 6.12.

Two types of measurements were
undertaken: samples of cobalt and
manganese were exposed and their
activities measured, and traverses
were made with a BF3 counter. In all
cases, various thermal-neutron shields
were used, and the results were com-
pared with unshielded measurements,
Data were obtained with both pure and
borated water around the duct.

The induced activities under various
conditions are tabulated in Table 6.2,
and the results of the counter traverses
are presented graphically in Figs.
6.13, 6.14, 6.15, and 6.16. Figure

line traverses with no duct in the

around the counter.

Since the activation measurements
were of an exploratory nature, a com-
plete investigation ofall combinations
of parameters was not attempted. The
samples were prepared hurriedly, and
therefore errors of 30% are to be
expected from differences in the
geometry of exposure and counting. In
the low flux available in this experi-
ment, the cobalt did not become radio-
active enough to afford an accurate
measurement of its activity,

The various ratios of counting
rates are given in Tables 6.3, 6.4,
and 6.5, which show, respectively, the

effect of thermal shields, acomparison
between the counting rates at the side
and end of the duct, and the effect
of borating the shield water.

It is apparent that a thin boron
layer is far more effective 1in shield-
ing the boron counter than inshielding
either manganese or cobalt. This 1is
to be expected, since an 1important
part of the activation of the latter
is due to resonance absorption at
epithermal energies where the boron
cross secticn is relatively low,

The variously shielded detectors
are senslitive to different neutron
energies, and therefore an indication
of the comparative neutron spectra at
the side and the end of the duct can
be obtained by comparing the counting
rates under these conditions. When the
expected experimental errors are con-
sidered, there does not seem to be
evidence of significant differences 1in
the spectra at these two positions.
With pure water in the tank, there are
more epithermal neutrons than thermal
neutrons; or looking at the situation
from the opposite viewpoint, the ducts
increased the thermal flux. Under
these conditions, a conservative
estimate can be made of the expected
activation around a ducted shield from
the readings of a BF, counter, provided
an experimental comparison has been
made at some point without ducts.

It was at first a surprise to find
that adding boron to the shield water

increased the flux of epithermal
neutrons by about 25%. However, calcu-
lations of the amount of water dis-
placed in adding the boron showed that
the result is gquite reasonable. The
borated water contained 1.005 wt %
boron and 1.7 wt % potassium and had a
specific gravity of 1.0403. Thus,
there was a displacement of 1.3% of
the hydrogen, which resulted in higher
epithermal flux. The thermal neutrons
were naturally greatly reduced by the
boron. However, placing a thin layer
of boron at the surface of the shield
would eliminate thermal neutrons with-
out displacing so much water,

RADIATION AROUND AN ABRAY OF
CYLINDRICAL DUCTS

Previous measurements of the radi-
ation around mockups of the annular
air ducts for the G-E reactor showed
that these ducts will permit the
escape of a large flux of fast neutrons
through the sides of the shield.
Furthermore, this annular duct con-
figuration is undesirable because of

In view of these

sections 22 1in. long connected with
45-deg bends. 1In the plane of the
source plate, the centers of the
pipes define equilateral triangles
with sides 7.33 1in. long. Since the

angle of 22.5 deg to the normal, the

The radiation measurements around

siderable detail. An analysis of the
results shows that the gamma dose can

be accurately computed by considering
the ducts and water to be a homogeneous
shield of appropriately reduced density.
The neutrons, however, stream through
the ducts in sufficient numbers to
increase the flux at the end to one or
two orders of magnitude greater than
that predicted on a reduced density
basis. This is in accordance with the
duct theory proposed by Simon and
Clifford, that is, geometrical attenu-
ation along the straight sections and
inverse sine reflection at the bends.
The design of this particular array is
not optimum, since the attenuation
through the ducts is not high enough
to exceed that through the equivalent
amount of water, An optimum design
might have another bend in the ducts
to 1ncrease their attenuation, or
closer spacing between ducts to further

reduce the density of the equivalent

homogeneous shield.

Gamma-ray spectral measurements on
the divided-shield mockup have been
extended, and the neutron and gamma
dose measurements on the shield mockup
are reported. The air-scattering
experiments with the reactor at 100 kw
are now under way, and the program of
irradiating monkeys with the reactor
has been started.

MEASUREMENTS WITH THE DIVIDED-SHIELD
MOCKUP

Two further sets of measurements of
gamma-Tay energy spectra and angular
distributions from the divided-shield
mockup (with lead disks) were made
after a preliminary attempt by the NDA
group to calculate the dose to be
expected at the crew position. The
measurements were made at iy = 60 deg,
6 = variable, (!’ and ¥ = 60 deg, ¢ =
variable., The energy spectra obtained
are shown in Figs, 7.1 and 7.2, and
the angular distribution for the angle
g is in Fig. 7.3. For all
measurements, the spectrometer col-
limator remained horizontal,

Table 7.1 shows all gamma-ray
spectral measurements completed since
the last tabular summary.(?) It 1s ex-
pected that the information is now
sufficiently complete to enable an
accurate calculation of gamma dose at
the crew position.

trometer. The angle & for the measure-
ments with ¢ = 60 deg and ¥ = 0 was
determined so that the spectrometer
collimator would always look at the
edge of the lead disks in the divided-
shield mockup.

Center-line measurements of gamma-
ray and fast-neutron dosages and also
thermal-neutron flux have been com-
pleted and are shown in Figs. 7.4, 7.5,
and 7.6. The attenuation curves are
shown with and without the shield in
place. It should be remembered that
for these measurements the reactor had
a beryllium oxide reflector. (3’ The
dashed curves on Figs. 7.4, 7.5, and
7.6 represent the center-line data(*’
with the water-reflected reactor.

AIR-SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS

The air-scattering experiments with
the reactor at a power of 100 kw are
well under way, Indications are that
the previous measurements, reported
last quarter, were somewhat pessimistic,
but confirmation of the ANP-53 shield
design{®) is not yet clear. It is to
be expected that these experiments
will soon be concluded, since the BSF
1s poorly adapted to air-scattering
measurements.

has been made on measuring neutron

Design of the tower configuration
and the necessary hoisting equipment
has been contracted to the firm of
Knappen, Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy,
architectural engineers of New York,
and is to be completed by Februwary 1,
1953, The basic tower configuration
and location are to be established
definitely by December 1, at which
time ORNI. will complete plans for the
services, the building, and site
improvement. The neutron-scattering
background for the tower designed
by the architectural engineers 1is

significantly higher than for earlier
designs; consequently, aiternate
designs are being studied.

FACILITY DESIGN

After making a study of the geologi-
cal conditions affecting the foun-
dations, the KTAM engineers relocated
the tower site tothe top of the knoll,
a few hundred feet from the previous
location. The tower configuration is
now conceived to be a four-legged,
guyed structure. Such a structure was
chosen by KTAM to eliminate the large
cantilever trusses used inthe previocus
designs. The guying should also
appreciably reduce the weight of the
structure, and hence the cost. Pre-
liminary estimates obtained by KTAM of
the cost of the required hoisting
equipment are gratifyingly low.

All the electrical components of
the reactor control and instrumentation

have been chosen and are being ordered
in accordance with estimated delivery
dates. Engineering of the mechanical
portions of the reactor controls, tank,
and accessories 1s approximately 75%
complete. Engineering of the reactor
control system is being executed by
the Reactor Controls group. The
engineering of the experimental equip-
ment, which is assigned to the Instru-
ment Department, is approximately 20%
complete and 1s expected to be com-
pleted by March 1953.

The project for development of a
more sensitive fast-neutron dosimeter
is progressing satisfactorily., A flow
type of counter that uses ahot-calcium
purifier for the ethylene gas shows
sensitivities better than twice those
of the types in use at present.

STRUCTURE SCATTERING

A. Simon, Physics Division

The background from neutrons
scattered by the tower structure is
being calculated for each configuration
according to methods(!) developed at
the laboratory during the original
design period. In addition, the tower
is being made sufficiently flexible so
that this background will be measurable
directly.

The cosine of the center of mass
angle of scattering of the neutron 1is
plotted in Fig. 9.1 on the same
horizontal scale as the recoil energy.
The ordinate is thus proportional to
the differential scattering cross
section in the center of mass system.(l)
The rise in the cross section at low
angles is believed to be real and due
to shadow scattering. This is being
investigated further.

Several distributions taken ingoing
over the 1,595-Mev resonance’*®) show
marked change in the differential cross
section associated with the peak of
the resonance.(®) Forward scattering
of the neutrons becomes more pronounced
at the resonance.

The dose received at the crew
position from air-scattered neutrons
will vary directly with the cross
section if this scattering is isotropic.
I1f it is not, then the dose will vary
in a quite complicated way with the
“distribution of cross section,” and
therefore it is essential to know the
angular distribution of the scattered
neutrons. For this purpoese, the
differential scattering cross section
of nitrogen, as opposed to 1ts total

sectlion, must be
forward-scattered

scattering cross
measured. The
neutrons contribute essentially nothing
to the flux i1incident on the crew
shield, but the neutrons scattered
through angles greater than about 30
deg are very important., Fortunately,
the experiment is most reliable in
this region, as will be seen from in-
spection of Fig. 9.1,

military dose for one mission in fast
nevtrons (25 rem), in addition to an
even larger gamma dose. Since the
total power released in the “runaway”
critical assembly was quite well
measured, it was possible, by setting
up the experiment again, te run at
controlled power levels and measure
the dose in the position occupied by
the individual most seriously affected.
From these measurements it is possible
to determine the dose received by the
individual in terms of a reading on
the Hurst fast-neutron dosimeter.
Since this instrument is basic to all
measurements at this Laboratory,
direct “calibration” at a near-serious
dose level 1s very important. Conse-
quently, one of the ORNL dosimeters
was taken to ANL for measuring the
dose in the reconstructed situation.
It was operated by a member of the
OBNL shielding group to ensure that
the measuring technique was identical
to that used 1n the ORNL program.

The ZPR is a hydrogen-moderated,
cylindrical reactor with an 8-in,
water reflector. Since this is much
like the Bulk Shielding Reactor, it
would be expected to give quite similar
leakage fluxes, as was observed.
Figure 9.2 is a schematic sketch of
the reactor and shows the vertical
line (labeled *z”), about 7 in. from
the core axis, on which the data were
taken. The dosimeter could not be
placed closer to the core axis, since
the only location large enough was
pre-empted by a control rod. Measure-
ments taken in the 8-in. waterreflector
and 1n the air above the reflector are
shown in Fig. 9.3; all data have been
normalized to a power of 1 watt in

with a polonium-beryllium source, and
gamma suppression was adjusted to 10

to be expected in the region above the
reactor.

The fast-neutron dose readings in
the water reflector corresponded
almost exactly to those to be expected
from scale-up of BSF data. However,
the measurements 1in air may have been
somewhat high owing to scattering from
the personnel platform and control
mechanisms. ‘

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION

The research on fused fluoride
systems {(sec. 10) led to the selection
of the fuel and a charging technique
for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.
As now planned, the ARE fuel will be a
NaF-ZrF,-UF, mixture with a composition
of 50-46-4 mole %. Development of
laboratory-scale, pilot-plant, and
production-size facilities for making

the carrier for this fuel, or some
modification of it, continues. The
final mixture would be made 1n the

reactor by the addition of NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(50-25-25 mole %) charge material to
the NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %) carrier
material with which the reactor would
be initially loaded. For the longer
range fuel development program, fluoride
systems containing LiF, ZrF_ , AlF,, or
BeF,, singly or in combination, are
being examined.

The corrosion research (sec., 11)
has been directed primarily toward the
determination of the corrosion charac-
teristics of the fluorides (in par-
ticular, the ZrF,-bearing mixtures)
and secondarily to a study of hydroxide
and liquid metal corrosion. All
studies are made at temperatures
around 1500°F, The increased attack
experienced in recent tests with the
Zr¥,-bearing fuel mixtures is of
particular concern; the attack is to a
depth of about 9 to 10 mils after
500 hours. Although this depth of
~attack 1s tolerable, the trend is not;
" the increased attack is believed to be
due to the use of the newly installed
pilot-plant eguipment in which the
fuel was prepared. The beneficial
~effect of small additions of ZrH, as a
"corrosion inhibitor has been again
demonstrated in the thermal convection
loop, whereas additions of NaK have
not had so pronounced an effect.
‘Dynamic corrosion tests with lead in
thermal convection loops resulted in
"severely corrosive attack on Inconel
above 500°C, even though deoxidized

lead was employed. The stability of
beryllium oxide in NaK has not yet
been thoroughly investigated. Under
the conditions of some of the initial
tests, significant beryllium oxide
weight losses occurred. The effects
of various additions to hydroxides
were studied, but no decrease in cor-
rosion was obtained. The maintenance
of a positive hyvdrogen atmosphere is
still the only certain technique for
minimizing hydroxide corrosion.

The metallurgy and ceramics research
(sec. 12) 1ncludes the development of
spherical, solid, fuel elements; creep-
rupture tests of structural metal;
welding and brazing techniques; and
cermets and ceramic coatings. Alloys
for cone-arc welding, resistance weld-
ing, heliarc welding, and high-
temperature brazing have been suc-
cessfully developed for high-tempera-
ture-corrosion resistance and structural
integrity of brazed joints. In creep-
rupture tests at 815°C, Inconel and
stainless steel indicated decreasing
lifetimes in argon and hydrogen
environments as compared with the
lifetimes in air. The manufacture of
spherical, solid, fuel elements,
requested by Pratt and Whitney, is
being attempted by several techniques.
Cermets of Cr-A1,0, and ZrC-Fe have
been developed and are being tested
for corrosion resistance. A dipping
technique has been developed for the
application of oxidation-resistant
ceramic coating to nickel radiator
fins.

The heat transfer and physical
property measurements have beendirected
almost entirely toward the determination
of the various properties of several
fluoride mixtures (sec. 13). The
viscositlies and densities of the fuel
carrier, NaF-ZrF_ , and the enriched
fuel, NaF-ZrF,-UF,, have been measured.
Although these fluoride mixtures have
comparable melting points (about 510°C)

103
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

and densities (between 3 and 4 at
800°C), the viscosity of the fuel 1is
significantly higher than that of the
carrier (about 8 vs. 13 cp at 800°C),
In general, it appears that the thermal
conductivities of fluoride mixtures
decrease and the viscosities increase
with an i1ncrease in the uranium
fluoride content, The heat transfer
coefficient for the eutectic mixture,
NaF-KF-LiF, in turbulent flow may be
described by the usual expressions for
ordinary fluids. In other studies,
the flow rates in convection loops are
being determined, and thermal analyses
are being made of areflector-moderated
reactor system and the heat transfer
characteristics of a circulating-fuel
system.

Radiation damage studies were con-
cerned primarily with the exposure of
samples of fluoride fuel in the various
irradiation facilities (sec. 14),
Other studies included in-pile sodium
loop and in-pile creep measurements,
A capsule of fluoride fuel has been
irradiated in the MTR at a flux level
in the range of that of an aircraft

104

reactor, but the capsule and its con-
tents have not yet been examined,.

Short-time, high-power-dissipation
(up to 4000 watts/cm?) irradiations in
the cyclotron suggest that some radi-
ation-induced corrosion damage may
exist. HRecent in-pile cantilever-
creep measurements of Inconel in an
air atmosphere indicate that the LITR
radiation has little effect on creep

strength.
Analytical

materials (sec.
spectrographic,

studies of reactor
15) included chemical,
and petrographic
corrosion
and

identification of impurities,
products, reduction products,
constituents of reactor fuels. An
empirical volumetric method for the
determination of zirconium has been
developed. Improved tests have also
been developed for the determination
of aluminum and chrowmium in fluorides.
The mass spectrograph in combination
with a high-temperature (up to 2850°C)
oven will detect with high precision
the presence of uranium oxides,
Petrographic studies have led to the
classification of many complex com-
pounds not found in the literature.

CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

The main effort of the ANP Chemistry
group has been devoted to studies of
fluoride mixtures for use as fuels and
coolants for possible use in an
aircraft reactor. The development of
a fuel suitable for use in the ARE
appears to have been achieved with the
NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) mixture.
Accordingly, more attention has been
devoted during recent weeks to the
longer range objectives of development
of fuels with improved properties.

Since there is reason to believe
that low-melting-point systems of
superior quality will be obtained,
despite the isotope separation re-
qulrements, consliderable attention
has been focused on phase equilibriums
among systems containing lithium
fluoride, In addition, systems
containing‘ZrF4, AlFS,:and BeF, are
being studied, and some work has been
initiated on systems containing UC1,.

Studies of systems containing UF,,
which seems to be a by-product 1in
some of the corrosion reactions of
the fuel, have been continued. Synthe-
sis of some materials that contain
trivalent uranium and that seem to be
identical to compounds produced in
corrosion studies has been accomplished.

Research on liquid fuels and their
production in highly pure form on a
pilot-plant scale have continued to be
a major function of the ANP Chemistry
group. The production of the large
quantities of these materials needed
for engineering testing 1s a joint
responsibility of this group and the
Experimental Engineering group. The
base material (NaZrF,) for the ARE
fuel 1s to be prepared in equipment
that is scheduled for completion in
mid-December.

Tubes of simulated fuel mixture
were supplied for the ARE cold critical
experiment by the Y-12 Production
Division, along with one tube filled

with slugs of the actual fuel compo-
sition, Efforts to i1dentify the
chemical species in the cooled melts
before and after corrosion testing
were continued. Studies were expanded
on reducing agent additions to various
fluoride mixtures and on the resultant
reactions. Preliminary results have
indicated that small additions of
NaK, Zr, or ZrH2 may have beneficial
effects on the corrosion of structural
metals. - These additions have been
shown to cause harmful reduction of
the UF, in the fuel when made in
larger quantities. Phase equilibrium
studies of systems centaining UF, have
been continued as a part of this
program. The reactions obtained by
addition of reducing agents to possible
fuel or coolant materials are being
studied in considerable detail by
means of a combination of x-ravy,
petrographic, spectrographic, and
chemical examinations.

cerning the possibility of there being
two immiscible liquids below 470°C
in this system., Filtration studies
with this material seem to discount
this hypothesis, since there 1is
evidence of a steady decrease 1in
uranium concentration in the filtrate
as the temperature is reduced below
500 °C.

It seems likely that in this system
in which thermal effects are apparently
quite small, the methods used are not
sufficiently sensitive to detect the
first separation of a solid phase on
cooling or the ‘““end of melting® on
heating of the mixture.
Studies of this system,
as attempts to improve
techniques,

as well
the research
are continuing at present.

yielded the thermal data shown in

It appears that the lowest melting
point in this region (415°C) is
probably that of the quaternary
euatectic. Much more data will be
needed to establish the compositions
in the lowsmelting-point region; it
is likely, however, that the uranium

low.

techniques and the virtual absence
of segregation on slow cooling of
very large preparations of this
material, indicate that the areca
between llquldus and solidus lines 1n
the dilute solid solution region (and
differences in composition of the two
solid solutionsin equilibrium) must be
very small. In uranium-rich regions
of this diagram, however, the situation
is considerably different, and segre-
gation of phases of considerably
different composition would not be
surprising. Additional study of this
system is being emphasized at present.

Thermal data for a number of binary
chloride systems containing UCl, or
UCl, mixed with various alkali and
alkaline earth chlorides have been
reported previously.{(!) In the
previous work, only the binary systems
of the uranium compounds with NaCl and
KC1l were studied in sufficient detail
to permit construction of equilibrium
diagrams. The eutectics shown for the
NaCl-UCl, and the KC1-UCl, systems
melt at much lower temperatures

(370 and 350°C, respectively) than do

the corresponding fluoride eutectics.
Although the eutectics reported for
UCl, with these materials have higher
melting points than those of the
corresponding UCl, systems, they still
compare favorably with the fluorides.
The high vapor pressure of UCl, will
present obvious difficulties in the
use of these mixtures at very high
temperatures; however, the vapor
pressure of the mixtures containing
UC1l, should be
favorable.
Preliminary studies have shown
that some refinements 1n technique
will be required before the very
hygroscopic and reactive UCl, can be
handled in the apparatus without being
contaminated. Graphite crucibles were
found to be quite permeable to UCI,

considerably more
vapor; however, nickel vessels have
been satisfactory. For satisfactory
operation, the nickel vessels must be
loaded in helium dry boxes, and a dry
helium atmosphere must be maintained
over the samples at all times.

The available UCl, has served for
preliminary experiments for defining
the techniques; however, the Cl-to-U
ratio of 3.9 and the low melting point
of 5365°C (literature value for pure
UCl, is 590 + 1°C) make this material
unsuitable as a standard for study.
This material will be sublimed under
vacuum and subsequently handled under
dry, inert atmospheres to provide
pure UCl, for future studies. _

Preliminary data have been obtained,
meanwhile, on NaCl-UCl, mixtures. The
eutectic and eutectoid halts reported
by Kraus¢!) have, in general, been
confirmed, Actual data will be
reported when pure materials become
available. '

Preliminary results of studies of
alkali fluoride-uranium trifluoride
systems were reported previously.(?)
The effort in this field was concen-
trated on the NaF-UF;, and KF-UF,
binary systems during the past quarter.

Data were obtained with two types
of apparatus: the large vacuum-~tight
apparatus previously described¢?} and
small welded stainless steel reactors
fitted with a thin-walled thermocouple
well 1in the center. In order to
assure an inert atmosphere, the
fluoride mixture was introduced into
the reactor through a 1/4-in. tube,
and the reactor was evacuated at room
temperature, filled with inert gas,
and then sealedby pinching and welding
the tube. Mixing of the contents of
the reactor was accomplished by

inverting after it had been heated
enough to bring all the material into
solution. The mixture was not stirred
during the cooling cycle,.

A comparison was made of cooling
curves for the same composition 1in
the two types of apparatus. The
thermal effects occurred at about the
same temperature with both types of
apparatus, but the breaks were some-
what better defined with the small
reactor. This is probably due to
better contact between the thermocouple
and melt in this apparatus and to the
smaller heat capacity of the thin-
walled thermocouple well. The thermal
data were supplemented by examination
of the solid phases by means of the
petrographic microscope and, for a
limited number of samples, by x-ray
diffraction techniques.

NaF-UF,. Cooling curves have been
run on mixtures covering the range
from 5 to 85 mole % UF;. It was

observed that the cooling curve breaks,
except for the lowest break at about
590°C, seemed to decreaseupon prolonged
heating at elevated temperatures.
This change in thermal effects ap-
parently results from the development
of UF, and/or U0, in the melt. Both
products are found 1n the fused
material, in which the UF, is combined
with NaF., An intensive effort was
made to find the source of the oxygen
and to eliminate it from the system;
but, to date, this effort has not
been entirely successful, and some
doubt exists as to the accuracy of
the thermal data that have been ob-
tained. However, several conclusions
about the system seem warranted:

1. A compound is formed between
NaF and UF,. 1t is lavender in color,
uniaxial positive, and hasa refractive
index for the ordinary ray of 1.552
and for the extraordinary ray of
1.564,¢%)

2. The most probable composition
for the compound, based on both thermal

data and examination of the solid
phases, is 3NaF-2UF;. This composition
could be in error because of the
presence of U'* in the melts, as
mentioned above.

3. A eutectic exists between NakF
and the compound, which 1s probably
close to 27 mole % UF,, and it melts
at approximately 685°C.

The data obtained with mixtures
containing more than 50 mole % UF,
do not fit any recognizable pattern.
The significance of the break at
approximately 590°C, whichwas observed
with all compositions in this system,
is still not clear. Further work
toward solving these problems 1s 1in
progress.

KF-UF;. Tt is clear that a complex
compound between KF and UF; is formed
and that a eutectic between KF and the
compound melting at approximately
690°C occurs at about 18 mole % UF,.

The solid phases have not been thoroughly
studied, and the optical properties
of the compound have not been de-
termined. Study of this system will
be resumed when the oxidation phe-
nomenon mentioned above has been
brought under control.

Halts at the minimum melting tempera-
ture of 360°C were not observed for
other compositions; apparently these
materials are completely miscible in
the solid state. :

Attempts have been made to obtain
phase equilibrium data in the NaBF,-
NaUF, and NaBF, -NaZrF, systems, with
little success. Mixtures of these
materials were heated, in each experi-
ment, to temperatures up to 800°C,
where BF, pressures were about 100 psi,
before the cooling curves were recorded.
Although the data are quite incomplete,
1t appears that more than 5 mole % of
either compound raises the melting
point of NaBF, considerably. There
is some evidence for eutectics at
about 360°C in each system at quite
low uranium and zirconium concen-
trations. Actual compositions of the
eutectics have not been established.

DIFFERENTIAL THERMAL ANALYSIS
R. E. Traber, Jr.

Materials Chemistry Division

The differential thermal analysis
apparatus for l- to 2-g samples was
used regularly during the quarter for
the careful examination of important
compositions, for testing samples that

TABLE 10. 2. THERMAL EFFECTS OBSERVED

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

were availableonly in small quantities,
and for searching for thermal effects
that are difficult to find with the
coocling-curve technigue. The apparatus
has been found to have limited appli-
cationin the study of reduced systems,
such as those containing UF,. Although
a flowof purified heliumwas maintained
in the apparatus, the erratic behavior
of the differential trace obtained
when the reduced samples were heated
was appavently due to oxidation,
Examination of the solid phases re-
maining at the end of the tests showed
that oxidation had occurred. Some
difficulties that were experienced
with the electrical system may be
attributed, at least in part, to the
high sensitivity of the system.

Table 10.2 summarizes the thermal
effects observed with differential
apparatus for a number of compositions
of current interest. The temperatures

at which the differential trace begins
to leave the base line, reaches a

peak, and returns to the base line are
recorded. Where more than one “hump”
was observed in the differential
trace, only that at the higher temper-
ature is included in the table. 1t
should be noted that the temperature

is usually higher than the melting
point of the composition determined
from the cooling curve. This may be
due to the time required to melt all
the sample, and the difference between
the two values 1s probably a function
of the heating rate.

An effort is under way to increase
the sensitivity of the differential
thermocouple arrangement so that a
very slight thermal effect may be
found, such as that which apparently
was overlooked in the NakF-BeF, -UF,
fuel mixture (discussed previously
in this chapter).

SIMULATED FUEL FOR COLD CRITICAL
EXPERIMENT

D. R. Cuneo J. D. Redman
.. G. Overholser

Materials Chemistry Division

Filling the fuel tubes with homo-
geneous powder containing Z4r0,, NaF,
UF,, and graphite was accomplished
in the manner described previously.(3)
One tube was required, however, 1in
which the fuel density was uniform
and at least equal to the ARE fuel and
in which the fuel had the proper
Na:Zr:U ratio.

Attempts to cast slugs of this
material by heating premelted powder
of the proper composition under inert
atmospheres 1in graphite molds were
not successful. Only the bottom 1l to
2 in. of an B8-in. section so formed
was free from “pipes.” Re-use of the
material from the porous sections
led to considerable fractionation
because of segregation during the slow
cooling.

The slugs were prepared 1in Building
9212 by melting the premelted fuel by
induction heating under an 1nert
atmosphere, pouring the liquid into
10 -in. molds, and rapidly cooling the
casting, Slugs prepared in this
fashion were free from pipes over
about 8 in, of length and had uniform

length,

The slugs were cut with an electri-
cally heated knife and wrapped 1in
0.25-m1i]1] aluminum foil. A total of
41.5 in. of this material, which
contained (by weight) 74.0% ZrF,,
17.2% NaF, and 8.82% UF,, was supplied
to the Critical Experiment group. The
material had a density of 3.75 g/cm?
at room temperature.

In addition, tubes were filled with
$10,, NaF, KF, and Cr for danger

coefficient measurements.

COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

L. M. Bratcher C. J. Barton
Materials Chemistry Division

No new coolant components were
considered during the quarter except
Ban,which proved unattractive because
of the high melting point of the
eutectic in the one system studied.
Studies of systems containing AlF,,
ZrF,, and BeF, continuned.

NaF-Zrf,. Study of the complicated
and important binary system NaF-ZrF,
has been in progress for some time.
Early studies were complicated by
the formation of oxide that caused
error in the calculation of compositions
and resulted in the appearance of
thermal effects above the melting
points of the pure fluoride mixtures,
Some data on this system have been
presented 1in previous reports, (8
Although further study i1s necessary to
more clearly define the composition of
the solid phases in certain portions
of the system, the location of the
liguidus line 1s believed to be
sufficiently well established to
justify the publication ofthe tentative
equilibrium diagram for the system,

other alkali fluoride-zirconium
fluoride systems that have been
studied. The minimum-melting-point
composition appears to be close to
50 mole % ZrF,, with a melting point
of about 510°C. The solid phases in

NaF-BaF,. The alkaline earth
fluorides have received comparatively
little consideration as possible
components of fuels and coolants,
mainly because of their high melting
points Since data on the NaF-BaF,
system apparently have not been
published, a few compositions were
tested to determine the minimum
melting point. The data indicate that
this is a simple eutectic system; the
eutectic at approximately 35 mole %
BaF, melts at about 820°C. This is
much too high to be of interest.

The KF-BaF, eutectic has been reported
to melt at 750°C. Therefore the
NaF-KF-BaF, ternary seems unlikely

to yield usefully low melting points.

NaF -KF-~LiF-ZrF, Increasing amounts
of ZrF, were added to the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic (11.5, 42.0, and 46.5 mole %,
respectively). After a slight initial
decrease 1in melting point of about
7°C at 2 mole % ZrF,, the melting
point increased quite rapidly to
680°C at 10 mole % and reached a
maximum of 715°C at 20 mole % ZrF,
This indicates that if molten NaF-KF-~
LiF eutectic 1s used to trap ZrF,
vapors from the ARE, as has been
suggested, either the concentration of
ZrF, would have to be kept low or the
temperature would have to be maintained
above 700°C to keep solids from
forming. _ . .

NaF-RbF-AIF, Meltlng points of
all the compos1t10ns tested in the
NaF-RbF-AlF, system (about 40) were
substantlally higher than the minimum
melting point observed in the RbF-AlF,
system (525°C).

STUDIES OF COMPLEX FLUORIDE PHASES

Several new complex fluorides have
been prepared to assist in the identi-
fication of various materials found
at the conclusion of static and dynamic
corrosion tests. The complexes of
the alkali fluorides with trivalent
chromium have been studied in detail

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 16, 1952

because one such complex, K,NaCr¥,,
had been previously identified as
being present in a loop test. The
complex fluorides synthesized in these
studies have been i1dentified or
characterized by chemical analyses,
x~-ray diffraction patterns, and optical
crystallographic data. Although in
most instances the sealed capsule
technique was used for the preparation
of these samples, 1n some cases welded
tubes similar to those used for static
corrosion tests were employed, with a
concomitant reduction in oxide for-
mation. The density and solubility
of several of the complexes have been
determined, and the data are given
in Table 10.3.

K,CrF -Na,CrF -Li CrF
and L. G. Overholser, Materials

fication of compounds in the system

virtually completed. A constitution
diagram based on x-ray diffraction
data supplied by H. Dunn and interpreted
with help from A. G, H, Andersen is

Na,CrF, and Na,LiCrF, are the limits
of one solid solutlon region, and
K,NaCrF_, K3Na3(CrP6)2 and KNaLiCrF,
are the limits of another such area.

formed by traces of ox1dants in the
system. Since NaF can "steal” ZrF,

from UF -2ZrF,, apparently NaZrFs is a
more stable compound than the UF;'2ZrF,

complex. The 2ZrF, -UF, compound has
been found in loops in which there was
severe reduction of the UF, in the
fuel because of the injection of Nak,
and alsoin capsules in which zirconium
metal or NaK had been added to the
fuel.

solid phases Na,ZrF, and NaZrF, have
been reported previously.(1?) Studies
of the behavior of the phases that
appear in compositions lying between
these two compounds and of those that
lie beyond the NaZrF, compositions are
being made; considerable additional
study will be required, since the

Other Fluoride Complexes (B. J.
Sturm and .. G. Overholser, Materials
Chemistry Division). It was previously
noted that a preparation corresponding
to K,NaFeF, was thought to be iso-
morphous with K,NaCrF . Further study
has shown that Na,FeF_, and K,Fel,
apparently form solid solutions over a
wide range, probably 1nall proportions.
X-ray patterns for materials corre-
sponding to K, FeF,, K,NaFeF, K, Na(Feky),,
and KNa ,FeF_  differ only by slight
shifts 1n lines.

Fusion of equal wolar proportions
of KHF,, NaHF,, and NiF, -4H,0 at 850°C
resulted ina yellow compound, probably
KNaNiF,. A fusion in the proportions
corresponding to K,Na(NiF,), gave a
mixture of K,NiF, and KNaNiF,. Heating
a mixture of KNiF;+1%H,0 (prepared
from aqueous solution) and NH,F, at
700°C yielded a product that agrees
with the ASTM x-ray diffraction data
for anhydrous KNiF,,

Interaction of chromium metal with
K,NiF, at 850°C for 5 hr resulted
in the formation of K,CrF_ by the
following reaction:

This behavior is comparable to that

previously noted for displacement of

REACTIONS OF FLUORIDE MIXTURES
WITH REDUCING AGENTS

W. R, Grimes
Materials Chemistry Division

L. A. Mann
ANP Division

The reactions of possible ARE fuel
mixtures with reducing agents were
first examined in an effort to evaluate
the damage that would result i1f NaK
were inadvertently admitted to the
fuel circuit during operation. Identi-
of the products 1n these
complex mixtures was shown to bea very
difficult problem. Hecently, however,
it has been demonstrated that addition
of reducing agents to the fluoride
melts decreases the corrosion by these
materials. Since production of UF,
and the consequent precipitation of
uranium at high temperature can result
from excessive addition of reductant,
a careful studyof the fluoride systems
under reducing conditions has been
undertaken.

Reducing Power of Various Additives
(J. C, White, Analytical Chemistry
Division). The total reducing power
of reaction products resulting from
the addition of NaK to such materials
as ZrF,, NalF, and UF, and such mixtures
as Nab-ZrF, -UF, and NaF-ZrF, has
been measured by two methods: (1) oxi-
dation with standard ceric sulfate
solution and (2) hydrogen evolution
from dissolution in mineral acid.
The validity of these procedures has
been verified by using control samples,
such as UF; and Zr. 1In practically
none of the NaK addition tests,
however, has a reducing action eqguiva-
lent to the amount of NaK added been
observed.

This reduction phenomenon has also
been obhserved when UF, has been added
to NaF and ZrF, and treated as in fuel
preparation. One compound, Na,U)F,,
gave nearly the theoretical amount
of UF, added.

Several samples of fuels that had
undergone corrosion testing were

fication
arbitrarily selected and the total
reducing power determined by the
ceric sulfate oxidation procedure,
Since UF, was the only reductant
(with respect to ceric sulfate) known
to be present in these fuels, the
reducing power was calculated as total
uranium and compared with the value
obtained from oxidation with ferric
sulfate solution.

All the values obtained by ceric{IV)
oxidation are higher than those ob-
tained by ferric(III) oxidation.
Since ferric(IIIl) oxidizes only
uranium(IV) in this instance, other
oxidizable species that have not been
identified satisfactorily must be
present in rather appreciable quanti-
ties. ' |

Identificationof Reduction Products
(F. F. Blankenship, D. C. Hoffman,
Materials Chemistry Division; K. J.
Kelly, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft
Corporation; T. N, McVay, Consultant,
Metallurgy Division). HBeduction
products have been obtained by sealing
the fluoride mixture to be tested,
usually either the ARE fuel (50 mole %
NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,, 4 mole % UF,)
or NaZrFS, in capsules of type 316
stainless steel with the desired
quantity of reducing agent and heating
the capsules for 16 hr in the tilting
furnace. 1In these tests, NaK, Zr,
and ZrH2 were added in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8
equivalents (1 equivalentis the amount
required in theory to reduce the UF,
to UF,). All samples were rocked
with the hot end of the capsule at
800°C and the cold end at 650°C,
After this heating, they were heated
to 800°C while in a vertical position
for2 to 6 hrto encourage sedimentation
of any 1nsoluble material.

Although 1t is not yet possible to
explain all the processes that take
place in these systems, some of the
qualitative results observed may be
summarized as follows:

1. Little change in the over-all
appearance of the NaZrF, samples was

produced with any of the reducing

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

agents.  Some NaZrF,, together with
colorless anisotropic crystals of a
continuous range of lower indexes of
refraction, was present, which suggests
possible solid solutions of NairF,,
Na,ZrF,, and NajZrF,. "

2. A gradual change of the ARE
fuel from bright green to a darker
color with vellow to brown to red
portions could be observed as more
reducing agent was added. A brown
(olive-drab) pleochroie crystal
(average index = 1.558) was found 1in
all the 0.2-eq. additions. With 0.4
eq., more of the brown crystal,
togetherwith partly hieachedNaZr(U)Fy
was present, A trace of a red-orange
phase was also found in the 0.4-eq.
NaK addition. With 0.8 eq. of NaK, a
small amount of UF,, more red-orange
phase, some yellow-to-bleached NaZr(U)F,
and a little opaque material (possibly
metal) were found. 1In 0.8-eq. ZrH, or
Zr additions, no UF, was present,
although a yvellow-to-orange phase was
beginning to grow in and separate from
the nearly bleached crystal solution;
the brown crystals were present. The
Zr addition seemed to show more
reduction products, as well as a small
amount of opaque material. In all
the tests, the concentration of the
brown, red-orange, and UF, crystals
appeared to be highest 1n the bottom
portion of the capsule.

3. The NaF—ZrF4—UF4 (50-46 -4 mole
%) fluoride fuel run as a control
sample with these tests appeared
normal, with only a slight trace of a
brown coloration in some crystal
solution fromthe bottom of the capsule.

The orange-red crystalline phase
has been prepared by heating UF; and
ZrF4 (1:2 mole ratio) in sealed
capsules at B850 to 900°C. This
complex, which 1s almost certainly
UF, 2Zr¥F,, appears to be fairly
uniform; however, variations in the
index of refraction indicate that the
UF,-to-ZrF, ratio is not constant.
By heating equimolar mixtures of ZrF,
and UF,, a yellow-brown crystal is

119
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

formed; however,
remains,

When mixtures corresponding to
NaF-UF, -2ZrF, are heated, the red-
orange phase 1s predominant, but free
UF,, NaZrF,, and a trace of a colorless
phase are present. [If preparations
containing NaF + (UF,-2Z:F,) are
‘agitated to ensure equilibrium during
the heating period,
the olive~drab phase,
brown phase, along with NaZrF,
appear. When the composition is
NaF + 2(UF, +2ZrF,), the red-orange
phase predominates, with some green-
to-olive-drab phase growing in it;
some UF;, NaZrF.,, and a trace of
colorless crystals (not ZrOz) appear.

It seems that NaK produces some
free UF, in the ARE fuel, whereas
ZrH, and Zr do not. These phenomena
may have the following explanation:
The (NaK)F formed can remove ZrF,
fromthe UF,*2ZrF,, or similar compound,
with the ultimate formation of free
UF; when it no longer has enough ZrF,
with which to combine. On the other
hand, the ZrF, formed by the ZrH, and
Zr additions will be able to hold more
UF,. (Large encugh additions of
ZrH, or Zr to produce free UF, have
not yet been obtained.) This suggests,
however, that the ARE fuel is in very
delicate balance with regard to
reductants, and on this point alone
fuels with higher ratios of zirconium
to alkali metal might be preferred.

Reaction of Fluoride Mixtures with
NaX (L. A, Mann, J. M, Cisar, F. M,
Grizzell, ANP Division). A series of
four tests was run by the Experimental
Engineering group, in which various
amounts of NaK were allowed to react
with a fluoride fuel mixture to
determine how much NaK canbe tolerated
in the fuel mixture. In these tests,
the NaK was added to NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) and allowed to react
at high temperatures (1400 to 1500°F),
The liquid portion was then pulled
through a micrometallic filter,
the residue

an excess of UF3

some UF;, much of
and some reddish

and
(the portion that was

120

solid at high temperatures) and the
filtrate were examined. It was found
that the addition of sufficient NakK
would reduce enough UF, in the fuel
mixture to UF; to cause a solid
precipitate at reactor temperatures
and, hence, would be detrimental to
the proper functioning of the ARE.
It was also found, by adding varying
amounts of the NaK to a given amount
of fuel, that a limited addition of
NaK would notcause such precipitation.
The maximum amount that could be
added was between 0.27 and 0.70 eq.
(per equivalent uranium) at 1200 to
1300°F. Additional confirmatory
tests, plus tests with other fuel
mixtures, are scheduled to be performed
by the Materials Chemistry group.
Reaction of Na¥F-ZrF,-UF, with Zrii,
(J. D. Redman, L. G. Overholser,
Materials Chemistry Division). Ad-
ditions of small amounts of ZrH, have
been shown to be of considerable
benefitin decreasing attack on Inconel
by fluoride mixtures. Since production
of UF; in amounts sufficient to
exceed the solubility of this compound
at 1100°F might occur as a result
of such additions,
made

studies have been
to demonstrate whether such
systems are completely liquid at this
temperature.

The apparatus developed for this
purpose is shown in Fig, 10.7. This
apparatus will minimize the possibility
of oxidation of the mixture. The
charge bottle 1s loaded with the
required materials, and the apparatus
1s assembled in a dry box. The
apparatus 1s then rocked, and after an
equilibrium temperature is reached,
the rig 1s inverted to permit the
charge material to pass through the
nickel filter and into the receiver
tube. Thermocouple wells are provided
for temperature control, and the gas
lines permit evacuation of the chamber
or maintenance of a particular atmos-
phere, as desired. The filter may be
removed for examination by disassembling
the apparatus.
 

In these studies, a mixture con-
taining 30 mole % NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,,
and 4 mole % UF, that had been purified
in the standard fashion and stored
in a sealed bottle in a dry box was
treated with varying guantities of
ZrH,. BSamples were equilibrated at
800°C for 4 hr under apositive pressure
of helium and, afrer 2hr equilibration
at 600°C, filtered at the latter
temperature. ‘ |

When ZrH, was added in the range
from 0.2 to 0.7 wt % of the fuel
mixture, no evidenceof solid separating
from the melt was observed. Chemical
analysis of the filtrates in each
case revealed the original uranium
concentration, and microscopic exami-~
nation of material on the filter
revealed no UF;. Although extensive
reduction of uranium to UF; 2ZrF, was
observed in the filtrate, especially
when 0.7% of ZrH, was used, no free
UF, could be detected in the specimens
examined. .

Additional tests will be made to
verify this important point and to

determine the maximum ZrH, concen-
tration tolerable without precipi-
tation of the solids. 1t appears,
however, that if the temperature is
kept at 600°C or above, at least 0.7
wt % of ZrH, may be added to the ARE
fuel without difficulty. _
Soelubility of Potassium in the
NaF-KF-LiF Eutectic (H. R. Bronstein,
M. A, Bredig, Chemistry Division).
Additions of alkali metals to fluoride
mixtures have demonstrated a capacity
for supressing the fluoride attack
on container materials. Consequently,
an investigation was undertaken to
determine the amount of potassium
that will remain in equilibrium in
the fluoride eutectic NaF-KF-LiF
(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %). The need for
separation of the equilibrated liguid
salt and liauid metal phases led
to the design of aball-check apparatus
that consists of a sealed capsule with
two outlets, either of which may be
sealed by the steel ball within the
capsule, The capsule 1s charged with
the fluoride, the metal added, and the

121
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPCRT

mixture intimately mixed. The capsule
is then tilted so that the ball closes
the lower valve and isolates the upper
part of the salt phase, which is then
solidified and analyzed for 1ts
potassium content. The data obtained
are summarized in Table 10.4.

PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION OF
FLUORIDE MIXTURES

F. F. Blankenship G. J. Nessle

Materials Chemistry Division

Use of the hydrogenation-hydro-
fluorination process previously
described for fuel-sample preparation
has been continued on laboratory and
pilot scales for production of standard
materials for corrosion testing,
physical property evaluation, and
large-component testing.

Construction of the production
equipment to furnish 3000 1b of NaZrF,
for the ARE is in an advanced stage.
Raw materials are being accumulated at
a satisfactory rate,

A modification of the purification
treatment has been adopted for micro-
scale processing of samples containing
enriched uranium for radiation-damage
testing.

Aslight modification of the standard
procedure has been used successfully
to purify mixtures containing 50
mole % NaF, 25 mole % ZrF,, and 25
mole % UF,.

Preparation of NaZrl; by direct
hydrofluorination of Zr0O, in the
presence of NaF has been moderately
successful in simple equipment. Further
study of this process 1s planned,

Laboratory-Scale Fuel Preparation
(R. E. Thoma, C, M. Blood, F. P. Boody,
Materials Chemistry Division). Fourteen
batches of purified molten fluoride
compositions, both coolant and fuel,
have been prepared for loop tests,
measurement of physical properties,
and corrosion testing. These were
treated 1n essentially the same manner
as previously reported, (1)

To explore the unlikely possibility
that hydrogen reduces UF, or Zr¥,,
two of the fuel batches were given an
additional hydrogenation for 1 hr
following the regular procedure. No
evidence of reduced phases in the
products from these runs was shown by
examination with the petrographic
microscope. However, there 1s evidence
that the material so prepared was
slightly less corrosive in small-scale
tests than was the standard fuel. No
explanation for this effect has been
suggested; however, further study of
this behavior is planned.

Modifications of techniques of
assembling and disassembling apparatus
have resulted in less frequent failure
than was experienced at the beginning
of the hydrofluorination program,
Corrosion of the reactors has not yet
been a problem when the standard
treatment 1s applied to relatively
pure fluoride mixtures.

purified fuel mixtures andone apparatus
capable of handling up to 30 kg of
the molten materials are 1in use at
present. The small units are es-
sentially duplicatesof the laboratory-
scale models previously described.
The 50-1b equipment, however, was
built mainly from existing equipment
and utilizes an 8-ft transfer line and
a receiver furnace that can be lowered
topermit rapid handlingof the product.
This apparatus has 3/8-in. nickel
tubing in the gas and transfer lines
and 10-in.-dia reactor and receivers.
Swagelok fittings are used on all
tubing connections.

A total of 323 kg of fuel has been
prepared i1n the equipment, and 1t 1is
possible to produce up to 60 kg per
week, 1f necessary.

Each fuel batch 1s sampled as 1t
is transferred under inert gas pressure
to the receiver, Except 1n a few
instances, the concentrations of Fe,
Cr, and Ni have been less than 900,
100, and 900 ppm, respectively. There
appear to benodifferences in chemical
analysis that can be attributed to the
presence or absence of the sintered
nickel filter in the transfer line.

Since there have been some un-
explained differences in corrosion
between various batches of fuel
prepared in this equipment, it may be
necessary to increase the time of
treatment in the 50-1b rig. This
possibilityis being studiedat present.

In general, performance of the
pilot-scale equipment has been quite
satisfactory. The 50-1b rig would be
improved by larger valves in the HF
lines, although heating all such lines
to 100°F has minimized the difficulty
resulting from condensation of HF,
No difficulty with faulty vessels of
nickel or with corrosion of reactors
has been observed. Transfers of
material from the l0-in. reactor are
remarkably complete; material balances
indicate less than 100-g holdup on
batches of 50 pounds.

Fuel Production Facility (G. J.
Nessle, Materials Chemistry Division).
The 3000 1b of NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %)
for the ARE is to be prepared in
250 -1b batches. Equipment for this
purpose 1s being constructed of nickel
from scaled-up designs that are very
similar to those used for the pilot-
scale units. Duplicate units are to
be used, and production of 750 to
1000 1b per week should be possible.
These units are in the final con-
struction stages and should be available
by mid-December.

The equipment i1s instal led in an
area that is convenient for operating
personnel and where safety can be
maintained during the entire cycle.
The process includes storage, transfer,
weighing, and blending of the dry
solid components; treatmentby melting,
fluorinating with hydrogen fluoride,
and reducing with hydrogen; transfer
of the pure liquid melt to the storage

vessel; and storage of the solidified
product. All treatment processes at
molten temperatures are handled

remotely, and the negative-pressure
ventilation over the confined process
equipment is at a rate of more than
one change per minute. The process
equipment from outside manufacturers
and Y-12 shop fabricators has been
delivered and is scheduled for instal-
lation, without delay, upon completion
of the construction work.

The ZrF, for the fuel is low-
hafnium material prepared by the Y-12
Production Division by hydrofluori-
nation of ZrCl,. The ZrCl4, produced
at the Bureau of Mines in Albany,

Oregon, has been delivered, and
conversion to ZrF, is virtually
complete. Table 10.5 shows the

chemical analysis of the sublimed
ZrF, received fromY-12 and stock-piled
for this operation.

The NaF of the purity required is

Preparation of Hydrofluorinated
Fuel Samples (F. P. Boody, Materials
Chemistry Division). Ten small
samples containing enriched UF, have
been treated in the program for
preparing fuels for the cold critical
test and for radiation-damage tests
in the MTR. The base material was a
mixture of NaF and ZrF, that had been
hydrofluorinated before the enriched
UF, was added. Samples containing
10.8, 16.5, and 35.0 wt % UF, have
been prepared for the radiation-damage
experiments,

The batches of NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %) for the cold critical test
were treated in the same manner as
batches containingnormal UF,. However,
the batches required for radiation-
damage tests were small (10 to 20 g),
and the procedure was modified so
that the HF, H,, and He gases were not
bubbled through the melt but were
applied as an atmosphere.

The melt was contained in either
a nickel or platinum crucible 1nside
the nickel reactor. The reactor was
opened and the sample transferred to
a gas-tight glass shipping container
in a dry box that had an inert atmos-
phere that was produced by evacuating
and flushing with dry helium three
times. A small amount of NaK was
included in the sealed glass shipping
container to ensure the quality of the
inert atmosphere.

The formation of a hlack crust on
the surface of several of the samples

124

has caused considerable concern.
This crust has been examined petro-
graphically, spectroscopically,
chemically, and by x-ray diffraction.
The spectroscopicand x-ray diffraction
analyses showed only NaUF; and NaZrF,
to be present in appreciable quantity;

however, the petrographic microscope
indicated small amounts of carbon
and UO0,. Chemical analyses indicated

0.06 to 0.20% carbon and approximately
0.2% U0,.

Hydrofluorination of Zrx0,-NaF¥
Mixtures (C. M. Blood, R. E. Thoma,
Materials Chemistry Division), Efforts
to determine the optimum conditions
for the smooth and complete hydro-
fluorination of NaF-Zr0, mixture to
NaZrF; have continued, The successful
results obtained during the previous
quarter{'?? with the hydrofluorination
of small samples (300 to 400 g)
encouraged attempts to treat larger
batches (2 to 3 kg) without the aid
of a mechanical stirrer. Because of
the high temperatures (700 to 900°C)
involved and the pronounced 1in-~
convenience of mechanical stirring
in the presence of HF at this tempera-
ature, a technigque was sought that
required no more agitation than that
provided by gas bubbling through 6 in.

which a liquid reaction medium was
obtained through the agency of the
low-melting-point polyhydrofluorides
of NaF, or at high temperatures
{550 to 850°C), at which liquefaction
resulted from the melting of the
NaZrF,, appeared feasible. The main
problem was to find the optimum
combination of low- and high-tempera-
ture stages. Farlier results indicated
that although essentially stoichi-
ometric conversion could be obtained

at low temperatures, complete neutral-
1zation and removal of water was best

ensured by high-temperature treatment
of the molten salt. Accordingly, all
trials were finished withat least 1 hr
of high- -temperature treatment.

Difficulties associated with the
appearance of insocluble intermediates
were encountered at both low and high
temperatures. Cements, presumably
related to ZrOF,, were developed in
the partly reacted mixtures; rapid
passage of HF or helium was 1neffecti?e
in mixing the cemented portions, and
channeling occurred. '

Successful results were achieved
1f long scaking periods (12 to 16 hr)
atlow temperatures were used, followed
by high-temperature hydrofluorination;
when 25% of the charge material was
the previously prepared NaZrF., the
high-temperature treatment alone was
sufficient. Both petrographic exami-~
nation and x-ray analysis indicate
that even in those samples in which
the material balance i1s 100% there
occurs a trace amount of Na,ZrF,, and
as a result the refractive index or
the x-ray crystal pattern deviates
slightly from the exact standard for
NaZrF, .

The feasibility of making ZrF,
directly from ZrO, and NaF has been
demonstrated from a laboratory stand-

PURIFICATION OF HYDROXIDES

E. E. Ketchen I.. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

The purification of hydroxides has
continued, but at a further decreased

rate, An increased interest 1in
handling alkali metals, especially the
alloy NaK, made it necessary to

condition the vacuum dry box and
perform numerous loadings and un-
loadings, which cut heavily into the
time allotted for hydroxide purifi-
cation. sufficient NaOH has
been purified to maintain an inventory
large enough to fill all requirements
for this material.

However,

The method previously given, ('3¢1%)

which involves the removal of Na,CO,
from a 50 wt % solution of NaOH and
subsequent dehydration at 450°C under
vacuum, was used for all NaOH purifi-
cation., Nine batches averaging
1 1/21b per batch were prepared during
the period. The purified product
continues to meet the specification of

0.1 wt % for both Na,CO, and t,0.

Additional pure KOH has been prepared
by the method previously describedt 1319
namely, the interaction of pure
potassium with water, followed by
dehydration at 450°C under vacuum.
The K,CO; content has ranged from
0.04 to 0.12 wt % and the water
content has been 0.1 wt % or less.
Approximately 2 1b of KOH was prepared
during the period, and the inventory
was thus increased to about 5 pounds.
At present, the demand for pure KOH
is virtually nonexistent, and unless
some unforeseen demand arises 1t 1s
not planned to react more than. an
additional pound of potassium.

Most of the effort on corrosion was
expended in dynamic tests of the ZrF, -
bearing fluoride melts. These studlea
have been primarily concerned with the
effect of various additives to the melt
on the corrosion behavior of Inconel,
It was found that additions of ZrH,
and NaK to the fuel mixture inhibit
the corrosive attack. Other tests of
fluoride corrosion have been performed
to determine the effect of crevices,
temperature, and pretreatment of the
fluoride and the resistance of various
oxide coatings and ceramic bodies.
Several Inconel loops circulating the
fuel mixture NaF-ZrF, -UF, (46-50-4
mole %) exhibited more severe corrosion
than was previously encountered 1in
such tests; this is believed to be due
to the lower purity of the fluoride
mixtures recently prepared in large-
batch apparatus,

Temperature-dependence tests and
experiments on the effects of various
additions on the corrosion behavior of
the hydroxides were carried out. How-
ever, the maintenance of a hydrogen
atmosphere 1is the only proved means of
controlling hydroxide corrosion.

The work on liquid metal corrosion
was concentrated on the operation of
thermal convection loops of two types
to study the mass transfer properties
of lead. One of the most critical
variables in lead corrosion was found
to be the cleanliness of the lead and
the container., However, even the
purest lead prepared to date cannot be
satisfactorily contained in Inconel at
temperatures above 500°C., The in-
vestigation of the stability of BeO 1n
NaK was continued, but additional ex-
perimentation is required to make an
. evaluation, .

Oxide Additives. Static tests were
run in Inconel tubes for 100 hr at
816°C with the fluoride mixture
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1
mole %) plus approx1mately 10% additions
of ferric oxide, nickel oxide, and
chromic oxide. These'tests'were run
to determine whether the presence of
these oxides, which may also be present
on Inconel, would increase the cor-
rosion by fluorides. 1TIn these tests,
the nickel oxide and ferric oxide had
little or no effect on the extent of
corrosion. The addition of chromic
oxide apparently increased corrosion.
The results are summarized in Table
11.1. Similar tests are being run
with oxidized Inconel specimens to
determine whether increased corrosion
can be expected on oxidized Inconel,

Comparison of Liguid- and Vapor-
Phase Corrosion. Sections of the
testing tube used in some of the tests
run with the fluoride mixture NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44,5-1.1 mole %)
for 100 hr at 816°C were removed, both
from above and from below the bath
level, for metallographic examination.
The corrosive attack noted on all
sections examined would seem to indi-
cate that attack can be expected on
metals exposed to the vapor phase of
the fluoride mixture. The sections of
type 304 stainless steel exposed to
the vapor phase appeared to be attacked

127
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

more severely than those exposed to
the liquid phase. Inconel, type 309
stainless steel, and type 316 stainless
steel appeared to be attacked by the
vapor phase to approximately the same
extent as by the liquid phase of the
molten fluoride salt., Figures 11.1
and 11.2 compare type 304 stainless
steel as exposed to the liquid phase
and to the vapor phase of the fluoride.
Details of these tests are presented
in Table 11.2.

Crevice Corrosion. Some concern had
been expressed about the possibility
of crevice corrosion in materials used
to contain the molten fluorides. In
order to check this possibility, tests
were set up with specially prepared
crevices. Ordinary static corrosion
tubes were employed, and the lower
section of the tube above the bottom

weld was partly crimped so that a
crevice about 1 in. long and approxi-
mately 1/16 in. wide was obtained.
After being exposed for 100 hr at
816°C to the fluoride mixture NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %),
the tubes were cut longitudinally
through the partly crimped section and
examined for evidence of accelerated
corrosion. The crimped ends of several
ordinary static corrosion test tubes
were also examined for accelerated
corrosion. Corrosion in these crevices
appeared to be somewhat erratic, with
some sections being unattacked. How-
ever, even in the sections that were
attacked, the depth of penetration did
not exceed that normally expected for
these materials after exposure to
fluorides. Details of these tests are
presented in Table 11.3,

Carboloy and Stellite Alloys.,
Several Carboloy and Haynes Stellite
alloys that might possibly be used as
valve seat and facing materials have
been subjected to static corrosion
tests with the fluorides. Carboloy
44A and 55A were apparently unattacked
in fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-
50-4 mole %). The Stellites tested
were attacked much more severely by
this fluoride mixture than by NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %).
These materials were exposed for 100
hr at 816°C in evacuated Inconel tubes.
The test results are presented in
Table 11.4.

of 1 wt % of Zr or ZrH, to fuel con-
taining NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole %).

cate that with the additives the

the dissolution of chromium, however,
1is reduced to negligible proportions.
It appears that this technique may
alleviate the difficult problem of
selective leaching of chromium from
Inconel and stainless steel. Metal-
lographic examinations of these tubes
indicate that addition of Zr or ZrH,
reduces penetration of the fuel into
the metal.

Tests still in progress indicate
that addition of these agents to the
extent of an 0.8 equivalent of Zr or
ZrH, (based on reduction of UF, to UF;)
causes formation of an orange-brown
compound and that addition of an 0.8
egquivalent of NaK causes some reduction
to UF;. At lower concentrations, that
is, below 0.4 equivalent, no free UF,
1s detected. The range between 0.4
and 0.8 is being investigated,

Examination of Inconel tubes 1in
which varying amounts of NaK were
added to NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
and NaF-Zr¥F, (50-50 mole %) showed
that in the tubes containing NaF-ZrF, -
UF, there was a nonmetallic deposit
and some pitting at the deposit-metal
inter face. The tubes containing NakF-
ZrF, appeared to be attacked similarly,
but there was somewhat heavier pitting.
Additions of NaK cannot be recommended
at present. '

Fluoride Treatment. Static cor-
- rosion tesﬂs were made on a special
batch of the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF,-
UF, (50-46-4 mole %), which was pre-
pared by starting with ZrO, and hydro-
fluorinatirig the mixture to obtain
ZrF,. The tests indicated that this
mixture 1s no more corrosive than
material prepared by the hydrogenation-
hydrofluorination process in which
- ZrF, is used as the startingmaterial.

The effect of a hydrofluorination
treatment for the fluoride mixture

NaF-KF-UF, (46.5-26-27.5 mole %) was

PERIOD ENDING DECEVBER 16, 1952

determined in a tilting-furnace cor-
rosion test in which the hot end was
at 800°C and the cold end at 650°C,
The duration of the test was 100
hours. It was found that Inconel
suffered approximately the same degree
of attack as when exposed to untreated
fluorides of the same composition,
that is, 1 to 6 mils of penetration.
The results of exposure of type 316
stainless steel indicated approximately
the same severity of attack, but
slightly less penetration, as when
untreated material ‘was used. It
appears that the purification treat-
ment should be extended for longer

times when high uranium concentrations
are used.

A test was run in the tilting
furnace under standard conditiomns of
time and temperature with NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(50-46-4 mole %) that had been treated
with hydrogen after purification by
the normal hydrogenation-hydrofluori-
nation method. Type 316 stainless
steel showed somewhat less attack when
subjected to the hydrogen-treated
material than when exposed to material
prepared in the standard fashion. The
Inconel tubes were found to be lightly
attacked (0.5- to 1-mil penetration)
when in contact with the hydrofluorin-
ated material, but they evidenced no
attack when exposed to the hydrogen-
treated material. These preliminary
tests indicate that a final hydrogen
treatment of the fuel would be bene-
ficial, Additional tests are scheduled.

Temperature Dependence. Although
the immediate application of the

fluoride fuel NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4

mole %) is to be limited to a tempera-
ture of 1500°F, some corrosion tests
under static conditions were performed
at considerably higher temperatures to
determine the temperature-dependence
of the corrosiveness of this fuel. As
the data in Table 11.5 indicate,
penetration of the Inconel by the
fluorides in these 100 hr tests in-
creased slightly, 1f at all, over the
temperature range 800 to 1200°C,

It 1s i1interesting to note that
Inconel seems to lose weight at 1200°C
instead of gaining weight as is usual
at the lower temperatures, No expla-
nation for the behavior athigh temper-
atures 1s suggested,

The weight gain shown by the silicon

the fluorides; if this is the case,
there is indication that silicon

FLUORIDE CORROSION IN THERMAL
CONVECTION LOOPS

G. M. Adamson, Metallurgy Divisioni

Several Inconel loops were operated
with NaF-Zr¥F,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %)
under standard conditions, and in every
case the depth of attack was slightly
greater than had been encountered
previously., The fluoride charges for
these loops were all prepared in large
batches. The inhibiting effect of
zirconium hydride was confirmed in a
test with NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1.1 mole %). The inhibiting
effect was also observed with ZrF -
bearing fluorides, but 1t was not
quite so effective and caused changes
to take place in the fuel. NaK also
has an inhibiting effect on both these
fluorides but causes even greater
changes to take place. It was noted
that the fluorides possess a self-

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

insulating property that makes plugging
a flowing system more difficult than
would be expected, |

The results obtained during this
period with the Inconel loops in which
fluorides were circulated are summarized
in Table 11.6. This table is a con-
tinuation of Table 15 in the previous
report. ?) Table 11.6 should be
referred to in reading the following
discussion because i1t presents the
individual test data not given in the
specific sections. All loop tests,
except one that terminated prematurely
because of a power failure, operated
for 500 hr with a hot leg temperature
of 1500°F,

Mixtures Containing ZrF, .
as yet undetermined reason, the attack
found in the TIncomnel loops in which
fluorides containing ZrF, have been
circulated is increasing, The attack
by these fluorides had been reduced to
a depth of about 5 mils maximum after

500 hr at 1500°F,

For some

but i1n recent tLtests
the attack has been significantly
greater, that is, from 9 to 12 mils.
Although some of the earlier loops
were attacked to a depth of 10 mils,
the attack could be attributed to the
cleaning cycle, since 1t has heen shown
(both with other fluorides(?’ and with
lead) that the cleaning methods pre-
viously used caused an increase in
attack. The new attack is actually as
deep as, or deeper than, the attack in
all the earlier tests,
cleaning variables are i1ncluded.
Figures 11,3, 11.4, and 11.5 show
typical hot leg sections from these
loops. Figures 11.3 and 11.4 permit a
comparison of the earlier and the
recent attack of NaF-ZrF _ -UF, on
Inconel. Figure 11.5 shows a hydrogen-
fired loop of the earlier group. One
other point of interest is that an as
vet unidentified brown material 1is
found in the fluorides from the recent

even when the

tests that was not found in
fluorides from the earlier tests.

The major difference in these tests
is that the earlier loops were filled
from small batches of fluorides made
in the laboratory, whereas the later
ones were filled from 50-1b batches
made in a production operation. The
attack now being measured is not
serious, since it 1s comparable to
that normally found with NaF-KF-LiF-
UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %), but
the trend may be serious. The actual
fuel material for the reactor will be
produced in 250-1b batches instead of
the 50-1b batches being produced at
present. A joint chemical, experimental
engineering, and metallurgical program
is under way to determine whether the
increase in batch size affects the

corrosion or whether the increase 1n
corrosion is the result of some change
in handling procedure.

Most of the postrun examlnatlons(g)
of the fuels from thermal convection
loops have been confined to petrographic
and x-ray examinations. The NaF-ZrF,

ochroic, brown or olive-drab phase
that has an average refractive index
of 1.556 was first noted in a type 316
stainless steel loop, but it has also
been found in several Inconel loops
containing this mixture, as well as in
ZrF,-bearing fluorides treated with
NaK, Zr, and ZrH,. In these dynamic

corrosion tests, there appears to be
some correlation (which did not exist
in static tests) between the amount of
the olive-drab phase and the extent of
corrosion,

Hydrofluorinated NaF-KF-LiF-UF,.
One other series of tests points to
poor production technique as the cause
of the trouble discussed above. The
attack found in Inconel loops in which
NaF-ZrF, -UF, (46-50-4 mole %) was
circulated had been only one half of
that found with NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-
43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %). One explanation
for this has been the higher purity of
the ZrF,-bearing fluoride. During
production, the ZrF, -bearing material
is purified with both hydrogen and
hydrogen fluoride, whereas the NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, is not. Two special batches
of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, were prepared by the

group that makes the NaF-ZrF,-UF,, and
the same techniques were used., Un-
expectedly, the metal impurities in the
specially prepared batches were much
higher than in the normal material.
In the two special batches, the metal
impurities were:

BATCH 1 BATCH 2
Chromium, ppm 2200 1280
Iron, ppm 5600 7000
Nickel, ppm 7100 5300

The presence of these impurities has
not yet been explained. Metallographic
examination after a test with the
first batch revealed a wmaximum hot
leg attack of 30 mils, with an average
of 18 mils. This 1s the deepest
attack yet found with any fluoride
loop. A loop 1s now being run to

NaF-KF-LiF-UF, will cause an increase

Corrosion Inhibitors. It was
pointed out in the previous report(*’
that the addition of 0.5% ZrH, caused
a reduction in the hot leg attack on
Inconel by NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1.1 mole %) to only 0.5 mil.
The test has now been repeated, and
the attack found in the second loop
was 1 mil., The unidentified material
found in many of the grain boundaries
in the hot leg section of the first
loop was also found here, but only in
very small amounts in widely scattered
areas. A thin adherent layer that
appears to be metallic was found in
the cold leg. The fluorides in the
loop after the run consisted of

(4)9. M. Adémson, op. cit., b. 108.

alternating layers of a colorless
material and the usual green phase.
Petrographically, these two materials
seem to be very similar, or even to
be the same. No reduced or partly
reduced phases were found in the
Yoop itself.

Since optimistic results were ob-
tained with the loops discussed above,
two loops were run with zirconium
hydride added to NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %). Operation of both these loops
has been completed, but the results of
metallographic examination are availa-
ble for only the first one. Scattered
attack, with a maximum penetration of
4 mils (average 2 mils), was found.
This attack is definitely less than
that found in the other NaF-ZrF, -UF,
loops run during this period, but the
effect of the zirconium hydride 1s not
so great as was found with the NaF-
KF-LiF-UF, mixture. No grain-boundary

137
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

constituent was found in this loop.
A considerable change had taken place
in the fluorides in both loops, as
evidenced by the unidentified brownish
material found, along with the green
phase, in all sections. No free UF,
was produced, although intermediate
reduction products similar to those
present 1n NaK loops were found.

The static corrosion tests had
indicated optimistic resnlts when
base metals were used as inhibitors.,
Previously reported work had also
shown a reduction in attack when
nonuranium-bearing fluorides were
circulated. Small amounts (about 10
cm®) of NaK were therefore added to
two Inconel loops, one of which
contained NalF-ZrF, -UF, and the other
NaF-KF-LiF-UF,. In these loops, both
the amount and maximum depth of attack
were lower than those in comparable
loops without the NaK. Although the
improvements were not large and could
have resulted from the normal spread
1n results, the fact that the metallic
impurities in the fluorides were so
low would indicate that the im-
provements were real. The NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) was changed in
appearance and included yellow material
that was present both as clumps and
as a grain-boundary constituent.
This loop also gave considerable
difficulty during startup, and it was
necessary tostrike the legs frequently
with a hammer to wmaintain circulation.
Free UF,, as well as intermediates,
was produced in the fluoride.

the material
being leached from the hot leg, the
addition of chromium to the fuel could
possibly slow down the reaction. It
would be necessary to keep the chromium
concentration low enough to prevent
saturation and deposition in the cold
leg, but high enough to reduce the rate
of solution in the hot leg. The solu-
bility of chromium in the fluorides
has not yet been determined. Two
loops were operated with a chromium

addition, but the results are 1in-
conclusive since the chromium did not
mix with the fluorides. The analysais
of the fluorides in both loops showed
a chromium concentration in the various
loop sections that was even lower than
normal, whereas a chromium concen-
tration of over 5% was observed 1in the
fluorides in the expansion pot of one
loop.

Inserted Corrosion Samples. Two
Inconel loops were operated with small,
flat, Inconel samples 1nserted 1in the
top of the hot leg. In a loop operated
with NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %),
the wall attack in the hot leg con-
sisted of moderate integranular
and general attack from 9 to 17 mils

deep, which is deeper than normal,
The sample in this loop, however, was
attacked to adepth of only 1 mil. The

second loop, which contained NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %),
showed moderate wall attack from 5 to
11 mils deep, which is average attack
for NaF-KF-LiF-UF,. The sample was
attacked lightly to only 3 mils 1n
depth. Two more loops are now circu-
lating with small thin-walled tubes
inserted in the hot leg. Thermocouples
inserted in these tubes show that a
large temperature drop isnot responsi-
ble for the lack of attack on the
samples.

Crevice Corrosion. additional
check on the crevice corrosion found
at the top weld in the thermal loops
and i1n one of the pump loops, a loop
was operated with two crevices fabri-
cated into the hot leg., NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10,9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) was circu-
lated in this loop at 1500°F. 1In
the upper section of the hot leg,
the wall attack varied from 4 to 7
mils, whereas in an adjoining crevice,
the attvack was from 6 to 8 mils and
twice as concentrated. At the lower
crevice, the pipe showed only scattered
pits, up to 5 mils deep, whereas
normal attack, up to 6 mils, was found
in the crevice. This loop showed only
a slight increase in depth of attack

been made from the inside of the loop

that the pipes were not deformed during
the drilling. The chemical analyses
of these samples are shown in Table
11.7. TInconel loop 229, in which
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1
mole %) was circulated, and Inconel
loop 236, in which NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-
50-4 mole %) was circulated, were
operated under standard conditions.
The change of analyses with depth from
the surface follows the same general
pattern as for the loops discussed in
the previous report.(s) '

Self-insulating Properties of
Fluorides. An Inconel loop was filled
with NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and allowed to
circulate in the normal manner at
1500°F. After normal circulation had
been established, two helium jets were
directed against an area at the bottom
of the cold leg. Each jet delivered
over 1000 ft3/hr of gas for 18 hr but
did not cause the loop to plug.
Initially, the cold leg temperature
dropped, but the power was increased
and the temperatures gradually returned
to normal. The helium jets were then
replaced by air jets that delivered a
sufficient volume to form a black spot
about 6 in., long. The loop circu-
lated over 1000 hr with these jets
operating, but there was apparently no
plugging caused by the temperature
differences.

Air jets were then turned on a
section of the loop in the cold leg,
and, after a total of 2300 hr, operation
was terminated. The fluoride 1in both
sections appeared normal upon visual
inspection, but in neither section

would the fluoride melt under the
conditions normally used for this
operation,

Other Loop Tests. A type 316
stainless steel loop (No. 117) circu-
lated NaF-KF-Li¥F-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-
1.1 mole %) for 500 hours. This is
only the second type 316 stainless
steel loop that has not plugged, and
both of these loops were operated under
similar conditions, The cold leg of
this loop was held above 1500°F by
using a hot leg temperature of 1630°F
and wrapping the cold leg with asbestos
tape. No sign of plugging was evident
at 500 hours. At this time, the hot
leg temperature was reduced to 1500°F,
and the asbestos tape was removed so
that the loop would circulate under
standard conditions. The loop then
plugged after 366 hr at the lower
temperature, or a total of 866 hours.
A considerable quantity of metallic
flakes was observed in the fluorides.
The fluoride in the sections of this
loop melted at below 1250°F, and it
all melted.

An Tzett iron loop, which had been
cleaned with dry hydrogen, plugged 1in
46 hr of eirculation of NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10,9-43,5-44.5-1.1 mole %) at 1500°F,
The inside surface of the hot leg was
very rough, and considerable reduction
in wall thickness had taken place. A
heavy metallic deposit in the form of
large metallic crystals with some non-
metallic particles embedded i1n them
was found in the cold leg.

Inconel loop 246 circulated NaF-ZrF,
(52-48 mole %) for 500 hr at 1500°F.
Scattered intergranular attack of from
3tp8 mils was found in the top section
of the hot leg, The lower section
showed general pits of 1 mil, with an
occasional patch up to 6 mils deep.
No deposit was found in the cold leg,
This attack is comparable to that found
in the previous tests with fluorides
that did not contain uranium. '

temperature was increased to at least
550°C. The results are tabulated in

Nickel in NaOH Under Hydrogen
Atmosphere. Maintenance of a hydrogen
pressure from an external source has
been shown to minimize corrosion and
transfer of nickel in NaOH.
Maintenance of an atmosphere of hydrogen
in components of a high-temperature
reactor would 1ntroduce a number of
problems; however, the prospect of
containing hydroxides in this fashion
has appeared sufficiently promising to
justify systematic study of this
possibility,

In the experiments, sodium hydroxide
containing less than 0.1% Na,CO, and
less than 0.1% H,0 was used, and all
handling of the material was conducted
in a dry box that conld be evacuated
and flushed with pure, dry helium. The

metal to be tested was heated for 30
min at 800°C in pure flowing hydrogen
and subsequently handled so that the
inner surface of the tube was exposed
only to pure helium before the corrosion
test., The hydrogen used 1in these
experiments was purified by passage
through a “Deoxo’ catalytic mass. The
water was removed by liguid-nitrogen-
cooled traps and by magnesium per-
chlorate,

In one type of test, the movement
of hydroxide was achieved by thermal
convection in a single 1/2-in.-dia
tube inclined at 45 deg and heated to
800°C at the bottom. A temperature
gradient of about 200°C was maintained
between the top and bottom of the
hydroxide that filled the 18-in. tube
to a depth of about 12 inches,

Tubes of nickel were placed in an
outer jacket of stainless steel designed
to contain the furnace assembly so that
the hydrogen can bathe the outside
walls as well as the contents of the
tubes and were exposed to sodium
hydroxide for 48 hours. Figure 11.6
indicates the great difference in the
behavior of nickel 1n NaOH when hydrogen
instead of helium is used in tests of

helium atmosphere show large deposits
of nickel crystals at the cold end of
the tube, whereas the bottom sections
of the tube are highly polished. When
hydrogen is used, the bottom sections
of the tube show considerable polish,
but virtually no crystal deposit is
visible at the cold end.

When tests are conducted in a
similar fashion but with the hydrogen
(at atmospheric pressure) applied only
to the inside of the tube under test,
the beneficial action isstillobtained.

In another type of test, nickel

maintenance of the proper atmosphere
were exposed in the tilting furnace.
The tubes were rocked four times per

it is hardly surprising that prior
hydrogenation of the specimens did not
appear to be beneficial.

It is noteworthy that when helium
atmospheres were used in these tests,
the NaOH recovered was brownish-gray
in color and contained about 1500 ppm
of nickel. When the hydrogen atmos-
pheres were used, the snow-white
hydroxide contained 20 to 35 ppm of

High-Velocity Corrosion by Sodium.
A dynamic test, which has become known
as the spinner test,’? has been used
to check the effect of high-velocity
corrosion and erosion in molten sodium
on several materials. In this test,
relatively high velocities (400 ft/min)
are obtained by rotating tubular
specimens in a pot containing the molten
corrodant under isothermal conditions.
Inconel and types 316, 347, and 446
stainless steels have been tested in
this apparatus. Greater attack than
that obtained in ordinary static cor-
rosion tests was noted onall materials
tested. Tt should be emphasized that,
except in the test of the type 347
stainless steel specimens, these were
actually three-component tests because
the spinner pot was fabricated of type
347 stainless steel.

| The effect of this test on Inconel
spun at 400 ft/min for 72 hr at 816°C
is shown in Fig. 11.8. A 0.5-mil
surface layer, with 0.5 mil of inter-
granular voids beneath it, is apparent.
This surface layer may be a mass
transfer effect caused by the three-
component system used during test.
The analysis of a portion of the

surface layer scraped from the specimen
and

showed 64% nickel, 27.5% chromium,

The intergranular attack on type
316 stainless steel 1s shown 1in Fig.
11.9. This attack extended to a depth
of 1 to 2 mils near the front, or
leading edge, of the tubular specimen
and, as would be expected, was less
severe at the trailing edge, where the
depth of attack was 0.5 to 1 mil. The
test was conducted at 816°C for 100 hr
with a speed of 400 ft/min. Type 347
stainless steel suffered intergranular
attack to 2 mils after testing for 74
hr at 816°C with a speed of 400 ft/min.
After 53 hr at 816°C at a speed of
400 ft/min, type 446 stainless steel
showed slight intergranular attack to
a depth of less than 0.5 mil. The
results of these tests are summarized

Lead in. Metal Convection Loops. The
problem of circulating lead has been
revived during this quarter. lLoops
identical to those being used with the

further purified by bubbling hydrogen
through 1t.

had been cleaned with NaK and then
evacuated while hot, would not circu-

rinsed with water, after the NaK
cleaning, before being evacuated.

fraction lines do not fit those from

430 stainless steel loop that was
rinsed with cold nitric acid, washed
with water, and then evacuated while

hours. The two cleaning methods were
then combined and used on a type 410
stainless steel loop. This loop was

acid rinsed, water washed, and heated
while under vacuum. Tt circulated for

appeared to be at the bottom of the
cold leg. They remained when the lead
was meleced out at 1575°F, The plugs

Lead in fuartz Convection Loops.
The prohibitive amounts of mass trans-
fer that occurred 1n lead-Inconel
thermal convection loops and in static
corrosion tests have prevented the
acquisition of significant data on
this system. In addition, the results
were open toquestion because sufficient
care had not been taken to deoxidize
the lead and because the Inconel tubing
used was covered with a heavy coating
of oxide.

An apparatus built in which
lead could be deoxidized with hydrogen
and then brought into contact with
Inconel specimens without exposure to
an oxidizing atmosphere., This appa-
ratus, shown in Fig., 11.10, consisted
of a thermal convection loop constructed
entirely of 1/2-1in. quartz tubing. Two
6-in. lengths of 7/16-1in. Inconel tubing
were mounted in the hot and cold legs
of the loop. Before being placed in
the loop, the Inconel tubing was
scrubbed with cleaning powder and
rinsed with alcohol and ether. The
lead was deoxidized in a 1 1/2-in, -
dia quartz bulb attached above the
loop and separated from it by a fritted
quartz disk. The lead i1n the de-
oxidation bulb was heated to 425°C,
and hydrogen was allowed to pass
through the fritted quartz disk and
bubble up through the lead. When the
deoxidation was complete, the lead was
forced through the fritted disk and
into the loop. Circulation of ‘the
lead was maintained by the thermal
convection currents thus induced.

was

This procedure assured that the
oxide content of the lead was reduced
to a minimum and, in addition, pre-
vented re-oxidation of the lead during
the loading of the loop. This technique
also offered several other advantages.

148

The use of quartz loops rather than the
conventional metal loops eliminated
many of the difficulties previously
encountered with leaks at welds. The
new loop required only a small amount
of metal tubing, a factor of some
importance for cases in which the
metal to be tested 1s expensive or in
short supply. Since the test specimens
were completely enclosed in the quartz
tubing of the loop, itwas not necessary
to provide a protective atmosphere
around the outside of the specimens,
as would have been the case 1fordinary
metal loops of such reactive metals as
molybdenum or columbium had been the
solid metal under test.

Two tests have been made on Inconel
specimens with 0,035-1in. wall thickness
in the apparatus described above for
circulating lead. Both loops had a
hot leg temperature of 800°C; one had
a cold leg temperature of 400°C and
the other 475°C. The results of the
two tests differed only in deta1l.
Circulation of the lead in one loop
stopped after 125 hr of operation and
in the other after 51 hr because of
formation of plugs in the cold legs.
The depth of attack in the hot leg

the other loop. In addition to the
usual mass transfer, a matrix-like,
corroded layer formed on the Inconel.
This corroded layer is shown in Fig.
11.11, which is a photograph of a cross
section of the Inconel tubing 1in the
hot leg of the loop. The corresponding

In a preliminary test, the primary
purpose of which was to test loop
design, a loop was used that was
similar in design to that shown in
Fig., 11.8, except that 1t was con-
structed of pyrex glass. The hot and
cold leg temperatures were 500 and
365°C, respectively. No mass transfer
or corrosion was noted in either leg
during 96 hr of operation. These
results, together with the lack of

corrosion in the cold leg of the first
loop (at 400°C) and only very slight
corrosion in the cold leg of the
second loop (at 475°C), led to the
conclusion that the corrosive attack
of liquid lead on Inconel probably
began in the neighborhood of 500°C,

The chemical analysis of the plugs
formed in the guartz loop tests was
only slightly different from the
nominal composition of Inconel. Tt
was therefore concluded that the
liquid lead had virtually no selective
leaching action on the Inconel speci-
mens. It was further concluded that
both severe mass transfer and corrosive
attack will occur in lead-Inconel
thermal convection loops with hot leg
temperatures of 800°C, even when the
lead has been carefully deoxidized
with hydrogen.

results are summarized in Table 11.12.

Interaction of Fluorides with
Structural Metals (H. S. Powers, J. D,
Redman, L. G. Overholser, Materials
Chemistry Division). Investigation of
the reaction of chromium and iron with
molten NaF-KF-LiF eutectic has con-
tinued. Special emphasis has been
placed on the behavior of K2NaCrF6 and
K,NaFelF, when contacted with the
eutectic in the temperature range from
600 to 1000°C, The filtrates col-
lected at various temperatures in the
range from 500 to 800°C have been
subjected to chemical analysis, as 1n
the past, and the residues and filtrates
have been examined by x-ray diffraction.

In a number of experiments, 3 wt %
of K,NaCrF_, was added to samples of
the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic. The mixtures
were heated at 800 to 1100°C under an
atmosphere of helium for several hours
and then filtered at various tempera-
tures in the range from 500 to 800°C,
and the residues and filtrates were
examined. Heating of the K,NaCrF, at
temperatures up to 1100°C prior to its
addition to the eutectic did not
affect 1ts solubility, and the temper-
ature of equilibration of this compound
with the eutectic prior to filtration
was unimportant.
ever,

Solubility was, how-
a function of temperature of
filtration. The filtrate collected
at 500°C contained 400 to 500 ppm Cr,

whereas the filtrate obtained at either

152

650 or 800°C contained 2000 to 3000
ppm Cr. Microscopic examination re-
vealed that most of the Cr was present
as K,NaCrF_., which indicates that this
compound 1s appreciably soluble 1in the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic atelevated temper-
atures, X-ray examination shows that
in some runs, materials other than
K,NaCrF_ have been present, including
K,CrF,, Cr,0,, and KNaLiCrF,

Similar experiments in which Cr was
added to the esutectic as metal 1instead
of as KzNaCrF6 showed that Cr203, Cr,
and K,NaCrF_, were present after the
interaction., Additional products that
have not yet been i1dentified were also
found.

A study of the solubility of K NaFeF
in the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic and the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture at 600 and
800°C was made. It was found that with
2.5% of K,NaFeF  the solubility in
both fluoride mixtures and at both
temperatures of filtration was 6000 to
7000 ppm. Apparently, all the K,NaFeF,
added was dissolved.

Since the presence of oxidation
products 1in a number of the filtrates
indicated that the digestion and
filtration apparatus in which a blanket
of helium is used does not exclude
oxygen completely, two new types of
reaction-filtration equipment have
been designed and fabricated that
should eliminate oxidative effects.

Air Oxidation of Fuel Mixtures
(R, P. Metcalf, F., F, Blankenship,
Materials Chemistry Division). The
investigation of the oxidation of fuel
mixtures contained in nickel has been
complicated by the corrosion of the
nickel containers. The corrosion has
been studied in a series of experi-
ments.,

In each experiment,
fluoride, in a nickel boat, was placed
in a “combustion tube’’ consisting of a
horizontal 1 1/2-in.-0D stainless
steel tube heated by a tube furnace.
The inner surface of the steel tube
was protected by a sleeve of 5-mil
nickel sheet. The tube was evacuated
and heated to the desired temperature;
dry air was then admitted and passed
through at a rate of about 40 cm?/min
for about 4 hours. The solid products
were examined by x-ray diffraction.
No gaseous products were observed,

In summary, nickel 1s oxidized
severely by dry air when 1in contact
with fused fluorides. The oxidation
1s accompanied by creeping of the melt
over the entire heated surface of the
nickel container. Uranium, when
present in the fluoride mixture, reacts
to form a yellow product that probably
contains oxygen but has not yet been
completely 1dentified.

It is suggested that the oxidation
occurs because the fused fluorides
dissolve the adherent protective scale
of nickel oxide, which forms
absence of the melt.

The formation of the greenish- gray
nickel oxide observed in several of
the experiments appears to be associated
with the presence of moisture in the

salt employed.
EMF Measurements in Fosed Fluorides

(L. E. Tepol, L. G, Overholser,
Materials ChemistryDivision). Previous
sbudies,(g)involving the determination
of the decomposition potential of NiF,
in molten KF, suggested that a thermal
decomposition of NiF, occurred during
the experiments and led to a study of
the decomposition of NiFZ, N10, and
K,NiF, at temperatures from 700 to

900°C in a purified helium atmosphere.
The study has been continued and
extended to include the possibility of
decomposition under vacuum. An attempt
has been made to measure the decompo-
sition potential of KF on Ni at 8%90°C
in a nickel container.

Repeated attempts 'to prevent the
decomposition of NiQ and NiF, at 750
to 900°C under a pur1fled helium
atmosphere were unsuccessful, even
when all the rubber tubing was re-
placed with glass or copper tubing.
In some cases, the weight losses were
apparently greater than could be
explained by complete decomposition of
the NiF, or NiO. An attempt is being
made to measure the dissociation of
NiF, and Ni0O in vacuum at various
temperatures. A vacuum system has
been constructed, and a preliminary
experiment showed that no apparent
decomposition of the Ni0 occurred, even
though it had been heated to 1020°C,
This absence of dissociation 1is 1in
agreement with the findings of Johnson
and Marshall,('%) who measured the
vapor pressure of NiO at temperatures
from 1440 to 1566°K. Studies of the
behavior of N10 1in vacuum

Decomposition potentials have been
determined in KF at 890°C with nickel
electrodes in various vessels. Measure-
ments were made in Norton stabilized-
zirconia crucibles (TZ-5601) and in
Norton thoria crucibles (LT-7010),
although these materials are somewhat
permeable to the KF, Subsequent runs
were made with a nickel cup as both
container and cathode and a 1/16-in.-
dia nickel rod as the anode. 1In every
case except one, a decomposition
potential was observed at 0.7 to 0.9
volt. These values agree with earlier
values®®? and with those determined by
Neumann and Richter(!!) on graphite.

were applied, a change in slope was
noticed at voltages above 2.5, in
addition to the break in the current-
voltage curve at 0.8 volt: but, un-
fortunately, not enough data were taken
at these higher potentials to obtain
an accurate determination of the
decomposition voltage. In the last
experiment, no break in the current-
voltage curve was found at 0.8 volt,
but a definite break occurred at 2.6
volts., In all cases, the anode was
markedly attacked and was surrounded
by a black sludge that was somewhat
magnetic. Possible explanations of
these results are being studied.
Preparation of Trivalent Nickel
Compounds in the Hydroxides (L. D,
Dyer, G. P. Smith, Metallurgy Division).
Lithium nickelate(III) and sodium
rnickelate(III) have been shown to
occur (see previous guarterly reports)
in the corresponding hydroxides under
highly oxidizing conditions by actually

154

preparing large amounts of these com-
pounds in hydroxides, Therefore the
preparation of a presumed potassium
nickelate(1II) was undertaken to show
1ts occurrence under certain circum-
stances in potassium hydroxide,

By using molten potassium peroxide
as the oxidizing agent on nickel,
enough higher valent nickel crystals
were prepared to get a single crystal
for x-ray study. Because of the
apparent instability of the supposed
potassium nickelate, the nickel in the
compound either lost some oxidizing
power when removed from the KOH and
K204 with alcohol, or 1t never was
completely oxidized in the tube. The
separated compound contained only 20%
Ni**", whereas the theoretical value
for KNIO, is about 45% Ni'**,

The experiments are being continued
to find the conditions for obtaining
more and larger crystals and to refine
the separation method.

Additional studies on the cone-arc

solid fuel elements has been tried,
with some degree of success. After
the proper electrode force was de-

was selected, and welds made over a
considerable current range have been

from the various high-temperature
tensile tests, are presented.

A very marked effect of the en-
vironment on the load-carrying abili-
ties of Inconel has been observed in
tests run at 815°C in atmospheres of
air, argon, and hydrogen. The same
effect has been seen to a lesser
extent 1n creep tests of type 316
stainless steel. Preliminary results
obtained at 815°C indicate that the
fluorides affect the load-carrying
~abilities appreciably at the lower
- stress values. _

An attempt is being made to produce
spherical particles of uranium-bearing
alloys approximately 0.010 1in. in
~diameter. These particles will re-
ceive a protective coating of nickel
plating, approximately 0.005 in.,
prior to being used in a pebble-bed
~type of reactor. The methods being
investigated are the following:

1. suspension in refractory powder
and heating above the solidus, '

2. momentary melting by passing
through a high-temperature arc,

3. spraying from a metallizing gun.
Solid-phase bonding studies are being
initiated to determine which materials
are easy to bond and which materials
are difficult to bond. After this
screening operation, the work will be
expanded to include a study of ‘the
production of solid fuel elements by
a hot-pressing operation in which
electroformed screens will be filled
with a mixture of U0, and stainless
steel powder prior to the bonding
step. Studies on the reaction of
columbium with various gaseous atmos-
pheres have been initiated in an
attempt to understand the effect of
these atmospheres so that the me-
chanical properties of columbium and
its alloys can be studied.

Disks in which a layer of U0, 1s
incorporated have been successfully
prepared from Cr-Al,0; cermet compo-
sitions., A ZrC-Fe cermet has been
developed that has possible interest
as a material for pump parts, seals,
and bearing materials. Work 1s being
carried out on SiC-C cermets. A
satisfactory dipping technique has
been developed for the application of
an oxidation-resistant ceramic coating
to nickel parts for use in an aircraft
type of radiator. A ceramic coating
containing 10% boron for possible
application in reactor shielding has
been successfully flame-sprayed on
20-gage stainless steel. |

particles 0.010 in. in diameter.
After receiving a 0.005-in. protective
nickel plate, the particles would be
packed 1n beds 1n the reactor core,
and cooling water would flow through
the interparticle channels.

Several methods for preparing the

spheres, with the use of both high-
and low-melting-point alloys, were
given a preliminary examination. The

high-melting-point alloy contained
5% uranium in molybdenum, and the
low-melting-point alloy contained 5%
uranium i1n nickel or copper. The
results obtainedbyusing the following
methods of preparation were only
partly successful: (2) suspension in
refractory powder and heating above
the solidus, (2) momentary melting by
passing through a high-temperature
arc, and (3) spraying from a metal-
lizing gun.

Suspension in Refractory Powder,
The U-N1 and U-Cu alloys were swaged
and drawn to 0.010 in. in diameter and
then cut into short segments. The
U-M particles were mixed with Al O,
and heated to 1450°C; one sample was
heated in hydrogen and another in a
vacuum of 3 microns. The U-Cu parti-
cles were spread on a refractory plate
and heated to 1100°C for 5 min in
hydrogen. A surface filwm formed in
all three cases and prevented spheroid-
1zation, even though a liquid phase
was present.

Momentary Melting in a High-
Temperature Arc, A rig for housing
two water-cooled electrodes and
supplying an argon atmosphere was
assembled. Both carbon and tungsten
electrodes have been used. The U-Na
alloy particles, similar to those used
in the first method, were dropped
through an struck between the
electrodes. Alignment proved to be
very critical, but the particles that
passed through the arc zone did melt.
The yi1eld was quite low, however.
Particles that passed through the
carbon arc were porous, whereas those

arc

156

that passed through the tungsten arc
were not.

Similar U-Ni alloy particles were
also dropped through an atomic-hydrogen
arc, and a small number of essentially
spherical, but porous, particles were
formed.

Spraying from a Metallizing Gun,
A length of 0.057-in. -dia U-N1 alloy
wire was fed through a metallizing
and the resulting particles were
collected in water. As with the other
methods, a porous product resulted.
Substitution of argon for the normal
air blast produced what appeared to
be a sound product, with only a
superficial surface film.

During the process of droppaing
segments of wire through the tungsten
arc, 1t was noted that small particles
were ejected from the electrode at
current densities high enough to melt
the electrode tip. The bulk of the
particles ranged in size from 0.010
to 0.020 inch. These results were
duplicated when U-Mo electrodes were
substituted for the tungsten elec-
trodes. The U-Mo electrodes were
prepared by pressing a mixture of the
elemental powders and sintering at
1200°C for 5 hr in a vacuum of 0.5 to
1 micron. The spheroidized particles
did not give a response on exposure
to an alpha counter as did the parent
electrodes and U-Ni particles from an
earlier spraying experiment.

SOLID PHASE BONDING OF METALS

E. S. Bomar J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division

The 1nitial tests on the solid-
phase bonding of metals, performed
essentially as a screening operation,
have been completed. These tests were
undertaken to determine which materials
are easy to bond and which are diffi-
cult to bond. The tests were run on
both sheet stock and sintered-powder
compacts and were performed by stacking
wafers 1n a molybdenum-lined graphite
die. The laminates were hot pressed
for 5 min at 3000 psi at 1150, 1200,
and 1250°C in an argon atmosphere.
Further tests have been run at 1150°C
for 1, 10, and 30 min to determine
the effect of time on the extent of
"bonding. Evaluation of these tests
i1s not complete.

Examination of the first group of
samples revealed little difference in
the degree of bonding at the various
.~ temperatures. As was expected, con-
siderably more diffusien occurred at
- 1250°C than at the lower temperatures,
but bonding was only slightly better.

In general, the variocus couples may
be divided into four groups on the
basis of the extent of bonding: ex-
cellent, interface almost obliterated,
~inseparable; good, interface well
defined, inseparable; fatir, separated
with some difficultyj poor, only
superficial bonding. The couples
studied fall into these categories in
the following manner: '

Excellent

Nickel to Inconel

Nickel to stainless steel

Stainless steel to stainless steel
Iron to iron '

Good

Nickel to iron

Nickel to nickel

Mol ybdenum to nickel foilto molybdenum
Fair . '

Molybdenum to nickel

Meclybdenum to Inconel

Molybdenum to molybdenum
Poor ~

Mol ybdenum to iron

Mol ybdenum to stainless steel _

The self-welding of the molybdenum,
with or without a nickel foil bonding
layer, was poor at 1250°C; so supple-
mentary runs were made at 1400 and
1500°C, with results as indicated
above.

For molybdenum to nickel and mo-
lybdenum to Incomel, there was a
measurable amount of diffusion but
only fair bonding, possibly because
of the formation of a third phase of

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

poor strength at the interface. Ex-
tensive diffusion (2 to 3 mils)
occurred between molybdenum and iron
and molybdenum and stainless steel,
but there was even less bonding than
was found between mol ybdenum and
nickel or between molybdenum and
Inconel. - ﬁ

Further work in which electro-
deposited chromium is used as a bonding
layer is being done on the bonding of
molybdenum to the other metals.
Chromium is reported to be completely
miscible with molybdenum and may be
more compatible with the other ma-
terials.

Several small fuel assemblies have
been prepared by using the electro-
formed nickel screen, filling with
mixtures of UD, and stainless steel
powder, and pressing rubberstatically.
This step is followed by cladding both
sides with iron or nickel sheet and
by hot pressing at 1250°C. The as-
semblies are now being examined for
fuel distribution and bond integrity.

Gaseous Reactions. TInvestigation
of the reaction of gases with columbi-
um was initiated after a literature
survey was made that revealed the
high reactivity of the metal above
400°C and some preliminary high tem-
perature tests made that gave erratic
results., Minute quantities of dis-
solved gases change the mechanical
properties considerably, and hence
these reactions must be controlled.

The primary interest during this
period was in finding a suitable
atmosphere i1n which to conduct creep
tests, An argon atmosphere was
selected, initially, and some of the
observations are presented in Table
12.1. Commercial, tank argon was
purified by drying with a tower of
magnesium perchlorate, followed by

and finally one tower of titanium
sponge at 200°C,

Oxidation in Air. It has been
reported that columbium oxides evapo-
rate between 1200 and 1500°C. Pre-
liminary tests of the stability of
the oxides show that there is a
negligible loss through volatilization
up to 1375°C (see Table 12.2). This
temperature being above that of the
intended investigation, it was decided
to measure the course of oxidation
directly with time by suspending the
sample in the furnace from one arm of
an analytical balance.

The oxidation rates of columbium 1in
dry air have been measured at 600,

800, 1000, and 1200°C. A linear
oxidation rate that becomes more
rapid with increase in temperature 1is
in Table 12.3. The oxidation
tests were made in air flowing at
2 liters/min that was dried by anhy-
drone and a cold trap of acetone and
dry ice mixture prior to entering the
furnace.

At 400°C, columbium undergoes short
periods of rapid oxidation followed
by longer periods of relatively slower
oxidation up to about 20 hours. Beyond
this time, the oxidation rate becomes
linear; that 1s, the weight gain is
proportional to the time of exposure,
The oxide formed on the sample at the
endof 3000 min 1s reasonably adherent.

CREEP RUPTURE TESTS OF

Metallurgy Division

Inconel in Air. Inconel specimens
have been tested 1n an air atmosphere
at stresses ranging from 3000 to 4500
psi at 815°C., The results indicate an
increase in rupture life by a factor
of 10 as compared to tests run in
argon in this stress range. It 1is
thought that subsurface oxygen and
possibly nitrogen may be the elements
influencing the creep rate and pro-
longing the rupture life. Tests are
being designed to investigate the
relative effectsof oxygen and nitrogen
on the creep-rupture properties., It
is postulated at this time that the
creep properties of Inconel in en-
vironments other than air may be
improved by a pretreatment with oxygen
or nitrogen. Experiments will be
conducted to explore this possibility,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

Inconel in Hydrogen. Fine-grained
Inconel specimens have been tested
in a purified dry hydrogen atmosphere
at stresses ranging from 2500 to 7000
psi at 815°C. The results of these
tests as compared with those from
tests made in an argon atmosphere show
a marked decrease in rupture life,
ranging from a 75% decrease at the
lowest stress to a 55% decrease at the
highest stress tested. A similar
series 0f tests 1s being made on
coarse~grained specimens.

Inconel in Molten Fluorides. Tests
of Inconel in the fluoride mixture
Na¥F-ZrF,-UF, {(46-50-4 mole %) are
being made at 815°C at stress levels
from 2500 to 7500 psi. Besults to
date indicate a marked decrease 1in
rupture life that 1s similar in magni-
tude to the rupture life obtained in
tests made 1n a hydrogen atmosphere.,
Figure 12.1 1s a summary of the
available data for Inconel tested at
815°C (1500°F) in the several environ-
ments. {he tentative data for tests
in this fluoride and hydrogen are

Type 316 Stainless Steel in Argon,
Specimens of type 316 stainless steel
have been tested at 815°C in argon
at stresses from 5300 to 7300 psi.
A comparison of these data with those
for Inconel tested in argon shows the
type 316 stainless steel to have a
longer rupture life than that of
Inconel by a factor of 10 at the 5000
psi stress level and by a factor of
3 at the 7000 psi stress level. The
data from creep-rupture tests of
type 316 stainless steel tested 1in
air at the Cornell Aeronautical Lab-
oratory, together with a few tests 1in
an air atmosphere at ORNL, do not
indicate any significant difference
between the rupture life of type 316

argon and the rupture life of those

tested in air.

It will be necessary to complete more

the rupture life increases as the

also been seen 1n argon tests, al-

metallographic studies, together with
x-ray diffraction and vacuum fusion
analyses, will probably be necessary
to determine the structural changes
that promote this behavior.

BRAZING AND WELDING RESEARCH

ARE Welding. A manual entitled
‘““Joint Design for Inert -Arc Welded
Vessels’ was prepared as an aid in
construction of the ARE. This manual
describes the preferable basic joint
design for use i1n pressure vessels
that are to be operated at elevated
temperatures in a severely corrosive
environment.,

Cone-Arec Welding. A topical,
comprehensive report of cone-arc
welding research conducted at this
laboratory is being written for publi-
cation in the Welding Journal Research
Supplement. This report will discuss
the basic principles of the cone-arc
process, the actual physical setup of
the apparatus, and the extent of the
research on the welding of thin- walled
tube-to-header joints.

During the research on the cone-arc
welding of the 0.100-in.-0OD stainless
steel tubes with 0.010-in. wall thick-
ness to the 0.125-in. stainless steel

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 160, 1952

headers, it was noticed that many
welds exhibited a two-pass appearance,
In order that the mechanism of the
cone-arc welding process could be
better understood, an investigation
was conducted to study this phenomenon.
Figure 12.2a¢ shows a microstructure in
a cone-arc weld that resembles, ‘in
many ways, that resulting from a
multiple-pass butt-weld. There were,
apparently, two stages of melting,
with growth of dendrites across the
interface of the two regions.

This two-pass effect apparently
results from the very rapid melting
of the tube during the initial phases
of the welding process. With the tube
flush against the top header surface,
the intense heat of the welding arc
is at first centered upon the thin-
walled tube. The tube apparently
undergoes melting along 1ts length
for a short distance until the thermal-
insulating capacity of the very fine
tube-to-header spacing is overcome.
After this occurs, much of the heat
is then used in melting the header
material. At this time, conditions
are reached that approach more nearly
the equilibrium state, The lower pass
is then that resulting from the initial
phase of the welding, and the upper
pass, represented by the molten weld
pool, remains throughout the major
portion of the welding cycle. '

Since it would seem that the arc
would play more directly upon the
header sheet at the initial point of
striking i1f the tube were recessed 1in
the hole, this technique was employed
in an attempt to eliminate the two-
pass weld., Figure 12.2b 1s a photo-
micrograph of a cone-arc weld in
which the tube was recessed 0.022 inch,
Complete welding occurred, and the
two-pass effect was eliminated. It
should be remembered that the two-pass
weld is not considered as detrimental
but is merely a characteristic of
joints made under certain conditions,

Relatively long arc distances also

joint, As the arc distance increases,

more of the arc beam impinges upon the
header sheet, and the drastic heating
of the tube wall 1s minimized.
Resistance Weldimg. Since 1t 1is
desirable to determine the feasibility
of electrical -resistance spot welding
of stainless steel clad fuel elements
to both themselves and to stainless
steel sheet, an 1nvestigation 1is
being made in which the welding vari-
ables are precisely controlled. The
goal of the preliminary experiments
in this program was merely the produc-
tion of sound, high-strength welds
under conditions that do not materially
harm the core structure of the fuel
elements, Welds were made at several
values of electrode force to obtain
the optimum value, which was considered
to be the minimum force that would
consistently result in crack-free,
nonporous, weld nuggets. DBy using
this optimum electrode force and a
reasonable weld time, experimental
welds were then made over a wide

of metallographic sections of these
welds will enable the determination
of the permissible range of current
over which good welds can be made and
also allow the selection of the most
satisfactory value of welding current.
Any major defects resulting from
welding can also be investigated by
metal lographic sectioning.

A photomicrograph of a sound, high-
strength, spot weld made in 0.030-1in,.

The electrode force used was 800 1b,
the weld time was 5 cycles, and the
welding current was 6300 amp. The
dark etching areas in the cores are
thought to result from the partial
melting of the 1ron portions of the
core metal. The lower limit of the
permissible current range is exhibited
in Fig. 12.3b. The welding conditions
in this case are identical to those
used in Fig. 12.3a except that the
welding current was reduced to 5800

amp. The sheet-to-sheet interface
line has been nearly removed; as a
result, a moderate strength “stick
weld” has been produced. It may be
noted that melting begins at the
stainless steel~core interface instead
of at the usual sheet-to-sheet inter-
face.

Tensile-shear tests on clad fuel
elements that were spot welded under
optimum conditions indicate that
relatively high shear strengths can
be obtained. Strengths of 575 1lb per
spot weld were recorded when a 3/16-in.
restricted-dome electrode was used.
Welds in standard stainless sheet of
the same type and thickness would be
somewhat stronger, but this would be
expected because the nugget size would
also undoubtedly be larger.

Avtomatic Heliarc Machine Welding,
A welding program has been originated
to study the operation and welding
characteristics of a G-E Fillerweld
Machine. This machine consists of a
standard inert-gas heliarc torch with
an auvtomatic filler-wire addition
mechanism. When coupled with amachine
welding carriage, this equipment
presents an excellent means for semi-
automatically welding long straight
joints or, when used in conjunction
with an appropriate cam, joints of
irregul ar and intricate shapes. In an
investigation of the type to be con-
ducted 1n this laboratory, 1t 1s
desirable not only to determine abso-
lute values of the welding variables
but also to study the effects of these
variables upon the gquality of the

welds produced. o .
Preliminary work on this investi-

gation first consisted of adapting
the basic equipment to conform with
the needs of the program. Experiments
have been conducted for the purpose of
gaining familiarity with the process
and for determining the ranges of
welding current and travel speed
necessary to produce satisfactory
welds with various rates of filler-
wire addition. All weld beads have

later the investigation will be

Fabrication of Heat Exchanger
Units, 1Tt is necessary to develop
techniques for successfully brazing
large, complicated, heat exchanger
test assemblies of a type suitable for
aircraft use., An actual unit was
assembled in this laboratory and
subjected to the Nicrobrazing oper-
ation. Figure 12.4 is a photograph
of the heat exchanger brazed in dry
hydrogen by the canning techniqgue.
As can be seen from the photograph,
the fins are badly warped and distorted
and 1in some cases, even brazed to-
gether. After the leak test with
helium, 1t was found that there were
leaks in the tube-to-fin matrix as

well as in the tube-to-header joints
of the manifold section. The tube-to-
header joints could be repaired by
rebrazing, but the leaks in the body
of the unit are almost impossible to
repair successfully. '

Examination of the completed unit
revealed several probable causes for
the leaks and excessive distortion,
This examination has led to techniques
for overcoming these flaws in future
brazing operations. The tube-to-fin
leaks were thought to be caused by
excessive use of Nicrobraz alloy,
with the resultant dissolving away of
the tube walls.
al so tended to aggravate this situ-
ation by allowing puddling of the
molten brazing alloy. The formation
of “hot spots’ in the body of the
assembly was also thought to be a
prevalent condition. ‘A very rapid
heating rate was also an important
factor in the warpage. ’

Techniques that are planned for
incorporation in further brazing
operations are the use of lesser
quantities of Nicrobraz, the use of
several aspilrators to promote more
even hydrogen flow between the fins,
the build-up of the whole assembly off
the can bottom to overcome the drastic
inittial heating rate, and the use of
a slightly lower brazing temperature.

8razing of Copper to Inconmel. The
need for a satisfactory brazing alloy
for joining copper fins to Inconel
tubing has been emphasized. The
resultant braze should have relatively
high strength at 1500°F and should
also be a diffusion barrier against
copper penetration into the Inconel
during service. It seems likely that
some alloy other than a copper-base
alloy would best fill these require-
ments. Nicrobrazing at 1900°F is very
promising, but the alloy does not
completely melt at this temperature.
Tt 1s hoped, however, that the use of
other alloys very similar in compo-

In view of the possibility that it
might be advisable to use copper-base
alloy for the production of these
tube-to-fin joints, several such
alloys are being investigated. Small
melts of Cu-Be, Cu-5S1, Cu-Sn, and
Cu-Mn alloys have been prepared and
are to be tested for flowability
characteristics, oxidation resistance,
and room- and elevated-temperature
tensile strengths. ' :

EVALUATION TESTS OF BRAZING ALLOYS

Metallurgy Division

The results of recent high -tempera-
ture oxidation tests and static cor -
rosion tests in sodium hydroxide,
sodium, and lithium are summarized
in Table 12.4. The high ~temperature
oxidation tests were conducted in
a stream of moist air at 1500°F on T
specimens of Inconel and type 316
stainless steel brazed with the
various alloys. The samples tested
in molten sodium hydroxide at 13500°F
were A nickel T joints brazed with
these alleys. Brazed Inconel and
type 316 stainless steel T joints were
used as specimens for the corrosion
tests in sodium and lithium, The
tensile strength nf several brazed
joints has been examined at room and
1500°F temperatures.

Oxidation of Brazing Alloys. Ex-
amination of metallographic sections
of the high-temperature oxidation
specimens showed the 60% Pd-40% Ni
alloy to be the most oxidation re -
sistant of the brazing alloys tested.
This alloy was unattacked when in
contact with the base metals tested;
the Inconel joint is shown in Fig.
12.5. An example of severe oxidation
is shown in Fig. 12.6, which is the
photomicrograph of a type 316 stainless
steel joint brazed with the 64% Ag-33%

Pd-3% Mn alloy. As a result of this
investigation, it was found that a
brazing alloy in contact with one base
metal may be severely oxidized, whereas
it may be relatively unattacked when
in contact with another base metal,
This might be explained by the fact
that the least oxidation -resistant
constituents of the brazing alloy may
diffuse more readily into certain base
metals than inteo others,

Corrosion of Brazing Alloys by
Sodium Hydroxide. Since A nickel 1is
relatively unattacked by molten sodium
hydroxide at 1500°F, it serves as a
suitable base metal for testing the
corrosion resistance of brazing alloys
in this medium, Examination of a
joint brazed with 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy
and tested in NaOH for 100 hr showed

e
\'.A - ““\ *

that no attack is present, Several
other alloys were attacked, and the
joints brazed with the Cr-Ni-Si-Mn and
the Cr-Ni-Si alloys fractured during
removal from the test capsule.
Corrosion of Brazing Alloys by
Sodium and Lithium. Because brazing
operations may be proposed for as-
sembling fuel plates into subas -
semblies for certailn types of reactors,
it was of interest to study the static
corrosion resistance of brazed joints
in contact with sodium or lithium,
The 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy, which ex-
hibited excellent corrosion resistance
to all other media tested, was severely
attacked by the liquid metals. The
extreme attack of sodium on brazed
Inconel 1is illustrated in Fig. 12.7,
which is the photomicrograph of a

sample tested for 100 hr at 1500°F,
As a check on these results, small
specimens of the pure braze metal
were immersed in the metal baths,
The sample tested in sodium had a
weight loss of over 50%, and the
sample tested in lithium completely
dissolved.

Figure 12.8 is a photomicrograph
of a type 316 stainless steel brazed
with the Cr-Si-Ni-Mn alloy and tested
in sodium for 100 hr at 1500°F. No
attack is exhibited, but the cracking
tendencies of this brazing alloy are
shown very clearly. It was noted that
the cracking of the Cr-Si-Ni-Mn and
Cr-Ni-Si alloys was more severe when
alloyed with stainless steel than when

- alloyed with Inconel.

Tensile Strength of Brazed J01nts.
Results of the room-temperature ten-
sile strength tests of Inconel butt-
joints brazed with Nicrobraz alloy
seem to indicate that a short brazing
time of 10 min or less leads to the

 

Fig. 12.B8.

PERIOCD ENDING DECEMBER 16, 1952

production of weak joints. Samples
held at the brazing temperature for
20 min seem to produce stronger joints.
Figure 12.9 is a photomicrograph of
the room-temperature fracture of a
joint held at the brazing temperature
for 5 minutes. Some Nicrobraz can be
seen in this photograph, but no brittle
fracture is evident. Although the
specimen that was held for 20 min at
the brazing temperature broke near the
brazed joint, no evidence of Nicrobraz
alloy conld be found upon metallo-
graphic sectioning. The greater
alloying of the braze and the base
metal is a result of the increased
diffusion occurring at this longer
time. The increase in tensile strength
of the second bar probably results
from this alloying.

The average of four room-tempera -
ture tensile tests on joints brazed
at short times was 38,300 psi. A
joint brazed for 20 min at the brazing
temperature fractured at 81,700 psi.

Brazing time, 5 min.

The average tensile strength of four
Inconel bars that were heat -treated
similarly was 87,300 psi. This seems
to indicate that if time is allowed
for sufficient diffusion to occur,
joint efficiencies of over 90% can be
obtained. However, a more thorough
investigation of the effect of brazing
time on room-temperature strengths is
being conducted at present,

The tensile strengths of Nicrobrazed
Inconel joints tested at 1500°F were
much more consistent, The average
tensile strength of joints brazed at
short times was 24,400 psi, whereas
the sample brazed for 20 min fractured
at 24,700 psi. Several test bars
failed in the parent metal at a point
definitely not in the diffusion zone
of the brazed joint. The average
elevated-temperature tensile strength
of four Inconel test bars that were
heat treated at the brazing temperature
for 5 min was 23,700 psi. These data
indicate that the Nicrobrazed Inconel
joints at 1500°F are often as strong

as the Inconel base metal, The dif-
fusion of the braze metal while the
specimen 1s at the testing temperature
undoubtedly has some effect upon the
Joint strength at this temperature,

Butt-brazed Inconel test bars
brazed with the 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy
were tested at room and elevated
temperatures. The average room-
temperature tensile strength of these
brazed joints was 87,600 psi, whereas
those tested at 1500°F averaged 21,000
psi. Check bars of Inconel heat
treated for 5 min at 2300°F were also
tested so that the strengths of samples
subjected to the brazing cycle could
be determined. The joint efficiency
at room temperature was found to be
100%, whereas at 1500°F the value
was 93%.

Extremely deleterious effects of
the high-temperature heat treatment
involved in Ni-Pd brazing were not
evident in short-time tensile tests
on Inconel. Inconel 0.252-1n.-dia
tensile bars heat treated for 5 min
at the Nicrobrazing temperature of
2100°F had an average room-temperature
strength of 87,300 psi and an average
1500°F strength of 23,200 psi. Test
bars heat treated for 5 min at the
Ni-Pd brazing temperatures of 2300°F
fractured at an average room-tempera-
ture strength of 84,500 psi and at an
average 1500°F scrength of 22,600 psi.
Thus, the larger grained Inconel has
a tensile strength at room temperature
of only 3.2% less than the finer
grained Inconel; at 1500°F the dif-
ference 1is only 2.6%. Since all
tensile bars 1n the experiments were
machined from the same Inconel rod,
there is indication that heat treat-
ment was the influencing factor,

Melting Point of 60% Pd-40% Ni
Alloy. Although the 60% Pd-40% Ni
brazing alloy has many very desirable
properties, 1its high melting point
might exclude 1ts use in many appli-
cations., In an attempt to lower 1its
melting point by alloying, beryllium
additions of from 0.25 to 4% were
made. A 1% beryllium alloy was found
to have a melting point slightly below
2200°F, but recent tests indicate that
its flowability properties are very
poor. In further attempts to obtain a
lower melting point alloy without
impairment of the corrosion resistance
and physical properties of the basic
alloy, additioms of Al will be made
to the Pd-Ni alloy.

cermet, along with Kennametal 151-a,
is being tested for corrosion resis-
tance in fluorides, Na, and Pb. These
materials appear to be very promising.
Corrosion data and photomicrographs
will be included in the next report.

Attempts to hot press SiC-81 mix-

in the interpretation of BeO-NzakK
compatibility test data, These blocks,

fabricated by the Norton Co., were
made by hot-pressing BeO powder. They
are hexagonal blocks 2 1/8 in. on a

side, 3 11/16 in. in diameter across
center of faces, and 6 in. long. They
are fabricated with a center hole
running axially through the block;
the diameter of the hole (depending on
the position of the block 1n the
reactor core) is 1/2, 1 1/8, or 1 3/4
inches. A visual examination was
made of about 30 blocks of the type
having a 1/2-in.-dia hole. These
blaocks had been sawed in two on a
- plane perpendicular to the long axis.
It was observed that in all cases the
core of the blocks had a different
physical structure than did the outer
portion of the same blocks. In order
to study this core structure, .six
blocks that had not been sawed were
soaked 1n fuchsin dye for 12 hours.
The dye 1s most absorbed in the more
porous areas in the block, and Fig.
12.10, a photograph of one of the
dyed specimens, shows the typical
soft core structure noted in all ‘the
dyed specimens. Samples taken from
the inside and outside surfaces of
these blocks showed density variations
from 2.80 to 2.83 at the outside,
which decreased to 2.26 to 2.43 at the
inside. The apparent porosity of the
dense portion of the block i1s practi-

density and per cent porosity placed
on the block in the location from

shaded areas on the right of the block
indicate the porous portions shown up
by the penetration of the dye. Five
samples of blocks with a 1 3/4-1in.-dia

were also found to have a porous

A general observation was made
regarding the prevalence of cracks in
all the blocks examined. All the
blocks have at least one crack, and
some blocks contain several cracks.
In some cases these cracks are visible
at the surface of the block, but in
the majority of the blocks the cracks
are confined to the interioer portion.
These cracks are quite narrow and

contribute only slightly to the po-
rosity. The presence of one of these
cracks may be observed in Fig. 12.11.

The porous condition developed 1in
the hot-pressed BeO blocks i1is a defect
caused by fabrication. A probable
cause of the defect is that the hot-
pressed die had too tight a fit on the
top and bottom punches around the
central pin, which would cause binding
and therefore uneven pressure appli-
cation. A further factor is faulty
filling of the die, which would cause
bridging of the powder around the pin.
Other factors such as too short time
of applicdation of pressure, too short
time of holding at pressing tempera-
ture, uneven temperature distribution
in the BeO powder because of too rapid
cooling of the die to room
temperature without extracting the
core pin, etc., could also have af-
fected the final density.

The thermal conductivity of the
flnoride mixture NaF-BeF, (57-43 mole
%) was experimentally determined to
be 2.4 Btu/hr-ft-°F over a temperature
range of 452 to 586°C. This result
1s comparable with the thermal con-
ductivities previously obtained for
some of the other fluoride mixtures.
Two new thermal conductivity devices
have been developed and successfully
tested with ordinary liqguids.

The enthalpies and heat capacities
of fuel mixture NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF,
(4.8-50.1-41.3-3.8 mole %) have been
obtained. The heat capacity can be
represented by ¢ = 0,28 + 0.015
cal/cm*°C over theptemperature range

540 to 900°C.

The viscosities and densities of
the fluoride mixtures NaF-ZrF, (50-50
mole %) and NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-25-25
mole %) have been measured with the
modi fied Brookfield viscometer. The
viscosity of the first mixture ranged
from 15 cp at 610°C to 5 cp at 1030°C.
The viscosity of the second mixture
ranged from 20 cp at 650°C to 11 cp
at 880°C. These results are compared
with the viscosity measurements
previously determined for some of the
other fluoride mixtures. Development
of the capillary viscometer is con-
tinuing.

The vapor pressure of NaZrF, in-
creases from 8 mm Hg at 800°C to 30
mm Hg at 900°C; this behavior is
similar te that previously reported
for the NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
mixture. FExperimental values of the
vapor pressure of BeF, measured at
BMI agreed with values calculated at
ORNL..

Preliminary experimental heat
transfer coefficients have been
pbtained for the case of turbulently
flowing NaF-KF-LiF mixture in a long
tube. It appears that heat transfer
with this mixture can probably be
described by the usual forced-convection

174

expressions characterizing ordinary
fluids, as was found to be the case
for molten sodium hydroxide.

Several thermal analyses pertaining
to the reflector-moderated reactor
have been conducted. One study was
made concerning the heat generation
within the reflector and shell of the
reactor. Another analysis consisted
of preparing design charts for cooling-
hole distributions in reactor re-
flectors. An attempt to minimize the
weight and volume of air radiators
has been initiated.

A pyrex thermal convection harp
has been designed and constructed for
an experimental inquiry into harp
convection velocities. The experi-
mental data are to be used to check
the validity of analytical methods
used to predict the circulation
velocities.

An investigation has been initiated
in an attempt to derive a heat-momentum
transfer analogy for the annulus 1in
much the same way as it has been
derived for the pipe system.

An experiment has been designed
that will make possible an experimental
study of the heat transfer charac-
teristics of a simple, fuel-circulating
system; a long pipe will be used in
which the flowing fluid is heated
internally by an electric current.
The experimental results will be
compared with the previously obtained
theoretical results.

results of three independent sets of

Figure 13.1 shows a plot of the

that the thermal conductivities of
these somewhat similar fluoride
mixtures decrease as the uranium
weight percentages increase.

A new thermal conductivity device
for studying both liguids and solids
has been developed that consists of
an electric heater, a thermal con-

has been developed. A thin-walled
metal tube with a small diameter is
immersed in the liguid being studied,
and the tube i1s suddenly heated by a
direct current of electricity. The
transient temperature rise of the
tube 1sa function of the heat capacity
of the tube and the thermal conduc-
tivity, heat capacity, and density of
the liquid. The early part of the
temperature-time function is completely
controlled by the conduction mechanism.
Analyses of the solutions of the
transient conduction equations per-
taining to the system described(?’
show that liquid thermal conductivities
may be determined from the experi-
mental temperature-time measurements.
This transient apparatus has been used
to check the thermal conductivity of
water and glvcerine at room tempera-
ture; the results agree to within
+10% of the values reportedin the lit-

The enthalpy and the heat capacity
of the fuel mixture NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF,
(4.8-50.1-41.3-3.8 mole %) have been
determined by Bunsen i1ce calorimeters
for the temperature range of 540 to
900°C and are given by the equations:
H, (liquid) - Hyo. (solid)

= .15 + 0,287 ,

where H is in cal/g, T in °C, and c,

VISCOSITIES OF FLUCRIDE MIXTURES

Measurements with the Brookfield
Viscometer (R. F. Redmond, T. N. Jones,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division). The viscosities of the
fluoride salt mixtures NaF-ZrF, (50-50
mole %) and NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-25-25
mole %) have been measured with a
Brookfield viscometer contained in an
inert atmosphere. These results are
plotted in Fig, 13.2, together with
the viscosities of several other
fluoride mixtures. The zirconium-
bearing salts have much higher vis-
cosities than NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-
46.5 mole %) and NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %)}; the
beryllium-bearing fluoride mixture
NaF-BeF, (57.0-43.0 mole %) is also
characterized by higher viscosities.
In general, it appears that an increase
in uranium content yields an increase
in the viscosity.

Capillary Viscometer (F. A. Knox,
N. V. Smith, F. Kertesz, Materials
Chemistry Division). The capillary
viscometer previously described(3+*)
has been used to study fused fluorides
over the temperature range of 600 to
800°C. All the materials studied 1in
this apparatus were purified by the
hydrogenation-hydrofluoerination
procedure. The apparatusin its present
form does not sufficiently protect the
mixtures from exposure to air, and
modifications are being made to the
equipment to improve the gquality of
the inert atmosphere maintained over
the melt.

glass capillaries in apparatus of this
type. The use of glass capillaries
with fluorides, even at temperatures
below 650°C, proved impossible, how-
ever, because the innmer surfaces of
the capillaries were attacked to such
an extent that the original
brations could not be reproduced.
The use of small nickel capillaries
(about 0.08-mm bore) tended to cause
plugging by the mixtures being studied.
Larger capillaries (2.4-mm bore)
minimized this difficulty, but they
were impractical for studying low-
viscosity liquids. With the large
capillaries, Reynold’s numbers below
300 were obtained, and the viscosities
measured —- based on calibrations with
glycerol solutions at room tempera-
ture - are probably reliable as
preliminary estimates. The viscosities
of the several fluoride mixtures thus

ment with those presented in Fig. 13.2.

VAPOR PRESSUREL OF MOLTEN FLUCRIDES
H. E. Moore

Materials Chemistry Division

The vapor pressure of ZrF, above
the pure compound NaF-ZrF, (50-50
mole %) is of interest because this
substance will serve as the fuel
carrier introduced initially in the
ARE. Vapor-pressure data for this
salt were obtained in the temperature
range of 795 to 994°C by the method
originally described by Rodebush and
Dixon, (%) which has been discussed in
previous reports.(’*8) The values
obtained, given in Table 13.3, are
best represented by the equation

-7213
m_ff—-+ 7.635 ,

log P =
where P is in mm Hg and T 1s in °K,
The heat of vaporization is 33 kcal/
mole, and the boiling point, calcu-
lated from the equation, is 1244°C,
The vapor pressure of the NaF-ZrF,
(NaZrFs) i1s very similar to that of
the mixture containing 46 mole % ZrF,,
50 mole % NaF, and 4 mole % ur,,
reported previously.(%) This, of
course, 1s not surprising, since
substitution of 8 mole % of NaUF, for
NaZrF, should not greatly influence
the equilibrium pressure of ZrF,.
Verification of results obtained
by this method has been attempted
during the past quarter by using other
procedures applicable to fused salts
at high temperatures. Agreement among
the various methods has, in general,
been encouraging. Values for the
vapor pressure of ZrF, (36 mm Hg at
768°C and 96 mm Hg at 806°C) were
obtained by using a diaphragm apparatus
similar to that used for vapor pressure

The construction and instrumentation
of the experimental system for the
determination of convective heat
transfer coefficients for the fluoride
mixture NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-46.5

system is a modification of the ‘one

All system components, with the
exception of the test section, have
been constructed of Inconel; A nickel

The heat loss calibration and five

expected in the reflector and shell
of the reflector-moderated reactor
(cf., “General Design Studies,’ sec.
3), several radiation source problems
were analyzed. The largest source
of heat in the reflector results from
the absorption of gamma rays generated
in the fuel coolant as a result of
prompt fission and decayof the fission
products. The magnitude of this
source of heat generation was deter-
mined by using three methods of
calculation based on isotropic source
distribution and exponential attenu-
ation. In the first calculation, the
gamma -ray source was assumed to be
distributed uniformly in a spherical
annuilus, and the same absorption
coefficient was assigned to both the
reflector and fuel coolant. 1In the
second method, the source was distrib-
uted uniformly in an infinite slab
of thickness equal to the annulus,
and the true absorption coefficients
of the fuel coolant, shell, and
reflector were used in evaluating the
heat generation from gamma-ray absorp-
tion at any point in the reflector.
The resulting heat generation was
corrected for geometry by a plane-to-
sphere transformation, The third,
and probably the best, approximation
to the true heat generation in the
reflector was obtained by solving for
the current of radiation from the
surface of the fuel cooclant by using
a spherical annulus geometry. Thisg
cirrent was then assumed to enter the
face of a composite slab made up of
the shell and reflector that surround
the fuel coolant. The resulting heat
generation was then transformed from
a slab geometry to a spherical geometry.

A secondary source of heat gener-
ation in the reactor reflector and
shell arises from the absorption of
gamma rays generated by neutron capture
in the reflector and shell. 1In order
to evaluate this source of heat gener-
ation, a general solution was deter-
mined for the case of a nonuniform
source of radiation in a slab geometry

in which the mneutron flux could be
approximated by a power series or
exponential expression,(

In order to simplify the com-
putation of the maximum temperature
rise in the reflector resulting from
heat generation, general design charts
that give this temperature rise for
various values of heat generation,
coolant-hole diameter, thermal con-
ductivity, and coeolant-hole spacing
were prepared for several pertinent
materials. (?1) :

Analysis of Fluid-to-Air Radiators.
The design of the air radiator for
transferring the heat generated in the
reactor coolant to the air propulsion
stream flowing through the turbojet
engines has been analyzed in an effort
to minimize air radiator welght and
size. An analysis of the radiator
volume, weight, and pressure drop was
made for fixed conditions of power
output, mass velocity per frontal
area, and thermal conditions for a
design in which plane-plate, finned
radiators of stainless steel and
nickel are used. In arriving at a
solution, the heat transfer coeffi-
cients for the radiator were deter-
mined on the basis of laminar flow
through flat ducts, since the Reynold’s
number for flow through the radiation
over the pertinent range of conditions
was less than 2000, Multiple calcu-
lations were made for a range of values
of tube diameter, fin thickness, fin
spacing, and tube pitch. On the basis
of this evaluation, the optimum
radiator design appears to be that
with tube diameters between 1/8 and
1/4 in., 20 to 30 fins per inch, a fin
thickness of 0.010 in., and a patch
of three times the tube diameter.

the theoretical and experimental
behavior of this volume heat source
system. A sulfuric acid solution: is
to be circulated in a closed loop by
means of aglass pump. An a-c electric
current is to be passed through the
acid flowing in a long plastic pipe
(1/4 in. in inside diameter and 2-ft
long) located in the flow system. The
current flow will yield a volume heat
source within the acid. Acid flow
rates, pipe wall temperatures, and
mixed-mean acid temperatures into and
out of the test section will be
measured. Test section and heat
exchanger heat balances will also be
made. The temperature differences 1in
this system will lie within the range
necessary to yield only minor changes
in electrical resistivity of the acid,
so an almost uniform volume heat source
exists in the system., It is proposed
to study both laminar and turbulent
flow regimes.

Radiation-damage studies of ma-
terials exposed in the ORNL graphite
reactor, the LITR, and the 86-in.
cyclotron have continued. A sample of
a zirconium-bearing fused fluoride
fuel has been irradiated with a high
flux 1n the MTR, but examination of
the irradiated capsule and its con-
tents has, not yet been made. A sodium-
filled loop was operated in the LITR
at about 1200°F, but it was shut down
after seven days because of a flow
stoppage.

Additional irradiations of fuel
have been carried out in the LITR at
ARE fission rates for extended periods
of time. High power dissipations, in
the range that would occur in an air-
craft reactor, were achieved for long
periods of time in fuels by using 22-
Mev protons from the cyclotron, and
there was some indication, but no
positive evidence, of radiation damage
or radiation-induced corrosion.

In-reactor cantilever creep measure-
ments on Inconel in an air atmosphere
were continued in both the graphite
reactor and the LITR. From these more
recent measurements, 1t appears that
the radiation has only a small effect
on the creep strength. Examination of
some of the older test rigs showed
that the decrease in creep strength
previously reported could possibly
have been due todefective extensometer
devices. Apparatus is being con-
structed for creep measurements 7in the

MTR.

These radiation damage studies are
described in the following. Additional
information is contained in the Solid
State Division Quarterly Progress
Report for the Period Ending November
10, 1952.

The installation in the MTR of the
testing facility for fused salts was
completed, The guide tube extends
from a 1 3/8-in, hole in a beryllium
“A’ piece through a specially designed
flange in the north-tank access hole.
In the first run, a l-in. column of
salt was contained in a 0,1-1in,-1ID
Inconel capsule. The capsule tempera-
ture was maintained at 1500°F by means
of a controlled flow of cooling air.
The flux at the capsule position was
determined by means ofcobalt wire with
the MTR operating at 19 and at 25
megawatts. The estimated thermal flux
for the first capsule run at 30 mega-
watts was 2,1 x 104,

The capsule contained a fuel with
the composition NaF-ZrF -UF, (50.0-
46.2-3.8 mole %). It was maintained
at 1500°F for 116 hr at full flux, and
there was an estimated power dissipation
of 1900 watts/cm® in the fused salt,
This approaches the power density
expected 1in an aircraft reactor,
Examinations of the irradiated capsule
and the salt are now being made, In
addition, two capsules containing the
fuel have been irradiated in the LITR
at 140 watts/cm® for 565 hr, and two
more have been placed in the LITR for

1000-hr tests. Examinations of the
irradiated materials are now being
made. ‘

Preparations are nearing com-
pletion for melting-point checks and
fission-fragment-activity determi-
nations on all specimens of reactor-
irradiated fuel. Equipment has been
constructed for rocking a capsule so
that the fuel will cycle through a
thermal gradient; this equipment will
be used when a horizontal beam hole in
the LITR is available for the experi-
ments. :

Inconel capsules containing fuels
NaF-KF-Z¢F -UF, (4.8-50.1-41.3-3.8
moele %) and NaPV-ZrF, -UF, (46-50-4
mole %) were bombarded with 22-Mev
protons from the 86-in. cyclotron.
Power densities of several thousand
watts per cubic centimeter of irradi-
ated fuel were used for periods up to
92 hours, In evaluating the effects
of theirradiation, only metallographic
examinations of the Inconel could be
considered reliable, since the irradi-
ated volume of the capsule containing
the fuel was large enough to cause a
threefold dilution of dissolved
Inconel components., For each experi-
ment, listed in Table 14.1, there was

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

a furnace-heated control that showed
0.5-m11 paits. Tt can be seen that
there is some indication of attack on
the Inconel at the higher power
densities, : '

An Inconel loop containing sodium
was operated in the LITR at a tempera-
ture in the region of 1200°F for seven
days. The loop was shut down and re-
moved because of a flow stoppage; the
reason for the stoppage is now being
determined.

A prototype pump for use in an MTR
fluoride loop 1s being constructed.
Fabrication of other portions of the
loop is being delayed until information
about the MIR capsule tests i1s obtained
and further evaluwation can be made of
the experiment planned. |

Additional cantilever creep tests
on Inconel with the standard ARE 2-hr,
1700°F anneal were carried out at
1500°F in air atmospheres in the
graphite reactor and the LITR. As
shown in Figs., 14.1 and 14.2, there
are only small differences between the
bench and in-reactor tests, The upward
deflection after 400 hr in the curve
for the 3000-psi test in the ORNL
graphite reactor is probably due to
faulty operation of the temperature
controller. The results are to be
checked by postirradiation measure-
ments of the creep deflections on a
remotely controlled profilometer.

Postirradiation measurements were
made on specimens annealed at 1650°F
and irradiated in the graphite reactor
at 1500°F., Their creep curves were
shown in a previous report¢?!) as curve
A, 1500 psi, and curve C, 2000 psa,
The profilometer measurements indicated
that the large extensions which were
measured were in error and that the
actual extensions were not much
greater than those occurring in the
bench tests. Several tests reported
last quarter as being 1n progress were
negated by faulty microformers,

The design for the bellows-loaded
tensile crecep test in the MIR is near-
ing completion, and most of the com-
ponents have been fabricated
partly assembled for test.

An empirical volumetric method for
the determination of zirconium 1n
reactor fuels has been developed. The
method 1s based on the measurement of
the basicity produced by the reaction
between zirconium hydroxide and excess
potassium fluoride. An 1indirect
volumetric method for the determina-
tion of zirconium, which depends on
precipitating zirconium as the slightly
soluble benzoate or m-nitrobenzoate
and subsequently determining the
organic acid by titration, proved
unsatisfactory because of the variable
composition of the precipitate. At-
tempts to determine zirconium by
titrating zirconium m-nitrobenzoate in
nonaqueous media with perchloric acid
were not successful. The use of
mandelic acid as a precipitant for
zirconium in the presence of a large
excess of uranium was shown to be
superior to phenylarsonic acid,
m-nitrobenzoic acid, and cainnamic
acid.

The stability of the chromium
complex with diphenylcarbazide was
increased by development of the complex
in 0.2 N perchloric acid. The separa-
tion of traces of aluminum 1n reactor
fuels by means of anionic-exchange
resins was studied; preliminary results
indicate that this technique is feasi-
ble. A bibliography of recent litera-
ture on bromine trifluoride as a
reagent for the determination of oxygen
in metallic oxides has been started.
An improved apparatus for the determi-
nation of trace amounts of water in
solids was designed and fabricated for
measuring the electrical conductivity
of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to
determine 1ts water concentration.

190

In addition to the chemical analy-
ses, various compounds of 1nterest
were examined by spectrographic or
petrographic techniques. The useful-
ness of the spectrograph has been
enhanced by the construction of a
source that is good for temperatures
approaching 2850°C. The petrographic
studies have led to the classification
of many complex compounds that are not
found 1n the literature.

The work of the ANP Analytical
Laboratory service group consisted
chiefly of analyses of beryllium- and
zirconium-bearing fluoride mixtures.
A review of the methods used and a
summary of the services performed are
included.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF REACTOR FUELS

J. C. White J. E. Lee, Jr.
C. M. Bovyd W. J. Boss
C. K. Talbott

Analytical Chemistry Division

The research and developmental work
on methods for the analysis of reactor
fuels and their components has been
of a diversified nature during thais
quarter. The primary interest has
been in the development of a volumetric
method for the determination of zir-
conium. Other problems that have been
studied include: the colorimetric
determination of chromium; the de-
termination of oxygen 1n metallic
oxides; the separation and determina-
tion of traces of aluminum 1n reactor
fuels; the determination of water 1in
components of reactor fuels; the
design of apparatus that will permit
the measurement of the conductivity
of liquid hydrofluoric acid so that
1its water content can be determined;
the 1dentification of the products
that are produced by the reaction of
- NaK and components of the fuels; the
adaptation of a method for the de-
termination of Be0 in NaK; and the
adaptation of a method for the de-
termination of UOQ, in UF,. A discus-
sion of these problems 1s included in

the following paragraphs.
Zirconium. An empirical volumetric

method for the determination of zir-
conium has been developed. The method
15 based on the measurement of the
basicity produced by the reaction
between zirconium hydroxide and excess
potassium fluoride, which was discussed
in a previous report.(!) TFree acid in
the starting solution in excess of
0.5 N produced results approximately
2% high. This interference can be
overcome by dilution; a practical
limitation must be 1imposed, however,
because of the difficulty encountered
in determining the end point. The use
of acid media other than sulfuric acid
was also explored. Only perchlorate
systems were definitely unsatisfactory
because of excessive hydrolysis at
high acidity.

Another approach to the development
of a volumetric method for zirconium
was to precipitate the hydroxide from
a mineral acid solution with excess
ammonium hydroxide, centrifuge, wash,
and dissolve in standard acid; the
excess of standard acid was determined
by titration. This method 1s satis-
factory in an academic sense, but 1is
hardly practical because of the copious
washing required to free the hydrous
oxide from basic salts and excess
precipitant. j

The guantitative precipitation of
zirconium by benzoic acid and nitro-
benzoic acids has been reported.¢2?:3)

PERTOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

The reported method was used as a
basis for formulating a volumetric
method in which the precipitate 1is
dissolved in dilute acid, and the
liberated organic acid 1is extracted
with ethyl ether and determined by
titration in methyl alcohol-benzene
solution with sodium methylate by
using thymol blue as the indicator.
However, a precipitate of varying
composition is formed, and attempts
to establish an empirical relationship
were unsuccessful.

Further study of the reported
gravimetric methods showed low results
in all cases, the extent being de-
pendent upon the mnature of the medium
of precipitation. For example, 1in a
sulfate system, no precipitate 18
formed with benzoic acid because of
the strength of the zirconium sulfate
complex in solutions that are more
acid than pH 3 to 4. A slight pre-
cipitate was noted when m-nitrobenzoic
acid was used as the precipitant.
Nitric or hydrochloric acid solutions
are recommended for this procedure.

An attempt was made to titrate
zirconium m-nitrobenzoate with per-
chloric acid in ethylene glycol~
isopropyl alcohol solutien. Zirconium
1s not sufficiently basic in this
medium, however, to give a distinct
break in the potentiometric titration
made by using a glass electrode as
the indicator electrode and a calomel
electrode as the reference electrode.

Since mandelic acid gives a pre-
cipitate of definite composition with
zirconium, this reagent will be
studied for application to volumetric
procedures. '

The effect of large excesses of
uranium on the gravimetric determina-
tion of zircomium was studied briefly
in an attempt to select the precipitant
least affected. Four reagents, phenyl-
arsonic acid, mandelic acad, m-nitro-
benzoic acid, and cinnamic acid, were
tested on solutions of zirconium
containing a fivefold excess of
uranium. . The number of determinations

191
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

made was i1nsufficient to permit a
statistical study; however, the re-
sults clearly 1i1ndicated that the
mandelic acid method was superior 1in
the presence of uranium. Phenylarsonic
acid gave slightly high results;
m-nitrobenzoic acid, slightly low
results. Cipnamic acid 1s unsatis-
factory for this purpose; the average
of three determinations in the uranium-
containing solution was 15% lower than
the amount taken.

chromium. The chromium-diphenyl-
carbazide complex 1s usually developed
in 0.2 N H,S0,, a medium said to
produce maximum stability of the
complex, Thirty minutes is considered
the maximum period before serious
fading occurs. The use of 0.2 N
perchloric acid solution increases the
period of color stability to nearly
60 min, regardless of the oxidant
used. Acid concentrations greater
than 0.2 N are harmful; for example,
0.6 N prevents color formation en-
tirely.

Aluminum. The determination of
traces of aluminum can be accomplished
by means of “aluminon’*) reagent;
however, complete separation from a
number of interfering cations 1is
necessary. JIn order to apply this
method to reactor fuels, aluminum must
be separated from zirconium and 1iron.
A chemical separation based om con-
trolled-acidity precipitation with
*“oxidine” was unsuccessful. Separation
by 10on exchange 1s currently being
studied. One procedure is to retain
the zirconium and uranium as sulfate
complexes on an anionic exchanger that
passes aluminum. An alternate pro-
cedure 1s to retain both aluminum and
zirconium as fluoride complexes and
separate them by elution, as reported
by Freund and Miner. (%) Results on

these tests are inconclusive, but
promising.

Oxygen. The preparation of a
bibliography of recent literature on
bromine trifluoride has been started
in connection with the design and

fabrication of experimental equipment

for work with this reagent. Of special
interest are the physical data, the
inorganic oxide fluorimations, and

the material corrosion information.

Water. Developmental work on the
me thod for determining traces of water
in solids 1n a finely divided state
was completed with the successful
testing of an apparatus that has re-
duced the blank {(that is, before
addition of the samples) to approxi-
mately 15 mg of water., This method
has been reported in more detail 1in
previous reports(?!? and a formal
report will be i1ssued in the near
future.

The concentration of water 1in
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride can be
conveniently determined by measuring
1ts electrical conductivity. A pro-
cedure(®’) has been developed and used
for determining the water content of
the HF used as a cover gas in fuel
preparation. The two cylinders tested
thus far showed 0.5 and 0.35 wt %

water.

0.2 ug per milliliter of solution. A
method was developed for this dis-
solution in which NaK was submerged in
a high-boiling-point inert hydrocarbon
(2,2,5-trimethylheptane) and reacted
slowly by drop-wise addition of methyl
alcohol. This procedure provides a
rapid and safe method for dissolving
alkali metal eutectics.

SPECTROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

C. R. Baldock
Stable Isotope Research and
Production Davision

For some time it has been recognized
that an extremely high-temperature
ion-source oven was needed for the
investigation of such refractory
materials as the oxides and other
compounds of uranium. A direct-heating
type of oven has been constructed that
makes possible heating of materials to
a temperature that approaches the
melting point of tantalum (2850°C).
The oven 1s small, contains no thermal
insulating material, and 1s thereby
free of the need for troublesome
outgassing. The heater i1s mounted on
a subassembly that i1is easily attached
to and removed from the i1on source;
thus, 1t 1s easy to change samples.
Because of the favorable sample loca-
tion, considerable improvement 1in the
ion-generating efficiency has been ob-
tained, compared with that of previous
equipment. Quite satisfactory analy-
ses can be performed with much less
than 1 mg of sample. |

Uranium Oxides. Three oxides of
uranium, UO,, UOQ,, and U,0,, have
been i1nvestigated 1in considerable
detail. The presence of these materi-
als as 1mpurities in aircraft fuels
or in other uranium compounds can now
be detected with high precision. :

Nickel Fluoride. In an effort to
explain the existence of some non-
stoichiometric compounds of nickel and
fluorine, several tests were made on
NiF, material. The prepared NiF, was

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1952

carried to charge exhaustion 1n an
older socurce oven that reached a tem-
perature of 750°C. The residue of
this test was subsequently examined
at 1100°C 1in the new type of oven
heater, and i1t proved to be nickel
oxide (NiO). Evidence from this
subsequent test proved that above
1100°C the NiO dissociates by thermal
decomposition to nickel and oxygen.
It was of interest that the oxygen
came off as O,. : :

PETROGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF FLUORIDES

G, D. White, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

Routine petrographic examinations
of some 600 samples of fluoride mix-
tures were made in comnection with
fuel investigations. The products of
the ZrQ, -HF reaction and the NaF-ZrOF,
reaction have been examined in some
detail. |

Zr0,-HF. A petrographic analysis
was made of the products of the reac-
tion between Zr(Q, and 48% HF, reacted
at room temperature; two phases were
observed. Chemical analysis gave
compositions that were approximately
those of hydrates of ZrF,. The first
of these phases 1s uniaxial, which
indicates that it is either tetragonal
or hexagenal. The index of refraction
parallel to the ¢ axis is 1.504, ‘and
parallel to the other axes 1s 1.528.
The second phase 1s biaxial negative,
which indicates that it 1s either
triclinic, monoclinic, or orthorhombic.
The crystals are tabular and have a
fibrous structure; cleavage is good.
The birefringence is low; the maximum
interference color 1s a first-order
red. The refractive indexes range
from 1.42 to 1.47 and thus indicate a
variation in the water content of the
material. ' :

NaF-ZrOF,. Sodium fluoride was
reacted with zirconium oxyfluoride
which had been prepared in the labora-
tory. Well-developed, but small,

193
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

ZrO, crystals were formed, and there
was some NazZrF, in the 2Na¥F.ZrOF,
mixture. There was also a very small
amount of another phase, probably NaF,
that had a low index of refraction.
These products would be expected to
form if the following reaction took
place:

2(2NaF'ZrOF2)"““"> NayZrF, + Zr0, + NaF.

The ZrO, crystals, together with
what is thought to be Na,ZrF,, were
formed in the NaF-ZrOF, mixture. This
would be expected from the following
reaction:

2{NaF.ZrOF,) —> Na,ZrFg t Zr0, .

The * ammonium oxalate insolubles”

procedure(®? for the determination of
U0, in UF, was applied successfully to
the determination of UO, in UF,. The
trifluoride is more resistant than the
tetrafluoride to complexing with
oxalate 1on and requires a reflux
period of about 8 hr for a 1- to 2-g
sample. It is postuvlated that the
mechanism of the reaction involves the
slow oxidatian of UF, to UF, and its
subsequent complex formation with
oxalate 1on.

SERVICE CHEMICAL ANALYSES

In order to determine zirconium 1in
the corrosion test samples to which
titanium had been added either as the
metal or the hydride, 1t was necessary
to use mandelic acid as the precipi-
tating agent, since titanium 1s pre-
cipitated along with zirconium when
phenylarsonic acid is employed.

Recent spectrographic analysis of
the zirconium oxide residues from
ignition of the phenylarsonic acid
precipitates has shown that varying
amounts of arsenic remain with the
zirconium. If conditions for complete
volatilization of the arsenic durang
ignition cannot be established, the
mandelic acid method will be used to
replace the present method for de-
termining zirconiuim.

In order to study the reactions
that take place when NaK 1s introduced
into molten zirconium fuel, a pro-
cedure that i1ncluded measuring the
hydrogen evolved during dissolution

(E)Ibid. » P. 81,

 
of the sample im acid was employed.
It was hoped that this method would
give an accurate measure of the UF,
formed during the reaction with NaK.
However, the results indicate that
other compounds or possibly metals are
formed that evolve hydrogen, since
more hydrogen than can be attributed
to the formation of UF, is often
evolved. The isolation and subsequent
determination of UF; in samples of
this type have not been accomplished,
and further work will be necessary to
develop an adequate method.

There was an increase 1n the number
of samples of beryllium-sodium~uranium
fluoride eutectic analyzed during this
period. Requests for the estimation
of the concentration of the major
constituents of the eutectic made
necessary the adaptation of methods
for determining uranium and berylliium.
Since the uranium concentration was
relatively high (15 to 25%) and beryl-
lium caused no interference, the use
of the Jones reductor with a final
oxidation titration with ceric sulfate
proved adequate for determining this
element. An estimate of the beryllium
content was made by precipitating the
uranium and beryllium together with
ammonium hydroxide, igniting the pre-
cipitates to the oxides, and subtract-
ing the weight of the uranium oxide,
as previously determined by titration,
from the weight of the combined
oxides. The weight of beryllium oxide
is thus obtained by difference. A
separation step, which includes re-
duction of uranium with zinc amalgam
and precipitation with cupferron,
serves to remove the uranium prior to
precipitation of the beryllium with
ammonia; the ignited beryllium oxide
is then free from contamination with
uranium. This method of analysis has
been employed recently for samples_of
beryllium eutectic.

One series of samples of lead was
tested for minor impurities by apply-
ing colorimetric methods after removal
of the lead by electrolytic deposition.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 106, 1952

Samples of alkali hydroxides de-
rived from corrosion tests were ana-
lyzed for iron, chromium, and nickel.
The range of comncentraticn of impuri-
ties in these samples was great enough
to require the use of colorimetric and
gravimetric methods. Since the
material was not homogeneous and could
not be ground to fine particle size,
the entire sample was dissolved to
ensure that the aliquot tested was
representative of the batch.

A few purified alkali hydroxide
samples were tested for carbonate
impurity by reacting the carbon dioxide
evolved with standard barium hydroxide
solution. The excess barium hydroxide
was then titrated with standard hydro-
chloric acuid.

A number of Sodlum samples was
analyzed for the General Electric
Company. Each sample was tested for
sodium monoxide content, and selected
samples of the series were analyzed
for minor 1impurities.

A greater diversity of miscellaneous
samples was tested during the quarter,
but further description of the samples
or details of the methods will not be
attempted in this report.

Of the total of 905 samples ana-
lyzed during the quarter, 617 were
submitted by the Reactor Chemistry
group, 167 by the ANP Experimental
Engineering group, 68 by the ANP
Critical Experiments group, 34 by the
General Electric Company, 17 by the
Flectromagnetic Research group, and
2 by the Ceramic laboratory. The
backlog of samples was reduced during
the period by approximately 50%, as
indicated in the summary, Table 15.1.
