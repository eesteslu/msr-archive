Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid

fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in -

suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of
the effort begun over 19 years ago in the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion program to make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at
ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program. '

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while simul-

taneously conserving and extending the nation’s fuel

resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233UF, dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but it could be started up with 23*U or plu-
tonium. The fertile material would be ThF, dissolved
in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar
composition. The technology being developed for the
breeder is also applicable to high-performance converter
reactors. _

‘A major program activity is the operation of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This reactor was built
to test the types of fuels and materials that would be
used in thermal breeder and converter reactors and to
provide experience with the operation and maintenance

" of a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE operates at 1200°F

and at atmospheric pressure and produces about 8.0 Mw

in the primary heat exchanger, and the coolant salt is
pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to the
atmosphere. '

Design of the MSRE started in the summer of 1960,
and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962. Pre-
nuclear testing was begun in August of 1964, and, fol-
lowing some modifications, the reactor was taken criti-
cal on June 1, 1965. Zero-power experiments were com-
pleted early in July. After additional modifications,
maintenance, and sealing of the containment, operation
at a power of 1 Mw began in January 1966.

At the 1-Mw power level, trouble was experienced
with plugging of small ports in control valves in the off-
gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like organic
materials. These materials are believed to be produced
by radiation polymerization of a very small amount of
oil that vaporizes after leaking through a gasketed seal
into the tank of the fuel circulating pump. This diffi-
culty was overcome by installing a specially designed
filter in the off-gas line.

Full power was reached in May 1966, and the plant
was operated at full power for about six weeks. Then
one of the radiator cooling blowers (which were left
over from the ANP program) broke up from mechanical
stress. While new blowers were being procured, an array

- of graphite and metal surveillance specimens was taken

of heat. The initial fuel contained 0.9 mole % UF,,

5 mole % ZrF,, 29 mole % BeF,, and 65 mole % "LiF,
a mixture which has a melting point of 840°F. The
uranium was about 33% *35U. - |
‘The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an
external pump and heat exchange system. All this equip-
ment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybde-

num-iron-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to
- corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at

high temperature. The reactor core contains an assem-
bly of graphite moderator bars that are in direct con-
tact with the fuel. The fuel salt does not wet the
graphite and therefore does not enter the pores. Heat
produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant salt

Xi

from the core and examined..

Power operation was resumed in October 1966 with
one blower; then in November the second blower was

“installed, and full power was again attained. After a

shutdown to remove salt that had accidentally gotten
into an off-gas line, the MSRE was operated in Decem-
ber and January at full power for 30 days without in-
terruption. The next power run was begun later in
January and was continued for' 102 days, until termi-
nated to remove a second set of graphite and metal
specimens. An additional operating period of 46 days
during the summer was interrupted for maintenance
work on the sampler-enricher when the cable drive
mechanism jammed.

 

 
 

In September 1967, a run was begun which continued
for six months, until terminated on schedule in March
1968. Power operation during this run had to be in-
terrupted once when the reactor was taken to zero
power to repair an electrical short in the sampler-

- enricher.

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the objec-
tive was to demonstrate on a small scale the attractive
features and technical feasibility of these systems for
civilian power reactors. We believe this objective has
been achieved and that the MSRE has shown that
molten-fluoride reactors can be operated at.tempera-
tures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on either
the metal or graphite parts of the system, that the fuel
is completely stable, that reactor equipment can operate
satisfactorily at these conditions, that xenon can be
removed rapidly from molten salts, and that, when

necessary, the radioactive equipment can be repaired or

replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in August
1968, when a small facility in the MSRE building was
used to remove the original uranium charge from the
fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,. In six days of
fluorination, 219 kg of uranium was removed from the
molten salt and loaded onto absorbers filled with
sodium fluoride pellets. The decontamination and re-
covery of the uranium were very good.

While the fuel was being processed, a charge of 233U
that had been made in the Savannah River reactors was
converted to UF,4-LiF enriching salt in ORNL’s Tho-
rium-Uranium Recycle Facility. The enriching salt was
added to the original carrier salt, and in October 1969
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 233U, The nuclear characteristics with the 233U

were close to the predictions, and, as expected, the re-

actor was quite stable. One surprise was a considerable
increase in the amount of gas entrained in the salt,
which made the reactor power very noisy. A slight re-

xii

duction in the pump speed eliminated the gas. We are
investigating why the gas behavior was different after
the fuel was processed.

A large part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
now being devoted to future molten-salt reactors. Con-
ceptual design studies are being made of breeder reac-
tors, and an increasing amount of work on materials, on
the chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, and on proc-
essing methods is included in the research and develop-
ment program.

Until recently, most of our work on breeder reactors
was aimed specifically at two-fluid systems in which
graphite tubes would be used to separate uranium-
bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile salts.
We think attractive reactors of this type can be de-
veloped, but several years of experience with a proto-
type reactor would be required to prove that graphite
can serve as piping while exposed to high fast-neutron
irradiations. As a consequence, a one-fluid breeder was
a long-sought goal.

About a year ago two developments established the
feasibility of a one-fluid breeder. The first was demon-
stration of the chemical steps in a process which uses
liquid bismuth to extract protactinium and uranium
selectively from a salt that also contains thorium, The
second was the recognition that a fertile blanket can be
obtained with a salt that contains uranium and thorium
by reducing the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part
of the core. Our studies show that a one-fluid, two-
region breeder can be built that has fuel utilization
characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid de-
signs and probably better economics. Since the graphite
serves only as moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more
nearly a scaleup of the MSRE.

These features caused us to change the emphasis of
our breeder program from the two-fluid to the one-fluid
breeder. Most of our design and the development effort

‘are now directed to the one-fluid system.

Summary

PART 1. MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
1. MSRE Operations

This report period covered the loading of 233U,
zero-power experiments with the new fissile material,
and the resumption of full-power operation.

Criticality was attained by melting UF,-LiF eutectic
salt containing 33.3 kg of uranium (91% 233U) into the
carrier salt from which the original uranium had been
stripped. The critical loading was only 1% less than
predicted. Reactivity coefficients and control rod worth
were also in acceptable agreement with predictions.

‘Dynamics tests showed that the system was stable at all

power levels, and the experimental transfer functions
fitted the theoretical curves.

Shortly after the beginning of fuel-salt circulation,
beryllium metal was exposed to the salt to increase the
reducing power. At that time the amount of blanket gas
entrained in the circulating fuel increased from less than
0.1 vol % to about 0.6 vol % and remained there.
Various experiments were done in efforts to elucidate
the effect of the beryllium. The entrained gas was
practically eliminated from the fuel loop by operatmg
the pump at slightly reduced speed.

During the approach to power, small perturbatlons '

were observed in the nuclear power and some other
system variables. These were tentatively ascribed to
gradual accumulation and sudden release of gas from
somewhere in the core. The perturbations ceased when

the circulating void fraction was reduced.

The fuel off-gas line partially plugged near the pump
bowl during the zero-power experiments, and an accu-
mulation of frozen salt mist was removed before the
beginning of power operation.

Component performance was generally good, but a
loose gear in the fuel-sampler drive mechanism caused a
three-week shutdown in December, delaying the start of

~ power operation. At the end of the period, fuel had

been in the core continuously for 47 days, during which
time the integrated power amounted to 747 equivalent
full-power hours.

- 2. Component Development

The MSRE-type freeze flange undergoing thermal
cycle testing was inspected after 321 cycles. The crack
observed first after 268 cycles had extended only
slightly. Cycling was resumed.

The mark 2 fuel pump, which features a deeper bowl,
began test operation with molten salt and accumulated
a total of 4000 hr. The only difficulty was periodic
plugging of the off-gas line with what appeared to be
frozen salt mist.

3. Instrumentation and Controls

Daily tests of rod-scram relays turned up no more
failures. (Three of fifteen failed in the previous six
months.) Two fission chamber failures occurred after
nine months and one year of service respectively. The
improvement over the three-month average life was
attributed to improved sealing against water intrusion.
Neutron chambers were installed in the drain tank cell
for the 223U loading and were afterwards removed.
Only minor modifications were made in the instru-
mentation and controls.

A moderate number of minor failures occurred in the
on-line digital computer. Numerous software changes
were made in support of reactor operations and
experiments. The conversational-mode calculational

language FOCAL was adapted to the BR-340, making

possible engineering calculations in the background
time interspersed with the routine monitoring and
computing operations of the computer.

4. MSRE Reactor Analysis

Nuclide changes and  reactivity effects during ex-
tended power operation with 233U were computed

- using updated cross-section data. The computed distri-

xiii

bution of fissions was 94% in 233U, 4% in 23°Py, and
2% in 235U at the beginning, with the 23°Pu fissions
slowly decreasing and the 233U fissions increasing with
integrated power. The reactivity effect of long-term
changes in nuclides (exclusive of uranium burnup) was
computed to be —1.1 X 1077 §k/k per megawatt-hour,

 
 

Analysis of rod-drop experiments gave a total worth
of one control rod, near the minimum critical uranium
loading, of 2.58 + 0.05% 6k/k. The uranium concentra-
tion coefficient of reactivity was inferred to be about
5% smaller than had been predicted. New rod-
calibration curves for use in the on-ine reactivity
balance calculations were derived from the experiments.

A method for the calculation of time variations in
reactivity corresponding to specified variations in the
fission rate was developed and used to analyze some
observed “blips” in the MSRE power level.

Theoretical analysis of the dynamic stability of the
MSRE with 233U fuel was extended to obtain the
power dependence of all the eigenvalues of the system
mathematical mode. The dependence exhibited the
expected tendency of the system to become more
sluggish in retuming to its original state at lower power
levels.

PART 2. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

5. Design

Design study of a 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR power
station was continued. The plant layout remains essen-
tially the same except that the reactor cell diameter was
increased to 66 ft to accommodate a larger reactor
vessel. The cell wall construction was modified to
provide double containment of the radioactive systems.

The size of zone I of the reactor core was increased to
14 ft diam X 13 ft high, and other dimensions were
adjusted to reduce the damage neutron flux to assure a

 4-year life for the core graphite and a 30-year life for

the reflector graphite. The latter will then not require
provisions for routine replacement.

The undermoderated region surrounding the most
active portion of the core was redesigned to use 2-in. by
10-in. by 14-ft-long slabs of graphite rather than
graphite spheres. This region contains 37% by volume
of salt as in the previous concepts.

The reflector graphite was redesigned to make use of
larger pieces and to assure a well-defined passage for
flow of fuel salt to cool the reactor vessel wall. The fuel
salt will flow radially inward from the wall annulus to
cool the reflector graphite.

Axial reflectors were added at the top and bottom to
improve the nuclear performance and to reduce the
damage flux on the Hastelloy N vessel heads. The lifting
rods used to remove the entire core assembly for
graphite replacement are now removable to eliminate
the poisoning effect during normal operation.

The top of the primary heat exchanger was modified
to use L-shaped tubes and a vertical tube sheet. The

Xiv

upper portion of the tubing contains a sine-wave bend
to reduce the stresses due to thermal expansion. The

- heat exchanger design assumes use of tubing with a

knurled groove to enhance the heat transfer on both
inside and outside.
The removal of reactor afterheat has been analyzed in

. more detail. The normal method is to continue circu-

lation of both the primary and secondary salts and to
transfer the heat to the steam system. The fuel salt can
be drained to a tank provided with cooling thimbles,
and the residual heat due to deposited fission products
in the core can be removed by circulating nitrogen with
the fuel-salt pumps.

More detailed studies were completed on the tempera-
ture distributions within the reactor. It was found that
the maximum core graphite temperature would be
1307°F, occurring about 1 ft above midheight in the
reactor. The maximum temperature in the radial re-
flector graphite was found to be 1363°F. Vessel wall
temperatures were also analyzed and found to be within
acceptable limits.

The MSBR station cost estimates were revised to
more nearly reflect 1969 costs. Ata construction cost

of about $160.00 per kilowatt and a production cost of

4 mills/kwhr, the MSBR compares favorably with our
estimates of costs for water reactors.

Some conceptual design studies were begun for a
molten-salt breeder experiment. The objectives pro-
posed for the experiment can be accomplished with a
reactor with a power in the range of 100 to 200 Mw
(thermal). |

6. Reactor Physics

Recent optimization studies of molten-salt breeder
reactor configurations have been based on a figure of
merit which places greater weight on fuel specific power
than does the annual fuel yield. In addition, a limitation
on the maximum fast-neutron flux in the graphite may
now also be imposed as a constraint on the optimiza-
tion. , ‘

Since the previous progress report, we have found
that the core of the 1000 Mw (electrical) single-fluid
MSBR can be enlarged so as to extend the useful life of
the graphite from two to four years with only a slight
penalty in breeding performance. Additional modifi-
cations have been made to provide proper cooling of
the reflector and to limit the fast-neutron flux in the
reflector to a level that should not require replacement
of the reflector during the life of the reactor. Finally,
further detailing of the reactor design has resulted in
other upward revisions in the estimated salt inventory.
In all, the salt volume in our present MSBR configu-

Y

ration is about 20% greater than reported previously. In

Xv

the aggregate, these changes result in a reactor having a -

breeding ratio of 1.065, fissile material inventory of
1470 kg (including protactinium), annual fuel yield
3.34%, and a useful core life of four years at 0.8 plant
factor.

A new analysis of the effect of thorium concentration
on MSBR performance was carried out in terms of the
new figure of merit and with careful adjustment of
neutron cross sections to fit each case being considered.

We find that 12 mole % of thorium in the salt is very

nearly optimum in terms of breeding performance.
- Improved digital computer codes for preparation of

- the neutron cross sections required in multigroup flux

calculations and for carrying out multigroup two-
dimensional neutron diffusion calculations have been
put into use in the MSR program during the last several
months. They have greatly facilitated the explicit
two-dimensional calculations which are necessary to
check the 2-D synthesis calculations used in the ROD
optimization code and which are also employed in
analysis of tentative configurations for a molten-salt
breeder experiment.

Neutron transport codes have been adapted to calcu-
late also the transport of gamma rays whose sources
depend in part on the computed neutron fluxes. This
computational tool allows one to calculate gamma
heating in complex, multizoned reactor configurations

without recourse to approximate buildup factor

methods whose use is questionable in such configura-
tions. The codes were used to obtain heating distri-
butions in the MSBR.

Further analysis of possible conﬁguratlons for a
molten-salt breeder experiment shows that both the
target maximum damage flux of 5 X 10'* neutrons
cm™? sec™' (350 kev) and an- initial breeding ratio

(with 233U fuel) greater than unity. can be achieved

with a reactor power less than 200 Mw (thermal). If one
accepts a breeding ratio only slightly less than unity,

the target damage flux can be achieved with a reactor -

power of 100 Mw (thermal). S
The experiment to measure the spectrum-averaged

for both 235U.and 233U in the MSRE is progressing
well, and has reached the point where comparisons
between measured and calculated values can be made
for the 223U samples. Tentatively, the agreement seems

- excellent, the measured value of a, s being about 3.5%
lower than the calculated value based on the ENDF/B

cross-section ‘library. Though the experimental errors
have not been fully assessed, this difference is about the
same as the expected accuracy of the measurements.
This level of accuracy in the measurement of a

“values of a (the capture-to-fission cross-section ratio) -

contributes about 0.7% uncertainty in  for 235U, but

would correspond to about 0.4% uncertainty in n for
233U .

7. Systems and Components Development

Studies on the off-gas system were continued, and a
preliminary design concept for the volume holdup tank
is presented. This tank provides about 1 hr holdup for
all gases leaving the reactor and employs a circulating
coolant which receives the solid fission products from
an impaction separator and absorbs the energy from
these and the decay of the noble gases. The system
must reject a maximum of 18 Mw of decay heat.

The 3% Xe distribution calculations were extended to
include the other noble-gas fission products, of which
there are over 30 kryptons and xenons. The fluxes of
these isotopes to the circulating gas bubbles, to the
graphite, out of the reactor, and to the noble-gas
removal system were calculated for conditions of the
graphite coating and the noble-gas stripping system
which yielded a '35Xe poison fraction of 1.27 and
0.56%. The flux of the fission product gas to the
graphite for the latter case was used to calculate the
afterheat in the graphite after about two years of
continuous operation at full power. Heat is released at
the rate of 1 Mw 10 min after shutdown and has
decayed to less than 0.15 Mw 10 hr later. An estimate
was made of the distribution of about 21 Mw of decay
heat in the off-gas system, including about 9 Mw of
heat from the decay of noble metals.

Studies were started on a bubble generator that
resembles an inverted venturi and consists of a teardrop
inside a straight section of pipe. It was found that the
primary mechanism for generating small bubbles is the
use of the energy in the turbulent field in the diffuser.
Coalescence of the small bubbles was found to increase
as the void fraction in a water stream increased much
above 0.1%; however, it was indicated that higher fluid
velocities would inhibit coalescence, ‘and this will be

~ checked. A third set of vanes for the vortex type of
in-line bubble separator was made as a scaled-up version

of an earlier model used on another experiment and for
which there was satisfactory performance. This model
appears to confirm the earlier experience, but testing
was just begun at the end of the period.

A request for directive for a molten-salt steam
generator test stand was sent to the AEC for approval
and authorization of expenditures. The test stand will
have a capacity of 3 Mw and will consist of a
molten-salt pump loop with a gas-fired heat source and
a watersteam loop capable of operating at subcritical
and supercritical pressures. The test stand will be used

 

 
 

to gain fundamental engineering data and to investigate

ideas for generating steam with molten salt.

The sodium fluoroborate test.loop was operated
almost continuously from August 19, 1968, to
November 4, 1968. During this period work was
completed on pump cavitation tests, studies were
continued on methods of controlling salt composition
and on restrictions in the off-gas line, and initial tests
were made with a cold finger to investigate cold-zone
deposition of corrosion products. During November and
December a test section was installed in the off-gas line
at the pump bowl outlet to provide pressure and
temperature profile data and to permit installation of
various traps and filters, The loop was restarted on
December 19, 1968, and circulation has continued

without interruption through February 1969. Cumu-

lative circulating time is 4600 hr, of which 3600 hr have
been with the clean batch of salt. In general, the test
work has produced no evidence of any problem which
would preclude the use of NaBF4-NaF eutectic as a
reactor coolant.

Results of the cavitation tests with the clean charge of
salt appear consistent with the notion that cavitation
inception for the PK-P pump operating with sodium
fluoroborate can be correlated on the basis of net
positive suction head and vapor pressure. _

It was concluded that control of the fluoroborate salt

Xvi

visited pump manufacturers to determine. their interest
and capabilities in the salt pump program. A request for
proposal is being prepared for submittal to pump
manufacturers. A request for directive based on pre-
liminary design and cost estimates was prepared for the
MSBE salt pump test stand, and a draft of the system
design description was also prepared for it. Design work

~was initiated for a small pump for laboratory applica-

composition at the eutectic point will be easy, provided

a suitable method can be established for monitoring the
salt composition, Four monitoring methods have been
under consideration. Of these, the one with the most

promise uses the partial pressure of BF; over the salt, as -

indicated by the thermal conductivity of the off-gas
stream, to calculate the salt composition.

The cause of gas-system restrictions was traced to
accumulations of salt mist at the pump bowl off-gas
nozzle and in the control valve. The test data indicate
that the trouble .can be eliminated by the use of a
special hot trap at the pump bowl outlet and a
high-efficiency filter immediately downstream of the
hot trap.

The conceptual layout of a primary-salt pump for the
molten-salt breeder reactor has been further defined to
consider the problems incurred by system thermal
expansion, coupling the drive motor to the pump,
pump containment requirements, and shaft seal oil
leakage. The plan to obtain the participation of the
United States pump industry in the Molten-Salt Breeder
Experiment (MSBE) salt pump program is progressing.
The specification for the MSBR primary-salt pump was
revised in the light of project and pump manufacturer
comments, An evaluation team was selected, and they

tions. It will be designed for melten salt and liquid
metal at temperatures to 1400°F, flow capacities to 30
gpm, and head capability fo 300 ft.

We completed the fabrication and started the testing
of the automated cutting and welding equipment based
on the design developed by the Air Force and the North
American Rockwell Corporation. Initial tests of the
equipment were performed with a welding programmer
loaned to us by the Air Force, and these tests,
performed without benefit of operating experience or
equipment debugging, gave very encouraging results.
This is the first of tests to establish the feasibility of
remote welding for molten-salt reactors. A detailed
“Proposal for the Development of a Remote Control
System for Cutting and Welding Radioactive Pipe and

Vessels” was submitted to the Director, Division of

Reactor Development and Technology. The program
covers a five-year, $3,000,000 development program to
adapt the orbital equipment to fully remote operation
in high radiation fields. The equipment, once de-
veloped, would have application for maintenance of
most operating reactors.

8. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

The preliminary investigation of an overall plant
control system of the single-fluid 1000 Mw (electrical)
MSBR was completed. This investigation included, in
addition to the studies previously reported, simulations
of the reactor heat transfer, nuclear kinetics, and a
reactivity control system. The secondary-salt flow rate
was altered at a rate proportional to the error in steam
temperature, as suggested by previous studies, to
achieve closer control of steam temperature.

Several transient cases were run with this model,
including step and ramp changes in power demand and
reactivity and step loss of one secondary-salt coolant
loop. Normally anticipated ramp changes in load
demand resulted in less than 10°F temperature change
at the turbine throttle. Large load changes such as a
50% loss of load, however, resulted in throttle tempera-
ture variations of about 150°F. Control reactivity
requirements were less than 0.075% 6k/k for the above
cases with rates of about 0.003%/sec 8k/k. The results

-t

g

also indicate that for large load changes it may be
necessary to vary primary-salt flow as well as
secondary-salt flow to reduce the temperature varia-
tions on the reactor and heat exchanger.

The calculation of the decay of neutron density in the
MSBR following shutdown was extended to investigate
the effects of the loss of all primary-salt flow. The
curves included indicate the integral of reactor power
for the first 5 min after flow interruption for various
rates and amounts of negative reactivity insertion. The
effect of delaying control rod action is also shown.

The effect of the photoneutron reaction from beryl-
lium on neutron density following shutdown was
calculated and found to be negligible.

A dynamic analysis of a steam generator for the
MSBR was performed at ORNL. A more extensive
analysis is being carried on under subcontract with the
University of Illinois at the university’s hybrid compu-
tation facility. . '

Investigation of the stability of resistance ther-
mometers to gross shifts in calibration under conditions
of prolonged operation at high temperature with
occasional wide variations in temperature was con-
tinued. The testing of two sets of thermometers seemed
to indicate that cycling between room temperature and
1500°F, the maximum rated temperature, or extended
operation at 1500°F would stabilize the thermometers.

9. Heat Transfer and Thermophysical Properties

Heat Transfer. — Studies were continued with a
proposed MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF,,
67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %) using the pressurized flow
system and a small-diameter resistance-heated Hastelloy
N test section. In the recent experiments care was taken
to minimize errors due to nonuniform heat loss, faulty
thermocouple installation, and erratic readout, although
there remained a possibility that the flow may have

~been affected by a repair weld near one end of the test

section. Whereas wall temperature patterns in the
laminar flow regime were consistent with the expecta-
tion of fully developed flow beyond a rather well-
defined entrance region, the patterns in the high
transition and turbulent flow regimes continued to

 reveal irregularities indicative of a laminar-turbulent

transition extending to the outlet of the test section.
Variation in the heat flux by a factor of 10 produced
no significant change in the relative amplitude of the
irregularities in wall temperature. Comparison of ex-
perimentally determined Nusselt moduli near the exit
of the test section with those predicted by the accepted
correlations indicated a dependence on Reynolds
modulus which was greater than would be expected for

 

Xvii

fully developed turbulent flow. A system identical
geometrically (except for the weld repair) to that used
in the MSBR fuel salt experiments was operated with
the salt Hitec (KNO3;-NaNO; -NaNQ;, 44-49-7 mole %).
Not only were the wall temperature patterns indicative
of developed turbulent flow, but the Nusselt moduli
agreed well with accepted correlations. The next phase
in the experimental program will involve heat transfer
measurements with the MSBR fuel salt in the same
apparatus used for the experiments with Hitec.

Thermophysical Properties. — Preliminary thermal
conductivity measurements in both the solid and liquid
states have been made for a proposed MSBR fuel salt
(LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,, 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %), using
the variable-gap apparatus. The conductivity of the
solid decreased linearly from about 0.026 w cm™
(°C)™? at 290°C to about 0.014 w cm™ (°C)™? at the
melting point, 480°C. The ratio of liquid to solid
conductivity at the melting point was 0.84, in good
agreement with data for other salt mixtures. Over the
range of temperature from the melting point to 860°C,
the thermal conductivity of the proposed MSBR fuel
salt was found to lie between that of the MSRE fuel
and coolant salts, displaying a maximum of 0.0138 w
em™! (°C)7! at about 650°C.

Despite the added difficulties in making conductivity
measurements in the solid state and the associated
sources of error, the measured thermal resistance
displayed the same consistency as a function of gap
width as observed for liquid samples and indeed yielded
the same values for the fixed resistances associated, for
example, with gas or surface corrosion films. Thus
future experiments will include measurement of
thermal conductivity in both solid and liquid states.

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. — Design of the
facility for investigating mass transfer of oxygen (simu-
lating 3% Xe) from glycerol-water solutions (simulating
molten salt) to helium has been completed, and
construction is progressing. It has been decided to use
the variable-area nozzle method under development by
Kedl for bubble generation. Tests of a conical screen
bubble separator are encouraging. A semiempirical
dispersion criterion for bubbles in a turbulently flowing_
stream has been developed which relates bubble and
pipe sizes and liquid properties to the Reynolds
modulus. Application of this criterion to the mass
transfer experiment has delineated the range of
Reynolds and Schmidt moduli for which fully dispersed
bubble flow can be expected and has indicated that
vertical orientation of the test section will probably be
necessary to obtain meaningful data in the low
Reynolds modulus range.

PART 3. CHEMISTRY

10. Chemistry of the MSRE

A material balance for fuel and flush salts was
established from analytical chemical and physical
property data for the entire period of MSRE operations
with 235U fuel. The results, which were consistent with
on-site estimates, were used as base-line data for 233U
experiments. Generalized corrosion occurred rapidly at
the beginning of 233U operations because of the
presence of Fe* as a contaminant in the reconstituted
fuel salt, but the corrosion was checked completely by

adjustment of U**/ZU concentration during the early -

stages of these operations. Anomalous development of a
larger void fraction than had been observed previously
in the fuel salt was investigated by laboratory experi-
ments intended to simulate partially the conditions in
the MSRE fuel pump. Foam development, thought to
be a significant factor, was not observed. In other
experiments foam behavior in molten salts was studied
in glass apparatus with high-speed photography.

| 11. Fission Product Behavior

‘Additional results of postirradiation examination of
the third surveillance specimen assembly confirmed that
local variation in graphite porosity significantly affects
diffusion of activities through salt-graphite interfaces.

Programs were developed for calculation of fission
product inventories during 233U operation of the
MSRE. Discovery that the ?*Nb oxidation-reduction
equilibrium provides a sensitive measure of the redox
potential of the fuel salt identified its potential use as a
corrosion indicator in molten-salt reactors.

Operation of the MSRE off-gas sampler-analyzer
showed the presence of 1 to 3 g/day of hydrocarbons in
the stream. Mass spectrometric analysis of samples
taken during power operations with 235U and 233U
showed appropriate response of xenon and krypton
isotopic ratios to the fuel used.

Transport properties of fission products which “vola-

tilize” from the surface of radioactive salt mixtures
were studied in both hot-cell tests and via tracer experi-
ments using chemical traps and probes. The aerosol
particles produced were found to have average diam-
eters of 4 to 20 A.
" The chemistry of the noble metal fission product
fluorides was investigated in laboratory experiments.
The fluorides and oxyfluorides of niobium, molybde-
num, and ruthenium were prepared and characterized.
Their stabilities were determined using mass spectro-
metric methods. -

12. Physical Chemistry of Molten Salts

Th;: solubilities and heats of solution of CeF; in
LiF-BeF,-ThF, and LiF-ThF, mixtures were deter-
mined at 600 and 800°C. Solubility of CeF; was

" correlated with solvent composition and found to

depend on the sum of BeF, and ThF, concentrations.

Zone melting and cyclic slow-cooling experiments
were conducted with LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixtures
(72-16-12 and 57-33-10 mole % with 0.3 and 0.025
mole % CeF; added). Behavior was consistent with
published and recent phase studies of the solubility of
CeF; in the LiF-BeF,-ThF, system. Cyclic slow cooling
provided equal or better thorium separation than zone
melting, although appreciable separations were not
obtained for thorium or cerium in the LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) mixture.

Studies of the equilibrium phase behavior in the

- system NaF-KF-BF; were continued. Liquid-liquid

immiscibility in the systems LiF-KBF,, Li;BeF,4XI,
and Li;BeF,-KBF, was observed in accord with pre-
diction. Composition-temperature relationships of the
conjugate monotectic liquids were established. The
crystal structure of the low-temperature form of KBF,
was determined from three-dimensional x-ray diffrac-
tion data.

The solubility of thorium metal in molten LiF-ThF,
(73-27 mole %) at 620°C was established as 0.1 mole %.
Densities of molten MSR fuel and coolants were
measured at their typical operating temperatures with
heretofore unprecedented accuracy. The establishment
of a program for the investigation of visible-ultraviolet
absorption spectroscopy in molten fluorides was com-
pleted, including the development of the diamond-
windowed spectrophotometric cell which is unreactive
to fluorides and the production of fluoride solvents and
solutes of the purity required for spectroscopy.

The distribution of U*" between molten LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF4 and a (U,Th)O, solid solution was investi-
gated for possible application to molten-salt reactor fuel
reprocessing. The exchange process was found to be
rapid and reversible.

Efforts were continued to develop an Ni-NiO-BeO
electrode as a reference electrode in molten fluorides.
The results obtained were reproducible but were not in
agreement with cell potentials calculated from available
thermochemical data. Transference numbers were meas-
ured in molten mixtures of LiF and BeF,. It was found
that #; ;+ = 1.0 £ 0.05 in the range 0.3 <XBer, <0.5,
and possibly over the entire concentration range. The
mobility of the beryllium ions is zero within experi-
mental error. The suitability of molten potassium

As part of a continuing investigation of electrical
conductivities in the molten LiF-BeF, system, pre-
liminary results are reported for the temperature
dependence of pure molten beryllium fluoride over the
range 530—685°C.

13. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reactor Fuel
Reprocessing Technology

Development chemistry for molten-salt reactor fuel
reprocessing technology has been devoted to the reduc-
tive extraction concept whereby constituents of the
fuel are selectively extracted into molten bismuth
containing either lithium or thorium as the reducing
agent. The chemical feasibility of 233Pa isolation has
been demonstrated by a process which also requires the
prior reduction of uranium from the salt mixture and
its subsequent oxidation into the salt effluent of a
233p; extraction column. Recent studies have ex-
amined the effects of metal additives to bismuth, and
varied process applications to achieve improved rare-
earth separations.

14. Development and Evaluation of Analytical
Methods for Molten-Salt Reactors

The oxide content of the 233U fuel in the MSRE was
found to be 61 ppm, essentially identical to that of the

maintained for several hours and that the frozen salt
could be exposed to the atmosphere for periods
necessary for hot-cell transfers without significant loss
of U(III). .

The accuracy of the measurements was established in
separate experiments in which MSRE-type melts con-
taining U(IV)/U(III) in ratios from 7 to 140 were
measured voltammetrically and potentiometrically vs an
Ni/NiF reference. The melts were simultaneously sam-
pled for a spectrophotometric determination of U(III)
concentrations. Satisfactory agreement was obtained
between the voltammetric and spectrophotometric
determinations. Also, the potentiometric measurements
were in agreement with values calculated from reported
values of free energies. Potentiometric measurements vs
the Ni/NiF reference electrode are also reported for
Be(1I)/Be, Zi(IV)/Zr, and corrosion product couples in
LiF-BeF, -ZrF4 and for the Fe(1l)/Fe and Fe(1lI)/Fe(II)
couples in LiF-NaF-KF. A pronounced cathodic shift of

~ the Fe(IlI)/Fe(I) couple in LiF-NaFKF indicates a

strong complexing of Fe(Ill) by free fluoride in the
melts. -

It appears that the facility for the spectrophotometry
of radioactive molten fluoride salts can be completed as
scheduled. Delivery of the optical system has been
scheduled for August. Three of the major salt-handling
components, the optics furnace, its top assembly, and

. the transport container, have been fabricated and

235U fuel. The oxide apparatus is expected to require -

* major repairs shortly but will probably last through the

MSRE operations. Three approaches were studied as
possible methods for the determination of U(III) in the

~radioactive MSRE fuel. Of these the total reducing

power and hydrogen transpiration methods were found
to be impractical for the analysis of the 233U fuel at
this time. A voltammetric method in which the poten-
tial of a noble electrode poised by the U(IV)/U(IID)
couple is measured vs the position of the U(IV)->U(ILI)
voltammetric wave "offers the possibility of more
immediate measurements. The technique requires the
insertion of three platinum electrodes in the salt. An
apparatus has been designed that will permit the
insertion of electrodes in MSRE fuel that is remelted in
the original sampling ladle. Tests with simulated fuel
have demonstrated that U(IV)/U(III) ratios can be

subjected to preliminary testing and modification. The
sample loading furnace is almost completed. A hot cell
has been decontaminated, and the necessary in-cell
services are being designed. The successful sampling of
fluoride melts for the determination of U(III) by a
technique similar to the one to be used in the hot cell
confirmed the validity of the method designed for
radioactive samples. These experiments also demon-
strated the use of the absorption of U(IV) to determine
the path length of melts in windowless cells.

Absorption spectra in molten Li;BeF4 are sum-

‘marized for a variety of 3d transition-metal ions. All of

these spectra, which include a representative of each
configuration except 3d°, are consistent with ions
situated in high symmetry, either octahedral or dis-
torted octahedral. Cobalt(Il) maintains high symmetry
even in melts enriched in BeF,.

Observations of wetting and nonwetting behavior of
LiF-BeF, melts in various container ‘materials were
accumulated and analyzed. Conditions found necessary
for wetting to occur include an electrically conductive
container together with an active metal in contact with
a melt containing one or more soluble species of the
active metal. Sparingly soluble oxides did not cause
wetting.

 
 

Liquid contaminants in the He-BF; cover gas of the
circulating NaBF, loop have been tentatively identified
as hydrolysis products of BF3. An apparatus has been
assembled to study these materials and to develop
techniques for their removal from off-gas systems.

A variety of analytical techniques are being tested for
the determination of traces of bismuth in MSRP salts.
Presently, the detection limit for the iodide spectro-
photometric method is 10 ppm. Emission spectro-
graphic, polarographic stripping, and isotope exchange
methods are being investigated for determinations at
the 1-ppm level or lower.

PART 4. MOLTEN-SALT IRRADIATION
EXPERIMENTS

15. Molten-Salt Convection Loop in the ORR

Wetting studies indicated that very Stringent gas

_ purification measures will have to be used in future

small-scale experiments, such as the in-pile thermal
convection autoclave, if wetting by the salt and
concomitant confusion of the experimental results are
to be avoided. Titanium or uranium metal hot trapping
at the points of entry of gas streams into the loop are
indicated as minimum requirements.

PART 5. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

16. MSRE Surveillance Program

Several magnetic particles were removed from the
MSRE pump bowl with a permanent magnet. These
particles were mixtures of iron and nickel with trace
amounts of chromium and molybdenum and ranged
from 20 to <1 u in size.

17. Graphite Studies

Several new graphites were obtained for evaluation.
These materials have been characterized by the meas-
urement of several physical properties and have been
included in other phases of our program, The tech-
niques were developed for making several physical
property measurements on graphite, including thermal
conductivity, electrical resistivity, anisotropy by x-ray

~ diffraction, and structure studies by transmission elec-

tron microscopy. Several graphites have been irradiated
to a fluence of 2.5 X 1022 neutronsfcm? (>>50 kev) at

XX

715°C. Dimensional measurements indicate that (1) the .

maximum density and the associated fluence are in-
versely proportional to the original density, (2) the

crystallite growth rates at maximum density are de-
pendent only on the preferred orientation, and (3)
grades H337, H364, and AXF show an initial delay
before densifying and offer improved dimensional
stability. -

Our graphite sealing studies have concentrated on
optimizing the processing parameters for various
graphite substrates. Some sealed AXF samples were
irradiated to a maximum fluence of 1.3 X 10?2
neutrons/cm® (>50 kev). Although the permeabilities
increased, one sample had a helium permeability of at
least 1.7 X 10~7 cm?/sec. Other samples have been
sealed and are being irradiated.

18. Hastelloy N

Titanium and carbon additions improved the mechan-
ical properties of a base alloy of Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr.
Samples of Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr—0.05% C containing
various amounts of titanium were aged for various times
at 650 and 760°C. Mechanical property tests showed
that changes took place, but these changes were not
sufficient to account for the variations noted over this
temperature range during irradiation. Electron micros-
copy revealed that the good properties were associated
with a fine MC-type precipitate and that the poorer
properties were noted at higher temperatures, where a
coarse M,C-type carbide was formed. The MC-type
carbide can be stabilized with higher concentrations of
Ti, Hf, Nb, Zr, and Y, and postirradiation creep tests
show that good properties result.

Our corrosion studies continued to affirm the excel-
lent compatibility of Hastelloy N with the lithium-
beryllium-fluoride salts. A loop constructed of type
304L stainless steel has a higher, but acceptable,
corrosion rate and has operated for over six years

without difficulty. Our proposed coolant salt, sodium .
fluoroborate, is somewhat more aggressive, but our -

thermal convection loops indicate that acceptable cor-

rosion rates are attainable when the water content of -

the salt is low. We have operated a pumped loop of
Hastelloy N containing sodium fluoroborate for about
1500 hr. The salt composition has shown some erratic
changes in metallic impurities, but operation has pro-
ceeded without difficulty.

19. Support for Chemical Processing

Molybdenum and graphite seem compatible with fuel
salts and with bismuth and are potentially useful
construction materials for a chemical processing plant
for MSBR’s. The primary remaining problem is fabri-

cation, since both materials "are difficult to join.
Techniques have been developed for brazing both
materials, but these joining materials may not be
compatible with bismuth. We are also examining the
possibility of coating iron-base alloys with molybdenum
to prevent temperature-gradient mass transfer of the
iron by the bismuth.

20. Support for Components Development Pfogram

We have procured some of the equipment necessary
for making welds in Hastelloy N by processes that are
potentially useful for remote applications. Useful ex-
perience has also been gained through the use of some
automatic welding equipment that utilizes the MIG
welding process.

Several plasma-sprayed bearing surfaces on Hastelloy
N have received cursory evaluation. The coatings did
not spall during thermal cycling, but several small flaws
did develop.

PART 6. MOLTEN-SALT PROCESSING
AND PREPARATION

21. Flowsheet Analysis

The proposed process flowsheet for a 1000 Mw
(electrical) single-fluid MSBR includes a system for
233p, jsolation based on reductive extraction using
molten bismuth. The salt is processed at a rate
equivalent to 1 reactor volume in three days. Calcula-
tions using revised equilibrium distribution data show
the system to be theoretically practical. The flowsheet
also includes a system for rare-earth removal which
processes the contents of the reactor on a 30-day cycle.
Calculations indicate that a cascade of perhaps 24 stages
will be necessary to effect rare-earth removal with bis-
muth flow rates as high as 15 gpm. An important vari-

- able in this calculation was the fraction of thorium elec-
trolyzed from the salt- as it passed through the

electrolytic cell unit. A computer code has been
developed to perform steady-state material balance
calculations which describe the nuclear, chemical, and
physical processes occurring in the fuel of an MSBR.

22. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients
in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

Distribution of uranium, protactinium, plutonium,
thorium, rare earths, and other fission products be-
tween molten fluoride salts and liquid bismuth solu-

tions is being studied in support of a reductive
extraction process for single-fluid MSBR fuels. Equi-
librium data were obtained with a variety of LiF-BeF, -
ThF, salts at 600°C. These data show that uranium and
zirconium will coextract but that they should be easily
separated from protactinium. Plutonium can probably
be separated from protactinium if the reductant con-
centration in the metal phase is very low. Protactinium
should be easily separated from the rare earths and
thorium; the Pa-Th separation factors were 2000 to
4400 with the salt compositions used. The rare-earth—
thorium separation will be much more difficult; separa-
tion factors were in the range of 1.0 to 3.5. A metal
transfer process is being evaluated as an alternative to
reductive extraction for the rare-earth—thorium sepa-
ration.

The mutual solubilities of nickel and thorium in
bismuth were determined at 600°C. The results can be
expressed as a mole fraction solubility product Kyp =
6.2X 1077,

23. Engineering Development of
Process Operations

Electrolytic cells will be required for operation of
reductive extraction systems in an MSBR fuel process-
ing plant. The cells will be used to oxidize materials in
bismuth streams effluent from extraction contactors as
well as for reducing lithium and thorium into bismuth
streams which are fed to the contactors. Experiments
have been carried out in quartz cells (4 in. OD) which
used bismuth pools as the electrodes and 66-34 mole %
LiF-BeF, as the electrolyte. Current densities up to 4.5
amp/cm® were observed. The current was linearly
dependent on applied voltage, which suggests that there
is essentially no limiting current in the range covered by
the experiments. Corrosive conditions will exist in the
vicinity of anodic surfaces, and it is planned that such
surfaces be protected by a frozen salt layer. A small
all-metal static cell has been installed for study of this
method of operation. - '

Equipment. has been installed for semicontinuous
engineering experiments on reductive extraction. The
equipment allows purification and countercurrent con-
tact of up to 15 liters each of molten salt and bismuth
containing thorium through a 0.82-in.-ID, 2-ftlong

- column packed with Y -in. right circular cylinders.

Preliminary testing and degassing of the equipment has
begun, and charging of bismuth and molten salt
(72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,;) will have been
completed soon.

The hydrodynamic properties of contactors are being
studied in simulated systems using water and mercury.

 
 

Quantitative measurements have been made of flooding
rates, pressure drop, and dispersed phase (Hg) holdup.
Information was also obtained on flow patterns and
drop sizes. Four packing materials and one baffled
cartridge have been studied in a 1-in.-ID column. A
mathematical model describing the hydrodynamic
aspects of a dispersed-flow column was developed.

A system is being built to allow the steady-state
testing of a variety of electrolytic cell designs. Provision
is made for circulating up to 0.5 gpm of bismuth and
0.25 gpm of salt through the cell containment vessel,
for sampling the inlet and outlet streams from the cell,
and for visually observing operation of the cell.

24. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

An experimental molten-salt still is being installed at
the MSRE for demonstrating low-pressure, high-
temperature distillation of 48 liters of irradiated MSRE
fuel carrier salt. Minor equipment modifications sug-
gested by nonradioactive tests were made. A condensate
sampler similar to equipment used for addition of 233U
to the fuel drain tanks was built. ’

The still was tested by transferring 16 liters of
nonradioactive salt into the system and distilling about
2 liters of this salt. : | '

P N Haubenrelch

- Loading of 23?U into the MSRE commenced a few

days after the beginning of the six-month period’

reported here. Part 1 of this report describes the critical

- experiment, the zero-power determinations of nuclear

characteristics, and, finally, operation at full power of
the world’s first 233U-fueled reactor. Results are
reported which show the adequacy of the nuclear data
and the procedures used to predict the characteristics of
the system with 233U. An experiment to measure
accurately the capture-to-fission ratio of 233U in a

‘molten-salt reactor neutron spectrum was in progress at

the end of the report period. Results of dynamics tests
showed the expected response and proved the system to

 be quite stable and easy to control, despite the very low

delayed neutron fractlon of 223U. Beginning early in
the 223U operation, the amount of gas entrained in the
pump and circulating with the fuel was higher than ever
before. Fuel chemistry in the aftermath of processing
and its possible relation to the gas entrainment are
discussed in Part 3 of this report. One effect of the
higher gas content (up to 0.7 vol %) was sporadic small
perturbations in salt level and nuclear power. Analysis
of the perturbations, described in Part 1, shows that
their effects are too small to affect the operation or the
life of the reactor, and the cause is probably related to-
the specific situation in the MSRE which permits gas to
cling in the core. Development work directly related to
the MSRE is also described in Part 1.

At the'end of August 1968, the fuel salt had just been
fluorinated to remove the 33%-enriched ?*°U that had
fueled the reactor since the nuclear startup in June

1965, and reduction of the corrosion product fluorides

“filter and returned to the reactor drain tahks on

September 8. Samples showed acceptably low concen-

- trations of corrosion products thus clearing the way for
~use of the carrier salt for the operation with 2>*U. The
- principal reactor-associated activities for this report

period are shown graphically in Fig. 1.1.
The amount of uranium (91% 233U) which had to be

‘added to attain criticality at the reference condition

(1200°F, rods fully withdrawn, no circulation) was
predicted to be 33.9 kg. Equipment had been attached

“to drain tank 2 to permit addition of ‘batches of
- enriching salt containing up to 7 kg of uranium. Three

batches totaling 21 kg of uranium were added before
the salt was pushed up into the fuel loop to determine

~ “the neutron multiplication, This was repeated after the

addition of one more 7kg batch. The final addition
through the drain tanks wa$ 5 kg of uranium, bringing

© the total added to 32.9 kg. When the core was filled

 
 

 

after this addition, extrapolation of the subcritical
multiplication indicated that only 0.35 kg more

uranium was required. A capsule of enriching salt-

containing 96 g of uranium was added through the
sampler-enricher to check out its operation and to
refine the extrapolation to the critical loading. Then the
salt was drained and secured in drain tank 1.

As long as uranium was being loaded into the drain
tank, the drain-tank cell could not be sealed. Therefore,
before the.reactor’ was taken critical, the loading
equipment was removed from FD-2, the cell was sealed,
and the containment was leak-tested at 20 psig. The
critical experiment was then resumed, with uranium
being added, 96 g at a time, through the sampler-
enricher directly into the circulating fuel .salt. On
October 2 criticality was attained after the addition of
'33.29 kg of uranium, slightly less than had been
predicted originally. Capsule additions continued for
the next 38 days, by which time a total of 27 capsules
had been added and one control rod had been almost

fully inserted. Initial criticality had been attained after
4 capsules. After 6 capsules the reactor was critical with
the fuel circulating. On October 8, after the addition of
the tenth capsule, the reactor power was raised to 100
kw to observe the dynamics. This was the first time that
a 233U-fueled reactor had ever operated at significant
power, and the occasion was marked by a ceremony
including AEC Chairman Glenn Seaborg and Commis-
sioner Wilfred - Johnson, among others. Chairman
Seaborg, who headed the team that had discovered
233y, was at the controls when the power was raised.

| At his side was R. W. Stoughton, of the ORNL

Chemistry Division, who with Seaborg and J. W.

Gofman first identified 222U on February 2, 1942.
After each of the capsule additions subsequent to

initial criticality, the critical control rod position and

the rod sensitivity were measured with and without the

fuel circulating. Two sets of rod-drop tests were done to-
obtain total rod worth. After the last addition the
critical rod position was determined at temperatures

cuculatmg

The fuel was circulated for two months during the
course of the uranium additions and reactivity meas-
urements. (There was a one-day interruption when the
fuel drained following an instrument power failure.)
Throughout this period there was abundant evidence of
an unusual amount of gas entrainment in the circulating

- fuel — about 0.5—-0.7 vol % compared with <0.1 vol %

during the years of operation with 235U, This was
manifested most clearly as a change in pump-bow] level
after start or stop of fuel circulation, but also showed
up in the effects of pressure and fuel circulation on
reactivity. A dependence of the core bubble fraction on
fuel temperature showed up as a difference in the
temperature coefficients of reactivity measured with
the fuel circulating and with it stationary and practi-
cally free of gas.

Examination of records of pump-bowl level showed
that the increased amount of gas in the fuel loop had
started rather suddenly on September 15, after about
16 hr of fuel circulation. Comparison of pressures on
the two bubblers in the pump bowl showed that the
density of the fluid several inches below the surface
decreased by about 20% at the same time. Subsequently

the transfer of salt into the overflow tank was abnor--

mally high. These changes occurred 2 hr after the start
of a 12-hr exposure of a beryllium rod in the pump
bowl. (The 21 kg of uranium that had been added to
this point was practically all in the U* state, and the
beryllium was intended to reduce some to U** so as to
provide a reducing environment to forestall corrosion.)
The correlation of the gas changes with the exposure of
beryllium metal was confirmed on October 13, when
another beryllium rod was immersed in the pump bowl

for 10 hr. During this interval the pump-bowl level and

the reactivity showed the circulating bubble fraction
changing erratically between 0.3 and 0.6 vol %. The gas
fraction remained high after the beryllium was re-
moved, and the rate of transfer to the overflow tank
was as high as 29 1b/hr. (It had gotten down to about 4
Ib/hr before this second beryllium addition.) Also,
during the following day, pressure drops began to show
a restriction in the fuel off-gas line near the pump bowl.

In order to investigate these phenomena, reactor opera-

tion was continued, at very low power (about 50 w),

for almost three weeks after the last uranium addition.
The nickel cages in which the beryllium rods were

suspended in the fuel salt had come out with deposits
of magnetic material that proved to be mixtures of iron,
chromium, and nickel. This was taken to mean that the
corrosion product fluorides had not been completely

reduced in the chemical processing and that some had
been reduced by the beryllium, Magnets lowered into
the pump bowl brought out samples of the magnetic
powder, suggesting that the reduced metals tended to
float in the pump bowl. Because it appeared that the
reduction achieved by the first two beryllium rods was
mainly of iron and chromium, a third rod was exposed
on November 15 to reduce some U** to U**. Again
there were effects on the gas in the pump bowl and in
the loop. A week later an experimental assembly of
alternate short sections of beryllium rod and permanent
magnets was exposed in a nickel cage. Examinations
through the sampler-enricher periscope after 5 min, 1
hr, and 6 hr showed only small amounts of metal
powder on the assembly.

A shutdown had been scheduled before the beginning
of sustained power operation, and on November 28 the
fuel and coolant salts were drained. The original
purpose was to mix the fuel salt in the loop and in the
drain tank, which by now had different uranium
concentrations as a result of the capsule additions. But
the pressure drop across restriction in the off-gas line at
the fuel-pump bowl had gradually increased to about 4
psi, so the reactor cell was opened, and the line was
rodded out with a flexible tool designed to retrieve
some of the plugging material. The deposit appeared to
be mostly frozen salt mist. The coolant was drained,
because for some months there had been indications of
partial obstructions in the off-gas line from this system,
presumably from oil residues, and heaters and an oil
trap had been designed to be installed near the coolant
pump. Cleanout of the coolant off-gas line revealed
deposits ranging from tarry near the pump to light oil
farther away. ‘

On December 12 fuel circulation started for run 16.
The intended approach to full power was delayed,
however, because the analog input system for the
on-line computer, which was needed for the dynamics
tests, was not operating properly. After five days of
operation at 10 kw while the computer problems were
being worked on, the fuel sampler drive became
inoperative. In order to gain access to the drive unit, it
was necessary to drain the fuel and remove the shleld
blocks over the reactor. -~

A temporary containment enclosure and shielding
were set up, and the drive was lifted part way out of the
sampler shield so repairs could be made. These con-
sisted in cutting into the drive box and welding a loose
gear to its shaft and then patchmg the containment
box. '

Before the reactor was started up again, control rod
drive No. 3 was inspected and worked on. Although the

 
 

drop time for this rod was still acceptable, it had crept
up gradually over the previous several months. Analysis
of acceleration and examination of the drive and the
rod itself showed only a general increase in stiffness or
drag. A small weight added to the drive produced quite
satisfactory performance.

Maintenance was completed and nuclear operation
was resumed on January 12. The first day was spent at
very low power, confirming the earlier temperature
coefficient measurement. Then the power was raised to
1 Mw, where it was held for dynamics tests, observation
of nuclear heating, and fuel sampling. On January 17
the power was stepped up to 5 Mw. ,

With the beginning of 5-Mw . operation, a new

- phenomenon was noted. This was the occurrence of
small perturbations, at a frequency of 10 to 20 per

hour, that affected the nuclear power, the fuel-pump
level and pressure, and temperatures in the reactor
outlet. The perturbations, or “blips,” were too small to
be of immediate consequence, but intensive efforts
were started to determine the mechanism (see Sect.
1.34).

Analysis of the behavior of the several signals during
typical blips indicated that the reactivity perturbations
(about 0.01 to 0.02% &k/k) were most probably caused
by a temporary reduction in the amount of gas held up
in the reactor core. Furthermore, examination of

-recorded data showed that a peculiar behavior of the

salt level in the annulus of the reactor access nozzle
which accompanied the reactivity perturbation had
begun on September 15, when the gas fraction in the
circulating salt had increased. Operation at 1, 3, and 5
Mw with sensitive instrumentation showed that the
frequency with which the disturbances occurred and
the amount of reactivity associated with them were
independent of power. Further evidence that the blips
were related to gas in the core came when a beryllium
rod was exposed to the salt on January 24. For several
hours while the beryllium was in, the gas fraction in the
loop was about half what it had been and there were no
blips. The gas and the blips came back after the
beryllium was removed.

After the conclusion that the blips were not evidence |

of some potentially damaging situation, the reactor was
taken to full power of 8 Mw on January 28. Tests at
this level showed, as they had at lower powers, that the
dynamic response of the reactor system was quite close
to predictions. The small delayed neutron fraction of
233 was more than offset by the longer neutron
lifetime and larger negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity with the more dilute fuel, making the system
more strongly damped and giving a larger stability
margin than in the #35U operation.

After a total of nine days at full power, the power
was reduced to 5 Mw to permit operation at lower fuel
temperature without getting the coolant radiator below
1000°F. Variation of fuel temperature, pressure, and
salt level showed slight effects on gas in the loop. The
effect of these variables on blips seemed to be over-
shadowed by a gradual decline in frequency and size.

Gas in the fuel loop is a result of injection of bubbles

- into the salt in the pump bowl by the jets from the

xenon stripper. It appeared therefore that the amount
of gas could be drastically reduced by slowing down the
pump to cut the velocity of the jets and the flow of salt
into the pump suction. While a variable-frequency
power supply for the fuel pump was being set up and
checked out, a thermal convection experiment was run
on February 12. The fuel pump was turned off, the
reactor was taken critical, and the heat load was
gradually increased by raising the radiator doors. The
reactor was operated at various powers up to 350 kw
and thermal convection circulation rates up to about 30
gpm, for a total of 6 hr. The nuclear power followed
the heat load without control rod adjustment, and there
were no blips. (The blip frequency with forced circu-
lation and entrained gas just before the experiment had
been around five per hour.)

After the thermal convection experiment, normal
high-power operation was resumed and continued until
the variable-frequency pump power supply could be put
into service. This was ready on February 27. Starting at
half speed, the pump was brought up in steps to full
speed while the reactor was held at 10 kw to observe
the noise in the nuclear power. At half speed, the salt
level, the reactivity, and the neutron noise showed
practically no bubbles in the loop. A rather sharp
threshold occurred between 90 and 95% of full flow,
where all indications showed bubbles appearing in the
fuel loop. The power supply was dropped back to 50
cps (83% of full flow), and the power was raised to 7
Mw. For the next five days, operation continued at
these conditions. The neutron noise (the small, random
fluctuations in power) was far less than had been
observed in 233U operation, and there were no blips.
The pump speed was then returned to normal, the
bubbles and noise came back, and blips began to occur
again. A discussion of this and other evidence on the
blips is given in Sect. 1.3.4.

At the end of February the reactor had been
operating continuously for 47 days. A restriction had
built up again in the fuel off-gas line at the pump bowl,
becoming detectable on January 17 and gradually
increasing until February 27, when it blew out with an
8-psi AP across it. Partial restrictions, believed to be
organics, appeared in the coolant off-gas line and at the

entrance to the main charcoal bed and were relieved by

application of heat. Otherwise there was nothmg
threatening a shutdown.

Operating statistics at the end of February are given
in Table 1.1.

1.2 233U ZERO-POWER TESTS
J.R. Engel

The program of zero-power tests with 233U was very
similar to that followed during the initial experiments
with the 23°U fuel. The purpose was to first establish
the critical fuel loading under the simplest attainable
conditions and then measure the control rod worth and
the temperature and fuel-concentration coefficients of

reactivity. We originally planned to measure the loss of
delayed neutrons due to circulation of the precursors,
but the high circulating void fraction and the attendant
“noise” that it produced in the neutron flux prevented
a direct evaluation. However, indirect confirmation of
the validity of the calculated value was obtained from
rod-drop measurements. The results of the various
measurements, which are described below, are sum-

‘marized in Table 1.2.

to predict the critical loading. This comparison was
complicated and rendered more uncertain because the
fuel carrier salt had been used for the 235U operation
and contained many of the products formed during the
first 72,000 Mwhr of reactor operation. The processing
to recover the 225U removed the uranium and those
fission products that form wvolatile fluorides, but
practically all the plutonium and the rare-earth fission
products remained in the salt. In addition a heel of fuel
salt was unavoidably left in the drain tanks when the
main charge was transferred to the fuel storage tank to
be processed for uranium recovery. All of these factors
contribute to the uncertainty in predicting the critical
loading. :

The original theoretical calculations to predict the
233 critical loading were performed in the summer of
19672 A major application of the results was the
specification of the amount of 233U feed material that
had to be prepared® for the actual experiment.
Although we were aware of many of the factors listed
above, the reactor was still operating with 235U, so we
could only estimate their effects on the critical loading.
These calculations led to a predicted critical concen-
tration of 15.82 gfliter (uranium of the isotopic
composition of the feed material). While this result
provided an adequate basis for specifying material
requirements, it could not be regarded as a “best
effort” at predicting the critical concentration for the
conditions that actually prevailed at the time of the
experiment.

Some of the factors that affected the critical uranium
concentration were not fully evaluated until after the
critical experiment had been completed. When these
data became available, we attempted to evaluate the
corrections to the original calculations that we knew
were required to make the conditions for the compu-
tational model conform to the actual conditions at the
time of the experiment. The most important of the
necessary changes and updating were as follows:

1. In the original calculations, we had assumed that the
operation with 235U would be terminated at
approximately 60,000 Mwhr exposure. At the time
of shutdown from MSRE run 14, the actual ex-
posure was 72,440 Mwhr,

7Li-233UF4 for Refueling the Molten Salt Reactor, ORNL-
4371 (March 1969).

2. In connection with item 1, the residues of plu-
tonium and samarium remaining in the fuel salt had
to be reevaluated.

3. For the earlier calculations the concentrations of the
most important neutron-poisoning impurities, ® Li in
the salt and !°B in the graphite, were assumed equal
to the concentrations at the start of operation with
2351. Hence corrections had to be introduced for
the burnout of these nuclides.

4. The calculations had been based on the assumption
that no residue, or heel, of uranium would remain in
the reactor system after the transfer and processing
of the fuel salt. From isotopic dilution measure-
ments made in the course of the uranium additions,
we concluded that 1.935 kg of uranium (isotopic
assay: 32.97% 235U, 66.23% 232U) from the first’
loading had been left in the drain tanks. This became
a part of the fuel salt when the uranium-free salt was
returned from the storage tank for the start of the
233 operation.

5. A special addition of 0.89 kg of depleted uranium
was made in order to obtain the isotopic abundances
necessary for the planned experiment to measure the
capture-to-absorption cross-section ratio in 233U,
This addition had not been considered in the earlier
calculations,

6. Certain changes had been made in the evaluated
library of cross-section data for the fissile isotopes
since the earlier calculations were performed.

The above modifications were introduced into the
theoretical model, and the associated changes in the
multiplication constant, as well as the changes in
uranium required to compensate for the multiplication
changes, were evaluated. The results are summarized in
Table 1.3. It is apparent that the largest single correc-

- tion is that associated with the uranium heel, but all the

corrections are significant. Application of these correc-
tions to the originally predicted value led to a revised
prediction of 15.30 gfliter. (Note that this value is
applicable to stagnant salt at 1200°F with all three
control rods withdrawn to. their upper limits.) The
observed loading was 15.15 gfliter, a discrepancy of
only 1% in concentration or 0.4% in K¢y

In addition to the effects listed in Table 1.3, there are
two other reactivity effects that were not explicitly
included in either the original calculation or the revised
prediction. One of these is the negative reactivity
contribution of the low-cross-section fission products
remaining from the first fuel loading. The magnitude of
this reactivity effect depends on the extent to which
various fission products left the salt during the 235U

operation and also on any separation which may have
occurred during fluorination to remove the uranium.
The effect could be as large as —0.5% 8k/k if all these
fission products remained in the salt. Since it is
impossible to estimate the degree of retention realis-

tically with currently available information, we did not

include any poisoning for this class of fission products.

The second reactivity effect is that associated with
the distortion of the moderator graphite due to neutron
irradiation. Results of a detailed analysis of this
phenomenon in the MSRE indicate that the reactivity
effect at the time of the 233U loading was probably
between —0.04 and +0.07% &k/k. The spread in
probable values results from variations in the observed
distortion of individual specimens of grade CGB
graphite (the material in the MSRE core) as a function
of neutron exposure. Although the variations are small
compared with the total dimensional change which
occurs at high exposures, they represent a substantial
fraction of the change associated with the neutron
exposures experienced in the MSRE. Since the reac-

tivity effect of this distortion is very small, it was

neglected in the evaluation of the critical experiment.

122 Control Rod Calibration
J. R. Engel

- After the achievement of criticality, more uranium

was added to the fuel loop to build up the excess
reactivity required for routine power operation of the
reactor. Measurements were made after the addition of

“each capsule of fuel to provide data on the reactivity
worth of the control rods. We planned to add enough
excess reactivity to the loop to permit calibration of
one control rod over its entire range of travel. The
scheduled loop drain at the end of the calibration (to
homogenize the entire fuel charge) would then produce

. a fissile concentration with the desired reactivity worth

— just sufficient for the proposed 233U burnup
experiment. The unscheduled drain after the addition
of the 18th enriching capsule produced some enhance-
ment of the uranium concentration in the drain tank
prior to the scheduled event. Consequently, the cali-
bration was stopped before the control rod was fully
inserted in order to limit the final concentration to the
prescribed value. , -

The differential worth of one control rod was

- “measured as a function of its position and the positions

of the other two rods using the classic rod-bump—
period technique. These measurements were made both
with the fuel salt stagnant and with the normal

'~ circulation rate. In addition, two series of rod-drop

experiments were performed during the uranium load-
ing to obtain integral-worth values. Each series con-
sisted in dropping the rods singly, in pairs, and as a
group, also with the salt stagnant and circulating.

In contrast to the original measurements with the
235U fuel, the differential worth measurements pro-
duced relatively scattered results. A potentially strong
contributor to this scatter is the increasing uncertainty
in the exact control rod position as a result of wear in
the drive mechanism (a problem similar to that en-

 
 

 

countered in the dynamics tests). Since the rod travel
required to establish a given stable reactor period was
much smaller with 233U than with 235U, this uncer-
tainty has a greater effect on the results. Another
potential source of scatter is minor variations in the
core void fraction during individual period runs. In
several cases abrupt changes in the “stable” period were
observed, but the cause could not be identified. As a
consequence of the general scatter in the period
measurements, the rod-drop measurements were relied
upon for most of the calibration data. A detailed
discussion of the evaluation of the control rod calibra-
tion is presented in Sect. 4 of this report. The final
results are included in Table 1.2.

1.2.3 Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity
C. H. Gabbard

A temperature coefficient of reactivity was measured

three times with 233U fuel, each time by slowly
changing the temperature of the entire system and
observing the control rod position required for criti-
cality at several points from 1175 to 1225°F. There was
considerable variation among the values found in these
experiments, and they were generally smaller than the
theoretical value. These differences can be attributed to
the presence of gas in the core, whose steady-state
volume depends on temperature and circulation rate.
The first measurements were made in November, near
the end of the initial low-power run. The fuel pump was
operated to circulate the salt while the salt and graphite
temperatures were being changed and leveled off. Then
the pump was turned off to allow gas bubbles that were
circulating with the salt to agglomerate and float up out
of the core. Data on critical rod position and tempera-
tures were logged on the computer and manually, both
with the pump running and after it had been off for 15
min, at each of nine temperatures. Temperature coeffi-
cients were computed by plotting rod effects vs
temperature. The points with the pump off fell very
close to a straight line with a slope of —7.75 X 107°

(5k/k)/°F. The points with the fuel circulating were -

more scattered but gave a distinctly different slope:
—6.9 X 1075 (8k/k)/°F. The difference was not
unexpected, since we knew there was an appreciable
amount of entrained cover gas circulating with the salt,
and past experience had shown the circulating void
fraction increasing with decreasing temperature.* Thus

 

“MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 5.

- the fluid density change due to the dependence of gas

entrainment on temperature would tend to offset the
salt density change with temperature, reducing the

~magnitude of the reactivity effect of slowly varying

temperature. But even the value with the pump off was
significantly less than that predicted on the basis of no
gas in the salt. Therefore the series of measurements
was repeated with great care in January, immediately
after the start of run 17. The results with the pump off
were practically the same as before, but with circulation
the measured value was —7.4 X 107° (§k/k)/°F. The
inference was that the variation of the void effect
(bubble fraction) with temperature had changed.

After the variable-frequency power supply was put in
service and the loop bubble fraction was observed to be
very low at reduced fuel circulation rates, the tempera-

" ture-coefficient measurement was repeated. With the

pump running at reduced speed and practically no
bubbles circulating with the salt, the data gave a value
of —8.5 X 1075 (8k/k)/°F. This higher value suggests
that the effects of gas had not been completely
eliminated in the earlier experiment by simply stopping
the pump. That is, a varying amount of gas remained in
the core long after the pump was tumed off. Direct
evidence of gas remaining in the core was an observed
effect of pressure on reactivity after 12% hr of

~ natural-convection circulation and an observation made
~ when the fuel pump was first started at reduced speed.

Prior to the latter observation the fuel had been
circulating at the normal rate with a void fraction of
about 0.5 vol %. The pump was stopped for 1.5 hr
while the power supply was changed. Although the salt
level showed that most of the bubbles floated out of

the loop while the pump was off, when it was restarted

at half speed there was a level decrease, indicating
further densification of the loop fluid.

The predicted value of isothermal temperature
coefficient of reactivity was —8.8 X 10~ (8k/k)/°F at
operating fuel concentration (—9.4 X 10~ at critical
concentration). The only directly comparable observed
value is the one measured with no circulating gas, and it

is only 3.4% smaller. This value, —8.5 X 107°~

(8%/k)/°F, is used in the reactivity balance to compute
effects of overall temperature shifts when the reactor is
being operated with a very low void fraction. When the
pump is operated at full speed, with a void fraction
around 0.5 vol %, the reactivity balance uses —7.4 X
1075 (5k/K)/°F

The individual contributions of the fuel and the
graphite to the overall temperature coefficient were not
measured experimentally, but separate values are
needed in analyses of rapid transients. In view of the

close agreement between the overall coefficient ob-
served with no gas and the predicted isothermal
coefficient, the predicted graphite temperature coeffi-
cient, 3.2 X 107% (8k/k)/°F, is presumed to be accurate
enough. For rapid changes in temperature, where the
number of moles of gas circulating with the salt has no
time to change, the calculated effect of the gas on the
fuel temperature coefficient is very slight, about —0.05
X 107° (8k/k)/°F change for 0.5 vol % gas.’ Therefore
the fuel coefficient for dynarmc analyses is taken to be
—(8.5 —3.2) X 1075 (6k/K)/°F.

1.2.4 Concentration Coefficient of Reactivity
J.R. Engel

Data were collected on the variation of the critical
control rod configuration with uranium concentration
throughout the addition of excess uranium for the
control rod calibration. These data were reduced, with
the aid of the final rod calibration, to a concentration
coefficient of reactivity for uranium of the isotopic
composition of the enriching material (91% 222U). The
value observed near the initial critical concentration was
0.369 (6k/K)/(6C/C).

1.3 OPERATIONS ANALYSIS
Startup of the MSRE with 233U fuel did not require

modification of the equipment and operating pro-

cedures that had been used throughout the years of
operation with 233U, Because of the different nuclear
characteristics and critical loading of the new fissile
material, however, the dynamic characteristics of the
reactor system were expected to be different. Con-
siderable effort was devoted, therefore, to testing and
analyzing this aspect of the operation. There was also
keen interest in the radiation heating and reactivity
behavior, since the fission product yields and neutron
fluxes were changed. In addition, there were the
possible aftereffects of the salt processing to be
watched for. It turned out that there were in fact some
changes, notably the behavior of gas in the fuel system.
Analyses of these subjects are described in this section.

1.3.1 System Dynamics
| R. C. Steffy

One of the most obvious differences between opera-
tion with 233U and with 235U is the smaller fraction of
delayed neutrons with the 233U, In fact, when the fuel
is circulating, the effective fraction is only 0.0019,

about a third of what it had been with 235U and the

smallest of any reactor. But the transient response and
the stability of the system are affected by many other
parameters as well, and the lighter fuel loading with
233U produced a larger temperature coefficient of
reactivity and a longer neutron lifetime. The combined
effect of the changes was calculated, and the system
'was predicted to be stable and not difficult to control.®
During the very-low-power operation with 233U,
dynamics tests designed to determine the neutron level
to reactivity transfer function were performed both
‘with ‘the fuel circulating and stationary. Then during
the approach to full power, tests were performed at 1,
5, and 8 Mw. The results of these tests showed that the
dynamic behavior of the 233U-fueled MSRE was in
good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Tests were performed using pulse, step, pseu-
dorandom binary, and pseudorandom ternary test
patterns. However, the small signal strength inherent in
the aperiodic signals (pulse and step) was masked by the
high level of neutron noise induced by the circulating
bubbles (see Sect. 1.3.3) and made results of these tests
unusable. Analysis of the data from the pseudorandom
ternary tests was not completed by the end of this
report period, but the pseudorandom binary tests gave
good results.

The initial testing technique which we employed to
implement the pseudorandom test patterns was the
flux-demand technique, 2 method whereby the flux is
forced to follow the test pattern, as opposed to the
conventional method of forcing the control rod to
follow the test pattern. Although this technique
appeared to offer some advantages,” it did not work
very well because of an equipment limitation. The
natural fluctuations of the flux signal caused the servo
to have to move the control rod continually in trying to
force the flux to follow a particular test pattern. During
this rapid movement the gear-driven indicators were not
capable of reporting the exact position of the end of
the chain-driven flexible hose on which the poison
elements are strung. This loose coupling between
indicated and actual control rod position introduced a

- significant amount of error in the calculation of the

input reactivity. An example of results obtained from
one of these tests is shown in Fig. 1.2. The scatter in
the data is obviously excessive, although it falls around
the theoretical predictions. -

To circumvent this error from the control rod

‘indicators, it was necessary to revert to a form of the

more conventional method of direct control rod
manipulation. In order to get repeatable rod position-
ing, which is necessary for a pseudorandom binary or
ternary test, the flux signal going to the control rod
servo system was disconnected, and a voltage propor-
tional to the rod position was inserted. The normal
demand part of the servo circuit was also disconnected
and fed with a voltage equivalent in magnitude but
opposite in sign to the steady-state rod signal. Super-
imposed on the steady-state demand signal was a

- voltage which followed the desired test pattern. This

improved the quality of the indicated control rod
position for two reasons. First, the rod was typically
moved about 0.3 in. and then was not disturbed again
until the next pulse was due (pulse width varied
between 3 and 5 sec, depending upon the particular
test). This eliminated both the small jerks and the
continuous rod movement. Second, for a pseudoran-
dom binary test, 2 withdrawal was always followed by
an equal-in-magnitude insert and vice versa. This tended
to eliminate the accumulation of uncorrectable errors
which occcur when the inserts and withdraws are
random with respect to each other. When an insert
always follows a withdraw and a withdraw always

10

| aw sy

follows an insert, the indicated rod position still may
not be the same as the actual rod position, but the
discrepancy is a constant, and the error thus induced in
the final results may be corrected by applying a
constant scale factor.

Results of tests performed at 8 Mw using this
“rod-demand” technique are shown in Fig. 1.3. The
experimentally determined magnitude ratio,

K8N/No)/(6k/ko)l, has been normalized to agree with

the theoretical curves at 0.45 radian/sec. Scatter in the
results is obviously much less than was present in the
flux-demand tests. |

The dip in the theoretical prediction of the magnitude
ratio at ~0.25 radian/sec is an effect of the loop
circulation, which has a transit time of about 25 sec.
The dip shows up in the experimental results, but it is
not as pronounced as predicted. This implies that the
theoretical model does not allow for enough mixing of
the salt in the external loop. Work was started on
improving the model so as to give 2 better approxi-
mation to the physical conditions. This should also
improve the relation between the experimental and the
theoretical phase angle at the higher frequencies.

In summary, the results of the dynamic testing of the
233y fueled MSRE showed that the dynamic response
of the reactor is very close to the theoretical pre-
dictions. Equipment limitations required that the test
results be normalized, but testing methods were being
improved, with the goal of eliminating this step.

1.3.2 Gasin the Fuel Salt

A.Houtzeel J.R.Engel

One of the most prominent differences between the
operation in this report period and earlier operation is
the change in the volume fraction of helium bubbles
circulating with the fuel salt. Throughout nearly all of
the operation up to September 1969, the circulating
void fraction was much less than 0.1 vol % (ref. 8).
Void fractions as high as ~0.2 vol % were achieved, but
only for short times during special tests to study the
effects of voids on other reactor parameters. Beginning
16 hr after the start of fuel circulation during the 223U
critical experiment, the void fraction has been 0.5 to
0.7 vol % whenever the fuel is circulating at the normal
rate. The basic reason for the change has not yet been
positively identified, although the characteristics and
effects of the change have been examined in consider-
able detail. '

The existence of circulating voids is reflected in many
of the reactor operating parameters, some of which
provide a quantitative measure of the total voids in the
fuel loop while others are only relative or qualitative
indicators. The most direct indication of voids in the
circulating loop is the inventory of salt in the pump
bowl, as indicated by the bubbler level elements. If the
reactor is critical, another indication is obtained from

the reactivity effect of the voids in the core, provided
the indication is not obscured by other reactivity

changes. Cross correlation of the noise in the neutron-
flux and pressure signals can also be translated into an
absolute void fraction. However, the absolute calibra-
tion required for this approach was not completed
during this report period, so only relative changes in
void fraction can be reported at present. The salt level
in the annulus of the reactor access nozzle, as indicated
by the temperature distribution, is a qualitative indi-
cator of circulating voids. This level decreases when
circulating voids transport helium to the annulus and
rises when bubble-free salt dissolves gas and carries it
out.® The xenon poisoning in the reactor also provides

some information on circulating voids, but the interpre-
tation is complicated by the reactivity effect of the
voids themselves and by the nature of the dependence
of xenon poisoning on voids. So far, in the 233U
operation, we have used only the pump-bowl level
elements for absolute evaluation of the circulating void
fractions. ' |

Description of Bubbler Level Elements. — The level
indicators in the fuel pump measure the pressure
differentials between a reference line and bubbler tubes
submerged in the salt. There are two bubbler tubes, one
extending 1.626 in. below the center line of the volute
and the other 1.874 in. deeper. The gas flow is 0.15
liter/min STP through the reference line and 0.37
liter/min STP through each of the bubblers. The
differential pressures are converted into equivalent
depths of salt assuming a salt density of 140 Ib/ft>. The
range of the indicators is 10 in. of salt of this density,
and readout is in percent (1% = 0.1 in.}. In addition, the
output of the differential pressure cell on the higher
bubbler is biased by 19%; so if there were no deviation
of the salt density from the assumed value, the two
level indicators should read the same.

Measured Void Fractions. — The best measure of
circulating void fraction is obtained by observing the
changes in pump-bowl level when the fuel pump is first
started after a loop fill, when the salt is free of bubbles.
When fuel circulation was first started in run 15
(September 14), the level changes in the fuel-pump
bowl were very similar to starts in earlier runs when
there were almost no circulating voids; that is, the level
dropped about 8% as soon as the pump was started and
remained there. (This 8% level drop is due to the
accumulation of salt in the central part of the pump
housing and the spray ring.) The pump was stopped and
restarted twice in the first 14 hr, with identical results.
Then the beryllium rod was exposed in the pump bowl.
All normal-speed pump starts thereafter were different.
Each time after the start the level dropped 10 to 15%
but then gradually rose. This gradual level rise (in
general between 8 and 12% within 30 min) reflected a
gradual buildup of gas in the salt loop. A level rise of 8
to 12% is equivalent to displacement of 0.35 to 0.50 ft®
of salt from the circulating loop by gas, corresponding
to a circulating void fraction of 0.5 to 0.7 vol %.

The operation of the fuel pump with a variable-
frequency power supply near the end of the report
period allowed us to make a preliminary evaluation of
the circulating void fraction as a function of pump
speed. (Salt flow rates, both in the main loop and -

- through the pump bowl, are directly proportional to

pump speed.) With the fuel pump operating at speeds
below about 1000 rpm, all evidence indicated that the

 
 

 

circulating void fraction was practically zero. In fact,
when the pump was first started at around 530 rpm
(nominal 30-Hz power supply), the fuel-pump level
decreased about 2% after the initial starting transient.
This indicated removal, from the loop, of voids that had
not floated out during the 1.3-hr period while the pump
was off to connect it to the variable-frequency gen-
erator. Figure 1.4 shows the sharp dependence of
circulating void fraction on the pump speed above 1000
rpm. The probable reason for the rather sharp threshold
will be discussed later. (The points are actually calcu-
1ated relative to the condition at 530 rpm, where the
void fraction was assumed to be zero.)

Prior to the pump-speed experiment, we had
attempted to determine the variation of the circulating
void fraction with other system parameters. With the
fuel pump running at full speed and the reactor power
at 5 Mw, we varied the fuel-system temperature and
pressure and the pump-bowl salt level over ranges that
had changed the void fraction by a factor of 7 during
operation with the 23°U fuel salt.'® Some changes
were noted, but cross correlation of noise data from the
neutron-flux and system-pressure signals indicated that
the void fraction changed by no more than a factor of
2. The fact that the void fraction started around 0.5 to
0.7 vol %, compared with around 0.1 vol % in the
earlier experiments, may account for the smaller frac-
tional change.

Changes During Beryllium Additions. — Between the
start of the 233U operation and the end of this
reporting period, five beryllium additions were made to
the fuel salt by exposing a beryllium rod in a nickel
cage in the pump bowl. Each time there were observ-
able effects on the circulating void fraction, but the
behavior was not the same in each case.

As mentioned before, the fuel had been circulating
normally with practically no bubbles for 14 hr when
the first beryllium rod was lowered into the pump
bowl. After about 2 hr the level in the pump started to
rise, and from later observations it is evident that the
rise was due to a buildup of gas bubbles in the loop,
something we had never observed before. The increased
void fraction persisted after the beryllium rod was
removed. (Another effect was that the transfer rate of
salt to the overflow tank increased drastically; see Sect.
1.3.5)

The exposure of the second beryllium rod was made
on October 13, four weeks after the first addition, with

the reactor critical at low power and on flux servo
control. The mentioned effects of the first beryllium
addition still persisted to some degree. The insertion of
this second rod caused some very erratic and un-
expected level changes in the pump bowl (see Fig. 1.5),
which started almost immediately after the beryllium
was Jowered into the pump bowl. The spontaneous level
changes in the fuel-pump bowl were as large as 1 in. (or
10% on the level indicators), which represents about
0.42 ft® of salt (0.6 vol % in the loop). Obviously this
salt moved from the salt loop into the fuel-pump bowl
and back. Once started, the time required for a level
change was 20 to 30 min. At the same times that the
level changed, the control rod was moved by the servo
control to compensate for spontaneous changes in
reactivity of the reactor. The level decreases occurred
simultaneously with insertions of the control rod and,
conversely, level increases with rod withdrawals. It was
concluded that these level fluctuations: reflected a
varying gas-bubble fraction in the- circulating salt,
because all other system variables appeared to be
constant.

For the third beryllium addition, on November 15, it

was decided to operate the fuel pump at a lower-than-
normal level to minimize the risk of plugging the off-gas

line with foam if the level oscillations occurred again. In -

contrast to the second beryllium addition, this time it
took approximately 2% hr after the capsule was

inserted before anything happened. Then, very slowly,

the level decreased about 7%. Simultaneously the

" reactor servo control inserted the control rod 0.9 in.

Before the spontaneous level decrease stabilized, the

beryllium capsule was taken out temporarily because of
concern over operation at this abnormally low level.
The reactor system responded almost immediately to
the withdrawal. Within 15 min the level came back to
its original value, and the control rod was withdrawn to
its old position. (The time for these level changes was
only 15 to 20 min, remarkably short since it takes
about 9 min to process one loop volume through the
pump bowl. This implies that the mechanism which

governs the removal of introduction of gas bubbles

operates with a very high efficiency.) After due
consideration the beryllium capsule was inserted for the
second time; both the reactivity and the pump level
again responded as before. After about 1 hr the level
was down 8%, and the control rod had been inserted
1.7 in. Since the effects had not yet leveled out and the
level in the fuel-pump bowl was uncomfortably low, it
was decided to remove the beryllium capsule again and
raise the pump level about 5% by transferring salt from
the overflow tank into the pump bowl. Then, for the
third time, the same beryllium capsule was lowered into
the pump bowl; again the level and control rod came
down. This time the system was allowed to level off;
the control rod was inserted 2.0 in. by the servo
control, and the salt level in the pump bowl stabilized
after a drop of 8.5%. (At the same time the difference
between the readings of the level indicators also
decreased. The significance of this change is discussed
later.) When the capsule was finally taken out, the level
came up 6%, and the control rod was withdrawn about
2.0in.

The fourth beryllium addition was different in that
there was less beryllium, and it was in the form of short
cylinders between short high-temperature magnets, The

used the indications of the fuel-pump bubblers to
extract information about the void fraction and the
apparent physical salt level in the pump bow! itself.

We observed that after the first beryllium addition the
difference between the readings of the two bubbler
level indicators became much larger whenever the salt
was being circulated. When the pump was stopped, the
readings of the two bubblers came together. Using the
difference of submersion of the two bubblers and the
difference of the readings of the two level indicators, it
is possible to compute a value for the apparent density
of the fluid in the zone between the lower points of the
bubbler lines. Fluid densities were calculated this way
under a variety of conditions with the fuel salt
circulating at full flow and stagnant. Although the
accuracy of this calculation is limited by uncertainty in
the separation distance of the two bubblers, it showed
quite clearly that densities for circulating salt were
much lower than those for stagnant salt or for
circulating salt prior to the first beryllium addition in
run 15. It also showed that the apparent salt density
between the bubblers was to some extent related to the
measured salt level in the fuel pump; a higher calculated
salt density (i.e., smaller difference in level readings)
generally occurred when the indicated salt level was

. high. Figure 1.6 shows at least this general trend despite

effects of this addition were detectable but were very

mild in comparison with earlier additions.

The fifth beryllium addition took place on January
24 with the reactor at 5 Mw. The power resulted in
some “secondary” effects which actually strengthened
the idea that the presence of bubbles in the system is
strongly related to some of the unexpected events
during and after the beryllium additions. As is described
in Sect. 1.3.4, power blips were occurring during this
time. These blips ceased once the beryllium capsule was
lowered into the pump; the linear power trace became
smooth. The blips came back after the beryllium was
removed. All other effects, such as level and control rod
position changes, were similar to those in previous
beryllium additions. ‘

One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is the
following. About 50 gpm of salt are ejected at a

of the salt in the pump bowl. Because of their high
velocity the jets easily carry gas under the surface of the
salt. The bulk of this entrained gas penetrates to a
certain depth in the salt and then rises to the surface. It
is obvious that the salt to this depth contains a high
void fraction. If the zone containing this large void
fraction does not extend down below the upper
bubbler, then the two bubbler readings would not be
affected much, because basically the level indicators
measure a weight of salt. These voids would, of course,
increase the real level of the salt in the pump bowl by
an amount equivalent to the volume of the voids. If,
however, the level of the salt is lowered sufficiently (by
transfer to the overflow tank), it is easy to imagine the
high-void-fraction region extending below the lower
points of one or both of the bubbler lines. In that case,
the two level indicators would be differently affected,
and the difference in readings would reflect -the
apparent salt density change in the area between the
bubblers. This would explain the tendency for the
difference in bubbler readings to increase (i.e., density
to decrease) with decreasing level.

Near the end of this report period the pump-speed
experiment did much to substantiate this picture. In
this experiment the fuel-pump speed was varied over a
range from half to full speed. The velocity of the spray
ring jets and the flow through the pump bowl vary
directly with the speed. The relation between pump
speed and the apparent void fraction in the salt between
the bubblers is shown in Fig. 1.7. This clearly shows
that the void fraction increases as the flow rate through
the pump bowl increases and that the void fraction in

- the pump bowl is at least an order of magnitude higher

than that in the loop (cf. Fig. 1.4). Comparison of Figs.
1.4 and 1.7 also shows that a substantial void fraction
exists in the zone of the pump  bowl between the
bubblers. before the relatively sharp threshold speed is

reached at which bubbles are ingested into the loop.
This suggests that the depth to which bubbles penetrate
in the pump bowl increases with increasing jet velocity
until some of the bubbles are finally drawn into the
loop. -

Since the indicated bubble fractions in the pump are
so high, it is evident that the actual level of the
salt-bubble mixture can be substantially higher than the
indicated level. This actual fluid level is significant in
regard to the transfer of salt to the overflow tank and
the possibility of plugging the pump off-gas line with

~ salt. The relevant facts regarding the actual fluid level

are as follows:

1. The salt density in the area between the bubbler
outlets is more or less known in relation to the
weight of salt located above the bubblers from Fig.
1.6.

2. The indicated level of the salt is known when there
is a drastic change in the transfer rate to the
overflow tank, which presumably means that the
real salt level is approximately even with the inlet of
the overflow pipe (see Sect. 1.3.5).

3. From Fig. 1.6, we can determine, by extrapolation
to zero difference, the level at which the first
bubbles get below the outlet of the highest bubbler.

From this information it was possible to estimate -
approximately the density of the fluid in relation to its
depth and the relation between the real and indicated
salt levels (see Fig. 1.8).'We estimate that the “bubble

head” has a thickness of approximately 8.8 in. at full
flow. However, this thickness is probably variable and
depends, among other things, on fuel-pump speed and
the level of the top of the salt relative to the spray ring
and, possibly, on the elapsed time since the last
beryllium addition. The first two factors affect the

16

degree of agitation in the pump bowl, while the last

appears to affect the stability of bubbles in the salt. It
appears that the bubble head has its maximum thick-
ness just after beryllium additions. Because of the sharp
threshold for gas ingestion into the loop, a difference in
~ the thickness of the bubble head of only about 1% in.
could account for the differences in the observed
circulating void fraction prior to and after September
1968.

1.3.3 Neutron andr Pressure Noise Measurements
R.C.Kryter D.N.Fry J.C.Robinson!!

As a follow-up on previous studies of the 23°U-fueled
reactor,!2 analyses were made of the natural fluctua-
tions in cover-gas pressure and neutron density of the
333.fueled MSRE during normal operation at power.
~ The objectives were (1) to determine if the frequency
structure and absolute level of the neutron (NPSD) and
pressure (PPSD) power spectral "densities had been
significantly altered by the refueling, (2) to substantiate
the other indications that the loop circulating void
fraction had greatly increased, and (3) to see if the
NPSD in the vicinity of 1 Hz (identified before as a
region sensitive to the void fraction) exhibited its
previous strong dependence on certain reactor parame-
ters! 3 (notably fuel temperature).

The observed neutron and pressure noise character-
istics of the refueled reactor (operating under normal
conditions at power) were, relative to the 23°U-fueled
reactor, as follows:

1. The frequency composition of the neutron noise is
only slightly different, but the level of the NPSD in

the vicinity of 1 Hz is increased by a factor of -

~2000 to 6000. (Of this increase, only a factor of
2.2 can be accounted for by the increase in reactor
gain associated with the decreased g, for 222U.)

2. The frequency composition of the pressure noise is
noticeably different, and the level near 1 Hz is
increased by a factor of 10 to 40. (Because of the
restriction in the off-gas line, the pressure drops and
flow paths of the gas leaving the pump bowl were
different for the two series of tests. The significance
of this difference has not yet been evaluated.)

3. The average volumetric void fraction of fuel passing
through the reactor core, derived from measure-
ments and a model !* of the system that interrelates

"NPSD, PPSD, and void fraction, is increased by a
factor of ~5.

4. The circulating void fraction, NPSD, and PPSD are
all very nearly independent of changes in fuel
temperature, cover-gas pressure, and fuel-pump bowl
level, in marked contrast to the earlier experience.!3

5. The void fraction is independent of reactor power
level but decreases by a factor of ~13 when the
circulating pump is stopped and the fuel is allowed

‘to circulate by natural convection at about 4% of .

full power.

Detailed explanations of all the above observations
have not been attained yet, but all facts indicate that
marked changes occurred between the tests with 235U
and those with 233U, either in the physical properties
of the fuel salt or in the fluid-flow characteristics of the
reactor. This tentative explanation may be further
illuminated by the results of a series of tests under way
at the end of the report period, the goal of which is the
isolation of the main sources of primary-loop pressure
fluctuations. In any event the studies indicated that it is
feasible to use NPSD and PPSD measurements for
providing an on-line, continuous estimate of the circu-
lating void fraction, and plans were made to automate
the entire calculational procedure, either with an analog
computer or the BR-340 digital computer.

1.3.4 Perturbations in Nuclear Power

R. H. Guymon J.L. Crowley
P. N. Haubenreich

With the beginning of high-power operation in
January, we observed a phenomenon not seen before:
occasional small disturbances in the fuel-salt system
that involved brief perturbations of the nuclear power.
These came to be called *“blips.” Although the blips

were too small to have direct consequences (the nuclear
power generally increased by about 10% for a few
seconds), intensive efforts were made to arrive at their
explanation. These efforts included reviews to see when
they had begun, experiments on the effects of system
conditions on blip size and frequency, and detailed
analysis of observable behavior for clues to the mecha-
nism. It became clear rather early that the blips were
not related to the change in fissile material per se or to
any chemical instability, but to the unusual amount of
gas in the fuel system, discussed in earlier sections.

Characteristic Behavior During Blips. — Blips were
first noted as small, fairly sharp spikes on the neutron
level record, but it was soon discovered that disturb-
ances occurred almost simultaneously in several other
signals from the fuel system. Figure 1.9 is a chart from
a multichannel recorder showing behavior of some
significant parameters during three typical blips.

 

‘The disturbances in fuel-pump level and pressure,
although quite small, are highly significant, for they are
a clue to the mechanjsm. Examination of hundreds of -
blips at various chart speeds and signal amplifications
showed that within the second that the neutron flux
started up, both salt level and cover-gas pressure signals
always started down. The dips, though small, were
definitely outside the distribution of normal fluctua-
tions. The direction of the level and pressure changes
proved that they were not the result of the excess
power, which would tend to make level and pressure go
up. Since both decreased, it meant that some salt
entered the fuel loop to replace gas that had been
compressed somehow other than by the overpressure
in the pump bowl. |

The bottom trace in Fig. 1.9 is the temperature of a
thermocouple in a well in the core specimen access plug
at the top of the reactor vessel. Its significance will be
discussed later.

It was found that the characteristic disturbances in
pump-bowl pressure and level and access plug tempera-
ture occurred regardless of the power level, even
occurring when the. reactor was subcritical. Conversely,
power perturbations like those in the blips could be
induced by briefly withdrawing a control rod (between
001 and 0.02% &k/k for a few seconds) without
causing the disturbances in level, pressure, or tempera-
ture. Such an experiment is shown in Fig. 1.10. The
conclusion was that the power blips are but one

‘manifestation of an event which independently affects

the other variables.
The nuclear power increase involved in the blips fell

ina fairly well-defined range; the largest blip raised the

power less than 15%, with the most probable increase
being around 10% or less. The duration of the blips,
that is, the time that the power remained significantly
above the average, ranged from 1 to 40 sec. Size distribu-

18

tions and frequency of occurrence will be discussed in
detail below.

Effect of System Conditions on Blips. — Blips were
found to occur over the operating range of pressures,
fuel-salt temperatures, and pump-bowl levels and at all
power levels. What did matter was the amount of gas
circulating with the fuel salt: blips were observed only

.when the circulating gas was on the order of 0.5 vol %

or greater,

Large amounts of gas first appeared in the fuel salt on
September 15, 2 hr after a beryllium rod was immersed
in the pump bowl and weeks before the reactor was
critical on 233U. A multipoint recorder chart showed
that at the same time that the gas appeared, the access
plug thermocouple first began to fluctuate in a fashion
similar to that observed later during blips. There was no
record of pump pressure or level perturbations, since
the normal recorders are not sensitive enough to show

such small dips. Search of neutron flux records during
early nuclear operation disclosed some blips. Most of
the time they could not be seen because the noise at
low power and the action of the flux servo system
masked them. Blips were tentatively identified on a
chart of operation at 50 to 100 w on October 26. One
blip of 300 kw occurred during the 30 min on manual
rod control on November 27. None occurred during a
similar period at 1 Mw the day before. Thus blips
seemed to have started with the onset of gas entrain-
ment, but by the time the power was raised, after some
eight weeks of fuel circulation, they were not very
frequent.

After the shutdown, when fuel cuculatlon was
resumed and the power was raised, blips were found to
be occurring at a rate of 10 to 20 per hour.

Figure 1.11 shows strips cut from the nuclear power
recorder chart for operation at similar conditions on
various ‘dates from January 23 to February 17. (The
power scale is in percent of 15 Mw, so one division is
150 kw. The time scale is as indicated.) Although the
frequency and size of blips varied from hour to hour,
the traces shown are fairly typical for the day.

The first trace was recorded 11 days after the
beginning of fuel circulation, when the frequency was
around 10 to 20 per hour. The second was taken on
January 27, three days after a beryllium addition. The

frequency and the average duration of the blips were
noticeably greater. Thereafter the blip frequency and
average size gradually diminished, as suggested by the
other charts; until near the end of February only one or
two occurred per 8-hr shift.

Between February 7 and 11, the fuel temperature was
varied from 1180 to 1225°F and the pressure from 3 to
9 psig, with little or no significant effect on the blips.
The amount of gas in the loop also did not appear to be
affected very much by these changes (see Sect. 1.3.3).

There appeared to have been some decrease in the

~ circulating void fraction during the period when the

blip frequency was gradually decreasing, but the voids
by no means disappeared. Although the fraction could
not be measured very accurately, it certainly remained
fairly high (0.5 to 0.7 vol %) during the entire period
covered by Fig. 1.11. One exception was during the
heat-removal test, when the fuel circulated by natural
convection at powers up to 354 kw. The power trace on
the recorder chart, like those in Fig. 1.11, was
absolutely smooth, and no blip occurred in the 7 hr
that the reactor was at power during this test. Another
exception was a brief period while the beryllium rod
was in the salt on January 24. The pump-bowl level
showed that the bubble fraction decreased to perhaps
0.3 vol %. The blips, which had been occurring at about
10 per hour, practically stopped. (There were none for
2 hr 20 min.) As soon as the beryllium was removed the
bubble fraction rose, and in the next hour there were
17 blips. When a much milder reducing agent, a

“chromium rod, was exposed to the salt on January 29

there was no clear effect on gas or blips.

The variable-frequency power supply for the fuel
pump was set up especially to see what effect reduced
circulation rate would have on the entrained gas and the
blips. By the time it was ready the blips were not as
frequent or as large as they had been, but the

‘experiment was still very convincing. Figure 1.12 shows
‘how reducing the pump speed smoothed out the

nuclear power until the chart record appeared the same
as it had in the operation with 235 U. Reference to Fig.
1.4 shows that the bubble fraction decreased from

-about 0.4% to 0.2% to less than 0.1% in the three 233U

cases. Operation at the lowest speed was continued for
five days, during which time there was no blip. When

-the speed was.returned to 1140 rpm, the trace became

rough again and blips began to occur.

Size-Frequency Distributions. — Cursory examination
of the nuclear power traces when there are blips, as in
Fig. 1.9 or 1.11, suggests that there are two kinds of
events — the continuous small, random fluctuations and
the larger occasional blips, which look like a different
kind of event. This impression is confirmed by a

 
 

size-frequency plot such as Fig. 1.13. The small
fluctuations form the distribution at the left. The blips
are the distribution centered at about 500 kw. Figure
1.13 is fairly typical of the first few weeks of power
operation. As time went on, the peak in the blip
distribution became lower and moved to the left; that
is, the blips became less frequent and smaller. Eventu-
ally the distribution was submerged in that of the small
fluctuations. This was the case by February 17, when
the last strip on Fig. 1.11 was recorded. As seen from
this figure, however, an occasional blip could still be
distinguished, mainly because of its different shape.

Possible Mechanisms. — The small fluctuations in
nuclear power are caused by very small fluctuations in
system pressure which are translated, through the
compressible voids in the core, into reactivity fluctu-
ations.!® -

The mechanism for the blips has not been resolved in
detail. It is almost certain, however, that it involves
sporadic changes in the amount of gas held up in the
core. :

There is convincing evidence that the blip mechanism
is not movement of separated uranium. In the first
place, analyses of the salt showed conditions far

removed from any precipitation of uranium or uranium

oxide. The absence of any uranium-bearing precipitate
is also indicated by the temperatures in the lower head
of the reactor, which did not show any abnormal
heating there (Sect. 1.3.7). More direct is the evidence
of the pump-bowl level and pressure: if a power blip
were caused by movement of excess uranium up
through the core, the resulting temperature rise would
tend to push the salt level up. Such changes in level as
occur are in the opposite direction. Furthermore, blips
with all the symptoms except the power perturbation
occur with the reactor subcritical, when uranium
movement would have no effect.

The clue that blips are related to gas in the core is the
fact that they occur only when the circulating void
fraction is more than about 0.5 vol %. Blips appeared
when the gas fraction first increased, and they disap-
peared when the fraction was reduced by either of two
distinctly different mechanisms: reduction of fuel

‘pump speed and exposure of beryllium to the salt.

An intermittent obstruction in the fuel flow between
the core and the pump suction would increase the
pressure and compress the gas in the core, changing
reactivity and pump-bowl level in the observed direc-

tions. Consideration of the necessary implications made -

this hypothesis seem quite improbable, however. As
shown in Sect. 4.3, reactivity increases of about 0.15%
8kfk in 1 to 2 sec were fairly typical. This corresponds
to an increase in fuel density, averaged over the core, of
0.034%. Starting with an average void fraction in the
core of 0.6 vol % and an average pressure in the core of
35 psia, a pressure change in the core of 2.0 psi would
be required to give the observed reactivity effect. It
does not appear that an intermittent flow blockage
could occur anywhere between the core and the pump
suction, with the possible exception of the perforated
metal screen below the outlet from the top of the
reactor vessel. The normal pressure drop across this
screen is only 0.5 psi, and to cause a pressure change of
2.0 psi in the core, half of the 195-in.2 conical screen
would have to be covered and then uncovered. TIus is
hardly credible.

What seems much more probable is that a blip is
caused by a small quantity of gas which has collected at
some point. in the core suddenly breaking loose and
being swept up and out of the reactor vessel. As little as
2.0in.2 of gas from channels near the center of the core
would be enough to produce a 0.015% 6k/k reactivity
increase. There is evidence that some gas does cling in
the core, at least under low-flow conditions. (The
temperature coefficient measurements implied that all
gas did not leave the core when the pump stopped, and
a clear indication of a compressible volume in the core
was obtained when a slight pressure change after 6 hr of
natural convection circulation produced a detectable
reactivity change.) The triggering mechanism for release
of gas clinging in the core is presumably a very small
perturbation in flow or pressure. A possible cause of
such perturbations is the occasional release of a burst of
gas from the reactor access nozzle which is suddenly
compressed as it passes through the pump. '

The reasons for suspecting that gas from the access

“nozzle triggers the blips are: (1) When the circulating

bubble fraction is greater than about 0.5%, gas fills the
plug annuli all the way down to the juncture with the
flowing salt stream; (2) coincidentally with blips,
changes are observed in a thermocouple at the bottom
of the nozzle which indicate temporary increases in the
salt level; and (3) the blip frequency increased while the
temperature of the gas trapped in the annuli was being

- allowed - to rise (pushing some gas ‘out into the flowing

stream) ‘and teinporarily decreased by a factor of 4

when cooling of the annuli was resumed. The thermo-

couple indication lags the start of the blip, but this is

due, at least in part, to heat transfer time constants. -
Although there are hypotheses, no theory has been

developed that satisfactorily explains all observed

21

aspects of the blips. In particular, there is as yet no
explanation of why the higher reactivity (or lower void
volume) persists for a variable length of time and then
rather quickly returns to the original level.

'1.3.5 Salt Transfer to Overflow Tank
A. Houtzeel

Except for a relatively brief period early in the
operation of the MSRE (prior to April 1966), salt has
consistently transferred from the fuel loop to the
overflow tank whenever the fuel pump is running.!®
Although there were variations in the rate of transfer
that could not be explained, the rates were generally
less than 1.5 1b/hr. During the six-month run with 235U
fuel (run 14) the transfer rate consistently averaged

" about 0.5 Ib/hr. The operation with 233U has been

marked by very wide variations in the transfer rate,

‘with occasional values as high as 72 Ib/hr.

The flush-salt operation in preparation for the 233U

runs and the first few hours of operation with 233U
fuel (prior to the first beryllium addition) showed
transfer rates that were consistent with past experience.

. The observed rates were in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 Ib/hr.

After the first beryllium addition in run 15, these rates

~increased to 4 Ib/hr and even much higher. The very

high transfer rates occurred after the beryllium capsules
had been removed from the pump bowl and gradually
diminished to about 4 1b/hr during the next 100 to 150
hr of fuel-salt circulation after the beryllium addition.
During the beryllium additions, when the salt level was
low, the transfer rates were generally much lower, in
the order of 1 to 2 Ib/hr. The salt transfer rate jumped
to 29 1b/hr just after the second beryllium addition and
72 1b/hr after the third addition. Figure 1.14 shows the
variation of the transfer rate with time after the third
beryllium addition. Generally speaking, it was observed
that the higher the indicated fuel-pump level, the higher
the transfer rate. However, this was not a linear
relation. As shown in Fig. 1.15, there was a drastic
decrease in transfer rate once the salt level dropped
below a certain threshold value. This change can be
explained if the actual level of the salt-gas mixture
(foam) in the pump bowl is significantly higher than the
level indicated by the bubblers. Then, when the real
level of salt with bubbles (say “bubble head”) extends
beyond the inlet of the overflow pipe, high transfer

' rates would occur; conversely, if the real level in the

was in manual control throughout the experiment, and
no adjustments were made to the control rods; so the
nuclear power was controlled entirely by the inherent
feedback of the system. Figure 1.16 shows that the
reactor power followed the radiator load smoothly and

. with little or no tendency to oscillate. For this

experiment it had been decided that the temperature
difference across the reactor vessel should not exceed
about 75°F. With this limitation the maximum power
attained, corrected for the afterheat from previous
power operation and for changes in electric heater
power, was 354 kw. The measured reactor vessel AT at
this power level was 76°F, and the fuel flow rate was
estimated to be 31 gpm.

1.3.7 Radiation Heating -
C. H. Gabbard

Reactor Vessel. — The temperature differences be-
tween the reactor inlet and the lower head and between
the inlet and the core support flange during power
operation with 233U were examined for any indication
of sedimentation buildup within the reactor vessel. The
values observed previously! 7 (revised to correspond to
the reactor power level based on the latest value of
coolant salt specific heat) are shown in Table 1.4 along
with the data from run 17. The temperature differences
were slightly greater with the 233U fuel, presumably as
a result of the greater neutron leakage, which results in
more fissioning in the peripheral regions of the reactor

-vessel.

- Fuel Pump Tank. — The temperatures on the upper
surface of the fuel-pump tank were somewhat lower
-during run 17 than had been previously observed.

 

Y7MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,

Decreases in these temperatures have been observed
previously,'® but no satisfactory explanation of these
decreases has been found. When operation of the fuel
pump was started on the variable-frequency supply, the
pump-tank temperatures at low reactor power were
found to increase with increasing pump speed. The

- temperatures also increased when the restriction in the

522 line at the pump tank cleared following the power
increase to 7 Mw at a pump speed of 1000 rpm.
However, the full-power temperatures at normal pump
speed (1200 rpm) still appear to be slightly less than
were observed during run 14,

cycle life of the fuel system freeze flanges had been
used by the end of February. This compares with a
value of 73% at the end of the previous semiannual

five fills during the 2 3:"U fuel loading.

carrier salt into which it was to be loaded. The quantity
of enriching salt to be added (about 14,000 cm®) made
it impractical to use the sampler-enricher, which is

~ limited to about 25 cm® per addition. Therefore

equipment was designed to load salt into a drain tank

containing the radioactive carrier salt. The equipment is
shown in Fig. 1.17. Cans of salt containing up to 7 kg
of uranium were brought from the TURF, where it had
been prepared,!® in a heavily shielded carrier, one at a
time. Each can was lowered from the carrier into the
standpipe as shown in Fig. 1.18. After the shield was
sealed, the valve leading to the drain tank was opened,
and the can, attached to a long rod, was lowered into
the upper part of the half-full drain tank. After a few
minutes in the 1200°F tank, the enriching salt began to
melt; within an hour all had drained into the pool of
carrier salt below. After a strain gage device supporting
the rod indicated that the can was empty, it was drawn
up into the standpipe and the isolation valve closed
below it. The empty, but still radioactive, can was then
cleaned of gross contamination by rotating it in front of
the exhaust line. It was weighed precisely before being
stored in the turntable. Only then was another can

broilght in. (To eliminate any chance of accidental

criticality, only one loaded can was in the equipment at
any time.) Six cans of 233U-bearing salt were added in
this way, with no release of activity and very low
radiation doses to the operator. The efficiency was

- quite high: less than 0.2% of the salt failed to run out

of the cans.

The salt-addition equipment was also used for sam-

pling the salt immediately after processing. A long-
handled tool was used to immerse a capsule in the salt,
and then lift it up and place it in a transport container
in the standpipe. No difficulties were encountered in
this operation. ' ,

1.4.2 Salt Samplers
M. Richardson  R.H.Guymon

Fuel Sampler-Enricher. — During the 233U zero-
power experiments (run 15), the fuel sampler-enricher

was used to add 27 capsules of enriching salt, to take 28
samples of the fuel salt and fuel-pump cover gas, to
expose four rods of beryllium for periods from 3% to
11% hr, and to dip six magnets into the salt to retrieve
magnetic powder in or on the salt. These operations
were carried out with no unusual difficulties or mechan-
ical problems. Although sample capsules would not go
all the way to the bottom of the cage in the pump
bowl, presumably because of the capsules that had been
abandoned there earlier,2® regular 10-g sample ladles
were immersed, and even the longest capsules retrieved

“ salt when the pump level was high.

During the December startup of what was to be the
approach to full power, a failure occurred in the
sampler-enricher mechanism whose repair entailed some

two weeks delay. During an attempt to remove a

capsule from the latch, it was found that the cable
could be pulled off the reel without the motor turning.
The tentative diagnosis was that one of the pair of drive
gears was slipping on its shaft. In order to gain access to
the sampler drive unit, it was necessary to remove the
shield blocks over the reactor cell. This, in turn,
required that the fuel be drained. After a temporary
containment enclosure and necessary shielding had been
set up around the sampler, the sampler drive assembly
was disconnected and lifted, and a 3-in. hole was sawed
in the side of the containment box adjacent to the
gears. One gear was loose on the shaft because its two
setscrews had come loose. We repositioned this gear and
tack-welded it on the shaft. The other gear we fastened

Loading Equipment.

 

26

securely with jam screws on top of the setscrews. A
patch was then welded on the box, and the drive was
reinstalled. This work was done quickly and without
excessive exposure of personnel despite the high radia-
tion levels (10 r/hr at 12 in. from the box) by the use of
shielding and extended tools designed especially for this
job. Before operation was resumed the manipulator
hand was repaired, the illuminator port and viewing
window lens were replaced because they had been
discolored by radiation, and an imperfect seal in the
removal valve was replaced.

After operations were resumed, the sampler per-
formed acceptably through the end of the report
period. Minor difficulty was encountered with the
mechanical closure device on the inner containment
door, but changing the timing of actions which occur
during the closing was effective. In January, while a
chromium rod was being exposed in the pump bowl,
radioactivity in a sampler exhaust line indicated some
release of gas in the sampler. The fuel-pump over-
pressure was reduced in an effort to stop the release.
This was not effective, and it was-necessary to withdraw
the chromium rod and close the operational valve, thus

. terminating the chromium addition after 6 hr exposure.

The amount of activity released to the stack was
inconsequential (<0.08 mc), and after repairs were
made, no further releases occurred. The release was
apparently not due to, but coincidental with, the °
chromium addition.

Further checks at the sampler-enricher revealed a leak
around the shaft of vacuum pump 1 due to low oil level.

By the end of the report period the sampler-enricher
had been used for a total of 141 uranium additions and
426 sampling operations (including beryllium and chro-
mium additions and magnet insertions).

During the report period the coolant-salt sampler was
used to take three 10-g samples, bringing the total to
69. No operating difficulties were encountered.

1.4.3 Control Rods and Drives
M. Richardson ’

Drop times for the MSRE control rods, measured
from the initiation of the scram signal with the rod
fully withdrawn until it reaches the lower limit,
normally are between 0.75 and 1.00 sec. Records
showed the drop time on rod 3 gradually increasing
over the months from a low of 0.85 sec shortly after it
was installed in the fall of 1966. During November
1968 the drop time exceeded 1.00 sec for the first time.
Analysis of position vs time during drops showed a
 

 

 

o

fairly uniform drag or friction over the entire travel.
While the reactor was down for the sampler repairs in
December, the drive for rod 3 was removed and found
to be in good condition except for slight galling on the
air tube. The air tube was replaced, but there was no
improvement in drop time. The drive from rod 2 was
moved to rod 3, and similar slow drop times were
observed (1.1 to 1.2 sec). The highly radioactive rod
was then lifted from its thimble and inspected using an
omniscope. There were only very minor scratches on
the poison elements and nothing on the upper hose to
indicate any binding in the thimble. It was concluded
that the increasing drop time was most likely due to
gradually increasing internal friction in the flexible rod.
Because of the design of the mechanism, the driving
force during a free drop is less than half the weight of
the parts that are accelerated. Therefore this force was
increased by fitting a 1.5-1b sleeve around the cylinder
of the shock absorber in the drive. The drop time then
was 091 sec, and it decreased slightly after high-
temperature operation resumed. At the end of the
report period the drop times were averaging 0.84, 0.76,
and 0.87 sec for rods 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

1.4.4 Off-Gas Systems
A.1. Krakoviak

The off-gas piping of both the coolant and fuel pumps
experienced gradual plugging at the gas outlet pipes of
both pumps and also farther downstream.

The restriction in the fuel system off-gas pipe at the
pump bowl reported earlier®!'?? reappeared after
approximately one month of operation with the new
fuel. The restriction was blown clear once during
pressure-drop measurements, but reappeared a week
later and could not be dislodged by back blowing
helium from the drain tank to the pump bowl. The
pressure drop across the restriction had increased to 4
psi by the last week in November, when the fuel and
coolant systems were drained to clean out the off-gas
lines of both systems and also to mix the fuel before
the start of full-power operation.

The flange at the fuel-pump bowl was removed and a
flexible cable assembly, connected to a filter and a
vacuum pump, was used to ream out the off- -gas line to
the fuel pump and also to collect a sample of the
restricting material (reported in Sect. 11.1).

ORNL-4254, pp. 13—14.

27

The reactor was then refilled; after about three weeks
of operation, the restriction reappeared in mid-January
and gradually increased to a AP of 5.5 psi. Because the
rapid recurrence of the restriction at the pump-bowl
exit threatened to become a serious nuisance, a com-
pact 2-kw heater unit was designed for this section of
line. Development tests on a mockup showed that it
could be maneuvered into position through the pump
support structure using long-handled tools through the
maintenance shield. A unit was prepared in case it
should be needed. In the last week in February, during
a routine transfer of fuel from the overflow tank to the
fuel pump, the restriction was blown clear, resulting in
a complete transfer of fuel from the overflow tank to
the pump bowl. The pressure drop in this section of line
was then below the limit of detection (about 0.1 psi).

On two occasions (the latter part of January and the
latter part of February) a restriction developed in the
fuel system off-gas line downstream of the 4-in. holdup
pipe and upstream of the line to the auxiliary charcoal
bed. This restriction was blown clear by venting the fuel
pump through the drain tanks and then pressurizing the
downstream side of the restriction.

During the last week in January a buildup of some
material (presumably hydrocarbons from the fuel-pump
lubricating oil) at the entrance to all four main charcoal
beds "resulted in an unacceptable flow restriction
through the beds. The water level in the pit was
lowered, and about a foot of the inlet sections of all
four beds was heated with electrical heaters installed
previously for this purpose.?® Although two of the
three heater elements installed on beds 1A and 1B and
one element on bed 2B failed, all four charcoal beds
were restored to their original flow capacity.

A restriction periodically developed in the vicinity of
the safety block valves in the inlet to the off-gas
sampler. (The block valves have %, -in.-diam ports, and
the piping is 0.083-in.ID autoclave tubing.) This line
tees off the main off-gas line upstream of the main
charcoal beds. The restriction was successfully cleared
each time by back blowing with helium. Thermal
conductivity measurements upstream and downstream

- of a hot copper oxide bed showed that about 1 to 2 g

of hydrocarbons per day were flowing with the off-gas
past the sample point. (See Sect. 11.1.) This is not
inconsistent -with the indicated losses of oil in the fuel
pump. :

The coolant off-gas system also expenenced gradual
plugging at the pump bowl and in the porous metal

filter upstream of PCV-528.%% Replacement of the
filter restored this portion of the system to normal

- flow; the application of heat with a torch during the

November shutdown cleared the restriction at the pump
bowl. During the heatup a brown vapor (hydrocarbons)
was driven out of the off-gas line, and a cleanout tool
inserted toward the pump bowl came out covered with
black, heavy grease. The restriction was not cleared,
however, until the junction of the off-gas line and the
pump bowl was gotten quite hot. There was practically
no evolution of vapors from the line at this time,
indicating that the restriction was, at least to some
extent, salt. Also during the November shutdown, all
the coolant off-gas valves were dismantled and cleaned.
The valves and interconnecting lines were found to have
a light layer of oil on the inner surface, and approxi-
mately 10 to 20 cc of liquid oil was cleaned from low

“pockets in the interconnecting lines. A trap for con-

densed oil vapors was installed in the line near the
pump, and heaters were installed on the line at the exit
from the pump bowl. Approximately six weeks after
the resumption of operations, the coolant off-gas line at

28

the pump bowl again showed evidence of a restriction,

and the heater was energized. The pipe under the heater

" had been running at 900°F (due to heat conduction

from the pump bowl), and the restriction cleared when
the temperature increased to 1150°F.

1.4.5 Component Cooling System
P. H. Harley

Component cooling pumps 1 and 2 operated for 3478
and 474 hr, respectively, during the six-month report
period. CCP-1 had indicated a slight loss of capacity but
was operating satisfactorily at the end of the period.

In December, CCP-2 was shut down by low oil
pressure resulting from oil loss through a leaking shaft
seal and a sticking oil bypass valve. Both items were
replaced. The internal surfaces of the relief valve were
coated with a lacquer, which indicated overheating of
the oil. An unsuccessful attempt was made to improve
cooling of the oil by putting the water to the oil coolers
in series instead of parallel. This increased the water
flow to the oil cooler of the operating blower from 5 to
about 7 gpm but did not have a significant effect on the
oil temperature.

1.4.6 Containment and Ventilation
P. H. Harley

In September the annual containment testing was
completed with a cell-pressure test at 20 psig. The cell
outleakage was 57 scf/day (about 25% of permissible
rate). The rest of the containment check was reported
previously.?®

The indicated inleakage (at —2 psig) has been <20
scf/day since the cell was evacuated, with the exception
of the first six days. During the initial six days the
apparent inleakage started at 78 scffday and decreased
to 22 scf/day. This is typical behavior that occurs as the
vapor content of the cell atmosphere increases to an
equilibrium value, After the cell comes to an equilib-
rium vapor pressure, about % gal of condensate is
removed daily through a condensate collection system.
The source of these in-cell water vapors is believed to be

.a leaking space cooler.

In September the west bank of the ventilation stack
roughing filters was replaced because the pressure drop
had built up. A standard DOP test of all three banks of
absolute filters at that time showed efficiencies between
99.994 and 99.996%. The acceptable efficiency is
99.95%. ,

The drive belts on stack fan No. 1 faﬂed on February
23, 1968, and ventilation was switched to SF No. 2. As
an extra precautionary measure the reactor was taken
from 8 Mw to 10 kw while maintenance personnel
were called and stack fan No. 1 was repaired and
returned to service.

The release of activity to the environment was very
low during this report period, being only 0.35 mc of
beta-gamma and <0.25 mc of particulate matter. The
largest single release was 0.08 mc of beta-gamma
activity from a leak which developed at the fuel
sampler.

1.4.7 Electrical System
T. L. Budson

The automatic voltage control system for motor
generator set No. 1 failed two times during this report
period. Both times the unit was operated on manual
control until the vacuum tubes in the automatic
controls could be replaced.

There were two automatic transfers of the 50-kva
dc-ac inverter load to TVA supply. The first was caused

 

25 MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug 31, 1968,
ORNL4344, p. 32.
 

 

29

by a failure of a thyrister in the inverter logic circuit.
The other was caused by 2 momentary ground during
maintenance on the computer.

When a transfer occurs, many alarms are received in
the control room. Some are caused by loss of operating
equipment, and others are due to the momentary loss
of control voltage to certain monitors. These have to be
reset to stop the alarm and control action. After the
first inverter failure, all operating equipment was
restarted, but an emergency fuel drain occurred before
the reactor-cell air activity monitors were reset. The
fuel salt was drained to both drain tanks (FD-1 and
FD-2). No drain or other serious condition resulted
from the second inverter failure.

1.4.8 Heaters
T. L. Hudson

The operation of the heaters continued with only
minor difficulties during this report period. Heater
HX-1, located on the south end of the heat exchanger,
developed a partial ground in the latter part of October.
In order to clear the ground detector lights on bus 5,
the heater was taken out of service. This was possible
because tests had been performed after run 11 which
determined that this heater was not essential for -
preheating the system from a cold condition.2® After
run 14 this heater had been removed from the reactor
cell and lead wire failures in the junction box re-
paired.2” The heater functioned satisfactorily during
subsequent heatup and until the partial ground .de-

veloped. The cause of the ground was suspected to be a
broken ceramic bead on the lead wire between a heater
element and the junction box mounted on top of the
unit.

About a 30% drop in current on one heater on the
fuel line between the reactor and the fuel pump
occurred late in September. After a resistance check
indicated a side heater element had failed, the spare
heater elements were placed in service.

1.4.9 Other

The fuel- and coolant-salt pumps continued to oper-
ate with no sign of trouble. By the end of the report
period the fuel pump had run for 23,748 hr and the
coolant pump for 25,141 hr. Oil leakage past the lower
shaft seal collects in an external tank. The average
accumulation rate was 13,5 cc/day for the fuel pump
and 14.7 ccfday for the coolant pump. Based on
inventories, during the report period 1.5 1 liters of oil
was lost from the oil system supplying the fuel pump?®
and 2.2 £ 1 liters from the oil system supplying the

coolant pump.

that 1 to 2 g/day is entrained in the off-gas stream (see Sect.

- '1.4.4).

2.1 FREEZE-FLANGE THERMAL-CYCLE TEST
F.E.Lynch

Thermal cycling of the prototype freeze flange was
resumed after the shutdown for inspection at the end of
cycle 268.! Operation of the flange was continued
through cycle 321, when it was again shut down for
inspection of the flange and minor repairs to the

 

operation equipment. Very few operation problems
were experienced during this period of operation.

A complete dye-penetrant inspection of the inner face
and the bore of both flanges was made at the end of
cycle 321. The female flange was still free of cracks or

indication of a defect. Penetrant inspection of the male
flange inner face and the neck revealed no indication of

a crack. The penetrant did indicate the crack observed:

previously! in the bore of the male flange where the
alignment stub was welded to the flange face. The crack
had lengthened slightly during the 53 cycles, and the
porosity in and around the alignment stub weld was
more extensive. Figure 2.1 shows the crack, which now
extended approximately 120° clockwise from the upper
bore thermocouple. A porosity band continued from
this point to about 150 to 155°. From this circum-
ferential crack there were porosity bands which propa-
gated % to % in. farther into the bore, being more
pronounced at approximately S0, 90, 120, and 150°. A
porosity band extended about 155° counterclockwise
from the upper bore thermocouple, as shown in Fig.
2.2. The penetrant also indicated a porosity band
extending about % in. farther into the bore at 90, 120,
and 135°. :

As reported above, the female flange suffered no
crack detectable by the dye-penetrant method of
inspection. Therefore it appears that the service life of a
flange pair would be greater if two female flanges with

an insert to aid in the remote assembly of the flanges
were used in place of the present design.

Thermal cycling of the freeze flange was resumed
after reassembly. By the end of February the flange had
been subjected to a total of 350 thermal cycles. At the
end of cycle 371 the inner face and bore of the flanges
will again be inspected by the dye-penetrant method
and the results checked with a fluorescent penetrant.

2.2 PUMPS

2.2.1 Mark 2 Fuel Pump

The mark 2 fuel salt pump, which features a larger gas
surge space than the pump in the MSRE,? underwent
initial testing with salt during this report period. By the
end of the period it has circulated the molten salt
LiF-BeF, -ZiF4-ThF4-UF, (68-25-5-1-1 mole %) for

 

2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1967,
ORNL~4119, p. 64. |

 
 

approximately 4000 hr at flows to 1350 gpm and
temperatures between 1020 and 1225°F.

Because the unsupported length of shaft is longer in
the mark 2 pump, careful measurements of vibration
were made during this operation. The maximum axial
displacement was approximately 1 mil and the maxi-
mum radial displacement was 0.1 mil at 1165 rpm and
1350 gpm, essentially identical to the displacements on
the mark 1 pumps in the same facility. The oil leakage
rate past the lower shaft seal and into the catch tank
was less than 10 cc/day.

From the beginning of salt operation, periodic
plugging was experienced in the pump-tank off-gas line.
Plug material was found as far as 40 ft downstream
from the pump tank collected in valves and other
naturally restricted flow areas, where it caused prob-
lems in maintaining the purge gas flow of 4 liters/min.
After a commercial filter was installed in the line
approximately 15 ft from the pump tank, there were no
further problems downstream. Plugging occurred later,
however, in the off-gas nozzle at the pump tank. About
once per week the plugging was cleared by torch

~ heating the nozzle and about 18 in. of the adjacent line

or by rapping the nozzle with a hammer. Petrographic
examination of a small sample of the plug material
showed that it was salt, in nearly spherical droplets of
15 p diameter and smaller. A possible solution to this
problem was suggested, namely, a heated reflux trap at
the pump-bowl outlet. The liquid salt aerosols would be
impacted on baffle surfaces in tortuous passages in the
trap, allowing liquid salt to accumulate into droplets
sufficiently large to fall back into the pump tank

32

against the very small drag force of the gas flow. Design
and installation of the reflux trap were held up by
insufficient funds.

Measurements were started with the radiation densi-
tometer to determine the void fraction of gas circu-
lating around the loop with the salt. Observations were
made while the pump was operated at two different
liquid levels in the pump tank: 0.3 in. above the normal
operating level and 2.4 in. below the normal level. The
differences between densitometer measurements taken
at zero flow and 1350 gpm at each of the levels
indicated that the gas content of the circulating salt was
not detectable at or near the normal level, while at the
lower level it was 0.1% by volume. The corresponding
value at the normal level with the mark 1 pump design
in the prototype facility was 0.1%.> No information
was obtained at the lower level with the mark 1 design.

At the end of the period, operation was continuing
for the observation of the shaft seal leakage per-
formance and the plugging in the pump-tank off-gas
nozzle. Additional void-fraction measurements were
planned at pump-tank liquid levels considerably above
normal. ' -

2.2.2 Oil Pump Endurance Test

The oil pump endurance test? was continued. By the
end of this report period the pump had run for 48,794
hr circulating oil at 160°F and 20 gpm.

3.1 MSRE OPERATING EXPERIENCE
J. L. Redford

Extensive tests were performed on the relays in the
rod-scram circuits to ensure that no further relay
failures would be experienced. No failures occurred
either during the tests or in subsequent operation.
These relays are now tested once each 24 hr to detect
single failures should they occur. Noise suppressors (RC
and diode) were installed across some of the nonsafety
contacts of these relays to alleviate the noise which had
sometimes caused difficulty during in-service tests of
the scram relays. ' '

Both fission chambers were replaced once during this
report period. These chambers had been in operation
nine months and one year, which is a great improve-
ment over the previously reported three-month average
life.! The improvement is aftributed primarily to
changes in the method of sealing the chamber connec-
tions and cables against intrusion of water. Several
components in the pulse amplifier for the No. 1
wide-range counting channel failed due to overload
when the fission chamber in that channel failed. No
damage was found in any other components of the
channel.

The rod<control servo was modified to allow an
increase in the servo dead band to compensate for the
more rapid flux response of the reactor with 233U fuel.
A further modification was made to allow the rod servo
to be used as a rod-position demand, rather than a
flux/outlet-temperature demand controller, to give
more consistent rod-position variations for some of the
dynamics experiments. ,

An eight-channel Sanborn recorder was installed to
monitor several reactor parameters to assist in analysis
of the power “blips” which were observed after the
beryllium additions were made to the 223U fuel.

 

\MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1968,

A fission chamber and a BF; chamber were installed
in the drain-tank cell near drain tank No. 2 to monitor
the neutron counting rates during the large 233U
additions. (Data from these chambers on the multipli-
cation of the internal neutron source also confirmed the
conclusion reached from calculations that the drain
tanks would provide safe subcritical storage of the
233y fuel) The chambers were removed before the
cells were sealed for the final approach to criticality
with 233U,

3.2 CONTROLS SYSTEM DESIGN
P. G. Herndon

Further additions and modifications were made to the
instrumentation and - controls systems as experience
revealed the need or desirability of more information
for the operators, improved performance, or increased
protection. The number of such changes was consid-
erably less than in the previous period.! Twenty-three
requests for changes in the design of the reactor system
were reviewed. Of these, 2 resulted in minor changes in
instrumentation and controls, 8 required only changes
in process switch operating setpoints, 11 did not require

- changes in process instruments or controls, and on the

remaining 2, design revisions were pending at the end of
the report period.

The major design effort was on the documentation of
the instrumentation and controls. Criteria drawings of
the reactor system were brought up to date, and recent
revisions' _were added to the drawings of the fuel
processing system.

3.3 MSRE COMPUTER SYSTEM
C.D.Martin  J.D.Burke C.W.Kunselman

The E:omputer system, which is used mainly for data
acquisition, was originally leased from the Bunker-
Ramo Corporation with the full-time services of a

 
 

 

 

 

maintenance engineer included in the lease agreement.
When the computer system was purchased by ORNL in
February 1968, the Instrumentation and Controls
Division assumed the maintenance responsibility, with
emergency maintenance assistance available on call
from a Bunker-Ramo representative in Chattanooga.
Two ORNL men attended a four-week accelerated
maintenance course at the manufacturer’s plant in June
1968 and have been maintaining the system since that
time. '

~ Modification to the computer-room air-conditioning
system to maintain the relative humidity between 40
and 60% required increasing the room temperature
from 65 to 70°F. The 5° increase caused overheat
problems in three of the nine computer cabinets. This
problem was remedied by installing an additional fan in
the top of each cabinet to improve internal air
circulation.

During the reporting period there were a nominal
number of small electronic problems with the com-
puter. These included power supply failures, high-
frequency noise on the time-of-day clock signal, and the
usual sporadic failures of transistors or diodes. One
rather bothersome analog-input-system problem which
held up the reactor test program for several days was
finally traced to a loose connection in the analog-input
cabinet. Time began to take its toll in the mercury-
wetted analog input relays, but this was not unex-
pected, since many of them had more than 25,000,000
operations.

A large effort was started to consolidate certain
documentation on the hardware and to compile work-

ing logic diagrams of complete systems. In several areas
the MSRE computer has specially designed or modified
sections not fully covered by the manufacturer’s stand-
ard system documentation. The analog-input subsystem
is a good example. This is the subsystem that has caused

. the most maintenance problems in the past, and

adequate documentation is essential to timely main-
tenance,

Approximately five man-months of programming
were provided for many software system changes that
were made almost routinely. (The failure of a single
thermocouple sometimes required changes to as many
as six different programs. Operation on 223U required
changes to the reactivity-balance calculation, and the
results of the experiments being conducted on the
reactor frequently dictated computer program changes.)
The neutron-noise-analysis program was modified to use
the computer plotter to plot the power spectral density

in addition to typing results.

A significant programming accomphshment during
the reporting period was the adaptation of the Digital
Equipment Corporation’s conversational-mode calcu-
lation language FOCAL to the MSRE computer to run
in background time. This allowed MSRE personnel not
previously familiar with computer programming to
program engineering calculations on the computer in

the FORTRAN-ike language and run them in the
computer’s “spare time.” This time is available in very
frequent, short increments, so that a calculation can be -
interspersed between reactor monitoring functions and
can cause a continuous typewriter printout that makes
the user feel that he has all of the computer’s time
rather than just a part of it.

4. MSRE Reactor Analys1s

4.1 LONG-TERM ISOTOPIC CHANGES AND
REACTIVITY EFFECTS DURING OPERATION
WITH 22°U

B. E. Prince

Theoretical studies of the MSRE neutronic character-
istics with 223U were extended to include the nuclide
changes and reactivity effects associated with an ex-
tended period of power operation. In particular, the
changes in inventories of the various isotopes of
uranium and plutonium were calculated, and all changes
having a significant effect on the core reactivity were
estimated as a function of the time-integrated fission
rate. These estimates were based on a revised and
updated set of reaction cross sections (ENDF compila-
tion), which were averaged over the energy spectrum of
the reactor and the volume of the fuel salt. Table 4.1 is
a list of the averaged cross sections entering into the
calculation of long-term changes. These are “effective”
thermal cross sections, which can be multiplied by the
thermal flux magnitude to obtain the average reaction
rates per atom per unit volume of salt, that is, ~

where V, is the volume of the fuel salt and E, is the |

cutoff energy defining the “thermal” component of the
flux. The method of approximating the neutron flux
dlstnbutlon ¢(r E), was sumlar to that descnbed in

~ earlier studies.! :
The nuclide chain equations - for the uranium and_
plutonium isotopes present in significant quantities in

the fuel salts were integrated using the reaction cross

~ sections listed in Table 4.1. The time-integrated fission

encrgy  deposition was the independent variable of
interest, and in these calculations we assumed that the

effective heat energy deposited per’ ﬁssion was 197 Mev

reactivity change appearing in this figure actually
represents only one component of the net change in

The depletion of 225U is presently being accounted for
separately in the fissile uranium burnup term in the

by the curve in Fig. 4.2, these two effects very nearly
cancel one another, leaving the net mventory of 235U

4.2 ANALYSIS OF ZERO-POWER =
ROD-CALIBRATION EXPERIMENTS

B. E. Prince

Recalibration of the control rods was necessary for
operation with 233U, because of the increased impor--
. tance of neutron leakage effects ‘and the more
. “thermalized” energy spectrum relative to the *35U
- loading. For the earlier loading we had performed both

period—differential-worth experiments and rod-drop—

integral-worth experiments on the regulating rod.* The

former measurement determined the slope of the
reactivity vs rod position curve at a fixed uranium
concentration and an initially critical condition. By
adding excess uranium and varying the initial critical

37

rod positions for these experiments, we were able to
calibrate the rod over its entire length of travel. In the
rod-drop experiments, we determined the total negative
reactivity corresponding to the scram of the rod from
its initial critical position at some specified uranium

- concentration. However, because the rod-drop experi-
ment required a more elaborate recording technique
and analysis, it was convenient to perform it only a few
times during the course of the uranium enrichments.
Hence, in the earlier experiments with 235U, we used
the results of integrated period—differential-worth data
as the basis of our final evaluation of the rod worths.
The drop experiments were used mainly to cross check
the integrated period data, as well as to test the
technique of the rod-drop experiment itself.

When we attempted to apply this same general
approach to the 233U calibration experiments, we
encountered some obstacles, however. In brief, after the
data from the differential-worth measurements were
collected and analyzed, the precision of the results
proved to be too poor for application in the manner
described above. Although we have not been able to

. pinpoint exactly where all this “scatter” originated,
there are reasons to believe that error in the determi-
nation of rod position may have caused much of the

' problem this time (see Sect. 1.2.2).

Because of the poor precision of the differential-
worth experiments, it became necessary to rely more
heavily on the results of the rod-drop measurements to
obtain the information required to calibrate the rods. In
the course of the zero-power experiments with 223U,
we had performed two sets of drop experiments, one
near the start of the excess uranium additions and one
when the critical position of the regulating rod was near
the position of maximum differential worth. The results
of analysis of some of these experiments are described
below.. Unlike the period—differential-worth measur-
ement, the reactivity determined from the rod-drop
experiment is quite insensitive to small errors in the

. initial and scram positions of the rods. The principal
new problem we had to consider was how to interpolate
the information from these two sets of experiments to

~ .other values of the initial critical rod position and 233U
~ ‘concentration to obtain the shape of the rod worth
curves. Although ‘we have not yet completed analysis of
all the rod-drop experiments that were performed, the

results of the latter should only be to provide certain
cross checks on, and information of secondary interest
to, the results set forth below.

4.2.1 Rod-Drop Experiments

The first set of experiments were performed after the
addition of capsule No. 23. This corresponded to very
nearly 30.78 kg of added uranium contained in the fuel
loop, or 33.50 kg of total uranium added to the salt
(including the drain tank residue). At these conditions
the critical position of the regulating rod at 1200°F was
approximately 41.8 in. with the pump off and 47.3 in.
with the pump on. In the ensuing description the
regulating rod will be designated as rod 1 and the shim
rods as rods 2 and 3.

As described in ref. 4, in these expenments the
integral count is measured starting with the reactor
critical a few seconds before the scram and ending
about 30 sec after the scram. The fission chamber is
positioned so that the initial count rate at the critical
condition is about 30,000 counts/sec. The attempt was
made to start each experiment at a neutron level
equivalent to about 50 w. Since it was impractical,
however, to try to obtain exactly the same count rate at
the time of rod scram in each experiment, for con-
venience in analysis we first renormalized the measured
counts for each case to correspond to an initial rate of
3 X 10 counts/sec. This should not introduce any error
since the system is linear in this range.

The results of the measurements and analyses for the
first set of experiments (designated as series A) are

38

shown in the bottom curve in Fig. 4.5 and in all curves
in Fig. 4.6. Figure 4.5, bottom curve, corresponds to
the scram of rod 1 from its initial critical position of
41.8 in. with the pump off. The circled points are the
normalized integral count data, and the curve is the
result of numerically integrating the reactor kinetics
equations in the manner described in ref. 4. The
magnitude of the negative reactivity inserted is used as
an adjustable parameter to obtain a close fit to the
measured count data. The average accelerations of rods
1 and 2 used for these analyses were 150 and 190
in./sec?, calculated from average drop-time measure-
ments made subsequent to termination of operation
with 235U, In addition, all analyses were normalized to
the values of the delayed neutron fractions given in
Table 4.2. These are effective values, which include
approximate evaluations of (1) the relative abundance
of 235U and 23°Pu in the fuel salt (source of data for
measured delay fractions for all fissile isotopes was ref.
5), (2) the relative energy effectiveness of delayed
neutrons in the reactor spectrum, ¢ and (3) calculated
importance-weighted reductions in delay fractions for
the conditions of steady fuel circulation.”

The data points for the top curves in Fig. 4.6
correspond to the normalized integral counts for shim

rod 2, scrammed from its upper limit of travel. The

pump was off, rod 3 remained set at 51 in.; and rod 1
remained at 41.35 in., its initial critical position for this
experiment. This case is of particular interest because,

~In order to better illustrate the sensmwty of this
measurement to the magnitude of the reactivity inser-
tion, in Fig. 4.6 we have shown two calculated curves
corresponding to —2.50 and —2.60% &k/k. These curves
closely bracket the count data, and we can assign a
reactivity insertion of —2.55 * 0.05% 8k/k as the

. “measured” reactivity. Therefore the relative sensitivity’

The effect of the slight shadowing perturbation
caused by rod 1 during the first 10 in, of fall of rod 2
can be estimated from results of rod-shadowing meas-
urements, to be described later in this section. This
correction is quite small and should increase the
measured reactivity magnitude by about 1%. Thus we
can assign 2.58 + 0.05% 8k/k as the total worth of a
single rod at the concentration of 232U obtaining in
this first set of experiments.

The bottom curves of Fig. 4.6 represent the data and
results of analysis for the same shim rod, taken with the
fuel circulating. As in the experiment with the pump
off, rod 2 was scrammed from its upper limit of travel.
Rod 3 remained set at its upper limit, and rod 1
remained at its critical position with the pump running,
47.32 in. The solid curves are the results of integrating
the kinetics equations for the same reactivity magni-
tudes shown in the top curves of Fig. 4.6, but with the
delayed neutron fractions for each precursor group
replaced by effective fractions calculated with the
theoretical model used previously for MSRE analysis
‘(Table 4.2). These results suggest that the calculated
losses in delayed neutron fraction due to circulation
may be slightly underestimated by the theoretical
model. The observed ' difference is rather small in
comparison with the total -effect, however, and we
concluded that the calculated delayed-neutron losses
are within 15% of the actual losses in the MSRE. (Note
that the presence of any entrained gas in the circulating

- fuel salt should not be significant in interpreting this
experiment, since these conditions would have re-
mained essentially constant throughout the experi-
ment.) :

The second set of experiments (series B) was per-
formed after 31.80 kg of uranium had been added to

 
 

 

 

the fuel loop. In this series we have completed only the
analysis of the experiment where rod 1 was dropped
from its new critical position at this loading (22.25 in.
with the pump stopped). These results are shown as the
top curve in Fig. 4.5. The negative reactivity obtained
from the analysis of this experiment was —1.10% 8k/k.
As will be shown below, the results in Fig. 4.5, together
with the total measured worth of one rod, provide
information sufficient for normalizing and interpolating
the rod-calibration measurements.

4.2.2 Reactivity Effect of Excess Uranium

Another calibration curve of special interest which is
derived from the zero-power experiments is the varia-
tion of excess reactivity with the uranium concentra-
tion. Each point on this curve corresponds to the excess
reactivity of the system if the rod were withdrawn from
its critical position to the upper limit of travel, at a
fixed uranium loading. This information is directly
applicable to the on-line reactivity balance calculations,
since the uranium is depleted and readded in the course
of operation. The curve is also of theoretical interest,
however, because the uranium additions without
compensating rod insertions represent a uniform varia-
tion in nuclear properties over the volume of the fuel
salt. Of the characteristics calculated in core physics
studies, this effect should be one of the most reliable,
whereas quantities depending directly on the calcu-
lation of the rod poisoning effect are probably the least
reliable. Therefore for this problem we have made use
of theoretical results concerning the shape of the
excess-uranium—reactivity curve to aid in interpolating
the experimental data described above. |

'By means of theoretical derivations and arguments
based on perturbation theory, one can arrive at the
following conclusions:

1. The variation in the excess reactmty p with 233y
loading for a fixed rod position is closely approxnnated
by the formula '

K(C - Co) K(M Mo)

 

N

p

where K is a constant, C and M are the concentration
and mass of 233U in the salt, and subscript O refers to
the values at the minimum critical loading. '

2. If a reactivity measurement is made which involves
the motion of the control rod away from its initial
critical position at some fixed uranium loading and we
wish to interpolate this measurement to another
uranium concentration, the factor expressing this rela-

40

C M o

tion is approximately proportional to the uranium
concentration:

80(Co) _ €.
230 G

 

(2

We first tested the accuracy of approximation (1) by
applying it in the case where an experimental curve was
attainable from independent measurements. This was
the 235U mass-vs-reactivity data determined by inte-
gration of period measurements and reported as Fig. 7
of ref. 4. We found that fitting the data by a theoretical
curve of the form (1) required only a very slight change
from the “empirical” curve reported in ref. 4.
~ Approximations (1) and (2) provide all the necessary
relationships to interpolate the rod calibration data for
the 233U loading. The value of My, the loading of the
fuel loop at the reference conditions for the initial
critical experiment, was 30.59 kg of uranium with
isotopic composition of the enriching salt. (Note: The
heel of 235U and 23°Pu remaining in the salt from the
2357 loading constitutes a base-line effect in all these
measurements and can be shown to have negligible
influence on the analysis following.) The approxima-
tions were applied as follows. From Eq. (2) the total
reactivity effect of one rod at a loading of 31.80 kg of
uranium is approximately

2.58(30.78/31.80) = 2.497% 5k/K .

Subtracting the rod-drop reactivity from the total rod
effect gives the excess uranium reactivity at 31.80 kg of
uranium:

excess U reactivity = 2.497 — 1.10= 1.397% 8k/k .

This result was then applied to generate the reactivity
curve corresponding to Eq (1),

pM__ _(0.01397X31.80)

K=
M-M, 31.80-30.59

=0.369 .

The curve of Eq. (1) based on these values of the
parameters K and M, is shown in Fig. 4.7.

These results may be cross-checked for consistency
with the rod-drop measurement given by the bottom
curve in Fig. 4.5, In this case the reactivity effect of
dropping the regulating rod from its critical position at

'30.78 kg of uranium was 2.35% &k/k. Then

excess U reactivity = 2.58 — 2.35 = 0.23% 8k/k

This is observed to be in close agreement with the value

The results inferred from the above analysis may also
be compared with the excess-uranium reactivity effect
obtained from theoretical analysis. Differentiation of

-The complete results shown in Fig. 4.8 constitute a

43

summary of the rod-calibration information, which -

includes the effects of partial insertions of the shim
rods. These additional results were obtained by the
following procedure. During the course of the uranium
additions, we performed several rod-shadowing experi-
ments, in which the change in critical position of the
regulating rod was measured as one shim rod and then
two banked shim rods were inserted. The procedure was
exactly the same as used in the ?3°U experiments
reported in ref. 4. Results of measurements carried out
at four different uranium concentrations are plotted in
Fig. 4.9. Here the ordinate and abscissa are the shim-
and regulating-rod positions, and each plotted point
represents a critical configuration of the rods. The
particular conditions for each expenment are also
indicated in the figure. A sequence of critical positions
taken at a fixed uranium concentration and tempera-
ture would represent a contour line of constant
reactivity relative to the reference condition if the
reactivity were being plotted in the dimension perpen-
dicular to the plane of Fig. 4.9.

The data ‘taken from the expenments in which the
two shim rods were moved in a bank is of .special
interest in application to the on-line reactivity-balance
calculations because this is the configuration used in the
operating reactor. This interest is emphasized in Fig. 4.9
by the smooth curves drawn through these data points.
The curves are terminated on the line of equal insertion
of the shim and regulating rods because the area to the
right of that line is the region in which the rods are
operated in the MSRE. From the earlier work w_1___th the
235( loading, we developed an analytical formula for
the rod reactivity variation with shim- and regulating-
rod insertion.” This formula contained adjustable
parameters which were fitted by least-squares analysis

analysis procedure described in. ref. 9 was applxed
without modification to the 233U experiments, with
the resulting least-squares curve fit shown in Fig. 4.8.
The triangled points in this figure are check points for
the least-squares formula, interpolated from the smooth
curves in Fig. 4.9. The least-squares formula provides a

to the measured data in the region of interest. The -

good fit to the measured data of Fig. 4.8 for most of

the range of rod travel but deviates somewhat from

range. The total regulating rod reactivity determined

'expected values near the upper and lower limits of the

from the formula is too large, and the curves probably

meet to “bend” more near - these hrmts (Tlus same

situation was encountered earlier in the 23*U meas-
urements.) These deviations should not constitute a
problem, however, for nommal operating procedures
keep the tips of the rods well away from these
extremes.

In sum, the essential information obtained from the
rod-calibration experiments is encompassed in Figs. 4.7
and 4.8 of the preceding description. This information
is currently being used in the on-line reactivity-balance
calculations, subject to possible future refinements
when the final analysis and evaluation of all the
zero-power physics experiments with 233U have been
completed.

4.3 CALCULATIONS OF REACTIVITY
VARIATIONS FROM POWER-TIME RECORDS

B.'E. Prince

~In the most common problems involving theoretical
analysis of reactor dynamics, the time dependence of
the neutron population or fission rate is determined,
corresponding to a specifi¢c perturbation in the reactor
properties or geometry. The inverse type of problem
arises, however, whenever one wishes to estimate the
nature of the original perturbation comesponding to an
observed transient in the neutron level. Recently,
observation of some small ripples, or “blips,” in the
power level recorded by the MSRE nuclear instruments
provided occasion for some computations of this type.
These blips were evidenced by temporary increases of
about 10% in the neutron level for various durations of
the order of several seconds, followed by a return to the
original level. They have lately been shown to disappear
when the flow is reduced slightly, and it is believed that
they are associated with the movement of gas in the
core (see Sect. '1.3.4). However, some calculations were
performed (1) to estimate the magnitude and time
dependence of the input-reactivity perturbations during
these blips, (2) to determine if - transients recorded
during well-separated intervals of time had any similar
features, and (3) to ‘help identify the mechanism
producing the reactivity changes. At this date these
calculations have been performed for only a few of the
blips, recorded during operation of the reactor at § Mw.
The results have indicated that only a small amount of
“input” -reactivity (about 0.01 to 0.02% 8k/k) was
involved in the production of these transients. However,
there do not appear to be any significant conclusions
which can be obtained from the time variation of the
reactivity, at least from the few cases we have analyzed.

As a basis for mathematical description of this
problem, we have used an integrodifferential equation

 
 

 

 

formulation of the neutron kinetics. This equation has
the form

where

F(t) = reactor power (Mw),

Py = power at time zero,

p; = delay fraction for precursors of ith group of

H(t) =a kernel function representing the “weight”

birth from fission, with radioactive decay

The net reactivity is also written as an integral form
governing the temperature feedback effects:

with

p;(f)=input reactivity from “external” pertur-

fuel salt and graphite respectively,

G, ('r) =kernel functions representing importance-
" weighted temperature changes in fuel and

44

graphite at time 7 caused by a unit change in
the heat production at time zero,

A, B =constants containing the heat capacities of
the fuel salt and graphite together with
spatial we1ght1ng factors.

The chief advantage of using the above formulation of
the kinetics equations in this problem is that it reduces
the approximations required to treat the transport-lag
effects between the production of new precursors or
heated salt and their influence on the chain reaction at
later times. A basic assumption in the present approach
is that the neutron population or fission rate can be
written as the product of an amplitude function A(f)
and a normalized time-independent function distributed
like the fundamental mode of the flux. One obtains the

- kernel functions H(r) and G(7) by first integrating the

distributed-parameter kinetics equations for the pre-
cursor concentrations and temperatures and then by
importance-weighting the solutions over the reactor
core.

A study of some of the computational aspects of this
general approach is still in progress and will be reported
at a later date. However, in the present application it
was possible to make several simplifying assumptions
while still retaining the main advantages of the method.
First, for the type of transients and time intervals we
were interested in, the temperature-reactivity feedback
due to graphite heating could be neglected. (Only a
small fraction of the heat is deposited directly in the
graphite, and the time constants for heat transfer are
large compared with the intervals of interest.) Second,
we approximated the flux and adjoint, or importance,
distributions in the MSRE by a product of a sinusoidal
function in the axial direction and a Bessel function in
the radial direction. In this way the spatial integrations
described above could be carried out analytically.
Finally, we restricted the time interval for the calcu-
lation to an upper limit of one fuel-loop transit time
(~25 sec) so that the core inlet temperature of the salt
could be assumed essentially constant and the details of
the thermal dynamics of the heat exchanger could be
neglected.

The resulting kernel functions used in the inverse
calculations of reactivity are shown in Fig. 4.10. The
functional dependence of H(7) is clearly in accord with
that suggested by intuition; at time zero a “pulse” of
new precursors is produced in the distribution of the
fundamental mode throughout the core, and the

~ importance-weighted value of this pulse is unity. As the

fluid containing these precursors leaves the core region,
their relative weight decreases to nearly zero after one

core transit time. (The approximate residence time in

the MSRE neutron flux, including weighted contribu-

tions of the upper and lower plenums, is about half the
loop transit time.) The weight function then rises again
as these precursors return to the core after traversing
the external circuit. Superimposed on this weight
function is the effect of radioactive decay of the
precursors, as shown in the last term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (1).

The approximate temperature kernel function Gg(7),
shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 4.10, also exhibits
qualitative features similar to those of H(7) during the

first half of the circulation cycle. Here, however, one

can show that it is appropriate to weight the spatial
variation with the product of the flux and adjoint
functions (the square of the flux in the present
approximation). This gives rise to a relative weight of

'1.33 rather than unity at time zero, and, in addition,

there is a radial weighting factor of 1 67 mcluded in the
constant 4 of Eq. (2).

The records of the time dependence of the power
level during the blips were obtained from digitized
values of the compensated-ionchamber currents, re-
corded every quarter-second by the BR-340 data logger.
For the purposes of this calculation the power level was

~assumed to vary linearly with time during these:

quarter-second intervals. The resulting transients corre-
-sponding to several blips recorded while the reactor was
operating at 5 Mw are shown in Fig. 4.11. In these

observations the reactor control was set on manual so.
that there would be no compensating motion of the
‘regulating rod during the transient. The sohd curves

consisting of broken-straight-line segments represent the
reactor power level, and the circled points are the

associated input-reactivity variations, calculated by use
of Egs. (1) and (2), together with the functions shown
in Fig. 4.10. In each case the starting point for the
calculation was chosen at the end of an interval where
the flux signal appeared relatively quiet, so that the net
reactivity at time zero was essentially nil.

As stated at the beginning of this section, no
significant conclusions concerning original “causes’ can’
be drawn from details of the time dependence of the
perturbations. The total magnitude of the reactivity
variation is quite small and within the magnitude which
could correspond to temporary pressure fluctuations
and movements of entrained gas in the fuel salt. (Note
that the reactivity in Fig. 4.11 is plotted in units of the
delay fraction comresponding to steady fuel circulation.)
The time intervals involved in the “rise” and “fall”
portions of the transients do not appear to be signifi-
cantly different, However, there are also smaller varia-
tions in the flux signal which have about the same slope
and could also be associated with gas-entrainment
effects. ‘

Because it has lately been shown that this entire
phenomenon is sensitive to the fuel flow rate and can
be removed by slight reductions in the flow, and also
because of the very small amount of reactivity variation
involved, we have temporarily discontinued further
calculations of the type shown in Fig. 4.11. These
studies will be resumed if future observations suggest
that it would be profitable to extend the analysis
further.

4.4 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF DYNAMICS
WITH 233U FUEL
R. C. Steffy

In the previous semiannual progress report,'® the
stability of the 333U-fueled MSRE was discussed. One
of the criteria by which the system was judged to be

~ inherently stable was the determination that the real

parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix of the mathe-
matical model'! of the system were all negative. The

" previously presented results only included a few eigen-

values nearest the origin for various power levels. A
continuation of this investigation has resulted in
determining the power dependence of all the eigen-
values. Figure 4.12 is a plot of the more important

eigenvalues and graphically shows their power depend-
ence. The tendency of the eigenvalues toward the
right-hand plane as power is reduced indicates that after
a power perturbation the MSRE will be more sluggish in
returning to its original state at lower power levels.

At zero power the eigenvalues of the nuclear kinetics

equations are all on the real axis, with the most
dominant eigenvalue being at the intersection of the
real and imaginary axes. This is typical for a zero-power -
reactor. Also observed in Fig. 4.12 is a set of eigen-
values which do not approach the real axis as power
level is increased. These imply that any temperature
disturbance in the loop would tend to “ring” around
the loop as it decayed. The dependence of these
eigenvalues on power is due to the power dependence
of the heat transfer coefficient of the radiator.

Part 2. MSBR Design and Development

 

 

The purpose of the MSBR design and development
activities is to prepare a reference design for a 1000 Mw
(electrical) one-fluid MSBR plant; to design a molten-
salt breeder experiment (MSBE), operation of which

will provide the data and experience necessary to build

large MSBR’s; and to develop the components and
systems for the MSBE,

Work on the reference design for the one-fluid MSBR
was begun in October 1967 and has taken most of the
effort. Prior progress is reported in our semiannual
reports for the periods ending in February and August
1968. The studies have converged on the design of
reactor core and vessel described in this report, and we
are now investigating some of the more important
details of the design. The flow and temperature
distributions in the reactor are being calculated, and
features required to attain the desired distributions are
being incorporated in the design. The distribution of
fission products in the reactor systems is being esti-
mated, and the results are being used to provide for
adequate removal of the decay heat.

One of the important features of the reactor is the
system for rapidly removing krypton and xenon by
contacting the circulating fuel salt with helium. Decay
of radioactive gases and their daughters results in a large
heat load in the off-gas system. Design of this system to
meet special requirements imposed by the distribution
of heating has also been started.

With the general design of the reference MSBR
reasonably well established, we have begun to look at
the MSBE. Calculations indicate that a reactor with a

48

R. B. Briggs

power level of 100 to 200 Mw (thermal) can satisfy the
requirements that have been proposed to date. An early
concept of the reactor is described here.

The amount of the experimental work in the develop-
ment program is small and is being limited to the most
important problems. Work is being done on methods
for dispersing bubbles of gas in and separating them
from circulating liquids. Preparations continue on
experiments to measure the coefficients for transfer of
dissolved gases to bubbles in circulating liquids. These
experiments are in support of the gaseous fission
product removal system.

Better values are being obtained for the thermal
conductivities of salts for use in heat transfer calcula-
tions. Experiments are in progress to confirm or
improve on the relationships used to calculate heat -

transfer coefficients for molten fluoride salts. The -

sodium fluoroborate—sodium fluoride eutectic salt has,
because of its low melting point and low cost, been
proposed for use in the intermediate coolant systems of
large molten-salt reactors. Since this is a new salt to the
MSR program, a forced convection loop is being
operated in engineering tests with the salt. Early
difficulties have been overcome, and the loop now
operates well. '

The equipment for the MSBE is to be designed and
built by industrial companies. We are presently pro-
ceeding with a plan for obtaining pumps and are
preparing a plan for obtaining steam generators from
industry.

5.1 GENERAL
E.S.Bettis R. C. Robertson

Design study of a 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR power
station is continuing. The basic design described in the
last semiannual progress report! remains unchanged,
but we have made several revisions as a result of more
detailed calculations having been completed in such
areas as the nuclear physics, stresses, temperatures, and
fluid flow. The design modifications have largely been
in the reactor internals, in the primary heat exchanger,
and in the containment cell wall structure.

- Afterheat removal has been more fully investigated. A

listing of the design criteria has been made, and the cost

estimate has been revised to reflect the design changes
and escalation of costs.

The fuel and coolant salt physical properties used in
the design study have been previously reported® and
remain unchanged except that the thermal conductivity
of the fuel salt is now established to be more nearly
0.75Btuhr! ft? CF)7!.

The general layout of the plant, deséribed prre-r
viously,! remains essentially unchanged (Figs. 5.1 and
5.2). As before, the reactor cell contains the reactor,

four fuel-salt circulating pumps, and four primary heat
exchangers. We have, however, increased the diameter
of the reactor cell from 60 ft to 66 ft to accommodate
a larger reactor vessel and additional th]ckness of

. thermal insulation. .

 

M. W. Rosenthal et al., MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept.
Aug. 31, 1968, ORNL4344.

We have reviewed the reactor cell wall construction in
some detail. The design must take into account that the
wall furnishes biological shielding, insulates against heat
losses, provides double containment for the radioactive
systems, and is the support structure for all major
equipment in the reactor primary system. The cell is
being designed for a pressure of about 50 psia;
leak-tightness and other characteristics must satisfy the
requirements for class B vessels,? concrete temperatures
must be limited to less than 150°F, and dimensional
changes due to thermal expansions must be accommo-
dated. As a result of the review we have made some
minor changes in the cell wall construction.

The reinforced concrete biological shielding is a
minimum of 8 ft thick. Its maximum temperature is
limited to less than 150°F by thermal insulation,
gamma shielding, and a circulating-gas heat-removal
system. The shielding is provided by the walls of inner
and outer carbon steel vessels, which also furnish
double containment for the fuel-salt system. Both
vessels are designed for SO psia, and about a 6-in.-wide
annular space separates the 2-in.-thick walls. Nitrogen
gas at essentially atmospheric pressure will flow through
this space in a closed circulating system to remove a

total of 0.5 Mw (thermal) of heat. The annular space

will also be used for leak detection.
A 9-in. thickness of insulating firebrick is used inside
the inner vessel as thermal insulation. Expansion joints

- are provided in the insulation to allow it to move with

* the vessel during temperature changes. A thin liner of
‘stainless steel covers the inside of the firebrick to reflect

49

radiant heat, to protect the insulation from damage,
and to provide a smooth surface for the cell interior.
The reactor cell atmosphere will probably be nitro-

gen, normally operated at slightly below atmospheric - |

pressure and at a cell temperature of about 1000°F.

The ambient temperature in the cell is maintained by
energizing electric heaters when required. The heaters
are arranged in thimbles around the periphery of the
reactor cell and can be maintained without violating the
sealed containment. We expect that about 1 Mw of
heating capacity will be required.

52

As the cell is heated to operating temperature, the

inner wvessel is allowed to expand downward and
outward against spring supports. All penetrations of the
cell will be provided with double bellows seals to
accommodate relative piping movements, These joints
will be arranged for periodic testing and replacement if
required.

The biological shielding and double containment
protection is continued across the top of the cell.
Removable roof plugs are provided over all equipment
that might require maintenance. The plugs are arranged

in two layers, each 4 ft thick, and in such a manner that

they can be replaced with a work shield for performing
remote maintenance or, for replacement of core
graphite, with a track-mounted transport cask and
integral crane.

As shown in Fig. 5.1 the four steam-generating cells,

~ the fuel processing cell, and the cell for storage of a

spent reactor core are arranged around the centrally
located reactor cell. The building housing the reactor
cell complex is a sealed structure with a controlled
ventilating system. This confinement provides an addi-
tional barrier to the escape of airborne activity. This
barrier is particularly needed during maintenance
operations. _

We have also made some minor revisions to the
flowsheet for the plant (see Fig. 5.3). The most
important change is that the off-gas holdup tank is now
cooled by a water system rather than a circulating salt
loop. Design of the off-gas system is discussed in Sect.
7.1.

As the physical size of a molten-salt reactor of a given
thermal output is increased over an optimum size, the
nuclear performance decreases and the useful life of the
graphite moderator and reflector is lengthened. Hereto-
fore, optimum nuclear performance was a basic design
requirement for the MSBR, and as a result the life of

the core graphite in an optimized 1000 Mw (electrical)
reactor was shown in the last semiannual report® to be
only 1.8 years. We have now studied the possibilities for
some tradeoffs in this regard. The details of the studies
of the effects of reactor core size on nuclear perform-
ance are reported in Sect. 6.1 and are discussed here
only with regard to changes in the mechanical design of
the 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR.

We found that if the size of the central region of the
reactor core were increased from about 11 ft diam X 11
ft high, as previously reported,! to 14 ft diam X 13 ft
high and axial reflector regions were added, the fuel
conservation coefficient would be decreased by only a
few percent but the estimated life of the core graphite
would be doubled. In addition, increasing the thickness
of the undermoderated outer zone of the core to
slightly more than optimum would reduce the damage
neutron flux incident on the inner face of the reflector
graphite to a maximum of 4 X 10'3 neutrons ¢m™
sec™ and thus assure that the reflector would normally
last the lifetime of the plant (30 years) without
requiring replacement. This would simplify the reactor
design in that the reflector graphite need not be
arranged with an ease of replacement similar to that
provided for routine maintenance of the core.

When the computer input parameters were adjusted
to provide a configuration with a 4-year life for the core
graphite and a 30-year life for the reflector graphite, the
results suggested that changes in some of the internals
would improve the design of the reactor. The tradeoff
studies indicated the importance of keeping the volume
fraction of salt in the reflector low. They also showed
that absorption of neutrons in the !35Xe that could
diffuse into graphite of high gas permeability in the
reflector region would be too small to have much effect
on the reactor performance. Allowing the gas permea-
bility to be high considerably increases the size of
graphite piece that can be manufactured, so this finding
opened the way to use of large graphite pieces in the
reflector. On the basis of these studies the design of the
reactor was changed in several respects. The perform-
ance values and principal data based on the new reactor
dimensions are given in Table 5.1, and the design
changes are discussed below. '

The central core region, designated zone I, is assem-
bled from 15-ft-long graphite elements 4 X 4 in. in cross
section as before. A hole through the center of each
element and ridges on each side separate the pieces to
furnish flow passages for the salt and provide 13 vol %
of salt in the most active portion of the core. The
elements are maintained in a compact octagonal array,
as shown in Figs. 5.4 and 3.5.
 

 

53

QOutside the more active core ‘regio'n' there is an
undermoderated region containing 37% by volume of
salt and designated as zone II. This region reduces the
fissioning, and therefore the neutron leakage from the
core, by increasing the fraction of absorptions in the
thorium. We reduced the thickness of the under-
moderated portion to 15 in., and rather than using
graphite spheres, we now provide 2-in. by 10-in. by
14-ft-long graphite slabs with flow passages between
them to provide the specified salt volume and for
cooling.

Between the undermoderated region and the reflector
graphite there is a 2-in.-wide annular space filled
entirely with fuel salt which accommodates relative

He SUPPLY

dimensional changes, provides clearance for removing
and replacing the reactor core assembly, and further
reduces the neutron leakage. The width of this space is
a compromise with the fuel-salt inventory.

The reflector region consists of 12- by 30- by
48-in.-high graphite blocks stacked around the remov-
able core assembly. As with the core elements, the
buoyant force of this graphite in the fuel salt is
normally restrained by the top head structure. When
the reactor is empty of salt, the weight is carried by the
lower head. There is a %, -in. annular clearance between
the reflector graphite and the vessel wall to permit an
upward flow of fuel salt to cool the wall and maintain it
below the design temperature of 1300°F. Hastelloy N

the bed plate which supports the reflector. Although
the space between the blocks will increase from about
0.05 in. to 0.1 in. as the system is heated, this
arrangement will assure essentially uniform spacing.
Hastelloy N rods also run vertically from top to bottom
of each stack of graphite reflector blocks to provide
vertical alignment. These rods are not secured to the
vessel, however.

There is an undermoderated region at both the top
and bottom of the reactor core. The regions are formed
by molded extensions on each end of the core elements
that provide a salt-to-graphite volume ratio of about
0.37. The extensions also allow orificing to obtain the
desired flow distribution through the core. By varying
the salt velocity from about 8.5 fps at the center to
about 2 fps near the periphery, a temperature rise of
about 250°F can be attained in all flow channels.

The nuclear calculations indicated that axial reflectors
would improve the reactor performance sufficiently to
warrant including them in the design. The reflectors
would also provide thermal shields to protect the
Hastelloy N heads from radiation damage. The axial -
reflector graphite pieces are molded in the form of
wedges. They are supported at each end and spaced so
that at operating temperature there is about 0.1 in.
between them. Holes are provided in the bottom
support plate for salt circulation through the bottom
axial reflector. The top reflector is cooled by a salt
stream that flows upward through the eight 3-in.-diam
holes that are provided in the undermoderated region
(zone II) for insertion of lifting rods when the core
graphite is to be replaced. The fuel salt flows between
the top graphite reflector wedges and the head of the
vessel and then exits with the bulk of the fuel salt
leaving the reactor.

. The above-mentioned lifting rods are different from

the permanently installed rods shown in previous
concepts. Eight seal-welded ports are now provided in
the top head of the reactor vessel through which the

temporary lifting rods can be inserted prior to the

lifting operation. The 2%-in.-diam rods engage the

- bottom lifting plate by a ball latch which is actuated by

a push rod passing upward through each lifting rod.
After the rods are engaged they are also attached to the
top head so that the entire core can be removed as an
assembly. The new arrangement removes Hastelloy N
from the periphery of zone II of the core region during
reactor operation, where it acted as a -nuclear poison,
and also eliminates the possibility of radiation em-
brittlement of the lifting rods.

5.4 PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGERS

C. E. Bettis H. A. Nelms
H. A.McLain H.L.Watts

The basic design concept for the primary heat
exchangers remains unchanged since the last semiannual
report. Completion of stress calculations and con-
sideration of problems associated with the baffles,
however, led us to revise the upper tube-sheet arrange-
ment. This led to changes in the configuration of the
upper head.

A cross section of the revised heat exchanger design is
shown in Fig. 5.6, and principal data are given in Table
5.2 '

The %-in.-OD by 22-ft-long tubes are assumed to
have spiral grooving to improve the heat transfer and
thus reduce the tube-side volume of fuel salt inventory
in the exchanger. To reduce tubing stresses, the revised
design has shallow sine-wave bends in the upper portion
of the tubes, which are bent 90° at the top into an L
shape. Rather than the horizontal tube sheet previously
used, the tubes are now welded into a cylindrical
vertical tube sheet at the top of the exchanger. This
arrangement permits a thinner tube sheet than if a flat
head were used and also allows the top head seal weld
to be located in a cooler region and be more readily

“accessible at the top of the exchanger.

The upper portion of the tubing containing the bends
is not grooved. Since baffling is also not employed in
the bent-tube region, the top 5.5 ft of the bundle
experiences parallel flow, and the overall heat transfer
performance is not as good as previously reported. An
0.8 baffle leakage factor was applied to the heat

was used in the pressure drop estimates. As in the
previous heat transfer studies, the spiral grooving on the
tubes was assumed to enhance the heat transfer
coefficient by a factor of 2 on the inside of the tubes
and by a factor of 1.3 on the outside. Corresponding

pressure drops were increased by these same factors. In -

revising the design the same number of tubes and the
same shell diameter were assumed. This may require

some small adjustment when the circumferential and

radial pitches for the tube layout are studied more
closely. - '
As with the past straight-tube design, the tube bundle

is arranged for removal and replacement in the unlikely

event of tube leakage. The concentric cooling salt
piping U at the top can be removed, the top clamp on

- the shell loosened and set aside, the seal weld ground

away, and the bundle withdrawn. All these operations
must be performed with remotely operated tooling.

A computer program was written to optimize the
straight-tube heat exchanger design to obtain the
minimum tube-side (fuel salt) volume within the pres-
sure drop limitation of 130 psi prescribed by the
hydraulic head delivered by the primary-salt pump.
After adoption of the bent-tube design, hand calcula-
tions have been used, with the machine calculations as a
reference, until the computer program can be revised to

-accommodate the new design.

5.5 STEAM GENERATOR AND SUPERHEATER

C. E. Bettis "W.C. Stoddard
-H. A.McLain H. L. Watts

The U-tube, U-shell horizontal steam generator
pictured in the last semiannual report! remains un-
changed in appearance, but the data have been slightly
revised due to use of more recent values of the physical
properties for the coolant salt and a change in the baffle
spacing. The revised data are given in Table 5.3.

The revised concept of the steam generator uses
constant baffle spacing throughout. There should be
little tendency for shell-side stratification. The need for
wire lacing or some other form of tube support to
minimize vibrations has not yet been fully explored.

the heat transfer and pressure drop estimates have been

are listed in Table 5.4.

This heat exchanger will probably not encounter
vibration problems, because the velocities are less than
6.5 fps and the tubes are supported by baffles on a
relatively close spacing.

5.7 REMOVAL OF REACTOR AFTERHEAT
W. K. Furlong

5.7.1 Introduction

The normal method of removing reactor afterheat is
to transfer it to the steam system by continuing
circulation of both the primary and secondary salts. In
the event of power failure, battery-operated pony
motors on the salt pumps will provide the required
circulation. Several abnormal situations would require
alternate means of afterheat removal, however. Ex-
amples are (1) major rupture of the primary system,
with subsequent rapid draining of the salt to the catch
basin; (2) a leak in the primary system such that
circulation by the pumps will eventually cease; (3) loss
of flow in more than one secondary loop; (4) mechani-
cal failure of all primary-salt pumps; and (5) failure of
the steam system. This section briefly discusses alter-
nate means of afterheat removal.

5.7.2 Sources of Afterheat

We identify the following five heat sources which
remain in the primary system after shutdown:

1. fission dﬁe to decay of flux at shutdown, including
the effect of delayed neutron precursor transport by
the salt, '

2. decay of fission products (and daughters) dispersed
in the primary salt,

3. decay of noble-metal fission products (and daugh-
ters) deposited on graphite and Hastelloy N surfaces,

4. decay of gaseous krypton and xenon (and daughters)
diffused into the graphite,

5. heat stored in moderator and reflector graphite.

The contribution from fission, aggravated by pump
coastdown, is shown in Fig. 5.7 for 23°U fuel and in
Fig. 8.3 for 233U fuel. The detailed analysis has been

DELAY IN INITIATING ROD MOTION (sec)

Fig. 5.7. Integral of Reactor Power at 300 sec After Start of
Primary Pump Coastdown vs Delay Between Initiation of Coast-
down and Insertion of Reactivity for 135y,

made by Sides.!**** Various combinations of magni-
tude and rate of reactivity insertion, salt flow change,
and delay prior to reactivity insertion have been
considered. As an example, the case of flow coastdown
with 1% negative reactivity inserted at 0.1%/sec after a
1.0-sec delay, with 235U fuel, would result in 3.75
Mwhr of energy production in the salt. Using only the
heat capacity of the salt, this would result in a 113°F
rise in salt temperature. In practice, the core heat
capacity, which is twice that of the salt, would become
available after the salt reached 1200°F (average initial
temperature is 1175°F for salt and 1200°F for core
graphite). The net effect would be a rise to 1250°F, at
5 min after shutdown, for the salt-graphite system due
to the effect of fission heat production alone.

The distribution of fission products in the primary
system has been estimated by Briggs®*® and Kedl? and
is discussed in Sects. 5.8 and 7.2. Heat-generation rates

that the noble metals are either deposited immediately on
metal and graphite surfaces or enter the off-gas system immedi-
ately. In curves A, B, and D the afterheat includes that from
decay of the daughter products of the noble metals and gases.

listed above), (2) a core and vessel cooling system (for
sources 3 and 4), and (3) an off-gas cooling system. The
latter is discussed in Sect. 7.1 of this report.

The general concept of the drain tank and associated
cooling system has been previously reported.” A stack
150 ft high and 30 ft in diameter was mentioned, but
further analysis now indicates that a stack height of
about 50 ft with a 45-ft diameter is preferable. In
addition, the natural-circulation fluoroborate system
will now be made to be independent of the off-gas
coolant system because the latter may operate at much
lower temperatures. An independent study!® has
recently corroborated the feasibility of our proposed
natural-circulation system. A maximum drain tank wall
temperature of 1466°F was also previously reported.
Although a detailed analysis of transient témperature
and flow conditions remains to be completed, we are
confident that a temperature somewhat lower than this
value will result. Several alternative coolants, including
Hitec!! and water, have been suggested. Hitec has the
disadvantage of instability at temperatures on the order
of those expected. Water, in a two-phase system, has
some advantages, and it is planned to look further at
the use of this coolant. With the use of water, it would
be possible to unify the off-gas and drain tank cooling
systems.

Sources 3 and 4, listed in Sect. 5.7.2 above, affect the
reactor and the heat exchangers. The heat from the
noble metals deposited on the heat exchanger tubes
would be transferred to the steam system, using either
forced or natural circulation in the coolant loops.
Several means of removing the heat from the reactor
have been considered. One would be to maintain the
outer vessel surfaces at a relatively low temperature
(~1100°F) and transfer the energy by radiation
through the graphite region to the vessel. A rough
estimate of the resulting peak temperature has been

" made by Tallackson,'? and a revised version of those

results is shown in Fig. 5.9. The method used to
maintain the 1100°F surface temperature has not been
specified, but some suggestions include the use of a

gas-cooled shroud around the vessel, the use of cooled-

insulation to allow radiation and convection heat
transfer to the thermal shield cooling system.

A second method of reactor afterheat removal, and
the one which has received the greatest attention in the
past six months, is to circulate a heavy gas (argon or
nitrogen at about SO psia) with the primary-salt pumps
operated at 1200 rpm. The heat would be transferred
via the secondary system to the steam system. If any of
the coolant-salt pumps are not operable, natural circu-
lation will provide adequate flow. If the steam system is
not operable, the heat capacity of the secondary system
‘would be adequate for several hours. The speed of 1200
rpm is above the normal primary pump operating speed
but below the critical speed. The pumps would have a
separate set of windings for this purpose. To prevent
loss of circulating gas in the event of a crack in the
primary system and to reduce the stress on the vessel,
the reactor cell would be pressurized up to 50 psia.
Approximately 25,000 scf of either argon or nitrogen

~ would be required and could be stored in cylinders

outside the cell. A helium supply is provided for the
off-gas system, and it would have been desirable to also
use this for removal of afterheat. However, with the
gases in laminar flow, the low Reynolds number of the
light gas gives such a high friction factor that the
resulting “system characteristic intersects the pump
characteristics at an intolerably low flow. With argon or
nitrogen, however, a flow rate of 17,000 gpm per pump
is attained at 1200 rpm. With three of the four primary

" pumps operating at this speed, 7.7 Ib of gas per second

can be circulated through the reactor.internals.

concentrated). Results indicate that the temperature
rise can be held to about 100°F above the initial
temperature. The temperature-time history is shown in
Fig. 5.10. The initial conditions depend on a number of
factors, particularly those affecting fissions due to
delayed neutrons, source No. 1. Of specific importance
are the amount and rate of shutdown reactivity
insertion, the delay prior to reactivity insertion,
whether or not primary-salt flow is maintained during
shutdown, and, if flow is not maintained, the rate of
coastdown. In addition to the temperature of the
reactor internals when the gas is introduced and the
time allowance for thawing the drain valve, draining the
salt, introducing the gas, and possibly pressurizing the
cell, another important initial condition is the amount
of energy stored in the graphite reflector. Besides
considerations of graphite life, a major incentive to
reduce the reflector temperatures is thus to minimize
this stored energy. In present estimates the reflector
peak temperatures are on the order of those in the
moderator elements, thus minimizing this aspect of the
problem, and most reflector sections will now con-
tribute their heat capacity to that available inside the
reactor. Allowing 300 sec to thaw the freeze valve and
another 700 to completely drain the salt, and assuming
a shutdown such that energy is produced as shown in
Fig. 5.7 (with 1% reactivity at 0.1%/sec and a 1-sec
delay), the average initial graphite temperature inside
the reactor will be about 1300°F. The vessel and head,
not in contact with large masses of hot salt, will
normally be somewhat cooler than the graphite. In
summary, on the basis of the initial temperature and
temperature rise estimates, the hottest part of the
reactor when pressurized gas is used for cooling should
not exceed 1400°F under conditions where it is
necessary to rapidly drain the primary salt. Analysis of

5.8 DISTRIBUTION OF NOBLE-METAL FISSION
PRODUCTS AND THEIR DECAY HEAT

R.B.Briggs J.R. Tallackson

Data obtained from operation of the MSRE have
indicated that the fission products ranging from ele-
ment No. 41, niobium, through element 52, tellurium,
are reduced to the metallic state in the fuel salt. The
metal particles then deposit on metal and graphite
surfaces in the reactor and also appear in the off-gas.
The mechanism for transporting the particles to the
surfaces of metal, graphite, and bubbles of gas circu-
lating in the fuel has not been established, but the
particles are believed to be sufficiently small for the
transport to be similar to that of molecular species.!*
On the basis of this assumption, the mass transfer
coefficients for the metal particles would be propor-
tional to those that have already been calculated for
xenon and krypton.

The mass transfer coefficient for xenon, the fluid
velocity, and the surface area in each region of the
MSBR are shown in Table 5.5. The mass transfer
coefficient for metal particles is assumed to be the mass
transfer coefficient for xenon multiplied by a constant
that has a value less than 1. Under steady-state

conditions the metal particles in the primary system are
distributed between the surfaces of graphite, metal, and
bubbles in proportion to the products of the mass
transfer coefficients and the surface areas.

Particle transport to metal, graphite, and bubbles by
means of the assumed diffusion mechanism proceeds
much faster than particle removal by the chemical
processing system; therefore it was assumed that the
chemical processing system effects no reduction in
surface deposition. Assuming that once a particle
reaches a surface it remains there, we find that 10% of
the particles will deposit on graphite surfaces, 40% will
deposit on metal surfaces, and 50% will be discharged
with bubbles to the off-gas system.”

Use of this method to estimate the distribution of
metallic fission products in the MSRE gives results that
are reasonably consistent with the distribution based on

analysis of specimens from the core. Direct extrapola-

tion of data from the MSRE would lead to the
conclusion that less than 10% of the metallic particles
would deposit on the graphite in an MSBR and that the
distribution would be different for each of the metallic
elements. However, the MSRE data scatter consider-
ably, so it seems reasonable to use the estimates above
for MSBR design purposes. The results reported here
are for the design as it existed in November 1968 and
have not yet been adjusted to the current design. 7

The distributions shown above were used to estimate
afterheating® by noble-metal fission products in the
primary system. The distribution of, and heat produced
in the graphite by, fission product krypton and xenon is
discussed by Kedl in Sect. 7.2. In estimating heat
production after shutdown, it was assumed that the
jodine born in surface deposits after the salt has been
drained remains there. For safety analyses it should be
assumed that iodine born on surfaces escapes and must
be contained. '

Table 5.6 lists the principal noble-metal heat pro-
ducers and their heat productions as a function of
elapsed time after shutdown. Figure 5.8 includes curves
of afterheat generation in the primary system vs time
based on the distribution discussed above.

5.9 REACTOR TEMPERATURES, FLOWS,
AND HEAT TRANSFER

W.K.Furlong  H. A. McLain

5.9.1 Reactor Core

The basic approach in designing the MSBR core is to
regulate the fuel-salt flow through each flow channel to
achieve the desired 250°F temperature rise. Other

64

~

objectives that must be considered in wusing this
approach are that the fuel-salt inventory within the
reactor, the pressure drop due to flow, and the vessel
wall temperatures must all be kept to a minimum or
within allowable limits. Since radiation-induced damage
to the graphite is very sensitive to temperature, it is
particularly desirable that the graphite temperatures
be low in the regions of high damage neutron flux in
order to assure at least a four-year useful life for the
core moderator elements. The relationships between
graphite life, damage flux, and temperature are shown
in Fig. 5.11. It is also importarit that the radial reflector
graphite have a sufficiently low temperature to allow a
30-year estimated life, as explained in Sect. 5.3.

The radial distribution of the fission power densities
averaged over the total height of the core and axial
reflectors in the present MSBR concept is shown in Fig.
5.12. The discontinuity in the curve is between zone I,
having 13.2% salt volume, and zone 1I, having 37% salt
volume. The axial distribution of the fission power
density in zone I can be approximated closely by a
cosine having an extrapolated length of 8.1 ft.

Heat is also generated in the graphite by the gammas
produced in the core and by moderation of the
neutrons. Heat deposition rates for a core configuration
essentially the same as that of the present MSBR
concept are shown in Fig. 6.3. To adjust the heat
deposition rates of zones I and II of the reactor for the
different peak and average core power densities in the
two concepts, we assumed that five-sixths of the gamma

heating and all of the neutron slowing-down energy is
proportional to the local power density and that the
remaining one-sixth of the gamma heating is propor-
tional to the average power density in the core.

Several factors influence the shape of the core
moderator elements. Preliminary calculations indicated
that the elements should be on a 4-in.-square pitch. The
most rtecent physics calculations indicate that they
should be designed so that the volume fraction of salt in
zone I is 0.132 and in zone II is 0.37. To achieve the
relatively low cost of fabrication of the elements by
extrusion, the geometry should contain no radii of less
than % in. The central hole through the sticks should

- not be less than 0.6 in. in diameter to assure successful

deposition of the pyrolytic graphite coating used to

‘reduce the permeability to salt and xenon gas.

Cognizance must be taken of the movement of the
elements relative to each other with temperature- and
radiation-induced dimensional changes. _

‘As is evident in Fig. 5.12, the highest mass velocity of
fuel-salt flow is required at the center of the reactor. If
all the flow channels could have equal hydraulic
diameters, the pressure drop due to flow through the
core could be minimized, but the restriction on the
minimum size of the central hole in the elements,
mentioned above, dictates that the flow channels
between the adjacent elements have smaller hydraulic

diameters than the hole. The salt flow through the
central hole must then be restricted by orificing. On
this basis, the pressure drop of the salt flowing along
the center line of the reactor has been determined to be
about 18 psi. It can also be seen from Fig. 5.12 that the
farther an element is from the center line, the lower the
mass velocity of the salt must be to obtain the desired
250°F temperature rise in the salt moving upward
through the core. _

Two typical cross sections for the graphite moderator

elements are shown in Fig. 5.13. The central part of the
_core, zone IA, will be made up of elements of the type
~ shown in Fig. 5.13q, and those farther from the center,

zone IB, will have the cross section shown in Fig. 5.135.
The hydraulic diameters of the channels between
adjacent elements in zone IB are smaller than in zone
IA. Since it would not be practical to size the flow
passages between the elements at each radial distance

- from the center of the core to achieve an exact 250°F

temperature rise, the central holes will be orificed so
that the salt streams discharging from all these flow
channels associated with each element will combine
into- a mixture of the desired temperature. The cross
sections of the moderator elements for zone IIA of the
reactor are identical to those shown in Fig. 5.13b
except that the central hole diameter is 2.581 in.
instead of 1.347 in.

Experiments have been reported in which the flow
through channels formed by closely packed rods on a
triangular pitch is greater than that predicted by the

equivalent hydraulic diameter theory.!® Use of this-

concept for calculating the salt flow rates through the
MSBR core will therefore require verification and
further study, particularly in the passages formed by
the corners of four adjacent elements.

- As would be expected, the highest steady-state
graphite temperatures and the greatest irradiation to the
moderator graphite would occur at the reactor center
line. Calculations were made of the temperature distri-
~ bution through an element along the center line, both
at midheight of the core, where the salt is at an average
temperature of 1175°F, and in a plane about 1 ft
higher, where the salt is at 1200°F. The results are

shown in Fig. 5.14. They show that at midheight the -

maximum temperature is 1284°F and at 1 ft above
midelevation the temperature is 1307°F. Figure 5.14
also illustrates the importance of the central hole in the
moderator elements in maintaining the temperatures
within acceptable limits.

In making the calculations described above we
assumed that the heat transfer coefficient between the
graphite and the fuel salt could be predicted by the
Dittus-Boelter relationship, that the effect of volu-
metric heat sources on heat transfer between the
graphite and salt were negligible, and that there was no
transfer of heat between the graphite and the salt for a
distance of 0.1 in. on each side of the apex of the rib on
the outer edge of the moderator element. The latter
assumption is a first approximation of the fact that the
flow in this area is restricted. It also illustrates why the
ribs should be kept as narrow as possible. Calculations
were made by use of the Astra HEATING code, which
is ‘a relaxation heat conduction code that assumes
constant thermal conductivity of the materials. The
parameters used in these particular calculations are
listed in Table 5.7. .

Preliminary calculations indicate that vibration of the
moderator elements should not be a problem. The
magnitude of the vibrations was determined by extrapo-

lating known information about the amplitude of
vibrations with parallel flow'® and adding to this the
rod deflection due to cross flow of salt between the
channels. Assuming the velocity of the salt between
adjacent channels to be Y, fps and extrapolating
information on vibration due to cross-flow vortex
shedding,!? the sum of the two effects gives a total
calculated amplitude of vibration at the center line of
less than 0.002 in. Model tests will be required for
substantiation, but on this basis we believe that core
vibrations will not limit the design. _

In connection with the studies mentioned above, it
may be noted that a2 12- by 12-in. area has been
assigned for control rods in the center of the reactor.
The sait flow in this region may be in excess of that
needed to cool the rods in order to help bring sufficient
cool salt to the top axial reflector. Orificing of the flow
in this central region will also be required, to minimize
variations in the flow with control rod position. Studies
are continuing, and efforts will be made to determine if
there are any vibration problems associated with the
control rods. -

5.9.2 Flow and Temperatures in
Radial Reflector '

Determination of reflector temperatures is important
because of -their relationship to graphite life, amount
and temperature of coolant required, and stored energy
during afterheat removal. The relationship between life,
damage flux, and temperature is shown in Fig. 5.11.
For a given nuclear design there is a maximum
allowable temperature for any reflector section which is
intended to remain fixed in position for the design life
of the reactor. Conversely, a temperature distribution
calculated for given reflector geometry and coolant

 
 

 

 

conditions may dictate a reduction in the incident
damage flux, even though this entails a departure from
optimum nuclear conditions. (This compromise was
necessary in the present design, as discussed in Sect.
5.3) The amount and temperature of coolant are
interdependent. The major part of the coolant tempera-
ture rise is due to its own internal fission heating, and it
is desirable to have each unit volume of salt experience
the same plenum-to-plenum temperature rise. On the
other hand, the need for improved heat transfer
coefficients or lower sink temperatures may dictate a
higher flow rate than that required to attain this rise.

A reflector design using graphite blocks  averaging
about 1 ft* in size was rejected when analysis indicated
excessive temperatures. The principal cause was fission
heat from trapped interstitial salt. This heat had to be
transferred to a cooled surface by conduction, which
required large temperature gradients. A conclusion was
that regions of static salt must be avoided everywhere
within the reactor vessel. With the elimination of
internal fission heat, the sources in the reflectors would
consist only of photons leaking from adjacent blanket
regions and from neutron slowing down, as indicated in
Fig. 5.15.

The present radial reflector design, shown in Figs. 5.4
and 5.5, has been analyzed using the Astra HEATING
code, employing a three-dimensional relaxation tech-
nique with constant thermal conductivity. Boundary
temperatures were based on the fluid temperature
required at a given location for an overall 250°F rise
plus an increase in wall temperature from the volu-
metric heat source in the fluid. In most analyses
performed, the fission heating in the salt far exceeds the
heat transferred into it from the graphite. Hence the
- conduction problems have been treated with fixed
boundary conditions rather than having to couple the
salt and graphite by an energy balance. Heat transfer
coefficients were based on laminar flow between
graphite segments and between reflector and vessel, but
on turbulent flow at the reflector-blanket boundary in
the 2-in.-wide annular space between the reflector and
the removable core assembly. Results at the axial
. midplane are shown in Fig. 5.16. This is the location of
the peak damage flux, which has been constrained to
about 4 X 10'3 to achieve design life with the
calculated 1250°F surface temperature. The effect of
damage flux decrease with distance into the reflector
overrides the effect of increasing temperature on the
graphite life. Similarly, the axial decrease in damage
flux is sufficient to counteract the increasing surface
temperature, which reaches a peak several feet above
the midplane. '

68

Our studies indicate that to meet the heat-removal
requirements and the other objectives discussed above,
the flow of salt through the reflector graphite must be
in the radial direction rather than vertically upward, as
it is in the core. In large part this is due to the fact that
the thermal coefficient of expansion of Hastelloy N is
greater than that of the graphite. The reflector graphite
could be restrained into essentially its room-tempera-
ture geometry with little change in the flow channel
geometry, but the expanding vessel would draw away
from the reflector and increase the salt volume in the
annulus between the vessel wall and the graphite. This
would result in an undesirable increase in the primary-
salt inventory. We therefore decided to restrain the
reflector graphite to maintain its position relative to the
wall and let the flow passages in the graphite open up as
the system is brought up to temperature. With an
increase in the width of the flow channels in the
reflector graphite, axial flow passages for the reflector

cannot be defined. Connecting the reflector flow
passages, the annular space at the vessel wall, and the
annular space between the reflector and the removable
core to common plenums located at the upper and
lower ends of the reflector is not satisfactory. There
would be inadequate axial flow through the reflector if
the pressure difference was limited to the amount
necessary to get the desired temperature rise for the salt
flow through the annular space. On the other hand,
there would be excessive salt flow through the annular
spaces if this pressure difference was increased to get
the necessary flow through the reflector region. The use
of radial flow circumvented this design difficulty.

We decided to have the salt in the. reflector flow
inward toward the core in order to minimize the vessel
wall temperature and because of orificing considera-
tions. The annulus between the core and reflector is
orificed at the bottom because of mechanical assembly
considerations and because this annulus serves as the
collection plenum for the radial flow through the
reflector. Salt flow from the undermoderated region of
the core into the annulus is restricted by graphite rib
seals located between the graphite slabs in the under-
moderated region, zone II. Axial distribution of the
radial flow through the reflector is controlled by
orifices located at the inlets of the radial flow passages.
Analysis of flow in this region of the reactor is
continuing. | '

59.3 Flowand Témpératurés in
Axial Reflectors '

The axial reflectors are subjedted to a 66% higher

peak damage flux than the radial reflector. However, |
the lower one is replaced with the moderator, and the

upper one must last only half of design life due to the
alternate use of two heads. Hence temperature and
damage flux considerations are not as stringent as in the

Q@ (w/cm3 of graphite)

radial reflector. The uppér reflector was analyzed using
the Astra HEATING code. The axial behavior of the
source is shown in Fig. 5.17. The radial variation was
described by a cosine. The inner face is subjected to
1300°F salt. The other faces are in contact with
somewhat cooler salt which is transported from the
reactor inlet, via the control region and lifting rod
tubes, to provide a low-temperature sink for the vessel
head. On the above basis, the peak temperature was
found to be 1363°F, and the surface temperature in the
region of peak damage flux is 1265°F. This corresponds
to a 20-year graphite life. The lower reflector graphite is
cooled on all faces by salt at a temperature only slightly
above inlet conditions. This results in a peak tempera-
ture in the lower reflector of 1165°F.

“A flow of fuel salt is provided for cooling the axial
reflectors in much the same manner as for the radial
reflector graphite. The flow through the lower axial
reflector will be upward, while that through the upper
axial reflector will be downward. The salt for the lower
reflector is taken from the reactor inlet flow, and it is
used to cool the lower head of the vessel and the
graphite support plate as well as the axial reflector
graphite. The fuel salt for cooling the top head and
graphite is brought upward through the control rod
region at the center and through the core lifting rod
holes in zone II, previously mentioned. This relatively

cool salt is used to remove the heat deposited in the
upper head and in the upper axial reflector graphite.

5.9.4 Vessel Temperatures

Analysis of the 2-in.-thick vessel wall indicates a peak
temperature of 1154°F, occurring at the outer surface
at the axial midplane. No credit was taken for heat
transfer from the outer vessel surface to the primary
cell. A constant salt temperature of 1100°F was used in
the vessel wall coolant passage. The basis for this is the
very low fission density in the passage. Hence, with
radial flow in the reflector and with the flow rate sized
to give an overall 250°F rise, most of the salt
temperature rise will occur over the inner few inches of
the reflector and in the annulus between the reflector
and core zone II. The effect of gamma radiation from
the heat exchangers on vessel temperature has not been
included. Locally hot areas of the vessel and heads, such
as the region around the outlet nozzles and other areas
bathed by 1300°F salt, have not been analyzed.
Temperatures within a few degrees of the salt tempera-
tures are to be expected in these regions. If the
calculated stress intensities are too high, a method of
shielding the surfaces from the hot salt may be
required.

Analysis of the 3-in.-thick upper head indicates that

temperatures are on the order of 1120 to 1180°F along
the outer surface. This is based on an 1100°F salt
temperature on the inner face. At the junction of the
hemispherical and cylindrical sections, there is a small
region where temperatures approach 1300°F due to the
contact with hot salt on the inner surface. This region
also coincides with the location of maximum stress
intensity and is therefore of concern. Analyses of
modified head designs which will result in lower stress
values are presently in progress.

The lower head has a reduced incident gamma flux
due to the shielding provided by the lifting plate and
other structure. It is cooled by salt at inlet conditions,
and the combination of these two factors yields
maximum temperatures less than 1100° F. Because it is
larger in diameter than the upper head, is of different
geometry, and must withstand a higher pressure, the
lower head has a maximum stress intensity about twice
that of the upper head. This occurs at the junction with
the cylindrical wall section. Present stress analysis
indicates that, with the temperatures calculated, this
maximum is allowable by a small margin. Stress analysis
is continuing, and additional results will be reported in
the future.

5.10 ESTIMATED COSTS OF 1000
Mw (ELECTRICAL) MSBR POWER STATION

R. C. Robertson

The last published cost estimate for a 1000 Mw
(electrical) MSBR power station was in the fall of
1968.1®% We have revised this estimate to more nearly
represent early 1969 conditions. The total estimated
construction cost is given in Table.5.8 and the power
generation cost in Table 5.9. The cost of the chemical
processing plant is not included in the capital costs
given in Table 5.8; it is added into the fuel cycle cost in

Table 5.9.

because of an average escalation of costs of about 5%
since the late 1968 estimate and because the conceptual

design of the reactor also increased in size. The

combined effect is for the reactor (plus associated .

indirect costs) to cost about $5 million more than in
the previous estimate.

Other important cost increases are due to the in-
clusion of the effect of a 54-hr work week and adding a
3% sales tax charge. The first of these increased the
construction cost by about $6.5 million and the latter
by about $3.5 million.

The estimated costs given here are based on the 1969

value of the dollar and therefore do not include a factor

for escalation of prices during a construction period.
This is a very substantial expense item that must be
added to the construction cost of a plant. It can
amount to about 14.5% additional cost, or around $20
million for an MSBR, for a five-year construction
period, if escalation continues at the present rate of
more than 4%/year.

costs of a PWR station'? estimated under the same set
of ground rules used for the MSBR. Whereas the
molten-salt reactor included relatively large allowances
for the drain tanks and maintenance equipment, this is
offset by savings of about $17 million over the
light-water reactors for the heat-power system equip-
ment as a result of using high-pressure, high-tempera-
ture steam. On the basis of these estimates we believe
that the construction costs of an MSBR station and a
light-water reactor station would not be greatly
different. ,

The estimated power production costs given in Table
5.9 assume a fixed charge for capital for a privately
owned plant of 13.7%. The cost of replacing the
graphite every four years is included as a production
expense, as is the interest on the cost of the capital set
aside to cover future replacements. As shown, the
favorable power cost of an MSBR is largely due to the
low fuel cycle cost.

5.11 MSBE DESIGN

J.R.McWherter C.W.Collins W. Terry

5.11.1 Introduction

Some conceptual design studies were initiated on the
Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE). Some of the
objectives follow:

1. The plant shall be a facility for testing materials,

‘components, systems, and methods at conditions as

near those of the MSBR as practical.
2. The reactor shall have the capability for exposing

- segments of proposed fullsize MSBR core graphite

An important assumption in makmg MSBR cost -

estimates is that the costs apply to an established
‘molten-salt reactor industry. This is to say that there is
~ a proven design, development costs have largely been
absorbed, and the manufacture of materials, plant
construction, and licensing have become routine.

About one-half of the total cost is for more con-
ventional parts of the plant, such as structures, turbine-

‘elements at a fast (>50 kev) neutron flux of 5 X 10'*

neutrons c¢m "2 sec™!

to 1300°F.
3. The primary- and secondary-salt compositions

in primary salt at temperatures up

* shall be essentially the same as proposed for the

generators, and associated equipment, and these costs '_

are relatively well established. The reactor costs are less
certain because of the preliminary nature of the
conceptual design and use of Hastelloy N and special
graphite for which there is limited expenence in
large-scale production.

We feel that the estimated MSBR costs have more
relevancy if they are used on a comparative basis rather
than as absolute values. Table 5.8 therefore includes the

single-fluid MSBR. Differences. should be limited to
those which would not significantly alter the chermcal

. or physncal properties of the salts.

. The design power level for the reactor shall be in
the range of 100 to 200 Mw (thermal). A conversion
ratio near 1.0 is desirable but not essential.

5. The design of the plant should be similar to that
proposed for the MSBR. Where practical, the MSBE
primary system components shall be similar in design to

5.11.2 Description of Reactor Plant

The core configuration under study will meet the
above requirements at a power level of 170 Mw
(thermal) (see Sect. 6.2 for physics analysis). It consists
of a large number of 4-in.-square graphite bars arranged
vertically in a 4-ft-diam assembly. The middle section of
the bars is 5 ft long and has 20% of its nominal cross
sectional area open for salt flow. There are 1% -ft-long
axial extensions at each end with the cross section
reduced so that the salt occupies 70% of the end
regions. This assembly is contained in an 8%-ft-diam
spherical vessel with the radial region between the 4-ft
cylindrical array and the vessel completely filled with
salt.

A vertical section through the reactor core is shown in
Fig. 5.18. Primary salt (71.5 mole % LiF, 16 mole %
BeF,, 12 mole % ThF,, 0.5 mole % UF,) enters the
bottom of the reactor vessel and flows through the core
as indicated schematically in the figure. No hydraulic
analyses of the core have been made. Four control rods

 

74

with magnetic drives are indicated, although the control
rod requirements have not been determined. A 6% -ft-
diam extension at the top of the vessel with a
removable vessel top head is proposed. This arrange-
ment would permit removal of all the graphite, which is
positioned by a lower structure supported by rods

attached to the vessel top head. The four central -

graphite bars can also be removed independently
through a central access opening in the top head.

The graphite arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.19, a
horizontal section of the core. The outer elements will
be fixed in position at top and bottom, but the
tongue-and-groove joints in the outer elements will
permit some circumferential movement without ex-
cessive cross flow through the gap.

A conceptual floor plan of the reactor building is
shown in Fig. 5.20. There are separate cells for the
primary-salt components, the secondary-salt steam
generators, the off-gas processing system, and chemical
processing plant. A hot cell for dismantling and
evaluation of radioactive components will be provided.
All of these cells will be housed in a concrete building
with an overhead crane.

Maintenance procedures are incomplete, but it is
assumed that a shielded carrier on rails with a closed

6.1 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR
6.1.1 Optimization of the MSBR

H. F. Bauman

The main factors considered in the optimization of
MSBR nuclear designs have been, for some years, the
fuel-cycle cost and the annual yield (fractional increase)
of bred fuel. However, it has been recognized for some
time that the fuel yield (or its inverse, the doubling

time) does not fully take into account the influence of

fuel specific power in determining the overall amount
of natural uranium that will be required to supply an
expanding nuclear power economy. It can easily be
shown, for a linearly increasing power demand, that the
required cumulative input of fissile material into the
system, up to the time when the system becomes
self-sustaining, varies inversely as GS?, where G is the
breeding gain (breeding ratio minus 1) and S is the
specific power in terms of the entire fuel inventory
chargeable to the system. :

No responsible projections of nuclear power capacity,
of course, indicate a linear increase at any time within
the next few decades. We observe, however, in compar-

ing the resource requirements for various postulated

reactor characteristics (i.e., inventory and doubling
time) that the product GS? gives a better indication of
the fuel input requirements than does the doubling time
or yield (which is proportional to GS). The quantity
100GS?, [Mw (thermal)/kg]?, we have called the fuel
“conservation coefficient.” .

In view of these considerations we have modified the
figure of merit used in optimizing MSBR designs to
allow, optionally, the achievement of maximum con-
servation coefficient rather than maximum yield or
maximum breeding ratio; we have used this option in all
of our recent calculations. Indeed, the breeding ratio
that results from optimizing an MSBR with respect to
the conservation coefficient is typically about 0.01

lower than results from optimizing for yield, but the '/

76

fuel inventory is also lower. That is, if a reactor
optimized for yield has a breeding ratio of 1.07, the
modified reactor, reoptimized for the conservation
coefficient, would have a breeding ratio closer to 1.06
but would still be judged the better reactor in terms of

- the objectives of breeding.

The objective function of the ROD! optimization is
in the form of a polynomial. This allows great flex-
ibility in the selection of factors which will influence
the optimum; new terms can be added easily, while
terms that are no longer being used can be given zero
coefficients. Two terms are employed in the current
optimizations: the conservation  coefficient, already
defined, with a weighting factor of 10, and the damage
flux factor, with a weighting of 1. The damage flux
factor is computed by ROD as follows. The maximum
group 1 (fast) flux is selected by scanning the core. If
this flux does not exceed a preselected input flux, the
flux factor is 0. If the input flux is exceeded, the
difference is divided by 10'%, then squared, and
multiplied by —1. This gives a term which subtracts
from the objective function when the damage flux
exceeds the desired value. The use of the flux factor not
only permits the user to investigate designs with a
predetermined core life, but also tends to drive the
optimization toward designs with a low peak fast flux.

The convergence requirement on the ROD calculation
is particularly stringent when ROD is used for optimiza-
tion. The “derivative” calculations, which determine
the direction in which the optimization proceeds, are
based on a pair of ROD cases which differ by a small
increment in the value of the variable considered. Small
convergence errors which would be negligible in indi-
vidual cases can cause serious errors in the derivatives.
The convergence of the diffusion calculation in ROD
has been particularly slow and difficult since multiple

77

thermal groups with slow-neutron upscatter have been
introduced. An upscatter convergence acceleration tech-
nique has been adapted for use in ROD and has helped
to obtain adequate convergence in a reasonable time.
There are still ROD cases that run for several hundred
iterations, however, and other convergence acceleration
methods are being investigated.

The nuclear design studies of the one-fluid MSBR are
continuing; however, enough has been learned about
the characteristics of the one-fluid system to permit the
selection of a reference design which will be the basis of
a forthcoming design report. The important data for the
reference design are given in Table 6.1. Some of the

studies which led to the selection of the reference

design are presented in the following section. The
performance figures are somewhat higher in the prelimi-
nary studies than in the reference design, mainly
because the studies were based on an assumed value for
the fuel salt inventory, external to the regions being
optimized, that proved to be somewhat low.

The reference design has been modified slightly from
the optimum design based solely on the conservation
coefficient. The conservation coefficient could, in fact,
be about 10% higher than that of the reference design.
The benefits of the following three modifications were
considered to balance this decrease in performance.

The first modification is the extension of the core
life. The core was made larger and with a flatter flux,
increasing the nominal graphite life from the optimum
of 2.4 years to about 4 years. As will be shown in the
following section, this costs very little in nuclear
performance and should have significant economic
advantages.

Second, the reflector thicknesses are less than opti-
mum by about a foot, to reduce the size and capital
cost of the reactor vessel.

Third, the thickness of radial core zone 2 was
increased by about 6 in. to reduce the fast flux at the
face of the reflector. This gives a nominal reflector life
of 30 years and eliminates the need for scheduled
replacement of the reflector.

6.1.3 Nuclear Design Studies
H.F. Bauman

The reflector has two impo_rtant effects in the
one-fluid MSBR design, namely, the reduction in

neutron leakage and the flattening of the power
distribution. The power-flattening effect is particularly
important since it can extend the core graphite life
without any sacrifice in average power density or
specific inventory.

The effect of the radial reflector thickness on the
MSBR performance is shown in Fig. 6.1. (The effect of
axial reflector thickness is similar but, as would be
expected from the geometry, about half as great.) The
reactor design was similar to the reference MSBR

except that a peak power density corresponding to a

2.25-year core life and a somewhat smaller external
inventory of salt were assumed. The reactor perform-
ance improves markedly with reflector thickness out to
about 3 ft and then begins to level off.

Figure 6.1 also shows the effect of the salt fraction in
core zone 2 for two cases: all salt and 37% salt, which is

the salt fraction corresponding to a random-packed bed

of spheres. The zone thickness was allowed to optimize
in each case. The 37% salt case is clearly superior,
although the effect is rather small considering the large
difference in salt fraction.

The effect of the reflector salt fraction on the reactor
performance was mvestlgated in the series of cases given

in Table 6.2. These cases are very similar to the

reference design except that a lower external inventory
of salt was assumed. A case with no reflector is included
for comparison.

The effect of salt in the reﬂector is to increase the
neutron leakage and the fissile inventory, both of which
decrease the performance. The reactor performance is
most sensitive at very low reflector salt fraction, rising
sharply as zero salt fraction is approached. For the
designer this implies that the more successful he is in

reducing the reflector salt fraction, the greater the
incentive becomes for further reduction. Notice, how-
ever, that even in the case with as much as 4% salt in
the reflector, the performance was much better than in

‘the no-reflector case. Power peaking was particularly

severe in the no-reflector case.

The reflected reactor has the disadvantage of a
secondary power peak at the core-reflector interface.
An analysis of the temperature and damage flux in this
region for an optimum case indicated that the expected
life of the graphite near this interface might be about
half the desired 30 years. While it is possible to design
the reflector so that the graphite could be replaced at
infrequent intervals, it seemed desirable to avoid such a
major remote maintenance requirement. It was noted
that the flux at the reflector face was quite sensitive to
the thickness of zone 2 (and the annulus). The
thickness of zone 2 was increased to 1.25 ft in the
reference design in order to achieve a pominal reflector
life of 30 years.

The effect of xenon in a typical reflector was also
studied. It was shown that xenon at an atom density of
9 X 10712 atoms barn™! ¢cm™, the estimated reflector
concentration in a graphite with no resistance to xenon
diffusion, had a negligible effect on the performance of
the reactor (i.c., about a 1% decrease in the conserva-

“tion coefficient). The effect on the damage flux in the

reflector was also negligible. It was shown that about
half the neutrons absorbed in xenon in the reflector
would have been lost as increased leakage had the
xenon not been present.

The absence of a significant effect of xenon in the
reflector may have an appreciable indirect effect on the
reactor performance. Since the reflector graphite need
not be impermeable to gases, it can be manufactured in
larger blocks, permitting a lower salt fraction in the
reflector. .

The possible effects of flux shaping on the perform-
ance of the MSBR were also studied. The flux-factor
technique described in Sect. 6.1.1 was used to restrain
the peak flux in the ROD optimization in the series of
cases given in Table 6.3. In these three cases in spherical
geometry, the first was run with no restraint on the
damage flux and the next two with increasing restraint
on the damage flux. The results showed that a
considerable improvement in the graphite life could be
obtained with only a minor decrease in the reactor
performance. |

These results were so encouragmg that a similar peak
flux restraint ‘was applied to subsequent cases in
cylindrical geometry, including the reference design and
the cases in Table 6.2. The reactor fissile inventory is

6.1.4 Optimum Thorium Concentration in MSBR
W.R.Cobb

Calculations to determine the optimum ThF, mole
fraction in the fuel salt of a single-fluid MSBR were
previously reported.? Changes in the reactor design, in
the BeF, mole fraction in the salt, and improvements in
the computational methods have prompted a reexami-

nation of the question. The previously reported results
were suspect because of the known limitations of the
code OPTIMERC? and because the same cross sections
were used for every salt considered.

In the series of calculations described below, the code
ROD, an improved version of OPTIMERC, was used to

(mole % LiF-BeF;-ThF,). The starting point for these
three optimizations was an MSBR configuration very
similar to the present reference design, but with a
two-year graphite life. Each reactor was optimized with
respect to five variables: core height, core radius, axial
blanket thickness, radial blanket thickness, and core salt
volume fraction. The optimum core salt volume frac-

" tions and the comresponding equilibrium nuclide con-

centrations for each reactor were then used to generate
new cross sections appropriate for each case. For each
reactor considered, three sets of cross sections were
used, one each for the core, blanket, and plenum
regions. The three reactors were then reoptimized using
their respective cross sections, the starting estimates for

- the five variables being the results of the previous

optimization. This procedure was continued until the
differences between values of the optimized variables in
two successive optimizations were less than 2%.
Characteristics of the three optimum designs are
summarized in Table 6.4. Some quantities of interest
are shown in Fig. 6.2. The breeding gain increases with

increasing thorium (and hence fuel) concentration, over
the range shown, primarily because of reduced parasitic
neutron captures in the salt and in the moderator. This
increase is achieved, of course, at the expense of a larger
fuel inventory. The yield also increases, but more
slowly than the breeding gain, because of the increase in
fuel inventory.

The conservation coefficient? first increases because
the breeding gain increases faster than the square of the
specific power decreases. Above 12 mole % ThF, the
inventory rises so rapidly that the decreasing specific
power dominates and causes the conservation coef-
ficient to decrease.

From these results it is seen that, with the conserva-
tion coefficient as the figure of merit, the best salt
composition is at or near 12 mole % ThF,. _

It is interesting to compare this conclusion with that
previously obtained using the annual fuel yield as the
figure of merit. Those results indicated that the yield
continued to increase as the Th¥, concentration was

- increased above 12%. The 12 mole % salt was chosen

primarily because salts with higher thorium concentra-
tions had poorer heat transfer properties and because
separation coefficients in the reductive extraction of
rare-earth fission products appear to be somewhat
better with the lower thorium concentration. With the
figure of merit in which the square of the specific
power appears there is a definite nuclear optimum at 12
mole % ThF,.

6.1.5 Improvements in Computational Tools
W.R.Cobb

Two recent code developments have contributed to
increased accuracy and decreased cost of routine design
calculations for the MSBR.

The preparation of group constants formerly done by
the code TONG on the IBM 7090 is now accomplished
by the code XSDRN® on the IBM 360/75 (or 360/65).
XSDRN is a one-dimensional discrete-ordinates (S,,)
code combined with the code NIT, which calculates
fine-group constants from resonance parameters by the
Nordheim integral treatment. XSDRN cell calculations
employ 93 fast groups and 30 thermal groups. From the
XSDRN fluxes and 123-group data library, broad-group
constants for 5 fast and 4 thermal groups are prepared
for use in CITATION and ROD (reactor optimization)
calculations.’

Multigroup two-dimensional diffusion calculations for
MSBR and MSBE design, formerly done with the code
EXTERMINATOR-2,° are now being done with the

 

4Bre:ecling gain times square of specific power.

recently developed code CITATION.? Refinements in
mesh representation and convergence accelerating tech-
niques in CITATION make typical nine-energy-group,
two-dimensional calculations run three to four times as
fast as with EXTERMINATOR.

Also, because of differences in input format as
compared with EXTERMINATOR, CITATION more
conveniently allows use of multiple sets of cross
sections for a particular nuclide. It is especially impor-
tant to use 233U and thorium cross sections which are
appropriate to the energy spectra in the core and
blanket respectively. :

.6.1.6 Gamma and Neutron Heating in MSBR
O.L.Smith J.T.Ward

Gamma and neutron heat sources in the one-fluid

~ reactor, vessel, and thermal and biological shields were

calculated using gamma and neutron . transport tech-
niques based on the ANISN transport code. In these
calculations the standard handbook recipes were specifi-
cally avoided, thereby eliminating the approximations
and uncertainties involved in using buildup factors in
complicated geometries.

Results are given here for one axial and two radial
traverses of the reactor and shields. The region thick-
nesses and compositions are shown with the results in
Figs. 6.3 through 6.8. For the radial traverses, two
one-dimensional infinite-cylinder calculations were per-

formed, the first at the core midplane, the second in a
plane two-thirds of the distance from the midplane to
the top of the core. In each case the neutron (and
gamma) flux was normalized to the value of the actual
center-line core flux at that elevation. No allowance was
made for axial buckling. Thus, particularly in the
shields, the calculated heat sources should be con-
sidered as upper limits to the actual heat sources. It is
estimated that the calculated sources inside the reactor
vessel are only a few percent high. But because of the
Jlarge air gap between the vessel and shields, the
calculated heat sources in the thermal shield and
concrete should be reduced by about 50% to account
for the actual finite height of the reactor.

In the axial centerline calculation, the system was
represented in slab geometry, infinite in the radial
dimension. Again, transverse buckling effects inside the
vessel are small. The results for the thermal and
biological shields are upper limits, but the overestima-

tion is lower in the axial direction since the air gap is
only a few feet. . -

The calculations were performed in several linked
stages starting with a one-dimensional ANISN transport
calculation of the neutron space and energy distribution
in the reactor and shields. From neutron fluxes and
scattering cross sections, the neutron heat distribution
was determined. The neutron heating in the reactor is
shown in Figs. 6.3, 6.5, and 6.7 for the two radial
traverses and one axial traverse. In each figure curve 4
shows the heat source per unit volume of homogenized
core, blanket, reflector, or plenum. Curves B and C
show, respectively, the heat source per unit volume of
graphite and salt separately in those regions. Curve D

' shows the heating in the INOR vessel.

Figures 6.4, 6.6, and 6.8 show the neutron heating in
the thermal and biological shields. The thermal shield is
treated as pure iron. The concrete is a standard grade.

The gamma heat distribution is similarly presented in
the - figures. Three sources of gammas were calculated
from the neutron flux distribution: prompt fission,
delayed (fission product), and capture gammas. The
first and last of these had the spatial distribution of the
neutron flux. The delayed source was assumed uniform
in the circulating salt. Since the salt spends approxi-
mately half its time in the reactor, approximately half
of the delayed gammas are emitted inside the vessel.

These three sources of gammas were combined in a
fixed-source ANISN gamma transport calculation using
seven gamma energy groups. From the gamma fluxes
the gamma heat sources were then calculated.

Also shown in Figs. 6.4, 6.6, and 6.8 are the gamma
doses at the external surfaces of the biological shield.

From the results it should be particularly noted that
neutron thermalization is a major heat source in the
graphite.

power fraction greater than 0.33, and a reactor power

in the range of 200 Mw (thermal); second, to determine -

the minimum reactor power which would produce a
peak damage flux of 5 X 10'* neutrons cm™ sec™
core power fraction greater than 0.33, and a breeding
ratio near unity (i.e., 1.0 * 0.05). Cases 21—-30 were
performed to achieve the first objective, cases 31--35 to
achieve the second. An axial blanket is shown here to

have an important influence on the reactor perform- -

ance. Previous cases had only a few inches of blanket
material in the axial direction. In particular, comparison

“of case 25 with the previously published case 18 (which

had only a few inches of axial blanket) shows that the
effect of reducing the core length by 1 ft and adding
1.5 ft of axial blanket at either end of the core
improves the breeding ratio without compromising
other aspects of the performance. Comparison of cases
26 and 27 shows that the desired core salt fraction is
0.2. Comparison of cases 25 and 28 shows that the axial
(and, of course, radial) salt fraction should be made as
large as possible in order to harden the blanket
spectrum and peak the power production in the core.

24,

During the course of these calculations two new
codes, CITATION (an improved version of EXTERMI-
NATOR) and XSDRN (a cross section code which
replaces TONG), were introduced into the calculational
procedures for the MSBE design studies. CITATION
was available and used for all of the cases in Table 6.5,
but XSDRN was not available until case 29. Hence the
slight difference between cases 28 and 29 reflects the
difference betweean the old and new cross sections.

Case 30 includes all the improvements established in
cases 21 through 29 and has 12 mole % ThF, (as
currently specified in the MSBR fuel salt). This case
demonstrates that a reactor operating at 169 Mw
(thermal) will produce a damage flux of 5 X 10'%,a
core power fraction of 0.57, and a start-of-life breeding
ratio of 1.051. This appears to be the most attractive
reactor configuration in the 200 Mw (thermal) range.

Cases 31—36 are largely self-explanatory. The desired
damage flux can be achieved at lower power levels by
decreasing the blanket thickness and sacrificing the
breeding ratio. Case 36 shows that a reactor operating
at 115 Mw (thermal) with 12 mole % ThF4 would have
a damage flux of 5 X 10'* neutrons cm™ sec™, a
breeding ratio of 0.97, and a core power fraction of
0.43. This appears to be the most attractive reactor
configuration in the 100 Mw (thermal) range.

6.3 MSBR EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS

6.3.1 Initial Results of the Experiment
to Measure of>3°U) in the MSRE

G.L.Ragan

Samples of the circulating fuel salt were taken during
the final run of the MSRE with 23% U fuel for use in the
measurement of a(?35U);a = EcIch. The method relies,
as outlined in an earlier report,? on precise measure-
ments of the concentrations of 235U and 22¢U relative
to that of 238U,

- The isotopic ratios are being measured by Lester A.
Smith and co-workers of the Isotopic Analysis Depart-
ment at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Some
of their early measurements have been analyzed, but
the results must be considered as preliminary until
additional measurements have been made and analyzed
and a comprehensive study of errors has been made.

The results presently available appear to agree very
well with the spectrum-average value of a that was

 

9MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968, ORNL-
4254,p.72.

 
 

 

 

calculated on the basis of the ENDF/B cross sections
for 233 U. The calculated average & was 0.264, while the

mass spectrometer measurements, with provisional cor-

rections for bumnout of **2U and ??¢U, indicate a
value of 0.255. The errors have not yet been fully

88

determined. While additional mass spectrometer meas-
urements are to be made, and further analysis, both of
the values and of the errors, will be required, it appears
that the technique will indeed provide valuable integral
checks on the differential cross-section measurements.

7. Systems and Components Development

Dunlap Scott

7.1 OFF-GAS SYSTEM

A.N.Smith  R.B.Gallaher Dunlap Scott

The general flow diagram for the off-gas system is
shown in Fig. 5.3 and is still essentially as has been
described previously.! Current estimates indicate that
the gas flow from the reactor primary system to the
volume holdup in the off-gas system will be about 11
scfm, of which 9 scfm will come from the gas separators
and the balance from the purge streams for the pump
shafts and miscellaneous instruments. A liquid-metal
coolant operated at temperatures below 500°F is being
considered for removing heat from the volume holdup
tank. If this method is accepted, the system for cooling
the liquid metal would have to be set up separately
from the primary-salt drain tank coolant system, since
the latter would require a much higher minimum
operating temperature. The preliminary design concept
for the volume holdup tank is described below.

7.1.1 Volume Holdup Tank

The function of the volume holdup tank is to delay
the off-gas stream for about 1 hr to permit decay of a
large fraction of the short-lived fission products and
dissipation of the accompanying heat. The cooling
system must be capable of handling a maximum of 18
Mw of decay heat. Provision must be made for the

collection and disposal of 1 to 2 1b of solid fission ,

products per day. Although the incoming gas will be
99+% helium, it will contain trace quantities of a
variety of other elements, including: tritium (CH);
stable Kr and Xe; radioactive Kr and Xe and associated
daughters such as Ba, Cs, La, Rb, Sr, Y, and Zr; and a
“smoke” of the so-called noble metals, Mo, Ru, T¢, and
Te. In addition, there will probably be small amounts of
the fuel salt in the form of a mist. Such mist particles

 

1MsR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug 31, 1968,
ORNL-4344, pp. 56 ff. and 72 ff. :

will be microspheres and will contain all the ingredients
of the fuel stream. In the volume holdup region the
noble metals and the daughters of Kr and Xe will be in
either the liquid or the solid state, and particles
suspended in the gas will probably range in size from
about 20 u down to single atoms.

For the initial approach to the problem, we have
assumed that settling or impaction will be used to
transfer the particles directly into a coolant stream. The
coolant will be recirculated through external equipment
for continuous removal of the solids and the associated
decay heat. The primary task is the selection of a
coolant which will satisfy our tentative requirements
for the system. Such a coolant must safely accept and
hold the “noble” metals, the daughters of the noble
metals, and the daughters of the noble gases and then
must release these fission products by treatment only in
the proper areas. It must have a vapor pressure low
enough to minimize carry-over to the 47-hr holdup
system, must be compatible with its container and with
fuel salt, and should have an existing technology for use
as a heat transfer agent. The eutectic of lead and
bismuth appears to offer sufficient attractiveness to
merit first place on the list of candidates. It is
compatible with the fuel salt, it has high density which
should minimize settling out of entrained noble metals,
and its low melting point (275°F) may permit opera-
tion at low temperature and the use of relatively
low-cost alloys as materials of construction.

Figure 7.1 shows a conceptual design of a volume
holdup tank utilizing the impaction mechanism for
transfer of the solids to a recirculating coolant stream.
Performance of the device has been calculated by use of
an equation developed for a low-pressure cascade
impactor® The results indicate that it should be
possible to design a system of reasonable geometry for

removal of particles in the 0.1-to-1.0-u range. Thus, for
removal of 0.15 particles at 50% efficiency, forty-two
0.080-in.-diam jets would be required for one stage to
handle the gas flow. A number of stages of relatively
low efficiency and operated in series will be used to
distribute the heat load and to minimize short-circuiting
of the gas into the charcoal beds, which are next in the
gas system. The volume holdup tank proper will be 8 ft
in diameter by 30 ft high. Coolant flow is from top to
bottom, and the coolant is also circulated through a
jacket to provide cooling for the walls of the vessel and
to absorb the gamma energy which is released as part of
the fission product decay. '

7.2 NOBLE-GAS MIGRATION IN THE MSBR
R.J.Kedl

In the last semiannual progress report,? results of
135 Xe poisoning calculations were presented for a 1000
Mw (electrical) single-fluid MSBR having a blanket and
reflector. The xenon stripping mechanism uses recircu-
lating helium bubbles 0.020 in. in diameter, where the
clean helium bubbles are added to the fuel and
135 Xe-rich bubbles are stripped out of the fuel in a
bypass around the pump. In the calculational model the
fuel loop is treated as a well-stripped pot. These
computations were repeated for all other noble-gas
fission products, of which there are over 30 kryptons
and xenons. The results are shown in Table 7.1. Some
of the more significant gas-migration parameters are
listed below, and the cases are characterized in the table
by the 35Xe poison fraction. The tabulated fluxes are
about the same for any reasonable combination of these
parameters that yield the same !3%Xe poison fraction.

The flow diagram that forms the basis for the
calculations in Table 7.1 is shown in Fig. 7.2. Note that
the flux into the bubbles is not necessarily equal to the
flux out of the reactor. Some longer-lived noble gases
are recycled from the 48-hr holdup system back into
the reactor with the helium, and for those gases the flux
to the bubbles is less than the flux out of the reactor.
For the short-lived gases the flux to the bubbles is
greater, because some decay and burnup take place
between the time the noble gas enters a bubble and the
time the bubble leaves the salt. For very short-lived
isotopes, where the half-life is a small part of the loop
circuit time, one would question the applicability of the
well-stirred pot model. Nevertheless, these computa-
tions are adequate for the preliminary designs.

7.2.2 Distribution of Decay Heat in the
MSBR Off-Gas System

A.N.Smith M. Bell

An estimate has been made of the distribution of
fission product decay heat in the 1000 Mw (electrical)
MSBR off-gas system. The calculations were based on
the following model:

1. The flux of krypton and xenon into the off-gas
line will be as calculated by R. J. Kedl for 0.56% poison
fraction (see Table 7.1). Solid daughters of krypton and
xenon are assumed to plate out at the point of
formation, which gives a high heating value for the pipe
sections. , '

2. The flux to the off-gas will include 50% of the
noble-metal fission products. Of these, 100% will be
retained in the 1-hr volume holdup. , -

3. Kiypton delay in the charcoal beds will be ¥,
xenon delay,

4, The off-gas system will be divided into 20 regions,
as shown in Fig. 7.4. The unstable noble gases will
decay exponentially in accordance with an assigned
delay or residence time. The 1-hr volume holdup and
the 47-hr xenon delay charcoal bed were divided into
compartments with various delay times in an attempt to
obtain approximately equal heat loads. The delay times
for the pipe sections were arbitrarily set at 18 sec each.

7.3 BUBBLE GENERATOR
R.J. Kedl

After considering several concepts for bubble gener-

settled on one. It can be thought of as an inverted
venturi and consists of a teardrop inside a straight
section of pipe. A plastic model has been built and
tested with water and air as shown in Fig. 7.5. Air is
injected into the throat through forty-eight Y, -in.-
diam holes in the teardrop. It could just as easily have
been injected through holes in the pipe wall or possibly
through a porous material. Four teardrop shapes have
been tested. The variable parameter in three of them
was the throat gap thickness, and in the fourth it was
the angle of the diffuser region. The generator has been
tested over the following ranges of variables:

Water flow rate, gpm 20-38
Water velocity in l-in.-lD pipe, fps 8.2-155
Air flow rate, scfh 0-2.35
Void fraction, % 0-15

Throat gap thickness, in.

1. A continuous gas plume develops for each hole in
the teardrop and extends into the diffuser region of
the teardrop, as shown in Fig. 7.6. The plume is
broken up into bubbles by the turbulence developed
in the diffuser. '

2. The bubble size is independent of the gas flow rate
over the range tested.

3. The bubble size is a mild inverse function of the
water flow rate.

4. The bubble size is approximately proportional to the
throat gap thickness over the range tested and can be
approximated by:

Bubble diameter &~ 0.25 X throat thickness.

5. The bubble size is probably not a strong function of
the hole size used for air injection.

Recalling that the target bubble size for the MSBR is 20
mils, a throat gap thickness.of about 80 mils would be
required.

The principal problem does not involve the bubble
generator but rather involves bubble coalescence down-
stream of the generator. Coalescence of bubbles in this
diameter range seems to be a rather strong function of
void fraction in the range of 0.1 to 0.5%. This is
illustrated by the two series of pictures in Fig. 7.7. In
both series the water flow rate is 38 gpm, giving a fluid

 

velocity of 15.5 fps in the glass pipe. The throat gap
thickness is 0.094 in. The difference between the series
is that in one the void fraction is about 0.5% and in the
other the void fraction is about 0.09%. The black line
that appears is a paper clip wire 0.036 in. in diameter.
Location of the pictures is defined in Fig. 7.5. Location
A is at the bubble generator. Note that the bubbles are
about 20 mils in diameter in both series. Location B is
about 3%, ft downstream of the generator. Location C
is 10 ft downstream from B and follows two 90°
elbows. In the case of the higher void fraction, the
bubbles have coalesced to an average diameter of about

40 mils at location C. In the case of the lower void .

fraction there seems to be very little coalescence.
Indications from other pictures are that higher fluid
velocities will inhibit coalescence, but this must be
checked further. The pipe velocities in the MSBR will
be over 20 fps, whereas in Fig. 7.7 the fluid velocities
are 15.5 fps. :

rator that was not completely satisfactory because the
gas core would not attach to the hub of the recovery
vanes. It was postulated that the trouble was associated
with the small hub diameter. A new set of vanes was
made with a much larger hub, but the problem
persisted. A third set of vanes was then made up
identical to those used in the HRT but scaled up for our
test section diameter. With this newest set of vanes, the
gas core does attach to the hub of the recovery vanes
much better than before. There is some splashing as the
water hits the hub, and consequently some gas bypasses
the takeoff line, but almost all the gas can be made to
leave through the takeoff line in the hub of the
recovery vanes. Note in Fig. 7.8 how the gas core seems
to hold onto the hub, as opposed to the photograph in
ORNL4344 (Fig. 7.3, p. 75), where the gas core
disintegrates as it approaches the hub. Since these vanes
have only recently been installed, no quantitative data
are available, ‘

7.5 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
TEST STAND

R. E. Helms

A request for directive, Preliminary Proposal Number
450, Molten-Salt Steam Generator Test Stand, has been
sent to the AEC for approval and authorization of
expenditures. ’ .

The test stand will have a capacity of 3 Mw, necessary
to test one or more full-size tubes for large steam
generators. It will consist of a molten-salt loop with a
gas fumace as a heat source and a water-steam loop
capable of operation at subcritical and supercritical

98

pressures. The flow diagram for the proposed installa-
tion is shown in Fig. 7.9. This test stand will be
operated at salt and steam conditions representative of
the MSBR and will have all necessary controls and
instrumentation to permit steady-state and transient
operation, including simulation of plant startup. The
test stand will be used to gain fundamental engineering
data and to investigate ideas for generating steam with
molten salt. Some of the principal objectives of the
development program are as follows:

1. To confirm the salt heat transfer and fluid flow

characteristics that were used in steam generator

design studies and to confirm the adequacy of a
computer code to be used for the design and analysis
of full-size molten-salt steam generators. -

2. To verify thermal and mechanical design features of
a small section of a full-scale molten-salt steam
generator.

3. To study the stability and operational performance
of a molten-salt-heated steam system.

4. To assure the absence of supercritical whistle in an
appropriate simulation of the boiler heat transfer
tubes under typical operating conditions.

5. To develop a startup system for the molten-salt
steam-generating plant and to demonstrate experi-
mentally the procedures to be used for startup.

6. To investigate the degree of corrosion and scale
buildup in a once-through system of this type and to
verify the chemical control of the water necessary
for acceptable performance. Information on the
compatibility of Hastelloy N with steam and salt will
supplement the data being obtained from a separate
materials testing program.

7. To gain further experience in fabricating com-
‘ponents of Hastelloy N.

A conceptual system design description (CSDD) is
now being prepared. As part of the design description
effort, we are completing the flow diagrams for all the
systems of the test stand prior to making the physical
layout drawings.

work was completed on pump cavitation tests,® studies
were continued on methods of controlling salt compo-
sition and on factors which affect formation of restric-
tions in the gas system, and initial tests were made with
a cold finger to investigate cold-zone deposition of
corrosion products. The primary reason for shutdown
on November 4 was a severe flow restriction in the
off-gas line at the pump bowl outlet nozzle. During
November and December a test section was installed at
the pump bowl outlet to provide pressure and tempera-
ture profile data and to permit installation of various
traps and filters. The loop was restarted on December
19, 1968, and circulation was continued without
interruption through February 1969. Cumulative circu-
lating time is 4600 hr, of which 3600 hr have been with
the clean batch of salt. In general, the test work has
produced no evidence of any engineering problem
which would preclude the use of NaBF,-NaF eutectic
as a reactor coolant.

7.6.1 Pumping Characteristics of
Sodium Fluoroborate Salt

Results of cavitation tests with the clean charge of
sodium fluoroborate and those obtained with the flush
charge of salt are compared in Table 7.2. The vapor
pressure of the fluoroborate salt and the pump tank gas

pressure at the inception of cavitation are shown. A
comparison of the changes in vapor pressure and
cavitation inception pressure with temperature using
the 900°F values as reference is also given. For a
particular change in temperature, the change in pump
tank pressure at the inception of cavitation should
equal the change in vapor pressure.

For the flush charge of fluoroborate the table
indicates relatively large differences of from 10 to 50%
between theory and test. The results with the clean
charge appear consistent with the notion that inception
of cavitation in the PK-P pump operating with sodium
fluoroborate can be correlated on the basis of net
positive suction head and vapor pressure; the differ-
ences range from zero to 20%. The available test
information does not provide an unequivocal reason for
the discrepancies observed with the flush charge of
fluoroborate; however, the effect of the impurities on
the BF, partial pressure is the most likely reason.

The results of the hydraulic performance and cavita-
tion inception tests were reported in an internal
memorandum from P. G. Smith dated January 10,

In a reactor coolant system, failure to control the salt
composition within acceptable limits could result in

precipitation of NaF on cold surfaces (decrease in
NaBF, content with resultant increase in liquidus

temperature) or boiling on hot surfaces (increase in
NaBF, content with resultant increase in BF; pres-
sure). Control of the salt composition is effected by
controlling the BF; content of the cover gas over the
free surface of the salt in the pump bowl.

Under normal conditions a change in composition
results only from transport of BF; to the off-gas system
by the flow of purge gas through the pump, and this
effect is counteracted by feeding BF; to the system at a
rate equal to the loss rate. The gas flows are so small,
compared with the total quantity of BF; present in the
salt, that rapid changes in salt composition by this
mechanism are impossible. For example, in the MSRE
coolant system at 1200°F and 24 psig, removal of BF 3
at the maximum rate (zero BF; feed) for eight days
would reduce the NaBF, content by only 1%. The
composition therefore can be controlled by occasional
adjustments in BF; feed rate, provided a suitable
method can be established for monitoring the salt
composition, Following is a brief description and a
summary of observations to date on several proposed
monitoring methods. '

1. Chemical Analysis of Salt Samples. The ratio of
fluorine to boron or boron to sodium is used to
estimate the mole fractions, A preliminary mathe-
matical analysis indicated that the limit of error of the
chemical analysis is too great to permit use of this
method. A plot of the mole fraction as calculated from
analyses of a large number of salt samples from the test
loop (Fig. 7.10) tends to verify this conclusion.

2. Change in Heat Transfer Coefficient Due to a Salt
Deposit. A heat transfer surface in the salt stream is
controlled at a temperature slightly above the normal
liquidus temperature. A change in composition would
result in a deposit on the cool surface which could be
detected by a change in heat transfer coefficient.
Evaluation has not been completed, but preferential
deposition of corrosion products will probably prevent
use of this method,

3. Differential Thermal Analysis. The composition is
inferred from analysis of temperature profiles obtained
by moving a salt sample through carefully controlled
freeze and thaw cycles. It appears that some work will
be necessary to develop suitable sampling techniques.

4. Thermal Conductivity of Cover Gas. The off-gas is
assumed to contain the equilibrium concentration of
BF; for the given salt temperature and composition.
The off-gas stream is monitored continuously by a
thermal conductivity cell which is calibrated in percent
BF;. The partial pressure of BF; is then calculated, and
this value is related to the composition by an equation
of the following form:

 

1nP=1n(1 _ff)-t(A-—B/T), |

where

P = partial pressure BF;, mm Hg,
f=mole fraction NaBF,,
T = temperature, °R,

A, B = constants.

The success of this method depends on the validity of
the above equation and on the ability to measure the
salt temperature and the BF; concentration in the gas
with sufficient accuracy. Recent physical property data

indicate the following derivative values for the above
equation: ‘

A=1867
B=25x10%
- T=1025°F
=092
dp/dT =075 mm Hg/°F
dp/df = 6.5 mm Hg/1 mole %

' Experiexice with the test loop indicates that this

method should be feasible for tracking the salt compo-
sition. In order for the analysis of the off-gas stream to
provide an accurate indication of the composition of

 
 

the salt, the gas must leave the pump bowl in
equilibrium with the salt in the pump bowl. That this
condition is attained in the test loop was indicated by
two types of experiments. In one the helium flow to
the pump bowl was varied, and this produced no change
in the composition of the exit gas. In the second the
BF; content of the gas that is introduced under the salt
through the bubbler tube of the level indicator was
varied over a wide range for short periods of time. This
also had no effect on the composition of the gas leaving
the pump bowl. The thermal conductivity cell used to
measure the partial pressure of the BF3 in the off-gas
showed excellent linearity and appeared to hold its
calibration adequately. A reactor-grade system would
require a built-in calibration system and, as noted
above, fairly precise and accurate methods for measur-
ing the operating variables.

7.6.3 Comrosion Product Deposition

We are studying the use of a cold trap in a reactor
coolant system to induce preferential deposition of
corrosion products and thus minimize scaling of the
heat exchanger tubes. Tests are being conducted with
the test loop to develop information on corrosion
product solubility and on the nature of the deposits
which are formed on a cold finger (Fig. 7.11) inserted
in the salt in the pump bowl. Operation of this unit for
3 hr at a wall temperature of about 750°F produced a
deposit of green crystals of the following composition:

Na B F Fe Cr Ni 02

Wt% 214 591 582 350 6.61 0.04 027

THERMOCOUPLE

102

The atomic ratios correspond roughly to a mixture
containing 2 moles of Na;CrFg to 9 moles of NaBF,.
Further studies will be made to determine whether
keeping the wall temperature definitely above the
liquidus reduces the NaBF; concentration.

7.6.4 Gas System Studies

Our experience when operating the test loop with the
clean batch of salt from August 19, 1968, to November
4, 1968, was similar to our previous experience with the
flush salt in the following respects:

1. Initially, relatively large quantities of a dark-brown
liquid accumulated in a mist filter in the off-gas line
from the pump bowl. As operation continued, the rate
of collection of liquid decreased essentially to zero, and
an accumulation of solids became evident, as seen in
Fig. 7.12.

2. There was frequent evidence of fouling of the
pump bowl pressure control valve. The valve would
gradually assume an 80% open position as compared
with a position of 20% open when clean. On several
occasions the valve stuck in the closed position. Figure
7.13 shows the accumulation of solids on the valve
stem.

3. A restriction developed in the off-gas line at the
pump bowl outlet nozzle, At first, it could be cleared
by blowing with gas or by applying moderate amounts
of heat, but the restriction gradually became more
intractable and ultimately refused to yield to torching
to red heat.

Following the shutdown on November 4, 1968, the
off-gas lines were opened for inspection. The restriction
at the pump bowl nozzle was found to be a dirty white

solid, and quantities of off-white solid were found in
the pipeline and in the control valve downstream of the
nozzle. Samples were submitted for chemical analysis,
results of which are reported as sample III in Table 7.3.
Representative analyses of other material removed from
the off-gas line since startup. of the loop in March 196
are also shown in the table, '
A Calrod heater and thermocouples were installed on
the %-in.APS by 6-in.long vertically oriented off-gas

nozzle, and the line immediately downstream was

modified to permit pressure profile data to be obtained

- and to provide for the installation of experimental traps

and filters. When operation was resumed on December
19, 1968, the test section contained, in order, a settling
tank, a wet-ice cold trap, and a high-efficiency porous
metal filter. The settling tank and cold trap were
subsequently replaced by an experimental impactor
unit, and currently the system is operating with only a
porous metal filter,

The normal mode of operation has been with no
power to the heater on the off-gas nozzle. Under this
condition the pipe wall temperature drops below the
salt liquidus, 720°F, at a point just past the nozzle
inlet. Heat has been applied on two occasions to relieve
flow restrictions. The first time, at 670 hr, heating the
nozzle to 950°F resulted in only temporary relief. The

second time, at 1000 hr, heating to 1025°F reduced the

pressure drop to zero. By the end of February, or 1700

- hr cumulative total, the restriction had not reappeared.

During this period of operation, solids accumulated in
the settling tank, impactor unit, and filter, and a small
quantity of dark-brown liquid collected in the cold
trap. In all cases the solids were white or light tan; in
the flush: salt run, the solids removed from the off-gas
system were mostly black with some green. The

light-tan material is probably a mixture of the white
solid and dark-brown liquid. Periodic weighings were
made in an attempt to determine collection rates, and
samples were submitted for chemical analysis.
Accumulations in the off-gas lines, traps, and control

“valve have been mixtures of materials. The basic
- ingredients of the mixtures are a white solid (sample

1V) and a viscous liquid (sample I). The solid is
primarily NaBF,4 -NaF eutectic, which is introduced into
the vapor space as a salt mist (probably generated by
the fountain flow in the pump bowl) and then
transported into the off-gas line. In cooling from liquid
droplets at 1025°F to solid particles at 720°F, the large
surface area of the droplets and the presence of BF; at
a partial pressure corresponding to the 1025°F tempera-
ture make conditions very favorable for absorption of
BF; by the salt. The solidified particles should also
tend to absorb BF;, but at a much slower rate. As a
result, samples of salt removed from the off-gas line
contain an excess of BF; as compared with the eutectic
composition. The viscous liquid is thought to be a
hydroxyfluoroboric acid which is present as a low-level

- impurity in the original charge of salt. This material is

transferred to the vapor space by the combined action
of the fountain flow and the liquid level bubbler and
thence to the off-gas line.

Solids accumulated in the traps have an estimated
bulk density of about 0.3 g/cm?, and they appear to be
agglomerates of particles about 1 p in size. The fact that
the particles could be transported to the control valve,
which is separated from the pump bowl by 30 ft of
tubing having many right-angle bends, also implies
particle sizes of 1 g or less. Solids which were found in
the settling tank and the impactor unit were tan in
color and had a caked appearance, factors which were

attributed to absorption of the dark-brown liquid.

Figure 7.14 shows material collected in the settling

tank. The black appearance of solids (sample II)

collected in the trap at the pump bowl outlet during the

flush' salt run is attributed to debris (mostly compounds
of Fe and C) left in the loop from previous operations.
Similarly, the green appearance was due to residual
BULT-4 salt.® Deposits on the surface of the porous
metal filter were initially snow white but eventually
changed to tan as more material accumulated and
possibly as a small amount of brown liquid collected on
the solid. The deposit had remained white throughout
the period in which the cold trap was in operation,
The rate of emission of the salt mist appears to be 0.1
to 0.3 g per 1000 liters of gas. Periodic weighings
indicate that the rate of accumulation of material in the
filter is somewhat higher when the off-gas nozzle at the
pump bowl is clean than during subsequent operation.

 

SMSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1968,
ORNL-4344, p. 78. R

When the restriction to flow is high at the nozzle, the
accumulation rate with the same flow of gas appears to
be essentially zero. This effect is attributed to an
increase in removal efficiency in the nozzle area as
deposits build up and the gas velocity increases,

The rate of emission of the liquid is initially high and
then decreases and appears to approach zero, which
tends to support the theory of an impurity that is
gradually stripped out of the salt. Operation for 600 hr
in December 1968 and Janumary 1969 produced an
accumulation of about 2 cm?® in the wet-ice cold trap.
This compares with an estimated 30 cm® of liquid
collected over the same period of time at the beginning
of the clean salt operation. Estimates of the total
quantity of liquid emitted are equivalent to removal of
about 500 ppm of impurity from the salt.

After 1600 hr of operation following the installation
of traps and filters, the off-gas pressure control valve is
still controlling in its “clean™ position of 20% open.
This fact, plus visual examination of the filter, indicates
that the porous metal has been quite effective in

removing the particulate matter from the gas stream.
The filter now in use contains three elements in series:
NEVA-CLOG, a patented form of perforated metal by
Multi-Metal Wire Cloth, Inc., and two layers of porous
metal, FM-225 and FM-204, by Huyck, Inc. Each
element has a cross-sectional flow area of 3 in.2, and
the overall clean pressure drop for the normal loop
conditions of 1 cfm/ft? is less than 0.1 psi. After 1200
hr of service the total loading was about 5 g, and the
pressure drop had not increased appreciably.

- The prevention of - off-gas restrictions involves 2
threefold approach: (1) pretreatment of the salt to
remove excessive quantities of the brown liquid impuri-
ties, (2) development of a trap or entrainment separator
which will prevent the formation of plugs in the critical
transition region where the salt droplets are cooling and

‘solidifying, and (3) use of a porous metal filter to

remove any subcooled particles which are carried past
the trap. The inlet section of the trap should be a hot
zone where the salt mist is efficiently deentrained and
allowed to drain to the pump bowl. The outlet section
should be designed to chill the unretained fraction of
the mist so that the subcooled particles will remain gas
borne and will be carried into the filter section. Several
trap designs are under consideration, and selected
models will be tested in the loop system.

7.7.1 MSBR Primary-Salt Pump

The study concept of the primary-salt pump for the
1000 Mw (electrical) Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor
(MSBR) has not changed significantly from that shown
and described previously.”*® The conceptual layout has
been modified, as shown in Fig. 7.15, to reflect
approaches to resolving some of the interface problems
between the salt pumps and the remainder of the
primary pump system. The pump is based on a flow of
16,000 gpm, a head of 150 ft, and a speed of 890 rpm.
The required horsepower will be about 2500 for each
pump.

Since the reactor is the fixed component in the

106

expansion displacements of about 2 in. horizontally and
about 1 in. vertically at the pump tank. The design

effects of these displacements on the pump show in the

shield configuration, method of pump support, cell
andfor pump containment, and, depending on the
method of mounting the drive motor, the coupling
between the motor and the pump. The shielding around
the concept pump is of the disk-and-doughnut type and
will permit the unhindered displacement of the pump
and also provide adequate shielding of the lubricant and

coolant in the region of the lower bearing and seal.

Additional shielding may be provided above the pump
tank to reduce nuclear radiation intensity at the crane
bay floor to an acceptable biological ievel.

In our present concept the motor is mounted directly

‘on the crane bay floor, and the pump is suspended on

spring-mounted support rods that are free to pivot at
both ends. The spring constant of the springs will be
sufficiently low that the forces on the pump tank
nozzles will not be excessive. The coupling between the
motor and the pump is a floating shaft gear which will
be installed in the maximum horizontal displacement

. position. During system heatup the pump will move

into a position where the pump shaft will be nominally
aligned with the motor shaft for normal pump oper-
ating conditions. An alternative concept would have the
motor mounted directly on the pump bearing housing.
This would eliminate relative thermal displacement
between the pump and motor and relieve the coupling

~ from having to accommodate the displacements. How-

system, the primary-salt pumps are subjected to thermal

ever, the spring-support rods would need to accommo-
date the added weight of the drive motor.

The concept has a large seal leakage containment
volume to accept the oil from a gross failure of the
lower seal. In addition, a Visco seal, adjacent to the
lower seal, will prevent oil from entering the salt system
when the shaft is rotating. When the pump is stopped a
static shutdown seal can be actuated by gas pressure to
prevent the flow of oil down the shaft annulus. The
primary purpose of the static shutdown seal is to permit
the removal of the bearing housing assembly without
removing the shield plug, shaft, and impeller from the
pump tank.

Means for cooling the pump tank, its internal struc-
tural elements, the pump shaft, and the lower end of
the shield plug have been included in the modified
concept. The nuclear heat generation in these com-
ponents will be removed in primary salt (at about
1050°F) from the fill and drain line of the reactor

system. The salt enters a plemfm around the inner

periphery of the pump tank and flows upward in an
annular liner. At the junction of the pump tank and

outer pump casing the flow splits, with part of the flow
passing downward between the inner and outer pump
casings and part of the flow passing across the lower
end of the shield plug and into the annulus between the
shaft and the shaft sleeve. In the pump tank these flows
combine with the fountain flow from the labyrinth seal

. behind the impeller, the return flow from the chemical

processing system, and the return flow from the
entrainment separator. All these flows are returned to
the main stream of the reactor system through a drain
line connecting the bottom of the pump tank to a
low-velocity point inside the reactor. Block or spherical
filters will be placed appropriately in the pump tank to

- reduce the parasitic volume of primary salt.

At each pump the primary cell containment is
extended through the concrete shielding above the
reactor cell to contain the pump drive motor. The drive
motor heat sink is provided by cooling water circulated
through cooling coils attached to the outside of the mo-
tor containment vessel. Internally a blower attached to
the motor shaft will circulate helium through the motor

tion, to view his fabrication and test facilities, to discuss
his quality assurance organization, and to attempt to
gage his interest in the salt pump program. The
primary-salt pump specification is being revised to
reflect manufacturer comments. An evaluation of the
visits is being made to select pump manufacturers to
receive a Request for Proposal to participate in the
pump program. The Scope of Work portion of the
Request for Proposal is being prepared. The specifica-
tion for the secondary-salt pump, generally patterned
after the primary-pump specification, is being prepared.

The scope of the phase I portion!® was revised to -
obtain the maximum pump manufacturer participation
that can be achieved with the funds available for fiscal
year 1970, As now conceived, phase I will be based

_principally on the following items:

and over cooling fins attached to the inside of the

motor containment vessel. The motor is mounted on a
ring through which all electrical, instrument, gas,
coolant, and lubricant lines are connected to the pump.

7.7.2 Pump Program for the Molten-Salt
Breeder Experiment

The plans®:!® outlined previously to obtain the

primary- and secondary-salt pumps for the Molten-Salt
Breeder Experiment (MSBE) are progressing. A second
draft of the specification for the MSBE primary-salt
pump was prepared to include the comments generated
in an internal review of the first draft. An evaluation
team consisting of personnel from the Purchasing
Division, the Reactor Division, and the Inspection
Engineering Department was selected. The team de-
veloped a rating system for pre- and postproposal
evaluation of potential salt pump manufacturers. Also it
selected 12 United States pump manufacturers and
contacted each by letter to determine his interest in
participating in the program and in reviewing a draft
copy of the specifications for the primary salt pump.
Each of the six pump manufacturers who evinced
interest in the program was visited by the team. The

1. Prepare design concepts and layout drawings that
meet the general intent of the specifications. It is
intended that the primary- and secondary-salt pump
designs have sufficient similarity to permit a high degree
of interchangeability of parts and to avoid, as much as
possible, two parallel design and development efforts.

2. Investigate the limitations of using the same
impeller and pump casing design for the primary- and
secondarysalt pumps and obtaining the specified
hydraulic characteristics by operating at two different
speeds and by changing the impeller diameter.

3. Make a parametric study, for the primary-salt

~pump only, of the relationship between pump speed,

purpose of the visit was to receive and discuss the

manufacturer’s comments about the pump specifica-

pump efficiency, salt volume within the pump, and
required net positive suction head. A pump speed and a
design concept that are mutually agreeable to both the
seller and the Company can then be chosen.

4. Make a study to show that the selected MSBE

pump concept can be scaled up satisfactorily to a pump
size having a flow capacity of at least 20,000 gpm and a
head of 150 ft, and indicate the probable amount of
developmental effort required beyond the MSBE pro-
gram. '
5. Make preliminary calculations that will provide
approximate component dimensions and show that the
concept meets the general intent of the specifications.
This can be considered to be the minimal analytical
effort required to prove a concept.

6. Make the necessary calculations and analyses to
show that the pump design completely meets the
requirements of the specifications.

7. Make a detailed layout drawing of the pump
concept showing all features needed to meet the
specific requirements of the specifications.

8. Revise the phase II and phase III programs
submitted by the seller in his proposal, giving more
detail on the schedule, manpower requirements, specific
 

 

 

manpower assignments, material requirements, develop-
mental effort, facility modifications and requirements,
cost estimates, and the fabrication and testing plans,
including location and ownership of facilities.

9. Prepare and submit a phase I report, including all
analyses, studies, and layout drawings, that will permit
the Company to evaluate the concept and the program
plans proposed by the seller.

10. Revise the specifications for the primary and
secondary salt pumps as the phase 1 effort indicates
necessary, and prepare new specifications or use Com-
pany specifications where applicable.

7.7.3 MSBE Salt Pump Test Stand

The pump test stand!? will be capable of accommo-
dating fullsize MSBE primary and secondary salt
pumps and will be located in Building 9201-3, Y-12. We
plan to utilize capital funds for its design and construc-
tion, which have been estimated to cost $625,000. The
detailed design of the stand and the procurement of the
requisite Hastelloy N raw materials are scheduled to
begin in fiscal year 1969 (if the necessary approvals are
obtained in time). Completion of construction is
scheduled for early in fiscal year 1972,

Several activities have been completed or broached

109

during the report period. The preliminary design and -

cost estimates were completed. Project and Laboratory
management approvals for the capital fund request were
obtained. The safety review was made. The request for
directive was prepared, approved by UCCND manage-
ment, and submitted to the Oak Ridge Operations
Office of the AEC. A draft of the system design
description for the stand was prepared and is being
reviewed internally.

774 ALPHA Pump

Des1gn work has been started on a small molten-salt

or liquid-metal pump to be called the ALPHA pump. It
is for laboratory use in corrosion and heat transfer

- studies. We will attempt to design a versatile pump for

pump to provide access to the salt surface for auxiliary
equipment and developmental needs.

7.8 REMOTE WELDING
P. P. Holz

During this period, we completed the fabncatlon and
started the testing of the automated cutting and
welding equipment based on the design developed by
the Air Force and the North American Rockwell
Corporation. This equipment, referred to in previous
reports as “orbital” pipe cutting and welding equip-
ment, employs a drive carriage which fits a range of
pipe sizes and provides the mounting base for the pipe
cutting and welding heads. Initial tests of the ORNL
equipment were performed with a welding programmer
loaned to us by the Air Force, after being used by them
for automated control of welding process variables
during tests of the1r equipment at Edwards Air Force
Base.

Figure 7.16 shows the welding programmer and, in
front of it, the remote operation pendant which is used
in conjunction with the programmer for emergency
shutdown or manual checkout and cutting operations.
To the right of the programmer is the welding head,
with the electrode and the nozzle of the wire feeding
device in the foreground. The large horseshoe-shaped
piece is the orbital drive assembly, which fits a limited
range of pipe sizes and drives the cutting and welding
heads around the pipe. Next is the cutting head, with
the blade visible in the foreground. The cutting and
welding heads are designed to fit in the open space at
the top of the horseshoe-shaped orbital drive mecha-
nism. , - '

Figure 7.17 shows the welding head mounted on the
orbital drive mechanism but opened to show the inner
parts. The remote control pendant is placed next to the
orbital drive mechanism, and the whole assembly is
mounted on a 6-in. pipe.

Figure 7.18 shows the orbital carriage with the

~cutting head in place. The teeth of the cutting head can
~ be seen through the slot in the end of the carriage. The

flows in the range up to 30 gpm, a head capabilityupto

300 ft, and a maximum operating temperature of

line of the initial cut being made is visible on the top

~ side of the pipe near the edge of the orbital carriage.

1400°F. None of the pumps presently in use at the

Laboratory meet all these criteria. Additional criteria

include (1) a minimum liquid volume within the pump,
(2) a minimum salt-wetted surface arez within the
pump, and (3) a continuous operating capability of

-10,000 hr. A mﬂ tank will be located adjacent to the

 

Yrpig, pp. 81-83.

" The automatic voltage control compares and corrects

~ arc voltage with respect to a standard polarity and a

preset voltage. The resultant signal controls the input to
the wire feed amplifier, which in turn varies the wire
feed rate in a way that reduces weld bead irregularities
as the torch traverses the pipe. The welding control
programmer lent to us by the Air Force is designed to
control and/or sequence each of the following welding
variables or functions:

The welding head performs the following operations:
(1) locates the electrode accurately with respect to the
weld joint, (2) feeds filler wire at the desired rate to the
weld joint, (3) provides space to store sufficient welding
wire on a spool for multiple filler weld passes, (4)
provides the required flow of inert welding gas to the
torch cup, (5) provides power and cooling water flow to
the torch head, and (6) provides cross-seam oscillation
of the electrode. ,

The cutter head performs the following operations:
(1) cuts the pipe, (2) mills the pipe ends square, and (3)

110

mills the required weld joint configuration at the pipe
ends. .

The complete cutting, welding, and automated con-
trol assembly became available just at the close of the
reporting period, and only a few operational tests were
performed; but these tests, without benefit of operating
experience or equipment debugging, gave very encour-
aging results. The 6-in. stainless steel pipe shown in
Figs. 7.16 and 7.17 was successfully cut and welded.
The carriage tracked perfectly in cutting and welding
through a number of trial sawcuts, bevel cuts, and test
welds. The weld beads, including the root paths, looked
promising for stainless materials; no other materials
were tested. The evenness and consistent quality of the
weld bead were especially promising, although no
formal weld inspection tests were performed.

A detailed “Proposal for the Development of a

~ Remote Control System for Cutting and Welding

Radioactive Pipe and Vessels” was submitted to the
Director, Division of Reactor Development and Tech-
nology. The proposal covers a five-year, $3,000,000
development program to adapt the orbital equipment to
fully remote operation in high radiation fields. The
proposed program is planned to yield a complete

8. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

8.1 CONTROL SYSTEM ANALYSIS
W. H. Sides, Jr.

The simulation of the single-fluid 1000 Mw (electri-
cal) MSBR for the preliminary investigation of the
overall plant control problems was completed. To the
model previously reported,! which included a lumped
model of the primary heat exchanger and steam
generator, was added a lumped model of the reactor
heat transfer, a two-group approximation of the core
nuclear kinetics equations, and a reactivity control
system. The completed lumped model is shown in Fig.
8.1. As in previous calculations, the heat transfer
coefficient on the tube side of the exchangers was taken
to be proportional to the 0.8 power of the tube-side
flow rate and on the shell side proportional to the 0.6
power of the shell-side flow rate. The temperature of
the feedwater entering the steam generator was held
constant at 700°F, and system pressures were assumed
constant.

The nuclear kinetics equations used in the simulation
were a two-group form of those from McPhee.? The
transport lag introduced into the delayed-neutron pre-
cursor equations by the circulation of the fuel was
approximated by a first-order lag, that is,

_ d
-1~ ) —1, 2 ) -

The temperature coefficients of reactivity for the

primary salt and graphite were also included in the
simulation. - :

The conceptual control system for controlling system
flows, temperatures, and reactivity is indicated in Fig. -

8.1. As in previous studies,! the objective of the control
system was to maintain the steam temperature within a
few degrees of the design value of 1000°F during a

transient condition. The previous studies indicated that
a variable secondary-salt flow rate was necessary for
sufficiently rapid steam temperature control. Therefore,
the secondary-salt flow rate was altered at a rate
proportional to the error in steam temperature, as
indicated in the figure. Previous studies also showed
that an acceptable steady-state system temperature
profile could be obtained for partial plant load con-
ditions if the secondary-salt flow rate were returned to
its 100% power level value following a transient.
Therefore the error in secondary-salt flow rate gener-
ated by the steam temperature control action produces
a rate of change of the reactor outlet temperature set
point. This outlet temperature is compared with the
reactor inlet temperature, and this reactor AT yields the
reactor power level set point. This power level set point
is compared with the actual reactor power level, and the
error signal operates a servo controller which produces
appropriate control rod motion with the maximum
reactivity insertion rate limited to 0.1%/sec. Thus the
secondary-salt flow rate is returned to its 100% power
level by altering the reactor temperature level through
the reactor outlet temperature set point.

Several transient cases were run with this model,
including decreases in power demand from 100% by
steps of 10, 30, 50, and 60% and by ramp changes of 30
and 70% each at § and 10%/min; changes in reactivity

of steps of *0.05, 0.1, and —0.5% and, with the

reactivity controller disconnected, reactivity steps of
10.05, +0.01, and —0.1% and ramp changes in reactivity -
of +0.05 and —0.1% each at 0.1%/min. Also the step
loss -of one secondary-salt coolant loop was simulated.
The system transfer function between control rod
reactivity as an input and reactor power was also

measured.

The results of load demand pérturbations are sum-

_marized in Table 8.1. The maximum steam temperature
-deviations from 1000°F are given, as well as the

maximum required rates of change of the secondary-salt
flow rate and the control reactivity. The highest
reactivity rate is seen to be well below the 0.1%/sec

value of control reactivity requlred dunng a transient is
also shown.

The results of the simulation of the loss of. one
secondary-salt coolant pump indicated that the plant
cannot deliver 100% of full load with the temperature
and flow limits which were placed on the system in this
model, namely, a limit of 110% of full flow per loop on
the secondary salt and a limit of 1400°F on the reactor
outlet temperature set point.

A complete report on the methods and results of this
study is in preparation.> '

It is apparent from the results of this study that the
rather narrow bands within which the temperatures of
the two salts must be maintained will produce a
necessity for careful control. Such plant maneuvers as
increasing and decreasing the load demand on the plant
and certain reactivity excursions may -allow these
temperatures to decrease below the freezing points.
However, the models used in these simulations and
calculations are abbreviated, and the results are in-
tended only to indicate possible trends in future more
detailed investigations, Such investigations are not
possible with the analog equipment available at present
without either linearizing the simulation equations
(reducing the dynamic range) or simulating only a part
of the plant at a time or both. Even then the modeling
of such a unit as a supercritical steam generator is a
difficult task on the analog computer. A more detailed
simulation than is attempted here should be attempted
by employing more powerful simulation techniques, for
example, hybrid computation. '

8.2 CALCULATIONS OF NEUTRON DECAY
~ AFTER SHUTDOWN

W. H. Sides, Jr.

The calculation reported previously* of the decay of

the neutron density in the MSBR core was extended to

investigate the effects of (1) the contribution of the
photoneutron reaction from beryllium and (2) the loss
of all primary-salt flow rate. :

'8.2.1 Calculation of the Effect of the
- Beryllium Photoneutron Reaction on
-Neutron Density After Shutdown -

. A calculation was made of the neutron source
resulting from the ®Be(y,7)2*He reaction, based on an
estimation of the total gamma-ray flux above 1.67 Mev
in the 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR core. This source was
treated as a seventh deldyed-neutron group in the

circulating fuel kinetics equations of Meghreblian and:
Holmes.®> The total gamma-ray flux in the MSBR core
of an energy above 1.67 Mev, the threshold for the
reaction, and from isotopes having a half-life of
between 2 and 35 min was estimated to be approxi-
mately 1.3 X 10'2 photons cm™ sec™ or less. With a
BeF, concentration in the primary salt of 16 mole %,
the total photoneutron source was calculated to be no
greater than 4.22 X 10° neutrons cm™ sec™ . Treating
this source as a seventh delayed-neutron group yielded a
value for the delayed-neutron fraction, 8, for this group
of 1.2 X 107 with a mean decay constant of 7.6 X
107%/sec. A subsequent seven-group calculation com-
pared with a previous six-group calculation indicated
that the contribution of this neutron source to the
decay of the neutron density after a —1% step in
reactivity was negligible.

8.2.2 Calculation of Neutron Density
Following Loss of Primary Flow

The behavior of the neutron density as a function of
time after the loss of all primary-salt flow was investi-

~ gated by a simulation on the Reactor Controls Analog

Computer. The steady-state full power for the core was
2250 Mw (thermal). The calculations were carried out
for both 233U and 235U,

The event analyzed was one in which all primary-salt
pumps coast down from full flow to zero following loss
of power to the pumps. Negative control reactivity of
up to 1% was inserted into the core either simul-
taneously with the initiation of pump coastdown or
following pump coastdown by some specified delay
time. An abbreviated heat transfer model was included
to approximate the effect of the temperature coeffi-
cients of reactivity. A two-delayed-group model for the
kinetics equations was used.? The calculation was
carried out for times up to 300 sec after the initiation
of pump coastdown.

A summary of the results for is shown in Figs,
8.2 and 8.3. Figure 8.2 shows the effects of various
amounts and rates of reactivity insertion on the
integrated power in the core 300 sec after the initiation
of primary flow coastdown and simultaneous insertion

watt-seconds of energy generated in the core per initial
steady-state megawatt for that fraction of the thermal
power which is directly proportional to the neutron
density. The insertion of the reactivity as a step is, of
course, the upper limit on speed of insertion of
reactivity. Figure 8.2 shows, for example, that if —1%
in reactivity is inserted at a rate of 0.1%/sec rather than
as a step, the amount of energy generated in the core
300 sec after shutdown increases from 1.17 Mwsec/Mw
to 2.75 Mwsec/Mw. If the ramp rate is decreased by a

amounts of inserted reactivity indicates the diminishing
value of increments above 1% in reactivity magnitude.

If there is a delay between the initiation of pump

~ coastdown and the insertion of reactivity into the core,
~for example, due to the time required for sensing and

evaluating an event, the integrated power generated in
the core may be increased. Figure 8.3 shows this effect
for delay times of §, 10,-and 20 sec. Reactivity
magnitudes of —0.5 and —1.0% at rates of 0.02 and
0.1%/sec were used in accordance with the previous
figure, It may be seen from the previous figure that
these curves will approach 29.6 Mwsec/Mw as the delay
time approaches 300 sec, since this approaches the case
of no control action taken after pump coastdown.

8.3 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF MSER
STEAM GENERATOR

~F.H.Clark O.W.Burke

- - Work performed at Oak Ridge on the dynamic

analysis of the MSBR steam generator has been re-
ported in ORNL-TM-2405, issued January 1969.

A more extensive analysis of the steam generator is
being carried on under subcontract with the University
of Illinois at the university’s hybrid computation
facility. Preliminary setup of the problem is complete,
and troubles are now being experienced in attaining
convergence of the pressure. Such difficulties are not
uncommon in dynamic water analyses and are related
to the near incompressibility of water. In the super-
critical water domain it would not be justified to make
the simplifying assumption of incompressibility.

8.4 HIGH-TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE
THERMOMETER EVALUATION

R.L.Moore T.M.Cate

- Investigation of the feasibility of measuring high
temperatures in molten-salt systems with resistance
thermometers was continued.® Phase I tests of two sets
of thermometers (one matched and one unmatched)
have been completed. The purpose of these tests was to
determine whether gross shifts in calibration would
occur during prolonged operation at high temperature
with occasional wide variations in operating tempera-
ture, including return to room temperature.

 

SMSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1968, ORNL-
4344, pp. 94-95. '
 

 

 

 

 

The tests were performed by heating the elements
from room temperature to a preselected temperature,
operating at this temperature for varying periods of
time, and then cooling to room temperature, The bridge
output voltage was observed during the cycle to detect
calibration shifts and to determine the degree of
mismatch of the calibration of the two thermometers.
Before and after each cycle the ice-bath (32°F) resist-
ance of each element was measured to determine the
magnitude of any shift which occurred.

The unmatched (off-the-shelf) set of thermometers
was tested first. Results of these tests are shown in Fig.
8.4. No change in calibration was observed after initial
successive cycles to 800 and 1200°F; however, when
the thermometers were heated to 1400°F there was
indication of a calibration shift, and when the ther-
mometers were cooled to room temperature it was
noted that a 14-mv shift (equivalent to 5°F) had
occurred in the output signal. Subsequent checks
showed that the 32°F resistance of one element, 14,
had increased from 100.12 to 101.52 ochms and that the
resistance of the other element, 1B, had increased from
100.2 to 100.32 ohms. During five succeeding cycles to
1200°F no further shift occurred; however, during

~ subsequent cycles of various durations fo 1300, 1400,

and 1500°F, the resistance of element 14 decreased

part of the way and that of 1B decreased all the way to
initial resistance. This suggested that the initial shift was
due to induced stresses which were relieved by subse-
quent operation at high temperature. _

Further testing of these thermometers was then
deferred to do testing of the second (matched) set and
to determine whether the calibration of the first set
would continue to shift at room temperature. As shown
in Fig. 8.5, the performance of the matched set was
similar to that of the unmatched set.

Testing of the first set was resumed and showed that
the resistance of the thermometers had not changed
during a month at room temperature. This indicated
that the thermometers could not be expected to recover
their initial calibration in any reasonable time at room
temperature. During the subsequent operation, we
attempted to determine whether extended operation at
1500°F, the maximum rated temperature, would result
in stable operation at all lower temperatures. After
several weeks of testing, it appeared that the 32°F
resistance of both elements had stabilized, with 14 0.4
ohm above the as-received value and 1B at its initial
value. No provisions were made for checking the
accuracy of the thermometers at high temperature in
phase 1 tests, so we do not know at this time whether
the 0.4-ohm shift is a zero or span shift.

9. Heat Transfer and Thermophysical Properties

9.1 HEAT TRANSFER

B.Cox H.W.Hoffman J.J.Keyes,Jr.

In the previous semiannual report! the experimental
procedure was described in detail, and a schematic
diagram of the system for determining the heat transfer
coefficients with molten salts flowing in metal tubes
was depicted. Experiments were discussed in which a
proposed single-region MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF;-
ThF,4-UF,4, 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %) was employed. The
test section was a 24.5-in.-long, 0.25-in.-OD, 0.035-in.-
wall Hastelloy N tube, resistance heated. In par-
ticular, it was noted that, while the temperature
data in the low laminar regime (Reynolds modulus
Ng. = 800) were consistent with the pattern ex-
pected for fully developed flow beyond a reasonably
well-defined entrance length, the data in the low
turbulent regime (N, 2 10,000) showed irregular wall
temperature variations along the tube which were
inconsistent with expected behavior for developed
turbulent flow.

During the current report period, a detailed study was
made of possible sources of error which could lead to
the observed temperature irregularities. It was con-
cluded, for example, that effects of volumetric heat
generation in the salt were negligible. Also eliminated as
sources of error were effects due to non-steady-state
-operation, nonuniform heat loss, and spurious emf’s
induced in the thermocouples by the 60-Hz heating
current. Thermocouples which were suspected of being
subjected to aging or work hardening were replaced, as
were a few faulty channels in the scanning-type readout
instrument.

The only uncertainty which could not be eliminated

was the influence of a small hole which had been
burned in the test section near one end and then
repaired by welding. The length of test section down-
stream from this point (about 120 diameters for flow

entering the near end) should be sufficient, it was
believed, to minimize the effect of any disturbance
produced in the repair zone. However, for some of the
runs at moderate and high values of the Reynolds
modulus, a more abrupt decrease in wall temperature

. was observed at a distance about 6 in. from the inlet

when the flow entered the end of the tube nearest the
repair (located about 3 in. from the inlet) than was
observed at a comparable distance for flow entering the
opposite end. The amplitude of the disturbance in the
wall temperature was about the same for flow in either
direction. |

Heat transfer experiments employing the modified
apparatus with the proposed MSBR fuel salt revealed
essentially the same irregularities in axial temperature
profile in turbulent flow as had been observed in the
initial experiments. The new results covered a range of
Ngp, from 375 to 6570. Table 9.1 is an updated
summary of operating conditions for all experiments
with the MSBR fuel salt. In one group of runs (55, 61,
and 71) the Reynolds modulus was held constant at
about 6000 and the inlet liquid temperature at about
1100°F, while the heat flux (based on the liquid
enthalpy rise) was varied from 0.66 X 10° to 6.02 X
10° Btu hr™! ft™2. If the abnormalities in the axial

temperature profile were due to influence of natural

convection or variation in physical properties (possibly
changing the radial velocity and temperature profiles
sufficiently to delay establishment of fully developed
hydrodynamic and thermal conditions), then it would
be expected that variations in heat flux would alter the
basic shape of the profile. That this is not the case is
seen in Fig. 9.1, in which temperatures measured on the
outside wall of the test section are plotted as a function
of distance along the test section for three different
heat flux levels. The comresponding liquid temperature
lines are also indicated. Note that, while increasing the
heat flux exaggerated the peak in the temperature near
the inlet, the rise near the exit, and the irregularities
over the middle portion of the test section, the general
shape of the three profiles is the same. Thus the heat
transfer coefficients calculated from the ratio

Qf/A(Twau - Tliquid) all show about the same
magnitude of axial variation. These results are sug-
gestive of a laminar-turbulent transition, the effect of
which persists to the tube exit.

Because the temperature data suggest that stable
hydrodynamic and thermal conditions may be develop-
ing near the exit, preliminary estimates have been made
of the Nusselt modulus, Ny, = hD/k (where & is the
heat transfer coefficient, D the tube inside diameter,
and k the salt thermal conductivity) based on test
section exit conditions. In Fig. 9.2 the dimensionless
heat transfer function Ny, (u,/u)°-**[Np °-3% (where

Np, is the Prandtl modulus and ug/u the ratio of fluid
absolute viscosity evaluated at the tube surface to that

~ evaluated at the bulk liquid temperature) is plotted

against the Reynolds modulus. All physical properties
are evaluated near the tube exit and are based on
estimates presented in ref. 2. Also plotted are results
obtained in the laminar flow regime. In the transition
range, 1000 < Ng , <4000, the tube wall temperatures
near the exit were varying too rapidly to permit

fuel salt. At an average bulk salt temperature of 1188°F

the average value for the thermal conductivity was
found to be 0.68 Btu hr™! ft™! (°F)™ [0.012wem™
(°C)™!]. Using this value in computing the heat transfer
function in Fig. 9.2, the data for laminar flow and for
Ny, > 10° fall very close to the Sieder-Tate correla-
tion.

As has been observed, the tube wall temperature
patterns near the entrance of the test section suggest
the possibility of a laminar-turbulent transition, with
approach to developed flow near the outlet. Using
comrelations for laminar entrance regions® and for
developed turbulent flow (Dittus-Boelter equation)?
-and physical property data from ref. 2, wall tempera-
tures were predicted and compared with the observa-
tions. The measured tube wall temperatures were, in all
cases considered, less than those calculated, indicating
that the coefficient of heat transfer was abnormally
high. The discrepancy was particularly pronounced over
‘the midportion of the test section, suggesting the
possibility that irregularities in the inside of the tube

could serve for turbulence promotion — these irregu-

larities arising, for example, from deposition of rela-
tively high-melting-point material. However, x rays of
the test section indicated no significant deposition. The
possibility that excessive test section corrosion could
have altered the flow pattern of the salt was also
investigated. Portions of the test section were cut out,
mounted, etched, and photomicrographed. Figure 9.3
shows both unetched and etched photomicrographs of

the tube’s inner wall. Because of the high salt tempera- -

tures (up to 1550°F) some corrosion is present, but not
enough to affect the heat transfer results. The maxi-
mum pit depth observed was about % mil. A chemical
analysis of the salt showed that no significant compo-
sition change occurred during the experiments.

Before proceeding further with MSBR fuel salt
experiments, it was decided to evaluate the apparatus
and technique by the use of a molten salt having
well-known properties and heat transfer behavior. The
eutectic mixture known commercially as Hitec, manu-
factured by Du Pont (KNO;-NaNQO,-NaNQ;, 44-49-7
mole %), was chosen because it is known to behave
normally with respect to agreement with the standard
heat transfer correlations.” A new test section, identical

in geometry to the original one, was used, and all

thermocouples on the test section were replaced.
Figures 9.4 and 9.5 are plots of the axial temperature
profile for Hitec in turbulent flow. These profiles are in
marked contrast to those of Fig. 9.1 for the MSBR salt
in that the Hitec data show a region along the
midsection of the tube in which the wall and liquid
temperature are parallel and hence the heat transfer
coefficient is constant, indicative of fully developed
flow. A short entrance region is evident in Fig. 9.4, and
in both figures slight irregularities in the temperatures
near the exit are believed to be due to thermocouple
error.

The Hitec runs included three at Ny, ~ 9000 and
three at Np . ~ 21,000, all with variable heat flux. For
nine of the ten turbulent Hitec runs the experimental
heat transfer coefficients varied by less than 13% from
values predicted by the Dittus-Boelter equation.? These
results indicate that the experimental apparatus and

_procedure are reliable and should be applicable to the
MSBR fuel salt. The Hitec salt has been removed, the
system thoroughly flushed and dried by heating under

vacuum, and the MSBR fuel salt has been introduced.
No changes in the apparatus will be made.

Should irregular temperature profiles persist when the
fuel salt is reexamined, the next step will probably be
to lengthen the test section. The addition of a “calming
section” upstream of the electrodes would help estab-
lish a developed velocity profile in the salt before it is

heated, so that only the temperature profile would be

developing in the heated section. In the present test
section the temperature profile and the velocity profile
are developing simultaneously, and associated effects
cannot be easily separated and analyzed. ‘
Future plans with the fuel salt call for experiments
with spirally corrugated tubes for enhancement of heat
transfer. Experiments will also be performed using the
proposed MSBR coolant salt (NaF-NaBF,, 8-92 mole
%). o ‘

Agreement with published data for the solid is
gratifying since measurements’in the solid state using
the variable-gap technique are somewhat more difficult

‘than in the liquid state. The specimen must be melted

each time the gap thickness is changed. It is then
refrozen, and equilibrium is reestablished at the desired
temperature level. The procedure is therefore slow, 2
full week being required to obtain each value of thermal
conductivity. An additional problem relates to the
possibility of formation of a void as the specimen
contracts while passing from the liquid to the solid
phase. However, if the void is small and consistent in
shape and location, the measurements will not be
affected. On the other hand, if the void is large and
inconsistent, its effect on the results will be evident as
irregularities in the plot of thermal resistance vs
specimen thickness,

A typical plot of thermal res1stance vs thickness for
the MSBR fuel salt in the solid state at 447°C is shown
in Fig. 9.7. Note that the thermal conductivity is

- derived from the slope of this graph. The data are as

results, together with previous measurements, are shown

plotted vs temperature in Fig. 9.6.

The occurrence of a maximum value of thermal
conductivity, which is observed at about 700°C for
salt mixtures containing lithium fluoride, has been
observed also at lower temperatures by another in-
vestxgator for KNO3, AgNO;, KCNS, and NaHSO;.
Such a maximum is therefore not unreasonable. The
linearly decreasing conductivity of the solid from 300
to 450°C is typical of polycrystalline material. The
ratio of the liquid to solid conductivity at the melting
point for the MSBR fuel salt was found to be 0.84,
which agrees well with the average value of 0.86 £ 0.13
published for a group of salts.?

 

A. G. Turnbull, Australian J. Appl. Sci. 12(1), 327 (1961).

consistent as observed for measurement in the liquid
state, Furthermore, the resistance extrapolated to zero
specimen thickness is essentially the same as that for
the liquid measurements, indicating that the fixed
resistances (including gas ﬁlms surface COlTOSlOl’l ﬁlms
etc.) were unchanged.

‘Since the validity of the expenmental technique has
not been demonstrated thermal conductivity will be
measured for both the solid and liquid states, when
possible, for future MSBR salt mixtures. In addition to
the MSBR salts, a study will be made of binary salt
mixtures (probably LiF-BeF,) over a wide range of
compositions to develop correlations for estimating
conductivities of salts, hence reducing the need for
tedious and expensive experimental measurements.

to small circulating helium bubbles continuously in-

jected into and removed from the system.
Detailed design of this facility has now been com-

pleted (with the exception of a bubble separating

device), and assembly is about 50% complete. The only

significant ‘change from the initial concept is the

inclusion of provision for operation with the test
section either horizontal or vertical. Vertical orientation
appears necessary for operation at low and moderate
values of the Reynolds modulus to minimize the effect
of bubble stratification.- The analysis leading to this

- conclusion is presented in a later section,

Data needed for design of some of .the facility

components were obtained in several small-scale ¢orol- -
lary tests. These included tests on bubble generators
and bubble separators utilizing high-speed photographic -

techniques to ebserve the bubbles. For.example, to
generate the many uniform small-diameter bubbles
required in the MSBR application, devices were investi-
gated that introduce the gas through fine-mesh screen,

porous metal cylinders, fritted glass disks, and through
small holes into various throat positions of a variable-
area nozzle, It was determined that the variable-area
nozzle method being developed by Kedl'! provides the
most satisfactory performance.

Two types of bubble separators are bemg considered:
a swirl flow centripetal separator being developed by
Kedl'! and fine-mesh conical screens wet by the liquid
which act as physical barriers to the bubble. Compara-
tive data for these are still incomplete; conical screens
seem to provide good separation if the throughput flow
is kept low enough (e.g., about 1 gpmfin? for a
200-mesh screen). Bubbles smaller than the mesh
openings (~0.003 in.) are observed to penetrate the
screen, but very few of these small bubbles should be
present. While the centripetal separator also appears to
give good separation, certain control problems remain
to be solved, and such a device may have an undesirable
tendency to remove dissolved gases.

To characterize the size and distribution of the
bubbles, photographs have been made through a clear,
rectangular plastic box filled with a liquid having the
same refractive index as the glass conduit inside. A
Polaroid camera with diffuse back-lighting from a
Strobolume flash unit produced pictures having good
resolution for the range of bubble size of interest.
Figure 9.8 is an example of such a picture taken during
tests on a fritted glass disk bubble generator. The pipe
diameter is 1 in., and the speed of the bubbles about 10
fps.

To establish the range of parameters of interest (e.g.,
Reynolds and Schmidt moduli) over which the mass
transfer facility could be operated, the following
analysis was made to delineate the conditions con-

~ trolling dispersion of bubbles in a turbulent liquid.

‘A basic assumption in the analysis_is_that bubbles

-should remain dispersed if the ratio, F,/F of inertial

force to gravity force exerted on the bubble is large.
The gravity force is easy to determine, being simply the
weight of the displaced fluid,

are not so easily determined. Consequently, dimen-

Since Eq. (5) was established on dimenSional afgu-
ments, there will exist a proportionality constant of

‘unknown magnitude (thought to be of order of unity).

To establish the value that this ratio should have to
serve as a bubble dispersion criterion, use was made of
the data of Lamont and Scott,!? who measured mass
transfer coefficients from individual bubbles flowing
along with a turbulent liquid both horizontally and

vertically and in two conduits of different diameters.
The “critical dispersion point” is here taken to occur at
conditions for which the mass transfer coefficients for
the vertical and horizontal orientations become equal,
as given in Table 9.2, based on measurements by
Lamont and Scott.

Substitution of the data of case I into Eq. (5) using
consistent units gives

a reasonable value intuitively.
As a check, the data of case II are compared with
those of case I:

(F/ 11/6 ( )8[3 0.816 _ -
F/Fu (3 0“) /5/3 0831

which is very good agreement.
Therefore the final criterion suggested is that bubbles
should remain dispersed if

in any consistent system of units making the ratio
dimensionless, Comparison of this criterion with other
dispersion data has also shown good agreement.

By applying the dispersion criterion, Eq. (6), to the
He-O,-glycerol mass transfer experiment, the dashed
curve shown in Fig. 9.9 was obtained. Since the pump

assay of fuels with low uranium concentration, as in
MSBR fuels, because of their simplicity and reproduc-
ibility. Operation of the MSRE with 233U fuel afforded
the first major test of this application. The conditions
for the test were less favorable than with the 235U fuel,
because, in addition to the fact that the 233U concen-
tration was much lower than with 235U-238U fuel salt,
the amounts of carrier salt residues distributed between
the chemical reprocessing plant and the fuel system and
the amounts of uranium residues which remained in the
system after chemical reprocessing were not well
known. In an effort to unify the large amount of
information conceming the composition, uranium con-
centration in the fuel, and distribution of fuel salt in
the MSRE, a comprehensive material balance was
established. The results are summarized in Table 10.1.
The material balance data shown in Table 10.1
comprise the first comprehensive evidence of the fact
that the quantities of fuel salt and the concentrations of
its constituents are consistent with on-site estimates and
with the best estimates of the densities of the salt
throughout all MSRE operations. Many of the values
contained in Table 10.1 have been cited previously,
some in preliminary reports. The origin or significance
of other items merits the following explanatlon or
comment.

1. The amounts of fuel transferred to the flush salt
were estimated from the results of chemical analyses
(fluorometric and delayed neutron activation). From
these, results of uranium concentration in the flush salt
and weights of salt residues were computed. The masses
of flush residues were estimated to be less in proportion
to the relative densities of the two salts.

2. The weights of the salt given in items 2 to 5 were
measured accurately when the MSRE was initially
charged with salt. Items 8 and 10 were also measured
accurately.

3. The burnup rate is computed on the basis that the
MSRE operates at a full power rating of 8.0 Mw
(thermal) and that the total burnup rate of uranium is
1.24 g/Mwd.

4. Items 18 and 19 mdlcate that the total amount of
235U.233Y which is not assignable to operations
identified in Table 10.1 is 1.45 kg (0.063%). It is
anticipated that this figure will be validated later this
year, when uranjum is recovered from the NaF ab-
sorbers at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The
current values indicate a low probability that significant
amounts of uranium were either transferred to the
off-gas system or into the MSRE graphite moderator.

5. The mass of the 235U-238U heel, which was not
subjected to chemical reprocessing (item 13), was
inferred from isotopic dilution techniques and was

estimated from the best fit of analytical values for the
isotopic composition of the fuel salt at various stages of
preliminary operations of the reactor with 223U fuel
with compositions which would result from inclusion of
235238 residues (Table 10.2). The isotopic compo-
sition of the uranium in the heel was assumed to be
identical with the composition of the uranium speci-
mens which were removed from the NaF absorber beds
and analyzed.

6. When the MSRE fuel salt was initially constltuted
from "LiF-233UF, and "LiF-BeF,-ZrF,, its nominal
concentration was ’LiF-BeF,-Z1F,;-233UF,
(64.50-30.17-5.19-0.138 mole %) as compared with an
average value of its composition during run 14 of
TLiF-BeF, ZrF,-23%23%8UF, (64.07-29.95-5.15-0.819
mole %). If it is assumed that the quantity of carrier salt
to which the 33U concentrate was added was 4724 kg,
that the uranium charge was 38.3 kg (including extra
238YJ added) (item 22), and that the density of the fuel
at 650°C is 134 Ib/ft®, the nominal concentration of
uranium in the salt is 0.807 wt %. The results of
chemical analysis of the fuel salt show that the average
concentration has been approximately 1% higher, that
is, 0.815 wt %. The weight of the carrier salt reserved
for a forthcoming distillation experiment is known only
approximately.

Plans are under way to use 1sot0p1c dilution methods
to determine the quantity of carrier salt left in the fuel
processing tank for use in the distillation experiment.
The value of 113 kg given in Table 10.1, which is quite
uncertain, could be the cause of the difference between
the analytical and book concentration of uranium
presently in the fuel. If 175 kg were actually in the
drain tank, the total fuel charge in the reactor would be
nearly 4700 kg, which would make the book value
nearly identical with the analytical value. In addition,
the density of the fuel salt computed from the volumes
measured during drain-fill operations would be 132.3
Ib/ft®, which is the same as that measured in the
laboratory and reported in Sect. 12.9 of this report.

fuel circuit was rapid, even though zirconium metal was
used previously in chemical reprocessing operations in
sufficient amount to allow a small excess of unreacted
metal to remain with the reprocessed carrier salt. This
treatment was effective in reducing the chromium
_concentration of the carrier salt from 420 to 34 ppm.2
Evidently, little or no excess reductant remained in the
salt, for during the zero-power experiments in October
and November 1968, the concentration of Cr?* in the
fuel salt increased continuously until some 28 g (6.2

equivalents) of beryllium metal had been added to the
salt.

Generalized corrosion of the MSRE fuel circuitry, as
indicated by changes in the Cr2* concentration of the
fuel salt, has occurred somewhat more rapidly since the
beginning of run 15 than during previous runs. Since
salt was first circulated on September 14, 1968, its
chromium concentration has risen approximately 36
ppm, that is, from 34 to 70 ppm (Fig. 10.1). The
corrosion represented by this increase corresponds to
generalized removal of chromium from the walls of the
fuel loop to a depth of 0.23 mil.

fuel salt on four occasions during run 15 in anticipation

_be established (see Sect. 10.3). Surprisingly, the residue

which was found on and within the first capsule which
contained a beryllium rod was preponderantly iron,
with lesser amounts of nickel and chromium, The high
ratio of iron to chromium in the first residue is regarded
as a surprising development, for in reprocessing oper-
ations with the fuel carrier salt, concentrations of
chromium, iron, and nickel were reduced, respectively,
from 460 to 34,380 to 110, and 180 to <10 ppm.

If chromium was reduced as effectively as is indicated
by these analyses, we would have expected no iron to
be present, since most of the Fe?* produced by
fluorination should have been reduced to the metallic
state by the zirconium metal and hydrogen treatments
before ionic chromium was reduced. Such a conclusion
appears not to be well founded, for not only was the
iron-chromium ratio initially high, but corrosion of the
fuel circuit continued even after four reduction equiva-
lents (18 g of Be?) were introduced into the fuel salt.
We infer from the high fraction of chromium in the
second and third beryllium residues that the concen-
tration of Fe2* in the salt has become negligible and
that beryllium has acted to reduce U** and Cr?*
concurrently.

The MSRE fuel circuit was not subjected to compa-
rable corrosion during the zero-power experiments
which preceded full-power operations with 2357 fyel.
We must conclude therefore that the current corrosion
behavior is attributable to the current salt charge and to
the presence in it initially of some 3 g-atoms of iron as
Fe?*. |

During the initial étages of operations of the MSRE
with 233U fuel, niobium behaved in an unprecedented
manner. Previously, little niobium was found in salt
samples, but in the early stages of run 15, essentially all
of the niobium which was formed remained in the fuel
salt. The subsequent changes in niobium concentration
clearly reflect variations in the oxidation-reduction
potential of the fuel salt; these are described in Sect.
11.1.3 of this report. ' |
"It now becomes evident that because the relative free
energies of formation of the niobium and chromium

fluorides are close (—72.4 kcal per mole of F at 1000°K.

vs —75.2 kecal for NbFs and CrF, respectively), the
presence of niobium in the fuel signals the possibility
that chromium is being oxidized. The presence or
absence of niobium in the fuel salt is clearly related to
the U3*/ZU concentration ratio. An experimental basis
exists therefore for establishing the relationship more
. exactly, perhaps with sufficient precision-that in-line
determination of the niobium concentration in such
fuels can ultimately be integrated into reactor controls
technology.

10.3 ADJUSTMENT OF THE U3*/ZU
CONCENTRATION OF THE MSRE FUEL SALT

R.E.Thoma J.M.Dale

~On the basis that the oxidation potentials of chro-
mium and niobium differ only slightly in the MSRE
fuel salt, we have inferred that the U3*/ZU concen-
tration of the 233U fuel remained essentially nil until
after ~6.4 equivalents of Be® had been added to the
salt and that until then the fuel salt was slightly
oxidizing (see Sect. 11.1.3). Since that time an addi-
tional 8.57 g (1.90 equivalents) of beryllium has been
added to the fuel circuit salt, which contains 35.2 kg of
uranium. The U3*/ZU concentration of the fuel salt
was thereafter <1.26% as power operations began with
2337 fuel. Current results of chemical analysis of salt
specimens show that the concentration of Cr?* in the
fuel salt is now 70 ppm and that corrosion of the fuel
circuit has not increased detectably since power oper-
ations were initiated. By mid-February 1969, the MSRE
had generated ~4000 Mwhr with 233U fuel and had
thereby consumed ~200 g of uranium; hence, the U3+
fraction at that time was reduced to 0.8%. Adjustment
of the U3*/ZU balance will necessarily be more
frequent with 233U fuel than with 235U fuel because
of the relatively low inventory (38 kg as compared with
225 kg).

Attempts to measure the U3*/ZU concentration are
under way. More precise methods than the hydrogen-
HF transpiration technique, previously used, are re-
quired to analyze this concentration since the overall
quantity of UF; in the sample is low. For this purpose
a voltammetric method has been developed (see Sect.
14) and will be used in the very near future.

Introduction of beryllium metal into the 233U fuel
salt apparently caused a major perturbation of salt-gas
interactions and resulted in an increase in void fraction
in the fuel salt (see Sect. 1, “MSRE Operations™).
Initial considerations of this effect called for a review of
the probable U3*/ZU concentration during 23* U oper-
ations for comparison with current behavior and
pointed up the fact that previous estimates of U3*/ZU
concentrations® were slightly lower than originally
reported, since they were computed on the basis that
the maximum power generated by the MSRE was 7.25
rather than 8.0 Mw (thermal). A revised summary of
U3*/ZU concentrations throughout the MSRE power
history is shown in Table 10.3 and shows that at the
beginning of operations with 233U fuel the concentra-

tions of trivalent uranium were lower than at any time
during 235U operations but have been adjusted recently
to values which are typical of those present during run
14. Adjustment of the U3*/ZU ratio to its curmrent
value of ~1% did not reduce the void fraction of the
fuel salt perceptibly. That the concentration of trivalent
uranium is intrinsically related to the generation of
voids in the salt does not therefore appear to be
warranted. The contrast in the appearance of the
nickel-beryllium rod assemblies seems to provide a more
useful clue to the cause of bubble generation. While -
none of these cages appeared to be wetted by the salt
during 235U operations, each of those removed after
treatment of the 233U salt showed evidence that salt
had wetted the nickel cage and had adhered to it. A
typical example is shown in Fig. 10.2. The presence of
bubbles is suggested by the appearance of the upper
part of capsule FP17-8 (Fig. 10,3), on which the relic
structures of collapsed bubbles seem to be visible. We
must conclude that major changes in the salt-metal
interfacial tensions were induced as transient behavior
and were highly localized. Such behavior apparently
had no counterpart in 235U operations.

Numerous causes may be cited in 3peculat10n as to
the cause of the increased void fraction. For example,
the 233U fuel salt density is some 5% less than the
235U salt; the lower density, coupled with a slight
reduction in the interfacial tension of this salt, might
allow the spray ring jets to generate smaller bubbles
which conceivably could be driven sufficiently deep
into the pump bowl salt to be entrained in the pump
discharge. While the reason for the changes in salt-gas
behavior are not known, a variety of plausible models
are thus plentlful and are amenable to future tests.

10.4 EXAMINATION OF SIMULATED MSRE
FUEL MIXTURE FOR FOAM-PRODUCING
PROPERTIES o

J. H Shaffer W.R. Grimes

- Following the refueling operations of the MSRE to
replace 235U with 233U, the reactor system has
experienced some irregularities in its performance.?
Although the cause of these irregularities has not been

“identified, the results can be explained by increased

foam production at the fuel-gas interface in the pump
bowl. The purpose of an experiment now in progress is

to examine specific chemical operations performed on

the MSRE fuel mixture and their possible contnbutlon
to foam production.

Fig. 10.3. Top of Nickel Cage—Beryllium Rod Assembly No. FP17-8 After Exposure to MSRE Fuel Salt for 12 hr.

This experiment is being conducted with approxi-
mately 12.5 kg of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF,
(64.8-30.0-5.0-0.25 mole %) contained in a nickel vessel
(10 in, diameter by 8 in.) to a depth of about 5 in.
Penetrations in the top plate provide for the insertion
of a sparge gas tube, two salt level sensing probes, a
reference electrode assembly, and a salt sampling port.

The experimental objective has focused on the partial
reduction of tetravalent uranium to its trivalent state by
reaction with beryllium metal inserted into the pump
bowl.

Since this is the principal chemical operation per-
formed in the MSRE pump bowl, its possible contri-

bution to foam production is suspected. The experi-
mental procedure has examined the fluoride mixture at
600°C in the as-prepared condition, at intervals during
the reduction of essentially all the uranium to its
trivalent state, and after subsequent stepwise oxidation
of the mixture with nickel fluoride. Tests for foam
production consisted in measurements of the salt level
while sparging with argon at flow rates of up to 2
liters/min. Argon was admitted through a % -in.-diam
sintered-nickel disk that closed the end of a nickel tube
inserted to within % in. of the bottom of the vessel.
Melt levels were determined by the abrupt change in
electrical resistance noted as the insulated nickel rods

made contact with the salt mixture. Without exception,
these tests showed no immediate increase in the salt
level (<% ¢ in.)) that would be attributed to the gas
sparge operations. Only discontinuous:shorting of the
probes (at % ¢ in. above the salt level) by salt splashing
was noted. '

The insertion of beryllium rods into the salt mixture

did result in the reduction of zirconium metal. In earlier

development tests, when the reactor fuel mixture
contained approximately 0.8 mole % uranium, the rapid
reduction of uranium precluded observations of zirco-
nium reduction. While this phenomenon may not exist
in the turbulent, high-flow conditions of the reactor
pump bowl, the lower uranium concentration of the
present fuel mixture appears to have a pronounced
effect on its rate of reduction. Subsequent reductions
of uranium during this test were achieved by reaction
with zirconium metal rods in place of beryllium.

This experiment also provided an opportunity for
evaluation of a reference electrode assembly currently
being developed for rapid analysis of fluoride melts for
trivalent uranium. A nickel—nickel oxide—beryllium
oxide reference electrode, currently under development
by Hitch and Baes,® was inserted into the melt to
follow the reduction process. Stable voltages were read
at the various reduction intervals. However, their

137

relation to trivalent uranium concentrations could not

be accurately established.

Although no confirmation of foam production has
been realized to date, the experimental program will
examine other techniques for forming salt-gas emulsions
and other possible chemical phenomena which may be
responsible for the observed behavior of the reactor.

10.5 FOAMING BEHAVIORIN
MOLTEN SALTS

H.W.Kohn F.F, Blankenship

Molten-salt foams were studied in a glass apparatus

contained in a special fumnace. Purified argon was

introduced through a coarse glass frit at the bottom,
and visual observations were supplemented, when de-
sirable, with high-speed photography. Qur most signifi-
cant observation throughout these experiments is that
we were unable to promote the development of stable
foams in clean melts. All of the additives which we
might reasonably suspect to be in the pump bowl, that
is, carbon dust, graphite powder, beryllium metal,
finely divided metallic nickel, and pump oil vapor, were
found to be incapable of promoting foams in a
vigorously bubbling melt. Melts of lithium fluoro-
beryllate and of MSRE fuel salt were studied, and their
behavior was found to be essentially the same.

Foams were formed only by introducing enough
water into the melt, either in the sweep gas or by
adding solid hydrates, to give a definite cloudiness.
Even so the foam would collapse in less than a minute
when the sweep gas was cut off. Simply adding solid
oxide as BeO or as Li;CO; (= Li; O + CO,, probably
followed by Li, O + BeF, = 2LiF + BeQ) failed to
produce foams. This mode of addition fails to produce
either the proper state of subdivision or wetting since
the particles appear “clumpy” rather than evenly
distributed in the melt. '

Conditions which cause wetting of the glass container
also cause a .marked change in the appearance and
behavior of the bubbles. An originally wetting melt will
produce small, slightly flattened bubbles 2 to 3 mm in
diameter. A short treatment with SiF, converts this to
a nonwetting melt, and the bubbles rapidly change to
large disk-shaped objects greater than a centimeter in
diameter but less than 2 or 3 mm thick. Adding
beryllium metal to such a melt makes it wetting again
toward the glass and gives more nearly spherical (but
still rather large) bubbles. None of these melts will form
a foam.

11. Fission Product Behavior

11.1 FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR
"IN THE MSRE

11.1.1 Examination of Graphite
Surveillance Specimens

F.F.Blankenship  S.S. Kirslis

Most of the results of the postirradiation examination
of the third long-term surveillance assembly, removed
from the MSRE on March 25, 1968, have been reported
previously.! A few additional examinations of the
graphite specimens are described below.

Salt-exposed surfaces of five graphite specimens
(pyrolytic, Poco, CGB, doubly exposed CGB, and
impregnated CGB graphite) were examined by x-ray

_diffraction. Only graphite lines were observed in the

pattern, as was previously observed for electron diffrac-
tion, although appreciable quantities of molybdenum
were found on the graphite surfaces by spectrographic
analysis.

Samples of the same five graphite specimens were
mounted and polished for autoradiographic and metal-
lographic examination. The autoradiographs were very
similar to those from previously exposed graphite
specimens, showing a thin surface region of intense
radioactivity with irregular penetrations toward the
interior. In the deep interior there was much less
activity, with sizable concentration differences between
adjacent regions. The pyrolytic graphite specimen
showed penetrations of high activity along straight
cracks parallel to the graphite planes. These observa-
tions are consistent with the previously reported radio-
chemical results, which indicated considerable varia-
tions in concentration profiles between different faces
of the same specimens of graphite. These profile
variations were confirmed by D. R. Cuneo’s results on
smaller samples. The previous conclusion is thus con-
firmed that there are sizable local variations in graphite

porosity in all the types of graphite listed except

pyrolytic graphite, and that these porosity variations

affect significantly the diffusion of activities from the
salt interface into the graphite interior.

After rough polishing, metallographic exammatlon of
the five graphite specimens yielded results like those on
previous surveillance specimens: there was no indication
of chemical damage nor of surface films, and the

graphite structures showed no changes. Difficulties were

experienced in polishing the specimens to the degree
required for high-quality metallographs.

11.1.2 Distribution of Fission Products
in the MSRE
F.F. Blankenship  S. S. Kirslis

In the previously reported material balance® for
fission products in the MSRE, the values for the
percentages of inventory dep031ted on Hastelloy N
surfaces were based on an estimate® of 1.2 X 10° ¢cm
for the area of metal wetted by the fuel salt. A recent

" more detailed calculation* indicates that the wetted

138

metal area is actually 0.79 X 10° cm?. Thus the
previously reported values for percent deposition on
metal should be corrected by the factor 0.79/1.2, or
0.66. It should also be mentioned that no correction
was made for the probably sizable effect of fuel
turbulence® in different regions of the fuel circuit. The
measured values of disintegrations per minute per square

-centimeter of metal remain unchanged.

of atoms existing at the time in question which have
resulted from the fission history of the reactor. It is
convenient to divide the total activity by the mass of
salt containing the fission fuel, yielding a nominal
activity at the time in question per gram of circulating

salt. Mixing with residual salt by transfer to the drain

tank is taken into account. Calculations are updated to
appropriate reference times, frequently sample time or
shutdown time. In general such calculations do not
imply any particular fate for given isotopes.

Power operation of MSRE on 235U extended from
January 23, 1966, to March 25, 1968. The fuel was
subsequently transferred to the drain tanks and there
subjected to chemical processing,® including fluorine
treatment, hydrogen—hydrogen fluoride sparging, and
reduction with zirconium metal.

We computed? fission product inventories from the
power history up to the end of 235U operation in such
a way, using one- or two-element decay ‘chains?
assuming that it was not necessary to take into
consideration the interaction of fission products with
neutrons, and that removal of fuel from the system by
sampling, etc., was negligible.

Examination of data from salt samples taken after
processing, August to September 1968, confirmed that
the final zirconium metal reduction treatment had
removed all the ®3Nb activity, and the activity of **Nb
in the salt was consistent with the ingrowth from °% Zr
after this time (see Sect. 11.1.4). Consequently, the
inventory of °SNb was calculated based on this

assumption. The inventory of a number of fission

product isotopes at the end of runs 14,15, and 16 and
at the beginning of run 15 are shown in Table 11.1,
Fission yields were taken from the data assembled by
Bell,? and half-lives were taken from the current Table

of Isotopes.’® Power history, not directly obtainable -

from the MSRE computer at this time, was read from
the nuclear power chart.

. Computer programs were developed for the appropri-
7 ate compression of such data and for the calculation of

fission product inventories and decay rates. These were

- written in BasicII and were run on the locally avzulable |

C-A-C time-sharing computer.

11.1.4 Response of 5 Nb Activity to
Fuel Redox Chemistry

E.L.Compere E.G. Bohlmann

During the 23°U operation of the MSRE (through
run 14) freeze-valve samples of the fuel salt consistently
showed that the ®°Nb daughter of °°Zr was not
appreciably present in the salt. Data from samples taken
during the processing of the carrier salt prior to
operation with 233U showed appreciable *>Nb was
present after fluorination, but this was removed by the
reducing treatment with zirconium metal early in
September 1968. During the preparatory and critical
operations in run 15, however, the *>Nb formed from
95 Zr decay remained dissolved in the salt. That this was
due to the salt being in an unexpectedly oxidizing
condition was shown by an unusually high corrosion
rate, evidenced by increasing Cr®* concentration in the
early part of run 15. Additions of Be? (6.2 equivalents)
designed to inhibit this corrosion accomplished that
objective and also resulted in the disappearance of the
®$Nb from the salt, as shown in Fig. 11.1.

At this time, other considerations necessitated ho-
mogenization of the salt in the circulating loop with an
~8% heel in the drain tank. As shown in the figure,
subsequent freeze-valve samples again show that sub-
stantial percentages of the niobium inventory (based on
power history) are again dissolved in the salt, although
the Cr** concentration appears stabilized. Apparently
the oxidant in the heel was just sufficient to reoxidize
the Nb (NbF;), but not to make the melt corrosive.
Addition of two more equivalents of Be® on January
24, 1969, again caused the niobium to leave the melt.

The niobium percentages were generally lower in runs
16 and 17, compared with run 15. However, the scatter
of the data — including that of salt-stable ®* Zr — makes
the significance of this questionable. Such behavior
could be caused by partially irreversible interaction
metal, graphite, or gas. The response of
the niobium chemistry to the oxidizing state of the
melt will be followed carefully in continued MSRE
operations in view of possible uses as a redox indicator.
After several thousand megawatt-hours of operation
sufficient niobium is present (~0.03 mole) to offer a

11.1.5 MSRE Off-Gas Analyzer-Sampler

E.L.Compere J.L.Rutherford

The MSRE off-gas sampler, which is downstream
from the particle trap and ~45 min flow from the
pump bowl, was modified* ! prior to run 15. The major
change involved replacement of the chemical absorbers
for H,O and CO, with a dry molecular sieve (Linde
13X) absorber. This was done because decomposition

of the wet magnesium perchlorate absorber material,
due to radiation, evolved gases which gave erroneous
off-gas impurity measurements. The molecular sieve
trap was installed downstream from the heated CuO
bed which serves to oxidize hydrocarbon constituents
of the gas. The absorber, which may be heated, retains
water even at temperatures of 300°C. Carbon dioxide is
retained up to about 200°C. Thus hydrocarbon in the
gas may be measured by the effect of absorbing its
oxidation products. '
Adequate reliability and sensitivity of the thermal
conductivity cells were demonstrated by conducting

calibration tests with helium containing ~600 pg of
CsH,; o per standard liter. A second standard gas was
employed containing 120 ug of methane per liter, 240
ug of isobutane per liter, 49 ppm krypton, and 48 ppm
xenon; such levels (except for excess methane) are in-
the range of anticipated off-gas compositions. This gas
was used to study the effects of variations in our
operating parameters. Variations of test gas flow rates
between 25 and 125 cc/min had little effect. Cupric
oxide bed temperatures of 1200, 1350, 1400, and
1450°F were employed. Upper temperatures of the
CuO are limited by decomposition into Cu,O .and
oxygen, which is noticeable at 1350°F and appreciable
at 1450°F. However, only isobutane was oxidized at
1200°F, and a temperature of ~1450°F, or possibly
higher, is required to oxidize all methane. We chose a
CuO operating temperature of 1350°F in order to
oxidize all the hydrocarbons (including much of the
methane) and to keep the amount of oxygen being
evolved from the CuO bed at a tolerable level.

Tests of MSRE off-gas (at operation power >50 w)

'show hydrocarbon levels ranging between 100 and 300

ug per standard liter (~0.5 to 1.5 g/day). Substantially
higher values have been noted after returning from
standby to on-line operation; these values declined to
the above steady-state range in several hours. Preceding
each MSRE run, after transfer of salt from the drain
tank to the circulating system, high and slowly de-
clining levels of nonoxidizable impurity in the off-gas
were noted. This impurity is believed to be argon,
purging from the less accessible regions of the drain
tank.

High quantities of impurities were noted in the off-gas
during the drain following run 15. These were mostly
oxidizable by CuO at 1350°F and were absorbable on
the room-temperature molecular sieve absorber, and
thereby hydrocarbon. However, about 10% of the
impurity was not oxidized. Mass spectrographic analysis
(Table 11.2, sample 28) indicated this material to be
methane. Methane is a known product of hydrocarbon

cracking and requires CuQ temperatures appreciably
above 1350°F for complete oxidation. |

Hydrocarbon levels of 4 to 10 g/day in the reactor
off-gas were observed during the tests using a motor-
generator set to vary pump speed. These high levels
occurred shortly after the pump was restarted after
being off for a short time and did not persist. A parallel
increase in unabsorbable products was evident (ranging
from 200 to 400 ppm).

During MSRE operations at megawatt power levels, a
flow restriction of the lines leading to the off-gas
sampler developed regularly, resulting in loss of flow in
about a day. Prior operation at the end of run 14 gave
similar behavior. During the recent period of operation
of the reactor at low power with the pump off for
several days (thermal convection operation), no plug-
ging occurred. The restriction, which was found to

“occur in line 537, can be best relieved by blowing 40 psi

helium back and then forward through the line.

A sample of reactor off-gas was taken directly for
mass spectrographic analysis during a period of low-
power (50 w) operation. This sample (Table 11.2, sample
27) showed 0.18% water, about 0.05% air, and ~0.01%
hydrocarbons, which were mostly methane. Most of
these impurities, except possibly the hydrocarbons, are
believed to have been acquired extraneously, though
appropriate preevacuation and flushing techniques were
used. A value of 0.01% methane corresponds to 70
ugfliter, or about 0.4 g/day, which is of the same
magnitude as values indicated by thermal conductivity
analysis reported above.

_ As the standard gas mixture was first diverted through

the absorber after passing through the heated CuO bed,
krypton and xenon in the mixture broke through the
absorber at different times, which produced “steps” in
the thermal conductivity curves, thus offering the
possibility of being able to use a frontal analysis
technique to examine the reactor off-gas. In addition,
krypton and xenon, if present, should appear as an
impurity in the helium after passing through the
absorber. A steady-state concentration of approxi-
mately 75 ppm combined kryptons and xenons should
be developed in the reactor off-gas at full power (8
Mw). However, except for some unabsorbable con-
taminants observed for approximately three days which
could have been 50 to 125 ppm krypton and xenon, we
have not detected such impurities in the helium using
the thermal conductivity cells, though these fission
gases have been found by mass spectrographic analysm
(Table 11.2, samples 22, 23, 29).

Mass spectrographic analysis has been obtained on
several samples of off-gas taken during power operation.

Data are given in Table 11.2. Samples 22 and 23 were
isolated between valves in line 518 during run 14 and
nine months later, after decay of all short-lived iso-
topes, were collected at liquid-nitrogen temperatures on
the molecular sieve, subsequently reheated, and trans-
ferred to the sample bottle. A third sample isolated -
during run 14 was lost due to a leaking nylon valve tip.
Sample 29 was isolated between valves in line 518 in
late February 1969 (run 17) during a period of
full-power operation, subsequently transferred to the
low-temperature molecular sieve, and thence to the
sample bottle.

The procedure of co]]ectmg the sample on a low-
temperature molecular sieve permits removal of much
of the helium and some of the hydrogen in the sample,
while reheating transfers most of the remaining material
to the sample bottle. Thus an appreciable concentration
effect is obtained.

The samples taken during power operation of the
reactor were of interest particularly because of the
ratios of isotopes of fission product krypton and xenon.
Generally the ratios are consistent with relative fission
product yields for the fuel used. Values for 13! Xe and
132Xe, which have longer-lived precursors, are below
steady-state values indicated by *3*Xe and ! *®Xe.

The ratio 136Xe/'3%Xe is of particular interest
because neutron absorption by !3°Xe should result in
an increase in the proportion of 13®Xe. The yield ratio
for 233U fission is 0.801,” and samples 22 and 23 had
ratios of 0.814 and 0.808 respectively. For 232U fission
the yield ratio® is 1.118, and sample 29 had a ratio of
1.115. The ratios clearly reflect which fuel was in_the

‘reactor; closer interpretation will require consideration

of the system history when each sample was taken.
Total yields of kryptons were low, doubtless because
of the relatively small samples, 500 to 1500 cc, isolated
between valves in line 518 in these samples. A more
concentrated sample is needed to improve accuracy,

~and longer periods of steady operation prior to sam-
pling should assist in reaching a steady state. The more
concentrated samples can be obtained straightforwardly

by passing the off-gas over heated CuQO and through the
absorber and collecting a suitable amount on the
low-temperature molecular sieve,

11.1.6 Examination of Material Recovered
from MSRE Off-Gas Line

E.L.Compere

At the end of run 16 a restriction existed in the
off-gas line (line 522) near the pump, which had

 
 

 

144

developed since the line was reamed after run 14.!? To
clear the line and recover some of the material for
examination, a reaming tool with a hollow core was
attached to flexible metal tubing. This was attached to
a “May pack” case and thence to a vacuum pump

vented into the off-gas system, The May pack case held -

several screens of varied aperture and a filter paper. The
specialized absorbers normally a part of the May pack
assembly were not used.

The tool satisfactorily opened the off-gas line. A small
amount of blackish dust was recovered on the filter
paper and from the flexible tubing.

Analysis of the residue on the filter paper is shown in
Table 11.3. The total amount of each element or

isotope was determined and compared with the amount

-~ of “inventory” fuel salt that should contain or had

produced such a value.

The constituent elements of the fuel salt appear to be
present in quantities indicating 4 to 7 mg of fuel salt on
the filter paper, as do the isotopes 14°Ba, !**Ce, and
95Zr, which usually remain with the salt. It is note-
worthy that 233U is in this group, indicating that it was
transported only as a salt constituent and that the salt
was largely from runs 15 and 16.

The isotopes 8°Sr, 'Y, and '37Cs, which have
noble-gas precursors, are present in significantly greater
proportions, consistent with a mode of transport other
than by salt particles.

The “noble metal” isotopes **Nb, ??Mo, }°¢Ru, and
129mTe were present in even greater proportions,
indicating that they were transported more vigorously
than fuel salt. Comparison with inventory is straight-

forward in the case of 2.79-day Mo and 34-day
129mTe. since much of the inventory was formed in
runs 15 and 16. In the case of 367-day ! °6Ru, although
a major part of run 14 material remains (somewhere),
salt samples during runs 15 and 16 have shown little to
be present in the salt; if only the 1°Ru produced by
233 fission is taken into account, the relative sample
value is high, £

The fuel processing, completed September 7, 1968,
appeared to have removed substantially all ®*Nb from
the salt. Inventory is consequently taken as that
produced by decay of ®*Zr from run 14 after this time
and that produced in runs 15 and 16 (see Sect. 11.1.4
of this report). Thus the “noble metal” elements appear
to be present in the material removed from the off-gas
line in considerably greater proportion than other
materials. It would appear that they had a mode of
transport different from the first two groups above,
though they may not have been transported all in the
same way.

There remains 8.05-day !3'I. The examination!?
after run 14 of the jumper section of the off-gas line
found appreciable 1311, which may have been trans-
ferred as 30-hr *3!™Te. In the present case essentially
all the 31 inventory came from a short period of high
power near the end of run 15. Near-inventory values

were found in salt sample FP 164, taken just prior to

the end of run 16. Thus it appears that the value found
here indicates little ' 31 transferred except as salt.

11.2 FISSION PRODUCT VOLATILIZATION
TESTS

S.S.Kirslis  F. F. Blankenship

A large number of hot-cell and laboratory tests have
been carried out in an effort to characterize more
precisely the nature of the process by which fission
products “volatilize” from the surface of highly radio-
active MSRE fuel salt. This basic information is needed
in order to predict with some reliability the behavior to
be expected in the MSBR off-gas system. _

Results were reported previously!® from two series of
hot-cell tests in which helium was passed slowly over

the surface of molten MSRE fuel salt and then through

chemical traps or probes which were later sectioned and
radiochemically analyzed. Also reported in detail was

one of the tests in the fourth series in which particulate

matter from the effluent helium was collected on
electron microscope screens and identified as fuel salt

particles and aggregates varying in diameter from 35 A
to several microns. The discussion of the other tests in
the third and fourth series will be organized under test
type. The third series comprised ten tests carried out
one to eight days after installing a fresh 50-g sample of
MSRE fuel salt (FP14-62) in the reaction vessel. The
series was terminated by a furnace failure which ruined
the reaction vessel. The fourth series included 16 tests
carried out 5 to 75 days after placing a fresh 50-g
sample of MSRE fuel salt in a copper capsule (FP14-69)
in the reaction vessel. Failure of a temperature con-
troller caused the melting of the copper capsule after
the eighth test (26th day). Fewer radiochemical analy-
ses were obtained on subsequent tests. The top of the
reaction vessel for the third and fourth series was of
larger size (% in. ID) than for the first two series to
permit the insertion of the larger test assemblies
required for some of the runs.

The results of the third and fourth series of tests are
given in detail in Tables 11.4 and 11.5. The main
conclusions to be drawn from this mass of data will be
given in the following text.

11.2.1 Chemical Probe Tests

In these tests dry helium was passed at 10 cc/min for
50 min over the surface of the molten fuel salt at 600°C,
then up through a chemical probe tube whose entrance
was ¥, to Y% in. above the salt surface. The probe tube
contained a 4-u Felt Metal filter and 1-in.-long sections
of NaF and soda lime. In the first two tests of series I11,
both run one day after salt sampling, the Felt Metal
filter appeared to plug, causing a rapid rise in system
pressure to 5 psig and a decrease in flow to below 5
cc/min. Correspondingly, the activities found in all
sections of the probes were lower by about an order of
magnitude than in the similar series II tests. Curiously,

‘the 132Te and '2°Te activities were higher than in the

series II tests. The third series III test, run eight days
after salt sampling, showed normal flow behavior, and
the activities behaved as in the series II tests, except
that distinctly higher amounts of the tellurium isotopes
were found in all probe sections by factors of 100 to
1000. ~

Three series IV tests were carried out before the
temperature controller failed: the first 5 days, the

second 17 days, and the third 26 days after the fuel salt

sample (FP14-69) was taken. When the activities were

~calculated back to the fuel sampling time, the results of
‘all three tests were fairly similar and also matched the
-results of the series II tests. The tellurium isotopes did

not behave exceptionally as they did in the series III
tests. '

 
 

 

The observation that the results of the series I tests
and the three series IV tests agreed so well (within a
rather wide experimental scatter) deserves comment. It
should first be realized that if it is assumed that the
volatilization behavior varies linearly with the total beta
activity of the fuel salt, no large differences would be
expected in these experiments. The total beta power of
MSRE fuel salt decreases only by a factor of 2 from 1
day after sampling to 12 days after sampling. A
decrease of another factor of 2 would require another

146

100 days of decay. Since the series II tests were
performed 1 day after sampling and the series IV tests
5, 17, and 26 days after sampling, the results would be
expected to agree within a factor of 2 or 3, which is less
than the experimental scatter. It thus appears that the
most convenient way to investigate the effect of beta
activity on volatilization rate would be to add a large
amount of a short-lived beta emitter such as 21 Sr to the
reaction vessel.

Second, the agreement between the results for the
short-lived (77-hr) 132Te for the series II tests (1-day-
old salt) and for the series IV tests (5-, 17-, and
26-day-old salt), when all the activities were calculated
back to the time of sampling, implies that the volatili-
zation rate was proportional to the total amount of
132Te in the reaction vessel. The less-reliable results for
short-lived ®?Mo support a similar conclusion. In future
tests, other short-lived nuclides (*43Ce, 23?Np, 111 Ap)
will be sought, since it is of practical significance to
determine the dependence of volatilization rate on
concentration. : : :

Two more chemical probe tests were carried out after
the temperature controller failed, causing the reaction
vessel temperature to rise above the melting point of
the copper capsule (1060°C). The amounts of noble
metals volatilized decreased by about a factor of 100.
The quantities of most salt-seeking nuclides found in
the probes were low by a factor of about 10, but the
quantities of 225U were normal. The analysis of a salt
sample taken after the temperature rise showed concen-

trations of all nuclides except ®5 Nb similar to those in a
sample taken 6 days after salt sampling. No **Nb was
found in the 45-day-old sample. Likewise, no 5Nb was
found in the last chemical probe. These results suggest
that the inadvertent heating of the reaction vessel to
about 1060°C caused the noble metals to assume a less
volatile form and also interfered with the formation of
a fuel salt mist.

The analyses of the remaining salt and the reaction
vessel liner after the third hot-cell test have several
features of interest. The activities per gram of 12°Te,
103Ru, and !°6Ru were distinctly higher in the top %
in. of the salt than in the remainder, and more of these
activities deposited on the liner than remained in the
salt. The behavior of 9°Nb was apparently different,
with a sizable fraction remaining in the salt phase.
However, in this case **Nb was being formed by decay
of ?5Zr in the frozen salt during the 34 days between
the end of the third hot-cell test and the analytical
separation of ®3Nb. Thus the **Nb concentration in
the salt at the end of the third test was probably low, as

was also sizable deposition of °>Nb on the liner walls.
The fission products with stable fluorides showed
normal concentrations in the fuel and low deposition
on the liner walls.

11.2.2 Electric Charge of the Radioactive
Aerosols

The particles of most aerosols are electrically charged,
with equal numbers of positively and negatively charged
particles. One theory of formation of aerosols such as
we have observed would require both the metallic and
salt particles to be positively charged with respect to
the helium environment. It was thus of interest to
determine whether our aerosols would collect preferen-
tially on charged electrodes in the gas space above

‘radioactive molten salt. In such experiments voltages in
- excess of 1000 v are usually applied to the electrodes.

This was not easily accomplished in a hot cell, so we
compromised by using a voltage of 90 v obtained by
connecting four 22%-v batteries in series. The test
assembly included the usual chemical probe tube
(containing a filter and chemical traps) at ground
potential and two Y%-in.-diam stainless steel rods as
electrodes connected to the batteries. The electrodes
and the probe were held in place ' in. from each other
and insulated from each other and from the probe tube
by a Lavite spacer 2 in. from the bottom and by a
rubber stopper about 6 in. from the bottom of the
probe and electrodes. The three chemical probe tests of
series III and the first two of series IV were run with
electrodes of this type in position.

The activities deposited on the electrodes and on the
outside of the chemical probe were leached off with 2
N HNO,, and the leaches were analyzed radiochemi-
cally for 12 isotopes and for 235U by delayed-neutron
counting. '

The results showed that equal amounts of each
activity deposited on both electrodes and that a slightly
larger amount (usually) was found on the outside of the
grounded probe tube, whose exposed area was twice
that of each electrode. While this experiment would
have been more definitive if larger voltages had been
used, the indication was that the aerosol particles
carried no charge of either sign.

11.2.3 Electron Microscope Tests

Attempts were made by two methods to collect
aerosol particles which could be examined and identi-
fied with the electron microscope. In the first method,
helium was passed over the molten fuelsalt surface,

148

then up a Y%-in-diam nickel tube 12 in. long to a
Millipore filter which had been coated with a thin
evaporated carbon film. Five runs of this type were
made with helium flow rates varying from 15 to 100
cc/min and flow durations from 1 to 4 hr. The Millipore
filter was dissolved away from the carbon film, which
was then picked up on electron microscope screens and
examined. Very little particulate matter was found by
electron microscope examination of these specimens.
Two of the larger particles were identified by electron
diffraction as graphite and one large particle as metallic
nickel. The bulk of the foreign particles were in the
micron size range, were rounded in shape, and tended
to form chains. They did not yield a satisfactory
diffraction pattern and thus could not be identified. No
particles had the appearance of the fuelsalt particles
jdentified by the first run of the second collection
method. Apparently most of the latter particles were
deposited along the length of the 12-in.long tube which
carried the helium out of the reaction vessel to the
Millipore filter holder.

The second collection method, involving direct depo-
sition of aerosol particles on electron microscope
screens positioned just above the fuel salt, and the
results of its first run were described in detail in the
previous report.!> Four subsequent runs by the same
method were carried out but failed to yield satisfactory
specimens for examination. Only small fragments of the
thin carbon film on the electron microscope screens
were found to have survived intact after the exposure,
the removal from the screen holder in the hot cell, the
packing of the screens into individual bottles provided
with miniature desiccators, and the transport of the
bottles- to the electron microscope. No really satis-
factory collections of particles could be found by
electron microscopic examinations of the few surviving
scraps of carbon film. It is believed that most of the
handling problems which destroyed the carbon films

may be solved by transferring the screens directly from

the screen holder through a small funnel into small
plastic—pill capsules whose rounded shape will allow

only the edges of the flat carbon-coated screens to

touch the inner capsule surface. It is clear that the

_ handling problems are not insuperable, since three of

the six screens from the first run by this method were
recovered in satisfactory condition.

11.2.4 Aerosol Deposition from a Helium
Stream

One of the standard methods for determining particle
size and its distribution in aerosols is to measure the
 

 

 

149

deposition gradient along the walls of a tube through
which the aerosol flows. If the aerosol contains particles
of a uniform size, the diffusion coefficient of the
particles can be calculated from the deposition gradient
according to the equation:'* '

Alogn, _5.00D
& g

where n; is the number of particles deposited per unit
length, z is the distance from the channel entrance, D is
the diffusion coefficient of particles in the carrier gas,
and Q is the volumetric flow rate. In the derivation of
this equation it is assumed that the particles stick to the
wall when ‘they collide with it. From the diffusion
coefficient the particle size may be estimated.

Two experiments were performed from which values
of D could be estimated. In the first, helium was passed
at 15 cc/min for 18 hr over the surface of the molten
MSRE fuel salt with the gas exiting through a %;-in.-OD
nickel tube 12 in. long. The nickel tube was connected
to a coil of %-in.-OD copper tubing 100 ft long. The
nickel and copper tubes were then disconnected and

- brought out of the hot cell. The exterior surfaces were

decontaminated with a nitric acid wash, the tubes were
sectioned, and the interior surface of each length of
tubing was leached free of activity. The nickel tube was
sectioned into lengths, starting at the inlet end, of 1, 2,
4, and 5 in. Each section was leached with 2 N HNO,
containing a little HCl. The leaches were analyzed
radiochemically for.the usual 12 nuclides and for 22°U
by delayed-neutron counting. The long length of copper
tubing was cut into lengths of 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 25, and
40 ft. It was leached first with NH,OH, then HCI, and
finally with HNO;. No radiochemical analyses were
performed on these leaches, since gamma spectrometer
scans showed that all of the activity was !3*I. Even
after chemically removing 99.9% of the '3'], the
gamma scans showed only * 3! activity remaining.

The nickel tube leaches also contained predominantly

1311 activity, which complicated the accurate measure-
ment of other activities. Most of the latter were on the -
1- and 2-in. sections on the inlet end. Reliable analyses

- of the other two sections could not be made. On the

basis of these rather uncertain data, the noble metal

activities per inch of tube generally dropped by a factor
. of about 6 and the salt-seeking species showed no

appreciable change in going from a z value of 0.5 in. to

 

~ 14p ‘L. Bennett, W. C. Hinds, and R. E. Adams, Development

of lodine Characterization Sampler for Application in Humid
Environments, ORNL-TM-2071, p. 21 (May 1, 1968). '

one of 2 in. Thus D calculated from the equation given
above is about 0.01 for the noble metals and very small
for the salt-seeking nuclides. No conclusions regarding
aerosol behavior can be drawn from the analytical
results for '3[, since it probably traveled as gaseous HI
(or possibly CH3I) produced by the hydrolysis of the
molten salt by traces of water in the dried helium
stream. It is clear that this gaseous iodine species did
not behave as an aerosol particle and in particular that
it did not stick to the wall on the first collision with it.

A second similar test was carried out on the % -in.-OD
nickel tube 12 in. long used as the helium exit tube for
the first Millipore filter run. This tube was removed
from the reaction vessel after helium had flowed for
3'%, hr at 15 cc/min. The tube was put through the
same leaching and sectioning procedures used for the
nickel tube from the long-copper-tube run. The analyses
were again complicated by high 3!l activities, but
somewhat more satisfactory results were obtained.
Again the noble metals showed a decrease in activity
per inch of tube from the inlet to the outlet, while the
salt-seeking species showed little change. Diffusion
coefficients in square centimeters per second calculated
from the deposition data were 0.06 for *®Mo, 0.025 for
1327¢ and 129Te, 0.017 for *93Ru and {?¢Ruy, and
0.021 for °SNb. These values are probably reliable
within a factor of 2 because of the logarithmic way in
which the activity ratios enter into the calculation of D.
The activity ratios themselves are only reliable within a
factor of about 10. From these values of D it is
estimated’ ® that the diameters of the particles carrying
the Te, Ru, and Nb isotopes were in the range 17 X
107 to 33 X 107 u, or 17 to 33 A. The °’Mo
particles may be somewhat smaller, and the fuel-salt
particles carrying the salt-seeking species are indicated
to be considerably larger. It is likely that the very small

 size of the particles carrying noble metals accounts for

the fact that they could not be characterized or
identified by electron microscope techniques, particu-
larly since their concentrations in the aerosol mixture
were low compared with the concentration of fuel-salt
particles. The extremely small size of the noble metal
particles suggests that the noble metals in the aerosol
exist as groups of metal atoms rather than as species

sorbed on other very small particles. These interpre-

tations are based on only two rather crude diffusion
tube tests and should not be relied upon too heavily
until they are confirmed by more refined tests. A

significant source of error in the above estimates will be
discussed in the next section. :

11.2.5 Closed-Tube Diffusion Tests

Before results were available on the flow diffusion
tests just described, it was speculated that the aerosol
particles might be so large that the deposition gradients
could not be estimated. Therefore three closed-tube
diffusion tests were carried out to obtain steeper
deposition gradients which would indicate qualitative
differences in diffusion behavior of the various nuclides.
Each diffusion tube was a 12-in. length of %;-in.-OD
nickel tubing welded closed at the upper end. At
distances of 2, 5, and 10 in., respectively, from the
. open bottom ends, the three tubes were provided with
chemical traps made by packing 1-in. lengths of the
tube with NaF and activated alumina pellets. Each tube
was positioned in the reaction vessel with the open end
Y, in. from the surface of the molten MSRE fuel salt,
and the gas space above the fuel salt was flushed with a
slow flow of 15 cc/min of dried helium. The run
durations were 2, 3, and 4 hr, respectively, for the tubes
with chemical traps 5, 2, and 10 in. from the open end.
After leaching the exterior of each tube free of activity,
it was segmented to provide samples of the NaF trap,
the alumina trap, and of the tubing below and above
the traps. Each sample was dissolved and analyzed
radiochemically for 12 nuclides and by delayed-neutron
counting for 235U, K

The results for the diffusion tubes with the chemical

150

trap 5 in. from the open end were puzzling, since the

deposition gradients were hardly steeper than for the
flow diffusion tubes, except for **Nb and **Zr. The
steepest gradients were observed in the tube with the
trap 2 in. from the open end. The order of steepness
was 95Nb, 1311’ 132 129T¢ 957; 103Ry 106R,
144Ce, 141Ce, ?°Mo, ®°Sr, and ! *°Ba. Compared with
the flow diffusion tube results, the >>Nb and °5Zr
gradients were much steeper and that for **Mo much
less steep. These discrepancies are not easily explained
except as analytical errors. The analyses for the
salt-seeking nuclides were particularly difficult since the
total leach solutions often contained less than 10°
dis/min in the presence of 10° dis/min of *3'I and 108
to 10'° dis/min of the noble metals. Because of
analytical difficulties, complete analyses were obtained
-on only half the nuclides requested for the third
diffusion tube samples. They agreed in general with the

than observed. It must be concluded that modes of
transport other than simple diffusion were operative.
Convective currents set up by the considerable thermal
gradient up the tube (600°C at the open end, 30°C at the
closed end) are a possibility. In any case, these results
suggest that the flow diffusion tube results should be
corrected for the deposition effects noted in the
absence of net flow. This correction would appreciably
decrease the deposition gradients and the diffusion
coefficients calculated from the flow diffusion tube
experiments and thus increase the estimated aerosol
particle sizes. The scatter of the data between runs and
the lack of correspondence between specimens analyzed
are such that it would not be meaningful to attempt to
carry out such corrections with the available data. An
experiment in which a flow diffusion tube and a closed
tube of identical geometry are set up side by side in the
reaction vessel appears preferable for obtaining a good
closed-tube blank for correcting the flow diffusion tube
results.

11.2.6 Volatilization of MSRE Salt in the
Absence of Radioactivity

Eight control tests were carried out in the laboratory
to test the degree of volatilization of unirradiated
MSRE fuel salt under the conditions of the chemical
probe tests in the hot cell. A reaction vessel and
chemical probe tubes of identical design were used, and
the rest of the apparatus was similar to that used in the
hot cell. The salt used was of very similar chemical
composition to MSRE fuel salt, except that none of the
U* (0.22% 23°U) had been reduced to U**. Runs were
made under the same pressure and flow conditions as
the hot-cell runs, as well as some at higher pressures and
flows. In two runs the helium was bubbled through the
salt as it was in some early hot-cell tests. _ |

After each run the chemical probe tube was put
through washing, segmenting, and dissolution proce-
dures exactly like those used for the radioactive tubes.

_ The solutions were then analyzed for lithium by flame

results from the second closed tube (trap 2 in. from

open end).
The main puzzle in the closed diffusion tube results is
why the deposition gradients were not much steeper

photometry and for uranium by delayed-neutron count-
ing or by the fluorometric method. It was necessary to
concentrate each solution (originally 100 ml) by a

factor of 10 by evaporation to detect the elements. A

blank on the chemical probe materials and the dis-
solution reagents was run by carrying out the seg-
menting, dissolution, and analytical procedures in an
identical way on an unexposed chemical probe.

The analyses of the test and blank samples were
difficult because the concentrations of uranium and
lithium in the solutions were extremely low, of the
 

 

 

order of 0.01 ug/ml in the blanks and in more than half
the test solutions. Each sample solution was made up to
a standard volume of 100.0 ml. The lithium and
uranium analyses approximated the blank values for
most of the NaF and soda-lime segments. The uranium

151

contents of the Felt Metal segments also did not exceed

the blanks. The bottom empty tube sections contained

‘blank uranium concentrations in three tests, only slight

excesses (1 pg) in two other tests, and about 10 ug
excesses in the remaining three tests. One of the latter
was a bubbling run at 20 cc/min. In general the
variations in deposition were not obviously related to
the helium flow rate, test duration, or pressure drop
across the probe. In the case of lithium, the blank
values were consistently exceeded only for the Felt
Metal segment. The average excess was about 5 ug of
lithium, corresponding to about 50 ug of fuel salt. For
the bottom empty tube section, the blanks were usually
only slightly exceeded except in the bubbling run at 20
cc/min.

It is difficult to expl.in the fact that the patterns of
deposition of lithium and uranium were different. If
both were carried by droplets of fuel salt, the patterns
would be identical. Likewise if they traveled as vapors
of LiF (or Li;BeF;) and UF,, similar deposition
patterns would be expected. Since the deposition
patterns for lithium were generally more consistent
than for uranium, it may be assumed that the rare high
uranium values were due to accidental contamination.
In this case the lithium was probably traveling as LiF
(or Li, BeF,) vapor, and the control test results should
be interpreted as indicating no salt aerosol formation
over the nonradioactive fuel salt. It is likely that
convection and diffusion transferred a large part of the
LiF vapor to the probe, since simple transpiration

- would transport smaller amounts. If the improbable

assumption is made that the lithium travels as a
component of fuelsalt droplets, the control tests still
indicate less than 10% as much aerosol formation as was
observed in the hot-cell tests.

11.2.7 Summary and Intexpretation of
‘Hot-Cell Test Results -

The various hot-cell and laboratory tests described
above have confirmed previous information on the
nature of the aerosols formed in the gas phase above

highly radioactive MSRE fuel and have enlarged on this .

information. It was determined that neither type of
aerosol is highly charged. The deposition behavior of
the aerosol flowing through either packed or open tubes
indicates that the noble metal aerosols travel independ-

ently of each other and their particles are of much
smaller diameter (4 to 20 A) than that of the average
fuel-salt aerosol particle. The control tests indicated
that the molten salt must be radioactive to produce the
salt aerosol. It was shown that convection and diffusion
effects importantly affected deposition results. These
will have to be taken into account or eliminated in
future experimental work.

The mechanisms by which the metallic and salt
aerosols are formed remain an open question. In the
case of the metallic particles, a theory based on the
difficulty of nucleation for metal atoms in a molten salt
is favored. Individual metal atoms formed by fission or
decay might not nucleate as crystals since their concen-
trations and diffusion coefficients in molten salt are
low. The solution would then become highly super-
saturated in dissolved metal atoms, which would there-
fore possess high activity coefficients and corre-
spondingly high escaping tendencies.

11.2.8 Attempt to Sample Foam in Pump Bowl

Fuel density measurements and overflow behavior in
the pump bowl during recent MSRE operation indi-
cated that the fuel in the sprayed region of the pump
bowl was in a foamy condition. It was of interest to
sample the surface salt in the mist-shielded region of the
pump bowl to see whether the foam penetrated from
the sprayed to the mist-shielded region of the pump
bowl and whether the surface salt was chemically or
radiochemically different from bulk fuel salt.

A laboratory test indicated that a sample of frozen
foam in which about 10% of the smaller bubbles visibly
survived could be taken by quickly immersing a cold
metal rod in foaming salt and rapidly retrieving it. The
same operation was carried out in the MSRE pump
bowl with a dog-bone-shaped piece of solid nickel with
% -in.-diam knobs at the end of a 3-in.-long, %-in.-diam
center section. The bottom knob and half of the

¥-in.-diam section were covered with a frozen film of

fuel salt %, to % ¢ in. thick. The knobs protected the
brittle film on the center section from cracking off
during retrieval up the sampling tube and shipment to
the hot cells for examination. »

The fuel-salt film was examined under a Kollmorgen
periscope and under a 30-power stereomicroscope. It
was mostly an opaque milky white with a faint green
coloration visible in some regions. The top edge of the
film and the region near the bottom of the %-in.-diam
section were a pale transparent green with opaque white
dots embedded in it. The exterior surface of the film
was quite smooth compared with the jagged surface of

 
 

 

the frozen foam sample taken in the laboratory.
However, two small craters about 1 mm in diameter,
which looked like the remains of bubbles which burst
during freezing, were observed on the outside surface,
and two tiny bubbles were found embedded in the
transparent salt.

The film was then cracked off the metal sampling

" device and the interior surface examined. Most of this

surface was also smooth and white, but several dozen
small hemispherical voids and a number of larger
shallow depressions were visible (Fig. 11.2). Those
almost surely represented the frozen remains of foam
bubbles trapped between the metal and the salt film.
Several discrete regions of the inner surface also
contained large shallow depressions which were coated
with a very thin dark shiny metallic-appearing film
(Figs. 11.2 and 11.3). These may have been the remains
of a solid-containing foam. It has been speculated that
small metal particles might tend to collect at salt-gas
interfaces, since the salt does not wet clean metals. A
few small flakes of salt actually had the porous

 

152

appearance of a frozen foam. This salt was also darker
in color than other salt flakes (Fig. 11.4). -

A sample of white frozen flakes weighing 0.45 g was
dissolved and analyzed chemically and radiochemically.
The analyses showed normal concentrations of bulk
fuel constituents and of fission products with stable
fluorides. The concentrations of ?°Mo, '32Te, 12%Te,
103Ru, and '°¢Ru were high by about two orders of
magnitude compared with fuel-salt samples taken in
freeze-valve capsules. This degree of contamination by
noble metals may be at least partially explained by the
exposure of the unprotected sampler to noble metal
aerosols in the pump-bowl cover gas.

A flake of salt film containing some of the dark shiny
material on the inner surface was powdered and
analyzed by electron diffraction. Only fuel-salt powder
patterns were observed. An attempt was also made to
identify the dark material on several flakes weighing 66
mg by dissolving away the fuel salt with oxygen-free
Verbocit solution (a neutral mixture of sodium Ver-
senate, boric acid, and citric acid) and analyzing the

residue. The barely visible particles of gray residue (less
than 1 mg) were only partially soluble in a mixture of
HNO; and HCI. Spectrographic analysis of the solution
detected only a few micrograms of beryllium and
zirconium. A gamma spectrometer scan and radio-
chemical analyses of the acid solution showed several
times more !°3Ru and °®Ru than were contained in

153

the Verbocit dissolution of the original 66 mg of salt

flakes. A final attempt is being made to identify the

dark shiny material more positively by electron- probe -

examination.

The density of several flakes of the frozen film was

measured by observing the density of _solutlons of
C,H;Br4 in CCl, in which the flakes would just remain
suspended. The densities of several flakes ranged from
2.40 to 2.45 g/cc. The density of simulated solid MSRE
fuel salt measured by the same method ranged from
2.45 to 2.51 g/cc, with most particles showing a density
of 2.49 g/cc. These readings indicate that the frozen
flakes contained 2 to 4% voids.

All of the observations listed above mdxcate that there
is probably a small amount of foam, some of which

 

contains insoluble material, on the surface of the fuel
salt in the mist-shielded region of the pump bowl.
However, it is not a thick foam such as probably exists
in the pump bowl outside the mist shield.

11.3 LABORATORY TESTS ON AEROSOL
FORMATION OVER MOLTEN SALTS
AND TRANSFER OF NIOBIUM
FROM SALT TO BISMUTH

H.W.Kohn F.F.Blankenship S.S. Kirslis

Previously described pump-bowl gas analyses and
hot-cell tests with MSRE fuel salt!® have led us to
postulate the existence of two types of aerosols over
the highly radioactive molten fuel salt: a fume of noble
metal fission products and an aerosol of tiny fuel-salt
particles. - Confirmatory laboratory experiments using
tracer levels of radioactivity were begun to investigate

some features of the process of radioaerosol formation

over molten salts. In particular, we wished to investigate

the hypothesis that noble metals escape from molten
salts because of the difficulty of nucleation of indi-
vidually formed atoms into metal crystals. A convenient
isotope for this study was 65-day ®*Zr, which could be
added to the melt as a soluble fluoride and allowed to
decay atom by atom to 35-day ®5Nb. In a reduced
melt, the reduction of niobium to metal should be zero
order in reductant.

In the first tests the simulated fuel salt contained 0.1
mc of freshly separated ®*Zr in 40 g of salt.!” The
apparatus that contained the salt and the procedure
were similar to those used in the hot-cell probe-tube
tests,! ® except that in some tests no flow was passed

tests, but the presence or absence of flow or of
bubbling had little effect on the amount of tracer
collected. The first tracer experiments were 2also meant
to be only of an exploratory nature.

The melt was treated for 1%, hr with a 50-50 mixture
of H, and HF to convert oxides to fluorides. Then
probe tubes, used as gas exit lines from the pot
containing the fuel, were exposed at various sweep
rates, temperatures, pressures, and degrees of reduction
of the fuel salt. Other parameters — the degree of
bubbling, flow rate, and distance of the probe tubes
from the melt, as well as their geometry — were also
varied. At the conclusion of the experiment four salt
samples, one from the top of the melt, one from the

middle, one from the bottom, and one more repre-

sentative of the total sample, were taken and counted.
The top of the reaction bomb, the inside bomb casing,
four pieces of the nickel liner, and the nickel bubbling
tube were washed; the washings were analyzed for
 

 

95Nb and ?%Zr as well as for lithium and uranium so
that we could check the percent recovery in the
washings and the composition of the adhering material.
The results of these analyses are presented in Table
11.6. It is noted that the niobium preferentially
migrates to the surface of the salt, to the bottom, and
to the walls of the container. The bulk salt is somewhat
depleted in ®SNb, as expected. It is possible that some
of this is due to precipitation of ZrQ,, since the bottom
fraction of the salt is enriched also in ?5Zr..

It was considered important to make sure that the
melt was indeed reducing so that the niobium would be

. in the elemental form. Otherwise the niobium would

have escaped into the gas space as a volatile fluoride. A
log of operations and their effects is given in Table
11.7. The first reduction (corresponding to 1% of the
U*) ‘was done by adding a milligram of zirconium
metal. This was followed by more severe reducing
conditions; further additions of 20 mg of UF; and,

T 155

after some temperature cycling, another addition of
200 mg of UF,;. The degree of reduction had little
effect on the amount of total deposition on the probe
tubes. The ratio **Nb/?°Zr on the probe tubes was
always greater than this ratio in the salt, usually more
than ten times greater. The only treatment which
increased the deposition greatly was applying a vacuum
or sparging the melt with HF after some niobium had
grown in. The HF sparge also increased the ratio
9SNb/?5Zr on the probes to several hundred times
what it was in the melt.

The principal conclusions of the tracer tests were as
follows: (1) Small amounts of °’Nb, and to a lesser
extent salt as a carrier of ®5Zr, escaped to the gas
phase, presumably by the same mechanisms as in the
hot-cell tests on fuel. (2) The degree of reduction had
little influence on the total deposition of ?SNb in the
probe tubes. (3) The deposition mechanism is probably
controlled by diffusion, since low flow rates and gentle

bubbling did not give greater total deposition rates than
stopped flow, in agreement with the hot-cell tests. (4)
In both tracer experiments and hot-cell tests most of
the ®*5Nb remains in the salt, whereas in the reactor
only a low percentage remains in the fuel. It should be
noted, however, that the tracer and hot-cell tests are
run for only short times over a stagnant melt, whereas
the reactor is vigorously circulated and sparged and is at

a steady state concerning those isotopes. (5) In the

tracer experiment about 25% of the ?°Nb migrates to
the container wall during the total experiment (one
month),

The relative rates of escape of ®*Nb to the gas phase in
the tracer experiment and in the second hot-cell tests (a
few hundredths to one percent per hour) are in essential
agreement. In the first hot-cell tests, however, the rate
of 5Nb escape to the gas phase was much greater. Most

of this can be accounted for by a few high results

obtained when the melt was vigorously bubbled. In the
reactor about 50% of the ®**Nb escaped to the gas, and

a similar amount migrated to the walls. Our best guess -

so far is that the differences in the three results
(reactor, hot-cell, and tracer experiments) are due to

engineering parameters involving stirring and efficiency
of mass transfer which are difficult to evaluate with our
present experimental arrangement.

The most plausible explanation that we can offer at
present is that both salt and niobium are moving by
diffusion and that the niobium, under severe reducing
conditions, preferentially leaves the melt as unnucleated
metal atoms. The calculated nucleation rate in the melt
is too low to allow nucleation, and the calculated
gaseous nucleation rate is indeed adequate. However, a
serious drawback to this picture is that the ?5Nb metal
atoms should pass across the interface between the melt
and the container wall as readily as they escape through
the gas-melt interface. One would ordinarily expect the
95Nb to stick to the wall at every collision, yet this is
not borne out by the data. The contamination of the
wall and the bomb top is far too low. Some of this
deficit could be due to a loss of deposited *Nb as a
volatile fluoride during the intermediate HF treatment.

Some further tests were carried out to measure the
extractability of reduced niobium from MSRE salt into
liquid bismuth. The salt melt containing °*5 Zr and *SNb
was purified with HF-H;, reduced with zirconium
 

 

 

 

metal, and contacted with liquid bismuth at 600°C in a
molybdenum container. At the same time, coupons of
several metals and of Grafoil'® were exposed to the
reduced melt. '

Only 2% of the ®*Nb in the salt phase transferred to
the bismuth phase in three days, possibly because of the
lack of adequate mass transfer across the interface.
Deposition rates in the liquid for > Nb on molyb-
denum, nickel, and stainless steel exposed in the gas in
the previous experimental melt were similar to rates on
the probe specimens. Especially noteworthy were the
much lower deposition rates of °**Nb and ?°Zr on the
Grafoil specimens.

We attempted to repeat this experiment using a better
grade of bismuth, a carbon crucible, and 2 molybdenum
lift pump®® for stirring. Due to a failure of the
circulating pump diaphragm, this experiment was a
dismal failure. The salt could not be reduced. The one
item of information that we were able to salvage from
this experiment was that niobium from an unreduced
melt will not migrate into bismuth. Deposition of
niobium on the molybdenum surfaces from this oxi-
dized melt was about one and a half orders of
magnitude slower than it was in the previous experi-
ment, and deposition on the carbon crucible was about
the same as the deposition on the molybdenum crucible
in the previous experiment.

compound decomposed at somewhat higher tempera-
tures (<300°C) to MoF3; and a volatile product.
Conclusions about decomposition were only tenuous
because the Pyrex container was attacked by the
fluorides. Since then two samples of MoF4 have been
decomposed in copper containers under a dynamic
vacuum of 25 u for 14 days at 265 and 352°C. In both
cases the MoF,4 decomposed to form MoF; and volatile
materials, but the reaction was incomplete. The thermal
instability of MoF, was further investigated using a
time-of-flight mass spectrometer and a copper Knudsen
cell over a temperature range of 225 to 750°C. The
results are described below under mass spectroscopic
studies of fluorides.

The solubility of MoF; in molten 2LiF+BeF, was
determined by investigating the phase equilibria along
the join 2LiF-BeF,-MoF;. The results are shown in

reaction,

reduce the molybdenum. Experiments are now under

11.4.2 Mass Spectrometric Studies of Fluorides

Mass spectrometric studies of pure MoF; have
shown?® (Fig. 11.8, dashed lines) that the gas escaping
from a Knudsen cell in the temperature range
500—700°C was predominantly MoF; with lesser
amounts of both MoF4 and MoF, and that the ratio of
MoF, to MoFs increased with temperature. Similar
studies with LiF-BeF,-MoF; (60-30-10 mole %) in the
temperature range 500 to 800°C indicated (Fig. 11.8,
solid lines) that the same three materials (MoF4, MoF;,

‘and MoFg) were present but that the amount of MoF,

was markedly increased at the expense of both MoFs
and MoFg, that the ratio of MoF4 to MoFs again
increased with temperature, and that the MoF, became
the more dominant species at ~590°C. The molyb-

MoF; was not observed with the LiF-BeF,;-MoF,
mixture. Two groups of fragments with typical molyb-
denum isotopic ratios were observed at 600°C having
228 and 130 amu (for °8Mo). Neither of these peaks
was observed in previous studies involving molybdenum
fluorides or oxyfluorides in the absence of molten

In any event they were a minor portion (~2%) of the
effusing vapor. In addition, this study has shown that
the molten 2LiF+BeF, solvent tends to stabilize Mo
and that copper is much superior to nickel as a
container material. Both observations are consistent
with our experience in synthesis and solution kinetics.

A sample of freshly prepared MoF4; was completely
sublimed in a copper Knudsen cell over the temperature
range 225 to 750°C. The residue was found by x-ray

diffraction to be molybdenum metal. No gases were
observed below 225°C. As has been observed with all
previous molybdenum fluorides, the gaseous products
were MoF,, MoFs, and MoF,, the relative concen-
trations of which varied with temperature and with the
particular condensed phases involved. The dominant
vapor species above solid MoF, at temperatures greater
than 560°C was MoF,. -

We plan to pursue this and similar studies with other
systems employed in MSR technology, since at present
mass spectrometry is the only approach which has
provided definite information about the composition of
the gas phase associated with Mo® solutions. For this
reason the following work with RuF; and NbFs was
done. .
The sample of RuF;, prepared by D. E. LaValle,
disproportionated in the Knudsen cell between 600 and
700°C forming ruthenium metal, identified by x-ray
diffraction, and either RuF4 or RuFs. The total cell
pressure at 650°C was estimated to be about 107* torr.
Ionization efficiency curves for the ion fragments at
650°C are shown in Fig. 11.9. The appearance poten-
tials, obtained by the vanishing-current technique, are
listed in Table 11.8. The RuF,™* ion may be formed
either by simple ionization of RuF, or by dissociative
ionization of RuF;. The latter method is characteristic
of many metal halide systems,?” including those of
molybdenum and niobium.

In Table 119 are cracking patterns of the vapor
species as a function of temperature (600 to 700°) for
75 ev electron energy and as a function of electron
energy (18 to 75 ev) for 650°. Over the 100°
temperature range, within which the metal fluoride
completely effused, no significant change in the relative
abundance of the ions was seen. The temperature

stability of the effusing ruthenium fluoride indicates
the presence of only one neutral precursor. At lower
electron energies (less than 30 ev) the RuF;* to RuF,*
ratio decreased. This effect, as seen in the ionization
efficiency curves for RuF;* and RuF,* of Fig. 11.9,
could be expected for a parent ion, as it undergoes less
fragmenting at lower electron energies. It appears,
therefore, that RuF, undergoes simple ionization,
which is unusual, and that the disproportionation
reaction is 4RuF; - Ru® + 3RuF,.

A sample of NbF;s, synthesized by L. M. Toth and
H. A. Friedman, was sublimed in a Knudsen cell at
75°C leaving a residue, containing 1.6 wt % oxygen,
which was not volatile at this temperature. The resi-
due gave off NbOF; in the temperature range
300—575°C and again above 700°C. The cell pres-
sure at 75°C was estimated to be between 10~ and
107? torr. The cracking patterns for NbFs; and
NbOF; at 75 ev are shown in Table 11,10, The
ionization efficiency curves are given in Fig. 11.10.
The appearance potentials obtained from these
curves are listed in Table 11.10. Since the NbFg*
parent peak is absent, the NbFs must undergo dis-
sociative ionization, typical of metal halides.2” This
suggests that the neutral precursors for the Nb,Fg*
and the NbyF,,* ions are the dimer Nb,F,o and
the trimer Nb3F, s respectively. - '

The behavior of the Nb, Mo, and Ru fluorides
studied thus far is strikingly different. The niobium
forms at least two polymers, Nb,F;o and NbsF,s;
the molybdenum forms Mo,F;o; while ruthenium
gave no evidence of polymerization. The strong tend-
ency to form oxyfluorides is shared by all these
elements, but the relative volatilities differ. In the

~ case of molybdenum the oxyfluorides are somewhat

more volatile than the fluorides but not sufficiently
so to provide an easy separation of the species. On
the other hand both ruthenium and niobium form
oxyfluorides which are much less volatile and allow
complete separation of the fluorides. The probability

that the ruthenium fluorides undergo simple rather
than dissociative ionization, discussed above, distin-
guishes them from the molybdenum and niobium
fluorides.

In addition to the noble metal fission product
work, recent interest?® in the use of aluminum ha-
lides to form volatile complexes with actinide or
rare-carth fluorides prompted a mass spectrometric
study of vapor species over LiF-BeF;-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) containing PrF; and AlF;. The
barren fuel, spiked with 10 wt % PrF; and 11 wt %
AlF;, was loaded in a nickel Knudsen cell crucible.
Vapor species effusing from the cell were monitored
over the temperature range of 650 to 850°C. The
total pressure inside the cell at 850°C was estimated
to be near 0.2 u. The only volatile aluminum com-
plexes observed were LiAlF; and Li, AlFs (about
8:1). No fragments containing praseodymium or
thorium were seen.

The lack of such fragments at the low pressures
involved does not imply their absence at higher par-
tial pressures of AlF;. It has been amply demon-

strated with chlorides?®3! that higher total pres-
sures (1 to 3 atm) produce significant partial
pressures (10 to 100 toms) of the volatile com-
plexes. Even though AlF; is much less volatile than
AlCl;, pressures a thousand times higher than those
used above (0.2 ) are available below 1000°C. If
interest warrants, these studies could be profitably
pursued by distillation or transpiration experiments.

12.1 CeF; SOLUBILITY IN MOLTEN
MIXTURES OF LiF, BeF,, AND ThF,

C.J.Barton L.O.Gilpatrick ~ Judy A. Fredricksen

Data on the solubility of CeF; in five ternary
LiF-BeF,-ThF4 mixtures and one LiF-ThF,; mixture
were reported earlier.2>> Comparison of these data with
the results of previous investigations of the solubility of
CeF; in LiF-BeF, melts* and PuF; in similar composi-
tions® pointed to the conclusion that the solubility of
PuF; in the ternary mixtures will probably be adequate
to fuel a reactor based on PuF; as the fissile agent.

We have extended this study by providing data on
"CeF3 solubility in three additional ternary solvent
compositions and three LiF-ThF4 mixtures in order to
determine the effect of solvent composition on CeF3
solubility (see the following section). The data ob-
tained, together with calculated heats of solution, are
shown in Table 12.1 along with the previously reported

16.7 mole % ThF, by a reexamination of the extrapo-
lation of rather scattered data). The significance of the
data in the last two columns of Table 12.1 is discussed
in the following section.

As indicated in the 600°C column in Table 12.1, the
liquidus temperatures of several solvent compositions
listed here appear to be higher than given by the

12.2 CORRELATION OF CeF, SOLUBILITY
WITH SOLVENT COMPOSITION

M. A.Bredig C.J. Barton

Preiiminary attempts® to relate the solubility of CeFj
in LiF-BeF,;-ThF, mixtures to solvent composition

ratio of ThF, to BeF, to be the dominant factor for
the binary and ternary mixtures listed in Table 12.1,
which includes two LiF-BeF, solvents studied earlier.*
The smooth lines of Fig. 12.1 (where the compositions
in Table 12.1 are identified by mixture number) show
the nearly linear dependence of the solubility of CeF,,
s = 100 X CeF3/(CeF; + LiF + BeF, + ThF,;), on u =
ThF4/(ThF, + BeF,) in accordance with the equations

$(600°C) = 0.50 + 2.60u — 0.40u® ,
s(700°C) = 1.60 + 4.23u — 0.88% ,
5(800°C) = 3.80 + 5.80u — 0.80u> .

The only significant deviation among the ternary
mixtures, As = + 0.30, +0.70, and 1.20 mole % CeF; at
600, 700, and 800°C, respectively, occurred for solvent
No. 8, LiF-BeF;-ThF, (75.0-17.9-7.1 mole %), with a
“free LiF” content, b = LiF — 2BeF, — 3ThF,, of 18
mole % LiF. The significance of b as a secondary
parameter is further demonstrated by the similarity of
the As values listed above with As = +0.40, +0.80, and
+1.70 mole % CeF; at 600, 700, and 800°C for the
binary mixture No. 14, LiF-BeF, (72.7-27.3 mole %),
having the same “free LiF” content, b = 18.

The solubility of CeF; in LiF-ThF, mixtures as a
function of ThF4 content is shown in Fig. 12.2. Some
of the CeF; solubility data reported* for LiF-BeF,
mixtures are included for comparison. The solubility of
CeF; in LiF at 700 and 600°C was obtained from the

 

SR.E. Thomaetal, J. Phys. Chem. 64, 865 (1960).
7R.E. Thomaet al., J. Phys. Chem. 63, 1266 (1959).

- gave unsatisfactory results. We have found the molar -

LiF-CeF; phase diagram® by extrapolating below the

eutectic temperature (755°C). The measurements in the
range 20 to 33 mole % ThF, show the solubility of
CeF; to increase with decreasing ThF4 content by 20

to 30%, depending on the temperature. The solubility

may be assumed to increase smoothly with increasing

“free LiF” concentration along the broken lines of Fig.

12.2. At 800°C the CeF; solubility appeared to be

higher with 40 mole % ThF, than with 33, but the

difference is within the scatter of the data. The range of

ThF, concentrations that could be conveniently investi-

gated was limited by high liquidus temperatures.

In LiF-BeF, mixtures the CeF; solubility goes
through a distinct minimum at approximately 38 mole
% BeF,, its value at 48 mole % being approxrmately
50% greater than the minimum value.?+*

An attempt has been made to rationalize the observed
dependence of the CeF; solubility in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
mixtures on solvent composition. The dependence
reflects the significance of the greater availability of F~
jons for interaction with Ce®* in melts richer in LiF.
This was indicated by the considerable negative devia-
tion from ideality in the LiF-CeF; phase diagram.
Values, measured or extrapolated, for the CeF; con-
centrations of the CeF; liquidus at 600 to 800° exceed
those estimated from the known entropy of fusion of
CeF; [7.62 cal (°C)™ mole™ at the melting point of
CeF3] by factors of 4 to 2 respectively. In LiF-BeF,
mixtures containing 25 to 50 mole % BeF,, the
solubility is very much smaller than ideal. This positive
deviation from ideality can be attributed to the much
weaker interionic forces between the singly charged Li*
jons and the relatively large BeF,2" anions (cf. also the
low melting points) as compared with the forces
between the triply charged Ce®** and the relatively small
F~ ions. Although molten Li; ThF, contains even larger
complex anions, ThF,3", it exhibits a CeF; solubility
intermediate between that in LiF and Li,BeF,. This
apparent anomaly is readily attributed to the fact that

" the Ce* ions, with a charge-tosize ratio, or “jonic

potential,” z/r = 3, compete for F~ ions much more
successfully with Th* (z/r = 4) than with Be** (z/r =
6. |

Several ternary compositions have negative values of
“free LiF,” but they do fit the correlation shown in the
bottom part of Fig. 12.1. This may be explained by
reference to Fig. 12.2, which shows very little change in
CeF; solubility in LiF-ThF4 mixtures in the range 25
to 40 mole % ThF,.

Finally, we compare apparent heats of solution of
CeF;, AH (soln.), in the various solvents (Table 12.1).
Those given for LiF-BeF, mixtures, approximately 17

kcal/mole, exceed considerably the heat of fusion of .

CeF3, AH (fusion), which may be estimated from the
value 13.4 kcal at the melting point as 10 to 12 kcal for
temperatures of 600 to 800°C. On the other hand, on
substitution of ThF, for BeF, (Fig. 12.3) the heat of
solution drops to the vicinity of the heat of fusion, that
is, 11 kcal, in line with the considerations of the
preceding paragraph on the smaller deviation from

ideality.

‘The values shown in Fig. 12.3 for the heat of solution
of CeF; in two LiF-BeF, mixtures are somewhat higher
than those calculated ror other LiF-BeF, solvents and
are much greater than more recent values® for the heat
of solution of NdF; and SmF; in LiF-BeF, (66-34
mole %), 11.5 and 10.5 kcal/mole respectively. The
shape of the curve in the low-ThF, end of Fig. 12.3 is
not firmly established, and this fact, coupled with the
scatter of the points, indicates that only qualitative
significance should be attached to the relationship
between heat of solution and solvent composition in
this system at the present time.

12.3 ZONE MELTING OF FLUORIDE SALTS

E.L.Compere  Terry Dorsett'®

Zone melting and cyclic slow cooling tests have been
conducted on LiF-BeF,-ThF4 mixtures (72-16-12 and
57-33-10 mole % with ~0.3 and 0.025 mole % CeF;
added) to determine the separation of constituents,
particularly thorium and cerium, that develops under
several schemes of operation. The 72-16-12 salt is a base
composition for MSBR single-region fuel. The 57-33-10
salt may represent about the maximum beryllium
content that could be employed in a single-region
MSBR fuel and in any event, in terms of phase
behavior, is situated in a phase field different from the
first composition. Cerium trifluoride was used to
represent the rare-earth group because it permitted
straightforward chemical analysis at low concentration
levels.

Two kinds of tests were conducted, zone melting and
cyclic slow cooling. In all tests, nickel tubes 0.305 in. in
inside diameter by 12 in. long were filled with the
powdered salt and capped. After the melting cycles
were completed, the salt was recovered from successive
1-in, sections and submitted for chemical analysis for all
constituents. In the zone-melting experiments a heater
with three 1.8-in. heating zones and two 1.8-in. cooling
zones was passed along the tube at 1.5 cm/hr. Tempera-
tures alternated between 650 and 350°C. Experiments
were conducted with downward, horizontal, and, in one
case, upward moving zones. The upward zone move-
ment resulted in cracking the tube after the first pass
because of expansion of entrapped melt.

Horizontal zone-melting tests were checked with a
level only in the case of tube 22. Data from several tests

are shown in Table 12.2.

In cyclic slow cooling experiments, suggested by E. G.
Bohlmann, the tube was positioned vertically in a
furnace, heated to 600°C, and cooled to 350°C over a
period of 1 hr. Twelve such cycles were made, and the
tube was sectioned for analysis. Data from several tests
are shown in Table 12.2.

12.3.1 Phase Behavmr

The phase behavior of the LiF-BeF, -ThF4 is given by
Thoma in a published liquidus diagram'! and in recent
unpublished tie-line data. The composition LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) lies in the phase field

of the compound 3LiF+ThF, (melting point 580°C) =
and its solid solutions. This phase field, about 3 to 6

mole % wide, extends in a gentle curve from the region
of the compound 3LiF«ThF, toward a composition

 

YR E. Thomaetdl,J. Phys. Chem. 64, 865 (1960).

finally at about 60-37-3, liquidus 433°C, with a halt at
444°C at 65-31-4. The tieline data indicate that the

- first solid to form from our composition should be a

3LiF+ThF, solid solution LiF-BeF,-ThF, (69-7-24
mole %) and that LiF begins to coprecipitate with solid
solutions of about this composition, the melt tending
toward a final composition of perhaps 67-28-5(or even
65-31-4). All our consistent data on the 72-16-12
original composition have remained within this phase
field and between these limits and appear generally
explicable on such a basis.

The original composition LiF-BeF,-ThF, (57-33-10
mole %, liquidus 500°C) falls within the phase field of
the compound LiF ¢ 2ThF,, which melts incongruently
at about 940°C. The adjacent phase field is that of
LiF+4ThF,, and melts should tend toward 63-31-6,
448°C, and then to 60-37-3 mole %.

The data of tube 17 suggest that the cyclic slow
cooling process resulted in the precipitation of

 
 

LiF* 2ThF,, which settled to the bottom of the tube.
This first precipitate never remelted entirely; tie-line
diagrams and chemical analysis of samples imply a
possible disproportionation yielding some LiF+4ThF,,
but additional material is not available for the definitive
x-ray or petrographic analysis.

The final melt was about 60-38-2 mole % .

Thus for the 57-33-10 mole % composition, the
observed data appear essentially consistent with pre-
viously established phase diagrams.

12.3.2 Zone Melting

Five zone-melting experiments are summarized in
Table 12.2, all based on the composition 72-16-12 mole
%. The separations attained were modest and did not
proceed beyond the phase limits discussed above.

‘Compositions richest in thorium were generally found

in the lower regions of the tubes with either upward or
downward passes, suggesting sedimentation of heavy
precipitates. Horizontal passes generally gave poor
separation. Tube 11, which gave highest thorium
concentration at the exit end, was indicated by sample
volumes possibly to have been tilted slightly downward.

As will be discussed below, little separation of CeF,
was effected by zone melting.

12.3.3 Cyclic Slow Cooling

Cyclic slow cooling in a slender geometry generally
resulted in appreciably higher concentrations of tho-
rium being found nearest the bottom. This behavior is
to be expected if precipitates are free to settle, because
the phases richest in thorium are heavier and also melt
highest and thus are formed first. It is also indicated
that the resultant stratification may persist in favorable
(tali) geometries.

Behavior is again in accord with known phase
relationships.

12.3.4 Cerium

Cenum behavior is best examined with reference to
the solubility study of Fredricksen, Gilpatrick, and
Barton.!?

This study shows that the solubility in our 72-16-12
compositions at the liquidus temperature of ~500°C
was over 0.5 mole %. However, as the melt approaches a

 

124 A, Fredricksen, L.' O. Gilpatrick, and C. J. Barton,
Solubility of Cerium Trifluoride in Molten Mixtures of LiF,
BeF,, and ThF4, ORNL-TM-2335 (January 1969).

168

solubility is diminished. The final liquidus temperature
is also lower (~450°C) for this composition, so that the
final solubility would appear to be about 0.18 mole %.
Tubes 11 and 14 appear to fall within this category of
loss of cerium, as solubility and the decreasing amount
of melt phase caused coprecipitation to occur.

The final melt from our 57-33-10 mole % mixture was
not much different, and a comparable final cerium
solubility would be expected. Similar but more pro-

nounced coprecipitation is evident. The maximum -

amount of CeF; occurring in this case is somewhat up
from the bottom, probably because the precipitated
thorium compounds did not remelt, as discussed above.

The zone-melting behavior of cerium trifluoride is -

shown by tubes 20, 22, and 23, where solubility limits
were not exceeded. Because the cerium did not con-

| centrate in the melt but, if anything, appeared to follow

| ﬁnal composition in the vicinity of 67-28-5, the

thorium, it is possible that it was contained in the solid
solutions based on 3LiF+ThF,.

In any event no effective separation of thorium from
rare earths is shown by these experiments.

12.4 BEHAVIOR OF CeF, IN THE
FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION OF
ThF, FROM LiF-BeF,-ThF, MELTS

C. J. Barton

Because of difficulty experienced in separating rare
earths from thorium-rich single-fluid fluoride fuel com-
positions, the possibility of removing a fraction of the
thorium by fractional crystallization was examined. It is
necessary, of course, that the rare-earth fluorides
remain in the liquid when the thorium is removed. In
the experiments reported here CeF; was used to typify
the rare earths. Compere and Dorsett have also reported
crystallization data for the system LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-CeF3 (see Sect. 12.3), but the CeF; concentra-
tions used in those studies, 0.03 and 0.3 mole %, were
considerably higher than in present investigations, 100
ppm CeF; by weight = 0.003 mole %, which is
presumed to be realistic for breeder reactors.

Examination of the LiF-BeF,-ThF, phase diagrams!?
led to the choice of the composition LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(58-30-12 mole %) for the first study. The phase
diagram indicates that the primary phase for the
composition is LiF « 2ThF, and that secondary crystal-
lization does not occur until the concentration of ThF,4
in the melt is rather low.

The apparatus and sampling technique used in this
study were essentially identical to those used in CeF,

 

13k E. Thoma et al., J, Phys. Chem. 64,865 (1960).
 

solubility studies.!* Because of the low cerium con-
centration, sole reliance on this determination was
placed on the radiochemical technique.!® The melt was
prepared by mixing 197 g of prepurified LiF-BeF,
(66-34 mole %), 250 g of ThF,,45 mg of CeF;, and 0.5
me of 1*4Ce. The melt was treated with mixed H, and
HF at 720°C for 45 min followed by hydrogen alone.
Filtered samples of the liquid were removed, the
apparatus was cooled below the liquidus temperature,
another filtered sample was taken, and the process was
repeated at still lower temperatures. Three series of
samples were obtained on different days, starting above
the liquidus temperature each time, and the samples
were analyzed by Analytical Chemistry Division per-
sonnel for lithium, beryllium, and thorium and by the
writer for cerium. The results are displayed in Table
12.3. . -

The data show that 565°C is below the liquidus
temperature, whereas the published phase diagram
indicates an approximate liquidus temperature -of
525°C. A filtered sample taken at 650°C was used for

~ gradient studies (L. O. Gilpatrick and H. Insley) that

showed LiF-2ThF, crystallizing at 576 '+ 3°C and
LiF«ThF, at 489° or higher. Since the data show that
CeF; begins to disappear from the melt in the
temperature range 520 to 490°C, it seems likely that its

169

removal can be  attributed to association with
LiF+ThF, crystals. The above-mentioned quenching
study also shows that secondary crystallization oc-
curred at a higher temperature than predicted by the
phase diagram.!3

The data in Table 12.3 show that it is possible to
remove about half the ThF, from the composition
LiF-BeF,-ThF,; (60-28-12 mole %, average of four
analyses) by fractional crystallization and that removal
of more than 70% of the ThF, is possible with some
loss of CeF3; from the melt. Only qualitative signifi-
cance can be attached to the CeF; losses because of the
scatter in the data, which may indicate that equilibrium
between dissolved CeF; and solid LiF-ThF,; was not
achieved. It is not apparent from study of the
LiF-BeF,-ThF,; phase diagram or of Compere and
Dorsett’s data whether any other composition of
practical interest for use in molten-salt breeder reactors
will give better performance in regard to ThF,—
rare-carth separation than the one used in this investi-
gation. '

Additional data have been collected covering regions

composition with a liquidus temperature below 376°C.
Liquidus - and solidus are separated by a two-phase
region (primary phase and liquid) in a temperature
range equal to or greater than 11°C in all compositions
near the minimum that have been examined to date. We
are continuing the search for the minimum melting
composition in this part of the ternary system that
theoretically should exist with a very small separation
between liquidus and solidus temperatures. '
Four compositions were examined by the gradient
quench technique with the purpose of better defining
the minimum liquidus temperature in the part of the
ternary system bounded by the compounds NaF-KF-
KBF,. The data shown in Table 12.5 indicate that the
ternary eutectic is at 2 lower NaF composition than was
reported previously!® (~6 mole %) and must contain
less than 3 mole % NaF. Presently available data show
that the three solid phases in equilibrium at the ternary
eutectic composition are NaF, KF, and NaBF;-KBF,
solid solution with a melting point of 458°C, 18°C
higher than that reported prevmusly 16 The eutectic
temperature reported earlier as 455° for the limiting

‘binary KBF,-KF was revised upward to 460°.)7 The

limits of accuracy for the gradient quench temperature
are of the same order as the temperature difference,
+3°C. Additional work is needed to determine the exact
composition of the ternary eutectic.

examined in the high-.KF composition range of this
system. Liquidus temperatures were measured by DTA
and gradient quench methods. Results were in agree-
ment with the partial phase diagram presented earlier,
and we still find no evidence of the KF+KBF, and
KF+2KBF, compounds reported by Pawlenko.1® Ex-
perimental temperatures determined by DTA were from
17 to 36° higher than those determined by the quench
technique. We .believe the DTA data to be the more
reliable, since they represent in each case the results of
measurements made during several thermal cycles. Data
are shown in Table 12.6.

12.5.4 The System NaBF, -KBF,

Compositions containing 80, 85, 90, 95 mole %
NaBF, were examined by the gradient quench tech-
nique. The data for these compositions made from
high-purity materials confirm the DTA results which
were reported earlier,?® showing a minimum liquidus
temperature of 396 + 2°C at a composition of
approximately 90 mole % NaBF, in this solid-solution
system. We usually find agreement of this sort for
invariant temperature determinations, in contrast to
differences in liquidus measurements mentioned in the
previous section.

12.5.5 The System NaF-NaBF,4

New compositions were made from the better NaBF,
now available to improve the data for this two-
component system, which was the first to be studied.
DTA was used to measure the liquidus temperatures
given in Table 12.7. Results indicate an increase of
about 10°C in the liquidus boundary temperature in the
region of 30 mole % NaBF,, where the deviation from
the previously reported diagram!® is greatest. .

deviation from ideality.?! It was then predicted and has
now been confirmed that replacement of NaF by LiF

-The system contains as the more stable ion pairs [Li*
(zfr =~ 1.7), (BeF4)* (=0.8)] and [K* (=0.75), 1"
(~0.45)]. We have been able roughly to delineate the
region of two conjugate liquids as well as the eutectic
and monotectic equilibra (Fig. 12.5). At a critical
solution (consolute) temperature of 945°C (above
which only one liquid phase exists) the critical solution
contains 53% KI. At 665°C the two conjugate mono-
tectic liquidus contain 7 and 98% Kl in equilibrium
with solid KI. The observed large variance of the
monotectic temperature, a decline with decreasing KI
concentration, may be caused by the presence of excess
BeF, in the Li;BeF, sample used (LiF-BeF,, 66-34
mole %). However, it must also be recognized that the
system is a reciprocal pseudobinary one and that even

without excess BeF, the compositions of the two liquid
phases are likely to be more complicated than shown in
Fig. 12.5. The eutectic point lies at about 450° and 4
mole % KI. Large supercooling effects and our observa-
tion of what may be a metastable phase of the Li, BeF,
with added KI made the establishment of the eutectic
approximate at best.

12.6.3 The System Li; BeF4-KBF,

The more stable ion pairs are: [Li* (zfr = 1.7)
(BeF,)*” (=0.8)] and [K* (=0.75), (BF4)™ (~0.4)].
With the similarity in z/r for BF, ~ andI~, the eutectic
and monotectic equilibria in the system were expected,
and found, to be very similar to those reported above
for the Li;BeF,-KI system. At 554°C the two con-
jugate monotectic liquids contain about 5 and 98%
KBF, in equilibrium with solid KBF,. The eutectic
point lies at about 450° and 4 mole % KBF,. Because
of expected high BF; gas pressure, no attempt was
made to determine the consolute temperature, but it is
probably close to that found in the Li; BeF,4-KI system.
The difficulties described above in establishing the
monotectic and eutectic equilibria for the Li; BeF,KI
system were again encountered in almost identical
fashion for the Li, BeF4-KBF, system.

The much greater miscibility in the Li, BeF,-NaBF,
system indicated from- the liquid-liquid distribution
studies of Bamberger et al?? is due to the smaller size
of the sodium ion. Further delineation of the entire
two-liquid region may be desirable, possibly by the
technique of thermal analysis. In the present study it
was the only method thus far employed by us. More
detailed - knowledge may be gained by the use of
additional techniques such as sampling at temperature
or quenching with subsequent analysis of the separated
phases (high-temperature centrifuge?). More studies of
simpler systems such as LiF-KI, LiF-KBr, LiF-CsCl, etc.,
may also be desirable to further our basic, quantitative
understanding of the phenomenon of liquid-phase
separation in molten-salt systems.

spectroscopic determination of hydrogen produced on
dissolution in aqueous acid, the apparent solubility of
thorium metal in molten LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %) at
620°C has been firmly established as 0.1 mole %. The
particular form in which the thorium metal dissolves in
the melt is as yet undetermined. Russian workers, using
electrochemical techniques,?®~ %% claim to have
demonstrated the presence of ionic species of lower
valency when the metals beryllium, zirconium, and
thorium are equilibrated with alkali halide melts
containing the normal chlorides of those metals.

If on dissolving in the LiF-ThF,; melt the thorium
metal forms an ion of lower valency, Th(4—")* an
inert metal electrode such as tantalum should assume
the same potential in that melt as a thorium metal
electrode, because the potential-determining process
occurring at each electrode is the same,

Th{4—m* = Th** + ne™ . (1)

However, a dissolution mechanism other than the
formation of a thorium species of lower valency might
conceivably also yield a zero potential difference. This
is the reaction -

Th® + 4LiF = ThF, + 4(Li* +¢7), 2

where the electron may be considered to have F-, or
color-, center-like properties. At equilibrium the poten-
tial developed will be the same for the thorium
electrode and for an inert metal electrode,

approximately 20 min, and then a slow downward drift
commenced, terminating after 8 hr in a potential
difference of essentially zero. The second solution
model does not seem to afford a very satisfactory
explanation of the zero potential, since available ther-
modynamic data for reaction (2) above (AG —435
and —126 kcal/mole ThF4 and LiF, respectlvely, at
600°C) would predict a quantity of color centers two
orders of magnitude smaller than that found analyti-
cally (4 X 0.1 mole % “Th metal”; cf. above). The
assumption that a thorium species of lower valency
exists seems, at present, to provide a better tentative
explanation of the results obtained, even though
attempts to confirm this conclusion with spectroscopic
techniques (J. P. Young, Analytical Chemistry Division)
have not yet proved to be successful.

12.8 THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF KBF,4
-G. D. Brunton

Although the low-temperature polymorph of KBF,
has always been considered to be isostructural with
KCIO, and BaSO,, the structure has never been
adequately determined, and the lattice parameters
which were published were incorrect.2®+3® The struc-
ture has been completely determined from three-
dimensional x-ray data as a part of an extensive study
of complex fluoride compounds, and precise values for
the lattice parameters were determined.

The low-temperature polymorph of KBF, crystallizes
with the orthorhombic space group Pnma and with
lattice parameters @, = 8.6588(5), bo = 5.4800(4), and

= 7,029%8) A. The calculated density is 2.5067
g/cc. The structure is shown in Fig. 12.6.

In the low-temperature form of KBF, the K* ion is
coordinated by eight F~ jons at.distances less than 3.0
A and by more F~ ions at 3.075 A. The K™ polyhedron
shares edges with three and corners with four BF,
tetrahedra. The BF, tetrahedra are slightly irregular,
with tetrahedral angles of 108.5 to 111.4° and B-F
distances 1.378 to 1.391 A. The B-F distances are
almost equal to the B-F distances for NaBF4 (1.386 and

12,9 DENSITIES OF MOLTEN SALTS
Stanley Cantor

A dilatometric apparatus, previously described,®* is
being used to measure densities of molten salts. Since
the last report®>* the accuracy of the measurements has
improved, primarily by minimizing the volume occu-
pied by bubbles below the surface of the melt.
Apparent bubble volumes as high as 0.8% have been
estimated from measurements of melt volume vs pres-
sure. For melts which do not wet the nickel contain-
ment vessels, the apparent bubble volume comprises 0.3
to 0.8% of the melt volume; for melts which wet (e.g.,
NaNOj; and KNO;), the apparent bubble volume is
0.1% or less.

Three steps are now taken to reduce bubble volume:
(1) evacuation of the solid salt for at least 16 hr, (2)
- evacuation of the apparatus just above the liquidus
temperature of the salt (this procedure is not applied to
volatile melts such as fluoroborates), and (3) main-
tenance of an inert-gas pressure of about 70 psig during
measurements. By these three procedures apparent
bubble volumes are reduced to less than 0.1%.

The reliability of the dilatometric apparatus has been
assessed by determining the densities of NaNO, and
KNO;. Both salts have been measured extensively by
the buoyancy method. For our density measurements
of NaNOg, in the range 313 to 425°C, the results are
given by the equation p (g/cm?®) = 2.131 — 7.08 X
107%¢ (°C); the standard deviation in p is 0.001 g/cm?3.
These densities are 0.4 to 0.5% greater than those
compiled by Janz.3S Densities of KNO; were measured
in the temperature range 346 to 612°C; the equation
representing the results is p = 2,136 — 7.62 X 107%¢
Our densities are 0.1 to 0.3% greater than those
measured by Bloom ez al?¢ Thus the measurements of
NaNO; and KNOj; indicate that the dilatometric
technique is providing densities that are accurate to
within 0.5%.

Five other melts have been measured. The results are
summarized in Table 12.8. The first salt, NaBF,-NaF
(92-8 mole %), is a possible coolant for molten-salt
reactors. Densities of this melt were previously meas-
ured®* over a shorter temperature range. The densities
given in Table 12.8 are believed to be more reliable and
are approximately 0.27% less than the earlier results.

The second salt mixture is very similar in chemical
composition to the present MSRE fuel salt. The
experimental densities are within 1% of the densities
calculated from additive molar volumes;> 7 for example,

12,10 SPECTROSCOPY OF
FLUORIDE MEDIA

L.M.Toth G.P.Smith

The  establishment of a molten-fluoride visible-

ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy program has been

essentially completed. It includes the development of
the diamond-windowed spectrophotometric - cell®
which is unreactive to molten fluorides, and the
production of fluoride solvents and solutes of the

‘punty required for spectroscopy

data-handling systems presently available on commer-
cial spectrometers.

In particular, we are now able to record spectra on
paper tape and either combine them with others or
subtract components from composite spectra through
the use of the computer. It represents an improvement
in molten-flyoride data handling, both with respect to
speed and quality of output, which has never before
been available,

Continuous usage of the diamonds during the past
seven months with a wide variety of molten fluorides
has caused some wear on the diamonds. Examination
under a microscope reveals a slight etch on one face of
one window. It is not known why the wear has been
confined to only one surface. Possible causes of etching
can be associated with either the reactivity of the
fluoride solutions or oxygen contaminants in the
helium cover gas surrounding the diamond cell. This
wear on the diamonds has not detracted from their

usage as molten fluoride windows because it is too
slight to be detected by the spectrometer. It is possible,
however, that the diamonds will have to be repolished
on an annual basis to remove any accumulated damage.

12.10.2 Salt Purification for
Fluoride Spectroscopy

L. M. Toth G.P. Smlth

A]though the production of pure fluoride salts may
be viewed as a trivial task for the experienced molten-
salt personnel, there is little information on record
concerning details of technique or quality of product. It
is anticipated that this section might be of use to others
who may need salts of the quality described here.

Melts which are both low in oxide content and free of
suspended matter are a prerequisite for spectroscopy of
dilute species in fluoride solvents. Even small amounts
of solutes which react with the soluble oxides and leave
solution cause problems either by remaining suspended
and scattering light or by precipitating and collecting on
the windows of the cell.

The salts are best purified as individual components
instead of as the mixed salts. We use the customary
approach of subliming volatile fluorides and HF
sparging molten nonvolatile fluorides with gaseous HF.

It is usually the practice to sublime volatile fluorides
at temperatures where the vapor pressure of the salt is
10 to 100 torrs. These pressures in a system with
background pressures of the same magnitude result in
sublimation rates yielding approximately 100 g of
“purified” salt per day (see, for example, ref. 39).
These high sublimation rates cause entrainment of
impurities which baffle plates are only partially effec-

tive in removing.

We have found that low sublimation rates produced
by salt pressures of <0.1 torr in a background pressure
of 107 to 1073 torr eliminate the need of baffles and
yield much better results. For some very impure salts it
has been necessary to sublime a second time (as in the
case of Z:F,). At these low sublimation rates we have
been able to produce up to 50 g of salt in two to three
days.

The results on some of these fluoride salts are listed in
Table 12.9.

12.11 THE DISTRIBUTION OF U*
BETWEEN MOLTEN LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF4 AND
A (U-Th)O, SOLID SOLUTION

C.E. Bambe'rger C.F.Baes,Jr. A.L. Johnson
We have previously reported studies®®*! of the
distribution of U** between 2 molten fluoride phase

and a (U-Th)O, solid-solution phase by the ion ex-
change reaction

U*(F) + Th*(0) = U*(0) + Th*(F) , (1
for which we may write the quotient.

The results obtained indicate that in the stirred vessel
used at a stirring rate of 150 rpm and a fluoride to
oxide phase ratio >1:1 (on a weight basis), several
hundred hours were required for equilibrium at 680°C.

In continuing these measurements, we have improved
the seal in the stirred vessel,*? and this has permitted
an increase in the stirring rate from 150 to 500 rpm.
With this more rapid stirring and an increased ratio of
fluoride phase to oxide phase (4:1), exchange equi-
librium has been attained in periods less than 70 hr
when the oxide phase was <0.8 mole fraction UQ,.
This was true whether the previously equilibrated
system had been disturbed by the addition of UQ,,-
ThO,, or UF,, or just by a change of temperature (Fig.
12.7). The path followed by the UF, concentration of
the fluoride phase was unexpectedly complex when
UO; or ThO; was added, showing both a maximum
above and a minimum below the final equilibrium
value. Considerably more information is needed con-
cerning the effects of a number of variables — such as
the stirring rate, the quantities of each phase, and the
amounts of material to be exchanged — before the rate
of approach to equilibrium can be predicted or perhaps
significantly increased. However, it seems clear from the

reversible as could be expected in view of the fact that
each time the system is disturbed the return to
equilibrium requires that the composition of the entire
oxide phase must be changed by repeated recrystalli-
zation until it is brought to a homogeneous equilibrium
composition. : o

" The fluoride phase has been sampled frequently by
means of copper filter sticks, and uranium analysis of
these samples has been obtained in order to follow the

determine the concentrations of the other major com-
ponents of the fluoride phase and the composition of

quently, has been analyzed by x-ray diffraction.**® This

In some of these equilibrations, hydrogen was added
to the argon cover gas used in order to reduce to the
tetravalent state any traces of oxidized uranium which
might be present in the oxide phase. The equilibrium
quotients obtained in such cases agreed well with values
obtained in the absence of hydrogen, suggesting that
oxidized uranium had not been present in significant
amounts in the system.

When the uranium content of the oxide phase was
increased above Xy, , = 0.8, increasingly long equili-
bration times were required before the distribution
quotient became constant. Furthermore, some x-ray
analyses®3 indicated that oxide crystals of more than
one composition persisted for long periods in this
composition range. At Xyo, ~ 0.95, equilibrium
results have not yet been obtained. This decreasing
exchange rate is probably caused by decreasing solu-
bility of the oxide phase in the fluoride phase as Xy,
is increased. For future measurements in this region, we
plan to begin each experiment with prepared oxide
solid solutions and fluoride melts of nearly equilibrium
compositions.

The results obtained thus far (Fig. 12.8) with Xy,
< 0.8, with a salt phase of the composition LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (72-16-12<0.36), and with temperatures in
the range 580 to 780°C show that Q varies considerably
with the oxide composition and the temperature. The
results may be represented by the expression

It has been found, however, that Q is not significantly
changed when the composition of the fluoride phase is
varied while holding the composition of the oxide phase
constant (Table 12.10).

Since the exchange reaction, Eq. (1), involves two
ions of the same charge and nearly the same size, 0
might have been expected to be near unity. Actually,
however, it has been known for some time that UQ, is
much less soluble than is ThO, in these molten
fluorides,?# and hence Q should be considerably above
unity, as indeed is the case.

The dependence of Q on the composition of the
oxide phase, along with its lack of dependence on the
composition of the fluoride phase, shows the oxide
phase to be a nonideal regular solution with

wherein there is a zero excess entropy of mixing but a
positive heat of mixing. Finally, the simple two-
parameter expression for Q, above, indicates that the
entropy of the exchange reaction is also zero.

Upon completion of the measurements at high values
of X, vo,» We will investigate the distribution of Pa*
this system in order to define the behavior to be
expected in an MSBR fuel inadvertently contaminated
- with oxide and also to explore further the potential
applicability of this system to fuel reprocessing.

12.12 AN Ni-NiO-BeO ELECTRODE AS A
'REFERENCE ELECTRODE IN
MOLTEN FLUORIDES

B.F.Hitch C.F. Baes, Jr.

We have reported*® previously that the Ni-NiO-BeO
electrode showed promise as a reference electrode in
molten fluorides. The potential of this electrode is
established by a low (0.002 mole/kg at 600°C)*® Ni**
concentration produced by saturating 2L1F-Bng mix-
tures with both BeO and NiO. :

were completed. Since all the reactants and products
are of fixed activity, the measured cell potential should
be the standard cell potential £° and a function only of
temperature if the LiF-BeF, mixture is the same in
both half-cells.

- In our early potentiometric measurements of the
above cell, the compartment for the nickel electrode
was constructed of copper tubing with a copper frit (25
to 40 u porosity) welded onto the lower end. Excess
BeO and NiO were added to this compartment, and the
LiF-BeF, solution was then forced through the copper
frit into the compartment by a small gas pressure. A
nickel tube served as the nickel electrode and also
permitted gas sparging. Cell potentials were erratic, but
on various occasions we were able to achieve stable
potentials for as long as 24 hr. The major difficulty
encountered was that the cell potential would reach a
maximum value and then begin drifting toward a lesser
value. In an attempt to improve the performance of the
nickel electrode, we modified the compartment
described above by using a more dense copper frit (<10
g pore size), and in another version we used nickel
tubing clad in copper. Neither modification resulted in
any significant improvement in the behavior of the cell
potential,

Ni**INi electrode and the metal electrode compart-

ments could have been responsible for some of the
difficulties described above, we fabricated a compart-
ment using silica tubing and a silica frit. The silica

served as an electrical insulator for the nickel electrode

and contained the oxide-saturated 2LiF-BeF, mixture??’
An improved nickel electrode was also used in the silica
compartments. This electrode was fabricated by weld-
ing a small (% ¢ X 3% in.) rectangle of sintered metal to
Y -in. nickel rod. The sintered nickel was then
“painted” with an aqueous slurry of Ni{OH), and fired
at 1000°C. This provided a larger surface area for the
electrode reaction as well as a source of NiQ.

Using a silica compartment and the improved nickel
electrode, we obtained standard cell potentials (E°)
over a temperature range of 525 to 715°C, as shown in
Fig. 12.9. The standard cell potential is given by E° =
1.8872 — 0.000044T (v). Potential measurements were
made over a period of one week, and although the silica
was attacked by the fluoride melt, it did not rupture,
nor did the electrode potential show any appreciable
variation during this period. The standard cell potential
compares well with values calculated using the forma—
tion free energies of BeO*® and Ni0.4?

Measurements so far have been made in an LiF-BeF,;-
UF, (66-33-1) melt. Uranium trifluoride has been
formed by adding beryllium or zirconium metal as the
reductant. Results indicate that the first few additions
of reductant were consumed by impurities in the melt,
and even after careful purification a small amount of
impurities existed. From the potential measurements
the major impurity seems to be hydroxide ion. Repro-
ducible results have been difficult to obtain using
beryllium and zirconium metal as reductants. However,
results obtained using NiF, to oxidize the UF; are
reproducible but are not in agreement with cell poten-
tials calculated from available thermochemical data.
This inconsistency of about 40 mv will be investigated
further. '

The Nl”lNl electrode shows promise for use as a
reference electrode in molten fluorides. We hope to
improve the compartment assembly by using porous
BeO or ZrQ, instead of silica. Both of these materials
will be investigated in the near future.

12.13 EMF MEASUREMENTS WITH |
CONCENTRATION CELLS WITH
TRANSFERENCE IN MOLTEN MIXTURES
OF LiF AND BeF,

K. A.Romberger J. Braunstein

The correlation and interpretation of ionic transport
properties in molten fluoride systems, especially BeF,-
containing mixtures, is important in the development of
electroanalytical methods for the molten-salt . reactor
and for electrolytic separation processes.’' Here we
report measurements of the transference numbers of
Li* and Be?* in LiF-BeF, mixtures. _

Electromotive force measurements have been made of
the concentration cell with transference

I I

These measurements have covered the composition
range in the indicator half-cell (II) from 0.33 to 0.51
mole fraction BeF, at 500°C and from 0.27 to 0.70
mole fraction BeF, at 610°C. The reference half-cell (I)
contained 0.34 mole fraction BeF, at 500°C and 0.70
mole fraction BeF, at 610°.
~ The furnace®? and cell, the latter shown schemati-
cally in Fig. 12.10, were of silica. Spectrophoto-
metric’® and conductance’® measurements have
demonstrated the compatibility of silica containers with
these LiF-BeF, mixtures. Beryllium rod electrodes,
clamped to nickel rods, were dipped in melt in the bulk
compartment (II) and in the small reference half-cells.
The liquid junction between the two compartments was
made through coarse-grade (150-u) fritted silica disks.
These disks have relatively little surface area and ensure
a conduction path through liquid rather than through a
silica membrane. Behl and Egan had reported drift of
emf with fine-porosity silica frits in emf measurements
with molten chlorides and adopted powdered alumina
as the diffusion barrier.55 No such drift was observed
with our silica frits.

The smaller reference compartment (I) was filled
initially from melt contained in the larger indicator
compartment (II). The initial emfs were 0 + 1.7
mv. The composition of the bulk compartment was
changed by stepwise additions of BeF, and also LiF
at each temperature while measuring the emf, E,.
The emf equilibrated within about 15 min after an
addition of BeF, or LiF, the approximate time re-
quired for salt dissolution and reestablishment of
temperature control. Mechanical stirring through a
Teflon seal, under a dried helium atmosphere,

- speeded equilibration,

The emf of cell I is shown as a function of
composition in Fig. 12.11. At 500° the composition
was first vared from 0.34 to 0.51 mole fraction
BeF, by additions of BeF,. It was then lowered to
0.33 mole fraction BeF, by additions of LiF. At
610°C the composition was varied from 0.70 to

0.27 and then back to 0.33 mole fraction BeF,.

Values of E, for both LiF and BeF, additions fell
on the same line within +2 mv. Additions of LiF
and BeF, were made through a ball valve under
helium pressure. Lithium fluoride was previously
sintered under hydrogen, while BeF, was a clear
glass which had been vacuum distilled in nickel. The -
LiF-BeF, mixture (0.34 mole fraction BeF,) was
filtered through fritted nickel under hydrogen before
use.

At 610°C, Egs. (3b) and (4) both yield values for

concentrations (see Fig. 12.11). For the composition
range 0.50 < xg,p, < 0.70, the error in E,,
approximately 15%, wh11e for the range 060 <

The large uncertainties in E,, in this composition
range render use of the derivative relation (3b)
imprecise. On a plot of E, vs E,, the value of E,,
at 0.60 mole fraction BeF, falls about 2 mv below
the smooth curve through the other points, this
smooth curve corresponding to #;; = 1.0 * 0.05.

lithium ion (relative to fluoride) in mixtures con-
taining 0.34 and 0.51 mole fraction BeF, are, re-
spectively, 40 X 107 and 2,7 X 107™* cm? sec™

for. Li* in LiCl-PbCl, mixtures and for K* in
KC1-MgCl, mixtures, but are similar to those for Mg**
in KC1-MgCl, mixtures.’®) The mobility of beryllium
ion is zero within the experimental error. A negative
value of tg,, corresponding to the reported experi-
mental uncertainty (t5, = 0 ¥ 0.05), seems highly
unlikely since it would imply that beryllium ions move

toward the anode faster than fluoride ions.

Additional emf measurements are in progress to
extend the range of temperatures and BeF, concentra-
tions. Measurements will be made in metal (Mo, Ta)
systems to verify inertness of the silica apparatus and to
permit the use of LiBi) alloy electrodes, which react
with silica. With both Be and Li(Bi)-alloy reference

‘electrodes, £, and E; can both be determined in one

experiment, Thls will prowde an independent check of
activity data in the LiF-BeF, system and extend the
results to composition regions where gas electrodes,
used in previous measurements, are difficult to employ.
Precise determination of the transference numbers
should make it possible to use beryllium electrodes in
fritted compartments as thermodynamic reference
electrodes, for example, for the evaluation of free
energies and enthalpies of mixing. High BeF, concen-
trations in the reference compartment retard mixing
and increase electrode lifetime.

- 12.14 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF
MOLTEN KNO; -

G.D. Robbins J. Braunstein

Specific conductances k are obtained from measured
resistance R by employing the relation

x =(1/R) (Ifa) , 0

where I/a is the cell constant. The value of Ifz usually is
obtained by measuring the resistance of a material of
known specific conductance, preferably one having
properties similar to the system to be investigated.

In the course of investigating electrical conductivities
of molten fluoride systems of relevance to the MSRE
and MSBR programs, it became necessary to select a
reference salt for use in the determination of cell
constants, Based on ease of handling, availability,
stability to atmospheric conditions, and compatibility
with container materials — especially silica — molten
potassium nitrate seemed the most reasonable choice
among molten salts for such a reference material.
However, the results of reported investigations in this
system at temperatures up to 100°C above the melting
point differ by amounts considerably larger than the
claimed experimental uncertainty.

‘In a recent review of electnca] conductance meas-
urements in molten fluorides,’® errors arising from the
use of a Wheatstone-type (or Jones) conductance bridge
were discussed. Some possible origins of frequency
variation of the measured resistance were also pre-
sented,

The object of this work was a careful measurement of
specific conductance as a function of temperature for

 molten potassium nitrate to provide reliable values for

use in cell constant determination in our molten-
fluoride program. Because of the frequent use of
potassium nitrate as a reference point in studies of
transport properties of molten salts,5®~%3 accurate

dependence are important quantities in their own right
to the physical chemistry of molten salts.

As discussed previously, errors can arise in deter-
mining molten-salt conductivities from the use of

resistance and capacitance. Accordingly, a specially
constructed bridge®® with series components in the
balancing arm was employed in measuring resistances in
the molten nitrate. The type of silica conductance cell
used here has been previously described.®S For the
determination of the cell constant a 0.1-demal aqueous
potassium chloride solution (prepared from single-
crystal KCI) was used, for which the specific con-
ductance is well established.6¢+®7 The resistance of the
aqueous electrolyte was determined in a controlled-
temperature bath at 25°C employing the Jones bridge
because of the large resistances involved.

For measurements in the molten nitrate the maxi-
mum peak-to-peak  voltage applied to the series-
component bridge was 30 to 110 mv, and the measured
resistance did not varv with frequency (<0.2 ohm *
0.2%, random) from 1 to 20 kilohertz. More specific
experimental detail may be found in ref. 68.

Table 12.11 shows specific conductance vs tempera-
ture data for molten potassium nitrate as determined
with the series-component bridge. To check for possible
errors in conductance due to nitrite formatlon the
following procedure was adopted:

Between each resistance determination at successwely
higher temperatures, the resistance was measured near
the melting point (see Fig. 12.12). It was planned to
discard the last datum at the elevated temperature when
a low-temperature value failed to duplicate the pre-
viously determined values. However, no- discrepancy
appeared up to 541°C, the temperature limit of the
furnace. From this one might conclude either that

sufﬁmently little nitrite had formed to be detected or

that the specific conductances of KNO; and KNO,
were identical within the limits of measurements, in
which case the results remained valid. However, the

- possibility exists for identical conductivities near 350°C
‘with divergent values appearing at increased tempera-

tures. Accordingly, an addition of 5 mole % KNO, was
made, which resulted in the datum represented by the

12.15 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF
MOLTEN BERYLLIUM FLUORIDE

G.D.Robbins J. Braunstein

As part of an investigation of the temperature
dependence of electrical conductivities in the molten
LiF-BeF, system, a preliminary study of the variation
of conductance with temperature in pure molten
beryllium fluoride has been completed. In addition to
its importance as a primary component of fuel and
coolant salts for the MSRP, much fundamental interest
is centered on the conductance of molten BeF, because
of its ability to supercool, allowing approach toward
the theoretical “‘glass-transition—zero-mobility” tem-
perature. One might thus expect marked non-Arrhenius
behavior in its transport properties (particularly vis-
cosity and electrical conductivity). Yet such behavior
was not found for the viscosity over many orders of
magnitude.”®

The extremely high viscosity (>7 X 10° poises at
600°C)?° and the network structure of molten BeF,
pose special probIems in the measurement of specific
conductance due to the large resistances involved.
Consequently, a different type of electrode configura-
tion from that previously described was employed in
this investigation. This consisted of two parallel
L-shaped platinized platinum wires (20 gage) immersed
directly into the melt to a depth of 7 mm. A silica
thermocouple well, dipping into the melt and at-
tached to the electrode assembly, contained a cali-
brated Pt vs Pt—10% Rh thermocouple for accurate
temperature measurement (+0.2°C). The cell constant
at 7 mm depth of immersion was determined to be
0.638 ohm™ cm™ (25%) in 0.01-demal KCl solu-
tion,”! prepared from single-crystal potassium chloride.

Hand-picked glass-clear pieces of distilled beryllium
fluoride?? were loaded, in a dry box, into a silica cell of
the type previously described”® and melted in a helium
atmosphere. A silica-Lavite furnace”® permitted visual

slowly disappeared with heating during the first day of
operation. Small immobile gas bubbles were observed to
form and adhere to the silica wall about the third day.
(This was probably SiF, formed via the reaction 2BeF,
+ Si0, = SiF, T + 2Be0.) A wisp of particulate matter
could also be seen in the bulk; otherwise the melt
appeared clear and colorless. Neither bubbles nor
particulate matter was observed in the conducting
region between the electrodes. No change in appearance
occurred during the subsequent 11 weeks the molten
fluoride remained in the cell (except an occasional
initiation of crystallization during supercooling). At the
end of this period, analysis of samples from the interior
of the frozen melt (all of which was glass clear) showed
the following impurities (in ppm by weight): 3 Fe, 15
K, 50 Li, and 100 Na. Other metals detectable by
semiquantitative spectrographic analysis were below the
limits of detection. While this impurity level is higher
than desirable, it is several orders of magnitude lower
than the only previous investigation in this system.”®
The Jones conductance bridge’® was tested with
dummy components in place of the cell (calibrated
resistances and 20 uf capacitance, connected in series)
as a function of frequency to ascertain the accuracy
which could be expected with the very large experi-
mental resistances (considerably greater than those for
which the bridge was designed). For a given level of
accuracy the range of frequency over which this
accuracy could be maintained decreased as the re-
sistance increased. For 1% accuracy the available
frequency range for resistances of 1 X 10° ohms was
0.3 to 10.0 kilohertz, while the range decreased to
0.6—2.0 kilohertz, for resistances of 1 X 10° ohms.
(For resistances of the order of 1 X 107 ohms, 3%

accuracy was possible only over the frequen'cy range

- 0.80 to 0.90 kilohertz.) Measured resistances of the cell
containing molten BeF, ranged from 8 X 10* to 8 X
10° ohms and were invariant with frequency within the
accuracy limits of the bridge. This is an indication
(although not proof) that the conductance is not by
minor electroactive impurities, which would very likely

result in frequénéy-dependent conductance if the

impurities were oxidized or reduced at the electrodes.
This is especially so due to the large peak-to-peak
~ voltages of 0.1 to 2.0 v which had to be applied
(depending on the magnitude of the resistance) to
obtain a detectable current of 1 to 5 ua. Even with the

large resistances encountered here, the silica appeared
to be an electrical insulator, and no parallel con-
ductance through the silica could be detected.

Specific conductances, k, for molten BeF, obtained
after two weeks and after three weeks are presented in
Fig. 12.13 for the temperature range 685 to 530°C —
the latter temperature being 25° below the melting
point. Also shown are data (triangles) obtained during
“the last eight weeks of the experiment which represent
long equilibration periods before measurement. These
periods ranged from 5 to 75 hr, depending on the
temperature, often with repeated monitoring to ensure
that true equilibrium had been attained. The absence of
long-term drift in the data is an indication that no
corrosion sufficient to affect the results occurred. Data
obtained during the first several days of the experiment
(not shown) varied from day to day, with points falling
on both sides of the curve, This behavior is possibly due
to the slow migration to the surface and evolution from
the melt of inert-gas microbubbles too small to be
visible. The extreme viscosity of this material reflects,
in slow motion, effects which normally would have
terminated before measurement began.

13. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reactor Fuel
| Reprocessing Technology

Current design of the two-region, single-fluid MSBR
includes provisions for chemically reprocessing the
reactor fuel for isolation of 233Pa and for removing
rare-earth fission products. Development efforts for
these processes have pursued the reductive extraction
concept whereby constituents of ‘the fuel salt are
selectively extracted into molten bismuth containing
either lithium or thorium as the reducing agent. The
chemical feasibility of 233Pa isolation has been
demonstrated by a process which also requires the prior
reduction of uranium from the salt mixture and its
subsequent oxidation into the salt effluent of the 2**Pa

_extraction column. Chemical researches are engaged in

further evaluation of the supporting equilibrium data
and in determination of the chemical behavior of those
fission products and salt impurities which will be
simultaneously extracted in the 232Pa isolation process.
The rare-earth removal process will likely utilize the
barren salt effluent of the 233Pa isolation process.
Although the chemical feasibility of the salt-bismuth
extraction process for removal of rare earths has been
demonstrated, their separation from thorium, a major
constituent of the salt phase, may be insufficient for
engineering design purposes. Present studies seek other
molten-metal systems, metal additives to bismuth, and
varied process applications to achieve improved rare-
earth separations. . - '

13.1° SIMULTANEOUS EXTRACTION
' OF ZIRCONIUM AND URANIUM AND OF
ZIRCONIUM AND PROTACTINIUM

D.M.Moulton J. H. Shaffer '

It is known that the solubility in bismuth of uranium
and zirconium together is much less than when they are
separate. For example, Weinberg ef al! report the
solubility of uranium at 400°C to be about 1400 ppm,
while at 210 ppm zirconium it falls to under 1100.
(Zirconium solubility by itself is about 360 ppm.) From
these data it is not possible to make an accurate

extrapolation to 600°, but the effect of zirconium on
uranium solubility seems to rise slightly with higher
temperatures. Zirconium is produced in large amounts
as a fission product. Earlier work? had indicated that it
would be extracted from LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) a

little less easily than uranium.

It is important to know where zirconium will extract

"in a single-fluid reactor salt and also whether there will
~ be any interaction with uranium in the bismuth phase,

affecting either the extractability or the solubility.
These systems have been investigated in the single-fluid
salt LiF-BeF,-ThF, (68-20-12 mole %). Zirconium
analyses, which had been a source of trouble earlier,
were made by counting the ®°Zr on a lithium-drifted
germanium diode, which will resolve this peak from
that of its daughter, **Nb. Chemical and spectro-
chemical analyses for zirconium gave generally good
checks with this method. Graphite apparatus was used
throughout. _

In the first experiment 2.97 kg of salt containing 6.06
g of labeled zirconium as ZrF, was extracted with 3.00
kg of bismuth at 600 and 700° using portions of
thorium metal as the reductant. About 6.2 g of uranium
metal was next added, and the system was hydro-
fluorinated to oxidize the uranium and the zirconjum.
The reduction was then repeated as before. In the
second experiment, 3.97 kg of salt with 6.05 g of
zirconium and about 1 mc of 233Pa was extracted with
3.00 kg of bismuth in the usual fashion at 600 and
700°. |

In the first part of the first experiment, the object
was to determine the extractability of zirconium alone.
‘The reduction potential difference between lithium and
thorium was 0.09 v lower than had been found several

times before in this salt. It seemed that abnormally high

lithium values were responsible, so this voltage has been
added to both the Li-Th and Li-Zr potentials. No such
anomaly appeared at 700°. Zirconium balance was good
throughout the experiment. The potentials found in the
first half of this experiment are as follows:

Ferris et al.® report Egqp, — Egz, = —0.25 at 600° for a
somewhat different salt (69.2-19.4-11.4 mole %) of
higher free fluoride content.

The potentials found in the second half of this
experiment are listed below:

Temperature .

Here again there is no difference within the accuracy of
the ' measurements. Protactinium balance was good
throughout the experiment. The maximum zirconium
concentration in the metal (1900 ppm) was not far
from the 2020 ppm added originally. From the
protactinium-zirconium difference in this experiment
and the protactinium-uranium difference in the older
one,one can find £y — Egyy = —0.018 at both 600 and
700°; this is derived from experiment where uranium

and zirconium were present separately and is about the

same as that where they were together.

The error limits on these experiments prevent any
positive claims of solute-solute interaction in these
experiments. Nevertheless, there is some indication that
protactinium is easier to extract in the presence of

Within the error of the measurements there is no
difference in the zirconium behavior with and without
uranium. The zirconium and uranium balances were not
good, however. The maximum of these found in the
metal (when they were essentially gone from the salt)

was about 900 and 1400 ppm, respectively, or 45 and
67% of that present and 30 and 10% of saturation at
600°. We had reached 1900 ppm zirconium, or 95% of
that added, in the first part of the experiment. Ferris*

reached 2900 ppm uranium and 2200 ppm zirconium at
600° using filtered samples. He found Egry — Eyy, =

'—0.243 and E,;, .— Eyy = —0.002 in a salt of

composition 72-16-12 mole %.

In the zirconium-protactinium extraction the effect
of zirconium on protactinium could be observed but
not the converse, since only tracer protactinium was
used. The potentials are shown in the table. In the last
column are shown the potentials obtained in an earlier
protactinium-uranium extraction from the same salt.

 

zirconium and that zirconium and uranium are both
harder to extract when together than when separate.
Protactinium-zirconjum separation should be quite
easy; the uranium-zirconium separation may be rather
difficult.

at 630° for about seven days, during which time the
only changes involved changing the sparge gas between
argon and helium, flowing or static. The protactinium
and uranium concentrations were essentially constant
regardless of the sparge gas or flow condition. The
protactinium and uranium were then returned to the
salt phase by oxidation with H,-HF, and reduction was
again effected (part 2) but this time with incremental
thorium additions. With the melt temperature at 630°C

(part 2A) additions were continued until thorium

solubility in bismuth at this temperature was exceeded.
The temperature was then increased to 805°C and
equilibrium reestablished (part 2B).

- EXTRACTION OF PROTACTINIUM FROM
SINGLE-FLUID MSBR FUEL SALT BY
THORIUM IN MOLTEN BISMUTH

R.G. Ross C.E.Bamberger C.F.Baes, In.

Successful reductive extraction of 231Pa at the
100-ppm level from a single-region MSBR fuel compo-
sition by thorium in liquid bismuth has been demon-
strated by Ferris et al® and by Barton et al (Sect.

'13.2). Additional measurements have since been under-

 

61.. M. Ferris, MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug 31,
1968, ORNL-4344,

taken by us to help determine accurately the equilib-
rium quotient for the extraction reaction

Pa*'(F) + Th®(Bi) = Pa%(Bi) + Th*(F) , (N

ors = Xpa0 ) Xp,(F)
Th Xppo(Bi)/ XypeH(F)’

and to determine also whether this quotient depends
significantly on the concentration of Pa°® and/or U° in
the bismuth phase. While the previous studies indicate
that reproducible results should be obtained when
molybdenum is used as a container material, such data
in fact have been difficult to obtain. These additional
measurements therefore seemed especially desirable in
view of the importance of good equilibrium data to the
development of a fuel reprocessing method employing
reductive extraction.

The present measurements were performed in a
molybdenum-lined nickel vessel (Fig. 13.1) equipped
with a gas lift to provide improved mixing of the
phases. (Tests in a silica container revealed that gas
sparging alone produces negligible mixing of molten
bismuth into the molten fluoride) To avoid the
possibility that appreciable amounts of impurities such
as water or oxygen might be introduced by a once-
through sparging gas system, a recirculating gas system
was used. The circuit included a neoprene-diaphragm
pump, the gas lift in the extraction vessel, a fritted
nickel filter in the gas exit line, an NaF trap (for any
trace of HF), and an Mg(Cl04), trap. The experiments
were performed at 625°C + 2° using ~250 g of
single-region salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,, 72-16-12 mole %) to
which initially 23 'Pa and 233Pa were added and later
0.25 mole % UF, was added. This was hydrofluorinated
in situ together with 250 g of bismuth in the molyb-
denum liner. Hydrogen gas sparging for 4 to 6 hr
followed, and then the hydrogen was replaced by argon
at 4 to 5 psig before recirculation was started. Crystal

bar thorium metal was added as:the reducing agent.

Stainless steel filter sticks were used for sampling the
bismuth phase, and copper filter sticks were used for
sampling the salt phase. Molybdenum filter sticks were
also fabricated and tested by sampling both phases.
These, unlike filter sticks of stainless steel or copper,
are fully compatible with both phases. They were
mechanically satisfactory, and the surface oxide can be

-~ easily reduced with hydrogen at 1000°C.

“Thus far, two successful runs have been made in the
absence of uranium and one with uranium present. In
the first series of measurements it was found, surpris-
ingly, that quite large amounts of thorium could be

 
 

 

added to the bismuth phase — Xy, o(Bi) calculated to
reach 0.0014 — with very little protactinium extraction,
and even this small amount decreased slowly with time.
It was surmised that the thorium was consumed by an
oxidizing impurity present in relatively large amounts.
The contents of the vessel were re-treated with HF-H,
and hydrogen. After this second treatment, thorium
metal additions produced protactinium extractions in
the absence of uranium (Fig. 13.2) which agree well
with results obtained previously by Barton in the
presence of 0.26 mole % UF,. (The cause of the initial
thorium consumption without protactinium extraction,
we are tempted to speculate, was molybdenum oxide,
initially present and not completely reduced in the
initial treatment of the salt.) Uranium tetrafluoride was
then added to bring its concentration in the salt phase

analysis for Barton’s results.

Interestingly, it appears that in all these measure-
ments, ~10™* mole fraction of thorium was ineffective
in extracting protactinium. This could have been caused
by a small amount of some unknown substance, present
in reproducible amounts in the bismuth, which com-
bined with this much thorium, the product remaining in
solution. A more likely possibility, we believe, is that
this effect is caused by ZrF, which was present initially
in the salt at ~150 ppm. This should have been
extracted by the thorium and could then have been
mistaken for thorium in the subsequent colorimetric
determinations. It would be included as well in the
material balance calculation of the thorium in the
bismuth phase.

13.4 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION OF RARE
EARTHS FROM MOLTEN MIXTURES OF
LiF, BeF,, AND ThF, INTO BISMUTH

D. M. Moulton J. H. Shaffer

Studies of the equilibrium distribution of cerium,
neodymium, and samarium between the simulated
MSBR solvent mixture, LiF-BeF, -ThF,4 (72-16-12 mole
%), and bismuth have been completed. Values for their
distribution coefficients, Dy ,, and their separation
factors, Dy /D1y, at 600 and 700°C when the bismuth
was saturated with thorium are as follows:

 

 

- The correlation of Dp, vs Dy, where Dy =
Xymeiy/Xm(r), in Fig. 13.3 is excellent, giving the
expected slope of %;, which confirms that protactinium
is tetravalent and uranium is trivalent under these
extraction conditions. " 'his correlation further indicates
that interactions of U® and Pa® do not occur in the
bismuth phase at the concentration levels involved.
From the results in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3 we have:

QY =D¥3/D, =121(625°C),
gk =D /D =1450(625°C) .

One result reported by Barton et 2l may be used to
calculate

QP2 =414 (805°C) .

The two results are given within their uncertainty by

log QP2 =2830/T .

This would indicate that AS for the extraction reaction
(1) is zero, a result which could well be general for such

in the salt phase and metal of similar character in the

* bismuth phase. The value of QF2 is unaffected by the

presence of up to 7000 ppm uranium in the bismuth
phase. | o

In our future measurements we expect to extend the
present study to include the extraction behavior of
protactinium and uranium when they are both present |
at high concentrations (e.g., 1500 ppm each) in the
bismuth phase.

These separation factors are based on Dy, = 0.021 at

The investigation of salt composition effects on the
reductive extraction of cerium into bismuth was ex-
tended to two additional salt compositions.” In the
mixture LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-30-3 mole %), the extrac-
tion of cerium by thorium can be described by the
equation

K=D¢ /D3, =82at600°C.

At the limiting reduction potential of thorium satura-
tion in bismuth, the distribution coefficient for cerium
is -about 0.26 and the separation factor is about 3.2 at
600°C. The equilibrium distribution of cerium between
the salt solvent mixture, LiF-BeF,-ThF, (76.8-6.2-17
mole %), and bismuth yielded a value of about 5.3 for
the equilibrium constant X at 600°C. At thorium

saturation in bismuth, the distribution coefficient for

cerium is about 0.064 and its separation factor is about

4.4 at 600°C, This salt composition was proposed for a
reprocessing scheme which would precede the reductive
“extraction process by a vacuum distillation process. The

experimental results obtained for both of these salt
mixtures are in fair agreement with the “free fluoride”
model of M. A. Bredig for describing salt solvent effects
on the extraction equilibrium.

13.5 METAL PHASES OTHER THAN
BISMUTH FOR RARE-EARTH EXTRACTION

D. M. Moulton  J. H. Shaffer

By now it is well known that the extraction of rare
earths from thorium-containing molten fluorides into
bismuth requires large bismuth volumes, because of the
low solubility of thorium, and gives rather small
rare-earth—thorium separations. While it is possible to
design a reprocessing facility using this system, there
could be practical advantages in changing the metal
phase to reduce one or both of these difficulties.

There is not a good theoretical basis for choosing an
alternative metal system, though, as discussed presently,
our understanding of the nature of these mixtures is
growing. We have investigated a number of combina-
tions using a new technique, shown in Fig. 13.4. A 2-g
sample of the metal contained in a small graphite cup
serves as the cathode for the electrolytic reduction of
labeled cerium from a 3.9-kg melt of LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(68-20-12 mole %) at 700°. A beryllium rod is used as a
sacrificial anode and also as a reference at zero current.
After a few hundred milliampere-hours of electrolysis
(the exact time is determined, somewhat intuitively,
when the potential levels out), the entire metal sample
is removed and analyzed. The amount of material
extracted does not affect the salt composition signifi-
cantly, so it can be reused many times. The pool of
bismuth in the bottom of the steel vessel extracts some
of the thorium daughters (Pb-Bi-Tl} which might
otherwise confuse the radiochemical analysis; it is not
sampled or used in any other way.

This method is useful for screening metal combi-
nations because it takes only a few hours per sample, in
contrast to the old way where a large metal pool was in
the bottom and a new vessel and salt had to be prepared
for each combination. So far we have not been able to
get very quantitative results because we cannot de-
termine the point of thorium saturation very well and
any precipitate is necessarily included with the sample.
For this reason the metals are here simply grouped into
the three categories listed in Table 13.2: those ex-
tracting more, about the same (within a factor of 2),
and less cerium than pure bismuth (per weight of
solvent metal).

It will be noted that Bi-Au is not a good extractant, in
contrast to what had been reported earlier.® In the
present experiment the solvent contained 30% gold
rather than 3% and apparently has rather different

properties. The Sn and Sn-Cu both contained amounts
of Th far in excess of the saturation value for pure Sn.
ThSn; undoubtedly precipitated, and the high cerium
count probably is due to a solid solution of CeSn; in
this; the structure is the same (Cu3Au), and the lattice
parameters are practically identical. We did not really
expect the tin-, lead-, and zinc-based systems to be very
good, but this was based on reasoning too speculative to
exclude such easy experiments. -

The magnesium- and aluminum-based solvents,
especially the former, extracted quite a lot of rare
earth. The thorium content of the aluminum was also
high (the Mg was not analyzed by this writing). Cerium
separation in these systems is probably lower than in
bismuth. Thus they may be better suited for removing
the thorium and leaving rare earths behind. The
investigation of these and other metal combinations is
continuing, f

In addition to the experimental results, increasing
familiarity with liquid-metal systems in general allows
us to make certain observations on the possible alterna-
tives to bismuth. Ideally one would like a liquid-metal
system which will form strong intermetallics with the
rare earths and weak ones or none with thorium,
Thorium and the rare earths are similar enough as
metals so that this solvent probably does not exist, at
least not if it contains one of the low-melting non-
transition metals, Starting with bismuth, we can con-
sider what additives might stabilize the rare earths more
than thorium. Alkalis and alkaline earths will not help.
Metals in the first half of the transition series are likely
to be of little use and are scarcely soluble anyway.
Those in the second half will form intermetallics with
rare earths and thorium, but the thorium compounds
will probably be stronger, except perhaps for the
coinage metals. Many of these compounds owe their

stability to geometric structures which will not persist

in dilute solution. Posttransition metals form increas-
ingly strong compounds with partially ionic bonding.
Here the stabilization of the rare earths will be

" somewhat greater, as is seen with bismuth. To be useful, -

however, the relative stabilities of the rare-earth and
thorium intermetallics must be such as to overcome the
* substantial difference in stability of rare-earth and
thorium fluorides. A large enough difference between
rare-earth and thorium alloys will probably not be

- found in the more electropositive metals to the left of

bismuth. Of the elements which might form stronger
- compounds than bismuth, antimony seems to go in the
wrong direction, and arsenic, selenium, and tellurium
have not been tried. It is very likely that these
considerations will apply to extraction systems based

193

on any of the posttransition elements. In all of these
the solubility of the thorium intermetallics is a prob-
lem, and stronger intermetallics may be less soluble still.
The preliminary experimental results with lead, zinc,
tin, germanium, and indium are in agreement with these
predictions. _

It is not likely that there will be any solvents based on
the ordinary transition metals with low enough melting
points to be useful, though there are some interesting
eutectics of cerium with 15 to 30% of the elements
from Mn to Cu and also Agand Au that melt at 400 to
600° and should dissolve Th very well. They will
probably be rather strong reducing agents and will pose
severe containment problems.

Of the pretransition metals, only Mg and Al are worth
considering. These are the only good pure solvents for
thorium if Hg and Pu are excluded as impractical. They
are both quite active and will reduce the salt to some
extent, especially magnesium; thus some alloying to
lower their activity may be useful. However, this may
also lower the thorium solubility. _

In general, then, it looks as though improvements in
reductive extraction will be fairly small as long as
bismuth is used as the basis for the solvent. Of course,
small improvements could be very welcome. The use of
entirely different solvent systems containing mag-
nesium, aluminum, or cerium could result in much
higher thorium and rare-earth extraction, but there
would be some contamination of the salt by these
metals.

13.6 SEPARATION OF CERIUM FROM
THORIUM IN BISMUTH BY COLD ZONE
DEPOSITION OF THORIUM BISMUTHIDE

D.M. Richardson W.R.Grimes J. H. Shaffer

In experiments conducted thus far on the reductive
extraction of rare earths from LiF-BeF,-ThF4 mixtures
into bismuth, separation factors (Dy /D) of less than

10 have been found under equilibrium conditions and

at temperatures from 500 to 800°C. Although these
values may be sufficient for reprocessing the MSBR fuel
solvent . by the reductive extraction process, much
higher values could greatly improve the plant efficiency.
Accordingly, various parameters of the extraction
process principle are being investigated to improve its
application to' the reprocessing requirements of the
MSBR. To this end, an experiment is now in progress to
examine the cold zone deposition of thorium from
bismuth which also contains a dissolved rare earth. The
chemical feasibility of this application will depend on
the precipitation of pure ThBi, rather than a coprecipi-

tation with the metallic rare earth. The experimental
procedure embodies the extraction of cerium from a
simulated MSBR fuel solvent at 700°C into flowing
bismuth and its back extraction by hydrofluorination
into a recovery salt mixture, as shown schematically in
Fig. 13.5. The recirculating bismuth stream will be
contacted with solid thorium bismuthide at 700°C to
achieve its saturation with thorium. The exit stream
from the extraction vessel will pass through a cold trap
(outlet temperature of about 400°C) before flowing to

the recovery vessel. Thus the comparative transport of
cerium and thorium to the recovery salt will indicate

‘the effectiveness of the cold zone deposition applica-

tion, At the conclusion of the experiment the cold trap
will be drained of bismuth and sacrificed for analyses of
its cerium content and possxbly the composition of the
precipitating phase.

The objectives of this experiment have resulted in the
construction of a simple pump loop which utilizes an
electromagnetic device to achieve low flow rates of

bismuth. The hot trap and cold trap are of identical
construction and depend upon tightly packed stainless
steel demister material (Yorkmesh) for the retention of
solids. Each trap is equipped with Calrod heaters and
will be cooled by a countercurrent flow of an external
air-water stream. The extraction and recovery vessels
were fabricated from 4-in. iron pipe size (IPS) 304L
stainless steel pipe and are fitted with graphite cylinders
of % -in. wall thickness for primary containment of the
salt mixtures., Bottom penetrations provide for the
circulation of bismuth through each vessel, while top
penetrations provide for loading and sampling pro-
cedures. -

The experimental assembly contains approximately
35 kg of bismuth, which provides an approximate 1-in.
depth of bismuth -in each vessel. The fuel solvent
mixture will be simulated by approximately 2 kg of
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (68-20-12 mole %) which contains 100
ppm cerium and about 5 mc of !44Ce activity. Because

of relatively large requirements, thorium will be intro-

duced into the bismuth system by reduction from
LiF-BeF, -ThF, (68-20-12 mole %) by added beryllium
metal in the recovery section of the apparatus. When
thorium reduction is complete, the recovery salt will
have a composition of approximately 60 mole % LiF
and 40 mole % BeF, and a liquidus temperature of
about 450°C.

Experimental progress thus far has included the
circulation of bismuth in the system with the EM pump
at rates of about 50 to 200 cc/min, the addition of the
recovery salt mixture, and hydrofluorination of the
recovery salt while recirculating bismuth to remove
oxides from the metal phase. Beryllium metal is
currently being added to the recovery salt mixture
incrementally to achieve thorium reduction. Upon

ascertainment of near-complete removal of thorium

from the recovery salt and its collection in the
appropriate trap, the fuel solvent mixture will be loaded
into the extraction vessel. The progress of the experi-

ment will be monitored from radiochemical analyses of -

samples taken periodically from each salt phase and at
four locations in the metal phase system. The results of
chemical and spectrographic analyses of these samples
for thorium, lithium, and beryllium will provide further
description of the experimental results.

13.7 EXTRACTION OF THORIUM BY
ELECTROLYTIC REDUCTION INTO FLOWING
LIQUID LEAD FROM MOLTEN MIXTURES
" QFLiF, BeF,, ThF,, AND

RARE-EARTH FLUORIDES

D. M. Richardson J. H. Shaffer

The experimental result of earlier unreported work
was that rare earths did not reductively extract into
lead from molten LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %). A practical
use of this finding may be that the separation of rare
earths and thorium can be achieved by the reductive
extraction of thorium into lead with the rare-earth
fluorides remaining in the barren molten salt. Subse-
quently the thorium dissolved in lead would be back
extracted by hydrofluorination into a clean melt of
LiF-BeF,, and the resulting salt mix would be suitable
for the addition of uranium fluoride and recharging as
single-region breeder reactor fuel. In the absence of
thorium, rare earths can be effectively extracted from
the barren salt into molten bismuth,

Since the chemical feasibility of such a procedure
appeared promising, a small pump loop has been
constructed to test this process in a dynamic, non-
equilibrium system in which the reduction of thorium is
effected by electrolysis, The entire system was con-
structed of stainless steel and was assembled by inert
arc welding and is shown schematically as Fig. 13.6.
The extraction and recovery vessels are vertically
mounted 4-in. IPS tanks that are interconnected at the
bottoms by two parallel, horizontal %;-in. IPS lines. An
ac electromagnetic pump is installed in one of the lines.
The vessels are fitted with graphite sleeves of % -in. wall
thickness for primary containment of the salt mixtures.
Top penetrations provide for loading and sampling, gas
sparging and venting, and insertion of insulated probes
for electrolysis and level measurement.

The extraction vessel salt will be hydrogen sparged
and will be exposed at its center to a noble-metal
anode. A hydrogen-diffusion anode thimble of 75%
palladium—25% silver has been constructed for trial in
initial operation. The recovery vessel salt will be sparged
with a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride. In
addition to salt, both vessels will contain approximately
2 in. of recirculating liquid lead. Since the vessels are

- separately sparged and vented, and because the relative

 
 

 

196

height of the liquid columns is sensitive to small
differences in gas phase pressures, a liquid level inter-
- lock has been installed. When the liquid level in either
vessel is depressed more than a preset amount, a level

probe open circuit occurs which opens a fast-acting -

valve connecting the two gas volumes, turns off the
pump, and disconnects power supplied to the anode.
Manual reset is required. 7
The net effect of this process is to transfer the
thorium fluoride in one container of salt to another,
and the total mass of salt remains constant. In each
container, however, there are large changes of salt
volume and density from the beginning to the end of
the transfer. Provision_has been made to follow the
progress of the transfer on a periodic basis by meas-
urements of salt density using a bubble-pressure vs
liquid-depth probe. Additionally, salt samples will be
taken. ,

If the composition of the simulated MSBR fuel
solvent is selected as LiF-BeF,-ThF; (65-23-12 mole
%), the reduction and removal of all thorium electro-
lytically (i.e., no added metals) would result in the
binary mixture LiF-BeF, (73.8-26.2 mole %), which
melts at about 625°C. However, the lead stream at
saturation with thorium (~200 ppm) will contain about
10 ppm lithium. Thus, assuming a constant transport
ratio of 1.66 mole of Li per mole of Th, the resulting
binary salt mixture should contain about 66 mole % of
LiF and the balance of BeF, and should melt at less
than 500°C. Accordingly, this experiment will be
conducted with these salt mixtures. Experimental status
at this time is the successful operation of the pumped
loop with a charge of hydrogen-fired lead. After
additions of the appropriate salt batches, isothermal
operation at 600°C will be initiated.

14.1 DETERMINATION OF OXIDE
- IN MSRE FUEL

R. F. Apple J. M. Dale
A. S. Meyer

The first sample of the 232U fuel (FP 17-5) was
analyzed by the hydrofluorination procedure, and a
concentration of 61 ppm was determined. A satis-
factory recovery of oxide from an SnO, standard
indicated that the apparatus was functioning reliably.
This concentration does not differ significantly from
that found through the 235U operation (54 + 8
ppm).

During the last few analyses a potential failure of
the oxide apparatus was noted. Increasingly high

pressures are required to maintain the flow of gas

through the system during the hydrofluorination
step. This increased Ap apparently occurs across the
NaF trap that is used to separate HF from water in
the effluent gas. It is assumed that during the re-

‘peated absorption and regeneration steps the absorb-

ent particles degraded to form a more tightly packed

‘bed, particularly at the entrance end of the trap. As

these more closely packed particles swell durmg HF

absorption, the flow is restricted.

The problem has not yet interfered with any anal-
yses; but, on the basis of a rough extrapolation,
only a few more analyses can be made before it will
be necessary to replace the trap. The shutdown of

the MSRE is imminent, and thé replacement of the
trap would be expensive and involve radiation ex-

posure to personnel. It has been decided, therefore,

to defer replacement at this time and to restrict

determinations to essential MSRE samples. If the
technique is applied to the in-line analysis of MSR
salt streams, it will obviously be necessary to pro-
vide remotely replaceable traps.

14.2 DETERMINATION OF THE
OXIDATION STATE OF CONSTITUENTS
OF MSRE FUEL

J. M. Dale R. F. Apple
A. S. Meyer J. E. Caton
- C. M. Boyd

The measurement of the redox condition of the
233Q fuel is currently the most important analytical
development problem remaining for the MSRE. It is
believed to influence corrosion rates, it affects the
distribution of certain fission products within the
reactor system, and it is readily adjustable via the
addition of beryllium metal. Accordingly, the main
development effort has been directed toward the
development of techniques for this measurement.
Three diverse approaches have been pursued.

14.2.1 Determinatien of Total Reducing
Power of MSR Salts

A sealed-tube dissolution technique has been ap-
plied to the determination of the total reducing
power of radioactive MSRE fuel. Preliminary feasi-

. bility studies of this approach are described else-

where.! A special apparatus was required for this
determination. The requirements were that the ap-
paratus would provide a means of evacuation and

. sealing of the dissolution tubes and be compact
‘enough to be transferred between hot cells. A

and contains a thin-walled ampul containing about 6
ml of evacuated 6 M HCI-H;BO;. dissolver solution
(see Fig. 14.2). The neck of the tube is then passed
through the platinum-wound furnace and connected
to the manifold via a standard taper joint. The
dissolution tube is then evacuated with the cryogenic
sorption pump (13X molecular sieve at liquid-
nitrogen temperatures) and sealed off with the fur-
nace. The ampul is broken by shaking, and the
dissolution tube is sealed in a steel bomb and heated
to 250°C under a suitable overpressure for 16 hr.
When the dissolution is completed, the break-seal
end of the tube is connected to the left-hand port
of the manifold, and a receiver tube is connected
through the fumnace and evacuated. After the dis-
solver solution is frozen in liquid nitrogen, the break

seal is broken, and the evolved hydrogen is distrib--

uted through the system. The receiver tube is also

cooled in liquid nitrogen to minimize thermal diffu-
sion effects, and a standard addition of helium (1 cc
at 38 mm pressure) is made through the stopcock at
the top of the apparatus. After a 15-min period of
equilibration the receiver tube is sealed off and re-
moved from the hot cell for mass spectrographic
determination of the H,/He ratio. The solution is
transferred to an empty dissolver tube, which is
sealed off and carried through the entire procedure
to determine the amount of hydrogen generated by
radiolysis.

A modification of the dissolution technique was

necessary for hot-cell operations. The conventional
technique of adding a weighed amount of dry ice to
the bomb provides a suitable -overpressure for labora-
tory dissolutions, but an undetermined quantity of
the dry ice evaporates during the longer period re-
quired for remote sealing. Simulated tests indicated
that approximately 50% of the dissolution tubes
would be broken during hot-cell dissolutions. A com-
parison of the vapor-pressure curves of the common
stable organic reagents with extrapolated values of
 

 

 

 

the pressures reported for 6 M HCI? revealed that
the pressure of the dissolver solution was most
closely paralleled by that of methyl alcohol. When
10 ml of methyl alcohol was sealed into the bombs,
. no breakage occurred.

The method was originally developed to determine
free metals in the reprocessed solvent salt. When the
apparatus was completed, uranium additions to the
fuel had already been started, and an attempt was
made to apply it to the determination of U(III).
The results of the analyses of two fuel samples are
summarized in Table 14.1,

During the period between samplings sufficient
beryllium metal was added to the reactor fuel to
increase the yield of hydrogen by 0.55 micromole/g.
Also, some LiUF;s fuel concentrate was added. The
calculated increase in the hydrogen yields was not
obtained. It is evident that the method in its present
form is not suitable for the determination of U(III)
in these samples.

The hydrogen is derived pre-

because a fragment that represents only about 2% of

the sample is taken, any inhomogeneities in the
distribution of the metals in the frozen salt would
yield nonrepresentative samples. Also, the weighing
and transfer of the salt fragments in the hot cell is
time consuming, and this atmospheric exposure may
introduce significant indeterminate oxidation errors.

The technique offers high sensitivity, and a special-
ized sampling approach will undoubtedly prove of
value for reducing-power measurements of other
types of MSRP samples. As time permits, studies
will be resumed to determine its ultimate sensitivity
and precision and to determine its limitations as to
sample size and types of salts that can be d;ssolved

14.2.2 Determination of U(III) in Radioactive
. MSRE Fuel by a Hydrogen Reduction Method

The application of this method to the determina-
tion of U(III) in the original 235U fuel and the

tion of 233U fuel, an apparatus was assembled to
simulate the hydrogenation of radioactive salt sam-
ples. This apparatus consisted of a copper block
furnace fitted with a nickel liner of internal diam-
eter equal to that of a sample ladle, appropriate
sparging and exit tubes, and an addition port. The
hydrogenator was heated with a precision furnace
that maintained a temperature differential of less
than 5°C over the region occupied by the sample.
Provision was also made to change the depth of the
melts to determine whether equilibrium was closely
approached during the hydrogen transpirations.
Before salt was added to the hydrogenator, pulses
of HF in a stream of hydrogen were passed through
the system to determine the time constant of -the
apparatus. A portion of the HF was delayed in the
apparatus. This delay is apparently caused by adsorp-
tion on the surface of the hydrogenator, since the
effect becomes less pronounced when successive
pulses are introduced. The period of delay is on the
order of 1 hr and is the result of chemisorption, as

_the retention period increases with temperature. The

development of a remote method for the measure-

ment of HF generated by the hydrogenation of the
current 233U fuel have been described previously.3*

HF was demonstrated to be adequate for the meas-

adsorption is stronger on nickel than on copper
surfaces. By comparison of the shape of the HF
pulses with those of an unadsorbed gas, argon, the

_quantities of HF adsorbed were estimated to be
- about 2 to 3 micromoles. Adsorption of such quan-

tities of HF would not introduce a significant error
in the results of the analysis of the 22U fuels, but
a complex correction would be required for- the
lower yields expected from the 233U fuel. It should
be noted that while the adsorption of HF compli-
cates batch analyses of the fuel, it would not inter-
fere with in-line methods. Surfaces would become
rapidly saturated, so that the steady-state concentra-

tion of HF in the effluent would correspond to its
rate of production in the fuel.

Investigation of the method was discontinued
temporarily because the voltammetric method, de-
scribed in the following section, gave pronuse of
more immediate results.

-14.2.3 Voltammetric Determination of
U(IV)/U(III) Ratios in MSRE Fuel

An apparatus has been designed to permit electro-
chemical measurements in a sample of radioactive
MSRE fuel. The objective of this work is to measure
the potential (£ 3/ 4) of the U(IV) to U(III) reduc-
tion wave vs the potential (£) of a platinum refer-
ence electrode which is poised by the bulk concen-
tration of W(IV) and U(IIl) in the melt. The differ-
ence between these two potentials gives a measure
of the U(IV)/U(III) ratio, as shown in Fig. 14.3.
This has been verified in nonradioactive melts, and
the experimental results are described in the next
section of this report.

The electrochemical cell (Fig. 14.4) was designed
so that the measurements could be made directly in
the sampling ladle. The ladle is cut at a prescored
point below the level of the salt, and the lower
portion, which contains the bulk of the salt, is
placed in a nickel liner. Both are then placed in the
cell. This operation can be completed in about 5
min to minimize atmospheric contamination of the
sample. The top of the cell is fitted with a Teflon
bushing which is penetrated by three '%-in. metal
electrode support rods and a sparging tube. The
electrodes (~50-mil platinum-rhodium wire) are
sheathed with boron nitride insulators, which define
their area and prevent electrical contact between
electrodes or with the cell walls.

A cell identical to the one which is to be installed
in the hot cell was used in the laboratory to carry
out measurements on a sample of simulated MSRE
fuel. It was shown that the U(III) in the molten salt
was stable in the system and that a 5-min exposure
of the surface of the solid salt to the atmosphere
did not change the U(III) concentration upon re-
melting.

The electrochemical cell is being installed in the
hot cell, and it is planned to make measurements on
a sample of radioactive MSRE salt.

H. W. Jenkins® D. L. Manning

When the MSRE fuel is in a reducing condition,
the U(IV)/U(IIl) couple determines the redox condi-
tion of the salt. The measurement of the
U(IV)/U(III) ratio is therefore essential to a funda-
mental understanding of fuel chemistry.

Potentiometric determination of this ratio requires
the value of the standard electrode potential of the
U(IV)/U(IIT) couple relative to the standard elec-
trode potential of a reference couple. The standard
potential of the U(IV)/U(III) couple was calculated
with respect to a hypothetical unit mole fraction
Ni/NiII) electrode (arbitrarily set at 0.0 v) from
emf measurements on the galvanic cell PtjU(IV),
U(I)|INKII)[Ni. The cell consisted of an Ni/Ni(II)
reference electrode contained in a boron nitride
compartment and a platinum wire immersed in a
melt containing U(III) and U(IV). The cell potential
was measured as a function of the U(IV)/U(IH)
ratio, which was varied by the controlled reduction
of W(IV) to U(IH) with a zirconium rod immersed
in the solution. Measured cell potentials were cor-
rected, using the Nernst equation, to values vs a unit
mole fraction Ni/NKII) electrode. The corrected po-
tentials were plotted vs log [U(IV)/U(III)]; the slope
of a line through these points agreed well with the
theoretical slope predicted by the Nernst equation.
The standard potential of the U(IV)/U(III) couple,
corresponding to a U(IV)/U(III) ratio of 1 was
found to be 1.48 + 0.01 v at 500°C.

Simultaneous with the emf and voltammetric meas-

withdrawn for a spectrophotometric determination of
both U(IV) and U(III) directly in the fused salt. The
samples were contained in graphite windowless cells.

14.4 EMF MEASUREMENTS
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDES

H. W. Jenkins® D. L. Manning
Gleb Mamantov®

The nickel/nickel(IT) couple, contained in a boron
nitride compartment, was demonstrated to be a use-
ful - reference electrode for emf measurements in
molten fluorides.® Utilizing the nickel/nickel(Il) ref-
erence, the program of emf measurements was con-
tinued on galvanic cells of the type NilNiF,|IM®* M
and Ni|NiF, |I[M"t|M™*[Pt, and the standard elec-
trode potentials evaluated so far are shown in Table
14.3. It is believed that the agreement between the
measured values and those calculated by Baes is
quite good, even though the solvents were not the
same. The standard electrode potentials for Fe(II)/Fe
and Fe(III)/Fe(Il) relative to nickel were evaluated
in both LiF-BeF,-ZrFy and LiF-NaF-KF (FLINAK).
FLINAK, having a higher concentration of free fluo-
ride ions than LiF-BeF,-ZrF,, did not appreciably
change the value of the Fe(Il)/Fe couple; however,
the Fe(IlI)/Fe(Il) standard potential exhibited a

cathodic shift of 366 mv. It is believed that this is
attributable, in part, to a greater complexing affinity
of fluoride ions toward Fe(IIl) than Fe(II).

The wetting of the boron nitride reference elec-
trode compartment by the two melts was observed
to be quite different. FLINAK wets the boron ni-
tride quite rapidly; the resistance is lowered to
<1000 ohms in 24 to 48 hr at 500°C; in LiF-BeF,-
ZiF4, 10 to 14 days are required to lower the
resistance to about 10 kilo-ohms at 500°C. The
difference in wetting ability of the two solvents

- appears to depend on the free oxide content of the

melts. In support of this it was observed that LiF-
BeF, wets the boron nitride at about the same rate
as FLINAK. The LiF-BeF, differs from LiF-BeF,-
ZiF4 by the 5 mole % ZrF4 which is added to
precipitate free oxide as insoluble ZrO,. An alter-
nate explanation is that wetting is a function of the
free fluoride concentration and is delayed in melts
containing negative free fluoride,.

of the determination of U(III)/U(IV) mixtures in

lent correlation of analytical results for this ratio by
two independent methods, directly in the melt, pro-
vide a very firm basis on which to proceed in the
development of both methods for use with reactor
fuels. The method of sampling for spectral measure-
ments closely parallels the procedure to be used in
the transfer of a sample of MSR fuel from the
reactor to the optics furnace.® The main differences
result from the nonradioactive nature of the present
case and the fact that the sample was caught and

removed directly in a windowless cell, In the MSR
procedure, 5 g of sample will be removed from the
reactor and dispensed, without exposure to the
atmosphere, into several windowless cells for spectral
determination. Path-length determination of liquids
confined in windowless cells is generally difficult.
With the captive liquid cells we use, the path length
of molten fluoride salts contained therein will be
approximately 0.7 cm (£10%). One point that be-
came obvious in the electrochemical-spectrochemical
study was that the intensity of the U(IV) absorption
peaks could be used as an internal standard to check
the path lengths of the melts held in the cell. This
improves the accuracy of the U(III) measurement. In
the MSR samples the total uranium concentration
will be known from other analyses, so the path
length of MSR melts in windowless containers can
be calculated from this knowledge and the intensity
of the U(IV) absorption peaks in the sample. If the

 

 

 

 

 

 

concentration of U(III) happens to be large, correc-
tions of the U(IV) concentrations will be necessary,
of course, and can be applied.

parent over this range of wavelengths. At least one
example of each 3d” configuration, except 3d°, has
been observed. Except for Fe(II), NiII), C(II), and
Cr(1l), which were described earlier,'® the figure is
comprised of data that have been coliected this
period. Molar absorptivities are not known accurately
yet but in all cases appear to be less than ~20.
From the weak intensity of the spectra, coupled
with the position of the spectral peaks, it is reason-
able to assume that these solute ions are situated in
high symmetry, possibly Oy, in these melts. Excep-
tions to this generality are TKIII) and Fe(Il), which
may be distorted for O symmetry by Jahn-Teller
effects. Although many of these ionic species are
not of direct importance to MSR melts, it is desired
to obtain such related spectral data for several rea-
sons:

1. Such data provide a broader basis on which to
generalize about the nature of solute species in
fluoride melts.

2. They provide background information to apply to
new areas of interest and applications as they
OCCUT.

3. They demonstrated that the techniques, appara-
tus, and methods of preparation are adequate to
handle and maintain unusual or reactive oxidation
states of certain elements. For example, Ti(III)
was made from Ti® + TIV); V() was prepared
in the melt by reacting V° with Fe(III).

The study of the effect of solvent composition on
the coordination and spectrum of solute species in
fluoride melts is also continuing.’ The spectrum of
Co(Il) is not altered, even in an Li, BeF, melt that
is made BeF,-rich to LiF-BeF, (6040 mole %).
Considering stabilization energies for octahedra! co-
ordination, it would be expected that the coordina-
tion of Co(II) could most readily be changed from
octahedral to tetrahedral® as the solvent composition
is altered. Further studies of coordination behavior
are under way.

J. P, Young K. A. Romberger
' J. Braunstein '

Because of the practical implications arising from |

changes in the wetting behavior of molten fluoride
salts, particularly LiF-BeF;-base salts, it is of value
to describe our experimental observations of these

phenomena. These observations were generally made

- peripherally after some other experiment. Wetting

and nonwetting behavior is summarized in Table
14.4. Most of these observations were made on
cooled samples that had been prepared for window-
less-cell spectroscopy. It is assumed that no gross
change in contact angle occurred on freezing, and, in
fact, those solutions which appear wetting as solids
were more prone to run out of windowless cells
when molten. Evidence to support this comes from
visual observations made during filtrations of molten
LiF-BeF, through sintered-nickel frits. In these ex-
periments an LiF-BeF, melt which was in contact
with a hydrogen atmosphere and beryllium metal
completely wet a sintered-nickel frit during filtration,
while a similar melt in the presence of hydrogen but
in the absence of beryllium remained completely
nonwetting to the frit during filtration. The typical
appearance of a wetting and nonwetting layer of
LiF-BeF, on a nickel frit is shown in Fig. 14.7.

The mechanism for this wetting action is un-
known, but certain generalizations can be made.
From Table 14.4 it can be noted that all containers
are electrical conductors. In all cases when very
active metals are in contact with melts containing
one or several of their. dissolved solute species, wet-
ting occurs. Nickel was not wet by melts that con-
tained dissolved Ni(II); nickel is a relatively noble

‘metal. It is interesting to note that U(IV)/U(IID)
 mixtures which contain no U® do not wet, while

melts containing only Sm(II}) do wet. This may
imply that, under the experimental conditions of the
test, U(III) did not disproportionate to U® where
Sm(IT) did disproportionate to yield Sm°. In the
Nd(III)-Nd® case, no evidence of Nd(II) was seen
spectrally, but wetting occurred. LiF-BeF, which
contained added, and relatively insoluble, oxides did
not wet. This is perhaps in line with the generally
observed fact that molten LiF-BeF; does not ini-
tially wet SiO, containers. In- Table 14.4, salts and
metals in parenthesis indicate that these states were

present as a result of the container material or as a

result of chemical reaction. In the latter case spec-
tral proof of this species was obtained. Further
studies are planned to investigate the electrochemical

‘and chemical causes for this behavior,

dense comrosive liquid and a white solid. Both of
these materials are deposited, at least in part, at
~points remote from the pump bowl and could intro-
duce maintenance problems when NaBF, is used as
an MSR coolant salt. The white deposit was found
to consist of agglomerated particles of an NaBF,
aerosol, which can be removed by mechanical means,
so the analytical effort is being concentrated on the
liquid deposits.

The liquid deposits were originally thought to be
associated with pump oil, but their almost complete
solubility in water indicates that they are inorganic.
Initial samples were dark brown, but one sample was
transparent with a greenish-brown tinge. The material
appears to be volatile, since in at least one case a
deposit was observed to dry up during later opera-
tions of the loop. Collection rates decreased during
the loop operations. The total quantity collected was
not precisely measured but was estimated to cor-
respond to a few hundred parts per million of con-
taminant in the salt charged to the loop.!!

A. A. Palko'? suggested the material was an equi-
librium mixture of hydroxyfluoroboric acids, which
are almost always formed from the reaction of BF,
with traces of adsorbed moisture when BF; is first
introduced into a metal system. It was not possible
to confirm this analytically because the samples were
not available in a weighable form. The samples were
collected in a 1-ft section of l-in. borosilicate glass
pipe fitted with brass end plates and packed with
stainless steel mesh. The composition of the original
samples was probably altered through loss of BF,
on attempted transfer. In subsequent samples a vis-
ual estimate of the quantity of liquid was made, and
the fitting on the end of the trap was then opened
‘under water, Copious fuming was observed, with the
formation of an evanescent white scum (presumably
boric ac1d) on the surface of the water. After the
initial reaction had subsided, the trap was washed
with water to yield a turbid solution. The combined

solution was analyzed to determine the total quan- '

tity of soluble material present.
Some generalizations can be made for the Tliquid

s samples analyzed. The predominant components are

fluorine and boron, present in a ratio slightly in
excess of 3 to 1 after corrections are made for

nating. Varying quantities of silicon and sodium are
present, along with traces of copper. Some plating
of copper on the stamless steel packing was also
observed.

The analyses are consistent with a liquid of aver-
age composition of BF3;-H,0 which at room tem-
perature contains a complex equilibrium mixture of
fluoroboric and hydroxyfluoroboric acids.!® L. O.
Gilpatrick has found that the oxygen in NaBF, is
not completely removed by the heating and evacua-
tion treatment used to prepare the loop’s charge.
Approximately 200 ppm remain, probably as
NaBF;0H or its hydrate. He has found that this
oxide is removed by sparging with BF;.

Since the liquid is no longer being collected in the
off-gas system, it will not be possible to characterize
it unambiguously. In view of the above information
we plan to assume that it consists of BF,; hydrates,
to generate such hydrates within a laboratory sys-
tem, and to study their transfer and develop meth-
ods for removing them from off-gas streams. A gas
train consisting of fluorothene traps connected by
Teflon tubing has been assembled to perform these
tests. The first trap was charged with water and
sparged with an equimolar mixture of BF; and
helium. When no further increase in the volume of

the solution was noted and BF; passed freely

through the system, the delivery tube was withdrawn
to a point just above the solution, and the effluent

gas was passed through two traps cooled in an ace-

tone—dry-ice bath. This ‘temperature is not sufficient
to condense BF;. Liquid was observed to be trans-
ferred at a significant rate. After 40 hr sparging at
100 cc/min, approximately 0.5 cc was collected. The
trapping was obviously of low efficiency, since com-
parable quantities were collected in both of the

- traps. The traps have now been packed with Teflon-

6, and the experiment will be repeated to try to
obtain - valid transfer rates. When a reliable rate has
been established, various adsorbents will be inter-
posed between the source and collection traps. We

‘plan first to test molecular sieves because of their

high capacity and convenience in handling. A large-
pore (13X) sieve will be tested as a total adsorbent
of the hydrate. Also a 3A sieve will be evaluated to
determine if these compounds can be dehydrated.

14.9 DETERMINATION OF BISMUTH
IN MSRP SALTS

W. R. Laing P. F. Thomason
C. Feldman G. Goldberg
T. H. Handley

The use of the liquid-metal extraction system pro-
posed for the reprocessing of molten-salt breeder
reactor fuel will generate return streams to the reac-
tor that may be contaminated with bismuth. During

the lifetime of a power reactor, trace concentrations

will represent a cumulative transfer of substantial
quantities of bismuth. More sensitive methods are
needed to determine the concentration of bismuth
that is introduced to MSRP salts during extraction
steps and to evaluate the efficiency of methods for
stripping bismuth from salts, A number of groups
have carried out development studies by diverse
methods. Only a brief summary of this work will be
presented at this time; a more detailed report will
be made when optimum methods have been selected.

14.9.1 Polarography

The first salt samples were analyzed by derivative
polarographic measurements in perchloric acid media.
For LiF-BeF, and LiF-BeF,-ZrF, samples, detection
limits are approximately 20 ppm. Because the ura-
nium and bismuth waves are too close (~0.1 v) for
. complete resolution, a positive bias is encountered in
the analysis of uranium-bearing fuels. The method is
not considered to give accurate results for typical
fuel compositions containing less than about 100
ppm bismuth. It has been discontinued in favor of
the spectrophotometric method described below.

14.9.2 Spectrophotometry

Both potassium iodide and thiourea give selective
color reactions of approximately equal sensitivity.
The iodide reagent is favored because the solid rea-
gent can be added with little dilution of the sample
solutions. By the use of 5-cm optical paths, measure-
ments can be extended to the 10-ppm range for 1-g

samples. No interference results from the usual con-
~ centrations of corrosion products; up to 200 pg of
iron and copper can be tolerated. Uranium inter-
ference begins at about the 5-mg level but can be
eliminated by the use of a sample blank. This is the
method now used for routine analysis. Recent sam-
ples have contained undetectable quantities of bis-
muth. |

208

14.9.3 Emission Spectrography

The detection limits for bismuth in a dc arc are
approximately 30 ng, but it is possible to introduce
only a few milligrams of the salt to an arc, and the
measurement is subject to interference from the
complex spectra of uranium and thorium. Prelimi-
‘nary experiments using tracer techniques have dem-
onstrated that it is possible to quantitatively separate
the bismuth from the major sample constituents by
extracting sulfuric acid solutions with dithizone in
chloroform. The extract can then be evaporated
onto a graphite electrode so that the bismuth from
a substantial sample of salt can be arced. The limits
and. precision of the method have not yet been
established, but on the basis of past experience with

~similar techniques, measurements at the 1-ppm level
appear practical.

14.9.4 Polarographic Stripping

The sensitivity of the polarographic determination
of metallic ions can be increased by plating the
metal onto an electrode for an extended period and
measuring the stripping current generated during an
anodic scan. In the technique now being tested,
bismuth is plated onto a small (~0.5 mm) suspended
drop of mercury. A small drop is used to minimize
diffusion periods within the electrode, so that sharp
stripping current peaks are obtained. The principal
problem in the application of this technique to
MSRP samples is that the stripping waves of copper
and bismuth almost coincide. In addition to that in
the salt samples, traces of copper are present in
most analytical reagents. Attempts to separate these
waves by complexing have been unsuccessful, and we
are now attempting to plate the bismuth selectively.
Thiocyanate strongly complexes copper so that its
reduction wave becomes cathodic to bismuth, and it
appears feasible to separate the bismuth by plating it
at a potential intermediate to that of the bismuth
and copper waves. Optimum conditions for the de-
termination are now being established. With a 5-min
plating period followed by stripping at 1 v/min,
detection limits are estimated at 0.1 ppm. |

14.9.5 Isotopic Exchange

Isotopic exchange methods are based on the equili-
bration of a solution of the element with an essen-
tially immiscible phase that contains in fixed concen-
tration a comparable quantity of a radioisotope of
the element. When exchange is complete the radio-
 

isotope will be distributed in proportion to the
quantity of the elements in the two phases, and the
original concentration can be computed from a
measurement of the distribution- coefficient by
counting. Practical analytical application of this prin-
ciple can be made through the liquid-liquid extrac-
tion of metal ion complexes. This technique has
been applied to the determination of ppm concentra-
tions of mercury with a precision of about 1%.!*
For simplest applications the extraction system must
rigorously fulfill certain criteria. (1) The complex
must be essentially undissociated and strongly dis-
tributed to the donor phase; that is, the radioisotope
complex must be quantitatively extracted in the
absence of excess ligand. (2) Any constituents of the
sample that form complexes of comparable or

greater strength must be removed before the equili-
bration.

A two-step procedure for bismuth appears to fulfill
the above criteria. The bismuth is first extracted
from ammoniacal cyanide solution into a chloroform
solution of dithizone. Only Pb**, TI*, and Sn** ac-
company the bismuth. The organic phase is then
equilibrated with an aqueous solution of 2°7Bi-
EDTA complex. Bismuth forms a much stronger
EDTA complex than any of the three accompanying
ions. The method has the disadvantage of rather
slow exchange. Approximately 20 min are required
for equilibration. It has not yet been possible to
determine the ultimate sensitivity of the method
because the radioactive bismuth available is con-
taminated with normal bismuth. A new preparation
(by bombardment of a purified lead target) will be

~ needed to evaluate the method at the ppm level.

Part 5. Materials Development

Our materials program has emphasized four main
‘problem areas during this reporting period: (1) irradia-
tion damage to graphite, (2) sealing graphite to obtain a

low permeability to fission gases, (3) irradiation embrit-

tlement of Hastelloy N, and (4) the compatibility of
Hastelloy N with our proposed coolant salt, sodium
fluoroborate. :
Several graphites were obtained from commercial
.vendors, and some were fabricated in local facilities for
study in our irradiation damage program. Some of these
‘materials have been irradiated to a fast fluence of 2.5 X
1022 neutrons/cm® (>50 kev). Experimental tech-
- niques are being developed so that we can use transmis-
sion electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and physi-
cal property measurements to characterize these ma-
terials before and after irradiation.

work to date has been with optimizing process param-
eters, but some samples have been irradiated.

- Hastelloy N is embrittled in a thermal-neutron envi-
ronment by helium produced by the '°B(nma)’Li
transmutation. This embrittlement can be reduced by
alloying with titanium, but good postirradiation proper-
ties result only when the irradiation temperature does
not exceed 660°C. This temperature sensitivity has
been related to the instability of the MC-type carbide,
and further alloying additions to stabilize the desired
carbide are being sought.

Our proposed coolant, sodium fluoroborate, seems to
corrode Hastelloy N more than salts containing lithium
and beryllium fluorides. Our results indicate that the
corrosion rate in the sodium fluoroborate is sensitive to
the water content. Several thermal convection loops
and one forced convection loop are being used to study
this problem.

Examination. of three MSRE pump bowl magnets
FP-15-53, FP-15-67, and FP-16-2, revealed magnetic
particles clinging to the magnets and cladding material.
In some instances these particles resembled whiskers,

but in most cases, closer optical examination showed

them to be finely divided metallic particles. We utilized
gamma scanning, electron microprobe, x-ray diffrac-
tion, spectrochemical analysis, and metallography to
identify the particles. The results are summarized in
Tables 16.1 to 16.3.

To obtain the sample from the magnet in the hot
cells, a camel’s-hair brush was used to remove the
particles into a receptacle. In this brushing operation a
small amount of the hair from the brush was unavoid-
ably mixed with the sample. Removal of the hair was
extremely difficult, so the hair was weighed as sample
material also, In the spectrographic analysis, this por-
tion of the sample went undetected as carbon along
with the fluorine from the MSRE salts. Since the
sample weight was in the milligram range, the weight
contribution of the hair was considerable. Consequently
the spectrographic results were inordinately low. How-
ever, by calculating the fluorine salt contribution that is
known to accompany the sample and normalizing the

obtained (Table 16.2).

16.1.1 Observations on Particles from Magnet FP-15-53

Four ‘particles from FP-15-53 were mounted and
examined with the electron microprobe. One particle
was >95% Ni, and neither Mo nor Cr was detected. Two
other particles examined by microprobe analysis were
Fe with about 18% Cr and 8% Ni, similar to many
austenitic stainless steels. These particles appeared
metallographically to be primarily single phase. At-
tempted etching with 2% Nital (iron etchant) did not
alter the polished surface, but the structure shown in
the insert of Fig. 16.1 resulted from a glyceregia etch,
indicating either a very small grain size or severe
deformation. Both particles were magnetic, indicating
either bee iron or heavily cold-worked austenitic stain-
less steel. One particle was removed from the mount
and is shown in Fig. 16.1. Debye-Scherrer x-ray
patterns revealed that the particle was austenitic,
indicating that both were probably stainless steel
shavings picked up during removal of “real” MSRE
particles from the magnet.

Another particle was primarily aluminum. Metallo-
graphic study revealed a typical cast eutectic structure
with at least two phases in the matrix. Besides Al, one
phase contained Si, Cu, and Zn, and the other Fe, Si,
and Cu. The matrix contained very small amounts of Cu
and Zn, This particle had a very low level of activity,
and gamma spectroscopy was employed to determine
the nuclides responsible for the limited activity. Long
counting times were used, and only *SNb, 1°3Ru, and
106Ru were detected. The nuclides present in highest
concentrations in the MSRE salt were not detected,
presenting some doubt that the particle was removed

- from the pump bowl, particularly since the particle was

A batch of particles from FP-16-2 was mounted for
microprobe and metallographic study. These particles
were much smaller than the stainless steel shavings,
ranging from 30 to <1 u in size. Nearly 50 to 60
particles were .apparent, and microprobe x-ray displays
indicated that the majority were primarily Fe and
several were primarily Ni; Mo and Cr were detected in
some very small particles. Semiquantitative analyses
were performed on several particles, with the results
shown in Table 16.3. Generally the particles were

relatively pure Fe, primarily Ni with some Fe, or

mixtures of Fe and Cr with some Ni. Small amounts of
* Mo were present in two particles. Metallographic studies
‘revealed that the iron particles had similar structures

17. Graphite Studies

17.1 FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF RADIATION
DAMAGE MECHANISMS IN GRAPHITE

D.K.Holmes J.C.Crump -
S. M. Ohr T. S. Noggle
W. E. Atkinson

An effort is being made to contribute to improvement
of the characteristics of reactor graphite under condi-
tions of long-exposure, high-temperature irradiation by
trying to understand the basic nature of radiation
damage in graphite. The years of research effort put
into this problem by various groups in the past have not
produced any acceptable quantitative- model of the
accumulation of damage in graphite even under the
most ideal conditions. Therefore, in an attempt to
establish a clear understanding of the basic processes, it
has been considered worth while to take a new look at
damage in natural single crystals of graph1te and in good
pyrolytic material.

The justification for undertaking such a program in
the face of the obvious difficulties shown by the lack of
progress in the past lies in the hope of using a better
experimental approach and in a closely correlated effort
between theory and experiment in a group whose past
interests have "been in the basic nature of radiation
‘damage.

The experimental idea is to use fast electrons or
charged particles to produce the damage in simulation
of fast-neutron irradiations. In its optimum form the
idea is to irradiate graphite specimens in the 200-kev
Hitachi electron microscope with the electron beam of
the instrument (which is energetic enough to displace
carbon atoms from their lattice positions) and to
examine them in situ. This would allow for very
accurate control of dose rate and total dose along with
fair control of the specimen temperature. It is known
from previous work of other groups that the damage in
graphite is easily observable in the electron microscope
in the form of large dislocation loops and defect
clusters, the former arising from the clustering of
interstitial carbon atoms between the layer planes. A
careful study of the formation, growth, and annealing

214

of these clusters should lead to an understanding of the
reason why so much damage persists in this form rather
than suffering annihilation.

The experimental work is as yet only in a preliminary
stage. Some single crystals (provided by G. Hinman of
Gulf General Atomic) and some pyrolytic material have
been irradiated in the microscope. Observable damage
has been produced in the form of defect clusters. For
example, in a sample of pyrolytic material exposed to a
total of 1022 200-kev electrons per square centimeter
at 550°C there were observed clusters having average
radii of about 50 A with a density of about 10'¢
clusters per cubic centimeter. In a general way these
results are consistent with those obtained by previous
investigators using fast neutrons at a roughly equivalent
total dose. However, no detailed comparison can be
made until many more irradiations have been made
under varying conditions. The exact nature of the
clusters obtained to date has not been clarified; further
study in the electron microscope is needed to determine
if the defects being observed are indeed interstitial
loops and, if they are not, whether interstitial loops are
also present.

The intent of the theoretical program is to attempt to
understand the experimental results by a closely corre-
lated study of kinetic equations covering the produc-
tion, diffusion, annihilation, and clustering of defects.
With such a set of equations, various hypotheses can be
introduced and tested by comparing the results with the
equivalent experimental data. As the initial effort it has
been decided to study Mayer’s theory, which says that
substitutional boron atoms play a vital role in the
damage process. The suggestion is that wandering
interstitial carbon atoms are trapped near such boron
sites and are thus effectively slowed down in their rate
of diffusion through the lattice. Further, as the inter-
stitial rests at its trapping position, it is very likely to be
joined by a second interstitial which will thus nucleate a
stable cluster. Mayer’s experimental results indicate that
such boron trapping sites are the dominant feature of
radiation damage in graphite even down at concentra-
tions as low as 10~7 atomic fraction of boron.
 

 

 

 

-

A set of coupled kinetic equations has been pro-
grammed for the IBM 360 model 75 computer. These
equations determine the time variation of the densities
of interstitials, vacancies, interstitials trapped at boron
atoms, clusters of interstitials at boron atoms, and
clusters of interstitials homogeneously nucleated. Such
equations present considerable difficulty toward obtain-
ing acceptable accuracy and stability. Most of the
research effort to date has been expended in adapting a
Gauss-Seidel integration scheme to this particular set of
equations in order to integrate with enough efficiency
to permit the achievement of the desired total damage
level. Mayer himself has not integrated such equations,
although he discussed them and deduced what their
asymptotic solutions should be. Our very preliminary
results tend to confirm the general form of his solution.

17.2 GRAPHITIZATION CHEMISTRY AND
BINDER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT?

R. A. Strehlow

Increase of the microstructural strength and density
of graphite for MSBR use should improve both gas
permeability characteristics and irradiation lifetime.
The chemical studies program on carbonization and
binder system development is concerned with chemical
factors which influence the structural properties of a
fabricated graphite. This concern stems principally from

two facts: The first is that weight and volume yields of

carbon are strong functions of the chemical structure of

-starting material as well as of carbonizing conditions.

The second is that carbon precursor mixtures can yield
coke mixtures with significant variability in micro-
structure and graphitizability.

Economic and technical factors operate together to

~place coal tar pitch in an eminent position among

binder systems for nuclear graphite. However, measured
volumetric yields of coal tar pitch were found to range
from 20% for the softer grades to only about 40% for
the highest-softening-point materials (grade 350). Since
some carbon precursor compounds offer volumetric
yields of more easily graphitized carbon near 60%,
marked improvements in strength and fabricated den-
sity are possible. For improvements of this magnitude,
overall process costs competitive with those of the coal
tar materials may be realized. - -

 

! These comment-s' are based on work perfofmed in the
Chemistry Development Department of the Development Divi-
sion, Y-12 Plant.

Of course, volumetric yield is but one of several
essential qualities of a carbon-binder system. Appropri-
ate fluidity, carbonization kinetics, and product carbon
structure are all required for the optimal application of
a binder system. Appropriate flow properties may be
achieved by construction of polycomponent mixtures -
or by proper use and selection of fugitive material. It is
not now known whether a reasonably small number of
components will yield a suitable liquid. Studies have
been begun of phase relations among carbon precursor
materials such as acenaphthylene and isotruxene. How-
ever, knowledge of the kinetics of crystallization
processes for mixtures is also needed for further
development of synthetic binder systems and for
altered or modified pitches. :

- Carbonization reactions proceed with rates and tem-
perature coefficients of rate which vary with the
structure of the pyrolyzing species. Mixed coke types
can be generated from mixtures of compounds such as
biphenyl and anthracene.? Since it may be safely
presumed that a segregated development of coke types
within a carbon body during baking will lead to
structural weakness and impaired crystallinity in the
product, a study of microstructural development is a
necessary accompaniment to the carbonization studies.
Model compounds with sufficiently low vapor pressure
to prevent facile evaporation generally have a complex
structure which may follow more than one route in the

- carbonization. Since this is so, either high-pressure

coking or great restriction in selection of compounds
must be employed. Fortunately, there are a few
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as decacyclene,
CisH;s, which are at once symmetric and of high
molecular weight so that studies can be made on their
carbonization. Work of this type is continuing.

The inference should be drawn from the above
discussion that binder system development can proceed
from two complementary bases. The first is the use of
model compounds primarily to define the carbonization
process — rates, catalysis, product quality, and its
alteration. The second is to determine the basic phase
data  needed to construct a useful improved binder
system using either precursor mixtures or modifications
of coal tar or petroleum pitches.

17.3 HOT PRESSING OF GRAPHITE PELLETS
USING VARIOUS BINDERS?

L. G. Overholser

Graphite pellets were prepared for machining and
subsequent irradiation testing in HFIR by hot pressing
AXM graphite flour* and various binder materials.
Variables examined include the type and quantity of
binder as well as pressing temperatures and pressures.

AXM graphite flour (—200 mesh), purified by HCI
treatment at ~2200°C, was used as filler in all runs.
Isotruxene (ITX), acenaphthylene (ACN), decacyclene,
and Allied Chemical Company grade 350 coal tar pitch
- were used as binders. The binders were crushed, where
necessary, sieved, and the —70 mesh fraction used in
hot pressing. The flour-binder mixture was prepared by
superficially dry blending the powders, slurrying with
acetone, and evaporating the acetone to yield a dry
powder. The graphite sleeve and die used in hot pressing
gave a pellet having a nominal diameter of 3 in. Pellets
hot pressed at 1400°C were heat treated later at
2800°C without pressure.

 

 

3Work performed by Chemical Engineering Department,
Development Division, Y-12 Plant.

“This flour was obtained by milling AXM graphite produced
by Poco Graphite, Inc,

Data obtained for the various graphite pellets are
given in Table 17.1. The bulk density was calculated
from the weight and geometric volume and the residual
binder carbon content from the increase in weight of
the formed graphite over the weight of contained flour.
The carbon yield or coking value represents the ratio of
weight of residual carbon obtained after pyrolysis of
the binder to the weight of binder originally present.
Pellets . prepared using ACN as binder are charac-
terized by low bulk carbon densities and low binder
carbon contents. These binders also give low carbon
yields. All pellets pressed with these binders had at least
one large radial crack. The high-melting grade 350 coal
tar pitch gives the highest bulk densities, carbon yields,
and carbon binder contents. Isotruxene and de-
cacyclene give bulk densities, binder carbon contents,
and carbon yields intermediate between the 350 pitch
and the ACN binder.

The density of parts cut from one of the pellets

“prepared with ITX as binder increased from 1.63 to

1.80 g/cm® when given a single impregnation with ITX.
This technique makes it feasible to prepare graphites of
higher density than obtainable by merely varying the
conditions of pressing but still using a single binder
material. In addition to the variation of densities found
for the various binders, the carbons formed by pyrolysis
of these binders differ in graphitizability. For example,

ITX and 350 pitch yield carbons which are more
difficult to graphitize than the carbons obtained from
ACN and decacyclene.

The original AXM graphite is known to be remarkably
stable under irradiation (cf. Sect. 17.9). Hence the flour
used in the above samples should also be stable. Since
the microstructures of the above binders differ signifi-
caritly, the irradiation of these materials should clearly
delineate the role of the binder in controlling dimen-
sional changes of graphites under irradiation.

17.4 PROCUREMENT AND PHYSICAL PROPERTY
MEASUREMENTS ON NEW GRADES
OF GRAPHITE

W. H. Cook

The first trial fabrications of new grades of graphite
have been received and are in the early stages of
examination. The objectives are (1) to develop the most

 radiation-stable and fabricable grades of graphite for

MSBR applications and (2) to determine the funda-
mental factors that make one grade of graphite resist
radiation damage more than others. In many instances,

“the data from the research toward these objectives are

mutually beneficial; however, the research associated
with the first is on a more pressing time schedule.

The development programs are of the mutual interest
and effort of the Chemical Engineering Development

Department (CEDD) of the Y-12 Plant and ORNL. All

To develop the most stable and fabricable material, the
work is concentrated on the most radiation-resistant ma-
terials currently known, the Poco graphites. These ma-
terials are not currently being fabricated in large enough
sizes for the present MSBE and MSBR designs; so work
has been initiated in CEDD to make shapes by the classi-

- cal extrusion techniques with these and other materials
. as fillers. Grades Y586 and Y588 shown in Table 17.2

are typical. They are bonded with polymerized furfury!
alcohol, Varcum,® which produces a poor-quality,
turbostratic graphite for the binder phase. Grade AXF
bodies were crushed and sized by the CEDD to supply
one filler, and the other, grade 2033, was supplied by
the manufacturer already crushed and sized. Little is

known about grade 2033 material. Grade AXF has a
bulk density ranging from 1.80 to 1.88 g/cm® and a
typical gas permeability to helium of 4.0 X 1072
cm?/sec. As shown in Table 17.2, the grade AXF
“reconstituted” as grade Y586 did not sacrifice these
starting properties. In fact, the gas permeability was
improved (i.e., decreased) by a surprising amount to
3.1 X 10™ cm?/sec. Additional properties are. being
measured, and their irradiation stabilities to fast neu-
trons will be determined in the HFIR. Should the
overall properties of the starting materials not be de-
graded too much by this process and in the scaleup to
MSBR sizes, this well-established technology for fabric-
ation would be suitable for fabricating the shapes
required for MSBR’s.

The rest of the grades of graphite listed in Table 17.2
are being studied for more special and fundamental
purposes. Historically, graphite has been made from
natural materials and/or their by-products. Thousands
of complex hydrocarbon compounds may be involved
in these natural materials, and they are usually typical
of their particular source. This presents such problems
as (1) maintaining the quantity and quality limits of
starting materials required for a product when a certain
natural source is depleted and (2) sorting out the
complex compounds that may contribute to resitance
to radiation damage. One approach that may be helpful
toward solving both of these problems is to synthesize
part or all of the starting components. Grades YMI-3,
YMI4I, and YMI-13 represent initial work in this
direction. Preliminary data suggest that radiation dam-
age may be decreased if the binder component is equal
to or greater in quality to the filler material so that in
effect they are indistinguishable from each other, that
is, the finished product behaves as if it were a
monolithic material. A secondary but desirable goal is
to find binders and impregnants that produce higher
carbon yields during pyrolysis. This would decrease
both the initial porosity in the base stock and the
number of impregnations required to reduce porosity
and pore entrance diameters in the base stock. An
attempt to do this has been to synthesize the starting
materials, the isotruxene [C4H;3(C¢Hs)a] binder and
impregnant in these studies. The molding technique is
used to conserve the limited quantities of the synthe-
sized isotruxene.

Poco grade AXM was used as the filler in these
experimental grades because of low cost and avail-
ability. It differs from grade AXF in that its bulk
density is lower (1.70 to 1.79 g/cm®). The relatively
high resistance to radiation damage of the filler should
help emphasize the effects of irradiation on the
isotruxene binder and impregnant. Grade YMI-3 is a

body bonded with isotruxene, and YMI4I is both
bonded and then impregnated with isotruxene.

The common commercial coal tar pitch- binders
usually used in the fabrication of graphites have a
carbon yield of approximately 55% (ref. 7). The carbon
yield for isotruxene is around 67%, an appreciable
increase over that of the coal tar pitch binders.
However, the overall results are somewhat disappoint-
ing. The bulk density of the YMI-3 is lower than that of
the filler material, and that for YMI-13 is not usually
high for the forming technique used. The density of
YMI-4I was increased substantially by the single impreg-
nation with isotruxene, but the gas permeability, was
not altered much when compared with that of YMI-3 in
Table 17.2.

The YM350 series in Table 17.2 brings us back to
more complex binders. However, the 350 pitch used for
these is a relatively hard binder that has a good carbon
yield of approximately 72%. Again, the bulk densities
and gas permeabilities are not outstanding for these first
trials. '

The specific resistances reported for grades Y586 and
Y588 in Table 17.2 are slightly high, as one might
expect with furfuryl alcohol binder and the particle size
of the filler used. The specific resistances for all the
YMI and YM350 series are very high. In a qualitative
way, the high resistance suggests that the particles are
covered well by the binders, as they should be, and that
the binders are not producing good graphitic structures.

It is important when considering the properties of the
grades listed in Table 17.2 to recall that these are all the
first products produced by these new approaches. The
full potential of these materials cannot be assessed until
the fabrication parameters are further developed. Other
synthesized binders will be introduced as these studies
progress. We shall continue to make relatively com-
prehensive property measurements on these and other

grades of these series in order to (1) assist in developing .

desirable fabrication techniques and (2) to determine
the potentials of these new materials. :

of graphites and the influence of temperature, anisot-
ropy, and irradiation. |
A comparative longitudinal-heat-flow apparatus® was
used to measure the thermal conductivity (A) of three
types of graphite from 300 to 475°K in the directions
perpendicular and parallel to the pressing direction.
Some of the properties of these graphites were reported
previously.” Our measurements of the thermal conduc-
tivity and the room-temperature electrical resistivity (p)
are given in Table 17.3. The thermal conductivity values
have a probable accuracy of +3%. The electrical
resistivity results are 25 to 50 microhm-cm lower than
those reported previously. This difference is in the
correct direction to be caused by a geometric effect of
isopotentials at the current leads of short samples. The

~ thermal conductivity of these graphites decreases with

increasing temperature and indicates from 5 to 30%
anisotropy. This temperature dependence agrees with
our previous findings on CGB graphite, which showed
an inverse relation between thermal conductivity and
the absolute temperature.!® This indicates three
phonon scattering processes are acting, and this scatter-
ing limits lattice heat conduction insulators above their
Debye temperature. Our previous findings show this
relation to hold below the Debye temperature of
graphite. The anisotropy ratios AL/All and pll/pl of the
various graphites agree to within 5%. In a previous
study we noted that the resistivity ratio changed less
than 8% from 300 to 1300 K.'°

Finally, thermal conductivity measurements were
obtained on one sample irradiated in the ORR to an
approximate fast fluence of 4.8 X 10'® neutrons/cm?
at 700°C; the results are given in Table 17.3. This 50%
reduction in the thermal conductivity agrees with
reported findings on the effects of irradiation. Further
tests and analysis of this are planned.

of the bulk crystalline anisotropy of the material.
Therefore, to characterize and study potential graph-
ites, we are determining by x-ray analysis the anisot-
ropy of the basal plane distribution prior to irradiation.
We have shown that there is a linear relationship
between the radiation-induced growth rates at constant
volume and the bulk anisotropy.! !

The distribution of basal planes in the graphite is
proportional to the x-ray intensity distribution dif-
fracted from those planes. From Xx-ray intensity data vs
angular position, a preferred-orientation parameter can
be calculated by the following formula defined by Price
and Bokros:'2

(1

where

¢ = angle between normals to sample surface and
basal planes,

B = angle of rotation about sample normal,
I(¢, B) = x-ray intensity at angle ¢ and .

If the material has an axis of symmetry coincident

* with the forming axis the integration through the angle

B is constant, and the above equation reduces to a single
integration in ¢. However, we have found that in many
cases the axis of symmetry is not coincident with the
forming axis, in which case it is desirable to do the

double integration. Since there are two directions in the
orthogonal system acting normal to the forming axis,
and by assuming an axis of symmetry in the parallel
direction, then

Ry =1-Ry/2. @

We are using a Schulz preferred-orientation attach-
ment mounted onto a North American Philips x-ray
diffractometer and vanadium-filtered chromium radia-
tion, The diffracted intensity data from samples whose
surface is perpendicular and parallel to the forming axis
are recorded onto a computer-compatible perforated
paper tape. Eighty data points per 360° B rotation are
averaged for each 5° increment of ¢. Substitution of
these values into ‘Eq. (1), with the § integration
approximated by the averaging, yields an R value in a
direction perpendicular to the sample surface. This
procedure can be repeated on a sample oriented
perpendicular to the one just discussed.

We have used this technique for determining the
preferred orientation parameters of 2 number of grades
of graphite, and the results are shown in Table 17.4. By
averaging the data through complete rotations in the
angle B and using samples whose surfaces are perpen-
dicular and parallel to the forming axis, we have
determined R values independently in the two direc-
tions. The validity of this approach is indicated by the
small deviation from the theoretical value of 2 for the
sum of the R values in the three orthogonal directions.
These are the R values relative to the forming axis with
no assumption about the position of the symmetry axis.

Isotropic materials will have R values in each of the
three orthogonal directions equal to 0.667. Samples

while those having R| greater than this have an

indicates the degree of anisotropy. A single crystal will
have Ry = 0 and R) = 1. Note that several of the
materials studied have R values very close to the
predicted 0.667 for complete isotropy (Table 17.4).

These anisotropy values have made it possible to
better understand the effects of binder and filler on the
radiation growth rates of various graphites (Fig. 17.14,
Sect. 17.9). The growth rates at constant volume and
the preferred orientation parameter correlate as a
straight line, indicating that, even though some have
different binders and fabrication procedures, the
growth rates are dependent mainly upon the degree of
anisotropy.

C.S.Morgan  C.S. Yust

D:rect observatxon of the substructure of polycrystal-

line graph:tes by transmission electron microscopy may
permit a better understanding of the process of radia-
tion damage in these materials. Although a substantial

amount of transmission microscopy has been done on

single-crystal graphite, the transmission work on bulk

polycrystalline graphite is quite limited, The " first

.requirement in this study was the development of a

suitable thinning technique. We found that thinning by

mechanical polishing can be used to prepare satisfactory -

specimens of AXF graphite. The application of this
technique to other graphites is being evaluated.

A variety of graphites will be examined in the
as-fabricated and the irradiated conditions to determine

the substructure change with irradiation. Fig. 17.1
shows a transmission electron micrograph of type AXF
graphite as fabricated. The structure is composed of
regions about 1 y in diameter within which exist aligned
ribbons of materials. Cracks are sometimes seen be-
tween the ribbons, as well as between regions of

 different alignment. Although numerous spots are

usually present, electron diffraction patterns of the
smallest possible selected area always yield rings, thus

_ indicating that the crystallite size is quite small. Smaller

units which go in and out of contrast with tilting agree
in size with the crystallite size determined by x-ray line
broadening (250 A). Boundary regions in the AXF

- graphite are not well defined.

17.8 GAS IMPREGNATION OF GRAPHITE
WITH CARBON

R.L.Beatty D, V.Kiplinger

We have been studying a vacuum-pressure pulsing
technique to seal graphite for MSBR use as discussed
earlier.!® The current specification on surface tightness
of the graphite is a room-temperature permeability to
helium not greater than 10™® cm?/sec. Accordingly, we
are studying means to optnmze the gas nnpregnatlon
process. __

The effect of process temperature is shown clearly in
Fig. 17.2. In this set of experiments we maintained
constant the substrate type (Poco AXF graphite) and

' the vacuum and butadiene exposure periods. The initial

slopes of high rates of weight gain shown by the curves
in Fig. 17.2 indicate the coating of a very large surface
area, namely, the walls of the entire open-pore struc-
ture. The sharp changes of slope indicate the closing of
most of the pore volume during a relatively small
increment: of processing time, thus attesting the uni-
formity of pore size of the AXF graphite substrate.

- Each specimen was sealed to a low helium permeability
~ after this sharp change in slope, and the leveled-out

section of each curve involves essentially coating of
only the specimen geometrical surface area. A compari-
son of the slopes of the latter portion of these curves
shows clearly that increasing the temperature increases
the rate of deposition. This effect is also shown by the
points at which pores are closed at the different

“temperatures. Lowering temperature results in slowmg

down the sealing process while increasing the depth of

- peénetration and, eventually, the final amount of im-

pregnant deposited. The 750°C deposition curve leveled
out at a specimen weight increase of 7.5%, essentially

all intemal deposit. Data indicate that & finite, though
often immeasurable, amount of surface coating is
reqmred to achieve a helium permeability less than
1078 cm?/sec at room temperature.

We must optimize the gas impregnation process
for a given type of substrate. Figure 17.3 shows the
effect of varying the vacuum pulse period. For the Poco
AXF substrate, a sealing temperature of 850°C, and a
butadiene pulse of % sec, we found that shortening the
vacuum pulse from 60 to 15 sec served to increase the
rate and depth of impregnation as well as to accelerate
the process. In this case further accelerating the sealing
by shortening the vacuum pulse to 7.5 sec resulted in
some sacrifice in penetration.

The effect of substrate pore structure on deposition
and sealing rates is shown in Fig. 17.4. The fine-pore
AXF graphite exposes a very large surface area for
coating, so that the deposition rate is high until
essentially all the pores are closed. The ATJSG

but a rrmch larger average pore size, gains weight at a
lower rate for the given set of processing conditions.
The lack of a sharp change of slope in the ATJ-SG curve
attests the wide pore-size distribution of this material.
These data indicate that for the processing conditions
shown a small, uniform pore size is very desirable for
gas impregnation. However, a graphite such as the
ATJ-SG can be impregnated fairly efficiently if process-
ing conditions are optimized for it. In this case the
temperature of 850°C may be near optimum for the
AXF, but higher temperatures improved processing
efficiency for the ATJSG.

‘Evaluation of the carbon impregnant seal, of course,
must include irradiation testing, and this is in progress.
The first group of gas-pulse-impregnated specimens
prepared for irradiation in the HFIR was unloaded in
December. The eleven specimens had received fast-
neutron fluences ranging from 7.6 to 12.7 X 10?!
neutrons/cm at 705°C. Helium permeabilities before
irradiation ranged from 1.2 X 1077 to less than 1.3 X
1071 cm?/sec. After irradiation ten of the specimens
showed helium permeabilities greater than 107°

m?/sec, and the eleventh specimen was measured at
1.7 X 107 c¢m?/sec. While these results do not show
spectacular success, we are very encouraged that in the
first test one specimen came very close to giving the
desired performance. Since the permeability of this
specimen before irradiation was about 10™® cm?/sec,
the increase due to the test was approximately one
order of magnitude, an acceptable damage if the initial
permeability were lower.

There were two complicating factors in assessing the
irradiation performance relative to helium permeability,
both of which brighten the outlook for achieving
satisfactory results over that obtained by a cursory
glance at the data. First, we were attempting to study

only the seal on the outer surface of the cylindrical
specimens, since the inner surface is in contact with a
stainless steel spine in the test rig assembly during
irradiation. This may cause damage other than that
induced by neutrons. Since a coating which tends to
form on the inner surface, if undisturbed, can dominate
the helium-leak measurements, we reamed out the bore

of each specimen after impregnating and before leak

checking. However, after the irradiation experiment was

assembled we leamned that the reaming operation was

inadequate. It seems that reaming can serve to smear
the graphite and actually make the surface less perme-
able. To eliminate this problem it is necessary to
actually gouge a groove in the bore of the specimen
before leak checking, a procedure we employed in
fabricating the second set of specimens. The second
complication is the problem of how to determine
permeability. Since we actually measure a leak rate,
some wall thickness must be used to calculate a
permeability. We arbitrarily use the total wall thickness
of the specimen for this purpose, but we know that the
gas-tight section is much thinner. It is interesting to
note that if we use one-tenth of the total wall thickness

224

in the permeability calculation, the result for the best
specimen after this first test is about 1078 c¢m?/sec, the
value which is curmrently specified as the necessary
graphite surface permeability for an MSBR. '

We have prepared a new group of test specimens,
which were inserted in the HFIR in early February..
Seven new specimens and three of the first set,
including the one having the 1077 cm?/sec helium
permeability, will be irradiated in the HFIR to a peak
fast fluence of about 2.5 X 10?2 neutrons/cm?.

HFIR graphite irradiation experiments 5 and 6 have
been removed from the reactor, the specimens meas-
ured, and a number of the samples recycled in
experiments 7 and 8. The samples have received
exposures up to 2.5 X 10?2 neutrons/cm? (>50 kev)
and will accumulate up to 3.8 X 10°? neutrons/cm?®
when they are removed from HFIR in May 1969. '

The materials that have been irradiated and have given
significant results are listed in Table 17.5. The linear

dimensional changes resulting from the irradiation are
given in Figs. 17.5—17.8. The curves drawn in these
figures, with the exception of the Poco grade, were
obtained from least-squares fitting of the data to a
quadratic expression. The volumetric changes were
calculated from the linear dimensional chiange data. The
volumetric change curves are given in Figs. 17.9-17.11.
The more isotropic grades, H364, H337, and Poco
grades, have considerably more scatter in their results
than the anisotropic grades. This is undoubtably a result
of small sample-to-sample variations in the preferred
orientation. Dimensional stability is a result of isotropy
where the high growth rates in the ¢ and a axis
directions are balanced. Slight variations in the pre-
ferred orientation will result in a much larger fractional
variation in growth than for the anisotropic grades
having much larger linear dimensional changes.

The analysis of these results is still in progress;
however, several significant behavioral characteristics
which are important to the development of a more
radiation-resistant graphite are apparent. The first is
that the maximum densification of the graphite is a
linear function of the original density, as shown in Fig.

would suggest that the second-phase carbon is not part
of the structure and that the true structural density is
much lower than 1.83 g/cm®. The ATJ-S and ATJ-SG
are heavily impregnated grades; however, the im-
pregnate has graphitized and cannot be distinguished in
the microstructure. It might be that again the im-
pregnate has not completely integrated with the struc-
ture and is not completely a part of the true structural .
density. The major difference in the graphites with
different original densities is a reduction of open-pore
volume with increasing density. Therefore the relation-
ship shown in Fig. 17.12 is strong evidence that the
closure of the open pore volume is the major contribu-
tion to the densification of the graphite. The signifi-
cance of the relationship in Fig. 17.12 is that it
demonstrates a serious problem in obtaining an ex-
tended life for conventional graphites fabricated to the
high density required for the MSBR. The term *“conven-

tional graphites” excludes grades H364, H337, and the
Poco grades in the light of an exceptional behavioral
characteristic extending their expected lifetime as de-
scribed below.

If the densification rate is common for the graphites,
then the fluence required to obtain the maximum
density will also be a linear function of the original

density. This relationship is shown in Fig. 17.13. This

means that the more dense conventional materials will
achieve their maximum density more quickly, begin to
expand, and have a shorter lifetime.!® There are two
materials, H364 and natural flake, that do not fall on
the curve, and obviously the unplotted Poco grades
would not follow this correlation. The initial structure
of the natural flake grade is probably the most highly
graphitic of the group. Thus the initial crystallite
growth rates and the initial densification rate would be
lower, and the fluence required for maximum densifica-

tion would be extended. The lower crystallite growth

 

14The “lifetime” of the graphite is defined as that exposure

_Where void generation as evidenced by volume expansion is

sufficient to increase the open-pore size, allowing excessive
fission product and poison accumulation. We have arbitrarily
chosen the fluence required to return the material back to its
initial volume after some densification. This is a conservative
approach and may be particularly conservative for those
graphites which only densify 1-2% before expansion. The
actual limitation in lifetime will have to be determined by
experiment.

rate can only be hypothesized, since it will be shown
that the crystallite growth rates at minimum volume are
the same for all the grades of graphite tested.

The H364 and the Poco grades do not fall on the
curve in Fig. 17.13 because of a delayed densification.
This factor is very significant since it results in an
extension of the lifetime of the graphite. This delay in
densification is undoubtedly a result of the high
continuity of ¢ axis in the structure. The high con-
tinuity of c axis is reflected by the very high coefficient
of thermal expansion for these materials, 7 to 7.5 X
10°%/°C for the Poco grades and 6 to 7 X 107 for
H337 and H364 grades. Although the Poco and H337
grades have not reached their maximum density and
could not be included in Fig. 17.13, they do exhibit an
initial delay period (Figs. 17.7 and 17.8) and will very
likely fall above the line. A high continuity of ¢ axis in
the structure is required for the c-axis growth to cancel
the q-axis shrinkage and eliminate linear dimensional

~ changes and densification. The isotropy can be obtained

either by randomization of anisotropic coke particles or

- by randomization of the crystallites within the coke

particle to obtain an isotropic cdke. If anisotropic coke
is used, the coke particle will change dimensions, and
differential growth must be absorbed in the boundaries
between coke particles. However, if the coke is iso-
tropic, the differential growth will be absorbed in the
boundaries between crystallites within the coke parti-
cle. The isotropic particles would not change dimen-
sions, and the differential growth between particles

 
 

 

would be eliminated. At present, it is not certain how

grades H337 and H364 obtain their isotropy, but
- preliminary observations using electron transmission

microscopy’® of the Poco grades indicate that their

isotropy is obtained by using isotropic coke particles.

We do not understand why these graphites begin to
densify after a significant period of irradiation. The
c-axis continuity appears to be reduced, as evidenced by
the observation that the coefficient of thermal expan-
sion decreases as the material begins to densify.!® The
internal stresses created by the differential growth
should be compressive in the c-axis direction, so it is
difficult to understand how this could cause separations
along the ¢ axis. However, these graphites (H364, H337,
Poco grades) have begun to densify after an initial
delay, and the H364 has already achieved maximum
density and experienced some volume expansion,

The Poco and H364 materials are significantly supe-
rior in their resistance to both linear and volumetric
change during irradiation. The Poco grades have not
achieved their maximum densification in the present
data. It is fairly evident that if the relationship in Fig.

17.12 holds for the Poco grades (density of about 1.85
g/em®) and they densify to the indicated 3—3.5%
volume change, the fluence required to achieve maxi-
mum density will be greater than 3 X 10?2 neu-
trons/cm?. The extent that the lifetime will be ex-
tended would be conjecture at this time. The Poco
material is not available in the necessary shapes and
sizes required for an MSBR, and it will be necessary to
develop fabrication procedures for this graphite before
it can be considered a potential candidate for MSBR

- applications. The H364 and H337 grades of graphite are
reasonably stable and are available in the necessary sizes
and shapes. This material is still in the development

‘stages, and further property improvements may be
possible. These materials are currently prime candidates
for use in early MSBR’s.

One final significant result in this study is our analysis
of the linear dimensional changes. The linear dimen-
sional changes are largely dependent upon the preferred
orientation of the graphite. However, volumetric
changes, due to void closure, void production, and
lattice parameter changes, are also reflected in the linear

dimensional changes. These volumetric changes gener-

ally do not have the same anisotropy functions as the
crystallographic growth rates, so it is difficult to
separate the observed linear growth rates into crystallite

and volumetric growth. This must be done to compare
the effects of fabrication variables on the growth rates
under irradiation. The solution to this problem is to
obtain the linecar growth rates when the volume change
rate is O, thereby eliminating the volumetric contribu-
tion to linear growth. This allows a comparison of the

growth rates when they are dependent solely upon the

dimensional changes of the crystallites and their pre-
ferred orientation. This can be done by using the
following equation which describes the growth rates in
the i, j, and k directions in a single-phase model:

The rather remarkable agreement of ten grades of
graphite is surprising. This indicates that all ten ma-
terials have essentially the same average crystallite
growth rates independent of binder, Thermax additions,
impregnations, and filler coke. It is also significant to
note that the linear growth rates when A V) = 0 were
obtained over a range of exposures (7 X 102! to 17 X

crystallite growth rates are constant over this exposure
range. As mentioned earlier, it has been previously

lite growth rates may be real at low exposures when
they were measured. However, crystallite size measure-
ments of irradiated materials indicate that all materials
increase or decrease to a common crystallite size of
~150—200 A.'? This observation indicates that only
short-term benefits can be obtained from increased
crystallite size in the graphite,

In general, these results and the analyms of the results
lead to several conclus1ons

1. Linear dimensional stablhty is obtainable only with
isotropic or near-isotropic materials.

17.10 CALCULATION OF LIFETIME
AND INDUCED STRESSES IN MSBR CORES

S.J.Chang
W. P. Eatherly
J. W. Prados

To assess the potential effects of fast-neutron damage
in the core graphite of a molten-salt reactor, prelimi-
nary calculations of induced stress distributions and
distortions have been carried out by three different
techniques. As a first approximation, the core graphite
is assumed to be in the form of long cylindrical tubes,
although the actual shape will be more complex.

We start with the basic constitutive equations

éi=El [0; — 1 (o;+ gy )]
+ 25 (6, —0" G5+ 6) 1 £ (9,1)

+ k¢[o; - ui (0 + o)} +5(8,1),

in which ¢; and g; are the strain and stress in the ith
direction, the first term on the right is the elastic
distortion, the second the primary creep, the third the

secondary creep, and the last the rate of radiation-

induced distortion. Since the primary creep is a rapidly
saturating function, one may substitute.the asymptotic
value of the function f, thereby suppressing its time
dependence and combining it with the first term. Hence

&= [0~ @G+ 611
+k¢[0’i—}l'(0’j+0k)] + g(¢,t) »

2. Volumetric changes also contribute to linear dimen-

 sional changes, and the magnitude of their contribu-
tion is reduced by increasing the original structural
density. '

3. The major behavioral characteristic that separates
grades H364, H337, and Poco graphites from the
conventional graphites is that of a delayed densifica-
tion, This is the only process observed which appears
to extend the useful life of the graphite, The origin
of this desirable characteristic is not clear, but we
have observed it only in the two types of materials
having isotropic structures with very h1gh coef-
ﬁclents of thermal expansion.

where (£} and {u) are the effective Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio respectively.

A solution to these equations in closed analytic form
can be found by using operator algebra. The solution is
limited to the requirement that the parameters (E),{u),
k¢, and g’ not be functions of radial position in the
cylinder. This restriction is not a serious one for the
present calculations.

A second solution has been developed by modifying
an iterative technique employed in the analysis of stress

- and distortion in coated-particle fuels.2® This approach
permits k¢ to be a function of radial position, does not

require isotropy in the graphite, and permits the
secondary creep to be a more general function of the
stresses.

The third solution, using an impulse-type analysis, has
also been derived,?! which further generalizes the
solutions to arbitrary boundary shapes providing only
that elastic solutions can be found. It is limited,
however, to a linear stress dependence in the secondary
creep. '

All three solutions have been computer programmed,
debugged, and shown to give the same numerical results
within their region of overlap. In particular, the stresses
and distortions have been calculated for the present

-reactor parameters aimed at a four-year graphite life.

The material parameters employed are as follows:
Young’s modulus: E = 1.9 X 10° psi,
Poisson’s ratio: u =0.27,

thermal expansion coefficient: & =(5.52X 107% + 1.00
X 107°1) (°C)?,

thermal conductivity: K = 37.63(T + 273.1)°7 w cm™
o™,

‘ seoondary “Poisson’s ratio”: u" =0.50,

creep coefficient: X = (5.3 — 145 X 102 T+ 14 X
107°7%) X 10727 (psinvt) 1.

The induced distortion rate g(¢, f) was derived pri-
marily from the experimentally determined behavior of
British isotropic Gilso graphite:

In all the above equations T is the graphite temperature
in degrees centigrade.

Parameters associated with the reactor were taken as
follows:

graphite outer radius: b =5.39 cm,
graphite inner radius: ¢ =0.762 cm,

where z/l is the fractional height along the core center
line. The heat transfer coefficient between the salt and
graphite was calculated from the Dittus-Boelter equa-
tion for turbulent flow with salt properties as follows:

thermal conductivity: 0.75 Btu hr? ft™* (°F)7?,

The results of the calculations are as follows: The
graphite is under the most severe flux-temperature
environment at zfI = 0.55 (i.e., slightly over halfway up
the core) and at that point has a lifetime?? of 4.1 years.
The maximum thermal stresses are tensile and occur at
the surfaces of the graphite (see Fig. 17.15). They

exceed 560 psi. The maximum radiation-induced
stresses are tensile and occur at the end of the graphite
life (see Fig. 17.16). They do not exceed 500 psi. Since
the graphite should have an ultimate tensile strength of
about 5000 psi, these stresses are not significant.

The dimensional behaviors are shown in Figs. 17.17
and 17.18. These are expressed in terms of the
function G;, representing the percentage distortion of
the ith dimension. The cylindrical graphite tubes will
show a maximum radial shrinkage of about 2.2% and a

18.1 INFLUENCE OF TITANIUM AND CARBON
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
OF NICKEL-BASE ALLOYS

C. E. Sessions

We have extensively investigated the influence of

.titanjum and carbon interactions on the high-tempera-

ture ‘creep-rupture properties of laboratory melts of
Ni—12% Mo—-7% Cr alloy. The influences of heat
treatment, strain rate, and composition were evaluated
for creep testing at 650°C in air. Representative results
of the heats listed in Table 18.1 will be discussed. The

material investigated has a base composition of Ni—12%

Mo—7% Cr—0.5% Ti, with the carbon content in-
creasing from 0.003 to 0.32% for heats 193 to 242. We
also included heat 198, which contains no titanium and
0.04% C. Thus a comparison of heats 196 and 198
would give the effect of titanium alone, since these two
alloys have an equivalent carbon content. _
Carbon concentration has a marked effect on the
rupture life of this alloy (Fig. 18.1). The rupture life
increases by four orders of magnitude for a factor of
100 increase in the carbon level. No added strengthen-
ing is found, however, above ~0.1% C. This increase in
rupture life is the result of a marked decrease in the rate
of secondary creep deformation, as shown in Fig. 18.2.

The steady-state creep rate decreases by three orders of

magnitude over the carbon levels investigated for each

of the three different pretest heat treatments shown in
Fig. 18.2. Note that the samples aged 100 hr at 870°C
have a higher creep rate than either of the solution-
annealed samples. Also, the presence of 0.5% Ti lowers
the creep rate at the 005% C level by a factor of
approximately 10.

A correlation of the creep ductility as a function of
carbon content and secondary creep rate is shown in
Figs. 18.3 and 18.4 respectively. The total elongation
experienced at rupture when tested at 40,000 psi and
650°C shows little variation for the heat treatments
investigated over the range of carbon concentration of
0.003 to 0.1%. Above 0.1% C we observed an increase
in ductility at 40,000 psi. The heat with no titanium,
No. 198, exhibits roughly the same ductility as the
heats containing titanium. |

Correlating the total elongation with creep rate, as in
Fig. 18.4, for the intermediate and high carbon levels,
we find lower ductility at a given creep rate for the heat
without titanium (No. 198). The corresponding heats
‘containing titanium (heats 195 and 196) show 8 to 10%
greater total elongation for a given creep rate at 65_0°C.
For the higher carbon levels (0.27 and 0.32% C) the
ductility—strain-rate relationships differ even though
the carbon levels of the two heats are nearly the same.

A final comparison of the effect of titanium on the
rupture life of this alloy is shown in Fig. 18.5 for three
different heat treatments. The presence of 0.5% Ti

aging did result in a reduction in the high-temperature
ductility of the modified a]loy and that the change was
more significant after the 760°C treatment. This indica-

tion of a thermal instability in the alloy system,

however, required assessment for longer aging times and
for creep conditions to fully characterize the material.

strain rate of 0.002 min . The effect of aging at 650°C
is to reduce the high-temperature ductility slightly after
1500 hr and significantly after 3000 hr for each heat
except 466-548. Aging at 760°C reduces the ductility
for all heats a significant amount after both 1500 and
3000 hr. A corresponding increase in the yield and
ultimate tensile strengths is found for most aging
conditions.

The effect of pretest thermal-mechanical treatment is
to influence the overall level of strength and ductility,
as shown in Table 18.2; however, the influence of any
particular pretest heat treatment differs from heat to
heat,

Representative tensile curves showing the effect of
prior aging on the 650°C behavior are shown in Fig.
18.6. Each curve is for heat 467-548 (1.2% Ti), with the
heat treatments listed in the caption. If we interpret the
serrations as being due to the effect of solute-atom—
dislocation interactions, then the 760°C aging treat-
ment has eliminated the serrations by precipitation of

-solutes from solid solution.

Evaluation of the effects of aging on the creep
properties of these modified alloys is currently in
progress. Table 18.3 lists the results from control and
aged samples tested to date. The control tests on
unaged samples show the greatest strength and the
lowest ductility for the prestrained material. The
optimum ductility was obtained from the samples
solution annealed at 1260°C prior to creep testing.
Tests on the aged samples indicate no deterioration in
the creep properties due to aging 1500 hr at either 650

 Our previous studies showed that titanium-modified
(0.5%) Hastelloy N had good postirradiation properties
when irradiated at temperatures up to 660°C, but that
very poor properties resulted for madlatmg above
704°C.* We also found that 2 small melt that did not
contain titanium exhibited a similar dependence on
irradiation temperature; so we suspected that the
variation of properties with irradiation temperature

the alloy composition and the irradiation temperature;
in general, MC carbides were associated with good

We then irradiated several experimental alloys that
contained various amounts of carbide-forming elements
such as Hf, Nb, Ti, Zr, and Y. The nominal chemical
compositions of the alloys studied are given in Table
18.4, and the results of postirradiation creep-rupture
tests are summarized in Fig. 18.7. All the data points

shown in Fig. 18.7 are for samples irradiated at 760°C

and tested at 650°C. The first number by each point is

tests and are labeled, but no data points are shown.

 

SR. E. Gehlbach, this report, sect. 18.4.

Heat 5911 is standard Hastelloy N that has been
vacuum melted. When irradiated at 650°C its properties
are represented by the indicated solid line; but after
irradiation at 760°C the rupture life is much shorter,
and the fracture strains are very low.

Several heats containing 0.5% Ti were included in this
study. The data on heat 66-548 used to construct the

" line on the extreme left of Fig. 18.7 were presented
previously.* The indicated points for this same heat
from the current experiment agree well with the
previous observations. The other heats containing 0.5%
Ti (21545, 104, 7320, 67-526) were not affected as
drastically by irradiation temperature, but their postir-
radiation properties are not as good as those for
standard air-melted Hastelloy N. Alloys 107 (1% Ti)
and 67-548 (1.2% Ti) give some indication that alloys
with higher titanium concentrations may be stable
during irradiation at 760°C.

Alloy 273 was prepared to determine whether a small
addition of silicon (0.5%) would help stabilize the
desired MC-type carbide in an alloy containing 0.5% Ti
during irradiation at 760°C. Comparison of the results

for heats 104 and 273 indicates that the silicon addition
did not lead to improved properties. '

Alloys 146 and 147 contain 1% Zr in addition to
small amounts of Re. The postirradiation properties of
these alloys are quite good, and the improved behavior
is probably due to the Zr since alloy 112 (1.2% Zr) also
has good properties. However, since the Zr addition
causes poor weldability, we plan no further develop-
ment of alloys with Zr additions.

Heat 67-504 (0.5% Hf) was found to have excellent
properties following irradiation at 650°C,° but the

‘results shown in Fig. 18.7 for this alloy after irradiation

~ at 760°C are poor, Heat 232 with 1% Hf has improved

properties, and heat 184 with 1% Ti and 1% Hf has even
better properties.

Heat 237 contains 1% Nb and 0.2% Si, and the
postirradiation properties are not very good. Heat 181
contains 2% Nb, 0.5% Ti, and no Si, and the properties
are very attractive. The question of whether a sufficient
quantity of Nb could be added to give good postirradia-
tion properties is still open.

- 240

The postirradiation rupture life of heat 183 (1% Ti
and 1% Y) is not very good, but its fracture strains are
attractive. Metallographic examination showed that the
grain size was very small, and our previous experience
leads us to believe that higher preirradiation anneals (to
get a larger grain size) might improve the rupture life.

These observations show that several alloy combina-
tions involving additions of Nb, Hf, Ti, and Y have
promise for prolonged use at temperatures above
700°C. '

18.4 ELECTRON MICROSCOPY STUDIES
R. E. Gehlbach = S.W.Cook

We reported previously that carbide precipitation in
Hastelloy N is sensitive to the chemical composition.”*®
In the air-melted heats of the standard alloy, containing
0.4 to 0.6% Si, only M¢C-type precipitates form. They
are enriched in silicon and are stabilized by its presence.
Reduction of the silicon to trace levels, as is possible by
vacuum melting practice, results in M, C-type precipita-
tion after exposure to intermediate aging temperatures.
This M,C can be readily put into solid solution at
normal solution-annealing temperatures, whereas the
M¢C type is not heat treatable.

Precipitation in the modified (12% Mo) versions of
the alloy is sensitive to alloying additions of Ti, Nb, Zr,
and Hf? and when these elements are present the
precipitation processes are temperature dependent.
Mechanical properties, particularly after irradiation, are
also affected by composition and temperature.!® We
are concentrating our studies on understanding the role
of these alloying additions on the types and mor-
phologies of precipitates and evaluating the effects they
have in controlling the mechanical behavior of the
material after irradiation. The precipitates being studied
are those that result from aging at 650 and 760°C (an
MSBR will operate at 704°C).

The various carbides have been identified using several
techniques, The types and relative amounts of carbides
present in a specimen were determined by dissolving the
matrix and analyzing the remaining precipitates by
x-ray diffraction. Selected-area electron diffraction and
electron-microscope—microprobe analysis were used to

relate the crystal structure, morphology, and composi-

tion of individual precipitates on extraction replicas.
The distribution of precipitates was observed by elec-
tron microscopy of thinned bulk specimens and extrac-

" tion replicas,

Since the silicon level in these modified alloys is low,
the MgC formed in the standard material is not present.
In the modified alloys without additions of the Ti-
group elements, only M, C precipitates at aging temper-
atures of 650 and 760°C. The addition of the Ti-group
elements promotes the formation and stability of
carbides of the MC type, having face-centered cubic
structures with lattice parameters ranging from 4.21 to
4,68 A. Higher concentrations of the Ti-group elements
are required to stabilize the MC types at 760°C than at
650°C. These trends are shown in Table 18.5.

The M,C carbides have the Mo,C structure but
contain about 10 to 20% Cr and thus would be more
appropriately designated (Mo,Cr),C. The compositions
of the MC types depend on the amount of the
particular elements from the Ti group contained in the
material. At low Ti concentrations, (Mo,Cr)C is formed.
Increasing the concentration of Ti in the alloy results in
some Ti substituting for Cr in the carbides, with an
increase in lattice parameter. Adding Nb, Hf, or Zr
promotes the stability of the carbides of that group
(e.g., HfC). In general, the MC carbides are finer than
the M,C type, and their distribution in the bulk
material would appear to result in superior postirradia-
tion mechanical properties than would that of the M,C
precipitate. :

The distribution of MC, or (Mo, Cr)C, in heat 66-548
(a commercial alloy with 0.45% Ti) after aging at 650°C
is shown in Fig. 18.8. Particular importance is given to
the fact that many fine precipitates lie adjacent to the
grain boundaries and extend into the matrix. In
contrast, aging this material at 760°C produces larger
precipitates in both the matrix and grain boundaries.
Some precipitate also exists in the form of very thin
(probably <100 A) continuous films covering extensive
areas in the grain boundaries. These thin films and the
helium bubbles noted in this material after irradia-
tion'! would be expected to result in poor postirradia-
tion mechanical properties.

The distributions of precipitates formed during irradi-
ation and formed by aging in the absence of irradiation
at similar temperatures are different, Figure 18.9 is a
transmission electron micrograph of an unstressed
specimen irradiated for 1128 hr at 635°C in the ORR.

Although a considerable amount of precipitate is
present in the grain boundaries, the distribution is
considerably different from that obtained by aging in
the absence of irradiation at 650°C (Fig. 18.8). Essen-
tially no precipitates were present in a specimen
irradiated for 1128 hr at 703°C; however, many
bubbles were present on the grain boundaries, and
fracture occurred in this material with essentially no
strain.!? Bubbles were observed at grain boundaries in
the material after irradiation at 635°C, but the irregular
precipitates in the grain boundaries probably strengthen
the boundaries and prevent the propagation of grain
boundary cracks.

It would appear that a structure similar to that shown
in Fig. 188 would result in good postirradiation
properties. The fine precipitates along grain boundaries
seem characteristic of the MC-type carbides. As shown
in Table 18.5, increasing the amounts of the Ti-group
elements promotes the stability of these carbides. The
alloys with the higher concentrations of these elements
(heats 181, 184, 67-548) exhibit excellent postirradia-
tion properties after irradiation at 760°C.'? Although
we have not examined the phases present in these alloys
after irradiation, it appears likely that the MC carbides
are present and occur in a favorable distribution.

18.5 MEASUREMENT OF RESIDUAL STRESSES
- INHASTELLOY N WELDS
A.G.Cepolina D, A. Canonico

We have been investigating the levels and distribution
of residual welding stresses in % -in.-thick Hastelloy N

plate and the effects of various thermal treatments to

reduce or eliminate these stresses. The theory and
experimental procedures were discussed pre-
viously,12*14 and more recently data were presented! s
relating the as-welded residual stresses to variations in
heat input and shielding gas. The effect of stress-relief
treatments at 1177, 870, and 650°C on the distribution
of the residual stresses was also discussed.!

Recently, we have investigated the effects of a
treatment of 6 hr at 760°C on the residual stresses of
weldments made at 15,000 j per inch of weld. The
results of this treatment on the residual stresses are
shown in Fig. 18.10. For comparison, we have included
the distribution of the as-welded residual stresses. It can
be seen that the 760°C treatment is effective toward
reducing the peak tangential and radial residual stresses.
Undoubtedly, even lower values can be attained with a
longer treatment at 760°C.

18.6 CORROSION STUDIES
J.W.Koger A.P.Litman

We are continuing our study of the compatibility of
fused fluoride salts with structural materials of interest
to the MSRP. The studies currently are centered around
the compatibility of the Hastelloy N alloys with salts
appropriate for single-fluid breeder reactors, but some
tests begun earlier with salts of interest for two-fluid
systems have been continued. Eight natural circulation
loops are presently in operation. Table 18.6 details the
service parameters of these test units, and Table 18.7
gives the compositions of the standard and titanium-
modified Hastelloy N.

18.6.1 Fuel Saits

Loop 1255, constructed of standard Hastelloy N and
containing a simulated MSRE fuel salt plus 1 mole %
ThF,, continues to operate without difficulty after 6.9
years,

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel
and containing removable specimens in the hot leg, has

operated about 5.6 years with the same salt as loop
1255. A plot of the weight change of the insert

specimens at various temperatures is given in Fig. 18.11

~as a function of operating time. The corrosion rates

based on these weight changes range from 1 to 2
mils/year. - -

Loop NCL-16, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated
with the two-fluid MSBR fuel salt for over 9000 hr. A

plot of the weight change of the specimens in the

hottest and coldest positions as a function of operating
time is given in Fig. 18.12. The average corrosion rate
has been <0.05 mil/year in this loop. The hot-leg
specimens show that the titanium-modified alloy spec-
imens at 704°C (1300°F) and 676°C (1250°F) have
smaller weight changes than the standard specimens at
660°C (1220°F). Figure 18.13 shows the changes in

concentration of chromium and iron in the salt as a
function of operating time. The chromium has shown a
steady increase (linear for the last 4000 hr), while the
iron increased initially and now is slowly decreasing as
the iron fluoride oxidizes the chromium in the Hastel-
loy N.

18.6.2 Fertile-Fissile Salts

Loops NCL-18 and NCL-19, constructed of standard
Hastelloy N with removable specimens in each leg, have
operated for 2900 and 3600 hr, respectively, with the
fertile-fissile salt under identical temperature condi-
tions. Loop NCL-19 has a molybdenum hot finger
containing bismuth at the bottom of the hot leg (Fig.
18.14). These loops are being operated to obtain data
on the compatibility of the fertile-fissile salt with the
Hastelloy alloys and to determine if contacting the salt
with liquid bismuth will affect the corrosion rate.

The weight changes of specimens from loop NCL-18
were measured after 1465 hr exposure to the salt. The
standard Hastelloy N specimen at 699°C lost 0.5
mg/cm?, while the titanium-modified Hastelloy N
specimen at the same temperature lost 0.3 mg/cm?.

The weight changes of specimens from loop NCL-19
were measured after 2250 hr exposure to the salt. The
standard Hastelloy N specimen at 699°C lost 0.6
mgfcm?, while the titanium-modified Hastelloy N
specimen at the same temperature lost 0.2 mg/cm?.
Table 18.8 gives the bismuth concentration in the salt
after various operating times.

We are investigating the reason for the large amount
of bismuth in the 840-hr salt sample. The lower
bismuth content in later salt samples indicates either
that the analysis was in error or that bismuth was

- possibly entrapped in the salt. Work is under way to-

establish the sensitivity of the bismuth chemical
analysis procedure to salts of these types. A study of
the analytical procedure for the determination of
bismuth in the salt has indicated that at the 100-ppm
level, one should not place much confidence in the

" numerical values. Additional evidence of analytical

uncertainty was found in the reported bismuth analyses
of the salt from loop NCL-18, <25 ppm at O hr, 60

ppm at 672 hr, <20 ppm at 1817 hr (loop NCL-18 does

not contain any intentional bismuth addition). In any
case no effect of bismuth is apparent in the corrosion
rates, Specimens in loops NCL-18 and NCL-19 do not
show significantly different weight changes. In 1484 hr
of operation the chromium content of the salt increased
from <25 to 57 ppm in both loops. No changes in the
concentrations of the other constituents have been
noted.

NCL-13A in August, circulation could not be achieved.
Our analysis of the situation led us to conclude that

previous overheating of the loop had caused BF; to
evolve and had changed the composition of salt from
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) to a composition much
richer in NaF. This in turn would cause the higher-
melting NaF to segregate in the loop. To bring the
composition back to normal, we added BF 3 gas through
the surge tank until a slight overpressure built up over
the salt. (No devices were available to measure the
amount of BF; gas added.) Circulation of the salt was
then started. Only a small AT (55°C) was obtained at
first. Further additions of BF; lowered the temperature
of the salt in the cold leg and increased the AT to about
125°C. Since more BF; did not cause immediate
changes, the additions of gas were stopped. The loop is

‘now operating satisfactorily with a AT of 125°C and a

maximum temperature of 607°C.

Figure 18.15 gives the weight changes of specimens at
various temperatures as a function of operating time.
These initial values are relatively high, with the average
corrosion rate over the first 2200 hr being about 1
mil/year at the maximum temperature of 605°C.
Analysis of the salt has shown evidence of a large
amount of water, 900 ppm, which, because of HF
formation, could contribute to a high rate of corrosion.
However, these high rates may also be the result of
inserting new specimens into a loop system which
already had operated 5000 hr. Future measurements
will better determine the true corrosion rate in this
system. A “cold-finger”” device, which will continuously
remove corrosion products from the salt, is scheduled
to be used on this loop.

Loop NCL-14, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated for
11,600 hr with the fluoroborate coolant salt. The
weight changes of the specimens at the various positions
in the loop and at different times are given in Fig.

© 18.16. This loop operated about 3500 hr with the H,0

content in the salt between 500 and 1000 ppm. During
that period the weight changes were small and predict-
able as a function of time. Wet air then came in contact
with the salt through a defective gas line, and the water
content and corrosion rate increased dramatically.

- During the last 5000 hr the H, O content of the salt has
~decreased, and the corrosion rate has again decreased as

a function of time. The rate of maximum weight loss
over the last 5000 hr has been ~1.5 X 107 mg cm™
hr™! (~0.65 mil/year). This corrosion rate is higher by
a factor of 2 than that measured during the earlier

operating period when the H,O content was between -

500 and 1000 ppm.
The concentration of impurities in the salt in loop

18.17. It is obvious that the nickel and molybdenum
concentration increased significantly during the time of
water ingestion. Nickel and molybdenum are normally
not oxidized by fluoride salts, and their increase in the
salt is evidence of a generalized HF attack.!®

Four standard Hastelloy N capsules were operated
with NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) fluoroborate salt at
607°C with BF, overpressures of 200 torrs, 50 psig,
100 psig, and 400 psig respectively. A typical capsule
system is shown in Fig. 18.18. Examination after 6800
hr disclosed that the capsules and specimens were clean
and that no corrosion products were visible in the salt.
The largest weight loss, equivalent to a uniform loss of
0.02 mil/year, was seen on a specimen exposed to the
100-psig BF3 vapor in capsule 3. Of particular interest
is the observation that all the specimens exposed to the
salt gained weight. We believe that this can be explained
by the salt analyses, which show an increase of
chromium in the salt from 20 to 75 ppm and a decrease
in iron from 220 to 20 ppm. This implies that the iron
fluoride initially in the salt oxidized chromium from
the Hastelloy N to form chromium fluoride, and the
reduced iron was deposited on the metal. The water
content of the salt remained 400 ppm during the test,
while the oxygen increased from 200 to 1400 ppm.
Since the largest amount of oxygen was found in the

- salt of the capsule which had the largest BF; pressure,

we believe that the oxygen entered as an impurity in
the BF ;3 gas. Equating the chromium loss from the alloy

to the chromium gain by the salt gave a bulk diffusion
coefficient for chromium in Hastelloy N of 1.0 X
10715 ¢m?/sec. This value is in reasonable agreement
with previous diffusion measurements.!?>2° The most
significant result of this experiment is the relatively low
corrosion rate observed for Hastelloy N in sodium
fluoroborate that contains <500 ppm H,O. This
emphasizes the importance of water vapor in flu-
oroborate salt corrosion.

Loop NCL-17 will be used to investigate the influence
of water content on the corrosion rate of Hastelloy N in

- sodium fluoroborate. This loop will be constructed of

standard Hastelloy N and will contain the fluoroborate
salt at the conditions of loop NCL-14. Known amounts

- of wet helium will be added to the salt, and the

resulting changes in the corrosion rate will be measured.

A new standard Hastelloy N loop, NCL-20, which will
contain fluoroborate salt, is being constructed. This
loop will operate at the temperature extremes of the
salt-metal interfaces in a 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR,
namely, 675 to 410°C. The object of this experiment
will be to determine whether these temperatures will
lead to more unfavorable corrosion than that already
observed in tests where we have simulated the bulk
fluid temperatures of 605 and 460°C.

18.6.5 Comparison of the Kinetic Behavior
of Nickel- and Iron-Based Alloys in
Molten Fluoride Salts

The above results allow us to examine the kinetics of
the dissolution processes in iron- and nickel-base alloys
exposed to fuel and coolant salts. The weight losses of
type 304L stainless steel and of standard and titanium-
modified Hastelloy N in fuel salt as a function of time
at temperature between 660 and 704°C are presented in
Fig. 18.19. The plots assume a time dependence of the
form ,

where W is the weight loss in milligrams per square
centimeter of surface area, ¢ and b are constants, and ¢
is the time in hours. Terms for this equation are given
for each material in Table 18.9. _

the weight losses of chromium that should have resulted
if the chromium concentration at the surface had been
reduced to zero. -

As shown in Fig. 18.21, corrosion rates calculated in
this manner are in close agreement with results for the

are slightly lower than the observed rates in the

lower than the observed rates for any of the flu-

corrosion rates for the fluoroborate loops suggest that

these experiments.

18.7 FORCED CONVECTION LOOP
P. A.Gnadt W.R.Huntley

The MSR-FCL-1 forced convection loop is being
operated to evaluate the compatibility of standard
Hastelloy N with NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant
salt at conditions similar to those which would exist
with fluoroborate in the MSRE coolant circuit. During
this report period the test loop ran for approximately
2000 hr at design conditions. '

For most of the period the system operated at 588°C
maximum bulk fluid temperature and 510°C minimum
bulk fluid temperature. Figure 18.22 is a typical
temperature profile of the system; this profile is based
on a computer plot of the temperature information
from the test Ioop and on heat transfer calculations
which estimate the inner wall temperatures. Informa-
tion for this and other computer plots is gathered by
the Dextir data logging equipment in Building 9201-3.

Salt samples were taken at the start of the test run
and at periodic intervals. The results of the salt analyses
are listed in Table 18.11. The salt charge used in this
experiment contained more metallic impurities (Fe, Ni,
Cr, Mo) than are usually found?! The changes in
concentrations of impurities, especially Fe, Cr, and
H, O, have been rather erratic as a function of operating
time. Further operating time will be required to
separate the true chemical changes from the random
scatter of analyses.

The pump has been operated with a helium purge
through the pump seal (oil) catch basin. The original
intent>? ‘was to add BF; to the pump bowl to make up
any BF3; which diffused into the seal catch basin and
was swept away by the helium purge. The BF; losses,
however, are so small that the BF; addition system is
not being used.

Measurements of the BF3 in the seal purge gas
indicate that the helium (80 cm®/min) leaving the
pump oil catch basin is contaminated with approxi-
mately 0.01% BF;. Analytical results of oil samples for

The low BF3 concentration in the hehum purge has
resulted in little acid accumulation at the gas purge line

outlets, Inversion of the purge line and a bucket-type
catch basin have also helped to reduce the plugging
problem at the end of the purge line. Only a few cubic
centimeters of the acid have accumulated in the bucket.

We are studying the oxidation and scaling resistance

noted at the end of the purge line.

‘Heat transfer performance of the NaBF,-NaF (92-8
mole %) salt was observed in a resistance-heated section
of the corrosion loop that was 0.410 in. in inside
diameter and 105 in. long. Performance data were
obtained at heater inlet temperatures from 521 to
571°C, heater exit temperatures from 566 to 632°C,
over a Reynolds modulus range of 4750 to 47,000, and
at heat fluxes from 15,750 to 160,000 Btu hr™! ft72.
The data obtained were correlated quite well by the
Dittus-Boelter equation, as shown in Fig. 18.23.
Although no statistical analysis has been made, we
estimate that the error in the measurements on the test
loop does not exceed 20%. The data of Fig. 18.23 were
plotted using recent?® physical property values, and it
is significant that the use of available physical property

various elements in controlling oxidation and scaling so
that we can obtain a modified alloy with adequate
oxidation resistance.

We found that commercial heats of Hastelloy N with
only minor differences in composition can have large
differences in scaling resistance. Heat 5065 had about
1% weight loss in tests where it was heated for 1000 hr
at 982°C and cycled to room temperature every 25 hr,
whereas heat 2477 had about 49% weight loss under the
same conditions. The major differences in composition
are in manganese and silicon, with heat 5065 having
0.55 and 0.57% and heat 2477 having 0.055 and
0.0475% respectively, Alloy No. 10, a laboratory remelt
of heat 2477 with 0.5% silicon added, had negligible
weight loss under the above conditions.

After determining the importance of silicon, we used
the electron microprobe analyzer to determine the

distribution of silicon in oxidized samples. An accel-

erating voltage of 20 kv and a specimen current of 0.02
pa were used to determine the Si Ka x-ray intensities.
Spot counts were made at various locations in the
samples, and a silicon enrichment was noted at the
oxide-metal interface and in some of the grain
boundary penetrations. To graphically display this, we
made a CRT (cathode ray tube) display of Si Ka x rays
at the surface. Figure 18.24 shows such a display
compared with an optical photomicrograph of the same
area. By studying the two displays, one can see that
silicon is concentrated at grain boundaries and along the
interface between the metal and the oxide. We thought
at first that the round voids in the optical photo-
micrograph also had silicon, but the CRT dmplay
indicates that this is not true.

Heat 5065 had some large cracks that were filled with

oxidation product, and some of these were scanned to
see the distribution of the major alloying elements and
silicon (Fig. 18.25).

The silicon and chromium were enriched at the
oxide-metal interface, and molybdenum, nickel, and

enriched in nickel and iron, while others were enriched
in molybdenum. The significance of this distribution of
alloying elements is not known. Figure 18.26 shows the
areas of major silicon concentration, The clear zone
below the specimen surface is depleted in chromium,
and this probably accounts for some of the subsurface
voids that do not contain silicon. -

The sample of heat 2477 with low silicon, which

showed poor oxidation resistance, did not show any

silicon enrichment, Figure 18.27 is a CRT display
showing the distribution of silicon, chromium, molyb-
denum, nickel, and iron, It appears that molybdenum
and chromium are concentrated at the surface and that
nickel and iron are depleted in the same areas. The

silicon-rich areas seen just off the surface are due to the

silicon naturally occumring in the pelletized alumina
used in mounting the metallographic sample.

Figure 18.28 shows the distribution of the major
alloying elements in heat 2477 after 1000 hr cycling to
982°C in air with cycles of 15 min heating and 5 min
cooling. There are no appreciable concentration dif-
ferences of any of the elements. This is-in contrast to
the sample cycled on a frequency of 1 cycle per 25 hr,
which showed marked concentration differences near
the metal-oxide interface (Fig. 18.27).

Figure 18.29 shows the distribution of the major
alloying elements in heat 5067 after cycling in air for
1000 hr at 982°C (15-5 cycle). Heat 5067 has interme-
diate amounts of manganese and silicon, 0.48 and
0.42% respectively. In this sample the molybdenum and
silicon seem to be enriched together in the precipitates,
and iron, nickel, and manganese are depleted in the
same areas, ‘

The reason for the different morphologies of the
oxides is not understood, but may be related to the
manganese and silicon content, which could affect the
solubilities of other alloying elements. Wasielewski®*
has shown that by adding 0.2% lanthanum to Hastelloy
X, the surface oxide can be changed from pre-
dominantly Cr, O3 to MnCr, O, , which gives increased
oxidation resistance and spalling resistance. Gehlbach

“and McCoy?® have found that the silicon content

affects the amount and form of precipitates found in
Hastelloy N. The high silicon content favors the
formation of MgC carbides; the low silicon content

Table 18.12 shows the dlstnbutlon of the major
alloying elements in the matrix in the metal near the
oxide-metal interface and in the oxide of heats 2477
and 5067. This shows some enrichment of silicon and
some depletion of nickel in the oxide and increases near
the oxide-metal interface of chromium and iron in heat
5067 and of chromium in heat 2477.

These results show that silicon plays an important
role in the oxidation of Hastelloy N. The concentration

of this element at the oxide-metal interface may be
responsible for the lower oxidation and scaling rate of
high-silicon alloys. However, the lower silicon level may
be necessary to obtain the desired destruction of
precipitates for optimum resistance to irradiation dam-
age. The oxidation resistance at the design temperature
of an MSBR of 704°C would be adequate at any silicon
level, and the higher oxidation rate of the low-silicon
alloy would only be important during unexpected
transients.

19.1 GRAPHITE—HASTELLOY N TRANSITION
JOINT DEVELOPMENT

J. P. Hammond

Work continues on graded transition joints for joining

graphite to Hastelloy N. These joints, described in de-

tail previously,! comprise a series of tungsten-rich,
nickel-matrix dispersion alloys brazed together to span
the large gap in thermal expansion coefficients between
nuclear graphite and Hastelloy N. Premium grades of
graphite are also introduced adjacent to the nuclear
graphite to reduce the dimensional instability associated
with irradiation of nuclear graphite.

Several of these transition joints were prepared using
processes and materials developed previously.? A mini-
mum of intervening segments was employed in an
attempt to reduce fabrication costs; the construction of
the joints is illustrated in Fig. 19.1. The coefficients of
thermal expansion of the individual segments in relation
to those for nuclear graphite and Hastelloy N are given
in Fig. 19.2. The Poco graphite segment, inserted to im-
part irradiation stability, has an expansion coefficient
about midway between that for nuclear graphite and
for Hastelloy N. This leaves a much narrower gap to be
bridged by heavy-metal alloy segments. This bridging is
done with two heavy-metal segments, one containing
80% tungsten (matching the Poco graphite) and the
other containing 60% tungsten (intermediate between
the 80% tungsten segment and the Hastelloy N terminal
piece). We matched the expansion coefficients of the

 Poco graphite and the adjoining heavy metal, since

failures often occurred at this interface.
Calculations indicated that the very low modulus of
elasticity of graphitic materials® would allow com-

posites of nuclear graphite bonded to Poco graphite
to be cycled between 650°C and room tempera-
ture without straining the materials above their elas-
tic limits, The couplings between the metallic com-
ponents of this joint should undergo moderate plastic
strain in such thermal cycling; however, we expected
that they might sustain it without failing because of the
good ductilities of the materials involved.

Two three-segment joints were subjected to twenty-
four 20-min cycles of heating and cooling between
750°C and room temperature without producing any
detectable cracks. Copper between the Cr,Cj;-coated
graphite members remained intact and did not appear
to react or alloy in any way with the chromium carbide.
The overall results are encouraging and indicate that the
joints should show excellent behavior under service
conditions. - '

19.2 DEVELOPMENT OF CORROSION-RESISTANT
BRAZING ALLOYS FOR MOLYBDENUM

R.W.Gunkel N.C.Cole

Molybdenum seems to be compatible with fluoride
salts and with bismuth and would appear to be a good
structural material for an MSBR processing plant were
it not for its relatively poor weldability. This problem

could be circumvented if we could develop a brazing

alloy that was compatible with fluoride salts and bis-
muth and had a flow temperature low enough to pre-
vent recrystallization and subsequent embrittlement of
the molybdenum. A small program is under way to
develop suitable brazing alloys for this application.
A literature survey showed that most refractory
metals were resistant to bismuth and could therefore be
considered as candidate materials for formulation of
experimental brazing alloys. About 15 refractory-metal-
base brazing filler metals were formulated and evalu-
ated, but the lowest melting temperature obtained was
1525°C. For lower-melting filler metals, iron appeared
to be the most promising candidate material. Brazing
temperatures in the range of 1140 to 1180°C have been

attractive as materials for brazing molybdenum-base -

alloys below their recrystallization temperatures. One
disadvantage of the filler metals investigated to date is
their low ductility; therefore one very important phase
of our future work will be to obtain more-ductile
alloys.

The excellent flowabihty of these iron-base filler
metals on molybdenum has been demonstrated on T-
joints. Figure 19.3 is a photomicrograph of a molyb-
denum-TZM T-joint brazed with one of these alloys,
and the excellent wetting properties of the brazing
are apparent. Only minor reaction with the base ma-
terial is evident. Figure 19.4 shows a higher-magnifica-

tion view of the microstructure of the brazed fillet and
illustrates the heterogeneity of the structure. Tests will -

be run on these joints to determine their compatibility
with bismuth and fluoride salts and their shear strengths
by using Miller-Peaslee-type specimens.

in the Mo-TZM. Weight changes of the specimens were
negligible (<0.03 mg/cm?).

Figure 19.54 shows the typical cold-worked structure

~of the specimens and the capsule before test. This
‘microstructure is also typical of the specimen exposed

to the salt vapor where no microstructural change was
noted. A specimen exposed to the salt shows no attack

result of the test. The capsule wall also recrystallized
in the same manner. It is customary for Mo-TZM to be
annealed 30 min at 1540°C to produce complete re-
crystallization.* An increase in annealing time from
30 min to 1000 hr should not lower the recrystalliza-
tion temperature much over 100°C. However, it is

known that the presence of small concentrations of a
foreign element in solid solution can raise the recrystal-
lization temperature as much as several hundred de-
grees.” Thus the enhanced recrystallization (lower
recrystallization temperature) in the samples and cap-
sule at 1100°C is very likely due to the removal of the
titanium and zirconium from the alloy. This removal
would have the effect of freeing the grains and allowing
them to grow.

 

SR. E. Reed-Hill, Physical Metallurgy Principles, p. 198, Van
Nostrand, Princeton, N.J., 1964.

This experiment has shown that zirconium, titanium,
and chromium are selectively removed from Mo-TZM
during exposure to fluoride salt at 1100°C. This removal
results in a change in the microstructure near the sur-
face, but the mechanical property changes should not
be deleterious.

processing plant), excessive temperature-gradient mass
transfer seriously limits the usefulness of container
systems fabricated from nickel, iron, and chromium
alloys.% This rules out most conventional materials for
long-term service in the processing plant. Relief in this
situation is seen in the refractory alloys, especially
molybdenum, that are much more compatible with

liquid bismuth. The fabrication of these refractory

metals in a large engineering system, however, poses
many problems. A very desirable combination of ma-
terials would be an iron-base alloy for the exterior and a
thin coating or liner of molybdenum on the interior
where it would be exposed to salt and bismuth.

study of the feasibility of exchanging molybdenum

amount of MoF, (gas) to an LiF-BeF, salt and pre-

The CrF, is soluble in the salt, and the molybdenum
should be deposited on the metal wall.

Since molybdenum looks very promising from the
standpoint of compatibility but very discouraging from
a fabricability standpoint, a practical solution to the
materials problem would be available if molybdenum
could be applied to conventional materials in the man-
ner described above. Such a treatment could be ap-
plied to the processing equipment after welding, and
the equipment could be re-treated in place as required.

20.1 REMOTE WELDING DEVELOPMENT
L.C. Williams T.R.Housley R.W. Gunkel

Our efforts on this program have been on a coopera-
tive basis with the Reactor Division and have consisted
of work in two areas: (1) equipment procurement for
general welding studies, and (2) consultation with Reac-
tor Division personnel on actual remote welding appli-
cations. In the first area, we have procured a digital-
controlled automatic welding system and an MIG wire
feeder and controller; purchase orders are out for a
welding head positioner. In the second area of work,
we are providing advice and assistance in the construc-
tion of a remote-controlled orbital carriage welding
head, a device for producing circumferential tungsten-
arc welds in large pipe (see Sect. 7.8).

When the general welding equipment is received and
assembled, we will be in a position to do detailed
welding studies to permit optimum welding process and
parameter selection.

20.2 THERMAL CYCLING TESTS
- ON COATED BEARING SPECIMENS

W.H.Cook L.R. Trotter

The hard-surface coatings are of interest for bearing
and valve applications because they are relatively easy
to apply. Several coatings have been applied to Hastel-
loy N cylinders for evaluation. The thermal cycling
tests have been completed. '

The coatings were applied to the sides of cylinders of
Hastelloy N 1 in. in diameter by 1 in. long. Each cylin-
der had a Y%-in.-diam by % -in.-long handling spindle on
one end. The coatings were surface ground to produce
the best surface obtainable and to make them 3 mils
thick. These surfaces, as measured by Mechanical Tech-
nology Inc. (MTI), were found to have surface rough-
nesses of 0.6 to 9, 1.4 to 2.3, 42 to 125, and 30 to 63
pin. for LW-1, LW-5, MTI, and Metco 81 NS respec-
tively. The NDT fluorescent dye penetrant examina-

tions of them prior to the thermal cycling tests did not
reveal any flaws in the coatings.

A thermal cycle nominally required 20 min to heat up
from 100 to 700°C and 40 min to cool back down to
100°C. The cycling atmosphere was pure argon. An
attempt was made to monitor the sounds during the
cycles in order to determine the moment of failure
during the 100 thermal cycles. This technique showed
some promise, but it requires further development in an
area other than a conventional laboratory area. Six
specimens of each coating were thermal cycled.

The coatings evaluated were (1) Linde LW-5, 25%
tungsten carbide and mixed W-Cr carbides plus 7%
nickel, (2) Linde LW-1, tungsten carbide plus 7-10%
cobalt, (3) Metco 81 NS, 75% chromium carbide plus
25% nickel-chromium alloy, and (4) MTI, 84% tungsten
carbide—10% molybdenum plus 6% cobalt. They sur-
vived 100 thermal cycles between 100 and 700°C in the
order listed. None of the coatings spalled, but all
showed some degree of failure in the fluorescent dye
penetrant examinations made on them for us by the
Nondestructive Testing Group.

One of the six specimens of the Linde LW-5 de-
veloped very fine cracks and some pinholes. This may
be because the coating was inferior andfor was thicker
in the region of failure.

Two of the specimens of the Linde LW-1 developed
pinholes as a result of the thermal cycling. This, I be-
lieve, is the result of lack of quality control in fabrica-
tion. _

The Metco 81 NS and the MTI specimens had heavy
backgrounds in the NDT posttest examinations, which

* suggests a fine network of cracks and/or porosity. This

is probably a reflection of lower bonding strength be-
tween the carbide particles that make up part of these
coatings. :

It is interesting to note that we rated these in the
order of decreasing resistance to the thermal cycling

as Linde LW-5, Linde LW-1, Metco 81 NS, and MTI and

that this parallels their bond strengths at room tempera-
ture: 6330, 6060, 5400, and 4270 psi, respectively, as
determined by MTI.

267

 
 

 

~ We shall examine the microstructures of the coatings

‘to determine the nature and causes of the failures and

to determine if there are hidden failures such as separa-
tion of the coatings from the substrate, Hastelloy N, as
a result of the thermal cycling tests.

The results are encouraging, but much work would
be required to fully evaluate the potential of the coat-
ings that survived the thermal cycling tests without

268

serious damage. For example, for heat-treating work
and design, one should find what upper temperature
will cause the coatings to fail; their corrosion resistance
to molten salts should be determined; and bearing

“tests in molten salts involving boundary lubrication
(rubbing) and hydrodynamic lubrication tests should

be made.

Part 6. Molten-Salt Processing and Preparation
M.E;Whatley

Part 6 deals with the work toward the development of
pfocesses for the isolation of protactinium and the
removal of fission products from molten-salt reactors.
The work is oriented around processing concepts which
are gradually achieving maturity. Protactinium is to be
isolated by a reductive extraction scheme which traps it
in an extraction cascade between thorium, which is less
noble, and uranium, which is more noble. The rare
earths are to be removed by a reductive extraction
operation on a salt stream from which the uranium and
protactinium have already been removed. Our tech-

~ nique for determining the distribution of materials

between molten salt and bismuth as a function of the

reducing power of the bismuth have become ' quite

good, and we can now present reliable distribution
coefficients for all the interesting components including
lithium, thorium, protactinium, plutonium, zirconium,
and uranium. The separation factors for protactinium
continue to look attractive, and those for the rare
earths appear adequate. The major engineering prob-

- lems are associated with the development of an electro-

lytic cell, which is necessary both to provide extractant

and to oxidize the extracted uranium, and liquid-liquid-

contactors which must be effective in this system, We

- have operated small electrolytic cells made of quartz
~ where, under static conditions, current densities of over
4000 amp/ft> were easily achieved. We have yet to’

demonstrate that these cells can be operated at steady

state with flowing fluids and that they can be con-

structed of metal protected by dynamically cast frozen

salt. A system has been installed to study contactors
using salt and bismuth, and it is presently in the early
stages of shakedown operation. Our work with mercury
and water to simulate salt-bismuth systems is progress-
ing well. -

We have found that dissolved nickel in the bismuth

_ phase reduces the solubility of thorium, which in turn

affects the distribution coefficients in the system.
Current versions of our flowsheet now show a bismuth
cleanup operation which removes nickel, tin, a variety
of seminoble fission products, and zirconium at a rate
comparable to a 200-day reactor cycle.

We have gained more detailed information on the
distribution coefficients of the rare earths in the salt
system presently considered for the MSBR. Europium
will be separated from thorium only slightly, but the
rest of the rare earths show separation factors over 1.5.
Our calculations indicate that this is a useful separation
factor if high flow rate ratios can be tolerated. We have
yet to undertake contactor studies at high flow rate
ratios. Our work on alternative processes for rare-earth

separation is still an important part of the program.

The demonstration experiment to distill 48 liters of
MSRE carrier ‘salt is now ready to begin. The prepara-
tion and installation of this experiment were delayed
from various causes, but the experiment can be per-
formed while the reactor is operating and should
establish the feasibility of this important tool in
molten-salt technology.

 
 

 

 

 

21. Flowsheet Analysis

21.1 PROPOSED REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION
PROCESSING FLOWSHEET
FOR A SINGLE-FLUID MSER

M.E.Whatley L.E.McNeese

The process flowsheet envisioned for a single-fluid
MSBR is based on reductive extraction and processes
the reactor salt volume through the protactinium
isolation system on a 3-day cycle and through the
rare-earth removal system on a 30-day cycle. The
present version of the process flowsheet is shown in Fig.
21.1 and is scaled for a 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR.
The protactinium isolation system has been described
earlier.! The rare-earth removal system will be de-
scribed in more detail in a later section. ,

The protactinium isolation system exploits the fact
that protactinium is intermediate in nobility between
uranium and thorium. A moltensalt stream is with-
drawn from the reactor on a 3-day cycle (2.5 gpm) and
fed countercurrent to a 5.3-gpm liquid bismuth stream
in a 12-stage contactor. If the reductant (thorium and
lithium) flow in the bismuth stream entering the
contactor is correct, the uranium in the salt will transfer
to the downflowing bismuth stream in the lower part of
the contactor, The protactinium, however, will concen-
trate midway up the cascade, where most of the
protactinium in the reactor system can be held by
diverting the salt through a suitably large volume (200
ft?). At steady state the 233Pa decays to 233U at the
same rate that it is brought into the tank from the
reactor. Calculated concentration profiles in the extrac-
tion column are discussed in a later section. The
concentrations of both protactinium and uranium in

 the salt leaving the column are negligible; however, the

concentration of rare earths at this point is roughly the
same as in the reactor. Approximately 10% (0.25 gpm)
of the salt stream leaving the protactinium isolation

The remaining salt passes through an electrolytic
oxidizer-reducer where lithium and thorium are reduced
into a flowing bismuth cathode to provide the metal
stream fed to the column. At the anode of the cell,
bismuth is oxidized to BiF,;, which will be soluble in
the molten salt, The salt stream, containing BiF,, is
countercurrently contacted with the bismuth stream
leaving the extraction column in order to oxidize
uranium, protactinium, and other materials, which then
transfer to the salt stream and return to the regctor.

The concentration of uranium or protactinium must
be known at a point in the column in order to control
the reductant concentration in the bismuth stream fed
to the column. The uranium concentration is deter-
mined by fluorinating approximately 5% of the salt
entering the protactinium decay tank and analyzing the
resulting gas stream for UF4. Means for collecting the
UF; from this operation as well as from other
fluorination operations and for returning this material
to the fuel salt are provided. The UF¢ is simultaneously
absorbed into the molten salt and reduced to UF, by a
hydrogen sparge. A bismuth removal step will also be
provided before salt returns to the reactor.

Approximately 1.5% (0.08 gpm) of the bismuth
stream leaving the extraction column will be hydro-
fluorinated in the presence of a salt stream for removal
of the seminoble metals (Ga, Ge, Cd, In, Sn, and Sb),
corrosion products (Fe, Ni, and Cr), and fission product
Zr. The salt is recycled between the hydrofluorinator
and a fluorinator, where uranium is removed. The
principal components which build up in this salt are
TLiF and ZrF,, and the expected steady-state composi-
tion is 47-53 mole % LiF-ZrF4, which has a liquidus of
520°C.

Salt which is free of uranium and protactinium but
which contains rare earths is fed to the center of a

. 24-stage extraction column at a rate of about 0.25 gpm,

sufficient to process a reactor volume in 30 days. The
salt flows countercurrent to a bismuth stream contain-
ing thorium and lithium, Typically, 60% of the rare
earths are extracted from the salt stream in the upper

column (making the effective removal time 50 days),
and the rare-earth concentration is increased to approxi-
mately 0.69 mole % in the lower column. The bismuth
flow rate through the column is 15 gpm. Part of the salt
leaving the column returns to the reactor, and the
remaining salt is fed to the electrolytic cell complex,
the net effect of which is to put thorium and lithium
into bismuth and to turn the extracted rare earths
around as reflux from the bismuth phase to the
returning salt. Both anode and cathode are flowing
streams of bismuth. A Bi-Li stream generated at the
cathode of the cell is fed to the 3-stage contactor,
which effectively removes the ThF, from the incoming
salt. The salt then picks up BiF; as it passes the anode.
The salt stream containing BiF; is passed counter-
current to the bismuth stream entering the complex
from the rare-earth removal column to oxidize the rare
earths, thorium, and lithium from the bismuth.

Salt containing rare earths at a concentration of 0.69
mole % is withdrawn from the system at a rate of 0.49
ft? /day. The active-metal fission products (Sr, Cs, Ba,
Rb, and Eu) are also present in the stream at a
concentration equal to that in the reactor and are
removed on a 3000-day cycle. Salt withdrawal is
through a set of tanks used sequentially and each having
a volume of about 40 ft®. This limits the rate at which
rare earths could inadvertently return to the reactor.
This salt will be fluorinated for uranium recovery when
necessary.

21.2 PROTACTINIUM REMOVAL
FROM A SINGLE-FLUID MSBR

| L. E. McNeese

A method for isolating protactinium from a single-
fluid MSBR has been described earlier.? Steady-state
concentration profiles in the isolation column at the
optimum operating conditions have been recalculated
using current data on reduction potentials and thorium
solubility. For the calculations, assumed values were: a
fuel salt composition of 71.7-16-12-0.3 mole % LiF-
BeF,-ThF,-UF,, a reactor volume of 1461 ft*, a
processing rate of 2.5 gpm (three-day cycle), an
operating temperature of 600°C, a reactor power of
1000 Mw (electrical), and a protactinium decay tank
volume of 200 ft3. The thorium and lithium concentra-
tions in the bismuth stream fed to the column were
0.0016 and 1.4 X 10™ mole fraction respectively.

A typical calculated profile is shown in Fig. 21.2. The
uranium concentration in the salt decreases from the
inlet value of 0.003 mole fraction to negligible values at
the salt outlet. The concentration of protactinium in
the salt increases from the inlet value of 1.39 X 1075
mole fraction to a maximum of 0.002 mole fraction,
after which it drops to negligible values near the salt

~ outlet. The concentration of thorium in the bismuth

stream drops from about 0.00132 mole fraction in the
upper part of the column to 2 X 1077 mole fraction
near the bismuth outlet. The concentration of lithium
in the bismuth decreases from about 0.00127 mole
fraction in the upper part of the column to about
0.000142 mole fraction at the bottom of the column.

The concentrations of uranium and protactinium in
the salt entering the decay tank are 3.69 X 107¢ and
1.326 X 1072 mole fraction respectively. The concen-
trations of uranium and protactinium in the decay tank

respectively. Under ideal steady-state operating condi-
tions, approximately 93% of the protactinium present
in the reactor system would be held in the decay tank.
It is likely that the actual amount of protactinium
isolated from the reactor will be somewhat below this
value, however, because of inability to maintain opti-
mum operating conditions.

21.3 REMOVAL OF RARE EARTHS
FROM A SINGLE-FLUID MSBR
L. E. McNeese

The rare-earth fission products are among the more
important neutron absorbers in an MSBR, and opera-
tion of this system requires removal of these materials

~on a cycle of approximately 50 days. Removal of rare

earths from a single-fluid MSBR is complicated by the
need for separating the rare earths from thorium, which
is a major component of the salt. i

The proposed method for rare-earth removal is based
on differences in the extent to which the rare earths
and thorium distribute between molten salt and liquid
bismuth containing a reductant. The removal system is
shown in its simplest form in Fig. 21.3. A molten-salt
stream consisting of fluorides of lithium, beryllium, and
thorium and which also contains rare-earth fluorides is

fed to the center of an extraction column. The salt
flows countercurrent to a stream of liquid bismuth
containing thorium and lithium. In the upper part of
the column, a large fraction of the rare earths is reduced
and transfers to the downflowing metal stream. Below
the feed point, the concentration of rare earths is
increased in the salt and metal streams in order to
produce a concentration suitably high for disposal.

Molten salt leaving the top of the column contains
rare earths at a low concentration. Part of this salt is
returned to the reactor, and the rest is sent to an
electrolytic cell complex, the net effect of which is to
put thorium and lithium into bismuth for use as
extractant and to return the extracted rare earths,
entering the complex with bismuth from the bottom of
the cascade, to the cascade as reflux, oxidizing them
out of the bismuth and moving them to the returning
salt stream. The complex consists of an electrolysis cell
with contactors above and below it. Both the anode and
the cathode of the cell are pools of flowing bismuth,
and the electrolyte is salt containing neither larger
amounts of rare earths nor thorium. The cathode puts
lithium into the bismuth stream which flows into the
lower contactor, extracting essentially all (about 99%)
of the thorium out of the entering salt. The anode puts
BiF; into the salt which flows into the upper contactor
and oxidizes essentially all of the rare earths out of the
entering bismuth.

Rare-earth removal efficiencies were calculated for a
range of operating conditions to establish the impor-
tance of number of stages, separation factor, metal-to-
salt flow ratio, rare-earth concentration in the discard
stream, location of the feed point, and the fraction of
ThF,; which is reduced in the electrolytic cell. Assumed
operating conditions included a reactor volume of 1461
ft*, a salt processing rate of 0.25 gpm (30-day cycle),
an operating temperature of 600°C, and a reactor
power of 1000 Mw (electrical). The thorium and
lithium concentrations in the bismuth stream fed to the
extraction column were both 0.0016 mole fraction.

It was found that the optimum feed location was at
the center of the column for most operating conditions, -
and all results to be presented are based on this feed

location. System performance is shown in Fig. 21.4 for

a 24-stage column for a range of metal-to-salt flow
ratios and for rare-earth—thorium separation factors
which range from 1.2 to 6. The fraction of the ThF,
which is reduced in the electrolytic cell is 99%. It
should be noted that for the assumed operating

" conditions the metal-to-salt flow ratio in the lower part

of the column is only dependent on the fraction of
ThF, reduced and is 85.4 for the present case. For the
assumed operating conditions, a bismuth flow rate of

BISMUTH FLOW RATE (gpm)

Column.

15 gpm will result in a rare-earth removal efficiency of
69% (44-day removal time) for a separation factor of 2
and a removal efficiency of 31% (95-day removal time)
for a separation factor of 1.5. The metal-to-salt flow
ratio in the upper column is about 34 for this bismuth
flow rate.

System performance is shown in Fig. 21.5 for the
same operating conditions except that a 12-stage
extraction column is used. A bismuth flow rate of
about 23 gpm is required for roughly the same removal
efficiency for a separation factor of 2.

The effect of fraction of ThF,; reduced in the
electrolytic cell is shown in Fig. 21.6 for a separation
factor of 2 with a 24-stage column and a rare-earth
concentration in the withdrawal stream of 0.0069 mole
fraction. It should be noted that this parameter is equal
if not greater in importance than the other parameters
considered. A significant decrease in removal efficiency
results from the fraction of ThF, reduced being
decreased from 99 to 90%, and the system becomes
ineffective if less than 50% of the ThF, is reduced.
There is essentially no effect of the rare-earth concen-
tration in the withdrawal stream on removal efficiency
in the range of interest.

The separation factors for several of the rare earths

have been determined for bismuth saturated with

thorium in contact with 72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-
ThF4. The separation factors® are 1.3 for Eu, 1.7 for

 

3Fig. 21.6, this report.

274

Pm, 1.8 for La, 2.0 for Sm, 3.0 for Nd, and 3.5 for Ce.
The removal times for these materials at the reference
conditions (24 total stages and 15 gpm Bi) are given in
Table 21.1. The removal times range from about 225
days for europium to approximately 30 days for
neodymium and cerium and are considered adequate.
The rare earth which will set the operating conditions
for the removal system is promethium (which has a
separation factor of 1.7), since it is one of the more

~ important rare earths. Lanthanum is less important, and

the resulting removal time (~100 days) is satisfactory.
The removal times for rare earths having separation
factors greater than 2, such as neodymium and cerium,
will be shorter than required.

21.4 MATERIAL BALANCE CALCULATIONS
M.J.Bell L.E.McNeese

A computer code has been developed to perform
steady-state material balance calculations which: de-
scribe in detail the nuclear, chemical, and physical
processes taking place in the fuel stream of an MSBR.

Such - calculations are necessary to determine fission

product inventories and heat generation rates, to
specify flow rates of streams in the chemical processing
plant, and to investigate the effects of changes in
chemical processing on the nuclear performance of the
MSBR. The code also takes into account the buildup of
transuranium isotopes, the production of activation
products by neutron capture in the carrier salt, and
chain branching in the fission product decay schemes
not included in earlier investigations.® .

21.4.1 MSBR Nuclear Data Compilation

In order to perform these calculations, a library of
nuclear data for MSBR applications has been compiled.

‘This library contains half-lives and radioactive decay

schemes, three-group neutron capture cross sections,
and beta and gross gamma disintegration energies for
687 nuclides. Of these, 178 are_isotopes of elements
which comprise the carrier salt, graphite, and structural
materials and their activation products, 461 are fission
products and their daughters, and 48 are isotopes of the
actinide elements and their daughters. The radioactive
decay schemes include beta and positron emission to

isomeric states and ground states of daughter nuclides, _

alpha emission, and isomeric transition. These decay

‘schemes are based primarily on the compilation of

Lederer et a4l The three-group cross-section library

consists of a thermal cross section, a resonance integral,
and a fast cross section which was generated by
averaging a cross section over an MSR spectrum given
by Prince for E > 1 Mev.5:7 Where possible, the

- thermal cross sections and resonance integrals have been

corrected for non-1/v behavior, also using the data of
Prince.®+7 In addition to total neutron absorption cross
section, the library also contains, for each group, the
fraction of neutron captures which lead to fission and
n-y, n-o, n-p, and n-2n reactions. These data are based
primarily on the compilations of Stehn er al® and
Drake.? The fission product library includes a compila-
tion of direct fission yields from five fissile species,
233y, 235y, 238y, 232Th, and 23°Pu, based on the
data of Katcoff.!® The beta plus gamma disintegration
energies were calculated using the computer code
SPECTRA written by E. D. Arnold to compute the
average energy of a beta particle by integration of the
Fermi beta-ray spectrum taking into account changes in
spin and parity.!! A computer code has been written
which reads the data in this nuclear library from cards
and prepares an array of transition coefficients to be
used in the material balance calculations to be described
below.

21.4.2 MSBR Materia! Balance Calculations

For many purposes it is adequate to consider the
recirculating fuel salt in a proposed MSBR to be a
well-mixed fluid at steady state in which the average
concentration of a nuclide i is given by the equation

fission must equal the rate of loss of species i by

radioactive decay, neutron capture, flow out of the |

system, and chemical processing. In addition to the
terms given in Eq. (1) the code also provides for loss of
isotopes of xenon and krypton by diffusion into the
graphite moderator followed by neutron capture or
radioactive decay, and production of isotopes of xenon
and krypton in the fuel salt by migration of gaseous
neutron capture products out of the graphite, using a
model developed by Kedl and Houtzeel.!? Provision is
also made in the code for migration of noble gases and
noble metals to recirculating bubbles in the fuel salt.! 3
The bubbles are treated as a separate well-mixed region
of fixed residence time in which radioactive decay may
take place. Daughters which are not themselves noble
gases or noble metals are assumed to return to the fuel
salt.

The volume-averaged thermal flux and the ratio of
the resonance flux per unit lethargy to the thermal flux,
which are required to compute the spectrum-average
cross sections for use in Eq. (1), are obtained from the
output of the ROD reactor design code for a given
reactor configuration and fuel processing scheme.!*
The ROD code is a multiregion, six-group neutron
diffusion code used for the primary design and evalua-
tion calculations for the MSBR. For these conditions
Eq. (1) is a coupled system of N linear algebraic
equations in V unknowns of the form

N -
0"—"2 aika+b,-,i=1,2,...,N. (2)
k=1

The steady-state code which has been developed to
solve the system of equations (2) employs the Gauss-
Seidel ‘interaction technique, a well-known numerical
method which can be shown to converge provided the
coefficients a;; fulfill certain restrictions.!

The code requires as input the fuel salt volume, core
volume, graphite volume, removal times of the elements
by chemical processing, and solubility and mass transfer
coefficients for migration of the noble gases to the
graphite in addition to the nuclear library and the
three-group weighting factors for the reactor spectrum
described above. The code gives as output the composi-
tion of the fuel stream in gram-moles per cubic
‘centimeter and mole fraction of each isotope, the
neutron poisoning, and the beta and gamma specific
power for each nuclide in watts per cubic centimeter.
The code also gives the flow rates, in grams per day, the
compositions, and the power of the various streams of
fission products leaving the primary fuel-salt loop.

A synthesis of this material balance code with a
version of the ROD reactor design code has been
developed in order that calculations can be performed
for a given reactor configuration over a range of
processing conditions. This combined code uses ROD to
determine the absorption rates in thorium and uranium
for an assumed lumped fission product poisoning. The
converged absorption rates for the actinide elements
from ROD are then used by the material balance code,
which computes inventories and poisoning for the
individual fission product nuclides and calculates a new
lumped fission product poisoning which is then used by
ROD. This process is repeated until the lumped fission

cycle. Plating out of the noble metals on surfaces was
not treated as a separate removal mechanism; that is, all
noble metals removed from the fuel salt were assumed
to be present in the stream resulting from stripping the
gas space on a 110-sec cycle. A 200-day removal time
was assumed for zirconium and the seminoble metals
(Ga, Ge, Cd, In, Sn, and Sb).

The rare-earth fission products with the exception of
europium were removed on a 50-day cycle; europium
was removed on a 225-day cycle. The active metals (Rb,
Cs, Sr, and Ba) were removed by salt discard on a
3000-day cycle. The halogens (I and Br) will be
removed from the salt during fluorination on a 50-day
cycle.

Table 21.2 gives the processing cycle times, flow

rates, and heat generation rates of the principal groups

of fission products being withdrawn from the primary-
salt loop of the MSBR. It is seen that these streams
contain about 1.5% of the reactor power and that 90%
of this power is generated in the noble gas and noble
metal streams. Table 21.3 gives the chemical composi-
tion of these streams of fission products, and the most

important fission product poisons are listed in Table

21.4. Studies are now being performed which will give
additional information on the effect of chemical pro-
cessing rates on the nuclear performance of the MSBR.

22. Measurement of Distribution Coefﬁments in
- Molten-Salt-Metal Systems

L. M. Ferris

During this reporting period, chemical development
of the reductive extraction method!™® for the process-
ing of single-fluid MSBR fuels was continued. The
experimental work consisted mainly in the measure-
ment of the equilibrium distribution of uranium,
zirconium, protactinium, plutonium, and rare earths
between LiF-BeF,-Th¥, solutions and liquid bismuth
solutions; the effect of nickel on the solubility of
thorium in bismuth was also studied. The distribution

22.1 EXTRACTION OF URANIUM, ZIRCONIUM,
- PROTACTINIUM, AND PLUTONIUM
FROM SINGLE-FLUID MSBR FUELS

J.C.Mailen F.J.Smith
- J.F.Land

~ The equilibrium distribution of uranium, zirconium,
protactinium, and plutonium between several typical
LiF-BeF;-ThF,; single-fluid MSBR fuel salts and liquid
bismuth solutions has been measured. The behavior of
these elements is of primary interest in the protactin-
ium isolation portion of the reference reductive extrac-
tion flowsheet.® Prior studies®® utilizing LiF-BeF;-
ThF, (69.2-19.4-11.4 mole %) as the salt phase
established that the extractability of protactinium was
between that of uranium and thorium and that the

- respective separation factors were high enough to allow

isolation of the protactinium. Extraction of zirconium
(a major fission product) from LiF-BeF,-ThF, salts has
received little, if any, attention. Preliminary work® with
LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) indicated that zirconium
would behave like a rare-earth fission product. Data
obtained in the present study using LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) show that this is not the case. The -
possibility of using plutonium as a fuel in an MSBR
(particularly during startup) has often been con-
sidered;® consequently its behavior in a reductive
extraction process required study.

All experiments involving zirconium, and some of
those with uranium, were conducted in mild steel

apparatus using the procedure described previously.??
The other experiments were conducted in a system in
which the components that contacted the salt and
bismuth (crucible, sparge tube, thermowell) were all
fabricated of molybdenum. Use of molybdenum
allowed simultaneous HF-H, treatment of the salt and
bismuth, making it possible to conduct several experi-
ments in sequence in the same apparatus using only one
initial charge of protactinium. In a typical experiment,
100 to 150 g of salt and about 200 g of bismuth were
loaded into the molybdenum crucible. A few milligrams
of 221Pa contained in hydrofluoric acid solution was
evaporated onto about 1 g of LiF and added to the
system along with any uranium or plutonium desired.
In several experiments in which uranium was present,
the 233U isotope was used to facilitate accurate
analysis. The salt and bismuth were sparged first with
50% HF-50% H, for about 24 hr to remove oxide
impurities and then for 3 to 4 hr with pure hydrogen to
reduce noble-metal fluorides (Ni, Bi, Mo, etc.). The two
phases were then sparged with purified argon to remove
all residual hydrogen. Extraction of the various com-
ponents (U, Pa, Pu, etc.) from the salt into the bismuth
was effected by the incremental addition of crystal-bar
thorium to the system. The first piece of thorium added
usually had been irradiated to contain about 1 mc of
233p,; the presence of the 233Pa tracer in the system
allowed immediate gamma counting of the samples,
giving a rapid indication of the progress of the

experiment. Filtered samples of each phase were taken

at least 4 hr after each addition of thorium. Analyses of
these samples provided the data necessary for the
calculation of the distribution coefficients. In each
experiment the system was equilibrated under an argon
atmosphere. The argon was purified by passage through
two traps filled with uranium turnings; the first trap
was held at about 625°C and the second at 200 to
300°C.

In most of the previous studies?3+%:7 the valence of
the uranium species in the salt phase during extraction
was taken to be 4. Thermodynamic considerations®*®
using data for LiF-BeF, systems indicate that at 600°C

the valence of the uranium should be very close to 3
when the lithium concentration in the bismuth phase is
greater than about 2 wt ppm (0.006 at. %). The results
of our recent experiments using refined analytical
methods show that this is generally true for uranium in
LiF-BeF, -ThF, solutions at 600°C. This is illustrated
by the plot of log Dy; vs log Dy, shown in Fig. 22.1;
these data were obtained in two separate experiments at
600°C using LiF-BeF,-ThF,4 (72-16-12 mole %). The

- line has a slope of 3. Similar data were obtained in
 experiments with other salt compositions. Further

evidence for the trivalency of uranium in the salt phase

- is provided by plots of log Dy; vs either log D, or log

Dp,. Uranium and zirconium data from two experi-
ments at 600°C using LiF-BeF;-ThF, (72-16-12 mole
%) are shown in Fig. 22.2. The slope of this plot of log
Dy, vs log Dy is 1.33, as would be expected if the
uranium existed as a trivalent species in the salt. More

importantly, these data show that uranium and zirco-
nium will behave almost identically in the proposed
reductive extraction process. Undoubtedly, special
provision will have to be made to remove zirconium
from the system at one point in the process.

The results of previous studies® indicated that prot-
actinium existed as a tetravalent species in the salt
phase in a reductive extraction system. Additional
experimentation has verified this conclusion. This is
illustrated by the plots of log Dp, vs log Dy and log
Dy, shown in Fig. 22.3, These data were obtained with
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) at 600°C. The slope
of the Pa-Th line is 1, as expected from two tetravalent
species; the slope of the Pa-U plot is 1.33, which is
consistent with the presence of tetravalent protactinium
and trivalent uranium in the salt phase. Plutonium was
expected to be trivalent in these systems. This expecta-
tion was confirmed, as illustrated by the plots of log

- Dp, and log Dy, vs log Dp, shown in Fig. 22.4; the

slope of each line is 1.33. |

Most of the distribution coefficient data obtained so
far for uranium, protactinium, zirconium, plutonium,
and thorium are compiled in Table 21.1 in the equation
form: log D = n log C; + log I. The data were not
analyzed statistically; the equations were obtained by
visually fitting what appeared to be the best line
through the experimental data. Close inspection of

these equations reveals that the distribution coefficients
vary as the composition of the salt is changed. The
difference in Pa-Th behavior is most noticeable; for
example, with the salts containing about 12 mole %
ThF,, the Pa-Th separation factor increased from about
2100 to 4400 as the “free fluoride” equivalence? of the
salt increased from —4 to +13 (see also Fig. 22.6; Sect.
22.3). “Free fluoride™ equivalence (FF) is defined by

FF = LiF (mole %)
— 2BeF, (mole %) — 3ThF, (mole %) .

The fact that the Pa-Th separation factors obtained
with LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and LiF-ThF, (73-27
mole %) do not correlate with those obtained with salts
containing about 12 mole % ThF, emphasizes that the -
“free fluoride” model is far from -ideal. The U-Pu
separation factor was about 10 in the two systems in
which plutonium was present. Both the U-Pa and Pu-Pa
separation factors are variable since the valences of the

species are different. When the bismuth phase was
saturated with thorium (D, = 0.0145 for salts in
which the ThF4 concentration is 12 mole %), the U-Pa
separation factor was about 15 to 20 regardless of the
salt composition, These data show that, for MSBR fuel
salts containing about 12 mole % ThF,, separation of
uranium from protactinium should be relatively easy,
especially if the reductant concentration in the metal
phase is kept low. The Pu-Pa separation is not so easy,
but separation factors greater than 10 can probably be
achieved by maintaining a very low reductant concen-
tration in the metal phase.

In several experiments, distribution coefficients for
the various components were determined as a function
of temperature under conditions where the metal phase
was saturated with thorium. The effect of temperature
on the metal-thorium separation factors obtained with
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) is shown in Fig.
22.5. As seen, these separation factors increase regularly
with decreasing temperature.

222 SOLUBILITY OF PROTACTINIUM
IN BISMUTH

J.C.Mailen F.J. Smith

" In the last semiannual report,®> we gave preliminary
results for an experiment (PE7) that was designed to
demonstrate that protactinium was sufficiently soluble
in bismuth solutions . for the reductive extraction
process to be practicable. Complete results are now
available for this experiment and are presented in Table
22.2. During the present reporting period, we found
that the original thorium analyses of the metal phase
were in error and, because of the loss of the samples,
could not be corrected. Also, distribution coefficients
for protactinium and thorium were determined with
LiF-BeF; (66-34 mole %), the same salt used in

experiment PE7. The thorium concentrations in the‘ ‘
metal phase given in Table 22.2 were calculated using

the measured equilibrium data (Table 22.1; Sect. 22.1),
the protactinium distribution coefficients obtained in
experiment PE7, and the thorium analyses of the salt
samples taken in experiment PE7. These corrected
results show that one objective of experiment PE7, the.
demonstration of the mutual solubility of protactinium
and thorium at the 1000-ppm level, was not met. Since
thorium and lithium were present in amounts much less
than originally thought, the reported number of 1200

ppm is probably very close to the true solubility of
protactinium in bismuth at 500°C., Furthermore, the
original conclusion that the solubility of protactinium
in bismuth is high enough for process application is still
valid. .

Toward the end of experiment PE7, sufficient UF,
was added to the system to effect oxidation of some of
the protactinium from the metal phase. Under the
equilibrium condition established, the metal phase
contained about 668 ppm Pa and 1090 ppm U, with
corresponding uranium and protactinium material
balances of nearly 100%. Thus the mutual solubility of
uranium and protactinium in bismuth appears to be

high.

22.3 EXTRACTION OF THORIUM AND RARE
- EARTHS FROM SINGLE-FLUID MSER FUELS

L.M. Ferris J. J. Lawrance
J.F.Land

Distribution coefficients for thorium and several rare
earths have been measured at 600 to 700°C using a
variety of LiF-BeF,-ThF4 solutions in which the ThF,
concentration was about 12 mole %. The experimental
procedure used was described in a previous report.? In
each experiment the bismuth phase could be saturated
with thorium without changing the composition of the
salt detectably. The highest distribution coefficients for
the respective components in the system are attained

when the metal phase is saturated with thorium. This
condition provides a convenient reference point for the
correlation of the data. Following the convention used
previously,? distribution coefficients obtained when the
metal phase is saturated with thorium are designated at
D™23X " and the rare-earth—thorium separation factors
(D g/Dyy,) determined at D™ are denoted by a*.

The data obtained so far are given in Table 22.3, As
illustrated in Fig. 22.6 the data correlate well with the
calculated “free fluoride” equivalence of the salt.

The rare-earth—thorium separation factors generally
were in the range of 1 to 3.5 over the range of
conditions investigated. Increasing the temperature
from 600 to 700°C usually produced a small decrease in
the separation factor; this is consistent with the earlier
observation® that temperature had very little effect on
o*. The results obtained in this study are in good
agreement with those obtained by other workers."©

It is interesting to note that the average values of
DX obtained at 600 and 700°C correspond to
thorium concentrations in the bismuth of about 1850
and 5600 wt ppm respectively. These values are in
excellent agreement with those obtained by direct
measurement of the solubility of thorium in bismuth.?

 

between the respective salts and the metal phase must
be satisfied. Differences in the chemical activities of the
various species in the two salts provide the driving force -
for the transfer of a given component, starting with
nogequilibrium conditions. Ideally, the equilibria would
favor transfer of a large fraction of the rare earths to
the . acceptor salt, with little attendant transfer of
thorium.

Experimentally this technique was tested using an

- apparatus similar to that shown schematically in Fig.

22.7. The LiF-BeF,-ThF, donor salt, which initially
contained the rare earth, was separated from the
acceptor salt by a thorium-saturated bismuth phase. In
each experiment the number of moles of donor salt was
equal to the number of moles of acceptor salt. The
equilibrium distribution of thorium, lithium, and the
rare earth among the three phases was then determined
at about 600°C. (Beryllium and the anionic species do
not transfer in these systems.) In each system tested,
equilibium was reached in less than 48 hr without
agitation of any of the phases. The desired equilibrium
conditions are those where (1) a large fraction of the
rare earth is present in the acceptor salt and (2) the
thorium decontamination factor (DF),

_(mole fraction RE in acceptor)/(mole fraction Th in acceptor)

 

DFrp =

 

Although the rare-earth—thorium separation factors
increased slightly with increasing “free fluoride™ equiv-
alence of the salt, no significant enhancement of the
separation factors over those obtained with the refer-
ence camier salt, LiF-BeF,;-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %),
appears to be possible by changing the salt composition.

22.4 METAL TRANSFER PROCESS STUDIES

F.J.Smith  J.J.Lawrance
C.T. Thompson

Because the rare-earth—thorium separation factors
attainable by reductive extraction are somewhat lower
than desired, alternative methods for effecting this
separation are being sought. One possibility is the
selective transfer of the rare earths from the LiF-BeF,-
ThF, donor salt through a liquid metal phase to an
acceptor salt. All oxidation-reduction equilibria

salts used fulfilled both of the desired criteria. Signifi-
cant transfer of the trivalent rare earth lanthanum was
achieved using LiCI-LiF solutions as the acceptor;
however, the thorium decontamination factor was only
in the range of 10 to 20. Other studies'! with pure LiCl
indicate that high thorium decontamination factors
could be achieved but that only a small fraction of a
trivalent rare earth such as lanthanum or neodymium
would be transferred. The search for an acceptor salt
that provides the desired results is continuing.

22.5 EFFECT OF OTHER COMPONENTS
ON THE SOLUBILITY OF THORIUM
IN BISMUTH '

F.J.Smith J.F.Land
C.T. Thompson

- Throughout our studies we have been cohstantly alert

to solute interactions in the bismuth phase that could
decrease the solubility of thorium and/or result in the
formation of an insoluble intermetaltic phase. The data
obtained in this program show that the thorium
solubility at 600°C (about 2000 wt ppm) is not
affected by the presence of uranium and zirconium at
concentrations of 2000 ppm, either singly or in
combination, Similar results were obtained with ura-
nium, plutonium, and thorium; solutions containing
about 2000 ppm thorium and at least 2000 ppm
uranium and plutonium have been produced. Lithium
and lanthanum, in concentrations up to about 1000
ppm, had no detectable effect on the thorium solu-
bility. Nickel was the only element encountered in this
work that had a marked effect. | o

The effect of nickel on the solubility of thorium in
bismuth at 600°C was investigated in two experiments.

The system was contained under an argon atmosphere

in a mild steel crucible in experiment 5639 and in a

molybdenum crucible in experiment LA-1. Initially,
- sufficient crystal-bar thorium was added to just saturate

the bismuth at 600°C; lanthanum, at a concentration of
about 1000 ppm, was also present in experiment LA-1.
Then, small portions of nickel were added to the
systems. After each addition, at least 4 hr was allowed

for the attainment of equilibrium before a filtered -

sample of the liquid phase was taken for analysis. The
results are shown in Fig. 22.8. The solid circles were

obtained in experiment 5639 by back titration with-

crystal-bar thorium. The data from these experiments
can be expressed as a mole fraction solubility product,

Kyp=XppXyN;=62X 1077,

over the range of concentrations investigated. This is
the type of behavior expected if the Th/Ni atom ratio
in the solid phase were 1. This appeared to be the case;

‘by material balance calculations, the Th/Ni atom ratio

in the solid phase was 0.90 to 0.99 throughout each
experiment, No attempt was made to isolate and
identify the solid phase. It could be ThNi (which would
not be inconsistent with the reported'? Th-Ni phase
diagram), or it could be a ternary bismuthide, ThNiBi, .
The data indicate that a bismuth solution saturated
with thorium at 600°C could accommodate up to about
100 ppm nickel before precipitation of a thorium- and
nickel-containing solid would occur. It was also of
interest to note that the lanthanum concentration in
the liquid phase remained unchanged, even when the
nickel concentration was 5000 ppm.

23. Engineering Development of Process Operations

L.E. McNeese

23.1 ELECTROLYTIC CELL DEVELOPMENT
M.S.Lin L. E.McNeese

Electrolytic cells will be required for operation of

reductive extraction systems in an MSBR fuel process-
ing plant. The cell will be used to oxidize uranium or
other materials in bismuth streams effluent from ex-
traction contactors as well as for reducing lithium and
thorium into flowing bismuth streams to prepare feed
for the contactors. The concentrations of materials
to be oxidized from the bismuth at the anode are low,
so the current density would be limited by the rate at
which these materials could be transported to the anode
surface. The diffusion-limited current density for oxida-
tion of uranium from bismuth at a uranium concentra-
tion of 0.0016 mole fraction was estimated to be 0.15
amp/cm? (based on uranium diffusivity in bismuth of
2.5 X 107° cm?*/sec,! diffusion layer thickness of 5 X
107 cm, and bismuth volume of 21.3 cc/g-atom). A
current density this low would require an anode area of
21.7 ft? for the protactinium isolation system, an area
much larger than desired. The area is decreased con-
siderably by oxidizing bismuth, the major component
present in the anode. Although this produces a corro-
sive material, BiF;, it is more desirable than using very
large anode areas. The BiF; dissolves in the molten
fluoride electrolyte, which is countercurrently con-
tacted with the bismuth stream containing metals to be
oxidized. The overall reaction thus is still the oxidation
of materials from the metal stream.
" To date, two series of experiments have been carried
out in two static cells made of quartz. ‘Another static
cell made entirely of metal was also recently installed.
Results of experiments with these cells will be dis-
cussed.

23.1.1 Quartz Static Cell Experiments

The quartz cell, shown in Fig. 23.1, consists of a flat-
bottomed quartz tube (4 in. OD) with metal flanges.
The bottom of the cell contains a quartz divider, which
results in two compartments equal in size and about 3
in, deep. The compartments were filled with bismuth to
within about % in. of the top of the divider to produce
the electrodes with an exposed area of about 30 cm? |
each. A 3.5-in. layer of molten salt (66-34 mole %
LiF-BeF,;) covered the electrodes and served as the

. electrolyte. Two molybdenum tubes contained within

quartz sleeves were introduced from the top of the
vessel through the molten salt and terminated near the
bottom of the electrode compartments to serve as the
electrode leads as well as gas sparge lines. Means for
obtaining filtered samples of salt or bismuth were pro-
vided.

Prior to each series of expenments the bismuth was
sparged with hydrogen at 700°C for about 16 hr. About
1.8 kg of molten salt which had been previously puri-
fied by hydrofluorination, hydrogen reduction, and
filtration was then introduced into the cell. Viewing
slits were provided in the furnace to allow observation
of the salt-bismuth interface in the vicinity of the
quartz divider. Prior to transfer of molten salt to the
cell, the bismuth surfaces were shiny, although a small
amount of surface film on the bismuth was noted. After
transfer of salt to the cell, the salt was colorless and
quite transparent. A flow of argon cover gas was main-
tained through the gas space above the salt, and a slight
positive pressure was maintained in order to prevent air
inleakage, The quartz cell is shown after installation in

‘Fig. 23.2. A 0 to 12 v dc power supply was used which

had a maximum output of 250 amp. Both the cell cur-
rent and the potential difference between the elec-
trodes were recorded continuously.

During both series of experiments the voltage applied
across the electrodes was increased incrementally from

an initial value of 2.6 v in steps of about 0.6 v, and
operation of the cell was observed. No gas sparging of
the salt or the bismuth electrodes was used during the
first series of experiments, but the cathode was sparged
with argon during most of the second series of experi-
ments, as will be discussed. The results can be sum-
marized as follows: '_

1. The initial potential difference between the bis-
muth electrodes was <0.05 v (below recorder sensi-
tivity). The cell potential increased rapidly to 2 v after
passage of 60 coulombs in 10 sec, to 2.1 v after 625
coulombs in 125 sec,and to 2.25 v after 9300 coulombs
in 61 min. The cell potential remained at about 2.2 v
thereafter. The potential was lowered by mixing the
cathode by argon sparging; however, Spargmg the anode
produced no change in cell potential.

2. The current-vs-voltage plot of the experiments (Fig.
23.3) suggests that there is essentially no limiting cur-
rent in the range covered by the experiments. The slight
decrease in cell resistance shown in one of the curves

was due to the increase in cell temperature and is con-

sistent with values calculated from the published equa-
tion? for specific conductivity of molten 2LiF-BeF, as
a function of temperature. The highest current density
obtained was 4.5 amp/cm? (4180 amp/ft?). Higher cur-
rent densities would be expected as the applied potential
is increased.

3. During both series of runs, formation of very finely
divided dark material was noted at the anode. The ma-
terial was observed to spread slowly throughout the salt
during the first 10 min of operation with the first cell.
Circulation of the salt during this period was slight and
resulted from thermal convection. Although the salt re-
mained opaque during the remaining cell operation, the
salt was transparent after the ceil had stood overnight,
and only a small amount of dark material was noted at
the salt-bismuth interface. During operation of the
second cell, the salt immediately above the anode ap-
peared light brown after 10 sec of cell operation (60
coulombs passed). At this point the anode and the salt

above it were stirred by an argon sparge; this resulted in

dispersion of the material above the anode throughout-

the salt, which then appeared light brown. The forma-
tion of black material at the anode continued for an

‘additional 125 sec (625 additional coulombs). After

standing overnight the salt was clear, with a small
amount of black material in it. No further formation

trodes) did the Kl-starch solution (through which the
cell off-gas passed) become lightly tinted.

6. The bismuth concentrations in the salt (probably
BiF,) increased with the number of coulombs passed
through the cell, although the concentration was only
10 to 50% of that which would result if only BiF; were
produced and it all remained in the salt.

- 23.1.2 All-Metai_ Static Cell Experiment
Although the initial experimental work on electrolytic

‘cell development utilized quartz as a convenient con-

tainer material, this material will not be suitable for
long-term usage. The most corrosive condition in a cell
will be in the vicinity of anodic surfaces, where an
oxidizing condition exists. Cathodic surfaces must resist
attack by liquid bismuth, but the corrosion problem at

‘this point is not considered severe. It is planned that all

of black material was noted during several hours of cell

operation which followed. During this time, salt circula-

tion was promoted by an argon sparge in the cathode

chamber. : , _ -
4. Gas was evolved from the anode during the electro-

~ lytic process, even at a current density as low as 0.15

amp/cm? . Mass spectrometric analysis of off-gas samples
showed the gas to be SiF4. The SiF, concentration in
the samples increased as the cell current density was in-

anodic surfaces other than liquid bismuth surfaces will
be protected by a frozen salt layer. A small all-metal
static cell has been installed for study of this method of
operation.

The main body of the cells is a 6-in. sched 40 mild
steel pipe 18 in. long with a flat, %-in.-thick bottom.
The cell body is the cathode container. The upper part
of the cell is flanged, and the upper flange is electrically
insulated from the cell body. The anode of the cell,
shown in Fig. 23.4 before assembly, is a double-walled
fluid-cooled cup having an inside diameter of 1.75 in.
(15.5 cm? gross electrode area) and an outside diameter
of 2.75 in. The cup is suspended from the top flange by
two %-in. tubes, which serve as the coolant (nitrogen
and water) inlet and outlet as well as the electrical con-
nection to -the anode. Provision was made for raising
and lowering the anode cup. Viewing ports are provided
on the top flange, and prdvision is made for sampling
the salt or bismuth without introducing air into the sys-
tem. The cell is shown after installation in Fig. 23.2.

The cell has been charged with 16.3 kg of bismuth
treated with hydrogen at 700°C for 16 hr and molten
salt (4.5 kg of 66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,) which had been

~ purified by hydrofluorination, hydrogen reduction, and

filtration. The system will be tested initially for forma-

" tion of a frozen salt layer on the outer surfaces of the

creased. The gas was produced on the anode side of the

quartz divider which separated the bismuth anode and .

cathode and was produced only during or immediately
after current passage. These observations strongly sug-

gest that the gas evolution was the result of reaction of

BiF; produced at the anode with the quartz divider.
5. There was no evidence of fluorine evolution during

most of the cell operation. Only after the cell had

shorted internally (arcing was noted between the elec-

anode cup, and electrolysis experiments will follow.

and dispersed phase (Hg) holdup. Quantitative informa-
tion was also obtained on flow patterns and drop sizes
(or interfacial area). Four different packing materials
and one baffled cartridge have been studied in a 1-in.-ID
‘column.

As noted in the previous semiannual report, drop be-
havior and hence interfacial area are dramatically af-
fected by packing sizes. The %-in. Raschig rings caused
the mercury to coalesce into streams with low interfacial
area, while ¥%-in. solid cylindrical packing allowed the
mercury to remain dispersed into small droplets with a
large interfacial area. The more recent data continue to

“confirm this dependence of droplet behavior on packing
size — mercury is dispersed into small drops by ¥-in.
Raschig rings but coalesced by %-in. solid cylindrical
packing.

We have also observed a similar dependence of drop

~ behavior upon total column throughput. With packed

columns the effect of flow rate on drop size is rela-
tively small and probably can be ignored in most cases.
The effect, however, was dramatic with the baffled
cartridge. Figure 23.6 shows a photograph of the baf-
fled column with a mercury flow rate of 480 ml/min
and a water rate of 200 ml/min. The mercury is well
-dispersed into small droplets. However, when the mer-

" cury rate was increased to 660 ml/min, the mercury

coalesced essentially completely, as shown in Fig. 23.7.

Pressure drop and holdup data for a 2-ft length of the
1-in. column packed with Y-in. Raschig rings are
shown in Figs. 23.8 and 23.9. These results are similar
to all the data obtained with other packing materials.
Pressure drop and holdup for larger packing sizes
(where the mercury is well dispersed) may be related
by the semiempirical equations

Thus with three constants (k, k2, and k3) the hydro-
dynamic aspects (holdup, pressure drop, and, by impli-
cation, flooding rates) of a dispersed-flow column can
be -related. Unfortunately, only two of the four packing
materials tested gave dispersed flow, and to adequately

296

evaluate any relationship between the hydrodynamic
variables will require data from more packing materials.
Since we are now also considering larger packing mate-
rials for the processing system, a 2-in.-ID column and a
larger mercury pump have been installed so that %-in.
and possibly %-in. packing materials can be tested.
The equipment necessary to study back mixing in
packed columns has been fabricated and assembled.
Ordinary packed columns as well as special columns
modified to reduce back mixing will be tested.

23.4 DESIGN OF A CONTINUOUS ELECTROLYTIC

CELL TESTING SYSTEM
E. L. Nicholson L. E. McNeese
~M.S.Lin W. F. Schaffer

E. L. Youngblood

A systém is being built to continuously circulate

molten salt and bismuth through an electrolytic cell at

550 to 600°C (Fig. 23.10). The electrolytic cell con-
tainment vessel will permit testing a variety of cell de-
signs and has provisions for cooling, sampling, and
visually observing the cell. Criteria for the cells are
being developed based on tests of static cells that are
under way. Tentatively, the cell will have anode and
cathode areas of about 0.1 ft? each and will be supplied

- with approximately 1500 amp at 10 to 20 v. Flows

are to be up to 0.5 gpm of bismuth and 0.25 gpm of
salt, The system external to the cell consists of a mixer-
settler tank to equilibrate the salt and bismuth streams
from the cell and gas lift pumps and gravity-head-type
orifice flowmeters for return of the streams to the cell.
Low-carbon steel will be used for most of the system
in contact with salt or bismuth. The agitator shaft and

‘impeller will be made of molybdenum, as will several

of the transfer lines and the internal piping in the elec-
trolytic cell containment vessel. Outlet nozzles on the
mixer-settler vessel have been coated with vapor-
deposited tungsten. Provisions have been made for
inserting corrosion test coupons in the system.

Gas lifts were selected as the simplest method for
pumping salt and bismuth. Gas lift performance data
could not be found for high-density liquids such as
bismuth, so tests were made on gas lift pumping of
mercury. For a total lift height of 34 in., a lift tube
diameter of 0.3 in., and a fractional submergence of
0.54, the maximum pumping rate was 0.26 gpm with
a gas consumption of 4.0 std litersfmin (1.3 std
liters/min at operating temperature). Two lift tubes
will be operated in parallel on the bismuth stream to
get the desired capacity because a single large-diameter
lift tube had excessive gas consumption. One small-

diameter lift tube will be required for the salt stream.

" Flow regulation will be obtained by varying the gas

flow to the lift. Entrainment and liquid surging was a
problem in the gas lift disengagement head pot. A head
pot with a baffled annulus was developed that elimi-
nated the entrainment problem and dampened the
surges in gas lift liquid discharge so that a quiet pool
was maintained in the orifice meter compartment.
Tests are under way to determine the required orifice
sizes. '

- The vessels and equipment stand are being fabri-

cated, and modifications to the walk-in hood in Build-

'ing 3541, where the unit will be installed, are under

way.
23.5 EXPERIMENTAL FACILITIES FOR
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION DEVELOPMENT WORK

E. L. Nicholson B.B. Klima
E. L. Youngblood

A request for a directive is béing prepared to obtain

- approval for modification of cell 2, Building 3019, so

that it can be used for engineering-scale reductive ex-
traction experiments with protactinium or other alpha
emitters. The cell is 19 X 20 X 27 ft high and will have
three working levels which are independently ventilated
and isolated from each other by air locks so that each
level can function as an independent alpha laboratory.
Alternatively, removable floor panels will permit instal-
lation of large full-height experiments such as a demon-
stration of reductive extraction using full-height packed
columns. Conceptual engineering work is under way, so
that the cost estimate can be prepared for the prelimi-
nary project proposal that must accompany the direc-
tive request. - :

 
 

 

24. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

J. R. Hightower
B. A. Hannaford

The molten-salt still is presently being installed in the
spare cell at the MSRE for demonstrating low-pressure,
high-temperature distillation of the MSRE carrier salt.
Tests with nonradioactive salt mixtures have shown’
that the equipment is suitable for operation with the
irradiated fuel carrier salt.

The nonradioactive tests suggested minor equipment
chdnges for operation at the MSRE. Since we had ex-
perienced restrictions in the still pot feed line and in the
vacuum line from the receiver, we replaced all lines to
ensure that no obstructions existed. Additional thermo-
couples were installed on the feed line to the still pot,
on argon feed lines, and on off-gas lines to give better
coverage of temperatures. Lines heated with Calrods

- were electrically insulated from the heater sheath to

prevent the heated line from being accidentally placed
in the electrical circuit in the event of a Calrod failure.
The configuration of the feed line to the still pot was
changed to minimize the length of line heated by the
still pot heaters to temperatures near 1000°C. This
change could reduce the rate of metal deposition below
that seen in the nonradioactive experiments. Improved
electrical insulation and shielding were added to the still

pot liquid level instrumentation to improve the perfor-
mance of these instruments.

A new condensate sampler was designed and built. It
is similar to equipment used to add 232U to the fuel
drain tanks but has modifications to allow samples to
be taken without disturbing operation of the still, The
sampler is shown schematically in Fig. 24.1. The sample
capsules (10-g MSRE capsules) will be placed in holders

on the turntable in the containment vessel prior to the -

experiment. At the end of the experiment the capsules
will be withdrawn through the removal tube into a car-
rier for analysis.

Presently, installation of the still has been completed
except for connecting the transfer line from the fuel
storage tank to the feed tank and attaching the sampler
to the sample line. A filter will be installed in the trans-
fer line to avoid the transfer of solid material. Before
completing these items, we introduced about 16 liters of
nonradioactive salt into the system to test the liquid
probes in the still pot and to ensure that all installed
components were working properly. Wé heated the still
pot to 900°C, pumped the condenser down to 0.1—1
mm Hg, and distilled about 2 liters of the test salt. All
parts of the system performed satisfactorily. The test
salt was then discharged from the still. Connection of
the transfer line and attachment of the sampler are
under way.
