A STUDY OF LEAD AND LEAD SALT CORROSION IN
THERMAL - CONVECTION LOOPS

 

G.vM. Tolson and A, Taboada
ABSTRACT

Thermal-convection loop tests of several structural
~alloys were operated using circulating molten lead.
Screening tests were run to evaluate Croloy 2 1/4 Cr,
~ carbon steel, AISI-type 410 stainless steel, and
No—1% Zr at conditions described in Teble l Two of the
"~ test loops contained surge tanks in which fluoride salts,
Nb—1% Zr alloy, and graphite were placed in contact with
the lead to determine the compatibility of these
materials in a direct-cooled lead system.

A1l of the steel loops tended to plug in the cold
regions because of formation of dendritic crystals of -
" iron and chromium. . The hot-leg attack consisted of
general surface removal with a few large pits extending
to a greater depth. The Nb—1% Zr alloy showed no
measurable attack; however, niobium -crystals were found
| in the cold leg of a loop which operated 5000 hr at
o 1400°F with a AT of 400°F. |

 

INTRODUCTTON

Liquid 1ead has béen’proposed as'a coolant-for molten-salt'breeder

? reactors. In one reactor des1gn, lead is in direct contact with salts
| _at temperatures up to llOO°F thus eliminating a heat exchanger and
| resulting in superlor heat transfer and thermal efficiencies. In another
Ndesign, the lead extracts heat from the salt in. a salt-lead heat exchanger.
- The materials commonly used in‘reactors at these temperatures, such as’

’,,300 series stainless steels, Inconels, or Hastelloys, cannot be used in

contact with lead because of the high solubility levels of nlckel in

'lead that result in excessive mass transfer.‘ The refractory'metals
“1offer very good corros1on resistance but are difficult to fabricate and
7 _are too expensive for a complete reactor system. Carbon steels offer
B good ‘corrosion resistance to- liquid lead but are very marginal with

_ respect to both strength and oxidation resistance, Since Croloys (steel

with 1 1/4 to 9% Cr and 1/2 to 1% Mo) and 400 series stainless steels

these appeared to be the most promising material for this‘appiication.

Consequently, the primary effort was expended in evaluating these

LITERATURE SURVEY

 

A great portion of the liquid lead corrosion tests'deseribed in
the literature involves capsule tests that demonstrate the occurrence of {“
no standard test procedure was used from one test to the hext., Test
specimens were contained in a variety of capsule materlals such as
graphite, quartz, and the specimen material itself. Inhibitors were
frequently used, and a variety of methods were used to prevent oxidation..

The maximum test time was approximately 500 hr.

Results in these isothermal tests generally indicated that iron,
carbon steels, low-chromium steels, and chromium stainless steels
(nickel-free) had good resistance to corrosion by lead at temperatures
up to 1400°F. Austenitic stainless steels were geod to 1000°F. Tan-
talum, niobium, and molybdenum were not attacked by lead at 1800°F,

Nickel and nickel-base alloys had poor resistance to attack by lead,

0.38 mils/year.l Other nonferrous alloys of Cu, Pt, Au, W, Sn, Zn, Mn, | o
Zr, and Ti behaved poorly or were not recoﬁmended Carbon demonstrated ‘_ _ _ :r‘
poor resistance to attack by lead at 1800°F but good resistance at
935°F., ‘

In addition to the above, other experimentation has been done - 3
using thermal-convectlon loops to study mass transfer. As in the static
work, no standard test design existed, making comparlson'of data diffi-

cult, The effect of impurities in lead are not well understood.’ Oxygen 'ﬁ

- has been reported to increase corrosion in lead. Some research indicates

that many elements may'act_as corrosion inhibitors. These.inhibitors
could act to form a protective, film in the case of titanium and zir-

conium (ref. 2), to decrease the solubility of the container material in

 lead as may be the case of nickel, or to remove oxygen from the system

in- the case of magnesium.

In one of the 1nvest1gations the relative resistance to mass

transfer in liquid lead of 24 metals and alloys was measured3 at 1472°F

‘maximm loop temperature and 300°F AT, The tests were run in quartz

thermal—cdnvection loops with the alloy being_studled formed-lnto tubes

‘which were inserted into the hot leg and cold lég. In these tests

niobium and molybdenum exhlbited no mass transfer after 500 hr of test.
Nickel—base alloys and austenitic stainless steels were hlghly susceptible

to mass transfer and plugged the loops within 100 hr. Intergranular

attack was noted in the hot region.- The pure metals, Fe, Cr, Co, Ti,

and Ni, all plugged W1thin 100 hr The .400. serles stainless steel
(chromlum) and molybdenum-bearlng alloys showed llttle evidence of mass
transfer after approximately 500 hr. There was some evidence of prefer-‘

was operated; many bismuth and lead-bismuth.loop tests were conducted;
iIn'general, the low-alloy steels and low-chromium steels exhibited the
best corrosion resistance to bismuth and lead-bismuth; however, titanium
and zirconium additions were required to obtain goodlcorrosion resistance
in loops that operated above 752°F. The authors concluded that titanium
and zirconium inhibited corrosion by forming\ZrN, TiN, and TiC on the
walls in the hottest regidns of the loops. No corrbsion occurred in
inhibited loops that operated for 10,000 hr at temperatures as high as
1022°F in bismuth and temperatures as high as 1202°F in lead-bismuth
eutectic, A single Croloy 2 1/4 steel loop containing‘zifconium—iﬁhibiteq | L
lead was operated for over 27,000 hr with a i022°F hotlleg and approxi- +
mately 212°F AT, Although the zirconium additions had been made, the

zirconium was not detected by chemical analysis of the solution. . The

lead also contained about 250 ppm of magnesium, which had been added to

prevent loss of zirconium by oxidation, and it may have héd an inhibiting

effect.

DESCRIPTION OF TESTS

Six uninhibited thermal-convection loop tests were performed at
ORNL to explore the compatibility of materials with lead under coﬁditions
expected in molten salt reactors. ‘One additional loop test was also
verformed to evaluate the performance of a newly designed thermal- -
convection loop. A description of the loop and the results are presented
in the Appendix. The operating conditions for all the loops are summarized -
in Teble 1. |

Two of the loops (type 410 stainless steel and 2-1/4 Cr steel) had
Nb—1% Zr alloy liners in the surge tanks. Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
fuel salt® floated on the lead surface in the surge tanks as shown in
Fig. 1. These loops also contained a graphite specimen in the surge tank

which was exposed to both the salt and the lead at the lead-salt inter-
face. The maximum temperature in the loops was about 1200°F and the AT

was 300°F,

Two other loops which did not contain salt or graphite operated at
1100°F with a 200°F AT, One of these loops was constructed of 2 1/4 Cr
~ steel, the other of low-carbon steel. A third set of,leop-tests was
operated to investigate the compatibility of nidﬁium with lead both with
‘and without MSRE salt. These loops were fabricated from niobium clad
with type 446 stainless steel. o

A cleaning charge of lead was used in all the iron-base loops.
The charge was run isothermally at the maximm operating temperature of
the loop overnight (ebout 12 hr) and then dumped. The lOops'were then
refilled with clean lead and puﬁ into operation. This was not done with

 the Nb—1% Zr loop because of the difficulty in attaching a drain line.

The approximate depth of hot-leg attack as determined by the change in

wall thickness averaged 5 mils and could have been as deep as 8 mils,

The uncertainty in the depth of attack is due to the pitting nature of
the attack and the variation in the wall thickness, Analysis of the

crystals ih the cold leg showed about the same Fe/Cr/Mo ratio as that

existing in the original loop piping alloy. A black film found floating
on the lead in the top of the surge tank was identified as MnO by x-ray

diffraction and spectrographic analysis, The manganese was probably

preferentially leached from the hot leg and then deposited in the surge

tank as it scavenged oxygen from the rest of the system materials.

The carbon steel loop, constructed of large-diameter pipe, operated

for 5000 hr before shutdown. Prior to shutdown, the loop was begimning

to show some signs of restricted flow. ‘Subsequent measurements of the

wall thickness of the loop piping showed a meximum of 10 and an‘average

of 7 mils of attack similar to that found in the 2 1/4 loops (see Fig. 6).

©  CONCLUSIONS AND RIECOMMENDATTONS

The results of the tests are given in feble 2 along with a

Brookhaven loop to use as a comparison. The poor performance of the

| ferritic materials described here: suggests that these materials are

unsuitable to contain,lead{at the conditions_investigated. This is

'surpriSing-in light of the 27,795-hr Brookhaven loop;_ The 78°F 4if-

ference in hot-leg'temperature between our 5156<hr loop and the

Brookhaven 1oop'is'not'great enough to-explain the several orders of

magnitude difference in the corrosion, ‘The difference could‘be due to

-the_inhibiting effect of the magnesium, used as a debxident in the

Brookhaven loop. Previously‘ cited literature describing the benefit
to be derived by inhibitors“offers a possible remedy. The most promising

inhibitor for our System wouldibe titanium since it is also compatible

with the salt, ? It is therefore recommended that several tests be per-

- formed to evaluate the effect of titanium and/or magnesium as inhibitors

in a steel-liquid 1ead system.
The Nb—1% Zr in these tests had better compatibility at higher :

temperatures than the ferritic‘materials. Although it is expensive and

at present difficult to fabricate, Nb-1% Zr could possibly be used in the
.~ high-temperature portion Ofga bimetal system, It is therefore suggested

that the effects of MSRE salt in & Nb—l% Zr-lead system be further
investigated _ _ o
‘The loops that. were used in this investigation were run for

'iscreening purposes and were not designed to obtained a maximum amount of
~ data. Corros1on rates on the 1oops could only be determined metallo-‘
"-ugraphically.- Since the attack occurs as uniform surface removal, the
7 :'depth of attack could- only be determined by wall thickness differences,
7_;fan inaccurate method due to the variation in original pipe wall thick-

'ness.r Consequently, a new loop de51gn has been develcped and is des- N

““.cribed in the Appendix._ The new 1oop gives better control of the loop
‘Variables and provides for improved methods of analysis. : -

- APPENDIX

In an effort.to%inCreaSe the value of thermal -convection loop tests,

a new test loop was developed (see Fig. 10) incorporating the folIOW1ng

features:

1. Removable hot-leg samples for both weight-change measurements and
metallographic analysis. Samples can be removed w1thout contacting
the salt. | | '

- 2. Temperature control by'a'thermocouplehlocated in the lead. The

'thermocouple is movable 80 that a temperature profile of the hot

i leg can also be obtained.

3. MSRE salt floating on 1ead in contact with both the Nb—l% Zr liner

‘and graphite in the surge tank,
4. Miniaturized de51gn to. facilitate sectioning or radiographing of the
complete loop. |
5. Sampling of both the 1ead and salt
6. A method by which the 1oop may be drained and refilled without
removing the salt so that the hot leg can be radiographed to find
selective attack and so that mass transfer crystals may'be removed
by gravity separation. ) f
7. Improved control of theJCOld-leg temperature.

A.prototype loop of the new design was run to_test_the'temperature ,

distribution and the sample removal=and'cleaning techniques, = The loop

-operated with a hot-leg temperature of 1100 and 1200°F and a maximum

AT of 230°F The sample cleaning techniques that were developed con-

‘sisted of amalgamation of- the 1ead with mercury and then removal of the
_- amalgamate with concentrated nitric acid Control specimens . processed
'7_-along with the loop specimens showed no significant weight change. One
of the removable samples used in the loop was zirconium. It did not
"1ose or gain any weight. Since the loop plugged after 1848 hr of opera-
tion end showed & maximum of 4. 5 mils of attack, it is apparent that the
., “presence of z1rconium did not signlficantly affect the corr051on behavior

~ in the system.

In the new loop, better control over the cold-leg temperature is
achieved through the use of a cold-leg heater placed at the inlet to the
cold leg of the 1oop. Thls heater is controlled by the cold- leg thermo-

_couple, A shutdown device is also incorporated which terminates the

1oop when the temperature at the cold-leg heater equals that of the hot
1eg.,_With this design,,the_degree of plugging may be determined by the

pouer conéumption of the cold-leg~heater. -The system worked very'well in

the prototype test and will be used on future loops. -
