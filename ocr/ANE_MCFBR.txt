Breeder reactors differ from other reactor types in that
they are not only power-producing devices but also a
source of fissile material and therefore should be
considered as part of a complex “breeding system”
which includes both the power reactor ,producing
electricity and heat, and the reprocessing and fuel
preparation plant. From this point of view the fast
reactor with molten fuel seems to be better adapted to
the long-term secure breeding system than are the solid-
fuel reactors.

The reactor system described here being a
continuation of a long-term development study of a
molten-chlorides breeder demonstrates
some of these advantages, among others a very high
inherent safety ,without relying on engineered devices,
against changes of power level and loss-of-coolant
accident.

1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REACTOR

In this paper a molten-chloride fast breeder reactor
with in-core cooling using fertile material as
coolant is discussed. The flow of the blanket-coolant agent is as
follows—through U tubes in the core—heat
exchanger—pump—blanket region—return to core.
The coolant blanket circuits are in the form of at
least two independent systems: the core vessel is not
divided.
The core is directly connected with: overflow buffer
vessel for thermal expansion of fuel, emergency fuel
drainage tank, reprocessing and fuel preparation plant,
and an off-gas system with continuous purification for
removing the volatile fission products and for control of
corrossion processes.
The structural material is molybdenum and iron; the
corrosion phenomena might be controlled in-situ by
means of a volatile reagent added to the off-gas system.
The coolant is circulated through the U-tubes with a
velocity of 9 m/s, the coolant pump is out-of-core; the
fuel is circulated within the core itself with a velocity of
2 m/s ,the pump being in-core.
The advantages brought about by this arrangement
are as follows.No separate ‘foreign’ cooling agent in the core
results in an improvement in the neutron balance and
the unique behavior of the system.
The unification of the blanket material and cooling
agent results in a system which has a very strong
negative reactivity in the case of loss-of-coolant
accident, which in this system equals the loss
of blanket material accident. This results in a
spontaneous ‘self-reduction’ of the criticality thus
stopping the fission reaction without any ‘engineered’
safeguards since the reactivity
decrease by 8%/N where N is the number of
independent circuits only one remaining intact.

The division of this coolant system into at least
two totally independent circuits with a “crossed over”
lattice of U-tubes in the core plus the circulation of
liquid fuel even when assumed to be low makes
possible the removal of residual fission product heating;
only one undamaged circuit being necessary to achieve
this.
The off-gas system makes it possible to
continuously remove part of the noble gases and other
volatile fission products from the core such as iodine
and to control the corrosion processes on the core
structural materials.
The plutonium-containing salt fuel is in general
separate from the uranium-containing salt coolant and
blanket material which simplifies the technology of
reprocessing, improves the corrosion problems and at
the same time diminishes the problem of a leak in either
direction particularly when the continuous reprocessing
removes the “foreign” component in both the fuel and
blanket coolant. The compatibility of fuel and blanket
coolant is excellent.
The very strong negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity arising out of any power excursion we get an
increase of fuel temperature causing a decrease in
density and an ejection of part of the fuel material from
the core region through specially arranged tubes.
The continuous reprocessing plant using salt-liquid
metal transport processes means a reduced plutonium
inventory and an increased load factor for the plant and
enhances the effective doubling time of the system.
However, the disadvantages are also numerous.
The first and most important disadvantage is of
course corrosion. The molten chloride medium,
especially in neutron and gamma fields at high
temperatures and velocities with virtually free chlorine
present from the fission of plutonium chloride, presents
Molten plutonium chloride fast breeder reactor cooled by molten uranium chloride
a very serious problem which has to be solved, perhaps
by means of continuous control of the chemistry in-situ
by means of volatile agents.
The most likely structural material seems to be a
molybdenum alloy which among other things gives rise
to parasitic absorption of neutrons.
The fuel is circulated by a pump which must be
located in or close to the core which increases the
corrosion problems. Other possibilities for increasing
the heat transfer in the fuel are probable, but not easy to
realise.
The high fuel and coolant velocities result in high
pumping costs and could cause erosion and increase of
hydrodynamic pressure.

In order to define the neutron spectrum in this
reactor a 22-group cross-section set has been prepared,
the code GGC3 which allows 99 group calculations for a rather simple geometry has
been used for this condensation. Most of the GGC3
library data were evaluated by GGA before 1967 but
some are more recent.
All whole reactor calculations have been made on
the basis of transport theory using the 22-group cross-
section set in spherical and cylindrical geometry. The
transport methods were aimed at getting a better
accuracy for some reactivity coefficients.
The spectrum of the MCFBR compares favorably with that
of a LMFBR.
From Table 2 one can deduce that k = 1.385. 
Taking into account the latest data the problem of
parasitic absorption of the chlorine is not dramatic so
there appears to be no need to enrich the chlorine, 37Cl,
which is consistent with the conclusion of Nelson et al. The neutron spectrum shows a peak which
corresponds to the chlorine cross section minimum
,65% of neutrons are in an energy range where sigma of Chlorine is less than 5
mb. This fact was perhaps not recognized 15 yr ago
when fine spectrum calculations were not possible; it
would perhaps explain the pessimistic conclusions of
several eminent physicists about the use of natural chlorine in this type of
reactor.
For the chosen structural material, 20% Mo, the
reactivity cost of 2% is quite acceptable.
However, the cost could rapidly become rather
prohibitive if the volume of the structural material
and/or molybdenum content should increase for
technological reasons.
Five complete transport calculations have been made
for different coolant or fuel densities, and different
temperatures. If one considers that all the
density modifications come from thermal expansion
,liquid phase only, one can define general temperature
coefficients.
In the second term the part played by the Doppler
coefficient (0.00048) is quite negligible. For +100K in
the isothermal core the loss of reactivity is —2.5% which
is very important from the safety point of view.
Compared to any other type of power reactor ,even the
BWR, the advantage of this kind of reactor on the
grounds of inherent safety is quite evident.
The void coefficient of the fuel (1st term) is strongly
negative; 1% void gives a 0.6% loss of reactivity. If boiling occurs in the
fuel it will be rapidly arrested by a decrease in reactor
power.

This type of reactor, has fuel circulating in the core
only, with a relatively low temperature gradient of
approximately 35 C and a high heat capacity, and a high
velocity coolant ~9 m/s with again a low temperature
gradient of approximately 43 C and high heat capacity.
This, coupled with the very high negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity results in an unusually high
negative thermal and ‘reactivity’ stability.

Decrease of the fuel circulation and/or coolant,
velocity in the U-tubes results in a definite and
“automatic” decrease of reactor power without recourse
to engineered methods. This points to such a reactor
being a surprisingly stable and self-regulating device.

The achievement of the required fuel velocity in the
core seems to require a forced circulation system since
the rough estimate using natural convection gives a heat
transfer coefficient which is too low giving decrease of
a specific power which is not acceptable.

Such a forced circulation system can be
one of the following types—pump installed directly in
the core, pump outside the core, an external pump with
injector, a gas lift pump using inert gas. Consideration
of the factors involved using criteria such as reduction
of the out-of-core inventory, elimination of additional
heat exchangers; minimization of the fuel leakage,
minimization of the auxiliary power, optimization of the
fuel flow regulation—all point to an in-core pump
solution. Of course this gives rise to considerable
technical problems.

From the earlier published data it appears that the
problem of the chemical state, oxidation state, in this
chloride medium for the fission product element
constituents requires further clarification.
From a simple consideration it seems that the freeing
of chlorine from the fissioned plutonium is controlled
Molten plutonium chloride fast breeder reactor cooled by molten uranium chlonide
by the fission product elements with standard free
enthalpy of formation up to ~20 kJ/mol of chlorine, that
is up to molybdenum chloride. The more ‘noble” metals
such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium and
probably tellurium and of course noble gases: Xenon,
krypton plus probably iodine and bromine, remain in
their elementary state because of lack of chlorine. Molybdenum as a fission product with a yield
of ~18% from 200% all fission products may remain in
part in metallic form. Since molybdenum also plays the
role of structural material the corrosion problems of the
metallic molybdenum or its alloys are strongly linked
with the fission product behavior in this medium.
The possible reaction of UCl3 and PuCl3 with MoCl2
resulting in further chlorination of the actinides-
trichlorides to tetrachlorides seems, for PuCl; very
unlikely, but this is not so for UCl3.
A rather serious problem arises out of the possible
reaction of oxygen and oxygen containing compounds
(e.g. water) with PuCl3 and UCl3 which results in a
precipitation of oxides or oxychlorides. The continuous
reprocessing may permit some control over the
permissible level of oxygen in the entire system as well
as the continuous gas bubbling system with appropriate
chemical reducing agent.
Corrosion of the structural material, being
molybdenum is also strongly influenced by the oxygen
containing substances. A  protective layer of
molybdenum however, may be used on some steel
materials using electrodeposition or plasma spraying
techniques.
