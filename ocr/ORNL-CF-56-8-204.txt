FPREFACE

In September, 1955, a group of men experienced in various scientific
and engineering filelds embarked on the twelve months of study which culminated
in this report. For nine of those months, formal clessroom and student
leboratory work occupied their time. At the end of that period, these nine
students were presented with a problem in reactor design. They studied it for
ten weeks, the final period of the school term.

This is & summary report of their effort. It must be reslized that
in so short a time, a study of this scope can not be guaranteed complete or
free of error. This "thesis" 1s not offered as a polished engineering report,
but rather as a record of the work done by the group under the leadership of

"the group leader. It is issued for use by those persons competent to assess

the uncerteinties inherent in the results obtained in terms of the preciseness
of the technical dats and analytical methods employed in the study. In the
opinion of the students and faculty of ORSORT, the problem has served the
pedagogicel purpose for which it was intended.

The faculty Joins the authors in an expression of appreciation for
the generous assistance which various members of the QOak Ridge Nationsal
Laboratory gave. In particuler, the guldence of the group consultants,

A. M. Weinberg, R. A, Charple, and H. G. McPherson, is gratefully acknowledged.

ABSTRACT

An externally cooled, fused salt, fast breeder reactor producing 700 M4

of heat has been désigned utilizing plutonium as the fuel in a mixture of

the chlorides of sodium, magnesium, uraniun and plutonium. Depleted uraniwm
is used as the fertile material in a blanket of wraniun oxide in sodium.

Nuclear calculations have been performed with the aid of the UNIVAC for
multi-group, malti-region problems to obtain an optimm muclear design of
the system with the chosen fused ssalt.

Steam temperature and pressure conditions at the turbine throttle have
been maintained such that the incorporation of a conventionzl turbine-generator
set into the system design is boasible.

An economic anslysis of the system, including estimaﬁéd chemical pro- |
cessing costs has been prepared; The analysis indiecates that the fused salt
system of this étudy has an excellent potential for meeting the challenge of
economlic nuclear power. |

It was not learned until the completion of the study of the severe (n,p)
cross section of the chlorine-35 isotope in the range of enmergies of in-
terest. This effect was smplified by the large number of chlorime atoms pre-
sent per atom of plutonium, The reéult was considered serious enongh to
legislate against the reactor. o

It was determired, however, that the chlorine~37 isotope hadré high

~ enough threshold for the (n,p) reaction so that it could be tolerated in

this reacter. The requirement for the chlorine-37 isotope necessitates an
isotope separation which is estimated to add 0.5 mils per kwhr. to the cost
of power. The power cost would then be 7.0 mils per kwhr. instead of the

6.5 mils per kwhr. reported.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1 FROBLEM

1.1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the technical and economic

Ifeasibility of a fast breeder-~power reactor, employing a fused salt fuel,

based on & reasonable estimate of the progress of the fused salt technology.
Fuel bearing fused salts are presently receiving consideration for high
temperature applications and in addition have been proposed as a;possible

solution to some of the difficult problems of the fast reactor.

1.1.2 Scope

A major consideration was an initial decision to devote the group
effort to & conceptual design of complete reactor system insteéd of con~- |
centrating on parameter studies of the reactor or the heat transfer and power
plant at the expense of the other components. This philosoﬁhj necessitated
overlooking many small problems that would arise in the detailed design of
the reactor andipower plant but provided a perspective for evaluating the
techﬁical and economic feasibility of the entire reactor éystem'instead of
only portions of it. | | N |

At the outsel of the study it was determined that a breeding ratio
significantly less than one would be oﬁtained from an interaa11y'éob1ed machine.
It was theréfore decided to further restrict the study tb an externaily_cooleq,
circulating fuel reactor in whicﬂ & breeding ratio of at least one was ob-

tainable,

1,2 EVALUATION OF FUSED SALTS
1.2.,1 Advantsges of Fused Salis

The fused salts enjoy practically all the advantages of the liquid

fueled, homogeneous type reactor. Among the more prominent of these are:

1.

2.

3.

be

The large negative tempersture coefficient which aids in
reactivity control; |

The elimination of expensive and difficult'toperform fuel
element fabrication procedures;

The simplified charging procedure uhich‘provides a means of
shim control by concentration charges;

The higher permissible fuel burn-up without the attendant

mechanicel difficulties experienced with solid fuel elements.

In eddition, the fused salts display a superiority over the aqueous

homogeneous reactor in these respects.

1.

‘2.

Lowsr operating pressure due to the much lower vapor pressure

of the fused salts;

Higher thermodynamic efficiency due to the operation at

higher temperature.

1.2.2 Disadvantages of Fused Salts

There ere several disadvantages which are attendant upon the use

1,

of fused salts for the application reported upon here. Of these, the most
prejudicial 4o the success of the reactor are:

The corrosion problem which is so severe that progress in
this application awaits development of suiteble resistant

materiels;

 
 

2. The lerge fuel inventory required because of the externsl
| fuel hold-up; | | | |

3. The poor heat transfer properties e:éhfbited' by the fused
salts;

k. fThe low specific powers obtainsble in the fused salt fast

reactor system compared to the equeous homogeneous reactors.

1,3 RESULIS OF STUDY |
“ The fingl design is & two rég:i.on rea_ctor with & fused salt core and a

uranium oxide powder in sodium blanket. The fuel domponent 13 plutonium
with a totael system mass of 1810 kg. The reactor has a total breeding ratio
of 1.09 exclusive of chemical processing losses.

The reactor produces 700 MW of heat and has & net electricél output of
260 M7. The net thermal efficiency of the system is 37.1 per cent. The steem
conditions at the turbine throttle are 1000°F and 2400 psi.

The cost of electrical power from this system was calculated to be 6.5
mlils per kwhr. This cost included & chemical processing cost of 0.9 mils
per kvhr. based on & core processing cycle of five years a.nd & blanket pfo-

cessing cycle of one year.

1.4 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM

The fused galt fast reactor which evolved from this study is an externslly
cooled, plutonium fueled, powersbreeder reactor producing 700 megawatts of
heat with & net electrical output of 260 megawatts.

1.4.1 Core

The core fuel consists of a homogensous mixture of the chlorides
of sodium, magnesium, uranium and plutonium with mole ratios of 3NaCL, 2MgCl,
and 0.9Pu(U)613. The urenium in the core fuel is depleted and is present for

the purposes of internal breeding. The atom ratio of UZBS/Tu239

at startup
is 2 to 1.
The core container is a 72.5 inch I, D., nearly spherical vessel tapered
at the top and bottom to 24 inches for pipe comnections. The core vessel
is fabricated of a % inch thick corrosion resistant nickel-molybdemm alloy.
The fuel mixture enters the core at 1050°F and leawas.at 1350°F, where-
upon it is circuleted by means of & constant speed, 3250 horsepower, canned
rotor pump through the external loop and tube side of a sodium heat exchanger.
Sodium enteré,this core heat exchanger at 900°F at a flow rate of 45.5 x 10°

1bs/hr. and leaves at 10509F<__
1.4.2 Blagket
Separated from the core by & one inch ﬁplten lead reflector is a

stationary blanket of depleted u:anium present as & paste of uraniun oxide
powder in sodium under a 100 ps1_pressure.:chated within the.blanketiis 8
stainless steel clad zone of graphite 5.1/8,1nches:thick. The presence of
the graphite incresses the neutron moderation and results in a smaller size
blanket. |

=19-

- .

 
 

' Blanket cooling is obtained by passing sodium through tubes located |
throughout the blanket, Sodiwm is introduced imto the blanket at 1050°F at
a flow rate of 7.6 x 10° 1bs/hr end leaves at 1200°F. The blanket sodium,
vhich is considerably radioactive, then enters & horizontal sodiur to sodium
heat exchanger and heats the inlet sodium from 900°F to 1050"1-‘.' The sodium
from the blanket heat exchenger is then manifolded with the sodium from the
core heat exchanger and passes to a straight through boiler. At full load
conditions, thé feed water enters the boller at 550°F and 2500 psi at a flow .
rate of 2.62 x 10° 1bs/hr and produces steem at 1000°F and 2400 psi which

passes'to a conventional turbine generator electrical plant.
1.4.3 Control

The routine operetion of the reactor will be controlled by the
negative temperature coefficient which is sufficient to offset reactivity
fluctuations due to expected differences in the reactor mean temperature.

Reactor shim required for fuel burn-up will be obtained by variation

in the height of the molten lead reflector. Approximately one quarter of

~ one per cent reactivity will be available for shim by the increased height

of the lead. When fuel burn-up requires more reactivity than is available

~ from the reflector, compensating changes willl be made in the fuel concentration

and the reflector height will be readjusted.

~ In the event of an excursion, provisions will be nade to dump the entire

core contents in less than 4 seconds and in addition, to dump;the lead re-

flector. Dumping the reflector would provide a change in reactivity of aboﬁt"

1.6 per cent,

1.4.4 Chemical Processing

Chemical proeessiﬁg of the core and blanket, other than removal
and absorption of fission gases, will take place at a large central processing
facility capable of handling the throughput of about 15 power reactors. The
chemical process for both the core and blanket will embody the main features
of the purex type solvent extraction process, with_different head.énd treat-
ments required to make each'material adaptable to the subsequent processing

- steps.

Core processing will take place on a five year cycle whereas the blanket
will be processed bieannually. The plutonium preduct from the chemical process

is finally obtained as the chloride which can be recycled to the reactor.

CHAPTER II
PRELIMINARY REACTOR DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

2.1 SELECTION OF CORE FUEL

 

| _One of'the objectives of this project was ihe toeough investiéation ef
alfueed salﬁ fuel system. Preliminary discussions resulted in the decision
that a core and blanket breeding system would be investigated,
A fused chloride fuel appeared the most pramising of the fused salt
systems. The core fuel eystem studied was @& fused Na Gl Mg 012, UCIB and

: _PuGIB salt. The results of preliminary nnclear calculatione gave the fused

salt compcsition as 9 mols NeCI 6 mols Mg012, 2 mols UClz and l.mol of PuGl3°

The uranium is 0238

2.1.1 Criterias for Selection

The principal properties that the core fuel system should possess

1. Low parasitic neutron sbsorption eross section.
2. Low moderating power and inelastic scattering.
3. Liquid below 500°C.
Lo Radiozctively stable.
5. Thermally stable.
6. Non-corrosive to the materiels of construction.
7. Low viscosity.
8. Appreciable uranium and plutonium content at temperatures of

- the order of 650°C,
9. High thermal conductivity.

| -22-

For fast reactors, the choice of salts containing fissionable and non-
fissionable elements is 1imited to those in which the non-fissionable elements

have a low slowing down power and low cross sections for absorption end inelastic

scattering of fast meutrons. In genersl, elements of atemic wveight less than

twenty ere unsatisfactory because of their moderating effect. This eliminates

many of the common dilvents which contain hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
Salts which are suitable nuclearwise are further restricted to'those which

are thermodynsmipally and chemically stable. The salts must be stable at the

operating tempersture/of the resactor, 675 C. Also the liquidus temperature

of the fused sslt m{zturs should be. b;}ow 500°C. This ie desirable so that more

; écmmon and chesper\ ructural msteria s may be used. The higher the temperature

of operation, the\pbre exotic are th# materials required. In addition & lower .

operating temperafhre tends to ret;fd cuerosion, The further very important 7"

requirement is ;ﬁet the diluents must dissolve the necessary quantities'of.
| /

uraniwm and plutonium to ensble the system to go criticel.

   
 

/

Based upon the aforementio ed'requirements the halide femily appesred ,
the most pr ising., Of the halides, - chiorides and fluorides were the initial
choices. 3ps bromides snd if ides were eliminated because of their high |

/
omine /has an avers,ge 6" at 1 mev of 30 mb and

ebsorption cross sections. /
fodins hss 8 G, of 105 mb &t this ?rergy. Chlorine -and fluorine have osptured
cross seétions of 0. 74 5 and 0,2 mb respectively.

Originally, it appesred*thatvthere were“available 3 possible fuel systems; -
one using chlorides, one ﬁtiliziﬁg fluorioss and & third using'a'mizture‘of-'
fluorides and ohlorioss. Ghlorides presented the obvious disadvantage of a
higher cspture cross seotion. The flourides were detrimental because of their
moderating effect. After a more thorough investigation, the fluorides were

23~

f
"’-

.

 
 

 

ruled ocut because of their prohibitively high inelastic scattering cross
sect_;on in the energy range of interest. Preliminery nuclear calculations
using fluorides showed the neutron .energy spectrun decidedly lowered.

Ultimately the mixed halides system of chioride #nd fluoride was eliminated
because of the high melting points of -f.he fluorides. This step was té.ken only
after it had been verified that & chloride fused salt system was feasible with
respect to the nuclear requirements of our resctor.

Once it was determined that the fﬁsed chlorides would be used, great
effort was expended in the selection of the pa.rticﬁlar salts to use. One_ of
the most impo;'tant physical properties required was & low melting pd_int
for the salt mixture. It was felt that a ternary system would be most sultable.
A binary would have t00 high a melting point while a quat_ema.ry presented
many unknowns such as formation of compounds; and in general is too difficult
to hendle. | |

The core fuel system will utilize plutonium which is to be pcrodﬁced in
the blanket. Since there exists very meager information on plutonium fused
salts, it was decided that as a fair approximationl, many of the properties |
of uraniwm salts would be used. This eppears to be a valid assxmpfion for |
. physicals properties since plutonium and uranium salts form = so0lid soluﬁion.

As a preliminary step, possible diluent chlorides were reviéwed.- Keeping
the basic requirements in mind and reviewing whatever binary phasé Vd:lagrams |
~were available, the following salts showed promise ZrCI& PLC1, Mgclz,_ NaCl,
KC1, and CaCl,. ZrGJuwas rejected since it 1s expensive and might produce
the snow problem experienced in otherfused salt systems. PHCl, was 'réjécted |
s'ince‘it is very reactive with all known structural materials. From the foﬁr
remaining possibilities, the chlz and NaCl salts were saiected és dilnents.,’ |

[\

 

In addition to possessing many of the requirements,'they had the lowsst liquidus
temperature. As for the fissionable salt, the trichloride or tetrachloride

were the possibilities. PuCl3 andeCIB were selected because of the thermal
instability of the tetrachlorides. Hence the core fused salt system selected

is made up of NaCl, Mg012, U'Gl3 and Pu013. As was pointed out earlier, the
physical properties of our system were investigated using NaCl, Mg012 and 0013.

The PuGl3 is assumed to bé in solid solution with the U013.

2.1.2 Fuel Properties

Since the ternary properties of the proposed fuel were completely un-

vﬁnown, extrapolations of the known binary systems (shown in Figs..2¢1, 2.2, 2.3)

.....were made,

On the basic assumption that the ternary chloride system‘was a siﬁple
one and containing none of the anomalous behavior of the known fluoride systems,
the pictured (Fig. 2.4) ternary diagram was drawn.”

To give some indication of the.mélting temperature to be expected in
our system, = series of melting point determinations was.undertakan. The data
récorded are sumarized below. '(The test procedure is descfibed in the-

In conjunction with the'melting point tests, a petrographic analysis was
cpnducted of the fuel mixture. On the Easis of this anélysis, neither NaCl,
Mg012, nor U013 were detectable in the solidfied fuel. There were two dis-
tinguishable phases preseht, one a colorless crystal and the other & brown
erystal, which was not as prevalent as the colorless one., The compositions
of the phases could not be determined. It was observed that the mixtﬁre was
very hygroscopic and was easily oxidized in air.

The remaining physical properties were estimated by analogy to the fluoride
systems which have been studied. Densities were calculated by the density
correlations of Cohen and Jones (3). Thermal conductivities, heat capacities,

and viscosities were estimated directly from fluoride data.

2,2 SELECTION OF BLANKET MATERIAL

A uranium dioxide-liquid sodium paste was selected as one of the pro-
mising blanket materials, Althbugh only & limited amount of work has been

done on pastes, the prospects for its use are very good.
2.2.,1 Criteria for Selection

The importent characteristics of a satisfactory blanket material
are:

1. Low cost.

2. High concentration of the fertile ﬁaterial.

3. Cheaply fabricﬁted.

4o Low chemical prccessing costs.

5. Good thermai conductivity.

6. Low neutron losses.in non-fertile elements.

7. Low melting point.

Natural or depleted urgnium were obvious cholces for the fertile materisl.
Either material is acceptable, the governing factor being the cost. At the
present tima, the coéf'of depléted uranium is conéiderably lesé fhan natural
uranium and was dhosen as the fertile material 1n the blankst.r' |

Several blankst Bthams were 1nvestigated The more prominent possi-
bilities ﬁere UOQ pellets in>molten sodium, 002 powder in molten sodium, canned
sol4d uranium, fused uranium salts and U02 slurries. - | |

Uranium dicxide pellete 1n.molten sodium appeared very pramising. U02 is;
unreactive with and vary slightly soluble in liquid sodiwm., Cooling could be
accomplished by liquid sodium flowing in tubes. It was estimated that approx-

~31~

 
 

 

imately 65% of U0, by volume could be cbtained. This blanket system vas re-

 Jected because of the high cost of manufacturing the pellets. It was estimated

that over 50 millions of pellebs would be required to fill the proposed blanket
volume of 100 cubic feet. \ | |
A solid uranium canned in stainless steel was investigated. ‘]‘hé ma..jqi'

edventages of this system is the high uranium concentration. This material was
rejected due to the high costs- of febrication. Typicel costs are sbout $9 per
kilogram for machining ura.nimnh and $7 per kilogram of uranium i‘or the addition
of the cladding material. | | | o

' Fused uranium selts would have been the logicel choice since fused sslts
were being used in the core. This would halve many of the problems confrorting
the desim. of the system such as corrosion, chemicel processing, etc. 'ihe
only fused salts which would glve a sufficlent concentra.tion of ﬁrdnitm in the

blenket were UCl, or '(JC:LI+ or a mixture of the two. Ucl3- has too high a melting

3
poiat, wkile UClh proved to be too corrosive. Even the UCL

(2)

3" UCllp. mixture was

felt to be too coxrrosive for e long life system, Hence this material was
eliminated.

A W, slurry was rejected due to the lack of knowledge of the properties
of the slurry ani the low uranium concentration due to engineering cdn.sidera-

tions.

The UOE-Na. paste was ultimately selected as the best available bla._nket material.

T™hie system has many of the features of the 002 pellet system w:l.th the omission |
of the cost of mamufecturing pellets. Although only & limited emount of work
has been done on pastes, the ocutlook is very promising. A an - Né. paste -offers
low febrication cost, ease of handling, high concentration of an a.nd good heat
tra._nsfer proPei'bigs « Froma ;pefsonal cénmunication with B.M. Abiaham of Argonne
Nationsl Leboratory, it was estimated that as much as 80% UO, by volume in

«32-

 
 

"

"

 

1iquid sodium is possible using a centrifugation process. We plan to use a
paste composed of 70% volume in the blanket system, The purpose of the liquid
sodiwm in the blanket is to improve the heat transfer properties., It is be-
lieved that Pu end U metal will be stable with liguid sodium and no reaction
occurs between Na and U0,. A major problem was the possibility of Na20
formation and its adverse corfosiva effects. This was solved by the addition

of corrosion inhibitors. A disgussion of this can be found in section 2.4.2.

2.3 REACTOR COOLANT SYSTEM |

The externally cooled system appears superior f.o the internally cooled
sys’ceni for a fused sall fast breeder reactor. In the exberhally cooled system,
the fuel mixtui*e is circuleted through a heat exchanger exbezﬁal to the reactor
vessel. The internally cooled system has heat transfer surfaces within the
reactor vessel; and heat is transferred from the fuel mixture to a fluid
coolant which In turn is cooled in an external heat exchenger.

2.3.1 Internal Cooling

A possible adventage of the internally cooled system is the lower inven-
tory of core fuel. However, due to the characteristically low heat transfer
property of fused salts, it wes calculated that elmost 50% of the core volume

wld be occupied by tubing and coolant in order to facilitate the required

cooling. The high percentage of tubing and coolant sffects this reactor system
in two ways; First the‘ parasitic capture is greatly increased and secondly,
the neutron energy spectrum is decidedly lowered. The above effects result in a

reduced breeding ratio in the core.

2.3.2 Externsl Cooling

The externslly cooled system was selected for use in the reactor system
investigated. The deciding factor in the choice was that a breeding ratio
of 1.20 was estimated in the externally cooled system compared to only
0.8 for the internally cooled system. This higher breeding ratio ie obtainable
because of sbout 15% greater blanket coverage, less parasitic capture and
highér neutron energy spectrum. Another factor in favor of external cooling

is the ease of replacement of equipment in case of a heat exchanger failure.

2., MATERIAIS OF CONSTRUCTION

The choice of materlals of construction in most reactor syst;ms is
qulite difficult because of the lack of corrosion data in the presence of
radiatidn fields. In spite of the lack of technological development, an effort
vas made to select the materials of construction for this reactor system.

The core vessel will be a nickel-ﬁolybdenum alloy, which is presently
in the development stage. For the other parts of the core s&stem such as the
primary heat exchanger and piping, a nickel-molybdenum alloy cladding on
stainless steel appears to be satisfactofy. The blanket system will utilize
stainless steel throughout. 'As far as the reactor components gp, it can be
generslly said that all the components in contact with the fused salt shall
be nickel-molybdenum clad or constructed of nickel-moly and all components in
contact with sodium are to be constructed of stainless steel.

Tests are now in progress at the ORNL Corrosion Laboratory to obtain
some datse on the corrosion of the fused salt of this system on nickel and

inconel at 1350°FF.

2.4.,1 Core System
Since the operating temperature of the fused salt shall be as high

as 1350°F, the choice of construction materials was severely limited. A further
limitation was imposed by the sbsence of corrosion data of fused chlorides |
bﬂ'structural metals."The.possibilit;es:which existed were inconel, nickel-
moly clad on stainless, hastelloy metals, or nickel-molybdenum alloys of the
hastelloy type which currently are under development

In selecting the best material, much dspendence was placed on the individual

chemical and physical préperties_of these possibilities with respect to the

=35

 
 

fused chloride fuvel,

The hastelloy metals were rejected due to the inability to fabricate the
material because of brittleness. Inconel was eliminated for the ﬁbst part
because of its known diffusion of chromium from the 8lloy in fluoride salts.

In addition the corrosion data of inconel in the tampgrature range of intareét
is lacking. It is felt that these disadvantages overbalance the high tech-
nological development and good physical properties of inconel.

| The use of nickel-molybdenum alloy cledding on’staiﬁless steel sppeaxs very

favorable in the fused chloride system.
| It is expected that this alloy will not exhibit dissimiler metal mass

transfer and will be capable of being welded to stainless steels by use of
special equipment, On the basis that this slloy will have the properties as

described, it is being recommended for the core system.

204.2 Blarnket sttem

- The construction material for all equipment in contact with the
sodium such as ig present in the blanket will be stainless steel. Since the
blanket is to'be composed of a UO,-Na paste, it was feared that the sodium
would become contaminated due to the formatipn of Hazo in the presence of
free oxygen. At elevated temperatures, nazo is very corrosive; it reacts with
all the common metals, platimm metals, graphite and ceramics. The relative
degree of reactivity with the structural materials would be the following,
from the most attacked to the least: Mo, W, Fe, Co and Ni. In addition it
 1s believed that uazo would be strongly ebsorbed on.most‘metal'surfaees,

It 1s possible that since Nay0 is known to act as 2 reducing agent for
some metals and an oxidizing agent for others, the presence of some material

will reduce Nas0 to Na before it attacks the metal, Such & corrosion inhibitor

~36-

 
 

0

o)

n

)

 

 

would solve this dilemma, The two common reactor materials, uranivm and
beryllium could possibly serve as the inhibitor. Thermodynamically, each reacts
readily with Hazo to form the metallic oxide and free sodiwum. At 500°C the
free energy of formation for beryllium and uranium are -6 Kcal per mole and
-75 Keal per mole respectively.
The rate of these resctions has not been ihvsstigatedsexsspt indirectly
in & series of corrosion tests at KAPL5’6, These tests show that both Be
and U are corroded many times faster than any of the structural metals tested.
The metals included nickel, molybdemm, inconel, monel, 347 siainless steel
and 2-8 aluminum. Thus the addition of.either pure urenium or beryllium to
the UOZ-Ha paste should offer a high degree of resisfance to the possible corro- |
sion by the Ea20 which will be formed during irradiation. |
2.4.3 Reactor Components

In general, all cdmponeﬂts in contact with the fused chloride fuel will

be constructed of nickel moly alloy c¢led stainless steel, All reactor camponents
in contact with sodium will be constructed of stainless steel. |

CHAPTER 3 ENGIHNEERING
3.1 GENERAL

The reactor proper, as shown in Fig. 3.1, is a 120-inch 0.D. svhere

consisting of & blanket region and a core, The core is a 733-inch 0.D. sphere

with a %-inch wall designed to withstand a differential pressure of 50 psi.

The core inlet nozzle on the bottom and the outlet nozzle on the top are

_reinforged. The inlet has a series of screens to distribute the flow thru the

" core so that a scouring action is achieved.

Immediately outside the core shell is a one inch reflector of molten
lead in & -}-1nch stainless steel container. The f11ling or draining of the
molten lead is accomplished by pressurized helium, | |

The first blanket region is 2 3/4 inches thick and is followed by 5 1/8
inches of moderator, another 5 5/16 inches of blanket and finally 8
1nches of graphite reflectqr. The blanket iz a uranium dioxide;sodium‘paste |
and the moderator is graphite clad with 1/8 inch of stainless steel,

The reflector, blanket and moderator are cooled by molten sodium passing
thru 4-inch 0,D. tubing.

The core heat output is 600 megawatts, and it is removed by circulating
the fuel thru a single pump and external heat exchanger with a minimum of

- piping. The cooling circuit is fabricated using all-welded comstruction. The

fuel solution is heated to 1350°F as it flows up thru the core and is returned

‘to the core at 1050°F,

Any differential expansion will be absorbed in a pivoted expansion joint,
The'Blankat heat output is approximately 100 megawatts and it 1s removed
by eirculating molten sodium which enters the blanket at 1050°F and leaves

.the core, the blanket cooling-system‘haS’one punp, one heat exchanger, uelded
Piping and a pivoted expansion joint.

The combined core and blankst system has three solid leg supports on the
blanket, Constant load hangers will carry the remaining load at four lugs
provided at tﬁe upper core elbow, at the core heat exchanger and at each end
of the blanket heét exchanger; |

The basement floor of the reactor_building,-és shown in Fig, 3.3, will
have & series of duhp\tanks for the salt, The reactor floor and the main floor

will be constructed of removable. stesl panels, The reactor room and the base-

ment room will be below ground_lével and contained in a steel lined concrete structure.

The réactor building main floor will have television facilities-éndqa
remotely operated erane and will be enclosed in a 60 ft. diameter, one inch
thick steel shell. The steel shell is = éafety'measure and will prevent the
pollution of the atmosphere by radioactive materials in the event of an accident.
The steel shell, which will withstand 50 psi, will have two large airtight

hatches for equipment removal.

The blanket heat exchanger secondary sodium lines are siamesed with the
core heat exchanger sodium lines and the resulting 42 inch O.D., lines are con-
nected to the shell side of a once-thru boiler.

The U-shaped boiler and the sodium pumps are located in a shielded boiler

room between the reactor building and the turbo-generator portion of the plant.

-The layout of the turbo-generator and auiiliaries follows the convéntional
power plant design with two exceptions: an outdoor turbine floor with & gantry
crane and placeﬁant of the deasrator on the turbine floor because of the
élimination of the boiler superstructure.

3.1.1. Properties of Fused Salt, Sedium Coolent, and Blanket Paste

The éngineering properties of the fused Salt, godium coolant and
the UOp-Na paste blanket have been estimated by the follbwing methods. The

viscosity of sodium? are giveﬁ in Figures 3.5, 3,6, 3.7 end 3.8 respectively,

The density of U0, was~taksn as 10.2 gm/bc.and'it'was_assumed that this re-

3.2 REACTOR POWER

The reserve capacity of an electric power system averages about 10 per
cent of the system load, To'mgke such a system relisble, no single unit should
exceed 10 per cent of the system capacity. Since most'of the systems in this
country are less than BOOOIMW'eapacity, turbo-generator units in excess of
280 M4 have not been built yet,

A reactor supplying steam for a single turbo-génsrating unit with a
system thermal efficiency of 40 per cent would be sized at 700 M{ of heat, or
also 260'MW net electric 6utput because of auxiliary power requirements of 20 MW,
A system larger than 700 MW of heat would require more than one circulating
fuel heat exchanger. Two fuel heat exchangefs would require manifoiding and
other flexibility provisions which would result in a gfeat increase in fuel
hold-up. Furthermore, too high a power level would involve such a large initial

investment that the risk of construction would not be Qarranted.

3.3 DESIGN OF HEAT TRANSPORT SYSTEM

Reference is made to Fig. 3.14 and Fig. 3.15, the Heat Balance Diagram
and the Salt, Sodium, Steam, and Condensate Flow Diagram, respectiwvely.

The optimm design was approached by careful selection of &eeign points,

Single wall tubing was assumed throughout wvhich is in sgreement with the
present trend of design. OSmsall leakage of water or steam into the sodium in

the boiler is not expected'to cause serious difficulty(lg).

Detection may
be accomplished by providing a gas collecting chamber and off-take in the
sodium return line. Build-up of NaOH in the sodium system should not be
difficult to follow and replacement or purification of the sodium can be under-
taken as it may eppear necessary. |

The influx of large amounts of water or eteem resulting from a major
failure would dangerously increase the pressure in the shell; and although
this possibility 1s remote, safety valves will be provided.

 Excessive fluid velocities result in erosion, corrosion, vibration and

increased preesure drop. Based on past experiences in the field ) the maximum
velocity was taken as J900/S" ft./sec., wh_ereg is the specific gravity of
the fluid. | o

Fluid-fuel reactors, especie.lly those with external cooling, are part-
icularly liable to be shut. down for repair or replacement of equipment (13 )
It is highly des 1_rable, therefore, that gll components be as s:l.mple end as de~
pendatle as ',.pos'si'ble jbut also able to be '_epeedi‘ij reple_eed or remotely main-
tained. It is eansiaerea undesireble to install valves in the large lines be-
tween the core a0 blanket heat exchangers and the p‘lmps to permit shut-off

‘more probable that these valves would fail before trouble is experienced at

thé héat exchangers or pumps.

Since no maintenance can be attempted with radiocactive fluids 1n the re-
actor and since it is not expected that any reactor part will-last‘five years
without requiring replacement or repair, provisidns will be made to inspect
21l components thoroughly at leaSt'evary two years, i.e., when feﬁlacing the

core heat'exchanger.

3.3.1 Circulating Fuel Heat Exchanger

To reduce external hold-up, small tube sizes are desirable in the

heat exchanger., The $-inch 0.D. tube size was selected as a practical

minimm. For sizes less than % inch, considerable difficulty would arise in
fabrication of the heat exchangers while the possibility of plugging would be
greatly increased. The wall thickness of 50 mils was assumed to provide
corrosion resistance for two years of useful life.

For the secondary heat transfer fluigd, a‘medium was required with good
heat transfer properties in order to reduce the external‘holdaup and with high
boiling point to permit operation at high temperature and low pressure to re-
duce capital_cﬁsﬁs.

Sodium,-lithiuﬁ, NaK, bismuth, lead and mercury were considered as heat

trensfer media, Sodium was selected because of its good heat transfer pro-

perties, high boiling point, 1ow.coét,.ava11ab111ty, comparative ease of handling

and wide technological experience, The disadvantages of sodiwm arejits violent
reaction with water and the catastrophic_corrosion rate of Na,O0.
‘The following considerations were used to set the temperature limits for
the fluids entering and leaving the core and heat exchangers.

The coolant temperature is not to be less than the liquidus temperature

core and heat exchanger were set by economic, corrosion and engineering.con-
siderations, Low fusl outlet temperature would lead to excessive heat ex-
changer surface which would adversely affect the fuel inventory and increase |
the possibility of‘QQSB transfbr. High fuel outlet temperature would increase
the corrosion rate, require higher pumping power and increase the thermal
stresses, Low sodium outlet temperature Qould result in excessive thermal
stresses and lower thermal cycle effidiencya High sodium outlet temperature
would have the same result as low fuel outlet temperature.

The fuel outlet temperature was set af 1350°F to ensure reasonable equip-
ment life and the maximum temperature differential between fuel and sodium was
set at 300°F, which is in agreement with genefal design practices. |

The heat exdﬁanger is a single pass counterflow exchanger approximately
50 inches in dismeter and 20 feet long with 3500 tubes. All tubes will be
made from a corrosion resistant nickel-molybdemm alloy (ebout 80% Ni and 20%
Mo). The exchanger shell will be constructed of stainless steel with a 4 inch
Ni-Mo cledding. | |

The,remdfal and replacemenl of the core heét'exchangar requires remote

handling which is believed to be entirely feasible.
3.3.2 ;rculating Fuel Piging and Pump

The pipe size selected was 24-inch 0.D, with a one-inch wall thickness.

To reduce cost, the pipe material will be stainless steel clad on the inside

with & corrosion resistant Ni-Mo alloy.' Cladding thickness will be 4 inch to
provide & corrosion sllowance for five years life. To allow differential thermal
expansion, a pivoted expansion Joint 1s'pfo#ided.

‘A single pump arrangement was selected, because two circulating fuel
pumps would require two check valves, four shut-off valves and added proiisions
fdr flexibility. This wbuld increase the external hold-up and because of valve

stem 1eakage probabilities, would lower the system reliability. However, if

large, relisb le valves becone availéble; it might be advantageous to have the -

added flexibility afforded by‘ﬁultiple cooling systems. This is a matter for
further development. | |

'A canned-rotor.pump was selected instead'of a shaft-seal pump due to the
greatly reduced possibility of leakage. The fuel pump will run at constant
speed becaﬁée of its canned-rotor construction. A variable speed pump would

be preferable but this also requires further develoyment.
~ 3.3.3 Blanket Heat kxchanger

The blanket heat exchanger is a sodium to sodium exchanger constructed
of stainless steel and whose mean temperature difference iz 150°F. It has
1570 tubes of 4-inch 0.D, which are 7% feet long with 50-mil walls.

It was deemed necessary to have an intermediate loop on the_blanket system
due to the activation of the sodium coolant, Thus, in case of a sodium-water
reaction, only radioactively cool sodium would be ejected. The choice of
sodiﬁm as a secondary blanket coolant was deemed advisable since the core second-
ary coolant and the blanket secondéry coolant, could be mixed,.thué necessitating

only one boiler and a slight amount of manifolding. For this same reason, the

 secondary sodium is designed to have a 150°F temperature rise through the heat

excﬁanger (QCOQF to 1050°F), thus matching the core sodium,

In blenket region 1, there are 940- % inch stainless steel tubes whose
centers lie on circles of radii 38.4, 39.1 and 39.9 1n¢hes. Each row contains
equal mmbers of tubes which have an effective length of 8 ft. Under these
conditions, the maximum possible paste temperature will be 1396°F which is well
below the refractory temperature of 18320F, |

In blanket region 2, there are 630- 4 inch stainless steel tubes whose
centers lie on circles of radii 51.8, 53.5 and 55.3 inches. Each row conteins
equal numbers of tubes which have an effective length of 10 ft. The maximum
paste temperature in region 2, under these conditions, will be 1468°F,

In region 1, the cooling tubes occupy less than 30 per cent of the avail-
able volume while in region 2 the tubes occupy less than 15 per cent of the

available volume.

The total pressure drop in the blanket is 145 ft, of head. Thié
includes the losses throﬁghthe blanket tubes, four plemum chambers, 10.67 ft.
of 18.inch 0.D, pipe, four elbows, one expansion joint, heat exchanger tubes,
blanket tube sheets and heat exchanger tube sheets.

The blanket sodium pump is a rotary pump with a capacity of 18,700 Gm
of sodium ageinst a 145 ft. head. With a2 pump efficlency of 70 per cent, the
motor required for the pump is a nominal 1000 hp.

The blanket is filled by pumping the UO,-Na paste into the blanket vessel,
under a helium pressure of 100 psi., prior to the reactor start-up. The blanket
will be completely filled-and any expansion of the paste will be taken up in
the blanket expansion tank.

To empty the blanket, part of the paste will be forced out, using 100 ps{.
helium., Pure sodium will then be used to dilute_and vash out the remainder
of the paste. When enough sodium is added, the paste will aésﬁme the properties

of a slurry and will flow'quite easily.

3.3.6 Sodiwm Piping and Pumps

The pipe sizes selected are 18-inch 0.D, for the blanket heat ex-
changer and 42-inch 0,D, for the main lines to the boiler. The piping materisal |
will be stainless steel. Sodium valves located in the lines will be plug~type
with freeze seals.

Canned-rotor pumps were selected in preference to the electro-magnetic
pumps because of their higher efficiency. The total flow is 114,000 Gmm, which
requires at least four pumps with 28,500 Gm. and 65 ft. head.

Provisions are made to drainland storé ell sodium in the event of a shut-
down. A one~foot thick concrete shield surrounds the sodium system including
the boiler. The sodium pumps will be shielded so that they can be drained and

replaced individually without denger to personnel.

3.4 SALT DWMP SYSTEM

A 821t dump system is provided consisting of two valved drain lines, one

for the core and one for the heat exéhangerv and p:lping.- The lines are 12 inches
| and 8 inches, respectively, and are sufficient to drein the entire system in
four seconds.

The dump tanks will have a combined capacity of 10 per cent in excess of
the total circulating fuel volume., The tanks will be compartmentalized to
keep the fuel suberitical; and cooling provisions will be provided to remove
decay heat. Electric heating elements will be included to prevent the fuel
from solidifying.

The fuel will be removed from the dump tanks by a 5 Gpm., 130 ft. head
punp either back to the core or to a contalmer to be shipped for processing.

The tanks, piping and pump will be comstructed similarly to the main eir-

culating fuel system, i.e., nickel-molybdenum alloy cled stainless steel to

 

provide an allowable corrosion resistance for 10 years of useful 1ife,

3.5 CORE VESSEL AND REFLECTOR HEATING

ih this system, as in most reactor systems, the internal generation of
heat in the core vessel due to gamma and neutron interactions with thelmetal
was found to be appreciable. The energy sources considered for this calculéfion
were prompt fiséiohigémmas, decay product gamﬁas, and neutrons of energies
greater than 0,12 Mev, .The inelastic scattering gammas in the fuel and the core
vessel were estimated as negligible with respect to the magnitude of the con-
sidered sources. These sources gave a gamma spectrum as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Using this integral spectrum and assuming it to be unchanged in space
we applied the Inﬁegral Beam Approximation method(IS) (Appendix A~7). The heat
generation rate in the core vessel and reflector was calculated as a function
of position. The gamma absorption coefficients of the fused salt (Fig. 3.18)
and of the nickel-molybdemum alloy (Fig. 3.19) were computed fdr use in this
calculation. The gemma heat generation rate as a function of position is
shown in Fig. 3.20.

The heat generation due to neutron capture, elastic scattering, and in-
elastic scattering were caloulated using_the-integral fluxes from the Univac
caleculations with the general equation' | |

flector. It was found that approximately one third 6f the total heat genersation
in the core vessel was due to gemma ;nteractions. Using thesé averaged heat
generation rates a maximm temperature rise of 109.3 °F was estimated for the
core vessel (Fig. 3.21). Since such a température rise was believed to cause
abnormally high thermal stresses, it was decided to coal the lead reflector.

This gave a maximum temperature rise in the core vessel of 29,2°F (Fig. 3.22).

This was estimated to yield permissible thermal stresses.

In all these calculations the core vessel was taken to be 1.3 em. thick;

and the leed reflector, 2.5 cm, thick.

In order to maintain the 29,2°F tempefature rise in the core shell and
to minimize the thermal stresses, it was postulated that both surfaces of the
core vessel be maintained at the same temperature of 13509F and that heat be
removed from the reflector to accomplish this., It was also postulated that
both surfaceé of the reflector are at 1350°F. Using these conditions it was
found that 5.2 x 1013 Mbv/me-sec will be removed from the lead reflector.

Q = 5.2 x 10'2 Mev/emPsec = 3.80 x 10° BTU/Ar. = 1.11 Mi. |

Using a row of blanket cooling tubes we have & sodium flow of 83,500 1lbs/

hr. through 17 1/2-inch OD tubes with 50 mil walls, The heat transfer cal-

culations show that this is more than adequate to tfansfer the heat.

hr.
flow of 1.13 x 10° 1bs. is required to maintain the maximm temperature of the
- ,

 

graphite at 1325°F, The sodiun flow rate is accomplished in 25 4-inch cooling
tubes with 50 mil walls.

3.7 ONCE-THRU BOILER

The once-thru bojler is well éﬁited to the high temperature reactor plant,
since load conditions can be controlled by varying the flow of water. If the
reactor follows its load demand well, it can be conirolled directly by the
turbine throttle, Thus, operation of the plﬁnt is greatly simplified. However,
the once~thru boiler is not yet well developed and‘in this case.is operating
very near the burn-out point. This is perhgps one qf the weakest points in the
design., It definitely requires further atﬁdj and possibly another intermediate
sodiunm loop to lower the inlet sodium temperature to the boiler. This type of
boiler requires very puwre feed water of ieés.than-%-ppm. impurity pnésent.

The boilér is in the form of a shell aﬁa tﬁbe, cqunter current,rone-pass
heat exchanger with the 2400 psi stesm on the tube eide. There are 2400 tubes
which are $-inch 0,D., 45 ft. long, with a 50 mil wall, The entire boiler will
be made of stainless stéel which_is.résiétant to attack b} both hot_sodium and |
super heated steam, The tubes ére in e tniangular lattice with a 1,11 inch
pitch vhich léaves suffiéientrdom for welding the tubes into the tube sheet.

The inside shell diamster is 4.9 f%., and fts wall thickness is ome inch
which is sufficient to hold the sodium. The overall shell length is 50 ft.

 were calculated using the Dittus-Beelter equatibn

which includes two 24 ft. plemums., The boiler was made into a U-shape in
order to reduce the size of the boiler.roam; o

The design vas ecoomplished by breaking the boiler ipto three distinct
fégions-a sub-oboled reglon, a boiling region and a superheated regidn. Thié'
is bnly an approximation as it 1s'mainly a philosoﬁhical point as to where sub-
cooled boiling ends and net boiling begihs. The heat transfer coefficlents
(14), and a method of J. A,
Lane(16) was used in the bolling region.

In calculating heat transfer coefficients, use was made of inlet velocities
only. This is clearly an underestimate, and the excess aurfe.e‘e. ghould account
for the resistance of the scale to heat transfer.

At part-load operation, this boller tends to produce steaﬁ di higher than
design temperature. The steam temperature to fhe turbine will be maintained

constant by attemferation end veriation of the boiler feed water température.

The part-load operating characteristics of the boiler are given in the following

3.8 AUXILIARY COOLING SYSTEM

If the electric load 1s dropped to zero, 1t becomes necessary to remove
delayed heat from the reactor core and blanket., An auxiliary cooling system
1s provided for this, comsisting of a separate sodium circuit, a sodiwmm-to-air

heat exchanger and a pump.
3.9 TURBO-GENERATCR

A tendem-compound, triple flow, 3600 rmm. turbo-generator with initial
steam conditions of 2400 psig. and 1000 F was selected. Since & straight-thru
boiler is being used, there is no reheat. The latter generally is not too
desirable for nuclear power plants because of the attendent complicated controls.

The feed water cycle will consist of six heaters with the deserator in
number three place. The final feed water temperature is 550°F, Three condensate
and three boliler feed pumps ere specified to insufe the relisbility of the unit.

The thermal efficiency of the cycle is estimated to be 40 per cent. Auxil-

lary power requirements are estimated to be seven per cent,

 GHAPTER 4 NUCIEAR CONSIDERATIONS
4.1 SOMMARY OF STUDY INTENTIONS

| At the onset of the project, tﬁo codling syﬁtems for a fused salt reactor

were considered, One was an internally cooled system in which the coolant,
- lquid sodium, was passéd through the core of the reactor. The other was an
externally cooled reactor in vhich the fuel was circulated through a heat ex~
changer enternal to the core. It was felt that the 1arge fuel_inyentory of
a»fast reactor would be increased to & prohibitive amount in the circulating
fuel system, Howévar, eerly calculations showed, that because of the large
amount of parasitic sbsorption, the total inventory of the internally cooled
system was about thé same as that of the circulating System. Poorer bianket
coverage, more parasitic capture and lower spectrun caused the internally cooled
system to have a breeding ratio estimated to be about 0,8 compared to an esti-
mate of about 1.2 for the circulating system., The lower spectrum would also
increase the fission product pbisoning. For these reasons and since the only
advantage attributed to the internally cooled system, lower 1nven£ory, did not
exist, 1t was decided to conduct parameter studies solely for mixed chleride
fuels in an externally cooled systen,

Preiiminary analysis (sec. 4.4.1) indicated that power output per mass
of plutonium increased with increased power. A core power of 600 M{ was choéen
ag 1t is the upper 1limit imposed by existing electric power distribution systems,
Engineering considerations ylelded & minimum external hold-up volume for the
removal of 600 Mi. This volume is so large that it remains essentially constant
over a wide variation of core sizes.

With the external hold-up volume constant a study was carried out on system

Cl3, which is the highest concentration of Pu () 013 in the mixed chloride
commensurate with melting point requirements was, therefore, used in the pare-
meter study with variation on the ratio of plutonium to uranium, The analysis
was carried out employing a ten group, one dimensional diffusion theory'method
(sec. 4.2.1) on the bare core system to find the bare core radius, breeding
ratios, and flux energy spectrum, Blanket cross sections were then averaged
over this spectrum to obtain an approximation of reflector savings on eritiesl -
core radius, rientzz has shown the validity of diffusion theory calculations
for fast reactor systems with dimensions greater than 30 em,

| Since the blanket material chosen has a low uranium density, an effort
was mede to lower the neutron spectrum in the blenket to increase the plutonium
production density and decrease the blanket thickness. Position and thickness
of = graphite moderator section, placed in the blanket region, were varied

to study results on btreeding ratio and concentration and distribution of plut-
onfun production as well as the effects reflected back into the core. The
Argonne National Lab. RE-7 code fbr ‘the UNIVAG (Sbc. 4+2.3) was used for this

The calculation of the bare system criticality was therefore reduced to
e tabulation of neutron events with an iteration on the geometric buckling;
B, until & neutron balance was obtained over all energy groups. The calculation
begins with the introduction of one fission neutron distributed over the fission
spectrum. In the Pirst (highest energy) group this is the only source of
neutrons so that the events in this group can be tabulated, Group 1 then ﬁro—
vides the balance of the source for the second group through scattering, hence
the events in the second group can be determined., This procedure was continued
for each lower emergy group. At the conclusion of thé lowest energy group

chosen and the calculation repééted until the neutron production and loss were
equal.

In the calculation just described, st eriticality, the source of neutrons
for each energy group multiplied by the average velocity of that group times

4.2.2 Reflector Savings Estimate

The flﬁx energy spectrum obtained for the bare core was assumed, for
the reflector savings estimate, to be the equilibrium blanket flux energy spee-
trum, Averaging blanket paramaters over this spectrum and assuming an infinite
blanket the reflector savings was found to be insensitive to the bare core |
radius and bare core spectrum over the range of interest. For the study of
systen mass, bre;ding.fatids-and flux ensrgy spectrum as a function of the plut- |
oniwm to uranium ratio, the reflgctof savings on the bare core‘radius.was assumed

to be ﬁ‘constant.

- 4e2.3 UNIVAC Calculations
In order to obtain a better representation of the effect of the blanket

 
 

 

énthe core and to gain information on the desirability of a moderstor section
in the blankbt'region,thg Re=7 Argonne National Leboratory code for the UNIVAC
was employed, The iteration in this code was performed on the fuel to diluent
ratio rather than the core radius. The optimm system core radius from the
previous perameter study and seven regions (core, core vessel, lead reflector,
first blanket, moderator, second blanket and graphite reflector) were used.
Extra lower energy groups were employed because of the lover energy spectrum
in the blanket. |

The input information, calculation procedures and resirictions of the BE-V
code are covéred in reference 23. The results of the problem consisted of
the criticel fuel to diluent ratio, the criticality factor, the fiséion source
at each space point, the integral of the fission source over each region, the
flux at each space point in each energy group, the integral flux over each

region in each energy group, and the net leakage out of each region in each

energy group.

4.3 CROSS SECTIONS

403.1 Energz GI'O“EQ

For the UNIVAC calculations thirteen energy groups were employed.
These are presented in Table 4,1, sectlion 4.3.4. The last four groups were

combined into one group in the bare ten group paremeter study.
Le3.2 Sources of Data

A1l total end fission cross sections as well as the (n, gamma) of
uvranium-238 and the (n, alpha) of chlerine were obtained from BNL-325. The
capture cross section of plutonium was calculated using values of =¢ employed
in réfbrence 2. 7The inelastic.scattering cross section of uwranium and plut-
onium were obtained through & private commutication with L. Dresner of (RNL,
These values were based on the experimental wofk of T, W, Bonner of Rice Imstitute,
M. Welt of LASL end R. 0. Allen of LASL. The sources of other imelastic scatter-
ing cross sections are references 25, 26, and 27. The spectrum of inelastically
scattered neutrons was tsken, for all elements, to be Maxwellisn in form with
the temperature of thé distribution give-n by the equation e:J-E- -~ C’, vhere E

¢ was teken aé 0,08 Mev for high energy meutrons and extrapolated to zero ét

incident neutron energies of 1.5,'3 and 14 Mev. |

uranium~238:wbre obtﬁined fram-refbrénce 29. A&ditionﬁl values for these elements

4e3.3 Calculation of Capture Cross Sections

Because of the lack of experimental determination of capture eross
sections at the emergies of interest (.001 to 10 Mev), a theoretical, energy
dependent equation employing persmsters which can be estimeted with some
accuracy was normalized to data by Hughes31 of capture cross ‘sections at 1 Mev,

L. RESULTS OF THE PARAMETER STUDIES

For an externally cocled sjrste;n, the_#;mdmim power which can be re-
moved is proporticnal to the volume of the holdeup in the external heat ex-
changer. The system mass of plutontum 1s proportiomal to the total of the
system. Hence, an increase in the power removed at a given core volm results
in en increase in the ratio of power to the system mass of plutonivm, There-
fore, the lowest inventory cost ig cbtained with the maximm power out=put.

Engineezji.ng considerations yielded an external hqld.-fu;p volume of 3510
liters for a core power of 600 Mi, which was considered to be the maximm de-
girable. Witk this external volwme constant, & preliminary anslysis was pere
formed to minimize the mass of plutonium. One ten group, bare core caleulation
wvas performed with a wranium to plutonium ratio of wnity in order to obtain a
typical core spectrum. This spectrm was uséd to avemgé core parameters for a
"one-speed” parameter study ef system mass of pltrbnoimn variation with core gize.

( _ x UC1,, where x is the ratio of uranium to plutonium, N(28)/N(49). OCal-
ciiﬁiions were performed for various values of x to obtain bare core eritical
mass, core flux energy spectrum, internal breeding ratio, and the met core
leakage which was used to obtein the maximum external breeding'ratio.

The feflected core critical mass variation with the reflected core radius
is plotted as Fig. 4.2. Note that the equation for M, in section 4.4.1 is of
the form

M = kR + kR
where‘kg/kl 1s about 10~7 so that for R less than 100 cm the deviation from
linearity should be less than 10 percent. This behavior i1s seen in Fig. 4.2
which is the result of multi-group treatment.

The system mass of plutonium obtained from the multi-group calculations
is given on Fig. 4.1 together with the prediction of section 4.4.1. It is
seen that the shapes of the two curves are similar and £hat the minimums fall
at the same reflected core radius, This indicates the validity of the assumption,
which was made in the preliminary analysis, that the parameters, when averaged
over the core spectrum, were insensitive to a change of core radius,

The system mass of plutonium and thé'breeding'rdtios are plotted as a
function4of x on Fig. 4.3. Core flux-e#ergy spectrums for x equal to 0 and 1
are given as Fig. 4.42 and x equal to 2 and 3 as Fig. 4.4b. The rapid 1ndre§se
of the system mass of plutonium as xrdecreasas frog_z vas considered to far
outweigh the advantages gccrued from the higher breeding ratio and the higher-
flux.energj spectrum., Thus the.Optimum system was‘¢hosen to ocdur with x equal

to 2.

 
 

 

4.h.3 Reflector Control
In & reactor with a high core leakage, control can be affected by

changing the fraction of the out~-going core leakage which is returned. Using
& molten lead reflector 1n vhich the level is varled, the 1argest contribution '
t0o control is due to the creatien of & void surrounding the core., This void
results in some of the neuwtroms reflected by the blenket, which ig now separated
from the core, to reenter the blenket directly. The change of reﬂeetion co~
efficlent due to the separation of the bla.n.ket fram the core is calculated assuming
that the neutrons leave the blanket in e cosine epatial distribution. In terms of
the reflection coefficlent with no separation the effective coefficient with & void
surrounding the reactor core is given by

o te_Be

R+t (1 =)

where R 1s the core radius ani t 1s the thickness of the void shell., The
spproximete values of of , t and R used in the system were oC egual to 0.5,
t & 2.5 cm, and R equalto 92 cm. ‘Eor thege values, ocl is equal to 0.493.
Since the nev core leakage is epproximately one half the core neutron pro-
duction,

bbb Effect of a Molerator Section in the Elanket Reglon
| To determine the effect of a graphite moderator section in the blanket
region, UNIVAC calculations employing seven spatiel reglons end thirteen energy
groups were carried out. For a constant total volume of moderator and blanket,

ﬁgl]--'-

sl

 

variations were mafe on moderator thickness snd position.

The core flux energy spectrum with no moderator present in the blanket
region was identical with that obtained with the thickest moderator section
used, considered at its closest approach to the coré. Therefbré, the only con-
siderations in choosing an optimum system were the concentration of plutonium
production in the blanket énd the totsl breeding ratio. These two considerations
are shown in Figs. 4.5 and 4.6.

The effect of a moderator section on the outer blanket flux energy spectrum
is shown in Fig, 4.7. The effective capture cross section of uranium-238 in
the outer blanket is 1.45 barns with the moderator section present and 0,68
barns when blanket materiel wes substituted for the moderator.

Over the range of moderator thicknesses considered (0 to 13em), the total
breeding ratio varied only slightly whereas the average concentration of plut-
oniun production increased by a factor of about 1,6 with the average concen-
tration in the outer blanket increasing by a larger factor. Thus the maximum
moderator thickness of thirteen centimeters and the minimum inner blanket
thickness of seven centimeters were chosen for the final system because of
higher1awerage;concentration'and more uniform spatial distribution of the plut—

onium production in the blanket.

CHAPTER 5 CONTROLS

5.1 CGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The control of a fast reactor is no mcrc difficult thac that of & thermal
reactor. Even though the prompt neutron lifetime is much shorter in a fast
reactor, the delayed neutrons are still the controlling factor. It is the nmumber
of delayed neutrons aveileble that determines the ease with thich the reactor
is controlled. In & plutonium fusled reactor there is less than one-half the
number of delayed neutrons thct'are availskie in a reactor using 238 for fuel.
Also; & circulating fuel reactor reduces the effective number of delayed neutrons
aveileble for control because- some are born in the loqp outside the core and are
lost to the system. Therefore, the main difference between the_control of & fast
end thermsl reactor is in the method of control.

One method of control is with the use of & neutron absorber. This method
is not generally satisfacgory for fast reactors_bccause of the low capture
cross sections for neutrons in the high energy spectrum. Ehis.requires that e
largc amount of ebsorber material be moved.in a relatively short tiﬁe. Also,
the conversion ratio ln a fast breeder reactor is lowered.

Ancther mcthod of control is ﬁith the movement of fuel in the reactor. This
does not lower the conversion retio but does present the additibnal_pfoblems of
heving to remcve fhe heat generated in the qul rod and having to process
the rod. This method is not too practicable in e circulatﬂng fuel reactor.

The use of & movable reflector appears to be the most practicable method
of controlling & circulating fuel fast breeder resctor. This method has the
disadvantcéé of having to move a large mass of reflector material in e short
perioa of time. It also lowers the conversion ratio slightly. chever, this
method‘cf control was selected for the reactor under consideration in this

project.

5,2 DELAYED NEUTRONS

The control of & fast reactor with only pfampt neutrons available would
be extremely difficult because the avefagé lifetime of prompt neutroms im a
fast system is of the order of 10"6 seconds._when_delayad neutrons sre avail-
able, the average neutron lifetime in the system becomes approximately 10'2
seconds. This Increases greatly:the ability to control the reactor in a safe
manner., |

The ffaction of delayed neutrons emitted by the fast fission of plutonium- -
239 1s 0.0023 and of uranium-238 is 0.0176. From the nuclear celeculations
it was found that 5,7 percent of the total fissions sre from uranium-238 so
that the delay fraction, ﬁ?; is 0.0032.. This is the value when the fuel is
not being circulated.

In considering = circﬁlating fuel reactor, it is obvious that a part of
the delayed neutrons will bé émitted outside the core and therefore lost to
the system, The fraction of delayed neutrons that are useful to the circulating
fuel reactor under steady state conditions can be calculated fraﬁ the ratio of
the average concentration of delayed neutron precursors 1n the core to the
concentration of delayed neutron precursQrs in the core when fhe fuel o
is stagnant. This_fraction for the 1th delay group can be written as follows:37
ol - e}f';ﬁt )(,_C-Nfa)

MY \e e TNy N

where )\71 i1s the decay constant, t3 is the time spent in th‘e,core by the cir-

 

culating fuel, and t, is the time spent outside the core by the fusl. The
average ¢ was found to be 0,519. Since ome dollar of reactivity = d. (3’ =
0.0017, the reactivity dollar has been deflated mearly fifty percent due to

circulation of the fuel.

5.3 TEMPERATURE COEFFICGIENT OF REACTIVITY

Thé change in reactivity_du_e_ to a change in temperature is of impbrtance
to the stability and control of the reactor. The largest contribution to this
coefficlent of reactivity is from the expansion of the fused salt. The following
derivation is for an approximate value due to the change in density .of the

salt. ,

From the curve of fused salt density vs. temperature (°F), it was found

that

The average temperature of the fused salt in the core is 1200°F and the
average density is
| /‘5 = 2.5 g/om3 |
Hence i_kg_a‘zd = =3,3x 10"!* dT
and the temperaim‘_e coefficient of reactivity due to the expansion of the |
fused salt is negative and approximately | -
3.3 x 1074 per: °F
The above approximation was verified 'bj‘_a ten gfoup, three region machine
caleulation which féund the nsgative temperature_ coefficient of r'eactivity-

%o be 2.4 x 107% per °F,

Since there is mo experimental data on the ‘density of the fused salt being’
used in this reactor, it was felt that the high 'Ee'riiperahira densities as obtained
from theoretical calculations were not relieble, The temperature coefficient

«117-

 
 

 

of reactivity obtained using the theoretical densities appears to be on the

. high slde., Therefore, 3.3 x 10~% per °F wvas taken as en upper limit, The

lower 1imit used in simulator studies was 2 x 105 per OF., These values appear
to bracket the coefficients used in the design of gimilar reactors.

There are several other factors contributing to the coefficient of reactivity.
The expansion of the lead in a partially filled reflector due to a rise in’
temperature will give an increase in reactivity. A simple calculatidn was made
to determine the magnitude of this effect. It was assumed that the reflector
was & cylindrical shell 176 em high,

The'dhange in the density of lead due to a temperature changé was found
from Figure 5.140 to be

- 0.,00065 g/em>/°F

Therefore, /o= ﬁ-0.00065 T
where T is the change in temperature from T,.

If the reflector is ome half full at 1200°F and the temperatufe is increased
so the reflector level will reise ome cm, the weight of lead will remain con-
stant, so

2 Tr x zkdﬂ .2.1Tr(‘L/—:+I)J(f7 0-000(95"7)

Rearranging, T =

 

jO

= 10,22 g/em’ at 1200F

so T & 177°F rise,

If the total reactivity of the reflector is 0,016, then the average re-
sotivity per cm of height is 0.9 x 1074 per cm, Therefore, a 177°F rise in
temperature will raise the reactivity 0.9 x 107*, The temperature coefficient

~ of reactivity due to ths expansion of the lead reflector is then approximately

value of the negative coefficient used for expansion of the fused salt.

- The Doppler effbct‘l is another source of varlation of reactivity with

température.' The overall effect is to increase resonance cross sections with

~ an ircrease of temperature. Thus, the fissions in Pu?3? will be increased

with‘increasing temperature, leading to é positive temperature coefficient of
reactivity, This positiva coefficient is in part balanced by the negative

reoefficient of reactivity arising from the increased absorption in the Pu239.

023§'1ntrodnces a negative coefficient of reactivity so with the proper

balance of the'twb materiaels, the positive éoefficient can be cahcelled cut.'

Tt was found in a U235 system that to obtain a negative temperature coefficient

of reactivity, the ratio of 0238 to U235 nnclei would have to be greater than
1.9. In the reactor being studied, the ratio of U2° to Pu?3? 1s 2.0. Although
no calculation was made for the Pu®-? system, it appears that 1f the temperature
coefficiénﬁ»df reactivity due to the Doppler effbdt is still positive, 1t will

be small compared to that obtained from the density change in the fused selt.

5.4 REFLECTOR CONTROL

The lead reflector will be used primarily'for shiu control‘to ccmpensate
for burn-up of the fuel. This will allow the additiun of fuel at fixed intervale
rather than continuously ifr concentration control were used. The cperating
level of the_lead rerlectcr at the beginning of a burn up period will be at a |
point where only 0.0025-of reacti?ity can be added by completely fiiling‘the.;{
reflector. This will ailcw for ebout ten days of operation between edditionejjii
of fuel,

The dumping of the lead reflectcr can be used for normal ehut dcwns of
the reactor. However, the operating temperature of the fused ealt must be .
naintained during ghut down either by decay'heat or by the addition of external
heat. This is tc prevent the reactor from going critical due to the negative L
temperature coefficient of reactivity if the temperature drops. The dumping ‘;ii
cf the fused salt will occur only as an emergency screm or when the reactor -
requiree maintenance. Dumping cf the lead reflector fcr shut dcwn will reduce o

greatly the consequent start up time.:

5,5 SDMULATOR STUDIES

Simulator studies were run to determine the stability of the system under
changing load conditions. The load demand ﬁas varied from full load doﬁn to
1/6 loed in steps of 1/6. The load was then taken back up to one half load
and then to full load, Even though the load changes were msde much faster than
they could be changed in actual practide, the system proved to be veiy stable
under these conditions. This was becauée of the negative témperature coefficient
of reactivity and the large heat capacity of the system. The use of different
negativé temperature coefficients of reactivity only changed the time with
wvhich the system resporded to the load changes. o

Due to & lack of time, no method to hold the steam temperature at its
design point when the load was reduced was simulated. However, there are
several things that can be done, either wholly or in part, to maintain the steamx
temperature. The temperature of the boiler feed water can be reduced by reducing
the amoﬁﬁt of.steam to the boiler feed water heaters or also the steam temperaturé
can be reduced by attemperation. The auxiliary cooling system could be used
to remove parf of the heat., This design calls for constant speed pﬁmps but'if
variable speed pumps were avalilable they could be-used'to regulate the steam
temperature. The temperature of the reactor could be varied by the reflector
ghim control but there is a lowér limit to prevent freezing of(the fused salt,

The following diagram shows the design temperatures of the various loops
- in the system at full load. .

As seen in Fig. 5.2, the reactor power follows the load demand with
practically no overshoot with & negative temperature coefficient of reactivity

the load demand 1s varied.

A negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of 2.0 x 10~ was use&
to obtain the results shown in Fig. 5.4. Even with this small coefficient,
the reactor is stable but requires more time to reach equilibrium after a load
demand change, | .

5.6 STARTUP FROCEDURE

The following procedure is to be used when the core is empty and the re-

actor is to be sterted up. k

1. Bring blanket up to operating temperature by adding heat through | the blanket
ﬁeét exchanger, |

2, Heat fused salt to operating temperature in dump tanks. |

3. With the lead reflector empty and the source in the blanket;_begin pumping
the fused salt into the core, stopping at iﬁtervals to check criticality.
With the source in the blanket, the multipli¢ation constant is not very
sensitive to the addition of fuel until the reactor becomes nearly eritical,
At this point, more care must be exercised as criticality is approached.
The concentration of Pu must be such that when the core is completely filled
and at operating temperature, the multiplicetion constant is 0,95. The
pumping rate is 5 gpm which is adding reactivity at approximately 0.0001
per seconq. If a positive period is detected while filling the core, the
dump valve will be opened automaticaily. It is estimated £hét‘the solenoid
will operate in about 30 milliseconds and the core will empty in J seconds.

4. After the core 1s filled, finish filling the fused selt loop and start
the fuel circulating punp. Add heat through thé mﬁin heat exchanger to
keep the fuel at operating temperature. - -

5. Fill lead reflector to oﬁerating level, stopping at interwvals to check
griticality._ | |

6. Add Pu to bring reactor critical, This must be added in small amounts at
a point in the loop shead of the heat exchangefto obtain maximum difquiOn
In the salt before it enters the core. This dempens out the fluctuations

core. These fluctuations must not be large enough to put the reactor on a
prompt critical period. S |

T I:t‘ the meen témperature of the reactor is below the .operating temperature
aefter it has gone criticael, continue to add Pu until the reactor reaches

the operating tenmerature; Then control the temperature level by reflector

6.1 FPROCESS FLOW SHEETS
6.1.1 Core Processing

The core processing flow sheetAz’ 43, 4 is shovn in Fig. 6.1. Both
the core and blanket cﬁemical treatments employ a Purex-tjpe process as an
integral part of their processing-cycles. Since standerd Purex is a relatively
well-developed operation, 1t will mot be explained in detail and is shown as
a single block on the flow sheet. |

_The chemical process for the core is g;van in the following outline:

8. The fused salt is draimed from the core. After ®cooling" at the re-
ector site, it is transported to the processing plant. -

b. The solidified salt mixture is then aissplved in water using‘heat if
required. Proper precautions are employed to maintain subcritical conditions.

¢. Sodium hydroxide is introduced to precipitate the uranium, plutonium,
magnesium, and some fission products as hydroxides. After centrifugation, the
the filtrate solution of sodium chloride and éome fission~product chlorides
is discerded by approved waste-disposal techniques, provided the plutonium con-
tent is low enough. | | |

d. The precipitate is dissolved in acidie solution'buffered with emmonium
ioﬁ.

e. Ammonium hydroxide is introduced to a pH of 5-6 to precipitate the

uranium, plutonium, and some remaining fission products as hydroxides. After

centrifugation, the filtrate solution conteining most of the magnesium is again
disdarded, i1f the Pu content is acceptably low,

f. The precipitate is dissolved in nitric acid solution.

6.1.3 On-Site Fission-Product Removal

6.1.3.1 Off-Cas System

To make provision for the removal of fission-product gases, an
off-gas system must be included in the design of the reasctor complex. 1In
addition, it i1s suspected that some chlorine gas may be given off from the core
material, although the amount will probably be small., -

With the production of some chlorine assumed, the following outlineLB
desceribes an off-gas system on the bagis that some 9.4—yeaf krypton will be
formed and fhat'the reactor will not be located in a desolate region where dis-
persal techniques could be used. |

2. The gases from the circulating fuel loop are removed through a vent
at the top of the inlet plenum to the primary heat exchanger. No compressor
is required, since the core system is under pressure.

b. After passing through a filter and & cooler to remove entrained particles
and vapor, the gases go through a let-down valve. The salt from the filter
and cooler is returned to the core systenm.

¢. The gases next pass through an agueous or caustic scrubber and a silver
nitrate reactor to remove the chlorire.

d. The gases are dried at - 70°F to remove water vapor.

e. After passage through charcoal absorbent beds, &ll rare gases
are retained in the charcoal, If a carrier gas such as helium or nitrogen were
introduced subseQuent to the let-down valve, this gas-would‘then pass through
a CWS filter or equivalent and finally out of a stack;

Periodically, the éharcoal,beds would have tﬁ.be heated, and the rare
gases thus driven off would be stored in ﬁressufe eylinders. However, if the

..]_36.. ‘

amount of 9.4-year krypton were sufficiently small, buried pipes containing
charcoal at ambient temperature could be substituted for the refrigerated char-
coal beds and would provide sufficient holdup to allow decay of the rare gases

before release to the atmosphere.

- 6,1.3.2 Precipitation of Fission Products

After the reactor hasﬁbeen 15 operation for a time, iﬁ is poséibla
that certain fission products (presumably rare earths) will build wp fo con-
centrations exceeding their solubilities in the fused chloride core mixturé.
Thus, it is necessary to consider the removal of precipitating fission-product
chlorides. Lack of experimental data in this area requires qualitative treat-
ment of this problem,

Since fission~product concentrations will be building up rather slowly,
it seems reasonable that they could be kept below their solublility limits by
contimwous processing of & small side-stream from the circulating fuel loop,
This stream would be tapped off from the hot stream leaving the reactor core
end then passed through & small large-tube vertical heat exchanger cooled by
an»auxiliary'sbdium stream, The'chloride mixture would then g§-to one of tﬁo
filters in parallel where precipitates woﬁld be removed. Oné filternwculd be
on-stream vhile the solid material was baing removed from the other. |

Te 1nsure'effbct1ve removal of fission-product precipitates, 1t.wcu1d,be
necessary to cool the side stream to & temperature below the miﬁimum in the
circulating fuel lodp.- In order to preiént iﬁtroductien into the éére of a
gtresm with cold spots, the'side stream would be returned to the inlet plemm
of the main heat exchanger, sllowing time for mixing. |

6.2 CONSIDERATIONS LEADING TO FROCESS SELECTION
6.2.1 Processes Considered

Any attempt to select a chemiecal processing treatment for a reactor
systen ag broadly defined initially ag the onerdescribed in this report de-
pended upon the basic problems of core and blanket materials selection. Quite
naturally, every tentative cholce of materisls for either the core or the blanket
necessitated a preliminary investigation of the processing problems involved
in orderftc determine any excessive cost requirements or prohibitive operating
conditions, ‘

Although the nature of the reactor studiqd dictated the general type of

‘material in the core, there was a considerable degree of latitude in choosing

the blanket material, as indicatgd previously in the report. Under consideration
were uranium dioxide-sodium systems and canned solid uranium in addition to

fused uranium salts, Thus the chemical processes investigated included pyro-
metallurgical, volatilizetion, dlectrolytic, aqueous and other processes.

It became evident very early that any evaluation of most of the processes
considered would be hindered by two potent'f&ctors,,viz., lack of experimental .
data end non-existence of relieble cost data. Since the time to be spent qﬁ_
chemical processing during the course of the projest was limited, it was decided
that studies would be reétricted to those processes on which sufficient experi-

- mental and cost data were available to allow & rea}isticlappraigal.;_Uhfortunately,'

this decision almost automatically eliminated everything excépt agqueous processing,
The ebove decigion; however, was in 1line with the gemeral project philo-

sophy that the reactorsystemdesigned.would be ome for which a capability of

construction might reasonably be expected to exist in the next couple of years,

=139~ -
wm—————

 
 

 

In addition, it was felt that with the low fisslon-product capture cross séctions
in a fast reactor, it might be possible to process infrequently enough to make
aqueous processing économical by employing & centralized proceséing facility.

The vindicatioh of this idea appears later. (See Section 6.3.1). Actually,

this appfoach should be conservative,'since:economics will undoubtédly dictate
that the construction of any type of processing facility have no higher costs

than those estimated at present for aqueous plants.
6.2.2 Process Selection

Among the aqueous processes, the Redox and Purex processes have been
most widélj studied and are feasible for plant-scale construction. Data on
\othefaquéous processes are not widely available, and it seems unlikely that
much cost advantage could be obtained with any of them, Of the Redox and Purex
procésses, the latter is more economical; and thus, it was selected as the basis
for chemical processing to separate uranium, plutonium, and fission products.

" Before the cholce of Purex could be finalized, however, several problems bad
to be resolved.  Since thinking was'in terms of a centralized processing
facility, it was necessary to ascertain whether Purex could be adapted for use
with the core material in order to be able to employ the same basic prdceSs

for both 6ore and blanket, This problem'is discussed in Section 6.2.3; Further,
there remﬁined the determination of economical head-end and tail-end treatments
sultsble for the materials in the blanket and the core. Treatments were faznd44 |

and are outlined on the flow sheets in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

6.2.3 Purex Modifjcations for Core Processing
Information obtained on.the Purex process43 indicated that it would

be entirely fessible to adapt the process to handle feeds of high plutonium

140~

 
 

 

v

o

content., However, several major problems were apparent imuwdiately;
Processing of fuels with high plutonium content requires elose control

of the Pu concentration to maintain suberiticelity of all equipment, The high

concentration of‘fission producte in the feed poses both chemical handling and

radiolytic reagent degradetion problems, In fhe plutonium separation step,

the reductant (ferrous sulfamate) céncentration.mnst bs stepped up to maintain

the increased smount of Pu in a chemically reduced state. This in turn leads

to & requiremsnt for separating large quantities of ferric ion from plutonium.

The solution of these problems would reguire development work in the laboratory.
Much morerdilute concentrations of uranium_than in & standard Purﬁx wvaald

have to be employed in order to maintain the low plutonium concentrations
necessary for subcriticality. One msﬁhod for alleviation of this situation
vhich would bring the process closer to a standard Purex is to recycia uranium
from the uranium strip column. This uranium 1s in & dilute nitric acid solution
and could be used with additional nitric acid to dissoive the hydroxides from
the head-end_treatment, ylelding a solution closer ekin to the conventional |
Purex feed with respect to uranium'concentratidn. To improve this treatment,
a higher initial TBP concentration could be used in starting the Purex to'pro- '
vide a higher uranium concentration in the strip solution and this latter leution
could be further concentrated by evaporation. |

| .Longer fuel cooling times would lessen the decomposition of Purex reagents
by fission-product decay. The increased amount of ferric ion in the final
plutonium solution could be handled by increésing“the’ioﬁ'éxéhéﬁég*féciiitieh

employed in the standard Purex ﬁrocess;

6.2.4 Alternate Blanket Process

In addition to other processes mentioned, there was anoth.er44 con-
sidered which is worthy of mention in deteil, since it seems to have escaped
mention in the literature and since it has quite interesting possibilities.
The process depends upon the fact that plutonium dioiide becomes refractory at
a much lower temperature (500-60000) than doeajranium dioxide (about 110000)
and most fission-product oxides and hence can be exceedingly difficult to
dissolvé from an oxide mixture, As a result, if the proper dissolution con-
ditions are used upon an oxide mixture in which only the plutonium dioxide is
refractory, the uraniﬁm dioxide and a good portion of the fission-product
oxlides can.be dissolved initially, The resulting matrix can then be dissolved
yiélding a solution which contains mainly plutonium with some fission products.
| Since no experimental data has been found on the decontamination obtain-
able, it is difficult to evaluate this process., However, it is interesting
to consider its use for fast reacfor bred material, where very high decontam-

ination factors are not essential, due to low fission-product absorption cross

sections, One possible limitation of this treatment is that the concentration

of PuO, in U0, must be high enough so that the Pul, will exhibit its own pro-
perties. |

A tentative outline for such a process 1s given as follows:

a. The sodium is removed from the urenium dioxide-sodium blanket material
by volatilization and alcochol dissolution as explained in Section 6.1.2.

b. An oxidation may be necessary to con&ert any plutonium metal to dioxide.

c. The oxide mixture is roasted at 500-600°C to meke the PuO, refractory.

Depending upon the blanket temperature, this may have already been accomplished

 
 

 

g

during irradiation. On the other hand, too high a blanket temperature could
cause all oxides to become refractc_:ry, destroying the feasibility of this
process,

d. The wranium dioxide and most fissiﬁn-product éxides ere dissolved out
of the mixture ﬂth hot concentrated nitric acid.

e, The remaining material, ma:lﬁly Pu0,, is dissolved in nitric acid
containing fluoride (about 0.1% HF).

f. The plutonium is precipitated as oxalate and treated as described in
Section 6.1.1. )

6.3 FPROCESSING CYCLE TIMES
6.3.1 General

 Thus far, little mention has been made of theyeconomic‘feasibility

of the chemical pfocesses already described. Actually, preliminary cost estimates
were made before final process selection to insure that there would be no
econamically unrealistic choice made, |

The determination of processing cycle tiﬁes re#olves‘largely, though not
entirely, about the question of economics. For this reason, the mﬁjor_part of
this section will be spent upon economics calculationso Although fission-pro-
duct buildup 1s not as hermful in a fast reactor as in a thermal reactor, this
problem affects the economy of breeding and will be treated.

Before specific discussion is begun, it should now be mentioned and em-
- phasized that all process economics will be based on the use of a large cen-
tralized chemical processing facility. Previous economic studies46 bear out
that the production of relatively cheap electric power requires the minimiéation
of fuel proceséing costs through the existence of a central processing plant
treating the fuel from a number of power reactors. Thus, it should be borne in
mind that all cost figures are based on the assumed availability of such a

processing plant,

‘6.3,2 Effect of Fission-Product and Transuranic Buildup

Although a study of the absorption cross sections of fission-product
elements at high neutron energies indicates that poisoning effects will be
small in a fast reactor, it is important to determine the magnitude of this
47

effect and its influence upon the core process cycle time. P. Greebler at
KAPL has computed an average fission-product cross section from estimated

From & plot of Greebler's results, average values of 2 0‘5 for each group in
the final multi-group calculetion were taken &nd averaged over the flux in

lethargy space as shown in Table 6.1.

To achieve sufficient burnup to provid.e two fission-prodnct a.toms for

with 600 MW core heat production, & core system' Pu invientory' of 1810 kg, end an

maximm possible fractional decrease in the external breeding ratic would be

pro#ided that sufficient additionsl plutonium is added to the core to maintain
a constantsintgrnal breeding ratio. Thus,\withjan'initial external breeding

ratio of 0.852 and & constant internal breeding ratio, the decrease in the

. external breeding ratio per year will be

0,090 x 0.852 = 0.,0085 per year
9.0

No adjustment of this value will be made to account for removal of fission-
product gases, since this effect will only be about 10% and since there is
uncerta;nty in Greebler's values.

To account for transuranic buildup, it was decided to make an order-of- |
magnitude correction only, due to limited time. Since it was felt that the
net effect of transwranic absorption and fission would be of the same order-
of-magnitude as the absorption in the fission products, the value for the de-
crease in external breeding ratio per yeer due to fission products was doubled
to include the transurenic effect. Thus, the figure for the over-all decrease
in external breeding ratio will be

2 x 0,0085 = 0,017 per year
6.3.3 Economics and Process Cycle Time Selection

Regarding the reactor site stockpile for replecement of fuel burnup losses,
it‘wasldecided to commence each quarter of the year with & three-month supply

end to allow this quantity to dwindle essentielly to zero befbre'replacement

- at the start of the following quarter.

fission-product and transuranic buildup., Neglected was the increased pluton-
ium inventory cost with time due to the extra amount required to maintein cri-
ticality as poisons build up. Preliminary calculations indicated that this
was & negligible factor, Chhhéeé in inventory coBtrdue to changes in cooling
time with varying process cycle time were also neglected.

Since the amount of uranium and plutonium in the core material remains
essentially constant with time, the weight of these materials ir the core systém
is

3605 kg of U + 1810 kg, of Pu = 5415 kg U and Pu.

At a cost of $62 per kg. for head-end and Purex treatment, the cost for this
part of one core processing is
5415 kg x $62/xg = $335,700. |

With a cost of $2000-per kg of plutonium for conversion of Purex plutonium
nitrate to plutonium trichloride, the cosﬁ'for this part of'oﬁe core proceasing -
is

1810 kg x $2000/kg = $3,620,000.
Thus, the total cost for one core proéeséing at any time is

$335,7oo-+¥$3,620,060 = $3,955,700.
On a basis.of one year, the processing cost per year is

$3,955,700

where y is the number of years 1n the core processing cycle time.

‘Each time the core is processed, the diluent salts anﬁ the uranium |
trichloride must either be replaced or recdvered. Since the goét involved 15.
quite small, it will be computed on the basis that the salts Qill be replaced
after each core processing. Cost figures obtained for sodium chloride, magnesium'

50

chloride and uranium trichloride are 12¢ per 1b°°, 15¢ per 1b°C, and $10 per kedl.

Using these mmbers, the cost of the core material (nmot including plﬁtonium

trichloride) is $1.73 per 1b of salt mixture. Thus, the cost for onme replace-
ment of this mixture is |
31,770 1b. x $1.73/1b = $54,900

The cost for salt replacement per year is then

- $54,900

From the caloulation in Section 6.3.2, the external breeding ratio de-
creases by 0.017 per year. With an 80% load factor and anc( of 0,26, the re-
actor consumes 217.7 kg. of plutonium per year, using the conversion factor
that 1,0 gm. Pu fissloned = 1 MiD. With & total breeding ratio of 1.09, the

The results of the cost analysis show that it would be most economical
to process the core about once every 10 years or 850, Howevef, the core §93861
will be replaced every five years, entailing a 1oné reactor shut-down period.
Thus, it was decided to process the core material during this period and avoid

To seiect the economically optimum blanket processing cycle
time, & balance was made between processing cost and the inventory charge on
the plutonium replacing thaet burned during reactor operation. It is assumed
that the internal breeding ratio will be maintained constant at 0,238 and that

~ the external breeding ratio will decrease with time from its initial value

of 0.807.

With & total burnmup of plutonium in the core of 217.7 kg, per year and
an internzl breeding ratio of 0.238, the net amount of plutonium to be replaced
is

0.762 x 217.7 kg = 165.9 kg Pu/year

again neglecting the extra amount of plutonium which must be added to counter-

‘act the increase in poisoning with time, If an inventory of enough Pu for

three-months burnup 1is aequired at-the.begiﬁning Qf'each quarfer; the initial
stockpile»every quarter will be |

165.9 x 0,25 = 41.5 kg Pu stockpile.

The average amount of plutonium inventory carried due to replacement of
burned_Pu i1s then | |

4105 x[oo5 (_g_.)"‘ 0'5 kg Pu

where 2 is the mumber of months in the blanket processing cycle time. The

plutoniur inventory ecost per kg per year is L% of $15,000. Thus, the total

Pu 1nventory cost due-to_burnup replacement is

Since the blanket contaiﬁs 15,000 kg of uranium, the blanket processing
cost per processing for the head-énﬂ and Purex treatments will be

115,000 kg U x $31/kg = $465,000 | ._
since the amount of uranium in the blanketl rémains essentiaily constant with
tims, Peor year, this cost is |

$465,000 x _1__%__ :

Furex plutonium nitrate to plutonium trichloride will be

The total processing cost will be sum of the two above costs. The economic
balance as & function of time between blanket processing cost and plutonium

The results show that the economically optimum blanket processing cycle
time is about three or four years. However, as there is uncertainty as to

the corrosion effect that formation of Nazo in the blanket will have, a shorter

- cycle time is desireble. Thus, a blanket processing cycle time of two years

will be selected, since the increase in cost 1s only about 0.02 mil per kwhr.

CHAPTER SHIELDIN

7.1 GENERAL DESCRIFTION
The shielding of the reactor will consist of steel and standard concrete.
In genersl, component shielding will be omitted; instead a compartmental shield
will be used for the entire reactor cell room, This philosophy of shielding |
was adopted in order to facilitate maintenance and replacement of equipmentQ
Since the entire reactor cell room will be underground (Fig. 3.3), the
surrounding earth will provide additional shielding, however this will not
be ﬁaken into account in the calculations. The ceiling or top of the reactor -
cell room will have a shield 1.75 feet thick made of stegl. 'The sides of the
cell will have a thermal shield consisting of 4 inches of steel and a bilological
ghield of 6 feet of ordinary concrete. The thermal shield will be made of
3 7/8 inches of carbon steel and 1/8 inch of stainless cledding on all sur-
faces which will require decontemination. Cocoling of the thermal shield was
not designed., However, it presents no problem, elther air or water cooling
may be used. The thermal shiela structure will slso providelthe foundation
for the steel containment vessel over the reactor plant. The biological shield
will be made of orﬁinary concrete; all special concretes were rejected due to

52
their high costs.

7.2 REACTOR SHIELDING CATCULATIONS

7.2.1 Neutron Shielding

The results of the Univac calculations were utilized in determining

the neutron leakage flux to be attenuated. Only the first four energy groups

- are of any concern with reSpect to shielding. 'Below are tebulated the energy |

groups andrthe neutron leakage.

Tnhle.7.1

02 - 2e23=14.35 4 9 x 108
o4 0.50-0,18 - o 7 x 108

The leakage surfece area of the reactor is 2.3 x 105 cmz. This results
3 neutrons
per cm? per sec for energy groups 01, 02, 03 and 04 respectively, This'leak-
age flux is extremely small, hence the gamma rays will be the determining

factor in the design of the shield.

' 7.2.2 Gamma Ray Shielding

Four major sources of gammea rays exist in this reactor configuration.

These sources of radiation are the prompt fission gemmas, fission product gammas,

capturevéammas, and inelastic scattering gammas.

The number and energy spectrum of the prompt fission gammas per fission
is given in TID - 7004. By using the following equation, the mumber of gammas
in this reactor system is determined:

=154= o

 
 

.l

Ay

Noy=3.1x 10" (E) B(x)

The power density P(r), was taken as 167 watts per c.c. the average power density
in the core. H

During operation, gammas are given off by the fission products. The mmber
and enefgy‘spectrum per fission is given in_fID - 7004. Agaln the average‘
power density of 167 watts/c.c. was used.

Genmas are produced due to captures in the core vessel and the lead re-'
flector. The core vessel was assumed to be steel. Using the average thermal
flux in the core vessel as given by the Univac results, the cross-section'for'
capture and the photons of various energies produced by captures, the mmber
of gammas‘produced was calculated, Using the seme technique, the same was dome
for the lead reflector.

Inelastic scattering gammas are produced in the core vessel, lead reflector,
end in the blanket., Since the high energy gammas are the most difficult to
shield; inelastioc scatterings of only the two highest neutron\energy'groups
were calculated. A major assumption was made cbncerning the energy of the

gamme, produced. Sinpe very meager information exists as to the mmber and

energy of inelastic scattering gammas, it was assumed that the Ol neutron energy

group pfoduced a single 10 Mev gamma and the 02 group, & single 2,2 Mev gamma,.
It is réalized that this 1is aconservativg assugpfion.

.The energy spéctrum or'alligammﬁs produced will be approximated by four
energy groups; 2.0,.5.6,'7.0 and 10,0 Mev,  The phdtons produced»of_enérgy less

then 1.5 Mev were néglected;-all others were averaged inte the groups above.
A further approximation is that the source of gammas other then core ¥§'s, will

| be takeﬁ as loceted at the outer surface of the lead reflector. The core was

assumed'to have self absorption and some attenuation is produced. Below are

Since the 7.0 Mev gammas were much smaller in mumber than those of other

energles, they were considered unimportant. This resulted in the following

total surface sources of gamma rays,

The gemmas are attenuated through the blanket of U02 and Na, the carben
moderator and reflector, the air(which was neglectedl and the shield of steel
and concrete. The spherical source was converted to a monodirectional infinite
plane source and the attenuation calculations were performed using the appro-
priate equations. For a detailed aenalysis of the shilelding calculations, see
Appendix B.

It was found that 4 inches of steel and 6 feet of ordinary concrete or
in the case of the top shield, the 1.75 feet of steel results in a radiation
dose less than the maximum permissable dose of 50 mr/hr., This dose of 50 mr/hr

_was tasken as the maximum permissable dose since rno one will be required to |
spend more than 2 houré per week in a rad1at1on area. This would give the per-
son & total weekly dose of sbout 100 mr/week which is one-third the maximum

pe:l'm:lssable; dose designated by the Atomic Energy Commigsion.

8,1 GENERAL

The reacior power cost of 6.5 mills/kwhr as presented below, comperes
favorably with conventional power cost. It must be realized however that, in
spite of effdrﬁs to be on the conservative side, there are a mmber of un-
certainties which when resolved might substantially change the total cost of
reactor power.

A considerable uncertainty exists regarding reliability., The design is

| basically simple, but the high negative coefficient of reactivity combined

 with large temperature fluctuations could result in frequent dumping'or the

core.,

The fuel and blanket processing cbsts were based on a large projected

centralized chemical plant and might be revised upwards in sctual experience.-

The cost.bf operation and maintenance are arbitrarily arrived at since

no experience is available. (See reference 56 and 57.)

CHAPTER 9, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
9.1 GENERAL

In order to determine better the technical and economic feasibility of
a fused-salt fast power reactor system, an extensive program of research and
development would be necessary. The following sections suggest areas in which
important contributions can be made toward the advancement of the fused-salt
reactor technology.

It i= realized that significant technical efforts in certain study areas
mentioned may currently be in progress. However, lack of knowledge of this

work prevents incluslon here. :

-164~

 
 

 

 

.

9.2 ENGINEERING

To increase the.feasibility of a fused-salt reactor for power production,
development progrems should be conducted to perfect valves and variable capacity
punps for use in circulating fuel heat exchange loops. To improve the basis
for the use of once-through boilers, it would be most helpful to have better
data for the prediction of_pressure drops and heat transfer coéfficients fbr
two-phase aqueous flow in such bollers.

To treat the problem of heating in a volume which has garma-rays being
produced in it and is exposed to a gamma—ray source, better analytical methods
correlated with experimental data are required.

Further information is needed on the feasibility of making the blanket
paste of sodium and uranium dioxide or other high solid content slurries,
Additional data on concentrations 6btg1nable would also be desirable, as waild
information on the characteristics of equipment used to achieve such high con-

centration.

.165-

 
 

9.3 MATERIALS

Progress.in the fused-salt techﬁology necessitates extensive experimental
ﬁork‘on salt systems. Fhase diagrams for ternary and quaternary chloride
systems containing fuel are almost non-existent and are badly needed. Like-
ﬁise specific heats, viscosities, fhermal conductivities and other physical

properties of fused-salt mixtures are required to analyze possible reactor

'systems.

Informetion on the physical properties of high density oxide slurries

in sodium should be obtained. The corrosion caused by the presence of Na,0

in such a slurry should be investigated, as should possible remedial techniques

such as addition of anti-oxidants,

Both static and dynamic corrosion-rate data on fused salts in various
structural materiels, especially the new nickel-molybdenum alloys, should be
taken in the temperature range from 900+1500°F. The effects of mass transfer
in heat exchange loops made of these materials should be assessed experimen- -

tally with long-time tests. Scale coefficients of fused salts in different

| materials need to be determined.

!

9.4 CHEMICAL PROCESSING

To eliminate or reduce the requirement for aqueous processing, it would
be adventaegeous to investigate‘tha continuous or semicontinuous removal of
volatile fission-products chlorides by dis‘billa.fion from fused chloride mix~-
tures containing uranium trichleride. It might also be worthwhile to consider
fhe oxidation of 0013 and PuGl3 to UC1, and PuCl, to effect a gross separation
of fuel and fertile material from fission-product and diluent chlorides by
distillation of the more volatile tetrachlorides.

In the case of fused salt mixtures irradiated to 50 or 100% fuel burnup,
studies should be made to ascertalin the effects of high fission-product con-
centrations on mixture properties. Although precipitation and deposition
might occur, this might possibly be employed as a method for removing insoluble
fission-product chlorides from a side-stream which is cooled and filtered.

Experimental work should be done on the aqueous processing of fuels con-
taining high concentrstions of fission products and plutonium. Recycle of
a diluent uranium stream to-simplify the chemical and criticality problems
involved should be investigated. o

9.5 REACTOR CONTROL

Further calculations of the Doppler effect should be carried out to
determine whether it is positive or negative. A detalled study of possible
reactor accidents should be mede in order to define better the control problems

involved in the operation of a fused-salt fast power reactor.

=167~

 
 

 

 

9.6 EGCONOMICS

Many of the cost figures used in making the economic studies in this re-
| port are based on the arbitrarily standardized numbers. In addition, other
. figures have been assumed with rather'weak'basés, due to the lack of good cost
information. Thus, further information developed in the future or new AEC
decisions may change any or all of the cost figures.

In order to determine the feasibility of a fused;salt-reaptor system which
will be constructed and operated at some time in the future, it will be nec- .
essary to make'ﬁore vallid economic projections in time if any truly realistic
cost study is to be made., The ability to do this will depend largely upon
changes in the amount of govermment fégulation in the reactor fleld, which

are difficult to predict.

The power density was aésumed constaht and equai to the average of 167 watts/

These two sources yielded & volume source of gammes of 77.6 x 1012

reduce to°

T = 946 x ~ 36,8 x°

T, = 46.9+22.4 x - 9.15 x°
(T = %)

These equations yield a maximum temperature of 109.3%F at a distance of 1.286
em into the core vessel.

Since it is believed that a temperature rise this great would cause uﬂduly
large thermal stresses in the core vessel it was thought that cooling of the
lead reflector would alleviate this.

Using the previously derived equations for temperature in the core vessel
and the lead reflector and assuming that the heat removal rate from the re-
flector could be assumed constant across the reflector and that.the_interface
temperature was equal to that in the core and blanket, a temperature distribution

could be calculated, Thus these equations are:
T, (x) = 48.9 x = 36.&%°
T, (x) = 25.8 X - 131 5% +126.9
We found that the totel heat removal rate was required to be 2.586 cal/'cm3 sec.

The maximum temperature in the core vessel had now been reduced to 29,2°F, 1%

was determined that this caused negligible thermal stresses.

For the above calculation, we took the minimm wall temperature to maximum

 

Na temperature, This will lead to a conservative result,

The effective length of each tube is 8 ft. Thus, 13 tubes would transfer
the required heat and using 17 tubes will tend to reduce the core shell temp-
erature to a more conservative level

APPENDIX C
EXFERIMENTAL TESTS
C.l1 Summary of Melting Point Tests

Since there was no aﬁailable data on the melting points of fhe proposed
ternary chloride compositions a series of tests were underﬁaken to provide some
fragmentery data. ”

The tests were run in the standard apparatus. This consisted of a nickel
crucible in which the salt was placed, a nickel container (which was provided
with openings for a stirrer, thermocouple, and a dry gas atmosphere) into which
the crucible was sealed. All operations were done in a dry box,

Since there was some doubt that the MgCl, vas anhydrous it wes purified
by the addition of some'NHzgl and heated to its melting point, This succeeded
in remeving the water of hydration from the Mg012 without the conversion of the
M’gGl2 to MgO, This was determined by a peteographic anelysis,

The NaCl., was then mixed to the eutectic composition (60% mol NaCl) and

2
melted as a check on the accuracy of the equipment° The melting point was found
to be 43700 as compared with LSO G the literature valueo

Ueing the above outlined procedure melting points were then determined of
three salt mixtures having (1) 38.6% Mg c1,, 57.91% NaCl, 3 3.49% UC1 4 (2)
36.36% Mgclz, 54.5L% Nacl, 9.09% UC1 4 (3) 33, 33% MgCl,, 50,01% NaGl, 16,663 UCL 5
The deta is summarized below as:

C.2 Petrographic Analysis of Salt Mixtures
Petrographic enalysis of the salt mixtures were done by Dr. T. N. HMcVay
et the Y-12 plant. These;analyses afe given beiowe
Sample one: Eutectic of MgCl, -NaGl (40-60 mol %)
Main.pnase nelllorystallized One p above 1, 620 and the other below.
"There is mioroorystalline material present and this has a general in-
dex of refraction below 1.544 (NaCl)., This suggests hydration. X-rays

show neither Mgcl or Nacl.

Semple twos (36.4% Mgclz, 5445 % HaCl, 9.1% 0013)
Sample has colorless phase with brown crystals in it, Brown phase
“has p about 1,90. U'Gl3 is higher at about 2,04, All pheses are

microcrystalline, Semple oxidizes in air and is hygroscopic.

Sample three: (38.6% MgCl,, 57.9% NaCl, 3.5% U013)
Sample has brown compound noted above., Very small lath crysteals of
a brown phase are present., The sample oxidizes and is hygroscopic.

Conclusion: More Data required to properly identify phases.

These analyses show that for the-Mgclz-Hacl eutectic neither the Na¢1(nor
the MgCl exists as such. This is to be expected since the phase diagrem shows
compound formation on each side of the eutectic, The conponnde formed were
assumed to be the expected ones since there was no means of making the complete
- identification,

Both samples containing the eutectic mixture plus U’Gl3 also ehowed'compound
formation, This was assumed since none of the original salts were reoognized.
The salt mixtures were also checked for the preeence of UQIL. This was not found
present as such. o o -

C.3 Summary of Chemlical Analysis of UDlB'

On a wt.% basis 68.8% of the UGL, showld be U'>, The chemicel analysis

3

of the UCl3 used for our teéta showed the 57.1% of the UCl, was U*B; This

3
indicates that the remainder of the U was in the tetravalent state.

C..4 Corrosion Tests

A series of 500 hour, see-saw_cépsule tests containing the chloride mixture
of 33.33%.Mg012, 50,01% NeCl, and 16.67% 0013 were initiated., The tests are
Seing run in capsules of nickel, and of inconel, The results of these tests
are not yet available, but are expected by September 1, 1956,

As an adjunct of this test the chloride salt mixture will be chemically

analyzed as & further check on the exact composition.
