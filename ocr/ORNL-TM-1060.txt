FOREWORD

A molten-salt-breeder reactor was evaluated at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory beginning in 1959. Because a number of the features postulated
had not been demonstrated at that time, the realization of a breeder ap-
peared to lie rather far in the futuie. Accordingly, the study of the
near-term, one-region, one-fluid molten-salt converter described in this
report was begun in July 1961 and completed in December 1962. Since then,
several advances have been made in molten-salt technology which make the
breeder reactor much less remote and modify some of the conclusions in
this report.

Briefly, these advances include:

1. Progress in core graphite design which greatly simplifies previ-
ous problems of‘separating the oore into two regions — one for the uranium-
bearing fuel salt and one for the thorium-bearing blanket salt. The new
design utilizes a liquid-lead seal around the tops of graphite tubes con-
taining fuel salt that allows the tubes to expand or contract freely while
maintaining an absolute seal between fuel and blanket fluids.¥ The addi-
tion of a blanket results in a much better conversion than obtained in
this report and leads directly to an attractive breeder.

2. Thermal engineering studies which show that the Loeffler boiler
system can advantageously be replaced by a supercritical boiler. Thermal
stress problems sre reduced, overall thermodynamic efficiency is increased,
and capital costs are considerably reduced. In addition, studies of so-

dium metal and of mlxtures of alka11 carbonates show that if either of

_these 1nexpensxve materlals can be safely used for the intermeédiate cool-

ant in place of the costly 11th1um-bery111um fluoride mixtures postulated

in this study, then further large cost reductions can be realizedj'

3. A fuel purification process based on simple distillatiomizwhich_'

not'only reduces processing costs§ but permits reuse of the carrier
salts — an advantage not assumed in this study.
As a result of these developments, we believe that fuel cycle costs

for a two-region breeder based on 1965 technology will be only 0.3 to 0.4

mill** compared to the 0.68 mill/kwhr shown in Table 6.10 for the MSCR.

ABSTRACT

The MSCR is a one-region, one-fluid, graphite-moderated
converter reactor fueled with a mixture of the fluorides of
thorium uranium, lithium-7, and beryllium which is circulated
through the 20-ft-diam core to an external heat exchanger.
Heat is transferred through an intermediate salt-coolant to
steam at 2400 psi, 1000°F in a Loeffler boiler system having
a net thermal efficiency of 41.5%. Spent fuel is processed
by fluorination (at 0.08 mill/kwhe) for recycle of isotopes
of uranium. The stripped salt is discarded.

w)

 

A capital investment of $143/kwe (3.0 mills/kwhe), an
operation and maintenance annual expense of $2.1 million
(0.3 mill/kwhe), and a minimum fuel cycle cost of 0.7 mill/
kwhe (optimum conversion ratio is ~0.9) were estimated, giv-
ing a net power cost of 4.0 mills/kwhe. All costs were based
on 1962 bases ground rules. |

 

Second generation plants may have capital costs as low
as $l25/kwe. Conversion ratios slightly greater than one
can be obtained in advenced designs.

| This study was completed in December 1962 and does not
- - reflect increased feasibility and superior performance of

' two-region, two-fluid molten salt breeder reactors made pos-
sible by recent (January 1965) advances in core design, heat
transfer, and fuel-salt processing.

1.1 Description

The reactor vessel is fabricated of INCR-8 alloy and is filled with
cylindrical graphite logs 8 inches in diameter and 24 inches long. The
fuel, a mixture of the fluorides ef 7Li, Be, Th, and U flows upward through
the pasSages around the 1bgs and is discharged through eight pumps to an
equal number of heat exchangers where the heat is transferred to an inter-
mediate-salt coolant. Saturated steam is superheated in a shell-and-tube
exchanger; part of the steam is routed to the turbines; the rest is re-
circulated to Loeffler boilers where saturated steam is generated by in-
Jecting the superheated steam into water. Thus, thermal contact of the
coolant salt with subcooled, boiling water is.avoided, and_thermelfstress
in the tube walls is tolerable. The thermal efficiency is in excess of
40%. Twenty-five hundred Mw of heat are extracted from a single core at

average power densities in the fuel salt of not more than 35 w/cmB-
1.2 Fuel Reprocessing

Irradiated fuel is‘removed from the reactor daily, collected into
processing batches, and treated with fluorine for recovery of isotopes of
uranium (fully decontaminated) as the hexafluoride. The stripped salt is
discarded. Recovered UFg is reduced terUF4, blended with fresh salt, and
recycled to the reactor. Net burnup and loss of fissile materiél-are com-

pensated by addition of 95% enriched 235y.
1,3--Nuciearfend~Thermal Performance

The limiting crlterla (e g ; max1mum ellowable fuel temperature, maxi-

- mum allowable thermal stress in graphlte, etc ) were chosen’ conservatlvely
“throughout, and pr0v1de cons1derable margin for improvement in later de-
- signs. ) The key variables (core dlameter, volume fraction of fuel in core,

,carbon,thorlum ratio, and proces51ng rate) were optimized w1th respect to

the fuel cycle cost. Characteristics of the optimized system are listed’

in Table 1.1 where it is seen that the optimum conversion ratio is 0.9,

with slightly permeable graphite that absorbs 135Xe only slowly.

 
 

 

1.4 Fuel Cycle Cost

The estimation of inventory and replacement charges for the MSCR is

straightforward. Processing costs are less well defined; however, the

processing contributes only a small part of the total fuel cost, and the

aggregaté is not sensitive to large errors in the processing cost esti-

mates.

A central Fluoride Volatility facility capable of processing 30 ft3/

day of salt was designed and costed.

Only isotopes of uranium are re-

covered; carrier salt and thorium are discarded along with fission pro-
ducts. Unit costs and the components of the fuel cycle cost are listed

~in Table 1.2.

1.5 Power Costs

The cost of power was obtained by combining fuel-cycle costs with
estimates of capital charges prepared by Sargent and Lundy, Engineers
(95,96), from a design study conducted at ORNL. Equipment was sized and
specified in sufficient detail that costs might be estimated by usual
proceduresé Plant arrangement drawings were prepared from which costs of
buildings, piping, services, etc. were estimated. Operation and mainte-
nance costs were estimated according to standard procedures (52). A sum-

mayy of the principal items is given in Table 1.3.

The fixed Charges-(14-46%):onithe[capital investment contribute 3.0

The uncertainty in this cost might run as high as 15-20%, and the

fixed cherges might renge up to 3.5 mills/kwhre.

~Operation and maintenance contribute 0.3 mills/kwhre to the total
power cost (Table 1.4). Because of the many uncertainties, this estimate

mey be low, and the cost might run as high as 0.5 mills/kwhre.

Taking the upper bound on these three items estimated above (fuel
cost ~1.0, fixed charges ~3.5, operation and maintenance ~0.5) gives an

upper limit on the cost of power of 5.0 mills/kwhre.
1.6 Advanced MSCR

The system evaluated above was based on the scale-up of current tech-
nology, and was conservatively designed in every respect. There are sev-
eral obvious improvements that could be incorporated into a "second gen-.
eration" design. If the design criteria were relaxed, metallic sodium
could be substituted for the intermediate salt coolant (saving about $10

million in capital costs. This would also permit the use of "conventional

once-through sodium-heated boilers and reduce the cost of the energy con-
version system by about another $10 million. The total cost would then be
~$125/kwe. By careful design and development the fuel volume might be re-
duced from 2500 ft3 to lSOO{fté. Separated °?Mo could be used to clad the
graphite and so reduce absorption okaenon therein and also as a struc-
tural material by means of which a blanket of ThF, bearing salt could be
added at the periphery of the core to reduce neutron leakagé. The use of
Fluoride Volatility coupled with the HF Solution Process to remove rare
earths could reduce the fission product poisoning to very low levels while
permitting recycle of carrier salt (but not thorium).. Pfeliminary calcu-
lations show that these improvements (all within reach of modest develop-

ment programs) might increase the conversion: ratio above 1.0, and, with

~ the reduction in capital costs noted, result in a power cost of 3.4 mills/

‘kwhre.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1 Purpose, Scope, and Method of Approach -

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the economic potential of a
near-term molten salt power reactor. "Near-term" characterizes a system
which utilizes only techniques or equipment currently under development.
2.1.1 Figure of Merit

The economic potential of power reactors is measured by‘the'net cost

v

of electric power.

| Fuel cycle cost, although not definitive, is also an important index
of economic potential. Moreover, the optimization of the fuel cycle is a
required first step in the detailed design of both reactor and electric
~plants. In this study, the reactor and its associated heat transfer sys-
tem, the energy conversion system, and the fuel reprocessing plant were

designed in detail sufficient to permit the optimization of the fuel cycle. ;

2.1.2 Reactor Concept

 

A concept was selected for evaluation, which, judging from previous
experience, would satisfy the "near-term" requirement and yet would ex-
hibit attractive fuel costs: A single-fluid, single-region, graphite-
moderated molten-salt reactor generically related to the Molten Salt Re-

actor Experiment. Since the breeding ratio was expected to be'less than A
unity, the system was designated the "Molten Salt Converter Reactor" = «wu-
(MSCR). ' | -

2.1.3 Procedure

In & series of preliminary calculations, therlimitations on reactor
design imposed by consideration of allowable témperature, pressures, ve-
locities, thermal stress, etc., were determined. DeSign and cost bases
were established, and the fuel cycle cost was minimized by optimization
of the key variables, which in the MSCR are the core diameter, carbon/

thorium ratio, volume fraction of fuel in the core, and spent fuel \ﬁJ

processing rate. For the optimum conditions, the fuel cycle costs result-
ing from alternate bases and assumptions (e.g., removal of xenon) were
determined. Finally, the ultimate performance resulting from & concatena-
tion of all favorable assumptions and potentially low processing costs

was estimated.

2.2 -Status of Molten Salt Reactor Development

2.2.1 Early Work

Molten salt fuels were conceived originally as a means of satisfying
the requirements for very high temperature and extremely high power density
necessary for aircraft propulsion. A very large amount of work on the
physical, chemical, and engineering characteristics of wranium and thorium

bearing molten fluorides was carried out as part of the ANP program at

Qak Ridge National Laboratory

The technology of molten salt reactors was first 1ntroduced 1nto the
open literature in 1957 by Briant and Welnberg (14). Papers by Bettis
et al. (6,7) and Ergen et al. (31) reported the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment, a beryllium-moderated reactor fueled with UF, dissolved in a mix-
ture of the fluorides of sodium and zirconium, and contained in Inconel.
The reactor was successfully operated in 1954 for about 90,000 kwhr with-
out incident at powers up to 2.5 Mwt and temperatures as high as l650°F,
The potential usefulness of molten salt fuels for civilian power was
recognized from the start.. The features that attracted attention were
the high temperature of the fuel (permlttlng use of modern steam technology
and attainment of high thermal efflciency) combined with a lOW‘V&POr pres-

sure, the hlgh stablllty of hallde salts under radlatlon, and the a&van-

~ tages that a fluid fuel prov1des._ These include a negatlve temperature
'"coefflclent of reactrv1ty, absence ‘of the need for 1n1tial ‘€XCess reac-

' ~tiv1ty and of neutron wastage in control elements, no limitation to fuel

exposure due to radlatlon damage or fuel burnup, the absence of & compli-
cated structure in the reactor core, removal of the heat transfer opera.-
tlon from the core to an external heat exchanger, and the potentlal for a

low-cost fuel cycle. In addition, suitable molten salt mixtures exhibit a

 
10

solubility for‘thorium fiuoride sufficient for all reactdr'applications;
moreover, these mixtures may be economically and rapidly processed for
the recovery of 233U by means of the well-develoPed Fluoride Volatlllty
Process. '

Studies of‘powei reactors utilizing molten salts have been reported
by Wehmeyer (109), Jarvis (49), Davies (27), and Bulmer (15). Davidson
~and Robb (26) conceived many of the features of one-region thorium con- |

verter reactors and anticipated some of the development prbblems.

2.2.2 The Molten Salt Reactor Program

The molten salt reactor program. was 1naugurated at ORNL in 1956 (57,

58) to exploit the technology of molten selt fuels for purposes of economic

civilian power. Several parts of the program were: (a) a reactor evalua-
tion study to select the most promising concepts for c1v1lian power and to
plnp01nt specific development problems; (b) an extensive materials de-
velopment program for fuels, containers, and moderators; (c) an equally
extensive program for the development of components, especially'pumps,
valves; and flanges suitable for extended use with molten salts at 1300°F;
(d) a modest program for the discovery of supplementary chemical processes
for recovering valuable components (other than uranium) from spent fuel;
(e) a program for the development aﬁd definitive demonstration of the
feasibility of edmpletely remote ﬁaiqtenance'of molten salt reactor sys-
tems; and presently (f) the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

2.2.3 Fuel Development

The program for the development of molten salt fuels in the Reaetor
Chemistry Division at ORNL has been highly successful (56). The five-com-
ponent mixtures (fluorldes of Li, Be, Th, U, and Zr) developed for the
MSRE (12) have many exceptional features. They have melting p01nts well
below 1000°F, with ample solubility for UF,, ThF4, and fission product
'.fluorides. They are thermodynamically stable with vapor pressures less
than 0.1 atm at temperatures well above 2000°F, and, being ionic liquids,
| are not subject to permanent radiation demage (e.g., rediolytic dissocia-
tion) when in the liquid state. The parasitic capture Cross sectiensfof

the base elements (71i, %Be, and 1°F) are satisfactorily low, and "Li

is available at attractive prices in grades containing as little as 0.005%
Li-6. The high volumetric‘heat capacities of salt mixtures make them
better heat transfer medis than most liquid metals in spite of the higher
film conductances obtainable with the latter. '

These mixtures do not appreciably attack the container material
(INOR-8), corrosion rates being less than 1 mil/year (possibly as low as
1/2 mil/year) at temperatures below 1300°F (28). Although it is not now
anticipated that it will be necessary to use INOR in the neutron active
zone, since the moderator material (graphite) is suitably self-supporting,
experiments have shown that the corrosion is not appreciably accelerated
by radiation. A long life (10-30 years) is predicted for all components
constructed of INOR (reactorrvessel, pumps, heat exchangers, etc.) be-
cause resistance to corrosion does not depend on maintenance of a protec-
tive film but stems from the inertness of the base metal toward the salt.

Molten salt fuel mixtures are compatible with graphite. Tests of a
typical grade show that the salt does not wet the grephite and penetra-
tion is mostly confined to the surface layers (84, p. 93). Some CF,; has
been observed in post-irradiation examination of in-pile experiments.
Since CF, is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the salt, it is
thought that its formation resulted from attack on graphite by free fluo-
rine produced by radiolysis of solid salt. Since the fuel-salt must be
maintained in the liquid state for other reasons, free fluorine would not
normally be present in the circulating stream.

Xenon is not adsorbed'appreciably'on graphite (17) at reactor tempera-
tures, though it will saturate the #6ids present because of its extremely

Jow solubility in salt (107).  However, it may be,pcssible to exclude Xe

from the graphite by treating the surface to close the pores there and

render interior'poresfinaccessibie (5). Purging the'salt_with a stream

,¢f,héliﬂm in the pump bowl or in .a special contactor would then maintain

. the Xe concentration at a very low level (Section 6.8). TIodine remains

in the ionic state and is not absorbed. -Noble metal flss10n products are
expected to be reduced by INQR outsmde the core. o

. The phase behavior of a great many mixtures has been 1nvest1gated
(108). Proposed mixtures containing up to 40 mole % BeF, have viscosities

 
 

 

12

| adequately low and dissolve heavy metal fluorides (UF4, ThF,, or ZrF,) in

concentrations up to 15 mole % with liquidus temperatures less than 1000°F

(56). Additions of 5/ mole % of ZrF, to the base salt satisfactorily re-

duces the sensitivity of the fuel mixture toward precipitation of UO; by

oxygenated contaminants (e.g., air, water, lubricating oils) which will be

difficult to exclude entirely from a large reactor system. Graphite is
readily de-oxygenated by in situ decomposition of NHgF-HF vapor, which
shows negligible attack on the INOR. o —

_ Thermophysical properties of the important salt mixtures have been
measured (8,24) in detail sufficient to permit reliable calculation of
pumping and heat transfer characteristics, which are good. _No evidence
of the deposition of scale or dendrites in the heat exchangers has been

“found.

2.2.4 Container Development

The development of nickel-molybdenum base alloys (INCR series) for
containment of molten fluorides was conducted jointly by ORNL and Inter-
national Nickel Compeny. In addition to the resistance to corrosion men-
tioned above, the alloys have good—to-éxcellent mechanical and thermal .
characteristics, (superior to those of many austenitic stainless steels)
~and are virtually unaffected by long-term exposuyre to salts or to air at
1300°F (12). The alloy has been made'by several major manufactUring com-
panies, and it is presently available on & limited commercial basis in the

form of tubing, plates, bars, forgings, and castings. Exhaustive tests

at ORNL have shown that its tensile properties, ductility, creep strength,

cyclic fatigue strength (both thermal and mechanical) are adequate for
molten salt reactor applications when judged in accordance with criteris
used in the ASME Boiler Code (75-87). INCR is weldable by'conventional
techniques using welding rods of the same compositidn as the base metal.
A gold-nickel alloy has been developed at ORNL suitable for remote brazing
of reactor components. INOR begins to soften above 2000°F and melts at
2500°F. The thermel conductivity is about 12 Btu/hr-ft:°F at 1200°F. No
major difficulties have been encountered in the design and fabrication of

reactor components, including pumps and heat exchangers (12).

2.2.5 Moderator Development

‘Graphite, because of its good moderating properties, low neutron cap-

ture cross sectiOn, compatibility,with fluoride salts and INOR, and excel-

lent high-temperature physical properties is a superior moderator for
molten salt reactors. The graphite proposed for use in the MSRE has a
density of 1.8 g/cc and a kerosene-accessible porosity of 6%. About half
the pore volume is accessible from the surface. However, as mentioned
above, molten fluorides do not wet graphite and permeation of MSRE grade
graphite by the salt is less than 0.5% by volume at 150 psi (84, p. 93).
The coefficient of permeability by helium at 30°C is 10-° cm?/sec, and Xe
will be adsorbed rapidly. _However,_techniques for reducing permeability
are being developed. Samples of high-density graphite having permeabilis.
ties at least two orders of magnitude lower have been made (107).
Development of graphites and graphite bodies is being carried out
cooperatively with National Carbon Company. Pieces of graphite are pres-
ently avallable in sections up to 20 in. square and 20 ft long. Graphite
having outstanding mechehioal properties is available in the form of
readily machinable rods, tubes, slabs, and spheres. The effects of nu-" .
clear rediations4on this material are not fully known. The thermal con-
ductivity declines, but probably not below 15 Btu/hr:ft:°F. Thermal
stress considerations thus affect the design of moderator elements; the
allowable stress is thought to be at least 2000 psi and the allowable
strain at least O. 1%. These~1imits appear to be oompatible with the

thermel and nuclear requlrements of optimum core design. However, experi- -

mental verlflcatlon of- these ‘values is needed.
At the temperatures encountered in molten salt reactors, graphite

ite is presently unresolved.'rThe boWing'of graphite. stringers might be

2.2.6 Component Development

 

Development of components for molten salt reactors has been in pro-
gress for over ten years. The most nbtable-achievements to date are.the
demonstration of the long-term reliability of pumps operating at 1300°F,

- including pumps having molten-salt-lubricated bearings, and the demonstra-
tion of the reliability and maintainébility of remotely operated freeze

flanges and freeze valves.

2.2.7 Reactor Vessel

No difficulties were encountered in the design or.fabricatibn of the
reactor vessel for the MSRE. In large power reactors provisiOn to limit
thermal stress by means of therma;\shields may be necessary, but mechanical
stresses are not important because pressures greater than 200 psi are not
encountered anywhere in the systems. Corrosion does not appear to be a

problem.

2.2.8 Molten Salt Pumps

 

Molten salt pumps have been operated continuously for 33 months at
temperatures above 1200°F. A sump-type pump having one salt-lubricated
journal bearing has logged more than 12,000 hours of operation. at 1225°F,

1200 rpm, and 75 gpm. After it was stopped and restarted 82 times, examis -

nétion of the bearings disclosed no discernible attack. The use of salt-
lubricated bearings will enable the shaft to be lengthened so that shield-
ing may be interposed between the pump bowl and the motor with its oil-
lubricated bearings. The impellers of these pumps also withstand attack
indefinitely under operatiﬁg‘conditions. It is believed that pumps of
the types developed can be made in large sizes for use in large molten
‘salt reactor plants and that these can operaté'at the temperatures re-

quired.

2.2.9 Molten Salt Heat Exchangers and Steam Boilers : ’

The design and fabrication of exchangers for transferring heat from

fuel salt to an intermediate coolant salt are straightforward. Heat

transfer experiments conducted at ORNL with unirradiated salt verify the
correlations used to predict the performance. Scale did not form on the
heat transfer surfaces.

The Loeffler boller seems especially suited for use with molten salts.
Here dry saturated steam is superheated in alsalt-to-steam exchanger; part
of the superheated steam is routed to the turbines, and part is recircu-
lated through an evaporator producing saturated steam for recycle to the
exchanger. - Problems in boiling burnout, thermal stress in the exchanger
tubes, and freezing of the salt are thus avoided.

However, a fuel-salt boiler presently in the conceptual stage has
many potential advantages. In this concept, the fuel downcomer annuius
inside the reactor vessel is widened t¢ accommodate several hundred INOR
thimbles. Bayonet.tubes,.into which water is introduced, are inserted
into the thimbles, but are separated from the thimble walls by a narrow
annulus filled with an inert salt. Calculations show that the heat trans-
fer is adequate to produce steam at 1000°F and 2000 psi. Yet the salt and
steam systems are isolated from direct contact and the salt system is .
under negligible pressufe- Should either system leak, this would be de-
tected immediately by monitors in the inert salt system.-

Such a boiler has many advantages, including the complete elimination
of one cooling loop and its associated pumps, heat exchanger, etc. 1In
addition, the fuel circuit is appreciably shortened in comparison to a
"spread-out" system. The steam produced will be considerably less radio-

active than that prodaced in“a direct cycle boiling?water reactor.

2. 2 10 Freeze Valves and Freeze Flanges

Although the hlgh meltlng p01nt of a molten salt regctor fuel (800—

71000°F) is. a disadventage in that the system must be preheated before
t,fllllng and provision must be;made to avoid freezing, there are also bene-
| 'fits'that.accrue; Among these ie'the fact that if a leak does occur there
C T is little tendency for the materlal to disperse. rapldly :Ndble gas fis-
';_Slon products do not accumulate in the llquld and the fluorides of the

"'remalnlng fission products have negllglble vapor pressure and are retained.

 
 

 

 

16

The ready solidification of salts has also been put to use in the
development of flanges and valves. The remote manipulation of reliable-
freeze flanges has been successfully demonstrated in many tests and in a
remote maintenance development facility. Freeze valves have no moving
parts, no seals, and have been demonstrated to be satisfactory inisalt =

transfer and drain: pipes.

2.2.11 Molten Salt Instrumentation and Special Equipment

Conventional equipmenﬁ is adequate for measuring the nuclear behavior
of molten salt reactors; however, special equipment for handling molten
salts was developed at ORNL for the MSRE. For measuring liquid level in
the pump bowls, for example, a ball-float suspending an iron bob whose
position is sensed by an external induction coil was developed. A single
‘point electrical probe device has also been developed for use in the fill-
and-drain tanks to calibrate the weighing system.

A sampler-enricher device is being tested whereby fresh fuel may be
added to the fuel stream during operation, and a sample of spent fuel may
be removed without contamination of the fuel stream by air or water vapor
and without the uncontrolled escape of any radioactive material from the
reactor.

Clam-shell electrical pipe heaters for lines carrying molten salt

have been developed.

2.2.12 Remote Maintenance

Because of fission-product contamination and induced activity in
components and piping, the fuel-containing portions of molten salt re-
actors cannot be approached for direct maintenance even after draining
and flushing. Semi-direct maintenance through a shield plug with long-
handled tools is possible for some items, but it is necessary to develop
completely remote tools and methods for many of the larger components.
These include tools, techniques, and procedures for removing and replacing
all major reactor components, including the heat exchanger, primary fuel-
pump and motor, reactor vessel, and fill-and-drain :tank. Such equipment
and techniques successfully demonstrated in the Molten Salt Remote Main-
tenance Development Facility at ORNL (65). This facility simulated a

20-Mwt molten salt reactor system and comprised a mockup of the reactor
vessel, a mockup of the héat exchanger, together with full-scale pumps;
flanges, valves, electrical heaters, thermocouples, etc. All maintenance
operations were performed by a single operator from a remotely located
control center, using closed-circuit stereo-television for viewing. The
manipulator was a general purpose, medium duty, electro-mechanical "arm"
which performed a variety of functions easily and efficiently. It was
used to connect and disconnect'tube and electrical connections, to carry
loads weighing up to 750 1lbs and to manipulate tools. Eight basic mo-
tions, five for the arm and three for the crane bridge, were controlled
independently by two pistol-grip handles on the control console. Two
types of remotely interchangeabie grasping devices permitted a variety
of objects to be handled. |

Tools developed for remote manipulation included impact wrenches, a
torque tool and bolt runner, écrew jacks on the heat exchanger for working
the freeze flanges, and miscellaneous devices such as lifting slings,
socket extensions, hooks, fingers, etc. All these were operated by the
manipulator. In addition, a reactor-lifting jig, a pump~lifting eye, and
socket extensions for the torque tool and bolt runner were positioned by
the manipulator, but operated by the crane or by their own power.

The installation of microphones at strategic locations inside the
reactor cell to enable the operator to listen to pneumatic and electric
motor sounds was found to be helpful.

Maintenance of the MSRE will be accomplished by means of the tech-
niques and tools developed and supplemented with some semi-direct main-
tenance operations through a portéble shield having a rotatable pilug.
Long-handled tools may be inserted through this plug and manipulated by
hand. These means of maintenance will be thoroughly tested in a full-

scale mockup of the MSRE now being constructed at ORNL.

| 2.2.13 Chemical Processing of Molten Salt Fuels

The use of fluid fuels in nuclear reactors provides an opportunity
for continuously removing fission products and replacing fissile isotopes

at power. Thus, it is possible to hold fission-product neutron losses to

th

low levels and to eliminate capture of neutrons in control rods.

The "Fluoride Volatility Process" is in an advanced stage of develop-
ment; a pilot plant for general application is now in operation at ORNL.
Other processes are being sought, and prospects are good that simple and
economic means can be found to separate fission products continuously

from spent fuel salt.

2.2.14 Fluoride Volatility and HF Solution Processes

While the fluoride volatility process was not developed specifically
for use with molten salt fuels, it has been verified in laboratory experi-
ments conducted at ORNL that it is applicable for removal of uranium from
fluoride mixtures containing ThF; (16). In this process, elemental fluo-
rine, diluted with an inert gas, is bubbled through the salt.  UFs; is
converted to UFg which is volatile at the temperature of operation (500~
700°C) and passes out of the contactor to be absorbed reversibly in a bed T
of sodium fluoride. The off-gas is cooled, stripped of ngin a-scrﬁbber,
and passed through'charcoal beds where fission product gases are absorbed.

The fluorides of a few of the fission products. are also volatile but

#

these are irreversibly absorbed in the sodium fluoride beds. Thus, by.
heating the beds, UF¢ is brought over in a very pure state, completely
decontaminated and with losses less than 0.1%.

The UFg is reduced to UF,; in a hydrogen-fluorine flame, and is col- —

lected as & powder in a cyclone separator backed up by gas filters. Losses iaﬁ

routinely are smaller than random errors in the assays, and the process
has been used successfully for many years in the manufacture of enriched
235y from natural uranium in the production plants at Oak Ridge.

The Fluoride Volatility Process alone is sufficient for the economi-
cal operation of a molten salt converter reactor. Spent fuel containing
UF,, ThF,, 233Pa, as well as fiesion products is removed from the reactor
periodically and fluorinated for recovery of uranium isotopes. The =
stripped salt is discarded (stored in INOR cylinders indefinitely) to
purge the system of fission products. Although the discarded salt con-
tains valuable components (7Li, Be, 232Tn, 23Pa), the cost of discarding
these is'offset by the improvemént in conversion. ratido, il

The steps described above appear to be especially attractive for
integration with the reactor plant. That is, they are all high-tempera-
ture, non-agueous processes,,and could convenliently be carried out in the
reactor cell, utilizing the same shielding and sharing in the use of re-
mote maintenance equipment. The waste product (fuel salt stripped of
itotopes of uranium) is in. a form conveniently stored for decay of radio-
activity. After a period measured in years, the waste could conveniently
be removed to another location for recovery of thorium, lithium, beryl-
lium, and other valuable components in a relatively low-level-radiation
facility.

The HF Solution Process (16) under study at ORNL prov1des one means
of separating rare earths (whlch constltute the bulk of important non-
volatile fission products, 1nclud1ng 1sotopes of samarium) from the base
salt, after uranium has been remcved The separation is effected by dis-

solving solidified salt in llquld HF containing up to 10% water. The

rare earths, thorlum, and . related materlals pre01p1tate and mey be sepa-

rated by filtration or decantatlon, permitting reuse of the. salt. The

HF Solution Process is presently 1n the laboratory stage of development

.2;2.15_ Thorex. Process

-While the Flueride VolatilityaproceseaappeaIS;attractive if inte-
grated with the reactor plant, it is not obvious that it is superior in

a central facility to alternative modes of processing, such as Thorex.

 
 

 

20

This uncertainty is due in part to paucity of reliable infOrmation on
costs of on-site and central Fluoride Volatility process plants,.and in
part to the limitations of the method in respect to reccvery_of_lithium
“and thorium. On the other hand, the costs of Thorex plants are rather
better known, and, with.suitable modifications, Thorex appears to permit
economic recovery of all valuable components of the fuel salt only mod-
erately contaminéted with certain fission products (e.g., cesium). The .
costs associated with a modified Thorex process as described in Section

5.3 were used in an alternate evaluation of the MSCR.

2.2.16 Fractional Crystallization Process

Studies by Ward et al. (108,:106, 80, p. 80).provide a basis for
evaluating the feasibility of removing rare earth fluorides from the fuel
salt by partial freezing. A brief description is given in Section 6.7.3.
The process is not suitable for a breeder reactor inasmuch as the fission
product concentration cannot be lowered much below 0.2 mole %; however,
much higher concentrations can be tolerated in a converter. In the ref-

erence design studied here, the concentration is approximately 0.5 mole %.

2.2.17 Other Processes

Solvents which will selectively dissolve either ThF, or rare earth
fluorides are being sought at ORNL. Solutions of SbFs in HF show some
promise. _

The capture of a neutron by an atom of 233Pa results in a double

loss — that of the neutron and of the fissile atom of #23U that would

have been formed by decay of the Pa. A process is needed that can quickly
and economically remove 233Pa from the circulating salt stream so that it
" may be held outside the reactor until it decays to ?22U. There is a pos-
sibility that exposing the fertile stream to beds of ThO, pellets might
accomplish this. There is some evidence that thorium from the beds will
exchange with Pa in the solution, and the latter will be immobilized until
it decays, after which it might, as 233U, exchange with thorium in the
salt, and so become available for recovery by fluorination. Other oxides,

e.g., BeO, are also under study.

2.2.18 Molten Salt Reactor Studies

The status of the Molten.Salt Reactor Program was reviewed in 1958
for the second Geneva Conference by MacPherson et al. (56). At that
time a homogeneous molten salt reactor having only a limited capability
for fuel regeneration was under consideration. Further.studies of this
system were reported by Alexander et al. (l) and a 30-Mwt experimental
reactor was described (2).

Also, in 1958, good indications were obtained that the system INOR-
graphite-salt is chemically stable in radiation fields and attention was
accordingly shifted to graphite-moderated systems. MacPherson et al.
(60) described a one-region sihgle-fluid reactor utilizing slightly en-
riched uranium and a highly enriched feed. Many features of his concept
were incorporated in the present study.

The potential of graphite-moderated molten-salt reactors for breeding
in the Th-233U cycle was investigated and the associated development
problems were identified by MacPherson in a series of papers (61-63).
Several conceptual designs for one- and two-region breeders were proposed.
One of these (the MSBR) was evaluated in comparison with four other ther-
mal breeders by the Thorium Breeder Reactor Evaluation Group at ORNL (3);
this system employed a fuel salt (contained in graphite bayonet tubes and
circulated through external heat exchangers) together with a fertile salt
stream (containing all the thorium) surrounding the moderated core region.
The major problems associated With this concept were the development of a
reliable graphlte-metal Joint for connecting the bayonet tubes to an INOR
header and the uncertain: behav1or of the core structure for long periods
under 1rrad1atlon at hlgh‘power den81t1es. |

It was estimated that the MSER could achieve fuel yields up to about

"7%/year (doubling time about 14 years) at fuel cycle costs not greater
~ than 1.5 mills/kwhr; and that fuel costs as low as 0.7 mills/kwhr could

be achleved by sacr1f1c1ng the fuel yleld in favor of lower processing
costs (3) o |

2.3 Molten Salt Reactor Experiment

The favorable results obtained in the various evaluation and develop-
ment programs led_to the initiation in May 1960 of preliminary design of
“the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (12,5). Construction and installation
of the entire system are scheduled for completion in mid-~1964 and criti-

cality late in 1964, or early 1965.

The MSRE is expected to demonstrate the long-term reliability of
components and the compatibility of materiais under actual operating con-
ditions, including the dimensional stability of the graphite and its re-
sistance to permeation by fuel salt in the presence of radiations and the
maintainability of the system after operation at power.

The reactor will produce up to 10 megawatts of heat in a fuel con-
sisting of a solution of highly enriched 235U"F, dissolved in a mixture
of the fluorides of lithium (99.990% Li), beryllium, and zirconium .
having a liquidus temperature of 842°F. The salt enters a volute around
the upper part of the cylindrical vessel at 1175°F and flows at the rate
of 1200 gpm down through an annular plenum between the wall of the vessel
and up the graphite core-matrix. This is constructed by pinning 2-in.
square bars loosely to INOR beams lying across the bottom of the vessel.
The salt flows up among the bars at a velocity of 0.7 ft/sec.-(Reynolds
number 1000) and exits at 1225°F. '

The fuel pump, & sump-type having a bowl 36 in. in diameter and
12 in. high, is driven by a 75 hp motor and develops:a head of 48.5 ft
at 1200 gpm. All parts are constructed of INCR.

The heat exchanger, also constructed of INOR, has 165 tubes 14 ft
long by 1/2 in. OD with walls 0.042 in. thick, and provides 259 ft? of
heat transfer surface (heat flux 130,000 Btu/hr-ft°® at a IMID of 133°F).
The reactor heat is transferred to a secondary salt coolant from whence
it is discharged to the atmosphere in an air-cooled radiator.

Initially, the MSRE will contain no thorium, since the power level
is too low for significant emounts of 433U to be produced in a reasonable
time. Thorium may be added later to permit verification of nuclear calcu- o~

3. BASES AND ASSUMPTIONS

3.1 Design Bases

3.1.1 Reactor Concept

The concept.selected for study was madeled closely after that pro-
posed by MacPherson et al.:(60), and is essentially a scalezup of the ..
Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (12,5) plué necessary auxiliary equipment
for generation of electricity, etc. Briefly, the core consists of a ver-
tical bundle of unclad graphite logs conbtained in an INOR vessel. Fuel
salt containing thorium and uranium flows up through the bundle into a
plenum, thence through several pumps in parallel to the shell side of
multiple shell-and-tube heat exchangers, and then back to the reactor.

3.1.2 Design Calculations

These were performed only in sufficient detail to permit the estima-
tion of the capital cost.  Problems of control, shielding, hazards analy-
sis, etc., were ignored. . Attention was centered on the nuclear perform-
ance and processing costs. The energy conversion system was designed to
provide & basis for estimating the volume of the fuel salt circulating
in the primary heat system, the net thermal efficiency, and the capital

investment.

3.1.3 Station Power =

An electrical capabiiitjfof*ldOO,Mw was selected to permit direct
comparison with systems previOQSly evaluated at the same plant capacity.
Preliminary calculations indicétéd.that-the core should be ~20 ft in diam-

eter for satisfactory nuclear performance. At a power of 1000 Mwe, power

A lowerfplant dutput'WOuld result in inefficient utilization of the fuel

inventory.

 
 

 

24

3.1.4 Plant Utilization Factor

The standsrd factor of 0.8 was used as recommended in the "Guide"

(52).

3.1.5 Thermel Efficiency

Several different energy conversion schemes were considered in suf-
ficient detail (see Section 4.3) to show that even the least efficient
system (Loeffler boiler) would have, when fully optimized, & thermal ef-
ficiency not less than 40%. This efficiency was therefore adopted for

use in the fuel cost optimization calculations.

3.1.6 Fueling Cycle

For the purposes of optimization calculations, it was assumed that
make-up fuel was added and spent fuel was removed quasi-continuously,
and that, with three exceptions, the concentrations of the various nu-
clides in the circulating salt system were in equilibrium with respect
to feed rates, nuclear reactions, and processing rates. The exceptions
were 234U and 238U (which are initially present in amounts substantially
lower than the equilibrium value, and whose concentrations increase with
time) and 226U (the concentration of which starts at zero and reaches
only about-3/4 of its equilibrium values in 30 years). For these three
isotopes, concentrations that approximated the average over a life of
30 years starting with the reactor charged with 23°U (95% enrichment)
were used. Other important isotopes appear to approach their equilibrium
concentrations in times short compared to the reactor life. The use of
equilibrium concentrations for these, especially for slowly equilibrating

fission products, is discussed in Appendix H.

3.1.7 Processing

The processing rate wés optimized with respect to the fuel cycle
cost. In the selected process, spent fuel is accumulated, shipped to a
central Fluoride Volatility Plant, cooled for a minimum of 90 days, and
treated for recovery of uranium. Undecayed 233Pa, along with 232Th, 714,

and °Be are lost in the waste.

3.1.8 PFeed and Recyclé.b

In the optimization calculations, it was assumed that isotopes of
uranium recovered from irradiated fuel are recycled, and that deficiencies
in the breeding ratio are compensated by additions of 95%-enriched 2357,

The effects of a few feed and recycle échemes'on the optimum reactor
were studied (Section 6.9), such as the use of feeds containing a mixture
of uranium isotopes (e.g., spent fuel from the Consolidated Edison Reactor
at Indian Point, New York). The sale of irradiated fuel to the AEC as an

alternate to recycle was also investigated.

3.1.9 Isotopic Composition of Lithium

It was assumed that lithium (as the hydroxide) would be available in
grades containing up to 99.995% 71i at a price no greater than that quoted
in reference 67 ($120/kg of lithium). The choice of this composition
(rather than one having a lower cost) resulted from a compromise between
cost of neutron losses to ®Li and the cost of discarding the salt enriched

in 7Li with a processing rate of about 2 ft?/day.

3.1.10 Energy Conversion System

Although it would be difficult to establish a complete set of require-
ments for coupling of the reactor system with the energy conversion system
prior to the preparation of a detailed design; nevertheless, it is neces-
sary to fix some of these in order that the fuel cyéle cost may be esti-
mated. The most_im@drtantrreQuirement'appears to be a necessity to iso-
late the fuel salt from the thermodynamic fluid, at least when that fluid

- is waterﬁ The hazards associated with the possibility that high_préssure

P .
steam might leak into the fuel system cannot be tolerated, since such ..

leakage would result in the rapid formation of U0z (Sl,rp} 63). This is
only slightly solublé in the base salt, althdugh its solubility can be
increased. somewhat by additions of ZrF, and of ThF4 (84, p. 96). 1Isola-

tion of the steam and fuel systems is achieved by 1nterp051ng & compatlble

- third fluid, either as a stagnant layer or as a separate stream circulated

between primary and secondary heat exchangers.

 
 

 

26

| The intermediate coolant'(third fluid) must be chemically éompaﬁible
with fuel salt, and in addition, it is desirable that it be inert with
respect to steam.  Also, if should either not be a nuclear poison, or

else it should be readily removable from fuel salt. .For the reference
design, a salt 66 mole ¢ LiF (99.995% 7Li) and 34 mole % BeF, was selected
(Table 3.4) as the intermediate fluid.

3.1.11 Primary Heat Exchanger Requirements

It is imporfant that the external portion of the fuel salt circulat-
ing system shall have as small a volume as possible in order to reduce
the inventory of valuable materials. 'However, the reliability and main-
tainability of the sjstem cannot be compromiséd in favor of small volume.
A requirement for maintainability, which includes replaceability, implies
that the primary heat exchanger shall be drainablé of fuel salt. This re-
quirement is most easily and certainly metvby putting the fuel salt in |
the shell-sides of the heat exchangers and grouping these about the reac-
tor in a vertical position so that the heads may be removed and the tube
bundles lifted out easil&.

3.1.12 Minimum Salt Temperatures

To provide a margin of safety in regard to possible freezing of both
fuel salt and intermediate coolant salt, it was decided that the operating
temperature of any salt stream should not be at a temperature less than

the liquidus temperature of the fuel salt.
3.2 Cost Bases

3.2.1 Value of Fissile Isotopes

Unirradiated, highly enriched ?33U was valued at $12.01/gram of con-
tained ?3°U (52). Mixtures of isotopes were valued according to the
formule V = £(E) $12/gram of contained fissile isotope (223U, 23°U), where
f(E) is an enrichment factor found by dividing the value of enriched 232°U
having the same composition as the mixture in question by $12.0l/gram\

The enrichment, E, of the mixture is found by dividing the sum of the

‘atomic concentrations of 235U and 233y (and 233Pa, if any) by the sum of

atomic concentratlons of all 1sotopes of uranium in the mixture (thus
lumping 234U and 236U with 228U as diluents).
3.2.2 Value of Thorium

Inquiries directed to several vendors elicited only one reply (Appen-
dix J); however, the quotation given ($6/1b of ThF,) agreed well with a
1959 estimate by Orrosion (89) and led to the adoption of a price of
$19.00/kg of thorium as ThF,; ($6.50/1b ThF, ).

3.2.3 Value of LiF(99.995% 7Li)

This was taken to be $120/kg of contained lithium (Appendix J) or
$32.30/kg of LiF.

3.2.4 Value of BeFo

Inquiries cited in Appendix J led to adoption of a price of $15.40/kg
of BeFs.
3.2.5 Value of Base Salt

This varied with the composition, but the base salt in the optimum
reactor contained 68 moles of LiF per 23 moles of Bng giving a value of
$25.97/kg.

3. 2 6 Cost of Compounding,and Purlfylng Fuel Salt

The operatlon of blendlng recycle uran1um.w1th make-up uranlum and

fresh lithium, berylllum, and thorlum fluoride end purifying is to be per-

formed on-site. The cost was therefore excluded from the operating and

capital charges of the proce331ng plant and included in the capital and

:operating charges of the reactor plant

3.2.8 Moderator Graphite Cost

The cost of graphite such as would be used in the MSCR core has been
established at $6.00 per 1b. This is from informal discussion with ven-

dors.

3.2.9 Annual Fixed Charges

For fissile isotopes, the use charge was taken at 4.75%/yr in ac-
cordance with the "Guide" (52). Other components of the fuel mixture were
carried as depreciating assets (since only the isotopes of uranium and
thorium are recoverable). For such the "Guide" recommends (Tsble 3.1) an
annual rate of 14.46% for an investor-owned public utility (IOPU). This
rate, however, includes 0.35% for interim replacement when the rate of re-
placement is not known. In the preéent instance, the replacement rates

for base salt were calculated and the corresponding costs listed sepa=

rately; therefore, the annual charge for the above items was set at ... . .

14.11%/yr. This included also 1.11%/yr for amortization by means of a
30fyr sinking fund with cost of money at 6.75%/yr; hehce, & charge for
replacement of salt at the end of 30 years was not made either separately

or as part of the final processing to recover the uranium inventory.

3.2.10 Central Fluoride Volatility Plant Processing Charges

The schedule given beldw was extracted from the estimates presented
in Table 5.9 and apply £0 a plant capable of processing 30 £t of salt
per day (about 1000/kg day of thorium for the reference design salt) for
recovery of isotopes of urénium. The -barren salt is discarded. Capital
investment ($25.5 million) was estimated by scaling from a study by
Carter, Milford, and Stockdale (21) of two smaller on-site plants (1.2
and 12 ft3/day), and adding costs of other facilities required in a cen-
tral plant (receiving, outside utilities, land improvements, etc.). The

plant is large enough to service about fifteen 1000 Mwe molten salt con-

verter reactor plants. A turn-around-time of two days was allowed. Ship-

ping charges ($10.30/kg thorium) were estimated separately (Table 5.8).

_343_Special AsSﬁmptions

3. 3 1 Permeatlon of Gr_phlte by_Salt

Tests with MBRE fuel salt at 1300°F and 150 p31 in MBRE graphlte
showed penetratlons of the order of 0. 02% in 100 hours (86, p. 93) Most

" of the absorbed salt was contained in pockets lying at the surface of the
graphite, and presumably in communication with bulk liquid. From a metal-

- lographic examination of thin sections, it was concluded that penetrations

 
 

 

30

O

considerably less_thah 0.12% would be encounteréd in the MSRE at the
“maximum.pressure of 65 psia.  For the purposes 6f eValﬁating the MSCR,
it was assumed the penetratioh would beAO.l%, andkthaﬁ‘oniy_pores iying
at the surféce would contain salt. Thus, in a core 90 volume % graphite
the volume of Salf absorbed in the graphite would be slightly-less than
1% of the volume of salt in the core. This absorbed salt was assumed

to have the same composition as the circuléting‘stream.

3.3.2 Permeation of Graphite by *3° Xenon:

, The solubility of xenon and other noble fission product gases in fuel
salt is very low (107); also, their adsorption on graphite at 1200°F ap- .
pears to be negligible (17). However, there remsins the possibility that
gaseous xenbn may diffuse into the pores in graphite at & rate large com- e
pared to that at which it can be removed from the salt by sparging or |
spraying. The mathematical treatment of the case at hand has been pre-
sented by Watson, et. al. (107), who also established probable ranges
for the diffusion coefficient. For the purposes of a reference calcula-
tion having a reasonable degree of plausibility, a value of 10-6 (cm?/
sec) was selected for the diffusion coefficient and a value of 0.0l for
the porosity of graphite to noble gases. Further, it was assumed to be
feasible to by-pass 10% of the fuel salt (16 f£t3/sec) through the pump
bowls or through a sparge chamber, and that this by-pass steam would give

up substantially all of its xenon to the sweep gas.

'3.3.3 Corrosion Products

 

Tests in a forced convection INCR loop using a salt (62-LiF, 36.5- o
BeF,, 0.5-UF;, 1.0-ThF,) very similar (except for thorium content) to
that proposed for the MSCR,'show:that after a period of initial attack
(occurring generally in the equipment in which the batch of salt is pre-
pared) the concentration of structural-element cations reaches equilibrium
values (84, p. 79). The temperature of the salt was 1300°F in the hot
leg, 1100°F in the cold leg, and was circulated for a total of almost
15,000 hours. - The concentration of nickel, after rising to a‘maximnm-of‘

o~
80 ppm in about a thousand hours, reached an equilibrium value of about '_\,J

 
 

o

»n

values.

31

50 ppm at 2000 hours. _Chromium-concentration fluctuated between 400 and
600 Ppm, .averaging about 500 ppm, while iron averaged about 250 ppm.
Molybdenum was said to be negligible and was not repbrted.

Apparently thegconéentration of chromium is in equilibrium with
respect to the .rate with which chromium is oxidized by UF4 to CrFo at the
hot metal surfaces and the rate with which it is reduced to O¢r at the
cold surfaces (75, p- 39). In the MSCR, large areas of INOR are exposed
to the salt at all temperatures between'llOO°F‘and 1300°F. Although the
rate of diffusion of chromium'in INCR has béen determined at various
teriperatures, it is not possible to calculate the chromium concentration
in the salt until the temperature profile is known. |

In the calculations performed here, a neutron-poison allowance was

~made for corrosion producf?, amounting to 0.008 neutrons per atom of

fuel destroyed. This loss is comparable to the loss that would result
if the concentrations of Ni, Cr,_and Fe were 50, 500, and 250 ppm, as in

the loop-corrosion test cited above (Section 6.3).
3.3.4 Approach.to Equilibrium

The nuclear performance was calculated by means of MERC-1, an equi-’. -
librium reactor code. Thus the performance of the reactor during the
approach to equilibrium, when concentrations of isotopes of uranium and
of fission products are changing, was not considered, except in regard to

234y, 2367, ‘and ?38U. These were averaged over a fuel lifetime of 30
years; 223U, 235U -and flSSlon products were taken at their equilibrium

In cases where adequate supplles of ?33U are unavailable the reactor

‘would be fueled initially with enriched 235U. This is inferior to 233y
‘in respect to eta.and aISO-formsra non-fertile daughter, 226U. _These
‘disadvanteges are offset by.initially-low concentrations of fission )

|  products and 236U. While a calculatlon of the time-dependent behav1or is
'de81rable in such cases, 1t does not appear that the error 1ntroduced by
| assuming equilibrium pondltlpns ;s important. The matter is. explored
further in Appendix H.

4. DESCRIPTION OF MSCR CONCEPT
4.1 General Description

The MSCR is a single-region, uhreflected, graphite-moderated,fluid-
fuel reactor utilizing_a mixture of molten fluorides-of lithium, beryl-
lium, thorium, and uranium as the fuel and primary coolant. A sketch of -
the reference design reactor is shown in Fig. 4.1. As seen in this fig-
ure, the reactor consists of a 20-ft-diam by 20-ft-high cylindrical core
made up of 8-in.-diam graphite cylinders. The fuel salt enters through
a bottom grid, flows upward through the spaces between the cylinders- and
is discharged into one of eight primary heat removal circuits located
around the reactor. The arrangement of these circuits is shown in Fig.
4.2. The heat generated in fuel salt is transferred to an inteiﬁediate
coolant salt consisting of a mixture of barren lithium and beryllium
fluoride containing no uranium or thorium. The coolant salt is used to
superheat saturated steam produced in a Loeffler boiler and also to re-
heat steam from the turbogenerators. The reactor vessel, internals and
all primary and secondary system components in‘contact,with”fuel salt and
coolant salt are constructed of INOR-8. The specifications are tabulated
in section 4.10. Part of the superheated steam is sent to & high-pressure
turbine and the rest is injected into the Loeffler boilers to generate
saturated steam. This saturated steam is recirculated to the superheater

by steam-driven axial compressors using steam drawn from the‘high-pressure

 

turbine discharge. A flowsheet of this heat removal-power generation sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 4.3. ‘

- Design data and operating characteristics for the reference deéign

 

are given in Table 4.1.
4.2 Site Plan

The site plan of the MSCR plant is shown in Fig. 4.4 based on con-
ditions specified in the AEC Cost Evaluation Guide (52). The 1200-acre
grass-covered site has level terrain and is located on the bank of'a

river. Grade level of the site is 40 ft above the river low water level

for the ultimate station capacity is assumed to be provided by the river
with an average meximum temperature of 75°F and an average minimum tem-

perature of 40°F.

4.3 Structures'

Plan views of the reactor and turbine building are shown in Figs. 4.5

and 4.6 and vertical sections in Fig. 4.7. As seen in these figures, the
reactor building and turbine building are adjacent, the secondary shield
wall forming a separation from grade to the main floor. The buildings
are two-level structures with the grade floors of the turbine and reactor
buildings at an elevation of one foot above grade, and the main floor at
36 feet above grade. The secondary shield wall extends to the main floor
and forms the walls of the lower part of the reactor end auxiliary build-
ing. |

The turbine building and the upper level of the reactor and auxiliary
buildings are steel frame structures, with insulated metal panel siding.
The arrangement of the equipment within the buildings is indicated on the
general arfangement drawings, Figs.. 4.5 and 4.7. '

A three-level steel frame and insulated metal-panel structure ad-
 joining the turbine building houses the administrative offices, control
room, switchgear, batteries, plant heating boiler and makeup water de-
mineralization plant. Lockers, showers, and toilets for plant personnel
are also located in this building. |

A 200-ft waste gas stack is provided for dispersal of plant venti-
lating air and waste gases from the various reactor and reactor equipment

rooms.

4.4 Primary System Components

The primary system components consist of the reactor vessel, modera-
tor, fuel salt pumps and fuel salt-to-intermediaste coolant salt heat ex-
changer. The arrangement of these components is shown in Figs. 4.1 and
4.2. Design and performance characteristics are summarized in the follow-

ing paragraphs.

4.4.1 Reactor Vessel

The reactor vessel is 20 ft in diameter and 37 ft high (including
expansion dome) as shown in Fig. 4.1. The vessel wall is fabricated of
2-in.-thick INOR-8. No thermal shield is required since the gamma heat-
ing of the vessel wall does not exceed 0.6 w/cc. The thickness of the
external vessel insulation and salt flow through the core-vessel annulus
can be adjusted as necessary to avoid excessive thermal stresses in the
vessel wall and at the same time minimize heat loss to the external con-
tainment space.

A 6-ft diam expansion dome at the top of the reactor vessel not only
provides surge volume but serves as the fuel salt volatiles purge loca-
tion, the UF, pellet injection point and salt sampler location. Circula-
tion of fuel salt in the dome is accomplished by recirculation of salt
from each pump discharge through an orificed 2-in. line to a point below
the normal ligquid level in the dome. This level is maintained by adjust-
ing the pressure of the helium cover gas. To minimize holdup of salt,
50% of the volume of the dome is occupied by 2-in. diam sealed INOR-8
tubes.

The reactor vessel is provided with eight inlet nozzles which dis-
charge fuel salt radially into the bottom plenum, eight outlet nozzles
leading to the pumps, together with bottom and top INOR-8 grids for sup-
port and restraint of the graphite core. These grids in turn are sup-
ported by columns or stanchions attached to the reactor vessel.

The reactor vessel specifications are given in Section 4.10.

4.4.2 Moderator Structure

The graphite matrix is composed of cylindrical logs & .in. in diameter
and 24 in. long, as shown in Fig. 4.8. These are stacked in a vertical
position and alligned by means of axial pins and sockets. Fuel-salt flows
up through the cusp-shaped passages between logs.

The "pile" is centered in the vessel by metal pins protruding from
the support plates at the bottom and top of the vessel. These are located
near the axis of the vessel and mate with a corresponding moderator log.
Initially the pile rests on the lower support grid; as the reactor is
filled with salt, the pile floats up against the upper grid. The pins,
while allowing this vertical motion, keep the central logs centered in
the vessel. The remaining logs are bound to these by means of metal hoops
passing around the peripheral logs. These hoops are fabricated from mo-
lybdenum, which has about the same coefficient of expansium as graphite.
This arrangement ellows the support grids to expand independently of the
moderator as the reactor is brought to operating temperature. Also, the
increase in height of the vessel on expansion is accommodated.

The radial profile Of temperature in the fuel-salt is flatfened by
proper distribution of the flow, which is accomplished by orificing the
flow channels. The bottom row of moderator logs is machined from hexa-
gonal pieces. A 4-in. section of the end in contact with the support
grid is not machined. If close-packed in a triengular lattice, these ends
would block compleﬁely the flow path of the fuel salt. Therefore, the
corners of the hexagons are cut away to provide orifices of appropriate

diameter for each channel.

bob.3 Fuel-Salt Circulatlng Punps

Clrculatlon of the fuel salt flow1ng at 9075 gpm is maintained by a

, centrlfugal pump as shcwn in Flg. 4.9 in each of the eight independent

~ heat exchange c1rcu1ts. Because the system hes no valves or other means

of equipment 1solat10n, the pumps are 1nstalled at the hlghest elevation
(and the highest temperature region) of the circuit between the reactor
and the prlmary heat exchanger. By this means it is pOSSlble to avoid

the hazard of seal flooding and reverse rotation at standstill and to :.

minimize some design problems related to thermal expansion, shaft seal %
and guide bearings, and maintenance accessibility. Locating the pumps SO
close to the reactor, however, introduces the prOblem‘that.the'organic
materials used in the motor winding insulation and'bearing lubricant must
be shielded from radiation. Also the pump motor and oil-lubricated bear-
ings must be located at some distance from the salt region. In the design
shown, the motor and oil-bearings are positioned above the pumps for easy
maintenance and a lower salt lubricated bearing providéd to take the
radial thrust. <Circulation of salt through this'bearing is accomplished
by allowing salt to leak upwards around the shaft and out a small vent
line. A cylindrical casing above the impeller provides expansion volume »
and a volatile fission product purging surface. The surface of salt in
this casing is maintained at the same level as that in the expansion dome | :
under a helium cover gas at 22 psi. This gas overpressure also helps |
prevent impeller cavitation.
Detailed specifications of the MSCR pumps are given in Section 4.10.

4.4.4  Primary Heat Exchanger

The design of the heat exchanger for transferring heat from the fuel
salt to the intermediate coolant salt is shown in Fig. 4.10. This shell
and tube heat exchanger is of a U tube configuration designed particularly
for accessibility to the tube sheet from above without disturbing con-
necting piping. Removal of the tube bundle through the top head is also
possible with the given design. With this configuration, however, the | o
more valuable fuel salt, which normally would be circulated through the
tubes, is put on the shell side to permit ready drainage. . The tube bundle | :
and associated baffles, which can slide into the shell from above, hang
from the tube-sheet which rests on a shelf machined into the shell. A
circumferential seal weld joins the tube sheet to the shell and separates.
the coolant from the fuel salt. A hbld-down ring keeps the tube sheet in
Place in case pressure on the shell side should exceed pressure on the
tube side. Normal design conditions regquire that the coolant salt (tube
side) be kept at a pressure higher than that of the fuel salt.

The end-closure may be sealed against leakage of coolant salt to the
outside in several ways. A bearing and sealing suiface (much like a
valve seat) is provided at point "A" shown on Fig. 4.10. A frozen salt
seal is maintained in the annulus above "A". A seal weld could be made
at the top between the flange on the shell side and the inverted head.

Or lastly, double-gaskets on circles inside and outside of the seal weld
1lip could confine leakage if the seal weld, or other seals ahead of the
seal weld, should fail. A massive hold-down flange bolted to the top
flange provides the strength necessary to hold the inverted head against
the several hundred pound pressure of the coolant salt.

A partition attached to the inverted heat fits closely into a dia-
metrical slot in the tube sheet to separate the inlet coolant salt plenum
from the outlet plenum. A small amount of by-pass flow may occur thraugh .
the very small gap between the slot and the partition. The iﬂ#erted head
is shaped so as to minimize the volume of coolent salt in the tube-sheet
distribution plenums. The inlet and outlet coolant nozzles are noncircu-
lar in cross section (flattened and broadened so as to minimize head-space
without sacrificing flow area).

Not shown are cooling and heating provisions for the top head, heat-
ing provisions for the shell or the insulation which must be provided.

In order to avoid excsssive thermal stresses in the tube sheet it may
be necessary to reduce the thermal gradient acroés the tube sheet by pro-
viding insulation between it and the fuel salt. |

An appreciable heel of coolant salt will remain in the tubes after
draining. In order that the salt-containing internals of the heat ex-
changer be exposed only to inert atmospheres when the top closure is re-
moved, the upper portion of the heat exchanger (above the coolant nozzle)
is provided with a gas-tight caisson that extends from the heat exchanger
to the locality of the maintenance equipment.

The specifications given in Section 4.10 are based on eight heat ex-
changers per reactor, each with a heat load of 1.006 x 10° Btu/hr per unit.

4.5 Intermediate Cooling System

4.5.1 Introduction

Leakage of steam into the fuel salt would result in precipitation of
uranium; therefore, a materisl which has good heat transfer properties and
is compatible with both fuel salt and steam must be interposed between
these two mﬁterials. of ﬁhe various possible choices, a barren salt of
LiF-BeF,; appears to be the most promising and is used as a basis for the
present MSCR design invelving a Loeffler steam generation system. In this
design the intermediate cooling system consists of the heat exchanger al-
ready described, coolant salt pumps, steam superheaters and steam reheat-

€rs.

4.5.2 Coolant Salt Pumps

The coolant salt pumps are similar in design to the fuel salt pumps
but have a higher capacity and head.  Eight pumps serve the sixteen super-
heaters and four reheaters and each pump circulates 13,900 gpm of coolant
salt at a temperature of 950°F and the primafy heat exchanger inlet pres-
sure of 300 psia. The developed head of the pump is approximately 270 ft.

Additional specifications for the coolant pumps are given in Section 4.10.

4.5.3 Steam Superheaters

 

Steam from the superheaters is divided among several streams. About
20% is useéd to drive the'tgrbogeﬁerators for the production of electricity;
a much smaller fraction is used to driVe other turbines which power feed-

water pumps and the steam circulators. The balance is mixed with feedwater

in the Loeffler'boiler.td'prOduce'saturated steam required in thérsuper-

A U-tube-in‘U-shéll arrengement with fixed tube sheets and counter-
current flow of coolent salt-and steam is shown in Fig. 4.11l. Coolant
salt is on the shell-side, and steam flows through the tubes. The unit is

mounted on_its side to minimize floor space. The shell-side is unbaffled

" to minimize pressﬁre drop.' The heat transfer coefficient with near-laminar

flow of coolant salt is about 15% less than for baffled flow, and requires

more tubing. To prevent fieézing of the salt, the superheate: is brought
up to operating temperature by steam generated in an auxiliary, oil-fired
boiler. _ |

Coolant salt operating between 950 and 1100°F circulates through the
shell-side. Steam enters at 670°F and 2490 psi, and leaves at 1000°F and
2465 psi.

4.5.4 Steam Reheaters

In order to provide greater energy availability for the turbine work
cycle and to provide lower pressure steam to drive auxiliary turbines, the
high pressure turbine exhaust steam is directed to the reheaters, the
auxiliary turbines, and the second feedwater heaters. The same general
design criteria apply to the reheaters as to the superheaters, although
the steam is at a lower pressure.

As with the superheaters, the reheaters are constructed of INOCR-8
and alloy steel. Eight units provide the desiréd heat transfer surface.
Again, the coolant salt flows in the shell countercurrently to the steam
passing through the tubes.  Comparable pressure drop and heat transfer
conditions exist ih the reheater as in the superheaters, ajthough baffling
(to improve heat transfer) on the shell introduces a pressure drop of

about 40 psi.
4.6 Power Generation System

46,1 Introducﬁion”-.

- Before selecting the power generation system for the MSCR a number of

‘alternative gpproaches were considered in some detail. These included the

‘use of (a) a mercury'boiler,'(b)_a "Kinyon" boilef, (c) a "Bettis" boiler,

and (d) a ﬂLoeffler"-boiler, The characteristics of these alternative

~ steam generation systems are summarized as follows.

The use of binary mercury-stéam power cycles for power generation

from solid fuel reactors has been ‘studied by Bradfute etial, (13) and

‘Randall et al. (92). Kinyon and Romie (55) considered application of the

binary cycle to molten salt reactors. The binary system, in addition to

 
 

54

mitigating the thermal stress problem, has the fur£her.adv§n£age'df.a"_
higher thermal efficiency (95). On,ihe other hand, bimetallic.heat ex-
changers are required at thé high temperaﬁure end, and'it.iéant'dbvious 7
that the fuel salt volume will be small compared to that involved in the
Loeffler system.

The "Kinyon" boiler (53) employs bayonet elements composed of three
concentric tubes. Water is introduced in the annular passage surrounding
the innermost tube and is boiled by heat transferred from superheated
 steam flowing downward in the outer annulus. Vapor is separated from the
liguid at the top of the inner annulus; the liquid is routed down the
central tube to a plenum from which it is recycled to the boiling annulus.

Vapor passes down the outer annulus; it is superheated by salt surrounding

the bayonet element and in turn boils the water rising in the inner an-
nulus. This arrangement results in tolerable thermal stresses in'the_
tubing. . The system avoids the use of steam recirculators.  Furthermore,
the bayonet tube boiler may be more compact and less expensive than the
equivalent superheaters and boilers in the Loeffler system. It is not
clear, however, that the required rate of vapor-ligquid separation can be
achieved with present technology.

The "Bettis" boiler is a modification of the "Lewis" boiler (59,55)
wherein a bayonet tube containing water and steam is inserted into a
thimble extending down into the fuel salt. An inert buffer salt occupies
the annular space between the pressure tube and the thimble, providing
thermal contact along with physical isolation. This system avoids use of
steam circulators and also eliminates the necessity for pumping the in-
termediate salt.

4.6.2 loeffler Boiler System

In the system selected for the reference design, four boilefs gen-~.
erate steam by direct cbnﬁact between the steam from the.superheaters and
the feed water from the turbine cycle. Four steam compressors circulate
the saturated steam from the boilers through the superheaters of the inert
salt system, providing steam at 2400 psia, 1000°F at the turbine throttle
and at the superheated steam inlet of the Loefflér boilers. |

C

)

55

These boilers, shown in Fig. 4.12, consist of cylindrical drums with
an inside diameter of about 72 in., with distribution pipes for super-
heated steam and feed water located on the vertical centerline and below
the horizontal centerline of each drum. Conventional cyclone steam sepa-
rators, located above the horizontal centerline and arranged in four paral-
lel rows along the inside of the drum, separate the steam from the boiling.
water. A system of scrubber-type steam driers occupies the upper part of
the drum. Tn operation, euperheated steam and feed water are mixed as
they leave the two distribution pipes and boiling occurs. The boiling
water is guided by internal baffles through the cyelone seperators where
the water is removed by centrifugal force. Steam and a small amount of
moisture flow through the scrubbers, where the steam is dried to approxi-
mately 99.7 quality. The drums are fabricated of carbon steel and are
designed for a pressure of 2625 psia. A wall thickness of 7 in. is re-
quired for an inside diameter of 72 in. and a temperature of 650°F. Each
drum is about 100 ft in length and has hemiellipsoidal heads.

4.6.3 Steam Circulators .

- The steam circulators are single;stage'axial compressors suitable
for a steam flow of approximately five million lb/hr'at a discharge pres-
sure of 2480'psia. The circﬁlators_are driven by steam turbines, using
steam from the cold reheat lines of the main turbine-generator. At design
conditions, each circulator requires a power input of 4750 BHP. Steam
from the»turbines is returned”to_the«eycle through'the feed-water heaters.
One circulator has aLmbtor-dr{Ve;suitable for full flow at design pressure
to be ueed during etart-up’ehutdbwn:' An oil- fired'package boiler, de=~
81gned for a saturated steam flow of 50, 000 lb/hr at 300 psia, is provided
for startup purposes. ' , :

The system is des1gned to operate as four 1/4 capa01ty units; each

unit consists of one Loeffler b01ler, one steam c1rculator and four super-

heaters. Valves are located accordlng to this phllosophy. Interconnec-

tions between varlous unlts are not prov1ded except at the inlet to the

 boilers and the dlscharge from the superheaters.

4.6.4 Turbogenerator

The turbogenerator"is a standard CC6F-RH unit Operating at 2400 psia
1000°F and producing a gross electrical outputéof 1083 Mw. As shown in
Fig. 4.3 the units consist of three turbines: two double-flow high pres-
sure units and one douole-flow intermediate pressure unit on one shaft
with a 667 Mw net output plus three double-flow low pressure units on
another shaft with a 416 Mw net output.

The plant auxiliaries have a maximum coincidental loading of 45,000
kws thls power results in a net station output of 1038 Mwe to the station
main power transformers.

Other characteristics of the power generation system are given in

Fig. 4.3 and summarized in Sectlon 4.10.
4.7 Reactor Control System

4.7.1 VIntroduction

The. spec1f1catlons for the MSCR control system depend on the unique
propertles of its fluid-fuel. The main mode of shim control is by adding
UF, to increase reactivity and by replacement of fuel salt with a salt
containing no fissile 1sotopes to decrease reactivity. This control is
supplemented by Operatlonal control with BF3 gas, which is sufficiently
soluble that adequate concentrations may be obtalned in the salt by regu-
lating the partlal pressure of BF3 over the salt surface in the dome.

Fuel is added to compensate burnup and flSSlon product accumulatlon.

VGreater react1v1ty control is’ requlred durlng startup and shutdown The

rstartup procedure 1nvolves a gradual increase in power, durlng whlch the

rising xenon p01son1ng (controlled by the flux level) is compensated by
the addition of new fuel. After shutdown, the reactor is sub-crltlcal
for forty hours whlle @35Xe grows 1n Ir longer shutdown is requlred

then fifty cub1c feet of fuel salt must be removed and replaced by non-

B fissile salt

Emergency shutdown, such as that requlred in a loss-of flow a001dent

is provided by injecting BF3; gas through tubes opening into the core just

~above the bottom support grid. The BF; will displace fuel, will rapidly

 
 

58

dissolve in the salt, and will diffuse into the graphite. All of these
processes will result in a rapid and large decrease in reactivity.

)

4.7.2 Shim Control

- For shim control by fuel addition or removal,.two reactivity-control
drain tanks of 50 cubic ft capacity each and a shim-control salt-addition
tank of 50 cubic ft capacity afé located in the reactor éontainment cell.
All tanks are provided with vents to the reactor dome, gas connections
to the helium pressurizing sjstem,,and Several 100 kw electric heaters
for initial véssel héating and maintaining stored salt tempefature-' The
addition tank is essentially in parallel with the 2 cubic £t salt-addition
metering teank. The drain tank is connected to the reactor_vessei upper
plenum and is installed with respect'to the reactor dome 1iQuid level so

that overfilling will not be possible. Freeze valves are used to isolate

the tanks from the reactor. The reactivity control drain tanks must have,

in addition to heating coils, decay heat removal facilities similar to the
fuel salt drain tanks. They have an independent steam condenser and heat
removal system which will be 1/20 the size of the fuel drain tenk heat

removal system.

4.7.3 Emergency Control

The BF; addition system comprises pressure cylinders manifolded to a
heater. BFs3 flow control and quick-acting injection valves are incorpo=-.-
rated in the supply line connected to the bottom plenum of the reactor
vessel. The flow control facility is operated from the. shim control in-

strumentation and the quick-acting injection system is operated from the

"scram" circuits.

The BF3 gas is stored in six 330 cubic ft, 2000 psi cylindérs located
outside and adjacent to the east wall of the reactor building. The sPeci-
fications for the reactivity-control drain tanks and the reactivity-control

salt-addition tank are givenzin'Section 4.10.

mediate coolant salt constitute the heart of the MSCR complex. The func-

tions which must be performed include melting, purifying, charging, re-

moval, storage, and sampling of the salt. These are accomplished by means

4.8.2 Fuel Salt Preparation

 

Fuel salt is received in solid form and must be liquified prior to

processing. Barren salf, having the same composition as the intermediate

coolant salt, i.e., 66% LiF and 34% BeFp, with a liquidus temperature of

851°F is used for preoperational testing and system flushing before and

after maintenance activity. A solid nmixture having this composition is

charged initially. Sufficient LiF and ThF, are added to form composition
68% LiF, 23% BeF, and 9% ThF,. All mixtures are processed through the

same equipment. After routine operation is established, flush salt is

the base material for the lithium/thorium addition process. In this man-

ner, flush salt contaminated by fission products may be consumed and

special treatment for removal of fission products will be unnecessary.

A 12-ft-high, 150 cubic ft tank enclosed by an 8-ft-high, 150 kw

furnace receives solid salt for melting. The furnace, located in the

| flush-salt storage aree,'is designed for melting approximately 7,ft3/hr.

Molten salt is transferred by pressure siphoning.

Solid salt is added by means of a tube extending from the floor above
the storage area to the melt tank. The top of the tube is flanged and
sealed. A valve is located just below the flange. The tube takes a
devious route and is provided with a helium purge to prevent back-flow of
radiocactive material and intolerable radiation levels at the open feed
point. A check valve just below the flange allows purge gas to be di=
rected into the melt tank. A portable hopper is connected to the flange
face to receive salt from the shipping containers. A portable shed covers
the work aresa to prevent the spread of toxic dust resulting from the feed

operation.

4.8.3 Coolant'Salt'Preparation

Equipment and system,deSign:are similar to that of fuel-salt melt
tank and solid salt feed. .The melt tank is located in the heat exchanger
room near the chemical treatment tank. Solid salt is fed from the floor

above. .

4.8.4 Reactor Salt Purification
The reactor fuel and flush salts are purified in the molten state
prior to charging or storing. This is done initially to remove oxides,

and subsequently, to remove oxides and other contaminants.
_Invnormal bperation,'afchemical treatment tank of 100 cubic ft ca=

'pacity located inrthe fiush'seltsstorage area receives the molten salt.

After a one-day holdup for purlflcatlon, the salt is: transferred to stor-

‘age tanks. By the addltlon of L1F and - ThF, to flush salt ‘in the melt
'tank fertlle salt is formed thls is then transferred to the fertlle salt
;-purlflcatlon tank where gaseous HF and Hg are bubbled through ‘the liquid
to remcve oxides. Subsequently, the treated salt is transferred to the

100 cublc It salt-storage tank 1nstalled at the same locatlon. ‘Flush-salt

make—up is processed in the same manner, and- through the same equipment.

- After treatment, it is transferred to a spare flush-salt tank.

For the initial charges of flush sgalt and fertile salt for the reac-

tor system, greater purifying capacity is required in order to avoid delay

 
 

62

in preoperational testing and‘power production. To fulfill this condi-
tion, HF and Hz bubbling facilities are providéd in the fertile salt stor-
“age tank -and temporary flanged-lines-arranged so that the fertile salt
tank may receivé molten salt from the melt tank, perform paertial purifi-
cation and allow transfer of the salt to the normal treatment tank. In
this manner the two tanks, fertile Storage and chemical treatment, are
placed in series to double both the purification rate and the system salt
charging rate. This procédure does not increase the sampling or analysis

requirements over those necessary for normal operation.

4.8.5 Coolant-Salt Purification

The purpose of the coolant salt purification system is to remove
impurities such as corrosion products or oxides which could cause fouling
- of surfaces and plugging of lines and tubes if allowed to accumulate. .

- It is unlikely that a single coolant. charge could be used for the
whole lifetime of the reactor without exceeding permissible concentrations
of oxides or corrosion products; however, it probably will not be neces="
sary'ﬂaembloy a continuous treatment of coolant salt. Oxides may get into
the coolant salt by accidental exposure to air or water vapor, or from
oxygen present as an impurity in the cover gas used to pressurize the |
coolant-salt systems. Although the rate of corrosion of INOR-8 surfaces
by coolant salt is low, the area of metal surface in contact with éoolant
salt is very large, so that corrosion products are certain to accumulate.

When it becomes necessary to repurify the coolant salt, it is done batch-

wise, one coolant circuit per batch, at infrequent intervals during peri~"

- ods of reactor shutdown.

If the coolant salt should'bécoﬁe'contaminated‘with fission products
or uranium as a result of a leak in the primary heat exchanger_(an event
not likely to occur because the coolant salt system is kept at a pressure
higher than that of the fuel salt), the contaminated éoolant_salt is
.drained from the affected circuit to a drain tank, and then transferred

to the chemical processing plant for disposal.

4.8.6 Reactor Salt Charging System

Fuel salt without uranium is injected into the primary reactor cir-
cuit by manual control from a small salt addition tank to replenish the
fuel salt withdrawn for chemical processing (two cubic ft per day). This
addition is made remotely and with assurance that fuel salt will not flow
back into the addition system. The make-up is fed into the reactor in a
molten cOnditien,by gravity flow or under pressure. Sufficient electrical
heating to maintain the salt in a molten condition prior to injection is
provided. o

A two-cubic-ft salt addition tank (metering tank) is located on the
wall of the biological shield at a level somewhat above the liquid level
in the reactor. The tank iS'supplied from the fertile-salt storage tank
situated in the flush salt Storage.area, Makeup is accemplished by open-
ing the freeze valve and the vent valve'between the tank and reactor dome.
The freeze-valve in the line leading to the reactor domeé must be placed
at the bottom of a loop so that when the tank is empty a heel of salt will

remain in the valve.

 

 

Molten coolant salt is injected into any one of the eight intermedi-:
ate coolant loops from the coolant drain tanks at & rate up to 600 ft3/hr.
The drain lines from several locations in each of the eight intermediate

coolant lodps'also serve as charging lines for this cperation.

4.8.8 UF, Addition Facility

During steady-state operation‘at equilibrium, about 6 kg/day of UF4.
are added to the reactor to cowpensate for burnup and a fuel w1thdrawal
of 2 ft3/day., The amount and rate of addltlon of UF,; to the reactor is
governed by react1v1ty and temperature reqnlrements. Valves 1n the UF,
addition system.must be kept gas-tlght when closed even though they must
pass SOlldS when opened but s1nce they Wlll be in a region of relatively
low radlatlon level, plastlc seats (for non-scorlng propertles) may be

used.

 
 

 

64

The UF, charged into the reactor system is prepared byﬁmixing re-
cycled urenium with fresh uranium. Pellets about 0.75-in. in diem, fab-
ricated by casting UF4 in an inert atmosphere, are charged 1nto 8 gas-
tight shielded shipping container, contalnlng an atmosPhere of dry helium
at approximately 1 atmosphere absolute pressure. At the reactor, the
shielded shipping container is mounted on the fuel charging machine (whlch
1e located above the reactor), and the mated assembly of the shipping con-
tainer and fuel charging machine is made gas-tight by bolting a gasketed
flange. Figure 4.l4 shows a schematic sketch of the UF,; addition facility.

4.8.9  Fuel Salt Drain and Storage System

Facilities are prov1ded for the drainage and storage of fuel salt
during periods of maintenance and emergency shutdown. The system is shown
on the flow diagram in Fig. 4.2. All salt circuits have drain connec-
tions; this includes the primary heat exchangers as well as the reactor
vessel. The draining of the fuel salt is accompllshed quickly, even under
emergency condition without steam flow and auxiliary power, since: without
heat removal the salt temperatures rise 300—400°F in the first half hour.
Four equally spaced 2-in. drain lines connected radially to the bottom
plenum of the reactor vessel, with l-in. interconnections to the primary
heat exchangers drain connections, will drain the reactor system in apQ
proximately one-half hour after the freeze valves are opened.

The tanks are capable of receiving the full inventory of the reactor
within half an hour, maintaining the.etored volume of salt at e tempera-
ture of less than 1400°F, and recharging it to the reactor. Gravity drain
and gas pressure are used for transferring salt.

Because forced circulation may not be available under emergency con-
ditlons, natural convection cooling is provided in small-diam cylindrical
‘vessels.‘eFifty—four_vertiCally_mounted 35-in. ID cylinders 8 ft long are
located in a 10=ft trench around_the inside periphery of the reactor con-
tainment cell. Each cylinder is irmersed in a molten alkalil metal car-
bonate bath. The carbonate mixture is contained in a double-walled tank

which serves as a boiler for the removal of decay heat from the fuel salt.

s

Fifteen-kilowatt electric heaters are arranged within the ¢carbonate mix- NG

ture annulus for fuel-salt melting following long: storage periods and.

temperature meintenance during shorter periods. The heaters are sized to
bring the salt to 1100°F in four days.

4.8.10 Coolant Salt Drain System

These drain tanks have several purposes: (a) to provide storage L
space for the complete volume of coolant contained in two (oﬁt of eight)
coolant circuits during periods when it is necessary to drain the coolant
from one circuit for maintenance; (b) to provide the reservoir. and the
application of motive force for transferring coolant salt into the reac-
tor coolant circuits during initial‘salt—charging; and (¢) to serve as a
transfer point from which coolant salt may be removed from the system and
transferred to shipping containers in ‘case it should become necessary to
process contaminated coolant salt.

The drain tanks are located at an elevation which permits the coolant
salt to flow by gravity from the reactbr coolant system into the drain
tanks. The transfer lines are valved with freeze-valves to permit flow:
to or from any one of the 8 coolant circuits. The transfer lines are
large enough to fill one coolant circuit in one hour,cusing a gas pressure

of 50 psig.

4.8.11 Spent Fuel Withdrawal System

Fuel salt is drawn from the reactor vessel drain line at about 30
psia into the vented metering tank. The metering tank is a 4-in.:(ID):by
25-ft-long cylindrical vessel located at an elevation such that when flow
stops it contains two cubic ft of fuel salt. Vent connections above the
salt in the tank lead to the dome on the reactor vessel. Decay-heat re-
moval is accomplished by radiation and convection to the reactor contain-
ment cell atmosphere. Because the heat generation rate diminishes rapidly,
the rate of removal is controlled by means of an insulated jacket 4 in.
thick surrounding the tank, and separated from it by a small air gap. A
temperature-actuated bellows opens the jacket to allow excess heat to be
radiated to the room. A 12-kw électric heater provides pfeheating and
aids in maintaining desired salt temperature when the tank is full.

After a 24-hr holdup, the salt is released by gravity drain to a
transfer tank. When a 10 £t batch of salt is. accumulated, the salt is

T

 
 

 

 

 

"

67

transferred to a shippihg'flask, which is placed in a shielded cask and
shipped by rail to a central processing plant. Spent fuel is accumulated
for about 120 days at the processing plant, and'is then processed in about
6 days.

'Should it be necessary or desirable to hold spent fuel at the reactor
site (Section 5.3.4), five 35 ft3 intermediate storage tanks are provided.
Heat is removed by boiling-water in steam jackets; the steam generated is

condensed in water-cooled condensers.

4.8.12 High level Radioactive Salt Sampler

The high level radioactive salt sampler shown in Fig. 4.15 is used
to obtain samples of fuel or flush salt from several points such as the
reactor (via the fuel withdrawal tank), the transfer tank in the shipping
area, the fuel drein tanks, or the flush-salt chemical treatment tank, and
to deliver these samples to an adjoining hot cell for chemical analysis.

Sampling is accomplished by means of access ducts located at appro-
priate points. These are mounted vertically with no pitch less than 50°
from the horizontal. They are large enough to allow the free passage of
the sample capsule, and are equipped with a sample capsule cage at the
sampling point to limit the depth in the salt melt reachéd by the capsule
and prevent the end of the cable from dipping in the salt.

The thief sampler principle is employed wherein an open sample
capsule made in the form of a thick-walled, round-bottomed bucket hanging
on a flexiblevéablé is loweréd into the salt—containing vessel. The cap-
sule sinks below the Surféce.and'is filled with salt which solidifies.when
the samplé capsule islwiﬁhdrawn.td'alcooler region above'the sample'point-
After solidification, the capsule is pulled up through the sampler access

'duct_into the sampler caviﬁy'in which is located the cable drive mechanism.

Once in the sampler cavity, the capsule is positioned over a second duct

leading to a hot analytical cell. The sample capsule is lowered through

the‘Second duct .and qepositéd;in'the hot cell. Usiﬁg_a suitable manipu-

 lator, which is part of the hot cell equipment the sample capsule is de-
tached from the end of the cable, and a new sample capsule is attached.

The new sample capsule is then pulled up into the sampler cavity in readi-

ness for another sampling operation.

The sampler cavity is connected to the hot cell and to each of the
four sample points by five separate sample access ducts. Each duct is
made of 1 1/2-in. Sch. 40 pipe and contains two 1 1/2-in. double-disc gate
valves. The bottom valve is closed only in the event the upper valve is

removed for repair or replacement

4.8.13 Coolant Salt Sampling

Coolant salt sampling connections for a portable sampling device are
provided on the eight coolant loops and the chemical treatment tank. Sam-
ples are also drawn from the eight coolant-salt pump bowls and from the
make-up salt chemical-treatment tank. A portable; single-sample holding
device receives the sample in a manner similar to that of the high level
radiocactive salt sampler, transports the sample to the hot cell area, de-
posits the sample capsule in the hot cell,;and recelves a fresh capsule
from the hot cell. The connection between the portable sampler and cool-
ant salt system is of a lock type, has a gas-tight fitting and operates in
an inert atmosphere (possibly_radioactive) from full vacuum to 200 psia

at 100°F.

4.8.14 Freeze Valves

Freeze valves are used to close off gll lines used for transferring
salt from one location to another. - These valves are formed in any size

of pipe up to 2 in. in diam,by'pinching the pipe to form a rectangular

- shaped flow passage. In a 2-in. pipe, the flattened section is about 0.5

in. thick and-2'in;,lcng,'rClbsﬁré of the valve is accomplished by freez-

ing salt inside the pipe. This is done by directing jets of cold air

‘against the top and bbttdm surfaces of the flattened portion. The air,
" supplied by a Rootes-Connersville blower, is controlled to regulate the

rate of freezing. Subsequent thawing of the salt plug is achieved in a

.féw minﬁtes“by means Qf_a.Calrod'eléétric.heater (3000 watts for a 2-in.

line) bent in a.saddleéshapéd series of turns conformal to the flat sec-

tion. This heater is easily removed for maintenance.

4+.9.2 Helium Cover Gas Supply and Distribution System

The helium inert cover gas system serves a number of functions, viz:
(a) as a pressurizing gas in various salt containing vessels for the
transfer of salt from one place to another; (b) as a carrier gas for the
removal of volatile fission products from the recycle gas purge system;
(c¢) as an inert atmosphere to protect against contamination of the salt
in places such as the UF, system, samplers, melt tank atmospheres, etc.;
which are occasionally opened to the atmosphere; (d) as a gas seal and -
bearing lubricant in molten salt pumps; (e) to provide the pressures re-
quired in the fuel salt and coolant salt circuits to prevent pump cavita-
tion, aﬁd to avoid leakage of fuel salt into the coolant salt in case of
a leak in the primary heat exchangers; and (f) to pressurize leak-detec-
tion devices at various flanged joints and disconnects. | |

Since the helium comes into contact with fuel salt or with inter-
mediate coolant salt it must be free from oxide-containing impurities such
as Hz0, S0, etc; therefore, a purification system is necessary as shown

in Fig. 4.16. The raw helium is supplied from a trailer having a capacity

of 2400 std. cubic £t is supplied from twelve 200 std. cubic £t cylinders.
As shown in the flow diagram duplicate lines of helium purification units

are provided. Lach has a capacity of 1.5 scfm.

4.9.3 Reagent Gas Supply and Disposal System

A reagent mixture consisting of 80% anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and
20% hydrogen is used to remove oxide impurities from reactor and inter-
mediate coolant salts. Unreacted reagent gas may contain radioactive
material, and thus must be handled by both the gaseous and liquid waste
disposal systems.

The reagent gases are supplied from high pressure cylinders provided
with pressure reducers and flow control instruments so that the flow may
be adjusted (Fig. 4.16). The mixed reagent gas is bubbled through molten
salt contained in the fuel-salt and the coolant-salt chemical treatment
tanks. Unreacted reagent gas passes through a potassium hydroxide (KOH)
scrubber to remove HF, and through a hydrogen burner tc remove hydrogen.
Spent caustic and condensate from the hydrogen burner may contain radio-
active material and thus must be sent to the liquid waste disposal system
for concentration and ultimate shipment to a remote disposal area. Non-
condensibles from the hydrogen burner are cooled and vented from the sys-

tem through the gaseous waste disposal system.

4.9.4 Waste Gas System

 

As mentioned previously, helium 1s passed through the dome above the
core to carry away xenon and other volatile fission products. In addi-
tion, purge gas is passed down around the shafts of the fuel pumps to
sweep away fission products diffusing toward the upper, oil-lubricated
bearings. Also, there is helium cover gas in the bowls of the pumps, in
the dump tanks, in the fuel handling system, etc., and all of these must
be purged to some extent. In order to limit radioactivity in the atmo-
sphere surrounding the reactor site, the off-gas from these various sys-
tems is passed through charccal beds to trap the fission products until

they have decayed, as shown in Fig. 4.16. A few long-lived isotopes,

particularly 85Kr,-decay'but-little in the charcoal beds, and hence con-
siderable dilution with air is required to limit the concentration of
these in the stack discharge.

If the BF; addition system is ever used to effect a "scram" of the
reactor, it will be necessary to remove the BF3 from the reactor system
before normal reactor operation can be restored. A stripped unit removes
BF3 from the recycle helium stream to avoid saturating the off-gas ad- ..

sorber as shown in the flow diagram (Fig. 4.16).

4.9.5 TLiquid Waste Disposal System

Liquid wastes originate in the drains and sumps of the various equip-
ment cells. Typical sources are hot sinks in the analytical laboratory,

cell drains in the shipping area where the shipping cask will be flushed

with decontaminants, the contaminated equipment storage and decontaminasi.c

tion cell, and spent caustic solutions from the reagent-gas disposal sys-
tem. The liquid waste system shown in Fig. 4.16 provides for holdup, con-
centration, and storage of active wastes on-site. High level wastes are
concentrated by evaporation and stored in underground tanks. Low-level
wastes may be held in underground tanks or in a low-level activity pond
until they have decayed sufficiently for discharge into the river. The
capacity of this pond is approximately 25,000 cubic ft (nearly twice the
volume of the contaminated equipment storage cell).

Intermediate wastes are-sent to ten 10,000-gallon stainless steel
retention tanks, which are ‘used: for:temporary storage until it is possible
to send the waste to an evaporator for concentration.

High level wastes from the plant and from the evaporator are sent to
a 10 OOO-gallon-waste—storage tank which provides semi-permanent storage
of these wastes, which will ultlmately be transferred to shlelded shipplng
containers for shlpment to a permanent disposal area.

Spent caustic wastes from the reagent gas disposal system are sent to

the 1ntermed1ate-level storage tank for further concentratlon and ultimate

dlsposal off- 81te |

Pumps (mechanlcal, air Jet, or steam jet) areiprovided at every sump,
at the pond, at the 10,000-gallon tanks, at the evaporator tank, and at
the 1000-gallon tanks to transfer the liquids.

 
 

 

7,

| The waste evaporator is capable of'evaporating2QO_gallpns of water
per hour using the plant'heating steem. The-condenser‘diaihs either to
the retention tank or to the low level ﬁaste pond,ﬁdepending on the ac-
tivity. A vent on the shell side allows noncondensibles to be vented to
the charcoal beds.

4.9.6 Coolant Pump ILubricating O0il Systems

These systems supply oil to the.bearings of eight pumps in the fuel
circuits and to eight pumps in the intermediate coolent loops. The two
groups of eight pumps each are supplied by two independent systems. The
lubricant is circulated under oxygén-free conditions, 120 gpm to each
pump group. The systems asre designed to 120°F supply with an. expected

0il temperature rise of 20°F.

4.9.7 Preheatigg;System

 

Prior to the admission of salt, all salt-containing piping and equip-
ment must be preheated to 900°F . This is accomplished by the use of -
several types of resistance heating. In sizes up to about 2 in., piping
is heated by passing an alternating current through the piping'itself.
All pipes heated this way are electrically insulated. Larger diameter
salt-containing pipes are heated by hinged resistance heaters (2000 w/ft)
surrounding the pipe. For large pipes (above 10 in.) a three-section
heater assembly is used. Piping fittings are covered by prefabricated
heating units. Heaters for pumps are field-fabricated.

The reactor vessel and primary heat exchangers are heated by tubular
. resistance heaters attached to the outer surfaces by means of clips on
-welded studs.

4.9.8 Auxiliary Power .

Auxiliary power is supplied at 4160 volts by e pair of auxiliary
power transformers, type OA/FA, 24-4.16 kv with. a maximum fan-cooled
rating of 25 Mva. A reserve transformer, fed from the switchyard bus,
serves as a standby unit. The loads fed at 4160 volts include all motors

rated at 150 horsepower or more, and the suxiliary power transformers

required for station lighting, 480 volt auxiliaries, and the fuel melting
and preheating systemn. _

Smaller auxiliaries, of 30 horsepower or less, and those whose con-
tinuous operation is not considered vital to station operation, are fed
from motor control centers in the vicinity of the load. Two 15 kva 480-
120 volt transformers supply a 115 volt a-c control and instrumentation
bus for each unit. An emergency supply to this bus is provided from a
15 kva inverter motor-generator set which is driven by the unit 250-volt

battery.

4.9.9 BService Water System

 

The service water system supplies river water for cooling purposes
throughout the plant, includihg the reactor auxiliaries and the turbine
plant components.. |

Water is supplied by three 15,000 gpm, half-capacity, vertical cen-
trifugal pumps. Each pump is driven by a 1250-horsepower motor, and is
located in the circulating water intake structure. During normal opera-
tion two‘pumps-supply the system with water at 100 psig, with the third
pump employed as a standby.

4.9.10 Control and Station Air Systems

The compressed air system for the plant consists of separate, inter-
connected air supplies for the station and for control purposes. The
station air system supplies hose w_r_a.ives for operating and meintenance re-
quirements throughout therstationQ Control éir is used'pfimarily for in-
strument transmitters and'airaOperated'valves.- The two*airgsystems are
cfosé.coﬁnected_so that ébmpressed.air may be supplied to the control air
system in event of a compressor failure. | | |

- The control air system of the plant supplies air-operated control
devices at & header pressure of 115 psia'énd iSfreduced to 55 psia and

45 ﬁsia for supply to various drive units and instrument transmitters.

4.9.11 Cranes and Hoists

A single traveling bridge crane serves the reactor and steam turbine

buildings. Its lifting capacity is based on handling the rotor of the

 
 

76

low pressure steam turbine-generator, which weighs about 150 tons. The

bridge span is 130 ft, and the crane'lift is sufficient to reach the.low-_»

est portion of the building. All heavy equipment coming into the building
by rail may be handled by the crane. Its capacity is sufficient to allow
removal of all components>within the reactor primary shield eicept the

reactor.

_4.9.12 Instrumentation and Control

The requirements for instrumentation and control of the turbine sys-
tems are similar to those of the turbine system in a conventional fossil-
fuel power plant. |

Instrumentation for the reactor system.monitofs the reactor neutron
flux, primary system pressures, temperatures, levels, and flow raﬁés, and
provides control and alarm signals to actuate the appropriate device or
to call for operator action when changes occur in the measured quantities,
through either changes in load or malfunction of system components.

Control and instrumentatibn panels are located in the control room,
for convenience of reading, recording and operating the most important
quantities and components. Other auxiliary control panels or isolated
instruments may be located at appropriste places in the plant; area radia-
tion monitors, alarm or warning signals, hydrogen and seal 0il controls

for the generators, etc.

4.9.13 Plant Utilities

The plant utilities include those systems that are provided for moni- -

toring plant equipment, dispoéing of nonradioactive wastes, safety of
personnel, protection of equipment and for heating, ventilating and air-
conditioning the plant buildings. Theée systems do not differ appreciably
from those provided for conventional plants. '

5. TFUEL PROCESSING

5.1 Reprocessing System

 

Fluorination of spent fuel from the MSCR to reoover isotopes of ura-
nium, followed by discard of the carrier salt (containing LiF, BeF2, ThFy,
and fission product fluorides), was selected as the method of processing
for several reasons: (a) The fluorination process is well adapted for
future integration with the reactor plant (sharing shielding and mainte-
nance facilities and personnel) with appreciable potential reductions in
fuel cycle cost (Sec. 6.9); (b) thetneoeSSity for holding the spent fuel
for decay of badioactivity:is'eliminated; (¢) no development is required;
the plant may be designed and costed on the basis of current technology.

In order to use the next.ﬁost applicable process, Thorex, it would be
necessary to develop special head-end and tail-end steps for converting
spent fuel from the fluoride to the nitrate and back again. Also it would
be necessary to hold the spent fuel prior to processing for not less than
120 days (to average the equivalent of 90 days of cooling). Further, there
is some‘uncertainty conceﬁning'the effect of fluoride ion on the chemistry
of the aqueoﬁs separationé; On ‘the other hand, the thorium could be recov-
ered, and perhaps also the carrler salt could be recovered free from con-
tamination with rare earth 1sotopes.: It would, however, be contaminated
with the isotopes Cd4d, Sr;oAg; Cs,zse, Ba, and Te.

'The processing-costs for the'MSCR;fuel have been estimated for both

processes,

5.2.1 Process Desi&a

The steps of the proposed fluorination process are indicated in
Fig. 5.1, Spent fuel is transferred from the shipping containers to pre-
fluorination storage by applying gas pressure or by siphoning. = The fuei
is then introduced batch-wise into the fluorinators where it is treated
with elemental fluorine, possibly diluted with some inert gas, at about
1000°F, The effluent UF6 is absorbed in beds of NaF at 200°F,,is«iater
desorbed at 700°F and collected in cold traps at -45°F, Periodically the
cold traps are warmed, and the decontaminated UF6 is ‘collected in cylinders,
The fluoride volatility process does not provide for recovering
thorium or any of the componénts of the carrier salt. Conseqﬁently,after

fluorination the LiF-BeF —ThFu-FP melt is drained into interim waste stor-

2

age, and later transferred to permanent waste storage such as,.for-example,'

- in a salt mine., The interim storage period has been taken to be 1100 days,
a value corresponding to the most favorable economic balance between on-
site and permanent storage charges for this particular process,

It will be observed that 233pa is not recovered in this process. An
analysis of Pa recovery versus discard disclosed that additional process
equipment and building space requirements made the recovery of Pa.
uneconomical., ,

A major problem in the desigﬁ of vessels which contain irradiated salt
is that of heat removal, Volumetric heat release rates are high, and the
temperature of the heat source is considerably greater than that of con-
ventional heat sinks (such as cooling water from rivers or wells), In the
design evolved, heat is transferred acroés an air gap into water, The
principal heat transfer mechanism is radiation; convection accounts for
perhapsrs'to'lo per cent of the transfer. This arrangement, in addition
to controlling the heat transfer rate at tolerable levels, provides'iso-
lation of the coolant from the moltep_salt so that a leak of either stream

through its containment wall does not contaminate the other stream.

The fluorinators are cooled by circulating air through the cell. 1In
the case of the prefluorination storage tanks, radiation from storage
vessels to a concentric tank in a water bath provides sufficient cooling
for 5-day-old fuel salt,

Wherever possible, the equipment was patterned after that used in the
ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant described by Milford (66), Carr (18), Cathers
et al. (22, 23), :

5.2,2 Shipping

Shipment of irradiated fuel is made in a lead shielded carrier shown
in Fig. 5.2. The cask is equipped with a water-cooling system which is
able to absorb decay heat radiated from the salt container and to disSipate
this heat to the atmosphere via finned tube exchangers fastened to the out-
side of the cask., Heat transfer may be either by boiling the water in fhe
inside jacket followed by condensation in the outside exchanger, or by
natural convection. | |

The shipping container (also used for waste disposal), is designed to

hold ~10 £t3 salt which is about six days accumulation at the reactor dis-

charge rate of 1,67 ft3/day. For this design it has been assumed that the

processing plant is located 500 miles from the reactor site and that ship-
ment will be made by rail. The round trip, including filling and emptying,
is anticipated to take 10 days. The average age of spent fuel at shipment

is approximately 5 days.

5.2,3 Prefluorination Storage Tanks

3 tanks receive up to 120 days supply of

One hundred and sixty 30 ft
spent fuel from each of a number of reactor sites., When a 120-day batch
is completed, the tanks are removed from their cooling jackets to .the
transfer area where the material is transferred to 6-ft3 metering transfer
tanks, From these tanks the spent fuel can be transferred by gravity or
inert gas pressure to the fluorinators.

The cooling jackets for the prefluorination storage tanks are stéin-
less steel tanks 2.2 ft in diameter by 12 ft high immersed in a water bath.

Cooling is achieved principally by radiation from the storage tank to the

should heating be required.,

5.2.4 Fluorinator

The design shown in Fig. 5.3 has been successfully operated in the
ORNL Fluoride Volitility Pilot Plant (18)., Surmounting the fluorination
chamber is a de-entrainment section. The lower chamber is surrounded by an
electrically-heated furnace while the upber is heated with electrical strip
heaters, Five units are required, each having a capacity of 6 £t3, The
corrosion rate is about 1 mil per hour of fluorination time; hence the
fluorinator must be inexpensive and accessible for frequent replacement,
It was designed to dissipate decay heat and heat of reaction to the atmos-
phere in the cell through a wall 1/2 in. thick at a temperature of SO00°F.
The preferred materials of construction are either INOR-8 or Alloy 79-4
(70 per cent Ni, 4 per cent Mo, 17 per cent Fe). L-Nickel has been used
for fluorinator construction but is susceptible to intergranular attack.

Spent fuel is fluorinated batchwise at about 1000°F., It takes about
6 hours to volatilize the uranium (99.9+%) from a 6 ft3 batch, In current
practice the attack of fluorine on the vessel is severe, The high rate of
corrosion is believed to result from the combined action of liquid salt
and gasedus fluorine phases, However, several lines of improvement are
under investigation., These include fhe use of the "frozen wall" fluori-
nator (35) wherein a layer of solid salt is maintained on the vessel wall
by proper control of the cooling, and this layer protects the wall,
Another approach consists of spraying the molten salt into a relatively
cool atmosphere of fluorine. Uranium hexafluoride is formed in and rapidly
removed from the microdroplets which then cool and freeze before they
strike the wall. Not only are the wall temperatures lower, but there is no
liquid phase in contact with the wall, | |

The fluorides of some fission products, notably Mo, Zr, Nb, Cs, Ru,

and Te are volatile and accompany the UF These are separated from the

60
uranium in the CRP trap and NaF absorber described below. It is not ex-

pected that the fluoride of Pa will be volatile under conditions specified,

Protactinium will remain in the barren salt and be lost to waste. The loss
amounts to about 10 g/day in the reference design reacfor, and studies have
shown that it is not economical to recycle the barren salt to the fluori-
nators after holding it to allow the Pa to decay. The cost increase of
additional fluorinator capacity and interim storage‘vessels more than off=-

‘sets the value of the 233y pecovered.

5.2,5 CRP Trap and NaF Absorbers

After leaving the fluorinator, UF. and accompanying fission product

fluorides pass into a two-zoned NaF ab:orption system, The first, called
the complexible radioactive products (CRP) trap is operated at about 400°C
and removes fluorides of chromium5\zirconium,,niobium, cesium, strontium,
and rare earths, as well as entrained salt partiéles° Uranium hexafluoride
is not absorbed here, but is absorbed iﬁ-the second zone operated at 100°C,
along with the fluorides of molybdenum and ruthenium, and traces of others.
Some ruthenium carries through into the fluorine recirculation system.

Uranium is recovered from the beds by desorption at 400°C, It is
collected in cold traps described below. o

The stationary bed absorber, shown in Fig. 5.4, contains just over
one cubic foot of NaF, Six unites are required. Each is mounted in a
lightweight, low-heat capacity electric furnace which opens on-hinges for
removal of the absorber. A cooling-heating tube 2-1/2 inches OD carrying
coolant and containing electric heaters extends through the center of the
bed., An interior cylindrical baffle forces the process stream to follow a
U-shaped path through the bed, '

Design limitations arise in the rate at which the bed'temperature can

be cycled and the bed thickness, The granular bed is a rather effective

insulator and must be made in thin sections to facilitate heating and cool-

ing. The absorbers therefore have large length-diameter ratios,
When the bed becomes saturated with fission products, the absorber is
removed from the furnace, emptied, and recharged remotely in a 4-5 day

cycle,

These are similar to those used in the ORNL Fluoride Volatility Pilot
Plant as shown in Fig., 5.5. Two traps are mounted in series., The first
is operated at about -u40°C and the second at =60°C,

Adequate surface for rapid transfer of heat and collection of solid
UF6 must be provided. The components must have small thermal inertia so
that the temperature may be changed quickly. During defrosting, the traps

are heated to 90°C at 46 psia to allow UF_ to melt and drain to collection

6
cylinders,

5.2.,7 Reduction Reactor

The reduction of UF6 to UFl+ is accomplished in a reactor patterned
after that described by Murray (70) and consists of a 4-in. diam by 10-ft
high column, Upranium hexafluoride and flourine are mixed with excess H2 in
a nozzle at the top of the reaction chamber. The uranium is reduced in the
BQ- _
in molten salt of suitable composition. Gaseous materials are discharged

F, flame, and falls to the bottom of the chamber where it is collected

through a filter. The reactor has a capacity of 10-15 kg of UF6 per hour,
Losses are very low and typically are less than 0.1l per cent.

5.2.8 Transfer Tanks

Stripped fuel is drained from the fluorinators into transfer tanks
(two each) from whence it is distributed to interim waste storage tanks,
The transfer tanks have capacities of 60 £t3, Decay heat is radiated from
the surface of the tank through a 1/2 in. air gap to a water-cooled jacket.
While being held in the transfer tanks, the salt is treated with He or
other inert gas to remove tfaces of F2 of HF that would increase corrosion

in the waste storage tanks,

5.2,9 Waste Storage‘Tanks

Waste salt is stored in stainless steel shipping cylinders 2 ft in
diam by 8 ft long. These are placed at the bottom of steel thimbles
2,75 ft in diam and fifteen feet long which dip into a water-filled

canal. Heat is dissipated by radiation and convection across the 4-inch

air gap, through the thimble wall and into the water, After cooling, the

tanks are shipped to a salt mine for permanent storage.

5.2,10 Freeze Valves

Conventional valves cannot be used with molten salts. Flow stoppage
is achieved by freezing a plug of salt in a section of a line with a jet of
cooling air. Electric heaters are used to thaw the plug when flow is

desired, A freeze valve for the MSRE is shown in Fig. 5.6.

5:,2,11 SamBlers

The apparatus pictured in Fig, 5.7 is being tested for use_wifh the -
MSRE (12), Essential features are the hoist and capsule for removing the
sample from the vessel; a lead-shielded cubicle with manipulator, heating .
elements and service piping, and a transport cask for removing the sample
from the process area. The sampling cubicle is mounted on the cell biolo-

gical shield in an accessible area.

5.2,12 Biological Shield

Calculations were made using the Phoebe program for the IBM 704 com-
puter, In the study by Carter, Milford, and Stockdale (21), on which the
present estimate is based, spent fuel was brought to the processing plant
immediately after removal from the reactor, and the shield was accordingly
made quite thick, In the present instance, the fuel is cooled at the pro-
cessing plant for not less than 90 days so that the shielding requirements
are not as extreme, However, in order that the central plant héve more

general utility, no reduction in shield thickness was made.

5.2.13 Process Equipment Layout

Process equipment is laid out according to the major process opera-
tions: prefluorination storage, fluorination, transfer, NaF absorption,

cold traps and product collection, UF, =+ UFu reduction, and interim waste

6
storage. Equipment is grouped in cells according to activity level and in

an arrangement that minimizes distances between vessels. Three transfers

i;;-

of molten salt are required in the processing sequence.

Interim waste storage vessels are located adjacent to the processing
area in a large canal,

To facilitate remote maintenance, vessels are arranged so that all
equipment is accessible from above, and all process and service lines can
be connected remotely. Over-all building space is dictated by remote

maintenance considerations rather than by actual vessel size,

5.2.14 Plant Layout

In order to establish uniformity in cost estimation of nuclear power
plants, the Atomic Energy Commission has specified certain ground rules
(52) covering topography, meteorology, climatology, geology, availability
of labor, accounting procedures, fixed charge rates, etc. These ground
rules were used in this study.

Advantage was taken of a design study and operating experience with a
remotely maintained radioactive chemical plant reported by Farrow (32) to
obtain over-all plant arrangements, as shown in Fig,., 5.8.

The hypothetical site location is 500 miles from the reactor site,

The plant is located on a stream that is navigable by boats having up to
6-ft draft. There is convenient highway and railroad access. The plant is
located on level terrain in a grass-covered field., The earth overburden is
8 ft deep with bedrock below,

5.2,15 Capital Cost Estimate

The cost of the fuel processing plant was apportioned among three
principal categories: building costs, process equipment costs, and auxil-
iary process equipment and services costs. The building costs included
such items as site preparation, structural materials and labor, permanently
installed equipment, and material and labor for service facilities. Proc-
ess equipment costs were calculated for those tanks, vessels, furnaces, and
similar items whose primary function is directly concerned with process
operations. Process service facilities are items such as sampling facili-
ties, process piping and process instrumentation which are intimately asso-

ciated with process operations.

Accounting Procedure. — The accounting procedure set forth in the
Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52) was used as a guide in this
estimate, This handbook was written as a guide for cost-estimating reactor
plants, and the accounting breakdown is not specific for a chemical proc-
essing plant. Where necessaryithe accounting procedures of the handbook
were augmented,

Process Equipment. = A large number of process vessels and auxiliary
equipment in these plants is similar to equipment previously purchased by
ORNL for the fluoride volatility pilot plant for which cost records are
available, Extensive use was made of these records in computing material,
fabrication and over-all equipment costs. In some cases it was necessary
to extrapolate the data to.obtain costs for larger vessels, Items that
were estimated in this'manner-include the fluorinators, furnaces, NaF
absorbers,'and CRP traps. The cost of the UFg-to-UF, reduction unit was
based on a unit described by Murray (70). The unit had a larger capacity
than was needed for these plants, but it was assumed that the required
unit would have about the same over-all cost. Refrigeration equipment and
cold traps were estimated from cost data on ORGDP and ORNL equipment,

For vessels and tanks of conventional design, the cost was computed
from the cost of materialp(INOR—B for most ressels) plus an estimated fab-

rication charge, both charges being based on the weight of the vessel., A

summary of values used in estimating'process vessels by weight is given in

Table 5.1. Some”items of processrequipment were of special design and sig-
nificantly different from any .vessels for which cost data were available,
For the shells of the prefluorination storage_tanks, the high fabrication

cost values shown were obtained by comparison with an available shop esti~

mate for a similar vessel., .

,{ Auxiliary process items such as process piping, process electrical

service, 1nstrumentation, sampling connections and their installation were

not considered in sufficlent design detail to permit direct estimation. A

cost was a531gned to these items which was based upon previous experience

- in d351gn and cost estimation of radiochemical proce351ng plants, 1In

'aSSLgnlng these costs cognlzance_was taken of the fact that the plant is

remotely maintained.

Buildings. — The building estimate shown in Table 5.2 included the
cost of land acquisition, site preparation, concrete, structural steel,
painting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, elevators, cranes,
service piping, laboratory and hot cell equipment, etc. The individual
costs were calculated using current data for materials and labor, and were
based on the drawings prepared. |

Process Equipment Capital Cost. = Process equipment capital costs for
the two fluoride volatility plants are presented in Table 5.3, These costs
are the totals of material, fabrication and installation charges,

Building Capital Cost. = As mentioned above, process equipment and
buildings were the only items considered in sufficient design detail to
permit direct estimation. The remainder of the capital costs were esti-
mated by extrapolation from pfevious studies of radiochemical processing
plants, The fact that the piant is remotely maintained was an important
factor in estimating process instrumentation and electrical and sampling
connections, These items are expensive because of counterbalancing,
spacing, and accessibility requirements, |

Construction overhead fees were taken at 20 per cent of direct

materials and labor for all buildings, installed process equipment, piping,

5.2.18 MSCR Unit Processing Cost

The various bases and contributions to the unit processing cost are
collected in Table 5,8 for the fluoride volatility central plant process-
ing of MSCR fuel. For the feference design fuel containing 32 kg of
thorium per fta, the unit cost was $36.90 per kg of thorium,

Although the cost was expressed in terms of $/kg of Th, it should be
remembered that only isotopes of uranium are recovered. Stripped salt,
containing valuable thorium, lithium-7, and beryllium, as well as fission
prdducts; is discardéd;"Additional.br alternate processing would be re-

. quired to recover any of these components.,

5.3 Thorex Central Plant

The reference plant described in the Guide (52) is a central facility
capable of processing 1000 kg Th/day with thorium discard or 600 kg Th/day
with thorium recovery. The plant was designed specifically for thorium
metal or thorium oxide fuels; however, since other types of thorium fuels
were not specifically excluded, it was assumed that the piant would also
accept a fluoride-salt fuel, It was further assumed that the fluoride fuel
would be processed at the same base charge as the metal or oxide fuel.

This assumption amounted to assigning the same charge to a fluoride head-
end treatment as to dissolution and feed preparation steps for the other
fuels, The tail-end treatment for the conversion of Thorex nitrate product
to fluoride feed material was assigned a cost that was thought to be repre-

sentative of the processing steps.

5.3.1 Head-End Treatment

The head-end treatment shown schematically in Fig. 5.9 has not been
demonstrated, However, the chemical principles have been established (40)
by laboratory investigations of the stability of fluoride salt fuels.,

It is known (40) that the oxides of uranium, thorium and beryllium are

very stable compounds having the indicated order of stability
U0, > BeO > ThO,

and that oxygen or oxygen-bearing compounds must be eliminated from fluo-
ride salt fuels to insure their stability, In the proposed head-end treat-
ment, the draw-off from the reactor at 500 - 550°C would be contacted in a
spray with steam or high temperature water (v200°C) to precipitate the
oxides of uranium, beryllium, thorium, protactinium and some of the fission
products., It is believed that rare earth oxides can be precipitated in
this manner. Lithium fluoride is a very stable compound and would probably
not enter into reaction with water. It should remain in the system as LiF
and be frozen into small crystalline particles.

The hydrolysis would fofm large quantities of HF which in aqueous
media is rather corr?osiire° Therefore the selection of materials of con-
struction for the precipator will be a pr-bblem° Dispbsal of HF can be
accomplished by dilution with large volumes of air and dispersion from a
stack or by neutralization with an inexpensive base. Some cleanup of the
HF stream will be required because of volatile fission products. Reuse of
this HF in the subsequent hydrofluorination step (see Fig. 5.8) may not be

~ feasible because of water vapor in the gas.

The second step in fhé’head-end treatment is dissolution of all the
hydrolyzed components that are soluble in nitric acid, The oxides of

uranium, thom.ums protact;nlum and rare earth products should dissolve

quite readlly, Since lithium fluor;de and beryllium oxlde are quite in- |

soluble in aqueous medxa,_neglxglble amounts of these compounds should be

- dissolved. Also, it is almost certain that some of the fission products
will be insoluble and remain with the lithium and beryllium. Dissolution
'should proceed smoothly because it has been shown by Pitt (73) that the

particle sizes produced when a molten salt is sprayed into water are in the

micron and submicron range,

Dissolution is followed by solid-liquid separation either by filtra-
tion or centrifugation. Aqueous nitrate solutions are fed into a feed
adjustment step preceding solvent extraction by Thorex and the insoluble
material is routed to hydrofluorination., At this point a portion of the
solids can be discarded as a purge of fission products that remain in the

precipitate.

5.3.2 Solvent Extraction

Decontamination of thorium and uranium can be accomplished by well-

established Thorex procedures. Aqueous nitrate solutions are evaporated

until about 0,15 N acid deficient and fed to an extraction column. In the
extraction column both thorium and uranium are extracted into an organic

phase (tributyl phosphate) leaving the bulk of the fission products in the

" aqueous phase, with decontamination factors up to 105.

Waste from the first extraction cycle contains all of the protactinium

that was in the feed stream. However, the amount is insufficient to war-

‘rant recycling the waste after an additional decay period. In the interim

between discharge from the reactor and chemical processing, the fuel ages
about 120 days so that only about 15% of the protactinium remains undecayed.
The waste is given permanent'storage in large underground tanks.,

In a fuel recycle system such as the MSCR it is not necessary to de-

~contaminate further by the use of additional extraction cycles. The pres-

ence of 232U and 228Th will make recycle fuel too radiocactive for direct
handling, regardless. After extraction, therefore, it is sufficient to

paftition-uraniuﬁ andtthorium in a stripping'column_by the proper adjust-

‘ment of organic and aqueous flow rates. In this operation, thorium is
 stripped from the_organié phasé into an aqueous phase; uranium remains in
the orgénic“phase,r A-subsequept-stripping operation returns the uranium
to the aqueous phase. _The'prdduce:streams are'respectively Th(NO,), and

U02(N0 '

3)2;-”

' 5.3;3 Tail-End Treatment

Fuel reconstitution begins with acceptance of the nitrate products

from the solvent extraction plant, It is necessary to convert the nitrates

 

 

 
it

 

 

122

to the fluorides. In the case of thorium this is accomplished by pre-
paring the oxide in a denitration process followed by hydrofluorination in

a molten salt mixture, The steps are as follows:

 

steam denitration HF
1-—--—-——”
Th(NOa) “400°C = Th02 in molten salt™ ThF
(nv600°C)

Steam denitration is an established procedure in the sol-gel process
(33) for preparlng highly fired, dense ThO2 or ThO2 UO2 fuel, In this
case the aqueous nitrate solution from the Thorex process would be evapo-
rated to crystallize Th(NOS)u;

superheated steam for the actual denitration. Final preparation of the

the crystals in turn would be contacted with

fluoride has to be accomplished in a second high temperature operation in

-molten fluoride salts. Thorium oxide is quite intractable to attack by

hydrogen fluoride under most conditions; however, in the presence of molten
fluorides the reaction will occur., The presence of other high valence com-
pounds, e.g., other thorium or uranium fluorides, in the melt abets the
dissolution.

The conversion of uranyl nitrate to the tetrafluoride is not as
straightforward as that of thorium because of the required valence change,
In the Excer process developed at ORNL, uranyl nitrate from the last Thorex
stripping column can be fed directly onto a cation exchange resin
(Dowex 50 W) which absorbs the uranyl ion. After loading, the resin is
eluted with aqueous hydrofluoric acid to produce UOze, which is reduced in
an electrolytic cell. The aqueous solution is allowed to flow into a
mercury cathode in which UF, ¢ 0.75 H,0 precipitates from the aqueous
phase. The precipitate is separated by centrifugation or filtration and
dried. Water of hydration is not tenaciously held, and moderate drying
conditions are sufficient to expel it.

A second method of converting 002(N03) to UF, is to reduce U(VI) to
U(1IV) in the presence of fluoride at 500 - 600°C, In this tail-end treat-
ment the two nitrate solutions of thorium and uranium are mixed and co-
denitrated using superheated steam to yield ThO2 and 003° The mixed oxides
are converted to the fluorides in a 500 - 600°C molten fluoride salt bath

(}

 
 

 

123

by contacting with a gaseous mixture of H, + HF. Uranium is reduced by

the hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride to theztetravalent form and dissolves
as UFu; thorium is metathesized to Tth which also dissolves in the melt.
The processing cycle is completed when the uranium fluoride is mixed
with fluorides of thorium9 lithium, and beryllium oxide plus make-up feed
and hydrofluorinated. Beryllium recycled as Be0O dissolves as BeF, when

hydrofluorinated in molten fluoride solutions,

5.3.4 Processing Costs

 

The unit processing costs were computed according to the prescription
given in Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation, Vol., 4, Section 460, The
escalated daily charge for operation of the Thorex plant was taken as
$17,500 in late 1962, Since the thorium was recycled,'the capacity was
600 kg/day. As described in a previous section, the daily increments of
fuel withdrawn from the reactor were accumulated for 120 days and combined
into a single processing batch, If the withdrawal rate exceeded
1.25 ft3/day (40 kg Th/day), the batch size exceeded 4800 kg of Th and re-
quired eight days or longer to process, For this range of process times,
the "turn-around-time" is specified to be eipght days in the Guide, Thus .
the total processing time is 120r/600 + 8 days (where r is the withdrawal
rate in kg Th/day) and the total amount processed is 120r kg of Th. The

cost for operating the Thorex plant is thus

- 17,500 [wc-“o” + 8]'

the daily'operéting cost (io#);"itseEmsAlikely that the cost of convert-

ihg the MSCR fuel by'the method pﬁopoéed in Sec, 5.2 would be less costly
than the reduction of solid fuel elements by Darex or Zircex. However, an
investment of $500,000 for MSCR fuel head-end treatment was allowed, based

 
 

 

124

on estimates extracted from reference 20, This resulted in a head-end
treatment charge of $0.53/kg Th processed.

The cost of converting recovered thorium nitrate to ThFu was not given
in the Guide. However, the cost of converting low enrichment uranium to
UF6 was only $5.60/kg. Since the proposed thorium conversion process is
simpler and shorter than the uranium process, it seemed adequate and con-
servative to assign a cost of $5.00/kg Th for the conversion of ThE,,.

Summing these charges, one has

Processing Plant Cost;= (34,7 + 1167/r) $/kg

where r = kg Th/day removed from the reactor.

Shipping costs are presented in Section 465 of the Guide (52), and
include freight, handling, cask rental, and property insurance. The cost
is $16/kg of uranium (or thorium) for spent fuel elements,

MSCR fuel must be packaged before shipment. 1In the scheme proposed,
the daily productions of 1.67 ftalday are accumulated in 35 ft3 batches in
the spent fuel facility (Sec. 4.8.10) which contains 5 tanks each having a
capacity of 35 ft3 and provided with sufficient cooling to remove afterheat
from freshly irradiated fuel., A 10 ft3 batch is drained into an INOR
"bottle" (cylinder) one foot in diameter and 13 feet long. This is in-
serted into an individual shipping cask and transported to the Thorex
plant, If the bottles cost as much as $10,000 apiece, but are re-usable
for at least 10 years, they will add to the shipping cost only $1,74/kg Th
at the lowest rate of processing (40 kg/day).

The charge for shipping decontaminated thorium back to the plant is
represented to be $1.00/kg in the Guide.

Since the processing plant operating charge was all levied against
the thorium, the only charges on the uranium are shipping at $17/kg per
round trip and reconversion, for which operation the Handbook gives
$32/kg for converting the nitrate of highly enriched 235y to UFG, Although
'the‘cost of conversion to UFu should be less, the given cost was assumed.
The total charge for the uranium was thus $49/kg, and was charged against

all isotopes of uranium, including 238y and the precursor, 233pa,

S5.u Comparison of Processing Cost Estimates

For the purposes of comparison, the results of three other processing
cost studies are cited. The first, by Carter (20), dealt with a central
Fluoride Volatility plant designed especially for processing MSCR fuel at
a rate of 31.5 fta/day (1000 kg Th/day). The estimates were based on the
same design study (21) used to prepare the estimates reported in Sec., 5.2,
The scaling, however, was performed on the plant as a whole, rather than
with individual items, and the scaling factor was 0.31. The estimated cap-

ital cost was $31.5 million, and the annual operating expense was $3.0

million. This study is referred to below as the "CMS" study.

The second study, also by Carter (20), dealt with a central Thorex
facility adapted to process fluoride fuels (1000 kg Th/day) and was based
on a detailed analysis of the head-end and tail-end processes (described
in the previous section) as well as the Thorex separation process, and
was based on an unpublished design and cost study performed by Carter,
Harrington, and Stockdale at ORNL in which flow sheets, equipment specifi-
cations, plant arrangement draw1ngs building drawings, etc, were prepared
and the items were costed. For brevity, this study is referred to below
as the "CHS" studyo It'iS, essentially, an lndependent estimate of the

facility assumed in the Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52),

“adapted for fluoride fuels. The estimated capital oost, scaled to a capac-

,lty of 1000 kg Th/day, was $36 5 mllllon, and the annual operating expense

was $3.6 mllllon._tf. : | | - o
The thxrd study, performed by W, H Farrow, Jr, (32), dealt with sev-

eral radxochemlcal separatlon plants for several dlfferent solid fuels and

rfclads and with both dlrect and remote malntenance, The purex process, which

is simllar to Thorex, was employed for the separations, The most applicable

case was that of a remotely maintalned plant capable of treatlng one tonne

'"per day of natural uranlumoi Although the process was descrlbed in consid-
':erable deta11 a cost breakdown was not given by Farrow, The capital cost

‘was $43 mllllon, and the annual dlrect operating cost was$3‘7inillion.' One

mlght reasonably assume that a Thorex plant of the same capac1ty would have
approx1mately the same costs, and that the head and tail-end treatments for
fluoride fuels would be no more expen31ve, ‘and perhaps less, than.those of

the solid fuels,

 
 

126

It is seen that the estimates of the total cost, including shipping,

- vary by a factor of two, ranging from $37‘tq $75/kg of thorium processed.
It seems plausible that processing MSCR fuel' in a-central Fluoride Volatil-
ity facility will cost less than $50/kg, and possibly less than $40, and
that processing in a Thorex plant will cost less than $70, and possibly
less than $50 per kg of thorium, | : | |

6. FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
6.1 Analysis of Nuclear System

The nucléar calculations for the MSCR were performed by means of the
MERC-1 program for the IBM-7090, This program, described by Kerlin et al.,
in Appendix D, uses the mnltigroup neutron diffusion code Modric and the

isotope code ERC-10 as chain links,

6.1.1 Computer Pbograms

Modric., ~ This program was employed in a 34-group version using the
group energies and cross sections of the various elements given in refer-
ence 54, The cross sections were adopted for the most part from Nestor's
tabulation (72), with some minor modifications described below, Maxwell-
Boltzman averaged thermal cross sections and resonance integrals of impor-
tant materials are listed in Table 6.1. Thermal spectrum hardening was
ignored,

Although the treatment of downscattering in Modric provides for the
transfer of neutrons from any group into any of the ten next lower groups,
the required scattering matrices were not available when the MSCR calcula-
tions were begun. Subsequently, the matrices were computed taking into
account fast fissions and inelastic scattering in thorium and the fact that
the elastic scattering lethargy decrements were in some ranges larger than
the group widths., A single caloulation was made to defermine the impor-

tance of treatlng the downscatterzng in thls more precise manner. The

effect was found to be 1ns;gn1f1canto

of nuclear data (breeding ratio, mean eta, neutron balance, etc.), process-
ing data (feed and produotion_rates),rand a fuel.cycle cost (inventory,
make-up processing, etc.). An examination of these data discloses the
principal items of cost and suggests changes in specifications which might
reduce these. In some cases, the effect of changing an input parameter is
not readily predietable; e.g., increasing the concentration of thorium in
the fuel stream usually increases the conversion ratio and so reduces the
23%) feed requirements but on the other hand increases the fissile inven-
tory. In cases such as this,'the input parameters are varied systemati-
cally in a "factored" set of calculations yielding the maximum information
from a minimum number of cases. The fuel cycle cost is thus optimized

with respect to several variables simultaneously. (See Section 6.4.1.)

6.1.2 Reactor'PhySics Model

The reactor was computed as a homogeneous mixture in equivelant spher-
ical geometry (i.e., the input diameter was 1,09 times the diameter of the
cylindrical core); Thus'the heterogeneity of the core, which is appreci-
able, was ignored. Butathis_treatment is conservative in that the reso-
nance escape is underestimated, resulting in a pessimistic estimate of the
mean eta of the system. In regard to the estimated captures in thorium,
these can always be matched at some neighboring concentration. Aside from
a minor effect on the spectrum of neutrons, the chief error introduced is
a slight underestimate of the thorium invenfOry, But this is not important,
for the 1nventory charges contrlbute only a small portlon of the total fuel
costs (less than 5%). ' J

annulus about one inch thick filled with fuel salt, and a spherlcal reactor

'assumed to be 1200°F, and this temperature was also assxgned to the graph-

1te, which however, may run two or three hundred degrees warmer.

arrangement of the reactor and equipment associated with the extraction of

heat from the fuel stream, as they affect fuel cyc_:lercosts° - L

6.2,1 Maximum Fuel Temperature

It is believed that the rate of corrosion of INOR will be very'small
and that the heat exchangers'will have a very long lifetime if the temper-
ature of the fuel solutioh does not exceed 1300°F (12). The maximum
allowable temperature may be higher; if so, future generations of molten-
salt reactors will be able to achieve higher specific powers and higher

thermal efficiencies,

6.2.2 Minimum Fuel Temperature

For this, 1100°F was selected, Earlier work (3) had shown this to be
a reasonable value, and calculations summarized in Table 6.2 confirmed its
optimal quallty for the MSCR, Perturbations of the affected capital costs
were calculated in Table 6. 2, and it was concluded that the optimum temper-

ature is very near 1100°F (see also Sec, 3.1.12).

6.2.3 Velocitz

Erosion does not appear to be a problem in salt-INOR systems, nor does
there appear to be any depeadence of the corrosion rate on velocity.
Rather, the velocity appears to be limited by considerations of pumping
power and stresses inducedoby'pressure gradients. Pressure drop across the
heat exchangers is limited by the rapid increase in cost of INOR shells
with increa51ng wall thlckness° Likewise, maximum allowable pressure drop

across the reactor core is determined by limitations on strength and thick-

- ness of the reactor vessel and internal support members . Velocities, pres-

sures, and wall th1cknesses at varlous points in the fuel 01rcu1t of the

| reference de81gn are llsted in Table 6, 3.

“The pumplng power requlred per heat exchanger loop was. calculated to

’ berabout 1500 horsepower, with a margln of 500 horsepower for pump and
 f'motor inefflciencles and unforeseen losses, This pumping power requirement
';rresults in a pumping cost (with electric power at 4 mllls/kwhr) of

0,004 mllls/kwhre. | | " |

6.,2.4 Fuel Volume

Contrxbutlons to the volume of the fuel system are listed in Table 4, l
for the reference design. The volume of fuel in the external system de-
pends on the oower level and various limitations such as those on salt
temperature, pbessure, velocity, thermal stress in and minimum thickness of
heat exchanger tubing, etc, The reference system was designed with consid-
erable conservatism. The fuelrvolume could be reduced appreciably with an
increese in specific power; pumpxng power costs and capital 1nvestment in
pumps would increéSe., ‘Cost of heat exchangers might also increase. The

deszgn of the system should be optlmlzed Wlth respect to the sum of all the

- costs affected but this lay outsxde the scope of the present study.

The power dens;ty in the external portion of the fuel system of the

wjreference des1gn is approxlmately 2.8 th/ft . This is very much smaller
ithan the 7.6 th/ft used in a prlor study of a molten salt breeder (3)

which was based on a study by Splewak and Parsly (99), who est1mated a
sgec1f1c power of 4,9 th/ft for a first generation plent and 7.6 th/ft

for subsequent plants,

 
 

134

Since only about one fourth of theltotal is contributed by the fuel
in the active core, the total fuel volume is not very sensitive to changes
in fuel volume.fraction in the core. The total volume is rather"more'sen-
sitive to changes in core ‘diameter. The volume of nettron-active fuel in-
creases as the cube of the core dlameter (helght equal to dlameter) while
volume in the radial annulus and in top and bottom plenums increases as
the square. About 40% of the total volume is affected,

In a fully optimized system, the fuel volume might plausibly be |
2000 fta, and perhaps be as low as 1800 ft3, provxded some of the holdup in

end-plenums, etc. can be eliminated.

6.3  Analysis of Chemical System

The composition of the fuel stream as a function of its chemical in-
teraction with the reactor environment and with the processing plant is
considered. ~Behavior of xenon-135 is important and is discussed. in detail
in Section 6.8. Stagnation of fuel in crevices between moderator elements
may be important; however, it does not seem.possible at this time to eval-
uate the effect except to say that parasitic captures of neutrons in
fission products immobilized in such places will take place° This uncer-
tainty was lumped with thaf'aesooiated with eorrosion'products as discussed
below. | -

So far as the composition of the fuel stream is concerned, the chem-

ical effects of the two proposed processxng methods (Thorex vs fluoride

volat;llty) are the same. The recycled uranium is radioactive and must be

handled at least semi-remotely whether the thorium is recycled or not°
Both methods result in recycle feed containlng only negligible amounts of
nuclear poisons (other than isotopes of uranium) and both return 233pa
removed from the reactor as 233U with 1osses that depend only on the hold-

ing time prior to chemical treatment.

6.3.1 Thorium-232

~

Thorium may be recycled if Thorex processing is used; however, accord-

ing to the Guide, the capacity of a multi-purpose processing plant would be

 

 
 

 

 

w

)

[

 

135

reduced by 40% (52)., (One could design the plant to handle the thorium
without loss of capacity, however, and recover the thorium at no extra
cost.) It turns out that this reduction in capacity almost exactly offsets
the value of the thorium saved. With the fluoride volatility processing,
thorium is not recovered except by means of an additional step presently

not available,

6.3.2 Protactinium-233

With mean residence times of the order of 1000 days, protactinium for

‘the most part decays while still in the circulating fuel system. However,

the process stream carries 60-80 grams per day out of the reactor system.
In the proposed reference design processing scheme (Section 5.2), the pro-

cessing stream is accumulated for 120 days and then held as a batch for an

~ additional 30 days, giving a total hold-up time of 150 days and an average

decay time of 90 days. At the time of processing, 85% of the 233pa in the
mixed batch will have decayed to 233U, so that the maximum loss of 233pa
will be only 9 to 12 grams per day.

6.3.3 Uranium-233

The loss per pass through the processing plant was assumed to be 0.3%.
In the reference designrreactof,'the'product_stream from the process
plant was recycled to the reactor; however, the economics of sale of the

product stream was also,examineﬁ.rr

6.3.4 Uranlum-234

" Natural uranium is ‘99, 27 welght per cent 238U 0,72 per cent 235U and

70'0055 per cent 234y, - If there were no enrichment ln 234y relatlve to

2350 a diffusion plant product contalnlng 95 wezght per cent 235y would _

also contain 0, 726 per cent 234y with the balance being 238y, 1In order to

- allow for some enrichment, the composxtlon of the feed was taken to be 95

per cent 235y 1.per cent 23“0 and 4 per cent 238y, s with 233y, the

7 process;ng ‘losses were 0.3 per cent/pass°

Initially the reactor contains little 23%U, The apﬁroach to equilib-

rium is slow, and, as seen in Appendix H, the average concentration over

 

 
 

. 136

a period of thirty years is only 65 per cent of the equilibrium concentra-
tion, The average value, rather than the equilibrium value, was therefore

used in the nuclear calculations,
6.3.5 Uranium=235
An enrichment of 95% was selected for the make-up. Losses in process-
ing were assumed to be 0.3% per pass.
6.3.6 Uranium=236 “

The concentration of this isotope also approaches equilibrium slowly
with respect to a fuel lifetime of 30 years. A concentration averaged over

the 30-year life was used. Losses in processing were assumed to be 0.3%,

6,3.7 Neptunium-237
This was assumed to be removed completely in the processing plant.
6.3.8 Uranium-=238

For reasons given above, the fuel make-up stream was assumed to con-
tain 4% 238y by weight., Losses in the process plant were assumed to be
0.3%., The 30-year average concentration was used in the nuclear calcula-

tions instead of the equilibrium concentration.
6.3.9 Neptuniuﬁ¥239'and Plutonium Isotopes

Only small amounts of these will be formed, and they are lost in the.

waste. Accordingly, their formation in the fuel stream was ignored and no

breeding credit was taken for absorptions in 238y,

6.3.10 ‘Salt

- The fuel carrier in the reference design consisted of 68 mole per cent

LiF, 23 per cent BeF,, and 9 per gent_ThPu. Lithium in the make-up salt
was 99,995% ‘Li. Captures in ’Li, Be, and F were lumped under an equiva-
lent isotope "Carrier-1." The mean reactor concentration of 6Li and
neutron captures therein were computed separately. Lithium and beryllium

in the process stream are lost to the waste, and no value was assigned to

 
*)

137

the waste. The make-up rate was made equal to the discard rate for ’Li and

Be; the ®Li feed rate was proportioned to the 7Li make-up rate.

6,3.11 Xenon-135 and Related Isotopes

In the reference design reactor, it was assumed the graphite has a

-5

diffusion coefficient no greater than 107° cm?/sec (D = 10 cm2/sec for

- MSRE graphite), a porosity no greater than 0.01, and that 10 per cent of

the fuel stream is recirculated to the dome of the expansion chamber and

the pump bowls, Here Xe is desorbed and swept away in a stream of helium

~gas with anréfficiency of 100 per cent per pass. With these assumptions,

the loss in breeding ratio due to absorptions in 135Ke is 0,017 as shown
in Appendix G, where the losses corresponding to other assumptions are also

given,

6.3.12 Noble Metal Fission Products

It was assumed that this group of isotopes, comprising Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd,
and In, "plate out" on INOR surfaces in the fuel circuit with an efficiency

of 1.0 per cent per pass.

£.3.13 Other Fission Products

These are removed 100 per cent in the Fluoride Volatility process, and -
only negligible amounts will be present in the recycle stream from a Thorex

Data are meager from whlch the concentratlon of corrosion products in
the .circulating fuel stream could be estimated. In an 1n-pile loop oper-
ated for 15,000 hours, the concentratlons,of_iron,.nickel, aﬁd chromium

éppearedtogflupfuatg_aboutequilibrium values (84, p. 79), On the basis

of these data one might expect the fuel to contain 50 ppm of nickel,

500 ppm of chromiﬁh,-and'about'250 ppm of iron, In the reference design

,reactor,, these concentratlons would result in a poison fractzon (loss in

breedlng ratio) of 0,006 units, A poison fraction of 0,008 units was arbi-

trarily assigned to corrosion products in the calculations, making some

allowance for fission products immobilized in cracks and crevices in the

moderator, etc,

6.4 "Puel Cycle Optimization

The designer has little control over some of the independent variables
that affect the fuel cycle cost., For instance, the maximum allowable fuel
temperature is fixed by necessity of limiting corrosion rates, For some
variables the fuel cost‘may decrease monotonically as the variable tends
toward an extreme value, but other costs may increase, For example,'deu
creasipng the external volume of fuel salt decreases inventory charges but
" increases pumping costs, A plausible and conservative external volume was
selected for the reference design optimization; however,.efféct.on,fuel
cycle cost of decreasing the external volume is easily estimated. .

After the values of such fixed or limiting variables were established,
there remained several which required optimization simultaneously with re-
spect to the fuel costs. These variables were désignated the "key"
variables, ] |

The key independent variables were found to be the diameter (D) of the
core, the volume fraction (F) of fuel in the core, the concentration (M) of
thorium in the fuel salt, and the processing rate (R). The second and
third combine to fix an important subsidiafy variable, the C/Th atom ratio
(an indication of the degree of moderation of the system). Fixing all four
and then satisfying the criticality equation together with the equilibrium
isbtope equation results in fixing the Th/U ratio, breeding ratio, fuel
cost, etc. | | -

Exploratory calculations showed that the fuel cycle coét is a rather
sensitive function of the C/Th ratio, but is insensitive to the diameter
of the core in the range from 15 to 20 feet. Relative breeding ratios and
fuel cycle costs for a series of calculations are shown in Table 6.4,

On the basis of these results, the 20-foot core'having a fuel volume
- fraction of 10 per cent and using a fuel salt containing 9 mole per cent

ThFu was selected'fbr further study. The optimum processing rate for this

“Reference Design Case

The MSCR is capable of producing ppwer at a fuel cycle cost, including
salt charges, of 0.7 mills/kwhre at a conversion ratio of 0.9,

The most important uncertainties in this calculation arise in connec-
tion with (a) the behavior of xenon in the core, (b) costs estimated for

assigned to the materials_and“(d) costsof-packaging the spent fuel for
shipment. The influence of xenon behavior is examined in Sec. 6.6, and the
-costiassuhptions in Sec, 6.7, If the losses to xenon assumed for the
reference design case are attainable (and it should be pdssible to achieve
‘the assumed'performance by improﬁing'the graphite and the sparging process),
“then all the uncertalnty resides 1n the proce551ng cost, Since processing
-costs are only about 0,08 mmlls/kwhre (Table 6. 10) even a large error would

6.5.,2 Neutron'Eceheh§ »

From Table 6,7, it is seen that flSSlonS in 232Th contribute very
little to neutron productlon. The fast fission cross sections of thorium
are appreciably less than those of 238y, moreover, the fast flux in the
MSCR is not particularly high (Table 6.6), Also, the thorium is rather
dilute compared to concentrations customarily proposed for blankets.

The nuclear loss resulting from absorptions .in Pa is appreciable but
not serious. It could be reduced by reducing further the volume fraction
of fuel in the core, but this is already about as low (0.1) as seems tech-
nically feasible; a further decrease would probably add more to the fuel
cost in terms of increased inventory charges (since concentration of tho-
rium and uranium in the fuel stream would increase, while the external
volume would remain the same) than would be saved in terms of fuel replace-
ment costs. Increasing the external volume in order to dilute the Pa would
not be economical for the same reason. |

The nuclear loss to Pa could be reduced by removing the Pa rapidly
from the circulating stream and holding it until it decays to 233y, In
order to be effectlve, such a process would have to treat the entire fuel
stream for Pa removal in a period not greater than ten days (mean life of
Pa is about 40 days). Thus an extremely simple and efficient process is
required, as for example, the passage of the fuel stream through beds where
Pa is selectively absorbed and retained until 233y is formed, which then
desorbs in the preaence of large amounts of uranium in solution. No such
process is presently known, although some work has been reported (19 p. 117,
74) on the prec1p1tatlon of protactlnlum oxide from molten salt solutions

the processing cycle (0.3% per pass). Since 23ﬁlis inferior with respect
to 233y as a nuclear fuel, it is advantageous to keep the concentration of
2347 as low as possible. However, the designer has little control over
this, inasmuch as the only menas of removing it is to sell spent fuel to
the AECQ and this, as shown in Sec. 6.8.3, is not advantageous.,

The concentration of 236U used was also averaged over a period of
thirty years, starting with a clean reactor containing no 236y, 1In this
case, the only source is capture of neutrons in 235y; the sinks are trans-
mutation to 237U (which decays promptly to 237Np) and losses (0,3% per
pass) in the processing cycle. The only effective ‘control the designer has
6ver?2360 is by varying the conversion ratio thus varying the amount of
235y fed to the system, and by sale of spent fuel,

It is assumed that 237Np was removed 100 per cent per pass through the
processing cycle. Parasitic captures are appreciable (0,007% units on the
conversion ratio); however, special processing for this reason does not
appear to be worthwhile, although it might be for other reasons.

Parasitic captures in carrier salt resulted in a conversion loss of
0.039 units. Of this, captures in ®Li contributed 0,014 units, The grade
of salt used (99,995% 'Li) appears to be about the best available at
attractive pfices. On the other hand, use of inferior grades would not
result in lower fuel costs. .

The best way to control losses to ®Li is to recycle carrier salt from
processing'instead of discarding it as was assumed in the reference design.
The p0851b111t1es are examlned in Sec. 6.8, where it is shown that about

0.01 units mlght plaus;bly be saved on the conversion ratio, and about

0,08 mills in replacement costs,

at the periphery of the core as a result of tolerance allowance for dif-

The estimate of the loss of neutrons to kenon (0.017 units on C.R,)
was based on an assumed diffusion coefficient of 107° em?/sec., a porosity
accessible to gas of 1.0 per cent, and a sparging rate of 10 per cent
(16tft3/sec) of the circulating fuel stream with 100 per cent removal of
¥enon per pass (Sec. 6.8.2). The prospects are good for the development of
~grades of graphite that would reduce the lossesito xenon in the MSCR to no
more than 0,005 units on the conversion ratio. |

Captures in samarium (1*9Sm and 151Sm) result in a loss of 0,013 units
in conversion ratio. This loss is independént of the processing rate ex-
cept at very short cycle times of the order of days. 'Thus,_tﬁére_is'not
much prospect of reducing this loss except by the application of some
simple, rapid process similar to that suggested for 233p3 above.

Captures in other fission products can be controlled by varying the
processing rate. The savings from greater fuel conversion must be balanced
against increased.processing'coSt. For the particular price structure and
nuclear properties assumed, the optimum rate of processing is 1,7 ft3/day
(53 kg of Th/day). The corresponding loss in conversion ratio due to
captures in other fission products is 0,074 units. In this calculation,
it was assumed that xenon is sparged as described above, noble metals are
reduced by chromium in metal structures to the zero valence state and
"plated out," énd all other fission products are removed by passage through
the processing cycle which, at the costs estimated in Sec. 5.1, optimized . -
at a cycle time of ~1500 days. | |

If the procéssing cost schedule (Sec, 3,2 and 5.1) were to change in
the direction of lower costs, the optimum processing rate would increase,
and the fission ﬁroduct.captures could be decreased. Although improve-
ments and economies in the Fluoride Volatility process are to be expected,
the remote opefations ahd maintenance costs of this process are likely to
remain high; therefore the process eventually used should be as simple as
possible, The solution may lie in the direction of distillation or frac-
tional crystallization (80, p. 80), or perhaps extraction with liquid —

metals,

 

 
 

 

 

 

L)L

147

The estimated loss in conversion ratio to corrosion products was 0,006
units; a loss of 0,008 units was allowed in the calculations (Sec. 6.3).
Since the concentration of corrosion products (Fe, Ni, and Cr) in the melt
appears to reach an equilibrium in times that are short compared to the
processing cycle time, it seems unlikely that the processing will have much
influence on the cohcentratibns of corrosion products, and the associated

loss of neutrons seems unavoidable,

6.5.3 Inventories and ProcessingﬁRates

It may be inferred from Table 6.8, Column 1, that the specific power
of the MSCR is 0,35 Mwe/kg fissile, which is comparable with many of the
advanced systems currently being put forward. The exposure (about 40,000
Mwdt/tonne of thorium) is of the same order as that of "competitive" |

reactors.

The processing rates given .in Table 6.9 are the amounts vemoved
daily from the circulating fuel stream. These daily increments are accu-
mulated for 116 days to form a pfocessing batch. The average fission pro-
duct activity in the material as processed corresponds to an effectlve
holdlng time of about 90 days (based on the Way-Wigner correlation as re-
ported in reference 55, p. 81). Thus, a process batch contains 6500 kg of
thoriumj this is processed at the rate of 1000 kg/day for uranium recovery,

taking &7 days to process and two days for "turn-around."

The fuel cycle cost for the reference design reactor, which is ngér
optimum on the bases chosen, comes to 0,68 mills/kwhre. A breakdown is
given in Table 6,10, A ‘

Inventory of fissile materials costs about 1/4 mills/kwhre, when
optimized with respect to the processing rate. It could possibly be re—,'-
duced at a given processing rate by improving the graphite to reduce xenon
‘poisoning and by reducing the volume of fuel in the external heat transfer

circuit at the expense of greater pumping power costs,

6.6 Parameter Studies

In this section, the effect on the fuel cycle cost of various assump-
tions concerning the processing cost, and of several modes of processing

are considered.

6.6.1 Processing Cost as 'Parameter

The fuel cycle cost reported in Sec. 6.7 (Table 6.10) was based on the

assumed use of a central Fluoride Volatiiity facility requiring approxi-
mately $20 million in capital investment and having an annual operating ex-
pense of $2 million (Table 5.7). In Sec. 5.4, this estimate was compared
with other current estimates for similar plants and for Thorex'plants-of
comparable capacity,’ In this section, the processing plant capital invest-
ment and the operating cost are considered as'parameters, without regard to
the kind of plant., The effect on the fuel cycle cost of the MSCR at
various processing rates of varying processing costs for a plant having a
nominal capacity of 1000 kg Th/day (30 ft3/day of reference design salt) |
was calculated, 1In éll cases, the output of the reactor was accumulated
until a processing batch of‘abbﬁt 6000 kg of Th was collecfed; this-Was .
then shipped to the processing plant and processed at a rate of 1000 kg
Th/day. The turn-around time was assumed to be 2 days. |

The results of the calculation are presented in Fig. 6.2. The curves
corresponding to daily charges of $20,000 to $60,000. It is.séen that; in
the conversion ratio range from 0.8 to 0.9, the fuel cycle cost is not very
sensitive to the processing cost; in the reference design, the fuel cycle
cost does not exceed 0,85 mills/kwhre at a daily charge of $40 thousand,
and only slightly exceeds 1.0 mills/kwhre for a charge of $60 thousand. At
$u0 thousand,.the minimum fuel'cycle cosf_is less than 0.8 mills/kwhre at a
conversion ratio of about-o.es; and the cost remains below 1,0 mills/kwhre

for conversion ratios up to about 0,92,

It was concluded that, on any reasonable cost basis, the optimum fuel
cycle cost for the MSCR will not exceed 0.8 mills/kwhre, and that conver-
sion ratios up to 0,92 can be obtained at fuel cycle costs not exceeding
1,0 mills/kwhre,

6.6.2 Effect of Xenon Removal

The solubility of xenon in LiF-BeF2 is very low (107); in the refer-
ence design reactor the equilibrium pressure is about 0,06 atmospheres.
Xenon thus tends to leave the salt at any phase boundary. It can be re-
moved rapidly by spraying a portion of the circulating stream into a space
filled with helium or by subsurface sparging. It may form microbubbles , -
clinging to the surface of the graphite moderator, and it will tend to
diffuse into pores in the graphite; including pores inaccessible to the .
salt, Xenon is also removed from the system by decay to 135¢s and by
reaction with neutrons to form l35Xe, which is stable and has a low neutron
capture cross section. ‘
Xenon poisoning in the MSCR was calculated by the method of Watéon and
Evans (107), as shown in Appendix G, The important physical properties are
the porosity, e, of the graphite (fraction of graphite volume accessible to
xenon) and the diffusivity of xenon, D (cm?/sec). The key variables are
the diameter of the graphite logs, the fuel circulation rate, and the
sparging fraction, r, (fraction of circulating stream sparged or sprayed to
removed xenon)., In the reference deSLgn, the logs are six inches in dlam-
eter, and the circulation rate is 160 ftalsecoll_
In the reference design reactor, a gas-accessxble porosity of 0,01 and
a diffusion coefflclent of 10~ &

would result in a tolerable_xenon poison fraction of 0.017 neutrons per

with a sparg;ng_fractlon of 0,1 (16 ft?/sec), :

neutron absorbed by fissile atoms. These physical property values are an
order of magnitude smaller than those of currently available graphite where
e=0,1and D= 10"

able in small pieces of graphite (107) and the control of xenon poisoning

s however, the assumed values are both presently attain-

in the MSCR appears to lie within the reach of developing technology. -
The conversion ratio increases and the fuel cycle cost decreases with —~

decreasing xenon poisoning. Table 6.1l compares the calculated results for &/

- 6. 6 3 Effect of Product Sale Wlthout Recycle

At least two beneflts accrue from: the sale of recovered f1551le iso-

,.topes (as- UFg) to the AEC: (a) Make-up fuel (235U) would then be non-
'radioactive and could be compounded with fresh salt in a dxrectly main-
_tained and operated facllity, (b) the reactor would tend to be purged of

236y, The second benefxt is really illusory, inasmuch as ‘the 236U produced

"'Wlll eventually capture a neutron 1n some reactor somewhere, and therefore

reduces ‘the value of the recovered 1sotopes by an approprlate amount.
On the other hand, a penalty is incurred in that 2330 a superior Ffuel
in thermal reactors, is also lost from the system. As seen in Table.6,12,

the penalties outweigh the advantages considerably.

6,7 Alternative Design and Cost Bases

6.7.1 Thorex Processing Cost Estimates

The preferred method of processing MSCR fuel is by fluorination
(Sec, 5.2), mainly because the processing-can‘conveniently be integrated
with the reactor and thus achieve very low fuel cycle costs. However, for
one reason or another, it may be desirable to process the spent fuel from
the first MSCR installations in a central Thorek facility. Aécqrdingly,
the facility specified in the Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52,
104) was modified appropriately as described in Sec. 5.3 to handle MSCR
fuel, An allowance of $500,000 additional capital cost for the head-end
treatment was made. Costs were calculated on the bases given in the Guide.
The turn-around time was eight days and the shipping charge was $17/kg for
round trip. The assumed loss of fissile material was 1.3 per cent/péss.

The fuel cycle costs for the reference design reactor'(Tabies 6.6
through 6.10) were recomputed using a cost schedule estimated from the
Guide (52), as shown in Table 6.13, where they are compared to correspond-

ing results for central Floride Volatility processing (Sec. 5.2).

Thus, even though processed through the AEC reference plant, the costs
of which appear to be conservatlvely high, the fuel cycle cost for the ref-

erence design MSCR will not exceed 0,75 mills/kwh.,
6.7.2 'Reactor-Inteégrated Fluoride Volatility Processing
Several advantages can be realized by integrating the processing with
reactor operations. The principal saving results from sharing reactor
shielding and remote maintenance equipment. Savings in laboratory facil-

A 30 ft /day central fluorzde volatlllty plant requlres a capltal out-
'lay of about $25 million and would need ‘to service flfteen to twenty
1000 Mwe MSCR's in order to achieve the unit processing costs estlmatedrin

6.7.3 Reactor-Integrated'Precipitafion'Process

At a processing‘rafe of 1.7 ftalday, the concentration of rare earth
fluorides in the fuel salt will be approximately 0.5 mole per cent, which
is perhaps slightly in excess of the solubility limit at the minimum fuel
temperature of 1100°F. This suggests that it may be possible to remove

rare earths fission products from the MSCR fuel stream by fractional crys-

tallization — an e#tremélywattractive possibility, for such a process could
conveniently be carried out in the reactor cell and closely integrated with

the reactor system. The steps involved are exceedingly simple, involving

only the transfer of liquids and heat, and is therefore'inherently safe and'

economical, , , ,

The fission product neutron poisoning estimated for thé referénce de~
sign can be approximately matched by charging every day five cubic feet of
fuel salt containing 0.5 mole per cent rare earth thorides to a crystal-
lizer, The salt is cooled to 900°F, which is 13°F above the temperature at
which solid solutions containing Th or U separate. At this'temperature,
the solubility of the rare earth fluqrides is 0,2 mole per cent or less,
judging from fhe data of Ward et al., (108, 106). Thus about 60 per cent
of the rare earths will precipitate or "freeze" on the walls of the crys-
tallizer. The total mass of the solids will be only 6-8 kg, After the
fuel salt is returned to the reactor system, the fission products are dis-
solved in flush salt \

The process deseribed should effectively remove rare earths from the
fuel salt, It will not remove alkali metals, alkaline earfhs, and mis- -

cellaneous other metals. These will accumulate in the fuel, but their in-

. growth can be partially compensated by operating the freeze-process at a

slightly more rapid rate and maintaining the rare earth concentration at
say 0.45 mole per cent or by discarding barren fuel-salt in a 1500 day
cycle, | |

6.8 Evolution of a Self-Sustaining MSCR

Although the MSCR concept may not have the capability of evolving into

a breeder reactor (see Sec. 7.1) having a doubling time less than 25 years,

 
 

 

 

»

v

»

157

‘the possibility exists, however, that it could; without increase in power

costs, achieve a net conversion ratio slightly greater than unity, and
thus become self-sustaining and independent of outside supplies of fissile
isotopes. Conditions under which this might be achieved are listed and

discussed below,

6.8.1 Reduction of Leakage

With the advent of separated ?2Mo, it becomes feasible to surround the
core of the MSCR with a thin blanket of high-density thorium salt (25% ThF,
75% LiF). This salt, having a liquidus temperature below 1100°F, could be
circulated slowly through 6-inch diameter molybdenum tubes replacing the
outer two layers of grephite'moderator legs, and replacing 1l-ft end sec-
tions of the central logs. The isotope I32Mo is a magic nuclide, having a
2200 m/s cross section of 6 millibarns. The epithermal cross section is
currently being measured athRNL, and preliminary results indicate that the
resonance integral is also:very small, Thus, structural molybdenum should
capture only a negiigible_fraction'of neutrons.

It would be necessary:to:remove the bred 233y papidly from the fertile
stream for two reasons:  (a) fissions in the fertile stream would tend to
increase the leakage, (b) fission products in the fertile stream would
capture neutrons, If fhe fertile stream were processed rapidly by fluori-
nation, the concentration of 233U could be kept very low, fissions would be
suppressed, the inventory charge for 233U would be largely avoided, . The
fertile stream carrier'salt could be recycled without furteer treatment.
The rapidity of the preCeSSing; however; implies the use of an on-site,
reactor-lntegrated faczllty such as that described in ‘Sec. 6.9,2,

By this means perhaps half the leakage neutrons could be saved, addlng

~_about 0.025 units to the converSLOn ratio.

#

6. 8 2 Reduction of Xenon Captures _r

" In the reference desxgn, graphlte propertles an order of magnltude

- better than those characterlstlc of current graphites were assumed, result-

ing in a loss ih conversion ratio due to captures'in 13_5Xe'absorbed in the
graphite of only 0.017 units. By further improvements (e.g., by spraying a

thin coating of 92M6 on the moderator logs and carburizing to prevent xenon

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

158 —

from penetrating the moderator) perhaps another 0,01 units on the con-
version ratio could be saved.,

6.8.3 Reduction of Fission Product Poisoning

Somewhat over 0,085 units weré lost from the conversion ratio as a
result of captures in fission products in the reference design (Table 6.7).
The processing cost in a -central Fluoride Volatility facility w&s about
0.08 mills/kwhr., If an on-site, reactor-integrated Fluoride Volatility and
- HF-Solution facility were used (Sec. 2;2.lu),_fhe rate of removal of rare
earths could be increased perhaps by a factor of 10. Solubles (Cs, Ba,
etc.) could be purged by discarding salt in a 1500 day cycle, as in the ' .
reference design. If this ﬁererdone, the loss of conversion ratio to
fission products could be reduced to about 0,010 units, -

6.8.4 Imprdvement'of‘Mean'Eta'and'Reduction of 236y captures

Other than by varying the C/Th ratio, the designer has no direct con-
trol over these., Nevertheless, the above improvements in neutron economy
have an effect on the conversion ratio thét is greater than fheir cumulaf'
tive sum, for 233y is superior to 235U in respect to neutron production,
and moreover yields a fertile isotope (23"0) upon capture of a neutron,

An increase in relative concentration of 233U by any means increases the
number of neutrons available for breeding, and reduction of 235U feed rate
results in a decrease in 236U concentration. o _

The above listed improvements should result in an increase in eta of - |
0.01 units and a reduction of captures in 236y b§0,01 units, at least.’

6.8.5 ’Ultimate'Bréé&ixll:g:"é;{;ﬁé;itéf'MSCR

The conversion ratio in the reference design is about 0,90, With the
improvements listed above, conversions slightly in excess of 1.0 may be .
achieved, as shown in Table 6.1k, S R

Thus, the MSCR may be capable of evolving stepwise into an economical,
self-sustaining breeder reaétor with fuel cycle costs probably in the range
of 0,7 - 1,0 mills/kwhre, .' - o~

It should be emphasized that the limiting conversion ratio estimated A

for the MSCR does not apply to molten salt breeder reactors., It has been o .

shown (3) that two-region, twé-fluid, thermal reactors optimized with
respect to breeding are capable'bf achieving doubling times of 25 years or
less, (See also Sec. 1.7.) In addition, the advent.of structural 92Mo
makes pOSSlble, in prmnc1ple _the design of two—reglon, two~fluid, fast
molten-salt reactors which may have doubling times as short as ten years,
which will not need to use separated 6Li in the ‘carrier salt, and which

therefore may be processed econommcally by ‘fluorination only.

7.4 MSCR Operating and ‘Maintenance Cost Estimate

The MSCR is a szngle reactor, single turbzne plant and, although its
power generatlon capacity is hlgh its manpower requirements are relatively
low because of the single unit operation. Plant personnel totals 101 with
a cost of $872,000 per year, Materials cost $220,000, Maintenance, in-
cluding provision for periodic equipment overhaﬁl, special services pro-
vided by off-site personnel and qrganizations,‘totals $800,000, With an
allowance of 14 percent for central office expense, the total cost is
$2,154,000 or 0,30 m/kwh. ' “The ‘Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52)
criteria were followed where applicable in determining plant organization.

7.4.,1 Labor and Materials

{

The manpower requirements of the 1000-Mwe MSCR plant are shown in
Table 7.4 for operétions and general supervision. Routine operation of the
Plant may require fewer people, particularly on the technical staff, Re-
view of reactor plant personnel requirements developed by Sargent and Lundy
(94), and Kaiser Engineers (51) for 300 Mwe (net) plants are compabed in
Table 7.4 for single unit systems.

-In practice, the actual distribution of manpower may shift, but the
total labor cost should remain approximately as shown. For example, one
storekeeper may be insufficient, in which case an engineering assistant or
maintenance mechanic helper might be repléced by a stores clerk.

In general, the turbine room operation includes, in addition to the
turbo-generator proper, (a) water supply and disposal systems, e.g., sani-
tary service, treated and circulating water systems, (b) boiler feed
systems which include boiler feed pumps, steam clrculators, and Loeffler
boilers, and (c) the turbine auxiliaries, e_,_go lubrlcating oil systems,
liquid and gas coolant systems, and instrument and compressed air systems,
The reactor operation includes (a) salt charging systems, (b) salt with-
drawal systems, (c¢) salt shipping facilities, (d) liquid and gaseous waste
disposal systems, and (e) pressurized gas supply and treatment systems,
 These facilities are staffed on a semi-automated basis; for fully automated

operatlon, the manpower requirements would be less,

7.4.,2, Operation and Maintenance Cost

The estimate of $2,154,000 shown in Table 7.5 does not take into
account any unforeseen diffiéulties and expenses that may be encountered
in the MSCR, It may well be that requirements for personnel and equipment
for maintaining a radicactive molten salt system are greater than estimated
- possibly by as much as a factor of three. This cannot be accurately
determined until maxntenance procedures have been more clearly defined and
the reactor plant desxgned 1n greater detail than was possible in the
present study.

Based on 1038 Mwe net and a plant factor of 0.8, the contribution to

the power cost is 0,3 mills/kwhre.

8, RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The cost of electric power is commonly resolved into three components:

The fuel cost, the fixed charges, and operation and maintenance expense.

8.1 Fuel Cost

As shown in Sec., 6, the fuel cycle cost in the MSCR rangés from
2 mills/kwhr (electrical) down to 0.7 depending on the conversion ratio
desired and the method and/or cost of processing assumed. For present pur-
poses, the minimum cost associated with the reference design reactor summa-
rized in Table 6.6 was selected as representative. This reactor is "near-
term" and predicated on the scale-up of current technology with the ex-
ception of the modefaton graphite, which was an order of magnitude better
than currently available graphite in respect to porosity'and permeability.
The fuel cycle cost, using Fluoride Volatility processing in a central
plant with discard of carrier salt and contained thorium and recycle of

isotopes of uranium, was reported in Sec. 6.7.1l.

8;2"Fixed‘Char§es

The capital investment for the 1000 Mwe (1038 Mwe net) station was
estimated by Sargent and Lundy, Engineers from information supplied by
ORNL, as reported in Sec. 7, and summarized in Table 7.1l. The investment
comprised $137,56%,000 for depreciating capital items, and 511,311,800 for
non-depreciating items (coolant salt and land). Fuel salt fixed charges
are included in fuel cycle cost.

Working capital was estimated according to the prescription given in
the Guide (52), and is shown in Table 8.2.

2, 25% of annual maintenance and materials: 250,000

Similarly, the nuclear hazard insurance premium was estimated by

prescription at $3u40,000 per year, The fixed charges are collected in

8.3 Operation and Maintenance Expense

 

This expense was estimated in Sec. 7.2 and amounted to $2,154,000 per
year, of which $1,020,000 was for maintenance and materials and the rest
was for labor, supervision, and management. At 1038 Mwe net, the contri-

bution to the power cost is 0.3 mills/kwhr (electrical).

8.4 Cost of Power

The three components of the power cost are assembled in Table 8.4,

Table 8.4, Cost of Power in a 1000 Mwe Molten Salt
Converter Reactor

 

Item _ _ Mills/Kwhr

 

Fuel cycle cost

Fixed charges 3.0
Operation and maintenance | 0.3
Cost of power, mills/Kwhr 4.0

 

In regard to the fuel cycle cost, it was shown in Sec. 6.8 that this
would not exceed 1.0 mill/kwhr even though the fuel were processed in a
1.0 tonne/day Thorex plant costing up to $60 thousand per day to operate,
Sgch a general purpose plant could provide processing of fuel from thorium
reactors having a total power capability of about 20,000 Mwe at an exposure
of 50,000 Mwd/tonne., |

The energy conversion system, accessoéy electrical equipment, and
miscellaneous plant equipment (Items 23, 24, and.25 in Table 7.1) are con-
ventional items, and the estimation of their cost appears to be relatively
unambiguous. Items 21 and 22 are perhaps subject to considerable uncer-
tainty. But their total is only about $57 million, whereas the contingency ST

item is $11 million. However, the possibility exists that Item 21 was

 
 

 

 

L

)

"

171

grossly underestimated, or that the effect of radiation shielding require-
ments on building costs was underestimated. Supposing Item 21 to be

$18 million (factor of 3), and allowing another $5 million for the reactor
plant (10%), the investment comes to $166/kw,»and the fixed charges to

3,5 mills/kwhr, as an upper limit,

Provision for labor in Sec. 7.2 seems adequate, Materials and supplies
accounted for about half the operation and maintenance costs; if this were
doubled, the contribution to the cost of power would be about 0,5 mills/kwhr,

Collecting these probable upper limits on the cost of power in the
MSCR, the sum is 5.0 mills/kwhr.,

8.5 Breeding Potential of the MSCR

The nuclear capability of the reference design MSCR is summarized in
Fig., 8.1. With central Fluoride Volatility processing, the minimum fuel
cycle cost is about 0.7 mill/kwhr and the conversion ratio about 0.9 at a

processing cycle time of 1500 days., Increasing the rate increases the con-

~ version ratio to perhaps as high as 0,93, but the fuel cost rises steeply.

The use of an on-site reactor-integrated (inside the reactor cell)
Fluoride Volatility facility would increase the fuel cost by only 0.1
mill/kwhr in the 1000 Mwe station, |

The use of an on-site reactor-integrated precipitation process for
removing rare earths might reduce the fuel cost below 0.5 mills/kwhr,

By-takihg Advénfége 6f ﬁofential impro&eménts.in'heutrén'economy-(but :
retaining the'eSSentiai features of the MSCR) an upper limit on the con-
version ratio of 1,03 was estiméted; This was interpreted to mean that
the MSCR is'capable pf'evolving'into a self-sustaining reactor requiring
only thorium feed, Outside é&ﬁﬁqe.offissiie isotopes woﬁld,not'be needed.

This limitation does nbtwapply to two-region breeders, which were

rSthn previously to be capable of doubling times as short as 25 years.(l).

8.6 ‘Conclusions

The 1000 Mwe MSCR requires a capital investment of $143/kwhr, The
fixed cherges are 3.0 mills/kwhr, the fuel cost is 0.7 mills/kwhr, the
maintenance and operation expense of 0,3 mills/kwhr, and the net power cost
is 4,0 mills/kwhr.

Substitution of sodium for LiF-BeF, as the intermediate coolant and
replacement of the Loeffler boiler-superheater complex with a more con-
ventional sodium-heated boiler would reduce the capital investment to about
$125/kwhr. Development of alternative methods of processing (e.g., preci-
pitation of rare earth fluorides) provides potential for reducing fuel
cycle cost., An examination of the neutron economy indicates that the MSCR
should be capable of e#olving_into a self-sustaining breeder reactor

(BR *1,0) not dependent on outside sources of fissile isotopes.

8.7 Recommendations

The comprehensive program of research and development for molten salt
reactors in ppogress at ORNL is concerned at present with the construction
and operation of the MSRE, This MSCR evaluation has disclosed certain
additional areas of study, research, and development important to the
realization of the nuclear and ‘economic potential of molten salt reactors.
These arees are liéted_be;oﬁ,,together with specific examples in each area.

8,7.1 Title 1 Deszgn Study of MSCR

Thls should be performed for two plant capacltzes (100 and 1000 Mwe)

in order to detect unrecognlzed development problems and to verlfy the

economlc predlctions made in thls report. The studyrpreferably should be

conducted by an organlzat;on out31derthe Laboratory, but'With'Close liason

and cooperation in special studies (e.g., nuclear design, reactor-integrated

chemical'processiné)gf'A sfﬁdyeof_lob'uwe installation is desirable to
bridge the gap between the MSRE (10 Mwt) and a full-scale prototype.

 
 

174

8.7.2 Conceptual Design Studies of ‘Advanced Breeder Reactors

Prior studies have established the'nuclear‘potential of a thermal
molten salt-thorium breeder, However, this concept should be re-examined
and developed in greater detail in the light of the technology accumulated
in recent years. In additioﬁ, the potential of fast molten-salt breeders,
including those breeding plutonium, or possibly both plutonium and 2330,
should be evaluated. A number of concepts have been proposed, and it is
not clear,'at present, which of these offers the greatest ultimate poten-

tial coupled with the least difficulty-of development.,

8.7.3 Fundamental Studies of Alternative Chemical Processes

While the fluoride volatilify process is suitable fdr the recovery of
isotopes of uranium from short-cooled fuel, its use alone does entail the
discard of the carrier salt to rid the System fission products. This fact
limits the processing rate and conversion ratio in thermal reactors using
valuable isotopes of lithium and beryllium, although fast reactors using
fluorides of sodium and potassium, etc., are not so limited. For the
thermal reactors at least, an alternative process is needed in which sepa-
ration of valuable components (thorium, uranium, lithium, beryllium) from
fission product isotopes is effected by transfer between fluid phases,
e.g., by extraction of molten salt fuel with a liquid metal, Driving
forces for the transfer can be provided by the use of active metals and
easily reduced fluorides or perhaps by the application of electric

potentials,
8.7.4 Engineering'Laboratony'Study‘of'Precipitétion Processing

This process, which has great potential for reducing the fuel cycle
cost in the MSCR and which, by necessity, must be integrated with the
operation of the reactor and placed within the reactor cell, could make
‘the introduction of MSCR power reactor plants independent of the availa-
bility of central processing facilities for molten salts. This is an
enormous advantage for the initial installatioms, particularly if these

are widely scattered in remote locations. Also, the competitive position

of the smaller installations (100 Mwe) would be improved.

8.7.5 Pilot Plant Study of HF Dissolution Process

This process, though not essential to the realization of the economic
potential of the MSCR:would, if developed, make possible the evolution of
the MSCR into a self-sustaining system, and would constitute a large Step
in the development of two-region, two-fluid breeders.

EFFECTIVE THORIUM RESONANCE INTEGRAIS -

J. W. Miller#*
Introduction

The "effective"” resonance integral to lethargy um of a particular

isotope in a mixture of isotopes is defined by the equation

L .
I (eff) =f - ("ao')eff du -
O s

The value of (oao)eff is a complex function of a number of variables.
A most important item is the scattering power of the medium, measured by
op, macroscopic scattering cross section per thorium atom,
o, = ﬁ'Nko;/Nth .

The greater the scattering power, the greater the probability tha£ a
neutron will be slowed through a resonance without absorption. The thermal
motion of absorber nuclei, on the other hand, increases the probability of
absorption due to Doppler broadening of the resonances. This effect is
small at 20°C, the standard temperature for reporting measured values, but
increases at higher temperatures. Dresner has developed a method for com-
puting the temperature effect for resolved resonances. >

Group averaged cross sections for thorium are related to the effectiVe
resonance integral and were calculated by means of the equation

ui +-Aui
i T M (000 )epr 0¥

where i is the group number.

By assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution for the moderating
medium and the Breit-Wigner formula for a single resonance, Dresner? has
arrived at the following equation for the resonance integral, Ieff,for a

single absorption resonance:

Other terms are defined in the nomenclature.

The function J(£,k) is tabulated in ref. 1. The tabulated results
have been plotted as the family of cuives in Fig. B.l.

The reduced mass of the neutron p is equal to neutron mass (~1.0)
multiplied by M/(M+l), where M is the mass of the absorbing atoms. Since
the mass of thorium is 232, (o was taken as unity for these calculations.

Table B 1 llsts the resonance parameters: for—each ‘of -the 13 resolved
thorium resonances (2). These parameters were used in the equatlon for
I of f for computlng the resonance 1ntegral for each resonance. (Slnce these
calculatlons were performed additional thorium resonances have been re-
solved, and 1mproved"parameter values for_prev1ously resolved resonances.
have been obtained. The effect of these new values has not been evaluatéd)
The total resonance integral for each energy group is then obtained by ad-

ding together the separate integrals for each resonance. Table B.l also

Results

The MERC-1 program used in the MSCR study is a 34-group diffusion-
theory code. The group structure is such that the resolved resonances of
thorium fall into five groups: 11, 12, 15, 16, and 22. The group-averaged
absorption cross section for_eagh of these five groups as a function of cp
at 649°C is plotted in Fig. B-2. The total resolved resonance integral is
plotted ih Fig. B-3 for thiee,reactor temperatures.

' ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF ETA OF 233y#

C. W. Nestor

Summarx

A parameﬁer of great interest in nuclear calculations of a thorium
reactor is 1, the number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed. Ex-
perimental information on the energy dependence of 7 in the range of O
to 10 ev as measured at the MIR was used to calculate group averaged fis-
sion cross sections, using absorption cross sections calculated from the
recent total cross section data'’? and the scattering cross section as
calculated by Vogt.! The  values used in preparation of the cross sec-
tions was normalized to a 2200 m/sec value of 2.29.3

In the energy range of O to 0.8 ev, n was assumed to be constant at
2.29. 1In the range of 0.8 ev to 10 ev, as mentioned, group averaged

values of'VEf =‘ﬁ3a were calculated by numerical evaluation of the inte-

where Au denotes the-lethargy width of the group.

In the range of 10 ev to 30 ev n was estlmated to be 2. 17, the data

i of Gaerttner and Yeater® indicate an average 7 in this range of about

0.95 times the 2200 m/sec value.

From 30 ev to 30 kev, 7 was assumed to be 2.25; this is the value
- reported by Spivak® et al., at 30 kev.

From 20 kev to 900 kev, measurements of 1 are available;? fission
cross sections are reported in BNL-325 for the range 30 kev to 10 Mev.
The total cross section in this range was taken to be equal to that of
23"E’U, as suggested by J. A. Harvey.? The value of Vv was assumed to be
linear in energy with a 2200 m/sec value of 2.50 (ref. 3) and a slope of
0.127 per Mev.® A plot of the experimental n and the group averaged
values from 0.01 ev to 1 kev is shown in Fig. C.1. Group values are also

THE MERC-1 EQUILIBRIUM REACTOR CODE

T. W. Kerlin
Introduction

The MERC-1 code automatically calculates the composition of a fluid-
fuel reactor so that equilibrium and criticality conditions are simul-
taneously satisfied. MERC-1 uses the MODRIC' multigroup-diffusion-theory
code and the ERC-10 equilibrium reactor code as chain links. These codes
were previously used separately at ORNL in iterative calculations to de-
termine equilibrium reactor compositions. MODRIC was developed by the
Central Data Processing Group at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant as
a replacement for GNU.? The ERC-10 code was prepared as a later version
of ERC-5.2 The MERC-1 code automatically transmits necessary data from
one chain link to the other until sufficient iterations have been performed
to cause criticality and equilibrium requirements to be satisfied simul-
taneously. The output consists of equilibrium concentrations, a neutron
balance, and fuel-cycle costs.

The system which is considered in the MERC-1 analysis is shown in
Fig. D.1. A complete specification of data required for controlling the
flow and losses in each stream is included in the MERC-1 input. Note in
Fig. D.1 that material is removed from the reactor system by losses, waste,

and sale as well as by nuclear transformation (deéay and neutron absorp-

‘tion), and that fresh material is fed to the system. Therefore, the cal-

culated e@uilibrium cohcentrgtionsrare in equilibrium with respect to the
feed and discharge rates as well as with respect to nuclear transformation

rates.

Theory

MODRIC is a typical neutron-diffusion-theory code. It allows 50

neutron energy groups with downscattering from a group to any of the

elements.' The output'cOnsists of criticality search converged concentra-
tions, group macroscopic cross sections,rnormalized'nuclear events (ab-
sorptions, fission,leakage, etc.) by region and group, absorptions and .
fissions by material and region, group flux distributions, and fission
density distributions. ‘

ERC-10 requires extensive input. Rewriting of large quantities of
input is avoided by using basic input decks;which include information ap-
plicable to a number of cases: To specify a new case, it is necessary
only to spe01fy changes in the basic 1nput deck. For instance, one might
prepare a basic input deck for a partlcular reactor w1th a given power
level. A set of cases with dlfferent power levels would need only the
basic input deck and the new power level as input.

Basically, ERC solves two equatlons. They are:

~N,, (t,.+d,, +q,.—-r,.)=0, (1)

The use of stream and region indexes allows reactors wﬁth two streams in
the same region to be analyzed. ~

The equilibrium concentration calculations in ERC use ieactiOn'rate
coeff1c1ents (C, jk) obtained from an earlier MODRIC calculatlon. However,
the 1n1t1a1 concentratlons used in the MODRIC calculation will not, in
-~ general, agree with the equilibrium concentrations computed by ERC. This
new set of concentrations will alter the neutron spectrum and flux level,
thereby changing the reaction rate coefficients. 'Thefefore, it is neces-
sary to repeat the MODRIC critieality caiculation with the latest value

for the estimated concentrations to-get new reaction rate coefficients.

This process is repeated until the MODRIC and ERC concentrations are equal.
The flow of information in the code is shown in Fig. D.Z2.

The reaction rate coefficients (Cijk) used in ERC are spectrum-averaged
cross sections which are available directly from MODRIC. The MODRIC cal-

culation gives A_. and VF ‘the absorptions and neutron productions in

The material, stream, and region”dependent absOrption and production terms
are automatically transferred from the MODRIC link to the ERC llnk of the

A similar argument applies for the fission reaction rate.

The restriction to fluid-fuel reactors occurs because thé ERC calcu-
lation requires that the reactor discharge composition be equal to the
mean reactor composition Thls restrlction is satisfied in fluid-fuel re-
actors but not in solld-fuel reactors where the dlscharge has experlenced
a much greater exposure than the mean.

The epithermal cross section is defined in terms of the resonance integral

The spectral index, K, is computed by Modric from input data. The reference
element was the standard absorber referred to above. The product of the
reference element cross section and the effective flux integrated over the
core is computed from Modric output by dividing the fraction of neutrons

as absorbed by the reference element by its atomic density, NS. This
product is the desired number for use in the ERC calculations; the working

equation becomes

A [at o+ K(RI)i]

G, V= — =—2
NS ["t,s + K(RI)S]

i

The thermal cross sections o, are computed from the 2200 m/s cross
sections by multiplying by a factor that averages them over a Maxwell-
Boltzman spectrum around the reactor temperature. This factor was computed
for a l/v energy dependence of the cross section and applied uniformly to
all fission product isotopes, except noble gases.

In all, 115 fission product isotopes were so treated, linked by trans-
mutation and decay ihto chains. Provision was mede in ERC-11 to remove
each at a rate determined by its chemical or physical properties in rela-
tion to the processing method. For instance, xenon is removed rapidly by

transplratlon in an expansion chamber, whereas rare earths are removed

only by dlscard of the fuel salt w1th 8 perlod measured in hundreds of days.

~ Xenon was treated separately in the Modric calculatlon, not only to
determine accuratelyrlts effective cross section in the MSCR neutron spec-

trum but also to ?ermit,special treatment of its exceptional behavior. It

may be possible to remove xenon rapidly from the fuel solution by circulat-

ing a portion of the salt through the dome of the expansion tank mounted
over the core (Sec. 4 2 2) prov1ded the xenon does not diffuse rapldly
into the moderator graphite. PTOVlSlon was made in ERC-11 to calculate
the extreme cases (complete absorption in graphite vs. zero absorption) as

well as intermediate situations where removal competes with absorption.

 
 

218

Samarium was also treated separately because of its impbrtaﬂce.

The fission productcalculation'ig thought to result in a reasonably
good approximation of the poisoning in reactors where the fission products
are exposed to neutrons for a long time. The ingrowth of second and higher
generation isotopes)by transmutation and decay is treated in detail. The
transient period following start-up of a clean reactor with an initial
loading of 235y is ignored, and all concentrations are calculated at their
maximum, equilibrium values. Hence, the poisoning is overestimated some-
what, thus providing a margin of safety in respect to assignmenfhof the
cross sections and resonance integrals. o _

The value of ({ must be specified if fission product 6ption 1 is specified
on card BN=5. This value should be calculated using an estimated value

for K. If fission product option 2 is specified on card BN-5, 'is cal-
culated by the code using the latest value of K. The required values of
02200 and RI for a special reference material are built into the code for
fission product option 2. The nuclear constants for arl/v absorber with

a 2200 m/s cross section of 1.0 barns are built into the code. Therefore,
to use fission product option 2, the referencé element must correspond to
an artificial element in MODRIC which has cross sections for a 1l/v absorber

with 02200 = 1.0.

TREATMENT OF DEILAYED NEUTRONS

Circulating fuel reactors lose neutrons because some of the delayed
neutrons are emitted outside of the core. These losses depend on core
residence time, external loop residence time, and decay characteristics
of the precursors.

TREATMENT OF XENON ABSORPTION IN GRAPHITE

L. G. Alexander
Introduction

Some 135Xe is formed directly during fission; hdwever, the major
part (>90%) is formed by the decay of 35T which has a half-life of 6.7
hours. The iodine remains in solution as the iodide ion (I'). Thus, at
equilibrium, the rate of formation of xenon in the fuel isApr0p0rtional
to the sum of the direct fission yields of xenon and iodine, here taken
to be 0.066 atoms per fission.

Al] of the xenon is released in the fuel salt, and since the half-
life for the decay of 12°I is long compared to the time required for the
fuel to make one complete trip around the fuel circuit (about 15 seconds),
the rate of release of 12°Xe is nearly uniform throughout the fuel volume,
being augmented somewhat in the core by the direct fission yield. For
purposes of this study, the concentration of xenon in the salt was assumed
to be uniform.

The solubility of noble gases in molten salts is low (1), especially
in mixtures of LiF-BeFz. A concentration of only 2 X 10!’ atoms of xenon
per cc of salt at 1200°F is in equiliﬂrium with a partial pressure of
xenon in the gas phase of one atmosphere. In the reference design case,
the equilibrium pressure is about 0.06 atmosphere.

Xenon thus tends to leave the salt at any phase boundary. It may
form microbubbles clinging to the surface of the graphite moderator. It
will tend to diffuse into the pores of the graphite. It can be removed
rapidly by spraying a portion of the circulating stream into a space
filled with helium or by subsurface sparging with helium.

Xenon is also removed from the system by decay to 12308 and by re-
action with neutrons to form !36Xe, which is stable and has a low neutron

capture cross section.

THE EQUILIBRIUM STATE AS A BASIS FOR ECONOMIC
EVALUATION OF THORIUM'REACTORS

T. W. Xerlin
/ Introduction

The equilibrium condition is currently being used as the basis for
fluid~fuel reactor economiéfévaluatidn and for new computer code develop-
ment. Because of this increasing applicatibn of calculations based on
the equilibrium state, it is advisable to clearly define equilibrium and
to assess the validity-df evaluatiéns based on the equilibrium condition.
These problems wére considered in this study for thorium-fueled reactors,
fueled initially with ?35U, and particularly for the molten-salt converter
reactor (MSCR).

 The equilibrium condition is defined as that condition in which the
reactor composition is time independent because of a balance between
nuclide production rates and loss rates. It is important to note that
these are the total production and loss rates (including feed, recycle,
dischargé,.processing losées, ete. ) and are hot restficted to nuclear
transformation rates. The mathematical formulation of the equilibrium

state is obtained by setting the time derivative of the nuclide concen-

tration equal to zero:

ti = loss rate due to neutron capture in ith~nuclide,

| di = loss rate due to radioactive decay of ith nuclide,
qi'= processing loss rate.

Equation (1) should be valid for reactor evaluation if the nuclide con-

centration is near equilibrium (90-95%) over a large fraction (90-95%)
of the reactor's operating life. -

Estimates of the saturation behavior of the nuclides of interest in

 thorium-fueled reactors were made using the methods discussed below.

Methods

The time-dependent behavior of the nuclide concentrations in a thorium-
fueled reactor, fueled initially with 235U, was calculated by solving
Eq. (1) without the restriction that dNi/dt = 0. The treatment for the
individual isotopes along with special assumption for each case is given

below:

1. Fission Products

Assume that fission products are produced at a constant rate, S, and
are removed by neutron capture, radiocactive decay, and processing. This
leads to

 

dNi : 1

Results and Conclusions

The results are shown in Figs. H.1l through H.6. They are discussed

individually below:

l. PFission Products

 

Figure H.1l shows the saturation behavior of a material removed only
by processing. In actual operation, the approach to saturation would be
faster because of nuclear transformations. It is clear from Fig. 1 that
the fission product nuclides which saturate slowly with respect to their
nuclear reaction rates are at equilibrium (90% or greater) for 90% of a
30-year reactor life for processing times of less than 500 days. A 1000-
day processing time (typical for the MSCR) gives equilibrium (90% or
greater) for only 80% of the time. Therefore, the equilibrium treatment
is doubtful for fission-product nuclides with low cross sections or long

half lives. However, these effects are small.

2. Uranium-233

Figure H.2 shows the saturation behavior of 233U. The curves show
that equilibrium (90% or greater) exists for 90% of the reactor life only
if the specific power is greatér than about 1800 w/gram. A specific power
of 750 w/gram (typical for the MSCR) insures equilibrium (90% or greater)
for 80% of the 30-year reactor life.

3. Uranium-234

Figure H.3 shows that 34U saturates very slowly for all practical
values of specific power. A specific power of 750 w/gram (typical for
the MSCR) gives an average concentration over the 30-year reactor life

only 65% of the equilibrium value.

4. Uranium-235

Figure 4 shows the saturation behavior of ?2°U. For a conversion
ratio of 0.8 and a specific power of 750 w/gram (typical MSCR conditions),
the 223U concentration is within 10% of the equilibrium concentration for

65% of the reactor operating life.

5. Uranium-236

Figure 5 shows that the approach to equilibriﬁm is quite slow for
236y. TFor a conversion ratio of 0.8 and a specific powver of 750 w/gram
(typical MSCR conditions), he 236U concentration never reaches 90% of the

eguilibrium concentration.

reactor operating lifetime.

correct; and they should create some concern over the validity of the
equilibrium state as a suitable condition for reactor economic evaluation.
Table H.2 shows the expectéd direction of the error introduced by assuming
the equilibrium condition for the nuclides considered. It is apparent
from Table H.2 that it is not possible to predict whether equilibrium cal-
culations are intrinsically optimistic or conservative from these results.
Also, since the relative magnitude of the competing effects depends on re-
actor type, the characteristics of the particular reactor must enter into
an assessment of the direction and magnitude of the error associated with
the equilibrium assumption.

The magnitude of the effect of these factors on reactorrecqnamic
evaluations is not known. However, an extensive study should be made to
examine these problems. Reactor evaluations based on the equiiibrium con-
dition are so convenient, economical, and-unambiguous that they éhou;d be

used if possible.

700° and 800°C, TheSe are

plotted in Fig. I.1l which also includes plots of what appear to be rea-

sonable estimates of the viscosity of MSCR Salts 2 and 3.

The estimates

on these two salts depend on the fact that their compositions lie between

those of Mixture 75 and Mixture 133 (which is the same as MSCR No. 1);

hence, their viscosity curves may be expected to lie between the curves

of the two known mixtures. Viscosities and temperature-dependent vis-

cosity equations of MSREIfﬁél and coolant salts are listed in Tables I.3

and I.4 for comparison,

The viscosity equation for Mixture 133 (MSCR No. 1) is (1):

Heat CaEacit!

The temperature-dependent equation for heat capacity of Mixture 133
is (1)

CP = 0,473 - 0,000238 T cal/g-°C (T = °C)

Values of heat capacity of MSCR Salts 2 and 3 at a given temperature may
be estimated by interpolating between published values of other salts of
different molecular weights, since heat éapacity of molten salts probably
varies inversely with molecular weight. Published values of heat capa-
city at 700°C of some known salts are shown in Fig, 1.2, which contains
a‘plot of heat capacity as a function of molecular weight,

Heat capacity relationships for MSRE fuel and coolant salts are
shown in Tables I.3 and I.4.

Thermal Conductivity

Like heat capacity, thermal conductivity can be expected to vary
inversely with molecular weight. An estimate of the thermal conductivi-

ties of the MSCR fuel salts has been made by extrapolating the published

FUEL AND CARRIER SALT COST BASES

W, L. Carter
Introduction

o9 LiF, Ber,

ZrPu and NaF to determine current market prices. The data are evaluated

A survey was conducted among suppliers of ThFu, ThO

and a recommended set of values to be used in molten salt converter and
breeder reactor calculations is presented, The cost data are needed in
calculating fuel cycle costs,

The following values are recommended for use in molten salt reactor

calculations:
~ ~ ThF, $ 6,50 per pound
BeF2 7.00 per pound
LiF 14,70 per pound
ZrF# ' 4,00 per pound

One of the purposes of the study of thorium breeder and converter
reactors is to furnish comparative fuel cycle cost data on the various
systems as well as nuclear performance data. The market survey was con-
ducted to obtain current.and reliable price information on several chem-
ical compounds which will be needed 1n rather large inventory and for

which the consumptlon rate may -be s;gnlflcant., The inquiries were con-

cerned prlmarlly with molten salt reactor materials, namely, thorium

fluorlde llthlum florlde, berylllum fluorlde, zirconium fluoride and

,:sodium fluoride' in additlon, prices. were obtained for thorium oxide,

: Several manufacturers of these chemlcals were contacted and a sum-

'"mary of their prlce schedules 13 given in ‘Tables J.1 through J.6. Since

it is approprlate to assoclate a date with a market quotatlon, it may be
noted that these data were obtalned dur;ng the period November 1961 -
January 1962, There is one exceptlon: the comparative figures quoted

from document Y-1312 were published in December 1959,

Bases for Establishing Prices

It was assumed that prices would be established for a large molten
salt, power-producing system, Two conditions were visualized: (a) A
1000 Mwe (2500 Mwt) station and (bj ten of these 1000 Mwe stations in
simultaneous operation. These conditions established the initial inven-
tory requirements. The consumption rates were calculated by assuming
that the fuel salt would be discarded after removal of fissile material
on a 1000-day cycle, It was assumed that thorium and carrier salt could
not be decontaminated and recovered.

Vendors were asked to quote prices on the basis of producing mate-
rials in the quantities desired by existing methods and according to
current specifications. It was not considered appropriate to ask a ven-
dor in an infbrmation~seekihg survey such as this to do much research
into manufacturing procedures and schedules if his operations would be
significantly affected by these additional quantities. Consequently, no
rigid specifications were affixed to these chemicals other than the ob-
vious one that all materials should have extremely low concentrations of

high neutron cross section materials.

General Comments on Price Quotations

Thorium Fluoride

Only one manufacturer was interested in making a quotation for ThF,,
and it was admitted that this was a rough approximation. The price com-
pared favorably with the value quoted by orrison (1) in a previous

market survey.

Zirconium Fluoride

Vendors were asked to quote on hafnium-free Zrf,. The quantities

requested are appareﬁtiy quife'large cbmpared with available production,

 
 

270

Beryllium Fluoride

The suppliers indicate that there would be no problem in supplying
the quantities requested. Beryllium fluoride is an intermediate compound
in the production of befyllium metal. Although the vendors state that |

the prices quoted are tentative, they are probably rather accurate,

Sodium Fluoride

This chemical is available in large supply. The quoted prices should
be quite firm. Sodium fluoride is so inexpensive that its use in a

reactor contributes negligibly to the fuel cycle cost,

Thorium Oxide

Thorium oxide is availablelin 1arge supply; the quoted prices are
perhaps rather firm. The quotes compare favorably with the values given
by Orrison (1).

Lithium Fluoride

 

Lithium fluoride occupies a singular position in the molten salt
fuel system particularly with regard to availability and price. Since
the lithium content must have a high ’Li assay, the only source of mate-
rial is from AEC production facilities. AEC-ORO, Y-12 and ORGDP per-
sonnel (2) were instrumental in developing a classified price schedule
for high isotopic purity 7Li in quantities to.meet the requirements of
a large molten salt power installation,

Lithium is produced as LiOH+<H,0 for:which a reasonably accurate

price can be computed. However, ai uncertainty exists in the charge for
converting the hydroxide to an anhydrous fluoride predﬁct since this
operation has not been attempted except in small-scale batehee; this™
charge was estimated. A schedule of basic charges was recommended.(3,4)

for computing the price of lithium fluoride in 99,995 at, % 7Li:

Cascade feed cost () =
Base cost =

Plus 15% AEC overhead (u4)

The values have not been released by the Atomic Energy Commission as
an official price for high purity 7Li; they are confidential information
for internal use only. |

The official price was $120/kg of Li metal as the fluoride in
November 1959 (5) for a grade containing 99.99% of "Li. This price was

adopted for material containing 99.995% Li produced in large quantities.

Recommended Values for Molten Salt Fuel

Based on the values given in Tables J.l, J.3, J.4, and J.5, the fol-
lowing prices are recommended for use in molten salt reactor fuel cycle
calculations. These prices were chosen more or less arbitrarily from the
accumulated data since there was no reason to have more credence in one

value than another.

MSCR POWER LIMITATION RESULTING FROM
MODERATOR THERMAL STRESS

R. H. Chapman

Summarx

In order to achieve the maximum perfdrmance from the MSCR, it is
necessary to operate at a power level corresponding to some limiting con-
dition. The limiting condition may be arbitrarily imposed upon the system
or it may be an inherent feature in the design. In certain conceivable
situations thermal stress in the graphite moderator may limit the power
output of a single reactor core. It is therefore of interest to estimate
the maximum power output as a function of core diameter for the case where
thermal stress is the limiting condition.

It is assumed for ﬁhe purpose of this memorandum that the reactor core
is a cylinder of L/D = 1.0. Honeycomb shaped fuel channels are formed by
the proper spacing of hexagonal graphite moderator prisms. For the purpose
of estimating the thermal stress, it is also assumed that the hexagonal
prisms can be approximated by a right circular cylinder of a diameter equal
to the distance across the flats of the hex. It is noted from the geometry
of the hexagonal unit cell that the fuel volume fraction, ﬂv, the fuel
channel thlckness, t o? ‘and the distance across flats, dc, are interrelated.
Flgure K.1 shows the relatlonshlp for the region of interest. The size
of the unit cell is obtained by adding the channel thickness to the dis-
tance across flats of the mdderator prisms. |

Assuming unlform heat generation, the maximum thermal stress (at the

_surface) is glvenl for a solid cylinder as

Assuming values for the various properties of graphipe, i.e., Oy s O E, v,
and k, and representative values for the fraction of total heat generated
in the graphite and for the peak-to-average power density ratio, a family
of curves of heat production versus diameter may be plotted wherein T, is
the parameter. 7

Choosing an allowable stress value of graphite is a.gomewhat arbitrary
bperation. Experience has shown in the production of AGOT graphite for
~ the EGCR (16 in. X 16 in. X 20 ft long columns) that the mechanical prop-
erties vary widely between different blocks of the material, vary across
the cross-section of the large blocks, and depend on the orientation rela-
tive to the direction of extrusion.? Fracture strain is probably a better
criteria for failure than stress, since it has been shown to be fairly
constant at about 0.1 to 0.2%. Tests have also shown that strength is not
temperature dependent at least up to 1100°F. Since the ratio of stress to
modulus of elasticity appears in Eq. (4), the value of the fracture strain
can be substituted and thus side-step the issue of fraction stress. A
value of 0.1% is assumed as a failure criterion.

For Poisson's ratio a value of 0.4 is recommended, and for the thermal
coefficient of expansion, a value of 2.7 X 10%6 in./in. °F is used.’ A
value of 15 BTU/hr-ft'°F is used for the thermal conductivity at 1200°F.%
A value of 2.5 is assumed for the ratio of peak-to-average power density
to account for the maximum thermsal stress condition. This is about the
value computed for the MSRE.®> A value of 0.05 is assumed for the fraction
of total heat produced in the moderator, essentially the same as for the
MSRE.

Multiplying the heat rate by the overall net thermodynamic efficiency,
one obtains the net power output. An assumed value of 40% efficiency is

used. With these assumptions Eq. (4) becomes

Figure K.2 is a plot of Eq. (5) for the range of interest. Also
shown in the figure are 500 and 1000 Mwe condition for fuel volume frac-
tions of 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20. With the figure, and for a given set of
conditions one is able to estimate qﬁickly the maximum graphite size per-
mitted by thermal stress considerations. For example, if it is desired
to provide 1000 Mwe with single core of 20 ft diam and 10 vol. % fuel, it
is seen from the figure that the largest graphite moderator prism is
limited to about 9 in. across flats.

It should be pointed out that the data used in constructing the figure
are subject to considerable uncertainty. Design data for large sections of
graphite such as likely to be used in the MSCR are, of course, unavailable
at this time. However, it is believed that the results obtained from the

figure will be conservative.

EVALUATION OF A GRAPHITE REFLECTOR FOR THE
MOLTEN SALT CONVERTER REACTOR

T. W. Kerlin
" Introduction

Nuclear calculations on large molten salt converter reactors (MSCR)
indicate that the neutron leakége is large enough (2 to 4% of the neutrons
produced) to warrant consideration of a graphite reflector. A reactor was
chosen from a set presently under study to evaluate the desirability of a
reflector. This reactor, which current results indicate is near the
optimum with respect to fuel cycle costs, has the characteristics given in
Table M.1.

The core con31sts of a graphxte matrix inside a 2-1n.-th1ck INOR-8
vessel. Because of the different coefficients of thermal expansion, the

vessel will move away_from the graphite when the reactor is at power,

“creating én annulus. Since no adequate metal-to-graphite seal is avail-

able, this annulus will contain fuel salt.,
The designer may choose to place a reflector between the core and the

annulus by merely increasmng the size of the graphlte region and omitting

_fuel_channels in the outer portion. The designer also might choose to pin

graphite blocks to the inside of the vessel so that the reflector moves

with the vessel, creating an annulus between the core and the reflector,

 
 

286

A third possibility is a combination of the above two methods, creating an
annulus between two reflector regions.

Calculations were made to‘determine'the relative characteristics of
the MSCR with (a) no reflector, (b) a 15-in. reflector outside the annulus,
(¢) a 7.5-in, graphite region between the core and annulus and a 7.5-in.
~graphite regidn outside the annulus. The core composition was determined
by an iterative procedure to achieve equilibrium with respect to a

2 ftalday fuel processing rate.

“'Results

The results are summarized in Table M,2. Here the materials cost is

 the sum of the inventory and replacement costs., The leakage includes all

neutrons which escape from the system, are captured in the vessel, or are

captured in the reflector,

These results show that the reflector outside of the annulus improves
performance slightly, but that the other reflected reactors have poorer
performance, This behavior can be clarified by examining the power density
distributions shown in Fig. M.1l. o B

The reactor with the reflector outside the annulus shows a large peak

in power in the annulus because of the large thermal flux from the reflector.

Power Density Distribution in MSCR.

 
 

288

Since a peak in the fission rate occurs, the source of neutrons aimed out
of the reactor is increased; however, the reflector returns many of the
neutrons leaving the annulus. The net effect, as shown in Table M.2, is a
slight reduction in leakage. H

The reactor with the reflector between the core and annulus experi-
ences a considerable flattening of the power distribution. The fission
rate in the annulus remains large and furnishes a large source of neutrons
adjacent to the reactor periphery. This source is larger than for the un-
reflected case, and a higher leakage results, |

The reactor with the graphite regions on each side of the annulus com-
bines the bad features of cases 2 and 3. The fission rate is large in the
annulus, giving a large source for neutrons to the reactor periphery,

Thus it is seen that theimain reason that a reflector has such a
small effect is the presence of the fuel annulus., Any addition of reflec-
tor increases the fission rate in this region. These fission neutrons are
close to the reactor periphery, where they may be absorbed in the vessel
or leak out of the reactor, A reflector would be much more beneficial if

a design which eliminated the fuel annulus could be devised.

Conclusions

Use of a reflector in the MSCR improved the reactor performance only
slightly [0.02 increase in conversion ratio and 0.04 mills/kwhr (electrical)
decrease in fuel cycle costs]. Of the reflected-reactor configurations
considered, the reactor with the reflector outside of the fuel_ahnulus was
the only one which improved performance., However, a method of pinning
graphite to the vessel without leaving large cracks is unknown. Also, the
extra cost of fabricating an INOR-8 vessel 2.5 ft larger is unknown.
Therefore, in view of the slight benefit to be gained and the added design
uncertainties and complexity, it appears that no reflector should be used
in the MSCR study. If these uncertainties should be removed and slight
improvements in performance become important, the gains available with a

reflector should be exploited.

DETAILED ESTIMATE OF 1000 Mwe MSCR CAPITAL INVESTMENT™

C. H, Hatstat**

Summarz

The cycle chosen for this analysis is shown in elementary form in
Fig. 4.3. A 2500 Mwt reactor is cooled with a fuel-bearing molten salt,
from which heat is transferred to an inert salt in eight vertical shell-
and-tube heat exchangers; the heat in the inert salt is removed in a sys-
tem of 16 shell-and-tube superheaters and eight reheaters, of a design
similar to that of the superheaters. Approximately 63% of the superheated
steam flows to a system of four Loeffler boilers, where it produces satu-
rated steam by mixing with the tufbine feed water. The remaining super-
heated steam is delivered at 2400 psi, 1000°F; to the throttle of the steam
turbine, Exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine elements. is.reheated
to 1000°F in the reheaters and flows to the intermediate pressure turbine,
from which it flows to a 6-flow low-pressure unit. Condensate is returned
to the Loeffler boilers through eight stages of feed-water heating., The

_gross power output of the cycle is 1083 Mwe at a throttle steam flow of

approximately 8 x 105 1b/hr and a condenser pressure of 1.5-in. Hg.

- The plant design is based on an Atomic Energy Commission reference
Site in Western Massaehusetts.';The site is assumed to have an,adequate
source of :circulating wa_ter'for_':the t_urbine. Because of the low vapor
preéSure of the reactor'cooiant, nigh-pressure containment is not consid-

ered necessary; the reactor and its auxiliaries are contained in a sealed,

7 steel lined concrete structure which forms a part of a subd1v1ded biolo-
, glcal shield with a total thlckness of 10 feet.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MSCR MODERATOR

‘L. G, Alexander
Introduction

The reactor vessel contains the moderator and holds it in a stable
position during all phases of operation, provides for accepting fuel dis-
charged from the heat exchangers, passage of fuel through the moderator,
and discharge to the fuel pumps.

The reactor must be designed to expose the fuel to neutrons at a spe-
cified ratio of graphite volume to fuel volume., The graphite must be sup-
ported and restrained under all circumstances, including the drained
condition. Allowance must be made for differential expansion between
graphite and vessel. Provision must be made fof distributing'the flow of
fuel over the core entrance, and for collecting the flow at the exit. A
free surface in an expansion chamber must be provided somewhere in the fuel
circuit, and circulation through the expansion chamber must be maintained,
Provision must be made for preheating the reactor vessel prior to charging
molten salt, and for cooling the reactor vessel during operation and after
shutdown., This cooling must be accomplished without the generation of ex-
cessive thermal stresses. The vessel must be designed in conformance with
the pressure vessel code. Means of sparging the fuel in the expansion
chamber with an inert gas must be provided to remove xenon and other vola-'
tile materials, Excessive thermal stress in the graphite must be avoided,
and it must be composed of pieces sufficiently small that differential
shrinkage due to exposure to neutrons will be tolerable in each piece,

Stagnation of the fuel between édjacent blocks of graphite or between
graphite and metal structure must be avoided if such stagnation leads to°
excessive temperatures or stresses in either the fuel, graphite, or metal
structure. Temperature at the fuel-gféphite interface should be below ‘
that at which chemical reaction, if any, takes place at an appreciable -

rate, and below the temperature at which any important constituent of the

Y

it

salt (other than volatile fission products) has appreciable vapor pres-
sure (e.g., if UF,, were to vaporize appreciably and diffuse into pores
in the graphite, this would be disadvantageous and perhaps hazardous).
Temperature gradients in the graphite near stagnation areas should not
exceed those corresponding to tolerable thermal stresses.,

In the MSCR it is desirable, in order to reduce the graphite surface
exposed to permeation by salt and fission product gases, to use moderator
elements of larger diameter than in the MSRE. On the other hand, setting
an allowable thermal strain of 0.001 imposes an upper limit. A diameter
of about six to eight inches appears to be a suitable compromise between
the conflicting requirements,

It would be desirable for the logs to extend the length of the core,
but radiation damage may induce a tendency for the logs to bow outward
and this would increase the volume fraction of fuel in the core. This
increase is controlled and largely eliminated by using logs 24 in. long
and stacking these in a vertical position. The ends are mated by means
of pins and sockets., Differential shrinkage of the graphite is now accom-
modated by a slight rotation about the pins,

Fuel salt should permeate the graphite not more than 0.1% by volume.
With this penetration, and 10 volume per cent of fuel in the core, about
one per cent of the fuel will be in the pores in the graphite. This is
probably tolerable, especially if the accessible pores are those near the
surface, as seems to be the case.

Fuel stagnation in cracks between blocks and in pores in the blocks

is closely related to the problem of afterheat, since the fuel so in-

_volved is probably not readxly-dralnablg, Means of flushlng the fuel-

salt thus retained must be provided'if possible, and if this is not

possible, means must be prov1ded of removlng the heat generated in the

“core after dralnageo

- Temperature rlse and thenmal stress in the reactor vessel must be

limited to tolerable. levelso ,leferentlal thermal expansion will leave a

‘gap between the graphite structure and the reactor vessel not less than

1 in. in the radial direction. It will be necessary to provide some flow
through this annulus not only to remove the heat generated there, but

also to cool the reactor vessel,

)

It will be necessary to orifice the flow channels, or otherwise
vary their width systematically in order to distribute ﬁhe flow through
the core compatibly with the power density distribution to achieve uni-

form temperature rise in gll fuel channels.

Moderator

In the MSRE (1), the moderator is constructed of square graphite
bars measuring 2 inches on the sides and 63 inches long. Channels 0.4
irches deep and 1.2 inches wide are machined into alternate faces of the
‘bars, which are pinned loosely to beams lying across the bottom of the
vessel. The channelsroccupy 22.5% of the volume of the matrix.

The shape, size, and spacing of the MBRE-moderator elements are not
suitable for the MSCR. The pieces need to be larger and the volume of
fuel needs to be of the order of 10 percent.

The void fraction in a matrix formed by closely packed cylinders of
uniform diameter is 0.093. Such a matrix appears to be structurally
stable, is easily assembled in a close array, and provides a minimum of
contact between individual pieces. This last is important in that the
amount of stagnant fuel is probably roughly proportional to the total
area of contact. Small varistions in radius, circularity, and straight-
ness of the cylinders can be tolerated, and a voidage as low as 104 still
be achieved. Higher voidages can be obtained by machining away portions
of the surface of the cylinders; in fact, the voidage can be systema-
tically varied both radially and axially in this way. The relative
positions of the logs are fixed by contact of the unmachined portions at
the top and bottom. It should thus be possible to reduce power.peaking
in the reactor and, by a combination of orificing and power flattenihg,
to obtain a good match between radial distributions of flow and power
density and thus achieve approximate equal temperature rise in all‘fuel
channels.

In the MSCR study, fuel-volume fractions in the range frdm 0.1 to
0.2 were investigated. The optimum fraction appears to be slightly i:}

o

 
»

331

greater than 0.l. It appears undesirable to design a matrix having a
fuel fraction much smaller than this, At low fuel fractions, dimensional
tolerances in the machining of the logs and assembling of the matrix in-
troduce uncertainties that become an appreciable fraction of the fuel
volume, This uncertainty can be reduced somewhat by using logs of large
cross section, but there are limits, viz.: (a) a limit on the size of
log that can currently or in the foreseeable future be manufactured; (b)
a limit imposed'by thermal stress in the log, which becomes excessive
with increasing size. Graphite 1ogs measuring 16 inches in diameter can
be made now (1962); while these are not of a grade satisfactory for use
in the MSCR, it is not a great extrapolation of current technology to
postulate the availability of graphite logs of satisfactory grade in
sizes up to 8-inches in diameter, and this appears to be as large as
thermal strain considerations will allow,

I1f the volume fraction of fuel in the core is small, then any slight
variation in this volume fraction would have an appreciable effect on the
reactivity and might result in power excursions. These variations might
arise in any of a number of ways. For instance, radiation damage might
result in the accumulation of stresses in the graphite which, upon sudden
removal of external restraints (such as by the failure of the hoops,
etc.) or by the yielding of the material itself, might result in gross
movement of the matrix, and a sudden increase in reactivity,

Also, at very low volume fractions, the optimum concentrations of
fissile and fertilg,iégtopeé"inthefuel stream becomes high, and this
imposes requirements on the désign“of the external system in regard to

hold-up, velocitiés;:étc.,'that are_difficult to meet.

V,Permeatidn,of Graphite by Salt

-_.Graphite,iS*not'impervibus,to salt. The presence of_anfappreciable
_fractionibf-the salt'iﬁ stagnant pockets introduces a nﬁmber.of problems
(suéh'as that associated with the fate of fission products generated in
stagnant fuel). The "theoretical" density of graphite is 2.25 grams/cc.
MSRE graphite has a bulk density of about 1.83, and thus the pore

 
 

332

fraction is about 0.16. The pores accessible to a wetting fluid, such
as kerosene or a gas, however, amount to only'0.07% of the volume.
Graphite is not wetted by molten flyoride salts, and the penetration is
an order less than that of a wetting fluid. Treatment by any one of"

several methods (5) reduces the penetration further, either by filling

the pores, by closing them, or by making the entrances smaller, Tests in

which CGB-X graphite, newly proposed for the MSRE, was exposed to salt

at 1300°F and 150 psi for 100 hours resulted in volume fraction permea-

tions of 0,001 and 0,0002 (2, p. 93). The occlusions of salt lay mostly

at the surface, and were presumably in reasonably good diffusional com-
munication with the bulk fluid. The pieces tested were necessarily |
small, and the proportion of surface exposed was high. Estimates based
on expected frequency of surface pores in larger pieces led to a predic?
tion of a penetration not greater than 0.0016 in the MSRE graphite at

65 psi pressure in the salt (2, p. 91). Taking advantage of the fact
that the number of surface pores can be reduced by proper orientation of
the surface grains and that with larger bars the ratio of surface~to-
volume is less, it appears plausible that a salt-accessible pore fraction
of 0,001 can be assumed for MSCR graphite. Now, if the graphite occupies
90% of the matrix, salt-accessible pores in the graphite amount to
roughly 0.1%, which is only 1% of the total fuel fraction. However, the
fuel in these pores may be retained when the reactor is drained, and

this may present a serious operational difficulty in regard to cooling
the reactor after shutdown, especially if the core is drained shortly

after operation at power.

Graphite Shrinkage

The graphite will, of course, be subjected to radiation damage,
mostly from fast neutrons. At the temperatures anticipated in the MSCR,
the graphite will shrink. Since that side of a log closest to the center
of the core will absorb more radiation than the outer side, the logs
will tend to bow outward, and increase the volume fraction of the fuel.

These effects will take place slowly, of course, and can easily be

 
 

e

333

compensated, in respect to criticality, by increasing the concentration
of thorium in the fuel or by decreasing that of the uranium, The breeding
ratio will necessarily decrease, however, due to shifting of the C/Th/U
ratio from the optimum. As mentioned above, the effect is minimized by

the use of short logs.

Graphite Replacement

 

The precise effect of graphite shrinkage on the performance (as mea-
sured by the fuel cycle cost) has not been determined; however, if it
proves to be serious, one or more of several countermeasures may be taken,
The simplest would be to replace the graphite periodically. The excess
sinking fund cost (@ 6.75%) over that corresponding to sinking fund amor-
tization over a thirty-year life (1.11%, and which is charged off to cap-

ital costs) is listed below in Table 0.1 for several replacements periods.

#@ $6/1b.

- It is seen that, if the replacement occurs no oftener than once in

tén years,fthe.incremental cost is tolerable, being less than IQ% of a

typical fuel cost of 0.75 milié/kwhr.

- If the shrinkage rate is suchfaS'to.require,replacement_more often
than this, then part of the fuel volume fraction increase might be avoided

by restraining the core and preventing the bowing of the logé. Hoops of

 
 

334

molydbenum, which have a coefficiént of thermal expansion very.nearly :
equal to that of graphite (3) could be placed around the core (%, p. 32).
- Of course, should the hoops fail suddenly, an excursion in the power
level might result. On the other hand, if the hoops held, accumulated
stresses in the graphite might result in the formation of cracks in which
the fuel might stagnate with deleterious effect. |

The fuel volume fraction can be made self-preserving in spite of
radiation induced shrinkage by use of interlocking blocks of graphite.
The moderator elements are cubes having four holes, or sockets, in the
four quadrants of thé upper face and four corresponding pegs extending
from the lower face. After a laYer of blocks has been laid, the blocks
of the next layer are positioned so that the axis of each block lies over
the intersectibns’of the fuel chaﬁnei planes bgtween'adjacent blocks.in
the lower layer, with its pins fitting into sockets in four.blocks'in
that layer. Thus each cube is pinned to four overlapping cubes in the .
layer above and four in the layer below. With cubes measuring 8 inches
along an edge, and a void fraction of 10%, the thickness of the passage
between adjacent cubes is approximately 0.4 inches when the blocks rest
directly on the blocks below, and 0.3 inches when uniform clearance is
provided on all six sides of the blocks. Now, as the blocks shrink, the
fuel volume fraction is invariant, since this is’ determined by the
spacing of the pegs and sockets and the dimensions of the blocks.

This arrangement, while solving one problem, introduces others,
chief of which is a much increased resistance to flow of the fuel through
the core, which may increase by a factor of perhaps 20. This would in-
crease the pumping cost and the design requirements for pumps, heat
exchangers and reactor vessel, _

If difficulty with short-circuiting of the fuel through the annular
gap between moderator and reactor vessel is encountered, this could be
controlled by eliminating the gaps between the outer blocks of graphite
so that the blocks fit tightly one against the other., The annulus thus
becomes a channel unconnected to the voids in the moderator, and the
flow through it could be orificed at the top where the pile floats up

against the upper support grid.

The foregoing discussion of the problem of graphite shrinkage indi-
cates some solutions that might be applied if the problem should prove
to be serious, but it should not be inferred therefrom that the problem
is known to be serious, for in fact, it may not be. There are indica-
tions (6) that radiation damage may anneal and saturate at the tempera-
ture of operation. In that event, the core would be designed so that,
after the steady state is reached, the fuel volume fraction is at the

desired value,

Differential Expansion

The coefficient of thermal expansion of graphite is smaller than that
of INOR (compare Tables 3.2 and 3,1)., Thus, in.a 20?ft core with the
graphite just filling the vessel at room temperature, there will be a gap
about 2/3-in, wide between the graphite and the vessel wall at 1100°F,

If further allowance is made for dimensional tolerances between metal and
graphite during assembly, the gap cannot be much less than one inch thick
at operating temperatures.,

This gap will contain fuel salt, and this fact must be taken into
account in evaluating the performance of the reactor and in the design of
the core and the reactor vessel. In a 20 ft cylindrical core the volume
of fuel in the annulus amounts to ~ 100 fts, which is an appreciable
fraction of the volume of fuel in the matrix (v 600 £t3), This fuel lies
in a region of low gegfron population so that it adds little to the re-
activity. Also, it is nearly opaque to thermal neutrons which are

absorbed,,multipliéd byréta,.and re;emitted as fast'néufrons,'thus:in-

- creasing;the leakage. This concentrated source of fast neutrons and

concomitant-gammarradiation adjacent to the reactor vessel wall intro-
duces desigh problems_° It mayfﬁé néceésafy to pfovide a:thermal shield
between the fuel anﬁulus and the wall. The most suitable material for
this shield is INOR, but this must be cooled. The only available
cooiing medium in this Sifﬁation'is the fuel sait,ran& its use for this

purpose further increases the nonactive inventory of valuable materials.

 
 

 

336

It may be possible to use the fuel annulus as a downcomer for fuel

coming from the heat exchangers, This may or may not result in some -

saving in fuel inventory, depending on the location of the exchangers

and their requirements for draining, etc. The annulus is so used in the

MSRE (1),
