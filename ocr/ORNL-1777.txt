SUMMARY

An experimental determination has been made of the heat transfer coef-
ficients for the eutectic mixture of sodium, potassium and lithium fluoride
(Flinak) flowing in forced convection through circular tubes. Heat, electrically
generated in the tube wall, was transferred uniformly to the fluid during
passage through a small diameter tube. Iong tubes (x/d >100) of nickel, Inconel

and 316 stainless steel were used. The varisbles involved covered the following

ranges:
Reynolds modulus : 2300 - 9500
Prandtl modulus : 1.6 - 4.0
Average fluid temperatures: 980 - 1370°F

2

Heat flux : 9,000 - 192,000 Btu/hr-ft
It was found that forced convection heat transfer with Flinak can be
represented by the general correlation for heat transfer with ordinary fluids

(0.5& Npr < 100).

The existence of an interfacial resistance in the Flinak-Inconel system
has been established and its compogition determined. Preliminary measurements
of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the film have been made. The
results verify the effect of this film on Flinak heat transfer in small di-
ameter Inconel tubes.

Thermal entry lengths, determined from the variation of the local heat

transfer coefficients in the entrance of the heated section, have been corre-

lated with the Peclet modulus.
Introduction

Fused salts have potential application as heat transfer media wherever
heat must be transferred to, or removed from, a system at temperatures above
600°F. Because the vapor pressures of fused salts are generally low at these
elevated temperatures, operation at atmospheric or near atmospheric pressures
is possible. In a reactor, fused salte possess a further advantage. By com-
bining a number of salts, a fluid can be designed such that it can be used as
a moderator asg well as a cqolant. If uranium is present this fluid can also be
the fuel.

This report presents the second part of a continuing investigation into
the heat transfer characteristics of fused salts of interest to the ANP Project.
First reported (5)* were the results of an experimental determination of heat
transfer coefficients for molten sodium hydroxide. It was concluded that,
with respect to heat transfer, sodium hydroxide may be classified as an ordi-
nary fluid (0.5< Npy <100).

This report describes heat transfer with the eutectic mixture of sodium,
potassium and lithium fluoride (11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) known as Flinak.

Some results on Flinak heat transfer were reported in an earlier memorandum (6).
Flinak melts at approximately 850°F and is temperature stable to above lBOOoF.
At 1500°F the viscosity of Flinak is about three times the viscosity of water

at 60°F. In a reactor Flinak can be used as a coolant or in combination with

UF3 or UFy as a fuel-coolant. The efficiency of a fluid as & coolant can be
defined as the work required per Btu of heat removal. Poppendiek, Rosenthal
and Burnett, in a report now in preparation, have evaluated this efficiency for
a number of coolants (sodium, lithium, bismuth, sodium hydroxide and Flinak)
using four temperature difference parameters. In general, they conclude that

Flinak is a good coolant, the best being of course lithium.

Description of Apparatus

 

The experimental system designed to measure the heat transfer coefficient
of molten Flinsk flowing in tubes was similar in all major respects to that
previously described (5) for molten sodium hydroxide heat transfer studies.

It consisted of two tanks; one of which rested on a scale to enable fluid flow
rate measurements, and a test section located between the two tanks. Flow
through the test section was effected by means of gas pressure applied above
the fluid in the tanks. Several modifications were made to provide an experi-
mental system possessing increased flexibility and incorporating metals
compatible with molten Flinak at high temperatures. TFigures 1 and 2 present
several views of the experimental system.

Nickel will contain Flinak but is subject to fatigue failure at tempera-
tures above 1000°F. Therefore, Inconel, which exhibits good corrésion re-
sistance to Flinak and retains its structural strength at elevated temperatures,
was adopted as the material of construction.

One of the major inconveniences encountered with the sodium hydroxide

experimental system was the inability to easily replace system components. To

eliminate this difficulty a number of changes were made for the Flinak system:

(1) The tanks were redesigned to incorporate flanges with metal
O-ring seals for introducing thermowells, dip lines, etc.,
into the top of the tanks.

(2) Each tank was contained in an open-topped stainless steel
Jacket. The heaters were attached to this jacket so that
tank replacement could be accomplished without complete
removal of heaters and thermal insulstion.

(3) The test section was connected to the system by Swage-lck
unions. Use of these connectors, in which a positive seal
is effected partly by compression of the ferrule and partly
by forcing the nose of the ferrule into the tube wall,
facilitated the interchange of test units.

At high temperatures, thermal expansion gives rise to stresses which are
sufficient to” cause buckling of the test section if the tube ends are held
rigidly{ To alleviate this condition, the scale used in the weight-rate
determination was oriented such that the wheels were "in-line" with the
direction of thermal expansion of the system. A turn-buckle arrangement
allowed the weigh tank to be moved so as to compensate for the expansion of
the test section and the connecting lines. To further eliminate strain in
the test section, the power terminals were supported on roller bearings. This
vielded & test section which was undistorted.

The test section consisted of a 24 inch length of small diameter tubing
which was heated by the passage of an electric current through the tube wall.
Power was supplied by a transformer rated at U Kva and was introduced to the
test section through copper terminals silver-soldered to the tube at each end.
In the course of the experiment tubes which were made of nickel, Inconel, and

316 stainless steel were used as the test section. The dimensions of these

tubes are given in the following table:
 

TABLE 1
Qutside Wall Length
Diameter Thickness Dlameter (d)
Material (inches) (inches)
Nickel 0.1875 0.035 204
Inconel 0.225 0.025 137
316 s.s. 0.250 0.035 133

With the Inconel and 316 s.s. test sections, flow at a Reynolds modulus
of 10,000 could be attained. As a result of'the temperature limitation on the
nickel test section, a maximum Reynolds modulus of only 6000 was possible. In
each case over 99% of the heat generation occurred in the tube wall.

The temperature of the outer surface of the test section was measured
with’thermocouples which were resistance welded to the tube surface. The
fluid mixed-mean temperatures were measured in mixing pots at eachhend of the
test section. Details of the mixing pot and‘test section end are shown in
Figure 3. The voltage impressed on the test section was obtained at 8 locations
along the tube. At each position one of the wires of the tube surface thermo-
couple at that point was used as the voltage probe.

The system contained 350 pounds of Flinak, charged to the system as a
well-mixed powder and melted while alternately evacuating the region above
the melt and then purging and mixing the fluid with helium. The helium was
dried and 6xygen removed by bubbling it through a tank filled with sodium-

potassium alloy.

System Calibration

To insure the reliability of the data obtained it is necessary to cali~
brate the various measuring devices associated with the system. It had been
determined in the sodium hydroxide experiment that the readings of the scale
used in the weight-rate measurements were consistent and accurate and that the
current flowing in the tube wall had no effect on the readings of the tube
surface thermocouples. Since the factors affecting these were unchanged by
apparatus modifications, no additional check was made for the Flinak experiment.
Similarly, no preliminary tests were made to determine the approach to equili-
brium of the test unit during the time available for an experimental run.
However, it was found during system operation that equilibrium conditions were
attained well before the end of each run.

The thermocouples used in measuring the fluid mixed-mean temperatures
were calibrated at the freezing points of lead, zinc and aluminum. Table II
shows the results obtained from the calibration of the fluid mixed-mean thermo-

couples used in a typical test series.

Since the tube surface thermocouples were formed on the tube after the
test unit had been assembled, calibration of these couples was difficult.
Therefore, the couples were checked in two ways. Samples of the wires used
were taken, formed into thermocouples and calibrated in a tube furnace with
reference to a standard couple. The results showed a discrepancy of approxi-
mately 1°F between the observed and true readingé at 1200°F. On the completion
of a test series, the tube was removed and sectioned. Each small section,
with thermocouple attached, was then calibrated‘at the temperatures corre-
sponding to the freezing points of lead, zinc and aluminum. For purposes of
comparison, the tube surface thermocouples on a dummy test section were checked
similarly. Table III gives the result of this calibration check for 4 couples

(different in each case) at the aluminum point.

It is seen that the output of the tube surface thermocouples remained
essentially unchanged even after operation at temperatures up to lh5OQF and
despite a great deal of temperature cycling.

Part of the total energy put into the test section is lost to the system
environment. Since the magnitude of this loss must be known to obtain a heat
balance for the system, a heat loss calibration was made. The technique
employed has been described in Part I (5). As the system heat loss is a
function of the density and distribution of the insulation around the test
section and of the end conditions, it was necessary to obtain a heat calibration
for each test unit. Figure 4 shows the outside tube surface temperature for
various power levels without fluid flow. The dip in the curves at the
position corresponding to the tube center probably results from the tempera-
ture profile in the thermal insulation caused by the mixing pot and power
terminal guard heaters at the test section ends. The system heat loss curves
for the several test units are given in Figure 5, where At 1s the average

section. Equation 2 is a modification of the simple conduction equation to
allow for the generation of heat in the tube wall. The derivation assumes
uniform heat generation in the tube wall, no longitudinal heat flow, and no
heat losses through the surface, w.

Figure 6 shows, for a typical test condition, that the voltage impressed
on the test section is a linear function of the distance along the tube. Thus,
the assumption of uniform heat generation in the derivation of eqpaﬁion 2 is
seen to be reasonable. With uniform heat generation and the small axial
temperature rise of the fluid, the fluid mixed-mean temperature at any point,
X, along the test section can be obtained from the straight line drawn between
tm,i and tm,o, the fluid mixed-mean inlet and outlet temperatures, respectively.

The total heat generation in the tube wall is determined from the measured
values of the voltage drop across the test section and the current passing
through the tube wall. Part of the total heat goes to exﬁernal loss and the
rest into heating the fluid. The external loss is obtained from the curves
of Figﬁre 5 for the given set of experimental data. The heat transferred to

the fluid in passing through the test section is given by the equation

4 = W Cp (tm,o - ty, i) (&)

where w is the fluid flow rate in lbs/hr. The heat transfer area is taken as
the inside surface area of the test section between the two power terminals.

The ﬁeat flux is based on the heat gained by the fluid as given by equation L.
The heat balance for each run is shown in Teble IV. Figure 7 shows a typical

temperature profile for the outside tube wall.

The physical properties of Flinak necessary to these calculations are
presented graphically in Appendix C. Since both the axial and radial
témperature differences were small, the physical properties were evaluated
at the average fluid mixed-mean temperature.

By applying similarity considerations to the differential equations for
heat transfer in a moving fluid, it can be shown that the parameters déscribing

forced convection heat transfer are related by the equation

My = B (Nges Npy) (5)
or  Ngy = Do (Me, Npy) (6)

where Ny, the Nusselt modulus = hd/k,

Ngt, the Stanton modulus = h/cp G

and  Npy, the Prandtl modulus = cp M/k.
This functional relationship has also been predicted by the analogies com=- -
paring heat and momentum transfer within a fluid flowing turbulently in a
long tube (1, 9, 12, 13).

Analysis of experimental turbulent forced convection heat transfer data
shows that, in equation 5, the Reynolds modulus generally appears to the
0.8 power and the Prandtl modulus to the 0.4 power. The simplified
empirical equation proposed by McAdams (1),

| Nyy = 0.023 Nge0'8 mp 0% (7)

has been found to correlate, to within + 20%, all data for the fluids termed
olin -19-

"ordinary", (0.5<Npp«100). Colburn (2) has proposed a slightly different

correlation; stemming from equation 6,

J = Ngg - NPr2/3 = 0,023 NRe-O.E (8)

which enables, under certain conditions, a direct comparison between heat
transfer and friction. Both equation 7 and equation 8 are applicable only to
moderate At conditions.

In this report, the Colburn j-function has been used as the correlating

parameter.

Results

The system wasg first operated using a nickel test section. The physical
dimensions of the tubes used as test sections have been presented in Table I.
The data obtained (test series F) are shown in Figure 8. Table IV lists
the pertinent measurements and calculated results of Tests F~J. In each
case, the heat transfer coefficient was calculated for a position far
down~-stream (x/d:>lOO) where fully developed turbulent conditions existed.
The results covered the transition flow region and checked generally the
correlation for ordinary fluids. An attempt to obtain data in the region of
fully developed turbulent flow by raising the temperature above 1000°F was
unsuccessful due to failure in fatigue of the nickel tube. The data
demonstrated thét variations in the entrance conditions, arising from slight
differences in geometry between the two ends of the test section, strongly

affect transition region heat transfer. Thus, the results for flow through

the test section in one direction are indicated by the normal open triangles
of Figure 8, while the inverted open triangles are for flow in the opposite
direction.

To sustain higher operating temperatures so as to obtain turbulent flow
data, the nickel tube was replaced by an Inconel section and a second series
of runs performed. The results of this test series (G) are shown in Figure 8
by the open circles. The data extended through the transition region into
the regime of fully developed turbulent flow. It was apparent that the Flinak
heat transfer was considerably lower (by a factor of two) than the heat
transfer for sodium hydroxide or other ordinary fluids. Since the Prandtl
modulus for Flinak lies in the same range as that for sodium hydroxide, o¢ne
would expect the Flinak-Inconel data to fall on the curve correlating heat
transfer for the ordinary fluids. In addition, these data do not agree
with those of Test F obtaiped for Flinak flowing in a nickel tube.

There appeared to be three possible explanations for the observed
differences:

(1) The experimental measurements were in error

(2) The physical property data used in the analysis were
incorrect

(3) "Non-wetting" occurs or an interfacial resistance (film)
existed at the metal surface

From equation 1, which defines the heat transfer coefficient, it was
seen that to account for the discrepancy on the basis of experimental error
required that either the thermal flux or the temperature difference be in

error by a factor of two or that errors in the proper direction exist in both
. -23-

quantities. Excellent heat balances eliminated the possibility of error in
the thermal flux. While it was unlikely that a consistent error could occur
in all nineteen of the tube surface thermocouples, the calibration of these
couples was checked. No significant deviation from the expected calibration
was observed. Similarly, the calibration of the thermocouples used in
measuring the mixed-mean temperatures was verified. An analysis of the mixing-
pots indicated that the mixed-mean fluid temperatures could be in error due
to heat conduction losses from the thermocouple junctions. Although the
probability was low that these losses were large enough to account for the
variation in the data (an error of 10 to 20°F being required), the mixing-
pots were redesigned to insure that the thermocouple lead wires remeined in
a longer constant temperature region.

A change in the thermal conductivity of Flinak from 2.6 to 0.9
Btu/hr-ft-°F or a change in viscosity from 11 to 0.02 1bs /hr-ft or a combi-
nation of these two would be necessary if the data are to fit the accepted
correlation. Recent physical property data for Flinak (thermal conductivity
and viscosity) indicate the values used to be substantially correct.

The existence of a "non-wetting' condition was eliminated by evidence
showing that Flinak readily wets Inconel surfaces. However, the possibility
of a high-melting film, caused by a reaction between Flinak and Inconel,
forming on the inside tube surface presented itself. A section of the tube
used in Test G was cut longitudinally, and a deposit was observed on the
ingide tube surface. However, some question as to the origin of this film
arose, since the tube had been exposed to air subsequent to its exposure to

Flinak.
- -2h-

Therefore, a third series of runs (Test H) were made using a new Inconel
test section and the modified mixing-pots. Only two points were obtained
before shut-down resulting from failure of a system component. These are
shown in Figure 8 by the closed circles and are sufficient to check the data
of Test G. It was concluded that the difference between the cobserved and
expected heat transfer was definitely not due to errors in the measurement of
the mixed-mean temperatures. The test section from this series was cut
longitudinally; and a green deposit, extending over the entire inside surface
of the tube, was observed. Petrographic and electron diffraction examination
of the film showed the major constituent to be K3CrFg. Some LigCrFg and
small amounts of the oxides of chromium and nickel were also present. The
latter were probably present at the stert of the runs since no pretreatment
of the tube surfaces to remove metal oxides was attempted. K3CrF6 has a cubie
structure, is green in color, and melts at a temperature of lOSSOC.

With the film present, an apparent coefficient of heat transfer is given
by the equation,

h' =

L (9)
(te-tw) _ y
(ag/A7) kg
where A' is the inside surface area of the film, y, the film thickness and
ki, the thermal conductivity of the film. Since the films are thin, the
ratio of the heat transfer ares of the film to that of the clean tube, A'/A,
is approximately one. Hence, (qe/A') in equation 5 may be replaced by

(aqp/A). Thus, equation 5 can be written

g
h' o1 (10)

From the Flinak-Inconel data, a value of 0.0002 hr-ft2-°F/Btu was ob-
tained for the thermal resistance (y/ki) in equation 10. To check this,
measurements were made of the thickness of the film on the Inconel surface
and of the thermal conductivity of K3CrF6, The film thickness, determined
from a photomicrograph (Figure 9) of one tube specimen, was found to be
approximately 0.4 mils. A preliminary value of 0.133 Btu/hr-rt-°F was ob-
tained (8) for the thermal conductivity over the temperature range 100-200°F.
Using these values, a thermal resistance of 0.00025 hr-f+<-°F/Btu was ob-
tained. This compared closely with the value (0.0002) deduced from the heat
transfer data.

At the same time an experiment was performed to determine if the current
flowing through the tube wall of the test section influenced the film
formation. Pieces of Inconel and nickel tubiﬁg were allowed to remain in a
still pot of molten Flinak for 24 hours. On removal a green film was observed
on the Inconel tube. It was noted that the nickel tube showed no film under
similar conditions.

An additional check on the validity of the initial Flinak-nickel daﬁa wasg
made. The results (Test I) are shown by the closed triangles of Figure 8. It
was seen that the data were in general agreement with those of Test F. Again
the influence of small geometrical variations at the test section entrance

has been accentuated in the transition flow region.

Preliminary tests had indicated that Flinak could be contained for
short times in 316 stainless steel without serious corrosion‘or the formation
of insoluble fluoride deposits. Therefore, a 316 stainless steel test section
was installed and a series of runs made (Test J). The results are shown by
the open squares in Figure 8. As can be seen, Flinak in the absence of the
interfacial film behaves, with respect to heat transfer, as an ordinary fluid;
and conversely, the reduction in heat transfer in small diameter Inconel tubes
can be attributed directly to deposits of the type, K3CrF6.

Some informetion on the thermal entrance length was obtained from the
experimental data. The entrance system consisted of a thermal entrance
region preceded by a hydrodynamic entrance region of 8_to 13 tube diameters.
In this investigation, (x/d)e was taken as the position at which the local
heat transfer coefficient had decreased to within 10% of its fully established
value. Figure 10 shows the local heat transfer coefficient as a function of
x/d for a typical experimental run. Figure 11 presents, for both Flinak and
sodium hydroxide, the observed veriation of (x/d)e with the Peclet modulus,
(Npe = Npy * Npe)-

As in the sodium hydroxide experiment, it is estimated that the maximum

error in the heat transfer coefficients obtained for Flinak is T.S%.

Discussion
The first reported measurements for fused salt heat transfer were those
of Kirst, Nagle and Castner (10) for the mixture, NaNO2-NaNO3-KNOg

(40-7-53 weight percent), known as "HIS." They employed s 6 foot length of

centrifugal sump pump was used to circulate the molten sodium hydroxide

through the system. The inlet and outlet fluid ﬁemperatures were measured

in baffled mixing tanks at each end of the test section. The outside tube
surface temperatures were measured with 1% chromel-alumel thermocouples located
along the test section. In addition to heating data, Grele and Gideon made
measurements on the cooling of sodium hydroxide in an air-cooled double-tube
heat exchanger. Their results, for heating and cocling, are shown in

Figure 13.

Using the same system, Grele and Gideon (4) reported measurements on
Flinak heat transfér (2000 € NRe «.20,000) in an Inconel tube. Their results
corroborated the preliminary measurements of Hoffman (6) on Flinak, tests
G and H, and are shown in Figure 1h.

Recently, Salmon (14) using a double-tube heat exchanger, with sodium-
potassium alloy (NaK) as coolant, measured heat transfer coefficients for
the fluoride salt mixtuie NaF-ZrF),-UF), (50-46-4 mole percent) in a 0.269"
I.D. nickel tube with a length to diameter ratio of L40. Center-line tempera-
tures were measured at both the inlet and ocutlet of the fluid streams. An
adjustable probe was used to meagure the surface temperatures on the annulus
side of the center tube. The heat transfer coefficient was obtained by
analysis of the data using the measured surfaée teﬁperature and also by
the graphical analysis techniéue suggested by Wilson (15). The results,
recalculated from Salmon's data as the Colburn j-function, are shown in

Figure 15.

The results of this report show that Flinak, when suitably contained,
behaves ag an ordinary fluid as far as heat transfer is concerned. However,
in Inconel a reaction at the fluid-metal interface results in an insoluble,
high-melting film which considerably reduces Flinak heat transfer. The effect
of this on a reactor, where a fixed amount of heat must be removed in the heat
exchanger, is readily apparent. Consider, the fuel to NaK heat exchanger
degigned for a 50 megawatt eirculating fuel reactor. In this heat exchanger
the fuel is circulated on the outside of Inconel tubes (3/16" 0.D. x 0.017"
wall thickness) through which NaK is flowing. The Reynolds modulus of the
fuel is 5000 and it enters the heat exchanger at 1500°F and exits at 1100°F.
If the fuel is the mixture NaF-LiF-KF-UF) (11-45-L41-3 mole %), then the fuel-
side heat transfer coefficient is approximately 5000 Btu/hr-ft2-°F. For the
design conditions, the NaK (coolant-side) coefficient is 18,500 Btu/hr-fte-oF.
The total thermal resistance is given by

Ry = B% +5'13+(%)w (13)
where, hy 1s the fuel heat transfer coefficient, hp, the coolant heat transfer
coefficient, & , the wall thickness and k, the thermal conductivity of the wall.

If & film forms on the fuel side of the Inconel tube, the thermal resistance
of the system is increased by 0.00025 hr-ftE-OF/Btu. This is equivalent to a
40.8% decrease in heat transfer. Thus, if a film having a high thermal
resistance forms in a heat exchanger designed to remove 50 megawatts of heat
from the fuel, the heat removal is reduced to 29.6 megawatts and the outlet

fluid temperature becomes 1263°F instead of 1100°F.

Conclusions

From the heat transfer results for sodium hydroxide in nickel tubes and
for Flinak in nickel and 316 stainless steel tubes, it can be concluded that
both fluids are "ordinary" as far as heat transfer is concerned.

In the Flinak-Inconel system an insoluble, high-melting surface deposit
(film) results from a reaction at the fluid-metal interface. The thermal
resistance of this film is sufficient to cause a marked reduction in heat
transfer for Flinak flowing in small diameter Inconel tubes.

For systems in which surface deposits do not form, the accepted corre-
lations for turbulent forced convection heat transfer (e.g., j = 0.023 NRe~o,2)
may be used to predict sodium hydroxide and Flinak heat transfer. If systems
in which deposits occur must be used, knowledge of the thermal resistance

of the film is required also.
