SUMMARY

Part 1. MSRE Design, Engineering Analyéis,
and Component Development

1. MSRE Design, Procurement, and Construction

Major effort on the mechanical and process design of the MSRE con-
tinued to be on the revision of drawings to incorporate recent results
of development work and to facilitate the fabrication and construction
work. An overflow tank for installation beneath the fuel pump bowl in
the pump furnace is being designed to replace the overflow line that was
to have been installed between the fuel pump and the fuel drain line.

A fuel pump with a larger volume for expansion of fuel in the pump bowl
is being designed. This pump will replace the pump that is being in-
stalled in the reactor.

A strainer is being designed for installation in the reactor vessel
to prevent pieces of graphite that are larger than 1/8 in, in diameter
from being circulated with the fuel.

The layout of the instrumentation and control system remains essen-
tially the same as previously reported. One new panel was added, four
panels were relocated, and the thermocouple routing was revised. Loca-
tions for personnel radiation monitors were established.

Instrument application diagrams and tabulations were revised to
incorporate recent design changes.

Criteria for control and safety circuits were extensively reviewed,
and some control-system block diagrams were approved. Schematic dia-
grams of freeze valve circuits, instrument air compressors, and lube-
0ll pumps were approved.

Design of 40 instrument panel sections and fabrication of 28 panels
are complete.

Design of interconnecting wiring for the annunciator system and for
Foxboro ECI instruments was completed. Wiring diagrams for 16 control-
circuit terminal boxes were completed.

Design of thermocouple installation and interconnections is nearing
completion.

Process and personnel-radiation-monitoring systems designs are
nearing completion.

Additional analog studies of reactor fill and drain transients were
made. Results of these studies were used to determine the size and loca-
tion of capillary restrictors in the helium supply and bypass lines.
iv

Fabrication of the reactor vessel is nearing completion, but final
assembly must await the delivery of the moderator graphite in October.

The radiator and fuel and coolant pumps are nearing completion. The
heat exchanger and the fuel and coolant drain tanks were completed and
delivered to the reactor site.

A contract was awarded for the fabrication of removable heaters for
the fuel and drain tank systems. Other electrical procurement is 0%
complete.

Except for those items required by recent revisions, preparation of
specifications and initiation of procurement of process instrument com-
ponents was completed. Most of these components are now on hand, and
delivery of the remainder is expected within the next three months.

Proposals received from four vendors for a computer data-logging system
are presently being evaluated.

Installation is progressing in all areas. Installation of reactor
equipment and auxiliaries in the reactor cell, drain tank cell, and
coolant cell is approximately MO% complete. Auxiliary equipment outside
these cells is being installed by a contractor, and his work is approxi-
mately 10% complete.

Work was begun on the installation of instrumentation and control
equipment in all areas.

2.  Component Development

The test on the prototype cooling bayonets for removing after-heat
from the MSRE drain tank was terminated after 2600 temperature cycles
(1300 - 212OF) because of a leak in the steam system. The test was equiva-
lent to several years of operation in the MSRE. Severe thermal fatigue
cracking was found in both Inconel tubes of the bayonet, particularly
near the weldments for the centering spacer bars. A prototype bayonet of
an improved design was constructed of INOR-8 for further testing.

A prototype drain-tank heater was operated for 2876 hr at l2OOOF
~average temperature without mechanical difficulty. The electrical circuitry
that connects the individual heater elements was changed to permit separate
control of the upper and lower zones of the heater and thus obtain a more
even temperature distribution.

The all-metal prototype hgaters for 5-in. pipe were operated satisfac-
torily for six months at 1400°F. A small loss in insulating properties
was attributed to damage of one of the heaters early in the test.

A method of calibrating the control rod remote position indicator with
the actual position of the bottom of the rod at one point was demonstrated.
The prototype control rod drive mechanism was received and is being in-
stalled for testing. '

i
Measurements in the test loop of the helium purification system indi-
cated complete removal of oxygen, with inlet concentrations of up to 225
ppm. However, a breakthrough occurred at 100 ppm after the titanium bed
reached 15% of saturation while operating at lOOO . PFurther tests will be
run with the bed at 12000F An electrolytic oxygen analyzer was tested and
found to agree within 10% with the results of mass spectrometer analysis.

Fabrication of the sampler-enricher system mockup and its installation
into the engineering test loop was completed, and testing was started. A
sample was successfully isolated and removed from the pump bowl and trans-
ferred to the Analytical Chemistry ILaboratory for analysis. The entire pro-
cedure required 3 hr, which is acceptable. The flanged disconnects for use
on part of the reactor sample transfer tube were successfully assembled.
The motor-operated valves that isolate the sampler from the fuel pump bowl
were received, and tests indicated that the leak rates through the valves
were acceptable. Final design has started on the fuel loop sampler~enricher

system.

The Engineering Test Loop (ETL) was placed in operation with fuel salt
after two oxide additions and removals by HF treatment had been performed
on the flush salt and after the fuel salt had been treated with HF and H,
in the drain tank. Seventy-two percent of the oxygen of the first addition
and eighty percent of the oxygen of the second addition was collected as
water in the cold traps of the off-gas line during the treatment of the
flush salt. The equivalent of 625 ppm oxygen was removed from the fuel
salt during 168 hr of treatment with HF and H,. FExamination of the kinetics
of the water stripping indicated that continuous treatment with HF was not
necessary since the time-consuming step in the process was the resolution
of the precipitated oxide to make it available to the HF. Agitation by
bubbling with H, and helium was sufficient to redissolve the precipitate
after the concentratlon was reduced below saturation by short periods of
HF treatment.

After 2000 hr of operation with fuel salt at lEOOOF and with salt in
the graphite access joint molten, the loop was drained, cooled, and opened
at the access joint to remove samples of solids that were deposited at the
liquid-gas interface. The solids, while apparently free of U0,, contained
corrosion products and crystals of the salt that was formed by selective
freezing of the lithium, beryllium, and zirconium fluoride phases. The
apparent corrosion rate was initially higher than that during previous opera-
tion with the flush salt; however, by the end of the period the rate was
back to normal.

Study of the xenon distribution throughout the MSRE system was continued,
and preliminary results of an experiment to determine the xenon-removal rate
at the pump bowl indicated that at reduced salt flow-rates the stripping
efficiency was as low as 17%.

Fabrication and testing of the tools for use in maintenance of the
reactor system continued, with special emphasis on a freeze flange which
had overhead interferences. Testing of an improved version of a general-
purpose light for remote illumination was started.
vi

Data from tests with the MSRE prototype pump showed that the diffusion
of radioactive gas up the shaft annulus to the region of the shaft seal
could be made acceptably low by flowing helium down the annulus and through
the pump bowl at rates of 100 to 1000 liters/day, respectively. TFlow
rates of 3300 liters/day in the annulus and 4600 liters/day through the
pump bowl are available in the MSRE.

Preliminary measurements indicated that the circulating salt in the
pump loop contained 1 to 2 vol % of undissolved gas, presumably entrained
by the stream of salt that is circulated through the xenon-removal appa-
ratus in the pump bowl,

The pump test was halted after 4700 hr of operation to modify the
test facility. It was then resumed to observe the behavior of the flex-
ible mount for supporting the fuel pump, the bouyancy liquid-level indi-
cator, and the MSRE disconnect flange in the pump tank off-gas line, and
to continue Investigations with the device for measuring the concentration
of undissolved gas in the flowing salt.

Endurance tests were continued with the PKP test pump, the test pump
having one molten-salt-lubricated journal bearing, and the test pump for
the MSRE lubrication stand. The design of a fuel pump to accommodate a
larger volume of thermally expanded fuel was initiated. '

Six additional months of satisfactory operation were accumulated on
a prototype model of a two-level single-point probe for indicating the
liquid level in molten-salt systems. Performance is unchanged from that
reported previously. The design of the MSRE probe assembly was modified
to incorporate a secondary containment barrier.

Two float-type level transmitters have now operated satisfactorily
for 18 months in molten salt at 1200°F. A third transmitter was installed
on the MSRE prototype pump test, and initial performance was satisfactory.

A temperature scanner system being developed for use on the MSRE was
demonstrated on the level test and on the ETL. This system has been
accepted for use on the MSRE, and the design of a five-channel system for
this application has been completed.

Three alternative methods for using closed-circuit television for
viewing during remote maintenance operations are being investigated.

Eight MSRE prototype thermocouples continue to perform satisfactorily
after 5000 hr of operation on the ETL. Ten similar thermocouples accumu-
lated 5300 hr of satisfactory operation on the MSRE prototype pump test
loop. Drift of six MSRE prototype thermocouples operating at 1200 to
1250°F_air remained at less than #2°F after 18 months of operation.

Thermal shock testing of ten thermocouples was completed. Two ther-
mocouples were still functioning after 2630 severe thermal cycles.
vii

Techniques and'prOCQdures were developed for use in installation and
testing of in-cell thermocouple extension cable seals.

A satisfactory material was found for sealing the ends of mineral-
insulated sheathed thermocouples that will be located in the reactor and
drain cells, and technigues and procedures were developed for mass pro-
ducing these seals.

Development of a high-temperature NaK-filled differential pressure
transmitter was continued.

Further investigations were made of the plugged dip tube in the
developmental MSRE bubbler system.

3. MSRE Reactor Analysis

The nuclear characteristics of the reactor were calculated for each
of three fuel-salt compositions. In each case critical concentration of
uranium, reactivity coefficients, and flux distributions were calculated.

Predicted control rod worth ranges from 5.6 to 7.69% Sk/k, depending
on the fuel composition. The rods are required to shim only about 1 to
3% 6k/k, leaving ample shutdown margin. There is a large uncertainty in
shim requirements due to lack of information on the properties determining
the xenon removal from the core.

Alpha particles from the uranium will interact with beryllium and
fluorine of the fuel salt to produce about 4 X 10° neutrons/sec in the
core. The internal photoneutron source will be 107 to 10° neutrons/sec
after power operation.

A review of the biological shield design showed that after the addi-
tion of concrete-block shielding at some points, the biological shielding
will be adequate.

Part 2. Materials Studies

4. Metallurgy

The tube-to-tubesheet joints for the MSRE heat exchanger were success-
fully brazed using a method previously developed for this purpose. Visual
inspection and hydrostatic and ultrasonic testing were performed on this
heat exchanger, with no evidence of leakage.

The thermal-fatigue characteristics of INOR-8 were determined from
the conventional Coffin-type test, and a low-cycle-fatigue equation was
found to describe the plastic-strain - fatigue relation. Thermal-fatigue
data showed good agreement with those previously reported for isothermal
fatigue. '
viii

A program was initiated to examine the postirradiation tensile prop-
erties of INOR-8. Subsize tensile specimens have been irradiated to
7 x 10%9 nvt (5L Mev) in the temperature range 1100 to 1400°F and will
be tested for strength and ductility.

MSRE moderator bars are being tested to establish the physical and
mechanical properties of the material useful to the MSRE. The chemical
composition and oxygen content of these bars met specification requirements.
Test specimens from these bars were rapidly heated to 1800°F and cooled,
with no deleterious effects on the graphite and no propagation of salt-
filled cracks. An irradiation program for this material has been started.
The use of molten salt to remove oxygen from graphite was demonstrated
under conditions similar to those proposed for the MSRE.

Mixtures of Gd,03 and Al,03 were successfully cold pressed and
sintered into cylinders to 959 of calculated densities by working with
prereacted powders. Distortion of the cylinder was minimized by the use
of a holding fixture of the same composition.

5. Radiation Effects

Continued examinations of parts from earlier irradiations of MSRE
fuel and graphite showed that xenon could be recovered from graphite
cores even after several months' storage and that, although there was
virtually no penetration of the graphite by fuel, uranium and lithium in
small amounts were found in the graphite, probably as a result of oxi-
dation~reduction processes associated with the release and recombination
of F» during shutdown.

Although the yield of CF, from fissioning fuel containing submerged
graphite was too small to be measured with certainty, a possible interpre-
tation was that CF, could be expected in the MSRE at 109 of the rate of
production of long-lived xXenon. Such a rate would be favorably low and
would constitute no problem in MSRE operation.

The rate of recombination of Fp; with fuel from which F> had evolved
as a result of radiation damage from decay energy was found to depend on
the pressure of Fz, but to be even more strongly dependent on both the
condition of the fuel and the temperature. The behavior of fuel under
gamma irradiation resembled that of in-pile capsules in response to
decay energy, whereas electron irradiation gave somewhat lower yields
of Fp, and x rays even lower. The x-ray experiments showed a noticeable
difference in the response of individual components of the fuel.

6. Chemistry

‘The fuels for operation in the MSRE correspond closely in LiF and
BeFy proportions to compositions found along the 450°C isotherm that is
associated with the LiF-rich region of the LiF-BeF,-ZrF, ternary system.
This prov%des the maximum LiF content consistent with a melting point
below 450°C, thereby leading to the most favorable physical properties
for a given content of quadrivalent fluorides. As a safeguard against
1]

possible alterations in chemical oxidation-reduction potential of the
fuel, normally buffered by the small fraction of UFs; formed as UF, comes
to virtual equilibrium with the containing metal, the UF, content of the
initial fuel has been set at ~l mole ¢ rather than the ~0.1l5 mole ¢ re-
quired for clean criticality. Since this is accomplished by decreased
enrichment of U235F4, there is a diminished heating effect in the un-
likely event that uranium is deposited in the core. The inclusion of

5 mole ¢ of ZrF, as a scavenger for oxide ion led to the composition con-
taining LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-U?35F,-U?28F, in the proportions of 65-29.17-5-
0.29-0.54 as representative of the fuel for initial criticality. This
fuel will be blended from prepurified concentrated fuel, LiF-UF, (73-27
mole %), and solvent, LiF-BeF,-ZrF,; (64.43-30.44-5.14 mole 4), the latter
of which will have been used in the prenuclear operation.

A region of liquid-liquid immiscibility was found in the LiF-BeF;-
ZrF, system, in composition ranges that melt characteristically to glassy
liquids; containing BeF,, the miscibility gap includes ZrF, concentrations
from 25 to 70 mole ¢ and LiF concentrations from 5 to 20 mole ¢. The
exact boundaries, though far removed from regions of interest in reactors,
are still under study in gquenching experiments.

The structure of a recently discovered fluoride of xenon, XeF,-XeFy,
has been determined by x-ray diffraction. Conditions favorable for the
existence of this addition compound may have occurred at some stage during
the decay period following in-pile tests with sealed capsules that evolved
xenon and subsequently F».

Oxide equilibria in flush-salt - fuel-salt mixtures have provided
additional evidence that there is no appreciable solid solution formation
of U0, with ZrO, when excess oxide ions are scavenged from melts as
Zr0O,. Indications in some ranges of a dependence on both concentration
and temperature were found for the limiting ZrF4/UF4 concentration ratio
required for scavenging oxide as ZrOs, but the better than 5/1 ratio
design value previously specified for the MSRE contains an ample margin
as far as operating fuel is concerned.

In connection with sulfur removal during fuel purification proce-
dures, several bench-scale studies were carried out to compare the po-
tential usefulness of alternate methods and to learn more of the detailed
mechanisms of sulfur behavior with respect to both removal and corrosion.
Relatively little change in current practice involving H-HF mixtures
was indicated except that an associated use of elemental beryllium as
a reducing agent, which should also be effective for other impurities as
well, showed some promise of improved overall efficiency.

Among the factors that influence the interfacial behavior of MSRE
fluoride melts with respect to graphite, trace amounts of H;0 of 10 ppm
or less in the atmosphere over sessile drops caused marked spreading or
superficial wetting of graphite but no penetration. In comparison with
H>0, 0O, caused relatively little alteration of the normal nonwetting
behavior; neither was saturation with dissolved oxides in the fluoride
melt of any consequence in changing the nonwetting behavior.
Recent measurements of viscosity as a function of temperature gave
viscosities of 8 centipoises for the MSRE fuel at 650°C and 10 centi-
poises for the coolant at 570°C; these temperatures are averages for
normal reactor operation.

Rates of removal of reducible impurities from MSRE melts were stud-
ied under various conditions; for treatments with H,, both higher flow
rates (10 liters of H, per minute) and higher temperatures had a signif-
icant effect in shortening the time required for purification.

Recent measurements on strongly reduced fuels gave unexpectedly low
values for the solubility of UFs;. The disagreement between these and
previous measurements and other puzzling data that were obtained suggest
that defined equilibrium conditions were not achieved.

A pyrolytic method was developed for determining the fluoride con-
tent of the fuel salts and was tested in the hot-cell mock-up. The salt
is reacted with moist oxygen at 1000°C in the presence of U30g in nickel
equipment, and the fluoride that is evolved is trapped in sodium hydrox-
ide. A relative standard deviation of 19, was obtained when nonradio-
active salts were analyzed by use of remote techniques.

An amperometric method was developed for titrating Cr(VI) with
ferrous sulfate to analyze for chromium in fuel salts. The precision
of bench-type analysis is l%. Testing of the method in the hot-cell
mock-up has begun with nonradiocactive samples.

A radio-frequency concentrator was incorporated in the ignition
chamber of the modified Ieco analyzer that is being used to study the
determination of oxygen in fuel salts by inert-gas fusion procedures.
Samples of uranium and zirconium oxides in graphite capsules were re-
duced to carbides within a 5-min ignition period in the initial tests.

The statistical evaluation of the spectrophotometric method which
uses dimethylglyoxime and potassium persulfate oxidation for determi-
nation of nickel was completed in the hot-cell mock-up. The relative
standard deviation of the method was 2.89.

Prototypes of some of the equipment for handling and processing
fuel samples from the reactor were also tested in the hot-cell mock-up,
and some improvements were made.

7. Fuel Processing

The fuel-processing system design was reviewed, and minor revisions
are being made to the drawings. Safety of the system was reevaluated,
and an activated-charcoal trap was added to improve iodine and tellurium
removal from the off-gas.

Part 1. MSRE DESIGN, ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, AND
COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT
1. MSRE DESIGN, PROCUREMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION

The MSRE design, procurement, and construction was 78% complete on
July 31, 1963.

otatus of Design

Mechanical and Process Design

Design of the mechanical systems for the reactor consisted mainly
in modifying existing drawings to incorporate recent results of develop-
ment work and to ease fabrication and construction problems. New design
work was started on an overflow tank for the fuel pump, a new fuel pump
with a larger bowl, and a strainer for the reactor vessel.

The present design of the fuel pump was based on experience with
components that existed early in 1960 and included enough margin of
safety to ensure that a reliable pump could be developed in a short time.
As a result the diameter and overhang of the shaft and the diameter of
the bowl were limited to values which, in turn, restricted the free volume
in the pump bowl to less than 2 ft°. The pump bowl is also a surge tank
for the fuel system; and this small volume, although adequate for normal
operation, provided very little margin for accommodating abnormal condi-
tions. Initially, an overflow line was included in the design to return
excess liquid from the pump bowl to the drain tank. However, the design
of the overflow line was considerably more difficult than had been ex-
pected; and since its operation presented several uncertainties, an over-
flow tank was substituted for the line.

The arrangement of the fuel pump and the overflow tank is shown in
Fig. 1.1. The tank is a toroid, with a volume of about 5 ft°. Tt is
located near the suction line directly below the pump bowl in the pump
furnace and is coupled to the pump by a short overflow line. The tank
is equipped with bubblers to indicate the liquid level. Liquid can be
returned to the fuel system by pressurizing the tank with helium through
the bubbler lines or the vent line.

Spare parts to be supplied for the MSRE will include replacements
for most of the major components. In some instances changes will be made
in the replacements to improve the design and performance of the reactor.

A replacement for the fuel pump is being designed. The design will
include a larger pump bowl to eliminate the overflow tank and a float-
type liquid-level indicator to substitute for one of the bubbler-type
indicators. Experience with the prototype pump indicates that the shaft
overhang can be increased sufficiently to provide a fuel expansion volume
of about 6 ft° without changing the shaft diameter, the seals, the bearings,
or the bowl diameter, and without significantly reducing the reliability.
The float-type level indicator was developed too late to be included in

the original pump; but it appears to be an important improvement over the
bubbler devices and will be used on the replacement.

The MSRE was designed on the basis that there would be no attrition
of graphite in the core; therefore no chips of graphite would circulate
with the fuel. Inspection of the graphite for the reactor indicates that
some spalling can be expected; so a screen (strainer) was designed for
installation in the reactor vessel to remove pieces larger than 1/8 in.
in diameter from the circulating fuel. The installation i1s shown in
Fig. 1.2. Part of the screen is welded to the head of the reactor vessel,
but most of it is incorporated in an extension of the plug and control rod
thimble assembly that enters through the nozzle on the top of the wvessel
head. This assembly is replaceable, with some difficulty, after the reactor
has been operated at power.

Instrumentation and Control Design

System Layout. Except for minor revisions the layout of the instru-
mentation and controls remains the same, as described in previous reports,
One process instrument panel was added in the auxiliary control room.
Multipoint temperature recorders with alarm switches which will monitor
the reactor drain-line temperatures are located in this panel. Two auxil-
iary control panels serving the lube-oil packages were relocated in the
service room to provide more space for other purposes. The two control
panels for the helium cover-gas purification system were moved to the
west end of the diesel house near the helium supply station. Locations
of additional conduits between field-mounted equipment and the nearest
wireways were determined. ILocations of thermocouple and instrument dis-
connects within the reactor and drain tank cells remained firm, but the
assignment of individual thermocouples to disconnects was considerably
revised. These revisions are the result of a continuing review of remote-
maintenance reguirements and the addition of an overflow tank for the fuel
pump bowl. The locations of personnel radiation monitors and their inter-
connecting wireways were determined.

Flow Diagrams. All instrument application diagrams, instrument tabu- _
lations, and design drawings were revised in accordance with recent design
changes. The diagram of the chemical processing system is not yet approved
for construction.. Recent changes to the design of the fuel-pump-bowl cover-
gas system, the addition of a pump-bowl overflow tank, and additional
instrumentation dictated by control-circuit design will require further
revisions to these diagrams.

Simulation of Reactor Fill and Drain Transients. Further studies
were made of an analog computer model of the fill and drain system.2 The
fill-system control was designed to fill the reactor in a reasonable time
and yet ensure a salt flow rate of no more than 0.5 cfm when the core is
half full, according to the requirements of the postulated fill accident.3
A capillary restrictor was designed and calibrated for insertion in the
helium fill line to so limit the flow under worst-case conditions. A simu-
lation incorporating the characteristics of this capillary indicated that
the time required for a normal fill would be approximately 3-1/2_hr.

Recent studies of various means of preventing pressure surges in the
pump bowl resulted in the incorporation of a single capillary restrictor
in the common bypass line between the pump bowl and the drain tanks. Further
investigation of the undesirable results of pressure surges2 (possible dam-
age to pump-bowl o0ll seal, reversal of purge-gas flow, and erroneous level
instrument indication) led to a compromise between these effects and the
retarding of a dump and to a relaxing of the requirements for limiting the
surges. It was decided to design the restrictor such that the surge would
not affect the pump-bowl level indication so long as the valve in the line
to the spare drain tank vwas open. Table 1.1 summarizes the drain times for
various conditions, where in each case the initial bowl pressure was 5 psig,
the initial drain tank (No. 1) pressure was 27 rsig, and the bowl purge flow
rate was 0.15 scfm. The freeze valve was assumed to open 5 min after the
start of the run, and the drain times shown started when the freeze valve
opened.

The maximum rate of pressure rise in the bowl that will not affect
the level indication was calculated to be 8.5 psi/min.

Control Circuitry Design. The control and safety circuit require-
ments were studied in great detail. Firm criteria for their design were

.established, and the preliminary block diagrams were extensively revised.

Design of the circuits proceeded in those areas where criteria were avail-
able. OSchematic drawings of the 12 freeze valve circuits were completed
and approved. Schematic drawings of the instrument air compressors and
lube-0il pump circuits were also approved. Block diagrams showing control
logic for process fill and drain, coolant salt, containment, freeze valve
safety, and auxiliary process control systems have now been approved. To-
gether these diagrams describe the criteria for control and protection
during startup and operation of the process system. Additional block dia-
grams of the control rod and radiator load control systems have been com-
pleted and issued for comment. Design of the control circuitry is continuing.

Control Panels and Cabinet Design. Designs of 40 of the 53 panel
board sections presently required are complete. Seven of the remaining
13 are either partially complete or held for revision. Preliminary design
studies have been made on the remaining six panels.

The design of three thermocouple alarm panels, two thermocouple
scanner panels, and one main board panel was completed and approved. Minor
revisions to two main board panels were also completed. Work on two pro-
cess radiation monitor panels is nearing completion, and the control-circuit
relay cabinet design is under way. The fuel-pump level transmitter panel
is being redesigned to accommodate the new equipment required by the addi-
tion of the pump-bowl overflow tank.

Field Installation Design. Drawings of the routing of interconnecting
wiring and cables for the annunciator system and for the Foxboro Electronic
Consotrol Instrumentation system were completed and approved for construction.
Wiring diagrams of 16 junction boxes serving all valve position switches,
instrument air system alarm switches, cooling water system, special equip-
ment area, and the helium cover-gas system were completed and approved.

The design of the thermocouple interconnections, including wiring dia-
grams for the large junction boxes just outside the cells, were exten-
sively revised to incorporate changes resulting from reassignment of
thermocouples to disconnects within the reactor and drain cells and addi-
tion of in-cell thermocouples.

Thermocouples. Detail design of the thermocouple system, including
interconnections, is ~80% complete.

Design of the thermocouple installation has proved tc be more diffi-
cult than originally expected. Owing to the requirements of remote main-
tenance and the' compactness of the in-cell reactor system, the location '
of disconnects and the routing of leads as well as the disconnect assign-
ment and the point of attachment of each in-cell thermocouple have had
to be carefully selected. DNumerous changes in thermocouple location and
other drawings were required before the many conflicting requirements
were satisfied. The design of this system is now considered to be rea-
sonably firm.

Thermocouple locations in the chemical processing system and the fuel
loading and transfer system were determined. The thermocouple tabulation
was revised and approved for construction. A proposed design for the two
thermocouple wells, one each to be installed immediately upstream and
downstream from the coolant salt radiator, was submitted for comment. Cal-
culations indicate that the proposed well is strong enough to withstand
the conditions of temperature, pressure, velocity, and vibration existing
in the system. The design of the thermocouple scanner system is complete
except for the addition of a signal-identification device.

Process and Personnel Radiation Monitors. The number and type of
process monitors remain as previously reported. The chemical plant moni-
tors have not been specified. Panel, shield, and detector installation
drawings were completed, and all equipment was ordered.

Personnel monitoring instruments remain as previously reported. A
drawing showing individual instrument locations was issued. The instruments
were ordered and most have been delivered. The criteria for incorporating
the personnel monitors into the building evacuation system are being de-
veloped.

The criteria for the off-gas stack monitoring system were established.

Status of Fabrication of Major Reactor Components

Reactor Vessel and Control Rod Thimble Assembly

The reactor vessel (Fig. 1.3) is ~90% complete; final assembly will
be done when the graphite core blocks are received in October. After some
temporary suspension of work on the control rod thimbles, pending the re-
sults of development work, drawings are being revised and fabrication work
is being restarted.

Heat Exchanger

The primary heat exchanger was completed in the Y-12 Shops and de-
livered to the reactor site (Fig. 1.4).

Fuel and Coclant Pumps

Fabrication of coolant pump bowl was completed (see Fig. 1.5), and
final machining of the fuel pump bowl is in progress. Work is continuing
on the fuel pump cooling shroud. Fabrication of the overflow tank is in
progress, and a float type of level indicator unit is being made for the
.coolant pump.

The finish machining of the bearing housings for both pumps was
completed, and the pump lubricating-oil stands are complete except for
the installation of the instrumentation. The first of the contalnment
vessels for the pump drive motors is being finish-machined prior to
installation of the motor components. Vessels for three more motors are
in various stages of weld repair of laminar defects.

Radiator and Radiator Enclosure

The salt-to-air radiator was completed, and its installation in the
radiator enclosure is nearing completion (Fig. 1.6). The electrical
heating eguipment is also being installed in the radiator enclosure.

Salt Storage Tanks

The fuel-salt flush tank, the coolant-salt storage tanks, the two
fuel-salt storage tanks (Fig. 1.7), and the two steam domes and bayonet
assemblies for cooling the fuel-salt storage tanks were completed and
delivered to the reactor site, Building T7503. Salt level indicator probes
are being fabricated for each of the four salt storage tanks.

The thermal shield was installed, and the interconnecting piping was
completed (Fig. 1.8). The support steel was installed for the fuel pump,
heat exchanger, fuel piping, and auxiliary piping.

The disconnects were attached to the heater cable, the cable was
installed, and the disconnects were mounted.

Water piping was installed for the component cooling system and the
space coolers. About one-half the auxiliary piping has been fabricated
and installed for the fuel pump.

All penetrations for leak-detector tubing, valve air lines, and
electrical cable were installed, and the welding was completed.

The Jjig was assembled for the reactor heat exchanger and fuel pump;
optical tooling is being used to locate flanges, equipment center lines,
etc. The heat exchanger was located on the jig along with two pairs of
its flanges (Fig. 1.9).

Fuel-Drain-Tank Cell

All support steel for the drain tanks, drain piping, electrical dis-
connects, etc., was installed, and the welding was completed.

Steam and water lines were installed for the steam domes. The drain-
tank furnaces were installed (Fig. 1.10).

bump .

CPFT Construction

Cable trays and other wiring'and conduit supports are being installed
in the basement of Building 75C03. This work is ~lO% complete.

The dismantling and removal of switch-gear panels, circuit breakers,
etc., in the diesel building west of Building 7503 was started. Existing
wiring and electrical gear to be used in the MSRE are being checked out;
this work is ~10% complete.

The installation of the component cooling tanks and compressors and

miscellaneous auxiliary piping outside the reactor, fuel drain tank, and
coolant cells has begun.

Procurement and Installation of Instrumentation

With the exception of some additional instrumentation required by
recent revisions and instrumentation for the chemical processing system,
preparation of specifications and initiation of procurement of process
instrument components were completed. Most of these components are now
on hand, and delivery of the others is expected within the next three
months.

Several orders for components that required special development or
procurement effort were completed. The special components include the
weld-sealed tranmmitters and valves for radioactive helium gas service.
Freeze-flange and freeze-valve temperature alarm switches were received
from the Electro Systems Corporation, and acceptance tests were completed.
Vendors quotations for weld-sealed solenoid valves are being evaluated.
Purchase orders have been placed for all components of the thermocouple
scanning system. '

AEC approval was obtained for purchase of a computer data-logging
system. Proposals received from four vendors are presently being evalu-
ated.

Most of the equipment required for the process radiation monitor
system is on hand, and the remainder is on order. Personnel radiation
monitor instrumentation is on order, and procurement of nuclear instru-
ment components is under way.

Fabrication of 28 instrument panels was completed, and 11 additional
panels are being made. Installation of completed panels and other equip-
ment at the reactor site was started in June and is rapidly continuing.
22

The installation of 149 thermocouples in the radiator assembly was
completed. These installations were particularly difficult owing to the
special nature of the mechanical attachment to the thin-walled radiator
tubes and the compactness of the radiator assembly. Thermocouple dis-
connects and multiconductor extension cables in the reactor cell are being
installed. Installation of control valves and signal transmitters in the
coolant drain cell is also under way.

The ORNL Shops are fabricating the special alarm discriminator units
for the temperature scanner system.

2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

Drain-Tank Cooler Test

The drain-tank cooler test was terminated after 2600 cycles between
1300 and 212°F owing to a leak in the steam system. This test is be-
lieved to be equivalent to several years of service in the MSRE. TFigure
2.1 shows one of the three Inconel cooling tube assemblies after it was
opehed for examination. The l-l/Z-in.-diam, 0.065-in.-wall thimbles
which were in contact with the carbonate salt on the outside and air on
the inside were in good condition. Two of the three l-in.-diam sched-40
pipe cooling tubes that were inserted in the thimbles were cracked, as
were the l/2—in.—diam, 0.049-in.-wall water tubes contained in the
cooling tubes. The third tube was not opened. Figure 2.2 shows the
most severe cracking, which occurred 38 in. from the bottom of the cool-
ing tube approximately 36 in. below the surface of the salt. There was
additional severe cracking on this tube at the same elevation, but on
the opposite side.

Figure 2.3 is a detailed photograph of the water tube shown in
Fig. 2.1, indicating the severity of the cracking. This cracking was at
the same elevation as that shown in Fig. 2.2, and the resulting jet of
water possibly contributed to the damage of the cooling tube. Figure
2.4 shows the lower part of the cooling tube from Fig. 2.1. This figure
shows how the l/l6—in. spacer bars that centered the cooling tube inside
the thimble had cracked. It also shows another crack at a weld point.
The thermocouple shown had failed previously, as indicated in the thermo-
couple test described later in this chapter.

Repeated, severe thermal stressing of the tightly confined compo-
nents appears to have caused the cracking in all cases. However, samples
of the damaged sections are being metallurgically examined to confirm
this.

The design of the spacer fins shown in Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 was changed,
and a prototype cooling tube of INOR-8 was assembled for further testing.

Heater Tests

Drain-Tank Heater

A prototype drain-tank heater was built and is being tested to demon-
strate the structural strength and thermal stability of the stainless
steel container. Figure 2.5 is a photograph of the unit during assembly,
showing the eight individual ceramic-encased heating elements which have
a total rated capacity of 4.55 kw. The container is 101-3/4 in. high,

2 in. thick, and is curved on a radius of 28 in. Each heater unit is
equipped with a remote electrical disconnect and pickup bail. There are
sixteen heaters of this type in the heating system of the three drain
tanks.

The unit has operated for 2876 hr at 1200°F average temperature
without difficulty.

The temperature distributions are shown in Fig. 2.6. Temperatures
on the heater face were measured at the approximate center of each
ceramic element with thermocouples that were cemented on the outer sur-
face of the ceramic, under the outer metal cover plates. Temperatures
on the cover plate were measured on the surface of the inner metal cover
plates at the indicated positions.

The large temperature difference between the top and bottom of the
heater was considered undesirable; and the electrical circuitry is being
changed to put the upper and lower zones on separate controls. An addi-
tional 4 in. of insulation is being added to the top of the enclosure to

point. Testing will continue when the changes are completed.

Pipe Heater with Reflective Insulation

The reflectively insulated heater boxes for the 5-in. pipe were
operated as a life test. Data from the beginning and the end of six
months of continuous operation at 1400°F are compared in Fig. 2.7. The
increased heat loss is due to a change in the emissivity of the lamina-
tions and damage to the silver plating of one of the units, as previ-
ously reported.t Silver plating of the undamaged heater is in excellent
condition. Both units under test appear to be in good condition, with
little warping. A contract has been let to the Mirror Insulation
Company of Lambertville, New Jersey, for the detailed design and fabri-
cation of similar heaters for the reactor.

Control Rod

The variation in length of the flexible control rod after a scram
operation continues to be a problem. The accuracy of the rod position
meafurement needed for use in analysis of reactivity data was established
as =0.z2 in. ©Since the position-indicating devices operate at the upper

tion in length due to distortion, thermal expansion, or slip in mechani-

A positive position indicator is being tested which will detect the
passage of the lower end of the rod past a known point. It is a simple
ailr gage that makes use of the cooling air which normally flows down
the hollow control rod. An air-exhaust nozzle with radial ports is
attached to the bottom end of the rod, and a throat (or restrictor) is
welded into the guide bar cage at a known point in the thimble. When
the nozzle passes through the throat, a clear signal is indicated on the
recording of the pressure drop across the rod. By calibrating the
synchro indicators of rod position with the pressure signals when a rod
is installed, any change in the rod length during operation is indicated
as a change in the calibration. Preliminary results show that the error
in indication of the single position is < 0.1 in.

Control Rod Prototype

The prototype rod drive mechanism was received from the Vard Corpo-
ration of Pasadena, California,in mid-July. Figure 2.8 shows the complete
drive unit together with its housing, and Fig. 2.9 shows the power- and
the position-indicator package. One of the position-indicator synchros
was found to be electrically grounded internally and was returned to the
contractor for replacement.

Installation of the prototype control rod test facility is essen-
tially complete. Figure 2.10 shows the complete control rod thlmble, in-
cluding the drive unit adaptor flange.

The section of thimble from the hangers down will be immersed in
salt in the reactor and will be heated in a furnace to reactor tempera-
tures for the test. The overall length of the thimble is 11 ft, 3- 1/2 in.

The complete control rod system will be tested when the control cir-

cuitry is checked.

Helium Purification System

Construction of the test loop for the helium purification system was
completed, and proof testing of the dryer and oxygen-removal unit was
started. The loop consists of a molecular sieve dryer for water removal
and a high-temperature titanium spongebed for oxygen removal, plus asso-
ciated flow, pressure, and temperature controls and analytical equipment
for determining the moisture and oxygen content of the gas stream. The
dryer and oxygen-removal unit are full-scale replicas of units designed
for the MSRE cover-gas system. The efficiency of the system is checked
by introducing helium at known impurity levels and monitoring the effluent
gas. A number of short (<l4-hr) runs were made with the oxygen-removal
unit at 1000°F, the loop flow at design conditions of 10 liters per
minute of helium, and with varying inlet-oxygen concentrations. Initially,
complete removal (<0.l ppm) was obtained with inlet concentrations up to
225 ppm; but after the titanium bed reached 15% of saturation, break-
through occurred at an inlet concentration of 100 ppm, indicating that a
higher operating temperature will be required.
35

The unit was shut down to repair a leak in the lower flange of the
oxygen-removal unit. Examination of the oxygen removal unit, which had
been at temperature for 1500 hr during the test period, showed the con-
dition of the internal parts to be satisfactory. Future tests will be
made with the oxygen-removal unit at lZOOOF, and data will be obtained on
both oxygen- and moisture-removal efficlencies.

The oxygen concentrations were measured during the above tests with
a Lockwood and McLorie electrolytic oxygen analyzer, model E. Agreement
to within 10% has been found with mass spectrometry analysis' of samples
of helium that contained more than 20 ppm oxygen, and the accuracy at
1 ppm oxygen is expected to be about the same.

Sampler-Enricher System Mockup

Fabrication of the sampler-enricher system mockup and its installa-
tion into the Engineering Test Loop (EEL) was completed, and testing was
started. The mechanical equipment being used in the mockup may be used
later to sample the reactor coolant salt system, and the instruments
and electrical control panels will be used in the reactor fuel sampler-
enricher system.

After components were checked out and tested individually, the entire
system was used to isolate a sample of the uranium bearing salt from the
pump bowl of the ETL. In general, the system operated as planned. Ap-
proximately 3 hr was required to complete the sampling operation. After
a few changes are made, mostly in the control systems, the sampling time
should be reduced to about 2 hr.

The cable drive mechanism,? as shown in Fig. 2.11, operated satis-
factorily during the test. In one test the drive mechanism was overloaded
to the stalled condition without apparent damage to the motor. Readings
on the capsule position indicator were reproducible to <l/h in. In the
fully withdrawn position the capsule latch properly positioned itself such
that it could be operated with the manipulator, except in a few cases in
which the latch had been rotated 180° about the cable by hand. In these
cases the latch hung in the rotated position, and the manipulator was
needed to pivot it into proper alignment. Minor designh modifications will
improve this self-aligning mechanism. The latch and attached capsule were
inserted and withdrawn into the pump bowl through the transfer tube with-
out difficulty.

The sample capsule was attached to and released from the latch easily
with the manipulator and required about 1 min. The manipulator was also
used to guide the sample transport container into place on the jig. Ex-
cept for leskage at the end seals of the two-ply boots used to exclude
oxygen from the manipulator work area, the manipulator was satisfactory.
Additional work will be done on the boot seals to eliminate meclding flaws.

Satisfactory viewing in three dimensions inside the manipulator area
was provided by the periscope and one 100-w light bulb. The entire field
of activity was viewed by a slight rotation of the periscope or its
mirror.

Capillary flow restrictors are used to control helium flow rates to
various parts of the system and to measure helium leak rates through the
numerous double-sealing, buffered valves and closures. By maintaining a
constant helium supply pressure to the flow restrictors, the downstream
pressure is proportioned to the gas flow through the restrictor. The
leak-detector lines are supplied from a common restrictor with a pressure
gage and an alarm to indicate an excessive flow. The sample-removal
valve, the operational valve, and the access port have individual flow
restrictors and pressure recorders which are used in the control circuit
to indicate proper closure. The accuracy of indication obtained with
these devices was equivalent to a flow rate of approximately 1 em? of
helium (STP) per minute.

Flange Disconnects

Two sets of ring-joint flanges with integral rings3 were fabricated
as parts of the sample transfer tube for the reactor. The assembled sets
are shown in Fig. 2.12. One set was fabricated from forging blanks of
304 stainless steel and the other from INOR-8. Helium leak rates of
<5x1078 cm3 (STP)/sec were obtained on both sets on the initial assembly.
A torque of 40 1b-ft was required to bring the spring clamps into place.
The disconnects will be retested after they are welded into place.

Operational and Maintenance Valves

Three l-l/Z—in. IPS valves with motor operators, manufactured by the
William Powell Company of Cincinnati, Chio, were received for use as the
operational and maintenance valves of the reactor sampler. Acceptance
tests performed at the factory gave a total helium leak rate across both
gate seals of <0.2 cm® (STP)/min, with a 40-psi pressure differential
supplied through the leak-detector opening. Since the motor operator is
larger than the one used in the initial layout, minor redesign of the
valve contaimment box was necessary.

Design

The sampler-enricher is being redesigned for use in the MSRE. Most
of the changes involve only a repackaging of various components to reduce
the size of the contaimment access openings and to locate all gas and
electrical disconnects outside the contaimment boxes. The cost of re-
design will be partially offset by a reduction in fabrication and main-
tenance costs.

Engineering Test Loop

The ETL was placed in operation with fuel salt in April 1963 after
two oxide additions and removals by HF treatment had been performed on
the flush salt?® and after the fuel salt had been treated with HF and H,
in the drain tank. To facilitate removal of samples of any solids which
might accumulate at the graphite container access joint,> the liquid
level in the joint was controlled by trapped gas pressure and no frozen
seal was formed. The increase in chromium concentration in salt samples
removed during fuel-salt operation indicated a corrosion rate three
times that experienced during previous flush-salt operation. The loop
was shut down in June, after 2000 hr continuous operation, for examina-
tion of the joint and in preparation for testing the operation of the
sampler-enricher mockup.®

Treatment of Flush Salt with HF in ETL Drain Tank Following Oxide Additions

Following the treatments of the flush salt with HF and H, to remove
oxide that was introduced by the graphite, two additional treatments were
performed to evaluate the oxide-removal and cold trap collection effi-
ciency. Beryllium oxide was added in an amount equal to ~100 ppm oxygen
in the salt. The HF treatment began ten days later (the fifth treatment
in this tank), and 72% of the added oxygen was collected as water in the
cold traps in the off-gas line. Following the installation of an im-
proved moisture trap in the off-gas line, a second oxide-addition test
indicated removal of 80% of the oxygen that was charged.

Treatment of PFuel Salt with HF in ETL Drain Tank

* In preparation for loop operation with fuel salt, the salt was treat-~
ed with HF in the alternate ETL drain tank. An equivalent of 625 ppm of

39

oxygen was removed from the 162 kg of salt during 168 hr of treatment with
a mixture of H, and HF. The large total amount of oxide that was removed
and the low solubility of oxide in this salt” indicate that a large por-
tion was a precipitate.

Figure 2.13 shows the water collection rates observed during the HF
treatment of the fuel salt. Each of two periods of HF treatment was
followed by a period of stripping with H, and He. The kinetics of water
stripping is characteristic of a process where the metal oxide (ZrOE) is
present as two phases in the salt mix. The active phase is undoubtedly
dissolved in the molten salt and reacts rapidly with HF. The inactive
phase is probably a solid oxide which dissclves slowly as the salt becomes
unsaturated. The newly dissolved material can now react further with the
HEF.

Analysis of the data indicates that ~68% of the total oxide was orig-
inally in the inactive phase. After the treatment the salt mixture was
stripped by sparging with H, for 38 hr and with He for 60 hr before it was
loaded into the loop.

Loop Operation with Fuel Salt and Graphite

After the graphite was sampled through the dry box, the graphite
access joint was opened to the atmosphere so that the deposit which re-
mained from the flush-salt operation could be removed. This was done to
provide a clean surface for any subsequent deposition during fuel-salt
operation. After the loop was reassembled, it was evacuated at 200°F and
then cleaned with flush salt. To prevent contact with the cleaned access
joint surface, the flush salt was kept out of the annulus by a continuous
bleed of helium into the joint.

The loop was placed in operation with fuel salt on April 4 and oper-
ated at 1200°F until June 27 for a total of 2018 hr.

Operation of the Graphite Container Access Joint

The access joint was again operated without a frozen salt seal so
that samples might be obtained if any deposit collected due to cold trap-
ping. After the loop was filled with salt, the liquid level in the joint
was adjusted to the position and temperature of the previous operation
with flush salt,® but without the stabilizing benefit of the frozen salt
cake at the top of the joint.

For the first 500 to 600 hr of operation, the salt level in the
Jjoint rose slowly upward, necessitating periodic additions of gas to
maintain the desired level detected by thermocouples. Tesgsts with a
helium leak detector showed that this effect was not caused by a loss of
the trapped gas due to leakage. The possibility that the loss of gas
was due to transport from the joint to the lower pressure of the pump
bowl as dissolved gas in the molten salt was tested by introducing argon
into the joint annulus. The much lower solubility of argon in molten
salt caused the loss of gas to be reduced to an insignificant amount;
and the liquid level remained reasonably stable (¥1/8 in. estimated),
with no additions of gas being necessary during the final 1400 to 1500
hr of operation. By cooling the upper portion of the joint with air,
the container wall at the liquid-gas interface was maintained at ~lOOOOF,
200° below the bulk salt temperature.

The loop was drained with cooling air on the upper joint and with-
out additional heat. The joint was examined via the removable dry box
facility,9 and samples of the deposit were removed for analysis. Unlike
the previous joint that was exposed to flush salt, the removable plug
was completely clear of any deposit or discoloration below the liquid
level. At the liquid level, there was a deposit on a portion of the cir-
cumference of the plug, with only a discoloration on the remainder. The
deposit occurred on the side corresponding to the salt outlet of the
graphite container, indicating it to be flow oriented, as was noted dur-
ing previous operation. The deposit appeared in definite layers, begin-
ning next to the metal wall with a dark, metallic layer that was covered

41

with salt crystal bands of green, clear (white), and orange. The pre-
dominant layer contained the white crystals and occurred at the liquid
level. This crust formed, evidently to the exclusion of uranium bearing
phases, by selective freezing of the lithium, beryllium, and zirconium
phases identified in Table 2.1l. The presence of the ZLi-BeF,, which
melts at 8500F, would indicate the temperature to be this low at this
location of the joint. This is possible, even though the outside wall
temperature was recorded at approximately lOOOOF, because the tempera-
ture gradient at this point is very steep. Zirconium oxide was identi-
fied petrographically, but no uranium oxide was detected.

Chemical analyses of two of these samples are given in Table 2.2
along with the analysis of a typical salt sample that was removed from
the circulated fluid during operation.

Analysis for Chromium as an Indication of Corrosion

Since corrosive attack by trace impurities is directed toward chro-
mium in the container walls,l most of the salt samples removed from the
loop during operation are routinely analyzed for chromium and iron
(analysis for nickel usually shows <10 ppm).
42

It was noted that there was a much more rapid increase in chromium
during the fuel-salt operation than during flush-salt operation. Figure
2.14 shows chromium and iron during both operations for comparison. Al-
though the loop and graphite container are fabricated of INOR-8, an esti-
mated 35% of the wetted loop surface area is Inconel in the Dana pump.

If it is assumed that chromium is removed to a uniform depth from both
Inconel and INOR-8 surfaces, the increase of 500 ppm during fuel-salt
operation shown in Figure 2.14 represents the removal of chromium to a
depth of 0.7 mil during 2000 hr of operation.

The initial sharp increase of chromium and iron during fuel-salt op-
eration is difficult to account for by the reaction with moisture in the
loop or by residual HF in the salt after treatment. However, it is pos-
sible that the available iron and chromium in solution, which were oxi-
dized to the 3% state by the HF treatment, were not reduced owing to in-
sufficient hydrogen stripping. Thus the initial 200 ppm Fe 3t and 40O

Xenon Transport in MSRE System

Preliminary studies have shown that the xenon distribution through-
out the MSRE system (and the Xel3® poison level) is strongly dependent on
the removal efficiency in the pump bowl (Fig. 2.15). Experiments have
been planned and are being conducted for determining this removal effi-
ciency.

Prototype Pump Testing Facility

The initial experiments for measuring removal efficiency were at-
tempted in the MSRE prototype pump testing facility. Since there was no
effective means for measuring the concentration of dissolved tracer gas
in molten salt, it was necessary to monitor the tracer activity in the
pump bowl gas space. The experiments consisted in saturating the system
with a tracer gas (Kr®%), purging the pump bowl with helium, and monitor-
ing the decay of the tracer concentration in the pump bowl. The insolu-
bility of Kr®5 in molten salt prevented determination of the removal
efficiency. At saturated equilibrium the volumetric concentration of
Kr8% in molten salt is 1/1600 the Kr®> concentration in the gas space.
Thus, during the purging of the gas space, the Kr® (dissolved in the
liquid) was removed; but its effect on the Kr8% gas concentration in the
pump bowl could not be detected. The gas concentration in the pump bowl
must decay by a factor of 1000 before the gas concentration in the liquid
will affect it and a difference in stripping ability can be realized.
These results are shown in Fig. 2.16. Such low tracer concentrations
could not be monitored, and subsequent experiments were conducted in the
wvater test pump loop.

Water Test Pump LooplZ2

The problems of low solubility of tracer and sensitivity of analysis
are reduced by using carbon dioxide in solution in water for the test.
The information from the COs-water experiments will be applied toward the
determination of the efficiency of stripping xenon from molten salt. This
experimental facility is similar to the prototype pump testing facility in
all necessary requirements for conducting a stripping experiment, namely,
size and configuration of pump bowl and stripping device. Carbon dioxide
is dissolved in the water and is removed by an air purge through the pump
bowl.

The main difficulty has been caused by the production of bubbles of
air, water vapor, and carbon dioxide in localized low-pressure zones.
The presence of bubbles complicates the analysis of the experimental data.
However, a low-pressure zone caused by a valve, orifice, or pipe bend is
an excellent stripping device and may provide an effective means of xenon
control. BSystem modifications and operation with low flow rates were
necessary measures taken toward the elimination of bubbles. The first
bubble-free results, taken with a flow rate of 850 gpm and a 2.2% bypass
fl%w through the pump bowl, indicated a stripping efficiency as low as
17%.

45

Future experiments are planned for determining stripping efficiency
under various conditions of stripper flow rate and air purge rate to ob-
tain a full understanding of the xenon-removal mechanism within the MSRE

pump bowl.

Maintenance Development

After a successful demonstration of the freeze flange maintenance
procedure, the design of the tools was completed, incorporating the im-
provements indicated by the demonstration. Special consideration was
given to the flange in line 100, which connects the reactor and the fuel
pump. Overhead interferences with another salt line on one side of the
work area and a pump support beam on the other side requires a more com-
plex flange-clamp operator tool.
46

This tool differs from the others tested in that the applied load
is offset from the center line of the hydraulic cylinder, thus putting a
moment on the ram. This effect was reduced by using the outside wall of
the cylinder as a bearing surface; no difficulty was encountered after
repeated tests. Additional alterations were made to the support mast ex-
tension to reduce the problem of engaging the tool onto the clamp. A
device was fabricated to permit tilting such masts to a more convenient
angle for working under interferences. The pipe alignment tool was also
modified to permit working with these overhead interferences.

Test of an improved version of the HRT rod light for remote illumin-
ation was started. With this design (shown in Fig. 2.17) the electrical
hookup is entirely mechanical so there will be no solder to melt off as
the lamp heats up. The bulb guard is stronger and provides more mechani-
cal protection. The added expense of fabricating these lights will be
offset by the savings in maintenance time.

A tool to handle the thermocouple disconnect was designed with align-
ment guides to protect the pins of the disconnect during assembly. A
prototype heater, including the power lead-in and disconnects, was assem-
bled; and tests'? indicate that it is a satisfactory arrangement.

Prototype Pump Operation and Testing

High-Temperature Circulation of Molten Salt. The prototype pumpl4
test continued with circulation of the salt LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF,
(70-23-5-1-1 mole %) at 1200°F and 1200 gpm. Test operation of the pump
was temporarily halted after 4700 hr to modify the test facility. During
the run, tests were made to determine the back-~diffusion rate of radio-
active gas up the shaft annulus against the helium purge; and a program
was started to measure the concentration of undissolved gas in the circu-

lating salt. '

Diffusion of Radioactive Gas Up the Pump Shaft Annulus. One of the
functions of the helium purge down the pump shaft in the MSRE fuel pump
is to prevent or minimize the diffusion of radioactive gas from the pump
tank into the region of the lower seal and catch basin, where it could
cause the oil that leaks past the shaft lower seal to polymerize. The
damage to this oil is not important, per se, but gradual blockage of the
drain could result in forcing the leakage into the pump shaft annulus
and could eventually cause seizure of the shaft.

The radiation tolerance of the oil used with the MSRE pumps is 107
rads/g. With this amount of irradiation the oil will flow and drain
from the catch basin. The permissible source in the catch basin of the
MSRE fuel pump for a dose of 107 rads/g of oil with 1-Mev beta radiation
is 0.13 curie. This is based on the conservative assumption that the
leakage through the catch basin is 1 g/day and that all the energy of
the betas is absorbed by the oil. Since the volume of the catch basin
is 423 cm3, the maximum permissible concentration in it is 3.1 x 1074
curies/cm>.

Tests were performed on the prototype pump to investigate diffusion
of radioactive gas up the pump shaft annulus, which is identical to the
annulus in the MSRE fuel pump. The path for flow of gas through the
annulus and the catch basin is shown in Fig. 2.18. The concentrations of
Kr85 in the pump tank and the catch basin were determined with count rate

meters.

The results of the diffusion tests on the prototype pump are shown
in Table 2.3. There was no detectable diffusion of Kr®® up the shaft
annulus with purge rates as low as 100 liters/day when the concentration
in the pump tank was as high as 3.54 x 107® curie/cm3. The limit of de-
tection corresponded to a concentration of 0.95 X 10710 curie/cm? in the
catch basin. Thus, the maximum permissible concentration of 3.1 x 1074
curie/cm3 should not be exceeded in the catch basin if the concentration
in the pump tank is maintained at less than 11 curies/cm3. The concen-
tration of radiocactivity in the pump tank is related to the purge flow,
as shown in Fig. 2.19. The data indicate that the purge flow should be
>1000 liters/day to ensure that the concentration in the pump tank will
be <11 curies/cm3. A purge flow of 3300 liters/day down the shaft annulus
and 4600 liters/day total through the pump bowl are available in the MSRE.

Measurement of Undissolved Gas Circulating with the Molten Salt. The
MSRE fuel-pump tank is equipped with a spray ring and uses a helium purge
in conjunction with it to remove xenon poison from the circulating fuel.
The spray flow of about 50 gpm churns the pump-tank liquid sufficiently
that some bubbles of blanket gas enter the pump intet along with bypass
flow. Under these circumstances the circulating salt carries undissolved
gas in it at all times.

A program was started to measure the concentration of undissolved
gas in the circulating salt in the prototype pump loop. A 10-curie cesium
source was placed on one side of the inlet pipe to the pump where the flow-
ing salt is at low pressure, and a detector was placed on the opposite
side. The intensity of the radiation at the detector was expected to in-
crease exponentially with a decrease in the density of the flowing mixture
of salt and gas. Under steady operating conditions, undissolved gas
should be distributed nearly homogeneously in the flowing salt and should
be detectable as a decrease in apparent density of the fluid. Preliminary
test results showed that the output signal from the detector decreased, as
expected, with a decrease in salt temperature and a corresponding increase
in salt density but that there is need for additional calibration data and
study of the data. The device was sensitive to changes in density of
~0.1%, as determined by changing the temperature of the salt with the pump
stopped. When the pump was started, an apparent decrease in density of
the salt was noted. As shown in Table 2.4 the apparent change in density
was equivalent to the entraimment of 1 to 2 vol % of gas and reached a
steady value about 2 min after the pump was started; and MSRE pump con-
ditions of 1200 rpm, 1200 gpm, and 1200°F salt temperature were attained.

: Investiéations are continuing to obtain a calibration of the appara-
tus with and without molten salt in the loop and to determine how the con-
centration of undissolved gas is affected by salt temperature, pump speed,
and gas-blanket pressure.

Continued High-Temperature Operation. The three modifications made
to the test facility at e conclusion of the 4700-hr run included in-
stallation of the MSRE fuel-pump support (Fig. 3.20), a buoyancy-type con-
tinuous liquid-level indicator in the pump tank, and an MSRE disconnect
flange in the pump-tank off-gas line. During the modification, fresh salt
was added to the system. The present composition was calculated to be
-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (67.9-24.9-5.3-1.0-0.9 mole %).

pump support provides for limited movement of the pump along each
of three mutually ndicular axes and was designed to impose relatively
small forces and moments on pump suction and discharge nozzles. The pump
tank was mounted on the support, and the loop was anchored at one point
and supported at two other points with spring hangers. The anchor point
was chosen so that the displacements of the pump along one horizontal axis
and the vertical axis would be similar to, but smaller than, those which
the reactor fuel pump will experience.

Upon heating the test loop to leODF, the pump tank moved in the hori-
zontal direction chosen but did not move in the vertical direction. Two
tests were made to investigate why the support would not provide for the

52

vertical displacement of the pump. The loop pipe anchor was removed, and
the pump was lifted with an overhead crane (1) with the counterbalance
springs, which provide for the vertical displacement set at zero force and
(2) with these same springs set to provide for 8600 1b of upward force.
The difference in the total forces required to 1lift the pump in these two
tésts and the signs of rubbing noted on lifting-link components indicated
the existence of unwanted rubbing forces in the components. The support
was removed for further inspection and testing and for alterations to re-
move the cause of sluggish operation in the vertical direction. It was
replaced with the rigid supports used previously.

Pump Inspection and Assembly Prior to Current Operation. The pump
rotary element was closely inspected following the 4700 hr of operation.
There was evidence of o0il leakage past the copper ring gasket at the joint
between the shield plug and the bearing housing. This leakage 'had drained
down the outside surface of the shield plug and formed a black carbon
deposit over the lower two-thirds of the shield plug. The impeller was
also discolored with a black deposit.

Droplets of fuel were found on the lower end of the shield plug. A
small deposit of fuel was found in the lower reaches of the annulus be-
tween the shaft and the shield plug. This deposit was probably formed
during periods when the purge rates in the shaft ammulus were low. The
ring-joint gasket groove in the pump tank was discolored along approxi-
mately 1 in. of the periphery, possibly indicating a leak. Otherwise, the
pump rotary element was found to be in good condition.

The pump was assembled with new preloaded bearings, and the shaft
seals were replaced. Shaft deflection and natural frequency measurements
were made, indicating that the preloaded bearings increased the shaft
stiffness by approximately 15%. The new shaft seals contain bellows assem-
blies with the Graphitar nose pieces attached by a clear baking varnish.

Cold shakedown of the shaft seals was performed for 100 hr prior to
installation of the rotary element in the prototype pump loop. There was
no measurable leakage from the lower seal; the upper seal leaked at a rate
of 44 cm3/day. The pump rotary element prior to installation in the loop
is shown in Fig. 2.21.

PKP Fuel Pump High-Temperature Endurance Test

This pump testl® was interrupted by a failure in the electrical in-
sulation of ‘the pump drive motor. The pump had operated continuously at
1950 rpm for 9816 hr, circulating molten salt LiF-BeFp-ThF,-UF, (65-30=-4=-1
mole %) at 1225°F and 510 gpm.

Insulation on the stator and rotor windings was found to be burned
and was replaced. The pump rotary element was disassembled, inspected,
and reassembled for further endurance tests. The shaft lower seal was re-
placed with one having the Graphitar nose piece attached to the bellows
assembly with a clear baking varnish. Cold shakedown will be performed on
the rotary element before it is installed in the hot-test facility.

Test Pump with One Molten-Salt-Lubricated Bearing

This pump'® was placed in operation at 1200 rpm, circulating the salt
LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %) at 1225°F and 100 gpm. The test was shut
down after 58 hr of operation, when high current to the drive motor inter-
rupted the electric power. Disassembly of the pump revealed that the im-
peller and shaft, respectively, had jammed against the volute and molten-
salt bearing. It is believed that the incident was caused by the loss of
two of the four fulcrum pins, which provide for the angular displacement
in the gimbals mount that supports the bearing. The molten-salt bearing
was damaged and is being replaced prior to further test operation with the
pump .

Lubrication-Pump Endurance Test

The lubrication pump'” was shut down after operating 7344 hr at 3550
rpm while circulating turbine-type oil at 160°F and 70 gpm. A short had
developed in the insulation in the stator windings of the motor. The
motor was rewound twice (it shorted after approximately 1 min of operation
after the first rewind), and the pump was placed back in operation and has
operated 250 hr at the above conditions.

Fuel Pump MK-2

Degsign of a new fuel pump for the MSRE wag initiated. It differs
from the present design in that the pump-tank volume available for thermal
expansion of the fuel will be 6.3 ft>, compared to the present 1.9 ft3.
The hydraulic design of the impeller and volute will not be changed, but
the length of the shaft will be increased approximately 8 in.; the diam-
eter remains at 3 in. The pump tank will remain 36 in. in diameter, but
its height will be extended to provide the increased expansion volume.

The internal baffles that control the liquid behavior in the pump tank
will be developed in a water test mockup, which is being fabricated.

Instrument Development

Single-Point Liquid-Level Indicator

Testing of the prototype of a two-level conductivity-type level probe
for use in molten salt continued. This test has been in operation for
approximately one year. There has been no change in performance from that
reported previously.l®

Design drawings for the probes to be installed in the MSRE were com-
pleted and approved; however, the design is being revised to incorporate
secondary contaimment of the electrical leads. This secondary barrier is
being obtained by the use of ceramic-to-metal hermetic seals on individual
leads that penetrate the mounting head.
"

55

The probability that the probe would be damaged or ruptured if the
salt in the drain tanks were allowed to freeze and were subsequently melt-
ed was studied. Results of this study indicate that damage is not likely
if the normal precautions, necessary to prevent damage to other parts of
the tanks, are observed.

Pump-Bowl Liquid-Level Indicator

Testing of two float-type level indicators, started in February 1962,
is continuing.2®,20 During the 18 months since the start of testing, one
differential transformer has been at lZSOOF, except for short periods when
the temperature was raised to 1300°F or dropped to 1000°F. The other
(mounted outside the furnace, but insulated) has operated continuously,
with one end at 1000°F and the other at 300YF. Both indicators continue
to operate satisfactorily.

A third indicator of similar design, except that a hollow INOR-8
float is used instead of a solid graphite float, was constructed and in-
stalled on the MSRE prototype pump test. Testing of this device began
July 26, 1963, and initial performance was satisfactory. Testing will
continue to determine the long-term reliability of this design and to ob-
serve performance under dynamic conditions approximating those of the
reactor system.

Contingent on satisfactory performance of the pump-test-loop installa-
tion, the ball-float level transmitter has been accepted for use in the
MSRE system, and all necessary design drawings have been completed for its
installation on the MSRE coolant pump bowl. Since extensive piping re-
visions would be required, this type of transmitter will not be installed
on the MSRE fuel pump bowl unless serious difficulties are experienced
with the bubbler level system during precritical operation or unless the
new pump, which is presently being designed to provide greater expansion
volume in the pump bowl, is installed. Studies are being made to deter-
mine the feasibility of adapting the present level indicator design to
the new pump. The major problem to be resolved is that of increasing the
range from 5 to 16 in. The feasibility of installing the float directly
in the pump bowl instead of in an ocutboard chamber is also being investi-
gated.

Temperature Scanner

Development testing of the scanner system on the level test facility
was continued.2* The use of the scanner during the heating and cooling

-of the test facility tanks and piping was demonstrated for operations per-

sonnel. :

In April, the scanner was moved and installed on the ETL where it was
used in startup, operation, and shutdown. Standard recorders were retain- -
ed as backup instruments during the demonstration.

The demonstration lasted approximately one month. During this period,
the scanner was inoperative several times because of switch and amplifier
56

failures. The switch failed owing to oxidation of the mercury caused by
loss of the nitrogen purge gas. The causes of the amplifier failures were
not determined. After approximately 900 hr of operation on the ETL, the
test was terminated.

After the test was discontinued, a report was issued by the loop oper-
ator.22 The report stated that the scanner was a valuable tool for use in
operating the loop. It was recommended that some recorders be used in con-
junction with the scanner and that a signal marking device be provided to
positively identify each thermocouple displayed on the oscilloscope. A
signal marking system is being developed. At present it appears feasible
to assemble a satisfactory, low=-cost marker system from commercially avail-
able modules.

The temperature scanning system has now been accepted for use on the
MSRE. The MSRE system will have five 100-point scanner channels and will
be flexible enough to permit blocking and transferral of thermocouples to
other scanning channels, either individually or in groups of 25. All
major components will have plug-in connectors. This feature will greatly
. reduce downtime in the event of component failure. The design of this
system has been completed. Components have been ordered, and panels are
being fabricated.

Thermocouple Development and Testing

Ingineering Test Loop Thermocouples. Eight MSRE prototype surface-
mounted thermocouples on the ETL facility continued to be checked periodi-
cally for performance. All the thermocouples were still functioning proper-
ly after 5000 hr of operation at temperatures up to 1200°F.

Prototype Pump Test Loop Thermocouples. Ten MSRE prototype surface-
mounted thermocouples on the prototype pump test loop continued operation
at temperatures up to 1200°F. A1l the thermocouples had accumulated 5300
hr of satisfactory service when the loop was shut down for pump modifica-
tions in May 1963.

Bayonet Thermocouples. The testing of thermocouples in the drain-tank
test facility for endurance under thermal shock in the temperature range
1350 to 200°F was completed. The failure of two more thermocouples at
2630 cycles plus previously reported failuresZ>® left only three of ten
thermocouples still functioning. The bayonet tubes to which the thermo-
couples were attached were removed from the rig and submitted to Metal-
lurgy for examination. Several of the thermocouples were broken at one
or more points along the portion of their length which had been subjected
to the thermal shock. It is believed that some of this damage was in-
flicted during the removal operation.

Drift Test. The observed drift in the calibration of six Inconel-
sheathed MgO-insulated Chromel-P — Alumel thermocouples, operating in air
at 1200 to 1250°F, remained the same (f2°F) after 18 months, as was previ-
ously reported. No further drift tests will be conducted with the agbove
thermocouples since they were not made with material to be used in the

57

MSRE. Future tests will be conducted with thermocouples made with MSRE
materials.

Thermocouple End Seals. The testing of materials and techniques for
use in sealing the ends of mineral-insulated thermoccouples and copper-
tube-sheathed thermocouple extension cables was continued.Z% Experiments
were conducted with Physical Science Corporation 0900 glaze compound to
develop procedures for mass productionof this type of seal on the ends
of mineral-insulated thermocouples that terminate at disconnects inside
the reactor and drain-tank cells. Several satisfactory seals were made
with this material under laboratory conditions.

A shrinkable tube made by Rayclad Tubes was tested for use in sealing
the ends of mineral-insulated thermoccuples located outside the reactor
and drain-tank cells. Test seals made with this material were leaktight
to helium at 100 psig.

A typical thermocouple disconnect and extension cable assembly was
prepared for testing the susceptibility to radiation damage.

Closed-Circuit Television for Remote Maintenance Viewing

The feasibility of using closed-circuit television viewing during
remote maintenance operations at the MSRE is being investigated. Methods
being considered include single- and two-channel sterec (three-dimensional)
viewing and multichannel (one-dimensional) viewing, using two or more
‘cameras located to view the subject from different angles.

Both types of stereo systems were installed and compared in a remote
maintenance test facility. Operation of a multichannel one-dimensional
system was observed at the Atomics International Santa Susano Site;
results to date are inconclusive. Rach type of system has certain in-
herent advantages and disadvantages. The single-channel system, which is
manufactured by the Stereo-tronic Company, has the inherent disadvantage
that the horizontal field of view is restricted and a high lighting level
is required to obtain a satisfactory picture. The two-channel stereo
system requires more equipment and is therefore more subject to failure.
At present it appears that the two-channel system is more difficult to
adjust and may produce more operator fatigue than the Stereo-tronic
system. The one-dimensional viewing system has the inherent advantages
of simplicity and lower cost but requires an unrestricted field of view
from at least two directions. Evaluations of all three types cf systems
is continuing. Final choice of the system to be used at the MSRE will be
based on results of these tests and on remote maintenance cperations re-
gquirements.

High-Temperature NaK-Filled Differential Pressure Transmitter

Development of a high-temperature NaK-filled differential pressure
transmitter continued.®> This work is being done by the Taylor Instrument
Company under the terms of a purchase agreement with ORNL. The major
58

problem during this report period has been the design of the high-tempera-
ture INOR-8 diaphragm seal heads to satisfy ORNL requirements for weld
quality and minimum material thickness without sacrificing performance
characteristics. Major difficulties have been resolved, and design draw-
ings are being prepared for ORNL approval.

Bubbler-Type Liquid~Level Indicator

As previously reported,&® one of the two bubblers undergoing develop-
mental testing on the MSRE prototype pump test facility became plugged
with salt due to leakage in an improperly installed fitting. Previous
efforts to remove this plug had been unsuccessful.

During a recent shutdown of the MSRE prototype pump test loop, the
plugged bubbler line was explored with a flexible rod. It was found that
the line was open down to the semicircular pipe in the pump bowl and as
far along this line as the rod could reach. Since there was no gas flow
through this bubbler when pressure was applied, it must be assumed that
the dip leg is still plugged. There are two types of dip legs being
tested in this pump bowl. One is an open pipe with a V-notch cut in the
side of the open end. The other has a closed end with a l/8—in.-diam hole
in the side of the pipe just above the end. The latter is the one that is
plugged. Since the dip leg involved is inaccessible, the cause of plug-
ging cannot be determined until the leg can be inspected, when the pump is
dismantled.

Design of the bubblers for the MSRE fuel-pump installation has been
revised to use the V-notch construction instead of the l/8—in. hole. The
design of the MSRE coolant pump bubbler could not be changed since fabri-
cation of this pump has been completed.

Very little operational data was obtained during this period because
the dip leg that was still clear was needed for back-diffusion studies
with krypton. This work is complete, and testing of the operational bub-
bler has resumed.

3. MSRE REACTOR ANALYSIS

Nuclear Characteristics of Core

The nuclear characteristics of the reactor were calculated with each
of the three fuel salts described in Table 3.1, 8Salt A is a thorium-
containing fuel originally proposed for the MSRE. Salt B contains a min-
imum of highly enriched uranium and is representative of the core fuel
for a two-region breeder. 8Salt C contains sufficient U232 to increase
the uranium concentration in the fuel to 0.8 mole %; at this concentration
there should be 1little concern about the chemical stability of the fuel.
Salt C will be used in the first operation of the MSRE.

In the calculation of critical uranium concentrations and flux dis-
tributions, the reactor was represented by a multiregion, cylindrical
model, similar to one described previously.l Critical concentrations
were computed with MODRIC, a one-dimensional, multigroup code. Resonance
cross sections for the MODRIC calculations were generated for each core
composition with the GAM-1 code.? Thermal-neutron cross sections for
MODRIC were also computed for each separate case, taking into account the
thermal spectra and spatial disadvantage factors.

In addition to the critical concentrations, the MODRIC calculations
gave relative neutron fluxes for each of 34 groups and two-group constants

for each region of the reactor model. The two-group constants were em-
ployed in calculations with Egquipoise-3, a two-dimensional, two-group code,
which gave various coefficients of reactivity, reactivity importance func-
tions, neutron lifetime, and absolute neutron fluxes.

Coefficients of reactivity for uniform changes in fuel and graphite
temperatures were computed for a one-region model of the core, taking into
account lattice effects and the changes in neutron spectrum with fuel or
graphite temperature.

A summary of the predicted nuclear characteristics of the MSRE is
given in Table 3.2. '

Control Rod Worth

The reactivity worth of the control rods was calculated with each of
three fuels in the core.

Method of Calculation

The Equipoise-3 program was used in the control rod calculations.
The cross section of the core, including the control rods, was represented
in x-y geometry as shown in Fig. 3.1. Dimensions were chosen to give the
same transverse geometric buckling in the square core model as in the
actual cylindrical core. In the calculation it was assumed that the 1.08-
in.-0D Gdz05-Al-04 poison cylinders are black to thermal neutrons and
transparent to neutrons of higher energy. Transmission through the thim-
bles and across the air gap was calculated by a P-1 approximation.

Results

The total worth of the three control rods inserted all the way
through the core wasg calculated for the clean, critical core at 1200°F
with fuels A, B and C. The worth is different for each fuel because of
differences in the neutron diffusion properties of the core. The worths
of various combinations of fully inserted or fully withdrawn rods were
calculated for fuel A. Results are shown in Table 3.3. Fractional worth
as a function of distance inserted was calculated and reported earlier.®

Reactivity Shimming

The control rods are required to make the reactor subcritical at
times and to compensate for the changes in reactivity which occur during
a cycle of startup, power operation, and shutdown. Slow changes in reac-
tivity due to growth of corrosion products and low-cross-section fission
products will be compensated by increases in uranium concentration.

The rod worth required for shimming the reactivity depends on the

type of fuel. Table 3.4 lists predicted rod shim requirements with
fuels A, B, and C in the reactor. '

A loss of delayed neutrons occurs when the fuel circulating pump is
started. At the same time, gas is entrained in the circulating fuel by
the action of the stripper in the pump bowl. The gas effects in Table 3.4
assume 2 vol % gas at the pump suction or 1.2 vol % in the core.

- The power shim is the amount of reactivity required if the core out-
let temperature is held constant. (The shim would be 0.2 to 0.3% 6k/k if
the mean of the inlet and outlet were held constant.)

The xenon poisoning depends on the flux, the stripper efficiency, the
xenon diffusivity in the graphite, and the fuel-graphite xenon transfer
(see Fig. 2.15, Sec 2). The tabulated values of the xenon effect were
calculated for a stripper efficiency of 50%, xenon diffusivity in the
graphite of 1.5 x 107° ftZ/hr, and a mass transfer coefficient of 0.08
ft/hr. Considering the uncertainties in these values, the xenon effect
is expected to be between one-third and twice the values tabulated.

The reactivity effect of sm'*® and similar high-cross-section, long-
lived fission products levels off at about 1.1% Bk/k at high power. If
the flux is reduced to zero after high-power operation, the poisoning
effect increases, because of short-lived precursor decay, by 0.1% ak/k.
The poisoning decreases by the same amount when the power is again raised.

0

65

The last item in Table 3.4 (burnup) is the reactivity change due to
this cause between normal fuel additions.

Any of the control rods can be used as a servo-driven regulating rod
while the other two are controlled manually. All three rods are used for
shimming and all can be used for shutdown. 1In order to provide the max-
imum shutdown margin, the uranium concentration of the fuel is limited to
barely that required for full-power full-poison operation with all rods
at the upper limits of their operating ranges. At the upper limits, which
are set to avoid the low sensitivities at extreme withdrawal, the rod
poison amounts to about 0.5% 8k/k. The useful worth of the rods, from
full insertion to the upper end of their operating ranges, 1s therefore
less (by 0.5% ®k/k) than the total worth (Table 3.3). The minimum shut-
down margin provided by the rods is the difference between the useful
worth of the rods and the shim requirements {(Table 3.4). Minimum shut-
down margins for fuels A, B, and C are 3.7, 5.2, and 3.8% 8k/k respectively.
These margins are equivalent to reductions in critical temperatures of 580,
530, and 5%0°F respectively.

A typical program of rod positions during an operating cycle 1is shown
in Table 3.5. While the core is being filled, the rods are partially
withdrawn to provide rapid shutdown if abnormal conditions should appear.
The rods are fully inserted before the pump 1s started so that no 'cold-
slug" accident could make the reactor critical. As the reactor is operated
at power, the two manually controlled shim rods are kept well above the
regulating rod to avoid a reduction in the sensitivity of the regulating
rod by '"shadowing' by the other two rods.

Inherent Neutron Sources

The MSRE fuel salt will always contain an inherent source of neutrons.
Alpha particles from the uranium interact with the beryllium and fluorine
to produce neutrons, and there is also a contribution from spontaneous
fission. After high-power operation the inherent source will be much
stronger because of photoneutrons from the beryllium, produced by the
fission product gamma rays.

Predicted source strengths are given in Table 3.6. The spontaneous
fission source is mostly from UZ3® while the U®®% alphas are responsible
for nearly all the g-n source.® Thus these sources differ for each fuel.
The photoneutron neutron source depends on the fission product activity -
and the amount of beryllium in the core, which is about the same for each
fuel.

The presence of the strong internal source contributes materially to
the nuclear safety.® -

Biological Shielding

A review of the MSRE biological shielding design was completed.
Special attention was given to irregularities in the annular shield
around the reactor cell, and it was found that several areas will re-
quire additional local shielding. Most of this is required to lower the
radiation level in the blower house, where the dose rate during 10-Mw
i»

67

operation would be ~140 mrems/hr with no additional shielding. Stacked
concrete block can be placed conveniently to eliminate the contribution
from the reactor cell, but levels in the blower house during 10-Mw oper-
ation will range up to about 30 mr/hr from the coolant salt in the radi-
ator and piping. A block wall can be added around the blower house if
necessary.

The solid portion of the overhead shield will limit the dose rate to
less than 2.5 mrems/hr except directly over the core, where the estimated
dose rate will be 16 mrems/hr. Much higher dose rates could exist over
points where gaps between blocks overlap. Polyethylene and steel strips
in the gaps and stacked concrete block can be used where needed to pre-
vent excessive radiation through the top shield.

Heat Exchanger Fabrication

)
MSRE Primary Heat Exchanger Brazing

After the tubes in the MSRE heat exchanger were welded to the tube-
sheet at the front face, they were brazed into the tubesheet to increase
the strength of the Jjoint and to reduce the probability of a leak. The
brazing was done at the Wall-Colmonoy Corporation by a methodt developed
for this purpose and tested on the sample heat exchanger.® Preplaced 82
wt % Au — 18 wt % Ni brazing alloy was used in ring form.

The tube bundle was sealed in an all-welded retort to minimize the
possibility of air leaks, and the system was evacuated and then purged with
dry hydrogen (-80 to —85°F dewpoint) at a rate of 145 cfh. The use of a
large, gas-fired pit furnace enabled the entire unit to be heated to braz-
ing temperature, thus minimizing distortion due to differential thermal
expansion.

The brazing cycle was similar to that used on the sample heat ex-
changer. The temperature was raised at a rate of about 300°F/hr to a
thermal equalization temperature of 1650°F. After about 20 min the temper-
ature was again increased, and that at the tubesheet end of the heat ex-
changer was held between 1850 and 1885°F for 1 hr. A slow furnace cool at
a rate of about 300°F/hr was employed.

Visual inspection of the completed tube bundle showed that all com-
ponents were bright and all visible joints had good fillets (see Fig. 4.1).
After the tube bundle was welded into its shell, both a helium~leak test
and an 800-psi hydrostatic test were conducted. No leakage was found.

Ultrasonic Inspection of Tube Joint Brazing

The %15 tube-to-tubesheet joints in the MSRE heat exchanger were tested
ultrasonically for unbonded areas using the Lamb-wave technigue and mechani-
cal devices described previously,3 and the heat exchanger was found accepta-
ble for the MSRE. A number of these Jjoints contained areas which gave indi-
cations comparable to, or larger than, the signal from a reference 5/52-in.—
diam flat-bottomed hole. Although some of these indications covered ex-
tensive areas of the joints, analysis of the amplitudes indicated that the
signals were not large, continuous voids but possibly were due to groups of
small discontinuities.

Since indications of this type and size had not been observed in the
earlier work, there was no metallographic reference to which they could be
compared. An attempt is being made to establish such a reference by braz-
ing joints with discontinuities of approximately the right size. This
reference should allow a better interpretation of the data and of the braze
condition in the heat exchanger.

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

Thermal Fatigue

The thermal-fatigue characteristics of INOR-8 have been determined
from the conventional Coffin-type test. The low-cycle-fatigue equation
can be used to describe the plastic-strain — fatigue relation:

AepN =K . (1)

For INOR-8 the constants a and K were evaluated as 0.88 and 0.52 respective-
ly. Thermal-fatigue data for this alloy reported earlier® were in error.
The correct data are shown in Fig. 4.2.

It has been common practice to assume that the value of a is constant,
being 0.5 for all materials. Recent results of tensile tests at elevated
temperature and the thermal-fatigue results show a to be related to the
strain-hardening exponent n or,

a = 1 3 ’ (2)

where n is determined from the stress-strain relation. The thermal-fatigue
characteristics show good agreement with the isothermal-fatigue data avail-
able on the alloy. Tests results at maximum temperatures of 1300 and 1600°F
show no appreciable difference in the Ae_ or N_ relation. Hold times of up
to 40 min at the maximum temperature shoW some beneficial effect on the
plastic-strain — fatigue behavior. Relaxation of elastic stress did occur
during the hold time, and the plastic-strain value per cycle was therefore
increased. As predicted by Eq. 1, the number of cycles was reduced by the
increased plastic-strain range.

Equation 1 does not consider the manner in which the plastic strain
is produced. Thus, the time-dependent effects cannot be shown by this
equation. A significant part of the plastic strain may result from relax-
ation; therefore, the thermal-fatigue merit of a material cannot be based
solely on the evaluation of the constants of Eg. 1. In order to coampare
the thermal-fatigue behavior of INOR-8 to that of other common reactor ma-
terials, the rapid-thermal-cycling conditions were selected.

The range of temperature cycles to failure for INOR, Inconel, and type
304 stainless steel is shown in Fig. 4.3. INOR-8 is shown to be superior
to both the other materials by a substantial amount. These tests were per-
formed under similar conditions; the specimen geometry, testing machine,
cycle time, environment, and maximum temperature for all tests were nearly
identical. When hold time is added at the maximum temperature, the curves
are displaced to the left. ILimited data on INOR-8 indicate a displacement
of approximately one log cycle for a 40-min hold time at 1300°F. Data
showing hold-time effects were not available for all the materials.

Postirradiation Tensile Testing

A program was initiated to examine the postirradiation tensile proper-
ties of INOR-8. Subsize tensile specimens which were 0.125 in. in diameter
over a gage length of 1.125 in. were prepared from INOR-8 heat 5081. These
specimens were annealed at 2150°F for 15 min and were quenched rapidly in
argon to simulate the condition of the INOR-8 in the MSRE.

Twenty specimens will be irradiated in ORR Experiment 109 at the
temperature range 1100 to 1400°F and a dose of about 7 x 10F° nvt (>1 Mev).
The postirradiation tensile testing will be conducted at room temperature
and within the irradiation temperature range. Both strength and ductility
of the irradiated specimen will be compared to similar properties of unir-
radiated control specimens.

Evaluation of MSRE Graphite

Graphite bars (grade CGB) selected from material produced for the MSRE
moderator are being evaluated for compliance with specifications and to
establish properties data useful to the MSRE. This testing is for the
purpose of establishing the general level of the property values and is
not part of the quality control called for in the specification. Most of
the tests were made on specimens from three graphite bars.

Chemical Composition and Oxygen Content

A composite sample from the three bars was analyzed for chemical puri-
ty. The results of the analyses and the values specified for the MSRE are
given in Table L4.1.

Table 4.1. Chemical Analysis of
Grade CGB Graphite

Specified Maximum Analyzed
(wt %) (wt %)
Ash 0.07 0.0005
Boron 0.0001 0.00008
Vanadium 0.01 0.0009
Sulfur 0.005 0.0005

A measure of the tenaciously held oxygen of grade CGB graphite was
determined by placing specimens in a closed system, evacuating the system
to <10™° torr at room temperature, and then measuring the STP volume of
carbon monoxide evolved from the graphite at 1800°C. The oxygen content
of three lots (eight specimens) was determined to be 6 cm® of CO (STP)/
100 cm® of graphite by this procedure. This was well under the maximum
of 30 cm® of CO (STP) /100 cm® of graphite permitted by the specification.
76

Thermal Cycling of Salt-Impregnated Graphite

Tests were continued® to determine if salt-filled cracks in CGB
graphite would be propagated by thermal cycling through a temperature
range that includes the melting point of the salt. In previous work>
impregnated specimens were not significantly altered by 100 cycles be-
tween 390 and 1300°F. Similar results were obtained on additional speci-
mens that were cycled to 1800°F. The volumetric expansion of salt on

heating from the liquidus temperature (930°F) to 1830°F is approximately
14%.

Test specimens at the higher temperature were impregnated with LiF-
BeFo-ThF,-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %) at 1300°F and 150 psi to an equiva-
lent graphite bulk volume of 0.1%. A radiographic inspection indicated
that the salt was primarily confined to the cracks in the graphite. BREach
impregnated specimen was subjected to a high temperature cycle having the
rate of rise summarized in Table 4.2.

Table 4.2. Rate of Temperature Rise for the Thermal Cycles
of Salt-Impregnated Graphite (Grade CGB)

Maximum Temperature (min)
) Specimen 1984 Specimen 198-5
590 0 0
1500 3.7 3.4
16830 36.0 £3.0

There were no detectable changes in the graphite specimens or their
cracks as a result of these high-temperature thermal cycles. They exceeded
the maximum temperature (1350°F) expected in the MSRE. The maximum pre-
heating rate® of the core in the MSRE is expected to be 54°F/hr. On this
basis the slowest of the high-temperature thermal cycles was more than 200
times faster in reaching 1300°F than the maximum preheating rate.

The results of the preceding tests indicate that thermal cycles of
the MSRE should not damage the graphite.

Irradiation Effects on Grade CGB Graphite

The effect of neutron irradiation on the mechanical and physical
properties of grade CGB graphite is being investigated. Fifty specimens
have been irradiated in the ORR to dose levels from 2 to 5 x 107° nvt
(E > 0.18 Mev). The irradiation temperatures of the specimens varied
with the flux and were from 700 to 1050°F. The effect of this irradiation
i

on the dimensional stability, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion,
fracture stress, fracture strain, and modulus of elasticity will be de-
termined.

The electrical resistivity of grade CGB graphite was determined at
27°C in the directions perpendicular to and parallel with the extrusion
direction (length) of the bar, on control specimens for the irradiation
test. The thermal-conductivity values were calculated from the electrical
resistivity’ and are compared with those originally estimated for the MSRE
graphite. The results are summarized below:

Perpendicular Parallel
Electrical resistivity (pohm-cm) 1256 644
Thermal conductivity
(Btu £t~% sec™t £t™2 °F~1)
Calculated 60 117
Original estimation L5 80

This comparison indicates that the thermal conductivity of the graphite
may be better than was originally expected and that the graphite is slightly
more anisotropic than was expected. Actual measurements on the irradiated
graphite will be necessary to determine its thermal conductivity as functions
of temperature and dosage.

Removal of Oxygen from Graphite With Molten Salts

The use of molten NaF-ZrF,-UF. (50-46-4 mole %) to remove oxygen from
a moderately permeable graphite, grade R-0025, was demonstrated under con-
ditions similar to those proposed for purging the MSRE. Work was concen-
trated on this salt because it appeared to be more effective than the
LiF-Bels-UF, or LiF-BeFs-ThF,-UF, salts for removing oxygen from graphite.®

In early work the ratio of the volume of the molten salt to the bulk
volume of a graphite crucible was 1:27, and the purging salt was allowed
to freeze in the crucible before it was removed. There was some scatter
in the results from duplicate tests, presumably due to incomplete removal
of the frozen salt and/or to the relatively small quantity used.

The proposed flush-salt operation of the MSRE differs from this method
in that the salt will be introduced and removed from the reactor in the
molten state; thus the ratio of the total volume of the molten salt to the
bulk volume of the graphite in the reactor will be 1:1. The larger guanti-
ty of salt and its removal in the molten state as proposed for the MSRE
offered more effective conditions for cleaning the graphite than did the
conditions of the early laboratory tests.
78

Approximate MSRE conditions were produced on a laboratory scale with
four crucibles of grade R-0025 graphite. 1In each test the graphite cruci-
ble was completely submerged in the salt for 500 hr at 1300°F. The 500-hr
period was chosen because this was the estimated time that the MSRE flush
salt would remain in the reactor.

The purged crucibles were then charged with the oxygen-sensitive
LiF-BeFs-UF, (62-37-1 mole %) salt in an inert atmosphere and held at
1300°F for 4000 hr. (This salt readily precipitates uranium dioxide in
the presence of oxygen.) Radiographic tests did not detect any uranium
oxide precipitate forming. Similar tests will be made with R-0025 and
CGB graphite and the proposed MSRE coolant (and purging) salt LiF-BeFs
(66-34 mole %) as soon as this salt is available. :

Sintering Characteristics of Gds03-Al1-505

A study was completed to develop procedures for fabricating thin-
walled cylinders of Gdz0Os that contain up to 30 wt % Al.05. These cylin-
ders are of interest as control rod elements for the MSRE, and their
composition was designed to withstand moisture in the atmosphere at temper-
atures up to 1400°F. The Al,05 was added to minimize hydrolysis and subse-
quent deterioration of the Gd,0s.

In preliminary work,® severe distortion resulted from heating cold-
pressed mechanical mixtures of T0% Gds0s5 — 30% AloOs to 1650°C, indicating
the formation of a low-temperature-melting compound, identified by x-ray
diffraction analysis as the primary perovskite-type phase GdAlO5. The
distortion was minimized by the use of prereacted powder;lo however, some
flairing of the ends of the cylinders still occurred owing to frictional
restraint during sintering.

A technique was investigated in which a pressed specimen of prereacted
material was supported on a similar, but shorter, "dummy" specimen so that
the frictional restraint was sustalned by the supporting member. By this
technique it was possible to sinter at temperatures up to 1645°C and to ob-
tain undistorted pieces with bulk densities of 5.1 to 5.2 g/em®. Densities
to 5.26 g/cm® were attained, with minor dimensional changes, by thermal
cycling the parts between 1635 and 1660°C; however, this technique is not
considered practical for making large quantities of the material.

A prereacted mixture of 80 wt % Gds0z — 20 wt % Al,05 was also investi-
gated using similar techniques, except that the mixture was reacted initial-
ly at 1750°C rather than at 1650°C. No deformation or tendency to weld was
observed in specimens sintered at temperatures as high as 1750°C for 1 hr.
An x-ray diffraction analysis of these materials revealed GdA105; perovskite
and an, as yet, unidentified phase.

The results of this work indicate that shapes of controlled size and
density can be fabricated by the use of standard cold-pressing and sinter-
ing techniques if prereacted powders are used. Distortion due to frictional
restraint of the shrinking parts during the sintering operation can be mini-
mized by the use of supporting members also made of prereacted powders.

5. RADIATION EFFECTS

Postirradiation Examination of Assembly ORNL-MTR-L7-U

The effects of the Fo evolved in frozen fuel in response to decay
energy have been further explored. No evidence has been found of Fs or
of significant amounts of CF, under operating conditions.

Xenon Recovery from Graphite Cores

Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4, which has been described previously,!™3
contained capsules of INOR-8 enclosing graphite and MSRE fuel. In four
of the capsules, l/2-in.—diam cylindrical cores of graphite (5 g) were
immersed in 25 g of MSRE-type fuel. After an exposure of about 107C nvt
in the MTR, the capsules were punctured, and the cover gas was collected
for analyses; much gaseous Fs was found. In conformance with results
from earlier irradiations, in which gaseous Fs must also have been pre-
sent, there was little if any of the expected xenon from fissioning.
This was attributed to the formation of solid compounds such as XeFp,
XelFsXeF,, and XeF,, which have relatively low vapor pressures.

After the graphite cores were removed from capsules 45 and 12 and
examined, they were stored in screw-cap plastic bottles for five months.
The necessary manipulations involved many hours of exposure to hot-cell
air. On removal from storage, the graphite was heated under vacuum, and
the evolved gases were collected for analysis by mass spectrometry. The
gas samples were taken following periods of at least 1 hr each at 600,
800, and 1000°C. In the case of capsule 45, the xenon released from the
graphite at the successive temperatures was 0.031, 0.025, and 0.055 cmS
(STP), totaling 0.111 em® or 7.5% of the calculated 1.5-cm® yield from
fissioning. A considerable amount of SiF, (~3 cm®) was also in the gas;
the source of the silicon, other than what might have come from the stain-
less steel vacuum tank and lines and from the glass manifold, is not
known. In the case of capsule 12, there was a small air leak during the
heating under vacuum; 0.065 cm® of xenon was recovered at 600°C along
with insignificant amounts at higher temperatures, which again amounted
to 7.5% of the calculated 0.87-cm® yield from fissioning in capsule 12.
This time the fluorine appeared as CFy (~0.4 em®), and little SiF, was
noted, in contrast with the behavior in the absence of an air leak.

The xenon fluorides should not have remained as such in the graphite
during the long exposure to air because of both their sublimation pres-
sure and their reactivity to form the nonvolatile XeOz. The XeOg molecule
has a dipole moment and should adsorb on graphite much more readily than
the symmetrical XeF,; however, the dipole moment of XeOsz is probably not
large because of the compensating effect of the unshared electrons on the
xenon atom at the apex of a triangular pyramid with three oxygens at the
base at Xe-O distances of 1.76 A and 0-Xe-0 angles of 103°. Oxygen that
might have resulted from decomposition of XeOz during the heating was
apparently converted to CO.

Graphite from an unirradiated control capsule was subjected to the
same procedure as the irradiated graphite, and the gas (~2 cm® total) was
predominantly hydrogen, along with other common constituents from the de-
gassing of graphite.

As recovered from the heating in stainless steel apparatus, the
graphite from capsule 45 was found to be coated with a silvery film re-
sembling in appearance some previously encountered surface deposits of
chromium.and/or iron carbides on graphite. In an attempt to identify
the film, the top of the graphite core was placed in a mounting as for
metallographic preparations and subjected to x-ray analysis. The x-ray
pattern resembled that for U0z, which led to the conclusion that the film
had been inadvertently removed and that the x-ray pattern resulted from
the presence of uranium in the surface graphite beneath the film. The
occurrence of uranium in the graphite was confirmed by chemical analyses
described below.

Nonvolatile Constituents in Graphite Cores

Because of the repeated cycling through strongly oxidizing and re-
ducing cycles as a consequence of Fo generation during reactor shutdowns,
the contents of capsules from assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4 had an uncertain
environmental history. As a check on possible alterations, chemical
analyses were made of the graphite cores from three irradiated capsules
and a control capsule. Large pieces, 0.8 g or larger, in which the
surface~to-mass ratio was similar to that of the original, were dis-
solved in a boiling mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. The uranium
was analyzed by a fluorometric method; the other constituents were ana-
lyzed by emission spectra except for lithium, which was analyzed by
flame photometry.

The analyses presented in Table 5.1 show increasing uranium contents
with capsule power, which in turn correlates with the intensity of the
off-equilibrium cycles associated with shutdowns. The unirradiated sample,
which had been exposed to a thermal history the same as that of the ir-
radiated samples, did not absorb any appreciable amounts of uranium or
. lithium. Graphite from capsules 12, 45, and 3A was subjected to bakeout
of gases at 1000°C, which may have caused changes in the constituents
analyzed, and graphite from capsule 36 was not analyzed because it was
involved in an attempt to recover fuel by melting. On a per atom basis,
there is more lithium than uranium in the graphite cores, while the other
ma jor constituents of the fuel are virtually absent.

Speculations regarding the mechanism by which uranium occurred in
the graphite have dealt mainly with two possibilities: (1) Transport of
Ufg seemed possible as a consequence of the Fo atmosphere, but graphite
alone was not regarded an adequate reducing agent for fixation of UFg
in the cores. (2) Strongly reduced salt was probably in brief contact
with the graphite during startup periods before the released Fy could be
re-equilibrated into the melt. Autoradiography of metallographically
mounted cross sections of graphite revealed that the radiocactivity in
the cores was highly concentrated in a narrow band at the surface.

Since much of the fission product activity from any uranium in the gra-
phite would have remained embedded in the vicinity of the uranium, the
autoradiographs could tentatively be construed to mean that uranium, if
present in graphite during exposure, was largely confined to the outer

L mm of the cores rather than distributed throughout. Further trials
with autoradiography before and after neutron activation are in progress.

Fission Product Activities in Graphite Exposed to Fissioning Fuel.
Analyses by gamma spectrometry of the fission product activities of Ce,
Cs, Ru, and Zr found in the graphite were of interest for comparisons of
the calculated burnup of the uranium in the graphite with that in the
fuel. The conversion of activity to apparent percent burnup, shown in
Table 5.2, gave considerable scatter, much of which was due to transport
of the fission species after formation. Cesium activity may have entered
the pores of the graphite as xenon gas, and ruthenium activity may have
been reduced from the salt phase and deposited on the graphite. The
zirconium activity was unreliable because of the low activity level at
the time of analysis. Cerium activity showed a rather low but constant
value and was probably the most reliable index; the implication was that
the averaged fraction of the exposure undergone by uranium in the gra-
phite was one-third to one-sixth that for the fuel or that most of the
uranium found in the graphite had been there only during the later ex-
posure cycles in the MIR.

Effect of Irradiation in Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-5

Production of CF, Under Operating Conditions

As described earlier,%’5 two of the capsules (0.67 and 0.34 mole %
UF, fuel respectively) in irradiated assembly ORNL-MTR-47-5 were like
those in the previous irradiation experiment, except that they were pro-
vided with gas sampling lines through which capsule gas was swept into
evacuated, 250-ml collection cylinders after having accumulated in the
capsule under a nominally static helium pressure (12 psia). Conditions
during the accumulation periods ranged from ambient temperature, during
shutdowns, to temperatures of 815°C at fission-power densities of 85
w/em® in LiF-BeFo-ZrF,-UF, (~67-28-4-0.67 mole %).
84

Of the 61 samples collected, 33 were obtained from fissioning molten
fuel, and of these about 14 from the 0.67 mole % UF, fuel and 15 from the
0.34 mole % fuel appeared to be useful.  In the digest of results at
operating temperatures presented in this section, four samples have been
neglected; although three of these contained measurable amounts of CF,,
their history and analyses involved irregularities that were not clearly
resolvable.

The varying radioactivity of the samples, which in many cases neces-
sitated several transfers before introduction of marginally small amounts
into the mass spectrometer, led to considerable variation in the sensi-
tivity of analyses. An estimated approximate lower limit for measurement
of about 5 ppm of CF, had been considered feasible on the basis of
calibration trials with the collection apparatus. Most of the samples
were analyzed for Fp at K-25 and twice again for CF, and other consti-
tuents by different mass spectrometry laboratories (ORNL and Y-12).
Noticeably greater sensitivity of measurement was attained on the later
reanalyses, where radiocactivity was longer a problem; in general, the
Jlatest figures were adopted as most representative, although again there
were large fluctuations from sample to sample in the amount that could
have been present (below the limit of detection) in the 18 samples that
gave negative results.

Partly because the amounts of CF, produced were generally too low
to measure accurately, there was much scatter in the results on any of
the bases on which correlations were attempted. The most enlightening
information was obtained from plots such as Figs. 5.1 and 5.2, wherein

the amount of xenon (long lived) in a sample served as an internal dosi-
meter and measured the exposure in terms of the relative amounts of
fission energy that were released while the samples accumulated. The
amounts of CF, in a sample were presented as ratios of CF, to xenon in
the same sample for the following reasons: (1) the primary generation
of CF4 1s probably strongly influenced by the energy, as is of course
certainly true of xenon; (2) comparison of mass spectrometric peaks on
the same sample eliminates many possible discrepancies that might stem
from unrecognized differences in sampling; and (5) also a convenient
reference factor is available for assessing the chemical effects on fuels
of any given loss of fluoride as CF,. The excess of fluoride ions aris-
ing from fissioning UF,, because the fission product cation valences for
equilibrium with the container do not accommodate the available anions
from the fissioned UF,, gives a small increase in oxidizing power of the
fuel with increasing burnup. Ordinarily, this oxidation should in prin-
ciple be manifested as a relatively insignificant increase in corrosion
product concentration. However, if the moles of CF, evolved from a fuel
were approximately equal to the gram atoms of stable xenon produced during
the same interval, the oxidation-reduction level would tend to remain
favorably balanced. The exact ratio for balance varies with conditions
of operation but for purposes of estimation can be considered as unity
or a little higher. Thus, the cross-hatched bands at the top of Figs.
5.1 and 5.2 denote the upper limit of the CF4/Xe ratios below which the
removal of CF, is a corrosion problem of negligible proportions for the
MSRE. For higher rates of fluoride removal, that could conceivably re-
quire occasional re-treatment of the fuel with HF, a chemical margin of
tolerance (due to the approach to sufficient reduction to deposit uranium)
-would be encountered only after an appreciable reduction of UF, to Ufs.

Estimated limits of sensitivity for each of the samples that gave
negative results have been plotted as filled circles in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2
for use as upper limits. The shaded area shows the locus of points cor-
responding to about 5 ppm CF,, and the open circles correspond to samples
for which definite CF, contents were found. Taking into account both
positive and negative samples, if CF, were present in amounts proportional
to xenon production, the quantity was too small to be measured with cer-
tainty. On the other hand, there was a possibility that CF, underwent
decomposition and/or reaction with the wall because of the radiation
field in the capsule; thus the amount present in samples collected over
long periods could represent a steady state between formation and dis-
appearance. The straight dashed lines in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2 represent
trial extrapolations to zero time, effectively at least, and thus show a
possible relative primary rate of generation of CF, compared to xenon in
the vapor space in the capsule. In principle, a curve for CF, concen-
tration should pass through all open circles and beneath all filled ones;
but, because of the scatter of the data, the curves remained indeterminate.
However, the trial values obtained from the dashed extrapolations were
considered representative of the rate of production of CF, that could have
prevailed. Thus the conclusion would be reached that CF, was produced in
the vapor space at about 6% of the rate of xenon and that a steady-state
concentration at, or just under, 5 ppm CF, was approached. A simple basis,
though not a rigorous or necessarily correct one, for scaling such results
from capsules to a reactor could be the assumption that for a given power
density in the fuel the CF, production was proportional to the area of
the interface between graphite and fuel. Then, since xenon production
varies with the fuel volume in the core and the MSRE core contains 7 x
10° em® of fuel in contact with about 10® cm® of graphite, compared to
the capsules with 10 cm® of fuel in contact with 12 cm® of graphite, the
scaling factor would be

10° cm® . 10 cm> ,
12 em? 7 x 10° em®

or roughly unity. Thus to the extent that the assﬁmptions involved in the
foregoing consideration are justified, the loss of CF, from the MSRE is
not expected to cause difficulty.

Postirradiation Examination of Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-5

Fluorine Generation from Decay Energy

After 2000 hr of irradiation in the MIR at an average thermal-neutron
flux of 2 x 10'° neutrons cm™@ sec”!, the 47-5 experiment was withdrawn,
and valves were attached to the gas sweep lines in preparation for ship-
ment. Within 11-1/2 days after termination of the exposure, the assembly
was installed in an ORNL hot cell with pressure-measuring devices attached
to both gas-swept capsules. A gas sample withdrawn from the low-power
capsule (0.34 mole % UF,) contained 38% He and 55% Fo by mass spectrome-
tric analysis. It also contained large amounts of tellurium and iodine
activities (4O r/hr at contact through a nickel wall). The high-power

87

capsule (0.67 mole % UF,) was not sampled because of the activity problem.
Both capsules were then evacuated, and pressure-rise measurements were
begun (Figs. 5.3 to 5.6). (as samples were taken frequently to check the

purity of the evolved fluorine and to substantiate the absence of air
leaks into the capsules. Farly samples contained as much as HO% Os, from
reaction of Fo with oxides on the system walls. Later samples reached Fp
purities of 96.7%.

After measurement of the room-temperature fluorine evolution rates,
the variation of rate with capsule temperature was studied. Rates were
measured at 50, 86, minus 70, and 2°C, with intermittent room-temperature
determinations to provide a normal for comparison. The data for the first
95 days are shown in Fig. 5.3, together with a calculated fluorine-
generation curve based on a G value of 0.04% molecule of Fo per 100 ev of
fission product decay energy (calorimetrically determined data® for decay
power were used, since energy absorbed in the fuel was needed). 1In Fig.
5.4, the same data on fluorine liberation are represented in integral form,
and as indicated by the points near the origin, there were losses of Fp
from the capsules during shutdowns between reactor cycles; these losses
were equivalent to increments of chemical reduction of the fuel. The ac-
cumulated effects, shown in terms of the extent of expected reduction of
UF, to UFg in Table 5.3, caused the fuel (rather early in its history) to
be reduced to the point that some disproportionation of UFgs could have
been expected; appreciable deposition of uranium, particularly in the cap-
sule with higher power density, must have occurred before the exposure
was terminated.

Further evolution of Fs after termination led to cumulative losses,
in terms of the total fluoride content of the fuel, of 2 and 4% for the
low- and high-power capsules respectively (nominal experimental design
powers were 35 and 65 w/cm®).

For the first 50 days the capsﬁle pressures ranged to 1 atm but were
decreased to zero at each sampling. Pressures less than 1 psia prevailed
between day 50 and day 114,

Some of the more significant conclusions to be drawn from Figs. 5.3
and 5.4 are as follows:

1. Fluorine evolution rates showed a broad maximum between O and
50°C, with a peak near 35°C or higher, which shifted slightly
with time. . '

2. At -70°C, the rates decreased to low values (0.67 mole % UF,)
or zero (0.34% mole % UF.).

5. At 85°C, the net rates in both capsules dropped to zero,
rapidly for the highly reduced salt but slowly for the less
reduced salt.

i, The F» production rates initially matched a G value of 0.Ok.
Subsequent G values decreased to 0.02.

5. In most cases, when the capsule temperature was abruptly
raised, a burst of fluorine was noted. Conversely, after a
sudden drop in capsule temperature to room temperature,
several days were required for recovery to a steady rate.

6. Fluorine evolution rates were much less strongly influenced
by the degree of reduction of the fuel salt than by the tem-
perature; the chemical reduction indicated in Fig. 5.4 would
have, in molten fuel, caused violent chemical changes such as
the precipitation of all of the uranium and some of the other
cations as metals.

7. At 87°C an actual consumption of fluorine (negative genera-
tion rate) was noted in the 0.67 mole % UF, fuel. The more
highly reduced state of this salt might account for its
greater tendency to recombine with fluorine.

In order to explore further the nature of the recombination of fluo-
rine with reduced salt at elevated temperatures, several additional
variations were made in fluorine pressure as well as capsule temperature.
Fluorine pressures from a fraction of 1 psia to 1 atm and capsule tem-
peratures from 33% to 88°C were studied. A final test was run to determine
whether the radiolysis of CF, at 1 atm of pressure by 150-day-cooled fuel
salt might be detectable.

The results from these variations in capsule conditions are presented
in rate form in Fig. 5.5 and as cumulative fluoride loss or gain by the
fuel salt in Fig. 5.6. Also given in Fig. 5.6 is a plot of the Fz pres-
sure in the 0.67 mole % UF, capsule on the same time scale. Similar but
not identical pressures obtained in the 0.34 mole % UF,4 capsule at any
given time,

The following detailed description explains in part some of the pecu-
liarities and complications in Fig. 5.5. Both capsules were evacuated
after the 87°C interval that ended on day 95, and fluorine evolution with
no added pressure was followed for 15 days at 33°C to furnish a "base
line". The observations under these conditions were extended over 15 days
because the evolution rate continued to rise slowly, in line with pre-
vious observations that room-temperature rates were not immediately re-
covered ‘after the salt had been heated. On heating to 83°C, the 0.67
mole % UF, salt rapidly consumed the generated Fp, the pressure falling
from 0,39 psia to 0.07 psia. In the same interval the generation rate in
the 0.34 mole % UF, capsule slowly dropped to zero, confirming previous
behavior. On day 113, the temperature was raised to 88°C, the capsules
were evacuated, and 1 psia of fresh Fy was added to each. The initial
consumption rate in the 0.67 mole % UF, capsule with higher reduction
more than doubled its value for 0.3 psia and then decreased. Fluorine
was again added to 1 psia, and the consumption rate nearly reproduced the
previous gyration. At 1 psia and 88°C, the 0.34k mole % UF, salt slowly
consumed Fo.

The capsules were sampled and evacuated, and 0.5 atm of Fy was added
to each. The more concentrated fuel consumed Fo at approximately twice
the l-psia rate for three days, then less rapidly as the Fp pressure de-
creaged to 0.25 atm. A similar doubling of its 1l-psia rate occurred in
the other capsule. -
92

-

The capsules were again sampled and evacuated, and a full atmosphere
of Fo was added to each. Again the consumption rate in the concentrated
fuel did not quite reach the previous maximum rate at 0.5 atm Fo, possibly
because salt accessible to Fo had become partially saturated. A similar
rate decrease was noted in the other capsule.

On day 122, the assembly temperature was reduced to 3H°C, leaving
slightly less than 1 atm of Fp in each capsule. In both capsules, fluo-
rine generation was rather quickly resumed at rates similar to the initial
base-~line rates. Curiously, there was now little if any change in rate
in 12 days of continued evolution; otherwise, the addition of F +to the
fluoride-deficient salt apparently had not enhanced subsequent Fo liber-
ation. In fact, the slightly lower rates could perhaps have been consid-
ered indicative of slight back-reaction at 1 atm of Fo at 34°C.

With the Fy pressure maintained near 1 atm, the capsule temperature
was raised to 54°C. The 0.67 mole % UF, capsule began to consume Fo
slowly. The other capsule exhibited the small burst of Fo often observed
after temperature rises, followed by a decrease of generation rate. When
the temperature was raised to T74°C, the 0.34 mole % UF, salt showed ano-
ther small Fo burst and then leveled at a low positive generation rate.
The 0.67 mole % UF, salt consumed Fo at a moderate rate at 74°C, showing
an erratic rate behavior; such irregular behavior is common in gas-solid
reactions involving successive formation and rupture of partially protec-
tive films. Finally, when the temperature was again raised to 88°C, the
consumption rate for the more-reduced salt increased to a value only one-
fourth its previous value at 88°C and 1 atm Fo and then fell off strongly.
This is again suggestive of saturation of the outer surfaces of the fuel
salt by Fn. At 88°C, the 0.34 mole % UF, salt gave off another slow Fo
burst that lasted more than two days before consumption dominated. It
appeared that the 0.34 mole % UF, capsule was more prone to such bursts
~at 1 atm of Fo overpressure than at 1 psia overpressure.

The capsules were again sampled, evacuated, and cooled to 38°C. An
atmosphere of CF, was added to both capsules and allowed to remain for
four days. The apparent negative rates for both capsules for the first
day were probably due to a slight drop in capsule temperature, causing a
pressure drop. (The measured pressure drops were only 0.0% and 0.05 psia
out of a total pressure of 1Lk.7 psia.) For the remaining three days,
approximately normal generation rates were observed. Analyses of the CF,
before and after radiolysis were identical except for the expected small
Fo concentration from salt radiolysis. After evacuation of the CF, from
both capsules, the observed Fo generation rates were about the same as
with CF, present.

The main conclusions of the behavior demonstrated in Figs. 5.5 and
5.6 may be summarized as follows:

1. MSRE salt, chemically reduced to the extent correspbnding to 3.5
to 4% fluorine loss, reacted with fluorine at a rate which was
very low at room temperature, easily measurable at 54°C, and
93

rapidly increasing as the temperature exceeded 88°C. With salt
reduced only to 2% fluorine loss, the recombination was measur-
able only above 88°C.

2. Continued reaction of fluorine with the strongly reduced salt
resulted in a very marked decrease of consumption rate before
even 0.5% of its 4% fluorine deficit had been restored. With
the other salt, a similar deceleration was noted.

3. In extrapolating the above conclusions, temperatures well above
100°C would probably be required in order to restore radiolyzed
MSRE salt to its original oxidation state by fluorination. In
the case of the sealed in-pile capsules in recent MSRE irradia-
tion tests, the probability is thus enhanced that some of the
Fo generated during reactor shutdowns could have survived to
elevated temperatures at startups; meanwhile reduced components
of the fuel could have reacted with the graphite.

b, For reasons implicit in the foregoing discussion, exact rela-
tions between Fo pressure and recombination rates are not
derivable from the available data. Qualitatively, however,
the initial reaction rate of fluorine with a highly reduced
fuel was approximately proportional to fluorine pressure. As
reaction continued, the reaction order fell to 0.5 and less.

5. Radiolysis of CF, was not detectable in the presence of irra-
diated fuel salt. The salt had cooled 150 days at the time of
testing, and the high-power capsule should have been generating
beta activity at the rate of 0.1 w.

Conclusions Pertaining to Reactor Operation. Fluorine generation 1s
expected to be negligibly slow from solid MSRE fuel salt which had been
fissioning at 65 w/cm®, provided its temperature is maintained above, e.g.,
200°C. The possibility of Fo release from molten fuel is even more re-
mote, in view of the higher temperature and improved kinetics for fluorine
back-reaction in the liquid state.

Mechanism of Salt Radiolysis. The fluorine generation and consump-
tion data discussed above are consistent with the following kinetic pic-
ture of salt radiolysis.

The net fluorine liberation rate depends on the balance of at least
three effects: (1) the primary radiolytic generation rate, which is
probably temperature independent; (2) chemical recombination of fluorine
iniide the crystals with the reduced radiolytic species, e.g., Li-, Beo,
U®", and U°; and (3) a temperature-dependent diffusion step for escape of
internal F° or Fo from the crystal. At low temperatures the slowing of
diffusion would decrease net Fo liberation, perhaps simultaneously build-
ing up higher internal pressures of Fo which give rise to bursts of re-
leased gas when the salt is warmed. At high temperatures, accelerated
O

recombination of Fso with reduced products would result in the observed
zero or negative formation rates. Schematically, this results in an
overall pattern like that in Fig. 5.7; but, because the onset of the re-
combination reaction depends on the condition of the fuel and the pre-
sence of Fo, the temperature scale in Fig. 5.7 should be viewed as merely
illustrative.

OQut-of-Pile Irradiations of Solid MSRE Salts

’

Gamma, Irradiations

The production of fluorine-containing gases in reactor-irradiated
MSRE fuel-salt compatibility tests raised the question of whether such
behavior arose from the effect of radiation (possibly'internal) on the
solid salt. One phase of the experiments exploring this problem con-
sisted in exposing such a fuel salt, otherwise unirradiated but in con-
tact with graphite, to gamma irradiation in the 10,000-curie Co®° facility
of the ORNL Chemical Technology Division.
95

A 25-ml INOR-8 container holding 35.3 g of salt (14.1 ml) and 2L-1/L-
in. graphite spheres (3.1 ml) was exposed in the facility for 1870 hr at
temperatures of 35 to 67°C. Composition of the salt was as follows:

LiF (nat) 69.2 mole % H50 <250 ppm
BeFs 2%.0 mole % Oxygen 305 ppm
ZrFy 5.2 mole % Nitrogen 61 ppm
UF, (nat) 1.1 mole % Sulfur 32 ppm
ThF, 1.7 mole % Chromium 8 ppm

Iron 130 ppm

The 35.3 g of salt contained 0.76 g-atom of cations and 1.12 g-atoms
of fluoride ions.

The container was equipped with gas tubing and valves, pressure-
measuring instruments, and a sampling tank assembly to obtain gas samples;
the complete apparatus involved in pressure measurement and gas collection
was prefluorinated by K-25 Plant personnel. After the salt was loaded
around the graphite, melted and refrozen in a glove box under a dry inert
atmosphere, the 1id was welded in place, and the assembly was flushed and
filled with purified helium at a pressure slightly above atmospheric.

Dose rates to the salt were calculated from previous calibratioms,
with due consideration of the attenuation resulting from the materials
and geometry involved. The center-line dose rate was estimated to be 0.76
x 1018 ev g™t min"t.

Thus, for fluorine production corresponding to a pressure increase
of a given number of pounds per square inch per hour, Gp, = 7.5 X (psi/hr)
= molecules of Fs per 100 ev. -

The salt was exposed in the Co8® facility at ambient temperature
(50 to 60°C). For about 600 hr no significant variation (<0.3 psi) in
gas pressure was observed (GF2 = 0). After this time pressure began to
rise at a mildly accelerating rate. At hour 1343 the pressure had risen
from 16.7 to 18.7 psi (GF, = 0.02). The temperature was lowered to 35°C
and held there until hour 1724. The pressure changed during this pericd
from 18.4 to 20.4 psi (G, = 0.0k). The salt temperature was then held
at 67°C {ambient) until hour 1870. The pressure changed during this
period from 21.2 to 23%.0 psi.

A small, sharp increase in pressure was noted for a few hours after
the temperature increase to 67°C at hour 1724; similar pressure bursts
were encountered with reactor-irradiated capsules followiﬁg temperature
increases during the decay period. The steady-state G value for the sub-
sequent period was gbout 0.06.

At hour 1870, the pressure-monitoring manifold was connected to the
sampling system, which included four 60-ml collection tanks. The gas
volume of the irradiated container and manifold was 30.6 ml.
96

Successive samples were removed into the tanks, with helium being
admitted to the manifold after withdrawal of the first two samples.

The samples, as analyzed on a K-25 Plant mass spectrometer, gave the
following results (helium and air components not included):

Gas std cm® (total)
F» 1L k2
Excess 0o 1.41%
SiF, 0.02
CF4 0.26
COF2 0.03
COz 0.39

"Not including estimated 0.6 to 1.0 std em® involved in second
sample removal, which had some air leakage.

There were no other gases found except air components in proper
proportions.

It is possible that the CF, and COFo came from COso or other organic
contamination during sampling or analysis. The equilibria of the fol-
lowing reactions are strongly to the right.

Fo + COz » COFs + 1/205
Fs + COFs = CF4 + 1/202

The other possibility is that the CF, was produced by the reaction of
fluorine with the irradiated graphite, although in the absence of ir-
radiation no measurable reaction would have been expected.

The increases in pressure due to the evolution of Fo are consistent
with the observation of radiation damage to LiF and other alkali halides,
as summarized by Billington and Crawford.’ Displacement of fluorine
atoms by any of various forms of radiation ultimately leads to escape of
fluorine atoms or molecules from the crystal. Since return to the va-
cancies in the solid lattice is probably an extremely slow process for
molecular fluorine, the accumulation of a substantial fluorine pressure
after an induction period would not be unlikely. Similar effects have
evidently been encountered in the reactor-irradiated salts due to fission
product activity during the decay period.

The autoclave has been repressurized with helium and is being ir-
radiated to further explore the effect of temperature.

X-Ray Irradiations

Fuel-salt mixtures and individual component fluorides were irradiated
with x rays using two types of x-ray units (GE 250 kvp, 30 ma, and Muller
97

250 kv, 3 kva). All experiments were made with the maximum input to the
machines at 250 kvp (GE) or 250 kv (Muller). In spite of the use of
direct current in the Muller unit, dosimetry indicated an absorbed dose
rate of only 0.3 relative to that for the GE unit.

Irradiation vessels were fabricated from nickel with diaphragms of
0.010 or 0.020 in. of nickel to allow passage of the maximum amount of
energy into the salt. The inside surfaces were well fluorinated at 150°C
before introduction of the salt. The salts were handled only in a helium
dry box and were recrystallized by melting in nickel crucibles in order to
keep the carbon content as low as possible. Generally, a 75- to 100-g
sample of salt was sufficient to form a layer about 0.75 in. deep over the
area of the x-ray beam.

Dosimetry measurements were made with ferrous sulfate. The dosimeter
solution (5.5 liters) was placed just below the irradiation vessel in a
container with a solution depth of 8 in. (large enough to intercept the
total beam). The amounts of energy absorbed by the test salts were de-
termined by the difference between that energy passing through an empty
vessel and that passing through the vessel containing the sample. This
dosimeter is satisfactory for use with photon energies as low as 50 kv.
However, the depth of solution was insufficient to stop all the high-
energy X rays. Calculations showed that the error in energy absorbed by
the salt due to solution depth is insignificant.

The fuel salt used in these experiments contained LiF-BeFs~ZrF,-
ThF,-UF, (70-23-5-1-mole %). Two irradiation experiments were carried
out with this salt in helium at 1 atm using the GE machine. A 100-g

sample absorbed energy at the rate of 5 x 10*® ev/min; but, owing to
difficulties with the machine, it was not possible to irradiate for long
periods of time. The first experiment (135 min, 6.6 x 107 ev absorbed)
resulted in liberation of 267 ppm COFs and 174 ppm CF4 in 2L ml of helium,
as determined by mass spectrometry, and indicated a G value of 0.006 mole-
cule of Fo liberated per 100 ev of energy absorbed. A second irradiation
of the same salt (425 min, 1.7 x 10°% ev absorbed) resulted in liberation
of the same compounds, but with a G value of 0.009. In the first experi-
ment the CF4/COF2 ratio was 1.3, while in the latter it was 2.0. The
yield of Fs used for calculating G values was the total found in the CI4
and other compounds of fluorine. There were no significant differences
between the irradiated and as-received salt as determined by carbon and
oxygen analyses, x-ray diffraction, and microscopic examination. 1In both
cases the oxygen content was ~200 ppm and the carbon content was <500 ppm.

Further irradiations were carried out on another sample of the same
fuel-salt mixture with the Muller machine. With an input to the tube of
250 kv at 12 ma, the dose absorbed by the fuel salt was about 1.3 x 102
ev/min for a 110-g sample. The salt was loaded into the fluorinated
vessel in a helium dry box and was treated with Fo at 150°C until the
consumption rate was low. During this fluorination, appreciable amounts
of CF4, COFs, and SiF, were detected. After the fluorination the vessel
was thoroughly purged with helium and left with 1 psig of helium over-
night before analysis. Mass spectrometer analysis of the internal gas
showed no trace of Fp, CF4, or COFs.
98

The salt was irradiated for 22 hr (1.6 x 10?2 ev absorbed) in helium
at 1 atm. Gas analysis showed 280 ppm F» and 230 ppm CF,, with only
traces of COFp and S5iF4, in 20 ml of helium. The G value from these data
was 0.002. Irradiation of the same salt for an additional 44 hr (3.3 x
10°% ev absorbed) gave similar results, with a G value of 0.00k. ‘

The .vessel containing the above salt was heated for 16 hr at 250°C
at a pressure of 3 to 4 p to remove any adsorbed gases. Two subsequent
irradiations (51 hr, 4 x 10%% ev; 93 hr, 7 x 10°% ev) yielded no Fs but
did yleld appreciable quantities of CF, and COF-. The calculated G
values were 0.001l3 and 0.002 respectively. Analysis of the salt after
removal from the vessel indicated an oxygen content of about 1800 ppm.
If this resulted from in-leakage of air during the heating, it could ex-
plain the failure to detect Fo in the gas after irradiation.

A 75-g sample of ZrF, was irradiated on the Muller unit (250 kv,
12 ma) for a total of 269 hr (1.4 x 10%® ev absorbed) without evidence of
fluorine evolution. This sample of salt, in its irradiation vessel, was
thoroughly fluorinated to remove any carbon, sulfur, or silicon impurities
and to convert metal oxides to fluorides after the above exposure. It was
then irradiated for 65 hr (3.4 x 10°% ev absorbed) without detectable
radiolysis.

A 50-g sample of LiF was irradiated for 333 hr under similar condi-
tions. Owing to the low mass absorption coefficient of LiF, this exposure
resulted in absorption of 3 x 10°% ev. Gas analysis failed to detect
liberation of fluorine or gaseous fluorine compounds in the helium cover

gas. This LiF was fluorinated in its irradiation vessel and consumed
appreciable fluorine before the consumption rate became negligible.

. Evidence to date implies that x-ray photons of 250 kv and less can
cause radiolysis of metal fluoride mixtures under certain conditions. It
appears that the individual component salts may be less susceptible to
decomposition than the mixtures, and it 1s entirely possible that the pre-
sence of impurity salts may drastically affect the G value for fluorine
generation.

Irradiation with Van de Graaff Electrons

As mentioned previously, experiments to investigate the effect of
beta radiation on fluorine evolution from solid, MSRE-type fused salt have
been in progress.® These were initiated to establish whether irradiation
of the solid salt results in evolution of fluorine in amounts required to
explain the amounts found in in-pile capsule tests; but an important ob-
Jective was the evaluation of Gp, as a function of several variables,
including irradiation dose, dose rate, and crystal size in the salt. Ex-
periments have been completed which yield values of Gy, as a function of
dose, at a constant dose rate, up to a total dose of about 6 x 1022 ev
per gram of salt. Observations have also been made on the effect of dif-
ferent dose rates on Gp_, and on changes in crystallite size in the salt as
a result of the irradia%ions. The experiments and results to date are
summarized in the following paragraphs.
99

Experimental. The procedure involved exposing particles of solid
fused salt to fast electrons and determining gain or loss of fluorine in
the irradiation cell (Fig. 5.8) due to the irradiation. The cell was
filled to atmospheric pressure with a mixture of known amounts of helium
and fluorine (4 to 6% fluorine) prior to irradiation. Control experiments

control loss or gain comprised a major part of the experimental work. The
addition of a fluorine-helium mixture was adopted as a method of minimiz-
ing fluorine loss to the cell and of favoring the formation of a steady
state with respect to the amount of fluorine sorbed by the salt. A
summary of some other experimental conditions is given in Table 5.k,

Fluorine analyses were made by spectrophotometric measurement of the
amount of iodine formed during passage of a gas sample through KI solution.
A few check analyses of the composition of cell gases by the mass spectro-
gréphic method were obtained also.

Provisions were made with auxiliary equipment for (1) evacuation of
cell and connecting lines, (2) fluorination of system, (3) addition of
purified helium, (4) addition of fluorine-helium control samples, and (5)
sweeping of gas from cell through KI solution. The cell was removed from
the auxiliary equipment for filling with salt and for irradiations.

One group of experiments was made to determine the Gp, as a function
of dose. A total dose of 6.1 x 10%% ev/g was accumulated in a series of
2-hr exposures at 0.97 pa.

Another group of experiments was made in which the salt was irradi-
ated for 8.67 hr at 0.97 pa before suitable control measurements were
made. Following this, l-hr exposures at 0.97, 0.49, and 1.9L pa were
made along with control measurements.

Other experiments were made to determine the fluorine loss or gain in
the cell under irradiation but without salt.

Two samples of salt which had been exposed to a total dose of about
7.5 x 1022 ev/g in two different experiments were examined by C. F. Weaver
for crystallite size.

Results. The results of the exposures of the cell without salt
showed that fluorine was released at a low rate throughout the 12 hr of
irradiation. The rate increased with dose to a maximum of about 10 ug/hr.
(It is likely that this fluorine was released from the Teflon gasket.)

The control experiments made at intervals between irradiation experiments
showed a continuing loss of fluorine to the cell and/or salt throughout
each group of experiments. 1In the group of experiments to determine
fluorine evolution as a function of dose, the ratio of the amount of fluo-
rine lost, as indicated by control experiments, to the increase observed
in a radiation experiment was always <0.2. In the other group of experi-
ments, this fraction was higher (about 0.7 at maximum). However, in this
latter case, relative release rates were of primary interest, and these
were considered accurate to about + 10%.

A mass spectrographic analysis of the gas contained in a cell after
a l-hr irradiation at 0.97 pa showed the following percentage composition:
Fo, 5.16; No, 3.2; 0s, 1.0; COs, 0.04; CF,, 0.06; U, 0. The ratio of Np
to O indicates air contamination. This contamination could have occurred
during the transfer to the mass spectrograph.

This value of Gp, was obtailned from.pressure -rise measurements that were
made on the capsules in a hot cell beginning about 11 days after termina-
tion of in-pile irradiation. When measurements were made on these cap-
sules in-pile*® during the initial reactor shutdown, the dose reached 2 to
3 x 10°% ev/g before any pressure change occurred, and this induction
period was followed by a period of fluorine evolutlon at a GF2 value of
~0.02. The curve in Fig. 5.9 has been arbitrarily allowed to intercept
the abscissa at a point which agrees with this induction-period behavior.

Discussion. The experimental investigation is incomplete, and final
interpretations of some of the data, such as an apparent increase in Gp
with decreasing dose rate, have not been made. However, some general
comments on the data can be made. |

The results of these experiments have demonstrated that fluorine is
evolved in substantial amounts from solid MSRE fuel under electron ir-
radiation; and, in this respect, this irradiation system is similar to the
in-pile capsule systems and to other out of-pile irradiation systems which
are under investigation.l?l
13

103

There were rather large differences between the Gp_, values observed
in this work and those reported for the in-pile capsules from experiment
47-5. These were largest at the low dose levels. The experimental con-
ditions and materials employed in the two investigations differed, of
course, in several respects. Among the factors which differed and which
cannot be discounted as possible sources of the difference in results are
(1) dose rates, (2) size and method of preparation of solid samples, (3)
presence of graphite in contact with the salt in the in-pile capsules,
and (L4) extent of reduction of the fuel occasioned by previous loss of Fo.

 Temperature differences, which were small in some experiments, and minor

initial differences in fuel composition were probably not responsible for
the differences in results. This statement regarding the effect of salt
composition is based on considerations of preliminary results of cobalt-
source irradiations of salt reported by Compere and coworkers.'® Their
test material and that used in the Van de Graaff experiments were taken
from the same stock of salt.

Further experiments in which the effects of dose rates are observed
throughout longer exposure periods are required to elucidate the dose rate
effects in general and, in particular, to establish whether an effect of
dose rate exists at the steady state.

Irradiation of CF,

Preliminary trials®® to determine the stability of CF, under gamma
irradiation have been carried out in prefluorinated cells of nickel. The
amounts of fluorine obtained thus far, after exposures of up to six weeks,
are much smaller than those corresponding to G values (0.1 to 0.3) in the
literature. However, the experimental system in the literature would all
have scavenged any F or Fs produced, whereas the prefluorinated nickel
would have prevented any loss to the cell.

Phase Equilibrium Studies

In connection with a few recent revisions in proposed fuels for use
in the MSRE, the evolution of the presently specified compositions pro-
vides a useful basis for summarizing the current status of the phase
studies.

Phase Behavior in MSRE Fluoride Systems

As part of the program to provide improved fuels, blankets, and fluid
coolant for the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, continuing Iinvestigations of
the crystallization equilibria in useful fluoride systems have included
comprehensive studies not only of liquidus-solidus behavior but also
solid-state equilibria and crystal chemistry as well. These studies have
led to generalizations with respect to molten-salt phase behavior and
crystal chemistry and have provided a basis for meaningful diagnoses of
off-performance difficulties encountered in engineering tests.

For some time the choice of salt systems to be investigated as a
solvent for UF, and other quadrivalent fluorides of interest to MSRE has
been narrowed to Li“F-BeFs; but complete phase diagrams, determined either
at ORNL or at Mound Laboratory, are now available for nearly all the
limiting binary and ternary systems involved in both LiF-BeFo-ThF4-UF,
and NaF-BeFs-ThF,-UF, equilibria. With one exception, reports in the open
literature have now been made on each of the limiting systems.

By 1958, it was apparent that economic development of a reactor tech-
nology based on NaF-BeFo was unlikely in the United States because ‘the
inventory requirement was 1.1 to 2 times the amount of U®3°% required for
the Li7F-BeF2 salt and there was a recognized disadvantage of 0.1 to 0.15
in the regeneration ratio.t A typical fuel composition of interest at
this time, with a token amount of ThF, to demonstrate compatibility in
breeder systems, was Li“F-BeFo-ThF,-UF, (65-30-4-1 mole %) (mp ~L50°C).
The secondary coolant composition to be used in conjunction with this fuel
was Li“F-BeFs (66-34 mole %); the coolant composition, which is still the
current choice, was selected primarily to obtain a suitably low melting
point (455°C) without excessive viscosity of mixtures rich in BeFs.

By‘l960, as the conceptual design of the MSRE reached an advanced
point, there was increasing concern about the precipitation of U0z by
oxide contamination.® Accordingly, the fuel composition was revised so
that a sufficient amount of ZrF, was present to ensure that any oxide pre-
cipitation that might occur would be in the form of ZrOs rather than UOo.
Enough thorium was again retained to demonstrate the mutual compatibility
of thorium, uranium, and zirconium fluorides in the reactor system, lead-
ing to the composition Li”F-BeFo-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) as
the proposed fuel for the MSRE.® A governing consideration in the choice
of this and subsequent compositions was the selection of a maximum Li"F

105
106

content consistent with a melting point lower than that of the coolant.

- The equilibrium relations of all mixtures which could be formed on pre-
paring this composition by adding a liquid mixture of the LiF-UF4 eutectic
to the appropriate LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF, solvent were explored in detail to
determine the safety of bringing the reactor to criticality by titrating
with the LiF-UF, mixture.?® The phase behavior was such that segregation
of the three tetrafluorides (ZrF,, ThF,, UF,) presented no serious problem
in MSRE operation; but the omission of ThF,, which simplified some aspects
of the operation, led to similar but somewhat less-complex fuel systems.
One of the compositions, characterized by the maximum amount of UF, re-
quired for clean criticality, contains only 0.15 mole % of UF,. So low a
required concentration essentially reduced the egquilibrium phase rela-
tions to those in the system LiF-BeFo-ZrF,. To provide a larger oxidation-
reduction buffer in the fuel and also as additional protection in case of
inadvertent precipitation of uranium, a dilution of U235F4 with U®%®F, was
invoked in formulating a fuel with 0.83 mole % of UF,. With this added
safeguard, the fuel composition specified for first operation in the MSRE
was LiF-BeFo-ZrF4-UPS5F,-UP3%F, (65-29.17-5-0.29-0.54 mole %); the final
synthesis of this melt will be carried out in the reactor by addition of
the molten LiF-UF, eutectic (73-27 mole %) mixture to the solvent LiF-
BeFo-ZrF, (64.43-30.44-5.14 mole %).

The investigation of MSRE phase behavior is proceeding along three
lines: (1) some of the less important regions in the system LiF-BeFs-ZrF,
are being completely described, (2) a reexamination is being made of crys-
tallization reactions which may occur during freezing of current mixtures,
and (3) the equilibrium solubility of UFs in the MSRE solvent and fuel is
being determined. ‘

Liquid Tmmiscibility in the System LiF-BeF--ZrF,

In the course of determining the liquid-solid relations at low LiF
concentrations in the system LiF-BeFp-ZrF,, evidence was obtained that two
immiscible liquids are formed above the ZrF, primary phase field. Such
immiscibility is quite rate in molten electrolytes and had not been hereto-
fore encountered in molten fluorides under study in connection with reactor
use. While the composition-temperature relations of the two-liquid immis-
cibility gap have not been established, the two-liquid region apparently
extends at least from 25 to 70 mole % of ZrF, and from 5 to 20 mole %
of LiF in its extremities. The monotectic temperature plane below the two-
liquid region, at which the equilibrium phases are solid ZrF, and two
liquids, ranges from 786 to 529°C as the ZxF, concentration changes from
25 to 70 mole %. The physical properties, particularly the viscosity, of
these liquids are unattractive from the standpoint of many practical
applications.

Data giving evidence of the two-liquid region were obtained on equi-
librating mixtures of purified fluorides and quenching from high tempera-
ture. ©Specimens obtained from such experiments contain spheroidal glass
-fragments along with those of a partially devitrified glass, as shown in
Fig. 6.1 and 6.2. In Fig. 6.1, spheroidal and devitrified glass are shown;

in Fig. 6.2, two varieties of glass are shown. Liquid immiscibility was
not reported in a recent investigation of the system BeFo-ZrF, in the
Russian literature;® however, since visual data were not obtained, the im-
miscible liquids might have been present though not detected. Among the
other questionable aspects of the Russian phase diagram are a melting tem-
perature of BeFz of 793°C rather than the generally accepted 545°C, a
solid-state transition of BeF, at 680°C, and also a regular group of thermal
breaks at 578°C; these breaks suggest the liklihood of liquid immiscibility
throughout the composition of their occurrence. Current work at ORNL is
directed toward clarification of the ambiguities connected with the BeFo-
ZrF4 phase diagram.

Petrographic Examination of Irradiated MSRE Salt

The general appearance under the polarizing light microscope of irra-
diated MSRE salt, LiF-BeFp-ZrF4-UF4-ThF, (70-23.3-5-0.7-1.0 mole %), was
that of optically identifiable fluoride phases normally present in fuel
plus phases not identified because of their opacity or fineness which are
also common in rapidly cooled melts.

The identifiable phases, from in-pile capsules and from Van de Graaff
irradiations, possessed optical properties which were somewhat altered
from those of the same phases in unirradiated salt. The LiF in irradiated
samples was brown, but the refractive index remained unchanged.®™® The
compound 2LiF:BeF> was brownish purple, and the more intensely colored
material had a range of refractive indices. The color change was observa-
ble at dose levels too low to cause measurable changes in refractive

109

indices.®”1 The compound 2LiF-ZrF, had reduced refractive indices but

remained colorless.® The occurrence of these color effects in electron-
irradiated salt® that remained crystalline at near room temperature indi-
cated that they are radistion effects rather than the results of doping
with fission products or other nuclear products, or contamination by the
container.

No UFs has been detected in these samples®™® in spite of the reducing
conditions ensuing from the loss of Fo induced by radiation damage. The
expected UF -containing compounds have been detected.”?8,11

In an earlier observation of irradiated salt that had been exposed to
air in a melt-out operation, much UQ, was present.l® (xides were rarely
observed in samples from subsequent irradiation experiments.®” 82121

The change in composition of the liquid by evaporation, as evidenced
in a series of samples by a decrease in the relative amount of low re-
fractive index material (<1.%93%) and the presence of well-chrystallized
LiF,6 was attributed to a wvapor composition richer in BeFs than the fuel.
The appearance of the distillate indicated that the composition change
occurred by selective removal of 2LiF-BeFs, BeFo, and 2LiF-ZrF, (ref. 6)
and was most extensive in the most highly irradiated rr1a1:erials,6’8 pro-
bably because of the higher temperatures involved.

In a given series, capsules which were most highly irradiated con-
tained the best crystallized material.® This may have been caused by a
reduced rate of cooling as a result of greater fission product afterheat.
However, a similar crystal growth was observed in electron-irradiated
samples for which the temperatures remained well below the solidus.?
This observation was surprising; accordingly, more than 40 each of irra-
diated and unirradiated samples were contrasted in establishing the va-
lidity of this correlation between exposure and crystal size, and no
exceptions were noted for the in-pile or electron-irradiated crystals.
The effect was not detected in crystals that recelved x rays at relatively
small doses such as 102° ev/g. The growth, apparently a consequence of
radiation rather than a heat effect, remains unexplained and will require
further study.

The range of particle sizes found in the in-pile capsules suggests
that the surface area of the solids could have differed by a order of mag-
nitude from capsule to capsule. This may favor a recombination of released
fluorine, as for example in capsule 6 of ORNL MTR-L47, which contained very
very finely divided material® and little Fo (ref. 13), according to Weaver.'%

The large proportion of opaque and fine materials, as well as the
extensive radiation damage, provide a need for x-ray diffraction data to
supplement the petrographic results, since, in addition to identification
of phases, a knowledge of structural changes in the radiation-damaged
materials might have both theoretical and practical interest. For instance,
if it were established that fluorine is released selectively from one
phase rather than from the entire salt, perhaps a composition for MSR fuels
could be selected which would not yield the Fo-generating phase on freezing.
110

Xenon Fluoride Studies

Further studies on the xenon fluorides by x-ray diffraction techniques
established the existence of a compound with the formula XeFs-XeF,, and its
crystal structure was determined.'® This substance was readily crystal-
lized from vapor containing a mixture of XeFp and XeF,, and crystals of
about 1 mm were grown. No other intermediate compound in this binary sys-
tem could be detected; the compound should have been present at some stage
in irradiated MSRE capsules, but too little is known of its chemical be-
havior to confirm the surmise that XeF, or XeFg was the species present at
the time gas samples were taken from capsules.

The crystal structure consists of an array of discrete XeFs and XeF,
molecules whose symmetries and dimensions are the same as in crystals of
the component phases. Since contacts between molecules in XeFs -XeF, are
not significantly closer than intermolecular distances in either of the
components, the new phase is described as a molecular addition compound.

Core and Blanket Fluids for Future Reactors

Investigations of temperature-composition relations in several molten-
salt systems of potential use in the development of a molten-salt fast-
breeder reactor were initiated recently. The guiding requirements were
(1) that the core and blanket fluids remain as homogeneous fluids at tem-
peratures above 550 to 600°C; (2) that the core fluid, a chloride mixture,
contain 35 to 55 at. % of fissionable species; and (3) that the blanket
fluid, a fluoride mixture, contain ~25 at. % of thorium and be capable of
dissolving an additional amount (5 to 7 at. %) of uranium and plutonium
at operating temperatures. Although several of the binary systems of UCls,
UCl,, and PuClg with the alkali chlorides or alkaline-earth chlorides are
well known, information for somewhat more complicated mixtures of UCls and
PuCls was necessary to obtain the requisite combinations. Accordingly,
the behavior within three-component systems is under study. Planned in-
vestigations of chloride ternary systems (at ORNL) were preceded by the
construction of predicted phase diagrams of the chloride systems of UClg
and PuCls to facilitate early discovery of optimal compositions for reactor
use. The diagrams suggested that the required 35 to 55 at. % of uranium
and plutonium could be dissolved at 550 to 600°C by a proper choice of
ternary chloride compositions.

The simplest system which appeared to be capable of providing a range
of fluoride melts suitable as blanket fluids and as homogeneous liguids
at temperatures above 550 to 600°C is NaF-KF-ThF,. As the blanket re-
mains in use, the composition could change sufficiently that it effectively
becomes a mixture of NaF-KF-ThF,-UFs-PuFs. Preliminary data obtained in
an investigation of the system NaF-KF-ThF, showed that the minimum melting
temperaturel® occurs within the subsystem NaF-2NaF*ThF,-NaF KF-ThF, at
the eutectic composition NaF-KF-ThF, (67-11-22 mole %), melting at 535°C.
The contiguous primary phase fields at this invariant point are NaF .2ThF,
solid solution, NaF, and NaF+KF:ThF, solid solution. Substitutional solid
solutions are readily formed between NaF-ThF, and KF-ThF, solid phases.
111

Therefore, segregation among the crystallizing prhases in the system NaF-
K¥-ThF, is diminished, as should also be the case for mixtures of NaF-KIF-
ThF4-UF,. A static molten blanket constituted of NaF-KF-ThF, appears to
have favorable properties and, from the standpeint of crystallization be-
havior, should be relatively free of hazardous segregation of the uranium
and thorium phases during freezing-thawing cycles. An expanded investiga-
tion of fast-breeder blanket materials is planned.

Oxygen and Sulfur in Molten Fluorides

Oxide Behavior in LioBeF,-7ZrF,-UF,

In a previous progress report,’ results on oxide behavior in flush-
salt - fuel-salt mixtures (LigBeF4 containing principally UF, and ZrF4)
were presented which were consistent with the simple dissolution equilibria

U0a( &) » UL 4+ 202" (1)

7r0o(s) » zrit 4 2027 . (2)

It ﬁas foyund that Zr0, could be precipitated by adding oxide in the
presence oi U%" without detectable U0z precipitation until the ratio
[zr*"]/[U*"] in solution fell to about 2.7 (at 600°C). With further oxide
additions both UQz and ZrQO. were precipitated, with the ratio of [zr*"]/
.[U4+] remaining nearly constant. This suggested strongly that UO- and
ZrO> were precipitated separately as pure oxides; i.e., that no (Zr-U)0s
solid solutions were formed in these systems.

The relation of the separate concentrations of 74" and U%t in the
melt to the estimated oxide ion concentration in the melt was consistent
with the simple mass action behavior expected for the above two reactions.
This implied that no significant complexing of U4t or zZrtt with 02~ occur-
red in the concentration ranges tested earlier; but continued studies
suggest that, over larger concentration ranges, the behavior is more com-
plicated.

The recent results were obtained during further exploration of the
behavior of U0z and ZrOs in equilibrium with LisBeF, melts containing UF,
and Z2rF, which were initially directed toward the possibility of oxide
solid solution formation. Published phase diagramsl8 are in agreement
that a virtually continuous solid solution is formed between UO- and tetra-
gonal Zr0s, at elevated temperatures (1800°C) and that, although an immis-
cibility region in the tetragonal solid solution prevails at lower tem-
peratures, tetragonal ZrQO, stabilized by UO- persists far below the
transition of Zr0Oz to monoclinic, near 1000°C. Also, in regard to the
substitution of U for Zr%t in monoclinic Z2r0s, these diagrams show,
though not with agreement in detail, appreciable regions of solid solution.
Such solid solutions have not been manifest in the monoclinic ZrO- pre-
cipitated in the presence of UF, from MSRE-type melts at operating
112

temperatures; but, because of the potential importance to fluoride reactor
fuel performance, further investigations were made of the behavior of UQo
with Zr0Oz in equilibrium with LioBeF, melts containing UF, and ZrF,.

In one of the series of experiments that demonstrated the absence of
solid solutions, a weighed quantity of LisBeF, (~2.5 kg) melt containing
about 1.3 moles of ZrF, per kilogram of melt was purified in a nickel
container by HF-H, sparging. Over a period of about 70 days, successive
weighed additions of UOz, Zr0s, and UF, were made. Weighed samples of the
melt were withdrawn from time to time with copper filter sticks. Contin-
uous helium sparging was used to provide agitation and to blanket the melt.
The results of melt analysis and the estimated solid levels are summarized
in Fig. 6.3, wherein the various additions to the melt are labeled A
through J.

(A-B) Upon successive UOp additions (A and B), the U*" concentration
rose and the Zr%" concentration fell by the calculated amounts (solid
lines) for the complete metathetic reaction

divided (<l p) ZrOs. The composition of the melt, which corresponded

approximately to that of the MSRE fuel salt, was unchanged over this ex-
tended period. In particular, the constancy of the U4 concentration in
the presence of up to 1.5 moles of Zr0- per kilogram of melt indicated
no appreciable takeup of yst by Z2r0-. At point E, a sample of melt plus
solid was taken by means of a dip stick. Microscopic and x-ray examina-
tion confirmed the absence of UO- in this sample. Along with the finely
divided ZrO, which had been added, well-formed ZrOs crystals grown from
the melt also were found.

(F) At point F, sufficient UF, was added to decrease the [Zr**]/
[U%*t] ratio to 2.2 in the melt. Although on the basis of earlier results
it was expected that UOs precipitation could have intervened under these
conditions, the agreement of the analyses with the solid lines in Fig. 6.3
indicated that no detectable precipitation occurred. ( The 7zr**T concentra-
tion decreased only in accord with the diluting effect of the added UFy4.)

(G-J) At point G, sufficient UF, was added to produce a [Zr*+]/[U%t]
ratio of about 1. The subsequent rise in 7r%t concentration and the dis-
appearance of U4t from the melt, shown by the divergence of the dashed
lines from the solid lines in Fig. 6.3, indicated that precipitation of
UO> had now occurred by the reverse of reaction (3),

72r0s(s) + U - z2r*t + UOs(s) . (4)

Conformance with this indication was obtained at point H by the addition
of a small amount of UO», which produced no change in the melt composition.
At points I and J, still further U0z precipitation was produced by UF,
sdditions. After the UF, additions at G, I, and J, the [Zr*"]/[U%"] ratios
were 1.57, 1.47, and 1.34, respectively, at 600°C, indicating that the
solubility ratio of Zr0O- to UOs fell with increasing concentration of Uttt
and Zr%* in the melt. Previous results at much lower concentrations of
U4t and zr*t gave a ratio of ~2.7. During the period I to J, equilibra-
tions were carried out at 500 and 700°C as well as at 600°C; as indicated
in Fig. 6.4, the effect of temperature on the solubility ratios was small
in this concentration range (~1 mole of ZrF, per kilogram of melt).

At the conclusion of this sequence, the melt was drawn from the nickel
vessel through a filter of sintered nickel. The residue on the filter was
ground and then washed with water to remove the slightly soluble fluoride
salts and the finely divided insoluble material. The residue, examined
microscopically, was found to contain principally well-formed, colorless
Zr0- and transparent, red UOz crystals. There was no indication here of
(U-Zr)0s solid solution formation nor of nucleation of overgrowth of one
crystal form on the other.

In a subsequent experiment the evident variation of the ratio [Zr%T]
/[U%*] as a function of [Zr*"] when both Zr0s, and U0, simultaneously
saturated the melt was examined further. An LisBeF, melt, initially free
of Zr**t and U4+, was purified in the usual way. Additions of U0, and Zr0Os
followed by UF, and ZrF, were made in amounts that were adjusted so that

both U0z and Zr0p were expected to be present as solid phases throughout
the experiment. The [Zr®*"] concentration was varied in the range 0.007
to 0.6 mole/kg. The temperature was varied from 500 to 700°C. Agitation
was provided by a mechanical stirrer which was sealed at the top of the
nickel vessel by a Teflon cone seal. In general, equilibration times of
several hours to one day were allowed after each addition to the melt or
after each temperature change. As a test of the rate of approach to
equilibrium, a few samples taken less than 1/2 hr after a composition
change were found to be close to the new equilibrium.

The saturation ratios, [Zr4+]/[U4+], found in these measurements are
plotted vs [Zr*"] in Fig. 6.4. Also, the results from the previous series,
at [Zr4t] approximately 1 mole/kg, as well as some earlier data are in-
cluded in Fig. 6.4. Although there was an increasing scatter in the data
at the lower concentrations of U4t and Zr4+, there was a consistent trend.
The previously reported saturation ratio, [Zr**]/[U4"] = 2.7, had been
found in the range 0.01 to 0.03% mole of 74t per kilogram of melt.

When both U0z and Zr0p saturate a melt, an equilibrium involving both
reactions (1) and (2) applies, with the result that the activity ratio

4+ S
[ZI' ]7ZI'4"+ KZI'OE

4+ = .8

is a constant. As the composition of the melt varies from nearly pure
LioBeF, to LipzBeF, - 5 mole % ZrF, - 3 mole % UF,, some variation in the
ratio 7Zr4+/7U4+ is to be expected, and this presumably accounts for the
relatively gradual variation in [Zr4"]/[U4"] in the range 0.02 to 1 mole
of zrt per kilogram.

115

Below 0.02 mole of zr*™ per kg, the concentration ratic rises sharply
with decreasing 7, r4t concentration, the increase being strongly influenced
by the temperature. The reason for this variation in the saturation ratio
is not known at present. Two alternative explanations suggest themselves:
1. The saturation limit of U*T in the presence of increasing oxide
ion concentration may fall more rapidly because UOo is not the saturating
phase; e.g., a mixed oxide or some new U%T-02- phase (M,UO,) is formed in
which M is Be2t and/or Iit and y is greater than 2. The possibility of a
solid uranium-containing phase in which the activity of UO- was less than
unity gained support from previously reported experiments'® in which it
was found that U*t could be reduced to very low concentrations in fluoride
melts (<h x 107® mole/kg) by the addition of excess BeO, that is, to con-
centrations much lower than the estimated U** concentration in equilibrium
with BeO and UOs as the saturating solids (~0.0025 mole/kg).

2. As the oxide ion concentration in the melt increases, inter-
action between Zr*t and 0%~ to form Zr0®t or other OXy- complexes could
become important. However, as noted previously, this effect should pro-
duce significant oxide tolerances in the presence of high 7zr*t concen-
trations, and none so far has been detected in the concentration ranges
involved in MSRE melts.

In future experiments, the effect of excess BeO on the U%" satura-
tion limit in LipBeF, will be explored further. In addition, it is
planned to vary the oxide ion concentration of LisBeF, melts in a known
way by means of sparging with a known Ho-HF-H-0 gas composition. In this
way the variation of [Zr**] and [U**] with [02"] can be reexamined to
check the possibility of M*+-0®~ interactions in such melts.

Whatever the explanation, this variation of the saturation ratio
[zr**t]/[U%t] with [2r**] is an important consideration in the choice of
MSRE fuel- and flush-salt compositions. A [Zr*"]/[U%"] ratio of only
1.5 to 2 is required in the fuel to prevent UO, precipitation, the satu-
ration ratio being only slightly dependent on temperature. Although a
flush salt with the composition LiyBeF, should have a high oxide capacity,
at the same time, the saturation limit of U** is low and the nature of
the controlling mass action behavior is not fully understood. Also
noteworthy was the relative ease with which solid UOs reacted and went
into solution in these experiments; whether such nonrefractory behavior
would be characteristic of UOo with a different history is uncertain, but
that there are at least some conditions under which UOs can be dissolved
is of interest in practical operations.

At the conclusion of the second sequence of equilibrations, a sample
of the oxides was again obtained by filtration and washing. The photo-
micrographs in Fig. 6.5 compare this material with the U0, and ZrO- used
in this run as starting materials. The ZrQOs,, initially <1 y particle size,
was transformed by the equilibration with the fluoride melt to well-
developed, colorless monoclinic crystals, some of which were 80 u long.

The UQ> was converted from black aggregates of UQs,,- to well-developed,
transparent garnet-red crystals of similar size. The absence of color in
the Zr0- suggests that little or no Ut is present in these crystals; the

An x-ray diffraction pattern was made of this mixture using Cu KX
radiation and a 0.25° 26/min scanning rate with subsequent hand settings
for increased precision. Diffraction peaks were produced to approximately
135° 26. An internal standard of crystalline LiF was used. Within the
limits of the method the lattice constants of the monoclinic Zr0O, and
cubic UOs,gpo were not detectably different from the available standards.

It is inferred from these and previous results, which show no evi-
dence of (U—Zr)02 solid solution formation, that the five published phase
diagrams of the Zr0s-UO> system are considerably in error at temperatures
below 1000 to 1100°C. A reinvestigation of the system at lower temperatures,
using a suitable fluoride fused salt as an equilibrating medium, would be
of considerable interest.

For the present it appears quite probable that the MSRE fuel will not
be subject to uranium deposition as (U—Zr)02 as a result of oxide contami-
nation. To further confirm this, (U-Zr)02 solid solutions--presently being
prepared by UOs-Zr0s reaction at 1750°C--will be equilibrated in LipBeF,
melts.

Removal of Sulfates from Li-BeF4

Sulfates are usually present as impurities in molten-salt raw mater-
ials. During normal removal by the Hp-HF purification process at the
production facility, wherein equipment of copper and nickel is used, there
have been instances of severe sulfide corrosion of nickel containers and
piping. The study of sulfate behavior in molten fluorides 1is continuing,
therefore, in order to investigate means of reducing the potential cor-
rosion hazards during molten-salt purification and also to assess the
possibility of significant sulfide attack on INOR-8 by sulfur impurities
which could conceivably remain in the molten salt produced for the MSEE.

Preliminary studies of sulfate removal by the usual HF-Ho purlflca-
tion procedure, 20 g5 well as sulfate decomposition and solublllty,
have already been reported. In the present measurements, removal of
sulfate from molten LisBeF4, by He, Hz, and Ho-HF sparging are compared.

Reactions of Sulfate. A large number of reactions are of possible
interest in the removal of sulfate ion from molten fluorides, and they
iead variously to the formation of S0z, S0-, metal sulfides (by‘corrosion),
S-0-F, and S-F compounds. The results reported previously indicate that
one mode of decomposition in the absence of reacting gases at 500 to 800°C
is the formation of 50g,

50,2 = s05(g) + O°7 . (5)

Although the position of this equilibrium is not known, this reaction may
be used as the starting point in a consideration of possible subsequent
118

reactions. Thermodynamic data available in the literature®®:23 lead to
the following reactions (AF values are for a temperature of 900°K, 627°C):

At low partial pressures of SOz, partial decomposition to SOo occurs,

S0 (g) = SO0z(g) + 402(g) AF = 3.45 xeal (6)

502, 503, and 8042' all may be expected to oxidize nickel to form oxides
and sulfides.* '

80,2" + Ni(s) - 3Ni0(s) + NiS(s) + 02" (9)

In the presence of hydrogen, it has been observed that 8042- is re-
duced to HsS, '

S0,%" + UHo(g) = 07 + HzS(g) + 3H=20(g) (10)

S0z and SOs also are expected to be reduced,

S0=(g) + 23Ho(g) » HoS(g) + 2Ho0(g) AF = -U45.0 kecal (11)
S0s(g) + UHo(g) -~ HoS(g) + 3H20(g) AF = -67.9 kcal

HoS, in turn, can react with Ni to form NiS,*
HoS(g) + Ni(s) = Wis(s) + Ho(g) AF = -11.9 kecal (13)

*Since a number of nickel sulfides exist and, often, they are non-
stoichiometric compounds, the formula "NiS" is used here and elsewhere in
the test to represent whatever nickel sulfide might form. In reactions
7-9 and 13, "NiS" represents the nickel’ sulfide with the lowest sulfur
content formed at 900°K. Its composition is approximated by the formula
NigSz. The free energies listed in reactions 7, 8, and 13 are based on
the PHES/PHg ratios (Fig. 6.6) observed by Rosenquist.Z3

Thus, both in the presence and in the absence of hydrogen, sulfate may

Nickel and Copper Corrosion. Penetrating sulfide attack on nickel
can occur as the result of a eutectic which is formed between nickel and
sulfur (Ni - 33 at. % S) which melts at 645°C. Above this temperature
the liquid formed apparently can penetrate the metal rapidly along grain

boundaries.®4 The equilibria (reaction 13 above) in which nickel sul-
fides can be formed from Ni and HoS have been studied by Rosenquist.®3

He finds for solids containing less than 33 at. % 5, the equilibrium
Py,s/Pp, ratios plotted vs temperature in Fig. 6.6. Provided the Pg_g/Py,
ratio falls below this curve, no nickel sulfide will be formed, and any
that is present will be reduced to the metal. Included in Fig. 6.6 is a
curve (calculated®® from AF for reaction 17) which shows the Pu,s/Pp,
ratio required for Cu»sS formation.

From this it appears that the usual HF-Hs treatment would be most
suitable for sulfate removal if the resulting PH2S/PH2 ratios do not ex-
ceed the levels required for nickel and copper sulfide formation. Severe
nickel attack might be avoided by holding the temperature below 645°C,
thereby avoiding a liquid eutectic in grain boundaries. The alternative
approach is to use a strongly oxidizing gas such as HF or Fs in the hope
that S05 and sulfur oxyfluorides can be driven off rapidly before exces-
sive oxidation of the metal surfaces can occur.

Helium Sparging. Several runs have been made in which small batches
(~250 g) of LisBeF, were melted and purified by Hso-HF sparging, and then
known weights of LisS0, were added and helium sparging was continued over
extended periods. Copper-lined nickel containers were used in these ex-
periments. The rate of sulfate removal was followed by periodic sampling
of the melt with copper filter sticks, followed by analysis for total
sulfur,

The results of two such runs are shown in Fig. 6.7, indicating the
dependence of the removal rate on temperature. In another run at 750°C,

the rate was not noticeably influenced by changing the gas flow rate from
500 to 250 cm®/min.

In a later test the rate of sulfate removal from the melt was much
faster at 750°C than is indicated in Fig. 6L7, falling from 1100 to 800
ppm in 3 hr and to <100 ppm in 70 hr. However, in the same run, acidic
gases (collected in a KOH scrubber) were given off slowly over a period
of many days, showing a decay half-time of about 50 hr. The total amount
ultimately collected was equivalent to only about one-third of the sul-
fate initially present if this gas were S0s.

These results indicate that the removal of sulfate can occur by
several processes, which presumably include copper and nickel sulfide
formation as well as S0g evolution. Even if corrosion could be prevented,
the evolution of SO5 appears too slow a process to render inert-gas sparg-
ing an attractive removal method.

Hydrogen Reduction. In a subsequent experiment a purified Li-BelF,
melt to which LisSO, had been added (to 2000 ppm S) was sparged with
hydrogen at various flow rates at 600, 700, and 800°C. A nickel con-
tainer without a copper liner was used. The HoS5 in the effluent gas was
absorbed by ammoniacal CdCls, scrubbers, which were subsequently analyzed
for sulfide.

The course of this run is shown in Fig. 6.8. At the beginning of
the experiment the influence of temperature on the removal rate was clearly
evident, the rates being in the approximate ratios 4:7:10 at 600, 700, and
800°C respectively. The increase in removal rate with increasing Ho flow
was also evident, particularly during the period from 12 to 20 hr, though
the relation is less than a direct proportionality. During this same
period (800°C, average Ho flow of 345 cm®/min), the sulfur was removed
with an approximate half-time of 6 hr. At the end of the run the con-
tainer was sectioned lengthwise, and the frozen contents were removed,
ground, and sampled. The samples contained 0.0095 mile per kilogram of
sulfur, all as sulfide, and 0.027 mole per kilogram of nickel. ©Since,
with Ho sparging, NiZ* should not be present to a significant extent in
the melt, this nickel was probably present as NiS and NiO solids sus-
pended in the melt. From the material balances for the run (830 mg of
sulfur added, 329 mg.of sulfur removed as HxS, 149 mg of sulfur found in
the frozen melt, 360 mg of sulfur unaccounted for), only 40% of the sulfur
added was removed as HoS; the remainder was removed as SOs5 or by reaction
with the nickel container.

The sectioned container was found to be in good condition. The upper
wall of the vessel which had been exposed to the gas phase was clean and
shiny. Below the surface of the melt the wall was covered with a light,
blackish coating; however, there was no sign of severe penetrating attack.
From this it seems clear that a portion of the L43% of the total sulfur un-
accounted for was lost to the walls.

Thus it appears that hydrogen alone can remove sulfate more effectively
than an inert gas. The principal advantages are that removal is faster

and, although corrosive attack is not prevented, it is much less severe
than with an inert gas.

Removal by Ho and HF., Since, even in the presence of hydrogen, some
corrosive attack on nickel was evident, yielding nickel sulfides which
were not readily reduced by hydrogen, it was decided in the subsequent
Ho-HF sparging experiment to add beryllium metal at the beginning as a
means of rapidly reducing sulfate to sulfide., This would prevent the un-
wanted reduction of sulfate by nickel with resulting nickel corrosion.
Once in the form of sulfide, sulfur would present no corrosion hazard
under reducing conditions., It would then be removed by HF,

SHF(g) + S°7 = HoS(g) + 2F . (18)

Of course, HF will oxidize nickel,
Ni(s) + 2HF(g) = WNi®* + 2F + Ho(g) (19)

and this, at first sight, might appear an alternate route to the formation
of NiS. By combining reactions 18 and 19,

H-S(g) + Ni(s) = Io(g) + Ni®T + 827 (20)

it is clear, however, that these two processes are eguivalent to reaction
1% and that, provided the PHES/PHE ratio is low enough (Fig. 6.6), the
activity of NiS in the melt Will Tot exceed that required to produce nickel
attack. Similar arguments would apply in the case of copper corrosion.

To a mixture of LisBeF, (500 g) and beryllium powder (0.621 g, 0.138
mole/kg) at 600°C in a nickel container without a copper liner, LisSO4
was added (to 500 ppm, 0.015 mole/kg). After sparging with helium for
1 hr, a filtered sample was withdrawn and analyzed, giving 390 ppm IS
(0.012 mole/kg) and 259 ppm S5~ (0.0081 moleékg). After 22 hr, a sample
cave 97 ppm =S (0.0030 mole/kg) and 93 ppm S5~ (0.0029 mole/kg). The
reduction thus was virtually complete, producing a slightly soluble sul-
fide, presumably BeS or LipS. At this point, Hy and HF sparging was begun
(the course of the run is summarized in Fig. 6.9). Although it was not
possible to resolve the effects of all the variables during the subse-
quent sparging period, the following observations could be made.

1. During the initial sparging, the high HF flow rates used for the
purpose of oxidizing the unreacted beryllium metal evidently produced ex-
cesses of HoS which caused some nickel attack. This is indicated by the
fact that, subsequently, HoS evolution occurred when only Heo sparging was
used. Indeed, the Hp flow seemed to be the most important variable.

2., The HoS evolution rate increased with temperature. This is
clearly evident at 24 hr, when the temperature was increased from 600 to
700°C. At 68 hr the increase of temperature to 800°C produced relatively
high HoS evolution rates even though the amount of sulfur remaining was
relagtively small. |

3. Of the 7 millimoles of sulfate added, about 6.5 was recovered as
HoS. A filtered sample of the melt at the end of the run showed 12 ppm
2SS and <5 ppm S Nearly all this removal was accomplished in approxi-
mately 24 hr, accumulated with Hs flow rates above 60 cm®/min.

Although the container has not been examined for evidence of sulfur
attack, it is apparent from the good material balance that little cor-
rosion occurred. This may be attributed mainly to the use of beryllium
metal reduction of the sulfate. In future tests, lower excesses of
beryllium metal will be used and/or it will be removed from the melt be-
fore Hs-HF sparging is begun. This should allow a more careful study of
the separate effects of Ho and HF flow rate on the HoS evolution rate.

It was of particular interest that the use of beryllium metal led to
nearly complete removal of sulfate without appreciable loss of sulfur to
metal corrosion. This could be of value in the fuel production opera-
tions, wherein many batches of raw material are processed in a single
vessel and cumulative effects of metal corrosion could possibly be serious.
If further tests confirm the effectiveness of beryllium metal in pre-
venting sulfide corrosion, its utilization in purification of fluorides
would seem quite feasible. For mixtures in which UF4 was absent, beryl-
lium metal could be added during the initial meltdown operation, and any
excess would remain in the premelting vessel when the molten salt was
subsequently transferred to the processing vessel for purification by
HF-H- treatment.

Physical Properties of Molten Fluorides

Interfacial Behavior of Molten Fluorides with Graphite

The wetting behavior of molten salts on graphite is well understood
only for specific systems and usually only if the systems are not com-
plicated by the presence of impurities. For example, MSRE fuels, even
with additional fluorides that can occur because of corrosion or fission-
ing, do not wet graphite in the absence of extraneous impurities. Among
the impurities that are known to have a pronounced effect, however,
oxygen is outstanding--presumably as combined oxide at the graphite-fuel
interface. One of the most sensitive indicators of wetting behavior is
the contact angle. In the sense used here, wetting is defined in terms
of the contact angle, and 90° marks the transition from wetting to non-
wetting.

To study wetting behavior, a vacuumtight apparatus for observing
sessile drops of fuel on graphite plaques was assembled and equipped to
operate with a static or flowing atmosphere of various gases. Initial
126

experiments with LiszBeF, at 650°C in nominally pure helium showed an ex-
treme sensitivity of the salt droplet to trace amounts of oxide or mois-
ture at impurity levels so low that accurate measurement became a major
problem. The changes in drop behavior were much less drastic and rapid
when the amounts of impurities were decreased either by improved purifi-
cation or by the use of static rather than flowing atmospheres.

For thermodynamic and kinetic reasons, Ho0 is much more reactive to-
ward MSRE melts than Os; in fact, 0o reacts with the coolant mainly through
intermediary reactions with the container. Less than 10 ppm H-0 in a
flowing helium atmosphere caused the formation by hydrolysis of an oxide
scum on drops of LioBeF,, and at only slightly higher H-0 concentrations
the scum became a shell with sufficient rigidity to prevent further change
in droplet shape. Even with 400 ppm 0o at 650°C in thoroughly dried
helium, changes in contact angle were not detected. No important dif-
ferences in behavior were noted when moist Hs was substituted for helium
or when MSRE fuel was substituted for LioBeF,. Also three types of gra-
phite (AGOT, CGB and pyrolytic) were tried; neither the type nor the
orientation had any detectable effect. Experience in earlier MSRE studies
and extrapolation of current results both led to the conclusion that the
drops remained unchanged for indefinitely long periods in sufficiently
pure helium.

In static helium, purified with hot titanium metal sponge, the con-
tact angle, 8, between graphite and either MSRE fuel or coolant was 150
to 160° at 640°C. Thus, neglect of cos 8 (cos 155° = 0.9) involves a 10%
error in estimating capillary effects of fuel in graphite, and for many
purposes this is insignificant. '

The wetting, such as that shown in Fig. 6.10, when it occurs, takes
place on the surface with virtually no permeation of the graphite. The
field for the metallographic cross section illustrated in Fig. 6.11 was
chosen to show an exceptional case where the large void near the center
of the picture was partially penetrated. Although the failure of the
wetting mechanism to continue into graphite pores has not been explained,
Plugging by oxide and depletion of HoO available from the gas in the pores
may play significant roles. In any case, chemisorbed oxygen on the gra-
phite appeared to be of relatively small significance in all the experi-
ments, provided that degassing of the graphite was carried out at 650°C
or above., Another point of considerable significance for MSRE operation
was that previous saturation of a salt droplet with oxide had little or
no effect on the wetting; only when additional oxide was formed on the
droplet interface, by introduction of moisture, did wetting ensue. This
is in agreement with a proposed mechanism requiring oxide formation at
the three-phase contact for wetting to proceed. Quantitative measures
of the rate of change induced by 10 ppm H-0O are shown graphically in
Fig. 6.12.

For experiments involving LipBeFy, which was preferred because of

form that BeO is wetted by LioBeF4, several trails were carried out; with
the exception of one as yet unexplained case, wetting ensued shortly after
melting of fluorides on BeO plaques in four experiments.

The possibility that protons rather than oxide from H-0O served as the
surface-active agent was not favored by demonstrations that NH,HF> and
KHFs did not wet graphite, at least initially; however, KHFs, evolving HF
as it melted, developed contact angles of less than 90° in a few minutes.

Viscosities of MSRE Fuel and Coolant

The viscosities of an MSRE-type fuel mixture, LiF-BeFo-ZrF,-UF, (66.5-
28.7-4.0-0.8 mole %) and coolant, LiF-BeFso (66~ 31 mole %) were measured

over the range 475 to 625°C with a commercial rotational viscometer
(Brookfield). The viscometer was calibrated with glycerine-water solutions.
The data for the salt mixtures are given in Fig. 6.13. Linear log 1 -

(l/T) relations appear to represent the data adequately. The equations

of the correlating lines in Fig. 6.13 are 1 = 0.0916 exp (4098/T) for the
fuel mixture and 1 = 0.116 exp (3755/T) for the coolant, where 1 is the
viscosity in centipoises and T is temperature 'in °K,

The fuel mixture on which these measurements were made was an interim
composition which was derived from the specified’ fuel for- highly enriched
uranium (0.2 mole % of UF.) by increasing the UF, to: '9:85 mole % and cor-
respondingly decreasing LiF and BeFs by equail decrements.. The fuel sche-
duled for operation in the MSRE, LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, (65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9 UF4),
was estimated to have a viscosity of 5% higher than the foregoing mixture,

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions in MSRE Melts

Chemical Reduction of Dissolved Fluorides of Structural Metals

Structural metal fluorides in molten fluoride fuels or coolants in-
fluence the corrosion behavior if present in other than equilibrium amounts,
and in large excess they could conceivably change the pattern of oxide
-precipitation. Consequently, in the preparation of molten fluoride mix-
tures for the MSRE and in the subsequent fluoride processing operations,
good control of the concentrations of such impurities is important. Ac-
cordingly, the rates at which the cations of structural metals can be
removed from MSRE-type melts by hydrogen sparging and by using stronger
reducing agents, such as beryllium metal and zirconium metal, have been
studied. Other objectives of these experiments were to improve fluoride
purification techniques and to serve as a guide for fuel processing in
the MSRE. Additional studies of the corrosion rates associated with the
use of various HF-H, mixtures for oxide removal were planned.

Reduction of FeF- by Hydrogen. The first experiments were with ap-
proximately 2 kg of LiF-BeFs (66-34 mole %) to which FeFo along with a
small amount of Fe’’ as a tracer had been added. Following dissolution
of these materials by hydrofluorination, the rates of removal were deter-
mined by analysis of salt samples withdrawn during various conditions of
hydrogen sparging. The results shown in Fig. 6.14 indicate the importance
of hydrogen flow rate in providing better liquid-gas contact and of the
temperature of the melt in which diffusion in the liquid film is probably
the controlling process,

Since the reduction rates were controlled by gas-liquid contact con-
ditions that were not well defined, the small-scale study could not be
directly scaled to larger equipment. Accordingly, studies were also made
in the large production facility with ~110 kg of the mixture LiF-NaF-ZrF,
(27.5-27.5-45.0 mole %) initially containing about 2000 to 3000 ppm by
weight of iron. Since small-scale experiments demonstrated much faster
reduction rates at higher temperature, the production facility experi-
ments were conducted at a "maximum advisable temperature for sustained
operations" of 700°C. The rates, presented in the form of first-order
reaction constants as a function of H, flow rate in Fig. 6.15, indicated
that hydrogen sparging rates of about 10 liters/min would accelerate the
reduction rate by about 300% over those obtained with the hydrogen flow
rate of 3 liters/min customarily used in the past. Also, there was
little to be gained with flow rates greater than 10 liters/min.

On MSRE melts, an initial iron concentration of 200 to 300 ppm in
~70 kg of LiF-BeFs (66-34 mole %) was used; the melt temperature was

advantage of using higher hydrogen sparging rates for removing structural
metal impurities from molten fluorides and more than compensated for any
increased volumes of Ho that might be required.

Reduction of Structural Metals by Beryllium and Zirconium. The use
of strong reducing agents such as beryllium or zirconium for removing
structural metal impurities from molten salts should under many circum-
stances be more effective than the current technique of hydrogen sparg-
ing. However, the use of these elements has frequently led to obscure
side effects that must be evaluated before the adoption of strong re-
ducing agents in routine fluoride purification processes, and experiments
toward this end have been initiated.

In one experiment, weighed increments of beryllium metal turnings
were added to a molten mixture of LiF-BeFs (66-34 mole %) at 600°C which
initially contained about 800 ppm of iron and about 200 ppm of chromium.
The analyses of salt samples withdrawn prior to each addition of beryl-
lium are shown in Fig. 6.17. A reaction period of about 4 hr between
additions was assumed to be adequate for complete reaction; the melt was
agitated by helium sparging during the entire reaction period. 1In a
similar experiment (Fig. 6.18), a relatively large concentration (5000
ppm) of chromium was removed from solution in LiF-BeFs (66-34 mole %) at
600°C by additions of zirconium metal turnings.

Both these experiments gave favorable results for effective removal
of structural metal contaminants from molten fluorides, but the apparent
stoichiometry of the reacting species was probably complicated by the
fact that iron and chromium may be present in both their divalent and
trivalent chemical forms. Because of these and other complications re-
lated to corrosion and fuel stability, further studies of the effects of
elemental beryllium and zirconium are continuing.

Apparent Solubility of UF5 Produced by Reducing Fuel with Excess Zirconium
Metal

Continuing investigations of the behavior of molten fluorides con-
taining UFg (ref 25), which have a bearing on the limits of chemical re-
duction consistent with stability in MSRE fuels, included determinations
of the solubility of UFs.

Approximately 1.75 kg of the mixture LiF-BeFs-ZrF4-ThF,-UF, (70-23-
5-1-1 mole %), containing about 6 wt % of uranium, was heated to 600°C
in a nickel reaction vessel and treated with anhydrous HF and hydrogen
to further ensure melt purity. Approximately 25 g of specially prepared
zirconium metal turnings was added in weighed increments to the cooled
reaction vessel. The zirconium was expected to form ZrF, by reducing
UF, to UF3. Following each addition, the mixture was heated to 800°C and
sparged with dry helium. Filtered samples of the salt were obtained after
each reaction period, using sintered copper filters, and analyzed by a
hydrogen~-evolution method that does not necessarily distinguish trivalent
uranium from other reducing agents, but no others should have been pres-
ent. At 800°C approximately 73% of the uranium was found as U3" by the
analytical method, and no significant loss of total uranium was noted;
the final zirconium metal additions corresponded to a cumulative 500 ex-
cess for the complete conversion of all UF, to UFs, and hence some metal
should have remained. After the final solubility measurements, the liquid
at 600°C was decanted from the reaction vessel; the solid material which
remained contained UFg apparently as a primary phase according to petro-
graphic and x-ray diffraction examinations. The uranium content of the
solid was found to be about 40 wt %, compared to 80% for the uranium con-
tent of UFz. Solubilities shown in Fig. 6.19 for 600 and 700°C were
obtained after 8 and 20 hr at temperature. Equilibrium temperatures, read
with a Pt vs Pt -~ 10% Rh thermocouple, were approached from both heating
and cooling directions. Solubilities at 650 and 550°C were found after
8 hr at equilibrium températures reached by cooling conditions. Con-
verted to mole percent, the solubilities range from about 0.1 at 550°C to
about 0.7 at 700°C.

The heat of solution, calculated from the slope of the line in Fig.
6.19, was 21.6 kcal/mole. One puzzling aspect of the analyses was that
the U*T concentration apparently remained constant at about 2 wt % over
the temperature range studied and hence that the expected equilibrium
LUF3 = 3UF, + U°, involving increasing proportions of UF, to UFg at
higher temperatures, was not recognizable. Also unexplained were the lack
of a more complete reduction in response to the excess of zirconium metal
as well as the difference from previously reported results by another
technique®® for a similar composition in which solubilities of UF5 of 0.45
mole/kg at 471°C were implied.

Development and Evaluation of Methods for the Analysis
of the Radioactive MSRE Fuel

Efforts have continued since the last report period on the develop-
ment and evaluation of methods of analysis of the radiocactive MSRE fuel.
The "mockup" hot-cell facility has been used in most of this work in order
to simulate the operating conditions necessary to analyze highly radio-
active materials. The evaluation of a pyrolysis method for the determina-
tion of fluoride has been successfully completed in the mockup facility,
and an amperometric method for the titration of chromium is being tested.
A modified technique for the determination of oxygen by inert-gas fusion
is being investigated.
136

Fluoride

The pyrolytic determination of fluoride®? is carried out in an appa-
ratus designed for remocte operation. A nickel reaction tube is first
heated to 1000°C, and moist oxygen is passed through it at a rate of about
2 liters/min. A test portion, usually 100 mg of the salt, which has been
pulverized for ease in sampling and to ensure homogeneity, is placed in a
nickel boat and mixed with about 3 g of powdered UzOg, which acts as a
catalyst for the evolution of fluoride. The boat is inserted in the heated
reaction tube, which is immediately sealed to prevent loss of fluoride.
The evolved fluoride is trapped in a known gquantity of sodium hydroxide.
After 40 min the absorber solution is removed from the apparatus, and the
excess sodium hydroxide is titrated with standard hydrochloric acid to a
potentiometric end point. The fluoride is equivalent to the sodium hydro-
xide neutralized by the absorbed hydrogen fluoride. In analyses performed
remotely on nonradioactive materials, a relative standard deviation of 1%
was obtained.

Chromium

An amperometric method for the titration of Cr(VI) with ferrous sul-
fate has been developed for the determination of chromium in MSRE fuels.
A titration cell assembly, which includes a pyrolytic graphite electrode
and a standard cglomel electrode, was specially designed for this method.
Chromium, in 5- to 50-ug quantities, is oxidized to Cr(VI) with argentic
oxide in 0.5 M HoS04. The Cr(VI) is subsequently reduced to Cr(III) by
titration with ferrcus sulfate; this reduction causes a decrease in dif-
fusion current, which is measured amperometrically. The progress of the
titration is followed with an ORNL model Q-1160 polarograph, with the
pyrolytic-graphite electrode at +1.0 respective to the S.C.E. The titra-
tion is continued until a sharp deflection in the titration curve is
observed. When the MSRE fuel is dissolved in sulfuric acid, the titration
of chromium can be performed without any prior separations. Application
of the method is now being tested in the mockup facility with nonradio-
active samples. The precision of '"bench-top" analysis is 1%, the ultimate
precision that can be expected.

Oxygen

A radio-frequency concentrator was incorporated in the ignition
chamber of the modified Leco analyzer that is being used to study the
determination of oxygen in MSRE fuels by inert-gas fusion procedures.

The purpose of the concentrater is to provide temperatures sufficient for
the evolution of oxygen as carbon monoxide from uranium and zirconium
oxides present as contaminants in the fluoride fuels.

The new ignition chamber was fabricated from a type RF-20 Sylvania
radic-frequency lamp in which the rf energy from an external coupling coil
is concentrated to heat a titanium carbide emitter (target) to tempera-
tures as high as 4100°C. The concentrator consists of a water-cooled
metal cylinder (2 in. 0.D. by 3 in. long) with its lower end open and its
upper end perforated with a 5/8—in. beveled hole in which the rf energy is
137

concentrated on the target. The cylinder is slotted on a radius. The

lamp was adapted by sealing a helium entrance tube to the bottom of the
envelope, removing the target, and sealing, over the hole in the concen-
trator, a vertical tube that serves as a loading port and gas exit line,

In operation the graphite capsule containing the sample is suspended
in the center of the hole in the concentrator from a threaded graphite
rod, which also serves to seal the capsule. The position of this capsule
is determined by an enlarged spindle that is machined on the top of the
support rod to fit the loading tube closely. At the end of the analysis
the ignited sample is removed from the ignition chamber by increasing the
gas flow to raise the capsule through the loading tube.

The maximum temperatures obtained with the concentrator have not been
messured. However, from observations of color temperature made with the
Leco generator operating at fractional power, the new ignition chamber
provides better heating than a more elaborate assembly in which the coup-
ling coil is placed within the envelope.®® Also, because the concentrator
partially shields the envelope from the heated capsule, the chamber can
be constructed of borosilicate glass rather than quartz, and a large
ground glass Jjoint is eliminated.

In initial tests with samples of uranium and zirconium oxides, re-
duction to the carbides was obtained within a 5-min ignition period. Thus
temperatures in the order of 2400°C are indicated.®® Determination of
oxygen in MSRE samples which have been analyzed by the KBrF,3° method will
be performed by comparison. '

Nickel

The statistical evaluation of nickel in MSRE fuel has been completed
in the mockup. The dimethylglyoxime spectrophotometric method with potas-
sium persulfate oxidation was employed. A solution of 1 g of MSRE fuel in
100 ml of 0.5 M HoS50, was used as the test soclution. Into a 50-ml flask
was pipetted MT5 ml of the test solution containing 39 pg of nickel. The
reagent solutions were added, with slurrying between each addition, as
follows: 30 w/v % ammonium citrate, 5 ml; saturated potassium persulfate,
10 ml; after 10 min, concentrated ammonium hydroxide, 10 ml; 1 w/v %
dimethylglyoxime in 95% alcohol, 2 ml; and distilled water (amount re-
quired to make final volume to 50 ml). The solution was allowed to stand
for 30 min, and the absorbancy was measured against a blank prepared in
the same manner, including the test solution but without the dimethyl-
glyoxime reagent. This sample blank was necessary to cancel the inter-
ference due to the uranium color and the slight change in pH caused by the
acid content of the test sample. The absorbancy was obtained with the
remotely operated filter photometer, fitted with a 450-mp filter., The
nickel content of the test sample was obtained by comparing its absorbancy
with a standard curve prepared in the same manner, containing the same
acid content but without the uranium interference. The standard curve was
prepared in this way to eliminate the need for a pH meter since the method
is pH dependent. Test solutions containing nickel concentrations as low
138

as 0.5 ug/ml can be determined by this method. The relative standard de-
viation of the method was 2.8%

Development and Testing of Equipment in the Hot-Cell Mockup

The prototype equipment for handling the transport container to re-
move the sample-filled copper ladle, known as the Transport Container
Decoupling Device, has been completed and tested. Upon continued testing,
the gear box of the bear-box-motor section proved weak. Its correction
is being studied.

In separating the powdered sample from the crushing container
(pulverizer-mixer) and copper ladle, several difficulties were encountered
with additional testing in the method previously outlined. To overcome
these, two devices were designed: one to hold and align the pulverizer-
mixer during assembly prior to pulverizing the sample and another to
effect the transfer of the powder to the polyethylene bottle from which
powdered aliquots will be taken for analysis. These new devices are
called the Pulverizer-Mixer Aligner and the Powder Transfer Device re-
spectively. Their prototypes have been tested and modified, and the
improved versions are being fabricated.

The pyrolytic apparatus for fluoride determinations has been satis-
factorily tested on MSRE fuel in the mockup. It consists of a specially
adapted 8-in. tube furnace and nickel combustion tube. The adaption
enables remote insertion and withdrawal of the nickel boat containing
the sample and catalyst plus the plugging and unplugging of the combus-
tion tube. The tube furnace is fitted with a Chromel-Alumel thermoccuple.
The thermocouple output is led outside the mockup cell and connected to a
"Sim-ply-trol" pyrometer control and a variac, thus permitting a tempera-
ture control of + 10° at 950°C.

In order to combine into a single apparatus the electrochemical
cells needed to perform amperometric, coulometric, and polarographic de-
terminations in the hot cells, a variable electrode cell system was devel-
oped. It is approximately 80% complete and is presently being used in the
ampercmetric method for the determination of chromium.

Other phases of the work necessary for handling and analyzing the
MSRE fuel samples (such as weighing and its associated problems and deter-
minations of iron, chromium, etc.) in the hot cell are in progress.

7. FUEL PROCESSING

The flowsheet for the MSRE fuel-processing system is shown in Fig.
7.1. Design of the system was reviewed, and minor changes are being
made to the drawings. Changes include provisions for remote replacement
of the NaF bed, since plugging with chromium is a possibility during
fluorination, and addition of an activated-charcoal trap to improve iodine
and tellurium removal from the off-gas system. A water analyzer for the
H,-HF treatment is being developed by the ORGDP Analytical Instrumentation
Section. It is hoped that a commercial hygrometer can be used following
an NaF trap for removal of HF.

The possibility of activity released during Hp-HF treatment and
fluorination of MSRE fuel and flush salt was reported tol and reviewed
by the Radiochemical Plants Review Committee. The released activity is
expected to be well below the limits for air contamination and radiation
level at the maximum ground concentration. The permissible releases to
prevent excessive ground contamination are lower by a factor of 10% to
104, however, and operation within these lower limits will be verified
before reactor criticality. Very low activity in the Volatility Pilot
Plant off-gas system, in addition to the much more highly reducing con-
ditions during treatment of MSRE salt, indicates that gaseous activity
should not be a serious problem during Hp-HF treatment.
