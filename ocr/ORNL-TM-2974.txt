INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment was to
demonstrate the practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept. To this
end its design! incorporated essentially the same materials and many of
the design features of proposed molten-salt power reactors. Its primary
purpose was accomplished as it was operated for more than 4 years at Qak
Ridge National Laboratory, Experience® with the MSRE was quite encouraging
and a great deal of new information (particularly with regard to fission
product behavior) was obtained, In December 1969, the reactor was shut
down because its original goals had been met and continued operation,
although offering additional information, could not be Jjustified in the
very stringent budget situation. Except for removal of an experimental
array from the core, all post-operation examination was deferred until
the next fiscal year, In the interim the reactor was placed in a standby

condition,”
GOAIS OF POST-CPERATION EXAMINATIONS

The broad goal of the post-operation examinations is to complete the
gathering of information from the MSRE by in-place inspection, removal of
specimens and some pieces of equipment, and detailed examination of these
in hot cells, Specific objectives include determination of the condition
of materials with the greatest exposure to the reactor environment, the
condition of key equipment (pumps, heaters, insulation), the location and

nature of deposits in selected parts of the fuel salt and offgas systems,

ment and systems for future molten-salt reactors,

CRITERTA

The scope of the post-operation studies will be limited to those
whose costs are Justified by the benefits to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program.
Tentative plans call for holding the radicactive fuel salt (about
360,000 curies of fission products as of July 1970) frozen in the MSRE
tanks until such time as salt mine disposal is feasible. The post-operation
examinations shall not prevent the ultimate removal of the salt nor leave
the system in an unsafe condition in the interim. 1In addition, to pre-
serve the option of fluorinating the salt for uranium recovery, the opera-
bility of the processing facility shall be preserved.

Exposure of personnel to radiation during the post-operation exami-
nation shall not exceed normal occupational limits prescribed by ORNL

and the USAEC.

STEPS IN DEFINING THE CAMPAIGN

Planning for the post-operation examination, to some extent, began
with the design of the reactor, when provisions were made for removing the
5 central bars of core graphite. Final selection of post-operation studies,
of course, had to awalt operating experience and evaluation to point out
areas of most interest and other program developments (such as the budget)
to determine what could be justified.

In February 1969, the head of the MSRE Operations Department sent a
request for suggestions for final operations and shutdown of the MSRE to
group leaders in the MSRP. Responses were consolidated to eliminate dupli-
cations and in October 1969, a tentative list of post-operation tasks was
distributed with a request for comments. This list was discussed with ORNL
and AEC-ORO reactor safety review committees and with AEC-DRDT representa-

tives, After discussion and review of the tentative list with MSRP staff
members in which benefits were weighed against costs, the program described

in the next section was arrived at in March 1970.

STUDIES AND TASKS TO BE UNDERTAKEN

The studies that we propose to make are listed in Table 1. Under
each study are listed the separate jobs, some to be done on-site, some in
X-10 hot cells, involved in that study. DNot shown in the table are the
tagks of rewoving some items for use in development facilities, decontami-
nating areas outside the containment cells, securing the plant, and dis-
posing of the fuel salt. The Justification for and objectives of each
study (in the order listed in Table 1) and each task are discussed in the
text of this section., Job descriptions, including purposes and general

procedures, are presented in the next section.

Investigation of Ieak Near Freeze Valve FV-105

A leak appeared in the primary system on December 12, 1969 shortly
after the scheduled end of nuclear operation., Correlation of changes in
cell air activities with certain operations Indicated that a small leak
had developed in or near freeze valve FV-105 (leading to fuel drain tank
FD-2) about two hours after the fuel was drained for the last time,

Amounts of xenon and iodine indicated that a few ft° of gas and perhaps some
salt (1 cc or less) escaped into the cell before the leak was effectively
stopped by freezing salt in the line,

This is the only leak that ever occurred in the primary system and
the explanation is not known. Examination of radiographs and other con-
struction records showed nothing suspicious. We believe corrosion could
not have been a significant factor in the origin of the leak, and radiation
damage at this location should be virtually nil. The most likely hypothesis
is that thermal stresses in the valve caused a crack to originate at the
welded Juncture of the cooling-air shroud and the pipe and to propagate
through the pipe wall.

We should determine the exact location and description of the lesk

and, if' possible, derive an explanation,
Examination of Surfaces Inside the Fuel-Pump Bowl

During operation of the MSRE, effects related to the salt-gas inter-
face in the fuel-pump bowl were of considerable Importance. Bubbler level
elements indicated that considerable amounts of gas were carried under the
salt surface by the xenon stripper jets. The density profile above the
bubblers could not be measured, but the fluid surface was certainly higher
because of the gas. There is reason to think that the surface was not
quite uniform (being lower inside the sampler baffle, for example), Certain
fission products tended to concentrate at salt surfaces, with perhaps some
going into the gas space as a "smoke." 01l leaked into the pump bowl from
the shaft bearing region at a few cc per day, ©Some oil decomposition pro-
ducts probably deposited on the pump bowl surfaces and some on the salt
where they may have influenced fission product separation and bubble be-

havior. Thermocouple readings indicated that fission product heating of
10

the pump bowl above the salt level was moderate but changed from time to
time for unknown reasons.

A sample capsule was dropped into the pump bowl in August 1967 and
another in March 1968. The steel cap of the first capsule was retrieved
in May 1968, There was some evidence that the second capsule was Jjammed
between the cage and baffle during recovery attempts.

We should observe surfaces inside the pump bowl for evidence of depo-
sition and the patterns displayed. It appears now that it will probably
be practical to cut out a section of the pump bowl top with the sample
cage and baffle attached. This would make 1t possible to determine much
more about the deposits and also to inspect for evidence of corrosion,
(Conditions in the vicinity of the dissimilar metal junctions in the sample
capsule are particularly interesting.) The information will aid in under-
standing the MSRE behavior and will be useful in evaluating design of off-

gas systems for future molten-salt reactors,
Examination of Reactor Vessel Internals

The effect of reactor operation on core materials was monitored by ex-
posure at the center of the core of experimental arrays containing speci-
mens of graphite and Hastelloy-N like those used in the construction of
the MSRE. Arrays were removed after 1087, 4510, 9005, 11,555, and 13,172
equivalent full-power hours., Usually the replacement array included some
subassemblies with previous exposure, so very long total exposures were
accumulated on some specimens before detalled examination and testing.

The conditions of the specimens, which were assumed to be typical of the
core, never gave any cause for concern over the condition of the core,
Although this surveillance program was presumably quite adequate, its
vallidity can be supported by examination of portions of the core graphite
and Hastelloy-N exposed from start to end of the MSRE operation,

The condition of Hastelloy-N can be determined by inspection of the
removable core access assembly, which Includes the control rod thimbles
and a plug exposed to the fuel stream in the core exit, After the assembly
has been visually inspected in the reactor cell, a portion of a rod thimble

can be cut off and examined closely in a hot cell, Metallographic
11

examination of interior surfaces will reveal any effect of the exposure

to the cell atmosphere used for cooling. The exterior surface will show
effects of very long exposure to the fuel salt. (It will not be practical
to shape specimens for physical property testing from the thimbles, but
this is unnecessary since irradiation effects were well described by the
specimens from the experimental arrays.)

Removal of one of the five central stringers will make available
graphite exposed to fuel flowing through channels with a cross section
typical of the bulk of the core. Surface appearance and penetration of
salt constituents and fission products in regions free of flaws should be
compared with results from the experimental arrays.

There was no detectable evidence of any physical damage to the core
during operation, nor did thermocouple readings on the lower head and near
the core support flange indicate any substantial accumulation of sediment,
Nevertheless, a look will be worthwhile, An optical device and light can
be used to view and photograph the top of the core and the upper head of
the reactor vessel, the lower grid structure, the bottom head, and the
drain line inlet., If loose fragments, broken graphite, sediment or other

deposits are discovered, they should be examined as closely as 1s practical.
Examination of Fuel Piping

The MSRE operated for 13,172 eguivalent full-power hours with a
temperature difference of LO°F between the fuel entering and leaving the
heat exchanger. Close examination and comparison of Hastelloy-N surfaces
exposed to fuel at the extremes of the temperature range will provide in-
formation on corrosion and mass transport under the reactor conditions.
Short sections of the 5-inch pipe near the heat exchanger inlet and be-
tween the heat exchanger and the reactor vessel should be cut out and

examined metallographically for this purpose,
Inspection of Fuel Drain Line

The Jjuncture of the fuel drain line with the reactor vessel was sub-
jected to a combination of stress and irradiation about as severe as any
in the reactor. Removal of this section is not practical, but it can be

viewed from a distance by removal of heater H-103 and insertion of viewing
12

devices in its place inside the reactor furnace., The juncture, the drain
line, and the exterior of the insulation box around the drain valve should

be scrutinized for any evidence of incipient trouble,
Examination of Charcoal Bed Inlet

During the initial escalation of the MSRE power in 1966, plugging
occurred at several points in the fuel offgas system, including the inlets
of the charcoal beds. Even after the installation of an efficient filter
(the "particle trap"), plugging recurred at the charcoal bed inlets, This
was believed to be due to polymerization of oil vapors downstream of the
filter and accumulation of the polymers on the steel wool in the entrances
of the beds. This could not be verified directly, but the restrictions
could be cleared temporarily by lowering the cooling water level around
the beds and applying heat to the inlet section. There was concern over
possible reduction of the adsorptive capacity of the charcoal by the oil
residues but no change was detectable from the few thermocouples spaced at
80-ft intervals in the bed. A short section of the inlet to one section
of the beds should be cut out and the explanation for the recurrent plugging
verified, A sample of charcoal from the inlet should be tested and if its
adsorptive capacity is seriously reduced, samples should be obtained from

further along the bed to determine the extent of the effect.
Examination of Radiator Tubing

The chromium concentration of the coolant salt remained very low
through the entire operation, indicating that corrosion was extremely low
or that corrosion-product chromium was being deposited. There were no
corrosion surveillance specimens in the coolant system, Sections of the
3/k-inch tubing should be cut from the radiator near the inlet and outlet

ends and examined for information on corrosion in the coolant systen,
Examination of Thermocouple Wells in Coolant Piping

Because of the desire to eliminate, insofar as possible, conceivable
sources of trouble, the MSRE design included only 2 thermocouple wells in
salt piping: one each at the inlet and outlet of the radiator, The pipe

with these wells should be cut out and sectioned and a careful inspection
13

made to see if the wells suffered any unusual corrosion. The pessibility
of deposition on what were to some extent "cold fingers" should also be

investigated,
Test of d/p System on Coolant Salt Flowmeter

There is a significant discrepancy between the reactor power that was
indicated by the system heat balance and the power indicated by observed
changes in isotopic ratiocs of uranium and plutonium in the fuel., The
latter indicated up to 10 percent lower power than the heat balance. The
possible reasons for the discrepancy have been checked one by one until
now only the coolant salt flow rate has not been verified as thoroughly as
possible, This must be done. The ultimate test will consist of cutting
the salt lines near the venturi flowmeter and applying signals to test the

entire transmitting and modifying systen,
Inspection of Coolant-Pump Rotary Element

The salt pumps are key components in a molten-salt reactor. Except
for the small amount of oil leakage (about 2 - 5 cc/day) into the pump
bowls, there was no problem with either the coolant-salt or fuel-salt
pump in the MSRE, The problems due to oil leakage were not serious enough
to warrant replacing the original units with seal-welded replacement rotary
elements that would have had no oil leakage into the bowl. As a result,
the original units served for the entire duration of the operation. An
inspection should be made to determine the condition of the pumps and to
permit some judgement as to remaining service life., The fuel and coolant
rotary elements are essentially the same, but the coolant pump operated
considerably longer, pumping salt for 26,076 hr compared to 21,788 hr for
the fuel pump. Since the coolant pump rotary element is also nonradio-

active and more accessible, it should be removed and thoroughly inspected,
Inspection of Control Rods

The control rods in the MSRE, of a unique, flexible design, on the
whole performed well, There were gradual changes in drop times, however,
that were attributed in part to changes in the flexibility of the rods

with long exposure and use. On occasion, rods were pulled out of the
1k

thimbles and viewed from a distance in the reactor cell for evidence of
unusual scratches or dragging. (None was found.) It was not possible to
inspect the internals of the rod or to ascribe a reason for changes in
flexibility.

The rods must be pulled to gain access to the core and at that time
the active section of one should be removed for examination in a hot cell,
The Inconel-canned Al-0=-Gd0s ceramic poison elements should be checked
for dimensional changes and the flexible metal hose and rod should be

closely inspected,
Verification of Remote Maintainability

An important goal of the MSRE was to demonstrate that maintenance of
the molten-salt reactor, with its highly radioactive fuel circulation sys-
tem, was in fact practical, To this end, the radiocactive portions, in-
cluding virtually everything in the reactor cell, were designed to be
replaceable., Replacement of core specimens, work on the offgas system,
replacement of alr-line disconnects, and repair of the fuel sampler-
enricher and in-cell heater units demonstrated the feasibility of the
general approach, Some features were not tested, however, because most
of the equipment required no maintenance, It would be worthwhile to try
certain of these features., The difficulty of replacing the fuel-pump
motor should be determined by removing the old motor or at least loosening
several of the flange bolts. The flanged section of the sampler tube,
which was designed to be swung out of the way for pump bowl replacement
should be removed as intended., (This needs to be done in preparation for

cutting into the pump bowl.)
Removal of Coolant Salt Pump Bowl and Piping

It has been proposed that a fluoroborate technology test loop be con-
structed, using the MSRE coolant pump and other portions of the coolant
salt system, ©Since portions ouwtside the reactor cell are not radioactive,
removal would be a straightforward task that can be done when needed. The
only consideration is that lines leading into the reactor cell be sealed,

since they are penetrations of the containment envelope.
15

Recovery of MSRE Coolant Salt

 

Salt for a proposed loop to test gas injection and stripping tech-
nology can be prepared most economically by adding ThF, and LiF to the
MSRE coolant szlt, The coolant salt, 2610 kg of LiF-BeF- (66 - 34 mole
percent), should be melted and removed when required for this purpose.
This operation will also test some aspects of techniques that may be used

eventually in disposal of the fuel salt,

Decontamination

 

The spread of radicactivity during the work described above will be
controlled by proper ventilation, temporary containment enclosures, the
establishment of contamination zones, and other techniques that have been
proved in use at the MSRE and elsewhere in CORNL. When necessary during
the campaign and at its conclusion, some of the contaminated tools and
material will be disposed of and the rest will be decontaminated., Before
the task is finished, everything outside the containment will be decon-

taminated to safe levels,

Securing the Plant

 

There is currently no demand for the fissile material in the MSERE
fuel salt (37 kg U, 84% EB%J). Because of the extremely high =33 content
(220 ppm) and consequent radiation problems, it is doubtful that the
uranium will ever be worth the cost of recovery from the salt., We propose
to keep the fuel salt frozen in the MSRE drain tanks, safely contained
until developments make it possible to decide on the optimum method of
disposal, Meanwhile the option of stripping the uranium by the fluoride
volatility process will be retained by preserving the M3RE processing
plant.

The MSRE reactor cell and drain tank cell will be resealed after the
examination work is completed, Service lines into the cells which were
left connected to the ancillary systems during the interim period will be
capped to minimize chances of accidental openings. The reactor equipment
that is heavily contaminated with fission products will be retained within

the cells and the offgas containment system. (As of July 1970, the total
16

fission product activity in the salt and elsewhere in the reactor will
amount to about 360,000 curies.) Some radioactive items with little or
no transferable activity may be placed in other shielded cells in the re-
actor building. Radiation zones will be defined, marked and secured as
required by ORNL procedures., The conditions in the reactor, cells, and
building will continue to be monitored remotely by the Central Waste Moni-
toring Group at ORNL. Access to the reactor building and grounds will be
strictly controlled by the existing system of fences, gates, and guard

service.

Disposal

Items that are not required for the containment of the radioactivity
nor for the possible future operation of the processing facility will be
identified and advertised. Those items whose removal can be Jjustified by
Program needs will be removed. ©Such removal will be planned and super-
vised to guard against inadvertent compromise of the continuing needs of
the MSRE,

The safety of the plant will be reviewed periodically by appropriate
groups 1in ORNL,

We expect that eventually it may become desirable to transfer the
fuel salt, containing the fissile material and the bulk of the fission
products, to a more permanent waste storage situation. The best way to
get the salt out would now appear to be to cut the line from the salt
fluorination tank to the experimental salt still and transfer batches of
molten salt into transport containers connected at that point. It would
also be feasible to pull salt into containers through a dip tube installed
through the drain tank access port. After the bulk of the activity is re-
moved this way, 1if there 1s no foreseeable need for eguipment in the re-
actor and drain cells, the cells can be filled in and closed to provide

permanent containment for the remaining activity.
17

JOB DESCRIPTIONS

This section gives some additional detail on the jobs that will be

SCHEDULE

Some of the non-radioactive work, such as that on the coolant system,
may begin before July 1, 1970 if funds are available, Before the work in
the reactor cell and drain tank cell can commence, tools must be procured
and tested, detailed procedures must be developed, and the plans must be
reviewed and approved by program and safety groups. A target date of
July 6 has been set for the beginning of the in-cell work.

Table 2 shows the sequence of in-cell work that now appears most
logical, progressing generally from jobs involving less chance of contami-
nation to those likely to involve the most contamination of the cell,
tools, and shielding, The estimated dates tend to be optimistic since
they include no allowance for "unusual' delays. Although critical-path
scheduling was used in planning maintenance and modification work through-
out the operation of the MSRE, this type of diagram is not shown here be-
cause the in-cell work requiring the portable maintenance shield falls on
a single path and most of the other work can be done as "fill-in" jobs
whenever it is most convenient,

A goal will be to have virtually all the work of securing the plant
finished by October 2, 1970. Hot-cell work and analyses should be com-
pleted by December h, 1970. These dates may be extended if, for example,

it is more economical to do so than to work overtime.

STATUS

As of April 10, the general strategy has been decided for each job
and plans have been sketched in enough detail to establish confidence in
the feasibility (by one means or another) of all the important jobs. A
shear and plasma torch have been selected for procurement, other tools and
the maintenance shield are being readied, and the prototype fuel pump is
on hand to be set up in the maintenance practice cell as a mock-up for

developing the procedure for cutting into the pump bowl.
