INTRODUCTION

In order to fully realize the potential of nuclear regctor systems
utilizing molten fluoride salts as'fuel, the structural materials must
possess adequate combinations of strength, ductility, and corrosion
reSistance at temperatures in the 1100-1500°F temperature'?ange. Thé
non-age-hardenable nickel-moiybdenum-chromium-iroﬁ élloy, designated as
INOR-8 [Ni-17 Mo~7 Cr-5 Fe (wt %) ] is such an'alloy and was the culmina-
tion of a comprehensive alloy development and evaluation program carrigd
out at the Oak Ridge National L:atboraa:l;o:c';;r.J"‘3 It is now commerciélly
available®* and is the primary containment material for the Molten Saxt
Reactor Experiment which achieved criticality on June 1, 1965, at Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. A vital part of the overall welding study on INOR-8
was the determination of the ‘elevated-temperature mechanical properties
of welds. This report summarizes the findings on the mechanical behavior

of'welds‘in some of the actual heats of material used in the MSRE.

'MATERIALS, TESTING PROGEDURE AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Transverse samples'machined from 1-in.-thick welds, made under

highly restrained conditions were used in the testing. These butt welds

were fabricated in the manner illustrated in Fig. 1 and described in

earlier work.? The transverse tensile specimens used were of the -

was used to fabricate the joints; the filler metal used was of the

same nominal composition as the base metal.

The INOR-8 material used

in this study was taken ffom the stock purchased for construction of

the MSRE. The heat numbers and the tests to which each heat of INOR-8

was subjected are tabulated below.

The chemical analyses of these heats are presented in Table 1. Note

that the filler metal used to fabricate the weld specimens was teken

from heat numbers 5055 and 5090.

Because of material fabrication schedules, it was necessary to do

the welding operations on platé which had the final rolling operation

performed normal to the welding direction.

This schedule caused the

Y

materials' inherent stringer line to be located in the plate-thickness

- direction and parallel to the fusion line.

| orientation of the stringer formation with respect to tﬁe fusion line
‘and its pérpendicular orientation with respect to the welding dire¢tion
and specimen axis.

The transverse weld specimens contained weld metal, hé;t—affected
iones, and base metal and were tested at elevated temperatures in
sténdard tensile tests (0.03 min-') and in creep tests. Elevated-

_ fempérature tensile tests were performed between 600 and 1800°F at

200°F intervalé, and creep testing was dOne at 1100, 1300 and 1500°F.
The specimeﬁs were tested in both the as-welded.and stress-relieved
conditions, with stress relieving béing performed in bbth argon and
-hydrogen atmospheres (2‘hr aﬁ 1600°F). Samples were also machined from
the as-received base metal for the'determinationof elevated-température
hot ductility after being subjected to simulated heat-affected zone
thermal cycles.

The room- and elevated-temperature tensile tests were run in air
using a standard 12,000-1b capacity hydraulic testing machine at a
crosshead speed of 0.05 in./min or a strain rate of 3.33%/min. Stress-
strain relationships were obtained using load cell-deflectometer out-
puts. Elevaﬁed-temperature tests were performed using a clamshell-

- type furnace, in which specimens were allowed a 1/2-hr equilibration

period to reach the test temperature. Thé results of these tests for

the as-welded and stresé—:elieved conditions are pfesented in Tables

2 and 3 for test temperatures between room temperature and 1800°F.
Thercreep tests were run in air using standard lever arm testing

machines, and stfain data were obtained through dial-gage extensometers

attached to the specimen grips, A detailed ta‘bulaﬁion of the average
vaiues of the creepQrupture teét results are giveh in Table 4.

All heat treatments prior to'testing were'cérried out in either an
argon or hydrogen atmosphere. . The specimens were cooled from the annealing
temperature by pulling them from the hot zone into the water-cooled end
of the furnace muffle. Thermocouples, which weré attached to the speci-
mens during the heat treatment, recorded an average cooling rate down to
500°F of épproximately 250°F/min.~The thermal tfeatment uéed, 2 hr at
1600°F, is the standard stress relieving treatment specified for INOR-8
material, | ’

A‘convenient method for measuring overall weldabiliﬁy is a hot
ductility test, which has been developed by Nippes and Savage of
Rensselaer Poly'techn-ic’Institute.4 This test synthetically reproduces,
in a 1aboratory specimen, the time-temperature cycle experienced'by any
selected point in the heat-ﬁffected zone of aﬁ arc weld. Sampies were
taken from all the heats tabulated previously (p. 4) and subjected to

this hot ductility test. The results of these tests will be treated in

the following sectién.

DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION OF RESULTS

Tensile Tests

The average tensile properties of épecimens in.the as-welded
condition'(heats 5062, 507i and 5074), hydrogen stress-relieved con-
dition (heats 5070 and 5073), and argon stfess-relieved condition
(heats 5064, 5075 and 5081) are presented in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. These
figures show ultimate tensile strength, 0.2% offset yield strength and
elongation vs temperature. The scatter bands for wrought metal shown
in the figures were teken from earlier work. ?

A'qualification'on the ccmbarisons between transverse weld éamfle
properties and wrought metal properties shouid be made at this point.
figure 7 illustrates specimen aﬁd stringer orientations which were
encountered in these two classes of specimens.  Note thaf, as previously
mentioned, the material fabrication scheduies resulted in the stringers
of the transverse weld samples being oriented normal to the stress direc-
tion. This stress direction is the y-direction in Fig. 7. The wrought
material investigation5 done previously did not inélude specimens cut
parallel to the y-direction. The fact that these plates were notrthick
enough to yield reasonably large specimens in the y-direction plus the
assumption of symmetry of properties sbout the z-axis led to the omission.

| Only slight variations in ultimate strengths were observed
between the as-welded and stress-relieved tests; although, at the lower
testing temperatures these stgengthsrwere,less than those for'the |
wrought metal, In the case of the yield strengths noticeable differences
existed between the as-welded samples and stress-relieved_samples. As-

welded specimen yield strengths were consistently higher than those of

specimens tested after stress reliev1ng, no difference in annealing atmos-

phere was-observed except at room temperature. Yield strengths for trans-

. verse specimens in all conditions were‘generally higher than the wrought

metal yield strengths.
The total elongation data, presented in Tables 2 and 3 and depicted

graphically in-Fig;'G, show that the overall ductility of welds is less
i .

than that observed in the wrought metal. However, this difference is

;_ probably due to the specimen orientation, as previously explained Stress

reliev1ng produces 8 general improvement of this property at all test

 temperatures, with argon prOV1ding a sllghtly better atmosphere than

hydrogen.
The macrographs of Figs. 8, 9, and 10 illustrate the variations in

fracture location with each heat and with test temperature. The as-welded

tests in heat 5074 of Fig 8'exhibit failures in the base metal, except at

1400 and 1600°C w1th low ductilities (Table 2) &s compared with the weld
metal failures in heat 5062 of Fig. 9. The variation of fracture loca-

tions with temperature for the stress-relieved'heat_5070 (Fig. 10) is .

',typical of specimens tested in this condition.

On the basis of the data presented above on the ultimate and yield

'strengths the assumption of symmetry in strength properties seems Justified.
-”.pThe ductility data however, and in particular the ductility of those spe-
= cimens which fractured predominantly in the base metal,,suggest that the

-strain-at-fracture properties of INOR-B are not symmetrical about the

7 axis., ' ,T'JT;§ U

Metallographic examination was performed on one heat tested in the
as-welded condition (5074) and one heat in the stress-relieved condltion

(5073). The micrographs shown in Fig. 11A and 118 for the 1800°F tests

are representative of the base metal failures of all the tensile tests.
All failures, whether in the base metal or weld metal, were generally
intergranular, As noted by'McCoy,6 mest of the small base metel cracks-
appear to ﬁave been initiated by'cracks'in the'precipitates; Here, as in
McCoy's work, the intergranular cracks are predominantly normal te the
applied stress with their lengths comparable to the grain diametef. As can

be seen in Fig. 11, the cracks are parallel to and exist primarily in the

‘stringer line.

Creep-Rupture Tests

/
s

Cfeep-rupture Qata'for specimens in the as-welded and argon or

| hydrogen stress-relieved conditions are presented graphically in Figs.
12-15. Average values of rupture time vs applied stress at 1100, 1300
and 1500°F are presented in Fig. 12. These studies indicate that as-
welded specimens possess stress-rupture strengths!equivalent to those of

the base metal at all test temperatures, Stress relieving, using a hydro-

gen atmosphere, created a significant improvement in the creep properties of‘

samples tested at 1300°F. A factor of two improvement was noted in both the
time-to-rupture and the total strain propexties when this treatment vas em-
ployed (see Table 4). The creep-rupture tests on stress-relieved samplesr
at 1100 and 1500°F showed little or no improﬁement over as-welded proper-‘
ties.- The curves of Fig. 13 illustrate the stress-temperature relationships
necessary to cause rupture in 10, 100 and §OO hr for thesexcomposite speci-
mene. ‘The improvement over the as-welded strength at 1300°F by stress
relieving in hydrogen at 1600°F for 2 hr is vividly shown in this figure. -
The minimum creep fate for tests on ae-ﬁelded and stress-relieved

specimens, shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively, was generaliy observed.

" to those discussed above for the short time ten51le tests. The weld |

the motion of the grain'boundaries and cause them to be quite irregular.

| These boundaries etch rapidly_and.appear quite,broad; indicating that,
possibly, an impurity 1ayer'ispresent. Earlier studies have shown that
by very rapid cooling from very high temperatureS'(2500°F),,the-pre-
cipitate or stringer particles appear to be converted to an 1ntergranular
lamellar product Gross - formation of this product throughout the heat-
affected zone of INOR-8 welds could cause permanent damage, resultlng in
almost certain failure under high restraint. The hot ductility tests
-conducted here do not.indicate that this condition is a‘serious problem

for the material investigated.
- CONCLUSIONS

It appears from this.study that the room- and elevated—temperature

mechanical properties of welds in INOR-8 compare favorably With the

base metal propertlesf' Tensile testing of these transverse specimens
.showed_that this material possessed a good combination of strength and
.ductility.' Stress relieving.producedthe general effect of'lowering
the.0.2% offset yield;strength.. The.creep studies of_as#Welded samples
'indicated that they possessed'stress?rupture properties equivalent to
rthose of base metal at all test temperatures. Stressrelieving, uSing-

a hydrogen atmosphere, caused a significant improvement in the creep

jmproperties of samples tested at 1300°F Heat-affected zone hot ductility

'1pexperiments establlshed the nil-ductility temperature for this material

o _to be 2300°F, with reasonable mechanical property recovery after

o ;experiencing th1s temperature.‘l
