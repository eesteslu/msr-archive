PREFACE

A record of the methods of maintaining the radioactive portlons
of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is presented in this
report. In Section 2, overall descriptions are given of the components
and the methods of maintenance. Section 3 presents the procedures
written from the standpoint of the people who perform the work. The
Appendix lists reference material that will be useful when detailed
information is required.

The report was originally prepared before the MSRE began power
operation and thus before there was any experience in radiocactive ‘
maintenance of it. Since that time, the MSRE has been operated and
maintained successfully, and we have had the opportunlty to observe
how our maintenance plans have worked. In general, our basic methods
and original planning have served quite well.

There is one aspect of our experience, however, that bears on

the materisl contained herein. We have found that changes in tools,

methods, reactor equipment, and administration of the maintenance
operation make it necessary to prepare new and fully detailed
procedures for most shutdown‘work. These procedures are then used
to implement the functlonlng of a complex operation involving many
people. Therefore the procedures in this report reflect present
methods but not the full detail that is actually required.

- ABSTRACT -

A record of the methods of maintéining the radio-
active portions of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE) is presented. The maintenance system utilizes

long-handled tools operated through & movable shield

for most of the in-cell manipulations. For some
radioactive transfer and setup tasks that cannot be
handled otherwise, a crané that is operated remotely
from a shielded control room is used. Overall
descriptions are given of the components and the
methods of maintenance, the procedures written from
the standpoint of the people who perform the work are

presented. Reference material that will be useful

when detailed information is required is included.

- -1, INTRODUCTION

The MSRE is a 7.5-Mwt circulating-fuel reactor in which.?ssU
fuel dissolved in a solution of lithium and beryllium fluorides
is pumped around a closed loop at 1200° F. A drawing of the reactor
arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. The reactor plant was completely

-described in this series of reports by Robertson.1 Some of the

advantages of this reactor concept are related directly to the
liquid nature of the fuel and are due to the éase of moving the
bulk of the fuel inside piping systems, removing reactor poisons,
reprocessing to remove fission products, and adding new fissionable
material to make up for burnup. However, the same liquid property
causes radioactivity to be distributed throughout the primary

- systems. Therefore special means are required for maintaining all

the equipment that comes in contact with or is physically near the

" fuel salt and off-gas systems. The demonstration of capability in

this area became one of the primary objectives of the program.

The maintenance system includes many different kinds of
equipment located both in and out of the radioactive areas. Besides
physical equipment, & certain amount of informetion must also be
considered as part of our maintenance system. This information

‘exists as written procedures, drawings, photographs, and "know-how"
‘of trained experienced personnel

Early in the program.it was!recognized that the design of each
component had to include provisions for maintenance, and the steps
in the achievment of this goal included a design surveillance

. program. Thus those who had the maintenance responsibility had an

opportunity to influence the system and component design in the
early stages.. This activity toock varying degrees of participation

from consultation and approval to detailed designs and layouts.

Surveillance of the design was followed by a similar program during

‘the construction, assembly, and installation stages. Accompanying:

the field work of 1nsta111ng reactor components was & demonstration
and practice program in which selected components were handled with
remote-maintenance tools and methods. Many corrections were made
during this period to inmprove the basic designs and to correct
fabrlcatlon errors and maintenance techniques. In general, the

- process consisted of doing whatever was necessary to make the system
7 ,malntainable. The surveillance program and the demonstration
_ program were logical methods of assuring the malntalnabllity of the

system before power operation. These programs had the further

result of producing a nucleous of experlenced personnel at the

beginning of power operation at the MSRE, which has since been
expanded in the course. of several shutdowns to an adequate and

competent group. The recognition of the individual component nature
of the maintenance problem, the design and construction surveillance
effort, the demonstration program at the reactor, and the utilization
of developed personnel skills are parts of the approach used to assure
the maintainability of the MSRE.

 
 

 

 

 

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM

2.1 Maintenance EQuipment and General Methods

The system provided to maintain the MSRE is based on the
requirement that any failed component be replaceable with a new
interchangeable spare. Decontamination and subseguent repair of
failed components have been found to be possible and economically
attractive. However, decontamination and repair are not considered
to be the primary methods for maintenance. :Little effort. has.been
made to effect in-place repair. A major effort was made however
to achieve good component reliability. As the result of a combination
of many influences, the maintenance system was made flexible, simple,
rugged, and low cost. All the equipment that can be approached
directly is designed for conventicnal maintenance. This report is
concerned only with the equipment that cannct be approached directly
because of radioactivity. :

The four principal locations where remote maintenance is required
are the reactor cell, the drain tank cell, the venthouse, where there
is access to the off-gas system components, and the fuel-processing
cell. Fairly uniform methods are used for all these cells. The
ability to remove and replace every operating component in these N
areas has been accomplished through the use of appropriate disconnects
and mountings. The 5-in. circulating-system piping is joined by
mechanical disconnects consisting of the freeze flange developed
especially for molten-salt service. The 1-1/2-in,.fill-and-drain
system piping is of all-welded construction. Future joints will
be made by cutting and brazing with a technique developed especially
for this service. Piping conducting other fluids is connected by
ring-joint flanges or cone-seal disconnects. Electrical and instrument
wiring has plug-in disconnects constructed of materials suited to-
the environment. All the joinmts and disconnects are designed to be
readily operable from directly overhead. They are described in detail
later. The major components, such as the reactor vessel, the heat
exchanger, the pump, and the drain tank, as well as the smaller
components, such as the pipe and vessel heaters, valves, and motors,
are so disposed and mounted that after being disconnected they can
be removed by lifting straight upward.

The maintenance equipment design provides for the operation of
all the disconnects and the replacement of the smaller components
by the use of relatively simple long-handled tools operated directly
through the portable maintenance shield. The portable maintenance
shield can be placed over and will cover the opening left by the
- removal of two of the lower shield plugs, a space 4 ft. wide and up
' to 10 long. There are a variety of penetrations for inserting
lighting, viewing devices, and tools. An opening can also be
created through which small components will pass. A penetration
may be placed anywhere in the opening covered by the shield by a.

series of controlled movements. The design and use of the portable
maintenance shield are described in detail later. The -major components
are too large to pass through an opening 4 ft. wide and their removal
thus requires that a large portion of the cell top shielding be
removed and that remote-handling techniques be used. For this

‘operation, a shielded maintenance control room, remotely operated

cranes, and closed-circuit television were provided. The maintenance
control room (Fig. 2) overlooks the reactor cell, the drain tank cell,
and the building interior through shielding windows. It contains

controls for the 30-ton crane, the 10-ton crane, and the monitors for

the television system. Lift fixtures are provided that can be picked

up by crane and which, inturn, will pick up, transport. and release
the lower shield blocks and.beams and each of the magor components.

2.2 Maintenance Control Rodm and Facilities for Remote Operation

‘The maintenance control room and facilities for remote operation
consist of the remote maintenance control room; 30- and 10-ton cranes
operable from the control room; 1ift tongs for the lower shield blocks
for the reactor cell and drain-tank cell; lift fixtures for the

‘reactor vessel, heat exchanger, fuel pump, and drain tanks; and a

closed~circuit television system. The remote facilities are to be
used during any maintenance operation that requires the s;multaneous
removal of more than two lower shield blocks. Anticipated operations
in this category are replacement of the reactor vessel, the heat
exchanger, the pump bowl, and the drain and flush tanks.

_ The maintenance coﬁtrpl rdcmlhas'3-l/2-ft-thick concrete walls
to provide adequate shielding for any maintenance operation; three -

" windows to provide a view of the cells and building interior; crane,
-television, and lightlng controls, and radiation monitors, ventilation,

sanitary facllities and lights. Its floor is 10 ft. above the building
main floor and its interior dimensions are 14 by 19 ft. Personnel -

~access to the room is by an outside stairway on the west side of the
~ building. Equlpment access 1s by al x k- ft hatch 1n'the celllng. -

The ten-ton crane has flve speeds in. each of six directions

_controllable dlrectly from-a push-button pendant in the main building
or from a dial and toggle-switch console in the malntenance control
- room. - The signals from:the maintenance control room to the crane

travel via a trailing cable that must be connected by a cannon-type
plug located at the west end of the brldge when remote control is

~ desired; it is disconnected at all other times. This crane was ‘
 rereeved for a hook travel from 875 ft 10-1/2 1n.to 823 ft 6 in. eleva%mon_
~ and is nov actually rated at 7-1/2 tons. L |

‘The 30-ton crane-has flverspeeds in each directioh‘contrbilaﬁle

~ from the cab and three speeds in each direction controllable from

a dial and toggle-switch console in the maintenance control room.
It also has a power-driven rotating hook controllable from either
point, and a load cell with an indicator in the maintenance control

room. The remote-control sighals are transmitted via trolley wire

-and need not be disconnected. The main circuit breaker for both

cranes is in a shieldéd area under the mafntenance control room and
is accessible during a remote-maintenance operation.

There are four-point (Fig:. 3) and two-poinmt lifting tongs for
the lower shield blocks, and a lifting tong for the lower shield
beams.  The bails fit the hook of the 30-ton crane. The tongs lock

- alternately in the open and closed positions each time they are

picked up and set down. The sequence of operationsfor the tongs is

as follows: engage the crane hook in the bail and raise the tongs

(now locked in the open position); lower the tongs onto the plug

with the hooks in the lifting points until the tong weight is off

the crane; raise the tongs, which will automatically lock in the closed
position, and raise the shield plug; transport the load and lower it

~ until the tong welght is off the crane hook; raise the tongs, which

will now automatically lock in the open position, and release the
load. :

A lifting fixture is provided for each of the major camponents.
BEach fixture can be picked up and released by the crane and can in
turn pick up and release its component through use of the remotely
operated crane. These fixtures are on hand and have been used.

The television system consists of three cameras mounted on
pan and tilt mechanisms, two monitors, and a set of controls. For
a remote-maintenance operation the cameras are mounted in the
building on movable stands, as shown in Fig. 4, so as to command
two views of the operation which, along with the direct view through
the shielding window, provide complete coverage of the work area.
The use of orthogonal positioning of the cameras provides a feeling
of depth. The remote controls operate the pan, tilt, focus, zoom,
and iris. ' - '

2.3 Portasble Maintenance Shield

A portable maintenance shield was designed and fabricated to

‘provide shielding for maintenance operations with long-handled tools.

It shields the access area produced when any two adjacent lower roof
blocks are removed from the reactor or'the drain tank cells, It

'jaccommodates the long-handled tools, the lower shield blocks in both
reactor and drain tank cells, and some of the in-cell equlpment, and -

it is operated from the remote-malntenance control room. Figures

‘The portable malntenance shleld con51sts of four. ba81c components:

 slide, modules, frame, and track. The slide is a slab of shielding

whose dimensions are 12 in. thick by 5 ft wide and either 8-1/2 or
13 ft long dépending on the usage. The slide includes a circular
cutout that accommodates & 35-in.-diam. geared plug. The plug,

in turn, has a series of cutouts for lights, windows, and tools.

The slide rolls on wheels and is moved by a drive motor.

The filler modules are additional short sections of shielding | ‘ .
that can be added to the main slide to allow positioning of tool holes '
. above the desired work area. Most of the long-handled tool operatlons
are done through a module referred to as the rotating work plug. ' -
This module, which is assembled next to the slide, contains a 22-in. '
diameter rotatable-plug mounted eccentrically within a 50-in.-diam.
plug. This arrangement provides the necessary reach to permit tool
" access over any point within the block opening. A special hole layout
within the inner plug permits multiple tool access to the reactor freeze
flanges, as specifically required for flange maintenance., The plugs
are operated manually through a geared drive to allow precise
positioning of their multiple openings. 'A tool access cutout is
located on the edge of the rotating work plug to provide means of
inserting or withdrawing large tools or items of equipment. This is
sometimes called the "split section of the rotating plug.” All
modules and plugs are 12 in. thick and fabricated from carbon steel. -

The frame, constructed of heavy steel plate, serves as the
support for the slide. After the frame is installed over a pair
of lower shield blocks, the slide is moved to an end track to permit
the removal of the blocks, and an opening 52 by 127 in. is provided.
The plugs are removed by operating the cranes from the remote-
maintenance control room and then returning the slide to a position , .
over the cell opening to provide complete shielding for personnel. ;
A 3/4-hp motor and gearbox cambination mounted on the frame moves
the slide through a rack-and-pinion arrangement.  The rate of travel o
is about 2 in./sec. ' Electrical limit stops, backed up by movable
mechanical stops, are provided to limit travel as desired. The motor
controls are connected to the maintenance control room operatlng station
with & cable. : -

The track is an extension to the frame that can be mounted at
either end of the frame and on which the slide and module rollers
move. It consists of "I" beams with channel and angle bracing.

A shielding thickness of 12 1n. of steel is prov1ded throughout
(slldes, modules, and frame sides and ends). This shielding is
sufficient to limit radlatlon levels 24 hr following reactor shutdown
to about 10 mr/hr.

The series of holes through the Shleldlng that are used for long-
‘handled tools, lights, and windows are provided with various fillers
or inserts. Some of these contain 150-w lighting fixtures. Some

are of a split-bushing design to accommodate tools of various *
diesmeters. - Some inserts contain a drilled lead ball through which _ :
tools may be inserted and "swung" into positions other than directly - .,
underneath the work hole. One 8-in,-diam. and one 5-1/2 in.-diam. .

lead-glass window can be mounted simultaneously for direct viewing. ‘ kiJ

2.4 Jigs and Fixtures for Assembling MSRE Components

The philosophy of remote maintenance involves the replacement
of failed components; therefore connection members and mounting
dimensions must be the same for the failed and the replacement.
components. Jigs and fixtures are used to make it possible to
replace the major components in the reactor and drain-tank cells,
The following components were fitted to a jig as they were assembled
or, a jig was fabricated to fit the as-built component.

2.4,1 Reactor Cell Components

 

- The major reactor cell components that can be removed and
replaced are the reactor vessel, the heat exchanger, the pump bowl,
the rotary element of the pump, and the pump motor. A jig was
designed for these major components-so that all replacement
components could be fabricated on the one jig assembly, or the jig
could be broken down into sections to accommodate single components.
A separate jig is available for use if only the pump rotary element
or the pump is to be replaced This Jjig makes it possible to
duplicate the auxiliary flanges and dlsconnects in their ex1st1ng
locations. After the space coolers were installed in the reactor
and drain tank cells and all piping and electrical connections were
made, they were removed and a jig was built to fit the unit. This
jig makes it possible to duplicate the flange and electrical disconnects,
as well as the support steel for the unit. _

The basic parts of a jig were also prepared for the component
cooling valves., After the valves were installed and all piping was
completed the valves were removed and placed on the jigs, and holes
were drilled to locste flanges, air lines, disconnects, etc. These
holes were identified for each valve and thus any valve in the
system can be duplicated.

2.4.2 Drain-Tank Cell Components

 

A jig was used to assemble the drain tanks and steam domes,
and the elevations and orientations of all piping flanges and
thermocouple disconnects were established with Fixtures attached
to the jig. The flll—and-flush tank was assembled inh the same jig,
and the helium valves were fitted to the valve jig described for
the component cooling—qlr valves,

2.5 FTeezeuFlange Maintenance

The major components 1n'the reactor cell are connected gy the
five 5-in. freeze flanges described previously by Robertson.

-

These flanges are designed so that they can be separated and remade
remotely with tooling operated through the portable maintenance shield.
The layout of the reactor system piping, imposed by other factors, .
dictates that the sequence of opening the flanges for replacement of
any component be limited to opening the flanges on the coolant end

of the heat exchanger first, then on the fuel end of the heat exchanger,
and finally the flange that connects the reactor to the suction of -
the pump. This sequence is responsible for the rather lengthy
procedure required to remove a defective gaeket'ln‘freeze'flange

FF 100, and must be taken into. account whenever plannlng a speclflc
maintenance task. ~ . . - -

2.5.1 Operations Required for Gasket Replacement

. The operations of breaking and making a flanged joint involve:
the following procedure, which is broken down into steps corresponding
to the tool used.  The disassembly consists of

1. Fbrclng clamp off the flange and thus rellev1ng all gasket
sealing force,

2, Hanging the cleamp assembly on & bracket installed 'in the cell,

3. Jacking the faces of the flanges apart to get at the gasket and
to provide clearance for displacing components.,

4. Removing the ring-gasket assembly,
5. Covering the open flanges to prevent spread of contamination.

The reassembly procedure, which is the reverse of the above,
and which is done with the same tools, has one extra requirement:
the flange faces must be realigned as they are being jacked together
(reverse of step 3) to assure good gasket sealing. Throughout these
steps, viewing is provided principally by the periscope, with its
various lenses. The periscope is supplemented by windows in the
shield and, when necessary, by long-handled mirrors.

2.5.2 Realignment and Gasket Sealing

 

The freeze flange assembly, which is shown in Fig. 9, consists
of the flange body containing the gasket groove, the gasket assembly,
the clamps, the guide rods, the dlsassembly beams, and the lifting
eyes. The gasket loading force is derived from the ‘strain in the
horseshoe section of the clamp, which is sprung open a nominal .
0.100 in. when the clamp is forced onto the flange. Forces encountered
in seating the clamp on assembly and disassembly operations range
from 16 to 34 tons. It is necessary to put the clemps on symmetiically
for two reasons. First, symmetrical loading produces the best
gasket -sealing condition, and second, unsymmetrical assembly would
cause galling and “"digging in" and thereby increase the required

assembly forces. OSymmetrical assembly is achieved by using care in ‘

handling and operating the remote tooling. Also there are guide

rods that help center the clamp through their close engagement with s
the ears on the flange. The guide rods also serve to connect the ‘ :

‘upper and lower half of the clamp assembly so that it can be handled

as one unit. The disassembly beams carry the loads imparted by , «
the remote tooling from the clamps into the flange when taking the

clamps Off. The lift eyes are prov1ded to handle the clamp assembly

2. 5 3 Permanently Installed Maintenance Eqplpment

Some items of equipment that in general serve to simplify the
remote maintenance operation were permanently installed at each
freeze flange. For example, under the piping at each flange there
is a 5-ton worm-gear screw jack that terminates in a remctely operable
"hex head, complete with hook, supports, and drive trains. This
Jjack provides forces in the axial direction of the piping to spread.
- apart or bring together the flange faces. There are also permanently
- installed, slotted brackets that act as anchor points to align flange
faces in the radial direction, and there are supports that hold the
freeze-flange clamp assembly in the stowed position when the flanges
are separated.

2.5.4 Hydraulic Clamp Operator

 

"

As mentioned above, the horseshoe-shaped section of a fully seated
clamp is sprung open a nominal 0.100 in. to produce a gasket load
of approximately 200,000 1b. The force required to seat a clamp *
ranges from 16 to 34 tons and is applied remotely by the pair of '
hydraulic clamp operator tools shown in Fig., 10. Each consists of
a long mast carrying a 20-ton 13- 1/2 in. stroke hydraulic ram. Its
cylinder is attached to a stationary outer frame, and the piston
is attached to an inner frame. Extending the ram moves the inner
frame down toward the stationary member. By engaging the outer
frame under appropriate surfaces on the clamp assembly and the inner
frame over them, the tool can accomplish the required jobs of -assembly
and disassembly. These are shown in Fig. 10. Engaging the tools
onto these surfaces remotely is made somewhat easier by aligning
assembly marks on the tool with the proper surface on the 1n-cell
equipment.

 

2.5.6 Clamp-Handling Tool

When the clamps have been separated, the "clamp handling" tool
- is used to transport the clamp assembly out of the way and to store

it so that the flanges can be spread apart. This tool consists of - .

a pair of hooks installed on the end of a long mast and spaced to

engage a pair of eyes on the upper clamp. When the hooks are engaged . s
- the tool is raised slowly, and it 1lifts the upper clamp until it —

contacts the underside of the upper beam. Because of the restricted . iﬁ) _

vertical clearance between the guide-rod jaws and the flange ears,

be separated. This is accomplished with the jacks (Dwg. E-GG-E-41865)
mounted in the cell beneath the piping. As mentioned above, these

are 5-ton worm-gear screw Jjacks that are engaged and operated remotely
by rotating hex-head drives with ordinary socket wrenches on long
handles. The jack hook engages with and transmits force through jack
bars mounted on the piping-support instellation (Dwg. E-GG-E-41860).

To avoid restricting the motion of the piping due to thermal expansion,
the jacks must be left disengaged during reactor operation. For
maintenance they must be engaged to the piping to provide the forces
required for opening flanges and for moving components., '

 

2.5.8 Gasket-Handling Tool

_ The gasket handling tool is used to replace a ring-gasket assembly.
The tool is long-handled pliers with a stationary upper jaw. The
moveble lower jaw which is operated from the top of the tool, engages
slots on the inside of the ring away from the four sealing surfaces.

On the vertical center line of the gasket there is & small bracket
that carries a pin to lock the gasket to the flange until the flanges
, - are pushed together. This detail is shown in Fig. 12. The pin has ' *

0.045 in. clearance inside a hole tapped in the flange at a corresponding
" location. Thus, the pin can .be slipped into the hole readily by

means of the handling tool. The pin has threads on its lower side

that match those of the hole, and the weight of the gasket assembly

is supported by the pin which is kept in place by the engaged threads. -
When the other flange is brought into place the ring groove cams the
ring upward; this motion disengages the threads on the pin and the
tapped hole and allows the ring to move into the proper sealing
position in the groove. For removal, the assembly is raised so that
the smooth upper surface of the pin contacts the top of the hole.

This disengages the threads and allows the pin to be withdrawn.

2.9.9 Flange-Cover~Handling Tool

 

In order t6 reduce the release of radioactive particles from
the system and the extrance of air, covers are placed over the open
flanges. A cover consists of a steel plate with a raised gasket
surface, a wedge device for tightening it up against the flange face,.
a bracket to hang it on the flange ear, and a handling bail. The -
cover is shown on drawing MSRE-SK-D-263. The seal occurs just inside . -
the ring gasket groove but outside the expected salt-cake area, and , o
it is not expected to be a high-quality seal. The handling tool ‘ij
contains a hook with & lock and a pair of remctely operated sockets
for operating the wedge. The covers require 4 in. of clearance.

,between the flange faces for remote installation. For freeze flange

FF-200 a special offset tool is required because the open flange

‘is under a shield support beam. Further, because of interferences
‘with' the stowed clamp, the covers must be partly installed as the

flanges are being Jacked apart. The handling tool, 1nstalled covers,
and stowed clamp are shown on Fig. 11.

2 6 Fuel-PUmp Maintenance

The MSRE fuel pump is made up of the pump bowl ‘the rotary
element, and the motor stacked vertically and Joined by bolted gasketed
Joints. The pump bowl assembly consists of the pump tank, the volute,
the suction and discharge lines from freeze flanges FF-100 to FF-101,
the furnace, the support plates, and a number of flanges for dis-
connecting the pump auxiliary systems. The rotary element consists
of the pump shaft, impeller, shield block, bearings, bearing housing,
and various auxiliary lines with flanges. The motor has a power
lead-in on top and two cooling water lines with flanges. All these
flanges for the pump auxiliaries are on a common radius from the
center line of the pump and are mounted at three specific elevations.
The bolts that hold the three units together are arranged to allow
the choice of removing flrst the motor and then the rotary element
or both of these together. Jacking screws are provided to force the
rotary element off the pump bowl in the event of a stuck gasket.

The procedure for removing either of the two upper parts is to
disconnect the electrical power lead and the auxiliary flanges, unscrew
all the pump flange bolts, and finally operate the jack bolts to
meke sure the parts will separate. The preparatory work is done
with long-handled socket wrenches and hooks inserted through the |
portable shield. A lifting yoke is inserted through the split section
of the rotating plug and engaged in the trunnions provided on both '
the motor and the bearing housing, and the unit is lifted clear of
all the close fitting attachments. The part is then lifted by the

- crane until it is Just below the portable maintenance shiéld., At this

point it is necdessary to go into the remote-maintenance comtrol room,
open the slide of the portable shield, and pull the part up into

the high bay for storage in one of the pits or for disposal, Plastic
covering or other contaimment is used to prevent contamination of the

‘high bay area, Installing a replacement part requires the reverse

of the removal procedure, with the addition of the extra care that

. must be exerclsed when engaglng the mating surfaces of the pump.

2 7 Graphlte Sampler and Control Rods _ ":

' The term ' graphite sampler refers to a collectlon of both
permanently installed and removable equipment used to maintain three
important components of the reactor that are phy51cally located near
the center llne of the core. 'These components are the graphite-
Hastelloy N surveillance semples, the 2-in. removable graphite
strlngers, and the control rods.

 
 

24

2.7.1 Surveillance Samples

 

Among the important results to be gained from operating the
MSRE are the chemical and metallurgicel data to be obtained from
examining specimens of graphite and metal exposed in the central
region of the core for long perlods of operation. (This program
has been described in detail.®) Figure 13 shows features of the
sample assembly and its location in the core. This sample assembly,
which is roughly a 5-ft-long 2-in.-diam. cylinder, consists of an
‘array of graphite bars, Hastelloy N tensile specimens, and flux-
measuring wire inside & basket of perforated sheet metal. End
fittings accommodate installation, coolant flow, and handling
requirements. After exposure in the operating reactor, the
specimen is removed with long-handled tools and taken in a shielded
carrier to a hot cell where some of the semples are taken from the
basket for chemical and metallurgical examination. The basket is
then reloaded with new and exposed samples, returned to the reactor,
and reinstaslled in the core.

The graphite sampler, which was designed primarily for the
operation of removing and replacing surveillance samples, is shown
in Fig. 14, and consists of the following. components:

1. A 48- in.-wide lower shield block, which has a 39-1/2-in.-
diam. hole over the center of the reactor vessel. During reactor
operation a filler plug is installed in the 39-1/2-in.-diam. hole.

2. A 20-in,.-diem. standpipe sttached to the.bottom of the
48-in. shield block by means of & flange and a bolting ring and to
the 2-1/2-in. reactor access flange. An expansion bellows is used
between the standpipe and the access flange to allow for movement
due to thermal expansion. The standpipe is attached slightly off
center at the top to leave access roam for control rod maintenance.

3. A cylinder 36-in. high by 47-1/2-in. in diameter with
4-in. thick walls {of canned-lead construction), which is installed

when preparing to teke a sample. This shield is sealed at the bottom

by the weight resting on a flat gasket. It is designated the
graphite-sampler work shleld but it is sometimes simply called the
work shield.

L, A geared work plug, 38-in. diam. by 10-1/2-in. thick,
is inserted into the work shield (item 3 above). This plug has a
Teflon ring that acts as & seal and bearing surface. The work plug
Fig. 15, has a smaller geared plug eccentric to the large plug,
and seven various sized tool plugs, viewing ports, and lighting
inserts. Teflon gaskets and neoprene "O" rings are used throughout

to make the overall assembly gastight.

5. The standpipe. atmosphere-control system. This consists of a
nitrogen supply, a control panel, an exhaust blower and a filter.
When items 1 through 4 are assembled, a sesled compartment is formed
above the reactor, through whlch_personnel operating long-handled
tools, can open the reactor and withdraw a radiocactive sample. By
feeding a purge of nitrogen into the compartment and maintaining a
negative pressure inside it, two purposes are served. Air is kept
out of the reactor vessel, and contamination is kept out of the
personnel working area., '

6. Miscellaneous equipment. Once the shielding, contairment,
and atmosphere control have been set up, the physical handling of the
in-cell equipment can proceed. .With long-handled tools and a variety
of standard and special hardware, the reactor access port is opened,
and the sample is withdrawn and put into a sealed container within -
the standpipe. The container is pulled upward out of the standpipe
- into a carrier with 6-in.-thick shield walls for its trip to the
- hot cell. In practice, a lengthy and detailed step-by-step written
procedure is followed by the personnel doing the work.

2.T.2 The 2-in. Graphlte Core Stringers

There are five stringers (moderstor blocks) located in the center
of the core that can be removed for examination. They are equipped
with fittings for handling. However, access to remove them is
gained only after the removal of the control rods and drive hou81ngs,
the substitution of a 36-in.-diam. standpipe for the 20-in. stand-
pipe, and finally the removal of the control-rod thimble assembly.
There are no plans to remove these stringers until the conclusion
of reactor operation. ‘

2.7T.3  Control Rods

- Figure 16 shows the top view of the three control rod drive
housings and the 20-in. standpipe. The control-rod access flange has
been removed. The view is similar to that of looking down through a
‘window in the graphite-samplerzwork plug. For maintenance the
control-rod drive housing is removed first. Induced rediation and
contamination of this unit is low so that repairs can be made with
- ordinary-methods after minor cleanup. .A ¢ontrol rod can be

removed only after the drive housing is out of the way. The rods
have much induced activity and are generally replaced rather than
repaired. All the necessary work is done W1th long-handled tools.

'2,8 Braze Joints

The ,1-1/2-in, Hastelloy N piping for the salt fill-and-drain

component with a prepared fitting, and braz1ng the stub into the
fitting. The technique, as developed for the MSRE requires a
permanent 2-by 3-ft base plate located at each possible future JOlnt
four tools that can be placed and operated through the maintenance

" shield, and a 4200-cps 30-kw induction generator.

Figure 17 shows an unassembled joint and a section of a brazed
joint. The in-cell pipe stub is machined to a taper, like the piece
on the right. The new component is installed with a prepared end,
like the piece shown on the left, and with the gold-nickel sheet-
metal braze preform, shown in the center, fastened in it. The two ‘
are pressed together while being heated to 1900°F to form the completed
joint. Figure 18 is the positioning vise suspended from its lifting
bail. It is lowered over a continuocus piece of pipe, positioned
on the base plate by dowels, bolted down, and the three-jaw chuck is
closed to grip the pipe. Flgure 19 shows the pipe cutter in operation.
It is lowered, in the open position, over a continuous piece of pipe
and onto its mounting plate on the positioning vise. The knife is
fed into contact with the pipe and the cutter is rotated, with
automatic knife feed, until the pipe is cut. The cutter is then

"removed. After the camponent is completely disconnected and removed
the taper cutter is placed on the base plate, Fig. 20. The taper
cutter is driven through an extension shaft by an air motor while
the positioning vise is used to drive the pipe stub into it. A
6° included-angle taper l-in. long is machined on the pipe. The
taper cutter is then removed, and the furnace with induction heating
leads and purge-gas connection is placed on the pipe stub as shown
in the left side of Fig. 21. The new component with the prepared
braze fitting, thermocouples, and furnace end piece is put into
place. The fixed vise is then lowered over the pipe, fastened to
the base plate, and closed to grip the pipe as in the right side of

. Fig. 21. The positioning vise is then operated to drive the stub
into the braze fitting so that matching tapers jam. The furnace
is closed as in Fig. 22 and the inert gas purge is begun. After an
appropriate purge period, the induction’generator-is turned on and
the joint is heated to 1T00°F in about 2 min. Axial pressure is
maintained on the joinmt with the positioning vise during heating,
and at about 1750°F the braze metal melts and the pipe stub travels
about 1/8-in. further in. This reduces the joint thickness from
0.005 to less than 0,001 in. The joint is held at 1900°F for about
one minute to assure complete melting and wetting and then permitted
to cool. The furnace is then opened, the thermocouples are removed,
and the joint is inspected. If the joint does not pass inspection,
the furnace can be closed, the joint heated to 1900°F and separated.
If it does pass inspection, the furnace is removed by breaking up the
insulation and cutting loose the coils, the vises are removed, and the
line is restored to service. : :

2,9 Maintenance of the Saripler-Enricher

 

- The sampler-enricher system provides the means whereby samples
of salt are removed from the reactor for analysis and additions are
made to enrich or p01sq£ the fuel. This system was described in
more detail previously. A shell of 8-in. of lead has been built

“around the equipment for shielding during reactor operation. Portions

of this shell must be removed for access, and other portions are
utilized as shielding during maintenasnce. The maximum source
strength can be assumed to be no more than that of 2 radioactive

-

' _samples of salt. (Presumably one sample would be associated with
- .the equipment failure and the other due to the accumulation of -

deposits and spills from the routine handling of many samples.)

- A radiation level of 400 r/hr at 12 in. has been estimated for this.

The arrangement of the- components of the sampler is such that
there are seven distinct areas that ‘may be worked on more or less

By 1ndependently The operatlng panel board and parts are shown in
Figs. 23 and 24. Maintenance will be accomplished with hand tools

and direct methods with advantage taken of the shielding that can bhe
provided by local stacklng of lead bricks. The designs of the

- connectors, fasteners, and movable shielding have, to a large exfent
- facilitated this approach.- When the partlcular unit has been '

disconnected, it will be transported to a decontamination cell to

be cleaned up as much as possible before further work. Distance,
shadow shielding, and the: maintenance control room will be used,. ,
depending on the radlatlon level and the complex1ty of the partlcular

" task.

12,10 Mlscellaneous Long—Handled Tools' -

 

_12 10 1 Heater and Thermocouple Maintenance Tools_r

 

The tools -for,the mamtemnce-of the heaters and the. therniecouple

. disconnects are, in general, long-handled lifting hooks working .

~ inside a centering guide or socket. In operation the hook is engaged
.in the bail on the equipment and the socket is brought down over
_the bail to lock it inside the tool. At this point the unit is

transported and released at its destlnatlon. The tool is then
removed. The heaters and electrical disconnects have identical -

 bails, which fit the socket on the end of the tool. The thermocouple
- disconnect tool however’ reqplres a different-sized socket and, in
~addition, a frame of guide rails attached to the socket which acts

in aligning the two halves: ‘of the dlsconnect before the electrlcal
contacts have engaged ' o ,

2,10,2 Lesk-Detector Disconnect Wrench and Handling Tool

A remotely operable joint consisting of a pair of mating
conical surfaces forced together by a single bolt mounted in a
pivoted yoke is used in the MSRE in the leak detector lines and.
in pneumatic lines that feed the weigh cells in the drain tank
cell. This joint is known as the leak-detector disconnect. The
procedure to disconnect it is to use the leak detector disconnect
wrench to unscrew the bolt, and with the attached hook, to pivot.
the yoke back out of the way. Then by using the same tool as a
long handled "C" clamp, the pipe or tube that comes into the top
of the disconnect is grasped, separated from its mate, and moved
clear of the area. 1In the case where it is necessary to .hold both
parts of the joint, an additional "C" clamp tool is utilized.

3., DETATLED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

The operating procedure in a radiocactive maintenance situetion,

in the interest of safety and economy, includes

(1) the maintenance operation and the tools involved,
(2) the prOteetion ef'personnel and equipment,

(3) the manipulatlon of reactor eqpipment, such as the
, ventilation system, end

(4) the measures required to maintain cleanliness both in
the cell and in the hlgh-bay area.

Detells of a procedure depend on knowledge of the reactor, its
operating history, the effects of its radioactivity, and the main-

' tenance operations. It would be impractical to try to anticipate

all the needs of a procedure; therefore, the procedures that follow .
pertain only to the operation of the maintenance tools, and the

check out of the equipment for functlon, calibration, and defects.

In general attention to detail and good cooperatlon among all involved
are required for good. results.

The verb "insert" as. used in the procedures refers to the entire
operation, which consists of picking up the tool on the crane, threading
it through the proper hole in the portable shield, carefully lowering
it into position with whatever manipulations are reqplred to clear
in-cell equipment and finally using the proper bushlng to close up
the gap in the shielding. - -

' Motlon or displacement of the tools or equipment is accompllshed
generally by moving the portable shield with the tool attached to it.
Motions in the long dlrectlon of the shield blocks (east and west in

' the reactor cell and the drain tank cell) are simple translations
- of the slide. Motions across the slide are made with a more complex

combination of plug rotation and slide translation. Small movements

may . be accomplished by utillzlng +the clearance between:the outside

of the mast of the tool and the hole in the shield into Wthh it is
inserted. The long tools w1th relatlvely heavy lower ends act very

‘much like pendulums, so the operator cannot exert total, 9051t1ve
 control. For this reason all movements of these tools must be made
~as slowly, smoothly, and deliberately as possible to retain control

av01d violent 0501llations, and prevent damage to equlpment.
3.1 The Radiatlon and Contamlnatlon Prdblem

Radiatlon and contam;natlon levels vary W1dely in the MSRE

There are situations where tools can be inserted and removed repeatedly

without becoming radloactlve, and there are also occasions in whlch

everything in the v101n1ty of the operation Wlll be -highly

 
 

42

contaminated. Therefore no one simple written procedure will
adequately cover all situations. However, the following guide lines
are generally applicable: :

B 1. Written health Physics procedures and precautlons must be
provided for each job.

2. A.health physicist must be present at the start of each
operation to survey and to evaluate hazards. .

3. Anything below the shielding (i.e.,‘in_a radioactive area)
must be assumed to be a radioactive hazard until proven otherwise.
It must be wiped, monitored, and/or contalned as it is belng pulied
up through the shield.

4., Techniques for contamination control, such as containment
and personnel shielding, must be considered during the preparation
of the remote-malntenance procedures. :

9. Radioactive, contaminated equipment can be disposed of in
gseveral ways. It can be taken to the hot-equipment storage cell or
the decontamination cell at the MSRE, the radiosctive burial ground
on & hot truck, or to any of a number of hot cells at ORNL. The
choice depends on a number of factors, such as the value of the
part, the use of the part, how radioactive it is, and what
facilities are available for hendling it. However, containment
must be provided to prevent the spread of airborne contamination,
and shielding must be provided for gamma radiation to protect
_personnel.

3.2 Maintenance Control Room and Remote Facilities

The maintenance control room is used for limited operations;
for example when it is necessary to move highly radiocactive materials
from one cell to another or out of the high-bay area of the building,
and when openings made in the shielding are so large that the resulting
radistion levels preclude normal occupancy of the high-bay area.
During the actual use of the maintenance comtrol room, all operations
- must be accomplished by using the two cranes and, further, the high
- bay may not be accessible. Complete 1naccess1bllity represents an
extreme situation., Usually the high-bay area can be entered, and
personnel using distance and/or shadow shielding to reduce exposure
can work for short tlmes to assist with operations and to remedy
troubles. : :

Because this work presents special hazards, the following should
be done to assure that the operation proceeds smoothly:

l. The written procedure should be gone over thoroughly before
starting to check that the procedure is workable and that all
necessary equipment (1ift fixtures, camera and light stands,

- .equipment supports, ete.) aré on hand and are located where the

 

O
 

 

9

0

43

crane hooks can get to them.

2. All the operat:n.ng equipment should be tested Just prior to

“the actual operation. The cranes should be operated in all dlrections,

at all the control settings. The 1lift fixtures should be visually
inspected, lubricated, and tested under load. Television cameras and
lights should all be warmed up and functioning, and for a test they
should be moved about with the crane to demonstrate their portability.

3. During operation there should be at least three people but
less than seven in the maintenance control room.

L., After completing the maintenance 0perat10ns, the hlgh bay
should be thoroughly surveyed by the health physicist and contamination
should be cleaned up before semidirect operations are resumed.

3.3 Procedure for Use with the Portable Maintenance'Shield

Detailed procedures are outlined on Dvg. LL-D DLO663, MSRE

- Main Cell Plan View Shield Setups Reference Drawing, and on Dwg.

LL-D-D40669, MSRE Drain Tank Cell Plan View Shield Setup Reference

‘required. Place slide and module arrangements as indicated on the

reference draW1ng.-

 
 

 

3.3.2 Operations

1. Verify the following by operating the slide with the motor
drive: ' : : o :

"~ a. that sufficient clearance exists for removing the blocks,

b. that the device which couples ‘the slide to the rotating
- work. plug operates,. and

c. that the slide travels smoothly on the frame and the
- track .

2. Clear the opening in the frame for lower shield block removal.r

3. Attach the block-liftlng tongs to one of the blocks to be
removed. ¢ . .. .. . o :

4. Connect the motor drive power'lead‘into the remote-maintenance
roon receptacle (located on the wall just west of the reactor cell).

- 5. Evacuate the high-bay area and continue the operation from
the remote-maintenance control room. \ :

6. Remove both shield blocks through the frame to a- designsated
parking area. This coperation can be done with the crane operator
watching through the windows and one man Observing the weigh-cell
indicator.

Te Energize the slide drive motor, and return.the slide to
cover the cell opening. Return to the high bay.

8. Use as many modules as required'to keep the cell opening
covered.

-9, Move the rotating'work plug over the desired area and
proceed with semidirect operations. :

e 10. To handle. large pieces of'eqpipment, the slide and rotating
work plug are separated, the equipment hanging on a long-handled
tool is passed through the opening, and the slide is closed around

the mast of the tool at the cutout built into the edge of the
rotating plug. Depending on the radiation level, some of these
operations may have to be done from the remote-maintenance control
room.

3.3.3 Closure*

1. Remove all long-handled tools, close holes, and clear the
top of the slide and rotating work plug.

*The purpose of this operation is to replace the lower shield
blocks in the roof of the cell.

3.4 Procedures for Using'Freeze-Flange Manipulating Tools
3.4.1 Hydraulic Clamp Operator

3.4.1.1 Equipment Required. The portable maintenance shield |
must be set up with the special freeze-flange rotating plug (se

- Dwg. LL-D- h0668), periscope with sheath, rod light, left-hand and

right-hand hydraulic clamp operating tools with pump, an A frame,
and an overhead ‘crane, (See Fig. 9 for flange nomenclature.)

. 3.h.1.2 Assembllng the Clamps Onto the Flange

_1. Insert the perlscope with the right-angle lens in a convenient.
hole. . Lower it until it is looklng at the top disassembly beam.

2. Insert one hydraullc tool w1th the jaws opened to the

calibration marks on- the 1nner and outer frames.

“

. 3. Lower the tool till the upper jaw (the movable one) is Just
above the upper surface of the clamp ear. The lower stationary Jjaw

~is then under the ear on the lower clamp.

'h Engage the tool’by“movlng it horlzontally toward the flange.

This may be done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool
,used as the lever and the portable shleld as the fulcrum

5. Repeat steps 2 3, and 4 for the other 51de.
| 6, Attach the hydraullc pumps to the flttlng on top of the mast.

T Operate the pumps to force the two clamp halves together.
Whlle the tool's upper Jaw moves, the lower jaw is stationary,

 
 

46

therefore the mast must be raised to compensate for this. ' The entire
process is monitored with the use of the periscope to make adjustments
in the travel of the clamp to keep it level and to keep the spacing
between the clamps uniform. ~

8. Disengage the tools and reﬁeﬁe them'from.the cell.
. 3.4.1.3 Removing the Bottom Clamp from the Flange

1. Insert the periecope with fhe right-angle lens in a convenient
. hole. Lower it until it is looking at the top disassembly}beam.

2. Insert one hydraulic tool wrth the ,je.ws opened to the proper
calibration mark.

3. Lower the tool till the upper jaw (the movable.one) is just
above the upper surface of the lower clamp ear. This is between
the two clamps and approximately on the center line of the flange.
The lower jaw of the tool, the statlonary one, is then under the
proper surface of the lower beam.

.

4, Engage the tool by moving it horizontally toward the flange.
This may be done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool
used as the lever and the portable shield as the fulcrum, :

5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the other side.

6. Attach the hydraulic pumps at the fitting on the top of the
mast. )

7. Operate the pumps to force the lower clamp off the flange.
This should require approximately 2 in., of power stroke and then
the clamp should fall of its own weight. A provision is made on
the tool for catching the clamp. The tool is then lowered until the
lower clamp is restlng on the beam.

8. Disengage the tools and remove them from the cell.

3.4.1.4 Removing the Top Clemp from the Flange

‘1. Insert the periscope, with the right-angle lens in a
convenient hole. Lower it until it is locking at the top disassembly

beam.

2. Insert one hydraullc tool with the ,jaws opened to the proper\
‘calibration mark.

3. Lower the tool until the upper Jjaw (the movable one) is
Just above the proper surface of the top disassembly beam and the
~ lower stationary jaw is under the upper clamp.
 

v

"

47

L. Engage the tool by moving it horizontally toward the flange.
This is done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool used

as the lever and the portable shield as the fulcrum.

5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the other side.
- 6. Attach the hydraulic pumps &t the fitting on top of the mast.
T. Operate tﬁe pumps_to force the upper»clamp off of the flange.
8. ‘Disengage thertools and remove them from the cell.
3.4.2 The élamp-Ha.nd:Ling' Tool |

1. Insert the tool dlrectly over the center of the flange (in

the plan view).

2. Engage the hooks on the tool 1n,the eyes on the upper clamp.

3. Lift the top clamp until it begins to pick up on the top
dlsassembly beam. .

4., Raise the clamp d@ssembly very slowly. When the slack has
been taken out of the pin jJjoint between the beam and the guide rod
the tool is supporting the weight of the entire clamp assembly and
there is only1/8 in. vertical clearance between the guide rod jaws
and the flange ears., Thus & movement of 1/16 in. is required to
gain clearance to move the clamp.

5. When the clamp assembly is free of the flange, move the tool
horizontally along the center line of the pipe toward the clamp
stowing bracket. At the instant the 1lifting motion frees the
restriction, the clamp assembly will probably come off the flange
ears in a twisting motion so that one side is upstream and the other

- side is downstreem. When this occurs move the clamp assembly over
‘8o that the offendlng side may be swung outboard and around the

flange ear. The same meéthod applies when the entire clamp assembly

is on the wrong side of‘the flange. ’

6. Ralse the tool enough to Clear the front edge of the stowing

~ bracket. Move the clamp assembly ‘back agalnst the stop on the stowing
=_bracket and lower it into place.-

7. Before releasing the'hook'examine the clamp's pdsifibn with

all availsble means (monocular through window in portable shield,
 periscope, and auxiliary mlrrors) to assure that 1t is seated properly

on the bracket.

8. Disengage the tool and remove it from the cell. .

3.4.3 Flange Jacking and‘Aligning Tools

'3.4.3.1 Eguipment Required. The jacking system consists of in-
cell equipment at each flange operated by simple rotation of two
hex-head screws. One screw operates the Jack that generates the
_ push-pull forces and, in general, is located outboard of the other
screw, which operates a latch bar used only for the pulling operation.
‘Both hex heads are the same size (1-1/2 in. across the flats), and
they are located close to one another. Drawing E-GG-E-41878 should
be consulted to assure that the operator can identify each screw.

All the jack operators will push the flange closed when turned clock-
wise. Operation of the latch bar varies, and the installation drawing
should be consulted for each installation.

 

 

,, 3-1F-3.2 Pulling the Flanges Apart -
1. Inéert the tool onto the jack hex head.

7 2. Rotate until contact is made between the bar on the pipe
support and the pad on the jaw of the jack. This operation should
be viewed, whenever possible, with the periscope.
3+ Remove tool from the jack hex head and engage it onto the
hoock hex head.

k., Rotate to close the hook latch around the jack bar to permit
‘pulling with the Jack. This should never require high torque, and
if high torques are encountered, they indicete that the stop has
been reached or that there is a malfunction which should be in-
vestigated. ~ -

5. Switch the hook back to the jack héx head and rotate counter
clockwise to pull the flanges apart. In this case the torque is
proportional to the load. '

6. Remove the tool.

. 3.4.3.3 Pushing the Flanges Together Whlle Using the Plpe-Allgnment
Tool

1. Insert tool onto Jack hex head and rotate clOCKW1se untll
there is only 1 in. between flange faces.

2, Insert pipe aligning tool so that the'arrow-heaﬂ-shaped
guide on the tool will go into the slot in the pipe-aligning bracket. -

3. Rotate the tool toward the flange, and adjust the height
and the horizontal distance of the pin on the tool until it is
“aligned with the hole in the ear of the flange.

L., Engage the pin in the flange ear.

5. Using the drive rods on top of the tool, raise, lower, or
align the flange being jacked with its mate. Check this with the -
V1eW1ng equipment . '

6. Resume pushing with the Jack eperator, and adjust the
allgnment as necessary untll the flanges are seated. '

7. Back the jack hook h in. away from the bar on the support
to avoid restriction to thermal-éxpansion movements.

8. Remove the tools.
3.4,4 The Gasket-Handling Tool
3401 Removing an Existing Gasket

1. With the flanges spread apart 4 in. or more, lower the
gasket-handling todl, with jaws open, into the space between the

- flanges on the center line of the plpe.

2 Us1ng the periscope with the rlght-angle'lens and binoculars
from above, carefully line up the tool ‘and the vertical center line
of the gasket. : . - .

3. Move the tool horizontally into position with the upper
jaw approximately 1/4 in. above the locking-pin bracket.

4, Lower the tool s0 that the upper jaw contacts the locking
pin bracket.

5. BSlowly move the lower jaw up into locking position by

lowering the handle on the upper end of the tool. Lock the tool

to the gasket through the engagement of the lower jaws in slots
in the rlng. ,

6. Ralse the tool sllghtly to clear the threads on the locklng
pln and move the tool, with the gasket, back from the flange face.

A minimum of 1-1/2 in. travel is required to clear the male guide

installed gaeket and is cléar of the flange.

9. Remove the tool from the cell.

3.4.5 The Flange-Cover-Handling Tool -

 

*3.4.5.1 Installing Flange Covers

1. Place the cover for the male flange in the tool eecurely)'
and meke sure that the wedges are fully retracted (i.e., maximum
opening in the bracket).

2, Lower it into the cell between the open flanges until the
rim of the cover is past the male guide.

3. Move horizontally toward the. flange'so that the bracket
hooks over the ears on.the flange and then lower it until it is
seated there, :

L. Release the hook and lower the tool so that the sockets

element housing. Use a torque indicator on the socket extension
tool.

4. Remove all tools except the periscope.
5. Insert pump lifting yoke through split in portable shield.
6. Engage hooks on ydke in trunnions on motor.

T. Record two 1tems of 1nformation to be used in the replacement
operation: : .

~(a) the elevation of the mast with respect to the operating
floor and =
(b) the azimuth location of the center line of the crane
hook. :

, 8, Lift the motor straight up to a position beneath the poftable
shield., There is engagement between rotary element and motor for

mlthe first 7 in. of this travel.

- 9. If the radioactiVity level requires it, evacuate the high-.
bay area and continue the operation from inside the shielded remote-
maintenance control room."f

10. Open the slide on the portable shield and pull the motor up

~with the crane and take it ‘to the storage area.

| 3 5.2 Remov1ng the Fuel-Pumy Rotary Element -

4. Remove all tdols'excépt periscdpe.'
5. Insert pumpéliftihg y9ke thréuéh split in portable shield.
6. Engage hooks on yoke in trunnions on rotary element.
T. BRecord fo} use in‘the replacement 6peration the elévatlon
of the mast with respect to the operating floor and the azimuth of the

crane hodk.

- 8. The initial lift is accomplished by screwing the L jack

'bolts on the outer bolt circle .déwn against the pump bowl flange.

This jacks the rotary element up and off the bowl.

9. Lift the rotary element stralght up to a position beneath
the shield. The lowest part of the impeller does not clear the pump
flange until after the first 22-1/2 in. of travel, so the 1ifting |
must be done slowly and carefully .

10. If the radioactivity level requires it, evacuate the high-
bay area and continue the operation frqm inside the shielded remote-
maintenance control room.

. 11. Open the slide on the portable shield, pull the rbtary'
element up with the crane, and take it to the storage area.

12. Install pump bowl cover.
3.5.3 Replacing the Fuel-Pump Rotary Element
1. Remove the pump bowl cover plate.

2. Pick up the new unit on the crane with the lifting yoke -
oriented in reactor position. Locate the crane over the center line
of the pump from measurements made in the removal process.

3. Open the portable maintenance shield, (from the control room,
if necessary), and lower the tool and new wit. Close the shleld
as soon as the round mast section is in the shield.

k, Proceed with semidirect techniques. Insert periscope.

5. Lower the rctary element down onto the pump bowl. The last
22 1/2 in. of travel must be slow, since the impeller enters the (
bore of the pump bowl flange at this point. To assist the operation,
there should be on hand a drawing showing how the rotary element

- fits the pump bowl. This is to be used with appropriate calibration '

marks on the tool, which are referenced to the elevation mark of the
final seated position of the: rotary element.

if necessary), and lower the tool and motor. 'Close shield as soon
as the round mast section is 4in the shield.

3. Proceed W1th semidlrect techniques., Insert periscope.

4. Lower the motor omto the rotary element. At the start of
the last 7 in. of travel, pins in the motor housing engage a
slotted cone on top of the rotary element to provide radial guidance.
At the last 2 in. of travel the mating parts of the splined coupling
engage. If the splines meet tooth to tooth, it is necessary to

~twist the motor through the clearance between the.-pin and the

slots in the cones. ThlS is suff1c1ent to allow the splines to mate
properly. .

5. Torque the flange bolts to the desired loading according
to a torque indicator on the long-handled sockets.

3.6.2 Replac1ng the Survelllance Sample in the Core

The process of replacing ‘the surveillance sample in the core
consists basically of the reverse of the removal process. A list
of the general activities is given below.

l. The sample is transferred out of the shlelded carrier into
the standplpe.

2, An inert atmosphere is'established in the standpipe.

3. The_reaeter access:is opened and the semple is transferred
into the core. |

k. The holddown assembly is relnstalled. The flange must bass*
the standard- leak test. ,

5. The thermodduple and air-cooling lines are reconnected.

6. The eqplpment and long-handled tools are removed from the
standpipe. .

T. The standpipe and the various pieces of shielding are put
back into the condition for reactor operstion.

3.6.3 Procedures for Removing and Replacing the 2-in. Square
Graphite Stringers

 

In order to remove and replace the 2-in. square graphite
stringers (Dwg. BB-B-4O416, Items 7, 60, and 61) in the center
of the core, the same control must be maintained over the leakage
into or out of the reactor, the cell, and the working area as that
-used while removing the surveillance sample assembly. An additionsal
standpipe large encugh to accommodate the removal and replacement
of these stringers has been de51gned and fabricated (Dwg. D-BB-C- h0659)

The following are the necessary steps for the installation of
the standpipe and the subsequent removal of the graph1te°-

1. Drain and flush the reactor systemg and bleed off the
pressure. .

2. Remove 5 upper shield blocks.

3. Go through the entire procedure for removmng the survelllance
sample assembly with two exceptions. Insert a dummy with an appropriate
handling fitting in place of the usual sample assembly. Remove
the flange and holddown assembly and substitute a blind flange.

3.6.4 Removing Control Rod Units

Access to the control rod units has been provided through the
upper flange of the 20-in. graphite-sampler standpipe. The following
genersl procedure is used for removing parts of the control rod and
drive assembly.

1. Remove five upper roof plugs.

2, Assemble the following tools: (a) the work shield (Dwg.
E-BB-C-L0646, items 1 and 2; (see also Figs. 15 and 16), (b) work
Plug and associated tool holders, viewing ports, light receptacles,
etc. (see assembly drawing E-BB-C-40646), (c) wrenches and
extension handles for bolts, disconnects, etc. on the drive assembly,
install the short tools in the work plug.

alS. Use plastlc bags to contain any loose contamination.

-Replacement of the control-rod drive housing consists of doing
the above procedure in the reverse order. However, when the repair
to the drive mechanism has been completed it must be assembled with
a new control-rod-thimble flange-seal ring and with only one captive
screw in the flange that connects the drive to the rod. Also the
follow1ng steps are required to attach the control rod to the drlve.

These steps replace step 9

8. Insert the threaded rod tool into the drive hou81ng and
thread it through one of the threaded holes in the flange on the-
drive. It will go completely through these thread until the -smooth
shank on the tool is in the threads.r

not be too radioactive, but the lower end that has been in the reactor
will be very hot, probably above 200.r/hr, and ‘precautions must be
taken to deal with this source.

20, 'Dispose of the control rod or drop it into a shielded carrier.

Replacement of the control rod is accomplished with the reverse
of the above procedure, steps 1 to 20,

f. one complete dummy female braze fittlng with 18-in. nipple

L. General-purpose eQﬁipment:

'da. lO-toh crane
- b. maintenance shleld

Perform a test braze in the folIOW1ng manner to determine that
the equipment is in Worklngrorder and to qualify the procedure:

‘1. Inspect all tools and equipment to make sure they are on
hand, clean, and in working order. The pipe cutter knife must read

‘R.C. 60 or better on the blade.

2. Mount the p081t10n1ng vise on the spare base plate. Put a

‘piece of 1 l/2-1n. Hastelloy N pipe in the positioning vise and

clamp it tightly. Mount the cutter and cut the plpe. The proper

- procedure for cutting is the following:

a. Rotate the tool drive until the knife feed wheel is up.
b. Feed the knife in untii it 1s snug_on the pipe.

c. Rotate the tool until the knife feed wheel contacts the
pin but does not pass 1t.

d. Rotate the tool back untll the wheel touches from the
other side.

« €. Make four complete DSC1llat10ns and then pass the pin to
advance the knife feed :

. ‘Continue in this fashion (four oscillations and then
a revolutlon) until the pipe is cut. The progress of the cut and
the condition of the knifée can be determined from the torque (feel)

~ of the tool drive and should be observed carefully durlng the

practlce cut.

: g Feed the knife all the way out, rotate the tool 50 that
the openlng is down, and remove the tool from the vise.

'h. Examine the cutter knlfe, and if 1t is not damaged use

it for the 1n-cell operation.

S

 
 

64

: 3. Position the vise all the way to the back (i.e., away from
' the slide feed nuts), and mount the pipe taperer on the base ‘plate.
_ While turning the taperer drive by hand advance the pipe into the
cutter by moving the positioning vise forward until you feel the

cut begin.” This is the starting point of the tapering cut. Carefully .

mark the position of the feed handle and count revolutions from this
point. Place the air motor on the taperer drive, set the pressure
~to 25 psi, and turn on the air motor. It is necessary to hold the
air motor by hand to feel the torque and to advance the vise feed
by the torque feel. Too heavy a feed will result in chipped cutter
teeth. The operation should take 2 to 3 hr. After the feed hag
advanced 5 1/2 turns, the cut is complete. Let the air motor run
10 min with no further feeding to obtain a smooth finish., Back the
pipe out. Remove the taperer., Clean the taper with a thoroughly
~degreased brush. Do not touch the machined surface with anythlng
“else. . A finger-print will produce an unbonded area.

4. Slide the furnace over the tapered stub.

5. Thoroughly degrease the dummy female braze fitting with
thermcouples and furnace end attached, as well as the braze preform.
Assemble the preform into the fitting and fasten it with severdal -
spot welds. Use white gloves and extreme care. A fingerprint will
cause an unbonded area. . : '

6. Clamp the flttlng in the fixed vise so that the end of the
fitting projects 4 1/2-in. past the end of the jaws. Place the
vise on the base plate and bolt it down.

T Bottom the pipe stub in the fitting by operating the
positioning vise and then back the stub out cne-fourth turn for a
purge gap. Close the furnace over the joint. Place pipe plugs
in the pipe ends. Connect argon purge to the furnace and one pipe
plug. Purge at 40 c¢fh. Connect the thermocouple leads to the
indicators. Connect the furnace leads to the Ajax generator.

Set the capacitor control to 15. Start the machine, bring it up
to about 5 kw to heat the joint to 500°F, and then adjust the
power to hold the joint at 500°F while purging for 1 hr to bake
~out and off-gas the system. Adjust the capacitor control if
necessary to obtain a power factor of one at 5 kw.

8. Operate the'positioning vise to firmly seat the stub in
‘the fitting. While one operator maintains pressure on the
positioning vise drive, the second operator raises the machine
- power to 60 amp, which results in readlngs of approximately 140 v
and 11 kw. The joint heats to 1750°F in about 1 1/2 min, at which
time the vise operator drives the stub in 1/8 in. or about three-
fourths turn and again seats the stub firmly in the fitting. The
machine operator watches the temperature indicator carefully, and
when the temperature reaches 1900°F, he immediately cuts the power:
to 3 to 4 kw and carefully adjusts it to hold 1900°F-for 1 min. '

C

O,
 

 

65

Then he turns the power of f ahd permlts'the Jjoint to cool. The vise .
operator -holds pressure on the joint throughout the operation and

until the 301nt cools to 600°F,

9. After the_301nt has.cooled, it is removed and inspected.‘

- If the operation was'successful, the equipment and operators

- are ready to proceed to the remote braze in accordance with the
following: : | :

10. Set the portable meintensnce shield over the braze point

~and remove the pipe heaters and any other interferences. Attach

the chain hoist to the crane.

1l. Put the positioning vise in its full forward position
with its jaws fully open. Attach the 20-ft 1ift bail to the chain
hoist and to the vise. Suspend the vise over the base plate
oriented so it will grip the pipe that is to remain in the cell.
Open the shield slide,' lower the vise through, and close the shield
on the 1ift rod. Lower the vise by use of the chain hoist and
carefully set it on the base plate while guiding the dowels into

‘their holes. Disengage and remove the 1ift bail. Insert the

extension wrench and bolt the vise to the base plate, Operate

the positioning drive to center the vise in its travel as indicated
by marks. Close the jaws on the pipe tightly. If the pipe slips
in the jaws during & later operation, the reference point will be
lost.

12, Attach the 1lift bail to the chain hoist and to the pipe
cutter. ©Suspend the cutter over its mounting plate on the vise,
Make sure the cutter is in the open position so that it will pass
over the pipe. Open the shield slide, lower the cutter, and close
the slide on the bail rod. Lower the cutter and guide it onto the
mounting plate (the plate is 3° off vertical). Use the chain
hoist for final lowering. - Disconnect and remove the 1ift bail.
Insert the extension wrench., Turn the cutter drive until:the knife
feed wheel is up. Put the extension wrench in the feed wheel and

~ fit the cutter knife snugly onto the pipe (counterclockw1se)
- Cut the pipe follOW1ng the procedure in.paragraphs 2 c. through 2 e,

and remove the cutter as in paragraph 2 g

13. With the exten81on'wrench operate the p031t10n1ng vise
drlve 11 turns to the rear .so that the pipe stub Wlll be clear for

“later operatlons.

lh Complete the dlsconnectlon and removal of the camponent

'by the approprlate procedures. o

 
 

 

66

15. Examine the pipe taperer to be sure‘'it is clean, the cutter
is in good condition, and the brush and pilot ball assembly is tacke
welded and cannot come off. Attach the 1ift bail to the chain hoist
and the taperer and insert it through the maintenance shield. Lower
it onto the base plate, remove the 1lift bail, and bolt it down.
Perform the tapering operation as in paragraph 3; however, note ~
in addition, the total number of turns of the positioning vise from
its position in paragraph 13 to the completion of the cut and return
the vise to that position after the completion of the cut. Remove
the taperer from the cell. Gross particulate contamination is to
be expected

16.' Examine the furnace carefully. Attach the induction heating
leads, the purge gas line, and the handling bail, and tie off the
leads and purge line to the top of the bail. Attach the bail to
the chain fall, and insert the furnace in the cell., Carefully slide
the furnace over the stub and against the plate of the vise. Untie
the leads from the bail and secure them on the shield. Remove the
bail. Thoroughly degrease the nylon brush which will pass over the
pipe stub, attach the long handle to it, insert it into the cell,
and brush off the machined surface. Remove the brush.

17. Examine the new component to assurerthat the braze fitting
is accurately located, is clean, the braze preform is in place,

the thermocouples with 25-ft flexible leads coiled on the furnace
bail are in place and checked electrically, and the furnace end with
thermocouple leads is in place. Install the new component by
appropriate procedures.

- 18. Examine the fixed vise to see that it is operating |
properly and that the jaws are fully open. Attach the 1lift bail
to the chain hoist and to the vise, and insert it into the cell.
Place it on-the base plate very carefully to avoid striking the
furnace end. Remove the 1ift bail, bolt down the V1se, and clamp
‘the vise jaws on the pipe tlggplx '

19. Retrieve the thermocouple leads with the retrieval hook.

~ 20. Proceed with the braze as in steps 7 and 8 with the generator
power settings obtained in the test braze. The purge to the inside -
of the pipe will have to be inserted at some convenient place in

the salt system. In the case of & drain-tank replacement, the

~normal helium connection to the drain tank can be used.

21. After the joint is completed, open the furnace and examine
the joint visually with the periscope to check the quallty of the
fillet and wetting around the joint. Then inspect it with ultrasonic
‘tools and techniques provided by the Metals and Ceramics Division.

22, ‘Destructively remove the furnace,.and then remove the tools.

3.8 _Procedures for Maintenshce of the Sampler-Enricher

There are nine parts of the sampler-enricher that will be in
contact with the radiocactive salt. Therefore radiation will be a
factor at the time of maintenance. The specific parts are (1) the
inner compartment, (2) the manipulator arm assembly, (3) the removal
seal assembly, (h) the light bulb, (5) ‘the maintenance valve, (6) the
operational valve, (7) the hot vacuum pump, (8) the containment
housing, and (9) the spool piece connecting the pump bowl with the
sempler. Except for items 5, 6, and 8, these items are independent
and can be removed from.the assembly by themselves. Item 5, the
meintenance valve cannot be removed without first removing items
1 and 6. Similarly, item 6 cannot be removed without removal of 1.
Parts of the sampler-enrlcher are shown in Figs. 23 and 2L,

Radiation levels affectlng maintenance will depend on the duration
and power levels of reactor operation, the amount of spillage, deposits
from gaseous activity, and whether there is a radioactive sample within
the sampler that must be removed in a nonroutine manner. Thus, the
range of conditions that might be encountered is large. While the
reactor is operating, approximately 8 in. of lead shielding covers
the unit. This provides protection for personnel during the normal
sampling operation. The shielding is mostly in the form of stacked
lead brick. Several cast prices are used where -complex shapes are
needed. Doors and windows were built into the shell for maintenance
access. ' ' ' '

A generalized version of the maintenance procedure follows.
Details for each individual piece of equipment vary and have to be
applied as required. Item O, the spool piece, however, is an
_exception because it is located within the reactor shield; the
portable maintenance shield and long-handled tools are used for
maintaining 1t.

1. Shut down the'equipment. This includes the reactor and the
_ various . subsystems of the sampler-enrlcher.

2. Remove shield blocks--to give clearance and working room.

_ 3. Gather, clean, and prepare tools, shlelded carrlers, equlpment
‘and the decontamination cell.

L, Spread out blotter paper and plastic, and set up contamination
'control measures for the hlgh bay. |

5, Removc outer pleces of shleldlng.

6. Take health phys1cs precautions throughout remalnder of
procedure.

 
 

 

 

,_§8

T. ' Decontaminate as much as possible and pass cleaning swabs
~through the removal seal assembly;by using the sampler-enricher
manipulator to pickup the radioactive material.

8. Remdve sufficient shielding for access to the attachments.

9. Disconnect mechanical,'electricai, and piping connections.
Use hand tools, extensions, and stacked lead brick shielding. ‘
Rediation surveys should be made to locate and correct local streaming.

10, Attach lifting devices.

11. Rig shielded carrier and plastic bags to encase the equipment
as it clears the structure of the sampler. |

12. Transport to decontamination cell for cleanup.

13. Decontaminate and repair the unit. If decontamination is
not possible, prepare a new replacement. ‘ '

14, Install the repaired or the new component.
15. Reconnect all fittings and attachments.

16. Replace the shielding.
