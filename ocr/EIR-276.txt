WHAT IS BREEDING?

WHY IS BREEDING POSSIBLE?

WHAT IS BREEDING GOOD FOR?

Breeding is a process in which two mechanisms are occurring simultane-
ously. 1) Fissile nuclides are 'burning' and producing energy and
neutrons. 2) Some of the neutrons are transforming the so called
fertile nuclides into fissile nuclides at a rate greater than the

rate at which the fissile nuclides are being consumed.

Breeding is possible because of three factors: 1. Some fissile nuc-
lides have a rather large nett production of neutrons so that more
than half of them can be used for breeding. 2. The fertile
nuclides are converted to fissile nuclides only by the simple, and
energetically not expensive act of neutron capture followed by two
spontaneous processes which occur at a much faster rate than the rate
of neutron capture. 3. Fertile materials are present in the earths
crust at relatively high concentrations. (This also means that these
fertile nuclides must be rather stable, beta stable of course, like
all heavy nuclides they are alpha unstable. The a-decay rate must be
matched to the age of the solar system).

Breeding makes it possible to use not only the uranium-235 (the only
‘naturally occurring fissile nuclide) but also the uranium-238 which
occurs in amounts 140 times greater than U-235. These factors permit
the use of ores with low uranium and thorium concentrations even

down to granites (>50 ppM U+Th).

Practically only some reactor types are suitable for effective bree-

ding:

- all reactors with a fast neutron spectrum (e.g. sodium cooled fast

reactor, gas cooled fast reactor, molten salt fast reactor)

- one reactor type with a thermal flux spectrum (molten fluoride

thermal reactor).

Definitions

Fissionable Nuclides

Fissile nuclides

Fertile nuclides

Characteristics Neutrons of any energy Only neutrons of high energy
can produce fission (>1 MeV) can induce fission;
Neutrons with lower energy
are captured and after gamma
emission (and in some cases
then by beta-decay) a trans-
formation into a fissile
nuclide occurs.

1. The fissile nuclides must have

Z
I >%6 (=

I fissionability para-

meter)

2. The fissile nuclides must be beta
stable, because the half 1life of
beta-decay in this region of A
1s smaller th%n 10 years.

3. Because for Z >36 gives in the

realistic case Zz 92; all
fissile nuclides are alpha un-
stable.

i, To exist in the earth's crust the
half 1life of alpha decay of the
nuclide must be of the same
order of magnitude as the age
of the solar system 2109 years.

ONLY TWO NUCLIDES EXISTING IN THE EARTH'S CRUST CAN PLAY THE ROLE OF

FERTILE NUCLIDES

The fertile nuclides must fulfill the following obvious criteria

1. They must be abundant on the earth. At least a mean value equi-

valent to 1 ppM throughout the earth's crust (or more exactly in

the outer layer of the earth's crust.

2. Thus they must be beta-stable

3, Thus the Z value must lie between 90 and 94 and be even

4, These are the isotopes of thorium and uranium with t 1/2 >lO9 years

The only two 'natural' isotopes are

Th-232 and U-238

These nuclides can be transformed into fissile nuclides by simple

neutron capture and spontaneous beta-decay.

DEFINITION OF DOUBLING TIME

Doubling time To is the period of time (years) in which a breeder
produces enough fresh fissile material to fuel a new breeder react
with the same power level (Teff includes the inventory of fissile
materials out of core e.g. cooling, being transported and reprocessed).
The compound doubling time Tigip'takes into account that in a breeder
system, the new breeder can be fuelled with fissile material coming

from the total system and not only from one reactor.

DOUBLING TIME IS COUPLED WITH FUTURE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

The rate of doubling (doubling time) of the total energy consump-

tion is ~18 years and may increase in the future,

Doubling time of electrical energy consumption is ~9 years.
Doubling time of nuclear power capacity is less than 9 years.
Doubling time of breeders should be of the same magnitude.

In the future, civilization should reach a steady state when the
doubling time for the breeder will satisfy the demand with

Ts> ~30 years.

ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONSTRAINTS TO FISSION ENERGY IS THE PROBLEM
OF FISSION PRODUCT MANAGEMENT

Each fission releases ~200 MeV; 1 Joule = B.lxlolo fissions.

1 watt = B.lxlO:LO fissions per second equivalent to 6.2X1010 fission

product atoms per second.

In steady state very roughly 1 Watt of power ~1 Curie of fission pro-

ducts (1 Curie = 3.7x1010 disintegrations per sec).

All fission products are beta unstable (neutron rich nucleil)

Some fission products are long lived, comparable with a human life

span or even the life span of an element of social organisation.

THE PROBLEM OF FISSION PRODUCT MANAGEMENT TS VERY DIFFICULT AND
REQUIRES A SOPHISTICATED SOLUTION

The possibilities of radioactive waste management are:

1. Without the use of nuclear transmutation; that is the fission
product nuclides are not changed, but merely removed and isola-
ted; as for example a rocket to the sun, in discused salt mines

or in the polar ice-cap.

2. By using nuclear transmutation in which the nuclear properties are
so fundamentally changed that the transmuted products are short
living nuclides which decay after a short retention time to a
stable nuclide.

In this second class of waste management techniques a number of exotic

methods have been discussed

- gamma laser excitation (does not exist)
- underground neutron irradiation due to fission or thermonuclear

explosion (e.g. more than 3000 explosions of 100 kT per year in
USA 2000 only)

- bombarding by protons (e.g. a 10 GeV accelerator with 1 Amp)

- neutron irradiation in a thermo-nuclear fission reactor (does not
exist)

- neutron irradiation in a fission reactor (only pessimistic opinions).

THE NEUTRON TRANSMUTATION OF F.P., NEEDS A VERY HIGH THERMAL NEUTRON

The efficiency of the transmutation is limited by the criteria that the
probability of the bombardement of an atom by a neutron is ~10 times
greater than the probability of spontaneous beta decay.

A(neutron capture) 2 10-A (beta decay)

We know that for a neutron flux @ (n cm 2 ) and the capture cross
section o, (cm?/particle) the probability of reaction equals.

A reaction = @+0; therefore @#:-0 >Adecay

IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO COUPLE A BREEDING SYSTEM WITH A HIGH FLUX

We postulate a system with breeding potential and with transmutation
potential.

from this;minBR =1+ 2.75 « 1n2

for typical values;

minBR = 1.077
we know that: maxBR - vol-a- (A+L+T) +F(v=-1): when T 1s very small
(1+a) (T=transmutation rate)
For the desired BR . = 1.077 we obtain:
min
T = wv-1-a-BR(l+a)=-A-L+F(v-1)

For typical values: T = 0.364

That is, for a breeding system with a breeding potential of BR = 1.4 and
for a compound doubling time of 30 years, approx. 0.36 of FP nuclides
could be transformed in the fast system.

WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BREEDING AND THE FUEL CHARACTERISTICS
(PHYSICAL STATE: SOLID/LIQUID, CHEMICAL STATE: METALLIC, CERAMIC, SALT)?

Breeder reactors are feasable using both thermal and fast neutrons. But
for thermal neutrons, breeding is possible only in a very limited region
the thorium-232/uranium=-233 cycle in a liquid fuel reactor.

MOLTEN SALT FUEL APPEARS TO BE THE BEST LIQUID FUEL

Only limited possibilities exist for choosing a fuel to operate in

the liquid state

in a reactor.

The limiting criterium seems to be the radiolysis in the extremely
high field of neutrons, fission fragments and gamma rays.

In addition the chemical stability of the dissolved species of

thorium, uranium and/or plutonium in the presence of the products of
radiolysis is a severe problem. The ionic liquids, that 1s the molten
appropriate media for fission fuel

ionic salts seem to be the most
(see table of electronegativity

THE VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM OF CONTINOUS REPROCESSING OF THE FUEL IN A
MOLTEN FLUORIDE REACTOR HAS BEEN SOLVED

The operation of a molten salt thermal reactor as a high performance
breeder is made possible by the continuous reprocessing of the fuel
salt in a plant located at the reactor site. The most important opera-
tion consists in removing fission products (rare-earths) and isolating
Pa-233 from the high flux region during its decay to U-233 in order

to reduce neutron absorption.

It 1is also neccessary for:

- the removal of excess U-233

- addition of fresh amounts of Th-23%2

- the proper redox potential to be maintained
- the oxides to be removed

- corrosion products to be maintained at tolerable levels

In order to achieve the breeding ratio of 1.06 - 1.07 the following

fission products must be removed as shown.

Parallel to the burning of U and Pu also synthesis of Np, Am, Cm,

At present time the actinides, other than U and Pu, are removed
to the waste.

The problem of the hazard from these actinides in long term

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS FOR MOLTEN FLUORIDE FUELS ARE OF THE HIGHEST
IMPORTANCE

In order to fully exploit the unique features of the molten salt reactor
concept it will be neccessary to carry out all analyses automatically

on line with transducers located directly in the salt streams in the
reactor and reprocessing plant. The most significant items to be

measured are

- Redox conditions of the fuel: the U3+/ULl+ ratio which influences the
rate of corrosion and the distribution of certain fission products

and tritium in the reactor. This is due to the disproportionation

WUF5 + 3UF, + g® (only in molten state)

(by spectrophotometric methods also voltammetry)

2 ..+3

- corrosion product concentration (Cr+ Ti -, voltammetry)

- bismuth (polarographic method 50 ppG)

- hydrogen and tritium (diffusion to Pd-electrode some ppM)

- protactinium

- certain fission products (remote gamma spectrometry and for noble

metals mass spectrometry)

Note: Most of these techniques are carried out in hot laboratories.
The electrochemical technique appears to be the prime candidate for
practical on-line fuel analysis because of the simplicity of its trans-

ducers.

The analytical and general chemical problems in the molten chlorides
are also of interest because an important step in the continuous
reprocessing technique is the liquid bismuth/molten chloride reduction

extraction metal transfer process.

Chlorine 35 reacts with neutrons: 35Cl(n,p); 35Cl(n,a)32P

Separation of 3501/3701 is relatively easy because

1 3Te1 in the naturally occurring Cl is 24.5%

2 the ratio 2%%25 = 0,057

3 Chlorine is volatile

WITH MOLTEN CHLORIDE FUEL IT SEEMS THAT A CONTINUOUS GAS EXTRACTION
SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE
