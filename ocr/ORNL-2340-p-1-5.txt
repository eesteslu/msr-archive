FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL
records the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and other ANP
research at the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into
five major parts: 1. Aircraft Reactor Engineering, 2. Chemistry, 3. Metallurgy, 4. Radiation
Damage, and 5. Reactor Shielding.

The ANP Project personnel are engaged in many phases of research directed toward
the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A considerable portion of this research
is performed in support of the work of other organizations participating in the national
ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research ot ORNL is directed toward the
development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) are the
current major objectives of the project. The ART is to be a power plant system that will
include a 60-Mw -circulating-fuel reflector-moderator reactor and adequate means for heat
disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose of determining feasibility and
for studying the problems associated with the design, construction, and operation of a
high-power circulating-fuel reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system. Some advanced

reactor design work is now under way.

SUMMARY

PART 1. AIRCRAFT REACTOR ENGINEERING

1.1. Reactor and Facility Construction

Reactor and auxiliary components for the Engi-
neering Test Unit (ETU) and the Aircraft Reactor
Test (ART) are being fabricated by various manu-
facturers and by the ORNL and Y-12 shops. The
problems involved in the fabrication of the sodium-
to-NaK heat exchangers were resolved, and the
two units required for the ETU were received from
the Griscom-Russell Co. The units required for the
ART will be delivered in July and August 1957. A
workable program has been established for the
production of the fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers that
includes many time- and cost-saving procedures.
Progress on the production of these units is now
satisfactory.

Three prototype ART NaK-to-air radiators were
received for testing, and tests of one of the units
are now under way. |t is expected that the ETU
units will be available installation,

The boron carbide tiles, for neutron shielding, are
being produced by the Norton Company, and most
of the pieces have been received. A total of 33
different shapes was specified, and in all cases the

soon for

tiles have met the dimensional tolerances. The
facilities for the production of the tiles are now
being used in manufacturing the stainless steel
cans for the tiles at the ERCO-Nuclear Division of
American Car & Foundry Co. The required stain-
less-steel-clad copper-B,C cermet plates are also
being fabricated by ERCO from cermet material
fabricated by the Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp.
The plates will be completed during July and
August 1957,

Fabrication techniques for the production of the
reactor shells werereviewed critically, and changes
were made in the procurement program that are
expected to increase the certainty of obtaining
shells as they are needed in the reactor assembly
sequence; these changes should decrease the over-
all costs. The review of the hydrospinning tech-
niques revealed that production of the core shells
has been unsatisfactory because of axial cracks in
the equatorial region and in the reverse curve
A preforming step (by Hydroform) and re-
distribution of the wall thickness reduction between

areaq.,

 

anneals during the final spinning stages are ex-
pected to solve the problem. The preforming step
is to be included in the fabrication of all shells to
Suitable heat treating tech-
niques for the intermediate spinning steps have
been developed, and control of the grain structure
has been accomplished.

Alternate processes for the production of shells
are being investigated in an effort to reach an
earlier completion date.

be made by spinning.

Improvements in the
quality of the Inconel stock and in welding tech-
niques have renewed interest in machining of the
shells from formed weldments. The resulting
coarse grain size would be objectionable for the
ART, but for the ETU the grain structure is rela-
tively unimportant. The inner core shell for the
ETU has been fabricated by machining, and the
outer core and reflector shells are being made.
Tooling for the forging for the pressure shell liner
is being prepared, and the forgings for the pressure
shell have been struck. Cold drawing and pressing
methods are being investigated for the production
of portions of the inner and outer neutron shield
covers that cannot be formed by spinning.

Developmental work on reactor assembly methods
was continued, with particular emphasis on weld
shrinkage tests. The equatorial weld on the ETU
inner core shell was made successfully.

A satisfactory furnace-brazing method was de-
joining heavy sleeves to
thermocouple sheaths. Therefore it is now planned
to weld the fitting containing the thermocouple at
trepanned locations in the reactor structure. The
actual assembly welds will thus be heavy, and
repairs can be made without losing the thermo-
couple assembly.

With the delivery of the sodium-to-NaK heat
exchangers, assembly work on the ETU north
head was resumed. It is now estimated that the
ETU north head will be complete in December
1957. Fabrication of the beryllium parts for the
ETU has been completed, and orifice plugs for the
cooling passages are now available.

Work on the ETU facility was reactivated, and
installation of the furnace circuit main NaK piping
is 75% complete. Tests of hydraulic drive units
for the reactor pumps indicated that the originally

veloped for Inconel

Xvii
proposed units would not meet the operating re-
quirements, and therefore variable-frequency
electric motor drives are to be used. The neces-
sary equipment is to be available in October.
Work is under way on the lube-oil, water, and
helium systems. The emergency electrical system
is 95% complete, and the normal system is to be
completed by a contractor by January 1, 1958.
Present estimates indicate an ETU facility com-
pletion date of December 1, 1958, exclusive of the
reactor and associated equipment.

Details of the layout of various components in
the ART cell are being studied, and design work
on the reactor shielding and its support is under
way. Parts and subassemblies for the fuel en-
richer were completed. Minor construction work on
the ART facility proceeded, and design work on
the layout of piping and equipment continued.

The sequence of operations for disassembly of
the ART was studied further, and several methods
for cutting and measuring were investigated. A
sealant-injection system was designed for sealing
radioactive lines prior to removal of the reactor
from the cell.

1.2. Component Development and Testing

High-speed tests of Alcoa 750-T5 aluminum-
base-alloy journal bearings showed these units to
be satisfactory for the anticipated reactor service,
Therefore such journal bearings have been installed
in all the reactor pumps that have been assembled.

The full-scale reactor pump rotary assembly
which was adapted for a seal and lubricant irradi-
ation test in the MTR gamma-irradiation test
facility was completed and shipped to NRTS.
Since Gulfcrest-34 is to be used as the lubricant
in this test, the seals are brass-bellows mounted.
If a subsequent test is necessary with Ucon-LB-
140X as the lubricant, an all-stainless-steel
bellows will be used.

The aluminum ART north-head mockup in which
twin fuel pumps are installed was used for tests to
determine whether there would be liquid carry-over
into the off-gas system and, if so, under what
conditions. The fill-and-drain tank and its vapor
trap were also simulated in these tests for which
water was used as the circulated fluid. No liquid
carry-over could be detected when the liquid level
in the expansion tank was 3‘/2 in. or more. Yhen
the level was reduced to 3/4 in., droplets were
carried to the vapor trap at a rate of 0.10 in.3 per
day and to the fill-and-drain tank at a rate of 0,004

xviii

in.3 per day. Since the smallest carry-over of

concern in the ART operation has been defined as
1 in.% per day, the results indicate that fuel carry-
over will not be a problem under normal ART
operating conditions,

Performance and endurance testing of fuel pumps
continued. No operating troubles have occurred.
Similar tests of sodium pumps are under way.
Modifications were made to the sodium pump test
loops to more accurately mock up the openings
between the pump centrifuge and the expansion
tank. Examination of a sodium pump that had been
in operation continuously for 2572 hr at 3600 rpm
revealed that it had been operating in a region of
cavitation,

testing of the primary NaK
pumps was continued. Based on the tests com-
pleted in this and the previous quarter it was
concluded that the helium purge down the pump
shaft could be eliminated. A test of a NaK pump
was terminated after 4400 hr of operation with
NaK at a maximum temperature of 1400°F and a
minimum temperature of 1200°F because of failure
of the oil seal. Means for improving the reliability
of the seal are being studied. A second high-
temperature NaK-pump test loop was placed in
operation, and six electromagnetic flowmeters were
calibrated for use in the ETU and ART. The
performance of the pump in this loop indicates that
impeller and volute passage dimensions can be
controlled satisfactorily in the welding and ma-
chining processes used in the fabrication of these
parts,

is being removed for examination.

The design of the ART fuel dump valve has been
modified to assure proper alignment of the seat and
plug to prevent valve stem binding. The stem
guide nearest the plug has been removed, and a
foose-fitting spiderlike guide has been installed in
the valve seat housing to guide the plug. Further,
a mechanical backup has been added for the brazed
joint between the plug seating surface and the plug
body. A second seal bellows was added to the
valve stem to contain fuel and fission products in
the event of failure of the first bellows, and in-
ternal passages of the valve are being modified to
minimize holdup after a dump.

 
 

The NaK dump valve will be similar to the fuel
dump valve, except that the mechanical backup for
the plug braze and the backup bellows will not be
required. A prototype NaK dump valve was found
to be satisfactory in water tests, The first NaK-
valve ‘‘in-line'’ operator was unsatisfactory, but
the second one meets specifications and is to be
tested soon.

A valve available from a vendor was selected for
use as a throttling valve in NaK cold-trap and plug-
indicator systems. The valve selected was de-
signed for closure service, but modifications were
made to obtain the desired throttling characteristics
and to provide for remotely controlled pneumatic
operation,

Water flow tests of the ART sodium circuit were
continued. Improved flow distribution was obtained
through modifications of the top of the beryllium
reflector.

The thermal stability test of the outer core shell
was terminated after the forty-third cycle because
of a ledk in the expansion bellows that joins the
shell to the bottom piece of the apparatus. The
shell was examined and no dimensional changes
were found. The test will be resumed.

The vapor condenser designed for use in the
NaK dump tank vent was found to be satisfactory,
and the condenser designed for the NaK pump
purge gas is being tested. In a test of a vapor
condenser for the sodium pump purge gas, 650 hr
of trouble-free operation has been accumulated.
Tests of an experimental version of the ART ZrF ,-
vapor trap have indicated that the inlet will have
to be redesigned to minimize thermal losses.

1.3. Instruments and Controls Development

Tests of the helium-bubbler type of liquid level
indicator are being made in the fuel expansion
tank of the aluminum north-head mockup. It has
been found that this level-measuring system re-
sponds very well atall pump speeds to the addition
ond removal of water from the expansion tank.
Accurate metering tests are planned to determine
the accuracy of the measuring system in detecting
these changes. In a scheduled 3000-hr test with
fuel at 1500°F in the dynamic-level test rig, the
bubbler tubes plugged with ZrO, after about 2000
hr. Possible sources of the contamination were
leaky bellows in the fuel and gas lines, which
were discovered after the test rig was shut down,

Metallurgical examination of the liquid-metal-
level transducers tested in NaK systems indicated
that the failures were the result of defective welds.
Preliminary tests of modified units have indicated
that the operating characteristics of these units
are satisfactory for reactor service.

Twenty-two resistance-type on-off level probes
are operating in NaK pump test loops, and all but
two have given satisfactory service. In the two
units that failed, copper wire apparently oxidized
and came loose at the weld joint. It is expected
that this trouble can be eliminated by coating or
plating the wire with a suitable high-conductivity
oxidation-resistant material.

The 2- and 3]/2-in. magnetic flowmeters for the
ETU and ART main, auxiliary, and special NaK
circuits are being tested and calibrated in NaK
pump test loops. Three types of calibration runs
are made on the flowmeters — constant temperature
tests, constant flow tests, and magnetic air-gap
flux density tests. With the use of an experi-
mentally determined sensitivity, the flow readings
obtained with the magnetic flowmeter agree with
those of a venturi to better than 1%.

Two redesigned 1-in. turbine flowmeters have
been fabricated that incorporate larger bearings and
closer bearing clearances than those used previ-
ously., These units are to be tested in a NaK
pump test loop.

Tests of Inconel-sheathed thermocouples were
continued. Bending tests on Inconel-sheathed
Chromel-Alumel material in a traveling-gradient
furnace indicated that bending produced negligible
effects. Annealing of the sheath material, however,
tended to reduce the response to gradients. Tests
also indicated that brazing Inconel sleeves to the
Inconel sheaths had practically no effect on the
thermocouple wires.

A test of the ART control rod drive mechanism
was initiated to determine the over-all reliability
of the system, the suitability of the porous ceramic
poison rod material in the stagnant-sodium-filled
thimble, and the effectiveness of the sodium-
surface cooling jacket in preventing sodium depo-
sition in the drive mechanism., High-temperature
avtomatic rod cycling is now under way.

1.4. Engineering Design Studies

The program of basic studies for determining the
elastic properties of the various special shapes

 

_ Xix
2 oy
 

associated with the shell structure of the ART and
the various tube-to-shell connections has been
extended to a more general treatment of tube
connections and of conical shells and circular
flat plates with variable thickness. Many of the
complex shell shapes in the reactor can be repre-
sented as composite structures derived from these
more elementary configurations.

An analytical investigation of shell VI, the
pressure shell liner, is being made to determine
the integrity of this structure under both thermal
and pressure loads. Although the results of this
study will be the solution of specific shell prob-
lems, general routines and techniques are being
prepared for analyzing any thin-walled shell
configuration.

An experimental stress analysis was made of
the support region of the north head of the pressure
shell. The method of attaching the fuel pump
stubs to the shell of the mockup does not duplicate
the ART design, and therefore an exact model of
that region will be studied. A correlation of the
data will permit an accurate evaluation of the
ART design.

Calculations are under way in order to determine
the steady-state temperature distribution through-
out the beryllium reflector during full power
operation. The results will be used to determine
the proper flow distribution of the sodium coolant
and to calculate thermal stresses in the beryllium.

A series of calculations was made to determine
the ratio of the amplitude of temperature oscil-
lation at the surface of a circular cavity (in an
infinite medium) to the amplitude of the temper-
ature oscillation of the fluid in the cavity. |t was
found that, in comparison with the case of slab
geometry, the effects of the cylindrical surface
were important. The surface amplitudes were
smaller when the radius of the cavity was less
than one characteristic length. For a radius
greater than a few characteristic lengths, the
infinite slab gives a reasonable approximation.

A recalculation of the heat load of the sodium
system of the ART indicated an increase from 6.20
Mw to 7.02 Mw, and therefore the flow rate of each
pump must be increased from 440 to 500 gpm. The
island cooling hole flow distribution was de-
termined, and the orifice sizes were specified.

Final calculations of the cooling system for the
equatorial lead shield of the ART were made.

1.5. Design Physics

Shielding criteria for the ART were established,
and designs for various components of the ART
are being prepared. It has been found that, for
most components containing fuel, the radiations
from Lal40 control the shielding thickness and
that the required shielding thicknesses vary slowly
with time after shutdown. Shields for components
in the region around the lower end of the reactor
and for the fill-and-drain tank were designed for
periods of more than 9 days after shutdown.

As a result of the shielding studies, the NaK
pipe stubs are to be shortened from 516 in. fo 2‘/2
in. to reduce the trapped fuel volume and thus
reduce the required shielding. Calculations have

indicated that 5 in. of lead shielding will be re-

quired around the fuel drain lines and valves. In
order to shield the fuel overflow line as close to
the source as possible, a crescent-shaped piece
of lead 3 in. thick at the center and 16 in. wide
will be placed within the water shield and against
its inner shell. The vapor traps on the fuel fill-
and-drain tank were found to require 2 in. of lead.

Much of this shielding is related to particular
requirements and design features of the ART and
would not necessarily be required in an airplane.
The experience gained with the ART shielding
should be very helpful in arriving at design modi-
fications which will minimize the need for heavy,
patch shielding.

1.6. Inspection of Materials and Components

Materials for the construction of the ETU, ART,
and test components were inspected with the
intended use as the criterion for acceptability.
All material rejected during the quarter was either
down-graded for noncritical applications or was
used in experimental equipment in order to mini-
mize losses. It was found that magnetic particles
could be successfully removed from CX-900A
Inconel tubing by pickling with a 10% solution of
phosphoric acid. If metallographic examination
confirms the apparent lack of corrosive attack, the
pickling method will be adopted for the removal of
magnetic particles,

An investigation of the high rate of rejection of
welds being made in ETU NaK piping resulted in
a change from helium to argon as the purging
gas. Although argon is more expensive than
helium, a much shorter purging time, less total

volume, less gas loss, and a lower rejection rate
were indicated.

Standards were established for the acceptance of
tube-to-header welds on the basis of radiography
of accessible welds. Inspection procedures
established for the inspection of spun core shells
include metallographic inspection of samples cut
from trim areas and nondestructive testing for
material integrity. Four inner core shells fabri-
cated by forming, welding, and machining plate
The plate material and surface
were acceptable, but the weld areas were un-
satisfactory. Improvements were made by changing
the joint design and decreasing the weld rod size.

were inspected.

A portable eddy-current type of instrument is
now being used for the identification of Inconel
material. Cracks found in the cooling jacket welds
of a control rod mechanism raised a question as
to the composition of the material used, and a
check with the Metal-ldentification Meter revealed
that a 300 series stainless steel, rather than
Inconel, had been used.

1.7. Heat Transfer Studies

An approximate analysis was made of the heat
transfer in the ART core by using a model which
allowed both radial and axial variation of the
heat source term. The result showed a sodium-
coolant heat load 20% greater than that predicted
by previous analyses.

not appear to have an effect on the depth of pene-
tration, but there was an indication that in fine-
grained tubes there was a tendency toward inter-
granular attack. A summary of the presently
available data from this thermal-cycling study
indicates that for exposures of less than 20 hr,
the attack rate is greater for thermally cycled
specimens than it is for specimens not cycled.
For exposures of more than 20 hr the isothermal
and high-frequency curves are roughly parallel,
and thus equal attack rates are indicated that are
perhaps related to the chromium concentration in
the melt. Further, it appears that cycling frequency
has little effect. Data are being obtained on pre-
stressed and bent tubes.

 

A water calibration of the pulse-pump thermal-
cycling loop was obtained that showed good agree-
ment with the expression derived in a mathe-
matical analysis that related the axial and radial
attenuations suffered by a sinusoidal temperature
oscillation in turbulently flowing fluid.

Hydrodynamic studies of the sources of the
velocity instabilities in the ART core were con-
tinued in both full-scale and quarter-scale experi-
ments. A hot-wire surface element was developed
for use in obtaining the magnitude of the velocity
fluctuations at the core walls. The results of
recent tests verify earlier experiments which indi-
cated that the fluctuations reach a maximum in
the upper half of the core. A cooled thermal probe
was designed to provide a measurement of surface
temperature fluctuations ina metallic wall. Experi-
ments with various inlet configurations, guide
vanes, baffles, etc., were continued in an effort
to modify the velocity structure in the ART core,
but no significant improvements were obtained.
An analysis was initiated of the pressure variation
in two typical inlet headers to establish the magni-
tude of the source of circumferential asymmetries
and cross flow in the core inlet region.

The photographic recording of velocity profiles
by using the phosphorescent-particle technique
was continued. Distortion of the profiles by super-
imposed natural convection was noted even at a

Reynolds modulus of 10,000.

A preliminary experimental study was made of the
magnitude of the transverse pressure forces on the
walls between adjacent channels of the ART fuel-
to-NaK heat exchangers both with and without a
connecting gap between adjacent channels and the
housing. The results of these tests were inade-
quate, and the test system is being redesigned. In
a qualitative sense, however, there were indi-
cations that the gap equalized the pressures on
opposite sides of the channel walls,

Additional heat transfer and fluid friction experi-
ments were made with the delta-array heat ex-
changer in the very low laminar regime. The

effects of natural convection were clearly evident,

creased and the pressure drop reduced for upward
flow.

Conversely, the heat transfer was in-

xXi
 

A modified pressurized fused-salt heat transfer
system was calibrated with NaNO,-NaNO,-KNO,
(40-7-53 wt %); the data agree with the standard
correlations. Further data were obtained with the
fuel mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41.45.3-2.5
mole %) in a small forced-circulation system. The
modification of the half-scale volume-heat-source
core model to study the effect of core screens on
the thermal fluctuations is nearing completion.
Some preliminary data were obtained on heat trans-
fer with source-vortex flow in a vortex tube. So-
lutions were obtained for forced-convection heat
transfer in insulated pipes containing flowing fluids
with internal heat sources for the liquid-metal
range.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45,3-2.5 mole %) and LiCl-CaCl,
(62-38 mole %) were determined in the liquid and
solid states. Thermal-conductivity measurements
made by using the variable-gap method yielded
values of between 0.33 and 0.4 Btu/hr.ft.°F for the
mixture NaNO,-NaNO;-KNO, (40-7-53 wt %) and
0.8 Btu/hr.ft.°F for the eutectic mixture of LiCl
and KClI.

1.8. ART, ETU, and In-Pile Operation

A study of the time required to complete the ART
experimental program was made., [t is estimated
that 2]/2 months will be required for shakedown
tests prior to filling the system with NaK and that
completion of the planned operation of the reactor
system will require 4]/2 months from the time the
NaK system is filled.

Further studies of the ART off-gas system design
and operation were made. |t was determined that
10% more coke charcoal than coconut charcoal
would be required, and therefore the less-expensive
coke charcoal will be used in the off-gas system
adsorber beds.

Evaluation studies of ETU operation planning
were continued, and it was found that the specifi-
cations for leak tightness of components and
systems external to the reactor could be relaxed.
Also, heater-sheath thermocouples were eliminated
on all but a few special heaters.

A survey was made of the specific examinations
to be performed during the disassembly of the
ETU and the results that would constitute an
acceptable basis on which to proceed with the
assembly of the ART. The study has indicated
the advisability of flushing the ART fuel system

with a water-soluble salt after operation to remove
residual fuel. Tests to demonstrate this procedure
are to be made.

The causes of a number of the difficulties that
occurred during operation of in-pile loop No. 6
have been established by examination of the dis-
assembled loop in a hot cell. The lower heat ex-
changer Calrod heater was found to have melted
through its sheath; the nose purge-gas sniffer
line had broken near the weld joining it to the heat
exchanger outlet end; and salt had accumulated
around the pump shaft in the region between the
sump and the bearing housing. The copper rotor
and the shaft were badly scored.

A second in-pile test of moderator materials was
completed, and the capsules have been returned
to ORNL for examination. The samples included
beryllium oxide encased in Inconel, graphite en-
cased in nickel, and zirconium hydride encased in
molybdenum.

1.9. Advanced Reactor Design

Studies of reactor cores with fuel-cooled moder-
ators were continued, and two new layouts were
prepared. One of the new cores would permit some
superheating of the fuel in an annulus between a
central moderated island and an outer core region.
The moderator would be in the form of rods closely
stacked in an equilateral lattice, and the rod dia-
meter would be varied from one region to another
to effect variations in the volumes of fuel and
moderator. A boron curtain would surround the
core region, and outside it would be a closely
stacked array of rods which would consist of
about 5 vol % fuel, with the balance being moder-
ator, structure, and B C, This region, which has
been designated the ‘‘heat exchanger shield,”’
would isolate the core from the heat exchanger and
inhibit activation of the secondary coolant. The
U-tube exchanger surrounding this array would
consist of approximately 12 tube bundles. The
tubes would be as nearly straight as possible.

The fuel pump impellers would be inverted from
the position they occupy in the ART to provide
the most direct flow passage from the heat ex-
changer to the core. Three fuel pumps would be
installed to provide a capacity of about 300 Mw.

The second layout was an attempt to incorporate
a fuel-cooled moderator in a modification of the
ART. The same fuel pumps, heat exchanger, outer
pressure shell, control rods, and island base could

XXii -

o
be used. The addition of a third fuel pump might
increase the reactor output to about 100 Mw.

No internal welds would be required in this
system, except those for canning the poison and
the moderator. The welded assemblies would be
small, and leak tightness could be more readily
assured than in the more complex ART.

A study was made of the effects of various key
parameters on the temperature drop within the
moderator rods. Heating effects in the volume-heat-
source boundary layer of the fuel channel were
included. These parametric charts will be useful
in evaluating design proposals and in establishing
the desirable proportions for the rod diameters in
various regions, as well as the fuel passage sizes.

Various types of compact heat exchangers are
being studied. The study is based on experience
with the ART heat exchanger design problems. A
list of conditions which must be satisfied in the
design has been prepared, and a series of different
geometries has been delineated which may satisfy
the conditions.

A preliminary design for an apparatus for in-pile
testing in the ETR of moderator materials suitable
for use in the 1500 to 2000°F range was prepared.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY

2.1. Phase Equilibrium Studies

Phase equilibrium studies of the system NoF-
ZrF ,-UF, and the associated binary systems were
completed. The diagrams presented are revisions
and refinements of the incomplete studies reported
previously,

A tentative diagram of the low-BeF ,-content part
of the system NaF-RbF-BeF, is presented. The
ternary compound described previously as 2NaF.
RbF.BeF, has been located in the vicinity of the
composition corresponding to 2NaF.4RbF.3BeF,
and is now tentatively considered to have this
formula.

In an effort to elucidate the corrosion process as
it relates to structural metal corrosion products in
fused salts, studies are being made of the phase
equilibria in the systems NaF-CrF,, NaF-FeF,,
and NaF-NiF,. Tentative diagrams are presented
for the systems NaF-FeF, and NaF-NiF .

Interest in the possibility of obwaining oxygen-
free yttrium metal by lithium reduction of purified
fluoride mixtures prompted a study of the YF.-
MgF2, LiF-MgFZ-YF3, YF3-ZnF2, and LiF-Zan-
YF, systems. The preliminary data obtained with

one mixture in each of the systems show that
liquidus and solidus temperatures in the binary
systems are too high to permit purification in
conventional equipment but that the addition of a
moderate amount of LiF lowers the liquidus tem-
peratures to workable levels.

2.2, Chemical Reactions in Molten Salts

Investigation of the equilibrium reduction of
NiF, by H, in the reaction medium NaF-ZrF, at
575°C was continved. It was observed that K_ is
independent of the nickel fluoride concentration
studied (150 to 570 ppm) and that K, can be ex-
trapolated to infinite dilution,

Additional studies were made of the solubility
and stability of the structural metal fluorides in
NaF-ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) at 700°C. In particular,
a study was made of the effect on the solubility
of the individual fluorides when mixtures con-
taining CrF,, FeF,, and NiF, in the ratio present
in 18-8 stainless steels are added to the solvent.
The tests indicated that complete solubility of
NiF, can be achieved only at relatively low con-
centrations of all three structural metal fluorides
in this type of mixture.

A study of the reduction of FeF, by Cr® in NaF-
ZrF, (53-47 mole %) at 600°C was made in an
attempt to determine the concentration equilibrium
constant for the reaction

FeF2 + Cr© ———‘r_.Cer + Fe®

The equilibrium iron concentrations obtained were
too low, however, to permit any accurate evalua-
tion of an equilibrium constant,

Additional studies were made of the reduction of
UF, by structural metals at 600 and 800°C in the
reaction medium RbF-ZrF  (52-48 mole %), and the
results have been compared with the values ob-
tained for other reaction mediums in the alkali
fluoride binary systems. The comparison unex-
pectedly revealed that the iron concentrations are
nearly constant in the various reaction mediums.
The data for the Cr°-UF, system, on the other
hand, show the expected effect of change in cation
radius on the UF, activity, as measured by the
chromium concentrations; a similar effect was ex-
pected for the Fe®-UF , system,

Radiochemical tracer techniques were used for
further investigation of the solubilities of fission-
product fluorides singly and in pairs in molten

NaF-ZrF -UF ; (50-46-4 mole %). With additions of

 

i i
 

up to 26 wt % Ba, it was found that BaF, was
completely soluble over the 560 to 850°C tempera-
ture range. The addition of about 14 wt % CeF, did
not affect the BaF, solubility. Evidence of a low-
melting Nc:xf:-ZrF“-UF“-BcF2 eutectic was found,
Data were also obtained on the solubility of mixed
CeF, and SmF; in NaF-ZrF -UF ,, and studies of
the solubility of YF ; alone and YF 5 in the presence
of SmF3 in this reaction medium were initiated, A
study of the solubility relationships of rare-earth
fluoride binary mixtures in NaF-ZrF ;-UF , has
indicated that for CeF;-SmF,; mixtures in NaF-
ZrF -UF, the behavior is ideal and predictable.

The results of an experimental investigation of
the solubility of helium gas in NaF-ZrF , (53-47
mole %) show that the solubility follows Henry’s
law, that it increases with increasing temperature,
and that its numerical values are similar to those
obtained for helium in NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4
mole %). An experimental determination of the
solubility of HF in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) was
also made, and the results showed that the solu-
bility of HF followed Henry’'s law and that it de-
creased with increasing temperature. A negative
heat of solution was found, which indicates that
the process of solution of HF in this solvent is
exothermic. ,

Since the extent of completion of a number of
chemical reactions involved in the purification of
fluoride mixtures is judged by the HF concentra-
tion in the effluent gas, it was of interest to corre-
late the true solubility values with those obtained
from the determination of rates of simple stripping
of HF with helium from an HF-saturated solvent.
Apparent Henry's law constants for the solubility
of HF in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %), as calculated
from stripping rates, were used in conjunction with
the experimentally determined Henry’s law con-
stants to obtain values for the relative approach to
equilibrium, It was found that the relative approach
to equilibrium of the simple stripping process
varied from 17% at 600°C to 23% at 800°C.

The relationship between the heat of fusion of a
salt and its freezing point in a binary mixture of
salts is being studied. It appears from preliminary
measurements that heats of fusion can be calcu-
lated from experimentally determined freezing
points in systems where solid solubility is unlikely.

Further emf measurements were made in Daniell
cells with nickel and iron electrodes and the

solvents NaF-ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) and KF-LiF

(50-50 mole %). The results obtained, when com-
bined with those obtained previously, gave an
average NiF ,-to-FeF, activity coefficient ratio of
600 for the NaF-ZrF, solvent and 200 for the
KF-LiF solvent, A study of the system LiCl-
ThCl -AgCl is being planned in order to better
comprehend and resolve the effects of solvents of
varying acidity on the activity of a solute. The
activity of a dilute AgCl melt of approximately
constant concentration as a function of the ThCl,
composition will be determined directly from cell
measurements. Such measurements are impossible
to make electrochemically in fluorides because of
the present unavailability of a reversible fluorine
electrode,

Electromigration has been considered as a method
of separating lithium in a spent fuel from fission-
product poisons, and therefore measurements were
made of systems containing rare-earth chlorides in
lithium chloride. Experiments with Nitt, Uttt
and Ce*** in molten LiCl showed that these ions
could be separated quite effectively from lithium in
a fused chloride melt. For separation from a fused
fluoride melt, however, the practical difficulties
of finding a suitable insulating vessel and suitable
electrodes make the process unattractive.

The ratio of cation charge to ion radius has been
suggested as a measure of the relative acidity of
fluoride melts and as a basis for correlating nega-
tive deviations from ideality in fuel mixtures in
order to predict corrosion behavior. As an example
of an approximate correlation based on this prin-
ciple, a method of estimating the activity coeffi-
cients of UF , and UF ; in fuel mixtures was derived.

Studies of the oxidation of sodium and potassium
mixtures under carefully controlled conditions have
been initiated in an attempt to determine the effect
of certain variables on the final composition of the
mixed oxides. The variables under consideration
are (1) the original composition of the sodium-
potassium mixture, (2) the temperature of oxidation,
and (3) the temperature and time of equilibration
following the oxidation.

2.3. Physical Properties of Molten Materials

Vapor pressures have been measured over a
sufficient variety of molten fluoride mixtures to
provide a basis for estimating vapor pressures for
a number of unmeasured compositions. Estimated
values for the vapor pressures of ZrF ,-base fuels
have been compiled. Experiments are being made
to provide information on BeF ,-base fuels.

Approximate activity coefficients of ZrF , in the
NaF-ZrF, system in the temperature range of 600
to 900°C, assembled previously, have been corre-
lated in a convenient graphical form. The method
used to graphically summarize the change in ac-
tivity of ZrF ; with composition was to plot all the
values and then to draw a smooth curve through the
averages for all temperatures at each composition,
In this way an average curve for 750°C was ob-
tained.

An investigation of the density of molten UF, is
under way., Calculations were made, based on pre-
liminary data, that tended to confirm the pre-
viously observed apparent decrease in volume upon
melting.

2.4. Production of Purified Mixtures

Additional YF, was prepared to meet the con-
tinuing demands of yttrium hydride investigations.
The purified LiF and MgF, required in the modi-
fied reduction process for the preparation of yttrium
metal were also produced.

Several fluoride compounds were prepared for
research studies, including LaF,, GCrF,, FeF,,
NiF,, and CoF,. Also 50 g of Li’F-NaF-KF
(46.5-11.5-42 mole %) was prepared by using
Li;CO3 as the source material.

The pilot-scale purification facilities were used
for the processing of 44 batches totaling about
650 kg of various fluoride compositions, Ten
pounds of HICl, (low zirconium) was successfully
converted to HfF, in a small experimental con-
version unit,

Satisfactory inventories for fiscal year 1958 were
achieved by the end of June, and operation of the
production-scale facility was discontinued.

2.5. Analytical Chemistry

Several modifications were made in the apparatus
for the detection of submicrogram quantities of
NaK in air. With the incorporation of these refine-
ments in the instrument, the limit of detection of
sodium was lowered to 60 ppb. Because of the
higher decomposition pressure of potassium oxide,
it is thought that measurement of the absorbance
of potassium rather than sodium may provide a more
satisfactory method for the detection of NaK. The
components required for adapting the equipment to
the detection of potassium have been obtained.

The study of the butyl iodide method for the
determination of oxygen in metallic lithium was

continued. The apparatus in which the metallic
sample is dissolved was modified in order to re-
duce contamination from moisture and oxygen. With
the use of this modified equipment, concentrations
of oxygen of 100 ppm were found in samples of
metallic lithium,

Methods for the determination of traces of com-
bined oxygen in fluoride salts and metals are
being studied. It is proposed to liberate oxygen
by fluorination of the fluoride or metal sample
with KBrF , in a special apparatus, which is now
being constructed. The oxide will be released as
oxygen and subsequently measured by determining
its pressure with a differential manometer.

In the continuation of the modification and de-
velopment of methods for the determination of
contaminants in fluoride salts, a method was in-
vestigated for the determination of aluminum in
which pyrocatechol violet is used as the chromo-
genic reagent, Aluminum forms a reddish-brown
complex with pyrocatechol violet; the complex
exhibits maximum absorbance at a wavelength of
582 my, while the molar absorbance index at this
wavelength is 65,000, The molar absorbance is
linear with respect to concentration over a range
of 0.04 to 0.4 ug of aluminum per milliliter of
solution.

The development of a spectrophotometric method
for the determination of trace quantities of nickel
with 4-isopropyl-1,2-cyclohexanedionedioxime was
completed. . Methods by which the interference of
iron, cobalt, and copper can be eliminated were
established., The coefficient of variation of the
method is 5%.

The study of the method for the determination of
chromium with diphenylcarbazide in which chromium
is oxidized with argentic oxide was completed. It
was found that the coefficient of variation of the
method for the determination of 20 to 80 ug of
chromium is less than 2%, which compares favor-
ably with the coefficient of variation of 2% ob-
tained when the oxidation is carried out with
perchloric acid.

Two methods for the detetmination of zirconium
with pyrocatechol violet were compared. With the
method of Flaschka and Farah, the molar absorb-
ance index of the zirconium—pyrocatechol violet
complex is 14,000 at a wavelength of 620 my, while
that of the complex formed by the method of Young,
French, and White is 32,600 at 650 my. The dif-

ference in sensitivity of the two methods results

 

” XXV
from the presence or absence of EDTA and the
adjustment of the hydrogen ion concentration of the
test solution before or after the addition of the
pyrocatechol violet,  Either procedure can be
altered to give essentially the same results as the

other.

The investigation was continued of the appli-
cability of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) to
the determination of various constituents of fluoride
salts. It was found that zirconium can be isolated,
separated, or concentrated efficiently and rapidly
from acidic solutions by equilibration with TOPO,
As much as 20 mg of zirconium can be extracted
from 7 M concentrations of chloride with 0.5 mmole
of TOPO, while 14 mg can be removed from 7 M
nitrate solutions with the same quantity of TOPO.

The solubility of fluoride salts in molten ammo-
nium formate was investigated. The mixture NaF-
ZrF ,-UF , is soluble in this solvent if a complexing
agent is added to prevent reprecipitation of zir-
conium as the oxide. Yttrium fluoride is essentially
insoluble in the melt; however, yttrium oxide is
quite soluble, Ammonium formate was found to
decompose with time and increasing temperature to
formamide and formic acid.

Experiments were made to determine whether lead
shielding could be added to a reactor shield tank
constructed of aluminum and filled with water
without the introduction of serious corrosion
problems. Electrodes of lead and aluminum were
connected through a microammeter in a cell filled
with tap water. The current remained between 5
and 20 pa for a period of 100 hr. Since 20 pa
corresponds to an average corrosion rate of less
than 0.1 mil per 1000 hr, it is concluded that no
serious corrosion will result from the additional
lead shielding.

Absorption cells that have a 5-cm light path
were fabricated from Teflon for use in spectro-
photometric measurements when only small volumes
of solution are available. The volume of a cell is
just over 4 ml. The cells can be used in the
standard cell carrier of a Beckman spectropho-
tometer,

Batches of Ce,0; which contained Ce'4! were
prepared by precipitating cerium hydroxide and
igniting the hydroxide to Ce,0,.

PART 3. METALLURGY

3.1. Nickel-Molybdenum Alloy
Development Studies

Work was continued on the program for developing
nickel-molybdenum alloy structural materials that
will have better strength and corrosion properties
than those of Inconel when in contact with fused
salt fuels at temperatures higher than 1500°F. A
5200-1b pilot heat of INOR-8 was melted and forged
by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and a
10,000-1b heat was similarly prepared by the Haynes
Stellite Company.  The initial reports on the
casting and forging of these two heats were favor-
able. Material is not yet available from the Haynes
Stellite heat, but studies have been made of ma-
terial from the Westinghouse heat,

Chemical analyses showed the composition of
the Westinghouse heat to be within the specified
limits, except for carbon, which was to have been
between 0.04 and 0.08% and was found to be 0.14%.
A sound billet from the initial heat was success-
fully worked by extrusion and by hot and cold
rolling. Specimens were prepared for the determi-
nation of creep-rupture properties, tensile strengths,
density, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity.

Investigations are under way of the effect of
varying composition on the mechanical properties
of alloys of the INOR-8 type. A preliminary com-
parison of the times required to produce the speci-
fied elongation (1, 5, and 10%) at 1500°F in argon
of several INOR-8 compositions indicate that
(1) all the materials tested are superior to Inconel,
(2) increasing the molybdenum content is the most
effective means of improving the creep properties,
(3) increasing the chromium content from 5 to 7%
without changing the molybdenum and iron contents
produces only a slight improvement in the creep
properties, and (4) there is no obvious correlation
of the rupture life of the material with the total
content of alloying elements in the nickel base.

The nickel-molybdenum base alloys were tested
for oxidation resistance at 1600 and 1800°F. The
results were similar to those obtained in tests at
1500°F, and thus it appears that a chromium con-
tent of about 7% is adequate for oxidation re-
sistance at temperatures up to 1800°F.

xXVi -
 

Evaluation studies of alloys of the Ni-Mo-Nb-Fe
system (INOR-9) were continued. The study of the
forgeability showed alloys in this system to be
amenable to hot and cold rolling if they contain
no more than 7,5% niobium. Oxidation rates for
these alloys at 1500°F and at 1700°F were slightly
higher than those of Hastelloy B.

Seamless tubing drawn by the Superior Tube
Company from experimental nickel-molybdenum
base alloys prepared at ORNL has been received
for corrosion evaluation. Three thermal-convection
loops have been fabricated, and the fabrication of
forced-circulation loops is planned. Two forced-
circulation loops are being fabricated of tubing
from two alloys prepared at Battelle Memorial
Institute, The fuel mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(11.2-41-45,3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) will be circu-
lated in all these loops.

A new method was developed for preparing ingots
for phase diagram studies in order to assure homo-
geneity. The metal is melted under hydrogen and
chill-cast under a partial vacuum. Prior to casting,
the molten metal is superheated by about 300°F to
ensure a completely homogeneous melt.

The room-temperature and high-temperature (1200
to 1500°F) tensile properties of a commercial heat
of Hastelloy W sheet were determined after aging
at several temperatures for periods of up to 1000
hr. The response of this alloy to aging time is
most pronounced in the interval up to 300 hr,

Stress-rupture screening tests of the nickel-
molybdenum base alloys under a constant load at
1500°F in a fuel mixture environment were con-
tinued. Tests of specimens from a 4800-lb air-
melted heat prepared by the International Nickel
Company indicated that the melts were insuffi-
ciently degassed., Specimens from the Westinghouse
heat of INOR-8 had shorter times to rupture than
were expected on the basis of previous tests of
experimental heats. Similar tests at 1800°F again
indicated that vacuum-melted alloys are superior
to air-melted alloys. Based on results obtained
thus far, the degree of control necessary for the
production of commercial-size heats with adequate
high-temperature strength has not yet been attained.

Test plates of the INOR alloys were welded by
using filler metal of the same composition as that
of the base metal, No base metal cracks occurred,
but some of the welds were unsatisfactory because
of cracks in the weld metal. Coupons were pre-
pared for hardness and microstructural studies.

Since brazability will be an important factor in
the use of the INOR alloys, flowability tests were
conducted with Coast Metals brazing alloy No. 52
in a dry-hydrogen atmosphere. Flowability was
satisfactory except on alloys containing 1% or
more aluminum,

Thermal-convection loop tests of nickel-molyb-
denum base alloy exposed to fuel 107 have shown
that the least amounts of corrosion products were
found in the fuel mixtures circulated in the loops
which showed good corrosion resistance to the
fuel, in particular, the loops constructed of alloys
which contained niobium and titanium. An in-
crease in the operating time from 500 to 1000 hr
caused a significant increase in the aluminum
concentration of the fuel circulated in the loops
constructed of alloys containing aluminum.

Similar tests were run in which the alloys were
exposed to sodium., The results were similar for
all loops. A few scattered metallic deposits were
found in the lowest temperature region of each
loop, and the maximum hot-leg attack found in
any loop was approximately 2 mils in depth.

3.2. Developmental Studies of Inconel

Mechanical strain-cycling tests of Inconel were
continued, Tests of fine- and coarse-grained rod
specimens at 1300°F and at 1600°F in argon were
completed. At 1600°F the coarse-grained material
failed in fewer cycles than did the fine-grained
material, but at 1300°F the effect of the grain size
was negligible. Similar tests of tubular speci-
mens appeared to show that the tubular specimens
failed in fewer cycles than did the rod speci-
mens, but the difference has been attributed to the
method of sensing failure, The effects of grain
size of the tubing were similar to the effects of
of grain size of the rod.

Attempts toexplore (at the University of Alabama)
the effect of thermally induced strain have been
hampered by instrumentation difficulties.  The
results of preliminary tests, however, indicate
close agreement with the data obtained at ORNL
under isothermal conditions.

At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, controlled-
resistance-heating equipment was used to conduct
thermal strain cycling tests that simulated the
ART operating conditions. No evidence of cracking
or failure of either of two coarse-grained specimens
was found.

 
 

The effect of cyclic stresses imposed on a
statically loaded system is being studied at
Battelle Memorial Institute, It is the aim of this
program to define the conditions of stress under
which fatigue is the controlling mechanism for
failure and the conditions under which creep
determines service life.

Bend tests designed to simulate the thermally
induced strain patterns that will be imposed, on
the core shells and heat exchanger tubes of the
ART are being run in order to evaluate the effect
of cyclic stress conditions. The results of tests
in which the specimens were exposed to NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) showed little
effect of environment at 1200°F, and even at 1400
and 1600°F the effect of the corrosive environment
was significant only after relatively long test
periods.

The effects of various fabrication procedures and
thermal treatments on the microstructure of Inconel
are being studied. It has been found that recrys-
tallization may occur at a temperature as low as
1200°F in 80% cold reduced material and at a
temperature as high as 1800°F in 5% cold reduced
material, that the recrystallization temperature for
any specific amount of cold work can be lowered by
from 50 to 100°F by increasing the time at temper-
ature from 15 to 120 min, and that the recrystal-
lization temperature for coarse-grained Inconel is
about 100°F higher than that for fine-grained
Inconel cold reduced a comparable amount. The
microstructures that result when the material is
initially coarse grained appear to be different from
those of fine-grained material. It appears to be
somewhat difficult to achieve a homogeneous fine-
grained structure, especially with regard to carbide
distribution, when the material is initially coarse
grained.

Studies of the effect of the brazing cycle on
grain growth in Inconel tubes were made under
simulated radiator and heat exchanger fabrication
conditions. As a result of these and related tests
the maximum brazing temperature permissible
during the brazing of high-conductivity-fin radiators
was raised from 1905 to 1950°F,

An Inconel forced-circulation loop was operated
with sodium at a maximum temperature of 1250°F
but with a mass flow rate of 605 Ib/ft2.sec rather
than the conventional 132 Ib/ft?.sec. Under the
conventional condition, mass-transferred material
is normally not found, but in this loop there were

very light deposits in the cooled section. The
results of this test indicate therefore that mass
transfer may occur in an Inconel-sodium system
even at relatively low temperatures if the mass
flow rate is high.

3.3. Welding and Brazing Studies

An experimental brazing program was carried
out in cooperation with York Corp. personnel. As
a result of this study, improved methods were
developed for brazing NaK-to-air radiators for the
ART.

An improved procedure for brazing the ART fuel
fill-and-drain tank header was developed. In order
to obtain complete filleting a trepanned sump is
machined around each tube hole, and three small
feeder holes are drilled around the circumference
to provide a connection from the sump to the tube-
to-header joint.

An apparatus was constructed for high-temperature
bend tests of weldments, Because of the sim-
plicity of the specimen and the economy of ma-
terial, this apparatus may be useful in initial
screening tests of new materials.

Tests were run to determine whether copper
oxidation during service and the resultant changes
in heat transfer and air-flow characteristics would
prohibit the use of stainless-steel-clad copper
radiator fins with unprotected edges. Design
changes made 24,000 ft of fin material obsolete;
however, the obsolete material could be salvaged
if it were cut into smaller sizes and if it could be
used with the cut edges unprotected. Methods of
treating the exposed edges were also studied.
However, the tests revealed that, since the cut
edges will be parallel to the air flow and they will
be on the downstream ends of the fins, there will
be no need for edge protection.

3.4, Corrosion and Mass Transfer Studies

Seven new brazing alloys, with nickel contents
ranging from 72 to 93 wt %, were corrosion tested
at 1500°F for 100 hr in NaK and in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %, fuel 44). Only two of the
seven alloys, Handy & Harmon Hi-temp Nos. 91
and 93, which were chromium-free and had low
boron contents, showed good corrosion resistance
to both mediums. An iron-base brazing alloy (86%
Fe=5% Si=5% Cu~4% B) that was tested under the
same conditions also showed good corrosion re-
sistance to both mediums.
I* |l I||II lrlﬁ.! I

Corrosion tests are being made of the fluorinator
vessel to be used in the fluoride volatility process
for reprocessing reactor fuels. Preliminary tests
have indicated severe intergranular attack of the
low-carbon nickel material of the vessel at the
bath level.

A specimen of B,C was exposed to static NaF-
ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %, fuel 44) at 1500°F
for 100 hr, and the quantity of boron found in the
fuel indicated that the specimen had lost 30% in
weight.  Metallographic examination showed an
irregular reaction layer, which is as yet unidenti-
fied, surrounding the specimen.

Standard corrosion screening tests were run on
BN, BN + SigN,, ZrB,, ZrB, + BN, MoSi,, and
MoSi, + BN in sodium at 1500°F. Metallographic
data indicate that the presence of BN decreases
the resistance of the material to molten sodium.

Experimental studies with molten lithium were
continued. Various devices have been tried in an
effort toreduce mass transfer in thermal-convection
loops fabricated of type 316 stainless steel, but
the major effect has been merely an alteration in
the location or physical nature (small or large
crystals) of the mass-transferred deposits. Data
are also being obtained for determining rates of
solution of container materials in pure lithium.

Measurements were made of the diffusion co-
efficients of nickel in lead in both saturated and
dilute solutions at a series of temperatures. The
initial measurements were made as part of a funda-
mental study of mass transfer, Since the rate of
mass transfer inaliquid-metal system may possibly
be a function of the rate of diffusion of the solute
in the solvent, an understanding of the process of
diffusion in liquids is essential to an understanding
of the mass transfer process.

3.5. Materials Fabrication Research

Two full-size gamma-ray shielding plugs were
hot-pressed for use in the ART fuel pumps. Neither
of the plugs, which are composed of 75 wt %
tungsten carbide and 25 wt % Hastelloy C, was
the desired length, but both will be used for engi-
neering tests, The shield plugs of the pumps are
also to include a thermal barrier of very low-
conductivity material. Three full-size disks of
zirconia, which has been reported to have the
lowest thermal conductivity of any commercially
available ceramic, were machined from cold-
pressed, sintered material.

  

An extensive study is being made of the re-
crystallization of arc-cast and powder-metallurgy
niobium.  Specimens have been cold rolled to
reductions of 20 to 97% in thickness and are to be
annealed at various temperatures for various times.
X-ray and metallographic techniques will be used
to determine the rates of recovery and recrystal-
lization.  An experimental quantity of niobium
pellets obtained from the Electro Metallurgical
Company was successfully consolidated by ex-
trusion. The extruded rod was cold swaged 97%
without annealing.

A calcium reduction process was used in initial
attempts to produce yttrium metal. A reasonable
yield of Y-Mg-Ca alloy was produced, but failure
of the tantalum crucible during vacuum distillation
of the material rendered it useless. A new process
was therefore developed in which lithium metal is
used as the reductant. A good yield of high-quality
alloy was obtained in an experiment to determine
the feasibility of the new method, and part of the
alloy was purified by vacuum distillation to produce
ductile sponge material.

Zirconium hydride specimens were prepared for
physical property measurements. Data were ob-
tained on linear and volume expansion and density
as related to hydrogen content. Samples with
various hydrogen contents have been prepared for
thermal expansion measurements, Some data were
obtained on the rate of permeation of hydrogen
through metals.

Three five-ply billets consisting of cermet cores
of Lindsay oxide and nickel clad with Inconel and
mild steel were successfully extruded. One tubu-
lar and two rod extrusions were made. Tensile
test specimens are being prepared.

The fabrication of molybdenum tubing for use in
corrosion tests and as moderator-canning material
is being studied. Experimental extrusions were
made of several billets of molybdenum and of
molybdenum-containing alloys.

3.6, Metallographic Examination of Heat
Exchangers, Radiators, and
Other Components

Metallographic examinations were made of two
Black, Sivalls & Bryson NaK-to-fuel heat ex-
changers which were operated in test stands for
extensive periods at high temperatures with large
temperature differentials., Zirconium-base fluoride
fuel mixtures were circulated in both heat

exchangers,

XX1X%
The corrosion on the fuel side of the heat ex-
changer of type |HE-8 varied from zero in the
coolest section to a depth of 0.011 in. in the
hottest section. There were mass transfer crys-
tals on the NaK side of the sample from the coolest
section that were up to 0.002 in. thick, but there
was no corrosion. Tubing from the NaK inlet
header, the hottest region, had grain boundary
voids that extended to a depth of 0.016 in. on the
fuel side and there were fissures on the NaK side
to a depth of 0.003 in. Thus only 0.006 in. of the
0.025-in.-thick wall was unattacked.

Welds which were exposed to fuel at the hottest
end of the heat exchanger were also examined. The
attack was confined primarily to grain boundaries.
Where the long axes of columnar grains intersected
the weld surface there was much deeper attack
than in a weld in which the grain boundaries were
parallel to the surface. The deepest penetration
(0.016 in.) was found at craters in the welds. Un-
favorable grain orientation that led to deep inter-
granular attack was also found at the intersection
of two cover passes of a weld., It was also found
that machining of some welds, as required by the
assembly procedure, had
oriented subsurface grains.

exposed unsuitably

The results of these extensive examinations thus
revealed that in high-temperature corrosive en-
vironments the structural orientation of the weld
metal is an important factor in its corrosion re-
sistance. Most carefully made welds have, how-
ever, a surface layer oriented in such a way as to
minimize attack. |f the surface layer is removed,
as by machining, so that the improperly oriented
subsurface grains are exposed, the corrosion rate
may be expected to increase.

Brazed joints that were exposed to NaK in the
coolest section showed some roughness and de-
pletion of a small amount of the brazing alloy,
The depletion was more severe in a brazed joint
at the hot end, and there was a heavy precipitate
in the Inconel adjacent to the brazed joint as a
result of diffusion of minor constituents of the
braze material into the header. The diffusion
leaves a nickel-rich material in the fillet.

3.7. Nondestructive Testing

A simple, portable instrument was developed
with which to sort metals and alloys on the basis
of conductivity., A unique design feature of the
instrument is that the magnitude of the indicating

deflection is of no
amplitude-determining variables, such as changes

in the electronic tubes, changes in the power

supply, or any other fluctuation, have no effect
on the accuracy of the reading, This design gives
stable, reliable, drift-free operation,

The possible use of eddy-current methods for the
measurement of sheet or cladding thicknesses is
being studied. Within the range of materials and
thicknesses studied, the accuracy is better than
0.001 in,

The immersed ultrasound technique was used for
the inspection of 10,000 ft of tubing, 600 ft of
Inconel pipe, and 400 ft? of Inconel plate. There
is an unresolved problem in the inspection of plate
in that no means exist to differentiate between the
presence of defective material, which is cause for
rejection, and the presence of carbide precipitates,
which is not cause for rejection.

PART 4. RADIATION DAMAGE

4,1, Radiation Damage

The radioactive portion of in-pile loop No, 6 is
being disassembled and examined (see Chap. 1.8
for findings), and several samples taken during
disassembly of the ARE were removed from storage
for examination. Examinations were completed of
MTR-irradiated beryllium oxide slugs and their
Inconel container; little or no damage to the slugs
or the container could be found.

Eight Inconel specimens were subjected simul-
taneously to tube-burst stress-rupture tests at
1500°F at three stress levels while being exposed
in a helium atmosphere to MTR irradiation. The
results of the tests cannot be evaluated, however,
until out-of-pile tests under identical conditions,
including the high-temperature (1700°F) excursions,
are completed.

Two tube-burst tests in which stressed tubes
were immersed in a zirconium-base fluoride fuel
mixture were also conducted in the LITR. Both
tests were terminated because of fuel leakage and
high activity,
in a hot cell,

A low-intensity fast-flux exposure facility is
being designed for irradiating semiconductor and
other electronic components.

The specimens are to be examined

Efforts are being
made to obtain semiconductor samples of known
characteristics for testing in the new facility.
Several grown-junction germanium diodes of known

 
characteristics are being prepared, and the feasi-
bility of making diffused junctions has been es-
tablished. Further investigation of the anomaly in
the reverse conductance of IN 38A diodes under
irradiation has indicated the probability that this
behavior may be due to surface changes induced
by decomposition of the grease used’in constructing
the unit,

Radiation damage studies of ART neutron shield
materials are under way. Boron carbide and
stainless-steel-clad copper B,C cermet samples
are being tested under simulated service conditions
of temperature and burnup.

Estimates were made of the air-borne activity
that could result from leakage of fuel from a circu-
lating-fuel reactor, The calculations were made
for the case of fuel leakage onto the ground.

The fuel mixture NaF-ZrF,-UF, (60.8-27.4-11.8
mole %) was circulated for 332 hr in an Inconel
loop operating in a vertical hole in the LITR. The
reactor was operating for 235 hr of the 332-hr loop-
operating period, including 207 hr at full power.
All components of the loop operated satisfactorily
except the pump. Operation of the loop was termi-
nated by stalling of the pump, probably because of
bearing seizure. The loop is to be disassembled
and examined.

Four methods have been developed for monitoring
thermal flux during itradiation in the MTR of
Inconel capsules filled with static zirconium-base
fluoride fuel mixtures. The methods consist in the
measurement of the activity of the Co%® and the
Cr®! produced by the activation of the cobalt and
the chromium in the Inconel capsule and the meas-
urement of the Zr%5 and the Cs137 produced from
fission in the fuel.

Two types of activated charcoal being considered
for use in the ART off-gas adsorber bed were
tested to determine their relative effectiveness
in holding up noble fission gases. Surface area
and pore size were measured by classical ad-
sorption methods, and dynamic holdup tests were
run with radiokrypton as a tracer. The measure-
ments showed the two materials to be indistin-
guishable, but 10% more coke charcoal than coconut
charcoal was required. A method for analyzing the
ART off-gas is being developed.

 

PART 5. REACTOR SHIELDING

5.1. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

A series of tests for investigating the shielding
properties of Hevimet, stainless steel, and lithium
hydride preceded by a beryllium reflector-moderator
and backed by borated water is being performed to
aid the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft shield design
effort. Most of the configurations studied were
designed to give information concerning the pro-
duction of secondary gamma rays in the Hevimet,
stainless steel, and lithium hydride. The radiation
attenuation properties of lithium hydride were also
investigated for thicknesses varying between 12
and 36 in. Analysis of the data is incomplete.

A value of 3.22 + 0.18 barns was calculated
for the effective neutron removal cross section of
Hevimet on the basis of thermal-neutron measure-
ments made in plain water beyond a 4-in. thickness
of the material placed adjacent to the LTSF source
plate. From this value, a removal cross-section
value of 3.13 % 0.25 barns was calculated for
tungsten. This is to be compared to a value of
2,51 + 0.55 barns, which was determined from
earlier LTSF experiments.

New sets of neutron cross sections for nitrogen
and oxygen are being prepared by the Nuclear
Development Corporation of America under ORNL
subcontract 1069. Calculations are also being
performed on the age of fission neutrons in water
(involving oxygen data) and on the sensitivity
of the air scattering of neutrons to the microscopic
cross sections.

5.2, Bulk Shielding Facility

Efforts are continuing to process the raw data
from the measurements of the gross fission-product
gamma-ray spectra at short times after fission.
The small-pulse ‘‘tail’’ which appears in the
response to a single gamma-ray energy has been
successfully removed from the fission-product
spectra in a hand calculation. The approximate
Gaussian response in the region of the peak, how-
ever, introduces anomalies in the corrected spectra
which appear to be traceable to the too large width
of the Gaussian function. Oracle calculations are
being started to investigate this point and to
determine just how much of the nonunique response
can be eliminated from the observed spectra.

XXXi
 

Fabrication of some of the equipment for the
shielding measurements at the ART was initiated.
It is anticipated that the installation of all the
components at the site will be completed by the
first week in November,

A calculation was performed to determine the
high-energy portion of the gamma-ray flux at the
surface of the uranium-aluminum BSF reactor.
The flux was considered to consist entirely of
the uncollided flux plus the Compton-scattered
flux. The four sources of primary gamma rays
included in the calculation were prompt-fission
gamma rays, capture gamma rays from aluminum,
capture gamma rays from uranium, and fission-
product decay gamma rays. These sources were
Although the
used to calculate the Compton-
scattered flux tended to overestimate the actual
spectrum, the calculated intensity was considerably

divided into four energy groups.
assumptions

lower than that of a previously measured spectrum.

Two 256-channel analyzers have been obtained
to facilitate spectroscopy experiments at the BSF
and the ART. Considerable time has been ex-
pended in the testing, debugging, and modification
of the units. One unit is now performing satis-
factorily, but the second unit operates with a
nonlinearity of about *0.7%, compared with the
required +0.2%.

The design of the BSF pool bridge from which
the 15-ton gamma-ray spectrometer will be sus-
pended is now 95% complete, and fabrication is
approximately 5% complete., The design of the
measuring device which will indicate the position
of the spectrometer in the pool is 25% complete,
while design and fabrication of the spectrometer
shield are 80% and 20% complete, respectively.
The fabrication of the shield has been accelerated
by the recent success in the pouring of small heats
of the lithium-lead alloy which will be used in the
shield.

The development of a neutron spectrometer
utilizing single crystals of Li%)(Eu) is continuing.
It has been found that when the crystals are cooled
to about —140°C the pulse-height response of the
crystals results in a much sharper fast-neutron
peak of nearly Gaussian shape. In recent investi-
gations, pulse-height spectra from the crystals
operating at the temperature of liquid nitrogen
(=196°C) have been recorded for neutrons from the
(d,d), (d,t), and Be%(d,n)B'® reactions and from a

xxXXii

Po-Be source. The scintillation response of the
various crystals to gamma rays has also been
studied. The results of these investigations are
recorded.

With the exception of the high-voltage power
supply, the equipment required for the measurement
of the neutron diffusion parameters in beryllium and
graphite has been assembled. These measurements
will be made as a function of temperature by the
“pulsed-neutron method.”” Preliminary measure-
ments will be made at room temperature and at
liquid-nitrogen temperature by using an accelerator

at the ORNL High-Voltage Laboratory.

Several full-scale tests have been performed to
aid in the development of the plate-type control
system for the proposed UO,~stainless steel test
reactor at the BSF. Drop times of the plates were
studied for the condition of fall under force of
gravity only and for the conditions of initial spring
forces of 66 and 86 |b. Although the results of the
tests have not yet been completely analyzed, the
mechanical feasibility of the mechanism has been
demonstrated. In addition, tests have been per-
formed with the BSF reactor to determine the effect
of using this type of control system. For these
tests, boron-loaded aluminum plates were intro-
duced at various positions within the reactor core.
Both single plates and pairs of plates were used.
It appears that the optimum separation distance
for two plates is between 3.5 and 6 cm.

Mockups of the TSR-ll control device have been
operated in a square water-filled hole, 6 in. on a
side, in the center of the BSF reactor. The mock-
ups consisted of four or eight stainless steel or
boron-loaded aluminum plates. In conjunction with
these tests, a series of tests was performed in

. which the effect of a single boron-loaded aluminum

plate inserted in a dummy element near the center
of the reactor could be determined. In addition,
pairs of boron-loaded aluminum plates were inserted
in the TSR-I| test cell to investigate the effect of
the shading of one plate by another.

5.3. Tower Shielding Reactor i

Central fuel elements were successfully fabri-
cated for the TSR-Il, and plans have been made to
set up a complete dummy core for cooling-water
flow studies. The results of the BSF experiments
with a mockup of the internal control-plate system

 
were compared with the results of Oracle calcu-
lations that predicted the amount of excess re-
activity that could be controlled in the TSR-Il. In
addition, a prototype of the proposed TSR-Il con-
trol system was tested to obtain a comparison
between the actual and the calculated values of
the pressure required to operate the mechanism
and to determine the time required for the full

 

travel of the control plate under scram conditions.
The calculated pressure was 66 psi for normal
operation, while the experimentally observed
pressure was 100 psi. The calculated length of
time for full control-plate travel was 15 msec, while
the experimentally observed time was 50 msec.

‘Further tests to resolve the discrepancies are in

progress.

1.1. REACTOR AND FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

W. F. Boudreau

Reactor and auxiliary components for the Engi-
neering Test Unit (ETU) and the Aircraft Reactor
Test (ART) are being fabricated by various manu-
facturers and by the ORNL and Y-12 shops. As
parts are received the ETU reactor is being
assembled and the operating facility is being
constructed. Major construction work on the ART
facility has been completed, and design work on
the process piping and equipment is under way.
Procedures for disassembly of the reactor are
being prepared concurrently with assembly pro-
cedures to assure feasibility of disassembly. De-
tails of the status of fabrication and construction
are given below,

HEAT EXCHANGER PROCUREMENT

Sodium-to-NaK Heat Exchangers
W. S. Harris

The Griscom-Russell Co, has resolved the prob-
lems involved in the fabrication of the sodium-to-
NaK heat exchangers, and two units have been
completed and brazed successfully. These heat
exchangers, shown in Figs. 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, were
received on June 13 and 20, 1957, ond are being
installed in the ETU assembly. The units required
for the ART are to be delivered in July and August
1957.

Fuel-to-NaK Heat Exchangers
R. B. Clarke

A detailed analysis was made in cooperation
with Black, Sivalls & Bryson personnel of the
remaining development problems associated with
the fabrication of the fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers
for the ETU and the ART, and a workable program
was devised. Procedures were developed for the
fabrication of the various welds, and the installa-
tion of the brazing furnace was completed.

Six channels have been machined, to date, but
they are not usable because they are not within
dimensional tolerances. The sixth channel closely
approached the required dimensions, but it is
evident that the tooling for the machining must be
revised to include a rocking tool.

Holes have been drilled in a tube sheet that are
within dimensional tolerances, and it appears that
standard rods can be used for positioning the
drilling head.

Tube trimming is now being done on a Bridgeport
mill by using a mimic attachment pickup from a
standard tube sheet. This procedure reduced the
trimming time from two weeks to 8 hr. Wedge
assembly will be done by welding a flat plate to
the tube sheet and profiling the inside face to the
required dimensions from a template rather than by
welding profiled wedges to the tube sheets. This
procedure will simplify the welding, provide
greater accuracy in final positioning, and reduce

the over-all fabrication time. The outer face of
the bulkheads will no longer be profiled but,
rather, will be milled in conjunction with end
milling of the bulkheads. This procedure will also
reduce fabrication time. Steps in the fabrication
procedure are shown in Figs. 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and

NaK-to-Air Radiators

Three prototype ART test radiators were received,
and one unit is now being tested. The cores for
the two ETU radiators have been welded and
brazed and are being assembled into radiator units.
It is expected that the ETU radiators will be
available soon. Work is now under way on the
fabrication of the main and the auxiliary radiator

cores for the ART.

Boron Carbide Tiles

Virtually all the problems related to the pro-
duction of the boron carbide tiles have been
resolved, and most of the tiles have been received.
The manufacture of these pieces by the Norton
Company, while expensive (total cost, $207,000),
appeared to be straightforward. The parts were
made from hot-pressed slabs that were machined
with optical grinding tools. In all cases the tiles
met the specified tolerance, a major accomplish-
ment in view of the many odd contours which were
required. A total of 33 different shapes was
specified. A typical finished tile is shown in

Stainless Steel Cans for Tiles

The fabrication of the stainless steel cans to
contain the boron carbide tiles posed a serious
problem, since in order to reduce the neutron-
leakage gap between adjacent tiles it was neces-
sary that the tolerances be equivalent to those
for the tiles. The ERCO-Nuclear Division of
American Car & Foundry Co. was given the job of
manufacturing the required pieces. By utilizing
the facilities available for the manufacture of the
tiles as the source for dies to be used in a static
rubber-press forming operation, by relaxing non-
critical tolerances, and by making slight design
modifications, the expense of the cans appears to
have been brought to within tolerable limits. The
working estimate for the cost of these parts 'is now
$50,000, which is to be compared with an original
estimate of $125,000.

Thus far no finished parts have been delivered,
but representative specimens have been furnished

and no major manufacturing problems are apparent,
Tooling for this work is about 80% complete. Two
of the dies are shown in Figs. 1.1.7 and 1.1.8.

Stainless-Steel-Clad Copper-B ;C Cermet Plates

The copper-B,C cermet material required for
neutron shielding is being manufactured by the
Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp. Early experimental
production of the material gave very low yields,
bui close cooperative effort between the ORNL
Metallurgy Division and Allegheny-Ludlum estab-
lished that the production difficulties were the

remains high ($1.00 to $1.40 per square inch),

The ERCO-Nuclear Division of American Car &
Foundry Co. is fabricating the required cermet
shapes from the rolled cermet sheet material.
Tooling for the required parts is essentially com-
plete, The fabricating steps include cutting the
cermet material to the approximate developed areq,
hot forming the pieces in a mechanical press over
steel dies (Figs. 1.1.9, 1.1.10, and 1.1.11), and
machining the edges of the part to the required
shape by using the Elox (electric-discharge) cutting
method (Fig. 1.1.12). All phases: of the operation
have been tested, and the methods appear to be
satisfactory. Difficulty was experienced with
blistering of the stainless cladding on the cermet
during hot forming, but the trouble was traced to
poor quality control during the early experimental
stages of sheet production. No further difficulty
is anticipated.

FABRICATION OF SHELLS AND CONTAINERS
M. Bender

Evaluation of Fabrication Methods

A critical review of fabrication techniques for the
reactor shells, together with a further analysis of
the dimensional, metallurgical, and other require-
ments for these parts in a reactor, has led to a
partial reorientation of the procurement program.

As discussed below, it is anticipated that this
change should increase the certainty of obtaining
shells as they are needed in the reactor assembly
sequence and should decrease their over-all costs,

Hydrospinning Techniques

The feasibility of fabricating the reactor shells
by spinning was re-examined during the quarter,
Progress at the Lycoming Div. of Avco Mfg. Corp,
has been very slow, despite extensive relaxation
of dimensional and metallurgical requirements,
None of the twenty-six ]/8-in.-'rhick inner core
shell (shell ) pieces' produced thus far were

completed successfully. The pieces were unsatis-
factory primarily because of axial cracks in the
equatorial region and in the reverse curve area,
It is hoped that this can be corrected by the intro-
duction of a preforming step (by Hydroform) before
the first spinning operation and by a redistribution
of the amount of wall thickness reduction between
anneals during the final spinning stages.

Of the twenty ]/8-in.-thick outer core shell
(shell 1) pieces processed by Lycoming, only
15 have reached the final spinning stage. Of
these, three were close enough to the specified
dimensions to be considered for the reactor in-
stallation, but they were rejected because of
insufficient wall thickness in some areas. These
pieces had contour deviations of as much as
0.050 in., in some areas and were as much as
0.020 in. off the nominal dimension at the equa-
torial trim line. Lycoming has reported that the
use of a preforming step is advisable in the pro-
duction of these pieces, as was the case for
shell |, and they are taking steps to preform all

new material before further processing. This step
will introduce a 60- to 90-day delay in the produc-
tion of shell |l pieces. No more hydrospun shell |l
pieces are expected before September 1957,
Limited success has been achieved at Lycoming
in the forming of the ]/4-in.-'rhick outer reflector
shell (shell ). Typical stages in the spinning
operation are shown in Figs. 1.1.14 through 1.1.17.
As with shells | and I, however, attempts were
made to produce the pieces without preforming
them. While one piece approached the desired
shape (Fig. 1.1.17), it was not possible to de-
termine whether it could be brought to the finished
contour., Examination of the proposed reactor
assembly procedures and experimental weld shrink-
age control data showed that even if the part could
be produced to the finished dimensions it would be
distorted when welded to the load ring and to the
shell Il spur. The spun shell was therefore
abandoned in favor of a machined weldment.
Lycoming was requested to give first priority to
the spinning of the ]/lé-in.-'rhick inner neutron

shield cover (shell IV). In this case, as in pre-
vious instances, the preforming step was bypassed
and serious difficulties were encountered, as
shown in Figs. 1.1.18 through 1.1.21. A preforming
step is being instituted, and, if the preforming
solves most of the difficulties, it is anticipated
that delivery of shell IV pieces will be made in
January 1958. Investigations of the production
of this shell have been limited by the Inconel
stock available. Lycoming initially requested
3/]6-in.-’rhick stock, but they later changed their
request to l/a-in.-fhick material. No J)-in.-thick
material has yet been delivered, and therefore the
experimental work has been carried out with
:}]6-in.-thick stock.

Tools are being designed for the spinning of the
l/lé-in.-thick outer neutron shield cover (shell V).

10

These pieces are complex, and their production
will involve a combination of drawing, or pressing,
and spinning. Lycoming has predicted a February
1958 delivery for these pieces.

Despite the many problems, there have been some
important accomplishments made by Lycoming in
the spinning art, For example, they have de-
veloped suitable heat-treating techniques for the
intermediate spinning steps; this is a relatively
new practice in spinning. Control of the grain
structure to approach the stringent requirements
has been accomplished, in spite of the complica-
tions caused by the odd shapes being manufactured.
Further, they have closely approximated the re-
quired shapes while using a method which is
ideally suited only to the fabrication of conical
and tubular shapes.

The wall thickness deviations are, as vyet,
troublesome, but the results are better than could
have been expected with any method other than
precision machining. The major difficulty has been
that all the deviations have been on the low side
of the tolerances.

The length of time required to reach the present
state of the spinning art has led to the feeling
that alternate processes should be investigated
in order to reach an earlier completion date. The
use of this process for the production of reactor
parts is not impractical, however, and further de-
velopmental work is warranted because of the
ultimate high quality of the finished product and
the probable low unit cost for large-quantity pro-
duction,

Machined Weldments and Forgings

The possibility of machining the shells from
formed weldments was explored early in the fabri-
cation studies. |t was rejected, however, because
of the questionable quality of heavy Inconel plate,
the coarse grain structure of such plate, the addi-
tional risk incurred by welding, and the unpre-
dictable distortion behavior of the welds in the
reactor structure. Experience with Inconel and
new developments in the design have now invali-
dated some of the arguments against the machined
weldments. The quality of Inconel plate, as
measured over the past two years, has proved to
be far better than anticipated. Welding techniques
exist with which extremely reliable welds are
produced. In addition, the support spacers now
being used to define the cooling passages around
the shells have eliminated the worry about poten-
tial distortion of the shells because of the welds.
The objections to coarse grain structure are still
present, and recent data have emphasized the
importance of fine grain structure in the core re-
gions where high temperatures and severe thermal
cycling will occur simultaneously. For the ETU,
however, where these severe conditions cannot be
introduced, the grain structure is relatively un-
important,

Four ]/s-in.-thick inner core shell (shell |) pieces
were fabricated from weldments. Two of the four
pieces were dimensionally acceptable, and they
were metallurgically sound, except for minor weld
defects not significant in the ETU. Additional
pieces are being fabricated, and it is anticipated
that even the minor imperfections will be absent.

Outer core shell (shell |l) pieces are also being
machined from weldments.

Since it has been established, as stated above,
that the l/“-in.-\‘hick outer reflector shell (shell 111)
pieces cannot be fabricated satisfactorily by
spinning, the pieces are to be machined from
weldments. Fortunately, coarse-grained material
will be acceptable in this shell because it will
be cooled with sodium and will not be subjected
to either high temperatures or severe thermal
cycling. The weldments are now being fabricated
by Steel and Alloy Tank Co. and will be machined
in the Y-12 shop.

 

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

The method of fabrication of the 3/8-in.-1‘hick
pressure shell liner (shell VI) was changed from
spinning to the machining of a forging in January
1957. Tooling for the forging is now being pre-
pared by the Ladish Co. The required Inconel
will be available early in August and delivery of
the part is promised in October.

The fabrication of the outer pressure shell
(shell VIl) was originally undertaken by the Allis-
Chalmers Mfg. Co., who had, in turn, ordered
forgings for these pieces from Ladish. The Allis-
Chalmers contract was canceled during March 1957,
and ORNL took over direct administration of the
Ladish subcontract, The first shell Vil lower
forging has been struck, but it required minor
correction before shipment to the Y-12 shop. The
upper forging has also been struck and is now
being inspected. The machine work on these
pieces is to be performed by the Y-12 shop.

Cold Drawing and Pressing Methods

In January 1957 it was established that the lower
portion of the l/lé-in.-thick outer neutron shield
cover (shell V) could not be produced by spinning,
and it was decided that it must be cold drawn or
pressed. Cold drawing had been investigated pre-
viously for the production of these thin shells but
had been rejected on the basis that the deep
drawing required would cause excessive wall
thickness deviations. The horizontally section-
alized nature of the shell V pieces alleviates this
problem to some extent, and it appears to be
likely that the thinout problem will not be serious
in the case of the lower portion of shell V.

The thinout problem continues to cause objection
to the drawing method for the production of shell
IV. A favorable aspect of the situation has
occurred, however, in that the stress design con-
cept of this shell has been modified from the
original premise. The shell is now expected to
buckle in a predetermined pattern against the
neutron shield., Therefore the structural require-
ments are not so severe as originally anticipated,
and the wall thickness requirements can be re-
laxed. Investigations have indicated that the wall
thickness deviations of a cold-drawn shell IV might
be as much as 30%. Design information shows
this to be a greater deviation than desirable but

Centainers

Costly tooling has been required to meet the
dimensional requirements of even some relatively
simple shapes included in the reactor assembly.
These shapes include the Inconel containers (top
and bottom cans) which will hold the boron-
containing cermet material at the top outer pe-
riphery of the beryllium reflector and the Inconel
rings which will contain the insulation below the
outer periphery of the load ring. These parts are
being formed by hydraulic pressing and drawing at
Kaiser Metal Products, Inc., in Bristol, Pennsyl-
vania, Two representative pieces have been
formed and are now being inspected.

DEVELOPMENT OF REACTOR ASSEMBLY
METHODS

C. K. McGlothlan

Weld shrinkage tests are being made in order to
establish procedures for assembling the reactor.
In particular, studies were made of the transverse

and radial shrinkage to be expected in the equa-
torial weld of the l/8-in.-’fhick inner core shell
(shell 1). This shell will be assembled in two
halves over the beryllium island and spacers to
form the island subassembly. Twelve tests with
rolled hoops and spun shells have provided suffi-
cient data for accurately predicting the weld
shrinkage. The tests also served to familiarize
welders, machinists, and inspectors with the
problems involved in welding the island sub-
assembly,

The shell | equatorial weld for the ETU island
subassembly has been made, as described below.
A total of 0.050 in. was allowed for transverse
shrinkage, and the shell actually shrank 0.065 in.
The radial shrinkage predicted was 0.030 in, at
]/2-in. planes on each side of the weld; and the
actual radial shrinkage after welding varied from
0.005 to 0.025 in. The designed gap between the
Inconel shell and the 414 Inconel staple spacers
in the beryllium island subassembly was 0.0035 *
0.0015 in.; the calculated minimum gap after weld-
ing was 0.0045 in, on the cylindrical sections and
0.0025 in. on the tapered sections.

weld design in which the l-in.-thick wall was
tapered to ]/2 in, at the weld joint to reduce the
weld metal volume and to provide room for radial
shrinkage. The data obtained indicate that both
tests made with the new weld design produced
approximately the same transverse shrinkage and

that the radial shrinkage was not excessive.
Therefore, this welding detail has been incorpo-
rated in the reactor design.

A satisfactory furnace-brazing method has been
developed for joining heavy Inconel sleeves to
thermocouple sheaths. Varying degrees of success

were encountered in the use of the initial Heliarc
welding techniques for these sheaths, which have
0.025-in. walls and which were to be welded into
various walls and shells, The thermocouples were
to be welded to the individual fittings as the
reactor assembly progressed through its various

17
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

stages. This type of assembly would have pro-
duced many uncertain welds that could not be
completely inspected, and, since these welds
would also have been very difficult to make, a
different method of installation is now planned in
which the heavy fittings will be brazed to the
thermocouple sheaths.

Tests have shown that the heavy fittings can be
satisfactorily furnace brazed to the thermocouple
sheaths, and therefore the fittings containing the
thermocouples will be welded at trepanned loca-
tions in the reactor structure. The actual assembly
welds will be heavy and repairs can be made with-
out losing the thermocouple assembly,

A test was also performed that simulated the
welding of the lower portion of shell Ill to the
adapter spur. This test indicated so much dis-
tortion of the parts that it was necessary to revise
the fabrication procedure. Instead of the finished
parts being welded together as originally planned,
the adapter spur will be made as part of the lower
hemispherical reflector shell,

Weld tests are now in progress to determine the
shrinkage that will occur when making the equa-
torial welds on the ]/8-in.-thick outer core shell,
the ]/“-in.-'rhick outer reflector shell, the ]/lé-in.-
thick shielding cover shells surrounding the
neutron shielding material, and the 3/8-in.-thick
pressure shell liner,

The assembly work on the ETU north head was
resumed upon arrival of the sodium-to-NaK heat
exchangers. It is now estimated that six months
will be required to complete the assembly of the
north head.

A lower-deck skirt forging was received, and it
will be used in place of the formed weldment that
was originally built for possible use in the ETU
reactor if delivery of the forged part delayed the
job. A north-head welding fixture has been fabri-
cated (Fig. 1.1.22) with which to position the lower
skirt and upper cylindrical appurtenances during
welding operations,

All stress-relieving operations on the north head
are to be done in the Y-12 plant, and a hydrogen
gas drying facility has been installed in the plant

18

foundry so that suitable atmospheres may be pro-
vided in the large electric furnace available for
this job.

The first machining operation on the strut load
ring forging is complete, and the sodium outlet
pipes have been welded to this part. The struts
have been welded to the ring and the two assem-
blies are being welded together. This assemkbly is
shown in Fig. 1.1.23 as set up for welding the
struts to the forging.

Four Inconel inner core shell (shell 1) halves
were fabricated by cold forming, welding, and
machining. The machining of these parts was
done in the Y-12 shop, and two halves have been
assembled into the ETU reactor. Other ETU
reactor shells are to be fabricated by forming,
welding, and machining; the machining operations
on these shells are to be done in the Y-12 shop.
Work was started on tracing templates and holding
fixtures. The pressure shell forgings are scheduled
to be delivered during June.

The Inconel material has been received and
machining operations have been started on one set
of filler plates for the ETU. Complete design
information has been established on the beryllium
parts, and work has been started on the final
contouring of the upper beryllium reflector-
moderator hemisphere. This work, which is
scheduled to be completed in June, will complete
the beryllium fabrication,

A complete set of beryllium orifice plugs for the
island cooling passages for two reactors has been
fabricated. These parts, which will be inserted
in the lower island half, are sized to give the
proper flow distribution in the parallel passages.

The remaining work on the ART beryllium,
principally the upper hemisphere contouring, is
not scheduled to be done until the ETU reflector
assembly has been completed. In practically all
cases it is planned to complete the major ETU
subassembly before work is started on the ART
subassembly so that unforseen difficulties may be
avoided on the second reactor assembly,

As stated above, work is under way on the ETU
island assembly. The upper portion of the beryl-
lium with the staple spacers installed, the upper
core shell half, the bellows expansion joint, and
the vane mounting are shown in Fig. 1.1.24, In
Fig. 1.1.25 the assembled beryllium halves are
shown, and in Fig. 1.1.26 the shell halves are in
place for welding.

The staple spacers were sized and inserted in
the beryllium without difficulty., The edges of
the spacers matched the contour of the beryllium
to within 0.002 in.; and since the shells and
beryllium were within design tolerance, all the
spacers could be made the same height,

The beryllium parts were degreased in trichloro-
ethylene and vacuum dried at 200°F for 24 hr. The
equatorial weld was made without difficulty and
the weld shrinkage values were within the design
tolerance limits.

ETU FACILITY
P. A. Gnadt A. M. Smith
NaK System

The installation of the furnace circuit main
NaK piping is approximately 75% complete. The
considerable difficulty encountered in obtaining
acceptable welds was attributed to inadequate

purging of large sections of pipe and the resulting
porosity in welds. Therefore techniques were
developed for isolating weld areas and removing
residual air from the large system volume. As a
result of these improved techniques the weld re-
jection rate was considerably lowered.

The purging difficulties indicated that all
auxiliary devices, such as thermocouple wells,
pressure-measuring devices, and other small
appurtenances attached to the main piping, should
be welded into the pipes before the main piping
runs were completed. The original plan to attach
all appurtenances to the system after the main
piping runs were completed was developed in an
effort to reduce damage which might result during
later phases of construction. The change in the
assembly sequence as a result of the purging
problem has caused component fabrication dif-
ficulties, because the appurtenances had not
been scheduled for fabrication until late in 1957,

Work on the main piping was not, however, slowed;
the appardenances will be welded into the system
as soon as they are available.

Two NaK pump stationary assemblies have been
set in place in the support structure. Fit-ups
on the main piping have been made, and welding
is now in progress.

The main piping of the isothermal NaK circuit
will be assembled after completion of the furnace
circuit piping. One NaK pump stationary assembly
has been installed in this circuit, and the other
pump stationary assembly and throttle valves
are scheduled for delivery in June. All main
pipes are formed and are ready for installation
as soon as system components are received.
Thermocouple wells are to be available for in-
stallation before the main pipes are assembled
in the structure.

The main piping of the auxiliary NaK circuit
cannot be started until pumps and radiators are
available. Present plans are to assemble the
main piping on these circuits following completion
of the isothermal circuit main piping. One radiator
is to be available for installation in July.

NaK dump tanks and lines cannot be assembled
into the facility until the dump valves are avail-
able, and dump valve procurement is dependent
upon tests which are being made of a prototype
unit (Chap. 1.2, ‘‘Component Development and
Testing''). If the test of the prototype unit is
successful, the production units will be fabri-
cated.

Cold-trap and plug-indicator system fabrication
has been stopped temporarily pending the results
of a re-evaluation of the pressure drops in the
NaK systems. Throttle valve procurement, line
sizes, and system locations are dependent upon
the results of this analysis,

All major components for the main air duct
system are on hand. Completion of this portion
of the work is contingent upon the results of a
high-temperature leakage test of the louvers.
The presently installed radiator test duct is to
be used for the test, and assembly work will
not proceed until after the test is completed.

Control Room

The control room housing and the air conditioning
system are approximately 90% complete. Design
work on panel layouts and controls has been
started,  Delivery of the panels is presently

22

scheduled for August 1958. The Instrumentation
and Controls Division has assumed the responsi-
bility of procurement, connection, and checkout
of wiring and piping between the panels and
associated sensing elements.

Gas and Hydraulic Systems

Tests of hydraulic drive units for the reactor
pumps indicated that the originally proposed
units would not meet the operating requirements.
The hydraulic drives have therefore been dis-
carded in favor of variable-frequency electric
motor drives. The necessary equipment, including
motor-generator sets, magnetic clutches, and
drive motors, will be available in October if
present commitments are met.

The vendor, Bowser, Inc., for the lube-oil
packages has two packages 90% complete, but
late delivery of the lube-oil pumps from a sub-
contractor is delaying the completion of the units.

Intermediate runs of the lube-oil, water, and
helium piping are approximately 80% complete,
but revisions must be made to the piping systems
now installed. Detailed engineering for these
revisions and for connections to the equipment
located in the basement area is now being started.
Revisions to and completion of the piping in the
basement area are scheduled to be done by a cost-
plus-fixed-fee contractor by January 1, 1958,

Electrical System

The emergency electrical system, which consists
of the 300-kw diesel generator unit and associated
switchgear and supply leads, remains 95% com-
plete. All design work is complete for this phase
of the work, and the installation work will be
completed by January 1, 1958.

Design drawings for the normal electric supply
system have been released for construction by
a cost-plus-fixed-fee contractor. This contractor
will install all remotely operated voltage-adjusting
units, distribution panels, transformers, switches,
wiring, associated auxiliary equipment for the
electric heater supplies, .motor control center,
motor-generator sets, cable trays, and wiring
and will connect all electric power leads to the
equipment in the basement area. Also, this
contractor will install all cable trays on the
track floor, except those in the cell and NaK
piping areas, and will install and connect the
speed control units and resistors for the NaK
motors. All major equipment is on hand for this
work, which is scheduled for completion by
January 1, 1958,

Design work on heaters for individual com-
ponents is approximately 25% complete. Instal-
lation of heaters and thermocouples is scheduled
for the first quarter of calendar year 1958,

General Construction Status

Designs for support structures, cross bracing,
and walkways in the NaK piping area are approxi-
mately 75% complete, and pipe hanger and support
designs are approximately 90% complete. Most
of the major design work not covered specifically
above is completed. Some minor design work

remains that will not affect the construction
schedule.
The facility is shown in Fig. 1.1.27 as it

appeared on May 17, 1957. The control-room
enclosure may be seen, as well as the NaK piping
main-support columns and cell-wall-mockup main
piping of the NaK furnace circuits, with the two
NaK pump stationary units mounted at the top
of the structure., In the background is the portion
of the main air duct in which the radiators will
be suspended. In the foreground are the two
reactor support pedestals.

Present estimates indicate an ETU facility
completion date of December 1, 1958, exclusive
of the reactor and associated equipment.

ART COMPONENT DESIGN
A. M. Smith W. E. Thomas

Design work on components to be installed in
the ART cell has been directed primarily to the
completion of details of various layouts that
were previously scheduled to be completed by
outside vendors. The dependency of one design
upon another and the limited space inside the
cell have made preparation of these layouts very
time-consuming.

A review of the shielding requirements is essen-

shell to assist in supporting the equatorial section
of the lead shielding was completed. Design
layouts for changing the north- and south-head
shielding from segmented pieces to a single
piece are being made. Preliminary designs are
also being made for the cooling-coil layout. The

design of the bag for the water shield has been
started but cannot be finished until the lead-
shield design is complete.

Design work was completed on the column
footings and connections to the support pedestals
for the reactor, as well as details of the support
platform.  Shop estimates of the time required
for fabrication of the support platform are in
excess of 4000 man-hours.

The decision to use electric rather than hydraulic
drives for the four reactor pumps eliminated the
need for an outside containment system for the
hydraulic drive units and twelve pipe penetrations
through the cell-wall auxiliary-piping junction
panels. The junction panel drawings are to be
revised, and the existing panels will be reworked.

Shop drawings of the main NaK manifolds,
prepared by Midwest Piping Company, Inc., are
being reviewed. Shop drawings for the auxiliary
NaK manifolds are to be completed during June.

All parts and subassemblies for the fuel enricher
were completed. Final assembly of the enricher
will be done just prior to installation inside the
cell.

Construction work on the ART facility has been
contracted in four stages determined by the design
program. The first three stages, packages |, A,
and Il, which included building alterations, building
additions, cell installation, installation of aux-
iliary-services piping, installation of diesel
generators and facility, electrical control centers,
and spectrometer-room electrical and air-condi-
tioning equipment, were completed prior to this
report period. The fourth stage, package lilA,
which included a distribution system for supplying
electrical power to the pipe heaters and equipment
heaters, a dry-air plant, and a building to house
the air plant and wound-rotor-motor controllers,
was completed May 10, 1957. However, a modifi-
cation was made to that contract package at a
cost increase of $17,480 and a time extension
of 75 days that established a new package lIIA

Design work is proceeding on the layout of
piping and equipment in the radiator pit area.
Preliminary reviews have indicated that access
to the equipment will be inadequate with the
existing design. Relocation of equipment is
being considered, and work has started on a
design model of the area. Work is also proceeding
on a model of the main and auxiliary radiator
and penthouse area. Procedures for assembly
of the main and auxiliary radiator equipment have
been prepared, and procedures for assembly of
the special radiators and for replacement of all
radiators are now being prepared. A review of
the structural framework for the main and aux-
iliary radiators is being made in order to determine
the minimum space which can be occupied by
the radiators.

A building and crane load test was performed
on the 30-ton crane to determine crane performance
and building deflection at loads of 75,000, 80,000,
and 85,000 Ib, in anticipation of an increase in
process equipment weights. With loads positioned
at critical points with regard to structural load-
carrying ability, no vertical deflections were
detected for any building column,

The sequence of operations for disassembly of
the ART has been further explored in an.effort to
develop a workable scheme for obtaining internal
samples and dimensions and for visually examining
various parts. In general, the presently proposed
procedure follows a component removal method
to expose each reactor element with a minimum
of distortion.

The principal tool within the disassembly hot
cell, in addition to the handling cranes and mani-
pulators, will be a turntable capable of supporting,
rotating, and lifting the reactor. Two major cutting
tools will be included which will be mounted on

cutting methods will be determined experimentally,
but the mounting arrangement will be adaptable
to several systems. Direct observation by means
of windows, TV cameras, etc., will be provided
to give the information necessary to direct the
disassembly operation. Supplementary photographic
aids, replication, and optical measurement devices
will permit comparisons and provide means for
recording the observations. Because of the high
space utilization within the concentrated area of
the hot cell, it will be necessary to decontaminate,
rinse, and move major reactor parts to storage as
they are removed. Cutting methods and measuring
techniques are being studied, and a sealant-
injection method was designed for sealing off
radioactive lines when they are severed.

lead-base wire produced replicas with fine surface
detail and good dimensional reproducibility, as
shown in Fig. 1.1.35, but the possible harmful

make possible the reproduction of vertical surfaces

PUMP DEVELOPMENT TESTS

E. R. Dytko' A. G. Grindell
Bearing, Seal, and Lubricant Tests
D. L. Gray W. K. Stair?

High-speed tests of Alcoa 750-T5 aluminum-
base-alloy journal bearings with both Gulfcrest-34
and Ucon-LB-140X as lubricants were successfully
concluded. Each unit was tested for more than
1000 hr with transverse loads of up to 600 Ib of
force at the bearing. No measurable wear was
observed with either lubricant. As a result of these
tests, aluminum-alloy journal bearings have been
installed in all the reactor pumps that have been
assembled.

A test of the fuel pump purge system was run to
determine whether lubricant leakage past the lower
seal would be removed from the catch basin by a
50-liter/day helium sparge flow or would be forced
down the shaft annulus by the maximum allowable
ART helium purge flow of 2500 liters/day. In an
initial test with Gulfcrest-34 as the lubricant, the
leakage was insufficient for conclusive data to be
obtained. Since it cannot be anticipated that such
low leakage will exist under reactor operating
conditions, it is planned to rerun the test with
Ucon-LB-140X as the lubricant, inasmuch as the
incidence of seal leakage with the Ucon fluid has
been higher than that with Gulfcrest-34.

A Vyran elastomer O-ring was subjected to a
high-temperature cycling test in Ucon-LB-140X in
order to determine the effects of time and tempera-
ture. It was found that this elastomer would not
be satisfactory for ART use because of the perma-
nent deformation that occurred rapidly at high
temperatures. The permanent deformation, known
as ‘‘ high-temperature set,’’occurred in shorter and
shorter times as the test temperature was increased.

ation test® in the MTR gamma-irradiation test

facility was bench tested for 52 hr at 3000 rpm
and 114 hr at 4000 rpm, and the seal leakage was
found to be relatively low. The pump unit was
then enclosed in the pump can, and the complete
rotary assembly and its associated hydraulic drive,
electrical power system, instrumentation, and con-
trols were tested as a unit. The unit was found to
be satisfactory and was shipped to NRTS for
irradiation.  Contrary to a previous statement,?
the seals in the rotary assembly are brass-bellows
mounted, since a decision was made to run the
first test with Gulfcrest-34 lubricant, which is
compatible with copper alloys. If a subsequent
test is necessary with Ucon-LB-140X as the
lubricant, the all-stainless-steel bellows will be
utilized.

Twin-Fuel-Pump Water Tests
J. W. Cooke! R. G. Jenness

The aluminum ART north-head mockup in which
twin fuel pumps are installed was used for tests to
determine whether there would be liquid carry-over
into the off-gas system and, if so, under what
conditions. It was desired to know whether there
would be continuous droplet carry-over in the off-
gas flow during normal ART operation and whether
gross carry-over would occur when the liquid level
in the swirl tank was increased by the system
ingassing that would occur if one pump were
stopped. For these tests in which water was used
to simulate the fuel and air was used to simulate
the helium purge gas, the ART off-gas line and
separator were duplicated in glass so that droplet
carry-over could be observed. The fill-and-drain
tank and its vapor trap were also simulated; the
tank used had a capacity of 1 gal. A cold-air purge
rate of 70,000 standard liters per day was used
that was calculated to be equivalent to 1]/2 times
the maximum hot-helium purge rate in the ART of
6000 standard liters per day. In calculating the
equivalent purge rates it was assumed that:

1. the droplet size distribution for both the air-
water and the helium-fuel systems approximated
a normal distribution curve,

2. the average water-droplet diameter was three
times that of a fuel droplet based on physical

33
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

properties of the two liquids and on the use of
identical droplet-making configurations,

3. the total volume of liquid going into droplets
per unit time was equal for both systems under
similar pump conditions,

4. any droplet, in either system, that rose above
the vertical section of the off-gas line was
carried over.

In order to distinguish between liquid carry-over
due to condensation of water vapor and the liquid
actually carried over as droplets, a tracer material,
sodium dichromate, was added to the water. Also,
to minimize the evaporation of the water droplets
formed in the expansion tank, the purge air was
saturated with water before it entered the expansion
tank. Detection and measurement of the liquid-
droplet carry-over were accomplished by visual
inspection for droplets in the transparent off-gas
line, by discoloration of vapor-trap and fill-and-
drain-tank residues, and by quantitative analysis
for the total weight of the sodium dichromate in the
residues.

Several test runs of approximately 6 hr were
made with equal pump speeds of 2700 rpm, equal
loop flow rates of 645 gpm, a purge air flow rate
of 70,000 standard liters per day, and various
expansion tank liquid levels. No droplet carry-
over could be detected by any of the three methods
described above when the expansion tank water
level was 31/2 in. Droplets could be seen to hit
the walls of the off-gas line between the expansion
tank and the separator when the expansion tank
water level was reduced to 'II/? in. When the water
level was reduced to 34 in:., quantitative analysis
of residues indicated that water droplets were
carried to the vapor trap at a rate of 0.10 in.? per
day and to the fill-and-drain tank at a rate of
0.004 in.3 per day. Since the smallest carry-over
of concern in ART operation was defined as 1 in.3
per day and since approximately 1]/2 times the
calculated equivalent purge flow rate was used,
the results indicate that fuel carry-over will not
be a problem under normal ART operating con-
ditions. A final evaluation of the carry-over will
be made in ETU operation.

Tests for determining the effect of stopping one
pump were started with equal pump speeds of
2700 rpm, equal loop flow rates of 645 gpm, an
expansion tank level of 3]/2 in., ond the bypass
valve between the pump inlets closed. Off-gas

purge flow rates of 1000, 3000, and 6000 standard

34

liters of air per day were used. These flow rates
cover approximately the same range in the aluminum
north-head expansion tank as will exist in the
ART expansion tank. In each test, one pump was
suddenly stopped while the other pump either con-
tinued to operate at the initial speed or at a re-
duced speed. The liquid carried over to the fill-
and-drain tank was measured for different time
periods after stoppage of one pump, and the results
are shown in Fig. 1.2.1. During these tests there
was no liquid carry-over to the vapor trap.

Fabrication, assembly, and leak testing of the
sodium region of the aluminum north-head mockup
were completed. Ledk testing posed a much
greater problem than was anticipated, but after
numerous efforts, including rewelding and appli-
cation of an epoxy resin, the aluminum test piece
was leak-tight at a hydrostatic pressure of 55 psi.
The pumps, external piping, and instrumentation
are now being installed.

Fuel Pump High-Temperature Performance Tests
P. G. Smith H. C. Young'

The performance tests, initiated previously,* of
an ART fuel pump with NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4
mole %, fuel 30) as the circulated fluid were termi-
nated after 2880 hr of operation because fuel was
inadvertently allowed to freeze in the two pressure
transmitters.  Operation was in the temperature
range of 1200 to 1300°F, with flow rates and pump
speeds that varied over a considerable range around
the ART design point. Head and flow-rate per-
formance data were obtained at pump speeds of
2400, 2700, and 3000 rpm. At design conditions,
the head appeared to be about 1 ft lower than that
found in tests with water, but this difference is
well within the range of experimental error.

Test operation of this pump will be resumed after
a thermal barrier has been inserted in the pump-
barrel radiation-shield region and a bubble-type
liquid-level indicator has been installed in the
pump surge tank. Tests are to be made of pump
priming and of the performance and accuracy of the
bubble-type liquid-level indicator. Pump-barrel
temperature gradients will be measured, and checks
will be made on head vs flow rate and on cavitation
with the use of Taylor pressure-measuring devices.

Fuel Pump Endurance Tests
P. G. Smith

The ART fuel pump being tested for endurance
with fuel 30 as the circulated fluid has accumulated
a total of 3200 hr of continuous operation at 2700
rpm. The wetted portions of the pump (impeller,
volute, and the containing vessel) have been
thermally cycled 582 times over the temperature
range of 1100 to 1400°F. The pump-surge-tank
helium-gas pressure is being maintained in a range
that would induce cavitation in the impeller. No
operating troubles have been experienced during
this test. The oil leakage rate of the lower sedl
of the pump has continued to be 5 cm®/day, and
there has been no measurable leakage from the
upper seal. The test will be terminated for exami-
nation of the pump in the near future, and a new
fuel pump rotary element will be placed in operation
for a further endurance test.

The hydraulic drive system has also given
trouble-free continuous operation throughout the
test, in contrast to previous experience. The
improvement is believed to result from maintenance
of a 120-psig pressure on the discharge side of the
hydraulic motor. The back pressure holds the
pistons against the wobble plate at all times, in
accordance with the manufacturer’'s recommenda-
tions.

Performance data were obtained for the ART

of the seal vanes on the centrifuge cup lid was
increased from 5.5 to 5.625 in. in order to reduce
the inward flow to the centrifuge across the cup
lid. The data obtained, as shown in Fig. 1.2.2,
are essentially the same as those obtained in
earlier tests. It was found that ingassing of the
system fluid occurred at reduced main loop flows
when the operating conditions were in the region
to the left of line A in Fig. 1.2.2. Design modifi-
cations have been made to the loop to accommodate

The pump and test equipment are presently being

after the leading edges of its impeller vanes at
their junction with the hub were ground off to

pump was operated for 500 hr without a helium
bleed down the pump shaft annulus but with a
continuous helium bleed of 50 liters per day through
the oil catch basin. Lower-seal oil leakage, which
averaged 15 cm® per day, was sparged properly
and no operational difficulties were encountered.
The rotary assembly was dismantled, inspected,

operation (2600-hr total). Based on this 500-hr
test and the 408-hr test conducted in the previous
quarter, the helium purge down the pump shaft
annulus has been eliminated.

The pump was next placed on endurance testing
ot a minimum NaK temperature of 1200°F and a
maximum NaK temperature of 1400°F. Additional
performance and cavitation data taken after a total
operating period of 4200 hr correlated well with
earlier data. The oil leakage through the lower
seal had increased from an average of less than
20 cm® per day to over 200 ¢cm® per day, and the
power trace indicated momentary increases as
large as 6 kw. In view of the increased oil leakage,
it was thought that these surges could be due to
rough seal faces, and operation was continued.

After 4400 hr of operation the helium pressure in
the pump tank increased to approximately 25 psi
above the regulated helium supply, ond shortly
thereafter the NaK level in the pump tank rose
until the oil catch basin was flooded. The pump
was stopped, and the rotary element was removed
for inspection. It was found that oil had been
leaking down the pump shaft. Large quantities of
oil residue were lodged in the thermal-barrier area
above the impeller. Carbon buildup had scored
the pump shaft and is believed to have caused the
power trace surges.

The oil had leaked down the shaft, at least
during the last week of operation, even though
200 cm® per day or more of the leakage was removed
by the catch-basin helium purge. It is therefore
postulated that when the oil leakage became ex-
cessive the oil mixed with the NaK to such an ex-
tent that its vapors resulted in a substantial increase
in pressure in the pump tank, and considerable
quantities of vapor were entrained in the pumped
liquid. When the excess pressure was vented, the
contained liquid and entrained vapor expanded to
such an extent that the pump tank filled and over-
flowed. The ingassing and pressure buildup could
also have been caused by leakage of gas into the

NaK through a bellows failure in a pressure-
measuring device or through a failure in a valve
bellows. Both these possibilities are being investi-
gated. The reliability of the lower seal is being
studied to determine means for improving it. The
test loop is being cleaned for further testing.

At termination of this test because of the oil-
seal failure, the pump had completed 4000 hr at a
NaK temperature of 1200°F and 400 hr at 1400°F.
During the 4400 hr of operation the pump rotary
element was removed three times for inspection.
The elastomer secondary glands of the oil seal
were replaced at each inspection, and the original
rotary element was approved for further testing.
The critical dimensions of the rotary element
remained constant, and the volute mouth dimensions
remained essentially constant after initially in-
creasing an average of 0.010 in., as described
previously.® The oil seals were designed for a
life of 2000 hr, and, with exception of the elastomer
secondary glands, which are time-temperature
sensitive, they operated satisfactorily. It is
believed that by providing a double rather than a
single elastomer seal, the seal should prove to
be satisfactory for a somewhat longer operating
time than indicated by this first endurance test.

The major difficulty encountered during the test
was partial plugging of the off-gas reflux condenser
on the pump tank. Although such plugging occurred
three times, functioning of the condenser was
satisfactorily restored on each occasion by heating
it to approximately 600°F. The cold trap tended to
plug during the last 500 hr of operation, and there-
fore its piping will be removed and inspected. The
spark-plug probes on the pump tank gave reliable
service throughout the test; only one short occurred.
The resistance-type level indicator in the pump
gave reliable NaK-level measurements throughout
the test and will be kept in service for further pump
testing.

A second high-temperature NaK-pump test loop
was placed in operation, and six electromagnetic
flowmeters were calibrated for use in the ETU and
ART. The performance and cavitation data ob-
tained agreed very well with the data obtained with
the loop described above. It therefore appears that
impeller and volute passage dimensions can be
controlled satisfactorily in the welding and mo-
chining processes used in the fabrication of these
parts.

38

A previous error in calculating the velocity head
across the pump resulted in the performance curves
obtained during the quarter for the auxiliary NaK
pump being slightly lower than those reported
previously.® The pump efficiency is about 1% less
than reported previously, and the minimum suction
pressure required to suppress cavitation is slightly
more. Therevised performance curves are presented
in Fig. 1.2.5, and the minimum pressures required
to suppress cavitation during operation with NaK,
based on the results of water tests, are given in
Table 1.2.1. The revised performance charac-
teristics of the auxiliary pump are adequate to
meet the design requirements of the ART.

(56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70) in test stand SHE-C was
interrupted after a total of 1438 hr of operation by
failure of York Corp. 500-kw radiator No. 16, which
was also being tested in this stand. The primary
purpose of this test was to compare the performance
and corrosion effects of fuel 70 with those of fuel
30, which was used in all previous heat exchanger
tests. The test program was designed to duplicate
the test history of the previously operated’ Process
Engineering Corp. heat exchanger No. 2, type SHE-7.
At the time of the radiator failure, the test system
was operating normally at approximately ART de-
sign temperature and flow conditions. The heat
exchanger fuel inlet temperature was 1600°F, and
the radiator NaK inlet and outlet temperatures
were 1500 and 1100°F, respectively. The radiator
is currently being removed from the test stand for
metallurgical examination.

Concurrent with radiator and heat exchanger
testing, a radiator fin oxidation test was performed
in test stand SHE-C by inserting the fin samples,
shown in Fig. 1.2.6, in the hot air stream. The
purpose of this test was to determine the depth
of copper oxidation which would occur when stain-
less-steel-clad copper fin material with untreated
edges was exposed to high-temperature air flow.
The results of these tests, as reported in Chap. 3.3,
‘“Welding and Brazing Studies,’’ indicate that fins
with untreated edges may be used in radiator
fabrication.

results of the test should be helpful in determining
the accuracy with which heat exchanger life can
be predicted by present stress analysis techniques.

Testing of the York Corp. ART prototype radiator
No. 1, previously described,® was started in test
stand |HE-C, and heat transfer data are currently
being taken. A plot of the room-temperature air-
pressure-drop data for this radiator is presented

in Fig. 1.2.7.

During startup of this test an experiment was
conducted to determine the effect on oxide content
in a new NaK system of dumping the NaK while
hot, allowing it to cool, and then recharging the
system. The NaK was circulated at 1200°F with
the circulating cold trap operating as near the
loop temperature as possible (outlet temperature,
1100°F) until the plug indicator readings reached
equilibrium at approximately 1015°F. The NaK
was then dumped and allowed to cool to 200°F
before the loop was recharged and the 1200°F
isothermal condition was established. The plug-
indicator readings then reached equilibrium at
approximately 950°F. The small reduction in oxide
content obtained by the hot dump may have resulted

40

from inability to maintain the cold trap at the same
temperature as that of the remainder of the system.
Since the cold trap was not drained and had col-
lected oxide during the initial isothermal operation,
it could have acted as a source of oxide during the
subsequent operation. This test does not neces-
sarily invalidate the use of a hot dump for system
cleanup, but it does indicate that it would be of
little use in ETU and ART operations.

The cold trap installed on this test stand (IHE-C)
is 8 in. in diameter and, except for its ]/2-in.-OD
(rather than 5.8-in.-OD) stainless steel cooling coil,
is identical to the ART main NaK system cold
traps. No plug-indicator readings were taken while
this cold trap was being placed in operation. A
period of approximately 24 hr was required to reduce
the cold-trap outlet temperature to 350°F so that
cold-trap cooling could be transferred from air to
water. When water cooling was applied, the NaK
flow rate was increased to 1.2 gpm to maintain
an outlet temperature of 300°F. Plug-indicator
readings taken immediately following this operation
showed no definite plugging temperature, which,
for this system, means that the oxide saturates the
NaK at a temperature well below 600°F.

Valve Development Tests

Fuel Dump Valve. ~ The presently proposed
configuration of the fuel dump valve incorporates
a number of modifications to the original design.
Formerly the stem and plug were aligned by two
guides in the bonnet, which operated on the stem,
and misalignment and valve-stem binding occurred
during high-temperature operation. It is thought
that the assembly became warped when the final
closure weld was being made. The stem guide
nearest the plug has been removed, and a loose-
fitting spiderlike guide has been installed in the

 

90n assignment from Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

valve seat housing to guide the plug. With this
arrangement it is unlikely that gross seat-to-plug
misalignment can occur. Final alignment is ac-
complished by the plug sliding freely into place
in the seat.

The valve-plug seating surface is, as before,
brazed to the plug body, but in order to eliminate
the possibility of a failure of this braze when the
valve is opened that would result in the plug
remaining seated, a mechanical backup for the
brazed joint has been included in the valve. No
cases of braze failure have occurred during tests,
but there have been some instances of braze
failure during final machining.

A second seal bellows has been added to the
valve stem to contain the fuel and fission products
in the event of failure of the first bellows, and
modifications to the internal passages of the valve
are to be made to minimize fuel holdup after a

dump. As a result of valve-seat tests, the previ-
ously described'? cermet KM will be used for the
plugs and K162B will be used for the seats.

A valve, designated 5C (ref 10), which had a
spherical molybdenum plug and conical copper
seat, completed a 1500-hr test at 1300°F with
fuel 30. Leadkage rates were erratic after each
opening and closing following a 500-hr closure
period, and became excessive, that is, greater than
10 cm3/hr, after the thirty-third operating cycle.
Leakage rates were not measured during the re-
mainder of the test. As a result of this and similar
experience in valve-seat-materials tests, the
molybdenum copper seat combination was abandoned

for ART use.

A valve, designated ORNL-1, was assembled
from reworked parts that included the spiderlike
plug guide described above. Both the seat and
the plug were the cermet K151A (ref 10); the final
choice of seat materials had not been made when
this valve was assembled. This valve was tested
for 1500 hr through 50 operating cycles with fuel 30
at 1300°F. The leakage rate was immeasurable,
as determined by the fluid level in the system,
except on two occasions after an opening and
closing cycle when the leakage rate was approxi-
mately 3 e¢m3/hr; however, opening the valve and
flushing fuel over the seat and plug reduced the
leakage rate to zero. It is believed that some
foreign material had lodged in the seating areas
and prevented proper sealing.

At the completion of 1500 hr at 1300°F, the
temperature was raised to 1500°F, and through five
operating cycles the opening force was less than
200 Ib. The valve has been closed for 340 hr of a
500-hr closure test, and there has been no leakage.
This test will be continued until completion of a
1500-hr test, including 50 operating cycles at
1500°F, or until valve failure. The high opening
forces and erratic leakage rates experienced with
all valves tested previously probably resulted from
stem-to-stem guide binding and galling because of
seat-plug misalignment rather than from self-welding
and distortion of seat materials. A second valve
is being reworked that will match more closely the
configuration and materials of the ART fuel dump
valve, and it should be ready for testing soon.

NaK Dump Yalve. — The NaK dump valve, shown
in Figs. 1.2.8 and 1.2.9, is similar to the fuel dump
valve, including the spiderlike guide arrangement
for plug guidance. Stellite 6 is used both as the
rubbing surface for the guide and for the valve-
seating materials because the operating temperature
will be lower than that of the fuel valve. No
mechanical backup for the plug braze will be
required, since Stellite is a hard-surface overlay
that is integral with the plug. The backup bellows
has also been omitted because of the lesser
hazard in the event of a leak.  The first prototype
valve has been tested with water, and the leakage
rate of 0.1 cm®/hr at 65 to 70 psi is satisfactory.
The valve is presently being tested to determine
its flow resistance in the open position and is to
be installed on the NaK valve test stand for further
testing.

‘“In-Line'’ Valve Operator Test. — The first NaK
valve ‘‘in-line’’ operator received was found to
have a total travel of 3/8 in. instead of the required
5/8 in.; the spring rate exceeded 3000 Ib/in., where-
as 2000 Ib/in. had been specified; and the yoke
counter bore was 0.020 in. too shallow. These
minor deviations were corrected in the second NaK
valve operator, which was received with the
prototype NaK dump valve. After a separate
performance test, the second operator will be
tested in conjunction with the prototype NaK dump
valve described above.

NaK Cold-Trap and Plug-Indicator-System Throt-
tling Valves. — Several small NaK throttling valves
are required for the cold-trap and plug-indicator
systems of the ETU and the ART. The specifi-
cations for these valves state that they must
operate at 1000°F, that they must withstand a
200-psig system pressure without failure in an
emergency, that they must provide full flow of
S gpm or greater with a pressure of 24 psi across
the valve, and that they must provide throttling
control accurate to t0.05 gpm in the range of 0.5
and 1.5 gpm with a pressure of 60 psi across the
valve.

It was decided to use a valve for this service
that was immediately available from a vendor. The
valve selected was designed for closure service
(Fig. 1.2.10) and did not have adequate throttling
characteristics; however, it met the pressure and
maximum flow requirements, and modifications
were made in the plug in order to obtain the desired
throttling characteristics. Also, the valve stem
and bonnet were modified for use with a remotely
controlled pneumatic operator. With these modifi-
cations the valve meets the requirements, with
certain limitations. The full-flow requirement and
the short permissible stroke, 0.155 in., of the
bellows place stringent requirements on the valve
actuator in the throttling range; however, flow tests
indicate control to be more than satisfactory. The
high system pressure and procurement time limi-
tations make the use of a different bellows or
valve impractical, at least for the ETU,

One of these valves was tested for leak tightness
in the unmodified condition. Leakage was measured
by water displacement. The test included 100
operating cycles and a one-week closure at a
temperature of 1200°F with helium ot a pressure
of 90 psi across the valve. No measurable leakage

was detected. The valve bellows was pressure
tested by subjecting each of two valves to a 200-
psi internal pressure at 1200°F for 24 and 40 hr,
respectively; neither bellows failed. One valve
was tested on a NaK test stand at 1000°F for
1500 hr. The test included 46 operating cycles.
Valve leakage with a 50-psi pressure differential
was 3 cm®/hr for a stem thrust of 140 Ib, and there
was no leakage for a stem thrust of 280 Ib.

Sodium Circuit Water Flow Tests
S. Kress!!

Water flow tests for determining the head losses
through various regions of the ART sodium circuit
are nearly complete. Three regions were examined
during the quarter: the entrance to the coolant
holes in the beryllium reflector-moderator, the
entrances and exits of the coolant holes in the
beryllium island, and a proposed bypass slot be-
tween the sodium heat exchanger shell and the
external pressure shell of the reactor.

A previous test of the losses at the entrances to
the reflector-moderator coolant holes indicated
that certain of these holes were starved for flow,
specifically those in the region of the shoulder of

12,

the pie-shaped depression in the beryllium.
this region the entering sodium impinges on the
circular boron can and spreads out over the top of
the reflector. Remodeling of the shoulder, as
shown in Fig. 1.2.11, has provided a more gradual
transition from the depression to the reflector top.
The plane of the remodeled shoulder makes an
18-deg angle with the 7-deg plane of the depression.
Tests of the modified model showed considerable
improvement in flow distribution. The flow through
the holes differed and was, in general, lower in
the region of the shoulder, but the flow variation
was small enough to permit final control by proper
sizing of equator joint orifices.

Tests of flow to the island cooling passages
were run in order to establish entrance and exit
losses for the annular coolant passage adiacent
to the core shell. To simulate this region, a test
piece was made (Fig. 1.2.12) which consisted of
a straight passage of the same cross section as
that of the curved annulus between the island and

the shell and which included 3/16-in.-dia holes at
angles of 6 and 10 deg to the passage, that is, at
approximately the angles of the coolant holes in
the ART island. The results of these tests are
plotted in Figs. 1.2.13 through 1.2.16 as entrance
and exit loss coefficients, K, vs the ratio of the
velocity in the holes to the velocity in the annular
passage, V ,/V .. The loss coefficient, K, is
defined by the equation
Kv?2
AH = —PT
2
where AH is the head loss (in ft) that results solely
from turbulence, V .. is the flow velocity (in fps)
through the section that carries the total flow, and
g is the proportionality constant relating force to
acceleration and mass. Corrections were made to
the measured values of K for friction losses and
velocity changes.

A test was also run in order to determine the
head loss vs flow characteristics of a proposed
bypass slot between 6™ odium-to-NaK heat ex-
changer shell and the external pressure shell of
the reactor. This slot, which would connect the
region between the pressure shell and the outer
pressure ring with the sodium-to-NaK heat exchanger
inlet region, would allow some sodium to bypass
the present slots between the pressure shell and
the upper-deck outer shell and would thus provide
a more direct entrance to the heat exchanger. A
previous test'? was made of such a slot, but stress
analyses dictated a change in dimensions. The
presently proposed slot is 2 in. wide and 0.5 in.
deep and has a slightly larger cross-sectional
area, 0.00694 ft2, than that of the previously
tested slot, which was 5 in. wide and 0.187 in.
deep and had a cross-sectional area of 0.00651 f2.

Outer Core Shell Thermal Stability Test
J. C. Amos R. L. Senn

The test, described previous|y,]3 in which a
quarter-scale model of the ART outer core shell
is being thermally cycled, was interrupted following
the forty-third cycle because of a leak in the
expansion bellows which joined the shell to the
bottom piece of the apparatus. While the bellows
was being replaced, the shell was examined, and
no dimensional changes were found. The proposed
300-cycle test will be resumed soon.

A prototype of the liquid-metal-vapor condenser
for the NaK pump purge gas, which consists of a
2-ft length of 2-in. pipe filled with Demister
packing, is being tested at twice the design gas
flow of 1000 liters per day of helium saturated
with NaK vapor at 1200°F. Approximately 750 hr
of trouble-free test operation has been accumulated.

The sodium-vapor condenser |V for the sodium
pump purge gas15 became plugged with sodium at
a ]/4-in. outlet fitting after 1420 hr at the design
flow of 1000 liters per day of helium saturated by
bubbling it through sodium at 1200°F. A second
test in which the femperotures along the condenser
were reduced in order to achieve more complete
removal of sodium vapor by the condenser has been
in operation for 650 hr without difficulty.

FUEL EXPANSION TANK LIQUID-LEVEL
INDICATOR

R. F. Hyland

A series of tests of the helium-bubbler type of
liquid-level indicator, described previously,! was
run in the fuel expansion tank of the aluminum
north-head mockup. These tests were made in
order to determine the effect of the extreme turbu-
lence in the expansion tank on the accuracy of the
level-measuring system. Inasmuch as an absolute
level calibration cannot be obtained under turbu-
lent conditions, the tests were designed for de-
termining level differentials under various condi-
tions.

The unshielded bubblers used revealed a re-
producible trend toward an increase in the indicated
level of about 0.75 in. of H,O when the pump
speed was increased from 500 to 2500 rpm and a
corresponding decrease in level when the speed
was decreased. The change in level with a change
in pump speed was attributed either to velocity
effects or to an actual level change as a result of
a ‘‘dishing” effect. Additional bubblers were
then installed where they would most likely give a
level profile, and preliminary tests indicate that a
corresponding decrease in the indicated level is
obtained at one point for an increase at another, in
confirmation of the postulated ‘‘dishing’’ effect.
It is extremely difficult to observe visually what is
taking place inside the expansion tank, and there-
fore it is planned to use high-speed photography to
confirm that level changes actually take place as
indicated.

Gas in the system is a constant problem because
it tends to get trapped and displace water. In
order to obtain reproducible results, all tests have
been performed with the system degassed (visu-
ally) as completely as possible. In runs where one
pump was stopped to purposely ingas the system,
a very rapid and continuous rise in both the indi-
cated and observed level was noted.

The level-measuring system responds very well
at all pump speeds to the addition and removal of
water from the expansion tank. Accurate metering

tests are planned to determine the accuracy of the
measuring system in detecting these changes.

A scheduled 3000-hr test at 1500°F in the
dynamic-level test rig, described previously,! was
terminated by bubbler plugging after approximately
2000 hr. As in previous tests, the plugs con-
sisted largely of ZrO,. As noted previously, the
four tubes plugged almost simultaneously, and it
therefore appears that slugs of O, or H,0 may get
into the helium purge gas despite all efforts to
eliminate them. Possible sources of the con-
tamination were leaky bellows in the fuel and gas
lines, which were discovered after the test rig was
shut down. This test rig is being repaired, and a
Freon leak check is to be made before a new test
is started.

A static-level test system for studying the cause
of bubbler plugging is being constructed. This
system was described previously.?

LIQUID-METAL-LEVEL TRANSDUCERS
R. E. Pidgeon, Je3 G. H. Burger

Results of metallurgical examination of the
liquid-metal-level transducers tested previously?
in NaK systems have indicated that the failures
were the result of defective welds. A modified
version of the transducer was therefore designed
for use in the ETU and ART NaK pumps. Test
units of the modified design have been constructed,
as shown in Fig. 1.3.1, and installed in the level
test rig shown in Fig. 1.3.2. Two units have also
been installed in pump test stands. Preliminary
results indicate that the operating characteristics
of these units are satisfactory for reactor service,

Tests to more completely determine the operating
characteristics of the units are continuing, with
particular emphasis on temperature effects and
wetting, which could be a problem during the
system filling operation. Acceptance testing and

calibration of the units for the ETU are to begin

ON-OFF LEVEL PROBES
R. E. Pidgeon, Jr. G. H. Burger

Fabrication and testing of resistance-type on-off
level probes of the type shown in Fig. 1.3.3 were
continued. Six units are now being tested in the
level test rig, and more units are being fabricated
for testing. Twenty-two units are now operating in
NaK pump test loops, and all but two units con-
tinue to give satisfactory service. These two

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

units failed because of an open circuit between
the center electrode and outer shell at the bottom
of the probe. The copper wire apparently oxidized
and came loose at the weld joint. [t is expected
that this trouble can be eliminated by coating or
plating the wire with a suitable high-conductivity
oxidation-resistant material, such as nickel, or by
aluminizing the wire.

On-off probes for the NaK pump bowls and dump
tanks are being designed. It is expected that the
first of these units will be available for testing in
August. Material for an all-Inconel probe has been
ordered, and several of these units will be con-
structed and tested.

Investigations and tests are continuing in an
effort to find suitable commercial spark-plug probes
for nonradioactive liquid-metal systems. Several
special plugs made by the Champion Spark Plug
Co. are to be tested soon, along with a BeO plug

fabricated at ORNL.

MAGNETIC FLOWMETERS
G. H. Burger C. L. Pearce, Jr.3

The 2- and 3]/2-in. magnetic flowmeters for the
ETU aond the ART main, auxiliary, and special
NaK circuits are being tested and calibrated in
NaK pump test loops. As stated previously, the
objectives of these tests are to calibrate the
magnetic flowmeters against a water-calibrated
venturi flow standard of 0.25% accuracy, to check
theoretical calculations of flow output and ac-
curacy, to investigate the effects of temperature
and handling, to determine long-term reliability,
and to provide general operating data for use in
the ETU and the ART. The pump test loop
(PKP-2) in which six 31/2-in. magnetic flowmeters
were installed (Fig. 1.3.4) was put into operation
on February 12, 1957, and the pump test loop
(PKA-2) in which six 2-in. magnetic flowmeters
were installed (Fig. 1.3.5) was put into operation
on May 23, 1957.

Two of the six 3]/2-in. units have operated ap-
proximately 1000 hr, and four were removed after
770 hr of operation. The six 2-in. units have op-
erated more than 300 hr. The test conditions in-
clude varying ambient temperatures, fluid tem-
peratures, magnet temperatures, and flow rates.
These variables are monitored continuously by
Brown strip-chart recorders and are recorded on
data sheets at 2-hr intervals. Additional data are
taken on controlled runs to observe the effect of

each of the variables on flow output as measured
by the units. In addition to these measurements
the air-gap flux density of each magnet is meas-
ured at frequent intervals to determine the effects
of temperature, aging, vibration, and flow on the
magnetic circuit and to determine the effect of
air-gap flux density on flow sensitivity. The air-
gap flux density measurements are taken during
operation at magnet temperatures over the range
from 77 to 600°F. These values will be used to
relate magnet temperature to air-gap flux density
so that flux measurements will not be necessary
during reactor operation.

Three types of calibration runs are made on the
flowmeters — constant temperature tests, constant
flow tests, and magnetic air-gap flux density tests.
For the constant temperature runs the fluid tem-
perature is held constant and the flow rate is
varied in 100-gpm steps from 600 to 1600 gpm.
The constant temperature is changed in 200-deg
steps from 400 up to 1400°F, and a final test is
made at 1500°F. For the constant flow runs the
flow is held constant and the fluid temperature is
varied from 400 to 1500°F in 100°F steps. The
constant flow is changed in 100-gpm steps from
600 to 1600 gpm. For the magnet air-gap flux
density measurements, the fluid temperature and
flow are held constant and each magnet is en-
closed with the pipe, by wrapping it with insulat-
ing blankets, so that the magnet is heated by the
pipe. When the magnet temperature reaches 600°F,
the blankets are removed and the air-gap flux
densities are measured while the magnets are
cooling to the ambient temperature of the loop en-
closure.

Four of the 3]/2-in. magnetic flowmeters which
were calibrated against the venturi on test stand
PKP-2 were removed from the loop after 770 hr of
operation and are now being prepared for welding
into the ETU or the ART when required. The re-
maining two 3]/2-in. magnetic flowmeters were
left in the loop for further tests and to provide
reference data. Four uncalibrated flowmeters have
been installed in the loop to replace the four
removed, and they are now being calibrated.

Two 2-in. units and two 3]/2-in. units have been
welded into the ETU system. Data from the cali-
bration and test runs will be used to calculate
the flow sensitivities of these units. The correla-
tion of the experimental data is not yet complete,
but a preliminary survey indicates that the units
may be expected to give satisfactory service if the

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

magnet flux density is accurately known during
operation.  Additional information is to be ob-
tained in the continuing test with regard to wetting
effects and flux stability. The flux densities of
six magnets have dropped from 0.6 to 3.6% over a
period of 7 months. The magnets have been
handled extensively in installation and removal
from the loop, however, and it is felt that most of
the flux-density drop is due to handling. The drop
during operation ranged from 0.3 to as high as
1.5%. No correlation has been found between any
of the controlled factors and this drop. Further
monitoring of the two flowmeters left in the loop,
as well as the completion of the correlation of the
available data, should give additional information
as to flux stability.

Each flowmeter incorporates three separate
signal leads for spare leads and auxiliary outputs,
as shown previously.5 It was found that in all
cases the outputs from the three leads from both
the 2- and the 3]/2-in. units were the same, as
closely as they could be read from the Brown
recorders. |t was also found that three separate
recorders could be connected to the three leads
without interaction. In fact, satisfactory opera-
tion is obtained by connecting two recorders to
the same flow lead because of the low impedance
of the circuit.

The speed of response of the magnetic flowmeter
is limited by the speed of response of the Brown
recorder used. The flowmeter appears to follow
faithfully minute variations of flow and responds
well to abrupt changes in flow. As has been
anticipated, noise pickup proved to be no problem,
since the impedance of the flow element is very
low. The linearity of the units appears to be very
good; preliminary observations indicate that it
may be better than 1%.

An experimental sensitivity has been fitted to
the data for two 3]/2-in. units, and by using this
sensitivity it was found that the flow readings ob-
tained with the magnetic flowmeter agreed with
those of the venturi to better than 1%. The ex-
perimentally derived sensitivity was greater than
that calculated by G.E. by 6.5% at a fluid tempera-
ture of 700°F and 8% at a fluid temperature of
1500°F for one unit, and for the other unit it was

4.1% higher at 700°F and 5.6% higher at 1500°F.

The experimentally derived sensitivity decreased
linearly with temperature with the same slope in
both cases. The reproducibility of the measure-
ments on these two units was better than 1%.

The 3/B-in. magnetic flowmeters designed at
ORNL (Figs. 1.3.6 and 1.3.7) for plugging-indi-
cator and cold-trap systems will not, as stated
previously, be calibrated because of the relaxed
accuracy requirements. However, the units will be
handled and installed in the same manner as the
main and auxiliary system flowmeters. The flux-
density variation of these magnets with tempera-
ture has been found in tests of a number of units
to be approximately the same as for the 2- and
3]/2-in. units. Further temperature tests will be
run on these units to determine magnet and flow-
pipe air-gap temperatures at various simulated
fluid operating temperatures. Four of the flow-
meters have been completed for installation in the

TURBINE FLOWMETERS FOR USE AT
HIGH TEMPERATURES
G. H. Burger

Two redesigned 1-in. turbine flowmeters have
been fabricated that incorporate larger bearings

 

and closer bearing clearances than those used
previously. These units are being calibrated with
water prior to being installed in a gas-fired NaK
pump test loop. |f these redesigned units prove to
be satisfactory, it is planned to redesign the
3]/2-in. flowmeter which failed, as described pre-
viously,® in a NaK pump test loop. It is believed
that a satisfactory unit can be obtained by using
closer bearing clearances, a larger bearing di-
ameter, and a turbine with heavier blades and a
larger blade root radius.

Since that time, five sheathed assemblies have
shown sharp deviations, with two finally exceed-
ing the vendor's lower tolerance limit of plus or
minus %% (~11°F at 1500°F). Thirteen similar
specimens and three platinum, platinum=10% rho-
dium units have completed 2000 hr of exposure at
1500°F in NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %, fuel
30). After 1400 hr of operation, three Chromel-
Alumel specimens started showing sharp devia-
tions, with one finally exceeding the vendor's
lower tolerance limit. No positive cause has been
found for these sharp deviations, but they may
have resulted from leaks in the sheaths or the
closure welds. A summary of the results obtained
in the tests is given in Tables 1.3.1 and 1.3.2,
except that the measurements that deviated sharply
from the normal data are excluded.

Equipment has been procured and assembled for
obtaining integrity and drift data on well-type
thermocouples (beaded couples welded to the well
tip) in a static NaK system at 1500°F. Both
Chromel-Alumel and platinum, platinume-rhodium
thermocouples will be investigated.

The study of drift of similar sheathed thermo-
couples and the conventional beaded thermo-
couples in air as a function of time and tempera-
ture has continued. An additional 2000 hr of

Bending tests on Inconel-sheathed Chromel-
Alumel material were run in a recently completed
traveling-gradient furnace. The gradient pattern
developed in the furnace is symmetrical about a
peak temperature of 1830°F, with a slope of about
840°F per inch. Comparative results with unbent
material indicate that bending produces negligible
effects on the thermocouple wires, as shown in
Figs. 1.3.8 and 1.3.9. Annealing of the sheath
material tended very positively to reduce the
response to gradients, as shown in Fig. 1.3.10.
The sheath material had been annealed for 24 hr at
1350°F in helium by the vendor. Subsequent
tests will be made on material annealed for 200 hr
at 1350°F in helium by the vendor.

The effects of brazing Inconel sleeves to the
Inconel sheath of Chromel-Alumel thermocouple
material were also examined with the traveling-
gradient furnace. The results indicate that,
thermoelectrically, the brazing operation produced
practically no effect on the wires that could be
distinguished from the normal background. The
normal background was determined by subjecting
several unbrazed samples to the same gradients.

CONTROL ROD DRIVE SYSTEM TESTS

A test of the ART control rod drive mechanism
was initiated to determine the over-all reliability
of the system, the suitability of the porous ceramic
poison rod material in the stagnant-sodium-filled
thimble, and the effectiveness of the sodium-
surface cooling jacket in preventing sodium dep-

osition in the drive mechanism. The test period

is to be 3000 hr and the expected temperature
conditions of the ART are to be simulated. At the
end of the test period the system will be dis-
assembled and examined.

The rod-drive gear box and motors are shown in
Fig. 1.3.11. This drive mechanism is enclosed in
the pressure tank at the center right of Fig. 1.3.12.

heated thimble, as well as the water jacket for

instruments, are

floor level. The entire system is sealed under a
low helium pressure.B

A room-temperature mechanical shakedown test
was run for 351 hr, during which time the mecha-
nism completed 212 uneventful cycles. On May 14,
the thimble was filled with sodium, and the thimble
temperature was brought up to approximately
1100°F. The water system for sodium surface
cooling was adjusted to supply 0.8 gpm at 230°F
to the heat exchanger.

High-temperature automatic rod cycling is now
under way, and on June 13 the mechanism had op-
erated 700 hr through 630 rod stroke cycles. The
cycling schedule includes full rod insertion in
31.5 sec, rod dwell at bottom for 16.75 min, full
rod withdrawal in 6.25 min, and rod dwell at top
for 16.75 min.

A variation in the temperature near the top of
the thimble has been observed. When the rod is
held stationary at the top of the thimble, the upper
thimble temperature undergoes random excursions
of approximately 70°F. When the rod is held at
the fully inserted position, the random excursions
are approximately 30°F. These variations are
attributed to thermal-convection currents in the
sodium. The upper 3-in. section of the sodium,
which is surrounded by the cooling-water jacket,
has a temperature of approximately 230°F and the
lower 40-in. section of the thimble is at approxi-
mately 1100°F; therefore slow convection currents
exist because of the difference in densities.
Additional temperature variations occur near the
top of the thimble each time the rod is inserted or
withdrawn. The temperature ranges from 960°F
with the rod inserted to 1080°F with the rod

1.4. ENGINEERING DESIGN STUDIES
A. P. Fraas

APPLIED MECHANICS AND STRESS ANALYSIS
R. V. Meghreblian

Basic Problems in Elasticity
F. J. Stanek

Many of the structural configurations encountered
in the ART are not the basic shapes usually treated
in the theory of plates and shells. Some examples
of the unusual configurations are the two core
shells! (shells | and 1), shell VI, and the various
tube-to-shell connections associated with shell VII.
In order to provide adequate designs for these
members, it has been necessary to undertake a
program of basic studies to determine the elastic
properties of various special shapes. The stress
analysis of the tube-to-shell connection, which was
the initial study,! has been extended to a more
general treatment of tube connections. In addition,
two new studies have been initiated for determining
the elastic behavior of conical shells and circular
flat plates with variable thickness. These analyses
are of special interest because many of the complex
shell shapes in the reactor (such as shell VI) can
be represented as composite structures derived
from these more elementary configurations. The
analytical work for all three problems has been
completed, and numerical results are now being
obtained.

The analysis of the spherical shell problem
encountered in the design of the tube connections?
has been generalized to a wide range of thickness-
to-radius (a/h) values for the shell. The special
functions obtained in the solution of the shell
equations for arbitrary axisymmetrical edge loading
and uniform internal pressure are being tabulated.

The conical shell problem involved the solution
of an infinite series, as was the case for the
spherical shell problem. The special functions
used in describing the deformations and stresses

the dimensionless variable

t 1/2
x = 2(10.92)1/4 <°°b a> J72

 

where 2a is the vertex angle of the cone, / is the
shell thickness, and y is a coordinate measured
from the vertex along the surface of the shell. The
solutions of the infinite series expressions of
these special functions are being tabulated for
values of 0 < x < 150, and the results will provide
solutions for a wide range of conical shells, ex-
cluding only those which have small values of a
and 5 and large values of y.

The analysis of the circular plate of variable
thickness has been completed only for the case
of a linear thickness-to-radius relationship. Em-
phasis is being placed on configurations in which
the greatest thickness is toward the center of the
plate. During the preliminary study of this general
problem it was discovered that by taking Poisson’s
ratio equal to 1/3, the solution of the bending
analysis could be expressed as a function with a
finite number of terms. This simplification has
been introduced as a computational convenience.
The membrane analysis of the plate, on the other
hand, is given as an infinite series. A generalized
set of computations is being made which will
permit solutions to a wide variety of tapered
circular plates.

This analytical work is being coordinated with a
program of experimental stress analyses at the
University of Tennessee. The next step in the
experimental program is the study of a truncated
conical shell with a tapered circular plate base.
The results of this study should demonstrate the
validity of the cone-and-plate analyses mentioned

above.
Stress Analysis of Shell VI
S. E. Moore D. M. Miller
An analytical investigation of shell VI, the
pressure shell liner, is being made to determine

the integrity of this structure under both thermal
and pressure loads. The thermal loads will result

63
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

from the nonuniform temperature distribution over
the shell and from the constraints imposed on it
by the adjacent structures. The pressure loading
will arise from differences between the pressure
in the sodium circuit on the outside and the pres-
sure in the fuel circuit on the inside. These
studies will include the determination of complete
displacement profiles and stress distributions.

The studies for the two types of loading will be
made separately. In the thermal stress study,
which is presently under way, the shell is first
being examined under the assumption that there
are no external constraints on the system and,
therefore, that all stresses which appear will be
due to the nonuniform temperature profiles. The
results of this study will be combined with a set
of suitable edge loads to simulate the constraints
of the surrounding structure. In this way the
thermal stress distribution and growth of the shell
will be determined. ‘

The pressure load conditions to be imposed on
this shell will include the reactor design point
operating condition, the conditions which will
exist with only one fuel pump operating, and the
prefill condition when the reactor contains neither
fused salt nor sodium.3

The analytical model selected for the study
treats shell VI as a composite structure consisting
of cylinders, cones, spherical elements, flat plates,
and flanges, as shown in Fig. 1.4.1. (The term
flange denotes a shell of revolution with a constant
radius of curvature for which the axis of revolution
does not pass through the center of curvature, for
example, a torus.) The study was carried out by
solving each element in general and then treating
the total structure as a system of elements with
the requirement that all loads and deformations at
junctions between elements be compatible. This
approach lead to a set of approximately 150 simul-
taneous algebraic equations in the various defor-
mations and loads.

The analytical solutions for the cylindrical and
spherical segments are well known and were applied
in the usual way.?”®> The solutions for the conical

Experimental Analysis of Pressure Shell Dome
B. L. Greenstreet R. L. Maxwell”

The ART is to be supported by attaching the
four pump barrels to the reactor support plc:'rform.8
The suspension of the ART in this manner will
produce relatively large stresses in the pressure
shell in the regions where the pump barrels are
welded into the shell. These stresses will arise
from axial (weight) loads on the barrels and from
side loads resulting from expansion of the NaK

the pressure shell and the platform.

An experimental stress analysis has therefore
been performed on the support region (north head)
of the pressure shell to provide a detailed check
of the calculated stress distributions. This test
was made at the University of Tennessee’ on a
full-size aluminum mockup of the shell, which is
shown in Figs. 1.4.2 and 1.4.3, with the strain
gages in place. The mockup duplicates the sodium
pump barrels, the sodium expansion tank, and the

a skt of truncated fuel pump barrels.

The shell was loaded in several ways to provide
the information required for examining all loading
conditions anticipated during operation of the ART,
including axial loading on both the sodium pump
barrels and the fuel pump barrels. Axial loads
were also applied singly to each of these barrels.
The side loads (in opposed pairs) were applied
normal to the axes of the barrels (see Fig. 1.4.4).
This condition was used for each pair of pump
barrels and for a combination of one fuel and one
sodium pump barrel.

In the case of the ART, the side loads will act
near the upper flanges of the barrels and will
produce a combined moment and shear at the base
of the barrel. The effects of pure moments and
shears transmitted from the barrels to the shell
were also studied.

The method of attaching the fuel pump stubs to
the shell of the mockup does not duplicate the
ART design; however, this deviation affects only
the stresses in the immediate vicinity of the
junction. It is planned to make an exact model of
this region and to measure the stresses for the
loadings corresponding to those described above.
A correlation of the data will permit an accurate
evaluation of the ART design.

Reflector Temperature Distribution

D. L. Platus D. M. Miller

Calculations are under way in order to determine
the steady-state temperature distribution throughout
the beryllium reflector during full power operation.

 

9Under the direction of R. L. Maxwell.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

These results will be used to determine the proper
flow distribution of the sodium coolant and to
calculate thermal stresses in the beryllium.

A sketch of the reflector-moderator cooling circuit
is shown in Fig. 1.4.5. Cold sodium enters at the
top of the reflector and passes down through the
cooling holes and the inner annulus. This sodium
removes the gamma-ray and neutron heat deposited
in the beryllium and also serves to cool the outer

reflector.

Detailed gamma-ray and neutron heating calcu-
lations'® were completed for the ART that give
the total heat deposition rates throughout the
reflector beryllium at full power. Because of the
complicated geometry and the nonuniform heat
distribution, a numerical method is being used to
solve the heat conduction problem. The symmetry
of the configuration and other simplifying features
made it possible to reduce the three-dimensional
problem to a series of two-dimensional problems.
For example, since the cooling-hole pattern is
axially symmetric, it was necessary to solve for
the temperature distribution in only one typical
‘‘orange slice’' segment of the reflector. The
typical slice was obtained from the periodicity
of the azimuthal configuration; the hole pattern
repeats every 5 deg. A sketch of the orange slice
and a typical cross section are shown in Fig.
1.4.6. Because of the symmetry the vertical faces
could be considered to be insulated.

A further simplification could be made because
the heat load from the beryllium was less than that
from the shells. Since most of the heat will come
from the shells, the sodium temperature distributions
for both the inner and outer annuli were determined
independently (to a first approximation), as re-
ported previously” and in the section on ‘‘ART
Core Heat Transfer Analysis,”’ Chap. 1.7 of this
report.

the inner and outer edges and for the two radial

problem was to determine the temperature structure
within the beryllium and throughout the sodium in
the coolant holes. The temperature rise of the
sodium as it passes through the cooling holes will
be dependent upon the heat flux at the surface of
each hole, but this will be dependent upon the
temperature distribution in the beryllium, which,
in turn, will be dependent upon the sodium temper-
ature. The problem was simplified by considering
the relative magnitudes of the temperature gradients
in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the
cooling holes. Since the heat flow will be primarily
in the direction perpendicular to the holes, it was
possible to analyze the orange slice by taking
further slices perpendicular to the holes. By
assuming that the horizontal faces of each of these
slabs were insulated, the problem was reduced to
a set of two-dimensional temperature distribution
calculations for a given set of cooling-hole sodium
temperatures. From this temperature distribution

and the flow rate in each hole, the heat loads to

The orange slice was divided into 23 slabs as
shown in Fig. 1.4.6. The calculation began with
section A, and it was assumed that the inlet sodium
temperature was uniform. From the two-dimensional
temperature distribution obtained for this slab and
the sodium flow rates for each hole, the heat loads
to the holes and the resulting sodium temperature
rises could be determined. These results then
served as initial conditions for slab B, and so on.

The two-dimensional temperature distributions
are being solved numerically by the method of
finite differences (a relaxation calculation). With
the aid of a polar transformation to convert the
cross section of Fig. 1.4.6 into a rectangle, a
square grid was used to set up the finite difference
relations for the heat-conduction equation. These
equations are being solved on an IBM-650 unit by
using the Gauss-Seidel technique.

High-Frequency Temperature-Oscillation Studies

The first phase of a high-frequency temperature-
oscillation analysis was carried out for a thin
plate geometry designed to simulate the core shell
configuration in which the shell thickness is small
compared with the radius of curvature. The results

studies of this nature which take into account
the effects of cylindrical geometry. The pipes
tested had wall thicknesses that were an appreci-
able fraction of the radius, and it became apparent
that it would be necessary to establish the influence
of surface curvature on the thermal response of
the metal. A series of calculations was undertaken
therefore to determine the ratio of the amplitude of
temperature oscillation at the surface of a circular
cavity (in an infinite medium) to the amplitude of
the temperature oscillation of the fluid in the
cavity. The results are shown in Fig. 1.4.7 where
the ratio of amplitudes, 7, is plotted as a function

of 0.2 ft2/hr that is subjected to a frequency of

SODIUM SYSTEM STUDIES

R. |. Gray

A recalculation of the heat load of the sodium
system of the ART has indicated an increase from
6.20 Mw to 7.02 Mw. The major reason for this
increase was the higher conduction-transfer rates
across the core shells that were determined by a
detailed study of an idealized core flow model.
The results of calculations made in the course of
that study are reported in the section on ‘‘ART
Core Heat Transfer Analysis,’”’ Chap. 1.7 of this
report. In order to maintain the sodium temperature
between the desired limits of 1050 and 1250°F, it
will be necessary to increase the flow rate of each
pump from 440 to 500 gpm. At this flow rate the
required pump head is approximately 160 ft. The
island cooling hole flow distribution was determined,
and the orifice sizes were specified.

COOLING SYSTEM FOR EQUATORIAL
LEAD SHIELD

J. Foster

Final calculations of the cooling system for the
equatorial lead shield of the ART were made. This
section of the shield will be fabricated in two
halves, each of which will contain eight horizontal
passages arranged for series flow of 5 gpm of
cooling water. Water flow through the two shield
halves will be parallel. Calculations of the cooling

were based upon the use of %-in. type-K copper

tubing with which the water prgssure drop through
the lead shield would be about 6 psi. The temper-
ature rise of the water for the stated flow was
calculated to be about 40°F. The gamma-ray heat
deposition rate will be 1 w/cm? of lead, and the
conducted heat load will be 0.56 w/cm?. The

maximum lead temperature was calculated to be
75°F above the temperature of the cooling water.

ART SHIELDING

H. W, Bertini C. M. Copenhaver
A. M. Perry

Designs for the shielding required for the various
components of the ART are being prepared. The
four major requirements that have governed the
shield design thus far are: (1) the dose rate at
points outside the reactor cell during operation
must be compatible with personnel occupancy
requirements at those points; (2) dose rates within
the cell, after reactor shutdown, must be low
enough to permit certain maintenance or repair
operations which might become necessary for
continuance of the test, as well as to permit re-
moval of the fuel and of the reactor following com-
pletion of the test; (3) total doses for all materials
must be kept below damaging levels; and (4) shield-
ing in the quadrant facing the gamma-ray spec-
trometer tubes should be kept as clean as possible
to avoid ambiguity in the shielding experiments,

The second criterion is the one that has most
strongly influenced the shielding designs described
below. It has been found that, for most components
containing fuel, the radiations from La'4? control
the shielding thickness. Since the decay of these
radiations is, in general, governed by the 12.8-day
half life of Ba'4?, the required shielding thick-
nesses vary slowly with time after reactor shut-
down. For several days after shutdown, however,
the gamma rays from activated sodium (15-hr half
life) may produce dose rates greater than those
from irradiated fuel. The specific period after
shutdown is about two days for the reactor and about
nine days for the fuel drain line, which will be
cooled by sodium flow in an annulus around it,
Shields for components in the region around the
lower end of the reactor and for the fuel fill-and-
drain tank have therefore been designed for periods
of more than nine days after shutdown.

NaK Pipe Stubs

The twelve NaK pipes that pass through the
reactor pressure shell will be welded to concentric
sleeves which in turn will be welded to the pres-
sure shell. The purpose of this configuration is to
minimize the stress in the piping that will result

from the NaK in the pipes being at 1500°F while
the pressure shell is maintained at about 1200°F,
A consequence of this design will be the exist-
ence of an annular pocket of fuel which can-
not be drained and which will extend partly through
the opening in the lead shield through which the
pipe passes. For the design which existed at the
time this study began, the volume of fuel in each
of the twelve pockets was about 170 cm3, and the
fuel pockets extended, on the average, 5]/2 in, be-
low the pressure shell. Gamma radiation from
irradiated fuel in such pockets would give rise to a
dose rate, several days after shutdown, of several
hundred r/hr at the surface of the reactor shield
near the lower end of the reactor, Since it had
been established as a design criterion that the
dose rate in regions where any maintenance opera-
tions might, be required should be less than 1 r/hr
nine days after shutdown, it was evident that
shielding of the fuel pockets would be required. In
an effort to reduce the trapped fuel volume to a
minimum, the length of the sleeve projection below
the pressure shell is to be shortened from 5]/2 to
21/2 in., the minimum allowable by stress consider-
ations, and most of the fuel is to be displaced from
the remaining volume by a thin-walled, helium-
filled can which will satisfy requirements for low
thermal conductivity within the annulus.

Several designs for shielding the remaining
pockets have been investigated. One proposed
design would provide a cylindrical lead skirt con-
centric with the reactor axis and surrounding the
twelve NaK pipes as far down as the NaK mani-
folds, which lie in a plane about 11 in, below the
bottom of the reactor pressure shell. The solid
angle below the NaK pipes would be covered by an
annular ring of lead lying just below the manifolds.
The weight of this shielding was estimated to be
about 7000 Ib, An alternative solution (and the one
adopted) is to place a sleeve of tungsten-copper-
nickel alloy (density, ~17 g/cm3) directly on the
NaK pipe and to place small patch shields of the
same material below the® manifolds to cover the
solid angle exposed where the pipe enters the
manifold, |t was found that a sleeve ]]/2 in, thick
surrounding the pipe would reduce the dose rate at
the surface of the water bag to less than 0.2 r/hr,

71
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

including the contributions from all NaK pipes.
The total weight of this additional shielding is
about 3800 Ib.

The shield configuration was derived by con-
sidering
rays, with buildup factors appropriate to water,

line-of-sight attenuation of the gamma

since the gamma rays pass through a minimum of
12 in. of water to reach the surface of the shield.
The dose from gamma rays which scatter once from
the inner surface of the sleeve and then pass out
through the NaK manifold was found to be negli-
gible. The possibility of once-scattered gamma
rays finding a shorter path through the heavy alloy
than the line-of-sight path to the point of observa-
tion on the shield surface was examined by con-
sidering sources of once-scattered gamma rays at
various points in the sleeve. Although it is known !
that such scattered gamma rays can make a large
contribution to the dose rate for oblique penetration
of a slab shield, the detailed geometry of the
tungsten-base alloy sleeves is such that these
gamma rays do not seriously enhance the dose rate
calculated by line-of-sight trajectories.

Fuel Drain Line

Fuel will be drained from the reactor through
two parallel ]l/z-in. pipes 15 in. apart, A few
inches below the reactor these pipes will pass
through separate valves and then join in a tee
connection to a single vertical line which will
carry the fuel to the fill-and-drain tank. Shielding
of these lines and the valves is required because
(1) irradiated fuel standing in the drain lines could
give rise to substantial dose rates outside the

reactor cell, (2) small amounts of irradiated fuel -

that might adhere to the pipe walls and to valve
parts following a fuel dump could give rise to dose
rates which would prevent the performance of
maintenance work around the reactor, and (3) acti-
vated sodium in the heating and cooling jacket
surrounding the drain lines could similarly inhibit
maintenance for several days after shutdown of
the reactor.

Dose rates at representative points near the
drain lines as a function of lead thickness were
obtained by numerical integration over the sources.
Buildup factors for lead were used. The amount of
fuel that may adhere to the pipe walls and valve

Shielding Design Manual, TID-7004, p 118 (March 1956).

72

surfaces was conservatively estimated, on the
basis of experience accumulated in the handling of
fluoride fuels, to be about 0.001 cm3/cm? of
surface. It was found that about 5 in, of lead
shielding will be required around the drain lines
and valves to keep the dose rate just outside the
shield to below 0.2 r/hr, at nine days after shut-
down. This shielding will add about 6000 Ib to
the weight of the ART installation.

Fuel Overflow Line

A sodium-jacketed 1-in, pipe will be provided to
carry any overflow from the fuel expansion tank
back to the fuel fill-and-drain tank. This line will
pass along the outside of the pressure shell but
underneath the lead shield along the meridian at
which the two halves of the lead shield join. The
line constitutes an additional source of gamma
radiation because of the fuel it may contain and
because of the sodium in the jacket around it, and
a substantial local reduction in the thickness of
the lead shield is required to accommodate the
line. These factors combine to enhance the gamma-
ray dose rate during reactor operation by a factor
of at least 4, averaged over a quadrant of the
reactor facing the control room. It seems to be
advantageous to deal with this extra dose by
placing, shielding as close as possible to the
source. Consequently, a crescent-shaped piece
of lead 3 in. thick at the center and 16 in. wide
will be placed within the water shield and against
its inner shell. The weight of this additional
shielding is about 500 Ib.

Yapor Traps on Fuel Fill-and-Drain Tank

Two vapor traps are required for the control of
condensable vapors in the off-gas system of the
ART. One of these, which is connected to the
reactor off-gas line, is designed to condense the
ZrF, vapor evolved from the fuel during reactor
operation. The other will be connected to the gas
bleed line from the fill-and-drain tank to handle
condensable vapors carried out of the tank during
a fuel drain operation,

The requirement for shielding on the tank vapor
trap will arise mostly from La'4?, which is a decay
product of the Xe'4? that will be released from
the fuel during the draining operation. The Xe 140
may decay in the trap and its daughter products
may be deposited on the nearest surfaces. Decay
products formed in the tank might also be displaced
y‘ww’ ’

out of the tank along with the helium atmosphere
and then deposit in the trap. |t has been assumed
that both these processes will occur. Also, it was
considered that radicactive ZrF, will condense in
the trap and fuel droplets might be entrained in
the outgoing gas and be deposited in the trap.
These latter sources were found to be negligible.

On the assumption of 16 equally spaced dumps,
each immediately following a shutdown from full
power, the shielding required for a dose rate of
200 mr/hr at a distance of 1 ft from the center line
of the vapor trap was found to be 2 in. of lead. The
line joining the tank and the trap would not require
shielding, but it will actually be shielded in the
process of blocking off penetrations in the fill-
and-drain tank shield.

SHIELDING OF AN AIRCRAFT INSTALLATION

The substantial additional shield weights dis-
cussed in the preceding paragraphs would be

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

objectionable in an aircraft power plant, It should
be recognized, however, that much of this addi-
tional shielding is related to particular require-
ments and design features of the Aircraft Reactor
Test and would not necessarily be required in an
airplane. It is probable, for example, that a single
drain line would be provided, rather than two, and
the shielding weight required would be substan-
tially smaller than for the ART. It is hoped that
an alternative configuration can be found for the
NaK pipe penetrations through the pressure shell
which will not result in trapped pockets of fuel.
The use of a lithium-base fluoride fuel rather than
a zirconium-base fluoride fuel should greatly re-
duce the problem of dealing with condensable
vapors and consequently the shielding of the off-
gas system, The experience gained with the ART
shielding should be very helpful in arriving at
design modifications which will minimize the need
for heavy, patch shielding.

1.6. INSPECTION OF MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS
A. Taboada

MATERIALS INSPECTION
G. M. Tolson

Materials for the construction of the ETU, ART,
and test components were inspected, as before,
with the intended use as the criterion for accept-
ability,  The various types and quantities of
materials inspected during the quarter, the methods
of inspection, and the results of the inspections
are discussed below. All rejected material was
either down-graded for noncritical applications or
was used in experimental equipment in order to
minimize losses. All the materials that required
inspection by eddy-current or ultrasound techniques
were inspected by the nondestructive testing group
(see Chap. 3.7, “Nondestructive Testing,’’ this
report).

Inconel tubing in random sizes was inspected by
visual and dye-penetrant techniques and, when
necessary, by radiographic and ultrasonic methods.
The inspection of 550 ft of 0.187-in,-0OD, 0.025-in.-
wall Inconel tubing revealed numerous pickup-type
defects on the outside surface that exceeded 5%
of the wall thickness. Centerless grinding to a
depth of 0.0025 in, was tried in an effort to remove
detrimental handling defects from 100 ft of ‘}B-in.-
OD, 0.065-in.-wall Inconel tubing, but re-examina-
tion revealed that the condition still existed.
Consequently, the tubing will not be used for
critical applications.  Forty feet of 1-in.-OD,
0.065-in.-wall tubing was rejected because of
numerous gross defects., Isolated areas containing
defects were cut from some of the tubes as a result
of inspection. This lot of tubing contained 1951 ft,
of which 877.5 ft was rejected, for a rejection rate
of 45%.

The specification of a minimum usable length
of 10 ft resulted in the rejection of 220 ft (44%) of
a total of 454 ft of Inconel CX-900A tubing of
various sizes. Defects in excess of 5% of the wall
thickness were the cause for rejection. Visual,
dye-penetrant, radiographic, impedographic, and
ultrasonic inspection methods were used. The
rejected material will be returned to the manu-
facturer for credit.

Numerous small defects were found in a 250-ft
lot of ]/2-in.-0D, 0.035-in.-wall Hastelloy B tubing;

74

however, because of the scarcity of the material,
a waiver was made on all but the worst conditions
and the material was released for test purposes.
Visual, dye-penetrant, and radiographic inspection
methods were used.

Severe transverse and longitudinal cracks were
found in the seam welds of a 169-ft lot of type 430
stainless steel tubing of random sizes. Investi-
gation of the cracks in 89 ft of 3/4-in.-OD, 0.065-in,-
wall tubing revealed that most of the cracks ex-
tended completely through the wall, and therefore
the entire 89-ft lot was rejected. Usable material
was obtained from the remaining 80 ft by cutting
away the affected areas. The final amount re-
jected was 90.5 ft, ond the rejection rate was
53%. Visual and dye-penetrant inspection methods
were used,

Numerous small outer surface imperfections were
found by visual, dye-penetrant, and radiographic
inspection of a 53-ft lot of ]/2-in.-OD, 0.045-in,-wall
INOR-8 tubing. This tubing was 100% rejected
for critical use, but, since the intended use did not
involve severe operating conditions, the material
was released on a waiver,

Visual, dye-penetrant, radiographic, and, where
necessary, ultrasonic techniques were used for the
inspection of 816 ft of Inconel piping and 255]/2 ft
of Inconel CX-900A piping in random sizes. Where
possible, defective conditions found by the in-
spections were removed by grinding within the
tolerance of 5% of the wall thickness. The re-
maining defective sections with cracklike condi-
tions or defects in excess of the permissible
tolerances were rejected. A 131-ft lot of 2]/2-in.-
IPS, sched-40 Inconel pipe that was to be sub-
jected to extensive forming and handling was
rejected because of thin walls. The rejected ma-
terial was down-graded for noncritical use. The
153 ft of rejected Inconel piping gave a rejection
rate of 19%, and the 6 ft of rejected Inconel
CX-900A piping gave a rejection rate of 2.5%,

Of the 259 ft of %-in.-IPS, sched-40 Hastelloy B
piping and the 77 ft of Hastelloy W piping in-
spected, only 4.5 ft of Hastelloy B and 5 ft of
Hastelloy W were rejected, since only sections
with defects in excess of 5% of the wall thickness

A R,
or cracklike conditions were rejected, as a result
of the scarcity of the material. Visual, dye-
penetrant, and radiographic inspection methods
were used,

Various thicknesses of Inconel plate and sheet
were inspected, and those sections that contained
defects were ground in an attempt to clear up the
defects within the allowable reduction in thick-
ness. However, 200 ft? of 0.037-in.-thick sheet
was found to contain severe nicks, gouges, and
scratches which had apparently been caused from
improper handling. These areas were identified
and, by proper orientation, the fabricator can ob-
tain the required size and amount of acceptable
material. A total of 1169 ft? was inspected;
236.5 12 was rejected; and the rejection rate was
22%. Visual, dye-penetrant, and ultrasonic methods
were used for the inspection of 3/16' to l-in,-thick
material, and the reflectoscope was used for
material greater than 1 in, in thickness. Similar
results were obtained in the inspection of 471 ft2
of Inconel CX-900A in various thicknesses. A
total of 85 ft2 was rejected, and the rejection rate
was 18%.

Inconel rod of various diameters was inspected
by visual, dye-penetrant, and reflectoscope tech-
niques. None of the 19 ft inspected was rejected.
Various Inconel fittings, including ells and re-
ducers, were similarly inspected, and, similarly,
there were no rejections among the 65 fittings in-
spected.

One aluminum motor housing which had failed
during service, along with three other similar
housings, was submitted for examination. The
three new units were found to be free of defects in
the region where the first unit failed. No evidence
of material defects that could have caused the
failure of the first unit was found.

An 8-in.-OD, 5/8-in.-wa||, 20-in.-long cylinder
fabricated of inspected Inconel plate by rolling and
then seam welding was inspected in order to detect
any flaws which may have existed in the weld
and any which may have developed during forming.
It was found to be acceptable for the intended use.

Visual, dye-penetrant, radiographic, impedo-
graphic, and ultrasonic methods were used for the
inspection of a 3250-ft lot of 0.229-in,-0D, 0.025-
in.-wall CX-900A Inconel tubing for heat exchanger
fabrication, and 2034 ft was rejected. The re-
jection rate for this tubing increased from the
previous 17% to 63% because the inner surfaces

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

were of very poor quality., Typical gouge-type
defects are shown in Figs. 1.6.1 and 1.6.2. These
defects appeared in large numbers in some of the
rejected tubes and were 1 to 3 mils deep. Sixty-
five tubes (423 ft) from this lot were rejected be-
cause magnetic particles stuck to the inner surface
of the tube, ‘as shown in Fig. 1.6.3. The manu-
facturer's representatives believed that some
minor change had been made in their process which
had caused the poorer quality and indicated that
efforts would be made to improve the quality.

An attempt to remove the magnetic particles by
pickling with a 10% solution of phosphoric acid
for about 1 hr proved to be successful., Therefore
a sample of tubing was placed in phosphoric acid
for 168 hr to determine whether any harmful effects
would result. The sample did not reveal any indi-
cation of attack upon examination at a magnifica-
tion of 45X. Another sample of the tube is now
being examined metallographically as a final check
prior to acceptance of the pickling method for the
removal of magnetic particles.

The Superior Tube Co. over-pickled 2618 |b of
CX-900 Inconel tubing redraw material and at-
tempted to salvage the material by sandblasting
at an early stage in the manufacturing process.
Examinations of the finished material indicated,
however, that sandblasted material was unsatis-
factory, and therefore all the over-pickled redraw
material is being reamed to eliminate the sand-
blasting effects. Tubing will be fabricated from
the reamed material.

Tubing shipped to Black, Sivalls & Bryson for
the fabrication of the ART fuel-to-NaK heat ex-
changers was found by their visual inspectors to
have rejectionable indications. Therefore all the
affected tubing was returned to ORNL for re-
examination by visual inspection. In order to
eliminate a recurrence of this situation, a new
visual inspection operation has been established,
and inspectors have been permanently assigned to
this task. Inexperienced visual inspectors were
used for the original inspection, The re-examina-
tion revealed some defects up to 1 mil in depth,
and 689 of the 3789 ft of tubing was found to have
defects which were greater than 0.5 mil in depth..

Visual inspection of 754 ft of Inconel-clad
stainless steel tubing revealed numerous small
pits which were cause for rejection of the entire
lot for critical applications. Since this tubing was
not to be used in a highly critical application,

other inspection methods were used in order to
locate all gross defects. Dye-penetrant inspection
showed rejectable indications on 500 ft of this
S | tubing. No further rejectable areas were found
with radiographic inspection, and metallographic
examination revealed that a good bond was present.
Reinspection of the tubing used in the fabrica-
tion of a 20-tube fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger after
the tubes had been bent-formed showed numerous
nicks, gouges, and scratches resulting from im-
proper handling. These conditions resulted in the
rejection of the entire bundle.

shielded-arc method resulted in rejection of 19.4%
of the critical welds and 3% of the noncritical
welds.,

Several welds were fabricated in the NaK piping
manifold of the ETU, and an investigation of the
possibility of using argon as the purging gas for
these weldments was conducted in order to de-
termine whether the welds could thus be made
more expeditiously and whether a reduction in the
number of rejections could be attained. Records
were maintained on the volume and the flow rate
of argon required to remove the air and to drop the
dew point to an acceptable level prior to the weld-
ing operation. A portable Beckman oxygen analyzer
and a portable dew-point meter were used as indi-
cators. Although argon is more expensive than
helium, a much shorter purging time, less total
volume, less gas loss, and a lower rejection rate
were indicated. Consequently, all welds in the

system are now being fabricated with argon as the
purge gas.

A number of repair welds made on copper-lined
Inconel fluoride mixture receivers were inspected,
as well as 55 Hastelloy B welds fabricated on
corrosion test loops. Thirteen of the Hastelloy B
welds were rejected because of porosity and cracks,
and 21 of approximately 60 critical thermocouple
welds were rejected for lack of fusion.

Thirteen welds were fabricated on the equators
of core shells and pressure shells in order to ob-
tain weld shrinkage data and to develop acceptable
welding techniques. The results of inspections of
these welds indicated that they were acceptable
for obtaining the shrinkage data, but several de-
fects were noted that would have been cause for
rejection had they occurred on the ETU or ART.
Efforts are being made to determine the effects of
repairs on dimensional tolerances.

INSPECTION OF COMPONENTS MADE
BY VENDORS

A, E. Goldman

D. K. Davis

Results of inspections of components and
welder’s samples received from vendors are given
in Table 1.6.1, These inspections included re-
views of fabrication data, such as inspection
reports, brazing information, x-ray film welding
data, etc. Standards have been established for the
acceptance of tube-to-header welds on the basis
of radiography of accessible welds. Studies are
being made of a qualitative method of determining
defect size by a comparison of a test unit with a
standard.

The tube-bending method being used in the fabri-
cation of the ART fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers to
eliminate springback is being evaluated. The
tubes are clamped into position and resistance
heated.  Nondestructive inspection revealed no
detrimental® conditions on ten tubes bent in this
manner. Final approval of the method will be
based on the results of metallographic examina-
tion,

Brazing tests performed at the York Corp. (see
Chap. 3.3, ‘‘“Welding and Brazing Studies’’) estab-
lished the need for a higher brazing temperature.
Therefore, in order to assure complete brazing of
radiators, approval was given to increase the
brazing temperature to a minimum of 1905°F and a

maximum of 1950°F,

INSPECTION OF CORE SHELLS
G. M. Tolson

The results of inspections of spun outer core
shell pieces are summarized in Table 1.6.2. Two
separate inspection methods were used — metallo-
graphic and nondestructive. In the metallographic
examination, samples are either cut from unusable
(trim) areas of the shell or from unusable shells
and are examined for grain size and general sound-
ness of the material. In the nondestructive exami-
nation, the shells are examined for material in-
tegrity by radiographic, ultrasonic, dye-penetrant,
and visual techniques.

Lot 1, pieces 1 and 2 showed numerous dye
indications. When an attempt was made to remove
the defects by polishing, the minimum allowable

78

wall thickness was reached before the defects were
removed,

Two shells, lot 1, piece 5 and lot 4, piece 12,
were cut by Lycoming for metallographic examina-
tion, The grain size of both was found to be
borderline but acceptable. However, lot 1, piece 5
was found to be rejectable because of evidence of
overpickling.

Lot 1, piece 4 was rejected both by dye-penetrant
and visual inspection because of small micro-
fissures caused by overpickling during fabrication,
Lot 3, piece 1 was rejected because of numerous
dye indications of defects and visual discontinuities
which should have been removed at Lycoming in
accordance with the established inspection pro-
cedure. This shell has been reworked by Lycoming
and returned to ORNL, and it is now being re-
inspected.

Four inner core shells have been fabricated by
forming, welding, and machining plate as a backup
effort in the event that spinning methods are un-
successful. Inspection of these shells revealed
the plate material and surface to be acceptable.
Metallographic examination of the weld areas,
however, revealed large dendritic grains extending
throughout the entire thickness of the weld. In
addition, three shells were revealed by radiography
to have rejectable porosity.

Variables affecting grain size were studied, and
it was found that an improvement was attainable by
changing joint design and decreasing the weld rod
size. An attempt was made to remove porosity by
weld repair in one shell, but the resulting distortion
exceeded the allowable dimensional tolerances.
Because of the excessive amount of time required
to remake a shell, the one containing the least
amount of porosity will be assembled into the ETU,
Future shells will be inspected prior to final
machining in order to allow for repair work,

strument is presently being used to identify doubt-

sequently the parts were checked with the Metal-
ldentification Meter, It was found that the cooling
jacket was made of a 300 series stainless steel,

EMBRITTLEMENT OF INCONEL
BY PENETRANTS

G. M. Tolson

An experiment was conducted to determine
whether the solutions used in penetrant inspection
cause embrittlement of Inconel at high tempera-

1.7. HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES

ART CORE HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS
H. W. Hoffman L. D. Palmer

In order to establish the design limits for the
sodium cooling system of the ART, it was neces-
sary to estimate the heat load that will be im-
posed by heat transfer between the fuel and the
sodium coolant. The flow rates of the sodium
coolant in the annuli jacketing the reactor fuel
channel will, of course, depend on this heat trans-
fer. The heat transferred will be a function of the
axial position, the fuel-to-wall-to-coolant thermal
resistances, the difference between the mean tem-
perature of the cooled wall and the temperature of
the coolant, the heat transfer area, and the coolant
flow rates. In an analysis of this system, the
critical unknown is the mean temperature of the

cooled wall. Since the only experimental data
available! for a volume-heated system are for the
uncooled (adiabatic) wall case, it was necessary
to postulate the actual reactor mean cooled wall
conditions. Obviously the worth of any such cal-
culations is a function of how accurately the
assumed conditions represent the true ART con-
ditions.

Two analyses of the heat transfer through the
ART core shells were made previously, and the
assumptions involved in the previous work (analy-
ses A and B) and in the current calculations

(analysis C) are compared in Table 1.7.1. [t may

be seen that the primary difference between analy-
sis C and analyses A and B lies in the extent to
which the actual system was simplified. In
analysis C the coolant exit temperatures were
obtained from a series of heat balances for dif-
ferential volumes (both radially and axially) in
the fuel, wall, and coolant components throughout
the high-temperature critical region of the reactor.
The fuel flow path was segmented axially, and the
heat flux for each segment was assumed to be that
which existed at the entrance to the segment. The
heat flux in the inlet segment was determined from
the design sodium and fuel entrance temperatures.
The calculated temperature difference at the end
of this section was then used to calculate the
heat flux for the second section. The results are
shown in Fig. 1.7.1 for both the island and the
inner reflector coolant annuli. It was of interest
to find that, despite the additional refinements,

this calculation yielded a fuel temperature dis-
tribution not too dissimilar from that previously
found from analysis B. However, there did result
a higher heat load on the sodium coolant because
of the inclusion of the axial heat generation dis-
tribution in this calculation. Since the high heat
generation occurs in the region of largest heat
transfer area, the heat load to the sodium coolant
is increased without substantially changing the
fuel temperature distribution.

THERMAL-CYCLING RESEARCH
Pressurized System
H. W. Hoffman D. P. Gregory?

The experimental investigation of the effect of
thermal-stress cycling on Inconel tubes filled with
flowing NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) was con-
tinued with data being obtained at temperatures
near 1600°F and at frequencies of 0.4 and 0.01
cps. The results obtained during the quarter are
summarized in Table 1.7.2.

It was learned during this period that tubes with
different grain sizes had been used in these ex-
perimental studies. The ASTM grain size number
of the tubing used for each of the runs is given in
Table 1.7.3. The grain size did not appear to
have an effect on the depth of penetration, but
there was an indication that in the fine-grained
(ASTM 4) tubes there was a tendency toward
intergranular attack. This was particularly notice-
able in the heater section of the test units. Speci-
mens of coarse- and fine-grained Inconel tubing
from two typical runs are shown in Figs. 1.7.2,
1.7.3, and 1.7.4. |t may be seen that several of
the large grains in the specimen from the test
section of run ET-H extend more than halfway
through the wall (Fig. 1.7.2) and that there was
attack both along the grain boundaries and within
the grains. In contrast, the attack on the fine-
grained specimens from the tubing used for run
ET-Q was confined almost completely to the grain
boundaries (Figs. 1.7.3 and 1.7.4). Comparisons
of the grains in as-received and as-tested speci-
mens showed no tendencies toward change in
grain size as the result of the stress cycling.

A major effect of thermal cycling at a frequency
of 0.4 cps seems to be the production of long
intergranular stringers which extend far below the

205 assignment from Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

stressed Inconel tubing exposed to fluoride salts.
Typical examples of this effect are shown in
Fig. 1.7.5.

A graphical summary of the data which have been
obtained in this thermal-cycling study is presented
in Fig. 1.7.6. While more data are needed, the
presently available information does indicate that
for exposures of less than 20 hr, the attack rate is
greater for thermally cycled specimens than it is
for specimens not cycled. For exposures of more
than 20 hr the isothermal and high-frequency
curves are roughly parallel, and thus equal attack
rates are indicated that are perhaps related to the
chromium concentration in the melt. Further, since

the low-frequency data lie within the scatter band
for the high-frequency data, it appears that cycling
frequency has little effect. Additional data will
be obtained at 0.01 cps and at higher frequencies
(V to 2 cps) in order to verify this conclusion.

In order to study the efféct of prior stress, bent
and prestressed tubes have been tested. The
experiments were made at an average test section
temperature of 1600°F, with fluctuations of 30°F,
for both coarse- and fine-grained tubes which were
either in an annealed (as-received) or prestrained
(allowed to creep for 24 hr at 1200°F with an
initial stress of 40,000 psi) condition. Specimens
are being prepared for metallographic examination.

Pulse-Pump System
A. I. Krakoviak A. G. Smith, Jr.?

Initial operational checks of the high-frequency
pulse-pump thermal-cycling loop® were completed
with water as the fluid and air as the cover and
pulsing gas. A ‘B’ pump with a 4-in.-dia piston
and a ]/2-in. stroke was used to generate approxi-
mately sinusoidal air pressure oscillations at fre-
quencies ranging from 0.5 to 10 cps. These pulsa-
tions were transmitted to the water in the pulse
chambers in order to force alternate hot and cold
slugs of liquid through the test section. Both fluid
stream and test-section inner-surface temperatures
were measured., Pulsing efficiencies and attenua-
tion ratios were obtained at total water flow rates
of 6, 8, and 10 gpm. The pulsing efficiency is
defined as the maximum thermal amplitude of the
liquid slugs downstream of the pulser divided by

one-half the temperature difference between the
fluids in the hot and cold pulser chambers. The
attenuation ratio, 7, is the ratio of the thermal
amplitude of the tube inner surface to the thermal
amplitude of the stream. Pulser pressures were
varied from 5.7 to 12,9 psig. The results of short,
high-pressure tests made at flow rates of 8 and
10 gpm are presented in Fig. 1.7.7. These cali-
bration results will be used to predict the inner-
surface thermal amplitudes over the flow-rate and
pulse-frequency range studied.

Thermal Oscillation Attenuation in Tubes
J. J. Keyes

Measurements were made of the axial decay of a
sinusoidal fluid temperature oscillation in turbu-
lently flowing water in an Inconel tube to obtain
data that would be of direct application in evalu-
ating the water-test performance data for the pulse-
pump thermal-cycling loop, described above. For
these measurements, the test section was located
some distance downstream of the point of maximum
thermal oscillation. From the data obtained with
water and the approximate expression given by
Eq. 1 below, the axial damping of thermal oscilla-
tions in fused salt systems can be estimated.

The desired expression relating the axial attenu-
ation ratio, R, to the radial attenuation ratio, 7
(described above), the fluid properties, the system
geometry, and other parameters was obtained from
heat balance relations corrected to allow for the
“‘thermal capacity’’ of an empirically determined
thermal boundary layer in which fully developed
turbulent flow was assumed. The expression ob-

tained was

It may be seen that decreasing the wall thickness
results in an increase in surface amplitude at low
frequencies.

The axial attenuation ratio, R, is shown in Fig.
1.7.12 for the two geometries considered. The fluid
was taken to be water at 90°F. The empirical co-
efficient « was taken to be 2.5 on the basis of an
experimentally measured R for a plastic tube for
which 7 cos € = 1 (see Eq. 1). It was assumed
in applying the results for 7 in a rectangular
geometry that the effect of wall curvature was
negligible over the frequency range of interest.
The thermal amplitudes, A, and A, (from which
R was obtained), were measured with a 36-gage
Chromel-Alumel thermocouple located at midstream.
The radial variation in the thermocouple position
appears to have little effect on the measured R,
The agreement between the measured and calcu-
lated R’s was found to be within 10% at frequencies
up to about 6 cps, and therefore it is believed that
Eq. 1 can be used to estimate R in systems with
thermal diffusivities near that of water. Thus, the
equation is applicable for fused salt systems but
not for liquid metal systems.

elements were studied. Both a silver-plating tech-
nique similar to that empleyeds.in the production
of glass mirrors and the technique which involves
electrodeposition of nickel over graphite were
tried. The electroplating technique proved to be
easier and more successful. In addition, it was
found to be possible to deposit the hot-wire element
directly on the test surface and thus eliminate the
surface continuity problems associated with re-
movable probes. These elements possess greater
stability than those used previously.® Because of
polarization effects which occur when direct-
current bridge circuits are used, the instrumentation
has been altered to include an alternating-current
circuit., A Hathaway MRC-18 strain-gage control
unit with a 5-kc carrier was used as the alternating-
current source.

The elements were used in preliminary experi-
ments with a direct-current Wheatstone bridge cir-
cuit and a Brush amplifier-recorder to obtain the
transient characteristics of the boundary layers

stream from the pump center line (station F). The
curves presented are for the temperature oscilla-

urements of surface temperature fluctuations in a
metallic wall. The unit is operated by applying
sufficient current to the resistance heater to raise
the probe surface to 10 to 20°F above the ambient
water temperature. The transient emf generated
by the surface thermocouple is then recorded as a
function of time. It was found that the fluctuations,

should be pointed out that this probe did not fit
precisely flush with the inner surface of the core
model, there being as much as 10 mils discon-
tinuity between the probe and wall surface. This
difference resulted from the contour of the wall and
will be minimized in further experiments.

A number of additional configurations were in-
vestigated in the flow-guidance development
studies. The first of these consisted of an in-
verted, conical, island-bellows mockup section
(designated bellows modification No. 2) without
auxiliary flow guidance. The flow in this system
showed extreme instabilities.

The second configuration tested consisted of a
combination of the bellows modification No. 2, a
core inlet arrangement that included a GS-2 vane,
a GS-2-P3 baffle plate, and a slotted disk (desig-
nated F-2 flame-ring). The flame-ring was located
approximately 9]/4 in. above the equator. It was
believed that these auxiliary components would
stabilize and distribute the flow exiting from the
bellows mockup evenly across the annulus while
preserving the rotational component. The flow
instabilities were damped considerably in com-
parison with those of the swirl system, but the
remaining instability was sufficient to indicate

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

that no significant improvement in flow charac-
teristics had been obtained.

The third configuration tested consisted of the
core inlet arrangement and flame-ring described
above and an island bellows mockup modified by
changing the straight conical surface to a concave
radial surface. This bellows mockup is designated
bellows modification No. 3. No improvement in
flow stability over that obtained with bellows
modification No. 2 was noted.

Quarter-Scale Core Studies
G. L. Muller®

The apparatus for flow studies of a quarter-scale
ART core model with an ART type of header and
screen packing in the core was fabricated. The
system is currently being assembled.

An analysis was made which showed that a
pressure variation occurs along the header length
as the result of momentum changes in the fluid as
it traverses the header prior to entering the core.
Since the friction losses are small in this region,
they were neglected in the calculation. If there
exists 100% effectiveness in momentum transfer as
the fluid leaves the header, the equation

(4) dp = - —— | L2
b= 7Y@

can be written, where p is pressure, p is density,
g, is the gravitational constant, A is header cross-
sectional area, and w is mass flow rate in the
header. Then for uniform flow withdrawal per unit
of header cross-sectional areq,

o e (-F)n

where x is distance from inlet of header, X is
length of header, and w, is inlet mass flow rate.
The linear equation

(6) A = a - bx

may be taken as a close approximation to the
header area variation. Then, upon integration of
Eq. 4, after substitution of Eqs. 5 and 6, the re-
sulting equation is

Equation 7 was evaluated for the headers shown in

(second inlet).

The calculated pressure differences are approxi-
mately the same as the core pressure loss (1 to
2 psi). Whether these differences are actually
this large and whether they cause significant
peripheral flow asymmetries or cross flows has not
yet been determined. Data obtained with the full-
scale core model” indicate that the flow is fairly
uniform with respect to peripheral position at the
core exit; but no conclusive information is avail-
able as to the existence of either significant inlet
asymmetries or cross flow. It is planned to in-
vestigate these factors in future experiments,

Additional calculations have been made of the
heat transfer from screens located in the reactor
core region., The analysis indicates that at full-
power operation, the screen metal will be approxi-
mately 3°F above the surrounding fluid tempera-
ture, if a heat source in the Inconel of 80 w/cm?3
is assumed. During a fuel dump the screens will
be free-convection cooled by the surrounding
helium. Under these conditions the screen heat
source is approximately 8 w/cm® as a result of
decay gamma-ray absorption from the receding fuel.
The temperature difference between the screens
and the helium will be approximately 63°F. This
is considerably less than the 1100°F difference
previously found® for conduction cooling to the

walls alone and indicates that good thermal con-
tact between the screens and the core walls is not
needed.

The possibility that the fuel may be retained in
the openings of the screens during a fuel dump
appears unlikely in view of the apparent nonwetting
of Inconel by the fuel mixture. However, it is
proposed to check this point by dipping representa-
tive samples of Inconel screen into NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,
(50-46-4 mole %), holding them in the salt for
varying lengths of time, removing them, and ob-
serving the extent of salt retention,

Instantaneous Yelocity Profile Measurements

F. E. Lynch

The photographic recording of instantaneous
velocity profiles visualized by phosphorescent
particles in flowing water was continued. A
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

number of photographs were obtained for flow in
2.5in.-ID plastic pipe over the Reynolds modulus
range of 1200 to 80,000, It was found that, in the
laminar flow region, fluid-to-wall temperature dif-
ferences of less than 2°F were sufficient to cause
free convection and to distort the velocity profiles.
This effect was noticed even at Reynolds moduli
above 10,000. At the higher Reynolds moduli a
smearing of the profile occurs as the result of
particle movement during the time the shutter is
open. A rather slow shutter speed (]/50 sec) has
been used, and during this time a particle will
have moved 0.1 in. at a Reynolds modulus of 10,000
and 0.66 in, at a Reynolds modulus of 60,000,

Additional photographs were therefore made of
flow in the 2.5-in. tube with a 35mm Leica camera
equipped with an £/1.5 (50-mm) lens. The Reynolds
modulus was varied from 1500 to 150,000, Shutter
speeds of l/5 sec were used at the low flow rates,
and speeds of ]/]000 sec were used for the higher
Thus, for Ng, = 150,000 and the
l/looo-sec shutter speed the particles move only
0.07 in. during the time the shutter is open. Good
contrast negatives were obtained.

Photographs were also taken of flow in the l-in.
glass pipe with a length-to-diameter ratio of 60,
The flow rates were adjusted to give Reynolds
moduli of 500, 1000, 1500, 3000, 5000, and 10,000.
A preliminary analysis was made of the data, and
the results obtained at several Reynolds moduli

of local velocity to maximum velocity (center line),

ratio, r/ro. For comparison the parabolic laminar-
flow profile and the 1/7-power-law turbulent profile
are sketched in. Since the flow is symmetrical
about the center line, the profiles have been doubled
over. Thus, in Fig. 1.7.17 the open circles are
for the left side of the profile and the filled circles
are for the right side. The shift from the laminar
profile in Fig. 1.7.17a toward the turbulent profile
in Fig. 1.7.17d is apparent. Moreover, the effect
of free convection on the profiles can be clearly
seen, In this study flow was downward through the
tube,

A new entrance section and grids for the 6- and
8-deg wedge are being fabricated. Individual
pictures will be taken to determine the velocity
structure in each of these wedges. A series of
consecutive photographs will also be made in an
attempt to record the shift of the separation region

HEAT EXCHANGERS AND RADIATORS

ART Fuel-to-NaK Heat Exchanger

Pressure Distribution

R. D. Peak? S. Kress?

A preliminary study for determining the pressure
loads on the walls of adjacent channels of the ART
fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers was completed. In
the reactor, these channels, each containing a
260-tube unit of the heat exchanger, will prevent
short circuiting of the fuel along the direct path
between the south and north headers and at the
same time will provide tube support by resisting
the integrated fluid drag forces. However, in de-
fining separate flow paths, the channels will create
a situation in which large pressure differences can
exist across the channel walls. This is illustrated
in an idealized form in Fig. 1.7.18. It is assumed
that at station A-A the fluid is uniformly distributed
between the three ducts. At this point the pressure
profile across the channels is uniform and equal.
In moving downstream a fixed distance from the
entrance, the fluid in each of the channels will
suffer equal pressure loss. Then, at some station
B-B, sufficiently far from the bend, the pressure
distributions in each channel will be as shown,
In the region of the bend, this is further exaggerated
by the nonuniform pressure distribution resulting
from the curved flow. The net effect is a con-
siderable transverse pressure difference across the
wall of adjoining flow channels. It has been esti-
mated, as an upper limit, that these transverse
pressure loads may be as much as 16.5% (6.4 psi)
of the total pressure drop through the unit. Early
results from a detailed stress analysis of the
composite channel-and-header configuration indi-
cate that for pressure loads of this magnitude addi-
structural support will be required at the
equatorial station. Thus, precise information as
to the pressure distribution along the channel walls
is needed before a final design of this region can
be effected. Further, the pressure distribution in
the channels is dependent upon the fuel leakage
across the gap between the edges of the walls of

The test unit was constructed so that the channel
pressure distributions could be studied for water
flow both with and without a gap between adjacent
channel walls and the housing. Since the fabri-
cation of a spherical-spiral test piece geometrically

similar to the units of the reactor heat exchanger
was too difficult, a unit consisting of a pair of
straight, flat bundles bent at each end was con-
structed. A photograph of this test unit is shown
in Fig. 1.7.19. The results obtained with this
apparatus only approximate the real system in that
the pressure variations caused by the spherical
curvature of the heat exchanger channel are not
duplicated. Rods 0.25 in. in outside diameter and

71 in. long between bends were used to represent
the heat exchanger tubes. These rods were held in
position by six inclined spacers and seven stag-
gered spacers on each bundle. The two bundles
were housed in adjacent, parallel channels made of
l-in.-thick Plexiglas. A total of 144 pressure taps
was provided for obtaining static measurements
along all four walls of each channel. The test
runs were made at a Reynolds modulus of 12,000,

A number of factors combined to reduce the sig-
nificance of the data obtained in this study. The
most important of these are (1) that during con-
struction the inclined and staggered spacers were
switched so that the test unit no longer represented
the spacer  configuration of the reactor heat ex-
changer and (2) that, while the average gap between
channel walls and the housing was 0.061 in., this
opening actually varied unevenly from 0.004 to
0.119 in. along the channel length.

Typical pressure profiles for the two channels,
with and without a gap, are shown in Fig. 1.7.20
at a number of positions along the channels, In
this figure, the isobar lines (given as percentage
of total pressure drop) are plotted in direct relation
to the test geometry. As anticipated, the isobars
for the no-gap condition are similar in the two
bundles. However, because of the 60-deg turns at
the inlet and exit ond the effect of the spacers,
the isobars do not become perpendicular to the flow

96

within the extent of the test unit, It may be seen
from Fig. 1.7.20 that the presence of the gap re-
sulted in a shift in the isobars as compared with
the no-gap condition. This change was not the
same in the two channels; the isobars moved down-
stream in the left channel and upstream in the right
channel. This created reverse pressure loads on
the channels walls (illustrated by the 40% line) at
the 40, 50, and 60% isobar positions,

In view of the inadequacy of these results, it is
planned to redesign the test apparatus and to re-
peat the experiment in the near future. The re-
sults, in a qualitative sense, do indicate that the
gap tends to equalize the pressure on the opposite
sides of the channel walls,

Delta-Array Heat Exchangers
J. L. Wantland

Further heat transfer and fluid friction data were
obtained with the delta-array heat exchanger!'? in
the low laminar flow region (120 < Ng_ < 1000).
The results (Fig. 1.7.21) show that below a
Reynolds modulus of 500 the data are no longer
correlated by the empirical equation

N

Nu

 

= 0.47 N%:3¢
0.4
NPr

which was previously found to describe the heat
transfer for Np_ <2300, Since the natural-convec-
tion effect should influence the results at these
low Reynolds moduli, the heat exchanger was
operated with flow in the normal direction (upward
at a 45-deg angle) and in the reverse direction
(downward at a 45-deg angle). For upward flow,
free convection should increase the heat transfer
and reduce the pressure drop. Flow in the reverse
direction should cause the opposite effects. These
qualitative statements are borne out by the ex-
perimental data obtained at Reynolds moduli below
200. Thus, in Fig. 1.7.21, the heat transfer param-
eter, NNU/Ng‘r4, shows, for upward flow, an in-
crease above the general trend of the data below
Ngp, = 500. Conversely, the downward flow data
fall below the results which would be expected in
the absence of natural convection. The value of

Heat Transfer Studies of Finned Tubes
J. L. Wantland H. W, qufmon

A survey is being made of the available informa-
tion on the heat transfer and the fluid friction
characteristics of flow through banks of finned
tubes. Data'T=13 for several sets of staggered
banks of finned tubes are compared in Fig. 1.7.23.
The physical characteristics of these configura-
tions are listed in Table 1.7.4, In Fig. 1.7.23, the
Colburn j-factor is based on the hydraulic diameter,
which is defined as

4LA
y e
b A ’
where L is the configuration flow length, A _ is the
minimum free flow area, and A is the total heat
transfer area, With the exception of work performed
at ORNL, no data were found for in-line banks of

tubes.,

It is possible to correlate data for banks of un-
finned tubes with a single equation, A similar
correlation for finned tubes, however, presents
considerably more difficulty. This situation arises
trom the need to include a number of additional
variables relating to the configuration (fin spacing,
height, type, etc.) and to the fin efficiency, which
is a function of the heat transfer coefficient at the
fin surface and the thermal conductivity of the fin
material,

If the literature survey indicates a lack of data
pertinent to radiators of the in-line type, an ex-
perimental program to study and to optimize the
geometry of such compact heat exchangers will be
considered. Preliminary calculations indicate that
the testing of radiator cores (6- to 8-in, cubes) with
the use of resistance heating of the tubes and air
as the test fluid is feasible.

FUSED SALT HEAT TRANSFER

Further studies were initiated of forced-convec-
tion heat transfer with NaNO,-NaNO ,-KNO, (40-7-
53 wt %) flowing through heated tubes. The experi-
mental system was modified slightly from that used
in earlier heat transfer experiments.!® The fluid
weight rate is obtained by using an overhead
cantilever beam with a microformer to measure the
beam deflection, and the fluid cycling is controlled
by the microformer signal. A mechanical stirrer is
used in the sump tank to ensure uniformity of tem-
perature with time in the salt entering the test
section,

Data were obtained during the quarter over the
Reynolds modulus range of 5000 to 18,000. It was
found that the heat transfer coefficient varied from
800 to 2500 Btu/hr+ft2:°F over the range studied.
The results are presented in Fig. 1.7.24 in terms
of the heat transfer parameter, Ny U/Ng',4: and com-
pared with earlier data obtained in this laboratory

velocity, temperature, and pressure have been ob-
tained. A larger system (3-in.-dia tube) has been
designed and is being fabricated. Provision has
been made to obtain the required tube traverses
with this apparatus.

The data obtained for air in nonreversed source-
vortex flow indicate, based on measurements over
a narrow range of low flow rates, that for equal
energy dissipation per unit area of heat transfer
surface the heat transfer coefficients are com-
parable to those for straight-through flow. It is
hoped that more extensive studies with the larger
tube will reveal optimization procedures that will
yield significant thermal efficiency advantage for
the vortex case.

Velocity profiles were obtained for flow in a
2-in, vortex tube, and two typical photographs are
shown in Fig. 1.7.27., The vortex movement of
the fluid can be clearly seen.

effects are detectable. For higher turbulence
(30,000 < N < 500,000), the work of other in-
vestigators who have studied liquid metals with
heat transfer indicates no free-convection
effects. In order to obtain data without the free-
convection contribution at the lower Reynolds
moduli, studies will also be made with a ]/4-in.-dia

Thermal Conductivity

The variable-gap method is now being used ex-
clusively for the determination of the thermal con-
ductivity of liquids. The old apparatus is being
modified to provide better guarding of the heat
meter and a greater assurance of axial heat flow
through the sample. The work of this modification
is substantially complete. A small, new apparatus
has been built and tested with the nitrate-nitrite
mixture NaNO,-NaNO;-KNO, (40-7-53 wt %). In
this measurement the heat flow was obtained both
above and below the sample. A conductivity value
of 0.33 Btu/hr«ft:°F was found by using the upper
heat meter, and a value of 0.40 Btu/hrft°F was
found with the lower heat meter. These values

1.8. ART, ETU, AND IN-PILE OPERATIONS

H. W. Savage

ART OPERATION PLANNING
W. B. Cottrell
C. W. Cunningham S. M. DeCamp

A study was made of the time required to com-
plete the ART experimental program after the system
is constructed. A minimum of 2‘/2 months, not pre-
viously provided in the schedule, will be required
for shakedown tests prior to filling the system with
NaK. Studies are under way to find ways to
schedule these tests during the construction period
and thereby eliminate a postponement of reactor
startup. After completion of the shakedown tests,
the operation of the ART will begin with the
loading of NaK into the system, and completion of
the planned operation of the reactor system is
expected to require 4‘/2 months from that time. An
outline of the experimental program has been pre-
pared, but detailed procedures have not yet been
developed.

A number of studies and tests pertinent to the
design and operation of the ART off-gas system
were conducted during the quarter. Investigations
described in Chap. 4.1, ‘‘Radiation Damage,"’
indicated that only 10% more coke charcoal than
coconut charcoal would be required, and therefore
the less-expensive coke charcoal will be used in
the off-gas system adsorber beds. The leakage
specification for the reactor off-gas line in the
vent house region is so stringent, total of 10~ std
cm3/sec, that it exceeds the sensitivity of helium
leak detectors. Therefore this line and associated
equipment will be provided with an enclosure and
will be vented to a stack.

The concept of an information room in the ART
facility to house live instruments that would dupli-
cate control room data was abandoned. It was
originally thought that this facility would permit
personnel to obtain data for analysis without dis-
rupting control room operations, but a reanalysis of
this premise has shown that the type and extent of
the data that could be provided would not be satis-
factory. The space assigned to the information
room will be retained for the storage and examina-
tion of recorder charts and records removed from
the main and auxiliary control rooms during opera-
tion,

106

ETU OPERATION PLANNING
W. B. Cottrell
C. W. Cunningham S. M. DeCamp

Evaluation studies of ETU operation planning
were continued, and it was found that the specifi-
cations for leak tightness of components and
systems external to the reactor could be relaxed.
In addition, heater-sheath thermocouples were
eliminated on all but a few special heaters. Pre-
liminary panel-board layouts were completed.

Work on the preparation of operating procedures
was continued, and flow diagrams were revised as
required by design changes. The significant
changes made in the flow diagrams during the
quarter are summarized below:

1. Temperature, pressure, flow, and level values
were brought up to date.

2. Piping, valves, and equipment were rearranged
to agree with the actual layout and with current
planning.

3. A helium-bubbler type of continuous level
indicator was added to the fluid fill-and-drain tank.
Since these level indicators require some helium
flow at all times, valves in the equalization line
between the tank and the two pump barrels must
normally be open.

4, Particulate-matter filters were added at the
cold end of each NaK condenser and the sodium
condenser, since it is essential that the down-
stream solenoid gas valves be free of alkali metals.

5. The lead shielding mockup was eliminated.

6. Modifications were made to permit the charging
of sodium into the system through the auxiliary
rather than the main expansion tank. The initial
fill level will be established with one spark-plug
probe in the auxiliary expansion tank. During
thermal expansion and contraction periods, the level
will be followed by a continuous level-indicating
device in each sodium expansion tank.

7. The individual remotely operated isolation
valves for the NaK pump lube-oil systems were
modified for air operation because a solenoid
valve which would meet the operational require-
ments could not be obtained.

g,
g
Tabulations of the ETU valves and strain gages
were completed that were based on the latest re-
visions to the flow diagrams. The total number of
valves required has been reduced from 689 to 617,
largely by the replacement of the reactor pump
hydraulic drive motors with electric drive motors.
The numbers, types, locations, and test sequences
for the strain gages were established. A total of
144 strain gages will be required for measurements
of lift strain, pressure strain, prestressing strains,
and strain required for temperature compensation.
The ETU instrument application tabulation is being
brought up to date. This revision will reflect the
latest changes in the flow diagrams.

ART AND ETU DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURES
W. B. Cottrell

As has been the plan for some time, the assembly
of the ART will not be completed until after ex-
amination of the ETU reactor assembly. However,
in addition to the reactor, there are other parts of
the ETU system which should be examined fol-
lowing operation of the ETU. In order to plan
properly both for the high- and low-priority ETU
disassembly, a survey was made of the specific
examinations to be performed and the results that
would constitute an acceptable basis on which to
proceed with the assembly of the ART. The de-
sired tests, including complete metallographic ex-
amination of heat exchangers, weld junctions,
shells, etc., as well as replication of the shells
prior to metallographic sectioning, were so ex-
tensive as to significantly extend the scheduled
assembly date. The tests are being screened in
order to distinguish those which are essential to

the ART assembly.

In the course of this study and the investigation
related to ART disassembly problems, it has be-
come increasingly apparent that residual fuel in
the reactor will present problems that will affect
disassembly, maintenance of the mechanical in-
tegrity of disassembled components, and, in the
case of the ART, a radiation and contamination
hazard., |t is therefore proposed to flush the fuel
system with a water-soluble salt after operation.
Appropriate tests to demonstrate the feasibility and
the efficacy of this procedure are to be made.

IN-PILE EXPERIMENTATION
J. A. Conlin

In-Pile Loops

In-pile loop No. 6, which was operated in the
MTR, as described previously,! is being dis-
assembled and metallographically examined in the
ORNL hot cells (see Chap. 4.1, ‘‘Radiation
Damage’’), and the causes of a number of the diffi-
culties encountered during the operation of this
loop have been established. The lower heat ex-
changer Calrod heater which failed during pre-
heating as a result of overheating was found to
have melted through its sheath. The nose purge-
gas sniffer line, the failure of which had been in-
dicated by a drop in the nose purge-gas pressure
during loop operation, had broken adjacent to the
weld joining it to the heat exchanger outlet end.
This loop had been subjected to severe thermal
cycling during operation that had flexed the sniffer
line in the vicinity ot this weld.

The disassembly also disclosed the probable
cause of the severe perturbations in pump speed
encountered during the latter part of the operation.
An accumulation of salt was found around the shaft
between the pump sump and the bearing housing,
which was at temperatures below the freezing point
of the salt. This accumulation resulted from the
pump sump having been overfilled to the point
(]/2 in, above normal) that the shaft slinger was
partially submerged. The region between the pump
sump and the copper shaft rotor was about half
full of salt, and some salt had entered the close-
clearance region between the copper rotor and the
pump housing. The copper rotor and shaft were
badly scored. The cause of the overfilling is not
known, but it may have occurred when the pump
was stopped for removal of a plug in the flowmeter
orifice of the hydraulic drive motor. When an
attempt was made to restart the fuel pump, it was
found that the fuel had frozen. Considerably more
heat than is normal was required in order to free
the rotor. Although these actions should not have

In-Pile Test of Moderator Materials

A second in-pile test was made of reactor moder-
ator materials for use at high temperatures.? Three
samples - beryllium oxide encased in Inconel,
graphite encased in nickel, and zirconium hydride
encased in molybdenum - were irradiated in hole
HB-3 of the MTR from February 18 through
April 1, 1957, through two MTR reactor cycles.
Initially, the samples were surrounded by a helium

resulting from gamma-ray heating were below the
design temperature of 1500°F, and the atmosphere
was changed to argon to reduce thermal losses.
The capsule surface temperatures in the two
environments are shown in Table 1.8.1,

The capsule dosages were about 2.3 x 10'?
neutrons/cm? in a fast neutron flux of 10'3
neutrons/cm? sec, and the gamma-ray heating was
4 to 5 w/g. The samples were subjected to 44
temperature cycles resulting from reactor power
fluctuations and scheduled retraction and reinser-
tion of the apparatus in the beam hole. Tempera-
tures decreased to varying levels during cycling
that ranged from reactor ambient temperature during
shutdown to 1150°F during retraction. The cap-
sules have been returned to ORNL for examination.

REACTOR CONFIGURATIONS

Studies of reactor cores with fuel-cooled moder-
ators were continued, and the two new layouts
prepared are shown in Figs. 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. The
layout presented in Fig. 1.9.1 incorporates two
important new features. The first of these is a
species of reflector-moderated core which would
permit some superheating of the fuel in an annulus
between a central moderated island and an outer
core region. The arrangement would be somewhat
similar to that envisioned in the layout presented
previously,! in that the moderator would be in the
form of rods closely stacked in an equilateral
lattice. The rod diameter would be varied from one
region to another to effect variations in the volumes
devoted to fuel and moderator. An island region
consisting of, perhaps, 70 vol % fuel would surround
the control rod. The annulus between the island
and the outer core region would consist entirely
of fuel. The outer core region would vary from,
perhaps, 50 vol % of fuel in the inner zone to 10
vol % fuel in the outer portion. A boron curtain
would surround this outer core region, and outside
it would be placed a closely stacked array of rods
which would consist of about 5 vol % fuel, with
the balance being moderator, structure, and B4C.
This region, which has been designated the ‘‘heat
exchanger shield,’”’ would isolate the core from the
heat exchanger and inhibit activation of the second-
ary coolant. Fuel would flow downward through
the island, the outer core region, and the heat
exchanger shield, and would return upward through
the fuel annulus, where a further increase in
temperature would occur. It would then flow
radially outward through passages at the top of
the core and enter a U-tube heat exchanger con-
taining approximately 12 tube bundles. This heat
exchanger presents the second novel feature of
this configuration. The tubes would be as nearly
straight as it appears to be possible to make heat
exchanger tubes and yet obtain a satisfactory con-
figuration for the header sheet and adequate pro-
vision for differential thermal expansion. It is

difficult to arrive at a configuration which provides
an adequate ligament thickness in the heat ex-
changer header sheet (to get satisfactory tube-to-
header sheet welding) and also provides adequate
resistance to the differential pressure loads across
the header sheet.

The fuel pump impellers would be inverted to
provide the most direct flow passage from the heat
exchanger to the core. This configuration will be
a little bit better than that used for the ART from
the standpoint of balancing the pressures between
the pump inlet and the fuel expansion tank, which
in this instance would lie on the low-pressure side
of the impeller rather than the high-pressure side.
A centrifuge arrangement similar to that to be used
in the ART would probably serve to isolate the
expansion tank from the impelier and provide
adequate bubble separation in the bypass flow
through the expansion tank. Small bleed-flow
passages would be provided to feed fuel throughout
the mass of the reactor in order to remove radiation
heat generated in parts such as the pressure shell,
neutron shield for the exchanger, etc. Three fuel
pumps would be installed at the top of the core to
provide a capacity of approximately 300 Mw. The
NaK pipes leaving the top of the reactor pressure
shell would probably be carried through the shield
before being manifolded. This would give improved
flexibility in the NaK piping and reduce thermal
stresses associated with differences in tempera-
ture between the various NaK circuits under unusual
off-design conditions. The two-pass fuel flow
through the core should lead to a marked reduction
in the boundary-layer heating problem and hence
to a further reduction in the moderator-rod-surface
temperature. The core pressure drop would, of
course, be greater than in the single-pass arrange-
ment.

The layout of Fig. 1.9.2 was prepared in an effort
to see whether a fuel-cooled moderator could be
incorporated in a modification of the ART. The
intention would be to modify as few parts as
possible, and, as may be seen, the same fuel
pumps, heat exchanger, outer pressure shell, con-
trol rods, and island base could be used. By
including three fuel pumps instead of two, the
reactor output might be increased to approximately

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

100 M *The fuel expansion tank volume at the
top of the reactor would be in the reflector and
island regions, and moderator rods similar to those
envisioned for the layout presented previously'
would be used, along with a nickel reflector
approximately 4 in. thick. The region outside the
nickel reflector would be made up of moderator
rods spaced in a close-packed array surrounded by
an outer band of boron carbide. Fuel would be
bled through the region between the core and the
heat exchanger to remove the radiation heat gener-
ated there. Fuel would also be bled between the
pressure shell and the pressure-shell liner to cool
those parts. Disks of poison would be inserted in
the ends of the moderator rods to inhibit fissioning
in the end ducts and reduce the discontinuity in
the shielding at the ends. No internal welds would
be required in this system, except those for canning
the poison and the moderator. The welded as-
semblies would, in most cases, be small, and leak
tightness could be more readily assured than in
the more complex structures that separate the
sodium and fuel circuits in the ART. In large
measure, the various assemblies could be bolted
together, with slip-joint connections between parts
that are required for separation of the various fuel
channels.

A study of the effects of various key parameters
on the temperature drop within the moderator rods
of cores such as those presented here has been
prepared (see section on ‘‘Temperature Structure
in a Reactor Core with a Fuel-Cooled Moderator,”’
this chapter). Heating effects in the volume-heat-
source boundary layer of the fuel channel were
included. These parametric charts will be useful
in evaluating design proposals and in establishing
the desirable proportions for the rod diameters in
the various regions, as well as the fuel passage
sizes.

COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGERS

Many of the difficulties currently being experi-
enced in the fabrication of the fuel-to-NaK heat
exchanger for the ART have been ascribed to the
unusual geometry. An effort is therefore under way
to investigate other types of heat exchanger con-
figurations to determine their suitability for use
in future designs. The design problems experienced
in the ART were reviewed, and the following list
of conditions which must be satisfied in the design

112

of any future compact liquid-to-liquid heat ex-
changers was prepared:

1. Differential thermal expansion between tubes
and shell walls must be accommodated, preferably
elastically.

2. Ligaments in the tube sheet must be ot least
0.1 in. thick for good welding.

3. The length of the lever arm between the tube
sheet and the center line of the main section of
the tube must be limited to about 1.0 in. or less to
accommodate drag forces on the tubes.

4. The tube diameter must be no greater than
0.25 in.

5. The tube sheets must be curved in order to
keep pressure stresses at reasonable values.

6. Adequate flow passage area into and out of
the tube matrix must be provided for the shell-side
fluid.

7. Adequate flow passage area must be provided
in the header drums.

8. The shell walls must be curved to keep pres-
sure stresses at reasonable values.

9. The shell walls should not be too thick to
keep thermal stresses reasonably low in the event
of temperature transients.

10. Thermal sleeves must be provided where the
tube-side-fluid pipes penetrate the heat exchanger
shell.

11. Flow bypass between the tube matrix and
the shell should be less than 10%, and, preferably,
less than 5%.

12. Adequate provision for spacing the tubes
must be made to assure good velocity and tempera-
ture distribution.

13. Provision must be made to keep thermal
stresses in the shell at reasonable values at the
parting plane between the cold and hot legs of some
types of heat exchanger, for example, a U-tube type.

A series of different geometries has been de-
lineated which may satisfy the conditions given
above. The three most difficult requirements to
meet are those of provision for differential thermal
expansion, provision for adequate ligaments in the
tube sheet between the tube holes, and provision
for minimizing the bending stresses in the tubes
that are associated with drag forces on the main
runs of tubing. Six types of heat exchangers
devised to accommodate these three basic require-
ments are shown in Fig. 1.9.3. The first type, the
“hockey stick,”’ was employed by KAPL in the

heat exchangers designed for the SIR. The U-tube
type of heat exchanger was used in the layout of
Fig. 1.9.1. The ‘‘circular-arc’’ type of heat ex-
changer was employed in the sodium-to-NaK heat
exchanger of the ART. It is interesting to note
that the cost of these tube bundles after the tooling
had been prepared was about the same as the cost
of tube bundles for the fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger.
Variations of the circular-arc heat exchanger would
include helical spirals and the variable-pitch
helices employed in the ART. In each instance,
differential thermal expansion between the tubes
and the pressure shell would be absorbed by pro-
viding adequate clearance between the tube bundle
and the shell so that the increased length of tube
could be accommodated by radial expansion. A
fourth type of unit incorporates a flexible member
between one header drum and the pressure shell.
Such a member could have a form similar to that
of the Sylphon bellows. The fifth configuration is
a variation of the fourth configuration in which the
flexible bellows would deform in bending rather
than in compression. The sixth type might have
application for certain special installations, such
as steam generators. The fluid would enter through
a central tube and return through an annulus be-
tween it and an outer thimble. This type of heat
exchanger would reduce both thermal and drag
stresses to an absolute minimum but would have
the disadvantage that quite wide spacing between
tubes in the header sheet and in the tube matrix
would be required.

IN-PILE TESTS OF MODERATOR MATERIALS
G. Samvels

A preliminary design for an apparatus for in-pile
testing of moderator materials suitable for use in
the 1500 and 2000°F range was prepared. The
apparatus is designed to go into one of the central
3- by 3-in. holes in the ETR core. Samples of
beryllium oxide and yttrium hydride ranging from
1/2 to 1 in. in diameter will be tested at power
densities closely approaching those in a 200-Mw,
24-in.-dia reactor core. The design studies re-
vealed that heat removal by thermal radiation and
conduction through a gas film 0.015 to 0.025 in.
thick to a water-cooled surface would be more
satisfactory than cooling by a high-velocity gas

stream, as initially planned. A mixture of helium
and argon can be used as the gas film, and the
composition of this gas mixture can be varied from
pure helium to pure argon to effect a variation in
heat load by a factor of about 4. The heat will be
removed from the thimble containing the specimens
by the reactor water system. The arrangement
envisioned will permit simultaneous testing of
about six specimens approximately 3 in. long. Slugs
of Inconel will be included to provide for a cali-

TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE IN A REACTOR
CORE WITH A FUEL-COOLED MODERATOR

L. D. Palmer

preliminary studies were made of the

temperature structure in a reactor core with a fuel-

Some

cooled moderator of the type shown previously'
and in Fig. 1.9.1. For the study it was assumed
that the reactor core consisted of a uniformly
spaced lattice of constant-diameter moderator rods
oriented with their axes parallel to the direction
of fuel flow. With the aid of this basic model a
generalized calculation was made to obtain suitable
expressions for the radial and axial temperature
rises in the moderator rods for various ratios of
fuel volume to moderator volume and fuel power
density to moderator power density. These calcu-
lations revealed that a convenient measure of the
thermal capacity of a particular core configuration
is the ratio of the heat used in elevating the datum
temperature of the materials in the core to the total
available heat in the fuel. It should be pointed
out that the results of these studies, which were
carried out for various uniform moderator lattices
and based on radially uniform power densities, are
applicable to cores with variable rod size and
power distribution, since, in first approximation,
such configurations may be treated as systems of
concentric unifgrm cylindrical annuli.

cal core composed of beryllium oxide rods immersed
in the fuel mixture NoF-KF-LiF-UF4 (11.2-41-
45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107). The heat transfer

mechanisms which control the temperatures in such

Detailed calculations

a system are the radial heat conduction process in
the moderator rods and the radial eddy diffusion
and axial convection in the fuel. The general
method described previously® for calculating un-
cooled wall temperatures in systems containing
fluids with volume heat sources was used for these
calculations. The difference between the uncooled
wall temperature and the mixed-mean fuel tempera-
ture was computed by using the hydraulic diameter
concept to describe the flow passages. The results
of these calculations are given in Figs. 1.9.4,
1.9.5, and 1.9.6 in which AT, . denotes the fuel
mean temperature rise through the core, and S
denotes the ratio of the power generation in the
fuel to the power generation in the moderator. The

studies must be undertaken before a reactor of this
type can be designed in detail. The spacing of the
moderator rods may cause flow instabilities in the
fuel that could result in serious peripheral temper-
ature asymmetries within both the rods and the
fuel. This tendency would be increased if various

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

combinations of rod sizes were used in a single
core configuration. Thus, a design analysis of a
particular reactor core would require a careful
study of the mass exchange (cross flow) between
adjacent flow passages for various rod sizes and
lattice arrangements.

Phase equilibrium studies of the system NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, and the associated binary systems were
completed.  The experimental techniques used
for the studies included thermal analysis by
cooling curves, differential thermal analysis,
visual inspection of samples held at known tem-
peratures, and examination of small samples
quenched after equilibration at known temperatures.

The phase equilibrium diagrams presented in

The invariant equilibria for the NaF-ZrF, system
are listed in Table 2.1.1 and the equilibrium
phase diagram is shown in Fig. 2.1.1. The formula
of the congruently melting compound 3NaF.ZrF,

material was found by microscopic examination
of slowly cooled preparations containing 25 mole %
ZrF4. The formulas of 5NoF-2ZrF4, QNGF-ZrF4:
7NcF-6ZrF4, and 3NaF-4ZrF, were established
by the observation that almost single-phase material
was found by microscopic and x-ray diffraction
examinations to be present in quenched samples,
with compositions very close to the formulas, which
were previously equilibrated below the solidus
temperature for sufficient time to achieve equilib-
rium. Chemical analysis of single-phase samples
mechanically separated from slowly cooled pre-
parations aided in establishing the formulas of
the last two compounds.

The range between 25 and 35 mole % ZrF, was
particularly difficult to study experimentally be-
cause the small variations in the compositions
of the compounds resulted in inconsistencies in
some of the quench data. Further complications
arose in the study of the solid solution regions
because of the existence of several modifications
of 5NaF-2ZrF, and 2NaF.ZrF,. A limited region
of solid solution of 3NaF-ZrF, above 25 mole %
ZrF , was indicated by variations in the refractive
index of the phase in slowly cooled and quenched
compositions. The exact limits of the region were
not determined. The incongruent melting tem-
perature (639°C) of a-SNaF-QZrF4 was determined
from quenching data for compositions containing
29 and 30 mole % ZrF,. Thermal analysis data
for compositions ranging from 27 to 32.5 mole %
ZrF, show a series of thermal effects near this
temperature.  The temperature of the inversion
a- to (3-5NaF-2ZrF, (525°C) was determined by
examinations of quenched samples of a composition
containing 29 mole % ZrF,. Quenched samples
of this composition contain both a-5NaF-2ZrF
solid solution and B-5NaF-2ZrF, in the tem-
perature interval 500 to 525°C and thus indicate
that the inversion temperature is lowered by solid
solution of a-5NaF-2ZrF,. No evidence has been
found for the existence of a range of solid solution
of B-5NaF+2Z:F ,.

The incongruent melting point of 3,-2NaF.ZrF ,,
the high-temperature modification, was established
at 544°C from an average of data obtained from

quenches of a series of compositions containing
30, 32, 33.3, and 35 mole % ZrF,. No samples
of this modification that were completely free
from material with the optical appearance of
quench growth were obtained for the composition
with 33.3 mole % ZrF ,, possibly because of small
composition variations. Temperatures of the
inversion f3,- to B,-2NaF.ZrF, (533°C) and the
inversion (,- to B,-2NaF.ZrF, (505°C) were
-determined from quenching results obtained with
samples containing 33.3 and 35 mole % ZrF,.
Small amounts of 3,-2NaF-ZrF , persist in quenched
samples previously heated for long periods of time
at temperatures below 533°C. This may be ex-
plained by assuming that the rate of inversion
of B,- to B3-2NaF.ZrF, is extremely slow. The
refractive index of 8,-2NaF.Z¢F, is low compared
with the refractive indices of the other modifi-
cations, and the material appears to be hygroscopic.

Another modification, y-2NaF.ZrF,, was observed
below about 460°C in previously equilibrated
quenched samples of compositions containing
about 33 mole % ZrF,. Its exact stability limits
have not been determined.

The liquidus and solidus relationships for com-
positions containing from 37 to 47 mole % ZrF,
were established with a fair degree of precision
by quenching, thermal analysis, and differential
thermal analysis.  The compound 3NaF.2ZrF,
decomposes at temperatures above 487°C into
2NaF.ZrF, and 7NaF.6ZrF, solid solution. The
formula and the decomposition temperature of
3NaF.2ZrF, were established by optical exami-
nations of previously equilibrated quenched samples
over the composition range 39 to 45 mole % ZrF .
When melts in this range are cooled, 3NaF.2ZrF,
or solid solution of the compound with 7NaF.6ZrF
is produced a few degrees below the solidus

temperature, presumably by a solid phase reaction.
A melt containing 41 mole % ZrF,, which was
cooled in the visual observation apparatus, appeared
to freeze completely just above 500°C. When the
sample cooled to a few degrees below this point,
efflorescence took place and there was a marked
volume increase. Microscopic examination showed
the preparation to be composed of a single phase
consisting of minute prismatic crystals with a very
low birefringence and a mean refractive index of
about 1.475.

There appears to exist at temperatures below
487°C a series of solid solutions between
3NaF.2ZrF, and 7NaF.6ZrF, with a small mis-
cibility gap for compositions containing between
about 43 and 45 mole % ZrF,. This was shown
by optical and x-ray diffraction examinations of
slowly cooled melts and optical examinations of
previously equilibrated quenched samples. Slowly
cooled melts of compositions that varied from

40 to 46.2 mole % ZrF, at about 1% intervals
were examined. At 40% ZrF, the sample is com-
posed of a single phase consisting of minute
elongated prisms with very low birefrigence (less
than 0.004) and a mean refractive index of 1.470.
With increasing ZrF, content the mean refractive
index increases regularly, as does the birefrin-
gence, to a limit of about 43 mole % ZrF,. The
existence of a small miscibility gap in the solid
solution series is evidenced by the observation
of two optically similar but distinguishable phases
in the preparation containing 44 mole % ZrF,.
One phase has a mean refractive index of about
1.485 and a markedly elongated prismatic habit,
and the other has a mean refractive index of
about 1.495 with a shorter prismatic habit and
a somewhat higher birefringence. At 45 and up
to 46.2 mole % ZrF , there is again a single phase
with regularly changing index and
birefringence.

A metastable compound having the formula
NaF.ZrF, is often produced when samples con-
taining 46 to 57 mole % ZrF, are quenched from
above the solidus temperature. It is usually
obtained when large samples are used and is
absent when very small samples are quenched
rapidly.

The System NaF-UF,

The phase diagram given in Fig. 2.1.2 and the
invariant equilibria listed in Table 2.1.2 for the
system NaF-UF , are based upon the data obtained
by application of all the experimental techniques
mentioned above.

The System UF ,-ZrF

The system UF ,-ZrF, consists of a continuous
series of solid solutions with a minimum melting

The System NaF-ZrF ,-UF,

The ternary phase diagram for the NaF-ZrF ;-UF
system is given in Fig. 2.1.4, and the invariant
points are listed in Table 2.1.3. The primary
phase field of the solid solution UF,-ZrF, covers
most of the region of the diagram occupied by
compositions containing less than 50 mole % NaF.
There are two solid solution series whose primary
phase fields dominate the remainder of the diagram.
One of these is the solid solution series between
the isomorphous compounds @-3NaF.UF, and
3NaF.ZrF,, as shown in Fig. 2.1.5. The fact
that this is a continuous series without a maximum
or a minimum was established by thermal analysis,
filtration, and quenching. The equilibrium relation-

thermal data the joins 3RbF:.BeF,-NaF and
2RbF.BeF ,-NaF are binary systems with eutectics
at about 50 mole % NaF (640°C) and at about 45
mole % NaF (650°C), respectively. The eutectic
temperature and the phases on the join2RbF.BeF ,-

of the ternary eutectics in the compatibility tri-
angles RbF-2RbF.BeF,-NaF and 3RbF.BeF,-
2RbF.BeF ,-NaF are not yet known with certainty.

Quenching data for samples in the triangle
2RbF.BeF ,-2NaF -BeF ,-NaF show that 2RbF-BeF ,-
2NaF .4RbF.3BeF ,-NaF is a compatibility triangle
with a peritectic located near 37 mole % NaF-30

2NaF.BeF ,-NaF is a compatibility triangle con-
taining a ternary eutectic near 51 mole % NaF-33
mole % BeF, at about 477°C. Thermal analysis
data for the join 2NaF.4RbF.3BeF,-2NaF.BeF,
located the binary peritectic near 33.3 mole %
NaF at 580°C and the binary eutectic at
about 50 mole % NaF at 480°C. The ternary
peritectic for the compatibility triangle 2RbF-BeF -
2NaF -4RbF.3BeF ,-RbF.BeF, has not been defi-
nitely located.

Two unidentified phases which may be ternary
compounds were observed in quenched samples
containing more than 45 mole % BeF,. Much
more quenching work is needed before a report
can be made on the phase relationships in this
part of the system.

PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN THE SYSTEMS
NaF-FeF2 AND NaF-NiF2

H. A. Friedman B. S. Landau

Structural metal corrosion products in fused
fluoride salt melts with high NaF concentrations
solidify as phases in the systems NaF-CrF,,
NaF-FeF,, and NaF-NiF,. In an effort to eluci-
date the corrosion process as it is related to
these products, studies of the phase equilibria
in these systems are being made. The results
of the still incomplete work for the systems NaF-
FeF, and NaF-NiF, indicate that the phase
diagrams for the systems are those shown in
Figs. 2.1.8 and 2.1.9.

Data for these diagrams were derived from
thermal analysis of slowly cooled melts and

128

from thermal-gradient quenching experiments.
The identification of phases was accomplished
by optical microscopy and x-ray diffraction exami-
nation.

No reliable values are known for the melting
temperatures of the three structural metal fluorides.
Brewer's values for the melting temperatures’ are
probably low; ORNL experiments indicate that his
reported value for the melting temperature of NiF,
(1027°C) is at least 200°C low.

The systems NaF-FeF, and NaF-NiF, contain
only the congruently melting 1:1 compounds,
NaF.FeF, and NaF:NiF,. The systems KF-NiF,'®
and LiF-NiF2” contrast with these in that in the
KF-NiF, system an incongruently melting com-
pound 2KF:NiF, exists in addition fo the congruent
1:1 compound and in the LiF-NiF, system only an
incongruent 3:1 compound, 3LiF-NiF2, occurs.

YTTRIUM FLUORIDE SYSTEMS
R. J. Sheil

Interest in the possibility of obtaining oxygen-
free yttrium metal by lithium reduction of purified
fluoride mixtures has prompted a preliminary study
of the YF,-MgF,, LiF-MgF,-YF,, YF,-ZnF,, and
LiF-ZnF ,-YF, systems in the visual-thermal appa-
ratus. '2 The MgF ,-containing systems are currently
considered to be more important than the ZnF,
systems because the technology of yttrium metal
recovery from yttrium-magnesium alloys is fairly
well established. However, zinc has been con-
sidered as an alloying metal in order to lower the
melting point of yttrium me\‘al,13 and, since the
alloying element must be removed by vacuum sub-
limation, the lower boiling point of zinc, as com-
pared with that of magnesium, would be advan-
tageous.  Lithium fluoride was added to binary
mixtures of YF, with MgF, and ZnF, calculated

order to lower the liquidus temperature to a level
that would permit removal of oxygen from the fused
mixture by the use of gaseous HF in readily avail-
able equipment. Since LiF is produced when such
mixtures are reduced with lithium, its presence in
the mixture prior to reduction should not cause
difficulty.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

The data obtained with one mixture in each of
the systems mentioned above are given in Table
2.1.5. The data show that liquidus and solidus
temperatures in the binary systems are too high
to permit purification in conventional equipment
but that the addition of a moderate amount of
lithium fluoride lowers the liquidus temperatures
to workable levels.

at 575°C was continued, and a plot of the experi-
mental equilibrium quotients vs the concentration
of nickel fluoride found in solution at 575°C is
presented in Fig. 2.2.1. Equilibrium was ap-
proached in some cases with increasing nickel
concentrations and in some cases with decreasing
nickel concentrations. |t may be observed that,
within the precision of the experiment (+10%), K,
is independent of the nickel fluoride concentration
studied (150 to 570 ppm) and that K can be ex-
trapolated to infinite dilution. Some data are to
be obtained at 600°C before the study of NiF, in

this solvent is concluded.

SOLUBILITY OF STRUCTURAL METAL
FLUORIDES IN Nc:F-ZrF4 (53-47 MOLE %)
AT 700°C

fluorides in this solvent at 700°C have now been
made to investigate the solubility of NiF, with
ditferent amounts of NiF, added and the effect on
the solubility of the individual fluorides when
mixtures containing CrF,, FeF,, and NiF, in the
ratio present in 18-8 stainless steels are added
to the solvent. In these tests the desired quantity
of structural metal fluoride was added to approxi-
mately 40 g of the NaF-ZrF, mixture contained in
a nickel charge bottle, and the system was equi-
librated for 5 hr at 700°C prior to filtration. The
results are given in Table 2.2.1.

It may be seen that the solubility of NiF, in
the absence of CrF, and FeF, is approximately
0.8 wt % expressed as Ni for a 1.0 wt % Ni addition
at 700°C. Comparable data are not given for CrF,
or FeF,, but it was found experimentally that
10 wt % of either Cr or Fe added as the fluoride
is soluble, within the limits of experimental error,
and it is assumed that smaller additions would
also show essentially complete dissolution. The
data indicate that although the solubility of each
of the structural metal fluorides is decreased by
the presence of the others the effect is most
marked in the case of NiF,. For example, for a
1 wt % Ni addition the solubility decreases from
0.8 to 0.3 wt % Ni when the equivalent of 9 wt % Fe
is present as fluoride. A comparable effect occurs
for a 4.5 wt % Fe addition. The ternary nickel
compound is known to be less stable than either
the iron or the chromium compound, and conse-
quently the solubility of the nickel compound
should be influenced to the greatest extent. The

last two tests reported in Table 2.2,1 were made
with structural metal fluoride concentrations which
are believed to be soluble. These concentrations
are relatively low and indicate that complete

REDUCTION OF FeF, BY Cr® IN NaF-ZrF
J. D. Redman
A study of the reaction

FeF, + Cr°<—“—\——CrF2 + Fe°

in chF-ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) at 600°C was made
in an attempt to determine the concentration equi-
librium constant (Kc) for this reaction. A value
of approximately 6 x 103 is obtained by calcu-
lating the constant from the values given for the
standard free energy of formation for CrF, and
FeF, at 600°C if ideal solution behavior for these
materials is assumed. Data presented previously?
for the reduction of UF, by Cr° and Fe® show,
however, that the behavior of these systems in
the NaF-ZrF, mixture is far from ideal. A calcu-
lation of the CrF,-to-FeF, ratio from the values

found for KC for the reaction

M + 2UF, == 2UF, + MF,

in the NaF-ZrF, mixture yields a value of approxi-
mately 50 compared with 6 x 103 for ideal behavior.
This value of 50 for the CrF,-to-FeF, ratio (or Kc),
if correct, is in a range that could possibly be
determined experimentally by using the filtration
technique.

A series of runs was made that yielded different
equilibrium chromium concentrations in an attempt
to establish whether a constant ratio of Cr** to
Fe'" occurs in the filtrates. Blanks were run in
which 2 g of iron wire was hydrogen-fired at
1000°C in a nickel charge bottle, approximately
40 g of the NaF-ZrF, mixture and 2 g of pure
chromium were added, and the system was equi-
librated at 600°C for 5 hr prior to filtration, Ex-
periments were then carried out that were similar
to the blank runs except for the addition of the
desired quantity of FeF,. Data obtained for the
blanks and for the runs in which FeF, was added
are given in Table 2.2.2,

The iron concentrations found in the blanks were
higher than anticipated, but, since they approxi-
mated those found in the NaF-ZrF, mixture used
as charge material, it appeared probable that the
high iron values resulted from finely divided
metallic iron rather than soluble divalent iron.
The equilibrium iron concentrations are too low,
even for the runs with the largest addition of FeF,,
to permit any accurate evaluation of an equilibrium
constant, |f it is assumed that the blank is due
to metallic iron, values ranging from 40 to 60 for
the Cr*t.to-Fe** ratio may be estimated for the
0.4 and 0.6 wt % additions of Fe™*. Additional
runs will be made with larger FeF, additions, but
the amount that may be added is limited by the
solubility of CrF,. A saturated solution of CrF,
in the NaF-ZrF, mixture does not contain CrF,
as the solid phase, but, rather, as a ternary
compound. The separation of this phase changes
the composition of the liquid phase, and as a
result it may be impossible to obtain constant
values for the Cr**-to-Fe** ratio for large ad-
ditions of FeF,. Similar experiments have been
run with RbF-ZrF4 (52-48 mole %) as the reaction

medium, but the results are not yet available.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

Calculations based on the Kc's for the reaction
of Cr° and Fe°® with UF4 indicate that a more
favorable ratio of Cr** to Fe*t should result in
this solvent than in the NaF-ZrF4 mixture.

REDUCTION OF UF, BY STRUCTURAL METALS

J. D. Redman

Preliminary results for the reduction of UF, by
Cr® at 600 and 800°C with RbF-ZrF , (52-48 mole %)
as the reaction medium were reported previously.?
Additional studies have been made of this system,
and preliminary data have been obtained for the
Fe®-UF, system in this reaction medium. A
comparison of iron and chromium values (and K_'s)
found in the various alkali fluoride~ZrF , binaries
studied to date has also been made.

Data for the reaction of UF , with Cr® at 600 and
800°C with RbF-ZrF, (52-48 mole %) as the
reaction medium are given in Table 2.2.3. Approxi-
mately 2 g of Cr® was reacted with UF, (8.9 wt %,

RbF-ZrF, mixture contained in nickel. Data are
presented in Table 2.2.4 for the reduction of UF,
by Fe® under conditions comparable to those for
the Cr%-UF, reaction.

The data given in Table 2.2.3 show that the
Cr°-UF, system has a small but significant
positive temperature coefficient in the temperature
range 600 to 800°C. The equilibrium chromium
concentrations measured in the RbF-ZrF, mixture
are lower than those found in any of the other
alkali fluoride-ZrF, binary mixtures used as re-
action media. A comparison of the chromium
concentrations and the equilibrium constants cal-
culated from these values may be made from the
data presented in Table 2.2.5 and the plot of
Fig. 2.2.2. !t may be seen that there is a decrease
in the chromium concentration (and Kc) as the
cation radius increases in the series Li*, Na®,
K* Rb*. These chromium concentrations probably
are fair measure of the relative activity of UF,

in these mixtures, although changes in the activity
of CrF, and, especially, of UF; are influential.
The data presented Table 2.2,4 for the
Fe“-UF, system are preliminary. It is evident,
however, that in the RbF-ZrF, medium this system
has a rather large negative temperature coefficient,
such as was noted in other alkali fluoride~ZrF,
mixtures.  This correlation in Table
2.2,6, where the equilibrium iron concentrations
(and Kc's) are given for various alkali fluoride~
ZrF, binary mixtures. The striking aspect of
these data is that the iron concentrations are
nearly constant in the various reaction media. The
data presented in Table 2.2.5 for the Cr°—UF4
system show the expected effect of change in
cation radius on the UF, activity, as measured
by the chromium concentrations, and a similar
effect was expected for the Fe®-UF, system. No
satisfactory explanation can be given to account
for this marked difference in behavior of Fe® and

Cre.

MEASUREMENTS OF SOLUBILITIES OF

NaF-ZrF ,-UF, MIXTURES

W. T. Ward

The investigation of the solubilities of fission-
product fluorides singly and in pairs in molten
NoF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) was continued.
The radiochemical tracer techniques described
previously? are being used for this study.

Solubility of BaF, in NaF-ZrF -UF,

An attempt was made to determine the solubility
of BaF, in NGF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) with
the use of Ba!33 Two additions of
BaF, were made, and the second addition brought
the concentration up to 26 wt % Ba. It was found
that the BaF, was completely soluble over the
560 to 850°C temperature range.

In order to determine whether the presence of
an appreciable quantity of CeF, would affect the
solubility of the BaF,, approximately 14 wt %
CeF; was added. Filtrates obtained over a temper-
ature range of 571 to 843°C again showed the BaF,
to be completely soluble.

However, at the conclusion of the BaF, solubility
experiment described above, it was noted that a
definite break in the cooling curve occurred at
420 to 425°C, while none was apparent at 520°C.
This was confirmed by remelting the mixture and
allowing it to cool a second time. A filtrate was
then obtained at 456°C, but attempts to obtain
another filtrate at about 440°C failed. Most of
the contents of the reactor appeared to solidify
at a temperature between 440 and 450°C. Again
the largest break in the cooling curve appeared
between 420 and 425°C.

The filtrate obtained at 456°C contained

22.1 wt % Ba (determined by counting) as compared
with 26.5 wt % Ba at 571°C.

Solubilities of CeF, and SmF, in NaF-ZrF,-UF,
Obtained by Using Two Radiotracers
Simultaneously

An experiment was completed to determine the
solubilities of mixed CeF, and SmF, in NaF-

ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) with CeF, containing

Ce'*! as a tracer and SmF containing Sm'93 as

a tracer. The difference in decay rates, 32.5 days
for Ce'4! aond 47 hr for Sm'33, was utilized in
calculating the concentrations of each in the
filtrates.

The solubility data obtained for mixed CeF, and
SmF, are shown in Table 2.2.7, along with the
solubility data for pure CeF, and for pure SmF .
obtained in previous experiments with the same
solvent. In order to check the accuracy of the
double-tracer determinations, five synthetic control
samples were made up that contained weighed
amounts of the labeled CeF, and SmF,. These
were counted and calculated along with the fil-
trates, and the results shown in Table 2.2.8 were
obtained. The CeF, accuracy in four of the five
controls was excellent, with an average error of
less than 1%. However, the SmF_ determinations

appear to be from 5 to 10% low.

Solubility of YF, in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,

One experiment to determine the solubility of
YF, in NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) with Y°!

as a tracer was completed. Filtrates were obtained

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

SmF, labeled with Sm'>3 was added to the YF,-
NaF-ZrF“-UF4 mixture described above, and another
set of filtrates was obtained. The concentrations
of both YF; and SmF, were then calculated by

at four temperatures over the 550 to 850°C range, utilizing the differences in decay rates. These
and the results are shown in Table 2.2.9. It may solubilities, along with .those of YF; and SmF,
be noted that the yttrium values for the two samples separately, are shown in Table 2.2.10.  Three

obtained above 800°C appear to be higher than the
amounts added to the reactor. The possibility that
the YF, somple used to standardize the counting
had picked up water and was actually the hemi-
hydrate (YF3']/2H20) may account for the high
values. A plot of the log of the solubility of
yttrium vs the reciprocal of the temperature appears
to give a straight line, which is not the case for
cerium, lanthanum, or samarium, as reported previ-
ously.? This system will be investigated further.

In order to determine the effect of the presence
of SmF; on the solubility of YF;, a quantity of

synthetic control samples containing weighed
amounts of the YF; and SmF, were counted and
calculated along with the filtrates as a means of
checking the accuracy of the results. The data

obtained are given in Table 2.2.11.

Solubility of CeF, in NaF-ZrF -UF,

The samples used in the solubility experiments
are, normally, equilibrated at constant temperature
for 1 hr before filtrates are obtained, but, occasion-
ally, the filtrates are obtained after equilibrating

overnight. In all cases the highest temperature

filtrate is obtained first and successive filtrates
are obtained at decreasing temperatures.

In order to determine whether a 1-hr equilibration
time is sufficient, another experiment was con-
ducted with labeled CeF, in NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-
46-4 mole %). For this experiment a set of filtrates
was obtained at four different ascending tempera-
tures after various equilibration times. A second
set of filtrates was then obtained at approximately
the same four temperatures in decreasing order
after the various equilibration times. The samples
were then treated with HF and H, at 600°C, and
two more filtrates were obtained. The data ob-

tained are presented in Table 2.2.12, and a plot
of the log of the solubility vs the reciprocal of
the temperature is shown in Fig, 2.2.3.

The daota indicate than an equilibration time of
1 hr is sufficient, at least for the CeF,; in NaF-
ZrF,-UF,(50-46-4 mole %). However, it should
be noted that the solubility seemed to drop slightly
with time and that the HF-H, treatment increased
it to the previously determined value, This suggests
the possibility that some oxide formation occurred
during the course of the experiment. A determi-
nation of the effect of the presence of oxygen on

The determination of the solubility of helium gas

study are summarized in Table 2.2.14 and are
Presenfed graphically in Figs. 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.

The results show that in this solvent the solubility
of helium follows Henry's law; the solubility in-
creases with and the
numerical values for the solubility are similar to
those obtained for the solubility of helium in NaF-
ZrF ,-UF (50-46-4 mole %). The values of Henry's
law constants previously obtained for helium in
the UF ,-bearing solvent were 2.0, 2.7, 4.1 x 10~7

The precision of the measurements discussed
here is believed to be considerably better than that
obtained in the first set of measurements. The
improvements appear to be due to mass spectro-
metric refinements. In order to determine the
degree of reproducibility of the results, the meas-
uvrements for the 600 and 700°C isotherms were
made in duplicate. It may be observed (Table
2.2.14) that the results appear to be reproducible
to within better than 5%. |f temperature uncertain-
ties and other variations are considered, however,
it may not be justified to assume an over-all
accuracy of better than +10% for the measurements
presented here.

A slight curvature in the temperature dependence
of the Henry's law constants may be observed in
Fig. 2.2.6. The curvature may be real, although a
straight line could be drawn if variations of £10%
were allowed. Determinations of the solubility of
argon and of xenon gases in NaF-ZrF, (53-47

Fig. 2.2.5. Solubility of Helium in Molten NaF-ZrF4.

The results show quite clearly that the solubility
of HF in this solvent follows Henry's law to within
the precision of the measurements. Furthermore,
it may be observed that the solubility of HF de-
creases with increasing temperature. This is in
contrast with the solubility of helium in the same
solvent (see preceding section of this chapter) and
of helium and xenon in the related solvent NaF-
ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %). The constancy of the
heat of solution, which is shown by the linearity of
the function plotted in Fig. 2.2.8, is also of interest.
From the slope of the line shown, a heat of solution
of —4500 cal/mole is obtained. The negative sign
indicates that the process of solution of HF in this
solvent is exothermic.

the solubility (Cd) of HF in 1 liter of melt is
8.6 x 10=% mole. The calculated concentration
of HF in the gas phase (cg), if ideal behavior is
assumed, is 12.2 x 10=3 mole per liter. The iso-
thermal processes and the accompanying thermo-
dynamic changes at 1000°%K may be evaluated as
follows:

AH = +4500; AS = +5.2 eu

It may be observed that the entropy of the dis-
solved HF is less than that of HF gas by approxi-
mately 5 units. This difference is probably due to
partial losses of rotational and translational entropy
of HF in solution.

J. H. Shaffer C. M. Blood

The extent of completion of a number of chemical
reactions involved in the purification of fluoride
mixtures'? is judged by the HF concentration in
the effluent gases. This procedure is very useful,
even though the results have only empirical sig-
nificance, since it is known, for example, that the
HF concentration in the effluent gas is a function
of, among other variables, the geometry of the

apparatus and of the volumetric gas flow rate.
Since rather precise values for the solubility of
HF in molten Nc:F'-ZrF4 are now available (see
preceding section this chapter), it is possible to
cotrelate the true solubility values with those that
are obtained from the determination of rates of
simple stripping of HF with helium from an HF-
saturated solvent. This procedure was previously”
used for the approximate determination of the solu-
bility of HF. It was realized that the values of the
solubility obtained by the stripping method could
only be expected to be within an order of magnitude
of the true values because of the nonequilibrium
conditions of the process.
lation

The results of a corre-
study are presented below to show the
relative approach to equilibrium of the stripping
process under typical experimental conditions.

The value of Henry's law constant was obtained
from stripping rate studies by considering the
following postulated, ideal model. A vessel con-
taining W kilograms of molten fluoride salt mixture
in equilibrium with pure gaseous HF was considered
as being maintained under isothermal conditions,
while an inert gas was being continuously introduced
in such a way that it bubbled through the melt and
mixed with the gas in the space above the melt.
The system was kept at constant total pressure by
the simultaneous withdrawal of the same volume of

The HF concentration in the effluent
stream was a function of the volume of stripping

system the following postulates were considered
to be valid:

to express (HF)’ in moles of HF per liter of gas,
(HF)d in moles of HF per kilogram of melt, and
K in kilograms of melt per liter of gas.

2. No concentration gradients exist in the liquid
or in the gas phases.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

3. The bubble path in the liquid is sufficiently
long so that equilibrium concentrations of HF in
the gas are attained before the bubbles leave the
liquid phase.

4. No side reactions exist which give off or
consume HF,

Under these conditions the numerical value of K
may be easily shown by a material balance to be
given by

where V,; . is the volume of the gas, measured at
melt temperature, required to reduce the concen-
tration of HF in the effluent by a factor of 2, and
Vo is the volume of the gas space above the melt.

In the actual system, several of the postulated
requirements are not followed and several qualifi-
cations must be introduced in attempting to correct
for nonideality. First the assumption that Henry's
law is followed over the range of concentrations
studied appears to be true, as indicated by the
direct measurements. It is known, however, that
the actual concentration of HF in the effluent gas
is considerably less than the equilibrium value.
The assumption was therefore made that the ratio
of the actual to the equilibrium concentration is a
function of the volumetric gas flow rate and the
geometry but is independent of concentration. Thus

further correction is needed. The necessary cor-
rections result in the following modification of

Eq. 5:

® K 0.693Wf
Vi = 0.698V, (T, /T)

 

where T is the temperature of the melt and Tg is
the temperature of the gas.

It is thought that no serious concentration gradi-
ents develop during the experiment because the
liquid is kept well-agitated by the continuous gas
sparging, and the volumetric flow rates used are
sufficiently high that it is probable that the gas
phase is well mixed.

Some side reactions apparently occur as the
stripping is extended to low HF concentrations.
These may be due primarily to desorption processes.
However, at high concentrations of HF the rate of
the side reactions is negligible compared with the
rate of the stripping. Accordingly plots of log
(HF)g vs V appear to be linear at the beginning
and to curve at lower concentrations. The half-

A comparison of these results with the corre-
sponding results obtained experimentally with a
considerably better approach to equilibrium should

may be observed that under the experimental con-
ditions used, the relative approach to equilibrium
of the simple stripping process varied from 17% at
600°C to 23% at 800°C.

No special significance, other than qualitative,
should be attached to the numerical values of a,
since a is a function of geometry, flow rate, vis-
cosity, bubble diameter, depth of immersion, etc.

where ay Yy and N, are activity, activity co-
efficient, and mole fraction of the solvent species
and T, is its melting point. From the melting
temperatures of dilute binary mixtures that contain
a common ion, that behave ideally in the molten
state, and that show no solid solubility, it should
be possible to calculate the heat of fusion of the
solvent species.

Keenan'® used such a procedure to establish the
heat of fusion of NH4N03; he used solute concen-
trations of 0 to 4 mole % with the nitrates of Li,
Na, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and Tl as solutes. Plots of
melting temperature vs mole fraction of solute
showed the same straight line when Na, Li, and
Ag nitrates were the solutes. Since it is unlikely
that identical solid solubility in NH,NO, is shown
by these materials, for which the cation radii vary
over a twofold range, this identity of the plot must
indicate freedom from solid solubility in these
systems. The extent of solid solubility apparently
increased with K, Rb, and Tl as the cation radii
approached the cation radius of NH,* and then
decreased for Cs, for which the cation radius is
appreciably larger than that of NH4+. Since it also
appeared to be unlikely that agreement of data
obtained with LiNO;, AgNO,, and NaNO,; was due

to identical or canceling nonideal behavior, Keenan

calculated a heat of fusion for NH,NO, by using
Eq. 9.

Accordingly, attempts have been made to use a
procedure similar to Keenan's to obtain freezing
point data from which heats of fusion of the alkali
fluorides can be calculated. The apparatus con-
sisted of a 2-in. vertical clam-shell furnace in
which a nickel block 10 in. long was centered to
serve as a heat sink. The block contained holes
so that a control thermocouple and sealed nickel
ampoules could be introduced from the top. A
platinum=10% rhodium thermocouple was inserted
through an additional opening in the bottom of the
block and into a well in the bottom of the ampoule.
Good thermal contact between the thermocouple
and the ampoule was assured by suspending the
ampoule so that its full weight rested on the thermo-
couple bead. Agitation of the melt was accomplished
by violently shaking a rod welded to the top of the
ampoule.

Since there is a calorimetrically determined heat
of fusion available'4 for LiF, it was decided to
use LiF as the solvent in the initial series of
experiments, with KF as the solute. Later, the
inverse system was studied. Potassium fluoride
was chosen for the initial experiments because the
ionic radius of the K* ion is nearly twice that of
Li*, and solid solubility of either fluoride in the
other should be negligibly small. In addition, melts
containing not more than 5 mole % of either com-
ponent dissolved in the other should exhibit nearly
ideal behavior. _

The LiF and KF were purified by hydrofluorination
and filtration. They were then ground in a dry box
to —100 mesh, and mixtures containing 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 mole % of LiF in KF and KF in LiF were
made. The actual compositions of these mixtures
were determined by weighing, on the analytical
balance, sample bottles containing the components
after each was added. The botties were finally
shaken vigorously to blend the components. Enough
of a mixture to give a melt level approximately
]/2 in. above the top of the thermocouple well was
introduced into each ampoule, and the ampoules
were evacuated, opened to dry helium (]/3 atm), and
then closed by arc welding.

The freezing points of the melts were obtained
from time-temperature cooling curves. The ampoule

was first heated until its temperature was 10°C
above the melting point of the solvent and then,
when temperature equilibration was established,
cooled at a rate of 0.2°C/min. The emf of the
thermocouple was taken every 2 min from a Leeds &
Northrup K-3 precision potentiometer which could
be easily read to 1 x 104 mv. These data were
then plotted, and the emf corresponding to the
freezing point was obtained from the graph by
extrapolation. The freezing points were reproducible
to 0.05°C.

Excellent freezing points were obtained by this
procedure except for the two mixtures containing
2 and 4 mole % LiF in KF, for which excessive
undercooling prevented a determination. These
mixtures were, therefore, rerun in ampoules modified
so that a few grains of the mixture could be intro-
duced into the ampoule at a temperature slightly
above the expected melting point. The desired
data were then obtained.

One additional difficulty appeared in the high-
LiF-content system. When the freezing points were
plotted against mole percentage of solute, the data
fell on a straight line which, however, when ex-
trapolated gave a freezing point for LiF that was
0.9°C higher than that measured experimentally for
the hydrofluorinated material. To resolve this
problem, a sample of optical-grade single-crystal
LiF, made by Harshaw Chemical, was obtained and
its melting point determined. The melting point of
the optical-grade material was found to be 0.3°C
above the extrapolated value, and therefore the LiF
used to make up the mixtures must have contained
a small amount of solute impurity. Since a reliable
value for the heat of fusion was available, Eq. 9
was used to calculate a correction factor to take
into account the impurity content, and the compo-
sitions of the mixtures were then corrected corre-
spondingly. When this was done, the data fell into
line and a heat of fusion could be calculated for
LiF. A similar calculation was carried out for KF,

The data are shown in Fig. 2.2.9.

Heats of fusion could be calculated from these
data by using the method of least squares, since
Eq. 9 was derived on the assumption that AH, does
not vary with temperature, that is, ACP (fusion) = 0.
The data for the highest concentration of KF in
LiF were omitted when making the calculation
because the point deviated slightly from the plotted
line. The heat of fusion for LiF obtained on this
basis was 6240 cal, which is 3.5% lower than the

value of 6470 cal obtained calorimetrically at the
Bureau of Standards. The deviation from the Bureau
of Standards’ value cannot be explained on the
basis of solid solubility, since solid solution leads
to smaller decreases in the freezing point and,
consequently, higher heats of fusion as calculated
by Eq. 9.

No data were omitted in the calculations of the
heat of fusion of KF, which was found to be 6120
cal. The best available comparison values are

the LiF-in-KF system in this concentration range
is, therefore, also ruled out.

Additional tests will be made with solutes such
as BaF2 in LiF and potassium iodide in KF to de-
termine whether these heats of fusion can be repro-
duced in other systems where solid solubility is
also unlikely. The system KCL in KF will also be
tested in order to compare the heat of fusion so ob-
tained with that found by Plato. The higher value
calculated by Kelley can be explained if it is found
that some solid solution occurs in this system.

mole %) contained in iron and nickel crucibles,
respectively, were continued.'® A helium atmos-
phere was employed throughout the experiments,
and electrical conductivity between the two half-
cells was provided by ZrO, bridges preimpregnated
with the solvent. The data obtained with these
cells at 650°C were corrected for the thermoelectric
potential, and the emf’s of the liquid junctions
were neglected. The results based on the pure
solid as the reference state are presented in
Table 2.2.18.

When combined with the values obtained previ-
ously,'® the results give an average activity
coefficient ratio for yNin/yFeF of 600 for the

NaF-ZrF, solvent and 200 for the KF-LiF solvent.
Thus thermodynamic differences between NiF, and
FeF, are minimized in the more basic solvent. An
explanation of this behavior on the basis of a
leveling of amphoteric salts by strong bases was
ventured previously, but the hypothesis must be
incorrect because Fe and Ni species should exist
in acid solutions primarily as ‘‘free’’ metal ions

(Fe** and Ni**) and the stable species in basic
solutions should be mainly metal ion complexes
such as:

Ni++

+ 4F7 = NiF,~~
Fe*t + 4F~ = FeF,~~

Accordingly, NiF, and FeF, should have equal
activities in dilute acid solutions but not in basic
melts where the activities would depend directly
on the magnitude of the dissociation constants of
the complex ions. The experimental results may
be explained by assuming that the free-energy
values for NiF2 (s) or FeF2 (s) or both are erroneous
and that the change resulting from the complexing
considered above is in the direction opposite from
that resulting from errors in free-energy values.
The cell potentials, in agreement with the previ-
ous data, changed slowly with time; the values
usually decreased, and in virtually no case was
agreement to within 5 mv found after one day. An
attempt was made to improve the stability of the
cell solutions by increasing their volumes. Wider
vessels were tried first, with one sitting in the
other and insulated from it by a quartz liner. The
quartz was not exposed directly to any melt - it
merely separated the nickel cup from the iron cup.
The nickel crucible contained the NiF, solution,
and this, along with the quartz insulator and the
iron crucible, sat in a still larger iron cup which
contained the FeF, melt. A ZrO, bridge again
served to complete the electrical circuit. Several
measurements with this type of setup yielded
implausible emf’s. These were usually too low
and may have been caused by some of the melt
creeping up the crucible walls and short-circuiting

the cell. In another attempt to improve the stability
of the cell solutions the quartz is to be replaced
by a morganite dish.

A second method of increasing the cell volumes
would be to employ deeper crucibles. This would
have the added advantage of not exposing more
melt surface to the impurities in the atmosphere.
Measurements made with deeper cups gave emf’s
that were in excellent agreement with the previous
measurements, but the lifetimes of the cells were
not increased. In most cases constancy and repro-
ducibility were attained from one day to the next
if the cells were allowed to solidify overnight and
were then remelted the next morning. Stirring
decreased the time required to attain equilibrium.
However, solidification and remelting increased
the tendency toward bridge rupture and deterioration.

Another possible cause of cell deterioration is
the diffusion between half-cells.
minimize this, some ZrO, bridges were deliberately
broken and then placed in the half-cells in contact.
The emf's measured were low and, at times, even
opposite in sign. At present it is difficult to
ascertain the chief cause for poor cell stability.
Changes of the salt solution concentrations and
deterioration of the bridge and of the electrodes
are the probable contributing factors.

EMF Measurements in the LiCl-AgCI-ThCl, System
A study of the system LiCl-AgCl-ThCl, is being

planned in order to better comprehend and resolve
the effects of solvents of varying acidity on the
activity of a solute. The activity of a dilute AgCl
melt of approximately constant concentration will
be measured as a function of the ThCI, composition.
This system is fairly analogous chemically to the
fluoride fuel melts and, in addition, has the features
of low liquidus temperature (below 700°C) and vapor
pressure (less than 2 mm Hg at 700°C) over a large
composition range. The absolute activity or activity
coefficient of the solute, AgCl, can be determined
directly from cells of the type

AglAGCl (), LiCl (x,), ThCl, (x,)|Cl,

where x, is small (2 to 5 mole %). This is im-
possible to do electrochemically in fluorides be-
cause of the present unavailability of a reversible
fluorine electrode.

Graphite tubes cleaned by heating for several
hours at 1000°C in an atmosphere of chlorine dried

by concentrated H,50, will serve as the chlorine

150

electrodes. The LiCl to be used will be dehydrated
by heating it under vacuum at slowly increasing
temperatures up to 600°C. It will then be purified
by being melted and allowed to solidify in a dry
HCl atmosphere. When LiCl is treated in this
manner, a black coating forms on some of the out-
side surface. The black coating is apparently
carbon, which has a low solubility in the molten
salt. The dark areas of the salt are discarded. A
low pH of 4.5 is obtained when the salt is dissolved
in distilled water, and it thus appears that some
HCl is retained in the salt. Another sample of
LiCl was treated similarly, but while it was molten
it was purged with argon to remove the HCI.

The ThCl, to be used was obtained from the
National Lead Co., and it will be purified by
sublimation. Early attempts to sublime some ThCl,
from an unknown source resulted in failure because
of extensive hydrolysis. All handling of LiCl and
ThCl, will be done in a dry box, and all the cell
solutions will be made up by weight and will be
sampled while molten so that the concentrations
can be checked analytically.

In order to investigate the possibility of LiCl
reacting with silver metal at low AgCl activities, !’
some treated LiCl was put in a precleaned silver
crucible in a closed system, held under vacuum ot
300°C overnight, covered with argon, and allowed
to stand at 750°C for ten days. (It was noted that
the shiny silver vessels heated to 650°C in vacuum
acquired a grayish-brown deposit on the inside
walls in a short time. When reheated in air or in
concentrated HCl, the discoloration disappeared.
The grayish-brown deposit may have been due to a
film of finely divided deposited silver. The quartz
envelope around the vessel received a silver-
mirror deposit.)

When the crucible was removed and inspected at
the end of the ten-day period, it was obvious that
extensive reaction or mass transfer of silver had
occurred. The bottom of the silver vessel had been
corroded through in several places, and a crystalline
sponge of metallic silver had grown where the melt-
gas interface had been. In addition, all the surfaces
of the silver cup were etched, probably by the
volatile LiCl. It was not definitely established,
however, whether the silver reacted with the LiCl,
because the attack of the crucible may have been
the result of mass transfer.

The emf cells for studies of the chloride system
are made of fused silica, and they contain three
arms. Two arms are the electrode compartments,
and the other arm is the gas exit line, which also
provides access for sampling the melt. The silver
electrode is enclosed in a tight-fitting quartz tube
ond is silver-soldered to a tungsten lead. The
chlorine-graphite electrode is connected to tungsten
by means of a platinum wire wound tightly around
the graphite. Thermoelectric potentials between
silver and graphite were measured.

These cells contain a fairly large volume of
solution, and the mere passage of chlorine over the
melt may not be sufficient to saturate it during a
reasonable time. The melt must, of course, be
saturated if the chlorine electrode is to be used as
a reference. In an experimental cell chlorine was
first passed over the melt and then through it. The
emf's obtained by both procedures were approxi-
mately the same after a short time. This experi-
ment must be repeated because some of the melt
was forced up into the silver electrode arm and
solidified there.

ELECTROMIGRATION IN MOLTEN SALTS
M. B. Panish

The separation of Ni ** from Li* by electromigration
in fused LiCI-NiCl, was described previously.20
The intenss blue color of NiCl, in chloride melts
made it possible to follow visually the movement
of the boundary toward the anode. Further determi-
nations of the migration of nickel were made by
adding small amounts (25 to 50 mg) of NiCl, to the
cathode compartment while current was flowing.
Most of the Ni** thus introduced was reduced to
metal at the cathode, but some went into the
packing and could then be followed visually, as
before. These recent data on the rate of movement
of the boundary agreed, within experimental error,
with the data previously reported?® in which the
value for the relative rate of Ni** with respect to
Li* was incorrectly reported. By the use of UcCl,,
which shows a deep red color in LiCl solution, a
similar determination of the migration rate has
been made for LiCl.

Since electromigration has been considered as a
method of separating lithium in a spent fuel from
fission-product poisons, of which the rare earths

are the most important, measurements were also
made with a rare-earth chloride in lithium chloride.
None of the rare earths form deeply colored solu-
tions in LiCl, and, since they are all very similar
in most physical properties, radioactive cerium was
chosen for study. The cerium was introduced to the
cathode compartment by adding samples of LiCl
which contained about 1 mc of Ce'4' in about 1 mg
of carrier, CeCl;. The concentration of CeCI3
which descended into the packing was about
10=3 in mole fraction.

The position of the radioactive cerium was fol-
lowed with a scintillation counter which had a
sodium iodide crystal inside a slotted lead cap.
To prevent interference from radiation at an angle,
a collimator was used that consisted of a composite
of lead and stainless steel 3/4 in. wide and 4 in.
deep, with horizontal slots ¥ x ]/1 in. and vertical
spacing of 1/2 in. between the slots. The two halves
of the furnace were separated enough to permit the
collimator to be in line with the column of molten
salt, and the counter crystal was mounted so that
it could be aligned at will with any slot in the
collimator.  For a reading, the alignment of the
counter before a given slot which gave the maximum
counting rate was found, and the change of this
maximum reading with time was measured. The
rate of travel of the cerium through the lithium
chloride was thus determined with fair precision.
Two experiments were carried out with this appa-
ratus, and rates of travel of 17 and 13.5 mm/hr
were obtained.

The determinations would have been much simpler
to make if the collimator had contained only one
slot and had been attached to the crystal so that
they traveled as a unit. A traveling mechanism that
could be accurately positioned and could carry a
very heavy load would be required for such an
installation.

The migration rates of Ni**, U***, and Ce™** in
molten LiCl were measured in the temperature
interval 675 to 725°C. With a 100°C difference in
temperature the results for a particular ion were
the same, within experimental error. The rates
given in Table 2.2.19 are for a current of 0.5 amp
in an 8-mm-ID tube packed uniformly with 30-50
mesh crushed fused silica, which gave about
0.25 cm® of salt per centimeter of height. In all
cases the boundary moved toward the anode.

Under the constraints of the experimental con-
ditions, the lithium actually does not move, and

the chloride moves toward the anode at a rate of
22 mm/hr. If it were experimentally feasible to
use lithium electrodes, the chloride would not
move, and the movement of the added ion could
be expressed equally well relative to the lithium
ion or the chloride ion. The low relative mobility
of the Ni** is evidence of complexing by the
chloride.

It may be noted that any of these ions can be
separated from lithium quite effectively in a fused
chloride melt, but, for separation from a fused
fluoride melt, the practical difficulties of finding
a suitable insulating vessel and suitable electrodes
moke the process appear to be rather unattractive.

ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS OF UF, AND UF3
IN FUEL MIXTURES

M. Blander

The ratio of cation charge to ion radius (Z/R)
has been suggested as a measure of the relative
acidity of fluoride melts?2'=23 and as a basis for
correlating negative deviations from ideality in
fuel mixtures in order to predict corrosion behavior.
‘In the Z/R term, Z designates the valence of a
cation, and R is the distance between the cation
and an adjacent fluoride ion,

Thus Z/R is a measure of the coulombic energy of
attraction between neighboring ions in a fluoride
melt. The important correlating principle is that
the greater the difference in Z/R, or acid character,
between constituents of a melt, the more pronounced
are the negative deviations.

As an example of an approximate correlation
based on this principle, a method of estimating the
activity coefficients of UF, and UF; in fuel
mixtures has been derived. These individual
quantities have not been measured because of
experimental difficulties. The NaF-ZrF, system
was taken as a typical solvent for this study. The
activity coefficient of ZrF4, y’, based on super-
cooled liquid ZrF, as the standard state, is given
in Fig. 2.2.10, as a function of the difference,
A(Z/R), between Z/R for ZrF4 and the average
Z/R for N(:;F-ZrF4 mixtures.

The assumption is made that )’L’JF4 and }’L’JF3
will change with A(Z/R) in the same way asy; ( .
4

This is probably a very good approximation for
UF, (Z/R = 1.68), since its Z/R value is close
to that of ZrF4 (Z/R = 1.82), but it is less valid
for UF3 (Zz/R = 1.21).

The values of y” given in Fig. 2.2.10 were taken
from Fig. 2.3.1 (Chap. 2.3, this report) and replotted
as functions of A(Z/R). The value of (Z/R)soln
for binary mixtures is approximated by assuming a
linear variation with mole fraction between the
values for the pure constituents. Since Z/R is 0.43
for NaF, the values of (Z/R) oy, for NaF-ZrF,
mixtures are related to the mole fraction of ZrF4,

The NaF-rich region, which exhibits a rapid change
of yig. /vjg with solvent composition, has too
3 4

high a melting point for use as a fuel.

The activity coefficients for UF, and UF, shown
in Fig. 2.2.11 are probably as reliable as the data
on yirF“ as a function of composition. The major

source of uncertainty is thought to arise not from
the assumptions used in the approximation, but
rather from difficulties in extrapolating the vapor
pressure data to provide values for yérF4' For

simplification, the effect of temperature between

600 and 900°C on y;

sition was neglected, that is, averaged values which
apply best at 750°C were used (see Chap. 2.3, this
report). The probable error is thought to be about
120%.

In order to relate the activity coefficients to the
available free-energy data, they must be converted
to the pure solid reference state. To get the
conversion factors for changing standard states, a
comparison must be made in a solution for which
the activity coefficients based on the solid as the
standard state are known. Such compositions are
found along the portion of the liquidus in the NaF-
UF, system and NoF-UF, system corresponding to
the precipisation. of pure UF, and UF,. The con-
version factors depend only on the standard states
and are functions of temperature. They are inde-
pendent of the melt composition and hence can be
used with any fuel mixture. The NaF-UF, diagram?4
and the NaF-UF, diagram?3 furnished the data in

as a function of compo-

the first three columns of Tables 2.2.20 and 2.2.21.
Activity coefficients based on the solid were found
from
a 1

where a refers to activity and X to mole fraction,
since @ = 1 in a melt in equilibrium with the solid.

The activity coefficients, based on pure super-
cooled liquid, as shown in column 4 of Tables
2.2.20 and 2.2.21 can be estimated by the Z/R
correlation, and are required for comparison with
the values based on solid reference states. The
estimate is again based on the known activity
coefficients for ZrF, in NaF-ZrF, mixtures in
which the determining quantity, A(Z/R), is related
to the mole fraction of ZrF, by the expression

OXIDATION OF MIXTURES COMPOSED OF
SODIUM AND POTASSIUM

E. E. Ketchen

Studies of the oxidation of sodium and potassium
mixtures under carefully controlled conditions have
been initiated in an attempt to determine the effect
of certain variables on the final composition of the
mixed oxides. The variables under consideration
are (1) the original composition of the sodium-
potassium mixture, (2) the temperature of oxidation,
and (3) the temperature and time of equilibration
following the oxidation.

A glass capsule 6 in. long and 1 in. in diameter,
with a sintered glass disk installed midway in the
capsule, a thermocouple well, and connections for
pressure and vacuum lines, was used for the
experiments, which were performed at temperatures
of 25 to 30°C. For runs made at higher tempera-
tures, a similar piece of equipment was used that
was constructed of nickel and included a sintered-
nickel filter disk. All the runs thus far were made
with a sodium-potassium mixture containing 50.4
wt % Na and 49.6 wt % K.

In a typical run, approximately 3 to 4 g of the
sodium-potassium mixture was loaded into the
capsule in a vacuum dry box. The loaded capsule
was connected to a vacuum system and evacuated,
and dry air was bled into the capsule until a
pressure of 2 cm Hg was obtained. The capsule
was then shaken for about 1 min, and the system
was again evacuated and pressurized with dry air.
This cycle was repeated 5 to 10 times, ond then
the capsule was filled with helium to a pressure

slightly above 1 atm and either filtered immediately
or equilibrated prior to filtration. In order to
accomplish the filtration the capsule was inverted
and pressure was applied to one end and vacuum
to the other. The capsule was then placed in the
vacuum dry box, and mercury was introduced into
the end containing the oxides and residual liquid
metal. The mercury was poured into a separatory
funnel, and additional portions of mercury were
used in a similar manner until all the liquid metal
was amalgamated. A separation of the mercury
from the bulk of the oxides was effected in the
separatory funnel, and the oxides were submitted
to analysts for @ determination of sodium and
potassium.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

The results obtained for the room-temperature
oxidation, as reported in Table 2.2.23, are precise
and show that the sodium-to-potassium ratio in the
mixed oxides is large. The values found for the
ratio following oxidation at 200°C, with no equili-
bration, appear to approximate those found for the
room-temperature oxidation, but they are not precise
enough to warrant any further evaluation. The data
obtained from the runs in which the mixture was
equilibrated at 400°C appear to be significantly
different from those obtained at lower temperatures.
The values are not precise, however, and additional
data will have to be obtained to make certain that
some unknown factor is not responsible for this
behavior.

ESTIMATED VAPOR PRESSURES OF FUEL
MIXTURES

S. Cantor

Vapor pressures have been measured over a suffi-
cient variety of molten fluoride mixtures to provide
a basis for estimating vapor pressures for a number
of unmeasured compositions. A compilation of

estimated values for ZrF ,-base fuels is given in

Table 2.3.1.

Since the temperature dependence for activities
is much smaller than for vapor pressures, the vapor
pressure data were converted to activities for con-
venience in making the estimates. Where no in-
formation was available, it was assumed that the

relative activities of ZrF4 and of UI:4 did not

vary with temperature. The activities of ZrF,
were assumed fo be linear functions of composition,
in mole fraction, over the appropriate extrapolation
or interpolation range at each temperature. Finally
the activities were reconverted to vapor pressures.
The results given in Table 2.3.1 are thought to be
valid to within +50%.

The vapor pressures of fuels composed of UF,
and alkali fluorides only are too small to measure
by the methods which have been used in this labo-
ratory. However, for these mixtures a maximum
upper limit can be easily calculated by assuming
that the alkali fluorides follow Raoult’s law and
that the UF, follows Henry’s law, with an activity
coefficient of 0.1 based on the solid as the standard
state.  Maximum upper limits estimated in this

APPROXIMATE ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS OF
ZrF , IN THE NaF-ZrF SYSTEM IN THE
TEMPERATURE RANGE 600 TO 900°C

S. Cantor

Activities for ZrF4, as calculated from vapor
pressure measurements on the NaF-ZrF, system
by a number of investigators in this laboratory,
were recently reported in tabular form,! and, since
there is frequent need for ZrF, activities in the
temperature range of fuel interest, this information

has been reassembled in a convenient graphical
form,

The previously tabulated data were obtained di-
rectly from log P vs 1/T relations and extrapolated
linearly where necessary. All the values below
800°C were extrapolated, and, for compositions
containing less than 46.4 mole % ZrF , the values
below 900°C were extrapolated. As a result of the
uncertainty in the extrapolations and of a change
in sign of the heat of, solution with change in
composition, smoothed curves at each temperature
involved arbitrary choices.

The simplest method of graphically summarizing
the change in activity of ZrF, with composition
was to plot all the values, as in Fig. 2.3.1, and
then to draw a smooth curve through the average
for all temperatures at each composition, In this
way an average curve for 750°C was obtained.

Although corrections for the effect of temperature,
which changes sign in the vicinity of 62 mole %
ZrF 4, can be made if desired, for most purposes
the 750°C curve can be used for approximating the
values between 600 and 900°C,

A further approximation is involved in that the
total vapor pressure is considered to equal the
ZrF, pressure, that is, compound formation in
the vapor phase was neglected. For the composi-
tion range covered, the effect due to the approxi-
mation of the total vapor pressure is negligible in
comparison with the probable error. The super-
cooled pure liquid ZrF, assumed as the standard
state had calculated vapor pressures of 3.18, 28.9,
and 173.6 mm of Hg at 600, 700, and 800°C, re-
spectively.

DENSITY OF UF,
S. Langer

An investigation of the density of molfen UF, is
under way.? Further runs were made with the use
of graphite pycnometers in an attempt to improve
both the accuracy and precision of the value for
the density of liquid UF, reported previously
(6.80 * 0.09 g/cm3). The values obtained were
slightly lower than the previous value, but, since
the ddta are not yet complete, a final summary of
the data will be presented in the next report in
this series. |

ORNL-2274, p 129,
It was stated previously that qualitative observa-
tions of the salt surface in the pycnometers indi-
cated that UF , either contracts or has a very small
expansion upon melting. Experiments designed to
obtain quantitative information on the volume
change upon melting were therefore carried out.
The melting point of UF , is 1035°C, and therefore
the density obtained at 1050°C should yield a close
approximation to the volume of the liquid at the
melting point. The volume of the solid at the
melting point can be obtained from the room-
temperature density? (6.63 g/cm3) and the linear
coefficient of thermal expansion, which was
measured recently. The calculation from these
data of the molar volume of the solid at the melting
point will involve three assumptions: (1) that the
linear coefficient of thermal expansion from 900
to 1035°C follows the extrapolation of the curve
obtained between room temperature and 900°C;
(2) that the volume coefficient of thermal expansion
is equal to three times the linear coefficient;
(3) that either the expansion of solid UF, is iso-
tropic or that random orientation was obtained in
casting the samples,

The linear coefficient of thermal expansion was
measured by using the dial-gage dilatometer® shown
in Fig. 2.3.2. The supporting push rods are single-
crystal centerless-ground synthetic sapphire and
the base plate is alumina. The dilatometer was
calibrated by using standard 1-in. sapphire and
fused-silica samples. The experimental equipment
used in conjunction with the dilatometer is shown
in Fig. 2.3.3. Samples 1 in. long and 3/8 in, in
diameter were prepared by melting UF, in graphite
crucibles. Dial-gage readings were taken every
5 min while the heating rate was maintained at
between 2 and 3°C/min by adjustment of the power
input to the furnace. The dial gage was estimated
to l/]0 of the smallest scale division. The esti-
mated reading error was 2 x 10-3 in.

The rough experimental data were smoothed by
obtaining the least squares of the difference be-
tween the observed expansion curve and the
straight line through the end points. The expansion
curve obtained agreed with preliminary data ob-
tained previously, The curve representing the
smoothed data is presented in Fig. 2.3.4, The
equation of the curve is:

volume of the liquid at this temperature is 46.19

melting is therefore 1.57 c¢cm®/mole or 3.3%. It
should be emphasized, however, that these are

LiF was dried at 225°C under flowing helium and
then hydrofluorinated at 650°C for 6 hr. The
MgF , was purified in a similar manner, except that
the hydrofluorination temperature was 700°C,

A second batch of the YF ;-MgF ,-LiF mixture
was given the standard hydrogen—hydrogen fluoride
treatment, For this preparation, hydrofluorinated
YF; was used, but the LiF and MgF, used as
charge material had received no treatment other
than drying of the MgF,. The processed mixture
was unloaded from the receiver, crushed, and
loaded into the Metallurgy Division's charging
vessel, The effect of the difference in handling
of the fluoride mixtures is not yet known.

Preparation of Other Materials

Approximately 1000 g of LaF; was prepared from
La,0, by the wet process described above for
YF,, except that the product did not receive the
final hydrofluorination,

Additional CrF, was prepared by treating anhy-
drous CrCl, with HF at 710°C and briefly with

164

hydrogen. Ferrous fluoride was prepared by hydro-
fluorination of FeCl,:4H,0 at 400°C and also by
the hydrofluorination of ferrous oxalate at 600°C,
Several batches of NiF, were prepared by hydro-
fluorination of hydrated NiCl, at 400°C. One
batch of CoF, was prepared under similar condi-
tions by using CoCl,:6H,0 as the starting ma-
terial.

Some 50 g of Li’F-NaF-KF (46.5-11.5-42 mole %)
was prepared by using LiéCO3, as the source of
Li’.  The starting mixture, which consisted of
NaF, KF, and Li}CO,, was treated with NH F.HF
and then subjected to hydrogen and hydrogen
fluoride treatments at 800°C to remove the sulfur.

PILOT-SCALE PURIFICATION OPERATIONS
C. R. Croft J. Truitt

The pilot-scale purification facilities were used
for the processing of 44 batches totaling approxi-
mately 650 kg of various fluoride compositions for
use in small-scale corrosion testing, phase equi-
librium studies, and physical property studies. The
processing of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5
mole %) comprised the bulk of this production.

Ten pounds of HfCl, (low zirconium) was re-
ceived for conversion into HfF,. The small ex-
perimental unit used for preliminary studies of
the design of the present large-scale ZrCl, con-
version unit was used successfully for the prepara-
tion oftwo 3-lb batches of HEF . As in the ZrCl,
conversion process, considerable dusting occurred
during the conversion of the HECl, to HEF .
Plugging of lines and valves was very common.
However, since this was small-scale equipment,
yields of 90% were attainable, The small-size gas
lines, although easily plugged, did not allow bulk
losses in the same sense that the large-scale unit
does. Chemical analysis of the first batch showed
a chloride content of 0.3%. Complete chemical
analyses are not yet available, Because of the
particle size attrition that occurs during processing,
petrographic analysis was very inconclusive.
Samples of HfF, are being sintered for more
reliable examination,
PRODUCTION-SCALE OPERATIONS
J. E. Eorgan

A total of 14 days downtime was accumulated for
one half the processing equipment during the
quarter, but the rate of production fell only slightly
short of that desired. The downtime was due to
the burnout of one reactor furnace and one receiver
furnace. The reactor furnace failure was probably
due to the overheating cycles which resulted in
reactor can failures during the previous quarter,
The receiver furnace failure can probably be
attributed to age, since this was the first receiver
turnace failure in about three years. Both furnaces
were replaced.

During the quarter the available supply of storage
cans was exhausted, and cans were being fabri-
cated at a rate too slow to maintain economical
production in the facility. As a result, the facility
was shut down for a period of about three weeks to
allow a reasonable accumulation of storage cans.,
During this shutdown period the ZrCl, conversion
unit was put into operation on a continuous basis
in order to convert some 2000 Ib of low-hafnium
ZtCl, to ZrF,. Since a period of some two years
may elapse before this low-hafnium ZrF, will be
needed, it was deemed advisable to convert the
highly unstable ZrCl, to the more stable fluoride
form. At the conclusion of the ZrCl ,-conversion
process, the main production facility was again
activated, and all available storage cans were
filled with standard fluoride compositions.

By the end of the quarter, sufficient quantities
of the various fluoride mixtures had been accumu-
lated to meet estimated fiscal year 1958 require-
ments.  This production facility was therefore
shut down and put in standby condition. About
18,000 ib of the various materials is now stored.

Approximately 26,000 Ib of NaF.ZrF, was re-
ceived on a current 30,000-1b order from Kawecki
Chemical Company; the remaining 4000 Ib is
scheduled to be shipped soon. The quality of the
NaF.ZrF, supplied by Kawecki has been excellent
and has been an important contributing factor to
the efficiency of the production facility. It is
presently estimated that when all the storage con-
tainers now being fabricated have been filled,
there will be a surplus of about 5000 Ib of NaF-ZrF
available for the production of nonstandard compo-
sitions during fiscal 1958 or as a backlog of raw
material for the production facility whenever it is
reactivated.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

Two copper-lined stainless steel reactor vessels
were retired during the quarter because excessive
accumulation of impurities from processed batches
had increased the processing time to beyond the
economical limit and the rather rigid production
schedule set for this operation. These reactors
had processed 41 and 43 batches, respectively,
and had not shown mechanical failure of any kind.
These reactors will be made reusable by installa-
tion of new copper liners; the liners and necessary
repairs should cost about one-fourth the original
fabrication cost. The initial cost of this type of
reactor is about twice that of a nickel reactor, but
the usable lifetime is longer by a factor of 6. It
is apparent that the installation of copper-lined
stainless steel reactors to replace nickel reactors
has made a very great improvement in the economical
operation of this facility.

DETECTION OF TRACES OF NaK IN AIR
A. S. Meyer, Jr, J. P. Young

Several refinements were made in the instrument
designed for detecting submicrogram quantities of
NaK in air. The sodium in the NaK is detected by
the measurement of the absorbance of sodium
resonance by the sodium atoms. A description of
the instrument was given previously.' A chopper
with fixed and rotating polaroid disks was designed
and fabricated to replace the mechanical chopper
used previously for obtaining the desired 90-cps
pulsed light path. The polaroid chopper simplifies
the problems of alignment and balance of the
optical components of the system.

The tuned amplifier was also modified in order
to provide greater discrimination against fre-
quencies other than 90 cps. With the modified
instrumentation it is possible to detect concen-
trations of sodium in air of approximately 60 ppb
when the sample and reference cell are maintained
at temperatures in the range of 800 to 1000°C, It
therefore appears to be feasible to use this type of
instrument in the ART system for the detection of
radiator leaks. Design criteria for a working in-
strument are therefore being considered.

The optical system for the ART instrument
should be of unified construction to improve the
stability of the system and to further reduce the
problems of alignment and balancing of the instru-
ment, since it will have to be aligned and balanced
remotely with the use of servomechanisms. An
‘‘electrodeless’’ sodium lamp that is excited by
radiofrequency should be used as a light source in
order to extend the life of the lamps and to reduce
the broadening of the resonance lines. The sub-
stitution of this improved light source for a sodium
discharge lamp has been reported to provide tenfold
increases in the sensitivity of measurement of the
concentration of dissociated sodium in flames.?
The use of a light-interference filter comprised of
a multilayer interference and colored-glass filter

has been recommended® to provide more effective
isolation of the resonance line. Substitution of a
phase-sensitive amplifier for the tuned omplifier
will provide complete discrimination against fre-
quencies other than that of the pulsed-light beam.

While the improved instrument is being designed
and constructed, tests will be continued with the
present apparatus in order to determine the limita-
tions of the method and to define the optimum
conditions of sampling and transferring of samples.
The optical system of the existing instrument is
being further modified to incorporate multilayer
interference filters and to introduce additional
light stops which will" exclude the continuous
radiation of the heated furnace from the photo-
multiplier tube.

Since, as discussed" previously,4 resonance
radiation is not absorbed by sodium in a combined
form, such as sodium oxide, the samples of air
must be heated to provide sufficient dissociation
for measurable absorbancies. Brewer and Margrave >
measured the dissociation pressure of Na,O at re-
duced pressures and obtained values in reasonable
agreement with dissociation constants calculated
from thermodynamic data for the reaction

Na,0 (s)—> 2Na (g) + % O, (g)

The values given in Table 2.5.1 for the concen-
tration of gaseous sodium in equilibrium with
solid sodium oxide were calculated from extrapola-
tions of the theoretical dissociation constants,>
Similarly, the values for potassium were calculated
from estimated values for the free energies of
formation of K,0, as obtained by Glassner.®

If the concentration of sodium in the inlet air
to the ART radiators exceeded the equilibrium
concentration of sodium at the temperature of the
absorption cells, it is apparent that any sodium
introduced by leaks in the radiators would not be

detected because it would be converted to the
oxide. Since, on the basis of incompleted tests,
it appears that the concentration of sodium in air
frequently exceeds 10 ppb, an absorption cell
temperature of at least 800°C will be required for
the detection of increases in the concentration of
sodium. Even if the sensitivity of the instrument
could be extended to concentration levels below
1 ppb, the direct detection of sodium in the ART
stack gases (~600°C) does not appear to be
feasible,

Despite the somewhat smaller absorption coeffi-
cient of potassium for its resonance radiation, the
measurement of potassium in the air may provide
a more satisfactory method for the detection of
NaK leaks than the measurement of sodium because
of the higher decomposition pressure of K,0, In
addition the concentration of potassium in the inlet
air might be expected to be lower than that of
sodium,

Accordingly, tests of the sensitivity of the reso-
nance absorption method for the detection of
potassium will be carried out in parallel with the
continued tests of the sodium detector. The
present apparatus can be easily modified for
application to the defection of potassium by re-
placing the sodium light source with a potassium
lamp, replacing the interference filter with a
766-my filter, and replacing the photomultiplier
tube with a red-sensitive tube. The components
which are required for this modification have been
obtained.

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN
METALLIC LITHIUM

A. S. Meyer, Jr. R. E. Feathers

Development studies of methods for the determi-
nation of oxygen in metallic lithium were continued.
A proposed method, described earlier,” which in-
volved the pressurized dissolution of lithium in
small volumes of butyl iodide—iodine reagent, was
found to be unsatisfactory in that the dissolution
of 1.5-g samples of metallic lithium was too slow
and incomplete in volumes of 25 ml of butyl iodide
and 50 ml of ether, The apparatus in which the
dissolution is carried out under atmospheric pres-
sure was therefore modified to exclude more com-
pletely the contamination by moisture and oxygen.

In the modified apparatus the butyl iodide and
ether can be transferred under an inert gas from
drying agents (activated alumina and metallic
sodium, respectively) directly to the reaction
vessel. When this technique was used, concen-
trations of oxygen of approximately 100 ppm were
found in samples of metallic lithium which had
been distilled at the Nuclear Development Corpora-
tion of America (NDA). Since no samples known to
be completely tree of contamination by oxygen are
available, the reproducibility of the method has not
yet been established.

DETERMINATION OF TRACES OF OXYGEN IN
FLUORIDE SALTS AND IN METALS

A further survey of the methods for the determi-
nation of traces of combined oxygen in fluoride
salts and in metals was made. The most generally
appiicable chemical methods are based on the
liberation of elemental oxygen by fluorination.
Quantitative evolution of oxygen from metal oxides
by fluorination has been carried out with BrF,
(ref 8) or with the addition compounds of BrF,,
such as KBrF, or BrF,SbF, (ref 9). Since the
reaction with KBrF, can be performed more con-
veniently at higher temperatures than are practical

for BrF,, its fluorination reactions are more rapid
and can be applied to a wider variety of metallic
oxides, When the reaction is carried out at
400°C, ZrO,, ThO,, Al,O,, and the lanthanide
oxides are quantitatively fluorinated within a
period of 2 hr.? In the determination of oxygen a
sample of metal or salt is transferred to a nickel
reactor which contains an excess of KBrF ,. After
the system has been evacuated to remove non-
condensable gases, the reactor is sealed and
heated wuntil the oxides are decomposed. The
reactor is then cooled, and the liberated oxygen
is transferred through cold traps, which are fab-
ricated from fluorothene, to a glass system.
The oxygen is transferred with an automatic
Toepler pump to an evacuated vessel of known
volume, where the amount of oxygen is measured
by determining its pressure with a differential
manometer.  Apparatus is being fabricated for
tests of this method.

DETERMINATION OF ALUMINUM IN
MIXTURES OF FLUORIDE SALTS

J. P. Young J. R. French

A possible method for the determination of trace
amounts of aluminum in mixtures of fluoride salts
with pyrocatechol violet as a chromogenic reagent
is being investigated. Suk and Malat'? found that
this reagent was useful in the detection of alumi-
num on chromatographic columns, and Young,
French, and White'! observed that aluminum inter-
fered seriously in the determination of zirconium
with pyrocatechol violet.  Aluminum forms a
reddish-brown colored complex with pyrocatechol
violet in a sulfate solution which has been
buffered at a pH of 5.8 with ammonium acetate.
The molar-absorbance index for the complex is
approximately 65,000 at the wavelength of maximum
absorbance, 582 my. The absorbance of the com-
plex is linear with respect to its concentration
over a range of 0.04 to 0.4 ug of aluminum per
milliliter of solution. The reproducibility of the
data has not yet been satisfactory, however,
probably because of contamination of the solution

SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF
NICKEL IN ALKALI METALS

A. S, Meyer, Jr. B. L. McDowell

The developmental work was completed on the
spectrophotometric method for the determination
of traces of nickel in samples of alkali metals
with the use of 4-isopropyl-1,2-cyclohexanedione-
dioxime. As reported previously,'? nickel is
determined by measuring the absorbance of its
chelate complex at a wavelength of 385 my after
the extraction of the chelate into xylene from a
1 M solution of ammonium acetate at a pH of 7.
A linear relationship between absorbance and
concentration of nickel exists for the range of
2 to 12 ug of nickel per milliliter of xylene extract.

Methods have been developed for the elimination
of the major interferences — iron, cobalt, and
copper. lron, oxidized to the ferric state, is most
conveniently masked by the addition of fluoride.
When cobalt is present, its interference, together
with that of iron, is eliminated by the addition of
cyanide and peroxide to the neutral or basic solu-
tion, This treatment converts iron and cobalt to
the very stable complexes of ferricyanide and
cobalticyanide, respectively. Prior to the color
development, the less stable nickel cyanide com-
plex is decomposed by the addition of formal-
dehyde, 13

In the absence of iron and cobalt, copper can be
easily eliminated as the thiocyanate complex of
copper(l), as reported previously.'? When either
iron or cobalt or both are present with the copper,
the masking techniques for their elimination pre-
clude the reduction of copper(ll) to copper(l).
Thus, the copper is extracted with the nickel as
the chelate complex of the dioxime. Once ex-
tracted, the copper cannot be reduced readily and
then complexed with thiocyanate., Therefore the
following method was developed for the elimination
of the interference of copper after extraction. The
extract is washed with a weakly acid solution of
hydrogen sulfide, which is formed by heating a

The copper is transferred to the aqueous phase
and precipitated as the copper(ll) sulfide. Upon
neutralization and the addition of excess reagent,
any nickel which has accompanied the copper into
the aqueous phase can be quantitatively returned
to the organic phase by re-equilibration.

The partition coefficient of approximately 5000,
which was reported3 for the chelate in xylene, is
maintained even when large quantities of salt are
dissolved in the aqueous solution. Microgram
quantities of nickel were completely extracted from
an aqueous volume of 1 liter. The coefficient of
variation of the method, as based on standard
solutions, is 5% when all masking techniques are
included in the procedure.

OXIDATION OF CHROMIUM WITH
ARGENTIC OXIDE

J. P. Young J. R. French

An investigation of the precision of the method
for the determination of chromium with diphenyl-
carbazide in which chromium is oxidized with
argentic oxide'* was completed. The coefficient
of variation of the method for the determination of
20 to 80 pg of chromium is +less than 2%. This
compares very favorably with the coefficient of
variation of 2% for the determination of chromium
in which the oxidation is carried out with perchloric
acid.

Oxidation of chromium with argentic oxide was
also investigated for use in the determination of
microgram amounts of chromium in alkali metals
with diphenylcarbazide after the extraction of the
chromium into a solution of tri-n-octylphosphine
oxide (TOPO) in benzene.'® These investigations

revealed that the oxidation of chromium with:

argentic oxide could be used to replace oxidation
with bromine. The use of argentic oxide results
in a considerable saving of time in the oxidation
of chromium to dichromate prior to the formation of
the chromophore with diphenylcarbazide.

COMPARISON OF TWO METHODS FOR THE
DETERMINATION OF TRACE AMOUNTS
OF ZIRCONIUM WITH PYROCATECHOL VIOLET

J. P. Young J. R. French

A method for the spectrophotometric determina-
tion of zirconium with pyrocatechol violet was
recently reported by Flaschka and Farah,!® and
a comparison was made of their method with that
of Young, French, and White.!! The molar-absorb-
ance index of the zirconium—pyrocatechol violet
complex formed by the method of Flaschka and
Farah is approximately 14,000 at a wavelength of
620 myu, while that of the complex formed by the
method of Young, French, and White is 32,600 at
650 mu. Flaschka and Farah incorporate ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in their procedure;
they also add the chromogenic reagent after the
hydrogen ion concentration of the test solution
has been adjusted to a pH of 5.2. No EDTA is
added to the test solution in the procedure of
Young, French, and White, while the chromogenic
reagent is added to the acid test solution before
the pH is adjusted to 5.1. The pH of the test solu-
tion during the addition of pyrocatechol violet and
the presence or absence of EDTA were found to
be the bases for the difference in the sensitivity of
the two methods. By modifications which involve
these two points, either procedure can be altered
to give essentially the same results as the other,
It is indicated from the difference in the maximum
absorbances and the shapes of the absorbance
curves of test solutions prepared by the respective
methods that the complexes formed by the two
procedures are different., The advantage of the
method of Young, French, and White is the greater
sensitivity achieved in the absorbance of the
zirconium—pyrocatechol violet complex. The method
of Flaschka and Farah, since it incorporates the
presence of EDTA, is not affected by cations which
form complexes with this reagent.

of elemental constituents of fluoride-salt fuel
mixtures was continued. This reagent offers an
efficient and rapid means for isolating, separating,
or concentrating zirconium from acidic solutions,
Quantitative extraction of as much as 20 mg of
zirconium from 7 M chloride solutions or 14 mg of
zirconium from 7 M nitrate solutions is achieved
with 0.5 millimole of TOPO in systems in which
the aqueous-organic phase ratio is as high as 10,
Extraction coefficients that exceed 1000 are also
obtainable from 7 M perchlorate solutions; however,
the formation of three phases diminishes the value
of extractions from these media,

Inasmuch as zirconium forms very stable com-
plexes with sulfate, fluoride, and many polyhydroxy
organic acids, the extent to which zirconium is
extracted from acidic solutions that contain these
ions or acids was found to be small unless chloride
or nitrate was present. A marked increase in the
extraction coefficients of systems that contain
sulfate or polyhydroxy acids is realized when the
aqueous solution is made 7 M with respect to
chloride or nitrate, and quantitative separation of
zirconium from such systems is possible. The
addition of chloride or nitrate to fluoride solutions
does not improve the extraction; therefore, fluoride
must be removed from the aqueous solution (for
example, by fuming with perchloric acid) prior to
the extraction in order to achieve quantitative
separation of zirconium.

Initial results indicate that a rapid method for
determining zirconium is available through spec-
trophotometric measurement of the intensity of
the color that is developed when an alcoholic
solution of alizarin is added to a TOPO-cyclohexane
extract of zirconium,

MOLTEN AMMONIUM FORMATE AS A SOLVENT
FOR FLUORIDE SALTS

T. W. Gilbert

Brief experiments were made to demonstrate the
solubility of fluoride salts in molten ammonium
formate (mp, 116°C). |t was observed that mixtures
of fluoride salts are soluble to some extent and
that the melt usually remains liquid upon cooling
to room temperature. This behavior was attributed
to decomposition of the solvent, since the de-
composition products of ammonium formate (form-
amide and formic acid) are liquids at room tem-
perature.

170

When ammonium formate is heated in an open
vessel, decomposition takes place according to
the reactions

HCOONH, ——> HCONH, + H,0
HCOONH, ——> HCOOH + NH,

Experiments were conducted to determine the
relative amounts of these products that are formed,
as a function of time, at temperatures where
Decomposition was
studied at two temperatures, 120°C, which is
slightly above the melting point, and at 138°C,
Weighed samples of ammonium formate were heated
for various intervals of time and then dissolved in
water,

ammonium formate is molten.

The ammonium ion concentration and the
formic acid concentration were determined directly
by conductometric titration with sodium hydroxide.
The total decomposition was calculated from the
decrease in ammonium ion concentration, and the
percentage of decomposition according to the
second reaction was obtained from the amount of
formic acid formed.

At 120°C approximately 13% of the solvent was
decomposed after 30 min; in 17 hr the decomposi-
tion was nearly complete, At 138°C the decom-
position rate was much more rapid; at this tem-
perature 75% of the ammonium formate was
decomposed in 1 hr. The concentration of formic
acid in the melt was comparatively small. At
120°C the concentration was 4% after 30 min, and
it increased slowly with time to about 10% after
11 hr. When the ammonium formate was maintained
at 138°C, decomposition to formic acid was more
rapid, but still the concentration was rather small,
of the order of 11%. A detailed report on the
thermal decomposition of ammonium formate is
being prepared.

Further experiments revealed that neither formic
acid nor formamide alone is a suitable solvent for
fluoride salts. Hence, the solubility studies were
conducted with ammonium formate at about 120°C
to minimize thermal decomposition as much as
possible. Preliminary results indicated that NaF-
Zr|:4-UF4 is soluble in molten ammonium formate;
however, zirconium apparently reprecipitates as
the oxide upon standing. The addition of a com-
plexing agent for zirconium prevented this repre-
cipitation to a large extent. In all the tests a small
amount of residue remained. This residue was
identified by means of x-ray diffraction studies
as either ZrO, or ZrOF,; however, ZrO, added as
such is not soluble in moiten ammonium formate.

The solubility of yttrium fluoride in this solvent
was also investigated. It appears that the solu-
bility patterns of the fluoride and oxide are just
opposite to those of zirconium fluoride and oxide.
Yttrium oxide is very readily soluble, whereas the
fluoride is quite insoluble. Preliminary experi-
ments have shown that it should be possible to

COMPATIBILITY OF LEAD AND ALUMINUM
INWATER

A. S. Meyer, Jr. G. Goldberg

An experiment was carried out to determine the
compatibility of aluminum and lead in water, This
information is needed in the design of supple-
mentary ART lead shielding, which will be placed
within the aluminum container for the water shield
adjacent to the region where the primary lead
shield is thin to accommodate the overflow line.
Electrodes of lead and 2S aluminum were prepared
by polishing 50-cm sheets of these metals with
6/0 abrasive. The electrodes were placed approxi-
mately 3 in. apart in a cell which was filled with
flowing tap water. The pH of the water was
approximately 7.5, and its temperature ranged from
15 to 20°C, When the electrodes were connected
through a microammeter, an initial current of 70 pa
was observed. The current decreased rapidly to
less than 20 pa and remained between 5 and 20 pa
for a period of 100 hr. A dark deposit formed on
the lead electrode, while only a dull film was
observed on the surface of the aluminum. The
current was not increased significantly by re-
ducing the electrode spacing to ]/2 in. or by meas-
uring the current with a galvanometer shunted with
a l-ohm resistor. An electrolytic current of 20 pa
corresponds fo an average corrosion rate of less
than 0.1 mil in 1000 hr, and it is therefore con-
cluded that lead and aluminum are reasonably

compatible in water under the conditions of this
test. The compatibility of these metals in static
demineralized water at 30°C is being investigated.

SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ABSORPTION CELLS
FOR USE WITH SMALL VOLUMES

A. S. Meyer, Jr. G. Goldberg

Commercially available absorption cells with a
S5-em light path require approximately 15 mi of
solution for each measurement, and measurements
on smaller volumes are frequently desired. There-
fore an absorption cell with a 5-cm path but with
a capacity of less than 5 ml of solution was de-
signed and fabricated. The cells were fabricated
of Teflon because of the close tolerances to which
it can be machined and its resistivity to the
various acids and solvents that are used in spec-
trophotometric analysis. Interchangeable quartz
windows, which can be replaced with Plexiglas
for the measurement of solutions that contain
hydrofluoric acid, are used in conjunction with
the cell. When threaded Teflon plugs are locked
in place on either end of the cell, the windows are
held in place and a liquid-tight seal is effected.

The capacity of the cell, which has an inside
diameter of 0.391 in., is just over 4 ml. Prelimi-
nary experimentation with a set of cells has re-
vealed them to be interchangeable as sample and
reference cells because of the close tolerances to
which the machining was held. The cells can be
used in the standard cell carrier of a Beckman
spectrophotometer,

acid. After filtration the precipitate was ignited
at 700°C in vacuum in order to obtain Ce,0,.
Ignition in vacuum is necessary to prevent the
formation of CeO,. The product obtained was con-
taminated by carbon, which probably resulted from
the postulated decomposition reaction

2Ce,(C,0,); —> 2Ce,0, + 9CO, + 3C

A product that was free of carbon was prepared by

172

precipitating the cerium as Ce(OH); and igniting
the hydroxide to Ce,0;. Complete removal of
water from the hydroxide was found to be difficult
even by ignition. A 5% loss in weight was ob-
served when Ce(OH), that had been dried at 900
to 1000°C under a pressure of 1 u was ignited in
air. Batches of 15 and 100 g of Ce 0, which con-
tained, respectively, 1 and 3 mc of Ce'4! were
prepared in this manner,

MATERIAL FABRICATION

Work was continued on the program for developing
nickel-molybdenum alloy structural materials that
will have better strength and corrosion properties
than those of Inconel when in contact with fused
salt fuels at temperatures higher than 1500°F, The
alloys being studied, which are designated INOR-1
through 9, were described previously in detail. !
Much of the developmental effort is now being

H. Inouye

concentrated on the evaluation of INOR-8, which
was produced in pilot heats during the quarter.
A 5200-1b heat of INOR-8 was melted and forged
by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and a
10,000-1b heat was similarly prepared by the Haynes
Stellite Company. The initial reports on the
casting and forging of these two heats were favor-
able. Material is not as yet available from the
heat prepared at Haynes Stellite, but some results
of studies of the Westinghouse heat are reported
below.

Evaluation of INOR-8
The 5,200-1b heat of INOR-8 melted at the West-

inghouse Electric Corporation? on February 15,
1957 was poured to yield four ingots of the fol-
lowing approximate sizes: two 300-Ib ingots
6]/2 in. square, one 1500-Ib ingot 12 in. square, and
one 3000-1b ingot ]5]/2 in. square. Chemical analy-
ses of the material (Westinghouse heat M-1327)
showed the composition to be:

Quantity
Component (wi %)
Mo 16.90
Cr 6.86
Fe 4.21
Mn 0.84
Si 0.23
C 0.14
Ni Bal

The composition of the alloy was thus within the
specified limits, except for carbon, which was to

have been between 0.04 and 0.08%.

Forging studies were carried out on the material
at a temperature of 2200°F, One 300-Ib ingot was
hammer-forged to a 4-in.-dia round, and the other
300-1b ingot was press-forged to a 4-in. square,
Both forgings were machined to 3-in.-dia bars,
which were inspected by ultrasonic techniques.
Unsound areas detected in both bars were traced
back to shrinkage cavities in the original ingots,
The forgeability of the material was considered to
be satisfactory, with a reported yield of approxi-
mately 80% in going from ingot to forged bar. The
20% loss was principally the result of cropping of
the ingot hot-tops prior to forging.

A second heat of the alloy is to be poured into
tapered molds which are smaller at the bottom than
at the top to ensure sounder ingots. Future heats
will also be adjusted to the specified carbon
content.

A sound 3-in.-diq, 7-in.-long billet from the
initial heat of the alloy was received for evalua-
tion. The material was successfully worked by
extrusion and by hot and cold rolling. Specimens
have been prepared for the determination of creep-
rupture properties, tensile strengths, density,
thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity.
Measurements made by weighing machined speci-
mens show the density of the material to be
8.795 g/em3. To date, creep-rupture tests have
been run in argon and in fuel mixture 107, NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (11,2-41-45,3-2,5 mole %), as described
in the section of this chapter on ‘‘Mechanical
Properties Evaluation.”

The program concerned with investigating the
effect of varying composition on the mechanical
properties of alloys of the INOR-8 type, as pre-
viously outlined,! is well under way. Creep-
rupture tests have been run on a series of heats
at a stress of 10,000 psi at 1500°F in argon. The
results of these tests on experimental melts and on
the Westinghouse heat are compared in Table 3.1.1
with results of a similar test of Inconel. Although
the rupture life and ductility are lower than antici-
pated, the creep rate of the Westinghouse alloy
is superior fo the creep rates for the other materials.,
It is not known at this time whether the high carbon
content or the melting practice is responsible for
the short rupture life and low ductility. A pre-
liminary comparison of the times required to produce
the specified elongation indicates, however, that
(1) ali the materials tested are superior to Inconel,

(2) increasing the molybdenum content is the most
effective means of improving the creep properties,
(3) increasing the chromium content from 5 to 7%
without changing the molybdenum and iron contents
produces only a slight improvement in the creep
properties, (4) there is no obvious correlation of
the rupture life of the material with the total con-
tent of alloying elements in the nickel base.

In order to study the effect of vacuum-remelting
on the mechanical properties of the high-carbon
Westinghouse heat of INOR-8, a 3-lb ingot was
prepared from the air-melted material. The ingot
was rolled to 0.065in.-thick strip from which
creep-rupture specimens were prepared for evalua-
tion. The results of these tests are not yet avail-
able.

An additional 3-in.-dia, 3-in.-long billet of the
alloy INOR-8, which was received from Westing-
house, was successfully extruded to a tube blank
and sent to Superior Tube Company for further
processing to determine the amenability of the
material to tube-drawing practice.

Oxidation Resistance Studies

The test temperature for the oxidation resistance
studies of the nickel-molybdenum alloys was in-
creased to 1800°F, and alloys with various amounts
of chromium (0 to ~8 wt %) were tested in order to
determine the minimum chromium content required
for oxidation resistance. The data obtained at
1600 and 1800°F are presented in Table 3.1.2.
The results are similar to those obtained previously
at 1500°F, and thus it appears that a chromium
content of about 7%, which is adequate for oxida-
tion resistance at 1500°F, is sufficient for oxida-
tion resistance at temperatures up to 1800°F., As
shown in the table, the Westinghouse heat M-1327
had satisfactory oxidation resistance,

Evaluation of Experimental INOR-9 Alloys

The evaluation studies of alloys of the Ni-Mo-
Nb-Fe system (INOR-9) were continued, and esti-
mates are now available of the solubility limits of

a function of composition, and the forgeability of
the alloys. The heats studied thus far have con-
tained 10 to 17% Mo, 3 to 10% Nb, up to 6% Fe,
and the balance nickel.

The study of the forgeability of 100-g arc melts
showed that the alloys in this system are amenable
to hot and cold rolling provided the niobium con-
tent is 7.5% or less. The edge splitting observed
during hot rolling of the forgeable arc melts was
magnified in several vacuum-induction melts, It
appears that for melts prepared with niobium added
either as the metal or as Ferro-Columbium greater
care must be taken to provide the necessary de-
oxidizing elements than is required in the prepara-

tion of the alloys of the INOR-8 group.

The oxidation tests of these alloys at 1500 and
1700°F have shown oxidation rates that are slightly
higher than those observed for Hastelloy B. The
solubility limit of niobium in these alloys was
found to be less than 5% in the temperature range

of 1300 to 1700°F and to be independent of the

molybdenum content,

Fabrication of Seamless Tubing from
Experimental Alloys

Seamless tubing drawn by the Superior Tube
Company from experimental nickel-molybdenum
base alloy tube blanks prepared at ORNL has been
received for corrosion evaluation. The materials
received are described in Table 3.1.3.

It had originally been planned to fabricate a
forced-circulation loop with the tubing obtained
from heats 30-46 and -47, but, since the tubing
yield was lower than anticipated, three thermal-
convection loops have been fabricated for operation
with NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45,3-2.5 mole 7%,
fuel 107). A report from the Superior Tube Company
indicates that conditioning losses were the cause
of the low yield. Such losses on laboratory tube
blanks result primarily from the machining opera-
tion required to correct nonuniform as-extruded
wall thicknesses.

The tubing prepared from heats 30-50, -51, -54,
-55, and -56 was received late in the quarter and
has not yet been inspected. If the tubing is sound,
one forced-circulation loop of each of the two
types of alloys will be fabricated for testing with
fuel 107. The alloys shown in Table 3.1.3 for
which processing has not been completed will be
studied to determine the effect of Al, Al-Nb-Cr,
and Cr-Fe on the corrosion resistance of the
alloys.

Phase Diagram Studies at the University
of Tennessee?

Inconsistencies in x-ray data and metallographic
examinations have indicated that severe inhomo-

178

geneities have probably existed in the furnace-
cooled ingots used in the investigation of the
phase relationships and characteristic phase trans-
formations which relate to the mechanical properties
of nickel-rich alloys containing molybdenum or
molybdenum plus chromium.4 Since an effort had
been made to homogeneize the ingots by heating
them at 2280 to 2370°F for 100 hr or more, a new
method for preparing the alloys was apparently
needed, A method was devised in which the molten
metal is chill-cast into ingots approximately 3 in,
long, 3/4 in, wide, and ]/2 in. thick. An atmosphere
of hydrogen is used during the melting step, but the
casting is done under a partial vacuum, Prior to
vacuum casting, the molten metal is superheated by
approximately 300°F for 30 to 45 min to ensure a
completely homogeneous melt.

Metallographic examination of ingots cast by
using the new method showed the alloys to be
very dense. Slight coring had occurred, but there

Aging Characteristics of Hastelloy W

The room-temperature and high-temperature (1200
to 1500°F) tensile properties of a commercial heat
of Hastelloy W sheet were determined after aging
at several temperatures for periods of up to 1000 hr.
As shown in Fig. 3.1.1, the response of this alloy
to aging time is most pronounced in the interval up
to 300 hr. Aging times greater than 300 hr have
only a slight effect, and the alloy shows no indi-
cation of overaging in 1000 hr., The most sensitive
aging temperature for this alloy appears to be

The major effects of elevated temperatures on the
tensile properties were, as expected, decreases in
the tensile and yield strengths, as shown in Fig.

ductility was only about one-half that of the speci-

Testing of the specimens obtained from the
4800-1b International Nickel Company air melts
has been completed. All these alloys showed very
poor stress-rupture properties in comparison with
similar compositions produced at Battelle Memorial
Institute and at ORNL. The low ductility coupled
with early failure indicate that the melts were
insufficiently degassed. It was suggested that the
poor surfaces of the International Nickel Company
specimens might have contributed to their low
ductility, and therefore new specimens were pre-
pared from material rolled at ORNL from ‘/2-in.-
thick plate material to 0.050-in.-thick sheet. These
specimens, designated A following the heat number
in Table 3.1.4, showed no indication that the poor
surfaces had affected the stress-rupture properties.

Specimens from Westinghouse heat (M-1327) of
the INOR-8 alloy also exhibited shorter times to
rupture than were expected on the basis of previous

The creep rate, however, was improved. The
specimen from the air-melted M-1327 heat that was
tested in the annealed condition is shown in Fig.
3.1.3, and it may be compared with the similarly
tested specimen from vacuum-melted heat 30-34
that is shown in Fig. 3.1.4. The formation of a
continuous network of carbides around each grain
is evident in Fig. 3.1.4, whereas there was very

little precipitation in the grain boundaries of the
specimen shown in Fig. 3:1.3. In previous tests,
the alloys with the best creep characteristics also
showed the continuous network of carbides around
the grains. There was little or no corrosive attack
of either specimen,

alloys have been successfully completed. It is

specimens to prepare them for testing, and fracture
has occurred in the shoulders of four of the six
specimens because of their poor welding charac-
teristics.,

Since it is hoped that the nickel-molybdenum
base alloys will be suitable for use at temperatures
above 1500°F, tests have also been conducted at
1800°F at a stress of 3000 psi in fuel 107, The
results of these tests, which are summarized in
Table 3.1.5, again indicate that the vacuum-
melted alloys are superior to the air-melted alloys.

It was predicted that in the commercial-size air-
melted heats better control of the composition and
deoxidation practice could be obtained and that
the large heats would thus have improved strength
properties as compared with the small laboratory-
scale heats. Based on results obtained thus far,
however, the degree of control necessary for the

182

production of commercial-size heats with adequate
high-temperature strength has not yet been attained.

Weldability of the INOR Alloys

Test plates of the alloys described in Table 3.1.6
were welded by using filler metal of the same
composition as that of the base metal. No base
metal cracks were observed in the test plates, but,
as indicated in the table, visual and x-ray examina-
tions of the weld metal showed some of the welds
to be unsatisfactory. If an otherwise suitable

metal of the same composition as the base metal,
it may be possible to modify the filler metal to
obtain satisfactory welds. Coupons for hardness
and microstructural studies were machined from
each of the test plates, and they will be aged and
examined. Tensile properties of the INOR-8
composition will be determined both in the as-
welded condition and the welded-and-aged condi-
tion,

Hordness studies were made of the INOR-8 weld-
ments in the as-welded and welded-and-aged con-
ditions, and the results indicate that aging has
little effect on hardness, except, perhaps, that it
relieves residual stress and allows diffusion to
reduce the effects of segregation. The average
hardnesses of the weld and base metal of coupons
aged at various temperatures for 200 hr are given
in Table 3.1.7. Metallographic examination of

these specimens revealed little change in the
appearance of the weld metal as a result of aging
at temperatures up to 1500°F, However, the eutec-
tic structure found in the weld metal of nearly all
the specimens aged at 1700°F had been spheroidized
and a grain-boundary precipitate had appeared.

Brazability of the INOR Alloys
The brazability of the INOR alloys will be an

important factor in their possible use in heat ex-
changers and radiators, Flowability tests were
therefore conducted with Coast Metals brazing
alloy No. 52 in a dry-hydrogen atmosphere. The
results of these tests are given in Table 3.1.8. It
was found that flowability of the brazing alloy was
unsatisfactory on the INOR alloys containing 1%
or more aluminum, even with a rapid rate of rise
to brazing temperature.

mixture to 3275 ppm Al and 630 ppm Cr accompanied
the attack. Metallographic examination of the cold
leg of loop 1133 revealed moderate-to-heavy general
subsurface void formation to a depth of 1 mil. No
cold-leg deposits were found.

The hot leg of loop 1119 was attacked to a depth
of less than 1 mil, and the attack occurred as
shallow surface pits. Hot-leg attack in loop 1123
reached a maximum depth of 2 mils in the form of
subsurface wvoids and surface pits. The cold
legs of both these loops showed slight surfate
roughness but no evidence of deposits.

Since these nickel-molybdenum base alloys and
similar alloys tested previously® =8 showed quite
promising corrosion resistance to fuel mixture 107
in 500-hr tests, 1000-hr tests of these alloys are
now being conducted at 1500°F. The compositions
of the alloys tested and the results of the recently
completed 1000-hr tests are presented in Table
3.1.11 and compared with the results of the pre-
viously reported 500-hr tests of the same dlloys.

additional 500 hr of operation in the loops con-
taining 2 wt % aluminum (loops 1108 and 1114),
4 wt % vanadium (loops 1123 and 1125), and 3 wt %
niobium (loops 1126 and 1128). Loop 1135 showed
an increase of 1.5 mils in hot-leg attack as a re-
sult of the additional 500 hr of operation. The
attack of 4.5 mils in this loop, shown in Fig. 3.1.6,
is the deepest which has been found to date in
the nickel-molybdenum base alloy—fuel 107 sys-
tems. No cold-leg deposits were visible in any of
the loops.

The most sjgnificant observation made in com-
paring the results of the 500- and 1000-hr tests -is
that the increases in the operating time did not
appreciably increase the attack of the alloys which
contained 3 and 5 wt % niobium. Furthermore, the
increase of the niobium content from 3 to 5 wt %
does not appear to have a noticeable effect on the
depth of corrosion. The alloys containing 2 wt %
titanium were similarly unaffected by the increase
in operating time.

Loop 1122 which also was to have operated for
1000 hr was shut down after 791 hr because the
flow of the fuel mixture stopped. This loop gave
indications of plugging during its operation and
was allowed to operate until the fuel froze in the
loop. The loop was then x-rayed to determine
whether a metallic plug had formed; however, no
evidence of a plug could be found. Further,

petrographic examination of the fuel in the area
of the plug did not reveal phase changes. Although
macroexamination of the cold-leg section did show
evidences of metallic crystals, these were not
present in sufficient quantity to account for flow
stoppage. Thus, the reason for the apparent
plugging of this loop is presently unexplained.

The chemical analyses of the fuel circulated in
these loops, as shown in Table 3.1.11, correlate
well with the corrosion results in that the least
amounts of corrosion products were found in the
fuel mixtures circulated in the loops which showed
good corrosion resistance to the fuel, for example,
the loops constructed of alloys which contained
niobium and titanium. The increase in the operating
time from 500 to 1000 hr caused a significant in-
crease in the aluminum concentration of the fuel

circulated in the loops constructed of alloys con-
taining aluminum,

Thermal-Convection Loop Tests of Nickel-

The results of thermal-convection loop tests of
nickel-molybdenum base alloys exposed to sodium
for 1000 hr at 1500°F are summarized in Table

all the loops. A few scattered metallic deposits
were found in the lowest temperature region of
each loop, and the maximum hot-leg attack found in
any loop was approximately 2 mils in depth. The
hot-leg attack appeared as surface roughness and
pits.  Spectrographic analyses of the cold-leg
deposits showed them to be predominantly nickel.

Sodium in Hastelloy B Forced-Circulation Loops

Further evaluation studies have been made of the

rate of corrosion of nickel-molybdenum base alloys
in molten sodium. Two Hastelloy B loops were
constructed and operated to provide a direct com-
parison of the mass transfer properties of this
alloy with those of Inconel. Both the loops were
operated for 1000 hr with temperature drops of
300°F, and the maximum fluid temperatures were
1500 and 1300°F, respectively. Cold traps were
operated in conjunction with both loops to keep the

188

oxide content of the sodium below the saturation

value at 300°F (~50 ppm).

The loop operated with a maximum fluid tempera-
ture of 1500°F (7642-1) was found to contain a
somewhat larger mass of deposited material in the
cold leg than is normally found in Inconel loops
operated under similar conditions. The total weight
of the deposit, which was determined by mechani-
cally removing the material from the cold leg and
weighing it, was 17.3 g, whereas 13- to 14-g de-
posits are usually found .in the Inconel loops. The
results of chemical analyses of deposited material
from both Inconel and Hastelloy B loops are pre-
sented in Table 3.1.13. As may be noted, the
deposits from both alloys are composed primarily of
nickel. The amount of mass transfer that occurred
in the Hastelloy B loop (7642-2) operated with a
maximum fluid temperature of 1300°F was very
slight. The total weight of the deposited material
found was only 0.4 g. Similar results were obtained
for Inconel loops operated at 1300°F. Thus the
marked increase which occurs in the rate of mass
transfer as the operating temperature is increased
to above 1300°F in Inconel-sodium systems seems
to occur in like manner but to a greater extent in
Hastelloy B-sodium systems.  Hot-leg attack
occurred in both the Hastelloy B loops as heavy
surface pits to a depth of 1.5 mils.

Microscopic examination of crystals from the
deposit found in the Hastelloy B loop operated at
1500°F showed them to be fairly large hexagonal
platelets growing out of clusters of smaller crystals
of undetermined morphology. The lattice parameter

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

of the crystals was somewhat higher than the
lattice parameter of pure nickel and probably re-
flects the presence of small amounts of iron,
chromium, and molybdenum in solid solution, A

lets showed the plane of the platelet to be a {111}

3.2, DEVELOPMENTAL STUDIES OF INCONEL

MECHANICAL AND THERMAL STRAIN-CYCLING
TESTS OF INCONEL

C. R. Kennedy! D. A. Douglas

The behavior of materials when subjected to
large changes in temperature and the resulting
induced stresses and plastic deformation is one
of the least understood phases of mechanical
properties investigation. The work at ORNL in
connection with this problem has been a study of
mechanically induced strains under isothermal
conditions. These data will be compared with
results obtained under subcontracts at the University
of Alabama and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
in tests in which strain is introduced thermally.

Mechanical strain-cycling tests of Inconel-rod
specimens (both fine- and coarse-grained) at
1300 and 1600°F in argon have been completed.
The test results are presented in Figs. 3.2.1 and
3.2.2 where plastic strain per cycle, €., is plotted
as a function of the number of cycles to failure,
N. The type of strain cycle used in each test
is shown in the corner of each figure,
noted that the coarse-grained material tested at
1600°F failed in fewer cycles than did the fine-
grained material. A similar difference in number
of cycles to failure was found previously 2 in tests

It may be

at 1500°F. At 1300°F, however, the difference
between fine- and coarse-grained material is
negligible. |t may be concluded therefore that

fine-grained material would be superior to coarse-
grained material in components that would be
subjected to thermal cycling at temperatures
above 1300°F.

The effects of strain cycling at the three tem-
peratures are compared for fine-grained as-received
material in Fig. 3.2.3 and for coarse-grained
material annealed at 2050°F for 2 hr in Fig. 3.2.4.
There appears to be anomalous effects of tem-
perature in the tests at high plastic strain per
cycle. For low plastic strain per cycle, however,
the effect of temperature seems to be quite small.
These differences have not yet been explained,
but it is thought that they may be associated
with the carbide precipitation which occurs at
these temperatures.

A similar series of tests was run on tubular
specimens at 1500°F in argon and in the fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30).
The structure of the coarse-grained tubular speci-
mens may be compared with the structure of the

1500°F in argon are presented in Fig. 3.2.9. The
data for fine-grained rod are also included in
Fig. 3.2.9 for comparison with the tube data. It
appears that at low strain the tubular specimens
fail in fewer cycles than the rod specimens. This
difference in properties, however, appears to be
a function of the method of sensing failure. For
rod specimens, complete fracture constitutes
failure, whereas, for tubular specimens, a single
crack through the wall indicates failure. If the
criterion of failure for the rod specimens is applied
to the tube specimens (test points shown in Fig.
3.2.9 as black triangles), the data are very similar.
The effect of the grain size in the tubes is similar
to the effect of grain size in the rods in tests
above 1300°F, except that the difference between
the fine- and coarse-grained material is not so
great because the difference in grain sizes of
tubular material is not so great as the diffetence
in grain sizes of rod specimens.

The results of the tests in fuel 30 at 1500°F
are presented in Figs. 3.2.10 and 3.2.11. The
data in Fig. 3.2.10 indicate that the fuel 30 en-
vironment had only a slight effect on the fine-
grained Inconel tubing. However, as may be seen
in Fig. 3.2.11, the coarse-grained Inconel tubing
was greatly affected by fuel 30 at low strain per
cycle. Since corrosion by fuel 30 is time-dependent
and the cycle time was less than 2 min, the speci-
mens tested at high strain per cycle were not
exposed to the fuel long enough for its corrosive
properties to have significantly affected the rupture
life. Tests during which the specimen will be
exposed to the environment for a significant
period are planned.

The data reported above were obtained with
the equipment described previously.?2 The strain
cycle produced with the apparatus used is com-
pared in Fig. 3.2.12 with the type of strain cycle
that would result from a thermal or load cycle
caused by changing from one steady state to
another. A comparison of the two curves shows

the points are data obtained in the 30-min cycle
test with increasing plastic strain per cycle.
These test points show clearly that the empirical
equation

N“ep =C ,

where a and C are constants, fits the experimental
data for plastic strain cycling at high temperatures.
Since this total plastic strain correlation is valid,
the Inconel rod data were also plotted in this
manner, as shown in Figs. 3.2.16, 3.2.17, and
3.2.18.

At the University of Alabama, attempts to explore
the effect of thermally induced strain have been
hampered by instrumentation difficulties. A few
tests were completed during the quarter, however,
in which the specimens were rigidly clamped and
the temperature was cycled between 1000 and
1600°F or 1200 and 1600°F at a rate of 1 cycle
per minute. Although the amount of plastic strain
per cycle cannot be calculated precisely, close
approximations indicate that the data obtained
in the thermal tests agree well with those obtained
at ORNL under isothermal conditions.

At ORNL, relaxation tests of fine-grained Inconel
at 1650°F and of coarse-grained Inconel at 1100°F
were completed, and the results are presented in
Figs. 3.2.19 and 3.2.20. The test procedure de-
scribed previously? was used, and the results
obtained correlate with the values expected on
the basis of previous tests.

At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, controlled-
resistance-heating equipment was used to conduct
thermal tests which simulated the temperature
range and the heating and cooling rates expected
in full-power cycles of the ART. A clamped
specimen at 1200°F was heated to 1600°F at a
rate of 10°F/sec, held at 1600°F for 5 min, and
then cooled to 1200°F at a relatively slow rate
of 40°F/min. After a 5-min hold period at 1200°F,
the cycle was repeated until the specimen had
been subjected to 100 such cycles. Two coarse-
grained specimens were tested in this manner and
two others were tested with a slower heating rate
of 4°F/sec. Examination of the specimens after
the tests revealed no evidence of cracking or
failure of either specimen. There was no dis-
cernible difference as a result of changing the
heating rate.  The initial
induced when the specimens were heated was
about 10,000 psi, but at the end of 100 cycles
it was about 9000 psi. The tensile stress induced
by cooling from 1600°F gradually increased with
successive cycles.

ratio of 0.7 at a cyclic rate of 10 cps at a tem-
perature of 1600°F. These tests were primarily
for the purpose of checking the strain sensing
and recording equipment, and it was found that
several modifications were necessary. Duplicate
tests will be run to determine reproducibility of
results, other load ratios will be explored, and
tests with cyclic frequencies of 1 cps will be tried.

EFFECT OF CYCLIC BENDING ON
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF INCONEL

J. H. DeVan

Bend tests designed to simulate the thermally
induced strain patterns that will be imposed on
the core shells and heat exchanger tubes of the
ART are being run in order to evaluate the effect
of cyclic stress conditions., The temperatures
being used for this investigation are 1200, 1400,
and 1600°F. Outer fiber strains in the specimens
vary from 0.6 to 1.0%, and the strain is reversed
at '/2- and 2-hr intervals. The apparatus being
used for these tests was described previously.

The initial investigations were conducted in
a helium atmosphere to provide a basis of com-
parison with later tests in which the specimens
were exposed to the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30). The results of the tests
recently completed on Y-in.-thick Inconel sheet
specimens in the mill-annealed condition (1600°F
for 1 hr) are shown in Tables 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
The results of the tests in which the specimens
were exposed to fuel 30 show little effect of the
environment at 1200°F, and even at 1400 and
1600°F the effect of the corrosive environment
was significant only after relatively long test
periods. In the 300-hr test at 1600°F, for example,
cracks developed that reached to considerable
depths, as shown in Fig. 3.2.21.

RECRYSTALLIZATION AND GRAIN GROWTH
OF INCONEL

D. A. Douglas

In order to make reasonable estimates of the
mechanical properties of Inconel to be expected
in the reactor service temperature range, the
effects of various fabrication procedures and
thermal treatments on the microstructure of the
material must be known. Therefore, an investi-
gation was made to determine the relationship
between cold work and the recrystallization tem-
perature for fine- and coarse-grained Inconel.
In addition, the effects of cold work and tem-
perature on the grain size were studied.

A ]/4-in.-thick Inconel plate with a nominal carbon
content of 0.04% was selected for this study.
Specimens were cold reduced by specified amounts
(5, 10, 20, 50, and 80%) and then annealed at
temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1900°F. The

specimens were held at the annealing temperatures
for periods of 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. A series
of hardness tests were made on the material so
treated, and the results were plotted vs tem-
perature. As is conventional, the temperature
corresponding to the mid-point in the break in
the hardness curve was taken as the approximate
recrystallization temperature. A plot of the re-
crystallization temperatures as a function of
the cold work for fine-grained Inconel is pre-
sented in Fig. 3.2.22 and a similar plot for
coarse-grained Inconel is given in Fig. 3.2.23.
A study of these curves indicates (1) that re-
crystallization may occur at a temperature as low
as 1200°F in 80% cold-reduced material and at
a temperature as high as 1800°F in 5% cold-re-
duced material, (2) that the recrystallization
temperature for any specific amount of cold work
can be lowered by from 50 to 100°F by increasing
the time at temperature from 15 to 120 min, and
(3) that the
coarse-grained Inconel
higher than that for fine-grained
reduced a comparable amount.

The important influence of grain size on creep-
rupture properties was discussed previously,® and
the effect of grain size on strain-cycling behavior
is discussed in a previous section of this chapter.
A stable grain size is maintained over a large
temperature range because carbides dispersed in
the grain boundaries restrict any tendency for growth
to occur. A temperature can be reached, however,
where the carbides will begin to coalesce and
finally to dissolve in the matrix. The loss of
these particles allows the grains to grow until
an equilibrium size for the particular annealing
temperature is reached. The grain sizes produced
in initially fine-grained Inconel by cold reduction
and 120-min thermal treatments at 1600, 1700,
1800, and 1900°F are shown in Figs. 3.2.24
through 3.2.28. It is clear that prior cold work
can significantly affect the final grain size of
the material even after a thermal treatment at
1900°F. The difference in grain size at this
high temperature, however, would probably not

have a significant influence on any mechanical
property.

The microstructures which result when the
material is initially coarse grained appear to be
different from the microstructures of fine-grained
Inconel, as shown in Figs. 3.2.29 through 3.2.33.
In Fig. 3.2.30 it may be seen that even though
recrystallization occurred, the specimens with 20,
50, and 80% cold work still show grain boundaries
Actually
these are the carbide precipitates which have

deformed along the rolling direction.

remained in position because they are not affected
by tne recrystallization process. Although most
of this effect can be removed by thermal treatment
at 1800°F, as shown in Fig. 3.2.32, not all evi-
dence of carbide precipitates is removed until the
carbides are completely dissolved by annealing
at 1900°F, as shown in Fig. 3.2.33. Thus it
appears to be somewhat difficult to achieve a
homogeneous fine-grained structure, especially with
regard to carbide distribution, when the material
is initially coarse grained. This is especially
true if the material is subjected to varying degrees
of cold work prior to annealing.

EFFECT OF BRAZING CYCLE ON GRAIN
GROWTH IN INCONEL TUBES

G. M. Slaughter

P. Patriarca

A summary of the effects of various brazing,
heat treating, and cold-working procedures on
grain growth in Inconel tubing was presented in
the previous report.® The data given previously
were obtained by heating short lengths of tubing
in hydrogen in a tube furnace at different tem-
peratures for various lengths of time. The time
to reach the desired temperature in the furnace
was approximately 2 min. The results of those
tests are not, directly applicable to
brazing practices, since relatively slow
rates of rise to temperature and rates of cooling
are usually used. The effective time above the
minimum grain-coarsening temperature is difficult
to determine for such a cycle, and correlation
with the preliminary studies is therefore question-

able.

Samples of 0.187-in.-OD Inconel radiator tubing
and 0.229-in.-OD heat exchanger tubing were
therefore subjected to several different simulated
brazing cycles in order to determine the actual
grain coarsening which could be expected with
each cycle. The results of these tests were
expected to provide specific data upon which to
base a re-evaluation of radiator and heat exchanger
brazing specifications.

The microstructure of a typical area heated to
1905°F for 30 min with a 500°F/hr rate of rise
to temperature and a 300°F/hr rate of cooling is
shown in Fig. 3.2.34. A tube given the same
treatment except that it was heated to 1920°F
is shown in Fig. 3.2.35. Similar tests and metallo-
graphic studies were made for maximum temperatures
of 1832, 1868, and 1950°F. The grain-growth
pattern of tubing held for 10 min at 1905°F was
also determined.

As a result of these tests and the related tests
described in the preceding section of this chapter,
the maximum brazing temperature permissible during
the brazing of high-conductivity fin radiators was
raised from 1905 to 1950°F. A similar metallo-
graphic study of lé- and Z-hard tubing is under
way.

After 900 hr of operation the Reynolds number was
increased to 60,000.

The loop was designed for obtaining data on
flow resistance as a result of mass transfer.
Pressure measuring instruments were placed across
the heated and cooled sections of the loop, and
changes in pressure drop were measured during
the course of the test.

After 900 hr of loop operation, no changes in
pressure drop had occurred, although the flow
rate had decreased slightly from its value at the
original pump speed setting. The flow rate was
increased slightly at this time, and no further
changes were observed during the remainder of
the test. The test was terminated after 1508 hr
of operation because of pump failure.

Examination of the loop showed very light
deposits in the %-in.-OD cooled section and
also in the loop bend immediately ahead of the
heated

It is believed that the deposited material in the

vented the correlation of pressure drop measure-
ments with the tube roughening caused by mass
transfer. Thus, although the resistance to flow

through the cooled section did increase, the
pressure drop measurement ahead of the cooled
section changed concurrently with the measure-
ment after the cooled section and no pressure
drop increase was registered.

In conventional Inconel forced-circulation loops
operated with sodium under simjlar temperature
conditions, deposits have not normally been found.
This difference may possibly be the result of
differences in flow rate or in oxide contamination
of the sodium. The mass flow rate in conventional
loops is approximately 132 Ib/ft%.sec as compared
with 605 |b/ft2.sec in this special loop. Also,
a diffusion-type cold trap was used for oxide re-
moval rather than a larger capacity bypass cold
trap of the type used in conventional loops. The
results of this test indicate, however, that mass
transfer may occur in an Inconel-sodium system
at 1250°F if the mass flow rate is high.

3.3. WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES

P. Patriarca

RADIATOR FABRICATION
G. M. Slaughter

An experimental brazing program was carried out
in cooperation with York Corp. personnel to de-
termine possible improvements in brazing procedures
and to evaluate such modifications before the
brazing of additional radiators. The basic step in
the investigation was the determination of the
temperature distribution during the brazing cycle.
For these tests, which were conducted by York
personnel, eight thermocouples were attached to
tubes in different areas of a rejected 500-kw high-
conductivity fin radiator. The radiator was then
sealed in a small retort and subjected to the
various brazing cycles. Through minor variations
in the operation of the furnace, attempts were
made to minimize the thermal gradients over the
unit without reducing the rate of rise to temperature
to below the desired 700 to 900°F /hr,

In the fifth test, in which all the best procedures
of the preceding tests were used, the temperature
spread at the start of the hold period was 17°F, but
it decreased to 8°F at the end of the 30-min hold
period. The maximum temperature measured during
this cycle was 1915°F and the minimum was
1898°F; however, all thermocouples reached at
least 1903°F at some time during the cycle.
The temperature readings obtained from the eight
thermocouples during the test are plotted in Fig.
3.3.1

The operating procedures used and the tempera-
ture distributions measured in these tests are only
partially applicable to the brazing of large test-
unit radiators because their design differs signifi-
cantly from that of the 500-kw unit. Wide thermal
gradients were observed, however, in prior brazing
tests of the larger radiator, as shown in Fig. 3.3.2,
and therefore the experience gained in these tests
was useful in providing a guide for further actual
brazing tests.

For an actual brazing test, run No. 6, a dummy
brazing furnace loading was assembled that con-
sisted of the rejected radiator at the bottom, a few
scrap tube-and-fin sections, a length of Inconel
pipe for an associated bright-annealing study, and
eight small tube-and-fin samples assembled with

brazing rings and attached to the radiator at various
places. This loading, unfortunately, did not closely
approximate the actual mass distribution of the
improved finned section. Eight thermocouples were
used, four on the radiator and four on the samples.
A sheet-metal baffle was placed over the top of
the retort in an attempt to provide more uniform
heat distribution. The thermocouple records for
this run are shown in Fig. 3.3.3. A 42°F tempera-
ture difference was evident at the start of the hold
period, but the difference had decreased to 22°F at
the end of the 30-min hold period. The maximum
temperature measured during the cycle was 1935°F
and the minimum was 1888°F, All the thermocouples
reached at least 1902°F at some time during the
cycle.

The small tube-and-fin samples were removed
from the retort and examined. Incomplete melting
was evident at the joints that could not be ac-
counted for on the basis of the temperature records

and dew-point measurements. A subsequent check
by York personnel revealed, however, that the
hydrogen atmosphere used in the furnace had be-
come contaminated because of the inadvertent use
of flux-impregnated aluminum oxide plates as
supports of the dummy loading during brazing.
Since the results of this experiment were, in
general, unsatisfactory, it was decided that another
experiment should be conducted.

For the next experiment, run No. 7, the rejected
radiator used in the previous tests was dissected
into four fin banks to permit the construction of a
simulated finned section of the improved design.
These four banks plus several other scrap tube-
and-fin test sections were assembled into a test
piece that closely resembled an actual unit in all
dimensions, including the vacant space between
the inlet and outlet matrices. Again, four thermo-
couples were attached to the radiator and four to

small braze samples. After sealing of the retort,
the sheet-metal heat baffle was again placed over
the top. In addition, a layer of insulating bricks
was placed between the baffle and the top of the
retort,

This dummy loading was heated at the approxi-
mate rate of 800°F/hr through the 1700 to 1900°F
critical range, and the temperature gradient over
the unit was held to a minimum. The temperature
spread at the start of the hold period was 27°F
(15°F between the thermocouples on the radiator).
This spread had decreased to 13°F (3°F on the
radiator) at the end of the 30-min hold period. The
maximum temperature measured during the hold
period was 1925°F and the minimum was 1890°F.
All thermocouples reached at least 1910°F at some
time -during the cycle. The thermocouple records
for this run are plotted in Fig. 3.3.4.

The tube-and-fin samples were removed from the
retort and examined. The samples which had
reached an approximate brazing temperature of
1920°F at the rate of 700 to 900°F/hr exhibited

consistently satisfactory braze quality. Samples

between room temperature ond 1800°F may be
attained. The bend radius is 3/16 in., and it is
possible to observe the face of the specimen at all
times during the test. The mode of failure may
thus be observed and correlated with the load-vs-
deflection curve. Elongation of the surface under
test may be estimated from the deflection or from
optical measurements.

It is possible with this apparatus to select the
exact area to be deformed (such as the interface of
the weld and the base metal) even if this area has
slightly greater
material. This apparatus may be applied in initial
screening tests of new materials because of the

SALVAGE OF CUT RADIATOR FIN MATERIAL
A, Goldman

The York Corp. has approximately 24,000 ft of
completed stainless-steel-clad copper radiator fins
which have been rendered obsolete by design
changes. Salvage of this material may be effected
by cutting the fins into the smaller sizes now
desired. Since unprotected edges are created when
the material is cut, it was necessary to determine
whether copper oxidation during service and the
resultant changes in heat transfer and air-flow
characteristics would prohibit the use of the cut
material. Methods of treating the exposed edges
were also studied.

The proposed methods for treating the exposed
edges were (1) painting the edges with aluminum
paint, (2) diffusing aluminum into the edges from
a solid block, (3) coating the edges with a Coast
Metals No. 52 brazing alloy slurry, and (4) crimping
the stainless steel surfaces prior to shearing the
fins. All these methods would involve considerable
handling of the fins, which might result in con-
tamination of the fins that would render them use-
less for brazing., Therefore, efforts have been
devoted primarily to determining whether the cut
edges can be left untreated.

Cyclic tests in static air were run on fins sheared
at ORNL. These fins had clean, sheared edges,
with little burring, and the full amount of copper
was exposed. The specimens were tested for
periods of up to 1000 hr at 1300 and 1500°F, and
they were cooled to room temperature once during
every 24-hr period of the test. After the tests the
specimens were cross-sectioned and examined for
oxidation. The results of the examinations are
presented in Table 3.3.1.

For dynamic tests some of the sheared fin material
was crimped at the sheared edge so that the stajn-
less steel cladding covered some of the edge and
limited the amount of copper available for oxida-
tion. The specimens were mounted in a radiator
test stand with the cut edges parallel to the air
flow and were tested for 533 hr under temperature
differential conditions at a maximum temperature
of about 1200°F. During the test, the conditions
were varied 13 times so that the specimens were
alternately blasted with air at 1200°F and cooled

The results of these tests are presented in Table
3.3.2,

Oxidation tests were also conducted on OFHC
copper samples, which were 0.064-in. blanks
polished through 0000 sandpaper and cleaned in
acetone. The oxidation rate was determined at
1300 and 1500°F for periods of up to 168 hr, as
shown in Fig. 3.3.8. An extrapolation of the
results to a 1000-hr period is presented in Fig.

metal lographically, and the linear relationship
between the thickness of the oxidized layer and
the weight change is shown in Fig. 3.3.10,

A metallographic study was also made of approxi-

3.4. CORROSION AND MASS TRANSFER STUDIES

CORROSION TESTS OF BRAZING ALLOYS
D. H. Jansen E. E. Hoffman

Newly developed industrial brazing alloys having
high nickel contents are corrosion tested, as they
become available, in NaK and in fused salts, with
the use of seesaw-furnace apparatus, in an effort
to find alloys other than Coast Metals No. 52 (89%
Ni=5% Si—-4% B-2% Fe) that could be used for
fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger fabrication. Seven
brazing alloys, with nickel contents ranging from
72 to 93 wt %, were corrosion tested at 1500°F for
100 hr in NaK and in Nc:F-Zer-UF4 (53.5-40-6.5
mole %, fuel 44). All the specimens were brazed
Inconel tube-to-header joints. Only two of the
seven alloys, Handy & Harmon Hi-temp No. 91
(nominal composition: 91.25% Ni-4.5% Si—-2.9% B)
and Handy & Harmon Hi-temp No. 93 (nominal
composition: 93.25% Ni-3.5% Si-1.9% B), which
were chromium-free and had low boron contents,
showed good corrosion resistance to both mediums.
The Hi-temp No. 91 specimens corrosion tested in
fuel and in NaK are shown in Fig. 3.4.1, and the

Hi-temp No. 93 specimen tested in fuel is shown

in Fig. 3.4.2.

Corrosion tests are now under way with these
Hi-temp alloys exposed to the fuel mixture NaF-
KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107).
This fuel has been shown to be more corrosive than
the NaF-ZrF,-UF, fuel mixtures to the Coast
Metals brazing alloys. Specimens of Coast Metals
No. 52 brazing alloy corrosion tested in the
fuels 44 and 107 under the same test conditions
are shown in Fig. 3.4.3. More corrosion can be
seen on the surface of the sample exposed to the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture than on the sample
exposed to fuel 44.

An iron-base brazing alloy (86% Fe-5% Si-5%
Cu-4% B) was also corrosion tested in NaK and
in N<:|l*:-ZrF4-UF4 (53.5-40-6.5 mole %, fuel 44) for
100 hr at 1500°F in the seesaw-furnace apparatus,
and the specimen showed good corrosion resistance
to both mediums. This alloy and other iron-base
brazing alloys are to be tested in lithium.

CORROSION OF FLUORINATOR VESSEL
FOR VOLATILITY PILOT PLANT

A. E. Goldman L. R. Trotter
E. E. Hoffman

Two preliminary corrosion tests were made with
the fluorinator vessel to be used in the fused-salt-
fluoride volatility process for reprocessing reactor
fuels, including those designed for circulating-fuel
reactors. The fluorinator vessel, which was fabri-
cated from low-carbon nickel, was tested under
simulated operating conditions in which the con-
tained fused salt mixture was sparged with fluorine
and UF , was evolved. Five low-carbon nickel test
rods that could be removed and sectioned for
metallographic examination were placed in the
fluorinator during each run, as shown in Fig. 3.4.4.
The test conditions and the results of the metallo-
graphic examinations are presented in Table 3.4.1.

Severe intergranular attack was found in the
grain boundaries of the test rods, as shown in Fig.
3.4.5. Specimens machined from the surfaces of the
rods and specimens cut from the center of the rods
were subjected to microspark spectrographic analy-
sis, and no impurities were found.

EFFECT ON BORON CARBIDE OF
EXPOSURE TO NaF-ZrF -UF ,

W. H. Cook E. E. Hoffman

A specimen of B,C was exposed to static NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %, fuel 44) at 1500°F
for 100 hr as part of the general program of cor-
rosion screening of ceramics in fused fluoride
salts. The specimen, which was exposed in an
Inconel container, had a porosity of approximately
20% and was 99.5% B,,C.

3ased on the quantity of boron found in the fuel
mixture by chemical analysis after the test, the
3,C specimen had lost 30% in weight. Metallo-
graphic examination showed an irregular reaction
layer surrounding the specimen. This layer had an

average thickness of 16 mils and minimum and
maximum thicknesses of 5 and 35 mils. Untested
and tested B,C specimens are compared in Fig.
3.4.6. In a similar test on a B,C specimen with
an apparent porosity of 3.5%, a layer of this type
with a maximum thickness of 14 mils developed. '
The composition of these layers had not yet been
determined.

BN is a potential control rod or shield material.

Powder x-ray diffraction analyses of an untested
BN + Si;N, specimen indicated that it consisted
primarily of BN, but there was an unidentifiable
secondary component. Since the quantity of Si N,
claimed to be contained in the sample (34%) was
large enough to have been detected by such x-ray
analyses, it appears that all the Si;N, must have
reacted with BN in the fabrication operations. The
specimen was changed to a powder during its ex-
posure to molten sodium, and subsequent x-ray
analyses of the powder gave the same results as
those for the untested specimen.

Metallographic examination of the ZrB, + BN
specimen, indicated that there may have been some
minor reaction between the ZrB, and BN. Whole
particles of the ZrB, were altered in color. The
attack on this specimen seemed to be largely on
the free BN,

In the metallographic examination of the MoSi, +
BN specimen, the structure was found to be a mix-

ture of two components. The sodium completely

penetrated the specimen and severely altered both
phases indiscriminately to a depth of 1 mil. This
severe surface attack is more damaging than the
deeper but less complete attack on the ZrB, + BN
specimen.

The metallographic data indicate that the presence
of BN in ZrB,, MoSi,, or Si N, directly or indirectly
decreases the corrosion resistance to molten
sodium. Chemical analyses of the sodium used in
these tests support this conclusion in a qualitative

way.

EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WITH
MOLTEN LITHIUM

T. Hikido? E. E. Hoffman

The NDA? program of lithium corrosion testing
was summarized in the previous report.* During
this quarter a considerable amount of additionadl
data has been accumulated, principally from thermal-
convection loop tests and rate-of-solution studies.

Thermal-convection loops fabricated of type 316
stainless steel and tested with lithium have shown
that the running time to plugging of a loop can be
substantially increased by the use of titanium
sponge in the hot leg, by adding a positive-flow
cold trap to the circuit, or by raising the cold-leg
temperature in order to reduce the total temperature
differential. Unfortunately, it is also clear that
these changes reduce the rate of mass transfer
only slightly and that the actual amounts of metal
transferred in the nonstandard loops, which operated
longer, are considerably larger than the amounts
transferred in standard loops. The major effect of
the various devices tried to date to reduce mass
transfer has been an alteration in the location or
physical nature (fine crystals vs larger crystals) of
the mass-transfer deposits.

Fourteen tests had been completed, as of April
30, 1957, with apparatus for determining rates of
solution of container materials in pure lithium.
Most of the experimental difficulties have been
corrected and some base-line data were obtained
for types 304 and 316 stainless steel. The rates
of solution are determined by weight-change meas-
urements on foil specimens immersed in high-purity

lithium (less than 10 ppm nitrogen) for short times
(1 and 4 hr). It has been found necessary to re-
place the tantalum test container with one con-
structed of molybdenum because of dissimilar metal
transfer of tantalum to the specimens. Leaching of
minor constituents from the specimens has been
found to be extensive even during short exposures.
In one test the nitrogen content of a 0.001-in.-thick
stainless steel specimen was lowered from 840 to
10 ppm by exposure to lithium at 1600°F for 1 hr.

FUNDAMENTAL MASS TRANSFER STUDIES
J. L. Scott H. W. Leavenworth, Jr.>
Diffusion of Nickel in Liquid Lead

A better understanding of the process of diffusion
in liquids is essential to the understanding of the
mass transfer process, since the rate of mass
transfer in a liquid-metal system may possibly be
a function of the rate of diffusion of the solute in
the solvent. Often the rate of diffusion which is of
primary importance is the rate in a nearly saturated
boundary layer. In solids the rate of diffusion may
be quite sensitive to concentration, and possibly
the rate of diffusion in saturated liquids is different
from that in dilute solutions. [f so, the activation
energy for the diffusion step in the mass transfer
process could be much higher than the activation
energy obtained from measurements of the self-
diffusion of the solvent or of dilute solutions. In
order to determine whether the diffusion coefficient
is a function of temperature, measurements were
made of the diffusion coefficients of nickel in lead
in both saturated and dilute solutions at a series
of temperatures. (For these experiments a dilute
solution is defined as one containing 50% or less
of the saturation concentration of nickel.)

The capillary-reservoir technique was used for
these studies. A capillary was filled with a lead-
nickel alloy, and then the open end of the capillary
was placed in contact with a bath of pure lead.
After a predetermined length of time, the capillary
was removed from the pure lead and was quenched.
After the alloy was removed from the capillary it
was sectioned into 12 to 15 pieces which were then
chemically analyzed. The same procedure was
used for both saturated and dilute lead-nickel
alloys.

The results were reported in terms of nickel
concentration as a function of the distance along

 

50n assignment from Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

the capillary. Typical results are presented in
Fig. 3.4.7, which gives the concentration divided
by the saturation concentration as a function of
the distance along the capillary divided by the
length of the capillary. The saturation concentra-
tion was obtained by analysis of samples taken
from quenched, saturated solutions and is presented
in Fig. 3.4.8. The heat of solution calculated from
the slope of this curve is 6740 cal/mole.

which is the length of the capillary, while ¢, is
the concentration at t = 0. Three curves from this
family are shown as solid lines in Fig. 3.4.7, along
with the data obtained for 405, 412, and 481°C.
The Dt/12 values for 412 and 481°C are 0.092 and
0.23, respectively, and the corresponding D values
are 39.33 x 1075 and 70.16 x 107° cm?/sec. The
data for 405°C do not correspond to any curve of
this family except at the closed end of the capillary
tube near x = 0, as shown by the dotted line of
Fig. 3.4.7. This nonconformity is believed to be
due to slow cooling of the capillary, which caused
the lead-nickel alloy to homogeneize. Nevertheless,
a value of D can be obtained by integrating Eq. 1
from x =0 to x = [ and obtaining an equation for the
average concentration of nickel in the whole
capillary. This equation is

where C is the average concentration of nickel in
the capillary. A value of Dt/I? equal to 0.077 is
then obtained, and the corresponding D value is

A preliminary plot of log D values versus 1/T is
shown in Fig. 3.4.9. The data shown were obtained
with the saturated liquid; data are not yet available

used for engineering tests. The plug that was too
long required no grinding on either the inner or
outer surfaces.

The second plug was pressed very recently and
has not yet been ground. Some grinding will be
required on the outer surface because there was a
slight reaction between the Hastelloy C and the
graphite die.

Thermal Shielding

The shield plug assembly is to include a very
low-conductivity material for use as o thermal
barrier. Zirconia has been reported to have the
lowest thermal conductivity of any commercially
available ceramic, but the dependence of its
thermal conductivity on density was not known.
Battelle Memorial Institute was requested to
determine the relationship between thermal conduc-
tivity and density for sintered Zr02, and three
specimens of cold-pressed and sintered, stabilized
ZrO2 were prepared for the study. The specimens
had densities of 3.08, 3.52, and 4.41 g/cm3. The
determinations were made by standard, steady-
state, guarded-temperature-gradient techniques,
and the data obtained, plotted in Fig. 3.5.1, show
the thermal conductivity to be very low in the
density range considered.

Three full-size zirconia disks were cold pressed,
sintered to a density of approximately 3.25 g/cm3,
and machined for use in shield plug assemblies.

Recrystallization Studies

Specimens 10 to 15 mils thick were prepared from
arc-cast and powder-metallurgy niobium for re-
crystallization studies. Reductions of 20, 50, 80,
90, 95, and 97% in thickness were used in the
preparation of the specimens by cold rolling.
The specimens are to be annealed at 900, 1050,
1200, and 1350°C for 36 sec, 6 min, 1 hr, 10 hr,
and 100 hr. X-ray and metallographic techniques
will be utilized to determine the rates of recovery
and recrystallization.

A rapid-heat, rapid-quench vacuum furnace was
designed and built for the recrystallization treat-
ments at the short times of 36 sec and 6 min. |In
this apparatus a funnel-shaped ceramic hearth is

funnel; vertical motion of the rod opens the hole
and allows a small specimen to fall through. By
magnetic manipulation of a push rod, the speci-
mens are dropped onto the hot hearth and held
there until released. Upon release, the specimen
falls onto a water-cooled copper hearth. The
time required for heating and cooling does not
exceed a few seconds.

Consolidation of Pellets

An experimental quantity of niobium pellets,
2 |b, was obtained from the Electro Metallurgical
Company for evaluation and use in developmental
work. An arc melt of these pellets was prepared,
but it was too hard and brittle to be of value.
The oxygen content increased from 0.09 to 0.14%
during melting, and the melt had an as-cast
hardness of about 250 VHN, as compared with a
hardness of 170 VHN for the castings prepared at
Battelle Memorial Institute.

Another technique considered for consolidating
the pellets was extrusion. Approximately 600 g
of the material was canned in a stainless steel
billet, preheated at 2300°F, and
extruded at a ratio of 10:1. The can was then
split and stripped off. The extruded niobium rod
is shown in Fig. 3.5.2; the trailing end of the rod
was sized by cold swaging. A short section of the
front end of the rod was later cold swaged to
0.125-in.-dia wire, without annealing, for a total
reduction of 97%. The rod and the swaged wire are
being examined and evaluated.

Yttrium Metal Production

In an initial experimental preparation of yttrium
metal by the reduction of yttrium trifluoride, the
method developed by O. N. Carlson at the Ames
Laboratory, lowa State College, was tried. A
1000-g charge of the trifluoride was reduced with
calcium in the presence of magnesium and calcium
chloride in a retort that had a zirconium crucible
and a grophite liner. The friable slag separated
cleanly from the yttrium alloy and also was easily

The yttrium-magnesium-calcium alloy was broken
into 3/“-in. pieces under an argon atmosphere and
transferred to a tantalum crucible. Vacuum distil-
lation of the magnesium and calcium from the
alloy was attempted; however, the retort failed
and the yttrium alloy became severely contaminated.

In cooperation with Chemistry Division personnel,
a new reduction process was then outlined. It was
thought that, if LiF plus sufficient MgF
the low-melting-point Y-Mg alloy were added during
the fluorination of the Y _O. to lower the melting
point of the fluoride mixture, liquid-phase purifi-
cation of the fluoride charge to a very low oxygen

lithium metal as the reductant would eliminate the
need for CaCl ), and LiF should separate cleanly
from the alloy.

‘The second experiment was an attempt to de-
termine the feasibility of the new process. The
fluoride powders were mixed in the required pro-
portions and lithium metal was used as the re-
ductant. The mixture was heated at 1050°C for
30 min and cooled rapidly. A clean alloy was
produced, and part of it was purified by vacuum
distillation to produce ductile sponge material.
A sample of this sponge material will be vacuum-
induction melted and analyzed.

The fluoride mixture prepared for the next experi-
ment was purified in the liquid state by alternate
treatment with HF and H_,. A small sample of the
mixture will be reduced in a molybdenum crucible
to determine the feasibility of substituting this
crucible material for tantalum. The major portion,
about 1000 g, of the fluoride will be reduced, as
before, in a tantalum crucible.

Test specimens machined from solid bar stock
or cast ingots were used for determining the rate of
permeation of hydrogen through metals. The test
specimen was heated in a furnace and hydrogen
was supplied to one side of the diaphragm at a
constant pressure. The opposite side was evacu-
ated with a Toepler pump, and the hydrogen that
permeated the diaphragm was collected and
measured,

FABRICATION OF MOLYBDENUM TUBING
M. R. D’Amore

The fabrication of molybdenum tubing for use in
corrosion tests and as moderator-canning material
is being studied. In order to gain experience in
fabricating molybdenum and as a step in the
development of molybdenum tubing, several billets
of molybdenum and molybdenum-containing alloys
were extruded into rods and tube shells. The
results of the attempts to extrude arc-cast mo-
lybdenum billets, which were of poor quality, are
presented in Table 3.5.2. Three of the extruded
rods are shown in Fig. 3.5.4. As may be seen the
higher extrusion ratio resulted in fewer cracks.
A fourth billet, KC-163 (not shown), was extruded
at a ratio of 16:1, and there were very few cracks
in the leading and trailing ends.

A first attempt to extrude billet M-1123 as tubing
failed when the billet cooled rapidly and stalled
the press. The billet was then turned down and
canned in mild steel, and in a second attempt it
was successfully extruded at a ratio of 13:1. The
hot-rolled billet was extruded at a ratio of 7:1
without using a mild-steel can.

EXAMINATION OF NaK-TO-FUEL HEAT
EXCHANGERS AFTER SERVICE IN
A TEST STAND

R. J. Gray

Metallographic examinations were made of two
Black, Sivalls & Bryson NaK-to-fuel heat ex-
changers. One of these heat exchangers was of
type IHE-8, which is shown in Fig. 3.6.1, and the
other was of type |HE-3, which is shown in Fig.
3.6.2. These heat exchangers were operated in
the test system shown in Fig. 3.6.3.

The type IHE-8 heat exchanger operated for a
total time of 911 hr at temperatures above 1150°F.
During 503 hr of the operating period the NaK
inlet temperature was 1700°F and the outlet tem-
perature was ~1300°F; the fuel-side temperatures
during this period were 1200°F inlet and 1600°F
outlet. During an additional 44-hr period of non-
isothermal operation the NaK inlet temperature
was 1600°F. The type IHE-3 heat exchanger
operated a total of 1398 hr, including 1008 hr of
nonisothermal operation. Zirconium-base *fluoride
fuel mixtures were circulated in both heat ex-
changers.

Samples were removed from nine positions along
the tube bundle of the heat exchanger in order to
ensure a complete survey of the tube walls.
Samples were also removed from the NaK inlet
and outlet headers. Each tubing sample con-
sisted of one tube, which was split longitudinally
parallel to the flow. Each sample was mounted
for metallographic examination, polished, and
etched, and the depths of mass transfer and cor-
rosion were measured.

The corrosion on the fuel side ranged from
zero in the coolest section to a depth of 0.011
in. in the hottest section. The samples from
these sections are shown in Figs. 3.6.4 and
3.6.5. There were mass-transfer deposits on the
NaK side of the sample from the coolest section
that were up to 0.002 in. thick, but there was
complete absence of corrosion. The general cor-
rosion on the fuel side of the sample from the
hottest portion extended to a depth of 0.004 in.

In previous examinations of heat exchangers, a
difference was found between the depth of cor-
rosion on the tension and compression sides of
the tubing, with the corrosion attack being greater
on the tension side. In this heat exchanger,
however, there was no effect of tension and com-
pression on the depth of the grain boundary
penetration, but the voids were smaller on the
compression side than on the tension side. These
conditions may be seen in Fig. 3.6.7, which
shows an area from the compression side of the

The maximum amount of mass-transferred material
in the NaK circuit was found in the center of the

commercial Inconel pipe (~0.040% C), and ORNL-

The locations of the welds which were examined
are shown in Fig. 3.6.9. All these welds are on
the hot end of the heat exchanger, where the
most severely corrosive conditions existed.

A section of the weld at position 1 of Fig.

was in contact with the fuel. The orientation
of the columnar grains can be seen clearly and
is such that the long axes of the grains are pre-
ponderantly perpendicular to the surface of the
weld. It may be noted, however, that at the sur-
face of the weld there are columnar grains whose
long axes are, for the most part, parallel to the
weld surface. The type of corrosion found in this
weld section is shown in Fig. 3.6.11. The attack
is characteristic of the attack of fuel on Inconel,

aries. This may be explained on the basis of the
segregation associated with a cast structure. As
a result of grain orientation, the attack progressed
a short distance (maximum depth of about 0.007
in.) into the weld, and then paralleled the weld
surface.

A crater found in the weld at position 1 is
shown in Fig. 3.6.12. The outstanding feature
of this section is that the long axes of some of
the columnar grains intersect the weld surface.
This condition results in much deeper penetration
of the corrosive attack into the weld than that
shown in Fig. 3.6.11, where the attack was to
a depth of 7 mils in contrast to the 12 mils shown
in Fig. 3.6.12. The crater found in the weld at
position 2 and shown in Fig. 3.6.13 reveals that
the crater at position 1 was not an isolated
occurrence. As shown in Fig. 3.6.13 the crater
in the weld at position 2 had structure that was
similar to that of the crater in the weld at position

1 and the attack was to about the same depth
(maximum depth of about 16 mils). ‘
The intersection of two successive cover passes
may also produce an unfavorable grain orientation
in a weld. Such a situation is illustrated in Fig.
3.6.14, which shows the intersection of two cover
passes in the weld at position 2. Again, the
unfavorable grain orientation led to deep inter-
granular penetration to a depth of about 13 mils.
As required by the assembly procedure, the
fuel side of the weld at position 3 was machined
even with the surface of the surrounding base
metal. Such a machining operation removes the
horizontally aligned surface grains and exposes
the unsuitably oriented subsurface grains to cor-
rosive attack. Two areas on the fuel side of the
weld at position 3 show, in Figs. 3.6.15 and
3.6.16, the result of the absence of the properly
oriented surface layer. Attack to a maximum

depth of about 16 mils may be seen.

The relative depth of corrosion attack in weld
and base metal can be seen in Fig. 3.6.17, which
shows the interface of the weld metal and the
base metal on the fuel side of the weld at position
2. It appears that the cast structure of weld
metal, with its intergranular segregation, is more
susceptible to attack than the base metal.

The fuel side of the weld at position 4 was
exposed under different conditions in that the
weld was in contact with stagnant fuel at a tem-
perature of 1700°F, The attack of the weld metal
under this condition is shown in Fig. 3.6.18.
The maximum depth of penetration of the base
metal was 5 mils, whereas the weld metal was
attacked to a maximum depth of 16 mils. It is
evident that even when the weld-metal structure
is properly oriented, it may be subject to severe
corrosion under extreme operating conditions.

It thus appears that in high-temperature cor-
rosive environments the structural orientation

of the weld metal is an important factor in its
corrosion resistance. Most carefully made welds
in the as-welded condition appear to have a
surface layer which is oriented in such a way as
to minimize the depth of corrosive attack. If
this surface layer is removed, as by machining,
the improperly oriented subsurface grains will be
exposed to the corrosive environment and the
corrosion rate may be expected to increase.

3.7« NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING
R. B. Oliver

METAL-IDENTIFICATION METER

R. B. Oliver J. W. Allen
R. A. Nance

The possibility that alloys other than Inconel
might inadvertently be used in the fabrication of
the ART and the ETU prompted the development
of a simple, portable, nondestructive test instru-
ment for distinguishing Inconel from other alloys,
such as the austenitic stainless steels, nickel,
and the commercial Hastelloys. Conductivity
appeared to be the best single property on which
to base the identification. Although several
commercial instruments are available for making
conductivity measurements, none of these instru-
ments possess the desired simplicity and porta-
bility. Therefore an instrument was developed,
which is shown in Fig. 3.7.1 with its associated
probe coil and holder. It is 6 x 9 x 12 in. and
weighs about 13 Ib. It is portable, and its sim-
plicity is evident in that only one knob and one
meter are required for its operation.

UNCLASSIFIED
Y2242

 

Fig. 3.7.1. Metal-ldentification Meter.

256

The instrument consists of an oscillator, in
which the inductance of the probe coil and the
capacitance of the calibrating control are the
frequency determining elements, and a sharply
tuned, fixed-frequency, indicating circuit. The
inductance of the probe coil is affected by the
amount of eddy-current flow in the part being
inspected, and, since the inductance varies with
the conductivity, the frequency variation of the
instrument is a measure of the conductivity of the
part. If the probe is placed on a sample and the
calibrating control is adjusted for the maximum
meter deflection, the frequency of the oscillator
will be that for which the circuit is tuned. I[f the
probe is then placed on a sample of different
conductivity, the inductance and also the frequency
of the circuit are changed and the meter no longer
deflects to a maximum value. If the conductivity
of the second sample is much different from that
of the sample for which the instrument is adjusted,
there will be no meter deflection. The range of
conductivity covered by the meter deflection was
adjusted to be the same as the range of conduc-
tivity observed for the various lots of Inconel
available.

The unique design feature of this instrument is
that the magnitude of the indicating meter de-
flection is of no particular importance; hence,
amplitude-determining variables, such as changes
in the electronic tubes, changes in the power
supply, or any other fluctuation, have no effect
on the accuracy of the reading. This design
gives stable, reliable, drift-free operation.

The metal-identification meter can be used to
best advantage as a conductivity comparator,
because it is sensitive to test conditions and
metal specimen conditions other than the electrical
conductivity of the specimen. Since the test
measures the change of inductance produced by
the flow of eddy current in the specimen, it is
inherently sensitive to the amount of separation
between the metal surface and the base of the
probe; thus, the test will be affected by the
curvature of the metal surface and by the physical
condition of the surface. These considerations
cause no difficulty if a reference standard is used
that has the same curvature and the same surface
conditions as the part to be identified. The use
of eddy currents for metal identification is also
affected by the .thickness of the metal specimen if
the thickness is less than the effective depth of
eddy-current penetration; the effective depth of
penetration is a function of the conductivity of the
metal, the frequency of operation, and the charac-
teristics of the coil used. No particular difficulty
is experienced if a reference standard is used that
has the same thickness, the same surface, and the
same curvature as the metal being identified.
The probe is contained in a spring-loaded holder
which gives stable and reproducible coil-to-metal
coupling.

Conductivity cannot, as is true for any single
interrogation, establish a unique identification of
a metal, since conductivity varies with differences
in chemical, mechanical, and thermal history.
Also, it is possible for more than one alloy to
have the same conductivity., |f the choice of
alloys is limited, however, or if a second interro-
gation is possible, no confusion should result
from the similarity of conductivities for several
different alloys.

If there is a future demand for more of these
instruments, it is considered possible to redesign
the circuits to use transistors. Thus, the instru-
ment could be made smaller, and it would be
independent of a source of alternating-current
power; hence, it would be truly portable. In the
construction of subassemblies for the ETU and
ART, the use of the metal-identification meter has
revealed, on two different occasions, the presence
of lengths of austenitic stainless steel pipe in
lines that were supposed to contain only Inconel.

EDDY-CURRENT MEASUREMENTS
OF METAL THICKNESS

J. W. Allen R. A. Nance

The study of the measurement of cladding
thickness for the Mark X MTR fuel plates by
eddy-current methods, which was reported previ-
ously,! was expanded into a general study of
eddy-current measurement of both metal thickness
and cladding thickness. Laboratory measurements
were made to determine the changes in the
impedance of probe coils as a result of changes in
conductivity, changes in the thickness of the part
being inspected, changes in the test frequency,
and changes in the lift-off or coil coupling. These

studies will guide the choice of operating pa-
rameters for future eddy-current thickness measure-
ments, The impedance of a probe coil as a
function of conductivity, with frequency as a
parameter, is plotted in Fig. 3.7.2. Similarly
shaped curves were drawn to describe impedance
changes as a function of test frequency or of
thickness. Two impedance curves plotted as
functions of test frequency are shown in Fig. 3.7.3
for an alloy containing 48% U~52% Al and for
6061 aluminum alloy, which are the core and the
cladding materials, respectively, of the Mark X
fuel plate. These curves have the same general
shape as the curves in Fig. 3.7.2, in which
conductivity is the independent variable.

The change in impedance as a function of
thickness is illustrated in Fig. 3.7.4, as de-
termined at 20 kc with 6061 aluminum alloy. The
point of apparent infinite thickness describes a
section thicker than the effective depth of pene-
tration of the eddy current. This infinite thickness,
approximately 50 mils, is a function of the conduc-
tivity of the specimen, the frequency used, and the
size and shape of the field of the probe coil.
At the present time there are no known means for
predicting the depth of penetration of the eddy
current in a particular alloy. The effect of lift-off
or coil coupling is also shown in Fig. 3.7.4. The
lift-off curve has the same characteristic shape,
regardless of the thickness of the specimen, and
its shape is complex in that there are at least two

The complex shapes of these

observed to vary.

Cladding thickness measurements with eddy
currents also utilize the impedance changes of a
probe coil, but the changes are caused by the
presence of the two metals. An example of this
is illustrated in Fig. 3.7.5, which is a plot of the
impedance changes produced at 20 kc both by
various thicknesses of copper on a thick base of

these results it is concluded that there are two
types of cladding thickness measurements: the
first is similar to a simple thickness measurement,
and the cladding is the better conductor of the two
materials; the second is similar to the lift-off
measurement, and the cladding is the poorer
conductor of the couple.  Another interesting
comparison is afforded by Fig. 3.7.5; the apparent
infinite thickness of copper is only 0.030 in. at
20 ke, while the apparent infinite thickness of
Inconel is 0.130 in. This observation indicates
the approximate effect of conductivity on depth
of penetration of the eddy currents and it also
indicates the range of thickness for which accurate
measurements can be made at 20 kc. These
studies will be continued to lay a foundation for

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

the future application of eddy-current measurements
to the evaluation of thin sections of cladding or
shroud assemblies and to the measurement of the
thickness of the outer ply of duplex tubing.

ULTRASONIC INSPECTION
R. W. McClung
Tubing

Both immersed-ultrasound and encircling-coil
eddy-current methods were used to inspect approxi-
mately 10,000 ft of tubing ranging in size from
?’/]6-in.-OD, 0.025-in.-wall to %-in.-OD, 0.065-in.-
wall Inconel and Hastelloy tubing. Rejection
rates in most lots were dependent upon the
minimum length of tubing which could be used for
the intended service. For large batches of tubing
the rejection rate was as low as 2%, and, for some
very small lots, 100% rejection occurred. The
average rejection rate for all lots was about 10%.

One of the most severe cracks found is illus-
trated in Fig. 3.7.6, which shows an0.018-in.-deep
crack in the wall of a ¥-in.-OD, 0.035in.-wall
Hastelloy B tube. This crack extended through
about 50% of the wall. A defect common to this
lot of Hastelloy B weld-drawn tubing was the
laminar, internal crack shown in Fig. 3.7.7. Such
laminar cracks were detected by the immersed-
ultrasound method which is not generally con-
sidered to be capable of detecting defects that
are parallel to the direction of propagation of the
ultrasound.

Pipe

Approximately 600 ft of Inconel pipe was in-
spected by the immersed-ultrasound method with a
rejection rate of less than 1% based on a defect
size of 5% of the wall thickness. These lots
ranged in size from 3/8-in. sched -40 to 5-in.
sched -40 pipe.

Wall thickness measurements were made on
several lots of this pipe. The resonance ultrasound
method was used, along with the scanning equip-
ment used for the immersed-ultrasound inspection
of pipe. Direct correlation was obtained between
the wall thickness measured with micrometers in
accessible areas. Approximately 10% of this pipe
was rejected for critical use because of eccen-
tricity greater than 5% of the wall thickness.
Where the need exists for precise measurement of
wall thickness, this method seems to be very

spection is the Vidigage, which is illustrated in
Fig. 3.7.8. When the instrument is properly
calibrated, pipe and tube-wall thicknesses may be
measured to the nearest 0.001 in. at any point
along the pipe or tube surface.

Plate

The immersed-ultrasound technique was used on
approximately 400 ft2 of Inconel plate ranging in
thickness from ¥ to 1 in. Some of this plate was
of the size for intended use, and hence any re-
jectable defect was cause to reject the entire
piece. The rejection rate for this plate was
therefore high, being 30%. The plate that was to
be used in a size smaller than that of the plate
that was being inspected was marked so that
defective areas could be avoided and sections of
the proper size could be cut from the plate. In
these cases the rejection rate was quite low.
A typical defect detected in a plate is the internal
crack shown in Fig. 3.7.9. The crack was ac-
centuated for the photograph with the use of a
fluorescent-dye penetrant. It is about % _ in. wide
and 1 in. long, and it is located at the center of a
]/2-in.-'rhick CX-900 Inconel plate.

. PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

One of the unresolved problems in the inspection
of Inconel plate is the wide variation in ultrasonic
attenuation from one lot of plate to the other or
from one location in a plate to some other location.
It is possible that excessive attenuation may
indicate the presence of defective material, and
therefore high attenuation is normally considered
cause for rejection. However, it is equally
possible that the attenuation may be evidence of a
fine dispersion of precipitated carbides, which
might have resulted from holding the plate too
long within the temperature range of 1300 to
1400°F. This type of excessive attenuation of the
ultrasound is not valid cause for rejection. It is
unfortunate that, at the present time, no means
exist to differentiate between the presence of
defective material and the presence of such a
precipitate. For example, the microstructures of
two different CX-900 Inconel plates are shown in
Fig. 3.7.10. These two plates were inspected at a
high frequency, 25 Mc. One of the plates showed
very severe attenuation of the ultrasonic energy,
and the other plate showed very low attenuation.
The plate having the high attenuation for ultra-
sound, when viewed at a magnification of 1000,
revealed the presence of a very fine precipitate;
while the plate which exhibited good sound-
conducting properties showed very little of the
fine precipitate.

MTR In-Pile Loop No. 6

The radioactive portion of in-pile loop No. 6 is
being disassembled and examined. This loop,
described previously,! was inserted in the MTR
on September 3, 1956, and was removed on September
15 as a result of a long series of difficulties that
culminated in pump malfunctioning and apparent
breakage of the heat exchanger sniffer tube. The
break in the sniffer line was located on the sniffer
U-tube on the nose outlet side where the tube was
welded to the sniffer sieeve. The break occurred
in the heat-affected zone immediately above the
weld.

The hole shown in Fig. 4.1.1 was found at a bend
in the Calrod heater on the heat exchanger at a
point about 10 in. from the electrical connector
end. The hole was apparently caused by arcing
between the heater wire and the sheath,

As in the in-pile loop pumps examined previously,2
there was a colored amorphous deposit in the
forward bellows, as shown in Fig. 4.1.2. The
rotating copper block was also thinly coated with
a deposit similar to that found in the forward
bellows, and its surface was scratched, as shown
in Fig. 4.1.3. The scratches were probably caused
by fuel particles.

A considerable amount of fuel was found in the
reduced-diameter region immediately behind the
shaft slinger (that is, the region between the pump
sump and the bearing housing), as shown in Fig.
4,.1.4. The presence of fuel in this region was
probably the major cause of the pump speed varia-
tions noted during operation of the loop. The pump
shaft was abraded in this region, as shown in
Fig. 4.1.5.

The fuel level in the pump sump was higher than
expected, but the level could not be determined
accurately because some of the fuel was lost
during disassembly. The presence of fuel in the
split vent line, shown in Figs. 4.1.6 and 4.1.7,
indicates that the level was higher than the vent-
line entrance.

MTR Experiments

The first of a series of tube-burst, stress-rupture
tests of Inconel in a helium atmosphere was con-
ducted in the MTR with the use of the apparatus
described praviously.? Eight specimens were
exposed simultaneously at 1500°F at three stress
levels, and specimens with two different wall
thicknesses, 0.030 and 0.050 in., were used to
determine the effect of wall thickness on stress-
rupture characteristics.

Operation of the apparatus was,
satisfactory for a first test.

in general,
Temperature control
to within £15°F was attained during initial opera-
tion, but later in the test when less attention
could be devoted to adjustments the spread in the
temperature readings was 1t25°F, The gamma-ray
heating was found to be higher than had been
anticipated at the start of the cycle, and some over-
heating under partial stress occurred. The plug
was refracted to reduce the gamma-ray heating,
and control at 1500°F was achieved. It was
found that the gamma-ray heating is not constant
during a reactor cycle; it is highest at the be-
ginning of a new cycle and decreases with time.

The full extent of the effect of irradiation on the
stress-rupture properties cannot be evaluated
until out-of-pile tests under identical stress and
temperature conditions are completed, because the
stress-temperature cycle in the reactor included
two l-hr periods at 1700°F at a stress of 1500 psi
(maximum) in the presence of the full reactor flux
during boiling tests before the start of the regular
reactor cycle. All the specimens were held at
1500°F (no flux) for 48 hr under the same pressure
before startup of the MTR and application of the
test stresses. The rupture times observed were
15 hr at 5000 psi for two 0.030-in.-wall specimens,
an average of 25 hr at 4000 psi for two 0.030-in.-
wall specimens and two 0.050-in.-wall specimens,
and 78 hr at 3000 psi for two 0.030-in.-wall speci-
mens. These rupture times are an order of magni-
tude shorter than those observed in previous out-

of-pile tests,® Out-of-pile tests that will duplicate
the time-temperature-stress cycle of the MTR tests,
including the high-temperature excursion, are to
be conducted.

LITR Experiments

Two tube-burst tests in which stressed tubes
were immersed in the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,
(62.5-12.5-25.0 mole %, fuel 46) were conducted in
the LITR. Under a stress of 2000 psi at 1500°F,
rupture times of about 100 hr were observed for
0.010-in.-wall tubing, although in at least one of
the two specimens the rupture appears to have taken
place in the fuel container rather than in the
specimen, Both experiments were terminated be-
cause of fuel leakage and high activity. Interpre-
tation of the results must await inspection in the
hot cells.

sufficient volume and strength to accommodate the
accessory equipment necessary to maintain the
desired sample temperature, to assure rapid,
precisely timed irradiations, and to extensively
monitor the somple while it is being irradiated.

In order to obtain quantitative results from ex-
perimental work on semiconductor components the
characteristics of the sample must be known to a
good degree of accuracy. As a result, considerable
effort is being expended on getting samples of
known characteristics.  Several grown-junction
germanium diodes of known characteristics are
being prepared for this study, and attention has
been turned to the problem of obtaining diffused-
junction samples.  The feasibility of making
diffused junctions has been established with the
use of rudimentary apparatus.

One experiment is now in progress in which
diffused-junction germanium diodes are being
bombarded in the fast-flux facility of the west
animal tunnel of the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
Forward and reverse characteristics are being
studied as a function of radiation and as a function
of temperature in the range ~78°C to about 25°C,
Changes in the diode characteristics as a function
of annealing treatment are also being studied. A
multirange recorder is being used so that data can
be taken continuously in order to eliminate the
possibility of changes going unnoticed during
nonworking hours or when personnel are otherwise
occupied.

Two IN 30-A diodes were bombarded in a 2.8 x
106 r/hr Co®® gamma-ray source. The samples
were selected to have as nearly as possible the
same characteristics, as indicated by their forward
and reverse conductivity curves on an ‘‘X-Y'
recorder. The container of one of the samples,
sample G, was filled with a protective grease,
while the container of the other sample, sample N,
was not. Another factor that may have a bearing

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

on the results is the age of a sample. |t is sus-
pected that the ungreased sample was a year or two
older than the greased sample, and the rapid
progress being made in diode manufacturing tech-
niques may make this age difference important.

The temperature was monitored with a thermo-
couple attached to the common wire of the samples,
and a plot of the temperature variations was made.
The initial rise in temperature was the result of
the ambient air temperature being somewhat lower
before bombardment than the temperature of the
irradiation facility. After bombardment was started
there were no temperature variations of more than
1°C; there was a drop of about 1°C at a point
corresponding to an irradiation of 1.2 x 107 r
(Fig. 4.1.12). The possible significance of this
temperature variation is discussed below. Reverse
characteristic curves were plotted from which
plots of the following characteristics were taken:
(1) reverse current at 1v, which is the total current
through the sample; (2) the slope of the reverse
current curve, which gives the portion of the total
current that can be attributed to surface leakage;

rent with the Y axis, which is indicative of the
portion of the current that flows through the bulk
of the sample. The techniques used in establishing
these plots were described previously.’ '
Within minutes after the irradiation had begun,
it was seen that for the greased sample the reverse
current at 1 v had increased from a nominal value
of 1 x 10~% to about 5 x 10> amp and then nearly
returned to the previous value. The validity of
this indicated sudden increase was shown by the
measurements taken immediately afterward (Fig.
4.1.13), which indicated that previous values had
been higher. An increase and decrease of reverse
current for this type of diode were observed pre-
viously.® In the previous instance, two IN 38-A
diodes were irradiated at gamma-ray dose rates of

2 x 10 and 2.5 x 10° r/hr, respectively. Both
showed maximums, or reverse current, at 1.75 x
107 +.

‘The data plotted in Fig. 4.1.13 are replotted in
Fig. 4.1.14 and extended to include doses of up to
4,72 x 107 r. It is significant that, although the
reverse conductivity of the greased unit (sample G)
was less than that of the ungreased unit (sample N)
for a considerable portion of the irradiation, the
conductivities were the same at about 2.5 x 107 r,
and at 4.72 x 107 ¢ the conductivity of the greased
unit was greater than that of the ungreased unit,
The change in the conductivity of the greased unit
at approximately 1.2 x 107 r was shown in the
plotting of Fig. 4.1.14 because it corresponds to
the 1°C temperature drop shown in Fig. 4.1.12 and
may possibly be attributed to it. The portions of
the total current flow that can be attributed to the
bulk and to the surface of the sample are shown
in Figs. 4.1.15 and 4.1.16. Further study of the
results of this experiment must be made before
conclusions can be drawn,

EFFECT OF RADIATION ON THERMAL-
NEUTRON SHIELD MATERIALS

J. G. Morgan

Radiation damage studies of thermal-neutron
shield materials were continued in the MTR and
LITR facilities. High-density boron carbide sam-
ples were irradiated at 345°F to twice the maxi-
mum B0 burnup expected in the ART. The samples
retained dimensional stability and structural in-
tegrity. An irradiation test was started on a pro-
totype sample from an ART tile, This sample will
be maintained at 1500°F during irradiation.

A prototype sample of the plates of stainless-
steel-clad copper-B,C cermet for use in the ART
was irradiated in the MTR at 1600°F to an esti-
mated 18% B'0 burnup. The sample has been
returned to ORNL for examination.

Samples of a stainless-steel-clad BN-Ni cermet
that is being considered for future shielding use
were irradiated in the LITR ot 345°F, These
samples showed good dimensional stability after
up to 19% average B'® burnup, but gross cracking
occurred when they were irradiated at <175°F to an
estimated 38% average B'? burmup (Fig. 4.1.17).

ESTIMATES OF AIR-BORNE ACTIVITY AS A
RESULT OF LEAKAGE OF FUEL FROM A
CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR

M. T. Robinson

Estimates have been made of the maximum pos-
sible extent of production of air-borne radioactivity
in the event of leakage of fuel from a circulating-
fuel aircraft reactor onto the ground in a coherent
mass or into the air as a more-or-less fine spray.
In making these estimates the leakage of inter-
mediate fluids, such as the sodium and NaK
coolants and the shield water, and the possible
mixing of these fluids with the fuel were not con-
sidered. = The amount of air-borne radioactivity
that would result from leakage of the fuel onto the
ground would be governed primarily by the rate of
heat transfer from the fuel mass to the surrounding
air and earth. As discussed below, rapid macro-
scopic boiling of the fuel would probably occur,
and the chemical reactions that would probably
result from the boiling of the fuel in air would
cause most of the radioactive content of the fuel
to become air-borne. If the fuel leaked from an
airplane into the air, the fission products would,

of course, become air-borne as they escaped from

the reactor,
In analyzing the situation in which the fuel

leaked onto the ground, it was considered that the
fuel which had leaked from the core vessel was
heated by the radicactive decay of the fission
products contained in the fuel and that heat was
being lost by conduction to the earth and by radia-
tion and convection to the atmosphere. It was
assumed that the fuel mass could be considered to
be a right cylinder, with one end radiating to the
atmosphere and the other in contact with the
earth, but this problem was intractable by analyti-
cal and analog methods. The fuel mass was there-
fore taken to be spherical and to contain not only
a volume heat source from radioactive decay of

272

Portion of Current That Flowed Through the Bulk of the IN 38-A Germanium Diodes During

fission products but, also, a volume heat sink that
was at every point proportional to the fuel tem-
perature.  This heat sink would behave in the
same way as radiation from the end of the cylinder
would.  The correlation between the cylindrical
and spherical models was established by matching
the earth-contact surfaces of the two figures and
by relating the strength of the spherical volume
heat sink to the area of the cylindrical air-contact
surface.

The resulting differential equation describing the
fuel temperature was solved on the Reactor Controls
Analog Computer for several different values of
P_, the total gamma-ray heating in the fuel, and of
x, the length-to-diameter ratio of the cylindrical

fuel mass. The analog calculations showed that

It is also possible to estimate the diameter of a
spherical particle of fuel which would remain at
a constant temperature, because the heating from
radioactive decay of the fission products would be
just balanced by the radiative heat losses from the

The heat transfer calculations showed that,
except for very small particles and for very shallow
puddles, the fuel would boil rapidly as long as
more than about 5 Mw of gamma-ray heating power
remained in the fuel. The hot fuel-salt vapor
would be expected to react rapidly with the water

The nature of the soil would determine the exact
reactions with components of the fuel, but reactions
of the following types could be expected:

ZrF4 + SiO2 = ZrO2 + SiF4 (gas)

Such reactions would permeate the soil, at least
locally, with high concentrations of uranium,
zirconium, and fission products, as oxides, with
the release of equivalent amounts of volatile
aluminum and silicon compounds. Such reactions
would be favored in loose, moist, sandy soils.

The balance between air-borne dusts and soil-
fixed components cannot be predicted with assur-
ance, since it depends rather strongly on local
soil and (possibly) meterological conditions., [t
seems likely, however, that major portions of the

It appears unlikely that efficient fractionation of

LITR VERTICAL IN-PILE LOOP

M. F. Osborne
D. E. Guss H. E. Robertson
J. E. Lee, Jr. R. P. Shields

The vertical in-pile loop, described previously!'?
and shown here in Figs. 4.1.20 and 4.1.21, operated
in the LITR with the reactor operating for 235 hr,
including 207 hr at full power, The total operating
time for the loop was 332 hr. The loop was
fabricated of Inconel and was filled with the fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (60.8-27.4-11.8 mole %),
and at full reactor power the operating conditions
were the following:

R. E. Adams

Maximum fuel temperature 1600°F
Temperature drop in fuel 250°F
Reynolds number 3000
Maximum power density 500 w/cm
Dilution factor 7.3

Total power 9000 w

The values for total power and maximum power
density are based on estimates of flux, flux dis-
tribution, and flux depression derived from meas-
urements made in the same and adjacent positions
in the LITR at other times and measurements made
during earlier in-pile loop tests of shorter duration.
Flux measurements of more direct applicability
will be obtained when this loop is dismantled.
The total power of 9000 w derived from the flux
measurements is in agreement with the estimate
obtained from an experimental heat balance.

The various components of the loop worked satis-
factorily, except that after the first 100 hr the
torque load on the pump motor began to increase,
presumably because of radiation damage of the
organic lubricant in the bearings. By the end of
125 hr of in-pile operation the pump turned more
freely again, but there was intermittent chattering,
Apparently the damaged grease had worked out of
the bearing and it was operating dry. The most

radiafiofi-tresistant grease available was used;
it consisted of an alkyldiphenyl-base grease with
a thickener compounded by the California Research
Corporation. An attempt had been made to esti-
mate, in advance, the dosage rate the grease would
receive, but because of uncertainties in diffusion
times for short-lived fission gases the grease
lifetime could be predicted no more closely than a
few factors of 10, The behavior observed is not
inconsistent with the rough estimates. Operation
of the loop was terminated by stalling of the pump,
probably because of bearing seizure.

The thermocouples performed satisfactorily ex-
cept in the regions where the highest temperature
gradient was developed. Thermocouple failures in
these regions occurred at the time the temperature
gradient appeared during reactor startup. Pre-
sumably distortion of the loop caused by differ-
ential thermal expansion resulted in deformation
of the thermocouple leads. The thermocouple
failures proved to be inconvenient becquse they
interrupted reactor operation, but they did not halt
loop operation because of the multiplicity of thermo-
couples originally provided. Twenty-two of the 55
thermocouples failed. '

The variable-speed induction motor powered by
a variable-frequency motor generator made possible
continued operation of the pump even against high
torque loads. The dynamic microphone and rotating
magnet tachometer, both of special radiation-
resistant design, proved to be of great value in
monitoring motor operation, and they performed
without flaws. The heaters used to melt the fuel
and keep it molten during reactor shutdowns sur-
vived the test well — only 14 of the 80 heating
elements failed and one-half the heaters, properly
distributed, would have been sufficient for opera-
tion. The automatic temperature control system
which regulated the cooling air was adequate. The
provision for regulating the fraction of cooling air
passing over each leg of the loop proved to be
useful. It was intended to maximize the tempera-
ture drop by using this adjustment, but the tempera-
ture drop was suppressed deliberately to reduce
thermocouple damage. The safety system, which
was designed to automatically take protective
action of various kinds when certain abnormal
conditions existed, performed very well.

The loop operated for a sufficiently long time
to yield useful corrosion information. It will be

FLUX MONITORING OF MTR STATIC
CORROSION CAPSULES

D. E. Guss

Four methods have been used with some success
for monitoring the thermal flux during the irradia-
tion in the MTR of Inconel capsules filled with
static zirconium-base fluoride fuel mixtures, The
methods have consisted of the measurement of
the activity of the Co%% and Cr3! produced by the
activation of the cobalt and the chromium in the
Inconel capsule and the measurement of the Zr??
and the Cs'37 produced from fission in the fuel.
The thermal fluxes for several capsules based on
the measurements are presented in Table 4.1.1.

Cobalt is 0.115 wt % abundant in the Inconel
stock used to fabricate the capsules. The homo-
geneity of the cobalt was established by activation
analysis and by chemical potentiometric analysis.
The advantages of using cobalt as a thermal-flux
monitor are its long half life, which provides a good
flux integration, and the fact that it is already in
extensive use as a reactor flux monitor, The
primary disadvantage in the use of the cobalt in
Inconel is the presence in irradiated Inconel of
46-day Fe5?, whose gamma rays have energies
almost coincident with those of Co®%. This can
be circumvented by chemically separating the

cobalt from the other constituents of Inconel, by
counting the sum peak of the Co®® gamma rays,
and by waiting for the iron activity to die out.

The separation of cobalt from the other con-
stituents of Inconel has been tried, and meaningful
results have been obtained. The difficulty of the
separation procedure and the fact that the presence
of 70-day Co®® from the Ni®® (n,p) reaction re-
quires discriminatory counting even after separa-
tion make the counting of the sum peak of the Co%°
gamma rays a more desirable method if the determi-
nation is to be made less than a year after dis-
charge from the reactor.

The two gamma rays from Co%® are in cascade,
and there is a prominent sum peak at 2,5 Mev that
results from coincidence counts in the scintillation
crystal, The gamma rays from Fe®?, on the other
hand, are not in cascade, and the coincidence rate
from these gamma rays contributes negligibly to
the sum peak. In fact, it has been found that all
the counts above about 1.7 Mev in irradiated Inconel
can be attributed to Co®?, and the Co®? disinte-
gration rate can be determined by counting above
that energy.

For times greater than a year after discharge
from the reactor the only remaining prominent
activity in Inconel is that of Co®®, and the dis-
integration rate can be found by counting in an
ionization chamber. '

The contribution to the Co®? activity from the
Ni¢® (n,p) reaction is thought to be negligible.
This assumption is being evaluated at the present

time by determining the Co%? disintegration rate
in specimens of high purity nickel which were

irradiated in hole C-46 of the LITR.

The use of trace quantities of cobalt as a thermal
flux monitor would also be possible for the stain-
less steels and the INOR alloys if the homogeneity
of the cobalt was assured.

Chromium has an abundance of about 15 wt % in
Inconel, and the irradiation of Inconel produces a
Cr°' gamma-ray peak at 0.320 Mev. The disinte-
gration rate of Cr®! can be determined by area
analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum. Since Cr>!
has a fairly short half life (26.5 day), it is not so
good a flux integrator as cobalt, and it must be
counted within two or three months after discharge
from the reactor. Also a considerable error is
introduced in the determination of the disintegration
rate by area analysis because of the high back-
ground of the count rate as a result of Compton
scattering gamma rays from the higher energy peaks
present in irradiated Inconel.

The fission yields of Cs'37 and Zr%3 in the fuel
provide direct measurements of fuel burnup. Since
Cs'37 has a long half life it is a good integrator,
but it comes primarily from a xenon precursor which
can escape from the liquid fuel into the dead space
above the fuel. If this happens the Cs'37 plates
out on the walls and is lost. Since there is ro
cesium present naturally in the fuel, small inhomo-
in distribution of the cesium become

The dead space above the fuel in the

geneities
important,
capsules currently being used is quite small, and
the fluxes obtained from Cs'37 measurements
appear to be in agreement with those obtained by
the other methods. In a system in which the rare
gases were removed, Cs'37 would not provide a
useful burnup monitor.

Only a very small fraction, if any, of the Zr®3
yield arises from a rare-gas precursor, and there-
fore the Zr?> cannot escape from the fuel. Also,
since natural zirconium is present in abundance in
the fuel, it is assumed that the Zr?> activity is
uniformly distributed throughout the fuel. The (n,y)
activation of Zr??4 is small enough that it does not
contribute significantly to the Zr?3 activity. The
Zr?3 activity has a fairly short half life (65 day),
however, which somewhat limits its flux integrating
characteristics.,

ANALYSIS OF CHARCOAL FOR ART
OFF-GAS ADSORBER BED

W. E. Browning
R. E. Adams D. E. Guss

Two types of activated charcoal being considered
for use in the ART off-gas adsorber bed were
tested to determine their relative effectiveness in
holding up noble fission gases. Surface area and
pore size were measured by classical adsorption
methods, and dynamic holdup tests were run with
radiokrypton as a tracer. Both sets of measure-
ments showed the two materials to be indistinguish-
able; however, the surface area measurements
indicated that 10% more of the coke charcoal
(Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical Co., BPL grade)
would be required than of the coconut charcoal
(National Carbon Company, Columbia ACA grade).

The physical properties of the two materials are

listed below:

Columbia ACA BPL
Mesh 8-14 6-16
Bulk density, g/cm> 0.49 0.49
Surface areq, '3 m%/g 1390 1277
Pore size, A 16-20 or 16-20 or
smaller smaller

The softness of the BPL-grade charcoal particles
requires that care be exercised in fabricating the
charcoal traps to prevent powdering of the charcoal
particles, The Columbia ACA charcoal would
withstand much greater abuse during trap fabrica-
tion, The almost identical pore sizes indicate
that the two charcoals would have similar gas-
adsorption characteristics.,

Experiments were run to compare the holdup of
radiokrypton from a helium stream by the two char-
coals, The traps used were 13-in, lengths of
2-in. sched-40 pipe filled with 3/4 Ib of the charcoal.
The helium-sweep-gas flow rate was 2440 cm3/min
and each trap was tested at 21°C and at 0°C, The
elution curves obtained at the two temperatures
were consistent. The elution data for the two
types of charcoals tested in traps at 21°C are
shown in Fig. 4.1.22. Both charcoals fit the
proposed holdup model, and a theoretical analysis

tubing will be brought up from the main off-gas
line to the vent house. A slight restriction or
valve will be provided in the off-gas line between
the legs of the loop to create a small pressure drop
which will divert a very small portion of the off-gas
into the loop. Shielding will be required on the
loop, except for a very small opening, which will
be seen by a 5in. sodium iodide crystal and a
photomultiplier tube. The output from the photo-
multiplier tube will be picked up by a preamplifier
and transmitted through a cable to a multichannel
analyzer in the laboratory space. The information
will be presented on a Brown recorder. The off-gas
can be monitored constantly with this equipment
or the activity can be trapped in the small loop to
permit a decay study. It is hoped that a safe method
can be worked out whereby small samples can be
removed from the area for a more detailed analysis
under more favorable conditions.

IRRADIATION OF MODERATOR MATERIALS
IN THE ETR

W, E. Browning R. P. Shields

Preparations are being made for irradiation in
the ETR of moderator materials proposed for use
in high-temperature reactors, and an irradiation
facility for the experiments is being developed.
An irradiation request has been filed with the AEC,
and preliminary discussions have been held with
ETR operating personnel.

In one proposed irradiation apparatus the moder-
ator material capsule would be cooled by air
passing through a water-cooled annulus, that is,
the heat would be transferred from the capsule to
the water-cooled surface by turbulent air. A mock-
up designed to simulate the heating conditions was
constructed. A piece of Inconel tubing 0.875 in.,
in diameter, 0.025 in. in wall thickness, and 2]/2 in,
in length was attached between terminals of a low-
voltage high-current power supply. Midway be-
tween the ends of the Inconel, a section 1.5 in.
long was machined to a 0.010-in.-wall thickness.
This assembly was surrounded by a water jacket
which cleared the 0.010-in.-wall area by 0,047 in,
and the ends by 0.025 in. Provision was made at
one end to drive metered air through the annular
space over the heated section. Temperatures were
measured by thermocouples spot welded to the
inside wall of the 0.010-in. section in three places.
Heat generation was determined from voltage
gradient measurements obtained through the thermo-
couple wires and current measurements obtained
with a clip-on ammeter. Currents of up to 900 amp
were used to heat the simulated capsules. Cooling
air flow rates as high as 25 sctm were tested.

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

The data obtained showed that a beryllium oxide
capsule could be tested in the ETR at a tempera-
ture as low as 800°C with a cooling-air supply of

temperatures,

Configurations OB and OC.

Configurations 25, 26, and 27. — As mentioned
above, all the configurations containing solid
materials were preceded by a ]/4-in. thickness of
Li-Mg alloy. Gamma-ray measurements beyond
configuration 25 (Fig. 5.1.3) show the effect of
replacing a 4'/4-in. thickness of borated water with
the ]/4-in. thickness of Li-Mg alloy plus 4 in, of
beryllium. Measurements beyond configuration 26
were made in order to investigate the producfion
of secondary gamma rays in 4 in. of Hevimet placed
behind the beryllium. (The secondary gamma-ray
production is considered to ke the difference be-
tween the total measured dose rate and the calcu-
lated primary dose rate from the source gamma
rays.) In configuration 27, a l/z-in.-'rhick boral
curtain was placed between the beryllium and the
Hevimet., The slope of the gamma-ray dose rate
beyond this configuration was changed by the
introduction of the boral, which might indicate a
somewhat softér gamma-ray spectrum,

Fast-neutron tissue dose rate measurements
beyond configurations 25, 26, and 27 are presented

Fig. 5.1.3. GammaRay Tissue Dose Rates Beyond Configurations 25, 26, and 27.

Configurations 28, 29, 30, and 31, — Configura-
tions 28 through 31 were tested in order to investi-
gate the contribution of secondary gamma rays
produced in Hevimet to the total dose when the
Hevimet was preceded by boral and followed by
lithium hydride; in addition, these configurations
were designed so that the attenuation of all radia-
tions through lithium hydride could be studied.
The gamma-ray tissue dose rate beyond configura-
tion 28, in which 12 in, of lithium hydride was
added behind the beryllium, was slightly lower
than that beyond configuration 27 at relatively
short distances beyond the configurations and
slightly higher at greater distances (see Fig. 5.1.5).
The reduction at short distances may ke explained
by the fact that the substitution of the lithium
hydride for borated water eliminated the more
plentiful low-energy (]/Z-Mev) boron-capture gamma
rays in this region and produced a significantly

288

smaller number of higher-energy hydrogen-capture
gamma rays. At greater distances the high-
energy gamma rays were still detectable beyond
configuration 28, whereas the lower-energy boron-
capture gamma rays produced in configuration
2/ had already been filtered out. The gamma-ray
tissue dose rate beyond configuration 29, in which
a second 12-in. thickness of lithium hydride was
added, was 40% higher than that beyond configura-
tion 28 (Fig. 5.1.5). The addition of a third 12-in.
thickness of lithium hydride in configuration 30
increased the dose 33% over that measured beyond
configuration 29, These increases can probably
be attributed to the decrease in density of the
thermal-neutron shield from 1.02 g/cm® to 0.75
g/cm’.

In configuration 31, 24 in. of lithium hydride was
placed in front of the 4 in. of Hevimet, The re-
sulting gamma-ray tissue dose rate was a factor of

presence of the stainless steel changed the slope
of the curve for configuration 32 for positions
close to the configuration, but for greater distances
from the source the curve practically coincided
with the one for configuration 27 (no stainless
steel). In configuration 33 the thickness of the
berylliumyreflector-moderator was changed in order
to study the effect of this thickness on the sec-
ondary gamma-ray production in the thermal shield.
The addition of 4 in. of beryllium resulted in a 60%
decrease in the gamma-ray dose rate. In configura-
tion 34 the effect of reducing the thickness of the
Hevimet on the total gamma-ray dose rate was
studied. The gamma-ray dose rate curve was
raised and flattened by the subtraction of 2 in, of
Hevimet from configuration 32; the increase was
about 45% at 50 cm from the source plate and
approximately 90% at 140 cm.

The fast-neutron tissue dose rates measured
beyond configurations 32, 33, and 34 are presented
in Fig. 5.1.7. A comparison of the measurements
beyond configuration 32 with those beyond con-
figuration 27 shows that the addition of the stain-
less steel pressure shell resulted in a slightly
steeper slope in the plot of the data. |t was also
made steeper when the thickness of the beryllium
was doubled in configuration 33, The fast-neutron
dose rate beyond configuration 34, in which the
Hevimet thickness was reduced by 2 in., was
essentially the same as that beyond configuration
32 for distances from the source less than 55 cm;
beyond this distance the curve was raised and

flattened, being 40% higher at 100 cm.

EFFECTIVE FAST-NEUTRON REMOVAL
CROSS SECTION OF HEVIMET

J. M. Miller

During the recent series of tests of advanced
shielding materials (see preceding section),
became possible to measure the effective fast-
neutron removal cross section of Hevimet, Hevimet
is a 90 wt % tungsten—6 wt % nickel -4 wt % copper
alloy with a density of 16.9 to 17.2 g/cm3. The
sample was fabricated from 11 x 7 x 1 in, blocks
glued together to form a slab 5 ft x 5 ft x 2 in,
Two slabs were used in the test to give a total
thickness of 4 in. Each slab was clad with l/4-in.-
thick aluminum sheet on each side. The material
was placed in a medium of plain water at the
source plate end of the configuration tank described
above, and thermal-neutron flux measurements
were made on the axis of the source plate in the
water beyond the material.

The effective removal cross section of the
Hevimet was calculated from the previously pub-
lished formula.® The density was taken to be
17.1 g/cm3 and corrections were made for the
aluminum cladding of the slabs. The resulting
value for the cross section was 3.22 * 0.18 barns.
From this value, a removal cross section of
3.13 £ 0.25 barns was calculated for tungsten,
which may be compared to a previously measured’
value of 2,51 + 0.55 barns. The two values are in
reasonably good agreement, but it is believed that
the latest measurement is more accurate. It is of
inferest to note that this value for tungsten very
nearly falls on the o vs utomic weight plot reported
previously.®.  The value on the curve is ~3,3
barns.

A plot of the thermal-neutron flux measurements
in the water beyond the Hevimet is compared to a
plot of measurements in plain water in Fig. 5.1.8.
The measurements were made with a ]2/2 in. BF,
counter, a 3-in, fission chamber, and a /2 m.

Nitrogen Neutron Cross Sections

A study of the resonance structure of the neutron
cross sections of N'7 has indicated that none of
the existing resonance formalisms can be com-
pletely valid for the interference phenomena ex-
pected to exist between resonances. It was vali-
dated that use of the Blatt-Biedenharn formulation®
will not cause great error, and on that basis the
experimental information on resonance parameters
has been used to calculate angular distributions

cross sections up to an energy of 2.5 Mev. Above
that energy, data from experiments will be used
directly, and, to bridge the gap from 4 to 14 Mev,
artistic license, guided by the predictions of the
continuum model, will be used.

Calculations have been made of the inelastic
scattering that results in excitation of the first
four levels in N'# by following the method of
Hauser and Feshbach.!® The result for the ex-
citation of the first level (2.3 Mev) is much higher
than has been observed experimentally at 4 Mev,
and the cause of the discrepancy is still obscure.
The inelastic calculations are being extended to
higher energies by using the continuum model.

Oxygen Neutron Cross Sections

Recent experimental information'!

on the angular
distribution of elastic scattering of neutrons in
oxygen up to energies of 2.5 Mev has been used to
construct new sets of Legendre polynomial ex-
pansion coefficients for on'n(E,Q) in this energy
region. The experimental data show that a 1.0-Mev
level can be identified as a single-particle d3/2
level, and an attempt has been made to find a
similar single-particle identification for the very
broad level at 3.2 Mev. A code (NOSE) for the
NDA Datatron has been prepared for computation
of phase shifts for scattering from a suitable
potential well. The presence of the 1.0-Mev level
has been verified, but as yet there has been no
success in creating a single-particle level with
something like the observed structure at 3.2 Mev
with reasonable wells.

Age of Fission Neutrons in Water

The experimental values'! of the angular distri-
butions of neutrons in oxygen, were used to re-
compute, by the moments method, the age of fission
neutrons in water, The sensitivity of the age to

sections below 3 Mev only increase the age to
26.5 cm?2, which is still far short of the experi-
value of 30 cm?. No reasonable change
either in the high-energy cross sections or in the
fission spectrum can increase the computed age by

more than 1 cm?,

ANALYSIS OF THE FISSION-PRODUCT
GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA EXPERIMENT

W. Zobel R. W. Peelle
T. A. Love G. M. Estabrook

Analysis of the data obtained in the experiment
for determining the gross fission-product gamma-
ray spectra at short times after fission's? is
continuing. The first efforts to remove the non-
uniqueness of the response of the spectrometer
to monoenergetic gamma rays failed. The response
of the spectrometer to any given photon spectrum
may be represented by the 60 numbers obtained
from the output of the multichannel pulse-height
analyzer.  These numbers comprise the pulse-
height spectrum corresponding to the given photon
spectrum. The nonuniqueness of such spec-
trometers should be evidenced by the dissimilarity
of the pulse-height spectra with photon spectra of
known sources.

A 60 x 60 matrix, known as the response matrix,
is formally capable of representing all the infor-
mation necessary to describe the pulse-height
spectrum associated with any prescribed photon
spectrum.  Information concerning the elements
of this matrix may be abstracted from observed
pulse-height spectra of monoenergetic gamma-ray

sources. Similarly, the inverse of this response
matrix, when applied to any observed pulse-
height spectrum, formally yields the photon

spectrum corresponding to these observed pulses.
The Oracle was used to invert the response
matrix generated by hand, and the resulting inverse
matrix was applied to the experimental data from
the fission-product spectra experiment. The
spectrum obtained by this procedure appeared to be
it fluctuated widely and yielded
‘‘photon spectrum’’

meaningless;
negative values for
quantities.,

Attempts are being made to discover the source
of the mathematical difficulty. A hand calculation
has been performed which was designed to yield
an approximate photon spectrum properly corrected

uncorrected for the roughly Gaussian resolution
function that represents the response in the
neighborhood of the peak. This approximation
may be investigated by forming a response matrix
with the tails properly represented but the peaks
compressed into a single channel. This method
was applied to the pulse-height spectrum measured
40 sec after fission, and the results are shown in
Fig. 5.2.1. The upper curve contains no correction
for the tails of the response function, while the
lower one was corrected according to the described

A similar analysis could be applied to the
remainder of the data with a machine calculation.
However, since only the tail part of the non-
uniqueness would thereby be removed, it appeared
desirable to trace the cause of the difficulty and
remove the remainder of the nonuniqueness. Since
removal of the tail nonuniqueness caused no
difficulty, the failure of the matrix method must
be concerned with the Gaussion part of the re-
sponse function. |t has been shown?® that a choice
of an unduly large width of the Gaussian functions
representing the response can be expected to lead
to the observed type of violent fluctuations.

A code has been written for the Oracle which
will permit ready calculation of the response
matrix for any prescribed set of widths of the
Gaussian ‘‘peaks.’”’ It is hoped that with the
help of this code the nonuniqueness effects can
be largely removed so that the output data may be
directly interpretable.

A CALCULATION OF THE GAMMA-RAY
SPECTRUM OF THE BULK SHIELDING
FACILITY REACTOR

G. deSaussure

The continued requirements for more refined
shielding information necessitate that the gamma-
ray spectrum of a shield-test reactor be known.
The spectrum of the Bulk Shielding Facility
(BSF) reactor was previously determined experi-
mentally with a scintillation spectrometer,® and
calculational attempts® have been made to esti-
mate the gamma-ray spectrum on the surface of the
reactor core over the entire energy range. The
calculation reported here represents an attempt
to determine the high-energy end of this spectrum
from the known intensity and spectra of the primary
gamma-ray sources inside the core.

Method of Calculation

Only the high-energy end of the BSF reactor
spectrum, from 3.0 Mev up, was calculated, and
for this portion of the spectrum the main contri-
bution to the flux at the core surface is the
uncollided flux. This can be calculated in a
straightforward manner if the sources of primary
gamma rays inside the core are known. |n addition
to the uncollided flux, the Compton-scattered flux

was calculated by using two simplifying as-
(1) the ‘‘straight-ahead assumption’’
under which the energy spectrum of the scattered

sumptions:

gamma rays is given by the correct Klein-Nishina
formula, but their direction is the same as the
direction of the primary gamma rays, and (2) the
*‘one-collision which the
scattered gamma rays proceed without further
absorption to the surface of the core. |t is obvious
that the spectrum of Compton-scattered gamma
rays calculated under these assumptions will be an

assumption’’ under

overestimate of the actual spectrum.
The Primary Sources of Gamma Radiation

There are four sources of primary gamma rays:
(1) prompt-fission gamma rays, (2) capture gamma
rays from aluminum, (3) capture gamma rays from
uranium, and (4) fission-product decay gamma
There are also gamma rays produced by

neutron capture in water, inelastic scattering of

rays.

fast neutrons, decay of Al28, and annihilation
radiation, but none of these sources contribute
appreciably to the gamma radiation above 3 Mev.
Most fissions in the reactor occur at thermal
energies. In this energy range the spectrum and
intensity of the prompt-fission gamma rays have
been investigated by Gamble’ and can be approxi-

mated by

N(E) = 7.6e=1*01E photons/Mev.fission

The spectrum of uranium capture gamma rays
has not been investigated; however, the total
gamma-ray energy emitted per capture is known
to be 6.43 Mev, which is equivalent to the binding
energy of an additional neutron in U233, The
energy dependence of the
spectrum of U235

capture gamma-ray
was assumed to be the same as
that of the prompt-fission spectrum (i.e., ~ e~ 1*01E),
This is probably not correct, but the intensity of
this source of radiation is small compared with
that of aluminum capture gamma rays, and it should
not affect the results greatly.

The gamma-ray source associated with fission-
product activity evidently depends on the past
history of the fuel elements of the reactor; how-
ever, the main contribution is from the short-

lived fission products. The spectrum of the

short-lived fission-product decay gamma rays of
U235 has been measured by Peelle, Zobel, and
Love,® who have reported a typical spectrum
corresponding to about 3 hr of activation. This is
the spectrum that was used in the calculation.

The energies and intensities of aluminum capture
gamma rays have been investigated and tabulated
by Kinsey, Bartholomew, and Walker.?  When
combined, the spectra of these four sources of

primary gamma rays gave an almost continuous
spectrum of radiation. For purposes of calculation,
the spectrum from 3 to 11 Mev was divided into
four 2-Mev-wide groups, and the total energy
emitted by the various sources in each of the
energy groups was computed. For convenience,
the total energy emitted in each group was divided
by a ‘“‘representative energy’’ inside the group to
convert it into an equivalent number of photons of
the representative energy. The results of this
calculation are tabulated in Table 5.2.1.

The numbers presented in Table 5.2.1 were
obtained in the following manner. The prompt-
fission gamma-ray spectrum was approximated by

nl(E) = 7.6e~191E photons/Mev-fission .

multiplying the number of aluminum nuclei per
cubic centimeter of the reactor core (2.47 x 1022

aluminum for thermal neutrons (oAi = 0.204 barn);
the resulting value for 22' was 0.00504 cm=1,

assumed in the calculation of the number of
aluminum capture photons per fission that the
ratio of the number of thermal neutrons absorbed
in U235 to that absorbed in aluminum is pro-
portional to the ratio of their respective macro-

scopic absorption cross sections. This may not

be strictly true because of self-shielding and

a small effect!® that could not affect the ab-
sorption ratios by more than 4%.

The Uncollided Flux

In the calculation of the uncollided flux it was

first assumed that the thermal-neutron flux was the
same throughout the reactor core. Later, cor-
rections were made to take into account the actual
shape of the thermal-neutron flux (see below). If
the flux is the same throughout the core, the
number of fissions per cubic centimeter per second
in the core may be obtained by dividing the total
number of fissions per second by the volume of
the core.
11 were normal-
ized to a reactor power of 1 w, which corresponds
to 3.1 x 10'0 fissions/sec. The total volume of
the reactor core for the experiment was 1.15 x 107
cm3 (BSF reactor loading 22A). Thus there were
2.7 x 10° fissions/sec.w.cm3. These same con-
ditions were assumed for the calculation.

The Compton-Scattered Flux

Since, as mentioned above, the Compton-
scattered gamma-ray flux was calculated under
‘‘straight-chead’’ and ‘‘one-collision’’ assumptions,
only those gamma rays that originated from Compton
scattering of primary gamma rays that were moving
in the direction of the detector before their col-
lision were considered. The total number of
primary photons that were originally moving in
the direction of the detector was obtained by
setting u(E) = 0 [or f(E) = 1] in the equation for
the uncollided flux. The difference between this
and the actudl
number of photons that had originally been moving
in the direction toward the surface of the core but

that the thermal-neutron flux was constant through-
out the reactor core. This, of course, is not
correct; gold-foil measurements have shown that
the average value of the flux along the reactor
center line (;ﬁo) is 11.23 x 1010 neutrons/cm2.sec,
while the average value of the flux throughout the
core (P) is 7.36 x 1010 neutrons/cm?.sec. Before
any comparison can be made with the experimental
results, 11 a correction must be made for the shape
of the flux. In the experiment the detector colli-
mator was pointed toward the center of the core;
therefore, the experimental results could be
expected to indicate a greater intensity than the
calculations. In order to correct the calculations,
the calculated values of the gamma-ray flux given
in Table 5.2.4 were multiplied by the ratio {50/5.
The corrected calculated values for the flux on the
center line at the surface of the reactor are shown

scattered flux is small compared with the uncol-
lided flux,

It should be pointed out, however, that the
experimental values plotted in Fig. 5.2.4 do not
represent the exact values reported previously!!
In re-examining the experimental data for the BSF
reactor gamma-ray spectrum, it appeared probable
that the error from leakage through side walls
of the collimator used for this particular experi-
ment was appreciably greater than the 20% quoted
when the data were originally published. Appli-
cation of a recently derived formulal3® to the
geometry of this experiment indicates that the
effective solid angle should be increased by a
factor of 1.7. Therefore, the gamma-ray flux
plotted in Fig. 5.2.4 was reduced by this factor,

It is surprising that the calculation described
above gave a much lower intensity for the spectrum
than that measured, since all the assumptions
made in the calculation were in a direction that
would tend to overestimate the flux. This seems
to indicate a discrepancy between the experimental
data'! and the capture gamma-ray spectrum of
aluminum reported by Kinsey, Bartholomew, and
Walker.14 The error in the experimental data is
uncertain, but it would appear to be less than
the marked discrepancy between the experiment
and the calculation. Further experimental work
is planned as soon as the new model IV spec-
trometer and positioner are available (see section
on ‘‘BSF Model IV Gamma-Ray Spectrometer

AND NEUTRON SPECTROMETERS

T. A. Love R. W. Peelle

The gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy experi-
ments planned for the BSF and the ART will
require multichannel pulse-height analyzers with
capacities of at least 100 channels; therefore,
two 256-channel anaolyzers of an Argonne National
Laboratory design were ordered from a commercial
manufacturer already engaged in their production.

The first unit was delivered in September 1956,
after which considerable time was expended
in testing, debugging, and modifying the unit.
This program was carried out with the help of the
Instrument Department. A number of mechanical
wiring errors were discovered, and minor modifi-
cations were necessitated by nonlinearities and
generally erratic performance.  The analyzer
utilizes a circuit logic involving conversion
of each input pulse into a time interval of length
proportional to the pulse height. Considerable
difficulty was experienced in making this con-
version linear. With the cooperation of the vendor,
the particular trouble experienced with this
analyzer was corrected, at least temporarily.
Difficulty was also experienced with loss of
stored
with a reset pulse in the time-measuring circuit,
The latter must occur with perfect reproducibility
prior to the sensing of the information corre-

information at high counting rates and

sponding to each pulse.

This first analyzer unit is now performing satis-
factorily. Linearity above the first few channels
is about +0.2%, ‘‘zero’’ drift is less than 1%
per day, and counting rates of about 30,000/sec
may be readily tolerated. Although the unit now
functions well, the long-term stability of operation
has not yet been proven.

The second analyzer was delivered in May 1957.
Many tests were performed by the BSF spectroscopy
group and by the Instrument Department to de-
termine whether the instrument performed in
accordance with contract specifications. These
tests were performed at the vendor’s site prior to
delivery and after delivery at the BSF. The
instrument met most criteria immediately, but some
trouble
readout circuitry and with the response linearity.
While the readout circuitry could probably be
corrected readily, improvement of the response
linearity’ could entail expensive modifications.
The linearity of the instrument was tested by
using test pulses of known relative amplitude and
by using pulses from a sodium iodide thallium-
activated scintillation counter exposed to mono-
energetic gamma-ray sources. The observed
nonlinearity is about 10.7%, compared with the
required +0.2%, which was stated in the contract
specifications. Appropriate disposal of the
analyzer has not been determined, since it is not
clear how and by whom the unit will be made to
meet required tolerances.

THE BSF MODEL IV GAMMA-RAY
SPECTROMETER HOUSING AND POSITIONER

R. W. Peelle T. A. Love

A new gamma-ray spectrometer (model 1V) and
an associated positioner are to be installed at the
BSF. This complex equipment is required in order
to provide for the measurement of energy and angle
distributions of gamma radiation for any specified
direction at any point in the reactor pool at the
BSF.  The positioner will also be capable of
supporting similar equipment, such as a neutron
spectrometer.

The detailed design of the spectrometer po-
sitioner by the Engineering Department is now
95% complete, and fabrication is approximately
5% complete. The 20-ton crane necessary for the
support of the spectrometer and positioner is being
supplied by a vendor whose work is about 60%
finished. Delivery of the crane is expected in
August. The Engineering Department has also
initiated a detailed study of the BSF structure in
order to plan for the installation of the rails which
will support the bridge from which the crane will
be suspended.

The Instrument Department is designing the
spectrometer housing and the instruments neces-
sary for the determination of the position and
angle of the instrument. The design of the po-
sition-measuring device is 25% complete, while
design and fabrication of the spectrometer housing
are now, respectively, 80 and 20% complete. The
present rapid advance in the design of the spec-
trometer housing has been made possible by the
recent success in the pouring of small heats of
the lithium-lead alloy required for the housing.
Unusual problems arise because it is necessary
for the molten alloy to be handled under a con-
trolled atmosphere to avoid oxidation and removal
of the lithium. It appears that the complete set
of instruments may be ready for final testing and
use within about nine months.

USE OF Li%I(Eu) AS A SCINTILLATION
DETECTOR AND SPECTROMETER
FOR FAST NEUTRONS

R. B. Murray

A knowledge of the energy spectrum of neutrons
emerging from a reactor, as well as from various
thicknesses of shielding around the reactor, is of
considerable importance in shield design. Measure-
ments of such spectra have been handicapped in

303
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

the past by the lack of an efficient, fast-neutron
spectrometer which would record spectra directly;
the measurements were made previously by em-
ploying the laborious technique of counting tracks
in nuclear emulsions.

A proton-recoil type of fast-neutron spectrometer
has been successfully used at the BSF,!5 but
this instrument is limited in its usefulness by the
inherently low detection efficiency of a radiator-
absorber type of spectrometer.  Therefore, a
fast-neutron spectrometer development program has
been continued with the hope of producing a more
sensitive instrument which can be used to extend
the previous measurements. The type of spec-
trometer which is being developed for this purpose
utilizes a single crystal of Li%l(Eu) as a scintil-
lation spectrometer.

The response of various crystals of LiSI(Eu) to
monoenergetic fast neutrons was reported previ-
ously.'® It was found that the fast-neutron re-
sponse of a crystal operating at room temperature
was unsatisfactory in that the pulse-height
spectrum showed a broad and poorly defined
fast-neutron peak. When the crystals were cooled
to about —140°C, however, the fast-neutron peak
was observed to become sharper and to assume a
nearly Gaussian shape.

Apparatus and techniques necessary for oper-
ation of a scintillation counter at very low temper-
atures are also being investigated. Pulse-height
spectra from crystals operated at the liquid
nitrogen point (—196°C) have been recorded for
neutrons from the (d,d), (d,t), and Be%(d,n)B10
reactions, and from a Po-Be source. The scintil-
lation responses of various crystals of Lil(Eu)
to gamma rays have also been studied in an effort
to provide a means for monitoring the gamma-ray
contribution to an observed pul se-height spectrum.
The techniques used and the results of the experi-
ments are discussed below.

Scintillation Response of Lil(Eu)
to Charged Particles

The fact that the fast-neutron peak observed at
room temperature appears as a broad and ‘‘rec-
tangular’ band has been tentatively ascribed
to a difference in the scintillation efficiency of

Lil(Eu) to alpha particles and to tritons. It is
known, for example, that the scintillation ef-
ficiency of thallium-activated sodium iodide to
alpha particles is substantially lower than that
for lighter charged particles. The sharper fast-
neutron peak in Lil(Eu) at low temperatures might
then be due to an increasing scintillation ef-
ficiency to alpha particles with decreasing temper-
ature. In order to obtain some information on this
subject, an experiment was carried out in which an
Lil(Eu) crystal was simultaneously excited by
1.12-Mev gamma rays from Zn®%3, alpha particles
from U233, and the alpha-triton pair resulting
from slow-neutron capture. The peaks observed in
the pulse-height spectrum resulting from these
three modes of excitation were followed as a
function of temperature from room temperature to
the liquid nitrogen point. The results of the
experiment are shown in Fig. 5.2.5, in which

the pulse heights of the three peaks are normal-
ized to the same value at room temperature. It
may be seen that the scintillation efficiency
of the crystal to alpha particles increases much
more rapidly with decreasing temperature than that
for gamma rays or the alpha-triton pair. The
results of this experiment are thus consistent with
the proposed explanation of the improved fast-
neutron response at low temperatures.

Experimental Apparatus

The initial experiments on the scintillation
properties of Lil(Eu) at low temperatures were
|

carried out with an apparatus in which the crystal
was cooled by a flow of dry nitrogen gas which
had been circulated through a liquid nitrogen heat
exchanger. This apparatus required frequent
attention and rather large quantities of both
gaseous and liquid nitrogen. Accordingly, it was
replaced with a device in which the crystal is
cooled directly by liquid nitrogen (see Fig. 5.2.6).
The design of this apparatus is dictated by the
fact that conventional photomultipliers fail to
function below about —140°C, so it is necessary
to maintain the temperature of the photocathode
well above that of the crystal. In the apparatus
shown in Fig. 5.2.6, the Lil(Eu) crystal (whose
dimensions are, typically, 35 mm in diameter and
2 mm in thickness) is mounted on a polished
Lucite light piper about '|]/4 in. long. The light
piper is optically coupled to the photomultiplier
by DC 200 silicone grease; a flow of compressed
air around the photomultiplier and light piper
maintains the photocathode surface near room
temperature. The ‘‘cold’’ end of the light piper
is provided with a flange and is threaded so that
the crystal may be sealed from the atmosphere by

a thin-wall brass cap which seats on a rubber
O-ring against the flange. This cap is part of the
liquid nitrogen system and communicates directly
with the liquid nitrogen reservoir.

It has been necessary to mount the crystal
directly on the light piper without the use of an
optical grease, since the various greases normally
used solidify upon cooling and may break either
the optical seal or the crystal or both. In the
case of thin Lil(Eu) crystals mounted on Lucite,
it was found that the room-temperature resolution
(for slow neutrons) of a crystal mounted dry is
very little different from that of the same crystal
mounted with an optical grease. The reverse
face of the crystal is normally covered with a
thin aluminum-foil reflector. A good Lil(Eu)
crystal mounted in this manner, in conjunction
with a selected photomultiplier, will normally
give a slow-neutron peak of 6% resolution.

The liquid nitrogen reservoir shown in Fig. 5.2.6
is a 2-liter glass Dewar vessel and requires
filling about every 4 hr. The Dewar vessel is
connected to the liquid nitrogen cell adjoining
the crystal by a short length of rubber hose.

Some of the crystals used in this work were
grown at ORNL and others were obtained from
The Harshaw Chemical Co. Crystals from these
two sources proved to be equally satisfactory.

Photomultipliers 2 in. in diameter were used
throughout this study; best results were obtained
with a selected Dumont 6292 and RCA 6342. The
photomultiplier pulses were fed to an A-1D pre-
amplifier and amplifier. Since the rise time of
Lil(Eu) pulses is about 2 pusec, it is necessary
to use 4-psec delay line clipping in the A-1D
amplifier. The amplified 4-ysec pulses are then
fed to an Atomic Model 520 twenty-channel
analyzer. Since 4-usec pulses are being analyzed
it is necessary to restrict the over-all counting
rate to a few thousand counts per second to avoid
an appreciable overlapping of pulses.

Neutron Spectra

The spectrum of neutrons from various sources
has been recorded by using the apparatus shown
in Fig. 5.2.6. Neutrons from nuclear reactions
were obtained by accelerating deuterons in the
ORNL  625-kev  Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
The pulse-height spectrum from 2.92-Mev neutrons
from the (d,d) reaction is shown in Fig. 5.2.7.
For comparison, Fig. 5.2.8 shows the pulse-height

The counts observed in Fig. 5.2.7 between
the fast-neutron peak and the slow-neutron peak
are attributed to neutrons scattered to the crystal
by the surrounding apparatus. Probably the most
offensive piece of apparatus in this respect is the
Lucite light piper, which is immediately adjacent
to the crystal and which contains hydrogen. The
light piper also is primarily responsible for the
large slow-neutron peak which is always observed
in a fast-neutron experiment. The counts from
these degraded neutrons constitute, of course, a
background in the form of a low-energy tail which
must be taken into account in a measurement of a

ature.

that these competing reactions need be con-
sidered only for neutrons of energy ~8 Mev or
greater, because of the high O value of the (n,a)
reaction. In a fission-like spectrum, then, this
effect will give rise to a very small background.
The Be9(d,n)B10 reaction (E, = 550 kev) pro-
vides a source of five groups of monoenergetic
neutrons. The energies of the various neutron
groups are predictable from the known level
structure of the B1? nucleus. The pulse-height
spectrum resulting from bombardment of an LiS!(Eu)
crystal at —196°C by Be?(d,n)B10 neutrons is
shown in Fig. 5.2.10. The calculated energies of
the neutron groups are indicated by arrows. The
neutron energy scale at the top of Fig. 5.2.10 was
determined by a plot of pulse height vs neutron
energy (see Fig. 5.2.11). The groups at 2.90 and
4.51 Mev are weak and occur alongside the more
intense 2.52- and 3.84-Mev peaks. It should be
noted that the ordinate of Fig. 5.2.10 is the
relative counting rate and has not been corrected
for the energy dependence of the Li%(n,a)t cross
section in order to obtain the relative number of
neutrons. Since the (n,a) cross section decreases

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

with increasing energy, this correction has the
effect of multiplying the ordinate in Fig. 5.2.10
by a factor which increases with energy.

The relative number of neutrons expected in the
various groups shown in Fig. 5.2.10 can be esti-
mated from previous measurements of neutron
spectra and angular distributions at other labo-
ratories. These measurements have generally been
carried out with nuclear emulsion techniques
which permit somewhat better resolution than
Li®I(Eu) does in this energy region. In order to
compare the Li%l(Eu) data with previous measure-
ments, the areas of the neutronpeaks in Fig. 5.2.10

intensities compared well with the estimated

reading of graphs and the calculating of areas
from published papers.

The spectrum of neutrons from a Po-Be source
is a continuous distribution in energy up to about
11 Mev. Because of the widespread use of Po-Be
sources, it has been of considerable interest in
the past to measure this spectrum. Results of
recent measurements with proton-recoil techniques
may be found in the literature.17=19  Although no
two spectra are exactly alike, they are all quali-
tatively similar. The spectrum of neutrons from
a l-curie Po-Be source was recorded with an
Li%l(Eu) crystal with the use of the low-temper-
ature apparatus shown in Fig. 5.2.6. The pulise-
height spectrum was corrected for spurious counts
arising from neutrons reflected to the crystal and
from competing nuclear reactions. This correction
amounted to about 50% of the counts at 1.5 Mey,
20% at 3 Mev, and was negligible above 5.5 Mev.

Fig. 5.2.12, Spectrum of Neutrons from a Po-Be Source
Detected by a Li6|(Eu) Crystal,

The corrections referred to above were primarily
due to neutrons reflected to the crystal and were
estimated from a number of pulse-height spectra
similar to the spectrum shown in Fig. 5.2.7. An
idea of the shape and size of the low-energy tail
may be obtained from Fig. 5.2.13, which shows the
expected background associated with 1000 counts
at energy E . In addition to the experimental infor-
mation of Fig. 5.2.13, it was possible to obtain a
rough idea of the expected background by the use
of a Monte Carlo calculation20 previously set up to
obtain the spectrum and dose of neutrons reflected
The low-energy tail predicted by
this calculation agreed reasonably well with the
curves in Fig. 5.2.13. It should be pointed out
that the corrections due to reflected neutrons
are still rather uncertain; more definitive experi-
mental information is needed to pin this point
down. Even so, the Po-Be spectrum shown in
Fig. 5.2.13 and the relative intensities of the
groups in Fig. 5.2.10 are in agreement with
previous measurements.

Two additional points may be made concerning
the low-energy tail. First, this effect would be

from slabs.

minimized if it were possible to eliminate the
Lucite light piper. A device is now being con-
structed in which the LiS%l(Eu) crystal is mounted
inside a cylindrical, thin-walled aluminum sleeve
which slips over the photomultiplier. The interior
wall of the sleeve is highly polished. Preliminary
results indicate that this may be a feasible
technique, in which case the low-energy tail and
the slow-neutron peck should be substantially
reduced. Second, a fission-like neutron spectrum
falls off very rapidly with energy above 1 or 2 Mev,
so that there are relatively few fast neutrons to
give rise to a low-energy tail. In this respect the
Po-Be spectrum is most disagreeable, since its
peak occurs between 3 and 5 Mev and provides a
large background at lower energies.

Gamma-Ray Response

A major issue which remains to be discussed is
that of the gamma-ray background which inevitably
accompanies neutron sources and which is ex-
pected to be large in the case of an operating

reactor. Three main points may be made on this

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

subject. (1) The thermal peak in a properly
activated crystal occurs at a gamma-ray equivalent
pulse height of about 4.8 Mev. Thus, the large Q
value of the (n,a) reaction provides a built-in
bias which discriminates against gamma-ray-
induced pulses up to almost 5 Mev. (2) Thin
crystals (~2 or 3 mm) may be used, so that the
probability that a high-energy gamma ray (say
8-Mev) will deposit its full energy in the crystal is
very small indeed. (3) An auxiliary crystal of
Li7I(Eu) can be used as a gamma-ray monitor.
Subtracting the Li7l(Eu) pulse-height spectrum
from that recorded with Li®l(Eu) should eliminate
the gamma-ray counts from the neutron spectrum,

In order to determine the validity of these points,
several experiments were carried out with gamma
rays. The crystals chosen were an Li7I(Eu)
crystal (99.9% Li7) grown at ORNL and a normal
Lil(Eu) crystal (7.4% Li%) supplied by Harshaw.
(In practice, of course, one would use an enriched
Li® crystal for the neutron spectrum.) These
crystals were slightly over 2 mm thick. The first
question considered was whether the pulse-height
response of these two arbitrarily selected crystals
would be sufficiently similar so that the gamma-ray
spectra could be superimposed. The pulse-height
spectrum of Zn®> gamma rays on the two crystals
was recorded; the amplifier gain was adjusted so
that the peaks fell at the same pulse height. The
results, shown in Fig. 5.2.14, indicate that the
spectra are essentially identical.

The spectrum of gamma rays from the Po-Be
source (primarily the 4.43-Mev gamma ray from
C'2) is shown in Fig. 5.2.15. The distinguishable
gamma-ray peak in the Li’l(Eu) spectrum is the
two-escape peak from the 4.43-Mev gamma rays.
It should be noted that the small thermal-neutron
peak in the Li7 spectrum does not occur at the
same pulse height as that from the Li% spectrum;
the gamma-ray calibration for the two crystals,
however, is still the same. This reflects the fact
that the relative scintillation efficiency of a
given crystal to neutrons and gamma rays is a
function of activator content. An Li7I(Eu) monitor
must then be intercalibrated with an Li®l(Eu)
crystal with gamma rays.

The B'l(p,7)C'2 reaction, excited by protons
from the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator, produces
gamma rays at 16 Mev and an 11.6 + 4.43 Mev
cascade; the 16-Mev gamma ray is weak with
respect to the cascade. The spectrum of these

Fig. 5.2.16. Again, the spectra can be well
superimposed. The number of counts above 600
pulse-height units was completely negligible,
despite the presence of the 11.6-Mev gamma ray.
This fact is taken as evidence in support of
point (2) above; namely, that very few high-energy
gamma-ray pulses will be observed with crystals
of the order of 2- to 3-mm thickness. It may be
noted in Fig. 5.2.16 that the gamma-ray counts
become negligible above about 6 Mev equivalent
pulse height. This indicates that the gamma-ray
contribution to an observed neutron spectrum may
be expected to be very small above a neutron
energy of 1 or 2 Mev.

The conclusion from the gamma-ray experiments
described seems to be that a gamma-ray background
can be tolerated and monitored under reasonable

the counter is completely swamped by gamma rays
cannot be tolerated. What this means in terms of a
reactor surrounded by a neutron shield remains to
be seen.

Conclusions

The experiments indicate that Li®l(Eu) offers
considerable promise as an instrument suitable
for measuring fission-like neutron spectra. lts
principal features as a fast-neutron spectrometer
are a relatively high detection efficiency and
moderate resolution. An experiment is planned in
the near future to measure the spectrum of fission
neutrons from U233, The results will be compared
with recent Los Alamos measurements. |f this
experiment is successful, it would then seem
appropriate to consider applications of the Li®l(Ev)
technique to shielding experiments.

There is obviously room for improvement in the
apparatus described in this report. As mentioned,
it is hoped that the Lucite light piper can be
eliminated. It would also be most desirable to
surround the crystal, as much as possible, with a

slow-neutron absorbing material, perhaps cadmium,
B19, or Li®.

The problems involved in measuring a fast-
neutron spectrum, by any means, are numerous.
It should be pointed out that the Li6l(Eu) tech-
nique suggested here requires some effort and
care to set up and operate and does not yet provide
a simple instrument for routine data-taking.

PULSED-NEUTRON METHOD FOR THE
DETERMINATION OF NEUTRON DIFFUSION
PARAMETERS IN BERYLLIUM

E. G. Silver

It is important to know the neutron diffusion
parameters of beryllium in order to perform calcu-

G. deSaussure

iations for a beryllium-moderated reactor such as
has been proposed for aircraft propulsion. An
experiment to determine these parameters as a
function of temperature by the ‘‘pulsed-neutron
method’’ is planned, with preliminary measure-
ments being performed at room temperature and at
liquid-nitrogen temperature (—196°C). For the
first measurements at these two temperatures,
graphite, which is easily obtained and exhibits
crystalline choracteristics similar to those of
beryllium, will be used. After the experimental
technique has been developed, beryllium will then
be measured.

A block diagram of the experimental arrangement
for the preliminary measurements is shown on
Fig. 5.2.17. The ion source in the head of the
particle accelerator is controlled by a set of
deflector plates, the signal to the plates being
transmitted through an ultra-high-frequency radio
link, The sequence of operation comprises a
bombardment time, T, (during which the beam is
on), followed by a waiting time, T, and a counting
time, T_. (during which the pulses from the
thermal-neutron detector are analyzed into 18 time
channels according to their times of arrival at the
detector). The time width t of the 18-channel
time analyzer is the time unit of the system and is
set by the frequency of the time base oscillator.
For instance, a typical operation would be
represented by T, =20t7 = 30¢. Here ¢ = 1 msec,
the oscillator is set at 1 k¢, and the beam is on
for 20 msec. After the beam is turned off there is
a further delay of 10 msec (TW - TB), during which
time the pulse gate is closed. When the pulse
gate opens, the signals from the thermal-neutron
detector are counted in 18 channels, according to
their time of arrival. Since each channel is 1 msec
wide, the counting is over after 18 msec and the
entire cycle starts again with a new bombardment
for 20 msec, and so forth.

The high-voltage accelerator needed in the
preliminary measurements to produce neutrons by
the D(d,n)He3 reaction is in the final stage of
construction. The time analyzer for investigating
the decay of the neutron population in the moder-
ating material has already been completed, and an
Liél scintillation crystal has been obtained for
use as the neutron detector. The high-voltage
power supply will not be delivered before February
1958, however.  Until the power supply is re-
ceived an attempt may be made to perform some of
the preliminary measurements with an accelerator
that should become available at the ORNL High-
Voltage Laboratory.

A UOZ-STAlNLESS STEEL SHIELD TEST
REACTOR FOR THE BSF

It has been proposed, as reported previously,?!
that a U02—stoin|ess steel reactor be constructed

312

that would be interchangeable with the present
uranium-aluminum reactor at the BSF. The de-
velopment of plate-type control devices for such
a reactor and results of mockup tests in the BSF
reactor are discussed below.

Mechanical Control Plate Tests

J. Lewin?22

The control and safety elements in the uo,-
stainless steel reactor will consist of relatively
thin plates that will move in water spaces on
either side of special fuel elements. There will
be two control plates per special fuel element,

In addition, two lamps were placed in the field of
view of the camera. One lamp flashed when the
magnet current was cut off and the other flashed
when the clutch switch opened to give an indi-
cation that the control plate assembly had begun to
move. The time interval between the flashing of
the magnet lamp and the clutch switch lamp
represented the time require for the magnet to
release plus any overtravel in the clutch switch,

By reading on the film the number of turns of the

timing disk for a position of the control plate, a

record of the motion was obtained. The circuit

for starting the camerq, cutting the magnet current,
and flashing the lights was similar to that origi-
nated by the ORNL Reactor Controls Department?23

(see also Fig. 5.2.20).

The total length of the drop of the control plate
assembly was limited to 13.75 in. Drops were
made under the following conditions:

1. fall under force of gravity only,

2. fall under force of gravity only with both
control plates removed, that is, only the lift
tube, piston, and armature were dropped,

3. fall under force of gravity only with one control
plate removed,

4. fall with an initial spring force of 66 Ib and
with the lift tube closed at the upper end so
that the water inside the tube was trapped,

5. fall with an initial spring force of 86 Ib and
with the lift tube closed,

6. fall with initial spring force of 86 Ib and with
the lift tube open at upper end so that water
could move through the lift tube.

The results of thesetests are shown in Fig.5.2.21.

Figure 5.2.22 is a plot of the velocity during the

first 80 msec of travel. This was made by

measuring the slopes of the position-time curves
drawn to a much larger scale than that in Fig.

5.2.21. At least three drops were made under

each condition. The films showed consistent

motion in each case, within film reading errors.

The predicted motion with an initial force of
66 lb is also shown in Figs. 5.2.21 and 5.2.22
for comparison with the experimental results.
This prediction was made from the analog solution
of the equation:

most uniform decelerating force. The decelerator
finally used in the tests is shown in Fig. 5.2.24.
Although a straight-line taper of D_ is not theo-
retically the best method of decreasing the
variable-orifice area, it is by far the easiest to
fabricate and was used for this reason. The tests
showed that the plates were decelerated to a
velocity of about 1 in./sec in each case and that
the decelerator action was good.

Although the results of the tests with the control
plate assembly have not yet been completely
analyzed, the mechanical feasibility of the as-
sembly has been demonstrated. Some indication
of the nuclear control advantages that may be
obtained through the use of this control system
is given in Fig. 5.2.25. It was assumed that
24-in.-long plates would reach the same terminal
velocity as the 15-in.-long plates in the test
assembly with an initial 66-lb push, about 63
in./sec. A time to drop 24 in. was thus obtained,
and this, together with a typical rod worth curve
was used to obtain the ‘‘reactivity removal’’
curve plotted in Fig. 52.25. A corresponding
curve published by Battelle Memorial Institute
shows the reactivity removal of a single swimming-
pool-type rod dropped under the action of gravity.

The results of these tests confirm, in general,
the findings reported in refs 23 and 24; that is,
the increased length of time required for a drop
when the control plates were removed from the
assembly indicates that friction of the plates in
their relatively narrow channels is negligible
and that the major resistance to the motion is
provided by dynamic drag on the piston and
armature.

The inferiority of actual performance as compared
with the calculated performance is consistent
with the data obtained from other configu-
23,24 |t js explained by the fact that a
greater mass than that of the control plates is
being accelerated; that is, a mass of water ac-
celerates along with the control plates and their
lift tube. Also, the drag coefficient is greater
for this configuration than the standard flat-disk
coefficient of 1.4 used in the calculations. It is
interesting to note that a terminal velocity of

about 80 in./sec was reached by the conventional

Nuclear Control Plate Test

E. B. Johnson K. M. Henry
J. D. Kington

Experimental tests to determine the effectiveness
of plates of absorber material have been continued
with the aluminum core of the BSF reactor, since
no stainless steel reactor is available. Extrapo-
lation from the aluminum to the stainless steel
core is not straightforward, but it is more reliable
than a direct calculation for the stainless steel
core.

Single-Plate Tests. — Part of the investigation
of the feasibility of plate-type control rods in-
volved a reactor loading (BSF reactor loading 64)
with a test cell having the dimensions of a single
fuel element near the center of the core (Fig.

located in position 24; however, for a few of the
tests it was located in position 14. The regular
reactor control rods were located so that the
effect of their withdrawal on the test cell was
minimized. In order to have sufficient poison
available for complete, unequivocal shutdown
under all conditions of the test cell, two guillotines
were installed on opposite sides of the core.
The total control-rod worth (exclusive of the
guillotines) was approximately 5% Ak/k. The
guillotines were worth about 2.5% and made a
total of about 7.5% in the rods.

A special fuel element which was fabricated
with 12 of the 18 fuel plates removable was used
in the test cell. Only the two outside plates and
the four plates under the handle were brazed into
the side plates, and thus five slots on the east
side of the element and seven on the west side
were available for experimentation. The various
poison plates were substituted for fuel plates
at the desired locations.

Figure 5.2.27 shows the net effect on reactivity
of aluminum plates loaded with various amounts of
boron compared with the effect of pure aluminum
plates in several slots of the test cell element.
For comparison, the data from an earlier experi-
ment are also plotted.

In order to determine the relative importance
of the various available slots across the test cell
fuel element, an aluminum plate loaded with 16 g
of boron wasplaced successively in each available
slot and the change in the reactivity from that
when a fuel plate or no plate (moderator) was in
the slot was noted. Since the loading contained
insufficient excess reactivity to permit measure-
ments near the center of the element with plates
containing 16 g of boron, a plate loaded with 8 g
of boron was used in this region. The results are
shown in Fig. 5.2.28.

Dual Plate Testss — It has been tentatively
proposed that poison plates be paired in the
stainless steel reactor for control purposes, that
is, that each rod element accommodate two control
plates. Therefore, two plates containing the same
amount of boron (2 g) were substituted for fuel
plates in the test cell with various distances
between the plates. The same experiment was
performed with 125-mil-thick stainless steel
plates. Figure 5.2.29 shows the results, the
change in reactivity being computed on the basis
of fuel plates in all slots of the test cell element.

Although there is some scatter in the points, it
would appear that an optimum separation distance
for the boron-loaded plates lies between 3.5 and

grounds is about 6.6 cm, and on the basis of the

tween the two plates, since one aluminum plate
loaded with 2 g of boron is worth about 1.16% in
reactivity in the test cell (see Fig. 5.2.27) and
the pair of plates is worth about 1.62% at the

decreased age of the delayed neutrons. Usually
large errors must be assigned to the measurements
in this experiment because of several contributing
factors. Deviations in the amount or distribution
of boron in supposedly identical plates resulted in
different reactivity values at the same location.
An arbitrary uncertainty of 5% has been assigned
to the boron concentration. Uncertainty in the
reactivity values was taken to be +0.01, which
is considered to be the maximum possible cumu-
lative error in this quantity.

The removable fuel plates used in the test cell
element were handled as if they were completely
interchangeable in all respects. [t was discovered
toward the end of the experiment that one of the
fuel plates was not positioned properly, so a 5%
error in reactivity has been assigned to the perti-
nent data,

NUCLEAR CONTROL EXPERIMENTS
FOR THE TSR-ll

E. B. Johnson K. M. Henry
J. D. Kington

Several experiments were performed at the
BSF to test the effectiveness of the control system
proposed for the Tower Shielding Reactor Il
(TSR 1), and the results are included in Chap. 5.3
of this report. In connection with these tests, a
series of tests was performed in which the effect
of a single boron-loaded aluminum plate on the
reactivity of the BSF reactor was determined.
For this series of tests, positions 25 and 26 in the
test cell (see Fig. 5.3.4 in Chap. 5.3 for location
of test cell in BSR loading 62B) were filled with
dummy elements (elements containing unfueled
aluminum plates). Two dummy elements that
contained only the outer two unfueled plates
brazed into the side plates, that is, two water-

filled boxes, were placed in positions 35 and 36..

Within either of these two elements a boron-loaded
plate could be placed in any of the 16 vacant
slots.

The reactor loading contained 5400 g of U235
and, with four dummy elements in place (no boron),
it had an excess reactivity of 2.2%. The changes
in reactivity caused by the introduction of a plate
containing 20 g of boron in position 35 and of a
plate containing 50 g of boron are plotted as

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 1957

functions of the distance from the nearest parallel

fuel plate in Fig. 5.2.30.

In another series of tests one and two boron-
loaded (50-g) aluminum plates were inserted in the
TSR-Il test cell (see Fig. 5.3.5 in Chap. 5.3)
in order to investigate the shading of one plate by
another. The plates were shimmed on opposite
sides of the test cell to a position 1.3 in. from the
nearest fuel plate. When both plates were in
position the separation distance between them was
3.4 in. The results of this series of tests are
also plotted in Fig. 5.2.30. For these tests the
change in reactivity was determined on the basis
of the reactivity when the test cell was filled with
water only, in which case the excess reactivity
was 1.1%.

Discussion of Errors.— The reactivities reported
for the tests described above were determined by
using the inhour equation, as described in the
preceding section of this chapter. As before,
no correction was made for the decreased age for
the delayed neutrons. The experimental reactivity
errors are small, being most dependent on the
influence of the condition of the test cell on the
calibration of the regulating rod. The magnitude

321
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

is in the order of +1% of the value of reactivity.
The design of the TSR-ll test rig was such that
fairly large errors could be made in the actual
average distance of movement of the plates, as
indicated by twist angle. However, because of the

322

consistentmovement of the plates from the position
closest to the fuel to the position farthest away in
order to avoid hysteresis, the uncertainty in
average plate movement was of the order of

+0.05 cm.

5.3. TOWER SHIELDING REACTOR-II

C. E. Clifford

Several developmental experiments are required
in order to obtain information needed in the design
of the 5-Mw solid-fuel Tower Shielding Reactor-||
(TSR-11),'2 a reactor that will have a higher and
a more uniform fast-neutron and gamma-ray leakage
flux than the present Tower Shielding Facility
reactor, TSR-l. These include studies to develop
methods for fabricating the fuel elements, experi-
ments to determine the water flow rate required to
prevent boiling in any fuel channel, and several
control-system studies. Some of these experiments
are now in progress and are described below.

FUEL-ELEMENT DEVELOPMENT?
The fuel plates for the TSR-ll (Fig. 5.3.1) will

be fabricated and assembled into elements by the
MTR techniques; however, it will be necessary to
alter the shape of the elements to attain a spherical-
shell core with an internal water reflector, In order
to accomplish this, each plate in each element
will have its own distinct size and radius of
curvature, At the ends of the reactor, that is,
above and below the internal reflector when the
fuel elements are in a vertical geometry, there
will be four pie-shaped elements consisting of
plates that will increase in length with distance
from the reactor axis. The arrangement of these
elements around the reactor axis will be such that
plates of the same size in the four elements will
form nearly cylindrical shells. The other fuel
elements, that is, the outer elements, will consist
of plates that will decrease in length with distance
from the reactor axis. The plates in these elements
also will form nearly cylindrical shells, whose
midpoints, in this case, will be at the center of
the reactor,

Design drawings? for the fuel elements have now
been completed, and the developmental work has

been divided into two phases. The first phase
is concerned only with fabricating the plates. To
date only three of these have been finished, but
the results are promising. The second phase
involves the mechanics of forming the correct
radius of curvature in each plate and then assem-
bling the plates into elements. The use of an
aluminum alloy (type 6951), which is much harder
pure aluminum (type 1100),
it feasible to use a three-roll hand roller

than conventional
makes
to curve the fuel plates. The most satisfactory
method of assembly tried thus far is a combination
of peening and tack-welding the plates into the
side plates, as shown in Fig. 5.3.2 for one of the
central elements. A completed central element is
in Fig. 5.3.3.
fuel elements will be started when a hand roller
with longer rollers is available.

COOLING-SYSTEM STUDIES?®

Since the fuel-element development has proceeded
satisfactorily it is planned to set up a complete
dummy core with which to perform experimental
flow studies of the proposed cooling system. In
these studies the water flow rate in the various
channels between the fuel plates will be measured,
With this information and the calculated power
distribution in the core, it will be possible to
calculate the exit temperature that can be expected
from each channel in the actual reactor. Adjust-
ments in the flow will be made until a fairly uni-
form exit temperature from all chennels is achieved,
Experiments to determine the cooling flow required
in the lead region will be conducted with the same
device. A Monte Carlo calculation has been
started to determine the heat generation in the lead.

CONTROL-SYSTEM STUDIES

As mentioned previously,? the TSR-Il will be
controlled by umbrella-shaped boron-loaded plates
located in the internal water reflector., The de-
velopment of this mechanism has been divided

into two studies. The first study is concerned

This study includes both the Oracle calculations
reported previously2 and experimental mockup
tests with the BSF reactor. The second study is
concerned with the development of a mechanism
for obtaining control under normal operation and
for quickly shutting down the reactor in any
potentially unsafe condition,

BSF Mockup Studies®

In order to obtain some experimental information
with which the results of the Oracle calcula-

326

tions could be compared, poison plates simulating
the proposed TSR-ll control device were operated
in a 6-in.-square water-filled hole in the center of
the BSF reactor. The fuel loading used for this
experiment was that shown in Fig. 5.3.4. The
control device consisted of four or eight stainless
steel or boron-loaded aluminum plates mounted
parallel to the sides of the aluminum can in which

they were operated. A sketch of a top view of the
assembly is shown in Fig. 5.3.5. On the top of
the can were placed two diagonal guide rods along
which angles supporting the control plates were
moved toward the center of the can. The size of
the opening limited the normal travel of the control
plates to about 1 in,

When all the eight plates shown in Fig. 5.3.5
were used, a complete shell was formed within the
water region. When only four plates were used,
alternate plates were removed and thus some
internal fuel areas were left without adjacent
control plates.

The boron-loaded plates did not give any worth-
while data because the excess loading of the
reactor was not sufficient to permit operation of
the reactor with the plates in any position. Both
solid and slotted stainless steel plates were used
in two configurations. The results of these ex-
periments are shown in Fig. 5.3.6, along with the
results of an Oracle calculation for a spherical
TSR-Il configuration.  An experiment more nearly
approximating the TSR-Il geometry is being de-
signed for a later test, and it is hoped that the

combination of hydraulic and mechanical forces.
The equipment layout used to conduct the tests
is shown in Fig. 5.3.8. The water pressure re-

operate the piston in the cylinder was indicated by
a Bourdon gage. Calculations had indicated that
a 66-psi line pressure should be sufficient to hold
the poppet against the positioning device for normal
operation and that reducing the pressure to below
50 psi should allow the spring force to overcome
the pressure in the cylinder so that the mechanism
would move away from the positioning device
toward the microswitch (in the reactor the control
plates would then move toward the fuel). The
actual pressure required to operate the mechanism
satisfactorily was 100 psi, and less than 45 psi
of pressure was needed to permit the spring to
overcome the hydraulic force. ‘

The information from the pressure cell was used
as input data to an oscilloscope (see Fig. 5.3.8),
and a trace was observed of the pressure vs the
operating time of the mechanism. The calculations
had indicated that full travel of the mechanism
and the control plate should be achieved in less
than 15 msec. The trace in Fig. 5.3.9 shows the
variation of the pressure during the entire period
covered between the scram signal and the closing
of the microswitch by the control plate, The over-
all operating time was 70 msec, of which 50 msec

 

was the time for movement of the mechanism. The
50-msec period is a factor of 3 greater than the
calculated period, but it is not unacceptable.
Further developmental work is being carried out
to determine whether mechanical friction or the
measuring instruments are contributing to the
discrepancy between calculated and actual values.

PROPOSED DESIGN REVISION

Until recently all experiments proposed for the
TSR-1l could best utilize the same vertical geometry
that is used with the present Tower Shielding
Reactor. Since interest in experiments utilizing
only the leakage radiation from the upper hemi-

sphere has now been expressed, methods are being
studied whereby the TSR-ll can be constructed
without any structural materials being present
above the core in the immediate vicinity of the
reactor, As yet no completely satisfactory method
has been devised.
