Results of Physical and Chemical Measurements

R. J. Sheil, R. B. Evans, and G. M. Watson

ABSTRACT
The observed changes in dimensions, weight, and

in contact for a year with flowing liquid LiF-BeF,-
UF, (62~37~1 mole %) in a pump loop at 1300°F are
listed. On the average the change in diameter was
less than 0.02%, and the change in weight was less
than 0.03%. Chemical analyses of machine cuttings
from the graphite rods show average uranium and
beryllium concentrations of approximately 20 and 100

 MOLTEN SALT~-GRAPHITE COMPATIBILITY TEST
RESULTS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS

In a graphite moderated-molten salt reactor, certain
advantages are possible if the graphlte is in direct contact
with the circulating fluid. The feasibility of such a design,
which depends to a large extent on the compatibility of the
graphite-fused salt system, was tested by inserting 56 samples
of an impervious graphite contained by INOR=8 in a flowing

stream of LiF~BeF,-~UF, (62-37-1 mole %) for a period of one -
year at 1300°F.

The_experimental assembly consisted_of’a pump loop
constructed and operated by the Metallurgy Division and the
Experimental Engineering section of the Reactor Projects
Division as described elsewhere,l

 

Graphite Loop - Initial Preparations

Two sets of graphite specimens were obtained from the
National Carbon Company. All rods were 11" long and either
1/2" or 3/16™ in diameter. After calipering and weighing,
the rods were packaged in an INOR-8 box as shown in Figures 1
and 2. Each of the larger was fitted with four spacing rings
to permit the desired flow characteristics and to provide
samples for carburization and metallographic examination.

Upon welding the cover plate in place, the assembly was

swaged in the loop and the graphite degassed under. vacuum for

24 hours-at 1100°F., It was then repressured with argon before
being contacted with salt. During operation, a total presspre
of 13 psig was maintained on the graphite; 3 psig the contri-
bution of the helium cover blanket and the remaining due to
the head developed by the pump-rate of 1.1 gal/min., VWhen the
test was completed, the salt was drained from the loop and

‘sampled for optical_micrqscopy,_X~ray and wet chemical analyses.

to molten fluorides for one year at 1300°F.

Post Test Examinations

A. Salt Condition. =~ The chemical analysis, given in
Table I shows the chromium content of the salt increased from
135 ppm to 550 ppm. Petrographic and X-ray analyses did not
reveal any oxidation products or dissolved carbon.

 

B. Graphite Condition

 

1. Chemical Analyses Data. Machined increments
of graphite specimens were submitted for chemical analysis.
Successive cuttings, 1/32™ in depth were taken from two of
the larger diameter rods until center portions of less than
3/16™ diameter were left. These portions and "as received™
impervious graphite "blanks™ were then ground to =100 mesh
in a mortar and pestle (thoroughly scoured with Ottawa Sand
according to the recommendations of the Analytical Chemistry
Division after ‘each grinding). All graphite samples were
submitted for an analysis of the uranium and beryllitm con-
centrations. Two machine cuttings, 1/32" in depth, were taken
from four additional rods. These results are given in .
Table IX with the beryllium and concentrations graphed as a
function of penetration depth in Figure 4. Only a very slight
migration of salt to the center of the graphite is noted.

2. Physical Changes in Graphite. Macroscopically,

there was no change in the rods. None of the samples were -

- broken or distorted and except for the bottom layer of rods
- that was covered with solidified melt, the salt did not adhere

- to the graphite. The weight and dimensional changes observed
af ter they had been contacted with circulating fluorides are
listed in Table III. The dimensional changes for the 13-~1/2"
diameter rods corresponded to an average loss of less than
0.5 mil in diameter which approximates the probable error of
the measurements. . Otherwise, there was no evidence of erosion.
Weight losses, which ranged from negligible to 0.05% and |
averaged 0.02% could be attributed to desorption of residual
gases from the graphite. No statistically significant differ=- -
ences were noted in the 13-1/2" diameter rods as compared with
‘the 8-3/16" diameter rods for whichnweight data were available.

Based on the 1oss in weight of the test samples and the

chemical analyses of the machine cuttings, it appears that only
minute quantltles of salt permeated the graphite.
