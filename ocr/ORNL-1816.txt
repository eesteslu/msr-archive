FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL re-
cords the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and all other
ANP research at the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided
into three major parts: . Reactor Theory, Component Development, and Construction,
Il. Materials Research, and ill, Shielding Research,

The ANP Project is comprised of about 400 technical and scientific personnel engaged
in many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of air-
craft, A considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other
organizations participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP
research at ORNL is directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The effort on circulating-fuel reactors was, until recently, centered upon the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment. This experiment has now been completed, and the operating ex-
perience is described in Section 1 of Part |,

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), formerly
the Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment (CFRE), with the cooperation of the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are now the specific long-range objectives. The ART
is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and adequate means for heat disposal. Operation of the system will be for the
purpose of determining the feasibility, and the problems associated with the design, con-
struction, and operation, of a high-power, circulating-fuel, reflector-moderated aircraft
reactor system. The design work, as well as the supporting research on materials and
problems peculiar to the ART (previously included in the subject sections), is now re-
ported as a subsection of Part |, Section 2, ‘‘Reflector-Moderated Reactor."

SUMMARY

PART I. REACTOR THEORY, COMPONENT
DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION
1. Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated
successfully for over 100 Mw/hr. During this
time the maximum equilibrium outlet fuel tempera-
ture was 1580°F, and the maximum power level
was over 2.5 Mw. The temperature coefficient of
reactivity 2 min after the introduction of a pertur-
bation was —5.5 x 10~3, although its instantaneous
value was considerably higher. As a result, the
reactor was extremely stable while operating at
power, and there were no control problems. The
critical mass was 32.5 Ib of U235 and thus was
in reasonable agreement with the calculated
value of 30 ib. 7

Operation of the process systems and their
instrumentation was exceptionally trouble-free
during the six days of operation rom the time the

‘equipment was sealed in the pits until the sodium

and the fuel were dumped.
It is believed that most of the fission-product

- gases evolved from the liquid fuel. In a 25-hr run,

it was determined that no more than 1 part in 30 of
the xenon poison remained in the fuel.

An unexpectedly steep initial slope that was
observed in the usual plot of [1 = (1/multiplication

constant)} was found to be due to the formation of
a_thermal-flux maximum near fhe flssaon chombers\_“

Fuel samples were withdrawn from the ARE
during operation below criticality and at very low
power. As was anticipated, the chromium content
of the fuel increased after each addition of fuel
concentrate. Just before the first additions of fuel
concentrate were made, the chromium concentration
of the carrier material was 100 ppm and the carrier
had been circulated for 155 hr. Since the system
had been operating isothermally, the chromium
content of 100 ppm was considered to represent
0.5 mil of attack on the Inconel. By the time the
final sample was taken, after a total of 307 hr of
operation, the chromium content was 445 ppm,
which represents about 5 mils of attack. A plot
of the data obtained showed that the chromium
content of the fuel had started to level off. Since
it was not possible to sample the fuel during full
power operation, no information on mass transfer
can be obtained until the equipment can be sec-
tioned.

The reactor assembly and the installation for
the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), formerly the
Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE), have

main sources: the activity of the cobalt in the
Inconel and the activity of the fission fragments
that strike the Inconel and remain there. The
analysis showed that little would be gained by
trying to obtain cobalt-free Inconel, since the
activity could not be reduced below that caused
by the fission fragments. Adjustments are being

‘made in the constants used in multigroup calcu-

lations in order to decrease the disparity between
the calculations and the results of critical experi-
ments. '

The various types of facilities suitable for the
“operation of the ART have been considered, and it

is now planned to install the reactor assembly in a
double-walled container with a water-filled annulus.
The type of container was selected after careful con-
sideration of the hazards involved in the operation

~ ofthe reactor. This typeof installation provides for

containing the products resulting from a nuclear
accident and/or chemical reaction of all combusti-
bles in the installation, minimizing the likelihood
of serious damage from an explosion caused by
sabotage or bombing, and removing and disposing
of volatile fission products evolved during the
course of operation,

3. Experimental Reactor Engineering

Progress has been made in the design and testing
of components for a horizontal, entirely enclosed
loop for insertion in an MTR beam hole. The loop
will be used to circulate proposed reactor fuels in
the MTR flux so that radiation effects on the fuel
can be studied. A layout arrangement of the loop
has been made and is being improved consistent
with specification and component changes. Tests
of two horizontal-shaft sump-type pumps were made
with the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF, circulating at
a temperature of 1350°F for 500 and 1000 hr,
respectively.  The Graphitar-lapped steel face
plates wore considerably in both tests, but they
did not fail. A single-tube salt-to-air heat ex-
changer that will fit inside the beam hole has been
fabricated.

- Sump pumps of the type used in the ARE are

being evaluated for application in large-scale heat

exchanger tests, and pumps for ART use are being
developed. One ARE-type sump pump is being

tested at K-25 for performance and life determina-

tions. The pump is operating at pump speeds of

" up to 1500 rpm at a maximum capacity of 40 gpm,
~and it is circulating the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF,-
UF, at a maximum pump inlet temperature of

1350°F. Operating time now exceeds 3000 hr,
The pumps for the ART inherently possess many
imposing design problems because of the large
capacity requirements:  fuel pumps, 650 gpm,
50-ft head; sodium pumps, 430 gpm, 125-ft head;
NaK pumps, 2800 gpm, 280-ft head. Investigations
of impeller cavitation characteristics and inlet
and entry conditions are being made, along with
studies of sealing, cooling, lubricating, and driving
problems, _

Forced-circulation corrosion and mass transfer
tests with fused salts in Inconel systems are under
way. Considerable difficulty has been experienced
with failures of the thin-walled tubing (l/z-in. oD,
0.020~in. wall thickness) at bends and welded
joints. The loop design has been altered by elimi-
nation of the economizer and by using 0.045-in.-
wall tubing. One loop of the modified design is
now being operated and has accumulated about 150
hr at a Reynolds number of 10,000 and a tempera-~
ture gradient of 200°F.

A third beryllium-sodium-Inconel mass transfer
test has been completed following 1000 hr of
operation. The maximum operating temperature (at
the beryllium section) was 1300°F, and the
Reynolds number was about 190,000. Another
similar loop has been fabricated and is being
assembled. A loop in which sodium will be circu-
lated in type 316 stainless steel is being fabri-
cated.

The heat exchanger test program has included a
header leak test and a series of pump tests with
an ARE moderator-coolant type of pump. The
header leak test (fuel to NaK) showed that self-
plugging of an NaF-ZrF ,.UF , fuel through 0.002-
in.-dia leaks can occur. The pump tests showed
that speeds of up to 3700 rpm could be safely
achieved with this type of pump.

Developmental work on a gas-furnace heat source
that can be used in large heat exchanger tests was
continued. A sodium-cooled 100-kw furnace was
tested for about 120 hr before a gross leak termi-
nated further operation. An output of 85 kw was
obtained at a sodium outlet design temperature of
1500°F. Two natural-gas burners, based on @
design development of the Esso Marketers, were
built and tested. Heat releases of 400 kw at
3100°F were achieved with the first burner, and
1 Mw ot 3300°F was obtained with a second
burner that was improved on the basis of the daia
obtained from the first burner.

A trap for fluoride vapors was developed that
can be used in any high-temperature molten fluoride
system to prevent plugging of the gas lines leading
to or from the vessel containing the fluoride,
particularly if the salt contains ZrF ,. Successful
operation of this device was achieved during the
ARE pump tests at K-25. '

4. Critical Experiments

The second critical assembly of the reflector-
moderated reactor was constructed that incorporated
a beryllium island. Criticality was achieved with
4.66 kg of U235 at a density of 0.092 g of U235 pe
cubic centimeter of fuel annulus. This Iocding
was shown, by calibrated controf rods, to contain
0.92% excess reactivity, equivalent to about 0.31
kg of U235, and therefore the critical mass of the
unpoisoned assembly was 4.35 kg of U235, The
experimental results thus did not agree well with
the calculated critical fuel loading of 7.16 kg of
U_235 or 0.142 g of U235 per cubic centimeter of
fuel annulus. A series of measurements of neutron
and fission-rate dls’rrlbuflons and of reactivity

_coeffuments will be made prior to the incorporation,

in the structure, of additional materials to simulate
reactor components.

temperature than would have been expected in the
absence of KF. For differential thermal analysis
of the uranium-bearing mixtures, improved graphite
containers with provision for the thermocouples to
be immersed directly in the melt are now being
used,

Investigations of the chemical reactions in
molten salts are continuing in an effort to under-
stand the mechanisms involved in the purification
of fluoride mixtures and in the reduction of UF
to UF, in fluoride melts. Similar studies of the
corrosion products of Inconel in fluoride mixtures
and of the reduction of UF, by s’rructurai metals
are under way.

Production of purified zirconium-base fluorides
mixtures has been continued on a large scale in
the 250-lb-capacity facility. |t is anticipated that
by full-time operation of this facility by a crew
of one engineer and eight technicians, a sufficient
stock pile of material will be available by December
31, 1954 to allow termination of this operation for
some time, This stock pile {to be ~7000 Ib)
should be sufficient to meet the requirements of
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, other outside requesters,
and those of the Laboratory for research in this
field.

The pilot-scale processing facility continues to
be used for small-scale development of purification
processes for new fuel compositions of interest.
Considerable effort has been expended on attempts
to prepare UF ,-bearing mixtures of NaF-LiF-KF.
Careful control of operating conditions has allowed
production of sufficiently consistent UF j-content

6. Corrosmn Research

Stud:es of the corrosion of Inconel, type 316
stainless steel, Hastelloy B, and several special
alloys when exposed to the fluoride mixtures of
interest were continued through the use of thermal-
convection apparatus. In the studies of Inconel
loops containing UF, in alkali-metal-base mixtures,
considerable difficulty was encountered in making
the mixtures, in controlling the total uranium con-
tent, and in determining the ratio of UF, to UF,.
Conflicting data were obtained, and efforts are
now being made to achieve better control of the
variagbles involved. An alkali-metal-base mixture
~ containing UF, was also circulated in type 316

stainless steel loops, and, as in the Inconel loops,
‘considerable mass transfer occurred.

Thermal-convection loops constructed of Hastel-
oy B were operated with NaF-ZrF -UF (50-46-4
moie %), with NaF-KF-LiF (11 5-42 0- 46 5 mole %)
containing 12 wt % uranium as UF,, and with
sodium as the circulated fluids. The loops which
circulated the fluoride mixtures showed only small
amounts of corrosion — 1.5 to 3 mils, The period
of operation of the loop has not had a noticeable
effect on the corrosion; therefore it is felt that the
small amount of corrosion that occurs takes place
in a short time and may be a function of the condi-
tion of the original surface. The Hastelloy B
loops operated with sodium exhibited considerable
mass transfer. Since the loops were known to be
covered with an oxide deposit and were not cleaned
before they were filled, additional loops are to be
operated to determine whether the mass transfer
was caused by contamination. Loops constructed
of several modified Inconel-type alloys were
operated with NaF-ZrF ,-UF,. The data obtained
from these loops indicate that reduction of the
chromium content of the alloy to 5% or less greatly
reduces corrosion.
~Tests of the compatibility of sodium, beryllium,
and Inconel in a system have indicated that at
1300°F the flow rate of the sodiumand the spacing

-~ between the beryllium and the Inconel are the con-

trolling factors, Beryllium surfaces exposed to
flowing sodium are unattacked, but surfaces ex-
posed to relatively stagnant sodium at 1300°F
show dissimilar metal mass transfer between the

beryllium and the Inconel. Tests are under way to
determine the minimum spacing that can be tolerated

between beryllium and Inconel when exposed to

slow-moving sodium,

Several type 304 stainless steel T-joints brazed
with experimental alloys prepared by the Wall
Colmonoy Corporation were fested in sodium and
in NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,. Most of the alloys had ‘good
resistance to the fluoride mixture, but only the
10.2% P-13% Cr-76.8% Ni alloy had good resis-
tance in both sodium and the fluoride mixture.
Several T-joints of A-nickel were also brazed
with various alloys and tested in the fluoride
mixture NaF-ZrF -UF , and in sodium hydroxide.
All the alloys tested hod good resistance in the
fluoride mixture, except the 69% Ni-20% Cr-11%
Si alloy, whereas all the alloys had poor resistance
to sodium hydroxide, except the 82% Au-— ]8% Ni
alloy.

The carbides of titanium, zirconium, chromium,
and boron were corrosion tested in fused fluorides,
in sodium, and in lithium. For the most part, these
carbides showed fair resistance in the various
media, except B,C, which was rather severely
attacked in sodium and in lithium. The agueous
corrosion resistance of an 80% Mg-20% Li alloy
which has been proposed as a crew-compartment
shielding material is being studied. Dynamic
tests of the resistance of Inconel to attack by
rubidium are under way.  Preliminary results
showed maximum attack in the hot leg to a depth
of 1 mil,

Previous tests on the mass transfer character-
istics of container materials in liquid lead indi-
cated that alloys in which intermetallic-compound
formation was possible showed a marked increase
in resistance to mass transfer as compared with
the pure components of the materials. Additional
tests of this hypothesis have now been conducted.
The work on fused hydroxides has centered on the
development of a systematic chemistry of these
substances. By an application of an acid-based
theory, at least 12 types of acid-base analog
reactions are predicted for the fused hydroxide
systems. Each of these types is briefly discussed

in the text. Work on the flammability of alkali-

metal solutions at high temperatures has continued,

and additional data have been obtained for bismuth-
rich alloys with sodium which provide a more com-

plete picture of the reactivity of this system. The
effect of water vapor on the reactivity of these
alloys has also been studied,

In further chemical studies of corrosion, informa-
tion was obtained on the effect of temperatures
and of chromium additions on the corrosion of
Inconel by fluoride melts with NiF, additions.

7. Meta"urgy and Ceramics

The nickel-molybdenum-base alloys are being
studied extensively as possible reactor structural
materials with qualities superior to those of Inconel.
Attempts are being made to improve the ductility
and the fabricability of commercial Hastelloy B
through purification and to find another suitable
and improved nickel-molybdenum-base alloy that
has the strength and corrosion resistance of Hastel-
loy B. The results of attempis to improve the
fabricability of the materials are being evaluated
by extrusion experiments because extruded seamless
tubing will be required if any of these alloys are
to replace Inconel as a reactor structural material,
Temperature-cycling tests in air were performed
with Hastelloy B and other nickel-molybdenum
alloys to determine the behavior to be expected in
an NaK-to-air heat exchanger such as will be

required for aircraft application. These tests have
shown that oxidation protection will be required.

Three radiator test specimens have been con-

structed of Hastelloy B for studying the fabrication
methods and for determining the thermal shock and
oxidation resistance of a complicated assembly,
The specimens contained 20 tube-to-header joints,
which were inert-arc welded by using semiautomatic
welding equipment, and 3 in. of Inconel-ciad copper
fins spaced 15 fins per inch and brazed to the tube

Thirty-five control rods are being prepared for

A finned surface for a fused salt-to-air heat
exchanger being considered for use in conjunction
with an in-pile forced-circulation loop was fabri-
cated and tested for corrosion resistance to the
fused salt., The corrugated fins were formed from
0.010-in,-thick nickel sheet and were brazed to a
3/a-in.-OD Inconel tube with an 82% Au-~18% Ni
brazing alloy. A 0.020-in.-dia nickel wire was
used as a spacer between each fin segment, and
it served to provide a capillary path for the braze
alloy, which was preplaced at the fin interlock
joint only. The braze alloy used was found to have
excellent resistance both to air and to the fused
salt.

Beryllium oxide ceramics were produced, proba-

systems were compiled, and apparatus was de-
veloped for measuring the over-all radial tempera-
ture difference (or heat transfer coefficient) for a
modified version of the flat-plate system in which
it will not be necessary to measure fluid temper-
atures. _

" Several approximate mathematical temperature
"soiuflons for forced-flow volume-heot-source en-
fronce systems were developed which can be used
to predict the temperature structure of struts or
screens located in circulating-fuel reactor flow
passages. The question as to whether electric
currents, which generate heat in the circulating
fluids of experimental volume-heat-source systems,
affect the fluid flow characteristics was investi-
gated. It was found that the hydrodynamic structure
was not mfluenced by the presence of the electric
currents.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF- -ZrF -
(53-43-4 mole %) were determined; the heat
_ éqpacity in the solid state over the temperature

~range 70 to 525°C was found to be 0.18 cal/g.°C,
and the heat capacity in the liquid state over the
temperature range 570 to 885°C was found to be
0.26 cal/g-°C. The enthalpies and heat capacities
of LiF-KF-UF, (48-48-4 mole %) were also ob-
tained; the heat capacity in the solid state over
the temperature range 125 to 465°C was found to
be 0.234 + (0.95 x 10=4) cal/g-°C, and in the
liquid state over the temperature range 565 to
880°C it was found to be 0.657 - (3.93 x 10~4);
cal/g-°C. The viscometry equipment used earlier
was modified so that the accuracy of liquid vis-
cosity measurements was significantly increased.
The more accurate measurements obtained for
i\iaF‘-ZrFﬂ-UF4 (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) were 30%
lower than the preliminary values reported previ-
ously. The thermal conductivity of molten NaF-
ZrFA-UF4 (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) was found to be
1.2 Btu/hr-ft.°F. The thermal conductivities of
the alkali fluoride mixture NaF-KF-LiF with and
without UF, were compared in the liquid and solid
states.

- 9. Radiation Damage
The program of MIR

capsules containing fused fluoride fuels has been
continued, and irradiated capsules containing both

irradiations of Inconel

- UF,- and UF ,-bearing mixtures have been ex-

-3 ) .
" amined. There was practically no corrosion of the

irradiated UF j-bearing capsules nor of one of the

irradiated UF ,-bearing capsules. There were no
significant differences in the iron, chromium, or
nickel contents of the irradiated fuels, as com-
pared with the starting fuel batches, and there was
no evidence of segregation of either uranium or
impurities, An improved version of the capsule
irradiation facility has been put into service, and,
to speed up the program, arrangements have been
made for irradiating two capsules simultaneously
in separate, but adjacent, facilities in the MTR.
Examinations of a welded nickel capsule con-
taining a UF ,«C,F | solution that was irradiated
in the ORNL Graphite Reactor indicated the un-
suitability of the solution for use as fuel in a
mockup of a circulating-fuel reactor.

A miniature in-pile loop designed for insertion
in a vertical hole in the LITR was bench tested
and was found to be satisfactory. The bench test
included four freezing and melting cycles in 260 hr
of operation at a maximum temperature of 466°F,
Since it was possible to freeze and melt the fused
salt without causing failure of the loop, it may be
advisable to fill the in-pile loop before it is in-
serted in the reactor and then to melt the fuel
mixture after the loop is in position, A Delco
motor has been rebuilt to withstand radiation and
the high temperatures to be used for the in-pile
joop. Heat transfer calculations that predict the
thermal behavior of the loop were completed. A
second model of the loop for insertion in the LITR
is being constructed.

Plans were completed for an in-pile study of the
removal of xenon from molten fluoride fuels under
ART conditions,

The horizontal type of fuel-circulating loop
designed for irradiation in the LITR has been
operated out-ofpile with a non-uranium-bearing
salt and is now being inserted in the HB-2 facility
of the LITR. The creep-test apparatus for testing
Inconel at high temperatures in the MTR is being
bench tested. The stress-corrosion apparatus for
LITR operation has been successfully bench tested,
and an in-pile apparatus is being constructed,
Remote metallographic studies of solid fuel ele-
ments were continued, and additional information
on the relationship between UO, particle size and
radiation damage was obtained,

reactor fuels. Uranium metal is determined by
converting it to UH, with hydrogen at 250°C, then
increasing the temperature in an atmosphere of
carbon dioxide to 400°C to decompose the hydride,
and finally measuring the volume of gas liberated
as a consequence of thermal decomposition. Under
these conditions, CO, was reduced to CO by urani-
um metal and also by UF,. A trap of 1,0, was
incorporated to oxidize CO and thus remove this
source of error,

A solution of methylene blue was found to oxidize
trivalent uranium quantitatively to the tetravalent
state without liberation of hydrogen. A procedure
in which methylene blue is used as the oxidant was
developed for the determination of trivalent uranium
in a variety of materials, The method appears to
be applicable to routine analysis.

Two other reagents, cupric chloride and titanium
tetrachloride, will, under selected conditions,
oxidize trivalent uranium to the quadrivalent state
only. The latter reagent can probably be adapted
to an automatic coulometric titration procedure for
this purpose, '

Calibration of the apparatus for the determination
of oxygen as oxide in fluoride reactor fuels was
completed for quantities of oxygen up to 235
mg/liter, In this range the relationship log
k/c = A\Jc + B isvalid; k is the specific conduc-
tivity of water in HF, ¢ is the concentration, and
A and B are constants,

A colorimetric method was adapted for the de-
termination of sulfur as sulfate or sulfide in fluoride

11, Recovery and Reprocessirﬁg of Reactor Fuel

A plant for recovering (in seven batches) the
uranivm from the ARE fuel and rmse by the
fluoride-volatility process is being demgned and
construction is scheduled for completion by
December 31, 1955, It is estimated that the amount
of material to be processed will be 12,4 #3 of
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, containing 65 kg of uranium, This
plant will demonstrate, on a pilot-plant scale, the
feasibility of the fluoridesvolatility process as
applied to the processing of a circulating-fuel
aircraft reactor, The feasibility of the process has
been established on a laboratory scale. The basic
equipment, as now envisioned, will consist of a
fluorinator, an absorption column packed with NaF,
a cold-trap system, and a fluorine disposal unit,

This method of recovery and decontamination can
also be used for processing heterogeneous reactor
fuel elements of the type that can be dissolved in
fused fluoride salt by means of hydrogen fluoride.

Calculations made by the Monte Carlo method
with the use of the ORACLE were complefed for
the attenuation of gamma rays in the sides of a
a two-component crew shield and the heating by
gamma rays in the beryllium slabs adjacent to the
gamma-ray slab source. The resulis of the gamma-

ray hecmng study are of interest for calculations of
thermal stresses and consequenf coohng require-

ments for the reﬂecfor _region of the CIrculatmg-

fuel reflector-moderoted reactor. Attempts were

made to_incorporate the Biology Planning Chart

:_l_recommenda"hbrnws into shield designs. It was

demons’rroted that the chcrt could be supplcmfed by

incident on crew shield sides and rear. In ad-
dition, more detailed calculations of the TSF data
were made to estimate the fraction of scattered
radiation at the maximum altitude which is attribute
able to ground scattering. There is evidence that
for many measurements it will be about 1%, and for
highly anisotropic shields such as the GE-ANP
R-1 it will be no more than about 5%. The con-
clusion is reached that the TSF towers are high
enough for experiments applicable to high-flying
alrplcnes.

- 13, L:d Tank Shielding Facility
At the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) the

effective neutron removal cross section for lithium
was determined as 1,01 + 0.04 barns, The meas-
urements were made in a medium of oil behind a
solid slab of lithium. The experimentation with

_GE -ANP hehcal air ducts was continued, and

measuremenfs have now been made beyond an array

‘of fhlrfy-flve 3-in.-dia ‘ducts both in a medium of

water and in a gamma shield medium of steel
Raschig rings and borated water. The presence of
the ducts in plain water increased the thermal-
neutron flux by a factor of 300; in the gamma shield
medium the ducts increased the flux by a factor of
3000, Preparations for the reflector-moderated
reactor and shield mockup tests are being com-
pleted. It is now planned to use solid UO, as the
simulated fuel in the mockups. The UO, will be
mounted on a movable belt.

14. Bulk Shielding Facility
The Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF) was shut

down during much of the quarter for modifications

to the reactor pool. These modifications will per-
mit the use of demineralized water in the pool,
and thus they will eliminate corrosion of the
reactor fuel elements. Several BSF staff members
participated in a program to discover any short-
period isomeric gamma-ray transitions which might
be present in K39, Rb85, Rb87, and Zr?0. Measure-
ments were made at the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
and no previously unknown short-period isomers
were found in K39, Rb®3, or Rb®7. Zirconium-90
yielded a 2.30 £ 0.03-Mev gamma ray with a half-
life of about 0.83 * 0.03 sec. This may be of
importance in design considerations for a circu-
lating-fuel reactor. |

15. Tower Shielding Facility

Measorements made around the GE-ANP R-1
reactor shield in the TSF pool were compared with
similar measurements made earlier at the BSF.
The variation of the thermal-neutron intensity as
the altitudes of the mockup and TSF detector tank
were varied simultanecusly was also measured.
The data indicated that ground-scattered neutrons
are still observable at the maximum altitude for
this particular reactor-shield combination.  For
tests at the 195-ft altitude, lead was placed in the
rear of the detector tank to simulate the shielding
in the crew compartment, and the thermal-neutron
flux and gamma-ray dose rate distributions within
the tank were determined. This experiment was
interrupted for o period of 2"/2 weeks so that the
TSF could participate in an Air Force Project in
which a group of monkeys were exposed to massive
neutron radiation doses.

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT

- The Aircraft Reactor Experiment was success-
fully operated during the quarter. Uranium in the
form of molten Na,UF, was added to the barren
carrier, NaZrF., with which the fuel system was
initially filled, to make the reactor critical. The
fuel composition at initial criticality was 52.8-
41.5-5.7 mole % (NaF-ZrF,-UF,), which has a
melting point of 990°F, whereas the final fuel
mixture {which included excess uranium) had a

~ composition of 53.2-40.5-6.3 mole % (NaF-ZrF,-

UF,) and a melting point of 1000°F,

It was initially intended to remotely add the
concentrate to the fuel system from a large tank
which contgined all the concentrate, after first

‘passing it through an intermediate transfer tank.

This system was discarded when temperature-
control and continuous-weight-measuring instru-
mentation on the transfer tank proved to be un-
satisfactory. Instead, o less elaborate, but more
direct, method of concentrate addition was em-
ployed. This enrichment operation invoived the
successive connection of numerous small concen-
trate containers to an intermediate transfer pot,
which was, in turn, connected to the fuel system
by a line which injected the concentrate in the
pump above the liquid level. Each of the concen-
trate containers was weighed before and after a
transfer in order to determine the amount of
uranium injected into the system. The concentrate
was supplied in batches in cans containing from
about 0.25 ib of N°2UF5 (for rod calibration) up
to about 33 |b (as was used during the first
subcritical loading). In the enrichment operation
the pump bowl served as a mixing chamber and
uniformly distributed the concentrate inté the

 circulating stream. (For details of the loading

operation see following subsection on ‘‘Loading

of the ARE.”)

 .The first concentrate addition was made on
October 30, but the reactor did not become critical

until three days later (3:45 PM, November 3).
Most of the intervening time was spent in clearing
the end of the transfer line at the pump, which,
because of limitations inherent to only this par-

ticular design, was difficult to heat and even more
difficult to service.

The approach to criticality was carefully charted
after each fuel addition. The resultant curve of
reactivity [1 — (1/multiplication constant)] as a
function of the addition of fuel (in terms of pounds
of U235 per cubic foot) is presented in Fig. 1.1.
The data from three different ionization chambers
are presented; meters Nos. 1 and 2 were fission
chambers located in the reflector, and the BF3
counter was located external to the reactor at the
mid-plane of the cylindrical side. The unique
shape of these curves (which, when first extrapo-
lated, suggested a much lower critical mass than
was actually required) is believed to be due to
the particular radial flux distribution of the reactor
at the location of the chambers and the change
in this distribution as criticality was approached.

The calculated volume of the carrier in the fuel
system (before concentrate addition) was 4.82 3.
(The only significant check on this value was

obtained from subsequent analyses of fuel samples,
together with the known amounts of concentrate
added.) While the total amount of vranium (U23%)
added to the system in order to make the reactor
critical was approximately 135 |b, because of the
amounts withdrawn from the system for samples
and in trimming the pump level, the uranium
concentration at criticality was 23.7 Ib/#3; or,
since the calculated volume of the 1300°F core
was 1.37 3, the ‘‘cold,”” clean critical mass of
the reactor was 32.5 1b of U235,

~ Low-Power Experiments

Several ‘‘experiments’’ were performed on the
critical reactor at low power, including reactor
power and rod calibrations. In addition, the
effects of the process system parameters on re-
activity were noted, and a preliminary measure-
ment of the temperature coefficient was under-
taken. The tests were started on the morning of

November 4 and were completed by noon on

November 8.

The regulating rod was calibrated both by the
addition of fuel and by a determination of the
resultant pile period upon withdrawing the rod

(as derived from the inhour equation). The value
of the rod was first obtained by noting the amount
of rod insertion required to maintain a constant
power level as a finite amount of fuel was added
to the system. This information, together with
a calculated value of the mass reactivity coef-
ficient (Ak/k)/(Am/m) of 0.232, permitted a de-
termination of the value of the rod. The technique
of rod calibration by pile period was also employed
both at design fuel flow (48 gpm) and with no fuel
flow. The data from each of these tests are
presented in Fig. 1.2. Although there is con-
siderable scatter, the data from the different rod
calibration techniques appear to be mutually con-
firmatory, and a rod value of 0.032 Ak/in, obtained
from the data was used throughout the remainder
of the experiment. It should be noted, however,
that the period calibration with no flow is believed
to give the best data, since the inhour equation
is applicable without correction and the resultant
value of the rod is not dependent-on a reactivity
coefficient, ,

The reactor power was first estimated from the
fission chamber counting rate, but attempts were
made to confirm the estimate by operating the

clean reactor af a low power for a 1-hr period and
then withdrawing a fuel sample and taking a count
of the sample. This calibration was attempted
first at an eshma’red power of 1T w and then at
10 w. The fuel activity from the 1- whr run was
too low for an cccurate ‘count to be made, but
that from the ]0 whr run indicated a power of
13.5 w. The nuclear instrumentation was cali-
brated on the basis of this power determination.
t developed later that almost all the volatile, as
well as the gaseous, fission products were ap-
parently continuously removed from the fuel at
the pump, and consequenﬂy the actual power was
probably much greater than ‘that mdlcafed by the
fuel sample.

‘Attempts were made to measure the temperature

'coefflcrent when the reactor was subcrmcql and
‘again during the low-power operation. In both

instances it was estabhshed that the coefﬂctenr
wds hegative, and, in the latter case, it was

~ determined that the magnitude was approximately

5 x 103 Ak/F, A more accurate determination
of the magnitude of the temperature coefficient
was deferred until the high-power runs were made.

As a part of the low-power operation, the shim
rods were calibrated in terms of the regulating
rod. Each of the three shim rods had approxi-
mately 0.15% Ak/in. for most of their 36 in. of
travel.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Once high power was attained, the reactor was
operated at various power levels during the next
several days, as required, to complete the desired
tests, These tests included measurement of the
temperature coefficient of reactivity, a power cali-

 bration from the process instrumentation, and a

determination of the effect of large increases in
reactivity, and they were concluded by a 25-hr
run at full power to determine whether there was
a detectable buildup of xenon.

The temperature coefficient of reactivity was

determined simply by placing the regulating rod

on the flux servo and then increasing the speed
of the blower cooling the fuel. The change of
rod position (converted into reactivity) divided by

. the change in the reactor mean temperature de-

termined the reactor temperature coefficient. The
absolute value of this coefficient was initially
quite large, and it decreased after 2 min to a
relatively constant value of —5.5 x 107°% Ak/°F
Further analysis of the data is under way to
ascertain the precise value of the instantaneous
fuel temperature coefficient, which is, of course,
the most important characteristic affecting the
control of a power reactor. It is certain that this
coefficient was considerably larger than was ex-
pected and that the reactor was exceptionally
stable. ,

In this, as in any potential power reactor, the
reactor behavior as a result of large increases
in either reactivity or power demand is of par-
ticular interest. With a circulating-fuel reactor
operating to produce power, insertion of the safety
rods reduces the reactor mean temperature. The
power level, on the other hcmd is controlled by

fthe rate at which heat is withdrawn from the

in about 8 min. However, by this time the reactor
mean temperature was 1380°F, and it was there-
fore decreased (to 1350°F) by inserting the shim
rods. The reactor was again brought from low
power to high power in 2 min, and after 8 min at
high power the shim rods were withdrawn to in-
crease the mean temperature. It is most sig-
nificant that during the 2-min interval required to
bring the reactor from a nominal power of 100 kw
to 2.5 Mw the shortest recorded pile period was
only 14 sec. Furthermore, when at high power,
group withdrawal of the shim rods (0.02% Ak/sec)
. resulted in a pile period of only 10 sec., These
““two limiting periods were consistently repro-
ducible. |

Additional insight into the behavior of the
negative temperature coefficient is also afforded
by Fig. 1.3. By time 84 min, the blower was off
and the reactor power was reduced to about
100 kw. The shim rods were then inserted to
make the reactor subcritical, At 86 min, the fuel
helium blower was turned on. The higher density

14

cooled fuel made the reactor critical, and in 2 min
a AT of about 200°F was obtained. At this time,
however, the blower speed was automatically
reduced by a low-temperature signal. The blowers
were subsequently shut off and the shims inserted.

Although the reactor power level had been cali-
brated against the activity count of a fuel sample,
the actual reactor power remained in doubt through-
out the experiment, not only because of uncertainty
regarding the retention of fission products by the
fuel but also because of discrepancies in heat
balances in the process systems, that is, heat
removed from fuel and sodium vs heat picked up
in their water heat dumps. While the causes of
these discrepancies are now being analyzed in
detail, the most reliable estimate of the reactor
power is believed to be that obtained from the
temperature differences and flows in the fuel and
sodium systems. During one typical period of
power operation, the fuel AT of 370°F at 45 gpm
accounted for more than 1.9 Mw in the fuel, while
the sodium AT of 115°F at 150 gpm accounted

148

At

i

for more than 0.6 Mw in the sodium, which result
in a total reactor power in excess of 2.5 Mw. The
temperature differences quoted were obtained from
the fuel pipe temperatures to and from the reactor
at the time the reactor inlet and outlet core tube
temperatures (as shown in Fig. 1.3) recorded a
AT of only 250°F. While there are several
possible phenomena which could contribute to

‘these low core tube temperatures (external cooling,

surface layers, radiation, etc.}, there were 10 to
15 thermocouples on the inlet and outlet pipes
which gave consistent readings. The outlet pipe
temperature was at an equilibrium of 1580°F and
was in excess of 1600°F during transients.

The last scheduled experiment to be conducted
on the reactor was a measurement of the xenon
buildup during a 25-hr run at high power. The
amount of xenon buildup was observed by the
amount of regulating rod which had to be with-
drawn in order to maintain a constant power level.
However, during the 25-hr power run the regulating
rod had been withdrawn only 0.3 in.,, or one-
thirtieth the amount calculated on the assumption
that the xenon would remain in the fuel.

The scheduled tests were completed by 8:00 AM,
November 12. The reactor operation was then
demonstrated for all those who attended the ANP
Information Meeting on Friday, November 12.
During the 12-hr period of 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM,

the reactor power was cycled 21 times. The

resulting temperature cycling was probably as

severe as that to which an aircraft reactor would
be subjected. At 8:00 PM, November 12, with
the scheduled experimental program completed and
over 100- Mwhr of operation logged, the reactor
was made subcritical, but circulation of the fuel

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

to explain this, the ORACLE three-group, three-
region code was modified so that flux shapes at
successive fuel additions could be calculated.
Group constants were obtained by flux weighting
with fluxes from an Eyewash calculation on the

ARE.

Figure 1.4 shows the space distribution of the
thermal flux for no fuel and for runs 2 through 6.
The effect of the reflector as fission neutrons
become more numerous can be seen. Figure 1.5
compares experimental and calculated startup
curves for the fission chambers which were
located in the reflector as indicated in Fig. 1.4.

where m is the multiplication constant, CR. is
the counting rate on run j, and CR is the counting
rate with no fuel. |t seems, then, that the unex-
pected, rapid initial rise in the counting rate of
the fission chamber and the {1 ~ (1/m)] curve is
due not only to the general rise in flux level but
also to the formation of the thermal-flux maximum
near the fission chambers. Once the shape of
spatial distribution of the thermal neutron flux
is set up, the fission chambers register only the
general increase in flux level and the count rate
increases slowly.

cation of the *‘short burner’’ (high current source

several times during early stages of hot operation.

Each time, the short was cleared instantaneously

effect of radiation damage upon the belts may be

determined upon inspection.

The power traces indicated good operation of

the pumps undér load. The voltage regulcmon

of the pump motor supply (an’a-c~d-c motor gener-:
ator set) became somewhat unsteady with passage’

of time. This unsteadiness of voltage regulchon
could be seen in pump speed and motor current
indications.

The pump tachometer generators performed well
after some initial troubles were corrected. The
tachometer generator on the main fuel and main
sodium pumps failed during the prenuclear hot
operation. These failures, it is believed, can
be traced to improper fit-up of the generator shaft

'Ioadmg of the ARE were completed during the
month of October.. Transfer of the barren carrier

(NaF ZrF 50-50 mole %) into the ARE fill tank

. No. 2 was completed in approximately 43 hr

w:fhouf mmdeni’ Approximately 2750 Ib of carrier
| looded into the fill tank, and sufficient
: maferta[ was on hand to fill the fuel system to
its operating liquid level.

The enriched fuel storage tank had previously
been loaded with 60 Ib of carrier material for
practice injections into the reactor. Tests indi-
cated that the semiautomatic enrichment system
was inadequately heated, and therefore equipment
for addition of portions of the fuel concentrate
(Na,UF,) directly to the circulating fuel pump
was designed and assembled.

In order to provide adequate means for ap-
proaching criticality safely, some of the original
30-1b batches of concentrate were reduced to
10-Ib batches, and, similarly, to provide accurate
measurements for calibration of the control rods
after criticality, 12 small batches of approximately
0.5-1b size were prepared from a 30-1b batch.

The injection system consisted of a main con-
centrate’ can (containing 30, 10, or 0.5 lb as
required) connected to an intermediate transfer
can by a resistance-heated 1/4-in. Inconel tube.
The intermediate transfer can was designed so
that it could be filled to a predetermined level
(approximately 5.5 b) when the 10- or 30-Ib
batches were in position to be transferred. The
0.5-1b batches were transferred through a smaller
mfermed:ate can, which contained the entire small
batch each time of transfer. The intermediate can
was, in f't._ayrn','connec’red to the fuel pump. The
main transfer line to the pump was heated by
“calrod units, WHi_le the nozzle within the pump

s

was heated by resistance heating. The close
tolerances of the injection nozzle resulted in an
inherent tendency to short out and cause the
nozzle tip to be cold. " This, coupled with the
drainage of high-melting-point material from the
fong transfer line, always presented the possi-
bility of a frozen-fluoride plug.

The first 30 b of concentrate was mlected into
the fuel pump without apparent difficulty. After
this injection, however, difficulties in the form

~of line plugs and venting troubles frequently
occurred.

After 48 hr, most of these problems
were under control, and loading of the enriched
concentrate proceeded smoothly. The reactor was
brought to criticality, and small injections of
0.5-1b batches were made for the control rod

“calibrations. At the completion of the final small

addition, the transfer line broke and simultane-
ously plugged ot the injection nozzle. Efforts to
repair the damage were fruitless, and the final
injection of 30 Ib of the concentrate to allow ARE
operation at power was made through the sample
line into the pump.

ANALYSIS OF LEAK IN SODIUM SYSTEM

E. E. Hoffman W. H, Cock

The sodium system of the ARE was filled
initially on September 26, 1954, but the sodium
had to be dumped on September 27 because of a
leak at a tube bend in the sodium purification
system. The section of austenitic stainless steel
pipe in which the leak occurred was located just
ahead of the filter traps. The system had been
filled with sodium for 37 hr and had reached a
maximum temperature of approximately 1150°F
before the leak was detected. A portion of the
section removed and the location of the leak are
shown in Fig. 1.6. The leak occurred where a
metal thermocouple protection tube had been at-
tached to the stainless steel pipe by Heliare
welding. The attack around the weld was due to
the formation of sodium oxide as the sodium
leaked through the weld. The inside of the pipe
at the weld may be seen in Fig. 1.7. An ex-
cessive amount of penetration was obtained during
the welding operation. The large weld nugget
cracked during cooling after welding. A cross
section of the weld crack is shown in Fig. 1.8.

Samples were withdrawn by pressurizing the pump

Inconel tube into a sampling device, which was
constructed to allow line flushing before col-
lection of the sample.

Analyses of the samples were carried out by

the ANP Analytical Chemistry Group end are
shown in Table 1.1. As may be seen, the
chromium content of the fuel was essentially
constant at 100 ppm after 155 hr of circulation
of the fuel carrier through the reactor. If corrosion
of the Inconel is assumed to have been uniform
over the surface of the system — and since it was
operating isothermally during this period, such
an assumption is reasonable — the chremium con-
centration of 100 ppm would represent about 0.5

mil of attack on the Inconel.

As was anticipated, the chromium content of
the melt was found to increase a few hours after
each addition of fuel concentrate (Na,UF ;). By
the time the fing! sample was taken, after 307 hr
of molten fluoride circulation, the chromium con-
tent was found to be 445 ppm. Again, if a uniform
rate of attack of the Inconel is assumed and if
the removal of circulated material from the system
during this time (to maintain desired pump liquid
level) is taken into account, this chromium content
would represent about 5 mils of attack on the
Inconel system. I|f the data in Table 1.1 are
plotted as chromium confent vs time, it is seen
that the chromium content had begun to level off
by the time the final sample was taken. A pro-
jection of the slope of the chromium _cur-ve- indi-
cates a maximum chromium concentration of about
600 ppm after several hundred hours of operation.

There is no doubt that mass transfer of chromium
metal began soon after power operation started,
since there were then large temperature differ-
entials across portions of the system. Sampling
wa_s'not possible at this time and could not, of
course, have given information on mass transfer.
Heat transfer characteristics of the ARE did not
appear to have changed during its 150 Mwhr of
operation, and so whatever mass transfer occurred
was unimportant. Details of mass transfer will
be studied when sectioning of the equipment
becomes possible.

is stable for all attitudes (in flight); (3) a centri-
fuge cup integrally mounted on the back of each
fuel pump impeller for degassing the processed
fuel, pumping the processed fuel back into the
main system, and providing a seal for the fuel
pump.

Several Lucite models that differ in component
design and circuit arrangement have been built and
tested, and they have led to the design illustrated
in Fig. 2.1. In this model the swirl chamber is
mounted between the two fuel pumps and raised
above the centrifuge cups to assure their priming
under starting conditions.  The swirl in the
chamber is produced in two ways: by nozzleslo-
cated in the swirl chamber floor and by swirl
pumps which are needed to maintain a high swirl
velocity when the fuel level rises above the 25%
full condition owing to thermal expansion in the
main system. The nozzles and swirl pumps are
arranged to deliver high-velocity fuel jets tangenti-
ally at the periphery of the swirl chamber to give
good agitation and to assure a strong centrifugal
field and a stable free surface.

The nozzles serve both to meter the bleed flow
through the expansion tank and to control the fuel
pump suction pressure relative to the swirl chamber
gas pressure. This important function is perhaps
more evident in the schematic circuit analog pre-
sented in Fig. 2.2. By tracing the bleed flow, it
can be seen that the pressure drop across the

_ nozzles approximates the heat exchanger resis-
. tance.

Consequently, the fuel pump suction pres-
sure is maintained near the helium pressure
exisfing in the swirl chamber.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The addlhon of 'rhe swirl pump made it neces-
sary, however, to replace the sllnger ring, previ-
ously employed, with a slinger impeller in order
to buck any leakage from the swirl pump. Although
the complete assembly has not yet been tested in

~an inverted position, the slinger impeller seems to

be very effective. A similar arrangement is now

‘being tried as a means of controlling the leakage

from the main pump discharge through the clearance

_ between 'rhe impeller and the casing past the

cem‘rlfuge. More conventional sealing arrange-
ments were found to be ineffective because of the
abhb'rmoily 'ldrge‘ radial clearances (0.060 in.)
specified in the design objectives. Initial tests
currently in progress with the centrifuge seal
impeller have been quite promlsmg Although no
detailed studies of the off-gas system and fuel
pill addition sysfem have been made, the changes
in fhe xenon—removal system will make it neces-
sary that the off-gas system connection and the
fuel pill addition be made through the swirl
chamber rather than through the pump housing as
illustrated previously.>

CONTROL ROD DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

The design of the ART has been predicated on
the belief that no fast-moving control rods will be
required because of the inherent stability of the
reactor that will arise from the strong negative
temperature coefficient of the circulating fuel.
It is further expected that only about 1% Ak/k
will be required to compensate for xenon poisoning,
since it is anticipated that with the bypass ex-
pansion tank and gas-scrubbing system planned,

the xenon will be removed almost as rapidly as it

is formed. |t is expected that compensation for
burnup and the accumulation of fission-product
poisons can be effected by adding pills of solid
fuel having a high percentage of U235, Thus the
principal function of the control rod will be to
control the mean temperature level of the reactor
fuel.  Since the temperature coefficient will
probably be approximately 5 x 10=3 Ak/k per °C
and since a temperature level variation of the
order of 150°C will probably be required, provision
of a Ak/k of 1% in the control rod for temperature

level control should be more "rh‘an adequate. ln

reviewing the various requirements for control,
thus follows that a control rod having a total k e ff
of 2% should prove to'be adequate. This reactivity

24

canbe readily incorporated in a single slow-moving
control rod. [t would seem entirely adequate to
move this control rod at a rate of 1% Ak/k per
minute, a slow and conservative value.

The size and stroke of the rod are important
considerations, Two items of experimental data
are availoble fo indicate the size of the rod re-
quired. In the course of the second reflector-
moderated reactor critical experiment (that making
use of powdered fuel placed inside 1%-in.-square
aluminum tubes), it was found that with an 18-in.-
dia core and a 9%-in.-dia island a control rod
effectiveness of about 0.6% Ak/k was obtained
from a 346-|n.-0D stainless steel tube filled with
powdered boron to a density of about 50% and
inserted in one-half of the critical experiment
assembly. A second indication of the effective-
ness of control rod material is available in that a
piece of gadolinium oxide approximately the
diameter and thickness of a 25-cent piece was in-
serted at the center of the island in the three-
region octahedron critical assembly (without core
shells). The value of this gadolinium oxide wafer
was found to be approximately 0.2% Ak/k. Some
additional data are also available from multigroup
calculations. All these data seem to indicate that
a rod approximately 3’/8 to 1/2 in. in diameter having
a stroke of approximately 20 in., about 71/2 in, of
which would be below the equator, should prove
adequate to give a Ak/k of 2%.

The heat generation to be expected in the con-
trol rod will establish the amount of cooling that
will be required and, to a large degree, much of
the detail design of the rod. The heat generation,
in turn, is dependent, in part, on the number of
neutrons absorbed in the rod at full power. Molti-
group calculations indicate that 1.3% of the
neutrons produced will be absorbed in a control
rod having a Ak/k of 1%, if it is assumed that the
average effectiveness of the control rod is half
that of the portion at the center of the island.
Thus a control rod having an effectiveness of 2%
Ak/k would, when in the ““full in’’ position, absorb
2.6% of the neutrons. [f a value of 3 Mev per
neutron absorbed is assumed, the energy associated
with neutron absorption in the control rod would
amount t0 0.039% of the total power generated in the
reactor. This would total 24 kw for a 60-Mw power
level. The control rod cooling requirement would
be a minimum if gadolinium rather than boron were

used as the absorbing material in the rod. This

would mean that most of the energy associated
with the hard capture gammas emitted from the
gadolinium would appear as heat in the surrounding
moderafi-ng material rather than in the gadolinium.
Thus a gadolinium rod would have the advantage
'rhcn‘ relatively little of the heat associated with
neutron captures in the rod would appear in the

red, and therefore little provision for cooling

would be required. On the other hand, if boron
were used, the very short range ofpho emitted
from neutron captures in boron would cause
virtually all the energy associated with the
neutron capture to appear in the boron.

‘The principal heating in a gadolinium rod would
be that induced by gammas from the fuel region.
For a 60-Mw reactor it appears that the power

The total power generation in the rod
from gammas from the fuel region would amount to

power ‘generation in a boron rod. It should be
noted that gadolinium oxide is available at a cost

of about $4000/1b and that it can be fabricated

readily by using conventional ceramic techniques.

Cooling of the rod presents quite a number of
problems. If the rod were immersed in flowing
sodium, cooling would present no problem. How-
ever, the control rod octuotmg mechanlsm would
have to operate, to some degree at least, in
sodium, and self-welding might present some
difficult problems. If the rod were placed in a

mechanism could include a heat exchanger so that
the heat would be removed from the circulating
helium and transmitted to the shield water, Un-
fortunately, such a system would be dependent on
the satisfactory operation of quite a number of
moving parts, always a likely source of trouble.

FILL AND DRAIN SYSTEM

A good, reliable, relatively simple fill-and-drain
system incorporating a quick disconnect coupling
suitable for remote operation with high-temperature
liquid systems is clearly needed. In the design of
the ARE, fixed tanks withremotely operated valves
were used in order to avoid a remotely aperated
coupling. This approach led to a quite complicated
collection of tanks, plumbing, and valves, and to
somewhat clumsy arrangements for system drainage.

The requirements of such a system are fairly
straightforward. In the first place, a good coupling
that can be operated remotely and that will be
dependably pressure-tight is required.  This
coupling must be relatively insensitive to align-
ment both as to concentricity and to parallelism
of the axes of the mating flanges or surfaces. A
reliable pressure-tight valve on either side of the
coupling must be provided so that, after the
coupling has been made, the space between the
valves can be evacuated and then purged with
helium. The valves on either side of the coupling
can then be opened and the filling or draining
operation carried out. Upon completion of the
operation, the upper valve can be closed and the
space between the valves cleared of liquid by
sevérol short blasts of helium. The lower valve
can then be closed and the coupling broken.

reactor fuel systems because it is essential that
the exact amount of fuel in the reactor be known

- at all times. One good way of measuring the

quantity bf liquid in the tank would be to support

the tank on two Hagan Thrustorq units. This

should give an instantaneous measure of the weight
of the tank to an accuracy of 1% of full-scale
reading.

Design work is under way on a system to fill the
above-specified requirements. Complete tests of
mockups of proposed designs will be made before
the final design is chosen.

DESIGN PHYSICS
W. K. Ergen

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

' The comparison between multigroup calculations
and critical ‘experiments on three-region reflector-
moderated reactors has shown a certain amount of
discrepancy, which must be overcome by adjusting
the constants used in the caleulations. Investi-
gations were made with the ultimate aim of ob-
taining simpler expressions for the critical mass
and power distribution for reflector-moderated
reactors. This was done in the hope that these
simpler expressions could be fitted to the experi-
ments by adjusting of constants and that this
fitting might be as satisfactory as the one employed
for the multigroup calculations. The three-group
ORACLE calculations of the approach to criti-
cality of the ARE (see Sec. 1) gave a satisfactory
explanation of the strange results observed during
the experiment. An example of the calculations
performed for the ART is the following calculation
of the activation of the Inconel core shells.

Activation of the Inconel Core Shells

"H. W. Bertini

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

An attempt was made to estimate the activity of
the Inconel core shells on the inside of a 60-Mw
reflector-moderated reactor after the reactor had
been operating for 1000 hr. The activity will
come from two main sources: the activity of the
cobalt in the Inconel and the activity of the fission

26

fragments that strike the Inconel and remain there.

The method described below for obtaining the
estimate gives an order of magnitude of the total
activity. Reasonable approximations are used to
simplify the calculations, and, in this way, many
of the details that a more complete analysis would
require are circumvented, and yet the required
accuracy of the calculations is maintained.

To obtain the activity due to the cobalt, the
total flux at the surface of the Inconel is obtained,
This flux is multiplied by the product of the
microscopic cross section of cobalt times the total
number of cobalt atoms in the core shells. This
gives the total number of cobalt atoms being
activated per second.  Multiplication of this
number by 1000 hr gives the total number of cobalt
atoms activated during the reactor lifetime. Since
the half life of cobalt is so long (5 years) com-
pared with the reactor lifetime, the decay of the
excited cobalt atoms can be assumed to be con-
stant, and therefore the disintegration rate can be
taken as AN, where A is the decay constant of
cobalt, and N is the total number of cobalt atoms
activated during the lifetime of the reactor.

The following values were used for the calcula-
tions:

Reactor power = 6 X 107 w

Total mass of U235 in the core = 2.5 x 104 g
Density of Inconel =8 g/cm3

Weight per cent of cobalt in the Inconel = 0.1%
Half life of cobalt =5 years

The total mass of Inconel in the core shells of
the reactor is approximated by the mass of two
spherical Inconel shells, one with a 15-cm radius
and the other with a 25-cm radius, each shell
being 0.3 em thick. Then,

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

In calculating the activity of the fission frag-
ments, use is made of Fig. 2 in ORNL-53,% which
is a curve of the dose from a uranium slug exposed
~ for three years plotted against time after exposure.
The dose is given in mr/hr at 1 meter per watt of
exposure, ‘

Calculations now show that 1 curie of 2-Mev
gammas gives a dose of approximately 1 r/hr at
1 meter. |f it is assumed that the average energy
of the decay gammas from the fission fragments
is 2 Mev (an overestimate), the curve can be used
to obtain an estimate of the curies of activity for
anv time after exposure. However, it is first
necessary to calculate the watts of exposure in
the regions of the reactor close enough to the
Inconel core shells so that the fragments due to
fissions will strike the Inconel. This is done by
finding the range, R, of the fission fragments in
_ the fuel and again approximating the fuel annulus
by a spherical shell of 25 ecm OD and 15 em ID
“to find the total power generated in the regions
adjacent to the Inconel. This power is divided
by 2 to account for the fact that approximately
one-haif the fission fragments generated in this
region will impinge on the shells. Since the curve
was plotted for a slug exposed for three years,
any valves obtained by using this curve will be
overestimates of the fission fragment activity of
a 60-Mw reflector-moderated reactor.

The range of fission fragments is estimated to

be 0.001 ¢m, and the
1

watts of exposure = 6 x 107 w x —

47 (252 + 152) x 10-3

The last factor of 2 in the above equation is due
to the flux at the surface of the Inconel being
twice that of the average flux. Some values of
the total activation of the Inconel core shells
obtained by using the above methods are given in
Table 2.1. One conclusion to be drawn from
Table 2.1 is that little would be gained by trying
to obtain special Inconel with especially low
cobalt content; the activity could not be reduced
below that caused by the fission fragments,

The thermal absorption rate has been calculated
for an idealized reactor consisting of a nonmoder-
ating spherical-shell fuel region surrounding a
moderator and surrounded by an infinite moderating
reflector with a fission source of 1 neutron/sec
in the fuel region, The thermal capture cross
section of the fuel region was taken to be infinite,

PROPOSED ART INSTALLATIONS
A, P, Fraas F. R. McQuilkin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A study has been made of the various types of
facilities suitable for the operation of the Aircraft
Reactor Test. In addition to the obvious require-

ments for shielding, heat dumps, and auxiliary

equipment, it is essential from the hazards stand-
point that provision be made to contain the
products resulting from a nuclear accident and/or
chemical reaction of all combustibles in the
installation, minimize the likelihood of serious
damage from an explosion caused by sabotage or
bombing, and remove and dispose of volatile
fission products evolved during the course of
operation. With these criteria in mind, a series
of four basic reactor installations was considered;
each differed in some fundamental characteristics
from the others, The four installations are as
follows: (1) an open test unit mounted over a
water-cooled pan at the National Reactor Testing
Station (NRTS), (2) a circular Quonset type of
hemispherical building, (3) a water-walled tank,
and (4) a reactor submerged in a pool of water.

rl‘Each of ’rhe msfalichons mcluded f;ve malor
w"{:m'[oonen'rs “"a shielded reactor assembly, radi-
ators, blowers, a control system, and a fill-and-
drain system. These components would operate

as an integroted system, irrespective of the type
of test installation chosen. In all but the fourth
installation, the assembled reactor would be sur-
rounded by an aircraft type of shield of lead and
borated water, and, in all installations, it would
be coupled to heat dumps consisting of banks of
aircraft-type NaK-to-air radiators through which
cooling air would be circulated. Appropriate con-

_frol systems, along with auxiliary shielding, equip-
-ment, and services, would comprise the balance of
- the test installation. A generalized flow sheet for

th:s setup was shown in Fig. 2.1 of the previous

" quarterly progress report.”

All but the first of the above-listed installations
‘would be located in Oak Ridge. The first installa-
tion is illustrated in Fig. 2.4. It was devised to
permit operation of the reactor surrounded by an

© aircraft-type shield with a heat dump on either side
" fo simulate the turbojet engines. Of the installa-

tions considered, it offers the most compact

“arrangement of the equipment with the least amount

of shielding and minimum provision for contain-
ment, This scheme was developed with the thought
that it could be built in Oak Ridge so that all the
welding of high-temperature-liquid piping could be
made, inspected, and pressure tested and some
preliminary testing carried out, probably including
a hot critical experiment, before the unit was
shipped to NRTS, The dimensions of the unit are
such that it would fit on a flat car and comply
with standard railroad side and overhead clearance
regulations. To do this, it would be necessary to
dismount certain elements, such as the pump drive
motors, the blowers, and the blower drive motors.
This could be done easily, since only bolted con-
nections would be involved, The reactor would be

~ set up with a heavy, water-cooled pan beneath it,
- This pan would catch, hoid, and cool the fuel in
‘the event of an accident, A control room would be

built as a unit and shipped to NRTS on a second

“flat car. The contrél room and the reactor would
“probobly be placed a quarter of a mile to a mile

apart, and the two would be coupled by telemetering

. _equipment, The pumps in the layout are shown as

- -being driven by d-c electric motors, but air turbine
 ‘motors would serve equally well if a source of

, " compressed air were available. If the tests were
. _run at NRTS and Air Force, portable, gas-turbine-
S ﬁpé"dir 'com'pressors were used, a compressed air

source might be more easily arranged than a d-c
generator set. ‘ ‘

In examining the NRTS installation design, a
number of points became evident, First, the prob-
lems associated with operating a reactor at NRTS
seem to be rather serious, particularly from the
standpoint of the amount of time that would be
lost in maintaining an operation 2000 miles from
Oak Ridge. The distance would make it particu-
larly difficult to cope with unforseen problems.
Any relatively small difficulty that might arise
would be likely to introduce a major delay if that
difficulty were not forseen. It appears therefore
that an NRTS installation would entail a loss of at
least six months in getting the reactor into opera-
tion, The second major point that developed in
connection with the examination of the design was
that the major hazards appeared to be much less
serious than had originally been presumed. The
very compact installation achieved through careful
design directed toward simulation of a full-scale
aircraft type of power plant led to a very low in-
vestment of sodium and NaK, about one-twentieth
of that required for the KAPL-SIR reactor designed
for the same power level, Further, the use of
circulating fuel with its high negative temperature
coefficient gives a reactor in which a nuclear
explosion seems almost out of the question,

In view of the relatively small amounts of energy
released under conditions of a total reactor tragedy,
designs were prepared for the installation of the
ART in a closed building. The layout shown in
Fig. 2.5 envisions a sort of circular Quonset
building about 200 ft in diameter. The test unit
would be built and operated on the test floor
behind supplementary shielding, and a heavy,
water-cooled pan would be placed beneath the
reactor, This pan would catch, hold, and cool the
fuel in the event of an accident. Such an arrange-
ment would give plenty of floor area in a relatively
inexpensive building that could be sealed to con-
tain any fission products that might be released,
in line with the philosophy underlying the use of
the Hortonsphere at KAPL., A similar type of
building, but shaped as a hemisphere rather than
as the circular Quonset building, might be used
in order to reduce the amount of steel required in
the framing of the building.

The arrangement shown in Fig. 2.6 follows a
quite different philosophy. It provides for con-
taining the reactor assembly within a pressure

tank wou.ld be shielded fairly well, and it would

be possible for aman to enter the inner tank through '

a manhole at the top for inspection or repair work,
even after the tank had been closed and the ve-

“actor had been run at high power. The water

capacity of the spcice between the tanks, together
~with the water in the reservoir above the inner
tank (apprommotely 10 ft deep), would be of the
order of 110,000 gal, Boiling of this water would
suffice to carry off all the heat generated by the
fission products for about two days without any
fresh water being supphed to the outer tank. All
the vcrlous wires, plpes, tubes, etc, connected to
the reactor and its auxiliaries would pass through
carefully laid-out junction panels such as the one
shown in Fig, 2.7. Such a panel might be installed
in the wall of the tank shown in Fig, 2.6 with a
pressure-hght gaske’red flanged ;uncnon. The
various thermocouples, power wiring, etc. could be
installed on the reactor assembly in the shop and
fitted with Cannon plugs so that they could be
plugged into the panel in a short period of time
after the reactor assembly had been lowered into
position in the test facility. This should minimize
the amount of assembly work required in the field.

The layout investigated as the fourth proposed
installation would involve placing the reactor in-
side o sort of swimming pool with water-tight
thermal insulation surrounding the pressure shell,
lines, and pumps. The lines could then be brought
out the top of the water tank to the instruments
and the heat dumps, In the event of a severe
accident that resulted in a meltdown, there would
be sufficient heat capacity in the water to absorb
the heat from the fission products for some days
before a seriously large amount of water would
have been boiled out of the pool. Such an arrange-
ment could be enclosed, of course, in an air-tight
building.  This might not be necessary, but it
seems likely that, in the event of an abrupt melt-
down type of failure, the high heat capacity of the
region inside the thermal insulation might put so
~much heat into the water in a very short period of

“time that bubbles would boil violently to the
".surface and disperse entrained fission products,

g 'Aftéf,v‘- perhaps, 10 or 15 min, it seems unlikely

that such entrainment would prove to be a problem,

The unshielded reactor assembly will weigh
“approximately 10,000 Ib, the lead gamma shield
approximately 30,000 Ib, and the water in the
~shield approximately 34,000 1b, The first two of

34

these. ttems could be handled: convemenﬂy with a

20-ton crane, while the borated water could be
~pumped in after the rubber fonks hud been mstaHed

for the water shield.’ :

An armngement such as the double-walled tank
shown in Fig. 2.6 should prove to be cdequate fo
take care of any accident not involving sqbofcge
or bombing. The same should be true for either
the hemispherical or circular Quonset 'rype of
building. Only the NRTS installation would, be-
cause of the remote location, present a not- too-
serious hazards problem if effectively sabotaged.

To evaluate the merits of each of the installa-
tions considered, an attempt was made to envision
as many accidents as possible that might prove to
be serious during the course of operation of the
ART. The worst natural accident that could be
envisioned would result in a meltdown, The only
source of an explosion that has been envisioned
would be either sabotage or bombing. If the
volatile fission products are removed during the
course of operation, the major hazard to the sur-
rounding area would be from the fission products
that might be dispersed in the course of violent
boiling or from an explosion.

Although in the preliminary hazards analysis
consideration was given to operational hazards,
operational sabotage, fire, earthquake, flood,
windstorm, and bombing, the controlling considera-
tions appeared,to be those associated with a total
reactor tragedy. The total reactor tragedy is con-
sidered here as being an accident in which all the
heat that could possibly be released from the
chemical combination of various materials in the
reactor and associated system would be released,
together with the heat from the fission products
accumulated after extended operation at full power
and the energy released in an extreme nuclear
runaway. 1he principal hazard associated with an
ultimate reactor catastrophe is the dispersion of
the fission products that would have accumulated
from extended operation at high power. The key
data on these parameters are presented in Table
2.2,

In examining the data on the heat that could be
released from the combustion of various materials
in the reactor installation, it is immediately evi-
dent that if kerosene or another hydrocarbon were

used in place of water in the shield a very large

amount of heat could be released, an amount almost
one hundred times greater than that from any other

still not present a difficult problem, The heat
that would be released from a nuclear accident
depends in large measure on the character of the
accident. However, the value presented in Table
2.2 is that for the worst accident that can be

36

envisioned, that is, one in which uranium abruptly

begins to precipitate out of the fuel in the core so
that the fuel is carried into the core at the normal
rate but no uranium leaves with the exit stream of
fluoride. While hardly a credible accident, this
does seem to represent the maximum rate of in-
crease in reactivity and, hence, the extreme nuclear
accident conceivable for this reactor.

The second portion of Table 2.2 presents the
equivalent radiation sources for the various fluid
circuits. The values given for the sodium and NaK
activities have been obtained from multigroup
calculations.

It should be noted that the presence of the shield
water would provide a strong damping effect on any
temperature rise associated with an accident, The
third part of Table 2.2 shows the temperature rise
associated with the release of energy from the
various sources for various conditions. As shown
in the table, if all the heat from the combustion
reactions were to be confined in the combustion
products, high temperatures would result from
stoichiometric reactions, Even in such instances,
much of the heat would be dissipated to the atmos-
phere within the containing vessel so that the
temperature would be substantially lowered, If
the reaction were quenched by the shield water,
still lower temperatures would result.

It is clearly essential that provision be made to
contain the products of a total reactor tragedy
except, possibly, if the reactor is installed at
NRTS. A comparison of key data for several types
of container is given in Table 2,3, For this com-
parison the worst set of conditions applicable to
each case was presumed. As may be seen, the
double-walled tank compares favorably with the
hemispherical and ellipsoidal buildings. While
difficult to evaluate numerically, the double-walled
tank also appears superior in that it would be less
subject to sabotage. Even if both walls were
ruptured and the reactor melted down, the residue
would tend to sink to the bottom of the tank pit,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

where it would be flooded by the water that had

filled the region between the walls. This water
would both absorb the heat of any reaction and act
as a shield to reduce the radiation level at the top
of the pit. After careful review of these and a host
of lesser considerations, the 24-ft-dia double-walled
tank was chosen as the most promising test facility.

Although the double-walled tank type of test
installation is adaptable to several types of reactor
test facility, the most promising possibility is to
install it in an addition to the ARE Building. Such
an arrangement would permit the use of services
and facilities that already exist in the ARE Build-
ing, for which no plans have been formulated now
that it has served its original purpose. For ex-
ample, items such as the control room, offices,
change rooms, toilets, storage area, water supply,
power supply, portions of experimental test pits,
access roads, security fencing, and security lighting
are available.

Of the several schemes considered for modifying

the ARE Building to accommodate the ART, the

‘most attractive plan is to construct an addition on

the south end to effect a 64-ft extension of the
present 105-ft-long building by extending the ex-
isting roof and side walls. Figure 2.8 shows a
preliminary design. The floor level of the addition
would be at the ARE basement floor grade, with
the double-walled tank to house the ART sunk in

the floor up to 3 ft below the bolting flange level.
The reactor tank location would be approximately
centered in the 42-ff-wrde, 64-ft-long high-bay ex-
tension directly in line with the ARE experimental
bay. The reactor would be positioned so that the
top of the shield would be at the building floor
elevation,

. To permit use of the experimental pits for instal-

lation of auxiliary equipment, to permit possible
underwater reactor disassembly work after reactor

operation, and to provide a large entry door to the
ART areaq, the south wall of the ARE experimental
bay would be removed, the overhead crane facility
would be revised from 10- to 20-ton capacity, and
the truck door in the nor'rh wall of the ARE Building
would be enlorged.

The double-walled tank described above is
essenhclly the container conSIdered for this instal-
lation. The inner tank, or pressure vessel, would
be approximately 24 ft in diameter with a straight
section about 11 ft long and a hemispherical bottom
and top. The joint between the removable top and
the lower portion of the tank would probably be «
bolting flange, with provision for sealing the joint
with a low-melting-point alloy, Thus the top would
be used only as required by the operating program.
The outer tank would be a right circular cylinder
approximately 27 ft in diameter and about 47]/2 ft
high. About 26 ft of this water-containing tank
would be above floor grade, and this portion of the
tank would be oﬂ'ached by a flange or weld joint
only when the operating program requrred that the
upper hemisphere of the inner tank be in place.
The inner tank would be set coaxially with the

outer tank, and the bottom of the inner tank would <

“ere Pr fype shleld ‘with @ gross W ghr “of about 35
tons, would be mounted on verr:cal col‘umns ‘with
"the reactor center 3 ft off center fromﬂt e vessel
axis and about 12 ft above an open- groted floor.
This positioning would provide needed space for

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

movement of the portable fluoride fuel and sodium
moderator coolant containers to their operating
stations under the reactor. The off-center [ocation
would also serve to minimize the length of NaK
piping that must run from the reactor through a
bulkhead in the pressure vessel to the heat dump
radiators outside the tank.

Quite a variety of shields has been considered
for the ART. The most convenient seems to be
one functionally the same as that for an aircraft
requiring a unit shield, namely, a shield designed
to give 1 r/hr at 50 ft from the center of the reactor.
Such a shield is both the lightest and most com-
pact that has been devised. It makes use of non-
critical materials that are in good supply, and it
will provide useful performance data on the effects
of the release of delayed neutrons and decay
gammas in the heat exchanger, the generation of
secondary gammas throughout the shield, etc.
While the complication of detailed instrumentation
within the shield does not appear to be warranted,
it will be extremely worthwhile to obtain radiation
dose level data at various points around the pe-
riphery of the shield, particularly in the vicinity
of the ducts and the pump and expansion tank
region.

Several arrangements have been considered as a
means for disposing of the heat generated in the
reactor. The most promising is one that resembles
a turbojet power plant in many respects. It em-
ploys radiators essentially similar to those suit-
able forturbojet operation. Conventional axial-flow
blowers would be employed to force cooling air
through the radiators. This arrangement is flexible
and as inexpensive as any arrangement devised.

would be placed on a diagonal across the south-

“west corner of the addition. Each radiator core

would have an inlet face 24 by 24 in. and a depth

- of 6 in, These radiators would be located at floor

grade over the NaK pipe lines and the NaK fill and
drain pit. Four 75,000-cfm axial-flow blowers de-
signed to give a head of 10 in, H,O would force
air through the radiators and out through a discharge
stack.

The fuel fill-and-drain system envisioned for the
ART incorporates two shielded dump tanks. One

would be coupled to the reactor with a remotely
- operated coupling, while a second emergency dump
“tank would be welded directly to a discharge pipe
~from the reactor. The remotely operated coupling

to the first fuel dump tank would give flexibility*in

' the operation of the reactor, since it would make it

possible to bring fuel to or remove it from the site

. expeditiously and would keep the footage of pipe
~and the number of valves to a minimum.

For- handling the heavy, shielded fluoride and

sodium containers inside the inner tank, a track

would be installed on the floor and inside the wall.
Wheels would be mounted on both the bottom and
one end of the tank dolly so that the assembly
could be lowered by the overhead crane to the floor
track, with the end wheels on the dolly riding
against the vertical track. Once on the floor track,
each dolly would be moved to its operating station
under the reactor. Each track pair in this area
would probably be mounted on a {ift for raising the
tank connection nozzle to the contact position
within the reactor shield.

In addition to the NaK piping bulkhead mentioned
above, a control junction panel such as that shown
in Fig. 2.7 would be installed as a part of another
bulkhead through the tank below the building floor
grade to pass the tubing and the electrical con-
ductors required for operation, control, and moni-
toring. Two more bulkheads, in the form of man-
holes, would probably be installed in the upper
portions of the inner and outer tanks. One manhole
would be about 3 by 5 ft and located just above the
inner tank flange to allow passage through both

container walls and thus provide entrance to the

- 40

inner tank subsequent to placement of these sections
of equipment. The second opening would be a
manhole about 5 ft in diameter in the hemispherical
top of the inner tank to provide overhead crane
service after placement of the top. Sufficient cat-
walks, ladders, and hoisting equipment would be
installed within the inner tank to provide easy
access for servicing all equipment, as shown in
Fig. 2.6. A -

The control bulkhead in the doubl_é-wdl[ed'tank
would be located so that the associated control
junction panel and the conirol tunnel would be on
the control room side of the tank. The tunnel
would extend to the auxiliary equipment pit (formerly
the ARE slab storage pit), where it would t_erminofé.
The tubes and conductors from the junction panel

‘'would be channeled from the tunnel either to equip-

ment in the pit and basement or to thé control
room (formerly the ARE control room). The pit and
basement equipment would include such items as
the lubricating oil pumps and cooler, borated shield
water pumps, cooler and makeup equipment, vacuum
pumps, relays, switch gear, and emergency power
supply.

The reactor off-gas flow would probably be piped
through the NaK piping bulkhead to a disposal
facility outside the building., Such a system would
probably consist of an activated-charcoal absorption
bed contained within a pipe which would be long
enough to provide the required delay period to
bring the activity of the krypton (which would not
be adsorbed by the charcoal) to a tolerable level.

Field maintenance and laboratory facilities
would be installed in the area east of the ART test
bay and south of the low bay of the ARE. This
area and the ARE experimental bay would be
partitioned from the ART test bay with about a

16-in.-thick shield wall of stacked solid concrete

block, This wall would not be erected until after
placement of the upper sections of the double-
walled tank, The only other major rework of the
ARE facility to accommodate the ART would
probably be that of modifying and equipping one
of the ARE experimental pits for underwater dis-
assembly work on the reactor after operation.

-Design work is under wcxy on an in- pt|e test
[oop for operation in a horizontal beam hole of
the MTR. This work is being done in cooperation
with the Solid State Division and Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft. The specifications for the loop have
been established. Tests are under way on a
horlzonfal shaft sump pump for the loop, and a
salt-to-air heat exchanger has been fabricated.

‘The use of ARE-type sump pumps for high-flow
heat exchanger tests is being investigated. The
K-25 loop test of ARE components is being con-
tinued as a life test of the ARE type pump, and
over 3000 hr of operation hcs been [ogged De-
velopmental work is under way on pumps for the
ART, with particular emphasis being given to
impeller fabrication and performance.

Three Inconel forced-circulation loops have been
operated with NoF-ZtF;‘-UFI‘.' The first two loops
tailed after 48 and 3 hr, respectively, but the third
loop has operated for 150 hr with a Reynolds
number of 10,000 and a 200°F temperature gradient,
A third beryllium-sodium-Inconel mass transfer
test has been completed and has been submitted
for metallographic examination, and components
have been fabricated for tests of sodium in multi-
metal loops. o

Developmental work is under way on components,
such as a pump and a gas-furnace heat source,
for a loop for testing fused salt-to-NaK heat ex-

changers. A leak test has indicated that smq[l ;
|eaks of fluoride fuel into NaK are self-plugging. ~

in a safe and reliable experiment.

The proposed test unit will consist of an 8-ft
loop of Y%-in. schedule-40 seamless pipe with a
little over 1 ft in the active zone of the reactor.
The ratio of the total volume to the volume in the
high flux zone, known as the dilution factor, is
approximately 10. Flows in the turbulent region,

'Reynolds number approximately 4000, with a

maximum temperature of 1500°F have been pro-
posed. A temperature differential of 300°F and
heat transfer of 30 to 50 kw are expected with a
power density of approximately 2 kw/cm®. These

" conditions probably can be achieved with a fuel

composed of f\lcﬂ“:--Zrl:A-L'H:4 (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %).

Design work is proceeding on this loop and its
components to meet the above specifications.
Handling equipment is planned which will fa-
cilitate isothermal operation of the loop prior to
insertion into the reactor and which will also
receive the radioactive materials after in-pile

has been reduced by locating the inlet and dis-

A Lucite model incorporating the changes made
as a result of the tests described above has been
tested with water. The curves of Figs. 3.1 and

ferent speeds and impeller side clearances. As
may be noted, the total impeller end clearance
is a primary factor in determining pump per-
formance, while the distribution of clearance, front
to back, is relatively unimportant. This is fortu-
nate, since the end clearance can be fixed in
fabrication, but the impeller position is affected
by thermal expansion and bearing alignment. ’

The pump has unusual ability to remove gas.
In water tests, air was injected into the impeller
at a rate of several cubic inches per minute and
was ~ continuously removed with only a slight

“increase in the amount of gassing. Under normal
operation there is usually no more than 1 vol %
‘of gas in the fluid.

The pump will satisfactorily prime and fill the

test loop in which it is installed if fluid is added

to the sump while the pump is running and the

total impeller side clearances are mamfalned at

0.040 in. or less. However, priming becomes
errafic with the greater clecrcnces required for
operation of the pump at high temperatures.
Several mefhods have been demonstrated for ob-
taining a posmve 'dlsp]acemenf of fluid into the
foop with Iarge pump clearances. Each method,
however, requires either complicated freeze valves
or pressure controls. Vacuum filling appears to
be the most atiractive solution to the problem but

A 5|ng|e-tube, longitudinal ly fmned, salt-to-gir
heat exchanger has been fabricated for use in an
in-pile loop. Since the staggered-fin arrangement

required to ensure adequate heat transfer with air

resulted in a very high pressure drop, it seems
imperative to use a lead shielded recirculating
system with a secondary gas-to-water heat ex-
changer for safety in the event of a salt break
into the gas stream. The use of helium would

simplify both heat exchangers, ‘dnd therefore a

The test loop, set up at K-25 for eS:omining

ARE fuel-tube hair-pin sections and an ARE heat
exchanger, was stopped after 2047 hr of nearly
trouble-free operation for removal and examination
of the ARE test components. At the time of
removal of the ARE test components, only a
cursory inspection of the pump was made because
operation had been trouble-free except for the
plugging of gas nozzles with zirconium fluoride
vapor condensate. An inspection of the inside
surfaces of the pump tank cover revealed sta-
lactites of salt that covered nearly all riser and
nozzle skirts and bolts and protruded beneath the
lower heat radiation baffle intoe the pump tank
gas space. These stalactites are not deleterious
to pump operation. The loop was modified to
consist only of the pump, loop piping, throttling

valve, and the previously used venturi element,

and the pump has now been operated for an ad-
ditional 1000 hr at 1350°F, 40 gpm, and 1500 rpm.
Slight noises were noticed at the pump bearing
housing after a total of 2847 hr of operation.
However, these noises had not greatly increased
when the total operating time had reached 3000 hr.
The gas-line-plugging problem which was en-
countered after 2047 hr of operation was eliminated
completely by a newly designed vapor trap. Oper-
ation of the loop is being continued as a life test
of the pump. |

unlike those encountered in developing ARE
pumps, but they will be magnified by the higher
capacity requirements, by the resulting higher

-power requirements, and by a number of special

restrictions imposed because of the proposed
locations of the pumps.

The location of the fuel pumps imposes problems
in impeller and in inlet and discharge housing
design, since it will be necessary to match the
fluid dynamic requirements of passages leading
from heat exchangers into the pumps and from the

pump discharge housings into the core. Various

impeller des‘igns"rure being investigated and will
be used to evaluate cavitation characteristics.
Previous experience with ARE impellers indicates

that casting is not a promising means for fabri-

cating Inconel impellers in the present state of
the art, and therefore a brass impeller has been

'made for studying fabrication problems and ob-

taining initial performance data.  Preliminary
planning has been started for the fabrication of

.44

models for study of pump discharge and entry
conditions, -

Seal design, bearing structure, cooling, lubri-
cating, and driving means are other problems being
studied, and the reliability of these components
and operations is being ascertained through a
succession of mechanical shakedown, water per-
formance, and high-temperature tests.

loop was constructed of 0.5-in.-0D, 0.020-in.-wall

been made to get the loop back in operation, but,
in each case, failures of the tubing occurred during
the cleaning operation with barren fuel mixture.

that the loop could be operated without a heat

be simplified.

A third loop, without the economizer, was built
with 0.5-in.-OD, 0.045-in.-wall Inconel tubing.

Several ’rests of burners were made in v order to
obtom prellminary data for design of a natural-gos
heat source for forced-circulation corrosion test
Ioops. It was found that exhaust gas temperatures
of between 2800 and 3300°F could be obtained
without initial air preheating, and, by using air
at a rate of 65 to 650 cfm, the equivalent of 100
to 1000 kw of heat was released. Maximum system
thermal efficiencies of 20 to 60% appear to be
feasible.

Tests with eleciric-resistance heated units indi-
cate a maximum wall temperature of 1750°F with
the tubing lengths required by pressure-drop and
flow considerations. Somewhat higher tube-wall
external element temperatures or proportionately
longer heater sections would be required with gas
heating. An economic study indicates that there
is little choice between providing electrical power
supplies and providing large-capacity air supplies
for gas heating. Therefore, since development of
a gas-heated unit specifically for this purpose
would be expensive and since there is no present
proof of reliability of components and operation
of gas-fired loops, further study of gas firing for
these test loops appears to be unwarranted.

A preliminary heat exchanger test reported previ-

of the exchanger (1682 hr of operation), but little

the next experiment, a regenerative system is to
be used in which the heat exchanger will be an

It has been postulated that small leaks which
develop in metal walls separating NaK and fluo-
ride fuels may be self-plugging as the result of
the precipitation of high-melting-point reaction
products. A program of tests is currently under
way to check this possibility. To date, one test
has been run, which indicates that self-plugging
can occur with NaF-ZrF,-UF, fuels. The leaks
are installed between three cells as shown in
Fig. 3.5. The center cell is pressurized to leak
into the end cells under the pressure differentials
shown, 5 and 50 psi.

The test rig was filled with NaF-ZrF ,-UF , fuel
in the center cell and NaK in the end cells. The
leaks were about 0.002 in. in diameter. After
12 hr at 1300°F, there was no apparent leakage,
and x-ray pictures taken at intervals during the
test showed no changes in liquid levels.

A series of tests is being made in order to
determine whether an existing model DANA pump
(ARE moderator-coolant-type sump pump) is suit-
able for the high-speed operation which will be
required in the intermediate heat exchanger test
loop. Critical shaft-speed determinations made
by K-25 personnel indicated that the pump could
be operated saofely at the proposed speed of ap-
proximately 3700 rpm.

only because of the increased temperature differ-

also because of the clean condition of the inside

local boiling of the sodium coolant, by accumu-

lation of a gas pocket in the line, by external

corrosion in the hlgh—temperature exhaust gases,
or by higher-than- predlcfed local gas- -side heat
transfer coefficients. The coolant tubes were
arranged in ten pora“ei passes that were mani-
folded into two ‘banks of five passes each. It
was observed in operation that the sodium outlet
temperature from one bank of five tubes was as
high as 1550°F, while that from the other was
only 1480°F. Temperature variation from tube to
tube within each bank of five tubes could con-
ceivably have been equally bad and have resulted
in hypothesized sodium temperatures of 1600 to

- 1650°F. The bmlmg point of sodium is 1620°F

at utmospherlc pressure and about 1800°F at
2 atm, and thus local boiling of the sodium,
together with consequent reduction in the local
heat transfer coefficient, is certainly a con-
ceivable possibility. Although it seems possible
that small amounts of gas were trapped in the
spirally wound tube coils d‘uting initial filling
with sodium, the location of the tube failures
makes it difficult to visualize the accumulation
of gas in stable gas pockets as contributing to
the failures.

Some external corrosion and erosion of the tubes
were observed, but there was no strong evidence
that they were advanced enough to have been the
cause of failure. The gas-side local maximum
heat " transfer coefficient could have been con-
siderably higher than the predicted value of 60
Btu/hr.ft2.°F because of nonuniformity of gas
flow and combustion, and burning could have taken
place on or very near to the tubes in question.

Natural-Gas Burner

The exploratory tests on gas burners, described

previously,® were used as a basis for new burner

developments. Designs for obtaining better mixing
of air and gas and higher pressures in the burning
chamber have been investigated, and some tests
have been made in which preheated air and gas
were used. The test units were based, in general,

~on designs developed by the Esso Marketers in
the past few years. |In these units, the burning

chamber serves also as a flame holder and a

" burning-rate controller. A schematic diagram of

the basic design is shown in Fig. 3.7.

The first burner that was built was operated
at approximately 3100°F and 400-kw heat release
without. a pressure-forming barrier at the exit of
the burner. It was then operated at about 3200°F
and 250-kw heat release at about I/3 atm pressure
drop from burner to air to simulate a heat ex-
changer after the burner.

A second burner was designed on the basis of
data from the first burner, plus specific provision
for preheating the air and gas. Tests were con-
ducted in which a temperature of about 3300°F
and 1-Mw heat release were obtained by using
unpreheated air and gas. Auxiliary tests indicated
that premixed air and gas fuel could be preheated
to 1600°F or more without serious preignition.

Gas line plugging with zirconium fluoride vapor

of the ARE component test at K-25, Plugging
was eliminated by heating the gas line to 1300°F
and by installing the vapor trap so that no cold
surfaces for vapor condensation were available
until the gases reached the large cross-sectional
area of the trap. This type of unit was first tested

which time approximately 125 t3 of helium was

the test loop at K-25, and approximately 70 3
of vapor-laden helium was periodically vented
from the pump tank without plugging. The trap
has since operated over 900 hr with more than
100 periodic vent operations without plugging.
Similar traps installed in the ARE fuel pump were
also successful.

The second of two critical assemblies of the
reflector-moderated reactor was constructed as a
part of a program presented previously.! The
reactor is composed of a beryllium reflector and a

" fuel region of enriched uranium metal and Teflon

(CF2)n. The first assembly, an essentially spheri-
cal fuel core surrounded by the reflector, was
described in the previous report.2  Since it con-
tained no extraneous structural materials, the
experimental results could be compared with the
results of multigroup reactor calculations. The
results of the second experiment were also to be
correlated with the calculations, since the second
assembly, too, was unpoisoned by structure, The
assembly has a central polyhedral core, or isfand,
of beryllium about 10 in. in diameter enclosed by a
4.5-in.-thick uranium-Teflon fuel annulus. The
fuel is surrounded by an effectively infinite be-
ryllium reflector.  Aluminum shells, 0.065 in.
thick, separate the fuel from the island and from
the reflector and provide structural stability, The
assembly is completely described elsewhere,® and
a summary of its composition is given in Table 4.1,
Figure 4,1 is a view of the mid-section.

The calculated? critical fuel loading was 7.16 kg

of U235, or 0,142 g of U235 per cubic centimeter

of fuel annulus. The first critical experimental

of U233 per cubic centimeter of fuel annulus. This
latter loading has been shown, by calibrated control

rods, to contain 0.92% excess reactivity, equivalent
to about 0.31 kg of U235, which gives 4.35 kg of
U235 as the critical mass of the unpoisoned
assembly, '

A series of measurements of neutron and fission-
rate distributions and of reactivity coefficients
will be made prior to the incorporation, in the
structure, of additional materials to simulate

attendant fo handling the easily oxidized UF,
will be alleviated to some extent by extendlng
phase studies to include LaF;, an isomorphous
stable substitute for UF,.

Investigations of the chemlcc[ reactions in molten
salts are conhnumg in an effort to understand the

" mechanisms mvolved in the purlflcahon of fluoride

mixtures and in ‘the reduction of UF, to UF3 in
fluoride melts. Slmulcr studies of the corrosion
products of Inconel in fluoride mixtures and of the
reduction of UF, by structural metals are under

A sufficient stock pile of purified zirconium

Study of UF;-bearing systems has been con-
tinved on NaF-ZrF ,-UF,, NaF-UF,, KF-UF,, and
Zrl::“-UF‘,-UF3 mixtures, In addition, work was
begun on NaF-LaF; and KF-LaF; systems, since

LaF, ‘is known to be a stable *'stand-in'’ for the

more difficultly handled UF,. Work on the KF-UF,
mixtures has revealed that a red phase, formerly
designated as K3UF,, may have as much as 75%
of the uranium in the tetravalent state; its apparent
homogeneity over a wide range of UST/U%Y is
possibly due to a solid solution of K;UF, and

58

 

K;UF,. The existence of the latter has yet to be
demonstrated. It is now thought that NaUF ,, rather
than Na,U,F,, as previously postulated, is the
empirical formula of an incongruently melting
compound in the NaF-UF, system.

UF, in ZrF -Bearing Systems. Studies of ZrF ,-
UF ,-UF, mixtures were reported earlier.3*4 The
more recent of the reports? indicated a probable
composition of 50 mole % ZrF4-.-25 mole % UF4—-25
mole % UF, for a brownish, slightly birefringent
phase noted in this system. Recent studies of
mixtures in this system that were prepared by
adding uranium metal to ZrF ,-UF, mixtures and
stitring the partially reduced melts until they
solidified indicated that the mixture with the above
composition consists of two phases, while a
mixture containing 33.3 mole % ZrF ~33.3 mole %
UF,-33.3 mole % UF, is essentially a single-
phase brownish crystalline material that is be-
lieved to be a compound. Another phase observed
at higher ZrF, concentrations, usually described
as olive-drab, appeared to be the only phase
present in a mixture containing 75 mole % ZrF ,—
12.5 mole % UF,-12.5 mole % UF,. All these
compositions are theoretical compositions based
upon complete reaction between UF, and uranivm
metal in the molten material. The meager analyti-
cal data available for such mixtures indicate that
the reactions probably did not go to completion in
all cases, and so the percentage of UF is likely
to be higher and the percentage of UF; lower than
are shown by the formula.

In the NaF-ZrF -UF; system, four compositions
wete prepared along a join connecting the minimum
melting compositions in the NaF-ZrF, binary (42
mole % ZrF ,; mp, 500°C) and the NaF-UF; binary
{29 mole % UF,; mp, 715°C). Liquidus tempera-
tures determined by thermal analysis for the
mixtures containing 5, 12, 20, and 25 mole % UF,
were 650, 775, 865, and 775°C, respectively., The
25 mole % UF, mixture contained free UF,, in
addition to the NaF-UF; complex and Na,ZrF .

NaF-UF, complex was assigned the formula
: K3U,Fg. It was also previously reported® that all
| KF-bearing reduced-uranium mixtures that were
analyzed chemically contained varying quantities
of tetravalent uranium‘, usually in a form that could
hot be recognized as such either petrographlcolly
or by x-ay diffraction analysis, Some progress
was made durmg the past quarter in gaining a
better undersfondmg of phase relationships in this
KF system, Investlgahon of the KF-UF, system
has been considerably aided by begmn:ng the
study of the KF- -LaF, system, The compound
LaF, is isomorphous with UF,, has almost identi-
cal lattice dimensions, and, furthermore, has only
one stable valence state (3+) whereas UF
maintained with dn‘flculty. Dergunov’ published
partial phqse diagrams for the alkali fluoride~LaF,
sysfems, and Zocharncsen8 has studied mtxtures
of KF and NaF with LaF; by an x-ray diffraction
technique. Both w°rkers indicated only a single
compound, KLaF,, formed by these two compo-
nents, According to Dergunov, it melts incongru-

NaUF , rather than NasU,Fo.  Since UF, is the
primary phase that separates from the melt at the
50-50 composition and since UF, has a higher
density than the liquid, it is likely that the earlier
identification of compound composition was in
error because of lack of equilibrium conditions on
cooling.

UF; Stability
W. C. Whitley ~~ R. J. Sheil
- Materials Chemistry Division

Du‘_ring' the past quarter studies have been under

‘way on the stability of UF, separately and mixed

with KF. Disproportionation of UF; in KF in

Inconel at 1000°C has been established. When

't:‘c:;h’rd'ined alone in Inconel, UF, does not detect-
ably disproportionate below 1250°C.,
Stability of UF; at Elevated Temperatures. The

'-dlsproporflonqtlon of UF; as a function of temper-

ature was studied eorher under high vacuum.

‘Recent availability of high-purity UF,; made de-

sirable a study of the high-temperature stability
of UF; in a helium atmosphere. For these experi-
ments 25-g samples of UF, that contained 99.4%

of the uranium in the trivalent form were sealed

by welding in Inconel tubes containing '% atm of
helium. After being heated at the desired temper-
ature for 1 hr, the tubes were removed from the
furnace and were dair quenched to minimize re-
combination of UF ; and uranium metal. After the
UF, samples were cooled to room temperature and
ground in an inert atmosphere, they were examined
petrographically, by x-ray diffraction, and by
chemical analysis. The sample heated to 1200°C
showed no evidence of disproportionation, the
sample heated to 1250°C showed very slight
evidence, and the sample heated to 1300°C showed
definite evidence. [n addition tfo the increase in
UF_4 content noted Jn the petrographic examination,
an increase in U4* was shown by chemical analy-
sis (from 0.6 to 1.6%), and the presence of uranium
in the tube walls that had been in contact with the
UF3.was established. These data show that UF,
is more sfable at elevated temperatures than
estimates of its thermodynamic properties !4 12
had indicated. [t is interesting to note that the
sample of UF; heated to 1300°C was practically
insoluble in b0|||ng 10 N HCI, whereas samples

" heated to lower temperatures dissolved readily in

this solvent. This could indicate that either a
sintering action occurred, which takes place in
oxide systems well below the melting point, or

that the small amount of liquid UF, formed at the
high temperature exerted a cementing action of the
UF, crystals on solidifying.

Stability of UF; in KF. An attempt was made to
determine the stability of UF in molten KF as a
function of temperature by starting with dry KF
and high purity UF, (99.4%). Mixtures of KF and
UF, in the molar ratios of KF to UF, of 3.0, 1.5,
aond 1.0 were mixed, sealed in Inconel capsules
containing ]é atm of helium, and heated for 2 hr
at various temperatures before air quenching. A
period of two weeks elapsed between the time of
the experiment and the time that the samples were
submitted for chemical analysis for total uranium
and U3* and thus there is some doubt of the
significance of the U3* determinations. However,
both the total uranium and the trivalent uranium
values exhibited a downward trend with increasing
temperature in the temperature range 750 to 1050°C
for mixtures having a 3 to 1 KF-UF, molar ratio.
An average of 7 moles of UF. disappeared per
gram-atom of uranium lost, presumably by alloying
of the uranium metal with the Inconel capsule
walls, Mixtures having 1.5 to 1 and 1 to 1 KF-UF,
molar ratios were heated to 850 and 1050°C, Analy-
ses of these melts also showed the downward trend
in U3* and total uranium values with increasing
temperature. In these samples, however, the ratio
of moles of UF, (or gram-atoms of trivalent ura~
nium) to gram-atoms of uranium lost averaged about
5 as compared with the theoretical value of 4. The
capsules used to contain these materials were not
analyzed for metallic uranium; however, a similar
experiment was performed in which an 85 mole %
KF-15 mole % UF, mixture was heated to 1000°C
in an Inconel capsule for 90 min, The melt was
sampled by drilling after the top and bottom of the
capsule had been cut off. The remainder of the
melt was dissolved out, and the walls were care-
fully cleaned mechanically; then, approximately
7 mils of the tube wall that had been in contact
with the melt was removed by drilling. Flashes
of light observed during drilling gave a qualitative
indication of the presence of uranium in the tube
walls which was confirmed by chemical analysis,
which showed 17.9 wt % uranium. The total of
0.28 g of uranium that was recovered from the tube
walls represented 3.6% of the total uranium con-
tained in the KF-UF; mixture. Analysis of the
melt showed 70% of the total uranium to be in
the trivalent state. It seems certain that dispro-

portionation of UF, occurred at a lower tempera-
ture than would have been expected in the absence
of KF. Further experimentation is planned to
determine the stability of UF, in KF and other
solvents as a function of temperature and of con-
tainer material, Preliminary experiments indicate
that UF; may be more stable when dissolved in
KF in a plchnum container than in a mckel cone

As a result of the high frequency of failures ex-
perienced with nickel capsules containing NaF-UF ,
samples, a new system was designed for containing
samples during differential thermal analysis.
Graphite containers constructed so that the thermo-
couple junctions can be immersed directly in the
melt are now being used, The new system is
designed to permit evacuation before mfroduc’non
of helium as the inert atmosphere,

A cylindrical graphite block (378 in, in diameter
and 6 in. high) serves as a heat sink inside a
nickel reaction vessel (4 in, in diameter and 7 in,
deep) with a flanged head. Six graphite thimbles,
l/2 in, iD, 3'/4 in. OD, and 3 in. deep, are spaced

on a hexagonal artay inside the upper half of the

graphite block. Each thimble is filled to a depth
of about 1 in., with either sample (about 6 g) or
reference material, Al,0,; the sample depth is
reduced by about 50% upon melting.

whether o greater percentage of UF, could be
reduced to UF, in NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46,5-42.0
- mole %) at a Iower temperature than previously
used, a trial was made in nickel at 500°C, After
2 br of equilibration of the alkali fluoride with
sufficient UF, to equal 25 wt % uranium as UF,
' _'and 100% excess uranium metal, the mixture could
" not be filtered, and no quadrivalent uranium was
S deitec_t_able by petrographic or x-ray analyses, Thus
complete reduttioﬁ‘ of UF, to UF, was indicated.

‘A similar experiment mvolved equnhbrcfmg the
NOF LIF eutectic (40-60 mole %) in nickel for 2 hr
at 725°C with added UF, and an excess of ura-
nium metal, Chemlcal cmoly5|s revealed that
all the uranium present after the test (25 wt %)
was in the frivalent form, When the same type of
experlment was catried out with the LiF-KF
eutectic (50-50 mole %) at 600°C, only 60% of
uranium was found to have been reduced. Thus
KF appears to differ from NaF and LiF as a
_solvent for UF, and UF,.

A trace of volatilized alkali metal was the only
evidence of reduction when purified KF was heated
at 900°C for 2 hr with finely divided vranium metal.
A similar result was noted when NaF-KF-LiF

(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) was heated to 700°C with
uranium metal for 4 hr with gas stirring, Dispro-
porfionation of UF, is therefore seen as a reason-
able explanation for the quadrivalent uranium found
in UF ;-KF mixtures.

Heating of high-purity UF; with the NaF-KF-LiF
mixture at 800°C yielded material which, when
filtered, was found to have 73% of the uranium in
the filtrate, as well as all the uranium in the
residue, present as U3*, Evidence of slight vola-
tilization of the alkali metal precludes a definite
conclusion as to whether reduction of KF or dispro-
portionation of UF, was responsible for the de-
tected UF,; however, the presence of uranium
metal also in the residue indicates strongly that
some disproportionation took place.

In the elecfrolyses of KCI the vormbie in the
two experlmem‘s was the insertion of a “‘dia-
phragm’’ between the electrodes in one of the runs,
The diaphragm could produce the following effects:
first, aHHough the surface areas of the electrodes
involved were the same in both runs, the interpo-
sition of an msulahng crucible with a small hole
through which all the current must flow could
result in a smaller effective surface area for the
cathode. Thus, despite the maximum current in
each cell being the same (1 amp), the current
density of the unseparated cell might not have
been large enough to extrapolate to a true value
of E, the decomposition potential. Second, and

- more likely, the lower voltages obtained in the

cell without the diaphragm were due to interaction
of the electrode products at one of the electrodes.

1t should be noted also that the decomposition

po'fenhols measured in this case decreased with
time. In other runs with KCl for which small
cothodes were ‘used, for example, rods or wires,
decomposmon pofenhols of around 3.25 v were
found, with or without the use of a dlaphragm.
This anofnaly may be due to a greater evolufion

~of gaseous potassium at an electrode of small

surface area, whereas a thin layer of pofassium
formed over a large area may go into solution more
readily. | | -

are differences in the measured decomposition

of dilute solutions of CrCl, undergoing reaction

These data indicate that CrF, in NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic is quite stable toward reduction by
nickel. In the most favorable case, less than 10%
of the CrF; appears as Cr**. The solubility of

~trivalent’ chromium seems to be at least 10,000

ppm af 600°C and at least 40,000 ppm at 800°C;

the solid phases observed in the cooled melts
were complex fluochromates.

When CrF2 is the additive, however, the situ-
ation is entirely different. Most of the dissolved
chromium is trivalent; complex fluochromates are
observed in the cooled filtrate. The amount of
material added was such as to exceed the solu-
bility of CrF, ot 600°C; so at that temperature
no material balance is possible. At 800°C, how-

ever, the solubility limit was, apparently, not

exceeded, and the concentrations found corre-
sponded extremely well to those to be expected
if chromium metal were not soluble in the melt
and if the reaction

3CrF,==2CF, + C°

had occurred. Published figures for AF for CrF,
and CrF, show that the standard free energy for
the recctlon, as written, is +14 kcal and suggest
that

in the melt must be less 'rhan_]O" . Addmona?i
data at various temperatures and concentration
levels to be obtained in the near future should
afford a more accurate estimation of the equi-
librium constant for this reaction.

When ferrous fluoride is added to the NaF-KF-
LiF mixture in equipment of nickel, no appreci-
able reaction is observed. The solubility of FeF
appears to be 12 wi % at 600°C and 19 wt % at
800°C, and it appears that FeF, is dispropor-
tionated very slightly, if at all.

If ferric fluoride is added to NaF-KF-LiF in
equipment of nickel, considerable quantities of
NiF, are observed in the filtrate, and thus re-
duction of the Fe3* by nickel metal is indicated.
However, the experiments made to date have not
afforded reasonable material balances between
NiF,, Fer, and FeF3 in the system. Additional
data will be required before this reaction can be
evaluated.

trations have been calculated from the Fe'f

values found for the filtrates, since a reliable
method for determining UF, in this mixture is not
available.

It will be noted that the values given for K
at 600°C are larger than those at 800°C, which
is in agreement with all previous measurements.
The values at the respective temperatures are
also in fair agreement with those given earlier.

The reaction between UF, and chromium in
Inconel with NaF-ZrF, as solvent has been in-
vestigated at 800°C. In these experiments, 2 g
of Inconel {hydrogen fired at 1200°C) was con-
tacted with the melt for 5 hr prior to filtration.
The results are given in Table 5.4.

The values given in Table 5.4 for the equi-
librium constant are lower by about a fivefold
factor than those obtained when chromium metal
was used. |t is possible that the activity of
chromium metal in Inconel is appreciably less
than its mole fraction. It appears more likely,
however, that these experiments represent ‘‘equi-
librium'' with Inconel whose surface layer is
depleted of chromium metal. Additional data will
be obtained by using longer equilibration times
and varying surface-to-volume ratios.

A study of equilibria for reactions of Fe° and
Ce® with UF, in the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic has
been started. It has been observed that when
Fe® is equilibrated with the NaF-KF-LiF mixture
alone about 100 ppm of Fe (presumably Fe**) is
found in the filtrate. This is very close to the

Elecfrolytuc Purification of Zirconium-Base

Fluorldes
C M. Biood H. A. Friedman

Materials Chemistry Division

Interest in the extremely short process time and
high efficiency obtained in the electrolytic purifi-
cation of molten NaF-ZrF, mixtures led to an ex-
ploration of the limitations of electrolysis as a
means of purification. At cathode current densities
up to 0.3 amp/cm?, the presence of UF, in a salt
mixture was found to greatly reduce the efficiency
of electrolysis because the reduction of UF
UF, at the cathode was counteracted by the
oxidation of UF; to UF, at the anode. A steady
* state was approached wi\en about 5% of the UF
* had been converted to UF ;. Apparently the rapid
':reduchons obfomed with NaF-ZrF | mixtures con-
k:'ralmnrg no UF4 were due, in large part, to the

- electrolytic precipitation of zirconium metal on
- the cathode and to the removal of fluorine as HF
.‘,‘_‘-f;ff.‘-:when 'H, was used as the stripping gas or as
jffluorocorbons when He was used. The reduced
“--77,,-_7,:metall|c |mpurmes were precipitafed in the

 

cathode deposit. Any structural metal ions which
were not deposited as a primary electrode process
were precipitated by reaction with the zirconium
metal. |

Electrolysis was most effective in purification
when two advantages were achieved: first, a rapid
rate of over-all reduction of the melt, or a good
current efficiency, as measured by a high rate
of removal of HF or fluorocarbons, and second,
the deposition of impurities as an adherent cathode
coat which could be removed from the cell. In
NaF-LiF-KF mixtures the electrolytically reduced
potassium was slightly soluble in the melt, and
therefore oxidation of dissolved potassium at the
anode nullified reduction at the cathode and the
current efficiency for over-all reduction was low.
Also, an adherent cathode deposit was not
regularly found.  Presumably, both these ad-
vantages could be regained, not only for the

NaF-LiF-KF system but for UF ,-containing melts

as well, by alterations in cell design, electrode
construction, and current densities.

Some of the incidental points noted were that
0=~ and SO,~~ could be removed by electrolysis
in NaF-ZrF4 melts, and hence HF treatment is
not necessarily required in the purification of salt
mixtures. Platinum was unsuitable as an anode
material. The NaF-LiF-KF mixtures were par-
ticularly prone to show an ‘‘anode effect,”” or gas
polarization of the graphite anode, when there
was a slight contamination by air. The UF -UF,
oxidation-reduction system showed no poiurrzc’rlon
at graphite anodes or nickel cathodes.

The electrolyses were carried out in apparatus
of the type previously described.2?2 The graphite
anodes were 1.12 em in diameter and were im-
mersed to a depth of about 10 ¢cm to give an area
of about 25 cm?2. The cathodes were constructed
of a ¥-in.-dia cylinder of nickel gauze having a
calculated immersed area of about 70 cm2. The
wet areas of the pot and of the probes which were
occasionally used as electrodes were 500 and
10 cm?, respectively. Ordinarily, 10 amp was
passed during any continuous electrolysis step.

Preliminary results with SO,~~ removal were
sufficiently encouraging that an electrolysis trial
with helium as the sweep gas was carried out on
a 3-kg batch of NaF- ZrF, (53-47 mole %) which

had received no prewous purification other than

the drying which occurred on heating to 600°C.
When the current was applied at 600°C, 30 v was
required to obtain 1 amp. The anode was removed
for examination, found to be in good condition,
and reinstalled. Apporenfly, this was an ‘‘anode
effect,”” and it was probably due to the presence

of oxygen, which is frequently encountered in the

electrolysis of fluoride melts with carbon anodes.
By using a helium sweep.rate of 200 em3/min,
,CF4 was found to be the major constituent (0.33%)
in the effluent gas. Also, CO was present to an
extent of 0.07%. Cn raising the melt temperature,
the anode effect diminished and then suddenly
disappeared at 710°C. The response to temper-
ature was reversible; the anode effect was pro-
nounced at 700°C and absent at 725°C. The
electrolysis was continuved at 725°C.

- At low current densities (1 amp), where easily
reducible impurities were presumed to be carrying
the . current, the predominant constituent recog-
nizable by mass spectrometry of the. effluent
helium was CO, which was produced at an ef-
ficiency of about 0.2 equivalent per faraday.

At slightly higher current densities (1.3 amp),

~ where a plateau in the E-I curve occurred because

the current was controlled by rate of diffusion
of easily reducible ions and where very little

" increase in current resulted from an increase in

applied voltage, -CF‘# began to appear in the
effluent gas.

‘At still higher current densities, the decom-
position potential of ZrFF, was exceeded, and CF
became more prominent, along with small amounts
of higher fluorocarbons. For 6.0 v and 3.6 amp

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

the efficiency of production of CO was 14%, and
that of CF, was 16%.

As shown in Table 5.5, impurities (940 ppm of
Fet* and smaller amounts of Ni*t and Cr++)
theoretically equivalent to 0.15 faraday were
initially present. Additional elecirolysis beyond
five times the theoretical amount apparently had
little effect on the Fe analysis. The experiment
demonstrated that NaF-ZrF, mixtures may be
effectively purified by electrolysis under helium
without any preliminary HF treatment. No notice-
able corrosion of the electrolysis apparatus oc-
curred.

When H, was used as the sweep gas while
electrolyzing NaF-ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) at 800°C,
HF could be removed ot a rate proportional to
the current used (0.32 equivalent of HF per
faraday). These results were obtained with ¢
purified melt from which zirconium metal was
being deposited.

In view of a poor efficiency found for the elec-
trolyses of 250-Ib batches containing UF,, an
experiment on 3 kg of NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) was carried out by using H, and elec-
trolysis simultaneously. A filtered sample showed,
prior to electrolysis, 740 ppm Fe, 90 ppm Ni,
40 ppm Cr, and 46 ppm S. The HF level when
the filtered sample was withdrawn was 1 x 10-3
mole/liter,  Simultaneous electrolysis and H
stripping were started. Periodically the elec-
trolysis was stopped and the HF concentration
in the effluent H, was measured to oktain an
index of the degree of reduction achieved. The

could be determined. The results are presented .

in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3. After 2.65 faradays had

. passed, the HF level was below 10~% mole/liter,
corresponding to fairly complete purification, and
the trial was terminated. Analysis of the filtered
melt showed 120 ppm Fe, 40 ppm Ni, and 13
ppm Cr. The results given in Fig. 5.2 show that

- the rate of HF evolution with electrolysis is about
three times as great as without electrolysis during
the early stages of the purification. This factor
decreases until there is hardly any difference at

-the end of the run, The decrease is considered

to be due to the gradual accumulation of UF. and
is reflected in Fig. 5.3, which shows the apparent

current efficiency in terms of equivalents of HF
per faraday as a function of the number of faradays

passed. The apparent efficiency varies from 3.5

to 0.5% for the UF ,-containing melt as compared

 with 32% in NaF-ZrF,. The cause of the low

efficiency was apparent from the current-voltage
cutves obtained,.when UF , was present.

After electrolysis had proceeded for a short
time, decomposition potentials and ‘‘knees’’ were
not encountered. Plots of current against voltage

showed a sharp increase from the origin and thus -

indicated that no overvoltages or decomposition

"potentials need be exceeded to obtain large

currents. This increase was interpreted as being
due to the presence of UF, and a small amount
of reduced UF,. The primary electrode reactions,
reduction of UF, at the cathode along with oxi-

dation of UF3 at the anode, caused the over-all

changes in the melt to occur very slowly. No
appreciable amounts of precipitated metals were
found on the cathodes, and it was presumed that
the bulk of impurities such as Fe'! must have
been reduced in the melt as secondary reactions
rather than being deposited on the cathode. Such
behavior might result in metal ‘‘fogs,’’ which
would be most undesirable.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Under ideal conditions, the use of hydrogen
stripping to remove metallic impurities requires
12 to 16 hr. With normal production, that is, reactor
vessels containing metallic impurity holdup from
previous batches, hydrogen stripping may take as
long as 50 hr. Therefore it is apparent that elec-
trolytic purification of non-uranium-bearing com-
positions is the better process, and it is to be
used as soon as permanent facilities can be in-
stalled.

The electrolysis of uranium-bearing compositions
is still being investigated. Two batches of NaF-
ZrF ,-UF , (50-43.5-6.5 mole %) have been subjected
to electrolytic purification. The first baich was
given 12 hr of electrolysis, and it was found that
the HF out-gas concentration appeared to level
off at 1.6 x 10~4 mole of HF per liter of effluent
hydrogen. = Consequently, electrolysis was dis-
continued and the batch purification was finished
by hydrogen stripping., Analysis of a filtered
sample from this batch yielded 225 ppm Fe, 20 ppm
Cr, and 40 ppm Ni. A second batch of the same
composition was electrolyzed until the desired HF
out-gas concentration was reached, after 27 hr of
purification, during which period 19 hr of elec-
trolysis was employed. Analysis of a filtered
sample from this batch showed 90 ppm Fe, 55 ppm
Cr, and 40 ppm Ni.

The large increase in electrolysis time required
for the uraniumebearing composition has led to a
more detailed study of the effect of uranium on the
electrolytic purification process. Also, the de-
sirability of obtaining alarge stockpile of processed
fluorides by the first of the year and the present
in the electrolytic purification of
composmons have led to the
temporary cbandonmenf of this method of removing

metallic lmpurltles “from 250-1b batches of fluoride

Consequently, experiments were run with mixtures

Comparison with HF-treated

iron, chromium, and nickel concentrations were,
in general, lower than those resulting from HF-

_treated batches. In an attempt to produce the

NaF-KF-LiF eutectic (11,5-42,0-46.5 mole %) plus

14 wt % UF, without the preliminary HF treatment,

it was found that the previous difficulty of in-
consistent results still remained.

A study of the reaction
' U + 3UF4—-—->4UF

in 'rhe presence of cfkah-metal fluorides has shown

~that potassium fluoride has a strong inhibiting
effec'f on the complehon of the reaction. It was
':"found that with the KF concentration of the eutectic

mixture (NaF-KE-LiF, 11.5-42. 0-465 mole %), a
little better than 50% conversion of the UF, to
UF3 could be expected. With this in mind, new
attempts were made to produce consistent batches,
and it soon became evident that the handling
technique was quite important. After several
changes in processing techniques were tried, the
most promising method was chosen as a standard
procedure. Briefly, this method utilizes separate
purification steps for the main constituents in-
volved. The eutectic (NaF-KF-LiF, 11,5-42,0.46.5
mole %) is first heated and stripped with H,. The
melt is cooled and the UF4 is added, after which
the melt is again heated and siripped. The melt
is then cooled, and uranium metal is added. The
final heating and stripping are then carried out,
and the batch is transferred to a storage can.

In this manner, drying and purification of the
alkali metal fluorides are accomplished without

-danger of hydrolyzing or oxidizing the UF ; also,
. thorough mixing of the UF is provided before the
““uranium metal is added. A further advantage is

that the batch is well purified and miscellaneous

did not go to completion, the presence of uranium

by examination of the heels left in the vessel.

A rigid program of equipment preparation was also
initiated. All reactor vessels and receiver vessels
are flange-topped to allow access for cleaning, and
the reactor vessels are equipped with nickel liners
to allow easy removal and cleansing. Receiver
vessels are presently equipped with Inconel liners
because attack by HF gas is no longer a problem
since HF was eliminated from the process. Each
unit is completely disassembled after each run,
and all par'rs are cleaned or replaced when neces-

Smce the tenfohve va[ues for the solubility of

KNO -NaN03 ‘eutectic were reported, 24 experi-

"-'menfs have shown that leakage of xenon through
the frozen seal was possible. To minimize this.

possibility the apparatus was redesigned to have
at least 10 cm of liquid above the frozen section
on the xenon side and to be about 6 cm long. The
new design also permits returning the fused salt
by adjusting the pressure difference and melting
the frozen seal,

While the metallic apparatus for use with the
fluoride eutectic was being rebuilt, the KNO,-
NaNO, eutectic was reinvestigated in a glcss
apparatus that incorporated the new design features
described above. The nitrate mixture can be used
without significant decomposition up to about
450°C; in 6 hr, ot temperature,about 0,01% of the
nitrate was decomposed at 410°C and about 0.3%
was decomposed at 500°C,

With the new apparatus, values of § x 10~% and
9.3 x 10=% mole of xenon per milliliter of melt

MF.XF, Binary Systems. The renewed interest
in the binary systems of alkali fluorides with

uranium trifluorides was emphasized this past
quarter. In studying these systems, difficulties
arise from partial oxidation of U(HI) to U(IV)
and/or through disproportionation of the uranium
in solution in the molten alkali fluorides. It thus
appeared to be worth while first to obtain un-
equivocal x-ray data on the corresponding binary
fluoride complexes of some of the ‘‘4f rare earth’’
metals,2? especially of lanthanum, which may be
considered as a good “*stand-in’’ for U(H1).

Zachariasen reported2é several trifluorides of the
“‘Sfrare earth’’ group as having the same ‘“tysonite’’
structure as those of the ‘‘4f'' group, previously
determined by Oftedal.?” For the trifluorides,
the average La-F and U-F distances are given as
2.50 and 2.56 B\, respectively. The lattice di-
mensions of these hexagonal cells differ by only
0.05%. Thus it is not surprising to discover in
samples prepared here?® that the structure of the
double fluorides?® of NalaF, and KLQF4 had
their counterpart in analogous NGUF4 and KUF,
structures,

According to Dergunov, in MF-LaF, systems
all alkali fluorides, with the possible exception
of CsF, form 1:1 compounds, and only CsF forms
a 3:1, CS3LGF6, congruently melting compound.
These data were obtained by visual observation
of crystallization from melts, Compounds below
the eutectic that are stable and polymorphous
transitions would not have been discerned.

In the present work, fused mixtures of the binary
systems MF-LaF, (except 3NaF-LaF, and LiF
mixtures) of the molar compositions 3:1 and 1:1
were made available from thermal-halt measure-
ments.2?  X-ray diffractometer patterns were ob-
tained on these melts, The phases found in the
NaF and KF systems are indicated in Table 5.7
and are the phases expected for these binary com-
positions., Excellent agreement is shown for the

the melts. The specific conductivity of molten
Kl is expressed by the equation

k = =1.7100 + 6.408 x 10~%
- 2.965 x 10~%:2 mho/cm

between 725 and 925°C, and the density is gwen
by the equation

between 680 and 910°C. The temperature, ¢, is
in °C.
The density and electrical conductance were

determined for pure molten NaBr and are given

The self-diffusion coefficient of sodium ion in

for self-diffusion is approximately 6 kcal/mole and,
therefore, higher than the heat of activation for

for self-diffusion of the thallous ion is greater than
that for electrical conduction. These results are
in accord with the concept that the application
of an electrical field lowers the potential barrier
restricting migration of charged ions in the ap-
propriate direction of the applied field. The self-
diffusion coefficient of a given ion can be used in
conjunction with the Nernst-Einstein equation®®
to calculate the contribution of that particular ion
to the total equivalent conductance of the sait.
When this is done, it is observed for sodium nitrate
and thallous chloride that, in each case, the cation
accounts for about 95% of the equivalent con-
ductance of the respective molten salt at temper-
atures about 25°C above the melting point, This
indicates that the fransport numbers of these
cations relative to thelr anions in these two salts
are opproximately 0 95.

operation for viscosity determinations c¢f alkali
nitrate melts. Effort has been concentrated on
determining viscosity changes immediately above
the melting points as an adjunct to the work being
done by Van Artsdalen to establish the signifi-
cance of ion size on physical properties (see
section above). In view of the low melting points
of the salt mixtures being studied, a glass instru-
ment is used, but it is planned to use an all-metal
apparatus when the investigation is extended to
chloride and fluoride melts.

The salt mixtures studied included pure sodium
and potassium nitrates as well as mixtures of the
two in 12,5 wt % steps. The values obtained for
the pure salts were about 0.3 centipoise above the
data reported by Dantuma,3® who determined the
viscosity by the logarithmic decrement method.
The viscosities of the mixtures nearly overlap at
higher temperatures, being located between the
viscosity curves of the pure components. A plot
of recnprocal temperatures vs the fog of viscosity
gave an apparent deviation from linearity near the
melting point of most of the mixtures, while the
pure salts showed a direct linear correlation.

‘Studies of the corrosion of Inconel, type 316

-‘sfamless steel, Hastelloy B, and several special
qlloys were continued through the use of thermal-
~convection apparatus. Additional information on
‘the compatibility of the sodium-beryllium-Inconel
‘system was obtained from static, whirligig, and

'fhérmql-c;oh‘\)ecfi_on loop tests. In an effort to find
a brazing alloy that has good resistance to sodium
and to NaF-ZrF - UF4, tests of several brazes on

type 304 stmnless steel T-joints were made. Simi-

far joints of A-nickel brazed with various alloys
were also tested in NaF- -ZrF ,-UF, at 1500°F and
in sodium hydroxide at 1100 and 1500°F. Addi-
tional screening tests were made of carbides of
boron, titanium, zirconium, and chromium in static
s'o‘dium, lithium, and NQF-ZrF4-UF4 at 1500°F for
100-hr periods. An 80% Mg—20% Li alloy being
considered as a crew-compartment shielding material
was corrosion tested in water at various temper-
atures; the weight losses were found to be negli-
gible.  The resistance of Inconel to attack by
molten rubidium was studied in a dynamic loop
apparatus. Fundamental studies are under way of
the mass transfer in liquid lead and of fused hy-
droxides as acid-base analog systems, and further
mformahon has been obtained of the flammability
of sodium-bismuth alloys. In further chemical
studies of corrosion, information was obtained on
the effect of temperature and of chromium additions
on the corrosion of Inconel by fluoride melts with

NiF, additions.

Inconel Loop Containing UF, in
- Alkali-Metal-Base Mixtures

- Additional tests were made with alkali-metal-base
fluoride mixtures containing UF; and UF , in Inconel

o __"'thermal-convecnon loops, but the results obfomed
- were not so favorable as those reported previously.!

Cons:derable difficulty was encountered in making

76

the mixtures, in controlling the total uranium con-
tent, and in determining the ratio of UF; to UF,.

Two supposedly duplicate Inconel loops were
operated for 500 hr with the UF;-UF, mixture in
NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %) at a hot-leg
temperature of 1500°F (AT of ~200°F); however,
the rough surface of one loop showed maximum

penetration to a depth of 2 mils, whereas the other

loop was attacked to a depth of 13 mils. In three
other supposedly duplicate loops operated for 1000
hr, attack to depths of 8, 13, and 13.5 mils de-
veloped. Metallic-appearing layers were found in
the cold legs of all these loops.

Several loops filled with NaF-KF-LiF with and
without UF, were operated to obtain comparative
data for use in evaluating the results of these
tests, The data obtained are presented in Table
6.1.

Type 316 Stainless Steel Loops Containing
UF, in Alkali-Metal-Base Mixtures

Several batches of the eutectic NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-
42-46.5 mole %) containing mixtures of UF, and UF
were circulated in type 316 stainless steel loops.
However, the results obtained cannot be used for
comparative studies because the UF ,-to-UF ratios
in the fluoride mixtures were unknown and the mix-
tures were of doubtful purity. One loop plugged after
886 hr of operation at a hot-leg temperature of
1500°F; examination showed heavy, intergranular,
subsurface voids to a depth of 11.5 mils in the hot
leg and some intergranular attack in the cold leg.
Another similar loop operated its scheduled 1000
hr, but a large deposit of dendritic crystals was
found in the cold leg.

A similar loop in which all the uranium (12 wt %)
was present as UF, was operated to obtain com-
parative data. This loop plugged after 570 hr of
operation, and metallic crystals were found in the
cold leg. The hot-leg surface was very rough, and
there was penetration to a depth of 5 mils. The

Effect of Induced Potential

Welding rods for use as electrodes were attached
to the upper hot legs and lower cold legs of Inconel
thermal-convection loops that were operated to
defermlne the effect of a small induced emf on
corrosion, Bah‘ery chargers were used to apply
direct currents of 5. 4 amp at 0.45 v. The loops

SODIUM BERYLLIUM-INCONEL
" COMPATIBILITY

E. E. Hoffman
C. F. Leitten
‘A, Taboada
Meto”urgy Division
As one phase of the sodium- berylllum-lnconel
‘compatibility studies, a series of Inconel thermal-

of the hot legs were operated. The inserts were
hollow cylinders about 6 in. long with inside
diameters the same as those of the Inconel tubing
of the loop. The outside of the beryllium was pro-
tected by an Inconel sleeve and was separated
from it by a 0.050-in. annulus filled with slow-
moving sodium. The loops were operated for 500
he with high-purity sodium at hot-leg temperatures
of 900, 1100, and 1300°F. In none of these loops
was any attack found on the inside surface of the
beryllium, and the outside surfaces of the inserts
in the loops operated at 900 and 1100°F were
similarly unattacked. However, in the loop oper-
ated at 1300°F, the outside surface of the beryllium
insert showed widely scattered voids to a depth of
3 mils, All the beryllium specimens were darkened,
but no deposits were found by metallographic
examination. _ ,

A summary of compatibility tests conducted by
two different methods is presented in Table 6.4.
In none of the tests was a layer deposited in the
cooler portions of the test system that could be
detected metallographically. in all the tests, how-
ever, beryllium was found to be present on various
sections of the Inconel tubes. Figure 6.1 shows
the distribution of beryllium around an Inconel
whirligig loop following a 270-hr test at a hot-zone
temperature of 1200°F and a cold-zone temperature
of 1060°F, Since the velocity of the sodium bath

in this apparatus was 10 fps, the bath temperature
was practically isothermal, The temperatures given
are the outside tube wall temperatures. The be-
ryllium distribution shown appears to be temperature

~ dependent; however, in other dynamic tests, this

was not so obvious. The outside and inside sur-
faces of a beryllium insert from the hot leg of an
Inconel thermal-convection loop are shown in Fig.
6.2. As in nearly all the other compatibility tests,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

the heaviest attack was on the outside surface of
the insert. The attack was due to dissimilar metal
mass transfer between the beryllium and the Inconel
sleeve which surrounded it. The result of direct
contact between Inconel and beryllium in a system

‘containing sodium at elevated temperatures may be

seen in Fig, 6.3, The Be-Ni intermetaliic layer
which formed was approximately 20 mils thick and
was extremely hard and brittle, Tests are presently

STATIC CORROSION STUDIES

Brazing Alloys on Stainless Steel

Additional tests have been made in an effort to
find a brazing alloy that has good resistance to
both sodium and the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF -UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %). The results reported in Table
6.5 were obtained from tests of type 304 stainless
steel T-joints brazed with the alloys listed by the
Wall Colmonoy Corporation. Tests are ‘also being
conducted on Inconel T-joints brazed with each of
the alloys listed in Table 6.5. All the brazing
alloys listed had good resistance to the fluoride
mixture, but only alloy C-29 had good resistance
to both the fluoride mixture and to sodium.

Brazing Alloys on Nickel

A series of T-joints of A-nickel were brazed with
the various alloys listed in Tables 6.6 and 6.7 in
a dry hydrogen atmosphere and were then exposed
for 100 hr to static NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) at 1500°F or to static sodium hydroxide at
1100 and 1500°F,. The specimens were examined me-
tallographically in the as-received condition in
order to evaluate the inclusions and the porosity.
The brazed specimens were thoroughly cleaned
before and after testing so that valid weight change
data could be obtained. In order to prevent the
rounding of the fillet edge upon polishing, each
specimen was nickel plated after testing. The
data obtained from metallographic examination of
the specimens exposed to the fluoride mixture are
presented in Table 6.6, and the data on the speci-
mens exposed to sodium hydroxide are in Table

6.7.

Most of the alloys tested appeared to have good
corrosion resistance to the fluoride mixture, except
the braze alloy with the composition 69% Ni-20%
Cr-11% Si. Several of the brazed T-joints, es-
pecially those which included copper, gold, or
silicon as an alloying element in the braze material,
showed numerous voids in the interface between
the base material and the braze fillet., These voids
are not considered to be caused by the attack of

the fluoride mixture but rather by diffusion of a

The reasons for failure of the B,C to withstand
the corrosive actions of the sodium and lithium are
not known-at this time; powder x-ray analyses of
the tested specimens of B,C indicate that B,C is
the primary phase and that a new, secondary,
unidentified phase is present as a result of both
the sodium and lithium corrosion tests, The attack
on the B,C by the fluoride mixture is not definite
or uniform. The 5 mils of attack found on one side
of the specimen was the maximum depth of attack
if the 14-mil-thick unidentified phase found on the
other side can be attributed to fluoride mixture in
a surface imperfection of the test specimen. Fure
ther tests will be necessary to properly evaluate
B 4C corrosion resistance to the fluoride mixture.

These screening, single-run, static corrosion
tests of B,C, TiC, ZrC, and Cr,C, indicate that
these corbldes, except B,C in lithium or sodium,
warrant further and more severe tests in the in-
vestigation of materials to withstand the long-term,

RUBIDIUM INVESTIGATIONS

The results of preliminary tests of the resistance
of Inconel to attack by molten rubidium were dis-
cussed in the previous report.? Static tests at

- 1500 and 1650°F have shown a maximum attack of
from 1 to 2 mils in ]00 hr. The attack has been
" both m’rergranulor and in the form of subsurface
'vmds. Since these tests indicated that under

" static lso’rhermal condltlons corrosion of Inconel

"‘by rubidium was no serious problem, a dynamic

test was conducted, The resistance of Inconel
to corrosion by flowing liquid and vaporized ru-
bidium in a closed system incorpordting a tempera-
ture gradient was determined by means of a dynamic
loop apparatys, somewhat similar in appearance

to the conventional thermal-convection loops., A

The hot legs of the loop were constructed of 0.5-
in,-OD, 49-mil-wall tubing, and the condenser
section was of 0.25:in.-OD, 35-mil-wall tubing.
The loop was loaded with 8 cm® (approximately
12 g) of vacuum-distilled rubidium, which filled
it to the level indicated in Fig. 6.12, A vapor-
phase heat transfer system of this type will elimi-
nate mass transfer in the vapor regions. However,
the temperature gradients present in the liquid
region might conceivably cause crystal deposition,
The maximum attack occurred in the hot leg of the
loop to adepth of 1mil, as may be seen in Fig.6.13.
The attack was intergranular, and one grain ap-
peared to be ready to fall from the wall,

The first loops in which the 50% Fe-50% Cr

specimen was tested in liquid lead failed after

46 hr of operation with hot- and cold-leg tempera-
tures of 805 and 550°C, respectively. The second
loop failed after. only 30 hr of operuhon with hote
and cold-leg . temperatures of 805 and 500°C, re-
spectively. Microscopic - examination = showed
clearly that a phase transformation took place in
the test specimens during the operation of the
loops. As shown iin Fig. 6.16, a narrow layer of a
second phase formed at the outer surface of the
hot-leg specimens, Hardness measurements yielded
values of 162 and 1140 (DPH hardness scale) for
the new and original phases, respectively. These
values correspond closely to those expected for
ferrite and sigma phases. The possibility that
the new phase was ferritic was supported by the
fact that it was magnetic and by a chemical analy-
sis of the plugs formed in the loops., Since the
plugs were slightly richer in chromium thon in
iron, a decrease in the chromium content of the
outer layers of the test specimens was indicated.
The test temperature was close to the sigma-to-
ferrite transformation pomt ‘and therefore even a
slight alteration in the original 50% Fe--50% Cr

‘composition would produce an alloy in which only
ferrite is stable at the temperature in question.

A second alloy, 50% Mo—50% Fe, was also tested.
This alloy was chosen because an intermetallic
compound predominates at the indicated compo-
sition. Circulation of lead in this loop stopped

Fused Hydroxides as Acid-Base Analog Systems

i fundamenfcl research is to make an effective
contribution to the development of hydroxide
technology, one of the primary goals must be the
evolution of a systematic chemistry of these sub-
stances. No such systematic chemistry now exists.
lt is the purpose of this research to establish a
theoretical basis on which such a systematic

__chem:s’rry can be bu:[f.

In the flrst report on this investigation® the

-":vanous types of self-decomposition equilibria in
fused hydroxides were considered with the aid of
~ thermodynamics. In the case of sodium hydroxide

Equilibria 1 and |1 are far to the left except at very
high temperatures. Equilibrium IH favors the oxide
over the peroxide, although somewhat less so at
higher temperatures than at lower temperatures.

This report is devoted almost exclusively to the
qualitative application of two acid-base analog
theories to Equilibrium |.. This is, of course, only
a small part of fused hydroxide chemistry, and the
conclusions reached will not, by themselves, tell
very much about corrosion phenomena. Héwever,'
they are an essential part of the over-a” corrosnon

quantitative aspects of subjects treofed qual:'ro-
tively in this report, and with Ethbrlq I and 11,
and, hence, with ox1dor|on-reducf|on processes

R

including mass fransfer. o

A large percenfoge of all chemicol reactions in
liquid systems can be classified as acid- -base analog
reactions or as oxidation-reduction reactions. In
most systems the nature of the solvent controls
the acid-base analog reaction, while in oxidation-
reduction reactions the solvent usually plays a
minor role. On the other hand, oxidation-reduction
reactions in fused ‘hydroxides are related to acid-
base equilibria in at least three ways. First, acid-
base reactions depend on Equilibrium | and oxida-
hon-reducfron reactions depend on Equrl:brlum H,
but both are :nterrelcfed by Equrl;brlum I, Second,
in some cases the ‘solvent can stabilize higher
oxldahon states of merols through solvo[yhc re-
action. Thlrd, in some cases the kinetics of the

'hydro_gen replacemenf reaction in fused sodium hy-

droxide appears to be dependent on acid-base equi-
libria in a way onologous to similar replacement
reactions in liquid ammonia. Thus, a study of
acid-base equrl;brrc in fused hydroxides is a neces-
sary prefude to a ‘more interesting study of the

- ox1dohon-reduct|on reochons which are important

in the corrosion ond moss transfer of me’rcls.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

This “‘inert” behavior of the cations in acid-base
processes stems from two factors: first, the large

‘ionic radivs and small charge of i’he'c"crione'dnd

second, the excephonol!y small lonrzahon energy

" of the parent atoms,

Solvent-System Concept. In terms of the solvent-
system concept first introduced by Franklin’ for
liquid ammonia and subsequently applied by
Jander® to a variety of liquids, it is clear that
Eq. 2 fulfills. the formal requirements for a water-
like acid-base equilibrium and, hence, that the
fused alkali-metal hydroxides may be properly
considered as acid-base solvent systems.

The remainder of this report is concerned with

_'a_ determination of the types of reactions which
acid-base theories show to be a consequence of

Eq. 2. The results are given in summary only,

‘together with enough comments to orient the reader
“who is familiar with acid-base theory.

It can be
shown that two acid-base theories, the Brdnsted
protonic-solvent theory and the Lux oxide theory,
are applicable to fused hydroxide systems. Since
the approach in this report is largely qualitative,
it will be convenient to clossﬁy reactions as
either neutralization reactions or solvolytic re-
actions. Neufrollzohon reactions are those in
which the covalently solvent species occurs as
a reaction product, while solvolytic reactions are
those in which the solvem‘ species occurs as a
reactant.

Protomc-System Concept. Equation 2 represents
a proton donor-acceptor equilibrium. Hence, the
protonic-solvent theory is applicable and leads
to the following analysis. One-half the hydroxyl
ions in Eq. 2 are proton donors and, hence, are

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The protons, having an exceptional polarization
potential, react almost completely with the sol-
vent, Eq. 4, represented by the other half of the
hydroxyl ions in Eq. 2. Water, the product of this

. reaction, thus may be regarded as a solvated
proton (onium species) in fused hydroxide so-

lution. Using the protonic-solvent theory, the
quantitative extent of reaction is regarded as
being controliled by the relative proton affinities

‘of the two bases involved in any acid-base equi-
~librium,

Protomc-Solvolyus-Type Reoctlons. At least
three types of protonic-solvolytic reactions might
be expected. First, the hydride ion provides a
special case: |

(6)_, - H- +_OH‘#_O“" + H,
'Secon‘d} : | | | o
(7)  OH™ + HB—>B= + H,0

where B~ is taken as a generalized representation

of an anionic species. Third,

(8) OH- + B-——> BH + O™~

The second type of solvolytic reaction requires
that the hydroxyl ion be a stronger proton acceptor
than the B~ ion. There are, of course, many
examples of this, such as the obvious reaction

(9) OH- + HCI—> CI= + H,0

which, in fused hydroxides, is a solvolytic re-
action and not a neutralization. Equation 9 repre-
sents an obvious reaction because of the ex-
ceedingly weak base character of the chloride
ion. There should, however, be a series of such
reactions involving bases with proton affinities
lying between those of CI~ and OH™, such as
HP04"" and HCO3"', so that the reaction

(10) HCO,~ + OH~—>CO,~~ + H,0

might occur; if it did occur, it would be an ex-
ample of Eq. 2.

The third type of solvolytic reaction, Eq. 8§,
requires that the B~ ion be a stronger base than
the O~~ ion. At best, there will be very few

" instances of this.

Proton n:-Neutru ||zcmon-Type Reactions. Neu-

'_i'frdlizcn‘lon reactions in fused hydroxides which
~can be treated by the protonic theory are also of
three types: (1) the reaction of water with the

oxide ion according to the formula

(11) H,0 + 0=~ —> 20H"

where the water may come from the dissociation

of another compound; (2) the reaction of water
with an ion which is a stronger base than the
hydroxyl ion but a weaker base than the oxide
ion, that is, essentially the reverse of Eq. 7,

(12) H,0 + B~—> BH + OH~
and (3) the reverse of Eq. 8§,
(13) 0~ + HB—> B~ + OH-

An obvious example of the reaction given by

Eq. 13 is 7
(14) O~ + HCl— ClI= + OH“

Kmehco“y, this reaction undoubtedly would go
by two steps,

HCl + OH- — CI= + H,0
H,0 + O~ ~—> 20H~

if the oxide ion were present in low concen-
trations, with the second step controlling the rate.
However, the equilibrium would be represented
by Eq. 14. Equation 13 represents a wider range
of reactions than Eq. 8 because the permissible
proton affinity range for B~ goes all the way up
to that of the oxide ion; therefore the reaction

(15 HCO,~ + 0=~ —> CO,~~ + OH-

is undoubtedly an example in which the bicar-
bonate ion behaves like an acid.

Oxidic-System Concept. There are a great many
reactions in fused hydroxides which cannot be
usefully treated in terms of the protonic-solvent
theory. Consider, for example, the familiar re-
action '

(16) €O, + 20H~—> CO,~~ + H,0

The application of the Brdnsted theory here re-
quires a rather complex, formal treatment. The
actual proton exchange is between the bases OH™
and O~~. The weaker base, OH~, serves as the
proton acceptor, and the stronger base, O~ ~,

" serves as the proton donor. This is the reverse

of the neutralization reaction given in Eq. 11 and
would not be predicted by the protonic-solvent
theory. This seeming contradiction may be re-

solved in a formal way, but it is much more useful
to apply the following straightforward approach.
In Eq. 16 the greater oxide-ion affinity of carbon
dioxide compared with water determines the di-
rection of the reaction.

Lux? and Flood and Férland!® have advanced
a definition of acids and bases which was de-

signed for tréc'fi_ng the special problems en-

countered in nonprotonic fused oxide systems.
According to these authors, a base is an oxide-ion
donor and an acid is an oxide-ion acceptor; thus

(]7) Bcse—\ Acid + O™~

Under this defmmon the convenhonol classifi-
cation of slags as acidic or basic is preserved.
This acid-base concept has not been applied to
solvent systems, but, by a small extension, this
may be done.

Two competing equilibria of the above type can
be considered:

AC ————-“AH + O--

 

 

o~~ + B“—‘“_ABO

(18)
AO + B ¥ BO + ATt
Base | Acid |l Base Il Acid |

The acid-base éqbilibrium shown by Reaction 18

"may be considered to be controlled by a balance

between the oxide-ion affinities of the reactant
acid and the product acid in a manner that would
be analogous to the balance between the proton
affinities of the bases in protonic solvents,

The self- dlssocu:mon of hydroxyl ions according
to Eq. 2 completely fu[ﬁ“s the requsrements of

Thus, water, H-O-H, may be regarded as a pyro-
analog compound of hydrogen and the hydroxyl
ion as the ortho-oxyanion of hydrogen. Because
of acid-base relations involving pyroions, such
as shown in Eq. 19, two hydroxy! ions will always
be taken together to serve as a Lux base analog.

Oxidic-Solvolysis-Type Reactions. The solvo-
lytic reactions involving the oxides and oxysalt
solutes can be classified according to the ioni-
zation energy of the atom other than oxygen in
the oxide. This method of classification is
possible because the ionization energy of an atom
is related to its oxide-ion affinity. It is con-
venient to divide the elements into four groups
according to ionization energy.

First, oxides and oxysalts of atoms having high
ionization energy should react with the fused
hydroxides to give a change in coordination. For
example,

(200 SO, + 2CH™ &= SO,== + HOH

(see also Eq. 16).

Second, oxides and oxysalts of atoms of medium
ionization energy should react with fused hy-
droxides either to form or to depolymerize poly-
anionic acids. For example, the reaction

(21) P,0,4= + 20H-==2P02~ + HOH

will probably take place. The possible reactions
of this type are numerous because of the sub-
stantial variety of polyanions, For example, there
could be the step-wise depolymerization of silicon-
oxygen compounds beginning with the three-di-
mensional network in silicon dioxide, passing
through the two-dimensional net polyanions,

" through ‘the one-dlmensronu] chain (and ring) poly-
““anions, the pyrocm:on, cnd funully endmg wrfh
" the orthosilicate anion.

This second type of solvolytic reaction should

““tend toward depolymerization and, for some parent
“\'otoms, go all the way to the ortho-cxyumon be-
““¢ause of the relatively high basic character of
" the hydroxyl ion. However, there is no assurance
“+ that the ortho-oxyanion will be the most stable
<= form in all coses.

Third, oxides of atoms of low lomzcmon energy
shq_qld react with fused hydroxldes to form oxy-

“salts Th:s represen’rs a conversion from a catlon

 

to an cmlon. For example,

(22)  NiO + 20H-==Ni0,~~ + HOH

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

 If a meta-oxysalt rather than an oxide is used as

the starting material, in some instances, the meta-
oxysalt may be converted into the ortho-oxysalt.

Fourth, oxides of atoms having very low ioni-
zation energy should not undergo solvolysis at
ail. For example, the inert behavior of magnesium
oxide toward sodium hydroxide is no doubt due to
the low ionization energy of magnesium.

There still remain a large number of potential
solutes nof treated above. Of these, the only ones
which the writer has considered are the relatively

';tomc metolhc ‘salts,  These substances will
“probably be separated into ions by the highly

dipolar hydroxyl ions, and the solvolysis of the
cation and the anion can be considered separately.
The cation should tend to form oxides and oxy-
salts. This reaction should go virtually to com-

- pletion except for metals of very small polarization

potential.  The anionic-solvolytic reaction can

'”vary from very complex to nil, and an adequate
" “treatment will require the development of a some-

what more generalized acid-base theory.

'As an example of the reaction of a metal salt
with a fused hydroxide, a small amount of nickel
chloride was added to fused sodium hydroxide at
400°C. The reaction proceeded rapidly with the
evolution of gaseous water and the formation of
a fine black precipitate. The precipitate was
separated from the hydroxide and found by x-ray
analysis to consist largely of nickel(ll) oxide,
together with a small amount of an unidentified
compound.

This reaction can probably be represented, in
large measure, as

(23) NiCl, + 20H™ <= NiO + HOH + 2CI~

Previous . experiments indicate that at higher
temperatures the reaction represented by Eq. 22
would have followed that represented by Eq. 23.
Oxidic-Neutralization-Type Reactions. The neu-
tralization reactions of nonprotonic, oxidic solutes
can be divided into two classes. First, the
neutralization of a base by water takes place

according to the reaction

(24)' BO + HOH—> B** + 20H-

Thls reaction will only occur for nonprotonic

1ac1ds, B** which are stronger than water.

Second, reactions of the following type, which

“décur in pure oxide melts, would represent a
- special type of pseudoneutralization in which no

%

solvent would be produced

(25) Acid + O~ — Base

The reaction shown in Eq. 25 includes the entire
host of reactions treated in the original Lux
theory.

When reactions of the type given in Eq. 25 occur
in fused hydroxides, the oxide ion concentration
can be varied over a wide range of values. This
is not possible with the pure oxide melts to which
the Lux theory has previously been applied. Ex-
amples of the classes of reactions which are of
the type represented by Eq. 25 may be obtained
by substituting O~~ for 20H~ and deleting H,O
in Eqs. 20 through 23. The essential difference
between reactions of the type of Eq. 25 and those
given in Egs. 20 through 23 is that water is
present in the latter reactions but not in the
former. The presence of the acid of medium
strength should shift the equilibrium considerably
for much weaker acids, that is, those derived from
atoms of low ionization energy, but only slightly
for stronger acids, those derived from atoms of
high ionization energy.

Mixed-Type Reactions. Finally, reactions of
substances of what may be called ‘‘mixed’’ types
should be mentioned. These mixed reactions
might involve protonic-oxidic salts of alkali
metals, and protonic or oxidic salts of nonalkali
metals, or combinations of both. The resulting
reactions should be capable of analysis in terms
of the same considerations used in arriving at
the conclusions already stated.

The Bronsted protonic theory was originally de-
veloped to treat the more useful low-temperature
solvents, such as water and liquid ammonia, while
the Lux theory was originally developed to treat
the metallurgically important, high-temperature,
fused-oxide systems. It is of some theoretical
interest that both theories may be rigorously
applied to reactions in fused hydroxides, although
the types of reactions for which these applications
are useful form two sets of almost mutually ex-
clusive reactions — one set for each theory. This
is symptomatic of the need to develop a more
general acid-base theory along the lines proposed
by Audrieth.!! For many solvent systems, such a
theory would be a luxury; for fused hydroxides,
such a theory is a necessity.

In the pre'c:‘eding-hirﬁ‘epwon‘12 data were given for
the flammability of alloys of the sodium-bismuth
system, Additional data have now been obtained
for bismuth-rich alloys that provide a much more
complete picture of the reactivity of this system.
The relative reactivity of sodium-bismuth solutions
with dry air at 700°C as a function of the mole
fraction of sodium is shown in Fig. 6.17. The
relative reochvuty scale is “arbitrary. Pure sodium
was assigned a reactivity of four units. Unre-
active solutions were assigned a reactivity of
zero. No measurements were made for mole
fractions of sodium between 0.6 and 1.0 because
a solid compéund"6"frwébmpositi'o'r'1'-NG;Bi'-p'recipi-

Most of the circles represent two to four tests
each. The open circles represent tests in which

sent those which showed no reaction. The black
triangles represent conditions under which part
of the tests showed no reaction, while the rest
of the tests showed a slight reaction. The two
open triangles represent tests which showed an
exceedingly slight amount of reaction. The broken
portion of the curve is poorly defined, inasmuch
as it may actually pass beneath the open triangles
rather than above them, as shown. It may be noted
that jets of pure bismuth showed appreciable re-

activity at 800°C but not at 750°C,

When air was saturated with water vapor, the
line of zero reactivity was shifted toward lower
sodium concentrations by a small but appreciable
amount for sodium-bismuth solutions. This effect
is shown for sodium-bismuth solutions at 700°C
in Fig. 6.19. It may be seen that, although data
for moist air scatter badly, there is unquestionably
a small shift toward lower sodium concentrations.

Effect of Temperature on the Corrosion of
Inconel Melts with NiF , Additions

In order to sfudy specn‘tcclly the removal of
chromium from Inconel by a known corroding agent
in fluoride melts, additions of NiF2 were made
to NoF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %) in Inconel
capsules. These capsules were subjected to
100-hr static tests in the temperature range 600
to 1000°C.

When the chromium concentration of the melt
after the tests was plotied against the amount of
NiF. added to the melt, a temperature effect at
a relatively high concentration of NiF, (690
meq/kg) was noted. Additions of NiF, up to about
70 meq/kg yielded chromium concentrations which
were independent of temperature to within +100
ppm Cr**. The mixture to which the large addition
of NiF, (690 meq/kg) was made showed, at 600°C,
a chromlum content of 280 ppm Cr +4 that was
considerably below the stoichiometric quantity;
at 800 and 900°C, there were successive increases
to 630 and 840 ppm Cr**; while at 1000°C, 550
ppm Cr** could be found. Metallographic obser-
vations paralleled the chemical analyses. Pos-
sible explanations for the finding of decreased
chromium content at 1000°C were set forth ‘in a

previous report,'3

tests in order to establish the effect of odded
nickel fluoride. In the absence of added chromium
metal, the plot of the chromium concentration after
test vs the nickel fluoride added followed a linear
relationship, although the amount found in the
case of very large additions of NiF, was smaller
than stoichiometric. Metallographic tests showed
a heavy subsurface void formation to a depth of
21 mils at the hot end (800°C) and 5 mils af the
cold end (650°C), while the corresponding blank
capsules (no NiF,) showed only light attack to a
depth of 1 to 2 mils.

A series of Inconel capsules containing the
same two fluoride melts and NiF, with chromium
pellets added were subjected to ﬁ'\e same type of
testing.  The after-test chromium values were
above stoichiometric, and metallographic exami-
nation of the capsule walls indicated that the
NiF., additions had little effect on the amount
of attack. The heaviest attack was to a depth of
3 mils, with the average being 1 to 2 mils. The
cold ends had thin metal depesits and a slight
void formation.

Effect of Chromium Valence State on Corrosion of
Inconel

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
Materials Chemistry Division

Additions of chromous and chromic fluorides
were made to NaZrF_ and NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (53.5-
40.0-6.5 mole %) in Inconel capsules to determine
the effect of chromium valence state. Metallo-
graphic examination showed that chromous fluoride
additions had essentially no effect even in the
case of large additions (18,000 ppm Cr**). The
depth of attack was about 1 mil. As would be
expected, when chromic fluoride was added, the
Inconel showed attack to a depth of 4 mils and
some evidence of intergranular penetration. The
chromous ion has been demonstrated as the stable
state in the NcF-Zer-UF4 systems; therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that, when chromic
fluoride is the additive, chromium metal will be
removed from the Inconel to enable the chromium
to be reduced to the chromous state. Chemical
analyses made after these tests were inconclusive
and difficult to interpret.

- DEVELOPMENT OF NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM
BASE ALLOYS

The investigdtions under way for the evaluation
of nickel-molybdenum base alloys as structural
materials for circulating-fuel reactors include
attempts to improve the ductility and the fabrica-
bility of commercially available Hastelloy B through
purification, and efforts to find another suitable
and improved nickel-molybdenum base alloy that
has the strength and corrosion resistance of
Hastelloy B. Fabrication experiments are being
used to determine the effects of various treatments
on the materials developed,

Fabrication Experiments

H. Inouye J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division
One of the difficulties experienced in the fabri-
cation of Hastelloy B is due to the narrow range
of forgeability of the alloy — between 1950 and

'2100°F. The upper limit of forgeability is due to

impurities which cause grain-boundary melting.

“The low ductility at temperatures between 900 and

. 1800°F is less understood, but it is believed to be

" due to aging and impurity precipitation in grain

boundaries.

. to eliminate tfrace (tramp) elements by vacuum

.’___:'me[hng and the addition of elements to neutralize
" their effects.

Therefore efforts are being made

One of the most critical components of a circu-

-r‘rj"."‘rlqﬁng-'fuel reactor will be the fluoride-to-NaK

100

heat exchanger, for which, because of its com-
plexity and fragility, it will be highly desirable to
have seamless tubing. Commercially available
Hastelloy B tubing, which is now made by welding
strip, is not satisfactory because of cracks in the
weld, checks on the surface, and, in the dbse'nce
of severe working of the weld, nonuniform proper-
ties, Therefore several extrusion experiments have
been performed in an effort to produce seamless
tubing.

The initial extrusion experiments were attempts
to produce rod from air melts of Hastelloys B and
C. When extrusion temperatures above 2100°F
and up to 2350°F were used, the a”oys fractured
severely in all instances. For the subsequent
experiments, the extrusion temperature was lowered
to 2100°F, and a reduction ratio of 6.3:1 was
established. The results obtained for the various
materials are summarized in the following.

Vacuum-Melted, As-Cast Hastelloy B. The
ingot that was extruded had been homogeneized
at 2100°F for 48 hr. The front of the extrusion
fractured severely, but some improvement was
noted in comparison with the air melts previously
extruded,

Air-Melted, As-Cast Hastelloy B Plus 0.2% Ti
as Ti-Mn-Al-Ni Master Alloy. The ingot was

The exirusion fractured severely, and no improve-
ment in comparison with the vacuum melt was
noted.

Air-Melted, Commercial, Wrought Hastelloy B.
The extrusion fractured severely and thus indicated
that the cast structure was not responsible for
the poor hot forgeability of the alloy.

Air-Melted, Commercial, As-Cast Hastelloy C.
The extrusion was made through @ cascade die
(cone plus shear) to determine the effect of die
design. Thus far, the alloy has been extruded
through cone dies varying from 45 to 25 deg and
through a shear die. In all exfrusions, the rod
fractured severely. An extrusion was also made
by containing the billet in an Inconel can 0,063

thick disk at the nose of the biilet. The Inconel

' NlckeI-Molybdenum Blnury Alloys. In contrast
to the experiments with the Hastelloys, previous
extrusion experiments with vacuum melts of the
binary alloys in the cast condition showed marked
improvement in the quality and ease of fabrication.
The tendency to fracture was still apparent to a
slight degree and became progressively more
noticeable as the molybdenum content of the alloy
was increased from 20 to 24%. Two extrusions of
tube blanks of the 24% molybdenum alloy were
unsatisfactory for further reduction to small-diameter

tubing because of the large fractures and deep-

defects. 1t was found that the defects could be
eliminated by homogeneizing the cast billets for
48 hr at 2100°F, The minimum homogeneizing time
was not determined. The data obtained in the
extrusions of the nickel-molybdenum binary alloys
are presented in Table 7.1.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Since Hastelloy C could not be extruded with
any degree of success until it was canned
Inconel, it is concluded that lubrication is an
important factor in these experiments, At the
temperature of extrusion, although the alloy is
probably notmolten, the grainboundary is weakened
sufficiently by the friction of the flowing metal
against the die to cause fracture. By providing
a layer of Inconel between the die and the alloy,
as by canning, the friction on the alloy is removed.
The friction could also be reduced by increasing
the extrusion temperature, but, to increase the
extrusion temperature, it will be necessary to
eliminate the lowsmelting-point impurities from the
alloys. An alternative would be to reduce the
extrusion temperature and the extrusion ratios.

The following tentative conclusions have been
drawn: (1) Vacuum melting has little effect on the
extrudability of the alloys. (2) The extrudability
of the alloy does not depend on whether it is in
the wrought or the as-cast condition, (3) Homoge-
neizing has a beneficial effect, as evidenced by

alloys of the24% Mo~76% Ni composition. (4) Poor

New Alloys

H. Inouye J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division

Several new alloys arebeing studied in an attempt
to find an ulloy that is superior to Hastelloy B,

“and efforfs are ‘béing made to improve the existing

Hastelloys. Prelammary results of experiments

o ”:f.w:’rh aHoys of various compositions are presented
“in the following.

Hastelloy B Plus 0.03% Cerium. A 3-Ib vacuum
melt was rolled at 2100°F, and there was con-
siderably less cracking than would have been
found with Hastelloy B. Numerous small defects

. _were present, however, that may be eliminated by
- rincreasing the cerium content of the alloy.

" Molybdenum-Columbium-Nickel Alloy. A 20%
Mo—-5% Cb-75% Ni alloy could be cold rolled from
the cast structure to sheet, The structure is two-
phased at 1500°F and single-phased at a solution
annealing temperature of 1950°F. The tensile
strength of the alloy at 1500°F is 36,800 psi
(elongation 3.5%). A creep test at a temperature
of 1500°F and a stress of 8000 psi is in progress.

Molybdenum-Aluminum-Nickel Alloy. A 20%
Mo-2% Al-78% Ni alloy could be rolled at room
temperature from the cast condition. At 1500°F
the tensile strength was 43,500 psi with an elonga-
tion of 5%.

Molybdenum-Nickel Alloy, A 100-g arc melt of
a 24% Mo-76% Ni composition was hot rolled
60% at 2200°F, Following a I-hr anneal at 2100°F,
the alloy was cold rolled 72% without cracking.
The work hardening data for the alloy are listed

A 3-1b vacuum melt of this alloy has been rolled
to sheet and will be screened for strength and
ductility in creep and tensile tests. In addition,
an extrusion of the alloy has been rolled to sheet
for obtaining more detailed data,

A 100-g arc melt of a 32% Mo-68% Ni composition
was successfully hot rolled 60% at 2200°F, The
alloy was further cold rolled 72% without cracking.

A 3-lb vacuum melt of the alloy has been rolled
to 0.063-in. sheet and is being machined into
creep and tensile test specimens.

A 100-g arc melt of a 38% Mo~62% Ni compo-
sition was rolled 60% at 2200°F. The alloycracked
when cold rolled. In the annealed condition the
hardness of the alloy is 396 VPN, The micro-
structure of the cast alloy shows a considerable
quantity of eutectic, which appears to be similar
to that found in Hastelloy B.

The following additional arc-melted alloys were
evaluated:

Oxidation and Oxidation Protection

H. lnouye J. H. Coobs
Metollurgy Division

Temporary cychng tests from 1500°F to room
temperature in air have been performed on Hastelloy
B and other nickel-molybdenum base alloys to
determine the behavior to be expected in a NaK-to-
air heat exchanger such as will be required for
aircraftreactor application. The severest operating
condition that could exist would be a thermal
cycle from operating temperature (1500°F) to room
temperature under stresses caused by high-velocity
air.

The cycling tests of Hastelloy B were evaluated
by daily visual examination of the test piece which
had been through a heating cycle of 17 hr at 1500°F
and then coolingto room temperature in the furnace.
Weight changes were also measured daily. In
conjunction with these tests, identically prepared
specimens were tested at a constant temperature
of 1500°F, The results of these initial tests are
shown in Table 7.2 and in Fig. 7.1.

The results presented in Table 7.2 show that
the loss of metal from the Hastelloy B specimen
through oxide spalling was prevented by the use
of platings. in general, aluminum and aluminum
plus nickel are considered to be unsatisfactory
platings, however, because of spalling of the
protective coating.

Several other alloys have been tested for oxi-
dation at 1500°F for comparison with Hastelloy B
and to determine whether they need oxidation
protection during elevated-temperature mechanical

and corrosion tests. The results of the tests are

showp_ in Fig. 7.2.

 

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

At a constant elevated temperature in air, nickel-
molybdenum alloys of intermediate compositions
form a protective coating of NiMoO,. Upon cooling,
regardless of the rate, the coating will spall vigor-
ously at temperatures between 440 and 230°F.°
Experimental evidence shows that this spalling
may be due to a change in the crystalline structure
of the NiMoO, coating.

The stress-rupture properties of the nickel-
molybdenum base alloys are being studied in
fused salts, sodium, and various gases. Six new
lever arm machines are being used to testHastelloy
B sheet specimens, and eight additional tube
burst units have Hastelloy B pipe in test. |t is
anticipated that design curves for properties in
the fused salts at 1500 and 1650°F will be available
by February 1955. Data are also being obtained
for a design curve for properties in argon. The
results obtained in argon at 1500°F are presented

in Table 7.4.

As Table 7.4 indicates, Hastelloy B has sub-
stantially greater strength at 1500°F than Inconel,
which will rupture in 1200 hr when stressed to
3500 psi. A Hastelloy B specimen tested in hydro-
gen at 12,000 psi ruptured in 1300 hr; o similar
time to rupture was found in argon. Thus there is
an indication that Hastelloy B may not be sensitive
to a hydrogen atmosphere when tested in the so-
lution-annealed condition.

tubing is now being used in which the composite
billets are extruded.

A study of the flow of metals during an impact
extrusion is being made, For the study, the effect
of the shape of the nose of the extrusion billet
was determined on extrusions of Zircaloy canned in
copper and extrusions of vanadium canned in steel.
In addition, a two-ply and a three-ply billet of
stainless steel—carbon steel were extruded, but
the extrusions have not yet been evaluated.

The results of the tests show that large-grained
billets, such as cast billets, produce a rough
interface between the outer cladding and the core.
A tapered nose on the can and @ square edge on
the core result in a short section of can material
restricted to the front of the billet; thereafter, the
core has a thin layer of the canning material on
the surface. A square nose on the can and a
tapered core result in a thin section of core begin-
ning very soon after the front of the extrusion and
increasing in thicknesses toward the end of the
extrusion,

Boroh Carbide Shielding

Suitable compositions for the boron carbide
shield for the ART heat exchanger are being de-
veloped by The Carborundum Company and by the
Norton Company by using various nonmetallic
bonding materials, including BN, SiC, and carbon,
as well as those mentioned previously.® All these

in fabricating useful forms of B,C. Another pos-
sible source for fabrication of these shield pieces
is Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., which only

have developed a suitable composition by using
SiC as the bonding material. However, specific
details and samples of the material have yet to be
received,

Tubular Fuel Elements

Twelve fuel plates have been prepared for forming
into tubes, and eight more are being prepared.
These tubes are to be drawn at Superior Tube Co.
by the plug-drawing technique with low (10%)
reductions. Other techniques such as hot drawing

~or hot quging may be used.

Control Rods

Th:rty-five control rods are belng prepared for
the GE-ANP project. They were received as

-specially straightened tubes, 0.504 in. ID, 0.625
‘in, OD, 35 in. long, with one end plugged. The
tubes are b'e'ihgwfi“e'd with a mixture of 50% alumi-
~num powder and 50% B 4C, both supplied by the
“General Electric Company. The B,C is a special

grade containing 81% boron. The mixture is pre-
pared with 2% paraffin as a binder and is being
packed tightly into the tubes with a pneumatic
hammer. Very small increments are used to obtain
a high density. Twenty tubes have been filled
with average boron concentrations of about 0.8
g/cm3, that is, somewhat in excess of the 0.7
g/cm® required. After filling is completed, the

. tubes will be heated and evacuated to remove

the paraffin and then cold swaged to final size.

Al-UO, Elements for Shielding Expetiment

Fuel plates 28 in. long and 21/4 or 21/2 in, wide
are being prepared for an experiment to determine
the shielding necessary for delayed neutrons.
These plates are to be mounted on a belt and
rotated at speeds up to 22 fps. The fuel concen-
tration of 0.25 g/cm® required for these plates is

quife high compared with that usually specified

for fuel plates, and therefore new fabrication
problems must be resclved.
" Several plates have been fabricated by using

.UOZ and aluminum powder cores roll clad with

aluminum.  Three plates having 0.040-in. core

~ thickness wnh 62 wt % UOQ, had the required fuel

'concenfrahon Both Hhigh- flred and steam-oxidized

UO2 were used with good results. The edges of

 the core were quite clean and straight, and the

U0, was distributed fairly uniformly, as shown by

radiograph examination.  Because of the high

108

percentage of UG, it was necessary to hot roll
the plates with the covers on at all stages to
prevent oxidation. Plates with lower percentages
of UO, may be protected with thin aluminum foil
pressed on the core compact during cold pressing.

The finished plates, as<clad with 25 aluminum,
were judged to be too weak for the high stresses
involved in the rapid cycling. Several more ele-
ments are being assembled by using 52§ aluminum
as frame and cladding in the hope that work harden-
ing obtained in finish cold rolling will yield plates
of sufficient strength.

The resnsfance to oxidation of a number of high-
temperature brazing alloys when used in con-
junction with Inconel as a base material was
described in a previous report. This study has
been extended to include tests of several additional
brazing alloys. These tests have been conducted
in accordance with the experimental procedures
used in the previous studies. The results of
metallographic examination of inverted T-joint
specimens after exposure to static air at 1500°F
for periods of 200 and 500 hr are summarized in
Table 7.6, It appears that the majority of these
alloys are suitable for service within the limits of
this investigation. The periods of exposure cur-

rently being studied extend to 1000 hr. Tests are,

also being conducted at 1700°F in static air,

It is recognized that the test results obtained to
date may not be applicable except under isothermal
conditions. Therefore a duplicate set of experi-
ments will be conducted to determine the effect
of thermal cycling on the adherence of protective
oxide films. Included in these tests will be a
determination of the effect of the presence of water
vapor on the nature of the scale formation and the
resistance of this scale to spalling under con-
ditions characterized by temperature fluctuations.

Bery“aum oxide ceramics are being produced
probably for the first time, by casting from a slip
which is basic. For successful slip casting, a
well-deflocculated slip is necessary, and hitherto
this has been accomplished through the use of an
acid, usually HCl. "In comparison, a basically

deflocculated slip is more easily and rapidly

Although it is -

prepared, does not attack the plaster of paris
molds, is not unpleasant to the operator, and
requires very small amounts of deflocculants.
As an exdmple, tubes 4 in. long, 0.25 in. in outside
diameter, with a 0.04-in, wall, have been slip cast
recently from beryllium oxide and also from be-
ryllium oxide containing 16.2 wt % of natural
uranium oxide. These tubes are to be used for
tests by the Advanced Design Section of GE-ANP.
To 83.8 g of BeO (previously milled to about 24
average particle size) plus 16.2 wt % of UD, were
added about 26 ml of distilled water and 4 ml of a
2% solution of sodium pyrophosphate, After 5 min
of stirring, a creamy slip with a pH of 8 fo 9 was
obtained which spread evenly over a glass stirring
rod and flowed off the rod in a smooth stream.
Casting of the tubes required a two-piece plaster
mold with an opening 5 in. long to allow for
shrinkage and trimming to 4 in. and a diameter of
0.29 in. to allow for shrinkage on the diameter.
The deflocculated slip required about 10 to 15 sec
to form a tube of the proper wall thickness in this
mold. The excess slip was drained off, and, after
an additional 3 to 5 min in the mold, the tubes
released readily from the mold and had sufficient
green and dry strength to permit handling.

A firing operation of T hr at 1700°C in a hydrogen
or argon atmosphere is necessary to produce the
density of 3.0to 3.4 tequired. In order to determine
how warpage in firing may be avoided, some tubes
are being fired suspended in a furnace, while
others will be fired lying on their sides.

H F. F’oppendlek

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The heat transfer experimentation during the

- quarter included studies of ARE fuel in an Inconel
tube, the determination of performance character-

istics of an in-pile loop heat exchanger, studies of
velocny and temperature distributions for several

, "free—convechon volume-heat-source systems, and

prellmlnary determinations of fluid flow character-

“istics of a proposed ART core geomeiry. Several
" approximate mathematical temperature solutions for

forced-flow volume-heat-source entrance systems
were developed, and the question as to whether

‘electric currents which generate heat in the circu-

lating fluids of experimental volume-heat-source

“systems affect the fluid flow characteristics was
mveshga’red
- The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF ,-

UF4 (53-43-4 mole %) and LiF-KF- -UF, (48-48-4
mole %) were determined. The viscometry equip-
ment was modified for greater accuracy, and new
measurements were made for NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,. The
thermal conductivities of NaF-ZrF -UF4 and of
NaF-KF-LiF with and without UF, were measured.

FUSED SALT HEAT TRANSFER
 H. W. Hoffman J. Lones

"Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

" Preliminary heat transfer experiments have been
performed with the ARE fuel NaF-ZrF -UF , (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %) flowing in an Inconel tube. In
brief, the heat transfer system used consisted of
two small tanks (approximately /-ff capacity)
connected by an electrically heoted Y -in.-OD tube
with a length-to-diameter ratio of 43. Flow through
the heated section was produced by helium gas
pressure and controlled by an aqutomatic cycling

‘mechanism actuafed by the fluid level in the tanks.

The helium was purified by passage through a
NoK bubbler.

Operahon of the system was terminated after
]]5 hr in order to inspect the Inconel tube. The

‘average flmd temperatures during the period of

operation were 24 hr at 1200°F, 85 hr at 1300°F,

“and 6 hr ot 1400°F. Heat transfer measurements,

made in the heated section over the Reynolds

‘modulus range of 5,600 to 10,000, yielded results
‘which were 24% below the generally accepted

nmo

correlation for ordinary fluids. The p.recision of

the measurements was approximately 10%. Visual
examination of the test section after removal from
the system showed no apparent film. Samples of
the tube have been submitted for metallographic
examination. It is recalled that in the case of the
previous experiments for molten NaF-KF-LiF
flowing in Inconel tubes, 55% reductions in heat
transfer were measured and corrosion deposits
were found on the tube walls.

About 15 individual heat transfer measurements
were made between 24 and 115 hr of operation of
the NaF-ZrF,-UF -Inconel system. During this
period no reductions of the heat transfer coef-
ficients with time were observed. A new lnconel
test section is currently being installed for ob-
taining measurements in the period between 0 and

24 hr.,

The heat exchanger for the LITR fluoride fuel
loop was constructed in an unusual geometry to
fit in the limited space available in a beam hole.
In order to determine the operating characteristics
of this exchanger, an experimental investigation
of its fluid flow and heat transfer performance was
conducted. The heat exchanger for the loop is
formed with helical fins brazed around a section
of straight pipe. The fins are enclosed in a
closely fitting tube and form an annulus in which
air flows in a helical path. Molten salt passes
through the center tube.

A duplicate of the actual exchanger to be used
in the loop was connected to an air supply so that
air passed through the annulus just as it would
in in-pile operation. However, instead of a fused

salt, dry steam was admitted to the center tube
as the hot fluid. The air flow rate and inlet and

outlet temperatures were measured, as were the

steam pressure and the condensate rate. From this

however, more limited objectives than before. In

the beginning of the ORNL-ANP effort, there was

‘no information on free convection in fluids with

volume heat sources. Since the temperature struc-
ture in the fuel pins of the first fused salt aircraft
reactor experiment could not be readily predicted
because of a lack of knowledge about the free-
convection heat transfer in such a system, a
free-convection research program was initiated.
The principal objective was to determine both
theoretically and experimentally the temperature
and velocity structure in a free-convection flat-
plate system and, from these data, to discover
basic postulates that would permit analytical pre-
diction of different systems which might be of
interest in future fuel element designs. This
project was well under way when the change to
the present circulating-fuel reactor design was
made. At that time the effort was greatly reduced,
and later this research was temporarily abandoned

" in favor of more pressing problems. A series of

memorandums summarizing the theoretical work
which had been accomplished were prepared.
Also, some preliminary experimental velocity
measurements in a flat-plate apparatus were ob-
tained. _

In the intervening years there has been a con-
tinued interest in the temperature structure in
fluids with volume heat sources that are losing
heat by free convection in applications such as

- dump tanks for liquid fuel reactors, radiation

damage capsules, and pins containing liquid fuel.
The repeated queries on this subject prompted
the decision to reactivate the research, but on a
less ambitious basis than before. Hence, a report’

One of the considerations in the selection of a
qoo]anf for a nuclear reactor or any heat exchange
system is the amount of flow work required for
removal of a unit of heat. This quantity, which
is referred to as the ‘‘cooling work modulus,”
varies with the geometry of the system, the fluid
velocity (and flow regime), and the properties of
the fluid.

A menid_rqrjdurh is being prepared that gives the
development of equations for calculation of the
cooling work modulus for turbulent flow. Curves
which simplify computation are provided, and the
results of a study of a specific reactor are pre-
sented for illustration. This study has been
performed for an idealized reactor coolant system
which is considered to be somewhat representative
of actual solid-fuel-element reactors. In this
unalys:s the cooling work modulus is related to
the reactor geometry, the heat removal rate, the
thermal properhes of the coolant, and certain
coolant temperature differences which are de-
-'rermmed by such factors as mean coolant temper-
'afure, coo[qn’r melting and boiling temperatures,
'V_fube wall corrosmn and mass transfer, and thermal
siresses.

e All the i‘hermal properties of a coolant are found
to mfluence its effechveness in transferring heat
'~ from fhe reactor. An ideal coolant is indicated

“to be one that has high thermal conductivity, heat

14

capacity, and density and a low viscosity, but the
relative merits of actual fluids depend strongly
on the temperature differences which are taken
as limiting in the system.

ART CORE HYDRODYNAMICS

The experimental flow sysfem for studymg the
hydrodynamic characteristics of proposed ART
cores was completed, and several photographs of
particles and grids were made which yielded much
information about the apparatus but no quantitative
data. Some qualitative evidence for the existence
of two, and possibly three, regions of flow sepa-
ration in the ART core currently being tested
was obtained by visual observation. Additional
qualitative observations are continuing which are
soon to be supplemented with quantitative dataq,
but these preliminary observations indicate that
the core with ideal entrance conditions must be
considered to be unacceptable and that it will
be necessary to use vanes at the entrance.

It was found that sufficient light is available
to produce photographs of particles flowing with
the water at a Reynolds number of 100,000, al-
though at such high velocities the flash duration
is a little long. It is believed that this can be
remedied with a different flash tube, which is
being procured. In addition, these first photo-
graphs revealed the need for an additional light
source arranged to illuminate the particles con-
tinuously so that their tracks would represent a

line on the photograph. This is necessary to

reduce the uncertainty associated with identifying
the two images of each particle. A 1000-w incan-
descent projection bulb proved to be inadequate,
and arrangements are being made to test two
different mercury-vapor light sources; they will
increase the light intensity by a factor of 10 to
20, which should resolve the illumination problem.

Several details such as the quality of the grid
photographs, the settling velocity of the particles,
and the reliability of the Hewlett & Packard Co.
electric counter have received at’ren‘rlon. A new
grid was made with much finer, shallower lines
than the first. The photographs of the new grid
were far superior to those of the old one, since

a much smaller area was obscured by the grid
lines themselves. Inherent difficulties have beset
attempts to measure the settling velocity of the
particles; however, it can be said that the terminal
velocity of free fall of Lycopodium spores in water
under gravity is certainly less than 0.2 cm/sec
and probably much less. Even this is only about
0.16% of the mean velocity which will be measured,
The Hewlett-Packard counter which measures the
time interval between flashes was adjusted; its
absolute accuracy was checked; and it was found
to be satisfactory. '

The design of another entrance section which
will |mpcrt a rotational component of velocity to
the fluid as it flows through the test section has
been started. This will produce a velocity struc-
ture which is more realistic in terms of what is
envisaged for the ART, but it is much more
difficult to measure. It is conceivable that a
rotational compbhen‘f will help to réduce the
'possﬂ)le adverse thermal effect of separation
regions, perhaps by eliminating these regions.

. The velocity distribution in a diverging channel
under turbulent flow conditions was studied with
the phosphore$centéparfic|e technique.  Flow
asymmetry at a half-angle of 4 deg was observed.
This angle is somewhat less than the 5-deg half-
angle given in the classical report on velocity
profiles in channels by Nikuradse.? A large flow-
visualization system that utilizes the phospho-
rescent particle and dye techniques for studying
fluid flow characteristics has nearly been com-
pleted. -

volume heat sources within the fluids of experi-
mental forced-flow volume-heat-source systems.

An experimental study of the factors affecting
gas formation at an electrode-electrolyte interface
was carried out pursuant to the problem cf gener-
ating volume heat sources electrically. The
generation of gas at an electrode was found to
be dependent upon the material of the electrode
and the current density and independent of the
applied potential, as well as the type of electro-
lyte employed. Platinum was found to have the
most desirable characteristic of conducting the
maximum amount of current per unit area of elec-
trode to an electrolyte for a given degree of gas
generation.  This effect is most probably the
result of an increased surface area because of
the known porosity of this metal. For brightly
polished platinum, a current density of approxi-
mately 8 amp/in.? was achieved before gas liber-
ation was noticeable. This value exceeded that
of Carpenter 20 stainless steel by two orders of
magnitude. Also, tests were carried out to study
the compatibility of the more common stainless
steels and dilute solutions of strong electrolytes
in those portions of an experimental volume-heat-
source system where no electric currents are
flowing. Carpenter 20, type 347, ond type 316
stainless steels were found to be accordant.

Concomitant with the problem of generotmg
uniform volume heat sources within annuli of
nonuniform cross section, a method for embedding
platinum electrodes to form a hydrodynamically
smooth surface has been developed. It has been
established that several of the new epoxy bonding

..~ plastics adhere to suitably roughened metals in

such a manner that the casting of ‘composite

result is due to improved fluoride preparation and
handling techniques, as well as to the refined

viscometry methods.

9. RADIATION DAMAGE

J. B. Trice
Solid State Division

Ac Jo Mi”ef
ANP Project

- The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel

capsules containing fluoride fuels has continued,
and the capsules examined thus far have revealed
no evidence of radiation damage. The horizontal
type of fuel-circulating loop designed for irradiation
in the LITR has been operated out-of-pile with a
non-uranium-bearing salt and is now being inserted
in the HB-2 facility of the LITR, A small loop suit-
able for vertical operation in the LITR lattice has
also been successfully bench tested, and a second
mode] for in-pile operation is being constructed.

The creep test apparatus for testing Inconel at
high temperatures in the MTR is being bench
tested. The stress-corrosion apparatus for LITR
“operation has been successfully bench tested, and
an in-pile apparatus is being constructed,

Remote metallographic studies of solid fuel
elements were continued, and additional information
on the relationship between UO, particle size and
radiation damage was obtained.

MTR STATIC CORROSION TESTS

W. E. Browning G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

Ha Lr Hemphi”
Analytical Chemistry Division

The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel
capsules containing fused fluoride fuels has been
continued. Additional irradiations were carried out
on capsules containing NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (48.9-49.3-
1.79 mole %) and on capsules containing NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (50.1-48.2-1.74 mole %) These fuels
generate 1100 w/cm® in the A-38 position in the
MTR. To date, five capsules in this series, three
with UF, and two with UF, fuels, have been
" successfully irradiated for a two-week period with
metal-liquid interface temperatures of 1500 £ 50°F,
The capsules have been examined metallographi-
cally, and the fuels have been chemically analyzed.
One out-of-pile electrically heated control capsule
containing UF, and one containing UF, have also
been examined, and the fuel batches have been
chemically analyzed.

120

The irradiated UF3-bearing CO.pSUIé‘.S and one of

the irradiated UF ; capsules showed practically no
corrosion — that is, they were similar to the control
capsules — while one irradiated UF ,-bearing cap-
sule, previously reported,! had subsurface voids
to a depth of 2 mils. There were no significant dif-
ferences in the iron, chromium, or nickel contents
of the irradiated fuels, as compared with the starting
fuel batches, and there was no evidence of segrega-
tion of either uranium or impurities. The chemical
analyses of the two out-of-pile controls that have
been examined to date were accidentally spoiled,
The uranium in the UF -bearing fuel analyzed not
less than 96% ,UF3, and the UF4-beuring fuel

showed no trivalent vranium. In an attempt to de-

tect any minute radiation effects which might be
occurring, the irradiation period is being extended
to six weeks for the other capsules in this series,
Additional examinations were made of capsules
containing NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) that
had been irradiated at a nominal temperature of
1620°F and had generated 2700 w/cm®. In this
series of irradiations, the in-pile temperature
history was quite complex. No evidence of chemi-
cal damage could be found in the fuel, and there
were no high concentrations of Inconel components.

There was some corrosion evident, and therefore

out-of-pile control tests will be made in which the
in-pile temperature patterns will be duplicated
insofar as possible. New experiments with this
fuel are to be made in which more closely controlied
temperatures and planned temperature excursions
will be used,

The chemical analyses of samples of fuel taken
from irradiated Inconel capsules have at times
shown increases in iron such that the iron-to-
chromium ratio was greater than that found in the
Inconel, and therefore a series of radioactivation
analyses of the iron content in the irradiated fuel
was made; these analyses demonstrated that the
high 'values were due to contamination of the fuel

with unirradiated iron that had entered the fuel
during or after opening of the Inconel capsule. The
techniques developed by G. Smith (Analytical
Chemistry Division) are particularly adaptable to
the separation of minute amounts of iron (10 to 100
pg) from very large amounts of fission products.
Four samples of fuel from irradiated capsules
showed that between 70 and 99% of the iron came
from an unirradiated source, whereas samples from
an irradiated Inconel copsule showed that less than
6% of its iron content was not radioactive, Since
the amount of iron contamination involved is very
small (of the order of 50 ug), some possible sources
of contamination would include the steel drill used
to remove the fuel from the capsules and also the
lmpurlhes in the reagenfs used in preparing sample
solutions. In the future, samples will be obtained
by using a nonferrous drill. Unfortunately, radio-
activation techniques cannot be applied to analyses
for chromium and ‘nickel because of unfavorable
activation yields, insensitivity of detection, and
chemical separation difficulties associated with

trace amounts of 'rhese elements.

An improved and modified version of the capsule
irradiation facility is being put into service (Fig.
9.1). Before being shipped from ORNL, each
capsule is mounted in a sleeve which provides a
sufficiently large annulus for the passage of cooling
air between it and the capsule. The bottom of the

sleeve is tapered to fit an inside taper at the
bottom of the air tube in the MTR. The advantage
of this arrangement is that the capsule can be
fitted to the sleeve prior to insertion into the
reactor, Several tubes and capsules prepared with
this new arrangement have been used satisfactorily
in the MTR. In order to speed up the capsule
program, arrangements have been made for irradiating
two capsules simultaneously in separate, but
adjacent, facilities in the MTR.

An improved set of temperature controls fabricated
by the Instrumentation and Controls Division has
been subjected to dynamic performance fests by
using an electrically heated capsule. These tests
have shown that the new controls will maintain a
more constant temperature in the capsule during
irradiation,

' - MIN}ATUR‘E IN-PILE LOOP
"~ Bench Test

W, R.'Willi_s M. F. Osborne
H. E. Robertson G. W, Keitholtz
v Sd‘lird___State Division

The first successful bench test of the miniature
in-pile loop designed for insertion in a vertical
__hole in the LITR included four freezing and melting
cycles in 260 hr of operation. The loop was oper-
ated at 1466°F, The linear velocity of the fused
salt circulated in the loop was between 3.3 fps
(as calculated from the flowmeter) and 3.8 fps (as
calculated from the pump speed); thus a Reynolds
number of about 3000 was obtained, Since it was
possible to freeze and melt the fused salt without
causing failure of the loop, it may be advisable to
fill the in-pile loop before it is inserted in the
reactor and then melt the fuel mixture after the
loop is in position. Since, during the bench test,
the flowmeter was found to be temperature sensitive,
the dependence of the measurement on the temper-
ature must be established.’

The bench test was terminated because of a leak
in a collar that was welded over a joint in the fuel
tube. The two ends of the loop did not butt together

“at this location, and the annular space thus formed
between the collar and the tube sections trapped
the fused salt in such a manner that expansion of
the salt caused the collar (not the weld) to rupture.

“The metal collar stretched from 0.4 in, in diameter

to 0.5 in. before it ruptured. The salt from the
" leak, which existed during operation for about 4
“hr, showed a tendency to oxidize and to stick to

- the Inconel surface rather than to flow rapidly down
~‘the outside tube wall. Thus, a leak in the colder
_portion of a loop that was operating in-pile would

~“ " probably not flow downward into the high-flux

region before a safety alarm from the released
“radioactivity could scram the reactor,

A Delco motor from the group being used in bench
tests has been rebuilt to withstand radiation and
a higher temperature, The wire on both the rotor
and the stator was replaced with glass-insulated
wire. All paper was removed, and mica was used
in the commutator and in the rotor segments; glass
cloth was used, where possible, for other insula-
tion. These changes required that the shaft as-
sembly be slightly modified to allow more space
for windings. The rebuilt motor was tested during

the bench test of the miniature loop, and it was found

to be satisfactory. In a comparison of the operation
of the rebuilt motor with that of the original motor
under no load and under load cond i-fio'ns,' the rebuilt
motor was found to be slightly more efficient than
the original motor. Furthermore, since the rebuilt
motor can withstand a higher ambient temperature
and since for a given voltage it produces a higher
speed, higher fuel velocities can be obtained than
were possible previously,

Heat Transfer Calculations

An extensive series of heat transfer calculations
has been carried out on the ORNL. Reactor Controls
Computer in order to predict the thermal behavior
of a miniature in-pile circulating-fuel loop. The
derivations of appropriate differential equations
and the details of their solution are given in a
forthcoming report,? The model finally adopted for
the calculations and for the in-pile loop is shown in
Fig. 9.2. It was assumed to be mounted in position
C-48 of the LITR, with the lower end at the location
of maximum thermal-neutron flux.® The maximum
power density in the fuel in position C-48 was
assumed to be 540 w/cm?3.

The computer results were obtained for a variety

of different flow rates of fuel (NaF-ZrF -UF,,

53.5-40-6.5 mole %) and of cooling air expressed

REMOVAL OF Xe 133 FROM
MOLTEN FLUORIDE FUELS

M. T. Robinson
Solid State Division

W. A. Brooksbank
Analytical Chemistry Division

D. E. Guss
USAF

The study, described previously,? for determining
whether Xe‘]35 would escape from ART-type purging
equipment rapidly enough to prevent serious poi-
soning was continued., It was realized at the time
this study was initiated that the ARE might answer
the question satisfactorily, but it was decided to
go ahead with experiments to measure the xenon
solubility under the more pertinent ART conditions.
It was considered unlikely that 97% of the equi-
librium xenon would be removed from the ARE with-
out special purging equipment, and, yet, this is
what happened according to two independent sets
of calculations. During the initial stages of
reactor operation, data were obtained from a re-
activity calibration of the ARE regulating rod by
noting changes in rod position required to maintain
criticality as increments of U235 were added to the
fuel. The value of the rod was calculated to be
0.030 +0.006% Ak/in., which agrees well with the
preliminary value reported by J. L, Meem (cf. Sec.
1, “‘Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment’’).

When the ARE was operated for 25 hr at an esti-
mated 2 Mw, constant power was maintained by
adjustment of the regulating rod. At the end of
this period of operation, the rod had been withdrawn
an amount equivalent to a reactivity decrease of
0.015 £ 0.003%. The expected decrease in reachvnfy
was calculated to be:

From burnup of U%33 0.001%
From Sm'4? poisoning 0.008%
From Xe'35 poisoning 0.41%

Since over one-half the observed change in reactiv-
ity may be accounted for by burnup and Sm'4?
poisoning, the amount of Xe!3® retained in the fuel
was less than 1 to 2% of the amount expected.

The lsotope Ze?®

Thérefo're, the ARE supplied evidence that the
rare gases escape readily from the fluoride fuels
under dynamic conditions. Since the amount of
xenon present in a circulating-fuel reactor is prob-
ably more than the amount produced in one complete
fuel cycle (50 sec in the ARE), the amount remain-
ing in the fuel will be measured by using an ARE
fuel sample for radiochemical comparison of the
concentration of the fission products (Sr8?, Cs'37,
and Ce'4') which come through rare-gas precursors
with those (Cs'®% and Zr?) which do not.

The gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer to be
used for the experiments has been calibrated with
Cs'37, Na?2, and Hg?%3, and the equipment has
been tested with radicactive noble gases taken
from samples of off-gas from the iodine dissolver
used by the Radicisotopes Department of the
Operations Division. The gases used were pri-
marily Xe'33 and Xe'33, In order to prevent the
gamma rays from other short-lived nuclides from
competing unfavorably with those from Xe'3% and
thus making resolution of the Xe!33 isotope diffi-
cult, a charcoal adsorption column (0.190 in, in
diameter and 0.5 in. long) for delaying isotopes
such as fhose of krypton was tested at room temper-
ature by using Kr®3 and the gamma-ray spectrometer.
[t was found that the charcoal trap would delay
krypton 'isofope's'fo'r about 10 min {(at a flow rate
of about 15 cm3/min) and xenon isotopes for about
200 min, Thus the specfrometer would measure
only long-lived 1so‘ropes such as Xe!33,

Fission products may be lost from ARE- fype fuel

precursors; by interaction of the fission product or

of one of VlfS precursors ‘with the contdlner wall
through c emlccl reachon, for example, B

by any of these means, since it will be ‘‘carried”’

in the fuel and since it has no known rare-gas
precursor (if Kr?® exists, it probably has a very
short half life, say 1 or 2 sec). This isotope will
be used therefore as the basis for normalizing the
yields of the other radicisotopes to be studied,

Volatility of the rare gases will be examined by
studying the yields of S5r%% and of Cs'37 which
come through 2.6-min Kr®% and 3.0-min Xe'37,
respectively, Low yields for these two isotopes
would indicate high volatilities for their parents,
Kr8? and Xe 37, A further check of the experiments
will be made by using Ce'#!, a descendant of
3-sec Xe'4?}, which should be retained in the fuel,
and Cs'3¢, a shielded nuclide formed directly in
fission. Comparison of Zr?> with Cs'3% and Ce'4]
will give a measure of the loss of the important
alkali and rare-earth elements through adsorption
on metal surfaces, since Cs'3¢ and rare-earth
elements will be present only in trace quantities

uo, particle size was less than 3y for one capsule,
and it was between 15 and 44y for the other. The
capsules were irradiated at a temperature of about
500°F, and the total burnup for each capsule was
29%. Comparison of the results from the element

with 3-u particle size and the element with 15- to
44-u particle size showed that irradiation induced
greater final hardness in the elements with the
smaller-pdrticle-size material (Figs. 9.5 and 9.6).
Four samples from the smaller-particle-size elements
showed cracking of the core without bending.
Since cracking did not occur in elements with
lower total burnups, it appears that the increased
burnup (29%), together with the small particle size,
can cause cracking of the core, as illustrated in

which exceed 500 ug of uranium.

The second test of the isotopic dilution method
verified the concentration of the standard solutions,
the accuracy of the spiking, and the reliability of
the mass spectrometer. Known mixturés of normal
and enriched uranium solutions were examined in
the mass spectrometer, and the results were com-
pared with the expected U233 concentrations. The
greatest difference between calculated percentages
and measured percentages was only 0.65%, and the
average difference was 0. 37%. |

The results of these studies show that the
isotopic dilution method is reliable and that good
results can be obtained under the conditions which

have been used for ARE-type fuel analyses. The

method of determining burnup based on measure-
ments of the U236 grown in is less subject to error
from sample contamination than is the method
based on measurements of U%38 and is therefore
considered to give the more reliable data.

The volumes of gas derived from reactions 1 and

each mole of UH, decomposed when the ignition
is carried out at temperatures between 500 and
600°C, and 0.5 mole of CO is formed per mole of
UF, under similar conditions. The CO must be
removed from the effluent gases before the meas-
urement of hydrogen is made. This is accomplished
by passing the gases through a tube packed with
] O and powdered pumice, which is maintained at
a temperoture of 150°C. The CO is oxidized to
CO, in the following reaction:

When the method was testedby analyzing samples
of pure uranium metal, the hydrogen evolved
corresponded to 97% of the theoretical value with
a coefficient of variation of 2%. Satisfactory
precision has also been obtained for the deter-
mination of U° in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels and in

not been measured experimentally, but, on the
basis of the quantities measured, concentrations of

chloride, TiCl,, and methylene blue, C, ¢HygN5SCHL
Of these reagents, methylene blue appears to be
the most promising reagent for a possible routine
method for the determination.

Cupric Chloride (CuCl,). Previous attempts to
oxidize UF; by Cu(ll) in H,SO, solution were un-
successful. Since the formal oxidation potential of

the [Cu(H),Cu(l})] couple is increased in solutions

of high chloride concentration, experiments were

performed to ascertain whether quantitative oxida-
fion of trivalent uranium could be achieved by

~ adjusting the acidity and chloride concentration of

the CuCl, solvent solution.

j Sainples of UF, were dissolved under an atmos-
here of CO in acidic solutions of NaCl which
confcmed a mecsured excess of a standard solu-
tion of CUC| Affer dissolution of the samples,
the unreduced CuCl, was determined iodometrically
and 1rhe trlvalent urcmlum was calculated on the
bc15|s of the stmchlometry of the equation

Cu2* 1 U3t —> Cut + U4t

‘When the dissolution was carried out in a solu-

tion 1 M in HCl and 2 M in NaCl, the results were
in agreement with those obtained by the hydrogen
evolution method.?2 Lower values were obtained
when either the chloride concentration or the
acidity was altered.

Samples of UF3 which had been fused with NaF-
KF-LiF evolved hydrogen and subsequently
yielded low results when analyzed by the above-
described procedure. The method therefore appears
to be of limited applicability.

Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl,). It was found that
UF, dissolved without evolution of hydrogen in
solutions of TiCl, in concentrated HCl to yield
dark-brown solutions of TiCl.. The color of these

‘solutions, when diluted, reverts to the rose tint

usually associated with Ti(lll) solution. When
these diluted solutions are titrated with a standard

~solution of K,Cr,0,, the equivalents which are
_consumed at the first sharp change in potential

correspond to about 95% of the trivalent uranium
as determined by the hydrogen evolution method.
If the solutions are then heated to a temperature

" of 90°C, the total uranium can be determined by
'ox1d|zmg U(lY) to U(VI) with furfher addition of

'rhe dlchromcn‘e soluhon.

While this is the only method which has been
found to give a titration for trivalent uranium
without subsequent back-titration of excess
oxidant, it is not readily adaptable to routine
analysis because of the slow equilibrium of the
electrode potentials and the rapid oxidation of
titanous solution by air after the dilution of the
concentrated acid solutions. Experiments are now
being conducted to determine whether the TiCl,
can be titrated in the concentrated acid with
bromine which is generated coulometrically.

End points obtained potentiometrically in the
concentrated solutions were found to be poorly
defined, but sharp breaks with potential changes
of about 400 mv were obtained: with polarized
platinum electrodes. Titrations between 5 and
10% in excess of the theoretical value were
obtained when UF, samples were titrated cou-
lometrically. This excess titration is probably a
result of diffusion of TiCl, from the cathode com-
partment. ‘

Methylene Blue. A proposed method based on
the oxidation of trivalent uranium to the tetravalent
state by methylene blue was developed for the
determination of UF, in a fluoride fuel. In the
proposed procedure, the sample is dissolved in @
measured volume of 0.02 N methylene blue solution
in 3 to 6 N HCl| under an atmosphere of CO, by
stirring for 2 hr at room temperature., The excess
methylene blue is then titrated to its reduced
state, methylene white, with 0.05 N chromous
sulfate solution. The equations involved in the
determination are as follows:

2U3* + methylene blue + 2HY — 204"

+ methylene white

2Cr?* + methylene blue + 2H"—> 2Cr3%
+ methylene white

Because of the intense color of the dye, the
visual end point, blue to green, is sharp and re-
producible even when the titrations are carried out
with 0.025 N chromous sulfate.

For the determination of trivalent uranium in
UF,, the coefficient of variation is approximately
1%, and the results are in excellent agreement with
those obtained by the hydrogen evolution method.?
While somewhat poorer precision was obtained in
the analyses of NaF-LiF-KF-UF,.-UF, samples,
the variations were probably a result of hetero-
geneous sampling, as is also indicated by the

lrreprodumb:llty of determinations by the hydrogen

evolution method. In the ona[yses of some of the

NaZrF .-UF samples, low results were obtained
becouse fhe samples were not completefy dissolved
in 6 N HCI.

~ The methylene blue procedure requires less
operational time than the hydrogen evolution
method, and, for the samples which have been

‘tested, it appears to give results of comparable

precision and accuracy. Tests are being conducted
to determine the extent of the reactions between
methylene blue and uranium hydride, uranium
metal, and other metalllc contaminants of the
fluoride samp]es.

‘In order to carry out subsequent determinations
of the total uranium concentration on the same
samples, the final soluhons from the methylene

_‘blue determlnotlon were titrated with oxidizing

agents. Titrations with Ce(lV) and Fe(!H) solu-
tions did not yield stoichiometric end points.
Al_'t»ht_:ug'h'kfhe reaction with K_Cr 07'v'vds'exfreme|y
slow, two well-defined potentiometric end points
were obtained when the solutions were titrated
slowly. The second of these end points corre-
sponded to the reoxidation of methylene white to
methylene blue plus the oxidation of the U(IV) to
U(V!). The stoichiometry of the first break in the

“potential curve has not yet been accurately de-

fined, but it appears to be consistent with the
oxidation of U(IV) to U(V). Further investigation
is under way to elucidate the nature of these
changes in potential.

is used, a concentration of 1% water corresponds
to 235 mg of oxygen. From the above linear
relation the calibration curve can be extended to
concentration ranges too low for direct measure-
ment by weighed primary standards.

At the temperatures at which liquid HF could be
safely maintained in the reaction vessel, the rate
of the reaction between metallic oxides such as
uo, and HF was found to be too slow for applica-
’rlon to analytical measurements, The oxides were
found to react rapidly with fused KHF, according
to the postulated reaction

4KHF , + U0, —> UF,, + 4KF + 2H,0

The procedure has been modified accordingly to
carry out the dissolution of the sample in molten
KHF .

In the revised procedure, the sample is mixed
with about five times its weight of anhydrous
potassium fluoride, KF, in a platinum crucible,
The crucible is then placed in the reaction vessel
and the KF is converted to the acid salt by trans-
ferring a portion of the HF acid from the conduc-
tivity cell to the reaction vessel. After the excess
HF has been returned to the cell, the KHF
fused by heating the reaction vessel to about
300°C., The water is then transferred to the con-
ductivity cell for measurement by repeated distilla-
tions with portions of HF.

Because part of the KF was carried over to the
cell during the distillation, the original apparatus
was modified by placing a silver-lined vessel,
which is similar in design to a Kjeldahl trap,
dlrec’riy above the reaction vessel. The revised
~ procedure is now being tested on pure samples of

presence of sulfur. A colorimetric method? was
adapted to determine the concentration of sulfur
quantitatively. In this method, sulfur is released
from solution as H ,5 by acidification with HCL.
The gas is cdsorbed in a solution of zinc acetate
solution, and, upon the further addition of ferric

'dm'moriium'Sulfate, a reaction occurs between

the organic reagent and sulfur to form methylene

blue, an intensely colored dye. The absorbancy

of the soluflon of methylene blue is measured with

a phofomefer' at 670 my. The method is extremely
'4sensmve _wnh a workable range of from 5 to 50 pug
per 100 ml of solution. This range corresponds fo

a practical lower limit of determination of about

1 part of sulfur per million parts of sodium.
Analyses of the sodium revealed that the sulfur

was not unn‘orm]y distributed. In particular spots,

the concenfrcmon was of the order of 0.1 to 1% or

higher. The sulfur content of the sodium sampled
from the bulk of the trap was, however, much lower,
50 to 100 ppm, and that of the sodium in the system
was less than 1 ppm. These results indicate that
sulfur in sodium precipitates rapidly as sodium
sulfide and can be effectively trapped and removed
from the system. The solubility of sodium sulfide
in sodium is evidently extremely small.

Sulfur in Flubride Salt Mixtures, The presence
of sulfur in mixtures of fluoride salts which are
being considered as proposed reactor fuels is con-
sidered deleterious, principally from the standpoint

of corrosion. The major problem in determining

sulfur in fluorides is that sulfur exists in at least

two oxidation states, sulfaie and sulfide, and, in
order to adapt the methylene blue colorimetric
method, the sulfate must be reduced to the sulfide.
The reducing mixture recommended by Johnson
and Nishita® for sulfate in soils is used for this
purpose. About 1 g of the fluoride mix is heated
at the boiling point with 4 ml of a reducing mixture
composed of 15 g of red phosphorus, 100 ml of
hydriodic acid, and 75 ml of formic acid. Reduction
of the sulfate is complete within 30 min, and
then the colorimetric method can be utilized. When

“sulfur is found in fluoride mixtures, the principal
| portion of the sulfur is in the form of sulfate rather
| than su|f|de as mlgh'r be expected

Sulfur in HZ-H‘F Gas Streams. The odor of HéS '

has often been noted in gas streams in the fuel
production work. Two sources of this sulfur are
known: sulfate contaminant in fluoride salts and
fluorosulfonic acid, HSO,F, in hydrogen fluoride.
Sulfur from the first source is known to be of the
order of a few parts per million. A test of the
sulfur content of hydrogen fluoride was made by
dissolving the gas in a solution of NaOH, deter-
mining sulfur in the solution by boiling the basic
solution in the presence of H,0,, and precipitating
the sulfate as BaSO, with BaCl,. The sulfur

concentration was 2.7 mg per liter of HF,

A semiquantitative method for determining sulfur
as sulfide in off-gas from fuel production was set
up in which the gas was passed through a 6%
solution of NaOH. An equal volume of bismuth
nitrate in glacial acetic acid was added to the
scrub solution, and the turbidity, as a result of
formation of Bi,S,, was compared with previously
prepared standards. The procedure was made more
precise by measuring the absorbancy of the turbid
solution at 350 my in a 7.5-cm cell with a total

volume equal to the volume of the test solution. -

The concentration of sulfur found by this pro-
cedure ranged from 2 to 35 pug per liter of off-gas.

Analytical Chemistry Division

Investigation was continued on the feasibility of
a spectrophotometric titration of fluoride based on
the decolorization of a zirconium complex or lake,
Zirconium alizarin sulfonate and zirconium Erio
Chrome cyanine were tested as possible titrants.
A titration cell based on the design of Sweetser
and Bricker® was fabricated so that the Beckman
Model DU spectrophotometer couldbe usedto meas-
ure absorbancy. Although the data have not yet
been thoroughly evaluated, the technique does not
appear to be feasible for application to NaF-KF-
LiF-base fuels because of the slowness with

which equilibrium is reached. The procedure will

be evaluated before further work is done.

PETROGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS OF

Petrographic examinations were made of several
hundred samples of fluoride melts. The majority of
the samples were from alkali fluoride systems con-
taining UF ., |

When small amounts of UF, (<20 mole %) are
melted with NaF- KF- LiF, KF-NaF, or KF, a red

compound is formed which is thought to be K UF,.

In melts which contain only KF and UF,, this com-
pound is isotropic. However, in the ’rwo with NaF
present, the compound exhibits slight anisotropism.
This is thought to be due to a slight solubility of
NaF in the K sUF (.

of inception of this procedure, more uniform re-
sults have been obtained. :

fn addition, a change has been made in the
method of determining uranium in samples received

by the zinc reduction, ceric sulfate titration
method. The present method? is that based on the

A plant for recovering (in seven batches) the
_uranium from the ARE fuel and rinse by the fluoride-
volatility process is being designed, and con-

~ struction is scheduled for completion by December

31, 1955, It is estimated that the amount of ma-
terial tobe processed will be 12.4 i3 of NaF-ZrF ,-
UF , containing 65 kg of uranium, This plant will
‘demonstrate, on a pilot-plant scale, the feasibility
-of the fluoride-volatility process as applied to the

_ processing of the fuel from a circulating-fuel
- aircraft reactor. The feasibility of this process

(Fig. 11.1) has been established on a laboratory
scale.’*? The basic equipment as now envisioned
will consist of a fluorinator, an absorption column
packed with NaF, a cold-trap system, and a fluorine
disposal unit,

The fluoride-volatility process can be adapted
for recycling uranium to a fresh fuel concentrate
by adding a UF, reduction step and dissolving

the resulting partially decontaminated UFA in
NaF-ZrF,. However, if the uranium is to be
returned to a diffusion plant or made into heter-
ogeneous fuel elements, additional decontamination
must be obtained. This may be accomplished by
adding a complete UF , fractional distillation step
to the procedure shown in Fig. T1.1,

This method of uranium recovery and decon-
tamination can also be used for processing heter-
ogeneous reactor fuel elements of the type that
can be dissolved in fused fluoride salt by means
of hydrogen fluoride.  Compactness of plant,
operation at atmospheric pressure, and economical
waste disposal are some of the advantages of this
type of process,

FISSION-PRODUCT REMOVAL

Three methods have been tested for removing
fission products from the UF ,-F, mixture obtained
by fluorination of a wuraniumecontaining fused
fluoride salt: scrubbing the gas with a molten salt
(NaF-ZrF ), scrubbing the gas with C,F,,, and
passing the gas through a solid NaF absorbent
bed at650°C. Of the three methods, NaF absorption
is the best; it gives an over-all gross beta decon-
tamination factor of more than 104,

Use of a molten salt scrub, NaF-ZrF , (56-44
mole %) at 650°C, followed by sublimation, for
removing fission-product activity from the UF,
product of the fluorination step gave, as reported
previously,] over-all decontamination factors of
2 % 10% and 430 to 750 for gross beta and ruthenium
beta activities, respectively. However, in the
scrub step alone, the decontamination factor for
the ruthenium, which is by far the most important
volatile activity in the long-cooled material, was
only 6, as shown by determination of the ruthenium
in the molten salt. In a repetition of this experi-
ment, the ruthenium decontamination factor in the
scrub step was only 2 {run 1, Table 11.1), and the
over-all ruthenium decontamination factor was 350.

ruthenium was apparently volatilized out of the
reactor entirely. Ruthenium and niobium plated
out heavily on the metal walls of the reactor. The
distribution ratio between metal wall and salt was
about 5 for ruthenium activity and less than 0.01
for niobium activity,

The behavior of plufomum in the fused salt
fluoride-volatility process is important inprocessing
fuel that has a high proportion of U238, The
results of many fluorination runs at 650°C show
that only about 0.01% of the plutonium is carried
over with the UF6 product,

Further study was carried out on the absorption
of UF, in NaF-ZrF, (56-44 mole %) at 650°C.
In one trlal 9 g of UF, was absorbed in 30 g of
NaF-ZrF , in 1 hr with no noticeable loss. How-
ever, passage of helium through the fused salt,

~ either concurrently with or after the UF , addition,
produced considerable fuming, A positive test for

fluorine with potaséiurh iodide paper was obtained,
which indicated reduction of the adsorbed UF to
the tetra- or pentavalent form of uranium. A
gravimetric test, based on the reaction of fluorine
with sodium chloride, showed that the breakdown
of UF, to Fé and UF4 amounts to 1 to 2% per hour
at 650°C.

Engineering information is needed on two steps
in the fluorlde-volthlfy process: fluorination and
UF, cold-trapping, Effective contacting of fluorine
with molten ARE fuel is desirable to minimize
fluorine consumption and gaseous waste and to
assure complete recovery of the uranium. The cold
trap should be operated in such a manner that all

the UF, will be condensed and collected on fhe' )
walls of the trap rafher than lost as

¢ smoke.

properties of the liquid could not be demonstrated
by a simple correlation of friction factor with
Reynolds number, such as is found in ordinary
fluid flow through pipes. The acetylene tetra-

‘bromide studies showed that vertical mixing of the

fiquid phase was induced by a gas rate of 9.5 cfm
in a 12-in,-dia column, Equipment is now being
assembled to verify these conclusions with molten
NaF-ZrF .

Cold traps to be used for a quantitative study
of the effect of temperature and gas flow rate on
the completeness of UF, removal are being con-
structed. The design of these traps is based on a
K-25 cold-trap design.

APPLICATIONS OF FUSED SALT~VOLATILITY
PROCESSES

A long-range study has been made to survey the
over-all feasibility of fused salt—volatility tech-
niques in the chemical processing of ARE-type
reactor fuels and certain types of heterogeneous
reactor fuel elements. The volumes of radioactive
waste from such processes should be much lower
than those from the aqueous processes, and
processing costs should be low, even though a
means of disposing of excess fluorine will have
to be provided. Total chemical costs, which in
present aqueous processes represent approximately
10% of operating costs, have been estimated to be
20¢ per gram of U235, The operational procedure
is much simpler, and the equipment should be

inexpensive, even though nickel will be required

as the material of construction.

Anrcroﬁ Reucior Fuels

The fecovery and reprocessing schedule for

' fluid-fuel curcroft reactors will probably be dictated

by aircraft reactor and turbine maintenance sched-
ules rather than by the rate of formation of neutron
poisons. [t is anticipated that operation will
follo’w a schedule such as: (1) one day of oper-

‘ation’ aand one day of downtime for an accumulation

“of s seven operahng days, (2) seven days of downtime

for minor maintenance, (3) repetition of this sched-
ule until 1000 operating hours have been accumu-
lated. After 1000 hr of operation, the entire reactor

will be dumped and the fuel will be reprocessed.

The anMCIpated cooling period before repro-

‘:"'cessmg will be 10 days to allow decay of short-

lived activities. The minimum decontamination
factor requ;red for the process would be approxi-
mately 100 for poison removal only. The other
steps in fuel makeup can easily be handled remotely.

The following essential steps are used in the
chemical processing (Fig. 11.2). First, the UF
in the molten fuel mixture is fluorinated to volatile
UF, by introducing a 10-fold excess of elemental
fluorine to achieve separation and partial decon-
tamination from the other fuel components and
fission products; second, the UF, is reduced to
UF, with hydrogen in the gas phase in the Y
reactor, as designed by K-25; and third, the re-
sulting UF, is added to 2 moles of NaF to prepare
a fuel concentrate for subsequent return to the
reactor. Presentknowledge of this systemindicates
that all steps are adaptable for radicactive remote
operation. Considerable engineering development
and operational experience have been obtained
with the second and third steps, while extended
laboratory development has indicated the feasibility
of the dlrec’r ﬂuormatlon of the molten fuel mixture.

Heferogeneous Reactor Fuels

The separation of U233 from zirconium alloy
fuel elements is currently the most promising

- 'applicaﬁ'onrdf"the_ fluoride process to fixed fuel
’élemenf reactors. The dissolution rate of zirconium

Cwith HF in the NaF- ZrF fused salt is very high,

that is, 22 to 35 mlls/hr (Table 11.4). The range

is  probably due to metallurgical differences.

138

Although the ratio of zirconium to uranium is very
high in STR elements, the cost of HF to dissolve
zirconium will be only 5¢ per gram of U235 A
probable method for zirconium separation as a
guide for process development is indicated by the
flow diagram shown in Fig. 11.3. This flow sheet
is similar to that for fluid-fuel processing, but it

“includes hydrofluorination of the fuel element in a

composite slab shields and the heating in beryllium
slabs resulting from gomma rays in an adjacent
source. In addition, a three-parameter mathematical
formulation of the variation of radiation-induced
injury to pilots of nuclear-powered aircraft with
time after exposure was derived, and analyses

were made of the preliminary differential experi-

ENERGY ABSORPTION RESULTING FROM
INCIDENT GAMMA RADIATION AS A FUNCTION
' OF THICKNESS OF MATERIALS
WITH SLAB GEOMETRY

C. D. Zerby

The interaction of radiation with the atomic
particles of matter results in an energy transfer to

‘the particles or in the creation of secondary radia-

tion. The secondary radiation, in turn, is usually
absorbed close to the primary interaction. With

" high radiation intensity, the absorption of radiation

energy in biological shields or in structural members
can be important, Since essentially all the energy
absorbed becomes heat, problems of induced thermal
stresses in already stressed structural members
may well determine design limitations, The heating
effect may also be a limiting design factor in some
cases 'in which material strength is seriously de-
pendent on temperature. In all cases some knowl-
edge of the energy absorption distribution within a
material is necessary, Only a preliminary study of
heating in beryllium has been completed thus far,
and results are reported here.

Most radiation absorption problems can be at
least approximated by known analytical methods.
For the gomma radiation absorption distribution,
however, solution of the Boltzmann transport equa-
tion is necessary for accuracy. At NDA, extensive
calculations have been carried out® to solve the
transport equation for the penetration of gamma
rays, The NDA calculations included the energy
absorption as a function of position for a point
isotropic source,* but it was not possible to in-
clude the absorption distribution for plane slabs,
At ORNL, the total energy absorption of incident
gamma radiation in the different materials of finitely
thick composite slabs was also calculated,? but,
again, the calculation did not include the absorption
distribution,

In this study the Monte Carlo method is being
used for the calculation of the energy absorption

~ distribution in finitely thick slabs, and the calcu-

lctions are progrommed for solution on the ORACLE

at ORNL, For a monodirectional beam of mono-
energetic photons on a slab of material of finite
thickness, the energy absorption was calculated
in every interval of 0.10 in, through the slab. The
absorption included the energy transmitted to the
material in a scattering collision as well as that
transmitted in an absorption collision; in every
case the photon was followed until it was reflected
from the slab, was absorbed, or had penetrated the
slab. The scattering cross sections were calcy-
lated with the use of the Klein-Nishina scattering-
cross-section formula,® while the absorption cross
sections were obtained by empirical fits to published
data,®

A 9-in.-thick slab of beryllium was used, and the
incident photons were considered to have energies
of 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 m0c2 and to be normally incident.
For the 1.5-m0c2 case, angles of incidence of 30,
60, and 85 deg were also investigated (1 m062
= 0.51 Mev).

The results obtained for the normally incident
0.5-m0c2 photons on the slab of beryllium are shown
in Fig. 12.3, The histogram indicates the statistical
nature of the Monte Carlo solution, while the smooth
curve is a fit, by eye, to the data, The values
given on the histogram are the averages of the
values for the 0.10-in, intervals. In the future it is
intended that a rigorous method of fitting the data
will be employed. The area under the curve is the
total energy absorption.

direction in that increased total doses were allowed
for schedules which distributed the radiation over
longer times. It has been demonstrated® that the
ANP-MAG recommendations can be expressed to
within 4% by a mathematical formulation with three
parameters based on a model of partly irreparable
injury and partly injury which recovers exponen-
tially with time, The model was previously sug-

Other formulations are suggested to take account

tivity by previous doses. Nothing basic to the
biology of the problem is intended; rather, it is
suggested that if the restrictive planning chart is
satisfactory for airplane design and strategic plan-
ning, then the formulation should also be satis-

~ factory from a biological point of view, Since it

is much more flexible than the chart, it would be
much more useful for interpretation of actual radia-
tion schedules in terms of injury.

This same model predicts that the AEC laboratory
tolerance doses administered over a 30-year period
give the same injury as does an instantaneous
dose of about 60 rem. These numbers are not in-
consistent with presently accepted concepts.

ANALYSIS OF‘SOME PRELIMINARY
DIFFERENTIAL EXPERIMENTS

M. F. Valerino!3

In order to investigate the adequacy of simple

analytical models proposed for describing some of

the neutron transport processes involved in the

aircraft divided-shield concept, some of the data

obtained in the preliminary differential experi-
ments'? at the TSF have been examined. Only

‘thermal-neutron measurements have been made.

The thermal-neutron flux measured at the rear of
the detector tank as o function of the angle @ (angle
between the reactor axis of symmetry and the
source-detector axis) for a 85-ft reactor-detector
separation distance and a 195-ft altitude is shown
in Fig. 12.6. The flux is plotted relative to that
for 6 = 0 deg and is compared with a curve of the
direct beam flux to be expected at the detector, as
calculated on the basis of the total water thickness
between the reactor surface and the detector. In
the calculation of the direct beam flux the leakage
neutrons were assumed to have a cosine distribu-
tion at the reactor surface, and the attenuation
lengths were based on Lid Tank Shielding Facility
(LTSF) data corrected to give the point-to-point
material attenuation kernel. The calculated curve
agrees well with the experimental curve for angles
up to 45 deg. Beyond the 45-deg angle, the calcu-
lated flux drops off rapidly, and at 90 deg the direct
beam is gone. The measured flux for 6 = 90 deg
must hence be presumed to be due to air-scattered
neutrons only. Single-scatter theory calculations
have not yet been performed for the case of a beam
whose axis of symmetry is at an angle with the
source-detector axis, and hence it was not possible
to calculate the magnitude of the air scattering to
be expected.

In order to estimate the air scattering into the
rear of the detector tank, the air-scattered flux

measurements taken at the side of the detector tank
were considered. For 6 = 90 deg, the experiments
indicate that the scaﬁermg into the side and that
into the rear of the detector tank are approximately

‘equal, If it is assumed that this is nearly true for

angles between 45 and 90 deg, the air scattering
into the rear can be estimated from the measure-
ments at the side. When the olr-scaﬂered neutron
flux estimated in this manner is added to the
calculated direct beam flux, the dashed curve in
Fig. 12.6 is obtained. The fair agreement between
the dashed curve and the measured curve indicates

that the simple model used to calculqte the angle’

of distribution of the leakage neutrons from the
shield sutface may be adequate for divided-shield
design. |

when the beam is pointed directly towards the
detector tank, that is, for 8 = 0 deg. Hence, the
ordinate is a measure of the fraction of the beam
scattered into the sides of the detector tank. The
abscissa is the beam direction 8§, The points indi-
cated by the experiments for 6 = 30 and 90 deg were
obtained by extrapolation of the fluxes measured
in the water to give the extrapolated surface.values.
The measured relaxation lengths were used in the
extrapolation; no relaxation length measurements
were made for 6 = 0 deg, and therefore this pro-
cedure could not be used for this angle. The only
single-scatter calculation presently available is for
6 =0 deg, and it is based on the assumption of a
2r-isotropic detector, that is, an isotropic detector
with one hemisphere shielded. This calculation
gives a value of 0.048 for 6 = 0 deg, which is to be
compared with the values indicated by the experi-

“ments of 0.063 for 6 = 30 deg and 0.048 for 0 = 90

deg. As the beam is rotated from 30 to 0 deg, it is
nearly cut in half insofar as scattering into the one
side of the detector tank is concerned, and this
should result in a decrease of the scattering into

- the one side of the detector tank. The scattered

flux measurements taken within the water show
this to be the case, The point calculated by
single-scatter theory for § = 0 deg appears to agree
with the points obtained from the experiment for

= 30 and € = 90 deg. However, it should be
cautioned that the fair agreement indicated in the

figure could be fortuitous. In the comparison, the

assumption is involved that the thermal flux re-
sulting from a given fast-neutron current into the
side of the detector tank is the same for air-scattered

_neutrons as for direct-beam neutrons. Also, some
‘untertalnhes are mfroduced in the ex?rapofa‘hon of
;fhe thermal ﬂux to obtaln the surfoce value..

200 ft are relatively free from a background of
ground-scattered neutrons.

In each experiment the neutron flux reaching a
BF, detector placed inside the detector tank and
near a side wall was measured as the altitudes of
the source and the detector were varied simul-
taneously from the ground to 200 ft. The only
major difference between the two experiments was
the shielding placed around the TSF reactor. In
the first case the reactor was placed in the reactor
tank at a distance (p) of 45 cm from the tank wall
and a reactor angle (6) of 330 deg from the source-
detector axis;'? in the second case the reactor
was placed in a mockup of the GE-ANP R-1 shield
design (see ‘‘TSF Experiment with the Mockup of
the GE-ANP R-1 Shield Design,”’ in Sec. 15).

In order to estimate the actual ground-scattered
contribution at the 200-ft altitude, attempts were
made to analytically separate the experimental
measurements into their air- and ground-scattered
components. A calculation'® of the number of
neutrons singly scattered into a point isotropic
detector as a function of the solid angle in which
they had left the source had been made previously
for the case of infinite height. Also, a calculation'’
of the number of air-scattered neutrons lost because
of the presence of the ground and the number of
ground-scattered neutrons reaching the detector as
a function of source solid angle and altitude had
been made. All three calculations assumed single
isotropic scattering, air attenuation, and a separation
distance of 64 ft.!8

The integration over the source solid angle to
obtain curves of air and ground scattering as a

function of altitude was welghted in each case by

negligible, and the single air-scattering curve as a
function of altitude was normalized at this point.
This normalized curve was then used to subtract
the air-scattered contribution from the experimental
measurements at lower altitudes, and thus a series
of experimental ground-scattering points was ob-
tained. A fit of the calculated ground-scattering

larger than, and concentric with, the LTSF source
plate. The measurements were made behind the
tank in the LTSF water. '

As indicated in Fig. 13.6, the presence of the
35 ducts in the gamma shield increased the
thermal-neutron flux by a factor of approximately
3000. In the medium of plain water, the flux was
increased by a factor of 300, For the water
medium the increase in flux seems to be consistent
with a calculation which takes into account only
the reduced density of the attenuating medium.
For the case in which the ducts were in the gamma
shield, the neutron streaming in the ducts appears
to be relatively more important, The latter is not
surprising, since the addition of the steel in-
creases the attenuation of the medium to neutrons
as well as to gamma rays.

The fast-neutron dose rates beyond the 35-duct
array both in @ medium of water and in the Raschig
ring—borated water medium are shown in Fig. 13.7.
The gamma-ray dose rate beyond the gamma shield
without the ducts is compared in Fig. 13.8 with
that beyond the shield with the 35 ducts, The
presence of the ducts increased the gamma dose
rate by a factor of approximately 160.

For much of the time during the last quarter the

Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF) was shut down for

'r'n'_od\ifikcqﬂons to the reactor pool. The modifi-

cations were being made to permit the use of
demineralized water in the reactor pool in order
to eliminate corrosion of the reactor fuel elements.
The set of high-power fuel elements which had

" previously been operating in process water that

had been treated by chromate addition had to be
discarded, even though burnup of the uranium in

"’rhese elements was negligible, because of the
" extent of pitting of the aluminum cladding. In

order to utilize demineralized water, the pool was
cleaned and painted, and all steel was either
removed or sprayed with a stainless steel pro-
tective layer. A bypass demineralizer is being
installed to maintain the water purity. The
measurement reported below was made by members

. of the BSF stcff in other facilities.

A SEARCH FOR SHORT-HALF-LIFE NUCLEAR
ISOMERS IN X379, Rb®%, RLE7, AND Z:7°

" R. W. Peelle
E. C. Campbell F. C. Maienschein

Rubidium, potassium, and zirconium are among
materials which have been considered as fuel
components for reactor systems in which the fuel
is circulated. Any short-period isomeric gamma-
ray fransitions would complicate the shielding of
the external fuel loop, especially if the gamma
rays were of high energy. Rubidium was previ-

‘ously known to possess a low-energy isomeric
'rfrcmsmon with a half life of about 1 min, but
_'measurements had not been made which would
" reveal any shorter period that might be present.

Elecfromagnetically enriched K37, Rb®3, and
Rb37 in the form of nitrates were injected into

‘the ORNL Graphite Reactor by use of a fast

pneumatic probe assembly designed by E. C.
Campbell. Since the samples were ejected from
the cenfer of the reactor within about 0.1 sec from
the end of the bombardment, it was possible to
moke a search for very short-period activities.
The ejected sample was viewed by a thallium-
activated sodium iodide scintillation-crystal
gamma-ray detector. The signal from the photo-
multiplier was transmitted by coaxial cables to
a multichannel differential pulse-height analyzer
located at the BSF. In addition, the counting rate
of any part of the spectrum could be measured as
a function of time with a linear count-rate meter
and a very fast Brown recorder, Thus both
spectral and time decay analyses of gamma radi-
ation emitted by the irradiated sample were ob-
tainable.

A study of K37 yielded no short-period activity.
In the rubidium isotopes the previously known
radiations were found, but no shorter period
isomers were discovered. Isomers with an ap-
preciable energy and cross section would have
been detected if they had had a half life greater
than about 0.03 sec. A sample of Rb®> was found
to contain the known 550 + é-kev transition, with
a 1.05 * 0.05-min period, and bombardment of
Rb87 produced the known Rb3® activity.

The apparatus described above was also used
in the discovery of a number of new isomeric
transitions with half periods? between 0.05 and
5 sec. One of these is Zr?%”, which yields a
2.30 + 0.03-Mev gamma ray with a half life of
about 0.83 * 0.03 sec. This isomer is produced
by inelastic neutron scattering.>

© Tests on the GE-ANP R-1 divided shield mockup

TSF EXPERIMENT WITH THE MOCKUP OF
THE GE-ANP R-1 SHIELD DESIGN

T. V. Blosser J. YVan Hoomissen

,D' L. Gilliland F. N. Watson

The mockup of the GE-ANP R-1 reactor shield
design (Fig. 15.1) is being used at the TSF for a
series of measurements, Fast-neutron and gamma-
ray dose rates were measured around the reactor
shield section while it was submerged in water in
the reactor handling pool. In addition, thermal-
neutron flux and gamma-ray dose rate measurements
have been made in the detector tank located a
fixed horizontal distance from the reactor shield.

The reactor loading for this experiment (Fig.
15.2) was a 5 x 7 fuel element array which gave a
symmetrical power distribution throughout the re-

< actor. In ofder to avoid excess reactivity, a fuel
- element was removed from the center of each of
" the two seven-element faces, The measurements

were compared with similar measureme'nfs‘nﬂ'n'ade
earlier at the BSF.! L

In general, the BSF and TSF data were in agree-
ment, as is indicated in Figs. 15.3 and 15.4. How-
ever, they were not in complete agreement, largely
because of differences in the experimental setups
at the two facilities. For example, while the TSF
had a symmetrical power density distribution, the
fuel element loading at the BSF gave an asym-
metrical distribution which had a maximum 8.1 ecm
from the center line of the reactor grid. Also,
only compartments A and D contained borated water
at the BSF, whereas at the TSF all compartments
contained borated water for the first in-pool meas-
urements, Later, plain water was used in Com-
partment D. The BSF boration was 1.1 wt %, while
the TSF boration was 0.85 wt %, For the measure-
ments off the rear section at the BSF, no lead or
iron side shielding was present, while at the TSF
the side shielding shown in Fig. 15.1 was in
position, For the measurements off the front and
side sections, the side shield at the BSF had «
total of 1in. less steel than the side shield at the
TSF.

Measurements of the neutrons scattered into the
side of the detector tank (located a horizontal
distance of 70.8 ft from the G-E reactor shield)
were made as a function of altitude.. The flux
(Fig. 15.5) is a slowly varying function of the
altitude, and it exhibits a peak at about 35 ft.
A decrease of about 6% in the readings between
150 and 200 ft indicates that the ground-scattered
neufrons are still observable at these altitudes for
this particular reactor-shield combination. The
shape of the curve is quite different from that ob-
tained in the differential shielding experiments

with the water tank,? because the G-E shield

Fig. 15.4. Gamma-Ray Dose Rate Measurements
in Water Near GE-ANP R-1 Mockup.

mockup emits neutrons in a direction more favorable
for ground scattering. The intensity from the G-E
shield peaks at about 55 and 120 deg from the
reactor-detector center line and is symmetrical
about the reactor-detector axis,

Measurements were also made of the thermal-
neutron flux and the gomma-ray dose rates within
the detector tank at an altitude of 195 ft. The
G-E reactor shield was a horizontal distance of
64 ft from the detector tank, and, for these meas-
urements, five l-in.-thick lead slabs were installed
1 ft from the rear face (reactor side) of the tank.
The lead slabs simulated the shielding in the crew
compartment,

A knowledge of the thermal-neutron flux distri-
bution in the detector tank is useful in extending
the fast-neutron dose rate measurements into
regions where the intensity is too low to be meas-
ured with the dosimeter. This distribution is also
necessary for predicting the capture g'amma-rgjy

infensity to be expected in the crew shield. The

flux (Fig. 15.6) along the y axis (coincident with
the reactor-detector axis) exhibits an average re-

" laxation length of 5.0 e¢m in the water between the

rear face and the lead. This indicates that these
neutrons are largely air-scattered neutrons, as
would be expected, since the thick neutron shadow
shield eliminates the direct beam. The apparent
transparency of the lead is suspect, since the
possibility exists that neutrons were streaming in
through the lead from the side of the detector tank.

An x traverse (Fig. 15.7) was taken in order to
indicate the attenuation to be expected from the

crew compartment side shielding, The apparent
relaxation length, which is not constant, is very
short, 4.2 cm, in the first few centimeters of pene-
tration and increases to 6.0 cm between 25 and
40 cm of penetration. This short relaxation length
is probably indicative of the large number of low-
energy neutrons escaping through the air ducts in
the reactor shield.

In a y traverse (Fig. 15.8) the gamma relaxation

length is approximately 13 cm at the front of the

detector tank and approximately 17 ¢m at the rear
of the tank.
