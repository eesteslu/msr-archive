FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program records the technical
progress of the research at the Laboratory, under its Contract W-7405-eng-26, on power-
producing reactors fueled with circulating fused salts. The report is divided into two
major parts: 1. Reactor Design Studies and 2. Materials Studies.

Until July 1, 1957, the Molten-Salt Reactor Program was largely a design study, with
only token expenditures for experimental work, As of July 1, the program was expanded
to include experimental work on materials. A further augmentation of the program occurred
on October 1, 1957, when personnel and facilities for additional research and experi-
mentation became available. As a result of these transitions, this quarterly report has
been expanded to include component development and testing, engineering research,

metallurgical and chemical investigations, and radiation-damage testing.

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAH QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART 1. REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES
1.1. Reactor Design

Preliminary layouts have been prepared of the
molten-salt reactor system that are based on the
use of five fuel pumps and two blanket-salt pumps,
The total thermal power production is assumed to
be 638 Mw, with 90% of the power being generated

‘and leakage probabilities. The resulting constants

in that (1) it is always in a standby condition in

which it is lmmedlately available for drainage of
~ the fuel, (2) it can adequately handle the fuel

in the 8-ft-dia core and 10% being generated in the |

2-ft-thick blanket. The fpfopos_ed layouts are being

afterheat, and (3) criticality cannot be achieved in

- the drain system. The fill-and-drain vessel con-

studied in order to achieve simplification and to

minimize the fuel inventory,
reactor cell are also being studied in order to
determine the best possible arrangements of piping
and other components that . will provide minimum
plant size and yet facilitate remote maintenance..

The parameter study of two-region, homogeneous,
molten salt reactors was continued through nuclear
calculations on the Univac, the Oracle, and the
IBM-704, The Univac calculations indicate that,
for the same core diameter and thorium content of
the fuel salt, the U233 inventory would be one-

half the U?35 inventory., In the U235 case the
regeneration ratio is limited to a moximum -of

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

Facilities are being designed and constructed

for development tests of the salt-lubricated

bearings being considered for use in fused salt

pumps. The oil-lubricated bearings being used at

present are unsatisfactory because they must be
shielded from both the heat and the radiation from

~the fuel salt in order to avoid damage to the

bearings and to the lubricant, Equipment is to be

set up for -high-temperature tests of both hydro-

dynamic and hydrostatic salt-lubricated bearings.
Oil-lubricated mechanical shaoft seals are being

_ studied for auxiliary system applications. Modi-

fications in purge-gas fiow are being tested as a

means of preventing diffusion of process-fluid
~ vapor into the seal region, Also, since oil-

lubricated bearings may be required for the upper
seals of the fuel pumps, tests of Dowtherm A as
a lubricant are under way, This lubricant decom-
poses  into gaseous and liquid products when
irradiated, rather than into carbonaceous deposits
of the type that result from the irradiation of
hydrocarbon-base lubricants, A fest of a pump
rotary element with oil-lubricated bearings is also
under way in a radiation field. Further, a bellows-

mounted seal is being operated in an endurance

test in a sump pump that is circulating NaK at
1250°F,

" Techniques for remote maintenance of the com-
ponents within the reactor cell are being studied.

1t is considered that the most feasible solution to

the maintenance problem is to make all components
removable and replaceable by remote manipulation,
Therefore means for remotely separating and
joining pipes are being investigated. "Tests are
under way of three types of flange joints: (1) a
freeze-flange joint in which a frozen seal of molten
salt is used to prevent leakage of molten salt
thraugh the space between the flanges, (2) a joint
which has a cast-metal seal between the flanges,
and (3) o joint in which a V-shaped tooth on each

: flange indents the sealingring.

The various types of remote-handling appurafus

‘now ‘available commercially are being studied for

applicability to maintenance of this reactor sys-

tem, - The remote assembly and disassembly of a

pump in a hot cell is being attempted as a means

 of studying the manipulation problems. Design

work has also been initiated on heater-insulation

“units that can be remotely removed aond replaced.

Plans are being made for a large-scale demon-
stration facility in which fo test mechanical joints,

the replaceability of components, the adequacy of
heater-insulation units, the unitization of wiring
harness and service piping, and the application of
remote-wewmg ond -hundllng apparatus ond tech-
niques,

A heat exchanger test facnllty is - bemg operated
to obtain heat transfer correlations for predicting
the heat transfer performance of the molten salis
of interest, Experimental information is required
because the heat transfer characteristics of some
salts appear to be affected by the type of struc-
tural material used and by the wettmg properhes
of the salts,

" Forced-circulation Joops in which large tem-

~ perature drops can be achieved are being operated
to study the corrosion of INOR-8 and of Inconel by
the fused salts of interest, The long-time effects

are of particular interest, and satisfactory opera-
tion of a loop will imply operation for one year or

- longer without significant equipment difficulties

or changes in operating conditions. Two special
loops have been constructed of INOR-8. One of
these includes graphite specimens and will be

examined after operation to determine the extent

to which graphite causes carburization of INOR-8

and the effects of the fused salt mixture on’

graphite, The other loop includes INOR-8 speci-
mens for weight-loss studies.

A forced-circulation loop is also being assembled

that will be operated in a beam hole in the MTR,
Operation of the loop will provide information on
fuel stability and corrosion of INOR-8 under
irradiation at simulated reactor conditions.

1.3, Engineering Research

Three entrance-exit systems proposed for the
core of the molten salt reactor are being studied
in glass models., Preliminary qualitative data on

flow patterns and velocity profiles have been ob-
tained through visual observation and photographic

recording of the motion of phosphorescent particles.
The three systems being studied consist of (1) a
core with the inlet and outlet diametrically oppo-
site each other (straight-through flow), (2) a core
with the inlet ond outlet concentric and the fluid
entering through the inner pipe and exiting through
the outer annulus, and (3) o core with the inlet

—and outlet concentric and the fluid entering through

the annulus and exiting through the inner pipe.

In initial experiments with the concentric system

and the fluid entering through the inner pipe, @

large toroidal eddy was noted in the region be-
tween the high-velocity, central, downward jet
and the return stream along the core walis. Such
an eddy could engender discrete high-temperature
masses within the main fluid flow ond thus give
rise to high-frequency thermal cycling of system
components. The effect of o vortex generator at
the entrance will be studied. '
Experimental determinations are being made of
the viscosities and thermal conductivities of
several BeF ,-bearing fluoride salt mixtures. Heat
transfer studies are being made in order to de-
termine the effect of nonwetting and interfacial
film formation on heat transfer in Inconel and
INOR-8 systems.,

LiF-BeF,-UF , (53-46-1 mole %).
1.4. Advunced Reactor Studies

A  preliminary design study was made of o
natural-convection molten salt reactor which could
be used in a system in which there was a premium
placed on reliability and ease of maintenance.

The advantages of eliminating the fuel-circulating

pumps and the attendant problems of maintenance
are obtained at the cost of the increased fuel
volume required for a system in which the pressure
losses must ke very low. A gas-turbine cycle or
one of several steam cycles that operate efficiently
under high-temperature conditions would be used
with this system. In this study both helivm and
a molten salt were considered as coolants for the

The sodium-graphite
system was found to be a rapid and effective
medium for carburizing stainless steels, Hastelloy

to the graphite—fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF -UF,, 50-46-4

“mole %) system for 100 hr at 1500 and at 1250°F

in seesaw-furnace apparatus did not become
carburized.  Static capsule tests revealed that
INOR-8 carburized more readily in sedium than
Inconel, The 'INOR-8 tensile specimens to be

Prellmmary layouts of the molten-salt reactor
(MSR) system are being prepared as a means of -

studying the mechanicel design. These layouts
are based on the use of five fuel pumps and two

blanket-salt pumps.  The total thermal power.

production is assumed to be 638 Mw, with 90% of
the power being genergted in the 8-ft-dia core and
10% being generated in the 2-ft-thick blanket,
Each of the layouts, presented here as Figs. 1.1.1
through 1.1.5, has both satisfactory and unsatis-
factory features. - It is hoped that through examining
many possible arrangements the most simple de-

sign can be determined. Layouts of the reactor
cell are also being made in order to determine the

best possible arrangements of piping and other
components that will provide minimum plant size
and yet facilitate remote maintenance, |

The basic layout shown in Fig. 1.1.1 of a two-

pass reactor with a blanket was conceived with the

support and fabrication problems as the major
influence. The main support ring is, in effect,
a channel rolled into @ ring, Both the blanket and
core shells are supported by this ring. The fuel
pumps are supported by their barrels, which pene-
trate the top flange. Both the fuel and the blanket-
salt expansion tanks are formed by conventional
shell-head shapes. Individual pump suct:on hnes

direct to the neck of the reacfor core vessel are
prowded to avoid stresses ‘induced by penetrchon.

connected by a gas annulus or torus with space
for expansion of the fuel under conditions other
than normal. The pumps ore completely covered
with fuel at all times, The fuel inventory for this
layout is 395 ft3 and could be reduced, since the
connecting pipes out of the core and the pump
tanks appear to be lorger than necessary. The
fuel inlet and outlet pipes pass through the
blanket pressure vessel wall and may create
undesirable stresses. The temperature difference
between the inlet and outlet pipes is expected to
be about 135°F. Further study will be required to
determine whether the resulting stresses can be
tolerated.

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

'NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS
L. G. Alexander J. T. Roberts

Nuclear calculations relative to parameter studies
of molten salt reactors for the production of power
were continued, The Univac calculations, for
which the Ocusol program is used, have provided
information about U235. and U?33-fueled reactors
of the reference design type, primarily, but studies
have been initiated of plutonium-fueled molten

‘salt reactors and of graphite-moderated molten salt
y233 breeder reactors.

7Unrivc‘lc-0cuso| Reactor Calculations
J. T. Roberts

The parameter study of two-region, homogeneous,
molten salt reactors described in the previous
report! has been extended and refined. The calcu-
lations based on the use of the 69 mole % LiF-=31
mole % BeF, salt plus ThF4 and UF , in the core
and of the 75 mole % LiF-25 mole % ThF, salt
in the blanket were completed, and a new study
based on the use of a 63 mole % LiF~37 mole %
BeF, salt plus ThF, and UF, in the core and of
a 71 mole % LiF-16 mole % BeF,~13mole % ThF,
salt in the blanket was initiated. The effects of
changing the salts are expected to be a small
reduction in critical mass and a reduction of
approximately 12% in the external regeneration
ratio. Blanket thickness will also be a variable
in the new parameter study.

In the calculations just completed a comparison
was made of U233- and U?35-fueled reactors. The
results of these calculations are presented in Fig.
1.1.6, which shows the fissionable material in-

ventory at startup as a function of core diameter.

The effect of various amounts of thorium, in the

“range 0 to 1 mole % in the fuel salt, is also shown.

For the some core diameter and thorium content of
the fuel salt, the U233 inventory for the cases
shown is less than half the U?3% inventory., This
is due to both the higher ¢, and the lower a for
y233 compared with those for U233 in intermediate
reactors, In Figs. 1.1.7 and 1.1.8, the 5-1, the
initial total regenercmon ratio, and the initial
blanket regeneration ratio for U235. and UZ33.
fueled reactors are plotted as functions of thorium

range 5to 10 ft. In the U235 cases the regenera-
tion ratio is limited to a maximum of about 0.675
by the comparatively low value of 5 and a practical
minimum loss to capture in the salt and in the core
shell of about 0,1+, The U233 cases were not
carried for enough to establish a *‘ceiling’’ on the
regeneration ratio, but, judging from the n—1values,
it would seem to be possible to exceed 1.0 by
increasing the thorium content of the fuel salt to,
perhaps, 1.5 to 2% and, at the same time, in-
creasing the U233 inventory to, perhaps, 300 to
900 kg, depending on the core diameter. It should
be remembered, however, that the regeneration
ratios shown for the U233-fueled reactors will
decrease with time as burnup poisons accumulate
in the system, while in the U235.fueled reactors,
with initial regeneration ratios of about 0.6 or
better, the regeneration ratio may actually improve
with time and with reasonable chemical- process'ang
rates because of the buildup of the superior U%33
fuel,

Calculations were also made in order to compare
lithium-beryllium ond sodium-beryllium salts as

fuels for reactors of the reference design type.:

the leakages at the highest energies, which, being
small, are known to only two significant figures.

groups, the round-off bias tends to accumulate
and to be amplified in the lower groups,

In order to remedy this defect, a subroutine for
computing the constants for Sorghum from the con-
centrations, ubsorphon cross sechons, initial
spectrum, and jeakage probabilities was written
and incorporated in the program. The resulting

constants, which differ only slightly from those

based on the scattering cross sections computed
by Ocusol, reproduce the initial spectrum and
critical concenfrahon exacﬂy.
Absorphon cross sections for Pa233, U234,
U236 Np237, and Pu?3? were estimated and were
inserted into the program, together with fission
cross sections for Pu?3?, The modafled program
has been operofed successfully on a test case.
Tests to determine limitations imposed on the
magnitude of the time ancrement by convergence
requirements and the drift in group leakage proba-

bilities are in progress.

Efforts to bring the Oracle program Cornpone
into use for molten salt reactors have been con-
tinved. Initial tests, for which the Ocusol group
structure and cross sections were used, showed
disagreement in the critical mass; also, the com-
puting time was excessive. The effects of modify-
ing the group structure, scaling factors, number of
space points in thin-shell regions, and method of
treating the principal scatterers are being studied,

A decision to normalize the fractional absorption
of neutrons in each elemental species with respect
to the reactor as a whole, rather than with respect
to the various regions, has necessitated revisions
of the edit subroutine. Provision has been made

to edrt the mtegrated flux -in each group and each L

FUEL FILL-AND-DRAIN SYSTEM DESIGN
G. D. Whitman

A preliminary design study has been made of a
fuel fill-and-drain system for the MSR. This
system must meet the following three major design
criteria;

1. A preheating system must be provided that is
capable of maintaining the drain vesse! and its
connecting plumbing at 1200°F,

2. A reliable heat-removal system must be pro-
vided that has sufficient capacity to handle the

fuel afterheat,

3. The drain vessel must be ‘‘ever-safe’’ so that
criticality cannot be achieved when the fuel is
drained. :

The fuel draining operation has not been con-

sidered as an emergency procedure which must be

accomplished in a relatively short period of time
in order to prevent a catastrophe, |t is considered
that, if all forced circulation ceased during. high-
power operation, the thermal capacity and heat
losses of the system would prevent prompt thermal
transients that would be capable of causing
failure of the primary containment vessels. There
are, however, other incentives for rapid removal of
the fluid from the fuel circuit. [f, for example,
there was a leak in the fuel system it would be

_important to drain the fuel in order to minimize the

cell contamination and cross contamination of

‘systems. Further, rapid removal of the fuel at the

time of a shutdown for maintenance would have an

‘economic advantage in reducing the power outage

'hme.
A consnderahon of these factors mdlcated that

e the maximum afterheat design load should be 10 Mw
" - for ' a 600-Mw reactor that had been operating.
'for one year- und had been shut down' for 10 min
e ~ before the fuel was drained.  No credit was taken

- to ‘G“OW for jemperature excursuons and a residual

‘the primary containment vessel of the drain system

in order to obtain a large surface-area-to-volume
ratio for heat transfer efficiency and to provide a

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

large amount of nuclear poison material, Forty-
eight 20-ft lengths of 12-in.-dia pipe would be
arronged  in six vertical banks connected on

opposite ends with mitered joints. The six banks

of pipe would be connected at the bottom with a

common drain line that would connect with the

fuel system, The drain system would be preheated
and maintained ot the desired temperature with
electric heaters installed in small-diameter pipes
located axially inside the 12-in.-dia pipes. These
bayonet-type heaters could all be removed or in-
stalled from one face of the pipe array to facilitate
maintenance. The entire system would be installed
in an msuiated room or furnace to minimize heat
losses.

The removal of the fuel afterheat would be
accomplished by filling boiler tubes installed be-
tween the 12-in,-dia fuel-contdining pipes with
cold water from a header that would normally be
full.  The boiler tubes would normally be dry and
at the ambient temperature of about 1200°F,
Cooling would be accomplished by radiant heat
transfer from the fuel-containing pipes to the low-
pressure, low-temperature water in the boiler tubes.
For the peak afterheat load, about 150 gpm of
water would be required to supply the boiler tubes,

This fill-and-drain system design satisfies the
design criteria in that it is always in a standby
condition in which it is immediotely available for
drainage of the fuel, it can adequately handle the
fuel afterheat, and it provides double containment
of the fuel. The heat-removal scheme is essen-
tially self-regulating in that the amount of heat
removal is determined by the rate of heat transfer.
Both the water and the fuel systems are at low
pressure, and a double failure would be required

“for the two flvids to be mixed. The drain system

tank could be enclosed and sealed from the atmos-
phere because there are no large gas-cooling ducts
or other major external systems connected to it,
A stainless steel tray would be placed below
each bank of pipes to catch the fuel if a leak

- developed. These trays would be cooled by water

walls to prevent any possibility of meltdown and
destruction of the cell,

DESIGN OF A HYDROSTATIC BEARING FOR A
- MOLTEN SALT PUMP IMPELLER
| B. W. Kmyon

A hydrostatic bearing was investigated for use
as a pilot bearing for a molten salt pump because

16

the pressure of the pumped fluid could be used fo
maintain the centering of the impeller in the pump
casing.  Two designs are possible: one in which

the pockets are located around the .inside of the

bearing ond one-in which. the pockets are on the
impeller. The latter design offers the advantage
that the supply passages for fluid flow to the
pockets are in the impeller and are thus replace-
able. ' '

The chief difference between the conventional _

hydrostatic bearing with stationary pockets and
the bearing in which the pockets rotate on the

impeller is that in the latter case the fluid flow

through a given pocket is variable except when
the impeller is centered, which only occurs under

the improbable situation that there is no side-load

on the shaft. The variation in flow velocity, v, of
the fluid leaving the pockets of the two dessgns is
shown-in Fig. L.1.11,,

The pressure in the pocket achng between the
shaft and the journal is proportional to v2 if the
pockets are stationary, but the proportionality must
be adjusted by an acceleration factor if the pockets
are rotating. The curves of Fig. 1.1.11 indicate
that the load-supporting ability of the two designs

Preliminary calculations for a 16-in.<dia impeller

running at 1175 rpm ond having 12 pockets around

the periphery have been made. The rodial clearance
was taken as 0.015 in. The load capacity per inch
of pocket height is shown in Fig. 1.1.12 as a func-
tion of impeller dlsplacement. Ctrcumferenhal

flow between pockets was neglected in these pre-
liminary calculations. A calculation at one point

indicated - that the circumferential flow would re-
duce the load .capacity about 15% for a bearing
1.5 in. high.. |f the bearing herght were increased,
the relative circumferential flow would increase,
ond the load capacity of the bearing per inch of

henght would decrease, even though the total load

capacity of the bearing would increase, For this
bearing, a flow of 0.137 #13/sec was required with
a power consumption of 1.38 hp (net). These
values are. 1.25 and 0.82%, respectively, of the
flow and power consumption of the pump.

An investigation of the effect of '\./arying the

‘pressure and flow indicated that, for the same

power’ onsumphon, high ﬂow at low pressure

would ‘give more load capacity in the bearmg than

enlarging the orifice would result in a larger load
capacity of the bearing without increasing the
power required for providing the flow for the

FUEL PUMP DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
W. F. Boudreau A. G, Grindell

Pump Design Studies
W. G. Cobb ‘M. E. Lackey

The optimum design of a fuel pump for a
circulating-fuel reactor is, of course, dependent on
the general configuration of the reactor and its
major components. In turn, the design of the
reactor can be substantially influenced by the
pump characteristics. This. mutual interdependence
dictates that pump design must be continuously
coordinated with the general reactor design.

One of the major considerations in the design
of a centrifugal pump is the problem of cavitation,
The onset of cavitotion is primarily governed by
the net total pressure available at the impeller
inlet to lift the salt into the impeller. Cavitation
must be avoided, since it can cause physical
damage to the impeller or to other parts of the
pump. - ‘Cavitation data obtained for fused salt
pumps at ORNL have been studied in relation to
pressures, flow rates, and pressure drops in the
heat exchangers and in other portions of the primary
fuel circuit of the reference-design reactor, These
preliminary studies indicate that five pumps with

the following design parameters will be suitable

for circulating fuel 130 (BeF,-LiF-UF,, 37-62-1

Flow through pump 4950 gpm
Heqd prcduced_ by pump 71 ft
Tempe’rature at pump inlet 1230°F ‘(max)
: Static pressure ot pump inlet 19.2 psia
Pump shaft speed ' 1160 rpm

o

W. Bo .MC,DOHOH .

A pump design is being prepared that is based on
these design values, but it is realized that further
studies of the reactor design may require changes.
It will not be difficult to translate the resulfs of
these studies to pumps of other ccpacmes.

The bdsic" design of an impeller and a double
volute for the pump wos developed that is serving
as the basis for a series of pump layouts. Various
types and arrangements of bearings (salt-lubricated,
oil-lubricated, and gas-lubricated) and seals are
being considered in conjunction with at least two
different motor arrangements (totally enclosed and

‘conventional). These layouts will permit a de-
termination of the most favorable arrangement of |

all elements from the standpoints of adaptability to

‘reactor construction, durability, adaptability fo

remote maintenance operations, reactor operutlonal
problems, and so on,

A number of commercial organizations have built
pumps for use with liquid metals under service
conditions which approach those of the molten
salt reactor. In order to utilize their experience,
study contracts are to be negotiated with several

- manufacturers. These companies will be asked

to study the fuel pump application in the fight of
their own experience and to formulate conceptual
designs that incorporate their recommendations.
Preliminary discussions have been held with
representatives of Allis<Chalmers Mfg. Co.,
Westinghouse Electric Corp., and Byron Jackson Co.

Development Tests of Solf-Lubticdted Bearings
P. G. Smith L. V. Wilson

The fused salt pumps now in use for development
tests have conventional oil-lubricated bearings.
These elements impose restrictions on the design
and construction of the pump, since the bearings

k)

)

- must be shielded from both the heat and the

radiation from the fuel salt in order to avoid damage
to the bearings and to the fubricant.’ The availa-
bility of a satisfactory bearing lubricated by the
fuel salt would eliminate these restrictions and
should permit improvements in pump construction
from the standpomts of reliability and sumpll-
fication.

A survey of extshng knowledge concerning

materials suitable for use in the construction of

salt-lubricated . bearings was made, and it was
found that at least two combinations of materials
showed considerable promise: (1) molybdenum
running against tungsten carbide containing
12.5 wt % cobalt and (2) tungsten carbide con-
taining 12.5 wt % cobalt running against itself,
The coefficients of thermal expansion of these
materials differ from those of INOR-8 and Inconel,
however, and therefore there may be design and

- development problems involved in the use of these

materials.

Two high-temperature beurlng test units are to
be set up. One unit will provide facilities for
testing hydrodynamic (plain journal) bearings, and
the other will provide for the testing of hydrostatic
(fluid piston) bearings. Existing high-temperature
equipment »wili be modified-for use in this test
program.

The design of the hydrodynamic-bearing test

~ unit has been completed, and procurement and

fabrication of parts have been initicted.  This

test unit will utilize a modified sump pump
designed for circulating NaK at high temperatures.
The impeller has been removed, and the shaft has -
- been modified to accommodate the ‘rotating portion ..
of the test bearing ot its lower end. The stationary =~ -
© - element of the bearmg is held by a movable arm
'.;_broughf ‘out: of the pump tank through a bellows
- seal. Vonuble loads can be apphed to the: beanng‘ '
. "by ‘andir. cylmder attached to the outer end.of
- the movabie -arms A callbrated drive motor is used
" in order to obtain data on load vs test-unit torque.
-~ ~The .test’ mformohon ‘that “ will be - obtained is
. _expected to permit a good analysns of the’ behuvior -
of the fused salts of interest-as bearing lubricants.

-~ The theory of the hydrodynamlc bearing has been
Do -well ‘worked out in recent years, and its relative
" ‘mechanical snmplncity tends to facilitate analysis.
“The initial ‘studies -of - the pump design problem:
have indicated, however, that. the hydrostatic’

(fluid-piston) type of bearing may have a number of
advantages for use in fused salt pumps. Among

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

the most important is thar such bearings can
withstand a considerable amount of mechanical
damage without appreciable impairment of their
load-carrying capacity.  Therefore the second
bearing -test unit will incorporate a hydrostatic
bearing. Layout studies indicate that a satisfactory
test unit can be constructed by removing the lower
(oil-lubricated) bearing and seal of another pump
of the type described above and incorporating a
hydrostatic bearing on-the shaft immediately above
the impeller. The impeller will be used as the
source of pressure and load for the bearing.

The novel form of hydrostatic bearing described in
Chap. 1.1, which eliminates complexities associated
with many conventional hydrostatic bearings, will
also be tested. A model that will use water as the
lubricant is to be constructed.

" The combined geometries of the reactor and the

pumps will, of course, determine eventually the
location of the pump bearings. Since salt-lubricated
bearings could be placed at several locations in
the pump, studies of a variety of configurations of
salt-lubricated bearings are being made in terms
of the basic variables, such as diameter, clearance
ratio, and length-to-diameter ratio.

| ‘Development Tests of Mechanical Shaft Seals

i.Development tests of sump pumps with oil-

“lubricated shaft seals that were designed for
circulating high-temperature NaK have revealed

that NaK vapor may diffuse into the seal oil-

Develepment' Tests of OilsLubricated Be_cr.ings(
P. G. Smith . W. E. Thomo_s

The lower bearings for the fuel b'umps'_ may :

possibly be salt-lubricated, as described above,

but oil-lubricated bearings may be required at the
‘upper end of the shaft. The oil in these bearings

could, of course, be damaged by radiation from the
salt fuel. It has been found that the lubricant

Dowtherm A, o eutectic mixture of diphenyl ond .
diphenyl oxide, offers the advantage that it
decomposes into gaseous and liquid products when

irradiated rather than into carbonaceous deposits

hydrocarbon<base lubricants. The principal dis-
advantage of Dowtherm as a lubricant is that it

lacks the property of oiliness, that is, the ublllty

to provide very thin films for lubrication. -

~ An experimental evaluation of the bevh_cvio'r of
Dowtherm A is being condutted in a special high-
temperature sump pump that includes centrifuges

for degassing. The pump is circulating fuel 30
(NaF-ZrF4-UF4,"50-46'4 mole %) at a temperature
of 1200°F; the shaft speed is about 3000 rpm; and
the temperature of the lubricant returning from the
bearing is maintained at 180°F.

The initial test was terminated by failure of the

drive motor after 172 hr of operation. Future tests
will-be on a long-term basis, except that the pump
will be dismantled in order to inspect it for signs

of wear at intervals of 1000 hr. Aside from the
swelling of some O-rings made of buna N elastomer,

no adverse effects attributable to the use of
Dowtherm Aasa iubrlcant have been noted

| Irtqaiuﬁoh and Endurance Tests of
 Bearings and Seals

S. M._ DeCamp - W. E. Thomas

Bearings exposed to radiation fields could be

lubricated with hydrocarbons if it were possible to

limit the dose received by any part of the lubricant
to .a maximum value of about 10 r. In theory, .
this. could be accomplished by changing the.
~ lubricant frequently enough to avoid an excessive
tofcl dose. In practice, it would be difficult to be

certain that all the lubricant was: ‘temoved from the
area of greatest exposure in a sufficiently uniform

manner. Irradlctlon tests have . demonstrated that -

any porﬂon of a hydrocarbon lubricant that receives

an excessive dose of radmtlon will form solid -
- resrdues and (for some types of lubnccnt) OCICIIC

products. Such reaction products could be expected

-to interfere with the removal of the balance of the
lubricant from the irradiated area.

A test unit for investigating this problem in a
practical situation has been set up in the canal ot
the MTR. Spent fuel elements are placed around

~ the seal and bearing area of a test unit composed

of a bearing housing, .a (lower) sleeve bearing, an

- (upper) double-row ball bearing, upper and lower

DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES FOR REMOTE
MAINTENANCE OF THE REACTOR SYSTEM

E. Storto

The cbuln‘y to perform maintenance work on the
primary and ‘secondary systems of the reactor
within the containment cell is of primary importance
to the successful operation of a central-station

_nuclear power plant. Consideration of the problems
‘involved indicates that the most feasible solution

to this maintenance problem is to make all com-
ponents - removable and replaceable by remote

“manipulation and to arrange and interconnect the

components so that the number of replaceable units

"is minimized. Actual repair work on or disposal

of components that had failed would then be

carried out in separate hot-cell facilities set up

for ‘this purpose. The. problems associated with
this maintenance concept have been studied, and’
solutions now being worked out are described in

~ the following sections.

‘Mechanical Joint Development
In order for all components of the reactor to be

removable and replaceable by remote manipulation,
it is necessary to provide a means for remotely

‘separating and ‘joining the pipes which “connect
“the major componenfs of the system. Welded joints

‘course, “and ‘methods for remote - ‘welding and

inspection are being developed -at other instal-
lotions. The difficulties are formidable, however,

and satisfactory equipment and techriques cannot
_be expected in the near future. Attention is

therefore ' being given to the development of a
reliable mechanical joint.

The freeze-flange type of joint shown in

Fig. 1.2.1 is being tested in the Inconel loop

illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.2.2. In this

type of joint, a frozen seal of molten salt is used
to prevent leakage of the salt from the loop through
the space between the flanges. An additional
seal of soft iron or copper rings is provided to
minimize gas leakage during shutdowns of the loop.

Heat transfer from the molten salt in the tubing

to the outer edge of the flange is reduced by
providing a narrow section in the flange, In
addition, there is a channel for air cooling in each
flange. The test flanges are made of Inconel and
are held together with eight quick-opening toggle
clamps, as shown in Fig. 1.2.3.

 During the loop tests, temperatures were

‘measured ot the points lndlcated in Fig. 1.2.4.

Fuel 30, which has a melting point of about 970°F,
was citculated in the loop at a flow rate of 2 gpm.
In the first test the salt temperature was cycied
50 times between 1150 and 1300°F, and then the

loop was operated isothermally for several days

at 1300°F. The average cycle time was 44 min;
a cycle is defined as a temperature variation from

1300 to 1150°F and back to ]300°F. In the second

Gas leakage tests made at room temperature with
a helium leak detector show leakage rates for these
1omts that are below the specﬁ:ed maximum rate of
10~7 cm3/sec. One joint had a leakage rate of

3 x 107 cm3/sec, ond the rate for another was

2.4 x 10-8 cm3/sec.

A flange joint which has ¢ cast-metcl seal
between the two halves has also been designed,
and tests are to be made with two sealing ma-

‘terials: silver and an alloy of 72% silver and 28%
_copper, (see Chap. 2.1 for details of selection of

sealing materials). A seal will be formed by

fusion of the sealing material before the loop is

chorged with salt. The seal material will be in
the solid state during operation. Joints of this

“type are being |ncorporoted into the test loop, as
~shown in Fig. 1.2.2. A diagram of the cast-metal-

HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

J. C. Arn.:os R. E._MacPherson
R,' l.. Senn

Heat transfer correlations for use in predicting
heat exchanger performance are required for the
development of a realistic heat exchanger design.
While standard heat transfer correlations have been
found to be. satisfactory for predicting the heat
transfer performance of some molten salts, the
performance of some other salts has been found to
deviate from'these correlations for various reasons,
For excmple, the . heat -transfer characteristics of

some salts appear fo be critically affected by the

type of material selected for heat exchanger

construction. Also, differences in heat transfer

performance of some salt mixtures have been
attributed to a difference in wetting properties of
the salts, - It ‘is, therefore, essential that heat

~ transfer correlations for the specific salt mixtures

under consideration for use in the - molten salt
reactor be determined experimentally so that
proposed heat exchanger de5|gns can be adequately
evaluated,

Heat transfer coefﬁcnents will be determined

in laboratory-scale single-tube test apparatus

(see Chap. 1.3 of this report), and it has al-

 _ready- been possible - to- obtain pertinent fused
salt heat transfer data from a relatively Iarge-scale
~ heat exchanger test facility that was available,
A schematic flow dlagrcm of -the. test facility is . .
. shown in Fig. 1.2.11,  All ‘components of this
" system are Inconel, and heat is supplled to the
““fused salt by dnrect resistance heating of the
" Inconel tubing. = The heat -is transferred from -
. the- salt flowing in the ‘tubes to NaK flowmg n
_ “the shell side of a 25-tube heat exchanger of the -
. type. shown in Fig. 1.2.12, and heat is removedf _
~ from the NaK by a 500-kw NaK-to-cur heat dump. -
" Salt and NaK flow rates are measured by venturis
T «eqmpped wnh Moore Nullmnnc pressure-measuring -
' 'dewces. The NaK flow rate is also measured with

an electromagnetic flowmeter. All temperatures

"are measured with Chromel-Alume! thermocouples.

The NaK loop is equipped with a circulating cold

trap for control of the oxide content. This test
facility, which is designated Small Heat Exchanger
Test Stand.C (SHE-C), is shown in Figs. 1.2,13
and 1.2.14. “Heat transfer data are presently being

obtained for fuel 130. Other fuel salts will be

tested ‘as required.

The system was calibrated by making a test run
with “fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %),
for which heat transfer data were available. Data
were obtained over a fused salt Reynolds number
range of 425 to 6150 ot temperatures ranging from
1100 to 1300°F. The heat balances obtained were
in good agreement throughout; there was, normally,
agreement to within 2%.

Preliminary ~analyses of data obtained for
fuel 130 are being made. Since the physical
property data currently being used for this salt
were extrapolated from data on other salts, com-
plete correlation of these data with results for
other fluids cannot be made until physical property
data for fuel 130 are determined experimentally.
Approximate  heat transfer coefficients can,
however, be obtained with the current information.
A block diagram showing operating conditions for
a typical heat transfer run is presented in
Fig. 1.2.15. '

The difficulty of accurately predicting liquid
metal heat transfer performance in heat exchanger

" shells may moke desirable the further refinement
. of the fused salt data by substituting a fused salt

of known heat transfer properties for the NaK now
being circulated in the secondary loop. Such a
substitution, if made, would require further
modifications of the test facilities.

planned tests requires at least 15 test facilities,
nine of which were available at the start of the

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

The ovatlablltty of good quality INOR-8 is
improving, 'and two special INOR-8 loops have
been constructed. One of these includes graphite
specnmens and the other includes specml INOR-8
specimens for weight loss studies.

In the weight loss studies an effort will be made
to determine accurately the corrosion rate of
INOR-8 at a wall temperature of 1300°F, when
exposed to a fused salt, by carefully measuring
and weighing the inserts. Provisions will be

- made to assure that the specimens are not exposed

to the atmosphere before and after exposure. Three
samples will be exposed, each for a different time,
in an effort to establish a corrosion rate which
may be extrapolated to operating periods of severol
years.

The loop for the weight loss studies was
designed, as shown in Fig. 1.2.16, to incorporate
the three samples at the hot end of the heater
section with a separate power source to control
the wall temperatures. The samples were machined
to fit inside a sleeve. The samples.and the sleeve

~were fused together at the ends when welded into

the loop piping so that current would pass through
the samples.

The loop which contains graphite specimens will
be examined after operation to determine the

_extent to which graphite causes carburization of

INOR-8 aond the effects of the fused salt on
graphite,.  Specimens of impervious graphite

‘especially prepared by the National Carbon
- Company are being used.” The graphite-specimen

assembly is shown in Fig. 1.2.17. The graphite

by the power failure des'cribed above. Freezing of

the salt ‘in the loop caused a section of the first

heater leg to rupture, This damaged tubing section
and the pump and pump motor have been replaced.
The salt circuit of the loop was refilled with a new

charge of fuel 122, but the original sodium charge’

is being used. - Operation was resumed on January
13, 1958. (The results of examinations of samples

removed from the damaged portion of this loop are

reported in Chap. 2.1 of this report.)

The loops that have been operated or are now'
operating are listed in Table 1.2.2, which also

gives operating data. A maximum pump" speed of

3000 rpm has been established on the basis of test

HYDRdDYNAMIC_ STUDIES OF MSR CORE
F. E. Lynch

The molten salt reactor as presently designed
has a spherical core. Three entrance-exit systems
have been proposed for this core, namely, inlet
and outlet diametrically opposite each other with
straight-through flow, inlet and outlet concentric
with the fluid entering through the inner pipe and
exiting through the outer annulus, and inlet and
outlet concentric with the fluid entering through
the annulus and exiting through the inner pipe.
With each of these entrance-exit systems, stagna-
tion and flow separation are possible in the
spherical core region and could cause excess

heating of the core wals and thermal cycl:ng of

reactor components.

Glass models of each of the 1hree core configura- -

tiens have been fabricated from large (13.7-in.-ID)
Pyrex reaction vessels. Two of the models are

shown in Figs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The straight-

 

Fig. 1.3.1. MSR Straight-Through Flow Model.’

through core has 6-in.-dia entrance and exit pipes.
The concentric system has a 4-in.-dia central pipe
within a 6-in.-dia 90-deg elbow. In the model for
annular flow studies, the central tube is flared

‘outward at the bottom to direct the flow along the

spherical surface.

Initial qualitative data have been obtained for
the concentric system with fluid entering through
the central pipe by using the phosphorescent-
particle flow-visualization technique. Both visual
observation of particle motion within a continuously
illuminated  plane and photographic recording of
instantaneous velocity profiles were employed
obtaining the data. Figure 1.3.3 shows the results
obtained visually at an inlet Reynolds modulus of
80,000 (2.58 fps in the 4-in. pipe). The inlet jet
was of sufficient strength to retain its shape (a
4-in.-dia cylinder) to the bottom of the vessel. At
this point the fluid turned and moved upward in

a‘_l/2~ to %-in.-wide annular region immediately

adjacent to’ the core wall. The volume between
these two flow regions was filled with a large
toroidal ‘eddy, with its axis of rotation lying near
the main upward flow. Because of unsteadiness
in the flow-generating system, the flow patterns

fluctuated. The main effect of these pulsations

was in the structure and size of the large eddy.
During periods of pulsation, the central core of

‘the eddy broke up into two smaller eddies sur-

rounded by the larger rotating mass. It can be

“seen that the eddy removes fluid from the exiting

stream and recirculates this liquid through the
high heat generation regions of the core. If good
mixing occurs, there could result a uniform increase
of the -exit temperature that corresponded to a
longer fluid residence time in the core. However,
there exists a strong possibility that the outgoing
stream will contain discrete fluid bodies that will
be at temperatures considerably higher than the
mixed-mean temperature. Under these conditions,

Several typical mstantuneous proflle photogruphs
of the flow in the concentric system are shown. in

Fig. 1.3.4. Since grid photographs are not avail-

able, quantitative velocety analyses of the data
cannot be made. In all cases the time lapse be-

tween the initial excitation and the recording of

the profile was approximately 0.1 sec. In Fig.
1.3.4a the velocity profile at the exit of the inlet
pipe is shown. The straight light line above the
profile indicates the initial excitation, or zero-time
line. The zero-time line is either dlrectly marked
or indicated by a small triangle near the outer
sphere wall on all the photographs. The profile in
the outer annulus is also visible in Fig. 1.3.4a.
Figure 1.3.4b shows the profile at a position just
cbove the equator of the sphere, and both the

- downward central flow and the upward flow along
the wall may be seen. The effect of flow pulsation

may be seen clearly in Figs. 1.3.4c and 1.3.44 for

excitations at the same position but at different
_times. Figure 1.3.4¢ shows a profile obtained ot

a 45-deg angie near the sphere bottom. = This

MOLTEN SALT HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES
H. W. Hoffman

Heat transfer studies of molten scltsl'z have
indicated that the general correlations for heat
transfer of ordinary fluids (0.5 < NP < 100) also
apply to the salts. -However, these investigations

_have also shown that for some metal-salt combina-
tions marked reductions in system heat transfer

occur because of interfacial film formation and
nonwetting.. Therefore, data.on these phenomena

are needed for the desngn of crmccl heat trunsfer

The apparent heat trunsfer coeffncnenf experi-

One of the problems of a circulating-liquid-fuel
reactor is the provision of reliable iong-lived fuel-
circulation pumps. This problem would be elimi-
nated if the liquid fuel circulated by natural
convection through the reactor core, through vertical
convection risers, and through the primary heat
exchangers. A molten salt fuel is well suited to
such a reactor because high temperatures could be
attained without pressurization, and therefore a
gas-turbine cycle or one of several steam cycles
that operate efficiently under high-temperature
conditions could be utilized. The temperatures
would not be so high as to be inconsistent with
the desired long corrosion life. The advantages
of eliminating the fuel-circulation pump and the
attendant problems of maintenance and replacement
are obtained at the cost of the. increased fuel
volume required for a system in which the pressure
losses must be very low. There are, however,
applications for a reactor system in which the
premium placed on reliability and ease of mainte-
nance could make the natural-convection. system
attractive. The results of a preliminary design
study of such a system are described brueﬂy here,
and a detailed report is being published.”

to sodium to steam. A similar system has been
descnbed elsewhere.? For a 60-Mw thermal output,
" the 850-psia, 900°F steam would give a generator
output of about 22 Mw, with a thermal effncnency
of 37%.

Two sets of terminal temperatures were specified
for the helium coolant. The first set, 850 to
. 1025°F, was selected for generation of 850-psia,
900°F steam in a system in which helium would
be the only intermediate medium between the fuel
salt and steam. The second set of helium terminal
temperatures, 676 to 1100°F, was selected for a
helium gas-turbine cycle with an estimated output
of roughly 18 Mw. '

For a specified flow rate of the fuel salt, temper-
ature change of the fuel salt, and pressure drop
across the exchanger, there is one combination of
riser diameter and height of exchanger above the
core for which the salt contained in the risers is a
minimum. - These optimum combinations were used
in heat exchanger calculations carried out for
exchanger heights above the reactor of 5, 10, and

20 ft.

Salt-Cooled Heat Exchongers ,

Design values for the salt-cooled heat exchanger
are summarized in Table 1.4.1. The designs are
based on 0.634-in.-ID, 0.059-in.-wall tubes. Smaller-
diameter tubes would give a lower total fuel-salt
volume, but the number of tubes required would be

larger. For example, 0.42-in.-ID tubes in an ex-

~‘changer 10 ft above the reactor would involve a

total external fuel-salt volume of 123 #3, but it
would require 7200 tubes .

The design valves presented in Table 1 4.1 are
based on a fuel-salt temperature change of 225°F.

Varying the temperature change from 200 to 250°F

does not change the total fuel-salt volume appreci-
ably. '

that copper fins would be used on the helium-cooled
heat exchanger tubes. The use of lower-conduc-
tivity fins would lead to a considerably increased
fuel inventory. The dimensions given for the heat
exchanger are those for a three-helium-pass cross-
flow exchanger. - Doubling the helium pressure
level to 200 psia while maintaining a pumping
expenditure of 2% of generator output would not
change the total salt volume appreciably but would
give a more compact heat exchanger. A similar
result would be obtained if at 100 psia the pumping
expenditure were doubled. , -

A cross section of a possible helium-cooled heat
exchanger configuration is shown in Fig. 1.4.2.
The configuration shown permits attachment of the
riser pipes to the salt headers, with sufficient
flexibility to minimize thermal stresses, and pro-
vides a cylindrical container for the pressurized
helium. . Use of two such cylinders to contain the
reference-design heat exchanger would give two

The temperature of the helium returned to the
heat exchanger from the gas-turbine-system regen-

below the fusion temperature of the fuel salt.
Therefore a counterflow heat exchanger with
fongitudinally finned tubes was selected for the
gas-turbine cycle. The temperature of the interface

‘between the fuel salt and the tube wall can be

maintained at, or above, any desired value by
adjustment of the gas-side thermal resistance per

tube the required gas-side thermal resistance
variation along the tube length can be obtained by
an axial variation of the fin height. No data were
available on the heat transfer and flow friction
characteristics of longitudinally finned tubes in a

‘tube bundle, and the exchanger designs are thus’

not complete. ‘However, the number of tubes,
length per tube, and fuel-salt holdup volume can
be estimated with good accuracy if it is assumed,
as seems likely, that the same gas-side thermal
resistance is realizable with uncut longitudinally
fined tubes as with circumferentially finned tubes.

Comparison of the Yarious Cooling Systems

The fuel-salt holdup volume differs less than
10% for the three cooling systems considered and
is therefore not a determining factor in the selection

of the coolant medium for the reactor. In general,

the helium-cooled heat exchangers have much
larger over-all dimensions than the salt-cooled
heat exchangers. The increased bulk is caused
by the larger spacing required by the finned tubes
and also by the large volume required by the
helium headers. An increase in helium pressure
would decrease the helium header volume and also
should decrease the fuel-salt header volume. An
upper limit on the helium pressure would probably
be set by consideration of the effects of a tube
rupture in the fuel-salt system. It is of interest
to note that, in other studies of gas cooling in
which such considerations were apparently not
limiting, gas pressures as high as 1000 psia have
been recommended.

Comj:nrison of Natural-Convection System with
Forced-Convection System

The design of a forced-convection reactor sys-
tem? led to an estimate of 0.56 #3 of fuel salt

44

external to a molten salt reactor per thermal

“megawatt. For the free-convection system using

a 160-ft3 external salt volume in the generation
of 60 Mw, the corresponding specific volume is
2.67 3 /Mw. Calculations based on these numbers
and initial, clean, critical-mass data for an un-

‘reflected molten salt reactor indicate that the fuel

inventory for both the free- and forced-convection
systems is ot a minimum with a core diameter of

about 8 ft for a thermal output of 60 Mw. For an

8-ft-dia core the specific powers ar'e'895rand
1275 kw of heat per kilogram of U235 for the free-
and forced-convection systems, respectively. The

- free-convection system is thus estimated to require
‘a fuel inventory about 42% greater than that of the

forced-convection system. With higher thermal
outputs the specific powers would be larger, but

~ the specific power for the forced-convection reactor
increases more rapidly with increasing power than

does that of the free-convection reactor.

HIGH-FLUX REACTORS
W. K. Ergen

A systematic study® was started to determine
the influence of various factors on the power

‘required to obtain a given flux. At the beginning

of the study, a reactor idealized in ‘the manner
described below was considered.?

The fuel is concentrated in a spherical shell
embedded in an infinite moderator; that is, the
moderator occupies the space inside as well as
outside the shell. The shell is “infinitely thin'’
but ‘““black’’ for thermal neutrons; that is, the
thickness of the shell is small compared with its
radius but large compared with the diffusion length
in the fuel. The shell emits nf fission neutrons
for each thermal neutron absorbed. Absorptions
at epithermal energies, both in the fuel and the
moderator, are neglected. In this model, the

fission neutrons emitted from the shell slow down

according to the age kernel® and then diffuse

according to diffusion theory, with the boundary
condition created by the ‘‘black’’ shell.

For this model, it is possible to compute the
number, J, of neutrons which return, at thermal

energy, to the shell per fission neutron emitted.

The neutrons returning to the shell give Jnf fission
neutrons, and if the reactor is to be critical

Inf = 1.

From this equation, the required 75f has been
computed‘ for D20, Be, BeO, and C moderators
and for various values of shell radius. The results
are plotted in Figs. 1.4.3 through 1.4.6. The

abscissa of each plot gives the shell radius, r, in

cm, aond also in dimensionless units p = r/\NT,
where /T is the slowing-down length.

In the sphere enclosed by the shell (the island,

or internal thermal column, or flux trap) the neutrons

reach thermal energies at some distance from the
shell, and, in the process of diffusing toward the
shell, these neutrons set up a flux gradient, which
results in high fluxes at the center. These center
fluxes are also plotted in Figs. 1.4.3 through 1.4.6.
It may be seen that for Be and BeO a flux of 10-3
neutrons/cm? per fission neutron emitted is ob-
tained, which corresponds to about 140 Mw for
10'¢ neutrons/cm?.sec. For D,0 and C the flux
per fission neutron is smaller, and hence the power
required for 1016 neutrons/cm?.sec is higher. This
is primarily due to the large diffusion constants
of D,O and C, which make it possible for the
neutrons to reach the shell without setting up a
very large flux gradient.

The curves are, of course, applicable only to the
idealized model. Present investigations cover the
modifications caused by more realistic assumptions,
such as holes in the shell, finite thickness of the
shell, moderation in the shell, and flux depression
in the flux trap as a result of insertion of absorbing
samples.

D YNAMIC CORROSION STUDIES

Jl Ho Devan

Corrosion experiments are under way for which
thermal-convection loops and forced-circulation
loops were fabricated of Inconel (nominal compo-
sition: 15 wt % Cr, 7 wt % Fe, bal Ni) and of
INOR-8 (nominal composition: 17 wt % Mo,
6 wt % Fe, 6 wt % Cr, bal Ni). As discussed
previously, the test program is being conducted in
three distinct phases,! In the first phase, relative
corrosion properties of 12 fluoride sait mixtures
are being determined in thermal-convection loops
operated for 1000 hr. During the quarter, tests of
Inconel loops were completed for all the salts
except salt 131 (LiF-BeF,-UF ,, 60-36-4 mole %);
four salts were tested in INOR-8 loops, which are
now being examined. As part of phase 2 of the
program, three salts are being circulated in Inconel
loops and five in INOR-8 loops. The tests will be
run for extended periods at two temperature levels,
1250 and 1350°F. In the third and final phase of
the test program, salts are being tested in forced-
circulation loops under simulated reactor operating
conditions. Four salts are presently being tested
in Inconel loops and three in INOR-8 loops, as
described in Chap. 1.2 of this report. The results
of postoperative examinations of these loops will
be described in this chapter as they are completed.

Ten of i'he Inconel loops operated in phase 1 of

the progrom have been examined metallographically,

;'After successful .operation for ‘1000 ‘hr, the salt
mixture - in each’ loop was allowed ‘to freeze in =

~ place. -Samples were then cut from each loop at -

Results of Examination of Samples Removed
from Forced-Circulation Loop CPR

As stated in Chap. 1.2, samples were taken for

metallographic examination from the forced-circu-

lation bifluid loop designated CPR., The samples
were taken from a portion of the hot leg which
ruptured when the salt froze because of a power
failure after more than 6500 hr of operation, A
sample taken from the discharge end of the heated

leg showed no measurable corrosion (Fig. 2.1.6),

but samples taken from near the point at which
the failure occurred, that is, near the iniet to the
heated ‘leg, revealed attack to a depth of 2 mils
(Flg. 2,1.7). The deeper attack at this point was
- probably the result of fuel-contamination near the
“point of failure, The loop was successfully re-
paired and is now back in operation,

most. severely attacked, metallographic specimens

17 from both loops, are compared in:Fig. 2.1.11,
Further tests are being made to determine the
cause for greater attack in loop 30 than in loop 39.
The metallographic examinations did ‘not reveal
any positive signs of carburization in either loop.

Chemical cnalyses of the fuel before and after
the tests did not show any significant changes as

a result of contact with the Inconel and the

graphite. For example, the carbon content of the
as-received fuel was 0.005%, and the carbon con-
tent was 0,018 and 0.024%, respectively, in the

fuel from loop 30 and 39 at the concluswns of the
- tests, . '

~ Chemical analyses for carbon were also made on

~each of three successive OOIO-m.-deep ‘millings

from the inner walls of specimens taken: from the

than 0,0005 in, in fhlckness. In scattered regions
the film penetrated into the specimen along the
graphite particles; the maximum penetration of
this sort was to a depth of 0.005 in.

A microspark analysis of the inner surface of the

'CCN graphite insert showed that the main com-
ponents, in the order of decreasing quontity, were
zirconium, chromium, and uranium and that there
were traces of sodium ond nickel. It is to be
noted, in particular, that chromium and nickel were

detected along with the cations of the salt. A

quantitative -analysis of millings from the graphite
'surface will be made in order to determine which
of these five components are from the metallic-
appearing film and to determine the quantities
present, The results of these thermal-convection
loop tests indicate, however, that at 1300°F the
corburization of Inconel in such systems' is
probably a slow process, if it occurs at all,

Static capsule tests at 1500°F have also been
made in the study of the effect of carbon on Inconel
and INOR-8 (heat SP-16) in sodium, in NaF-BeF -

static tests at 1500°F were primarily to determine
which material, INOR-8 or Inconel, carburized most
readily when exposed to graphite under the same
conditions and to .compare the carburization rates
of the materials in fuels and in sodium.

The specimens used in these tests were small
coupons, 40 mils thick, that were held in graphite
sleeves in Inconel capsules. The metal speci-
mens and the sodium or fuel were loaded into these
capsules under a purified argon. atmosphere and
then sealed by inert-arc welding. ‘ :

Metallographic examinations indicated, as shown

in Table 2.1.3, that INOR- 8 is more susceptible to

carburization than is Inconel under- these condi~
tions. - This is due fo the molybdenum in the

INOR-8 formmg carbides more easily than fhe'

chromium in Inconel, For example, it i$ known

that type 316 stainless steel, which contains 2 to

3% molybdenum, carburizes more readily than
similar austenitic stainless steels which do not
contain. molybdenum.?2  The appearance of the

INOR-8 affér the test is shown in Fig." 2.1.14.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF INOR-8
- D. A, Douglas
Tests are under way for obtaining the basic data
on the strength of INOR-8 required for design

calculations. The confidence level which can be
applied to the data and the varicbles which affect

~ the reproducibility of the data will be defined,

Studies will also be made of the behavior of the
metal under both static and dynamic loadings in
order to more accurafely predict fhe service life
of various component parts,

Since relatively long pericds are required to
obtain. data on ploshc properties, preliminary data

on fensile properties are being. obtained for use -
~in design studies.  The yield srrength at 0.2% - 45 be mVeshgated " Creep tests are therefore

_ expemr-eniel vonohons._ Conventional specimens

0.505 in. in dlumerer are being machined from a
wrought bar so that more accurate values can be
obtained.

The study of the plastic properties of INOR-8
is being made in order to determine whether INOR-8
will deform plastically under reactor operating
conditions. In the relaxation tests used for this
study, a specimen is loaded to a fixed amount of
strain and the resulting elongation is maintained
either by adding to the load or by subtracting from
it. The need to remove the load to maintain the
fixed strain would indicate that the material de-
formed plastically. The results of a series of
tests at 1200 and 1300°F are summarized in Tabie
2.1.10.

The large decrease in stress with time indicated
that the plastic properties of the INOR-8 were
important and that rhe creep strength would have

the specimens exposed to fuet 107 -at 1100, 1200,

~and 1300°F, The status of these tests is pre-

sented in Toble 2.1.11,
Tests were also performed at femperotures con-

‘gislderob!y above the anticipated operating tempera-

ture of the reactor as a means of gaging the damage -

to the metal which might occur through occrdentol

rremperoture ‘excursions. - These - resulfs, are .pre-
-sented in Fig. 2.1.16. '

“Ancther series of resrs will be run in order to

;obrom a siorrshcol estimate of the reproducibility

of‘ creep results from one test to another and from
one heat of material to another. These tests will
be conducted in air at 1250°F,

Metal Seals for Remote-Disconnect Flanged Joints

In the development of mechanical joints that can
be disconnected by remotely controlled mecha-
nisms, it has been necessary to investigate various

‘types of seals. Tests have been made of the

feasibility of heating a sealing material in an

‘annulus to make or break the seal or of pouring

molten metal into a preheated and cldmped flange
assembly, The results of mockup tests of such a

64

joint, designated “‘cast-metal-sealed flange joint,"”
I gn ge | _

are presented in Chap, 1.2, 7

A survey of phase diagrams of possible seal and
flange materials which should be relatively
immiscible in each other indicated that the silver-

nickel system might be useful. Silver and iron
~were found to be virtually insoluble in each other,

and copper and iron possess only limited solu-
bility in each other. It also seems probable that
the silver-copper eutectic alloy, Handy & Harman

alloy BT, which melts at 1435°F, could be used
with iron-base flange materials,

diffusion. The excellent wetting of nickel by
silver in dry helium is indicated by the small
contact angle shown in Fig. 2.1.18, An even
smaller contact angle was found on the nickel|-BT
alloy sample. Metallographic examination of the
silver-nickel interface revealed no penetration of
silver into the nickel after brazing and after sub-
sequent aging for 500 hr at 1200°F. Only slight
penetration of nickel by the silver-copper alloy
was observed ofter aging. The marginal wetting
of INOR-8 and Inconel by silver in dry helium is
illustrated by the contact angle of approximately
90 deg shown in Fig. 2.1.19. The BT alloy ex-
hibited very poor wetting on both INOR-8 and
Inconel. The wetting of iron by silver and the BT
alloy in dry helium was poor and intermittent,

The deposition of an electrolytic nickel plate on
Inconel and INOR-.8 samples was found, however, .
to promote good wetting by both silver and the BT
alloy. The nickel plate was not penetrated by
silver, but there was some solution of the nickel
plate by the BT alloy. The deposition of an
electrolytic silver plate on the electrolytic nickel
plate did not improve the wetting by either alloy,

Aging experiments at 1200°F are now under way

on electroplated materials.

A preliminary sealing test specimen was de-
veloped that consisted of a nickel tube and a
nickel container in which the seal could be made
with silver under a dry helium atmosphere. The
joint was made and broken four times, and the
joint was leaktight after each sealing. Thus there
appears to be excellent wetting of nickel by silver
under repeated heating ond cooling cycles. As

~ stated above, mockups of cast-metal-sealed flange
~_joints ‘are bemg tested fhat uhhze the results of
 these studles. -

preparation of a typical test plate are illustrated
in Figs. 2.1.26, 2.1,27, and 2.1.28. These plates
provide specimens for mechanical property studies
of welded joints ond are useful for radiographic,
metallographic, and hardness studies, as well as
for obtaining general information pertaining to the
welding characteristics of the materials under
conditions of high restraint, A summary of the
status of the evaluations of the INOR-8 weld test
plates made to date is presented in Table 2,1.12
" For hardness studies, samples of the welded
test plates are removed and measurements are
made on the weld metal ond base metal in the
gs-_&vélded “condition and after aging. ' Preliminary
work has consisted of determining the Rockwell B
“hardniess of the two zones, but complete hardness
traverses across the weld heat-affected zones are
"being made to obtain a more complete understanding

70

of the influence of welding. The results of the
preliminary hardness measurements on test plates
38 and 40 are presented in Table 2.1.13. in com-
parison,  the hardness of Hastelloy B and W weld

metals in the as-welded condition is opproxlmately '

20 on the Rockwell C scale, which is approxi-
mately equal to a value of 98 on the Rockwell B
scale.. After aging at 1300°F for 200 hr, the hard-

ness of Hastelloy W weld metal rises to approxi-

mately 32 on the Rockwell C st’:ale,lrwh_ileithat of

Hastelloy B rises to approximately 41,

It may be seen that heat 30-38 weld ‘metal is
slightly- harder in both the as-welded and aged
conditions ‘than Haynes SP-16 weld metal. How-
ever, no significant hardening that can be attributed
to aging is evident for either alloy, Both these
alloys are- consuiercbly softer after aging than

A summary " of material anspechons during the
quarter is presented in Table 2.1.14. The infended

‘usage was the criterion used to determine the type

of - inspection performed and the acceptability.

" Whenever possible the rejected ‘material was down-
- graded_ for less critical applications,

“The - over-all rejection rate for experimental

‘nickel-molybdenum tubing was high, but it varied
considerably from.lot to lot end, in facf -wdas
‘quite low for some lots. Most of the rejections
~ - were due to defects in the weld areq, such as lack
:'of fusion (Fig. 2.1.37), cracks (Flg. 2.1.38), and
_pores (Fig. 2.1.39). The seamless tubing was in

generul of better quality than the. Weldrawn tubing,

and _the Weldrawn tubing was~ of beh‘er quality
“than. fhe us-welded' ‘tubing. A casting made from.
“INOR-8 was re]ected because of large pores, but

the general appearance of the casting indicated
tho_t casting of complicated shapes may be possible
with improved techniques.

Weld Inspection

" Welds are inspected according to the quality
needed, and the three general quality levels con-
sidered at the present time are designated C, CN,
‘ond S, The C type of weld is of reactor quality and
receives visual, penetrant, and radiogtaphic inspec-
tion. The CN type of weld is just as critical as the

C type, but it is in a position such that it cannot

be radiographed. The S type of weld is used in
‘noncritical applications and receives only visual

inspection, The specifications are being revised

to. include a fourth type of weld which will be
designated NC, The NC welds will be used where
a leaktight joint is required but certain deviations

can be allowed. The type of inspection of an' NC
weld will depend on its application.

The amount of penetration allowable on C and
CN welds made on tubing has been increased from
0.025 to 0.035 in., because there was difficulty
in maintaining such a tight tolerance and the test
loop work now in progress does not require such
rigid control.

A total of 131 C welds made on INOR-8 material
was inspected, and the rejection rate was 9%,
which is less than one-half the rejection rate
previously found for Inconel welds. A total of
248 C welds and 197 CN and S welds on other
materials was also inspected, with 57 C welds and
3 CN and S welds being rejected.

Failure Analyses

A Chromel-Alumel thermocouple which failed
after 240 thermal cycles between 800 and 1200°F
in NaK was inspected to determine the cause of
the failure., The thermocouple was encased in a
protective Inconel well, and therefore it was
necessary to locate  the failure by radiographic
inspection. ' A break was indicated on one of the
wires near the thermocouple junction, and metallo-
graphic sections were taken at the failed area.
The  thermocouple wire at the break had necked
down considerably, and thus a ductile tensile
failure was indicated. Since the junction of the
thermocouple had been firmly attached to the
bottom of the well, failure appeared to ke the
result of differential expansion between the
thermocouple wires and the surrounding Inconel
well, '

which, like the m-plle loop, is fobrlcoted of

now being installed on the mockup to demonstrote

tests.

Mechanical mockup tests were performed on a

series of thermocouple leads ‘being consrdered for

service in the coolmg-ctr annulus ‘of the loop. .

Since thermal expansion of the fuel tubes damaged

_ thermocouples in prevnously operoted Ioops, it was

desired to select a design which would prevent
plastic deformation of the thermocouple lead wires.

tudinally during thermal expansion, the thermo-
couple jacket moves longitudinally along its own
axis through the port in the air annulus and through |
the heater assembly, and it moves slightly with
respect to the bundle of lead wires. This arrange-
ment provides a relatively rigid structural member
which does not move with respect to the thermo-
couple wire or the thermocouple bead, and thus

does not apply stress to the thermocouple. Thermo-

couples of this type have survived dozens of
cycles in which the thermal expansion was many
times greater than that expected in the loop.

The -in-pile loop is to include a charcoal trap
for removing the xenon which will diffuse from
the surface of the. fuel. = Any orgomc material
and water present in the charcoal as an impurity
would be decomposed by radiation from adsorbed

fission products, and the decomposition products
- could contaminate the fuel ond interfere with
interpretation of the results of the experiment.

The charcoal used in the loop will therefore be

baked in vacuum for 48 hr at 500°C in order to

decompose organic impurities. The charcoal which
was installed in the mockup loop was subjected
to this treatment. The holdup time of the heat-
treated. charcoal for radiokrypton in a flowing
helium stream was measured to determine whether

‘the heat treatment had reduced the capacity of the
- charcoal for noble gases. It was found that the
. charcoal was 10% more effective as an absorber

to be unimportant except the last one. The

possible effects of traces of tritium in the loop
connot be evaluated with sufficient confidence
to risk operating the in-pile loop under such

conditions. [t was decided therefore to obtain

the best available Li’ for use in the in-pile test.
Lithium containing 99.8% Li’ was obtained and
was used in the production of a batch of fuel 130
(see Chap. 2.3 for production details)., Sufficient

fuel for filling three loops 'is now uvo:lable in

powder form

Preporations are being made in the ORR fo-, :

cilities for the operation of a similar forced-

circulation loop. The loop assembly housing and

lead tube have been fabricated for use in pre-
liminary hydraulic tests of the reactor before
startup. - These tests will show whether the lead
tube is structurally adequate in the reactor cooling-
water stream. The same assembly is being used
for surveys of ‘the flux in the experimental space
designated for this experiment., Conduit trays
and an auxiliary control panel are being installed
to carry lead wires from the experimental assembly
in the reactor to the laboratory, where the controls
for the loop will be located.

IN-PILE STATIC CAPSULE TESTS
H. L. Hemphill

Preparations for the irradiation of fuel 130 in
INOR-8 capsules in the MTR were continued. The
fuel used in these test capsules will be the same

w. E. Browning

as that used in the in-pile thermal-convection

loop. The INOR-8 tubing intended for use in
fabricating these capsules had to be rejected
because of high aluminum content. Another batch

80

of INOR-8 tubing of satisfactory composition con-
tained a large number of flaws. Short sections of
this batch of tubing are being selected for use

in the MTR capsules. The INOR-8 tubing for the

MTR capsules is more difficult to fabricate than
that used in the thermal-convection loop because
of the small diameter and large wall thickness,

- 0.200 in. OD ond 0.100 in. ID.

Other capsules are being fubricdted for irradi-
ation in the MTR in order to determine the stability

 of graphite in- contact with fuel 130 during ex-
posure to radiation. Existing Inconel capsules

are being used for the outer containers. Graphite

liners with 0.025-in.-thick walls have been pre-

pared that have a 0.100-in.-dia bore and are 1 in.
in length. These graphite liners will have o loose
plug at the top end and three small holes near the

~ bottom to allow the fuel to fill the space inside

the graphite liner and the space between the liner
and the Inconel outer can. The fuel will provide
heat transfer between the graphite and the Inconel
wall, and fairly accurate estimates of the graphite
temperatures can be based on measurements of
the temperature of the wall, the thermal con-
ductivity of the grophite, and the heat generation

by fission in the fuel. These'capsules will be

irradiated ot a metal wall temperature of 1250°F.
After irradiation the capsules will be examined

in the Solid State Division hot cells in order to

determine whether the graphite dlsmtegrated I

the graphite is intact, an attempt will be made to

determine the distribution of fuel components and
fission products in the graphite. The grophite
and the Inconel will be examined metallograph-
ically for evidences of corrosion, and the fuel will

be chemically analyzed for carbon and the con-

stituents of Inconel.

In the system diagrom presented in Fig. 2.3.11,
the temperatures of points a and ¢ are 500 and
488°C, respectively. Consequently the LiF-
4LiF.UF, boundory curve temperatures drop from
point a to point c. The temperatures of points ¢
and 4 are 488 and :500°C, respectively. Conse-
quently the boundary curve between the LiF
primary-phase field and the 7Li F-6ThF ,-7LiF.6UF

solid-solution primary-phase field drops in temper--
.ature from point d to point ¢. In addition, evidence

exists (Table 2.3.2) that 4LiF.UF , appears as a

compositions along the boundary curve between the
4LiF-UF , primary-phase field and the 7LiF 6 ThF,-
7LiF-6UF ; solid-solution primary-phase field.
Thus the boundary curve temperatures must
decrease from point & to point c. Point c is, then,

Solubility and Stability of PuF,
' Molten Fluorides

C. J. Barton R. A. Strehlow

Values for the solubility of PuF, in NaF-BeF,
(57-43 mole %) at three temperatures were given in
the previous report.d During the past quarter,
values were obtained for the solubility of PuF
two additional NaF-BeF mixtures, three LiF- BeF2

composmons, and one NaF- LlF -BeF, mixture

ds a function of temperature. The range of BeF,
concentrations covered in each of the binary

solvent systems, approximately 36 to 50 mole %,

includes _the concentration range likely to be of
interest in the MSR program. Binary mixtures with

lower BeF, concentrations have too high liquidus -
B temperatures to be useful at power reactor temper-
atures, and the viscosity of mixtures containing

more than 50 mole % BeF, is too high to make
them attractive. The ternary solvent mixture was
included in the ‘study to permit solubility de-
terminations with a lower BeF, concentration than
would have been possible in the binary systems
at the lower limit of the temperature range studied.

3¢, J. Barton et al,, MSR Quar. Prog. Rep. Oct. 31,
1957, ORNL-2431, p 39.

 

88

The results obtained to date in these studies
are presented in Table 2.3.3. Some of the results
are almost certainly incorrect and will be checked
in new filtration experiments ‘as soon as possible.
The possibility of analytical error was minimized
in most of the doubtful results by repeating the
analysis, either with a new portion of the same
sample or a separate portion of the origineal
sample., Except for the first few samples sub-
mitted for analysis, which were ground but not
sieved, all filtrates were ground either to ~65 or
~200 mesh and mixed thoroughly to avoid the
possibility of inhomogeneity. A possible cause of
the observed discrepancies in the data would be
an error in the measurement of the temperature of

-the liquid salt mixture. A fairly large vertical

temperature gradient is known to exist in the
heated zone occupied by the fused salt container,
and it is possible that the thermocouple was
accidentally shifted in the course of the experi-

‘ments, An additional uncertainty in the determi-

nation of the melt temperatures resulted from the
thermocouple wells in most of the filter bottles
used in these experiments being shorter than the
deéigh"'cu“ed for; the ends of the wells were not
in contact with the melts. Improved filter bottles
that have thinner walled thermocouple wells of
the proper length to permit the " thermocouple
junction to be surrounded by the salt mixture
became available near the end of the quarter and
were used for ‘the last two measurements made,

mixtures. This has been accomplished by de-
termining the plutonium species present in cooled
samples of filtrates and unfiltered residues
produced by filtering mixtures that had been
heated at temperatures of 550 to 650°C for periods
that were usually in excess of 2 hr. The plutonium
compounds present in the mixtures were identified
by petrographic examination, and valence de-
terminations were made by spectrophotometric
examination of dissolved portions of the samples.
Only trivalent plutonium has been found in the
mixtures examined to date. In addition, the bottom
portions of two nickel filter bottles used in
~ filtration experiments were submitted for analysis
after removal of all except a trace of fused salt.
 One sample had been in contact with the NaF-
BeF ,-PuF, mixture ot 600°C for about 2 hr and
the other had contained the LiF-BeF ,-PuF

“mixture at temperatures varying from 500 to 650°8

for approximately 8 hr. The plutonium found in the

two samples amounted to 0.05 and 0.17 mg,
respectively, and could be accounted for by the
trace of fused salt remaining on the nickel. No
evidence of disproportionation of PuF, in fused
alkali fluoride-beryllium fluoride melts under the
conditions maintained in these experiments has
been observed to date.

FUSED CHLORIDES AS SECONDARY HEAT
TRANSFER FLUIDS

R. E. Moore

The physical, chemical, and nuclear properties
of a secondary coolant for a molten.salt power
reactor must satisfy a number of requirements.
The following characteristics are desired:

1. low melting point,

2. low viscosity,

3. high heat capacity,

4. high thermal conductivity,

5. low vapor pressure,

6. stability toward structural metals,

7. -reasonably low thermal-neutron cross section,
8. freedom from activation in a radiation field,

_Fluorldes and chlorides seem to offer the best
~choices among possible salt systems. Melting
points of 300°C and lower can be obtained with
fluoride mixtures containing ‘BeF,, but the
viscosities of these mixtures are hngh. If a low
melting point accompanied by a low viscosity is
to be obtained it is necessary to turn to chloride
systems, )

90

- A large number of chloride systems have been
described in the literature, but, after an elimination
process - based on gross deviations from the
properties listed above, there remained only a few
systems for further consideration. The eutectic
compositions (mole %) and melting temperatures of
these systems are listed below:

Melt.ing

VComposiiion_ Temperature

(°c)
41.7 mole % RbC|-58.3 mole % LiCl 318

© 64 mole % ZnC|2-36 mole % SnCI2 : 171 -
38 mole % KCl—62 mole % SnCl, 180
29 mole % KCI-71 mole % ZﬂCl2 262
23 mole % LiCl~77 mole % ZnCl, 294
47.5 mole % RbCl-52.5 mole % ZnCl, 249

The very low melting points of the last five
mixtures listed would seem to make these compo-
sitions especially attractive. All these mixtures
contain, however, either .‘:'mCl2 or ZnCl,, which
have high vapor pressures, although the pressures

are possibly not high enough to interfere with

pump operation in the coolant circuit. A calcu-
lation of the ideal vapor pressure of the 29 mole %
KCI-71 mole % ZnCl, mixture, based on literature
values for ZnCl,, gave values of 140 mm Hg at

650°C and 1.4 mm Hg at 450°C. The actual

pressures may be somewhat lower than the ideal.
Yapor pressures of the mixtures containing SnCl,

would be expected to be much higher than those'

for mixtures containing ZnCI2 because the boiling
point of SnCl (623°C) is considerably lower than
the boiling pomf of ZnCl (732°C) -

Another 1mportant questlon concerning compo-
sitions containing SnCl, or ZnCl, is the possibility
of reaction with structural metals. Calculations
based on vqlues of free energies of formation?
indicate that considerable reaction may occur,
especially in the case o{:'SnCI2 mixfures. There
is enough uncertainty in the calculdtions, however,
that static corrosion tests should be made. Plans
are being made for experiments in_which Inconel
will be exposed to molten mixtures containing

ZnCl, and SnCl, in seoled containers of fused

silica.

The eutectic composition41.7 mole % RbCI-58.3
mole % LiCl appears to be the most attractive
from the standpoints of vapor pressure and
corrosion. The boiling points of RbCl and LiCl
(1390 and 1353°C) are sufficiently high that the
vapor pressure of the mixture should be negligible
at reactor temperatures. Calculations based on
values of the free energies of formation? indicate
that the mixture should be extremely stable in
contact with Inconel. Thermal-convection loop
tests should be made to determine the rate of
mass transfer. The new low prices of rubidium
salts (quoted by American Potash & Chemical
Corp. at $13.00 to $27.50 per pound) may remove
the cost objection to the use of rubidium chloride.

The treatment of RbCI-LiCl mixtures to remove
water, which is always present in the salts,
requires vacuum drying, grinding, and contacting

with HCl during slow heating. Once the hydrolysis

reaction
Cl= + H,O==0H" + HCI

has proceeded to the right, the reaction is not
readily shifted to the left.®> An apparatus for
carrying out such treatments is to be constructed.

may be safe to expect that the numencal values

Fig. 2.3.15. There is a remarkable increase in
HF solubility with increasing NaF concentration.
Preliminary results obtained for the solubility
of HF in NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %) are
presented in Fig. 2.3.16. Since the liquid structure
of this solvent might be assumed to approximate
that of molten NaF, the value of the solubility of
HF in the NaF-KF-LiF system may be used at
0 mole % ZrF, in Fig. 2.3.17. This curve was
.constructed from solubility measurements of
solvents containing 19.5, 35, 40, 47, and 55 mole %
- ZrF ;. The regions from 0 to 19.5 and from 19.5 to
- .35 mole % ZrF, were interpolated because of the
- high melting points of the corresponding NaF-ZrF
mixtures. The heat of solution of HF as a function
- of solvent composition is shown in Fig. 2.3.18.
_ The curves presented in Fig. 2.3.17 reveal a
50-fold increase in HF solubility as the,Zr'F“
concentration decreases from 55 to 0 mole %. The
heat of solution increases about threefold in the
corresponding composition range. Similar corre-
lations will be attempted as other solvents are
sfudled

The activity, based on the soiid as standard
state, of CeF, in a 1 mole % solution in LiF-
BeF, would be of the order of 10-3; the activity,
based on the solid as standard state, of BeF
in a 70-30 mole % mixture of LiF- BeF, would be
of the order of 10-2; and the’ eshmated ratio of

CoF /aBer is about 1. Since the calculated

eqmllirlum ratio of activities is much greater than
the estimated ratio, it may be concluded that BeO

~ will precipitate before Ce ,0, precipitates. Since

the calculated equrllbrlum I'CI‘I‘IO is so large, most

~of the BeF “will probably precipitate before any

These conclusions are true

do not form solid solutions. if Ce, 05 precipitates
readily it must be as a compound or soiid solution

The activities of UF, and CeF3 are of the order

of 10=3 for a 1 moTe % solution of these two

substances, and a crude approximation of the ratio
aé.F /a} ¢ would give a value of 10-3. Since

this is much smaller than the ratio calculated in

Eq. 5, it is concluded that UO, will precipitate
almost completely before any Ce,0, precipitates.
This conclusion is subject to the condition that
only pure Ce,0, or UO, can precipitate. These
sample colcufahons |I|ustrate the utility of even
crude approximations to the activities of com-
ponents of salt mixtures. The same conclusions
would have been obtained even if the individual
activities had been in error by an order of
magnitude,

Chemical Reactions of Oxides with Fluorides

in LiF-KF
J. H.'Shaffer

Selective precipitation of oxides may be useful
in the development of o svitable scheme for the
reprocessing of molten salt reactor fuels. Ac-
cordingly, the solubility and some selective
precipitation reactions of a variety of solutes are
being studied. In order to avoid complications,
the simple binary mixture of LiF and KF was
chosen as a solvent. _ :

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

On the basis of direct and indirect information
gained from the experiments completed thus far,
the following useful generalizations can be made
regarding the solubility of oxides of uranium,
zirconium, hafnium, rare earths, alkaline earths,
and alkali metals in this solvent:

1. Uranium, zirconium, and hafnium precipitate
as the dioxides and are the least soluble.

2. Rare earths precipitate as R203 and have
very low solubilities.

3. Beryllium and magnesium oxides are slightly
more soluble than the rare earth oxides but are
still quite insoluble.

4. Barium, strontium, calcium, potassium,
sodium, and lithium oxides are more soluble than
the oxides specified in items 1, 2, and 3.

Quantitative measurements of the solubilities of
the relatively insoluble oxides are difficult to
make, because the solubilities are so low as to be
below the direct limit of detection of the radio-
chemical method used. However, extrapolations
have been made in order to estimate the concens-
tration of the particular metal ion remaining in
solution in the presence of some 25% excess
precipitating agent (usually CaO or Na,0,). The
results are presented in Table 2.3.12.

Several separations of solutes appear to be
possible on the basis of the selective precipitation
of oxides obtained in the experiments. The
results of the experiments are presented in
Figs. 2.3.22, 2.3.23, and 2.3.24, which show the
concentration of solutes that remained in the
liquid as the system was titrated by the stepwise
addmon of CaO. For example, Figs. 2.3.22 and

In order to determine the concentration of zir-
conium radiochemically, the zirconium was labeled
with Hf181 and the hofnium was Gssumed to
behave like zirconium. The titration curve shows
the assumption to be sound.

The titration of the mixture Cer-BeF with CaO
is shown in Fig. 2.3.26. From the curve it may be
seen that cerium and beryllium are precipitated
simultaneously but not in definite proportions;
they probably precipitate as o solid solution.
The results are summarized in Table 2.3.13. [t
has been suggested!? that the results of this
experiment indicate that an attempt should be
made to precipitate cerium from the solution by
adsorption on an excess of BeO. Accordingly,
attempts are being made to precipitate not only
cerium but also uranium.

some extent from the restriction that isotopically
pure Li7 must be used. The discarding of the Li7
contained in these fuels after the maximum
allowable poison concentration had accumulated
would place a moderately serious cost burden on
the power produced from a lithium-containing fuel.

Either of two approaches may be used to increase
the utility of the fuel. Fuels from which the

lanthanides can be removed can, of course, be

reprocessed and reused. This presumably is the
case for LiF-BeF y~bose fuels in which the

~ principal residual (nonlonthamde) poisons would
. be primarily elements which are more noble than
~beryllium. - if, on the other hand, the rare earths

cannot be conveniently removed, the lithium must,

"'_'perforce, be removed from the balance of the fuel.
- This is the case for alkali- fluoride melts con-
. taining comblncmons of Inhlum, sodwm, und

potosswm fluorides.
1t would ‘be desirable to be able to remove the

lithium from NoF-KF-LiF . mixtures by o simple

hlgh-tempemture technique and for the product to
be in a_concentrated form ond free from rore-earth
contamination. It may be seen from Table 2.3.14,

 which "shows the free energnes‘of.formahon at
1000°K _of some halides, that somarium halides
“are - considerably more stable than - the corre-

sponding alkali metal haolides. Although, among
the alkali metal halides, lithium forms the most
stable fluoride, potassium forms the most stable

Since Ky is unity,

A value for Ky of 6.2 x 10~% at 1500°K is then

obtained from the expression

~17,100 = RT In K, .

As a crude approximation it may be assumed
that LiF and KCI (the stable pair) have equal
activities. This permits an estimate to be made
of the activities:

It should be noted here that for this example a

measure of the error involved in the calculation

may be seen, since an activity in excess of unity
(using the solid as the standard state) would
indicate precipitation or at least an immiscibility
gap. Since neither of these is known to occur at

1500°K, it would be expected that these valves

450°C with the LiF-KF mixture. The mixture was
then cooled to 150°C to permit the salt to solidify,
and two samples of the molten potassium were
taken.  Although the sampling temperature was
below the consolute temperature for the Li-K
system, it was suitable for any small ratios of
ay /axs A modified metal-sampling apparatus 14
was used which permitted samples of liquid metal
to be obtained under an inert atmosphere. Two
quantities of KCl were then added in amounts of
100 and 300 g. The mixture was equilibrated, and
the metal phase was sampled after each addition in
the manner described above.

Analyses gave values for the three determinations
of Ny ;/Ng = 10=% and of N__ =0, 0.16, and

0.35, respectively. One equilibration of a mixture

of KI-Lil-K containing less than 0.05 mole fraction
‘of fluoride was carried out, and a value of
| NLl/NK

0.35 was obtained. These results
indicate that the estimates described here and
presented in Table 2.3.15 may be accepted as
being of the correct order of magnitude. This
leads to the conclusion that, at probable Li7
price levels, this process is not economically
feasible.

An examination of the results indicates: that,
within the experimental precision achieved, the

'MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

@alcu\qui‘ons are based on the assumption that the--
circulating salt initially contains equilibrium-

concentrations of UF4 UF,, and CrF,, which are

independent of time. In an attempt to compare the

calculated results with results of actual loop
experiments, a study was made of four thermal
loop experiments '7 in which Cr3! was utilized to

trace the chromium mlgrcmon patterns within the
loops. Several important points regarding the use

of radioactive tracers in loops were noted in the

course of this work and are described below, since

they will be of definite value in investigations of
corrosion in polythermal loop systems. An outline
of the experimental conditions for the four loop
tests is given in Table 2.3.18. Three of the four
experiments, as indicated in Table 2.3.18, were

conducted with Cr31 initially present only in the

salt, as Cr*F_, ‘The results of these first. three
‘experiments, in which Cr® was initially absent

- from the walls, do not give a direct indication of

the over-all chromium migration pattern as a
result of corrosion. To illustrate this point, a
combined plot of the experimental data for the
first three experiments of Table 2.3.18 is shown
in Fig. 2.3.29. If it is assumed that the loop wall
distribution patterns for Cr® and Cr coincide, it
could be concluded from Fig. 2.3.29 that the zone
of maximum deposition of chromium as a result of
the reversal of the corrosion reaction is near
section A. By mass-balance calculations, A is
between the zones of maximum chromium corrosion
or depletion, C-C’ and the zones of maximum

deposition as a result of corrosion, B-B% _In

-other words, the loop wall distribution patterns for

The original invesfigatérs” have suggested that
the shape of curve 2 is of greater significance
than are the shapes of curves 1 and 3, because the
loop operating time for the data of curve 2 was
400 hr as compared with 125 and 288 hr for curves
1 and 3, respectively. The salt .in loop No. 3

- was, however,. pre-equilibrated for 192 hr before

operation. It would seem that, if the secondary
maximum of curve 2 were truly significant, the
other two curves should have shown some tendency
toward the initial formation of such a maximum.

mechanism whereby the relative amount - of
chromium deposited at a point suddenly jumps
from a constant valuve of 30% of the ‘maximum to a
valve of 75% of the maximum after 288 hr of
operation. Calculated Cr31 distribution curves for
this type of experiment under conditions of perfect
pre-equilibration of the -salt have the shape
exhibited by curves 1 and 3. They also have a

constant shape with respect to time when plotted -

on a relative basis. The theory on which these
calculations were based is outlined below.

The Cr% distribution under any experimental
procedure is governed by two chemical equilibria
at the wall surface, the most important of the two
being the wall exchange reaction

Accordingly the wall-
surfoce chromium concentration at the balance
points is- equal to the original chromium concen-
tration in the alloy.

In addition to the chemical equilibria at the
surface, the Cr%* (and Cr® wall distribution is
governed by the concentration of Cr®* (and Cr°)
initially in the interior of the walls as a result of
the solid-state diffusion phenomena that are
characteristic of metals at high temperature,
Since linear diffusion in a semi-infinite medium is
involved, the distributions also depend on the
square root of the -diffusion coefficient, D, for
chromium in Inconel. The diffusion coefficient is
practically the same for Cr® and for Cr%, and the
value is very sensitive to temperature changes.

A combination numerical-schematic steady-
state example similar to conditions of the third
experiment and involving the various chromium
concentrations in three loop sections is presented
in Fig. 2.3.30. Equations 1 and 3 were used to
prepare the example. It was assumed that, at

the walls along the entire loop, regardless of the
sign or value of the other flow rates, and (2) the
Cr® diffusion rate is highest in the high-temper-
ature region,. since (dM/dt)Cro, is proportional to
(AC o,oD‘/z) and D172 jncreases with temper-
ature. It may be concluded that experiments
similar to the first three listed in Table 2,3.18

. 4, the observed potentials are reversible with
_ . respect to temperature changes,

5. there is no difference of potential between
two apparently identical electrodes.

The first condition has been met by all cells
tested. Also, mechanical agitation of the elec-
trodes has had no effect on the observed emf. The
cells have also returned to their equilibrium
potentials within 30 min ofter all four electrodes

have been shorted together. In most cases, the

electrodes are within 2 mv of their equilibrium
potential within 5 min after shorting for as long
as 15 min. It was found that concentration cells
in the nickel-chromium system were not readily
~ reversible with respect to temperature changes.?!

tentials at 800°C for 15 days and for 6 more days
at 700°C. It is planned, in the future, to ascend
and descend the temperature scale between 750
and 1000°C with all cells. .
The criterion of reversibility, however, has been
the cause of the early termination of several cell
experiments. Each cell as presently run contains
two alloy electrodes (usually of different compo-
sition) and two pure nickel electrodes that were
annealed at 2200°F for 16 hr after fabrication.
in general, one nickel electrode becomes erratic
either shortly after the start of a run or after
behaving properly for as long as 12 days.
Potentials as high as 70 mv have been observed

between two nickel electrodes which two days:
previously 'had been behaving properly ond

exhibited no potential difference. = Cells con-
taining four nickel electrodes from different
sources are now being run in an effort to discover

the cause -of this anomalous behavier, No

PRODUCTION OF PURIFIED MIXTURES
Jq Po Blakely Gl J- Ness‘e
Preparation of Pure Fluorides

Some transition-metal fluorides of high purity
were prepared for use in studies of corrosion,
chemical equilibria, and phase relationships,
ond for use as reactants in the preparation of
other flucrides, including complexes. Nearly a
kilogram each of ferric, ferrous, nickelous, and

cobaltous fluorides were prepared. Ferric fluoride

was prepared by passing anhydrous hydrogen
fluoride gas over anhydrous ferric chloride at about
300°C. For preparing the ferrous, nickelous, and
cobaltous fluorides, the commercially available
hydrated chlorides were partially dehydrated at
about 100°C and treated with hydrogen fluoride
at about 400°C,

Small+Scale Purification Operations
C. R. Croft
The experimental facilities were used for the

processing of 530 kg of salt mixtures in 55 batches
that consisted of 5-, 10-, and 50-lb quantities..

Twenty-eight of these batches were materials that
g+ Included in the total were 11
batches of the NoF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture for use

by the Metallurgy Division.

Requests for molten ‘salts and especrally for
BeF ,-bearing mixtures have reached a level which
is beyond the production capabilities of the
experimental facilities. It is anticipated that the

250-1b-batch production equipment will be operated
at intervals during the ‘next severul months to
e 'prowde the material reqmred ;

“Four. batches totaling 270 kg of LIF-Ber-UF‘

- mixture were prepared during a trial run of thef'
~.250-1b- batch production equipment for two weeks

of the equipment under the conditions of this test

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

was not feasible. It will, apparently, be necessary
to enclose the equipment and to provide an
improved ventilation system before its continued
use can be odjudged saofe in all procticable
circumstances.

Anclyses indicated only 3 to 4 wt % uranium in
the final product, rather than the 6.4 wt % charged
to the reactor. ' Examination of the residue in the
reactor showed high concentrations of uranium as
UO,. It is apparent that contact between HF
and the liquid in the large reactor was insufficient
to remove H,O and BeO from the mixture and that
precipitation of UO, by the reaction

UF, + 2BeO —>UO, + 2BeF,

resulted. Experiments are under way to develop
a modified technique for preparing satisfactory
material with this equipment. Most of the available
material con be used in experiments for which the
precise compositions requested are not essential.
