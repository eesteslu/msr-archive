M. Blander L.. G. Epel A. P. Fraas R. F. Newton

ABSTRACT

The basic physical properties ond thermodynamic constants of aluminum chloride have been
calculated to obtain the data required for engineering calculations of thermodynamic cycles
employing aluminum chloride vapor. The possible corrosion problems invelved were evaluated
from the standpoint of basic chemical thermodynamics, and it was concluded that high-nickel-
content alfoys would contain aluminum chloride satisfactorily.

The advantages of gaseous aluminum chloride as an intermediate heat transfer medium in a
molten-salt-fueled reactor were evaluated. It was determined that the temperature range of the
molten-salt heat transfer system was too low to utilize aluminum chloride effectively. A gas.
turbine cycle employing aluminum chleride as the working fluid and a binary vapor cycle employing
water vapor for the lower temperature cycle were also considered. Meither of these studies showed
aluminum chloride to have outstanding advantages. It is believed, however, that special appli-

cations may be found in which it will be possible to exploit the unique characteristics of aluminum

chloride.

 

INTRODUCTION

Gaseous aluminum chloride appears to be attrac-
tive as a heat transfer medium and as a thermeo-
dynamic-cycle working fluid as a consequence of
the fact that it exists as the monomer AICI, at
high temperatures and as the dimer A|2C|6-ct fow
temperatures.  The effective specific heat and
thermal conductivity of a gas that associates are
considerably enhanced because of the association
equilibrium at temperatures ot which there is an
appreciable fraction of both monomer and polymer,
and therefore aluminum chloride may be an excep-
tionally good heat transfer medium for some
applications.  Its possibilities as the working
fluid in a thermodynamic cycle stem from the fact
that, in an idealized gas turbine with a negligible
pressure drop in the system, the pump compressor
will require work proportional to the compressor
inlet temperature times the specific gas constant
of the dimer for any given pressure ratio. In the
high-temperature region at the turbine, on the other
hand, if the gas is completely monomeric, this
same weight of gas will do work proportional to
the turbine inlet temperature times the monomer
gas constant for the same pressure ratio. Because

of the relatively large difference in the gas constant
between the monomer and dimer, the ratio of
turbine work to compressor work will be greater
than for a gos that does not dissociate. Further,
the energy losses due to the inefficiency of both
the compressor and the turbine will have relatively
smaller effects on the over-all thermal efficiency
with a dissociating gos as the working fluid.

BASIC PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF
ALUMINUM CHLORIDE

The objective of this study was to investigate
the possible advantages of aluminum chloride
arising from its dissociation and the consequent
increase in effective specific heat and thermal
conductivity. Qualitatively the reason for these
increases is simple. Lowering the temperature of
the gas will yield not only the heat given off if
the composition of the gos were ‘‘frozen,”” but,
since the gas is more highly associated at lower
temperatures, it will also give off the chemical
heat due to the association of some of the monomer
molecules as a result of lowering the temperature.
The same phenomenon increases the thermal
conductivity.  The thermal conductivity is the
amount of heat that would be transferred in unit
time across unit area from a temperature T + dT
to 1 divided by the temperature gradient, d7/dx.
The frozen thermal conductivity is that which
would occur if the composition were frozen at an
average weight fraction @ _ of the polymer and w,
of the monomer at both temperatures. Since w,
is higher at 7 + dT and w_ is higher at T than the
average, relatively more monomer would diffuse
from T +dT to T and more polymer from 1" to T +dT
than for a frozen composition. The composition
of the higher-temperature gas molecules diffusing
to the lower temperature would change with a
trend toward the lower equilibrium concentration
of monomer at the lower temperature and would
give off heat in the process. This chemical heat
contribution is part of the heat flux.

THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the gaseous phase the state of an equilibriuvm
mixture of AlCl, and AICI, is determined by any
two independent properties, and knowledge of the
thermodynamic state makes it possible to determine
the thermodynamie properties. The two independent
defining properties

volume were temperotuwre and pressure. The
relations used in the computational procedure are
summarized below.

As an illustration of the possible corrosion

chromium and nickel in a system in which gaseous
aluminum chloride is circulated at temperatures
in the range 500 to 1000°K is discussed here.
The most likely corrosion reactions involving
chremium are:

circulated, if reaction A were the only significant
one, it would take a minimum of 2 x 109 moles
of aluminum chloride gas to move 1 mole of CrCl
from the hot zone and deposit it as solid CrC|2
in the cold zone. The fact that the aluminum
metal produced in reaction A might form a solid
solution with the metal wall in the reaction zone
would increase the initial portial pressure and
transport of CrCl,. After an initial deposit of
aluminum metal had formed on the surface, the
reaction would yield a smaller partial pressure
of CrCl,, with diffusion of aluminum into the
metal in the hot zone being one controlling factor
for this partial pressure if reaction A were im-
portant. Not only is the initial activity of chro-
mium in an alloy lower than that of the pure metal,
but the depletion of the surface chromium concen-
tration would further lower the activity of chromium
at the surface and, hence, lower the maximum
partial pressure of CrCl, in the circulating gas
at the hot end. This would lead to a smaller
transport of CrCl, from the hot to the cold zone.
The chromium concentration on the reaction
surface and, hence, the corrosion rate, would then
be controlled by the diffusion of chromium to the
surface in the hot zone. This diffusion would be
a second controlling factor if reaction A were
important.

This pertial pressure is higher than that which
would be present above a chromium-containing
alloy in which the activity of the chromium was
lower than the activity of pure chromium metal.
The partial pressure of Cr(:l2 from reaction B is
higher than that from reaction A. Reaction B
should be, therefore, the important corrosion
reaction and should result in the transport, at the
very most, of about 2 x 107 mole of chromiym
per mole of circulating gas. At the low-tempera-
ture zone, CrCl, will initially deposit as the
solid, AICI will disproportionate according to
reaction C, and a small concentration of aluminum
will deposit on the surface of the alloy. After a
small activity of aluminum is built up in the metal,
the reaction at the low-temperature zone should
be the reverse of reaction B, with chromium metal
being deposited on the walls, At the hot zone,
after the surface chromium has been depleted, the
reaction will be limited by the diffusion of chro-
mium from the interior of the metal to the surface.
If reaction B is important, this diffusion of chro-
mium fo the surface at the hot zone will probably
be the rate-controlling step in the transport of
chromium metal from the hot to the cold zone.
l.owering the temperature of the hot zone would
decrease the rate of corrosion, mainly by lowering
the diffusion rate of chromium. The formation of
an adherent nonmetallic film on the surface that
is not attacked by aluminum chloride would also
decrease the corrosion rate,

The corrosion of nickel would be much less
severe, The reactions significant for nickel
corrosion are:

At the low-temperature zone, the reverse of re-
action E will probakly take place, and nickel
metal will deposit on the surface. The limiting
factoer in the corrosion of nickel from an alloy
composed principally of nickel would be the total
volume of gas passing over the surface. One mole
of nickel would be transperted per 6 x 10% moles

of gus at 1 otm passing the surface at 1000°K.
One mole of AICH, transports roughly 20 keal of
heat in going from 1000 to 500°K, so about 1 mole
of nicke! would be transported per 1.2 x 1010
keal, 1.4 x 107 kwhr, or about 600 Mwd of heat.
The transport corrosion of iron and molybdenum
as minor constituents of an alloy should be less
than that of chromium,

In conclusion, corrosion of an alloy composed
mainly of nickel and contoining some chromium
might not be negligible for long-term operation of
a system circulating gaseous aluminum chloride
at temperatures in the range 500 and T1000°K, but
the corrosion would be small enough for short-term
operation of such a system. The corrosion rate
could be decreased considerably by operating with
the hot zone of the loop at temperatures lower
than the 1000°K for which these calculations were
made or by the formation of an oxide coating on
the surface of the metal. The estimated values
of the thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and
viscosity indicate that aluminum chleride may be
a unique gaseous heat exchange medium that
requires very low pumping power. It should be
emphasized that these cre crude estimates based
on a limited amount of data of varying degrees of
reliability. Although a conscious attempt has been
made to moke these estimates conservative, some
of the estimates should be checked experimentally.

ENGINEERING PROBLEMS OF SOME
TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

Where cluminum chloride vapor is used as «
working fluid in a thermodynamic cycle or as a
heat transfer medium, the pressures and tempera-
tures must be carefully chosen to exploit to the
fullest the extra performance obtainable from
dissociation. MNormally a temperature range will
be defined by the structural strength of the metals
in the system or by other considerations, such as
corrosion, so that the only variable available to
the designer will be the pressure. This meons
that the pressure level must be chosen with care
to give the best over-all system design. It is
likely that it will be necessary to compromise the
design of other components if the fullest benefits
are to be derived from the use of aluminum chloride.

Aluminum Chloride as a Heat Transfer Medium

A typical applicetion for which aluminum chloride
may have promise is as an intermediate heat

21
transfer fluid between the fluoride fuel of a molten-
salt-fueled reactor and the steam generator. The
use of a gas rather than a liquid in the intermediate
loop would facilitate removal of the heat transfer
medium; it would not be necessary to design the
system to avoid the presence of low spots which
would present difficult drainage or scavenge
problems. It would make possible the placing of
flanged joints in cool zones at the top of the
system and outside of the heat exchanger pressure
envelope so that leaks of the molten fuel into the
aluminum chloride would be contained within the
pressure envelope. The pressure required, namely,
20 to 60 psi in the aluminum chloride, would
present no serious structural problems in the
design of the containing vessel. From Fig. 4,
which is a plot of data obtained from Eq. (7), it
is evident thot there would be no solid aluminum
chloride precipitated at the temperatures and
pressures prevailing in a molten-salt-fueled re-
actor. . Aluminum chloride would have the ad-
vantage as a heat transfer fluid thot it would

be chemically inert relative to either the molten
salt or water. This would make it desirable from
the hazards standpoint and would give o system
relatively insensitive to leaks between any two
sets of fluid; that is, a small leak from one
system into another would not lead to the formation
of a set of deposits which would be very difficult
to remove. |t would be necessary, of course, to
make the steam generator, as well as the fuel~
to—aluminum chloride heat exchanger, of arelatively
expensive high-nickel-content alloy.

The principal disadvantage of this arrangement
is that it would require a larger amount of heat
transfer surface area and a higher pumping power
than would be the case for an inert molten salt,
for example. However, it would have a major
in that there would be no freezing
problem in the intermediate heat exchanger circuit.
The freezing problem presents exceedingly dif-
ficult design problems if a fluid such as sodium
or NaK is employed as the intermediate heat
transfer medium.

advantage

The temperature range for such an application
is lower than is desirable in that the heat transfer
surfaces for the molten salt would be at about
1100 to 1200°F, while those inthe steam generator
would be at 700 to T000°F. As may be seen in
Fig. 1, this temperature range is below that which
gives the maximum obtainable average effective
specific heat if the pressure is maintained high
enough (30 to 100 psi) to keep pumping losses to
acceptable levels,

Aluminum Chioride Vapor in a Gas-Turbine Cycle

The features of a gas-turbine cycle utilizing
aluminum chloride deserve special attention. The
cycle contemplated is indicated schematically in
Fig. 5. The pressures and temperatures should
be chosen so that the gas will be mostly in the
form of A|2CI(, during compression, while during
the expansion process it will be mostly AlCI,.
This, in effect, will cut the compression work
roughly in half and thus produce a marked improve-
The naoture of this
effect can be visualized readily by examining the

ment in cycle efficiency.

Rankine cycle utilizing water vapor was included
in Fig. 6 to show that the proposed aluminum
chloride cycle is between a gas-turbine (or
Brayton) cycle utilizing helivm and a Rankine
cycle utilizing water in its requirements for work
input during the compression process.

The diagrams of Fig. 6 were prepared for ideal
cycles with no allowances for losses. The most
important of these losses are associaoted with the
efficiencies of the compressor and the turbine,
which are likely to be of the order of 85%. This
means that, with an 85% efficient compressor, the
ideal work input will be 85% of the actual work
input, while the actual work output of the turbine
will be only 85% of the ideal. in addition, pressure
drops between the compressor and the turbine will

readily in Fig. 7. It should be emphasized that
the shaded portions of these diagrams are merely
propertional to the losses they represent and thot
the actual paths

If allowances are made for these losses to
obtain the actual net outputs for the cycles of

large work input required for the compression
process of the Brayton cycle makes the cycle
efficiency very sensitive to compressor inlet
temperature because the compression work in-
creases rapidly with temperature. As a result, the
net work output and over-all cycle efficiency of
the Brayton cycle drop off so rapidly with in-
creasing temperature at the compressor inlet that,

temperature must be held below 150°F if con-
ventional working fluids are used. At the same
time, the turbine inlet temperature must be at
least 1200°F, and preferably should be above
1400°F if there is to be an appreciable positive
net area for the P-V diagram.

The wunusual properties of aluminum chloride
make it possible to go to higher compressor inlet
temperatures than with other fluids. The effects
of variations in both the compressor inlet tempera-
ture and the compressor pressure ratio are indicated
in Fig. 9 for a turbine inlet temperature of 1540°F,
While this temperature is high by steam power
plant standards, the much lower pressures in the
aluminum chloride system reduce stresses suf-
ficiently to compensate for most of the temperature
difference. In any event, it is necessary to go to
peak temperatures in this range to take full od-
vantage of the unusual properties of the aluminum
chloride. Itisevident from Fig. 9 that the aluminum
chloride vapor cycle should be designed for a
compressor inlet temperature of around 540 to
640°F and a pressure ratio of 20 to 40. Further
lowering of the compressor inlet temperature will
do little to enhance efficiency, since at 540°F
most of the gas is in the dimer state already.

A point of interest is that it was found in the
cycle analysis that during the compression and
expansion processes there was little change in
the percentage of the gas dissociated. This will
simplify the design of compressors and turbines
for such an application.

The hect transfer coefficient for the aluminum
chloride is sufficiently high for the high-pressure
portion of the cycle, and therefore good heat
transfer could be cobtained in a reactor core. |In
the cooler, however, the heat transfer performance
of the aluminum chloride would be poor, and a
large surface area would be required. The poor
heat transfer coefficient of aluminum chloride in
the cocler stems from the fact that the pressure
at the turbine outlet would be only approximately
1/10 otm, and this would give a low Reynolds
number. The pressure ahead of the turbine, on
the other hand, would be 20 to 40 times greater,
which would give heat transfer coefficients corre-
spondingly higher.

coclant or as an intermediate heat transfer fluid

for a molten-salt-fueled reactor, it appears that a
binary vapor cycle employing aluminum chloride
in the high-temperature portion and water vapor in
the lower-temperature region ought to be con-
sidered. Such a cycle would resemble in many
ways the binary mercury vapor~steam cycle which
has been used in a number of U.S, power plants.
It would have the advantage that it would permit
operation at high temperctures (which would be
advantogeous from the thermodynamic standpeint)
while avoiding the expense associated with the
high pressures characteristic of high-temperature
steom cycles. While there are a host of different
combinations of conditions that might be employed,

a typical case is presented in Table 5. The
aluminum chloride would be expanded through a
turbine similar to that described above. The
cooler for the aluminum chloride would also serve
as the boiler and superheater for the steam sys-
tem. It may be seen from Table 5 that this system
gives a very much higher over-all thermal efficiency
than is obtainable from the gas-turbine cycle
alone. A corresponding steam system designed
for a pressure of 2400 psi and a peak temperature
out of the superheater of 1050°F would give an
over-all thermal efficiency of about 38%, some-
what less than the efficiency that the typical
binary vapor cycle chosen would attain.

CONCLUSIONS

Thermodynamic data have been prepared and are
presented in the form of tables and charts to
facilitate engineering calculations on systems
employing aluminum chloride vapor either as a
heat transfer medium or as the working fluid in a
thermodynamic cycle. A number of typical appli-
cations have been considered, but in none of these

26

has the aluminum chloride shown outstanding
advantages over more conventional media. How-
ever, it is believed that for some special appli-
cations it may well prove to have some outstanding
advantages where the characteristics of the other
system components are such as to make it possible
to exploit to the fullest the unique characteristics
of aluminum chloride.
