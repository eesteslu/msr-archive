SUMMARY
PART I. MSRE DESIGN, COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT, AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS

1. MSRE Design

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment is a logical extension of the program con-
ducted at ORNL during the past ten years in the investigation of molten fluoride
mixtures and container materials for circulating-fuel reactors. The major objec-
tives of the MSRE are to demonstrate the safety, dependability, and serviceability
of a molten-salt reactor and to obtain additional information ebout graphite in an
operating power reactor.

Conceptuel designs of the MSRE have been made in which the core is construc-
ted of vertical graphite stringers in which fuel passages are machined. Flow of
fuel is two-pass through the core, with downflow through an annulus along the
core~vessel wall and upflow through the moderator passages.

The heat-removal cycle is from fuel salt to & secondary coolant salt to air.
No control rods are needed because the fuel has & temperature coefficient of re-
activity of approximately -4 x 1077 (ak/k)/°F.

A dusl-purpose sampling and enriching system is provided for the removal of

- samples for chemical analysis or the addition of enriched fuel. This sampler 1is

located at the pump expansion volume.

In the design of the core, consideration was given to the Poppendiek effect,
and the flow passages were designed to minimize the resulting temperature rise.

The primary heat exchanger is designed for 10-Mw duty. It is a conventional
U~tube heat exchanger in a 25% cut baffled shell. The fuel is in the shell and
the coolant salt is in the tubes. : R ,ﬂ}' - -

2. Component Development
A program of component development and testing in support of the MSRE design
is designed to improve the reliability of the freeze flanges, freeze valves, sam-
pler and enricher, gas-handling system, and fuel and coolant pumps.

A facility for thermally cycling freeze flanges between room temperature and

1400°F was designed, and febrication is nearing completion. This facility will
also be used to test improved gas seals for the flanges.

Two freeze valves, which have no moving parts, are being fabricated for test;
one of these is heated by electrical resistance heaters, and the second is heated
by a high-frequency induction coil.

The problem of the removael of fuel semples and the addition of enriched fuel

1s being studied. Test equipment is being fabricated to test the feasibility of

using a metal freeze seal that can be broken and remade whenever the sampler and
enricher system is used.

‘Febrication of a one-fifth-scale plastic model of the MSRE core is nearing
completion. The model is to operate with water at 40°C with a flow of 50 gpm.
This simulates the MSRE fluid velocity and Reynolds number.

Work is continuing with the remote-maintenance development facility. Follow-
ing operation with molten salt, disassembly, and reassembly, an eveluation of the

-tools and procedures was made. These were found to be generally satisfactory, al-

though some suggestions for improvement have resulted.

Operation of forced-circulation corrosion loops continued. Nine INOR-8 loops
and two Inconel loops are in operation. Operating times range from 3000 to 18,000
hr.

An engineering test loop is being designed and will be constructed to evalu-
ate such components as the sampler and enricher, gas-handling system, duel drain
tank, freeze valves, level-indicating devices, and heaters. The system will
operate isothermally at temperatures up to expected maximum MSRE temperatures.

Design and testing work on the MSRE primary and secondary pumps continued.
Design of a water test was completed and fabrication started. Procurement was
started for some pump components. :

A layout of the primary pump was completed and is being reviewed. Analyses
of the thermal stresses in the pump and the nuclear heating in the structural
material are being made. An experiment was designed to determine the extent of
back diffusion of fission gases up the pump shaft to the region occupied by the
oil seel.

Testing of in-salt bearings continues. The pump which incorporates this
bearing development has operated for 3000 hr and has undergone 63 stop-start
tests.

3. Reactor Engineering Analysis

Graphite undergoes shrinkage at MSRE temperatures in a neutron flux of ener-

gies greater than 0.3 Mev. Calculations were made to determine the effects of

this shrinkage in the MSRE core. Both axial)l and transverse shrinkages were taken
into consideration. co

An analysis was made of the temperature effects in a graphite-moderated core
with round and flat fuel channels. The hot spots resulting from the Poppendiek
effect were found to be considersbly reduced in the case of the flat channels.

The effects of completely blocking e fuel channel were analyzed; results indicated
that if one fuel channel in the region of greatest power density were completely
blocked, the fuel temperature in that channel would probably rise no more than
4O0°F above the mixed-mean temperature in adjacent open fuel passages.

Reactor physics calculations were performed for the MSRE. For a cylindrical
core 54 in. in dlameter by 66 in. high, graphite-moderated with 8 vol % fuel salt
containi h mole % ThF), the calculated critical loading was 0.76 mole % uranium
(93. 3% ), the associated critical mass in the core was 16 kg of U 235, At a
reactor power of 5 Mw, the pesk power density in the fuel salt wa i 60 w/cc and the
average was: 2h w/cc. The computed peak thermal flux was 3.6 x neutrons/cm?-
sec, and the average was 1.2 x 1013, Gemmae heating produced a power density of
0.1 w/cc in the core wall at midplane and 0.2 w/cc in the support grid at the
bottom of the core at the reactor center line. The fast flux (above 1 Mev) in the
center of the 2-in.-square graphite blocks was calculated to be about 2% less than
the value at the edge in contact with the- fuel channel.

An analog-computer enalysis weas mede of the loss of flow in the MSRE primary
system. For this study the primary flow was decreased exponentially on periods of
1.5, 3, 6, and 10 sec. No after-heat, convection cooling, or moderator tempera-
ture coefficient of reactivity was simulated in this analysis.

Using a temperature eoeffieient of reactivity of -9 x 10’5(Ak/k)/°F,tM@ flow
vwas @ecreased from 100% to zero. On the 10-sec period the maximm fuel tempera-

ture leveled off at 1375°F after BO sec. Using a temperature coefficient of -4.5
x 1072 (&k/k)/°F, the temperature leveled off at 1445°F after 80 sec.

established to improve bonding, which calls for oxidizing the ends of the graphite ‘g,J
prior to brazing.

Welding and back-brazing procedures are being developed for tube-to-tube- -
sheet joints for the MSRE heat exchanger. A seven-tube sample has been fabricated
successfully which contains trepanned areas on both the welded and brazed sides
and includes a braze-metal sump with feeder holes in the tube sheet. This mini~
mizes the effect of different heating rates for thick and thin metal sections,

All the mechanical-properties data for INOR-8 were reviewed in order to es-
tablish design values for the alloy. Design stresses for temperatures below
1050°F were selected on the basis of two-thirds of the 0.2% offset yield strength.
Above 1050°F, the design stresses were based on the stress to produce 1% creep
strain in 1.05 hr., A table with the selected design strengths for temperatures up
to 1LOO°F is included.

Tensile tests were performed to determine the effect of low cree§ strains on
the strength and ductility of INOR-8. No effects were observed that could in- g
fluence the structural integrity of resctor ccmponents made from INGR-B

_Tests on specimens from selected lpcations,and orientations in large«pieces
of R-0025 end MH4YILm-82 graphite indicated relative uniformity within each grade of
(1) epparent densities and (2) permeation by molten fluorides at 150 psig in
100-hr exposures at 1300°F.

Permeation of S-4 and AGOT graphite with LiF-BeFo-ThFy-UFy (67~-18.5-14-0.5
mole %) at 1300°F at pressures of 25, 65, and 150 psig in 100-hr exposures indi-
cated that (1) there were small differences in salt permeation of these grades
for the different pressures used and (2) actual and theoretical salt permeations
were practically the same except for the 25-psig permeation of grade S-4. Grades
S-4 and AGOT, respectively, are moderately low- and high-permeability grades of
graphi te.

A single series of five precipitation tests was made with AGOT graphite and
molten LiF-BeFo-UFY (62-37-1 mole %); only the volume of the graphite was varied
in order to determine the relationship of graphite volume to uranium precipitation.
For volume ratios of graphite to fuel of 27:1 to 5:1, the uranium precipitated per
cubic centimeter of the bulk volume of the graphite remalned approximately con-
stant and averaged (1.3 + 0.4) mg to (1.3 - 0.3) mg.

Additional tests were made in order to confirm data indicating that the
thermal decomposition of NH4yF-HF removes oxygen contemination from graphite to ' -
such an extent that it could contain molten ILiF-BeFo-UFy (62-37-1 mole %) at
1300°F without causing the usual U0, precipitation from the fuel.

No carburization was detected on unstressed INOR-8 specimens after exposure
to LiF-BeF5-UF), (62-37-1 mole %) - grephite system for 12,000 hr at 1300°F. ,

5. Chemistry

A fuel composed of LiF-BeFp-ThFy-UF) (65-30-4-1 mole %; m.p. 1+50°c)',hasfbeen
selected as representative for the MSRE design work, but there is a strong possi-
bility that 5 mole % of ZrFl, will be included as an oxide scavenger in a revised.

dicate that ZrOp is more insoluble than UOp, and thus provides protection against
the precipitation of UOp as a result of accidental contaminations with oxide. —

The coolant composition, LiF-BeFp (66-34 mole %; m.p. 465°C), affords a low
viscosity in combination with a suitable melting point.

Treatment with hydfééén as a means of-remévihé oxide from graphite proved
relatively ineffective. The rate of permeation of graphite immersed in a wetting

" salt is slow, at least in the later stages, presumably because gas trapped in the

graphite voids can be replaced only as fast as it leaves by diffusion through the
salt.

6. Engineering Research

The surface tensions of two NaF-BeFo (57-43 mole %) mixtures have been de-
termined to fall between 200 and 150 dynes/cm over the temperature range 500 to
800°C. A 6% discrepancy between the two measurements may relate to differences
in contaminant content of the two samples due to differences in exposure time in
the circulating loop from which the samples were drawn. The results are in rea-
sonable agreement (although somewhet lower) with data obtained with an NaF-BeF,
(63-37 mole %) mixture. An analysis of the precision of the measurements indi-
cates that residual effects due to errors in pressure and geometrical measurements
have been reduced to about *3%; however, & large uncertainty (as much as an addi-
tional *3%) still remains in the salt density as used in evaluating the data.

Corrections to the originsl data and the inclusion of more recent results
have yielded a revised correlation of the mean heat cepacity of BeF,-containing
salt mixtures.

Heat-transfer studies with LiF-BeF,~UF)-ThF) (67-18.5-0.5-14 mole %) in
Inconel and INOR-8 tubes have been interrupted after 5560 hr of operation to re-
place the circulating pump. Damage sppears to be restricted to the upper shaft-
bearing. Analysis of the salt (pre- and post-operational) shows a composition
differing from the nominal composition; this will necessitate a re-evaluation of
the data using corrected values of the thermal properties.

T. Fuel Processing
Preliminary studies indicated that ThFi in molten-salt reactor fuel may be

decontaminated from rare-earth fission products by dissolution of the rare-~earth
fluorides in SbF5-HF.. The LiF of the fuel must be removed first, by dissolution

in HF, to.grévéht'precipitatioprof;thé'ahtimnny, probably as LiSbFg.

PART I. MSRE DESIGN, COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT,
AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS

1. MSRE DESIGN

1.1 INTRODUCTION

The concept of using molten fluorides, one of which 1s UF) with highly enriched
uranium, as a liquid fuel for reactors has been actively studied at ORNL for about
ten years. Many design studies have been made, and one reactor was constructed and
operated successfully as a high-temperature low-power (~2.5 Mw) reactor experiment,
the ARE.

Much experimental work has been done on phase diagrams involving molten fluo-
ride fuel systems. The work included some in-pile as well as many out-of-pile
experiments in which test loops of circulating fluoride melts were operated for
thousands of hours with substantial imposed temperature differences in the loops.
This work, most of it under the ANP program, has developed fluoride-fuel technology
to a point where it is ready for serious consideration for high-temperature power
reactors.

Container material has also been the concern of an extensive metallurgical
program for about ten years. Stainless steels, Inconel, Hastelloy, and other
alloys have been studied for corrosion resistance to the molten fluorides; the
experimental reactor, which was run successfully, employed Inconel. While the
corrosion resistance of Inconel was adequate for a short-term experiment, it was
considered to be unsatisfactory for long-term service.

INOR-8, an alloy, was developed specifically for compatibility with the fluo-
rides. This alloy was made into components for pumped test loops, and thousands of
hours of corrosion tests were performed. Here also some in-pile as well as many
out-of-pile tests were run, and it was concluded that INOR-8 was a satisfactory -
material for the construction -of the components of a high- temperature, molten-salt-
fueled reactor. .

Having esteblished a satisfactory fuel and satisfactory container material,

uthe next ‘question concerned the kind of moderator which would be acceptable for
_-such & system. ' Theoretical calculations, -for which no experiments were performed,
 indicated that the fluorine in the salt could be employed, thus making possible al
o howogeneous molten-fluoride reactor system._ Many design studies were made of
, this concept. : : ' '

It was obvious that, while a homogeneous system vas possible, the neutron

"',,economy of this type reactor was such as to preclude any serious attempt at th

breeding. Therefore some studies, both theoretical and experimental, were begun n

" order to determine the possibility of ‘employing unclad graphite as a moderator for
' the fluoride-fuel reactor. An estimate of the breeding potential of the graphite

moderated molten-salt reactor can be found in an ORNL report.1

 
 

 

 

- the provision of poison addition (e.g., ThFu) if desired.

Compatibility tests between graphite and the fluoride fuels were run, and no \HJ
chemical incompatibility between graphite and the fluorides was found. While some
fuel penetrated the graphite sample, it was also determined that (neglecting the
effects of radiation)not more than 1 vol % of the graphite would be permeated if
especially low permeability graphite were used.

In view of the favorable results of the long development program on materials,
the design and construction of a molten-salt reactor experiment has been initiated.

1.2 MSRE OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of the MSRE are to determine whether a molten-fluoride,
circulating-fuel reactor system can be made to operate safely, dependably, and ser-
viceably. By this it is meant that no credible accident can endanger personnel,
that the system is capable of achieving a very high percentage of operational time,
and that any component can be removed from the system and a replacement made, per-
mitting return to normsl operation. _ -

, The reactor will, however, provide answers to many questions of importance to

future molten-salt reactors. It will provide long-term irradiation tests of fuel, i
INOR-8, and graphite under actual service conditions. From the behavior of graphite

with respect to the absorption of fuel and fission products, important questions

with regard to the feasibility of breeding in molten-salt reactors can be answered.

1.3 CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS

The reactor consists of a cylindrical vessel in which a graphite matrix con-
stitutes about 885 of the volume. Fuel enters the vessel at an annular volute
around the top of the cylinder and passes down between the graphite and the vessel
wall. A dished head at the bottom reverses the flow and directs it up through
rectangular passages in the graphite matrix into a dished head at the top, from
which it goes to the suction line of a sump-type pump mounted directly above and
concentric with the reactor vessel. Flow through the reactor is laminar, and the
passage width is narrow enough to prevent an excessive Poppendiek effect. The
reatangular passages were chosen because they gave, with the design flow, a much
lower hot-spot temperature than did cylindrical fuel passages. From the pump dis-
charge, the fuel flows through the shell side of a cross-baffled tube-and-shell
heat exchanger and thence to the reactor inlet.

I

The tube side of the primary heat exchanger contains the secondary coolant, |
which is also a binary fluoride melt (LiF-BeFp, 66-3k mole %). This fluid is eir- | : |
culated by a sump-type pump through the tubes of the heat exchanger and through the ' |
tubes of an air-cooled radiator. Air 1s blown across the unfinned tubes of this ' o
radiator and up a TO0-ft stack by two axial blowers. A basic flow diagram of the
primary and secondary salt systems is shown in Fig. 1l.1.

Control of this reactor is quite simple and does not call for internal control
rods of any kind. Fast control is effected by the volumetric temperature coeffi-
cient of the fuel, which produces a temperature reactivity coefficient of approxi-
mately -4 x 10-5 (Ak/k)/OF. Slow control is accomplished by fuel enrichment, with 1 |

posed designs of the freeze flanges and the freeze plugs are now under construction,

~ Heating of the primary and secondary salt systems will be accomplished by means
of electrical heaters around all lines and components of these systems; several types
of commercial heaters have been studied. It now appears that the heaters will be
locally constructed, and Inconel or stainless steel pipe will be used. Designs of
these units are being made, and tests will be run to verify the advisability of using
this kind of heater.

, The off-gas system has been plsnned as a recirculating system, to minimize the
consumption of inert cover gas. Holdup capacity for radioactive decay and filters

for cleanup of the gas will be incorporated. Provision is made for continuocus ex-

haust through charcoal beds to the stack, in case the recirculation system fails

- at any time.

The fuel dump tank must be provided with heat for keeping the clean fuel molten
‘and must have cooling available to remove afterheat from radicactive fuel. The tank
is provided with electric heaters similar to those on other parts. of the salt cir-
cuits. Cooling is provided by means of thimbles penetrating the tank through the
top; the thimbles have coolant tubes inserted in them which are spaced away from
the thimble wall. -The coolant tubes will be filled with water which will be boiled
by the radiant transfer of heat from the thimble walls. :

1.4 THE REACTOR CORE AND VESSEL

The physical structure of the reactor consists of a containment vessel; an
inner, open-ended INOR-8 cylinder serving both as a separating baffle for the cool-
ing annulus and support for the graphite core; the composite graphite-moderator
matrix with positioning and support members; and various flow regulating devices.
Figure 1.2 shows the concept of the reactor. Significant geometrical and flow
chargcteristics are listed in Table 1.1l.

A heat-generation rate of 0.2 w/cc in the INOR-8 wall of the reactor vessel
requires a heat removal of 23 kw. The wall cooling will be accomplished by the fuel
flowing along the wall. Turbulent flow is desirable in the annulus in order to mini-
mize the Poppendiek effect. With the design flow rate of 1450 gpm in the l-in.-wide
cooling annulus, the Reynolds modulus is 13,500, and the temperature of the outside
wall surface is less than SOF sbove the bulk stream temperature.

The moderator graphite of the core is built up from 2 x 2 x 66 in. stringers.
The size (area) of these matrix stringers is limited by the size of impervious
graphite available at present. The stringers are pinned in beams at the bottom
of the core. A graphite band will hold the matrix together, and an INOR-8 yoke
is provided for centering. A coarse screen prevents possible graphite fragments
from leaving the core.

If the graphite is packed tightly in the inner can at room temperature, the
differential expansion between the INOR-8 and graphite will open a radial clear-
ance of 3/16 in. at operating temperature. It is expected that the fast- -flux dis-
tribution in the core may tend to cause radial bowing in the graphite. In order
to reduce the nuclear effects of bowing and shrinkage, the graphite stringers will
be banded over the middle two quarters with molybdenum bands.

Flow passages in the matrix are provided through rectangular channels machined
into the faces of the graphite stringers (see Fig. 1.3). The tabulated channel
dimensions provide a fuel volume fraction of 12%. The specified channel configura-
tion is the product of intensive studies into the temperature effects associated
with the relatively slow flow through the core (about 2 fps). These effects are

rather severe with wide channels. The radial temperature gradient of a circular

channel providing 10% fuel volume in a 2- x 2-in. graphite section is 357 times

as large as that of a O.1-in.-wide channel with equal fuel fraction. With the
~ selection of the present 0.200-in.-wide channels, the graphite temperature at the
midpoint will be ~40°F above the mixed mean temperature at the nuclear center of

the core. This problem is treated more fully in Chap. 3.

It is expected that complete blocking of one fuel channel would raise the
temperature of the fuel in the channel about 680°F above the level of adjacent
channels. '

_ Provision will be made for the removal of five graphite samples from the
center of the core. These full-length samples will be lifted out through the
- suction line and the pump bowl.

1.5 THE PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER
' The primary heat exchanger is being designed (Fig. 1l.4) for a duty of 10 Mwto
be transferred from the fuel salt to the secondary coolant salt. Pertinent data
of the preferred design are given in Table 1l.2. _

The design of the heat exchanger follows the configuration of conventional
25%-cut, baffled shell-and-tube units, with greater emphasis on reliability and

the range of baffle pitches of 0 2 to 1 0 shell diameter, where the methods of Kern

“~have’ good accuracy.

The stresses in the heat exchanger have been analyzed. Because of the low-
pressure operation, mechanical stresses are significant only in the tube sheet.

 
 

 

10

With a 50-psi pressure differential on a 16-in.-dia flat plate, 1.5 in. thick,

the estimated stress is %000 psi. In order to minimize thermal stressing of the
plate, which would be additive to the mechanical stresses, a thermal baffle is
placed sbout 2 in. from the tube sheet. This baffle will provide a stagnant layer
of salt, reducing the thermal gradient across the tube sheet to ~200F. The stif-
fening effects of the stream-separating baffle in the tube-side header would induce
high localized stresses if attached to the tube sheet. For this reason, a laby-
rinth seal is provided at the tube sheet, and the baffle is welded to the dished
head.

While mechanical stressing of the tubes is insignificant (only ~ 228 psi hoop
stress), stresses due to thermal gradients across the wall may reach 6500 psi at

the fuel inlet end. However, the combined stresses remain well below the T700-psi

level allowed for a metal temperature of 12250F, which is the maximum design tem-
perature for the fuel.

A tube-to-tube-sheet joint of the welded and back-brazed construction is being
tested to determine the tube-sheet thickness required in the present exchanger.

The first specimens appear to have produced sound joints.

Two other heat exchanger configurations were also investigated. An axial-
shell-flow exchanger having closely spaced tubes was rejected on the basis of
expected manufacturing difficulties. A second loosely spaced heat exchanger with
similar flow pattern would have resulted in a much longer unit, not suited to the
limited space in the reactor pit.

1.6 RADIATOR

In the salt-to-air radiator the thermal energy of the reactor is rejected to
the atmosphere. The radiator will occupy a part of the existing air duet in Build-
ing 7503, and its over-all dimensions are so tailored that it can be installed in
the available space. The physical design concept is shown in Fig. 1.5, and the
design data are listed in Table 1.3,

The heat transfer design is based on Curves by Kays and Londonh for the air
side and on data previously reported.2 The performance of the heat exchanger
under reduced load conditions is presently under study to determine the most effec-
tive method of power control.

Several features were incorporated in the design as protection against freez- <_ | =
ing of salt in the radiator tubes: :

1. Large-diameter tubes were used.

2. The heat rate per unit area was kept low by using bare tubes oﬁ-the air
side to take most of the temperature drop in the air film.

3. The lowest design temperature of the bulk salt is 185°F above the freez-
ing point.

4, An elaborate headering system is proposed to ensure even flow distribu-
tion between tubes.

5. Studies are under way to provide adequate heating of the radiator should
one or more tubes freeze accidentally.

The after-heat in the fuel salt requires cooling in the drain tanks if the
fuel is dumped a short time after shutdown. Considering time lags in the drain-
ing procedure, it is unlikely that the tanks would receive the fuel less than
15 min after shutdown. Accordingly, the heat removal rate of 100 kw would main-
tain bulk-salt temperatures below 1350CF during the decay period. To make the
heat removal as nearly uniform as possible throughout the tank, 40 immersed
bayonet coolers are used, with boiling water as coolant. Water cooling was
selected above gas, molten salt, or NaK because of its simplicity and relative
independence from utilities failures. To further enhance the reliability of the
fuel drain system, two identical tanks will be provided: one in use, the other
in standby. Double-wall separation is used between the salt and the water. (It
appears that the induced thermal stresses are not excessive, although further in-
vestigations will be made.) The thimble design is shown in Fig. 1.6, and the
fuel-drain-tank system is shown in Fig. 1.7. '

The fuel drain tank, filled with salt but without cooling thimbles, would
have a multiplication constant of about O.44. Even if the cell is flooded with
water (e.g., as an emergency cooling method), the multiplication constant would
reach only 0.77.

1.8 EQUIPMENT ARRANGEMENT

The equipment arrangement for the MSRE has been developed on the basis of the
followlng eriteria:

1. All equipment that contains fuel is to be replaceable by remote mainten-
ance.

2. Equipment that contains coolant salt is to be replaceable by direct
maintenance. '

3. The primary fuel loop is to be located in the existing 2h-ft-dia contain-
ment vessel in Building T7503.

k., The fuel storage tanks are to be located in separate containment.
5. Only vertical movement of the fuel-circulating pump should be permitted.

Several studies of possible layouts have been made, and the following conclu-
sions have been reached: From the standpoint of piping stresses, the most favor-
able arrangement is to mount the pump on top of the reactor, with a minimum length
of piping from the reactor to the pump suction. A minimum of 3 ft is required by
the hydrodynamics of the pump. It is also desirable to anchor the coolant piping
close to the pump so that expansion of the parts of the coolant system outside the
pPrimary-loop containment vessel does not affect the stresses inside the vessel and
so that the differential thermal-expansion stresses imposed on the fuel system by

the coolant piping are minimized.

The arrangement shown in Fig. 1.8 and 1.9 has been developed on the basis of
the above criteria. The reactor is placed in the southwest quadrant of the con-
tainment vessel, with the fuel pump mounted on top. The heat exchanger is aligned
with the pump discharge. The reactor is supported near the top, and the pump is

suppbrted above it, using spring hangers. The heat exchanger is mounted so that
it is free to move away from the reactor and is also free to move vertically. Pre-

“liminary studies indicate that the above layout will minimize the thermal-expansion

stresses. Detailed stress analyses of the layout under several operational condi-

 tions are to be completed before the layout within the containment vessel is

finally accepted.

'The'drdin tanks are being located in a new pit placed northwest of the reactor

: containment vessel. This location was selected after attempts to place the tanks
in the existlng deep pit southeast of the reactor containment vessel indicated that

there was insufficient space. Conneetions to the tanks are being designed to per-
mit weighing the tanks. ' ' C :

1.9 DESIGN OF COVER-GAS SYSTEM
The functions of the MSRE cover-gas system will be to

1. remove fission-product gases from the pump-bowl vapor space on a .
-continuous basis;

2. help minimize radiation damage to the fuel-pump lubricating oilxby
minimizing diffusion of fission-product gases into the oil system;

3. minimize contact of the fuel with oxidants by maintaining an inert-gas
' blanket in fuel storage tanks, transfer tanks, sample systems, and
freeze flanges;

4, provide a supply of inert gas in sufficient quantity and at the required
pressure level so as to permit purging of the reasctor fuel system prior
to startup and to permit the transfer of fuel by means of inert-gas
pressure;

5. determine the feasibility of an inert-gas recycle system;

6. minimize the release of radioactive gases into the cell enclosure when
the fuel loop is opened up for maintenance or inspections; and

7. provide an off-gas system similar to that at the HRT, whereby fission-
product gases may be disposed of directly if desirable or necessary.

Tentative specifications which have been established for the cover-gas
system are as follows:

1. meximum flow rate of inert gas to the pump bowl, 5000 liters/day, STP; 

2. maximum 02 concentration in inert gas supply, 1 ppm by volume;

3, maximum activity in inert-gas supply, 0.59 x 107 w/cmB; and

4, minimum supply of inert gas available at sll times, based on normal
purge rate, T2 hr.

Calculations based on work by Nestor5 indicate that the equilibrium act1V1ty
of the fission gases in the pump vapor space will be about 0. 16w/cm§ when opera-
ting et 10 Mv with a 5000-liter/day gas purge. Lindsey's data® indicate that a

of the inert. gas to the p01nt where it will be acceptable for re-use as purge

gas (i.e., 0.59 x 102 w/cm }.. Charcoal adsorber beds have proved to be a simple
and effective means for dynamic holdup of fission gases at the HRT,7 and it is
expected that they will be utilized in the MSRE cover-gas system for recycle and
for biological disposal. However, due to the necessity for storing large volumes
of gas, initial concepts provide for splitting the holdup time so that about T70%
is taken care of by the charcoal beds and the remainder by the storage tanks.
Figure 1.10 presents a simple schematic diagram of the proposed system. The im-
portant components are a volume holdup and cooler, charcoal beds, gas compressor,
and storage tanks. The system provides for a delay of 1 hr in the volume holdup
and coocler to permit a reduction of the rate of decay-heat emission before pass-
ing the material into the charcoal beds. From the charcosl beds, which are de-
signed for a 17-day xenon holdup, the gas is pumped into the storage tanks to a
meximum pressure of 500 psig. Ten tanks are provided, each capable of holding a
full day's supply of gas.

From the storage tanks, the inert gas mey be fed to the pump bowl or to the
transfer and buffer systems. An oxygen-sample system and an oxygem-removal sys-
tem will be provided to control the oxygen inventory. If the oxygen concentra-
tion is held continuously at 1 ppm, a meximum of 16 g of uranium per year could
be oxidized to UO,. It is hoped to maintain the oxygen level at somevhat less
than 1 ppm.

1.10 DESIGN OF THE REMOTE-MAINTENANCE SYSTEM FOR MSRE

To date, the accomplishments of the Maintenance Equipment Design Group con-
sist principally of (1) gathering information about the job and what is expected
of the group, (2) developing a plan of attack on the maintenance problems, and
(3) assigning of specific jobs and scheduling the work of the group to suit the
over-all project schedule. During this period, work has been done on the plan-
ning and scoping of the maintenance for the MSRE.

The design of maintenance equipment for the reactor requires that the main-
tenance operations be carefully planned and that definite procedures be outlined
for the removal and replacement of any component in the primary system. This re-
gquires, in addition to tools for specific purposes, that general tools be designed

- to take. care of certain possible unanticipated failures

_ There are three zones (Flg._l ll) in which components must be maintained
although remote maintenance is required in zone I only. ‘Zone I consists of two

~ hermetically sealed -containment pits: (1) the primary-system pit, which con-
- tains the reactor vessel, the fuel pump, and the primary heat exchanger; and (2)
" ‘the drain-tank pit which contains two- drain tanks end the flush tank. Zone II
- "consists of a large: stainless~steel—lined enclosure into which the zone I pits
_open when their sesls are ‘broken and in which sre located the remote handling

tools. Zone III consists of the remainder of the operating part of the building,

',3 specifically, the radlator area and the main entrance area.

Outline of the planned malntenance of reactor components in zone I is in

. progress. Briefly, it consists in removing and storing faulty components and in-
- stalling new components. The planning for these. operations also involves pro-
'-3viding tools for unsealing the pits; disconnecting, bagging, and handling the

faulty components as well. as providing an adequate storage space and the means
for moving the components into the storage space. Finally, it involves the de-
sign of the means for introduction of new components through air locks into zone
II and the means of handling, installing, and connecting the new components.

As presently conceived the reactor-cell seal can be broken by men working

rn"ifln ‘direct contact in zone II _after the fuel has been dreined into. the drain tanks
- &and the system flushed with barren salt. - After the cell sesl is broken, the '
’._“shielding material located within the sealed zone must be handled” by remotely

operated equipment.  The disconnecting, begging, removing to storage, installing
of new components, and replacing of shielding will be done remotely. The seal can
be replaced by direct control; however, decontamination equipment must be provided
for cleaning zone II before the welder re-enters to seal the pits.

 
 

 

 

22
As presently planned, the remotely controlled equipment for maintenance of
zone 1 components will consist principally of

1. a manipulator of the General Mills 300 type which shall have several
locations from which it can be operated;

2. a crane {or cranes) located in zone II but with access to all pit'com-
ponents from above (particular study is being made on how best to avoid
crane failure); ‘

3. a remotely operated air-lock truck for moving components through the air
' - lock;

4. viewing equipment consisting of television cameras, direct-viewing
shielding windows, and periscope equipment; ‘

5. specisl portable lighting equipment to augment the area lighting; and

6. some specific tools for definite jobs such as loosening the freeze-
flange connections and disconnecting electrical and gas lines.

The remote-handling equipment in zone II must also be maintained. Direct-

contact maintenance is planned for this. The air-lock area will be used for main-

tenance of all this equipment except the crane. Provision will be made in the air
lock for decontemination of the equipment before it is repaired. The crane will
be moved to the north end of its bay for maintenance.

Maintenance operations in zone III include handling of new system components
before they are introduced into the air lock and upkeep of the components in the
radiator area. At present it is planned that the existing 30-ton crane will re-
main in the building and will be confined to operation in the northern end of the
building. Incoming components can be handled by this crane and placed in the air-
lock truck. The rediator, pump drain tank, and piping for the radiator system can
be maintained by contact maintenance if a relatively short time is allowed to
elapse after the reactor is shut down. This area will require a hoist capable of
lifting the components and moving them to the area just inside the existing door
in the south end of the building.

An outline of the arrangement of the operating area of the building and
specifications for the major handling tools to be purchased are receiving imme-
diate attention. _ .

1.11 MODIFICATIONS TO BUILDING 7503

Several building modifications are required to provide for safe and depend-
gble operation of the reactor. Interior modifications are of prime concern, al-
though new exterior facilities such as filter pit, cooling tower, holdup tanks,
and retention pond are also required.

The interior changes affect the existing reactor vessel, penthouse-radiator
area, air duct to the stack, and storage-pit areas. These areas will be modified
for the installation of the primary and secondary reactor components. Shielding
walls and roof slabs, new supports, and structural alterations are required. Ex-
cavation within the crane bay and next to the existing reactor vessel is required

-in order to provide & new shielded pit for reactor drain tanks.

Secondary containment to provide protection against the spread of contamina-
tion during meintenance operations will be accomplished by the construction of a
large air-tight enclosure within the existing crane bay and over the reactor ves-
sel, hot-storage pit, and drain-tank pit. OSupporting facilities include decontam-
ination, air-lock, change-room, and crane-maintenance areas. Painted sheet metal
on light steel framing (stainless steel floors and walls in certain areas) will be
considered for the enclosure. :

Bullding services will be modified and expanded. A liquid-waste system will
be provided for all areas of possible contamination. This system will permit
liquid waste to be diverted to the retention pond, soil column, or holdup tank,
based on its activity level. The water activity of the hot-storage pit will be
regulated by & recirculating system capable of removing major contaminated par-
ticles and solubles.

Air-handling systems in the existing building will be modified, and a new
system will be installed in order to control the conteimment-enclosure environ-

ment. Cooling requirements for the building, contaimment enclosure, reactor ves-

sel, and radiator area present the need for a cooling tower. An air-drying system
will be provided to service the contaimment enclosure during certain maintenance
operations. Handling requirements for the containment air also call for a filter
pit for exhaust air and a small stack for discharge to the atmosphere. Reactor-
radiator cooling will be accomplished by modifying existing blower units.

Existing diesel units will be modified to provide emergency power to the
building. A new 13.8-kva power line, in addition to the existing building line,
will be installed to provide three power sources.

Several lighting modifications, as well as a new fire protection system, will
be required for the building.

The design criteria and laboratory design schedule concerning the modifica-
tions and new construction mentioned are nearing completion. Detailed design on
the site modifications and building services will proceed as soon as criteria and
schedules are established.

2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

2.1 FREEZE-FLANGE DEVELOPMEWT

Analysisl of the thermal stresses generated in freeze flanges fabricated
from an existing design (ORNL-LR-IWNG 31199) indicates that the flanges may fail
after & relatively small number of thermal cycles. Further analytical and ex-
perimental work, including photoelastic stress analysis, was 1nitiated to produce
an improved design.

A facility for thermal cycling flanges between room temperature and,lhOO“F'
was designed, and fabrication is nearing completion. The general arrangement of
the facility is shown in Fig. 2.1. Hesters on the two tanks will be energized at
all times during testing. At the start of a thermal cycle, with all the molten

salt in the lower tank, heaters on the piping adjacent to the flanges will be
manually energized. When the flanges reach & predetermined temperature, the
molten salt is automatically forced by gas pressure and gravity to flow from one
tank to the other. This oscillating flow through the flanges is maintained for
a specified length of time, after which the pipe heaters are automatically de-
energized and the salt is drained to the lower tank. The flanges are then
allowed to cool before starting the next cycle.

It is believed that the occurrence of excessive gas leakage during cool-down
of existing flanges is at least partially due to overstressing and subsequent
relaxation of the copper ring gasket during heatup and hot operation. Gold-
plated Inconel gaskets are on order for testing in the thermal-cycle facility.
These rings, with higher yield strength and a coefficient of thermel expansion
identical to that for the flange material, should alleviate the gas-sealing
problem. A more flexible clamping ring is being designed to reduce gasket-stress
cycling.

The cooling requirements for the test flange will be evaluated to determine
if forced air cooling can be eliminated without Jjeopardizing the frozen seal.
The resulting higher temperature at the outer edge of the flange will also reduce
the thermal stresses. Attempts will be made to design the flange to withstand
external loads consistent with the code for the pipe size. To facilitate main-
tenance, two sizes of flanges will be developed for use with all pipe sizes in
the MSRE.

2.2 FREEZE VALVES

Two valves are being fabricated for test as fast-freeze or fast-melt valves
for use with molten-salt drain systems. These valves contein no moving parts.
A small restriction is created by crimping a 1-1/2-in. sched-40 INOR-8 pipe, in
which a solid mass or "plug" 1s formed by lowering the salt temperature at that
point. As shown in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3, two methods of heatjng the valve are being
examined. -

One valve (Fig. 2.3) is heated by electrical resistance applied along the
section of pipe containing the V-restriction. Power requirement for a 3- to
S-min melt time is approximately 3 kw. " Gooling is- accomplished by passing air

. over the pipe restriction through & 2-in. tube which is welded around the "erimp".
. - _The- alr requirement has been estimnted torbe 20~50 cfm for a cooling time of
' *~;7aahOU$ 15 minutes. o -

   

The alternative valve (Fig. 2 2)‘1s;heated by a high-freqpency induction

"}?*_*coil (150 to 400 ke).” This valve is made of 1-1/2-1n. sched-40 INOR-8 pipe, and .
7. the restriction consists of & 2-in, flattened ‘section formed by pressing the pipe.
A l/h-in. ‘copper U-shaped induction coil is formed around the ‘2-in. plate for
© ' ‘emse in removal. Bench tests in alr indicate that the melt may be accomplished -
(4T of epproximately 800°F) 4n 1/2 to 2 min,  Cooling will be -done by passing air
"f\jfthrough a nonmetallic ehamber which surrounds the flattened section of pipe. '

.5 SAMELER-ENRICHER DEVELOEMENT

 

The design of the sampler-enricher for the primary loop of the MSRE:in-
cludes provisions for removal of the entire assembly for maintenance. A relisble
valve and flange are required to prevent the escape of fission-product gases
during this operation.

An epparatus 1s being fabricated to test the feasibility of metel freeze
flanges and valves for this application. The metal freeze seal is based on &
soldered jolnt which can be opened and closed by melting and refreezing a pool
of solder. Joints must be leak-tight to helium (<10~7 emd/sec) and must be
strong enough to withstand a pressure differential of 30 psi. The wetted portion
of the apparatus is fabricated from INOR-8. A 72% Ag - 28% Cu silver solder
(melting point 1434°F) will be used as the metal freeze seal. This alloy was
recommended by Metallurgy Division as having the desired wetting characteristics
and thermal expansion properties compatible with nickel-based alloys. The high
melting point is considered an advantage in that no additional cooling is re-
quired beyond that necessary to remove the gaseous fission-product decay heat.
Diffusion of constituents between the molten solder and INOR-8 is considered a
problem and is being studied by the Metallurgy Division.

The unit being constructed will be used to test the leak-tightness of the
proposed type of joint, both initially and after repeated openings of the valve
(or flange). By monitoring the melting point of the solder, the effect of the
diffusion of nickel from the INOR-8 and of the copper into the INOR-8 can be de=-
termined. The metal from the valve will also be examined for diffusion effects.
Strength and leak rates will be evaluated as a function of the time the solder
is molten and of the number of operations of the valve. Heating rates for
various types of heaters will be measured.

2.4 MSRE CORE DEVELOPMENT

A one-fifth-scale, geometrically similar, plastic model of the proposed
MSRE core (see Sec. l.4) is being built. The model will be operated with water
at approximately L40°C and a flow of approximately 50 gpm; the following condi-
tions of flow similarity will exist: +the linear dimensions, inlet fluid velocity,
and inlet Reynolds number for the model will be equal to those for the MSRE core,
and the relative surface roughness of the model will approximate that for the
MSRE core.

Components of the MSRE core that are heing simulated are the inlet volute,
core-wall cooling annulus, and lower plenum with baffles for reducing swirl. An
orifice plate is used to simulate the pressure drop across the graphite lattice.

. Measurements to0 be made include pressure and velocity distribution, and
locel fluid residence times in-the lower plenum.- Fluid transport of solid par-

_ ticles through the model will be investigated.-

Design,was started also on & full-scale,model of'the MSRE core. This modeli

“'Wlll be used for the final fluid dynamic test of the MSRE core. -

A glycerol solution having a kinematic viscosity equal to that of the MSRE '

7 fuel salt will be circulated through the_model\at‘a flowrraterof 1250 gpm.

2 5. REMOTE-MAINTENANCE DEVEDOPMENT FACILITY

As previously reported,2 the remoteemaiutenance facility was operated at

_11200°F and “then disassembled to demonstrate equipment and procedures previously
" developed for maintenance. The following comments are a result of experience

gained from this operation.

 
 

 

 

28

Tools and techniques developed prior to molten-salt circulation were in
general satisfactory after the salt circulation for the remote removal and re-
placement of the salt circulating pump and motor, reactor vessel, east heat ex-
‘changer, and pipe preheater. Closed-circuit stereotelevision was used as the

only viewing medium

for the maintenance operations and was satisfactory. Main-

tenance on the television equipment is considered excessive as one or more of the
four television sets required maintenance every 200 hr of continuous duty.

After the pump

and freeze flanges were disconnected, it was fbund that a re-

mote tool was necessary to clean gasket grooves prior to reassembly. In addition,
a method is necessary to minimize the size of the salt cake formed in the freeze
flanges and to confine it and prevent it from falling on the floor when the

- flanges are disassembled.

The pipe 1ines

should be pitched & minimum of 3° for the molten salt to

~ drain completely from the pipe lines and flanges when the loop is drained for
meintenance. This was not done for all locations in the facility, and some of
the pipe lines were partially filled with .salt after the loop was drained. The
drain tank should be the lowest point in the piping system so that the molten
- salt will flow by gravity into the drain tank. In this facility & pressure dump
- was necessary as the drain-tank level was above the lower runs of piping. This
latter method leaves some salt in the fill and drain line. In addition, & better
method is required to prevent the freezing of salt in the freeze-flange area of
the fill and drain line when the line is full of stagnant salt. A complete de- -
scription5 of this work is being prepared.

Final editing of the color motion picture with sound, "Remote Maintenance
of Molten-~Salt Reactors," was completed and copies were issued.

2.6 FORCED-CIRCULATION CORROSION LOOPS

Operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion test loops, nine of
INOR-8 and two of Inconel, was continued. The accumuwlated hours of operation
range from 3000 to 18,000. Nine loops have operated for & year or more. Table

2.1 gives a summary

of the loops in operation during this period.

Operation of INOR-8 loop MSRP-12 was inadvertently terminated June 29 during
a routine pump-drive maintenance operation. The insulated cooler-coil support
had worn sufficiently to allow contact of coil and frame. When power was applied
to the coil to allow maintenance, a hole was burned in the tubing wall causing a

leak. The loop was

2.7 PUMP DEVELOPMENT

wOrk on the primary and secondary pumps for the MSRE received most emphasis
during the quarter. Testing was continued for the advanced molten- salt pump
program, and the’ 1ong-term test of the MF-F pump (nearly three years of contin-
uous operatlon) was terminated.

A layout of the hot test prototype of the primary pump was completed and is
being reviewed. The impeller and volute and the pump tank heads, to be fabri-

" cated of INOR-B were placed for procurement. Pipe for the hot test stand is on

hand,

. Caleulations of temperature gradient and thermsl stress in the uninsulated
pump tank wall (exposed to gas on both sides) as a function of ganma-heat gener-
ation rate have been completed. The calculations included the radiation and

 natural-convection heat trensfer from the molten-salt surface and a constant

value of beta-heat generation from gas-borne radioactivity. A constant heat-sink

- temperature of 200°F was assumed. The surface temperature of the outside of the
- pump tenk wall varied from 1000 to 1165°F, and the maximum thermal stress at the

outside surface of the wall varied_from 1920 to 2960 psi as gamma~heat generation
rate vas varied from O to 1.0 w/ec

An experlment was designed to determine the extent of the back diffusion of
fission gases up the pump-shaft annulus to the region of the lower oil seal.
This diffusion rate will be determined as a function of flow rate down the shaft.
Krypton-85 will be added to the helium which normelly occupies the pump tank.
Equipment is being fabricated for the experiment, and testing will be performed

operatlon is nearly complete.

'Specifications are being prepared to cover the design and conStructien of
the primary-pump drive motor and containment shell. The same basic specification
will be applicable to the secondary-pump drive motors.:

(an INOR-8 bearing, three helical-grooved, and a carburized INOR-8 journal)
experienced a seizure after 160 hr of operation at 1200°F, 1200 rpm, and 10 to
200 1bp. Throughout the test, satisfactory performance was in doubt. Investi-
gatlons are under way to determine the cause of seizure. , -

. Pump Equipped with One Mblten-Salt-Lubrlcated Journal Besring.--The test5 of :
the pump equipped with one molten-salt-lubricated journal bearing (test No. 6) ) -
continued throughout the quarter. To date, the pump has operated for 3000 hr and
hes been stopped and started 63 times. One stop was made as a result of the
molten salt being dumped inadvertently. Normally, when the molten-~-salt level in
the system is reduced, the pump is stopped automatically. In this particular
case, the pump-tank liquid-level prdbeS'were shorted and therefore did not trip
the automatic device which stops the pump. The pump continued rotating for ap-
proximately 20 min after the system was ‘Qumped. The pump was placed back in
operation 16 hr later, and there was no evidence of damage to the salt-lubricated

- bearing; pump operation is continuing.

2.7.4 MF-F Pump Performance Loop

The MF-F pump testﬁ was terminated efter a total of 25,500 hr of continuous
operation at 2700 rpm and.645 gpm. The last 23,700 hr of the test included in-
tentional operation of the impeller in & cavitation region with NaF-ZrF)i-UF)L
(50-46-4 mole %) at 1200°F (pump-tenk gas pressure of 2.5 psig). Examination of
the pump parts revealed that the impeller had been damaged considerably by the
cavitation. There was evidence that oil and/or oil vapors entered the system by
traversing down the pump-shaft annulus from the lower-seal catch basin to the
pump expension tank. A report of the test will be written. The impeller is
being sectioned for metallurgical examination.

2.7.5 Frozen-Lead Pump Seal

The small frozen-lead-sealed pump,7_consisting of a centrifugal pump mounted
vertically over a fractional horsepower motor drive, has operated continuously
during this period to accumulste 18,708 hr of operation. The pump circulates
molten selt isothermally through a small loop at 1200°F.

2.7.6 MSRE Engineering Test Loop

An engineering test loop is being designed for construction in Building
9204-1 for the purpose of evaluating certain MSRE components and operations. The
facility will consist of a centrifugal pump circulating molten salt at 25 to 100
gpm through a 1-1/2-in. pipe loop. Prototype mechanisms and mockups which will
be included are: a remotely operated salt sampler and enricher, & graphite con-
tainer, freeze-type flanges, duel fuel and flush tanks with associated freeze
valves, controlled-stmosphere maintenance provisions, gas-handling system, level-
measuring device, and piping heaters. The system will operate isothermally at
temperatures up to the maximum expected MSRE temperature.

The shrinkage msy produce four effects, which are considered separately.
These are:

1. tension at the surface, caused by the fast-flux depression in the center
of a graphite piece;

2. gross axial shrinkage of pieces; tending to shorten the reactor;

3. ‘transverse shrinkage, which tends to increase the fuel volume fraction
within the reactor;

. bowing of the pieces, caused by flux gradient.

Celculations have been mede on the assumption that there is no yielding or
annealing, elthough there is evidence that shrinkage-induced stresses may be re-

 lieved.? Results of the calculations are shown primarily as strain and second-

arily as stress, which is the product of strain and Young's modulus. The strain
to produce rupture has been shown to be esbout 0.001 in. /in. for graphite made
from coarse particles, and increasing to about 0.003 for types made from fine
particles. It is estimated to be greater than 0.002 for CEY graphite. As
Young's modulus and strength at rupture both increase with irradiation, and as no
data are avallable, both the stress p gduced by & strain and the allowable stress
are very uncertain. However, 1.5 x 10¥ psi is used for Young's modulus to indi-
cate the value of the stresses that might be produced.

The snalysis presented here is based on a core 66 in. long by 27 in. in
radius, made of 2- by 2- by 66-in. pieces, with axial fuel channels cut into each
face. Some effects, particularly in relation to bowing, would be entirely dif-
ferent for different-size pieces and a different arrangement.

. The flux depression within a graphite piece is due to the progressive ther-
melization of the neutrons end may be considered separately from the macroscopic
variation of the flux across the pilece, .and the results added. The variation be-
tween everage and edge, which is- proportional to the tensile strain, esmounts to
1.4% of the average flux (see Fig. 3.8). - At the reactor cgnter after a full year
at 10 MwT, the strain would be 0.00027. With E =1.5 x 10° psi, the stress would
be 40O psi in tension. , |

‘The axial shrinkage of 8 66-in.-1ong piece at the reactor exis is celculated

,\to be 0 860 in., for an edge piece the valne is 0.122 in. (see Fig. 3.3).

The flux gradient across the graphite pieces would produce outward bowing at
the midplene, allowing en unrestrained reactor to became barrel-shaped. The
bowing effect reaches a maximum about three~fourths of the way out from the cen-
ter, with the outer pieces less bowed.

With the center of the reactor banded, the effect of transverse shrinkage of
the pieces must be considered. The bowing would cause inward packing at the ends
and outward packing, against the band, at the midplane. The ends would be keyed
ageinst rows slipping, with the result that concentric rings would be locked to-
gether, with the rings inside relatively free. The pieces would bow outward at
the midplane, increasing the fuel fraction most at the center.

Deflections expected of unrestrained graphite pieces after a full-power year
are listed in Table 3.2 for a radisl row. Also tabulated are the shrinkage per
2« x 2-in. plece at the midplane and the strain if the pleces are kept straight.
The hoop load to keep them straight, allowing for pieces bowing to teke up
shrinkege but not considering the expansion of the band under the load, is
11,000 1b.

3.2 TEMPERATURE-RISE EFFECTS IN MSRE CORES WITH ROUND AND FLAT FUEL CHANNELS

The temperature effects in cores with round and flat fuel channels, with the
fuel in laminar flow, have been investigated. It has been found that the differ-

ence between the fuel-graphite interface tempersture and the mixed-mean fuel tem- -

persture would be excessive if round channels were used but would not be if the
same fuel flow were provided in the form of flat channels.

The two core configurations considered are illustrated in Fig. 3.4. In both
cases, it is assumed that the core is an assembly of graphite stringers of square
cross-section extending the full height of the core., The fuel flows vertically
through the core, meking a single pass in both cases.

In the round-channel case, the fuel channels are produced by machining a
quarter-round of radius r at each corner of the graphite blocks. The blocks ere
packed in as tightly as possible, but it is assumed that there will be cracks of
- some width t between the blocks due to machining tolerances (these are exagger-
ated in the sketch).

In the flat-channel case, the blocks are spaced &part a distance 2r in some
convenient manner (e.g., by providing bosses on the blocks).

In the comperison, it is assumed that the comparsable cores contain equal
fractional fuel cross-section f and the seme center-to-center block spacing s.

- Poppendiek and PalmerB’h have presented solutions for the difference between
the temperature at the channel wall and the mixed-mean fuel temperature for a

Thus it is clear that the volume heat source produces a much less severe

Thus 6 = 6.59°F.

Therefore it is clear that neither fuel nor graphite temperatures would be
excessive in the flat-channel core using laminar flow. For the round-channel
core, excessive fuel temperatures would be encountered in laminar flow. Calcu-
lations for turbulent flow show that the fuel temperature is not excessive in.
round chennels in that case.

For the 0.2«in.~thick 1. 25-in.~wide chennels used in the sctual core design,

the fuel fraction in the core is 0.1188. The difference between the fuel-graphite

- interface temperature and the mixed-mean fuel temperature at the center of the
core increases to 23.6°F, while there should be & negligible change in the tem-
perature at the center of the graphite relative to that at the surface of the
‘graphite, and the center of the graphite will be approximately 30°F above the

,"1?f' 3.3 TEMPERATURE OF FUEL IN A BLOCKED PASSAGE IN THE MSRE

An analysis was made to determine the temperature which the MSRE fuel msay
attain if one of the fuel passages becomes blocked so that no fuel flow can
occur.

If uniﬂirectional conduction is assumed, the problem‘is failrly straight-
forward, although the answers will be ultraconservative. Essentially it is &
superposition of the following solutions:

(a) conduction through an infinite slab of fuel with a uniform volume heat

source, '

(b) conduction of the heat released in the fuel across & graphite slab to

the adjacent fuel channel,
. (c) temperature rise in the graphite due to its volume heat source,

(@) temperature rise in the adjacent cpen fuel channel due to its volume

heat source.

6h.4 x 0.62 = 39.9°F.

Thus the temperature in the blocked channel will be
32.1 + 607.5 + 39.9 = 679.5°F
gbove the mixed-mean temperature in the adjacent open channel.

It is evident that the temperature rise across the graphite block is the
major factor in the above, and it seemed of interest to investigate the effect of
two-dimensional conduction in the graphite. Since no analytical solution was
found, this problem has been solved by a relaxation procedure, and the graphite
temperature drop was found to be 218°F or ebout a third of that for unidirectional
conduction. This answer is low since it is based on the assumption that the
graphite - flowing-fuel interface temperature is constant, while it doubtless is
somewhat higher near the blocked channel than elsewhere. DBased on this solution,
the maximum temperature in the blocked channel would be about 200°F above that in
an adjacent flowing-fuel channel.

The above resultslsuggest that if a single fuel channel were blocked, the

fuel temperature probably would be no more than 4OO°F ebove the mixed-mean tem-
perature in adjacent open fuel passages.

Similar calculations were performed for composition A with 8 vol % fuel salt
for reactor diameters of 3.5, k.0, 4.5, end 5.0 £t and reactor heights of 5.5 and
10 ft. Calculated critical masses are shown in Fig. 3.6.

Multigroup one-dimensional calculations were also performed for the reactor
model lllustrated in Fig. 3.7. These calculations, one along the midplane and
one along the center line, were employed to generate two-group constants for use
in two-dimensional calculations with the IBM-TOL program Equipoise.” In general,
good agreement was obtained between the results of critical calculations by the
different methods.

TWO-Eroup flux and adjoint-function distributions were obtained from the
Equipoise® calculations and were used to estimate the neutron lifetime and the
reactivity loss assoclated with changing from isothermal startup conditions to
power operation. The calculated neutron lifetime waﬁ 290 usec; the perturbation-
theory estimate of the reactivity loss was 3.9 x 10~ Bk k, compared to 5.0 x 107
&as obtained from calculation of both the perturbed and unperturbed cases. Part
of the above discrepancy was due to neglecting the change in diffusion coeffi-
cient in the perturbation-theory calculations.

Fig. 3.7. Resctor Model.

An estimate of the quantity (®k/k)/(8M/M), where M is the mass of fuel in
the reactor, was obtained from the GNU calculations. Assuming that the only ef-
fect of a temperature increase is the removal of fuel from the core, the estimated
temperature coefficient of reactivity was -2.4 x 10~ (Bk/E)/°F based on'a volu-
metric expansion coefficient of the fuel salt of 1.0 x 10™*/°F and a (8k/k)/(3M/M)
value of 0.24 as obtained from the GNU calculations.

3.4.2 Gamma-Heating Calculations

The two-dimensional Equipoise calculations were used to provide source esti-
mates for the gamma-heating calculations, which were done with the IBM-704 pro-
gram.Nightmare.9 Results of the gamma-heating cslculations are given in Table
3.4 for a reactor 54 in. in dismeter and 66 in. high, with 8 vol % fuel salt in
the core, operating at 5 Mw.

3.4.3 Drain-Tank Criticality

Criticality calculations were performed7 for a cylinder 5 ft long and 5 ft
high containing fuel salt. This cylinder, somewhat larger than the currently
proposed drain tank, had a calculated multiplication constant of 0.4l when bare
and 0.77 when reflected with an essentially infinite layer of water. .

3.4.4 Pump-Bowl Fission-Product Activities

The equilibrium activity due to gaseous fission products in the pump bowl
was estimated by the method described by Stevenson.19 The heat generation in the
pump bowl amounted to about 6 kw for a reactor power of 5 Mw.

3.4.5 Cell Calculations
Three-ﬁroup two-dimensional calculations were performed with the IBM-704
progrem PDQ 1 to obtain an estimate of the flux distribution within & moderator
block. Sample traverses of the flux above 0.3 Mev are shown in Fig. 3.8.
3.5 ANALOG-COMPUTER STUDY OF MSRE PRIMARY-SYSTEM FLOW LOSS
An analog-computer analysis was made of a loss-of-flow accident in the pri-

mary system of the MSRE. The temperature changes and the maximum temperatures
attained in the system were of primary interest.

suitable design information is available. The secondary coolant system was simu-
lated merely as a heat dump since the main interest is in the primary system. A
very elementary schematic of the system is shown in Fig. 3.9.

It is understood that this was a simulation of primery flow stoppage and not
one of primary pump stoppage. Pump "run down" information is unavaileble at this
time.

The primary flow rate was decreased exponentielly on periods of 1.5, 3, 6,
and 10 sec. - _

The heat transfer coefficient between the primary coolant and the heat ex-
changer wall was made to vary with primary flow rate in accordance with the curve
shown in Fig. 3.10. This curve was derived from the curve supplied by the de~
signers, which is shown in Fig. 3.11.

, Nuclear System.--The delayed neutrons were lumped into one weighted group.
Using the values from document LA-2118 (dated 1957) for Ai and Bi, A for the one
group was found to be 0.0769 seC’l and B is 6.4 x 1073, Using the given fuel
transit times and the curves in ORNL-LR-Dwg. 8919, B was found to be 3.4685 x 107

In the simulation, the delayed-neutron contribution is a function of the
flow rate. The method used in the simulation is not precise; however, it appears
to be a good approximation for excursions with periods of the same order of mag-
nitude as those encountered in this analysis.

4.1 DYNAMIC-CORROSION STUDIES
4,1.1 Forced-Convection Loops

The final hot-leg insert was removed from INOR-8 forced-convection loop
9354-4 after 15,140 hr of operation. As previously discussed,l three inserts
were installed at the end of the hot-leg section of this loop to provide data on
the weight changes of INOR-8 in contact with a beryllium-base fluoride fuel
mixture. The operating schedule specified removal of one insert after 5000 hr
of exposure, another after 10,000, and the third after 15,000. Operation of the
loop began in July 1958 under the conditions:

Salt mixture LiF-BngUFh (62-37-1 mole %)
Max. salt-metal interface temp. 1300°F

Min. salt temp. 1100°F

AT 200CF

Reynolds number 1600

Flow rate 2 gpm

Examination of the third insert showed an average weight loss of 1.7 mg/cm?,
Y64, along its #-in. length. If uniform removal of surface metal is assumed, this
weight loss corresponds to a loss in wall thickness of 0.08 mil, *&%.

The first two inserts, which were removed from the loop after 5000 and 10,000
hr, showed respective weight losses of 1.8 mg/em2, +2%, and 2.1 mg/cm?, 13%. The

. corresponding losses in wall thickness were calculated to be 0.08 and 0.09 mil,
[;respectively. -The similarity of these. values indicates that no significant weight
loss occurred after the first: 5000 hr of operation. On all three inserts no loss
~in wall thickness could be detected from measurements ‘of the inserts before and
:?after test. L S .

The band of fine-grained material is attributed to recrystallization of the
matrix near the inside surfaces of the insert. This assumption 1s supported by
the fact that the inserts had been resmed prior to service, which probably induced
some cold work along the inside surfaces. '

The status of two Inconel and nine INOR-8 forced-convection loops which are
in operation with various fluoride mixtures is summarized in Sec. 2.6.

4.1.2 Microprobe Analyses of Surface Film
The compositions of thin corrosion films found on several of the long-term

INOR-8 loop specimens after salt exposure have been investigated by means of an
electron-beam, microprobe snalyzer. (These analyses were carried out by the

Ernest F. Fullam Corp., Schenectady, N. Y.) Included in these examinations were
hot-leg specimens from %herma -convection loop 1226\ref 3) and from forced-

convection loops 935k-hiref 4) ana 935&-5(ref ). Pilms on these specimens,
which ranged from 1/4 to 1/3 mil in thickness, were first examined by aiming the
electron beam directly on the inner surface, which excited an area of 1.96 x 10-5
em® on the surface to a depth of approximately 1lp . A scan analysis was then made

‘along a cross section of the specimen from forced-convection test 9354-h. This

latter specimen was sectioned along a plane tangent to the inside surface of the
specimen so as to increase the apparent cross section of the tube wall and,

~ correspondingly, the corrosion film. The results of the spectrographic analyses

obtained by using both methods are compared with as-received analyses of these

-specimens in Tables L.l and L4.2.

As shown in Table 4.1, the spot analyses of the surfaces of all three samples

indicaeted an increase in the molybdenum content and virtually complete depletion
of chromium and iron. The single-scan analysis (Table L4.2) shows the depletion
of chromium and iron to have occurred to a depth of approximately 3 mils on the
"magnified" cross section. Nickel is seen to have decreased and molybdenum to
have increased over about the same depth, If these results are adjusted to
account for the magnification created by the specimen preparation, this concen-
tration gradient is found to occur in sbout a 1/2-mil-thick surface.

As can be seen in both tebles, the percentages of Ni, Cr, Fe, and Mo do not
total 100%, although the deviastion from 100% is within the estimated accuracy of
the instrument. To ensure that the deviation was not associated with residual
fluorides remaining on the surfaces of the specimens, the hot-leg specimen from
loop 9354-5 was cleaned with an ammonium oxalate solution and then re-analyzed.
(This solution dissolves fluorides quite effectively without disturbing alloys
composed predominantly of nickel.) The results of this re-analysis, as shown in
Table 4.1, showed no difference from the first analysis. '

4,2 WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES
h.2.1 Solidified-Metal-Seal Development

 The use of solidified metal seals for elevated-temperature, leak-tight,
~quick-disconnect joints has been considered for a number of applicgtions includ-
ing high-vacuum valve and flange studies for the Sherwood Project. Such seals
-appear to be especially suitable for molten-salt reactor applications since they
are readily applicable for remote handling and since relatively simple equipment
- may be used for making and breaking the joint. Conventional types of seals
containing such materials as rubber, Teflon, and vacuum grease are obviously not
possible in view of the high temperature and highly corrosive environment.

In general, two designs have been considered, the first containing an alloy
sump and a tongue-and-groove joint design and the second containing an alloy-
impregnated metal-fiber compact which would be used similar to an O-ring. Three
ductile metals, corrosion-resistant to fused salt, were selected as potential
sealing materials, and two corrosion-resistant base metsls were chosen for the
preliminary wetting and compatibility studies. A list of these materials is
shown in Table 4.3,

Compatibility specimens were made with each of the above combinations, and
aging studies are being conducted at 1292°F and 90°F above the melting point of
the seal material. These conditions simulate reactor service temperature and a
typical seal opening or closing temperature. These specimens will be examined
for base-metal erosion and solid-state diffusion of seal-metal constituents.

In an effort to demonstrate feasibility of these types of solidified-metal
seals, several small components have been constructed and evaluated. A sump-type
seal, fabricated from INOR-8 and sealed with 80 Au-20 Cu, is shown in Fig. k.2,
It was made and broken by induction heating in argon and was helium leak-tested
after every sealing. To date, this seal has been found helium leaktight after
each of ten cycles of breaking and sealing. Testing will be continued in an
effort to determine the lifetime.

In addition to the sump-type seal, an unsintered molybdenum-fiber compact
was prepared by the Metallurgy Division Powder Metallurgy Group and impregnated
with Au-Cu. - This was used to make a seal between two molybdenum plates, as
shown in Fig. 4.3. The seal was spring loaded for opening and closing while the

. component was induction heated under inert gas. A drawing showing this method
~of making and breaking seals is shown .in Fig. L.4, After each cycle of breaking

and sealing, the seal was helium leak-checked., To date, the sample has been found

. leaktight after each of five completed cycles. No solution of the molybdenum
~ plates is evident, and no additional alloy has been added. Tests of this type
'j“will also be continued to determine the lifetime of the Joint.

As 8- result of the above tests, it is believed that unsintered molybdenum-

c 1fiber compacts impregnated with alloy have sufficient strength at sealing
- ?7temperature to resist tearing. To make this’ ‘specimen more applicable to -
- proposed. molten-salt operating conditions, ‘& molybdenum-fiber compact will be
~-,jused between INOR-S plates on the next seal instead of between molybdenum plates.

exchange systems of graphite, the development of techniques for fabricating such
systems has been a subject of study. 7+8 ~Corrosion-resistant brazing alloys in

the Au-Ni-Ta and Au-Ni-Mo systems have been developed for Jjoining graphite to
itself and to metals, and & typical graphite-tube-to-INOR-8 header mockup
assembly was constructed.

A method of leak testing these graphite-to-metal joints was developed and
yreliminary results were obtained. The test consists of brazing molybdenum caps
on low-permesbility graphite tubes and filling the assembly with isopropanol,

- which has a room-temperature viscosity similar to that of the fused salts at
- operating temperature. An inlet at the top of the assembly provides for a means

of internally pressurizing with argon, as shown in Fig. 4.5.

On initial tests, leakage at the brazed Joint was observed below 5 psig.
However, joints that were more leaktight were obtained by oxidizing the ends of
the graphite tubes prior to brazing. It is believed that oxidizing makes the
surface of the graphite more porous and provides an additional keying action
with the brazing alloy. A similar keying action has been reported in brazing
tests on the porous-type AGOT graphite.8 Table 4.4 summarizes the results of
three tests made in this manner.

4 .2.3 Heat Exchanger Fabrication

The main heat exchanger of the MSRE will consist of approximately 250 INOR-8
(1/2 in. in OD, and 0.045 in. in wall thickness) tubes joined to a 1-1/2-in.-~
thick INOR-8 header. Welding and back-brazing procedures are being developed
for fabricating the tube-to-header joints in this unit. The basic techniques
are those previously used for fabricating heat exchange components containing
thick tube sheets.9

Figure 4.6 is a cross-sectional view of the tube-to-header joint configura-
tion selected for the heat exchanger. Trepanning on the weld side serves to
ensure good heat distribution by providing a uniform weld geometry and to minimize
tube-sheet distortion and restraint in the vicinity of the weld Jjoint.

In back brazing these joints, there is a unique heating problem because of
the large differences in mass of the tube and tube sheet. As a result, the tube-
sheet temperature continuously lags the tube temperature during heating, and if

- brazing alloys are applied to the conventional location at the tube-to-tube-sheet
" Junction, the alloy preferentially flows to the hottest meﬂber, with consequent
~ poor flow on the tube sheet. Placing the braze metal in a trepanned sump =

. removes the problem by allowing the brazing alloy to remain at the temperature

of the tube sheet through the entire braze cycle, The sump acts as a reservoir
from which the alloy flows to fill the annulue between the tube and the tube

o sheet and to form a fillet-where the tube meets the tube-sheet surface. - The

fillet also aids in inspection since the capillary jJoint must be filled with
alloy to form a fillet. The use of back brazing in the fabrication of this unit

-1s unique, since high-temperature brazes. are not normally used on tube sheets of '
.-this thickness. ' .

Optimum welding conditions for the tube-to—tuhe sheet joints to ohtain weld

 penetrations of 1.5t and 1t (t = tube-wall thickness) were determined and are
. listed below. D Lo T S

Those conditions which give maximum weld penetration of 1.5t also cause
severe "roll over"” of the weld and thus a constriction in the tube entrance.
Therefore, welds with 1t penetration, and less "roll over,"” were considered to
be more suitable. '

A seven-tube test assembly was then constructed, and a photograph showing
the braze side of the unit is shown in Fig. 4.7. Brazing was conducted in dry
hydrogen, using the 82 Au-18 N1 (wt %) alloy. The brazing temperature was
1830°F, and a rate-of-temperature rise of 300°F/hr was selected, since it
approximates that to be readily obtained with commercisl facilities. Good
filleting was observed on all seven tubes, and the general visual appearance
of the welds and brazed joints was excellent. A metallographic evaluation of
several Jjoints is being conducted.

A large assembly containing about 20 tubes is being planned to further
demonstrate reliability in making a large number of Joints.

L.2.4 Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

Most of the mechanical-property tests on INOR-8 were complsted 1n71959,

and the results of this program are presented in a topical report.lo A critical
review of these data was made in order to establish deslgn values. It was

decided that up to 1050°F, the design stresses would be based on two-thirds of
the 0.2% offset yield strength, adjusted for the minimum specified yield
strength: This value was chosen to be 35,000 psi. Above 1050°F the design

 stresses are based on the stress to produce 1% creep strain in 107 hr. This

value was chosen because several heats of material did not exhibit a minimum
creep rate. For heats which did exhibit a minimum creep rate, the stress-

- value for 0.1 CRU was above the values based on creep strain. Stresses in the
creep range were obtained from Larsen-Miller plots of data at 1100, 1200, 1250,

1300, 1400, 1500, 1650, 1700, and 18000F. Over 100 creep tests were performed,

4.3 PERMEATION AND APPARENT-DENSITY UNIFORMITY IN LARGE PIECES OF GRAPHITE

_ Since there appears to be some advantage in using large pieces of graphite
in the design of the molten-salt-reactor moderator, grades R-0025 and MH4IM-82,
which were the largest pieces of low-permeability graphite available, were
tested for uniformity of properties. Specimens from various locations and with
different orientations were subjected to the standard molten-salt permeation
test. The original sizes of both grades, the location and orientation of the
test specimens, and the test results are summarized in Table L4.7.

In the fabrication of the graphite cylinder of grade R-0025, 1.5-in.-dia
holes were drilled through one quadrant of the cylinder parallel to the axis.
The plece was impregnated with pitch and then graphitized. The center specimens
from this piece were taken at the location of a hole. The other specimens were
taken from a quadrant,opposite the_one'that'was drilled.

It appeared that the pores of the R-0025 graphite may have been slightly
more continuous (accessible) and/or larger in the direction parallel to the

“molding force (parallel to the cylinder wall) and that the lower porosity of

the center specimens extended only 3/h in. from the surface of the center hole.
In general, the results indicated that. the large pleces of grades R-0025 and
MHLYIM-82 were uniform.

4.3.1 Permeation of AGOT and S-4 Graphites by Molten Salts at Different Pressures

at pressures of 25, 65, and 150 psig %n 100- hr exposure periods. A good
correlation between the molten-salt and mercury permeation of graphite would
contribute to the general indications that the molten fluorides deo not wet
graphite. Grade AGOT, because it is porous and has good uniformity, was included
in the test as-a control. ,

Typical mercury perneation (intrusion) data for AGOT and R-0025 graphite
(8-4 is a laboratory designation for grade R-0025) were used to plot curves for
theoretical bulk permeation of graphite by molten salts.ll These curves were
used to obtain the theoretical permeation data that are compared with the actual
‘data in Table 4.8.

The agreement of the actual permeation values with the typical theoretical
values is generally good except for grade S-4 in the 25-psig permeation.
Either there is a structural difference in the graphite tested or this is one
of the first indications of a slight wetting of graphite by a molten salt.
FUrther 1nvestigation is planned.

~ The molten-salt permeation data also show that pressure reductioa'from 150
to 25 psig does not appreciably decrease the salt permeation into these grades
of graphite even though S-U4 1is a moderately low permesbility grade of graphite.

L, h PRECIPITATION FROM MOLTEN-FLUORIDE FUEL TN CONTACT WITH
o VARIOUS VOLUMES OF GRAPHITE

A single series of five. precipitation tests have been made with AGOT

- graphite and LiF-Bng-UFh (62-37-1 mole %) fuel in which only the volume of the
graphite was varied in order to determine the relationship of graphite volume to
uranium precipitated from the fuel. The test conditions and results are
sunmarized in Table 4.9. " The quantity of uranium that precipitated as U0, was
determined chemically., The uranium precipitated per cubic centimeter of bulk
volume of the graphite averaged (1.3 + O.4)mg to (1.3-0.3)mg. This would be
equivalent to approximately 9% by weight of the uranium in the fuel for a
reactor system with a volume ratio of graphite to fuel of 9:1. This estimate
is made with ‘the. assumptions that the volume of salt and the area of graphite

.~ in contact with the fuel do not affect the ‘quantity of precipitate that occurs.
Past data for volume ratios. of graphite to fuel in the range of these tests
support these assumptions. . .

4.4.1 Removal of Contamination from Graphite

Tt has been reportedl® that the thermal decomposition of NH,F.HF in the
presence of graphite removed its oxygen contamination to such an extent that the
graphite could subsequently contain LiF~BeFp-UF), (62-37-1 mole %) at 13000F
without causing the usual U0s precipitation from the fuel. A duplicating test

" has produced the same results. Work is in progress to determine if INOR-8 is
' seriously attacked during the thermal decomposition of the NH,F.HF.

4,h,2 TINOR-8 -- Fuel -~ Graphite Carburization Tests

 The tendency for INOR-8 and Inconel to be carburized in LiF-BeFQ-UFu

(67-32-1 mole %) -- graphite system at 1300°F has been investigated in a series
of tests conducted in multiples of 2000 hr up to 12,000 hr.

Nb carburization was detected metallographically on specimens from any of
the above tests. Sheet tensile specimens were included in each test system, and
these were tested after exposure to the fuel-graphite to determine the effect of
this exposure on their tensile properties.

These tensile-test results are listed in Table L4.10. After 4000 hr of
exposure, the corrosion on the Inconel specimens was heavy enough to mask any
carburization that might have occurred; consequently, only the results dbtained
with INOR-8 tensile specimens are listed.

Comparing the tensile strengths and elongation values of the long-term'

" tested specimens with those of the short-term control specimens, it is evident

that no significant change has occurred.

5. CHEMISTRY

5.1 PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES
5.1.1 MSRE Fuel and Coolant

For design purposes, the MSRE fuel has been chosen at the composition 11TF-
BeF,-ThF),-UF), (65-30-4-1 mole %; m. p. 450°C). Chemically, this composition can
be roughly approximated as Lin-BeF) to which 5 mole % of quadrivalent fluorides
are added; however, the exact proportions are based on carefully established phase
diagramsl showing the primary phase fields and lowest liquidus temperatures asso-
ciated with a given UF) and ThF) content. Fortunately, for concentration ranges ,
of interest as MSRE fuels, the quadrivalent fluorides are interchangeable, with -
little effect on the melting point. Furthermore, the LiF-BeFo solvent can hold as
much as 15 mole % quadrivalent fluorides in solution without requiring temperatures
in excess of 500°C. The preferred fuel compositions for MSRE-type reactors occur
just outside the primary phase field of 1iF, and thus take advantage of both the
unusually large eezing—ﬁoint depression of I4iF caused by strongly "acidic" cations
such as Be++, Th*t, and U*" and the diminished stability ranges of 3LiF-MF} crystals
(as compared with 3:1 combinations containing other alkali fluorides).

The uranium concentration in the MSRE will be adjusted by adding concentrate
to a carrier. For example, the addition of LiF-UF), (73-27 mole %; m. p. 490°C) to
the carrier, IiF-ThF)-BeF, (64.75-4.15-31.1 mole %; m. p. 450°C), gives the final
fuel composition: 65-3%0-4-1 mole %; m. P 450°C,. The concentrate is also used for
replenishment. During mixing, a complete range of intermediate compositions has at
least a transient existence before uniform blending is accomplished, and it is impor-
tant that no composition corresponding to a high-melting-point compound or insoluble
solid be encountered. Although the concentrate was chosen to conform with this re-
quirement, to establish with certainty the temperature above which no solid appears,
equilibrated samples have been quenched from the nelghborhood of the liquidus tem-
perature throughout the range between concentrate and carrier. The identified
phases in some of the quenched samples are listed in Table 5.1, and the liquidus
temperatures derived from these identifications are shown in Fig. 5.1l. The absence
of any high-melting-point precipitate along the quaternary join conforms with ex-
pectations based on previously established ternary behavior.l

The coolant for the MSRE, L17F-BeFé (66-34 mole %; m. p. 4159°C) closely resem-
bles the fuel in that LipBeF) can be considered as the predominant constituent. As
a consequence, the fuel and coolant are compatible and no chemical interaction ensues, -
merely dilution of the quadrivalent cations, in case of inadvertent mixing. The pro- o
portions of IiF and BeF, were selected primarily as a compromise between increasing
melting points at greater LiF content and increasing viscosities at greater BeF,
contents. Also, a coolant with a higher freezing point than the fuel provides added
insurance against accidental freezing of the fuel by too rapid heat removal.

now nearing completion, are leading to significant modifications in the phase
diagrams.

The diagram portraying the phases in the system KF-ThF),, based on new data
for the composition region 30 to 90 mole % ThF), is shown in Fig. 5.2. Invariant
equilibria are listed in Table 5.2. The formulas and crystal structures of the
intermediate compounds in this system were reported originally by Zachariasen.?
The cubic phases, SNaF+3UF), and 3NaF-2ThF),, are structural analogs of a phase
vhich Zachariasen identified as a-2KF«ThFl; attempts to isolate and identify this
phase are continuing. Demonstration of a homogeneous solid phase at 75 mole % ThF),
corroborates the view of Asker, Segnit and Wylle's that the compound of highest
ThF), /KF ratio in the system is KF-3ThF), rather than KF-6ThFy, as was previously
claimed.2 1In fact, it now appears that KF-3ThF) melts incongruently to ThF) ss
and liquid, that it undergoes solid state transitions which account for the exis-
tence of three crystal polymorphs, and that it is unstable with respect to KF-2ThF)
and ThF) below TT5°C.

Although relatively detailed work had been made on the phases in the system
KF-ThF), before the current studies, the system RbF-ThF), had been investigated in
only a cursory fashion.? Results of thermal gradient quenching experiments in the
system RbF-ThF) now reveal five intermediate compounds, >RbF-ThF), 2RbFThF),
TRbF«6ThF),, RbFe3ThFl, and RbF-6ThFy, in contrast with 3RbF-ThF),, RbF-ThFy, and
RbF+3ThF), as reported by Dergunov and Bergman. Elucidation of the solid state
relationships among the compounds RbF, >RbF+ThF}, and 2RbF.ThF) is continuing.

5.1.3 The System ZrFu-ThFh

In conjunction with problems arising from the presence of ZrFy in ThF)-contain-

ing fuels, thermal gradient quenching experiments of binary ZrF)-ThF), mixtures have
shown that the system ZrF),-ThF) forms continuous solid solutions with a minimum at
approximately 23 mole % ThF), and at 858°. Although the four tetravalent heavy-metal

The results, summarized in Table 5.3, show that the values for ZrF) and HIF)
agree within experimental error and that these two solutes give higher freezing
points than UF), which in turn gives a higher value than Th¥F). Thus, the magnitude
of the freezing point depression of NaF increases with increasing radius of the
quadrivalent solute cation, in contrast with divalent fluoride solutes for which a
decrease in radius is associated with an increase in freezing-point depression.
However, a significant difference between the two types of solutes is the stronger
electric field around the tetravalent ion and the accompanying tendency toward
higher coordination numbers in the liquid state. Assuming eightfold coordination,
and according to the crystal radii, only the thorium cation is sufficiently large
for all eight fluorides to be in simultaneous contact with the cation. Possibly
the smaller cations cannot effectively complex as many fluorides as thorium and, as
a consequence, exert a smaller influence on the activity of NaF. In other words,
Zr'*+ and Af%+, having ionic radii that are smaller and nearly identical, have a
smaller capacity for fluoride ions, would thus be less acid, and would show smaller
but equal negative deviation with the basic NaF.

The notion of eightfold coordination of quadrivalent ions _in solution is sup-
ported by the absorption spectra of UFy in LiF-NaF-KF eutect1c6 where the predomi-
nant absorption maximum corresponds closely to the maximum for solid UF);! the
positions of eight fluoridesrsurrgunding each uranium in the UF} crystal has been
established by x-ray diffraction.® ‘Activity coefficients less than unity can re-
sult from negative heats of solution or from positive excess entropies of mixing.
The heats of solution probably follow previously established correlations with
cation radii, but the entropies apparently have more influence in the case of the
quadrivalent cations. It appears that NaF i1s more disordered by ThF) (big cations)
as & solute than by ZrF) (1ittle cations), and that this effect is large enough to
reverse the sequence of increasing negative deviations expected from only electro-
static considerations.

‘A recently completed phase . diagram of the system IiF-YF (Fig. 5. 5) differs

shown that the system contains the single binary compound IiF-YF3, ‘melting incon-
gruently to YFz and liquid at 815°C. The peritectic invariant point for this re-

action occurs at 49 mole % YF3. A single eutectic occurs in the system LiF-YF3

from single erystal x-ray diffraction measurements, has been shown to be tetra-

| - gonal.ll Optical proPerties of the compound - have been established.

In conJunction with the hase studies, the melting point of YF5 has been de-

termined to be (1144 * 3)9C.12 ' A large exothermic effect in the YF3 heating and

cooling curves indicates that YF3 undergoes & solid state transition at 10600C.
The temperature of this transition has been confirmed by’ the results of thermal

- gradient quenching experiments, but it has not been possible to preserve the high-
temperature modification of YFz by quenching from temperatures above 1060°C., - Char- _ -

acterization of this form will probably be possible only with high-temperature x-ray
diffraction measurements.

5.2.3 Melting Point of NiFp

Apparently NiFo melts somewhere between 1400 and 1500°C, probably about 1425
or 1450°C, but attempts to measure the melting point have been thwarted by the vola-
tilization of NiFp at the requisite temperatures and by some poorly understood
phenomena,. Previous reported values for the melting point, usually estimated,l3 15
have ranged from 1027 to 1450°C, 16 The growth of single crystals of NiFo by zone

melting is alleged to have occurred with a hot-zone temperature of 1ho00C. 1

The necessary temperatures were obtalned in a platinum-wound resistance furnace
or in a controlled-atmosphere Globar furnace. The furnace had three compartments:
a sample heating area, thermocouple well, and a heating-element container. Separate
control of the atmosphere in each of these compartments was possible. The enclosed
heating elements were made of silicon carbide. Temperatures are measured with a
Pt, Pt~-10% Rh thermocouple located in a tantalum thermocouple well.

Since the temperature is above the melting point of nickel, containment of
molten NiF, presents a problem. Sealed platinum capsules of 5-mil wall thickness
ruptured from internal pressure developed by NiFs at temperatures of 1400 to 1550°C.
(The extrapolated vapor pressure of solid NiFp is 650 mm at 1450°C.) In one experi-
ment, it was observed that the rupturing of the capsule was accompanied by a flash
of light. This effect might be an indication of dissociation to yield Fpo. If, as
in the case of copper(II) fluoride, fluorine is produced,18 then a nickel(I) f£luo-
ride must exist, which has not, as yet, been isolated nor characterized. Graphite
was unsuitable as container material because NiFp was reduced to nickel in the
inert atmosphere of the high temperature furnace when a graphite liner was tried.

Although the equilibrium products of the reactions involved in the dispropor-
tionation of chromium(II) fluoride and iron(II) fluoridel9 have been identified, it
has not yet been possible to identify all the reaction products from the dissooia-
tion reactions of nickel(II)} fluoride.

5.3 OXIDE BEHAVIOR
5-3. 1 Oxide Behavior in Fuels

gh-melting—point oxides .are . generally very. sparingly soluble in fluoride

,fuels, but when compared with each other at reactor temperatures the apparent solu-

bilities may differ by~severa1 orders-of. magnitude.z The "differences provide the

" “basis for metathetical reactions between oxides and fliuorides, many . of which are
n_-:ﬁpotentially useful for. reprocessing fuels.20 However, the very. low solubility of

The possibility that ZrOa may be preferentially precipitated in the presence

E;n;of UFu ‘is under investigation.i:Quantitative evaluations are not yet available

these results are borne out, the hazard of oxide precipitation in the MSRE could
involve ZrO, ratner than UOp, and this much more favorable situation could be

 
 

 

 

 

80

achieved without causing a noticeable increase in vapor pressure or important
changes in other physical properties.

Demonstrations of the metathetical reactions involving oxides in fuel mixtures
have been carried out in Pyrex apparatus in a furnace equipped for visual observa-

tion. The oxide from Pyrex contaminates the melt sufficiently slowly that the oxide

content can be considered constant over short ranges of time.

The oxide present in clear solvents such as LiF-BeFp mixtures can be titrated
with UFy. A black precipitate of UO2 settles to the bottom until the end point is
reached, when the green color of UFh (detectible at 300 ppm) becomes apparent.

Either ZrF), or ThF) added to LiF-BeFQ containing precipitated UO» caused a
dissolution of at least part of the precipitate, and ZrO, seemed to be more insolu-
ble than UOs. Analyses of samples removed with a glass filter stick from molten
LioBeF) saturated with ThOp gave a solubility of 2.03 wt % or 8.05 x 10'5 moles of
ThO, dissolved in 100 g, and the solubility of BeO appears to be about 0.22 mole/lOO &

5.3.2 Zirconium Oxyfluoride and Attempted Preparation of Uranous Oxyflubride

Oxyfluorides were studied because they may result from the contamination of the
molten reactor fuel with oxides. Although some earlg workers claimed to have pre-
pared UOFp, the compound has not been substantiated.2l Wright and Warf22 found that
UOo and UF) did not combine on heating to 1000°C.

The synthesis of ZrOF2 from ZrF) and ZrO2 was performed and crystallographic
data were obtained. Zirconium oxyfluoride also sometimes forms when ZrO, is reacted
with molten NH,HF,.

Although UOF, is not known, an attempt wag made to form a mixed uranous-
zirconium oxyfluoride. The ionic radius of Ut¥ (0.97A) 1s sufficiently close to
that of Zr+4 (0.80A) that a solid-solid solution was considered likely. Reaction
of ZrF), with UOp at 1000°C yielded UF) and ZrOp rather than the hypothetical
UZr(OFa)Q. If a solid solution does form, it is very limited, as UF) was still s
major constituent of a fusion corresponding to the composition 4ZrOo.4ZrF),-UF).U0s.

5.4 GRAPHITE COMPATIBILITY
S.4.1 Removal of Oxide from Graphite by Treatment with Hydrogen

The feasibility of a hydrogen treatment for removing oxide from the MSRE
moderator graphite appears to be unsatisfactory. A specimen (1-1/2 in. in diameter
and 2 in. long) of low-permeability R-0025 graphite obtained from the National Car-
bon Co. was treated with hydrogen at 600°C for 6 hr at a flow rate of ~2 liters/min.
Following this treatment, the specimen was degassed at 1000°C for 21 hr. The results
are given in Table 5.4 along with data obtained from two similar specimens of R-0025
graphite which had been degassed thoroughly at 600°C prior to degassing at 1000°C.

f Because of the variation of the gas content from sample to sample, it is diffi-
cult to establish whether the hydrogen treatment had any beneficial effect. At best

~ the treatment removed less than half the surface oxide and, since this would be the
portion most readily removed, a satisfactory cleanup would require a prohibitively

long period of treatment.

A sample of AGOT-NC6, which is more pervious, is being hydrogen-treated. Pre-
liminary indications here also point toward a removal by the Hp treatment of only
about half the oxide in the graphite.

5.4.2 Behavior of Graphite when Wetted by a Molten Fluoride

Among the molten fluorides which have been observed to soak through graphite
containers rather rapidly, and are therefore presumed to wet graphite, are CsF,
PoFp, and SnFp. Of these, SnFo (m. p. 213°C) has been selected as the most con-
venient for study. The presumptive evidence for wetting by SnFo was confirmed by
the appearance of a thin film of salt on graphite which has been exposed to SnFo
melts. In a rough measurement with a DeNouy tensiometer the surface tension of SnF,

at 290°C was found to be about 90 dynes/cm, compared with about 190 to 200 dynes/cm
for the MSRE fuel.

As an exploratory test the rate of permeation by SnFp was followed by examin-
ing 1-in.-long cylinders (1/2 in. in diameter) of AGOT graphite which had been
immersed in molten SnFp for various times at about 230°C. Weight increases, as
obtained from density measurements after removing the adherent salt, varied approxi-
mately linearly with the logarithm of time in the interval between 10 and 1000 min
(10, 20, and 27% at 10, 100, and 1000 min, respectively). The rate during this
interval.was conJectured to. have been controlled chiefly by the diffusion of trapped

;s*gas, occupying the graph1te voids.;x,- T

The results for the two NeF-BeFz (57-43 mole %) mixtures show somewhat lower
surface tensions than that obtained with the NaF-BeFp (63-37 mole %) salt, Thus,
at 650°C, o for sample 1 (see Fig. 6.1) is 8.5% below and o for ssmple 2 is 2.5%
 below the velue for semple 3. The discrepancy of 6% between samples 1 and 2
(having essentially identical compositions) may relate to the longer operstion=l
~exposure of ssmple 1 in the circulating loop from which the specimens were drawn
and hence to the increassed amount of corrosion-product contaminants. An analysis
of the semples for Fe, Ni, and Cr will be made. The effect of impurities on the
- surface tension of a fluid is illustrated by recent results on ¢ for two distilled-
- water samples using the maximum-bubble-pressure method. For the first of these, &
‘sample obtained directly from the laboratory distilled-Hz20 supply line, o was meas-
ured as 67 to 68 dynes/cm; while for the second (triply distilled end doubly de-
ionized), o was found to be T2 to 73 dynes/cm.

The surface tension was caelculated from the Schrodinger equation,

3 o), - )] r-37%0,, @

written so as to make spparent the correction to the maximnm.bubble-pressure (as
indicated by a precision water manometer) arising from the "hydrostatic" pressure
due to the immersion of the cepillary tip below the salt surface. In Eq. (1), r
-1s the capillary rasdius, h, the fluid head, and p, the fluid density; the sub-
scripts m and s designate the manometer fluid and the salt, respectively.
Terms of the Schrodinger equation higher than the second degree in r have been
neglected in that they represent an sdjustment of only 0.1% in the value of the
surface tension.

Exemination of Eq. (1) shows that the precision of the o-measurement may be
related to errors in the pressure messurement, in the determination of the cap-
illary radius, and in the value of the salt density. It is believed that the
residual errors associasted with the pressure and geometrical meassurements have
been reduced to a total of *3%. Thus the biggest remaining source of error is in
the salt density; e.g., an uncertainty of +10% in the salt density leads to an
additional *3% variation in 0. Accordingly, en experimental determination of the
densities of these mixtures is planned.

A comparison of predicted and experimental densities for the NaF-BeFz (63-37
mole %) mixture is given in Fig. 6.2. It is seen from this figure that the curve

(A) representing the mean of the experimental measurements® at ORNL lies sbout 7%
sbove the line (D) obtained from the Cchen and Jones® correlation of the measured
densities of 15 fluoride mixtures of diversified composition. This correlation
is reported as showing a maximum devistion of 6%, In similar fashion a general
density correlation based on more than 60 measurements by Blanke et 21.% at the
Mound ILeboratory on compositions in the NaF-BeFp-UF4 system ylelded curve C. If
the density data for NaF-BeFz mixtures alone are asbstracted from the total of the
Mound dats and cross-plotted as a function of the NaF content (for various temper-
atures), curve B results. In the calculation of the surface tensions reported in
Table 6.1, the correlation developed from the data of Blenke et al. was used to
estimate the salt densities.

6.1.2 Heat Capacity

The correlstion of the heat capacities of BeFg-containing salt mixtures has
been revised to correct errors in the original presentation7 and to include gddi-
tional experimental data. The results are summarized in Fig. 6.3 in terms of the
average heat capacity over the temperature range 550 to 800°C and the "mean molec-
ular weight" (the ratio of the molecular weight to the average number of atom
species in the mixture, M/N). In obtaining the correlating line,

c, = kel (/)= 110, (2)
the data point for LiF-BeFo-UFgq (70-10-20 mole %) was omitted. The maximum devie-

tion of the remaining date from Eq. (2) is *8.5%; LiF-BeF2-UF4 (70-10-20 mole %)
falls 16% below the correlation and its heat capacity will be redetermined.

6.2 HEAT-TRANSFER STUDIES

The experimental study of the heat-transfer coefficients for the salt mix-~

 ture LiF-BeFa-UF4-ThF, (67-18.5-0.5-14 mole %) flowing in heated Inconel and

- INOR-8 tubes was interrupted after 5560 hr of circulastion to replace the LFB

- pump. Damage to the pump seems to be restricted to one of the shaft bearings;
visual observation of the pump bowl and impeller showed no obvious effects from
exposure to the salt., A new pump and belt drive have been installed, Since the
flow characteristic of this pump can be expected to be somewhat different from

- that of the original pump, & recalibration with respect to the turbine flowmeter
will be necessary. . .

A large ssmple of salt was found in the vicinity of the ring sesal st the
top of the pump bowl, This sample was submitted for chemical analysis; the re-
sults are listed in Table 6.2 in comparison with the nominsl and preoperational
compositions for the mixture, The extent of circulation of the ring-sesl sample

is unknown, since the salt could have been deposited and frozen in this location

- at any time during the 5560 hr of operation. A representative sasmple will be
obteined from the sump for analysis. Although no measure of the magnesium con-
 tent of the original salt is available for comparison, it is believed that the
presence of magnesium in the ring-seal sample results from the introduction of
a small amount of magnesium-bearing thermal insulation into the system during
the replacement of a liquid-level probe located in the pump.

The effect of this uncertainty in composition on the analysis of the data
is significant. For example, the use of the analysis for the preoperational
salt rather than the nominal in estimating the properties results in a 3% in-
crease in the mean heat capacity of the mixture (see Fig. 6.3). Variations
could also be expected in the other thermal properties of interest — the viscos-
ity and the thermal conductivity — though the changes will probably be of lesser
megnitude then indicated for the heat capacity.

7. FUEL PROCESSING

Thorium fluoride will be present in MSR fuels either intentionally in a one-

region reactor or as a result of leakage of blanket salt into the fuel in a two-

- region reactor. Preliminary investigations indicate that SbF5-HF solutions may be
- useful for decontaminating the ThF) from rare-earth fission products. Since the
- LiF carrier of the fuel salt interferes by precipitating the SbFg, it must be re-
“'moved from the fuel by HF dissolution first. Leaching the HF-insoluble residue
with SbFg5-HF solution would probably decontaminate the ThF), sufficiently for re-use
in the blanket. The behavior of fission products other than rare earths has not
yet been investigated. This particular solvent was considered because it has been
reportedl that SbFg is the strongest "acid" in HF of a number of compounds investi-
gated, and that rare-earth fluorides are soluble in SbF -HF solutions. Other HF
dissolution systems for MSR fuel processing are general basic in nature. . '

In the initial work, HF containing about 20% SbF5 was used for the solvent.
‘Rare-earth fluorides dissolved rapidly to give clear brown solutions; the absence
of precipitation on partial evaporation 4ndicated a high rare-earth solubility,
probably as the compound RE(SbF5 3o This formuls was deduced from the results of
adding liquid SbF: to dry powdered rare-earth fluorides. Considerable heat was
evolved, and the giquid appeared to wet and darken the color of the powder. These
effects were incomplete until 3 moles of SbFs had been added per mole of rare-earth
fluoride; above this ratio some excess liquid SbFg was present. The compound was
not appreciably soluble in liquid SbFg but was extremely soluble in HF, to perhaps
200 to 300 g of rare-earth fluoride per liter. If less than three SbF5 molecules
are present per rare-earth fluoride molecule, solution is incomplete, but excess
SbFg does not interfere. Addition of small amounts of water to the HF solutions
resulted in a precipitate. -

Thorium tetrafluoride 1s probably less baslic in HF than the rare earths. It
did not react with SbFg or dissolve in SbFS-HF solutions. From mixtures of the rare-
earth fluorides and 4, SbF5-HF solutions dissolved the rare earths but not the ThFy.
The 20% SbF5 -~ HF reacted with IiF, forming an insoluble compound. Addition
of SbFg to an HF solution of LiF resulted in precipitation of a white solid, pro-
bably LiSbFg. Addition of LiF to an HF solution of SbFs resulted in formation of
a white solid, apparently different from the I4F.

. AlY observations reported here are qualitative since anslytical results have :
not yet been obtained.
