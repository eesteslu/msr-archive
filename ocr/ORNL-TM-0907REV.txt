2. PROCESS DESCRIPTION

2.1 Hp-HF Treatment for Oxide Removal

‘Moisture or oxygen inleakage into the reactor salt system or use of

. helium cover gas containing moisture or oxygen could cause oxide accumu-
,y'lation in the salt and, eventually, precipitation of solids. Tn' the flush
© o or coolant salts, the precipitated solid would be BeO, which has a solu-

L bility of.approximately 290 ppm at.1200°F (see Fig. 2.1): Zirconium

tetrafluoride was added to the fuel salt as an oxygen getter to prevent

"small amounts of oxygen from. causing uranium precipitation. If the flush

salt is contaminated with.fuel salt up to approximately 0.01 mole of zir-.

- conium per kg of salt (~ l% fuel in flush salt), there would be insuf-

ficient zirconium present: to exceed the solubility of ZrOz at 1112°F
and eany precipitate would;be BeO. Above‘this zirconium condentration,
exceeding the soldbility'limit-would cause ZrOsz precipitation. When
sufficlent Zr0z has precipitated to reduce the Zr:U ratio to ~ 5, co-
precipitation of ZrOz and Uogrvill occur. The effect of 3% contamination
of the flush selt with fuel salt is shown.in Fig. 2.1.

‘Oxides Will be removed by treating the fuel or flush salt in the

fuel storage tank. (see Fig. 2. 2) with s mixture of Ha and HF gas. In

. the treatment. process, HF will react with the oxide to form the fluoride
‘and water, the water will beievolved along withrthe_hydrogen and excess
" HF. The Hs will preventaerceSSive corroSion of the INOR-8 structural

material by“maintaining a reducing'condition in, the salt.  The gases will

x‘pass through an NaF bed for decontamination before monitoring for water

determination, The gas stream will then ‘pass through a caustic scrubber 1

. for neutralization of the HF.. The hydrogen will go to the offgas system.

The‘treatment will- be terminated when water is no longer detected in the

'offgas stresm. A finel sparglng vith helium will remove,dissolved HF.

2.1. 2 Hydrofluorination

f

. Hydrogen fluoride will be obtained in 100-1b cylinders. One cylinder

\.rwill provide sufficient HF for 92 hr of processing at a flow rate of
9 liters/min (Ha HF = 10 l) The HF cylinder will be partially submerged
r.rin a water bath heated with 1ow-pressure steam to provide sufficient

pressure for the required flow rate.w Since heating of the cylinders

7above 125°F is not recommended ‘there is a pressure. alarm on. the exit

-gas set at 22 psig The HF gas will pass through an electric heater to

;raise the temperature above 180°F and reduce the molecular weight to 20
lf: for accurate flOW'metering.- The hydrogen flow will be started‘before the

THF flow to minimize corrosion._ The hydrogen flow rate will be set at \

‘the rotameter at the gas supply station west of the building The hydro-~

'gen fluoride flow rate will be regulated by the controller on the \

o panelboard in the high-bay area. The'salt backup prevention valve must

be closed with the manual switoh until flow is started, at which time the
differential pressure switch will maintain ‘the valve in the closed po-

-wsition unless the tank pressure exceeds the HQ-HF pressure.

The offgas stream leaving the fuel storage tank will consist of hy-

drogen, water, _excess hydrogen fluoride, and helium. Volatilization of

fission and corrosion products is expected to be much lower than during

fluorination because of the reducing effect of the hydrogen. Fission

- products that are partially volatilized 88 fluorides during fluorination,

- such as ruthenium,_niobium, and antimony, are expected to exist in the

metallic state.  Any chromium in the salt from corrosion is expected to
be in the nOnvolatile +2 or +3 valence state. The offgas ‘stream will
pass through a heated line to the NaF trap. The line will be heated to -

e.200°F to prevent condensation of Hao-HF

The salt temperature is not oritical during Hg-HF treatment since
corrosion and fission product volatilization are not important For.

rapid oxide removal it is necessary that all the oxide is in solution.

~ The salt temperature should be adjusted about 50°F higher than that 1nai-
| cated by the oxide analysis and solubility curves. The temperature |
should not be maintained higher than necessary since this lowers the HF
, solubility and consequently the HF utilization.

- The hydrogen fluoride and Hz flow Will be stopped when no more water
is detected in the offgas stream. The salt will then be sparged with

helium. to remove dissolved HF ‘and to purge ‘the system of HF and hydrogen."
_f;The gas stream will ‘be checked for hydrogen before it enters the offgas
1_fduct by passing a small stream through a . hydrogen monitor. S

o 2.1. 3 NaF Trapping

'y remotely removable NaF bed is provided in the fuel processing

i'cell to remove small amounts of volatilized fission or corrosion productS“
- from the offgas stream 'The trap will be maintained ‘at 750°F to prevent
'”7g5adsorption of HF. Since the vapor pressure of HF over NaF is 1 atm at
"h1532°F the trap could be operated at a “‘somewhat lower temperature, but
'750°F will be required to prevent UFg adsorption during fluorination (see
Sect. 2.2.3), and this temperature was selected for both operations.
 

 

' 2.1.4 Monitoring for Water

The removal of oxides Pfrom the salt will be followed by passing a

S

2 cc/min side stream of the gas stresm from the NaF trap. through a - ‘ -
water monitor (See Fig. 2. 3). This monitor- consists of an NaF trap for |
removal of HF from. the sample stream.before it is passed through an
'electrolytic hygrometer. ‘The part of the monitor through which the
'.radioactive sample passes is located in the absorber cubicle for contain-;
ment. Integrationiof the monitorrreadings indicates the total emount of
oxide removed : ' | '

A more elaborate but less accurate method of determining the oxide
removal by cold-trapping, was installed before the water monitor was de-
" veloped. Since the monitor performed very well during the flush salt
processing, the cold trap serves only as a backup for the monitor and &
qualitative check on the end point., | As originally conceiVed several- S
runs would have been required.under steady operating conditions to ob-
tain data for correlation of cold trap volume with oxide content Be-f
cause of the excellent performance of the monitor these runs have not . e
‘been made. However, the absence of water in the gas streem.will be seen i |
in the cold trap system by the termination of condensation and.reduced
heat load on the trap.

2.1.5 Offgas Handling

, The hydrogen fluoride will be neutralized in a static caustlc
scrubber tank. + Hydrogen and helium from the- scrubber will pass ‘through
an activated-charcosal trap and a flame arrester before entering ‘the cell
ventilation duct, . The cell ventilation air will pass through an absolute
- filter, located in the spare cell, before going to the main filters end
stack. As mentioned before, 1ittle activity is expected in the offgas
stream- during Ho-HF treatment '
Since the fluorine disposal system will not be used during HQ-HF
 treatment but will still be connected to the scrubber inlet line, the
system must be purged to prevent diffusion and condensation of HgO-HF in '

. 2 i.6 Liguid Waste Disposal

- The caustic scrubber will be charged with 1300 liters of 2 M KOH
prepared by dilution of & 45% KOH solution._ Three 115-gal. batches of
2M (10%) KOH will be prepared in & portsble mix tank in the high-bay
-area and charged through a line provided with a menual valve and a check |
~_valve, Dilution to 2 M will be required because of the possibility of
gel formation in KF solutions of greater than 2.M. - :

At 9, 1-liters/min HF flow, the KOH - will have to be replaced every |
4 days when the final concentration is 0.35 M. Tt will, therefore, be
necessary to Jet the KOH solution to the liquid waste tank and replace

it with fresh caustic when 8 100 -1b HF cylinder has been consumed.

2.2 Urenium Recovery

2 2o 1 Summarx

The fuel or flush salt should be allowed to decay as long as possible

‘before fluorination to minimize the discharge of the volatile fission-
product fluorides that will be formed by the oxidizing action of the
fluorine. The most important volatile activities are iodine, tellurium,
niobium, ruthenium, ‘and- antimony. However, salt samples during reactor
* operation have shown only iodine remaining in the salt in large concen-
- trations. '
After decay, the salt batch will be fluOrinated in the fuel storage
tank., The offgas containing UFs, excess fluorine, and volatile activity
will pass through s high-temperature NaF trap for decontamination and
- chromium removal before absorption on loﬁ%temperature”NaF absorbers.
Excess fluorine will be reacted with S0z to prevent'damage t0'the'Fiber-
glas filters. Before filtration the offgas will be further decontami-‘
‘nated by passage through an activated charcoal bed. '
The absorbers will be transported to another facility where they will
fbe desorbed and “the UFg cold_trapped and.collected in product cylinders.

2.2.2 Fluorinmation:

" Uranium will be recovered from ‘the molten salt by sparging with

' fluorine to convert the Uﬁgto volatile UFs. The fluorine will be diluted
with en equal volume of helium when fluorine is detected in the offgas
’ i stream to reduce the number of times. the fluorine trailer must be changed;

This should have 1ittle effect on the overall processing time, since
utilization is expected to be low after most of the ‘uranium has been

volatilized A total gas flow of ebout 50 liters/min should provide good

agitation, The salt sample line will be purged with helium during
fluorinstion to prevent- UFg diffusion and will be heated to prevent =

~ condensation, The temperature of'the melt_will_be maintained as low as
- practical Q~_30'to 50°F above the ligquidus of 813°F) to keep corrosion

and fission-produCt-volatilization to & minimumg Boiling points of some

_volatilb-fluorides-are listed in Table 2.2. The heaters on the upper
-half and top'df'the tank-will'not be used during'fluorination to reduce
- salt entrainment but they will be turned on after fluorination to melt

down splatter and condensation.

There will be an initial induction period before evolution of UFg
begins, The extent of £his'per1od will depend onfthe amount of uranium
in the salt and the degree of agitation of the salt. A minimum of
0.5 mole of fluorine per mole of uranium will be required to eonrert 8ll . : 5
the UFy to UFs. After this, UFg will begin to form and be evolved. At
' 50 liters/min of fluorine; UFg evolution can begin‘dbout 2'hr after the
start of fluorinetion. Since the vapor space between fhe salt and the
first absorber is ~ 1300 liters, another 15 min will prdbably be re-
quired before ebsorption begins.

Volatility Pilot Plant data show that essentially no fluorine is
~evolved until at least 1 mole of fluorine per mole of-uranium has been
added or the system has bperated 6 hr at 50 liters/min, However, until

more. is known sbout the sparging efficiency and the effect of the fuel
| storage tank geqmetry and salt compog&ition, the fluorine disposal system
will be put in operation at the start of fluorine flow with sufficient
SOa to react with 50 liters of fluorine per minute. -

- Evolution of UFg will be followed by means of the absorber fempera- ;o

tures. Fluorine breakthrough should be detectable by'temperature rise in"
_ the fluorine reactor. When fluorine breakthrough is detected, the fluorine
flow will be reduced to one-half and an equal flow of helium will be
started This will maintain the necessary degree of mixing while pro-
viding sufficient fluorine to prevent the back reaction '

t]

2 UFg - 2 UFs + Fa.

Corrosion can consume as\much as 3 liters of.fluorine per minute
(0.2 mil/hr). |

With the 35%-enriched uranium fuel salt it will be necessary to
replace the absorbers three times. Before this can be done,,the salt
mst be sparged with helium to remove dissolved UFg and fluorine and to
purge the gas space of UFg. After sparging before absorber changes and
‘at the end of flubrination, the salt will be sampled to check on the
uranium removal.

It will be necessary to replace the fluorlne trailer every 3- 1/2 hr
at a fluorine fiow rate of 50 liters/min or every T hr with one-half flow. . gﬁ},

" however, so’ downtime shouid not be long. o .

S

© There is sufficient space at the gas supply station to have only one

trailer connected at a time. Additional trailers will be at the site,

Corrosion will be much.more severe under the strongly oxidizing con—

| fditions of fluorination than during “the Ho-HF treatment. A_corrosion
. rate of 0.5 mil/hr was ‘experienced in the Volatility Pilot Plant in a .
- nickel vessel'_ Fluorination of the high»uranium-content salt (fuel salt C) .
. may take as long as 50 hr, but recovery of small amounts of uranium from

the flush salt should require mich less time. A. So-hr fluorination would"

- cause an average corrosion of approximately 3% of . the fuel storage tank
~wall at 0.2 mil/hr ~ Corrosion of the fuel storage tank.may be less than

in the VPP because of the. smaller surface- to-volume ratio, the use of
dilute fluorine, and the lower fluorination temperature, also corrosion

| tests indicate that INOR-B may be more corrosion resistant than nickel.

2.2.3 NaF Trapping
The NaF bed will be important during fluorination for uranium.re-

. -covery because of the greater volatilization of fission end corrosion
. products then during oxide removal The bed will again be maintained at

750°F; which. is above the decomposition temperature of the'UFs-anaF
complex (702°F at 1000 mm) Any volatilized PuFg will absorb on the NaF
and ‘provide separation from the uranium,_ Sodium fluoriderat 750°F. will

7remove essentially -all of therniobium and ruthenium from the fluorinator
' offgas stream, and these will be the .pri_nc.i_pal activities that could cause -
_ ' product contamination.*Morefibdinewill_volatize-but.vill not absorb on
. hot or-cold NeF. Essentialiydall'the chromium‘fluoridedvill he absorbed.
:Chromium is troublesome‘not only because of the gamma activity of the
ff51Cr formed by neutron activation but also because of the inactive
alchromium that' will collect in valves and Small lines and cause plugging
and seat leakage. All piping “to and from the NaF bed:must he heated to
- above 200°F ‘to prevent UFs. condensation. Table 2. 3 shows the expected |

2.2.4 UFg_Absorption
The decontaminated UFg gas from the T50°F NaF bed will flow to five

NaF absorbers in series, which are located in a sealed cubicle 1n the
high-bay ares. These absorbers will be cooled with air, as required, to
prevent uranium loss. At 300°F the vapor pressure of UFg over the
UFg-2NaF camplex will be 0.1 T, end uranium losses will be significant
(2.4 g of U per hour with a flow of 50 liters/min). The capacity of NaF
for'UFg varies ihversely with the temperature, since the more rapid re-
action at higher temperatures inhibits penetration of the UFg by eealing
off the eXte;nal pores with UFg-QNaF.a .To obtain maximum ceapacity the
cobling-air should therefore be turned dn as soon as a temperature rise
is indicated The absorber temperatures should not exceed 250°F Also,
‘with low fluorine concentration at elevated temperatures there could be
& reduction of UFg-2NaF to UFs-2NaF, which would remain with the NaF when
the UFg was desorbed from the NaF. The loading of the ebsorbers can be ,
r!f011owedrby bed temperatures, and the air'Can be aéjusted as required.
The air will be discharged to the cell by a small blower in the cell.

A portable alpha activity monitor will be used to detect leaks of
UFg in the cubicle. - In the ‘event of & leak in the absorber cubicle, the -
fluorine flow would be stopped and the cubicle would be purged with air-

- and opened for repairs. The . location of the leak should be detectable

either visually or with an alpha brobe.
" Vhen fluorination has been completed the absorbers will be discon—
nected and sent to another facility for desorption and cold trapping of

- the UFg. It will be necessary to stop fluorination vhen the absorbers
‘are loaded»and replace the absorbers as noted above. This will require
8 complete purging of the system to remove all UFG from the connecting

A.:PiPins-

2 2.5 Excess Fluorine Disposal .

Since an average efficiency of less than 25% is expected during

fluorination, there will be a 1arge excess of fluorine. - If this fluorine

were allowed to flow through the offgas filters, damage to the Fiberglas
might result with release of any accumulated activity. To prevent this,'

~the excess fluorine-will be reacted with an excess of SOz. Both the soa
'and the Fa will be preheated: electrically to 300 to LOO°F and then fed
"into e Monel reactor wrapped.with steam coils. The steam will serve the
.dual purpose of keeping the reactor warm to initiate the reaction and of
fcooling the reactor after the reaction 1s started. The reaction is
_strongly exothermic and proceeds smoothly at L00° F. The product is

: cSOgFg,‘a relatively inert gas._ An activated alumina trap is installed

downstream of the Fé reactor for a backup of the soa system., This trap

-~ will dispose of any unreacted fluorine resulting from insufficient S0z
':'or other malfunction in the 802 system. '

2. 2 6 Offges Handling

The fluorination offgas stream from the activated alumina trap will

'then pass through the empty caustic scrubber tank. The scrubber tank
;foffgas will pess through the activated-charcoal traps ‘for additional
‘ ‘,ffissionuproduct removal before entering ‘the cell ventilation duct Just
. upstresm of the sbsolute filter in the spare cell, The cell air will then
- go to the main filters and be discharged from the 100 -t containment stack.

3. BQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION

3.1 Plant ILayout

| The main portion of the fuel—handling and -processing system is in -
- the fuel-processing cell, immediately north of the drain tank cell in ' '
Building 7503, as shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The gas supply station

1is outside the building, ﬁest of the drain tenk cell. The offgas filter,
hydrogen flame arrester, activated-charcoal trap, and weste salt removal
line are in the spare cell east of the fuel-processing cell' The system
“will be operated from the high-bay area over the cell, where a smell instru-
:ment panelboard is located., Also in the hithbay area are the salt-
charging area, the UFs absorber cubicle, the salt sampler for the fuel
_storage tank, and an instrument cubicle., The instrument cubicle contains
- the instrument transmitters and. check and block valves connected directly
to process equipment and it is sealed and monitored. Figures 3.3 and
3.hﬁare photographs of the fuel-processing cell and theroperating ares,
respectively. - ' '

' 3.2 Maintenance

‘Since corrosion is expected to be very low during Ha-HF treatment
and only four fluorinations are planned maintenance\problems are not ex-
pected to be severe . The system, with a few exceptions, has therefore
been designed for direct maintenance, with savings in cost and complexity
of equipment. The exceptions are the NaF trap, activated alumine trap,
- salt filter, and two air-operated valves, The NaF trap may become
plugged by volatilized chromium: fluoride during fluorination. In this
case it would be moved to one side and 8 new trap installed It is

therefore_flanged into the system and has disconnects for thermocouples

. and electrical power. The alumina trap and salt filter is also flanged'

for replacement The valves haVe flanges with vertical bolts and dis-

connects for the air lines, The valves, filter and traps are located

" under roof plugs sized to pass through the portable maintenance shield

This shield can also be used for viewlng and for ‘external- decontamlnation "
. of equipment should this be required because of a leak All heaters in | i ﬁE,)
the cell have duplicate spares 1nstalled

'-', If a serious piping or equipment leak occurs before processing has

been completed or if entrance into the cell-is required for other

reasons after irradiated fuel hes been processed aqueous decontamination

"may be required The recommended method 1is described in Report ORNL—2550

_ (Ref 3) and consists of (l) barren salt flushes to displace as much &s
Q ”possible of the irradiated salt (2) aqueous ammonium oxalste ‘flushes to
" remove the salt film, (3) nitric acid-aluminum nitrate flushes to remove

- metallic scale from the surfaces, and (4) sodium hydroxide-hydrogen

| 3 3 1 TFuel Storage Tank

peroxide sodium tartrate flushes for gas line decontamination.

3 3 In-Cell Equipment

The fuel storage tank in which chemical processing will take place is
similar to the reactor drain tanks - The tank is shown in Figure 3.5,

and design data are. given in Table 3 1.

The height of the storage tank was increased by 30 in. over the

,height of the drain and flush tanks to minimize salt carryover due to

sparging during chemical processing. About 38% freeboard is provided -

| above the normal liquid level

The tank is heated by four sets of heaters in the bottom, the lower
half, ‘the upper half and the top of the tenk, Each set of heaters is

controlled separately with powerstats. Every heater has 8 duplicate in-
" stalled spare with leads outside the cell ‘The heaters are mounted on a
:frame that is supported from the floor to minimize the tare weight on the .
'.weigh cells, | " | |

“The tenk has two dip tubes, ‘one. for ges sparging and the other for

,fcharging and discharging salt The sparge line is a’ l—in.,pipe that is
"closed at the bottom and has four 1/2-in, holes 90° epart near the bottom.
,,,The salt dip tube lies on the bottom of the tank at the center to mini-.
-~ mize holdup (approximately 0. 1% of & full batch). Tiquid level is deter-
| ;mined by weighing the tank with two pneumatic weigh cells, The“weigh‘.'
- ecell calibration can be checked by an ultrasonic single point probe. When
~the tank is not being pressurized for ‘salt transfer, the sparge dip tube |
'and PdI-69h provide another continuous salt level indicator. Other instru-
-ments provided are 13 surface—mounted thermocouples and a pressure-recorder

- The gas ‘enters on the outside of an. internal cylindrical baffle and
',leaves inside the baffle, end ‘thus the gas path is almost 2 ft fora
.12-in. depth of pellets. Gas velocities are kept below 4 £t/min to -pre-
vent carryover of fines containing absorbed fission-product fluorides,
The trep has thermowells at the inlet, center, and exit. Heat is
controlled by separate variacs for the center and the outside of the bed.
Spare heaters are installed | I
| Since there is a possibility of plugging of this trap with chromium
- during fluorination, it is designed for remote replacement The inlet
| iand exit lines are provided with ring- Joint flanges at the trap and some
distance away to permit removal of sections of the lines for access to
the trap. Thermocouple and electrical disconnects ere‘provided on_the

trap. and e standard. lifting bail issmounted on & strap-over the trap.

Heat generation in the NaF trap at the end of fluorination could be v

as high as L4000 Btu/hr 1f all the °°Nb after 30-d decay remains in the
salt during reactor operation and collects in the trap during processing.
Of this heat, 1100 Btu/hr will be removed by the process gas stream and

~ 2000 Btu/hr through the insulation with the heaters off.. To remove the

remaining 900 Btu/hr and ensure that the exit half of the bed (internal
annulus) does not exceed 800°F, air cooling is provided in the center'
~ pipe. A heat transfer coefficient of 1 Btu/hr-£t®:°F will remove ~
" 1000 Btu/hr with 8 cfm of air.
‘The trap will be by-passed if aqueous decontamination is necessary
to permit direct maintenance on cell components. In this case the trap
will be replaced with a Jumper line to permit flow of solutions through

A

,the entire system.

3. 3 3 Cold Trap

The extent of oxide removal from the salt during H24HF treatment will
be determined.by cold trapping the offgas stream.and measuring the volume

of water and HF condensed. The cold.trap is shown in Figure 3.7, and
design data are given in Table 3.3. The inlet end of the trep is in the
' northwest corner of the cell and the trap extends eastward with a 3°

.kslope. The inletiand_outlet brine connections are reducing tees at each

end\of the jacket.

The offgas from the scrubber tank is routed to the spare cell nhere
it passes through an. activated-charcoal trap and a flsme arrester before
discharge into the cell ventilation duct The gas should be free of air

or flame arrested.
3.3.6 NaF Absorbers

The absorbers for collecting UFg on NaF pellets are made of carbon
-steel which is sufficiently resistant t0 fluorine for- the short exposures
involved. The absorbers will be used for processing only one batch and
will thenibe discarded to the burial ground. The absorbers are shown in
Fig. 3.9 and design data are given in Table 3.5._‘A bed depth of 10 in.
(24 kg of NaF) will be used. ’
| Each absorber is mounted in an open top container with an air dis-
tributor pipe.in the bottom. Cooling air flows around the outside and up

Each sbsorber is provided with a thermowell immersed in the NaF
pellets near the gas inlet Since absorption of UFg %o form UFG'ENaF
liberates 23.9 kecal per mole, the start of UFg absorption and the break-
through to the succeeding absorber in the train can be followed by ob-
serving the temperature rise.

_ The absorbers are -connected with jumper lines having ring- joint _
flanges with pigtails for local leak detection before sealing the cubicle.
| The lines in the cubicle all have tubulaer heaters to prevent UFg conden-

__,sation. No spares are installed because the cubicle is accessible to the

high-bay area when processing is stopped
3.3.7 Fluorine Disposal System

~ The excess fluorine is disposed of by reacting it with 802 to form
SOgFé, which is a relatively inert gas and can be safely passed through
the Fiberglas filters in the offgas system. Design of the system is
based on the system in use at_the'Goodyear Atomic Corporation'at bet3<"’

'mouth, Ohio. Since the quantity of fluorine to be disposed of is similar,

the seme size eduipment'is used, except.for the fluorine preheater, The

&
 

 

 

N

N

"

31

fluorine at Portsmouth is diluted to about 10%, while the fluorination

| ',offgas will be nearly 100% fluorine toward the end of the processing. The
fluorine preheater can therefore be the seme size as the S0z preheater. .

Some construction details have been changed to adapt the equipment to

’, remote radioactive service.

The equipment is shown in Fig 3 10, and the design data for the sys-

'tem are given in Table 3.6. - Both gas streams are preheated to 400°F
‘before contacting in the fluorine reactor. -Each preheater has three sepa-

rate heaters with installed spares - Each heater is controlled separately
by an off-on switch.  The low-pressure steam coil on the inlet half of the

 fluorine reactor supplies heat at the start to initiate +the reaction and

acts as & coolant to remove the heat of reaction after the reaction ‘
begins., Tt is desired to keep the temperature below 1000°F to minimize
corrosion.

An activated alumina trap, Fig. 3.11, is installed downstream of the

“Fz reactor as mentioned in Section 2.2.5. The trap is installed with
| ring Joint flanges and located in an accessible position to facilitate

replacement in case of plugging The trap is constructed of 6- -in. inconel .

- pipe and contains ~ 3 £t3 of activated alumina, enough to contain 1

trailer of. fluorine.r Two thermowells are provided near the inlet to indi-

- cate fluorine breakthrough from the SOz system. The flanges are connected

to the leak detector system outside the cell,

3. 3.8 Cubicle Exhsuster ‘,_ o -

The air in the absorber cubicle is maintained at a negative pressure

';f_with respect. to the high-bay area by an exhauster located in the fuel-

processing cell., This is an exhauster with a capacity of 250 cfm at
10.5 in, Hx0. Tt is driven by a 3/h hp -3450- rpm 4ho-v 3- phase notor.

:ffThe suction 81de is connected to the cubicle by a k- in._steel pipe routed
-thhrough the space west of the cell. The discharge is open to the cell
| 'without any connecting piping. ‘A L-in, plug cock is provided in the
'frsuction line in the cnbicle, with an access flange on the cubicle to

- permit closing the valve_with:the,gasketed top in place_for.leak checking. -

Since the\system will:be completely purged of air before processing

3.h.4 HF Trep

The fluorine used will contain up to 5% HF, which could_cause plugging
of the UFg absorbers by formation of NaF.2HF, NaF-BﬂF; ete.,) if not re- - |
moved. Therefore the trap shown in Fig. 3.12 and described in Table 3.7
-is provided in the fluorine line at the gaslsupply station.

The inlet of the trap is maintained at 212°F by steam to prevent
plugging (by prevention of the formation of the higher hydrogen'fluoride
complexes)vbecause of the'bigh partial pressure_of HF. Farther into the
NaF bed, the HF partial pressure is lower and the higher complexes are
T not formed even at the lower‘temperature.» The exit of the trap is water -

7 cooled to about 100°F, which is below the operating temperature of the
UFg absorbers, and the trap should therefore remove any HF that could
otherwise collect in the absorbers. The reaction is exothermic and
liberates 16.4 kecal per mole of HF absorbed _ |

“, With a fluorine flow of 50 liters/min, a processing time of 20 hr,
" and an HF content of 5%, the trap has sufficient capacity for the fluori-
‘_nation of five batches'if only 50% of the NaF is complexed to NaF-HF. o
Since the average HF content is less than 5%, one loading should have suf- &3}-
ficient capacity for all the fluorinations planned at the MSRE., If .

necessary, the NaFgcan be discarded and recharged.

'3.4.5 HF Heater

The HF heater is installed in the gas line from the HF cylinder

~after ‘the flow control valve, The purpose of this heater is to dissociate
the HF gas to the monomolecular form for accurate flOW'metering. This
‘requires the addition of approximately 1.2 Btu/liter of gas or approxi-
 mately 20 Btu/min at the maximum HF flow rate anticipated (1T liters/min).
Another 1 Btu/min of sensible heat is required to heat the gas from 120°F,
the temperature of the gas at 25 psig 1§a§1ng the'cylinder, to 180°F, the
teﬁperature required to reach the monomolecular form."This 21 Btu/min is
equivalent to 370 w. Two tubular heaters are used to provide a total of
1120 w. | | | | ‘ S

‘The salt sampler in the fuel-processing system is mounted on the
_roof plugs over the fuel-processing cell and is connected directly to
the top of the fuel storage_tank by & vertical 1- l/2—in. pipe. The sam-
pler is ‘the original fuel-pump sempler-enricher mockup shown in Fig. 3.13.
It is the'same as the fuelépumplsampler, with the following exceptions-
7 R It 1is designed for a maximum of 1k psig instead of 50 psig.
Area 1C 1is protected from overpressure by a pressure relief valve that
-vents to Area 2B which is vented to the cell through the space around the
1-1/2—in, sampling line. |

. '2.  No maintenance valve is required since the system can be shut
down and purged if maintenance on the sampler is required.

3. Area 2B will contain the - vacuum pumps in addition to the opera-
tional valve, - ’

L. A bellows is installed between the operational valve and the
' sample line instead of between the valves and Area 1C, '

The sampler will not be used during processing. The fuel storage
tank will be purged with helium before the operational valve is opened
for sampling.. The main purpose of the sampler is to verify that the salt
is satisfactory for return to the drain tank after processing. After
 Hz-HF treatment the sample will be analyzed to determine that HF has been
reduced to satisfactory levels. After fluorination the - sample will verify
_ .vthe complete removal of uranium. Also, sampling of flush. salt before pro-

o cessing will indicate the amount of fuel salt pickup. |

4.3.1 Activity Release from the Contaiment Stack

| h 3. l 1 Activity Released When Not Processing. A fully irradiated

' fuel batch will be held in the fuel drein tank, with the offgas passed to
a charcoal bed, until the_xenonlemission cannot cause a radiation level

in excess of 2. 5 mr /hr at the point of maximum ground concentration. From
Fig, h 2 it cen be seen that an approximately four-dey decay period is\
required before transfer to the fuel storage tank which is not vented
through a charcosl bed, Since there is about 50 £t> of gas space in the
processing equipment an- irradiated fuel batch will not be transferred to |
the fuel storage tank for 10 days at which time the decay rate will equal
the production rate and xenon accumulated in the gas space could not re-
sult in excessive release when purging is started. _

© b.3.1.2 Activity Released During Hp-HF Treatment. Although there
has been no work done on fission-productrbehavior under the highly re-
ducing conditions of the Ho-HF treatment very little if any fission-
product volatilization is expected All the fission products that could

g form volatile fluorides are more noble than the structural metals,

- chromium, iron, end nickel. Nickel, which is the most noble of the
structural metals will be limited to less than 1 ppm as NiFp with a

10:1 Ho-to-HF ratio, Therefore, although no equilibrium quotients are

"javailable for the fission-product fluorides, it is unlikely that any

 

f"niobium, Tuthenium, antimony, tellurium, ‘or iodine will exist in the salt
has the fluoride. H0wever, it is possible that HI could form and become

‘Ru, Nb, Mo) fission products during reactor operation. Table h 2 shows

'feexposures from Te, Nb, and Ru to be below the MEC. Removal of 99% of the
iNb and Ru in the NaF trap is expected while no decontamination of Te is

~ allowed for. The charcoal traps will be tested by iodine 1injection and

 

sampling to demonstrate a removal of at least 99. 998%. This removal effici-
- ency limits, the 1311 release to less than 300 millicuries W1th 30 days decay.

4.3.1.h Activity Released by Fquipment Failure, The meximum credi-

ble accident is believed to be a leak during fluorination in the gas
'space of the fuel. storage tank or in the piping between the FST and the

charcoal traps. This could be . caused by unusually high localized cor-

i rosion. Such a leak_would:be detected first by the_duct_9ho radiation
monitor. Figure 4.3 shows the time available to turn. off*the fluorine
- ;flow and stop the processing after the alarm ‘has sounded - At the:maximum
. ‘possible lesk rate (at the volatilization rate of 4.75 curies of I per -
'tj}minute) the monitor would reach alarm in 2 minutes. At the nearest
o ;point outside the controlled area (3200 m), the accumulated dose would be
._’l rad 1f 30 curies of 131I were released This ‘would require 6.3 min or

k.3 minutes after the alarm. This should be ample time to react to the

";yf?alaxm and turn off the fluorine Flov. Any leak smeller than this would
- result in a longer time to reach the alarm point but the allowable re- -

action time is much greater. T ‘
Table h 2 indicates that the dosages from the other volatile fission

’ products are very small compared with iodine. -

Jh.3.2 Activity Release t0o the Operating Area

" The highrbay area above -the fuel-processing cell will be used for
operation of the fuel-processing system. The possible release of gaseous |
activity into this area during fuel processing through the ‘roof plugs,
from the absorber cubicle, from the salt sampler, and from lines pene-
trating the cell walls was considered, - )
© h.3.2.1 Activity Released Through the Roof_ Plug_. Leakage of ac-
tivity from the fuel-processing cell to the operating area is not con-
sidered credible for the following reasons; - |

1. The cell is tightly sealed. All penetrations, piping, and
wiring are grouted and sealed with mastic or pass through sealed boxes,

2. A negative pressure will be maintained during processing. -

3. Processing cen be Quickly stopped. This would be done ‘auto-
maticelly in case of & power failure which would close the shutoff valve
on. the ges supply. (Fg, HF, and Ho). The power failure would also stop
the flow of cooling air to the cubicle. This air exhausts to the cell
and is the only positive gas flow to the cell ‘A loss of ventilation
not caused by a general power failure is highly improbable since there is-
& spare stack fan and the fans can be run with diesel power.'

o ‘4.3.2.2  Aetivity Released,from the Absorber Cubicle. The absorber\

~ cubicle is a sealed box of 3/16-in.~thick steel located"nearjthe instru-
- ment panel bosrd in the‘high?bay'area; ‘Tt is located in the high-bay

area to facilitate handling of the portable absorbers following fluori-

| nation By means of the cubicle blower, the cubicle will be maintained -

at a negative pressure with resPect to the cell which will be negative

“to the high#bay area. Failure of power to the blower will close the

-,f solenoid valve in the air supply to the cubicle to avoid pressurization.

 

 

 

~ The maximum cubicle pressure with 1oo—ft3/m1n air flow will be /|
checked to demonstrate that & pressure greater then 1 psig cannot be ob-
tained with the blower off., 'If’ necessary, the maximim air flow'will be
reduced below 100 ft3/min to prevent exceeding 1 psig. Prior to fluori-
nation the vent valve will be closed the cubicle pressure will be reised
to 1 psig, and the: leak rate will be ‘determined. Leakage must be less
than 75 cc/min. This rate of iodine leskage would allow 10 min of working
58
‘time in the hithbay area without masks. This is sufficient time to shut
down and to evacuate the highsbay area, since the reactor will not be
operating;during fuel processing. _ : .

The presence of gaseous activity in the absorber cubicle will be de-
tected.by'a monitor that will be continuously sampling the cubicle air
during processing. If a leak occurs, processing can be suspended. The
cubicle will then be purged with &ir to the cell, the cubicle top will |
| be removed, and all. Jjoints will be checked for tightness. Smears from

~ each joint should indicate the location of the leak.

4.3.h, 3 Activity Released from the Cell Penetrations. All cell
~ penetrations connected directly to process equipment are provided with
check valves, most of which are located in a sealed instrument cubicle ,
along with the’ instrument transmitters._ A backup of activity to the

check valves would be detected by a radiation monitor in the-cubicle and
" possibly by the area monitors in the high-bey area. | |

In addition to the lines routed through the instnmnant cubicle,

there are three other penetrations from the cell +to ‘the high—bay area:
the salt sampler, which is discussed in the next section, “the salt-
charging line, and the caustic-charging line. The salt-charging line
will be'sealed with at least one freeze valve and capped when not charging
salt. The‘caustic-charging line to the'caustic scrubber is provided with
two memual velves. Caustic will not be charged during processing,.which ,
would be the -only time that pressure or activity could be found in the
charging line, | l L | I

. The waste-salt line to the spare cell will be sealed by a freeze
\ valve in the processing cell. The method of waste salt disposal has not
‘yet been determined. = , | , | /

sampler-enricher. Both samplers have similar instrumentation and will be '
~used. with similar operating procedures ' The fuel-storage tank will not ‘

be sampled during processing. aBefore sampling,-the sampling line and fuel
| storage tank will‘be purged of gaseous activity. The sample'capsule con-
faining the solid sample will be moved from the'primary,containment area,

over the fuel-processing cell will be less than 10 mr/hr through the .
Y} ft-thick high-density-concrete roof plugs under the most severe con-
ditions with a fully irradiated four-day—decayed fuel salt batch in the
fuel storage tank, Since processing would not be started until the batch
had decayed for at least a few weeks, this level above “the cell should
cause no concern. Operations will be. planned to limit exposure of indi-
‘viduals to less than 100 mr/week and signs will be posted indicating
radiation levels at various points in the hithbay area.
The salt sampler will be shielded with L in. of lead which should
~reduce the radiation level from a8 fuel salt sample to less than 10 mr/hr
It will be necessary to shield the absorber cubicle during processing
' of 8 fully irradiated fuel batch Since "freeze-valve" salt samples ‘have
shown that only'~ 1% of the calculated %Mo is in the circulating salt |
'stream, absorbed activity is expected to be very low" ‘and’ shielding of the
 absorbers should not be required. However 31T in the gas space. in the
absorbers will require that ‘the absorber cubicle be shielded with 1/2-in.

4.4.2.1 From Irradiated Salt.. There are two dip tubes in the fuel

storage tank into which-salt could accidentally back up: the salt-transfer

line and the gas-sparging line. The salt—transfer line is connected to
the spare cell by the waste salt line and to the high-bay area by the
salt-charging line. Both lines have freeze valves that are normally
frozen, In addition, the end of each line will be capped when not in
use, | ) : ? | ) S -
The gas-sparging line passes through the area west of'the cell to )
the instrument cubicle and then to the gas supply station. An air valvel-
}\located in the instrument cubicle actuates a valve in the cell which opens
if the tank pressure exceeds the purge pressure and vents the line to the
top of the tank to prevent salt backup. If a plug should occur, it could
be thawed with installed electric heaters without entering the cell,

hbh,2.2 From Ceustic Solution. Most of the'iodine,in ‘the salt.may‘
be volatilized as HI during Ha-HF treatment There will probably be some

'deposition on metal surfaces before the HI reaches the caustic scrubber
'but most of the iodine reaching the scrubber will be collected there.

* The meximim iodine concentration in the scrubber solution will be 2 c/gal
from flush selt processing and 40 c/gal from fuel salt processing.r The

caustic solution can either be diluted to 5 ¢/gal or allowed to decay for
an additional ol days before transferring to the intermediate level waste

 system colleotion tenk. The piping and pump containing ‘the radioactive

scrubber solution is shielded but masks, ‘protective clothing, and Health
Physics surveillance are required for the sampling operation,.
The solution could possibly get into unshielded lines in the

,ffollow1ng ways; . - S T

L. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during processing and plugging

of the vent line or flame arrester could force some solution up the jet

fsteam'line, but this line isfshielded to approximately 25 £t from the

jet and backup this far into a closed line is unlikely, The pressure
alarms on both the fuel storage tank and the caustic scrubber would pro~

' vide sufficient warning to stop processing before a dangerous pressure

" was reached

2. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during Jetting plus plugging
of the vent line or flame arrester and plugging of the jet ‘discharge
line to the waste tank could cause steam to back up through the caustic

7solution. Considerable time would be required to build up sufficient
: pressure (7 psig) to force solution up the sparge line to the absorber
”nqcubicle. Pressure. alarms and radiation monitors would provide warning

~ far in advance of any hazard.

*3._7 A vacuum in the Jet line could pull solution into the steam

lpe. If the jet discharge 1line should plug and jetting should stop,

condensing steam could create such a vacuum. A check valve tees into

';the steam line and will prevent & -vecuum from forming in this line.

b, Cooling of the fuel storage tank without gas purges to the

7 tank could cause & vacuum in the tank and offgas piping to the scrubber.
A power failure could cause'cooling of the tank but would not stop the
 

62

 helium purges. In the event of a prolonged power failure and_co¢ling_of
' the fuel storage tank, ihe caustic scrubber would be jetted to the waste

- tank,

.teken as indicated in Section 4.3.2.4 to keep gaseoué'actifity:dﬁt'of the

gas-space.ﬁy a factbr of 10°. Complete £illing of the'sampler access
