ABSTRACT

The control elements for the Molten Salt Reactor are
(Gd»03-A1,03 bushings canned in Inconel. The report includes
material selection and development of’ fabrication methods.
The can was made from fully inspected Inconel closed by four
TIG welds. The GAd,03-A1503 bushings were made by conventional
pressing and sintering methods after a special prereaction
step was used. The bushings were given thermal shock tests,
weighed, dimensionally inspected, and given a final visual
inspection for chips or cracks. As-built drawings, specifi-
cations, and manufacturing procedures are included. By
methods described in this report, 160 MSRE control rod
elements were manufactured.

 

INTRODUCTION

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a high-temperature
(675°C) low-pressure (50 pSi) system designed to provide a thermal out-
put of about 10 Mw. A fuel mixture of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,;-UF, is circulated

through a cylindrical 5-ft-diam reactor vessel (contaim‘.ng a graphite

_ core) to a heat-éxchanger, where heat is transferred to an unfueled

fluoride salt and then to the atmosphere. The control elements are

‘Gd2Q3—30% A1,03 bushings cled with Inconel as shown in Fig. 1. - They are

about 1 1/2 in. long with an inner dismeter slightly larger than 3/4 in.
and a wall thickness of about 3/8 in. The MSRE has three control rods,

each of which has 36 control elements strung on a flexible stainless steel

hose to form a 56-in.-1ong control rod. The flexibility of the control

rod prevents binding due to misaligmment or thermal expansion. Although

TEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFICATION AND FAERICATION METHODS ;
: "
To prove the feasibility of the control rod design, four prototype *
elements were manufactured on a research contract with Dresser Products.
The prototype elements differed from the final element in that the pro-
“totype pellets were produced by hot pressing and were canned in stainless
steel rather than Inconel. The prototype elements were subjected to
x-ray, penetrant, and dimensional inspection and to testihg that included
exposure in a rig’ designed to determine under simulated reactor
conditions soundness, dimensipnal stability, and general suitability for
reactor use. o : o ' , (“.'

-steels will under certain conditions.

 

In the control-rod testing rig, two canned elements were exposed to
repeated thermal and mechanical shocks. They were examined radiograph-
ically and dimensionally after 24, 350, and 600 hr of testing that
included approximately 11,000 cycles and 1700 scrams. Holes were made
in one can to expose the Gd203-Alz03 to air for the final 250 hr of
testing. ' _

Dimensions of the metal cans were not altered by the testing. Axial
cracks in the pellets were observed radiographically after the first
cycle, and severe cracks in both the axial and transverse directions were
observed at later stages. However, no crumbling or rétcheting was evident,
and no condition was observed that/might affect the nuclear or mechanical
performance of the control rod elements. | |

Inconel was chosen as a canning material for the poison bushings
because of its high-temperature strength, good weldability, and
availability. Inconel was chosen over stainless steel for the following
reasons:

1. Inconel will not catastrophically oxidize, while many stainless
4

2. Inconel will not stress-corrosion crack.

3. Inconel is more»resistant to nitric acid attack than is sensi-
tized stainless steel. Nitric acid can form in radiation fields by
reaction of the nitrogen and water vapor in the air.?

4., If salt should leak into the control element, Inconel would
have better corrosion resistance than stainless steel.

Although there was only a slight possibility that these conditions

mlght occur, the small cost factor in favor of stainless steel did not

- warrant the risk 1nvolved

Boron and boron- containing materials were ruled out as p01son mate-

rials, since under certain conditions they react with stainless steel

and nickel-base alloys. In addition helium is one of the products when
boron is irradiated, which would-require a venting system on the element
or design for high internal pressure. A rare earth oxide was chosen as
the'poison_matefial on the basis of work done by ORNL® and Knolls Atomic
.Power Laboratory7 and irradiation testing by General Electric on '
' dysprosium oxide mixtures.® |

Since the cross section of dyéprosiuﬁ oxide was not sufficiently N
high, the choice of materials was between Gd203 and Euz03. Gadolinium
was chosen.becauserit'was from one-third to one-fourth less expensive
than Euy03. Because pure gadolinium oxide reacts with water in the air,
it was diluted with aluminum oxide. A series of tests was run in boiling
water and water-saturated air at 700°C to determine the alumlnum oxide
content needed. Although 20% Al203 performed satisfactorily, 30% Al20;3
was éhosen as added protection. '

To prevent the "self welding" of the elements during operation, a
preoxidation was specified. It was necessary to perform this operation
on the finished element to avoid contamination of the closure welds.

From experience gained in the manufacture of the prototype control

rods, specifications (Appendix A) and drawings (Appendix B) were prepared.

Quotations were obtained from several control rod manufacturers and were
carefully evaluated. The prime contract for manufacturing the control

elements was awarded to Westinghouse Atomic Power Division.

are given in Appendix A. In the case of the tubing, the ORNL Tubing
Specification (JS-81-183, Part II) was rewritten by the vendor, who
added additionalrmanufacturing requirements and purchased.the material
from a tubing vendor. The tuﬁing vendor performed the inspection and
certified the material to ORNL specifications. In the case of the bar,
Westinghouse purchased the material to ASTM specification, performed the
necessary inspection, and certified to the ORNL specification (Js-81-183,
Part IIT). In both cases, the material was inspected by ultrasonic and
penetrapt methods as raw stock and examined by penetrant methods after
final machining. All of the raw material had certified chemical ahalyses
and mechanical properties, and samples of each heat of material were
retained. A floﬁsheet for cladding components is given in Appendix C,
Procedure 1.

The Gd,03-A1503 bushings for the prototype control element were hot
pressed, but Westinghouse proposed to manufacture the production bushings
by conventional pressing and sintering. In work performed previously at
ORNL, a chemical reaction occurred at-1650°C,-and the pellets became
severely distorted; at 1750°C they melted.® Westinghouse could manufac-
ture bushings that would meet the specifications except that they were
so hygroscopic that they dissolved in boiling water. Experiments at ORNL
showed that bushings could be made that were not hygroscopic by prereacting
the powder at 1650°C and then pressing and sintering.? To manufacture a
bushing that would not react with water, Westinghouse used a prereacting
step on all.production bushings. |

The manufacturing procedure used for the bushing is outlined in
Appendix C, Procedure 2. The-prdéeés started with mixing the Al,05; and
Gd,03 powder, pressing, and prereacting at 1700°C: The reaction products
were crushed, ball-milled, sized, pressed into bushings, presintered,
and then sintered at 1450°C. Bushings made by this method were boiled
in water for 48 hr-without;any,appreciable weight loss. Each bushing\
was then given a thermal shock test by heating to 1400°C and gquenching

in water. After surface grinding, the bushings were visually inspected
fof chips or cracks. Bushings were rejected if they had chips longer
than;1/8 in. or deeper than_1/32 in. Each bushing was weighed and dimen-
siOnally inspected with go-no-go gages. The content of Gdz03; was also
determined spectrographically for each batch.

Three bushings were selected for each control element so their
combination would yield the proper stack height and total weight of
Gd203. The Gda03 content was computed from the weight of the bushlng
and the results of the spectrographic ana1y31s for Gds03.

Experience showed that even after a 150°C bake, the bushlngs could
actually release enough gas to bulge the Inconel can during the pre-
oxidation of it.  To prevent bulging, it was necessary to outgas the
bushings at 815°C before loading.

CONTROL ELEMENT ASSEMBLY

Before production assembly, welding procedures were written and
qualified for each of the four Wela joints required in a control element.
It was necessary that the procedures consistently produce & defect-
free weld with a minimum of 0.20 in. penetration. The weld must not
contain buildup or distort the can sufficiently that the element would

‘not pass final dimensional inspection. Appendix C, Procedure 3, gives

the welding procedure used, and Fig. 2 shows sections through typical
top and bottom welds. If the outer top weld was made last, the weld
would blow out due to buildup of gas pressure inside the element. If
the inner bottom joint was welded 1ast,Aﬁo difficulty was encountered.
This was probably because less gas was heated during welding as a result
of the configuration of the weld joint (see Fig. 2).

‘The assembly is described ih Appendix C, Procedure 4. After both
top welds were made, the bushings were loaded into the subassembly in

a helium-filled dry box, and the bottom closure was pressed into place.

. The final two bottom welds were then made. The elementVWas then dimen-

sionally 1nspected with go and no-go gages, and, if necessary, excess

weld bulldup was removed. An 1dent1ficat10n mumber was electro-etched

into each of the elements, and each part used in the manufacture of
that element was recorded. The element was given a careful visual inspec-
tion, helium leak checked, and inspected at the welds with post-
emulsified fluorescent penetrant. _Té'brevent self-welding of the seg-
ments or compbnents during service, the elements were oxidized by heating
to 927°C. They were then given a final visual and dimensional inspection,
packaged, and shipped.

During receivihg inspection at ORNL, radiographic examination
(see Fig. 3) revealed that 51 of the elements contained cracked bushings.
These cracks had developed during welding or during preoxidation. Since
tests on the prototype element showed the bushings would crack during
the first few reactor cycles in any event, the elements were accepted.

The control elements that will be used in the MSRE were run in the
control rod test facility for a total of 2000 cycles. No dimensional
changes were noted. The elements were then put into position in the

MSRE, where they are presently operating.

SUMMARY

By the methods described in this report, 160 MSRE control rod
elements were successfully manufactured. Figure 4 shows a group of the

finished elements.

IEAK TEST (Continued)

b. The inspection shall be performed in a force-ventilated
location to facilitate the removal of any helium background.

¢. The connecting lines between the test chamber and the
instrument manifold shall be as short as is practical and
should have a minimum inside diameter of 1/2 in. A1l
connections shall be leak-tight.

d. Care shall be exercised to avoid plugging leaks with
any sealant prior to attempted detection with helium.

e. All assembled elements shall be either helium-leak
tested within 48 hr after the final closure weld is completed
or stored in a helium atmosphere of pressure equal to or

time as they can be helium-leak tested. If an element is to
be retested or if the testing procedure is interrupted, as
in Section VIIIA5-a, -f, and -g of this specification, the
element shall be stored in a helium atmosphere as described
until such time as testing can be completed. No assembled
element shall be allowed to remain in a non-helium atmo-
‘sphere for more than a total of 48 hr between the time

of its assembly and the completion of helium-leak testing.

5. Testing Procedure:

a. The performance of the leak-detector equipment shall
be verified after each inspection. If at any time this
equipment fails to function properly as described in the
"Manufacturer's operating manual, and/or if the sensitivity
as determined in Section VIIIA5c of this specification
decreases below the minimum level prescribed in Section
VIIIA4a, the equipment shall be readjusted to function as
specified and recalibrated, and all elements which have
- been inspected during the 1nter1m since the last satis-
- factory performance verlflcatlon of the equipment shall
be 1nspected again.

end of the test chamber shall be connected to the manifold,
and the time which is required to produce a signal two
times as large as the background noise shall be measured.
This measurement shall be accomplished while examining a
100% sample from the test chamber and with all valves
between the standard leak source and the helium-sensing
device completely open. This portion of the calibration
shall be continued until the signal from the standard leak
reaches a stable amplitude. The signal amplitude and
manifold pressure shall be measured at this point.

d. The inspection shall be made taking a sample from the
test chamber. All valves between the element and the
helium-sensing device shall be completely open and the

time of inspection shall be no less than one minute and at
least twice as long as the time, as determined in Section
VIIIASc of this specification for that particular method,
required for the standard leak to pro&uce a signal two tlmes
as large as the background noise.

e. The manifold pressure at which the inspection is made
‘shall be the same as the pressure at which the instrument
is calibrated, as measured in Section VIIIAS5c of this
specification. '

f. Excessive pump-down time shall be indicative of an
external leak. The leak shall be located and corrected
before further testing is accomplished.

4. The transducer shall be no larger than 3/4 in. in diameter.

5. The equlpment shall be calibrated with the use of the
appropriate reference standard. Clear indications shall be -
demonstrated from the flat bottom of each radial hole, from
the side of the hole parallel to the axis, and from the side | =
of the reference notch. The response from the hole parallel '
to the axis shall be discernible when the hole is rotated
approximately 90 deg from the crystal position. " If adequate
indications from all notches and holes can be demonstrated with
a single test setup, this shall be considered sufficient for
the required inspection. However, it may be necessary to make
separate inspection setups and calibrations to achieve the

4

.specified sensitivity for a particular reference standard. The -

amplitude of the back surface reflection at a reduced-sensitivity .

-getting shall be noted for determination of differences in

uwltrasonic attenuation properties in the test material as com-
pared to the reference standard. The equipment shall be ,
calibrated at the same speed and rate of translation that will
be used for the inspection.

6. The maximum indication from any detected discontinuity

shall be related to the reference defect which is most nearly

comparable in regard to cross-sectional position and with the

reference and detected discontinuities being, as near as practi- . x
cal, the same distance from the transducer. Bars containing

discontinuities which produce indications equal to or greater

than the proper reference defect, after consideration of | -
differences in ultrasonic attenuation properties between the

standard and the test material, shall be rejected.

bushing from a temperature of 1475 * 25°F to room temperature
in 10 sec. The method of thermal cycling shall be as follows:

1. Heat Gdz03 - Al,03 bushings in air in a furnace operating

at 1475 t+ 25°F for at least the time necessary for the
bushings to approach the same color as the interior of the
furnace as judged by eye. As an alternative, bushings may
be placed in a cold or a warm furnace and both furnace and
bushings raised in temperature to a furnace temperature of
1475 + 25°F before bushings are removed (next step).

2. Remove bushings from furnace one at a time and quench
immediately in a container of cold tap water. Allow bushings
to remain in water for at least 1/2 min.

3. Dry bushings by air drying and/or heating for a minimum of
one hour at 250°F or higher in air.

Inspect bushings for cracks.
5. Any bushings having cracks shall be rejected.
