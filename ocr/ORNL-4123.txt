ABSTRACT

The control elements for the Molten Salt Reactor are
Gd,03-A1503 bushings canned in Inconel. The report includes
material selection and development of fabrication methods.
The can was made from fully inspected Inconel closed by four
TIG welds. The Gd203-A1,03 bushings were made by conventional
pressing and sintering methods after a special prereaction
step was used. The bushings were given thermal shock tests,
weighed, dimensionally inspected, and given a final visual
inspection for chips or cracks. As-built drawings, specifi-
cations, and manufacturing procedures are included. By
methods described in this report, 160 MSRE control rod
elements were manufactured.

INTRODUCTTION

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a high-temperature
(675°C) low-pressure (50 psi) system designed to provide a thermal out-
put of about 10 Mw. A fuel mixture of LiF-BeF.-ZrF,-Ur,; is circulated
through a cylindrical 5-ft-diam reactor vessel {containing a graphite
core) to a heat exchanger, where heat is transferred to an unfueled
fluoride salt and then to the atmosphere. The control elements are
Gd,03—30% Al1,03 bushings clad with Inconel as shown in Fig. 1. They are
about 1 1/2 in. long with an inner diameter slightly larger than 3/4 in.
and a wall thickness of about 3/8 in. The MSRE has three control rods,
each of which has 36 control elements strung on a flexible stainless steel
hose to form a 56-in.-long control rod. The flexibility of the control

rod prevents binding due to misaligmment or thermal expansion. Although

power without cooling, about 815°C. )

DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFICATION AND FABRICATICN METHODS .

To prove the feasibility of the control rcd design, four prototype
elements were manufactured on a research contract with Dresser Products.
The prototype elements differed from the final element in that the pro-
totype pellets were produced by hot pressing and were canned in stainless
steel rather than Inconel. The prototype elements were subjected to
x-ray, penetrant, and dimensional inspection and to testing that included
exposure in a rig3 designed to determine under simulated reactor
conditicns soundness, dimensional stability, and general suitability for

reactor use.

3R. B. Briggs et al., MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept., Jan. 31, 1964,
ORNL-3626, pp. 29-31.

In the control-rod testing rig, two canned elements were exposed To
repeated thermal and mechanical shocks. They were examined radiograph-
jcally and dimensionally after 24, 350, and 600 hr of testing that
included approximately 11,000 cycles and 1700 scrams. Holes were made
in one can to expose the Gdz03-Al03 to air for the final 250 hr of
testing.

Dimensions of the metal cans were not altered by the testing. Axial
cracks in the pellets were observed radiographically after the first
cycle, and severe cracks in both the axial and transverse directions were
observed at later stages. However, no crumbling or ratcheting was evident,
and no condition was observed that might affect the nuclear or mechanical
performance of the control rod elements.

Inconel was chosen as a canning material for the poison bushings
because of its high-temperature strength, good weldabllity, and
availability. Inconel was chosen over stainless steel for the following
reasons:

1. TInconel will not catastrophically oxidize, while many stainless
steels will under certain conditions.*

2. TInconel will not stress-corrosion crack.

3. TInconel is more resistant to nitric acid attack than is sensi-
tized stainless steel. Nitric acid can form in radiation fields by
reaction of the nitrogen and water vapor in the air.?

4. If salt should leak into the control element, Inconel would
have better corrosion resistance than stainless steel.

Although there was only a slight possibility that these conditions
might occur, the small cost factor in favor of stainless steel did not
warrant the risk involved.

Boron and boron-containing materials were ruled out as poison mate-

rials, since under certain conditions they react with stainless steel

and nickel-base alloys. In addition helium is one of the products when
boron is irradiated, which would require a venting system on the element
or design for high internal pressure. A rare earth oxide was chosen as
the poison material on the basis of work done by ORNL® and Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory7 and irradiation testing by General Electric on
dysprosium oxide mixtures.®

Since the cross section of dysprosium oxide was not sufficiently
high, the cholce of materials was betwsen Gd»03 and Eus03. Gadolinium
was chosen because 1t was from one-third to one-fourth less expensive
than Eup03. Because pure gadolinium oxide reacts with water in the air,
it was diluted with aluminum oxide. A series of tests was run in boiling
water and water-saturated air at 700°C to determine the aluminum oxide
content needed. Although 20% Alp03 performed satisfactorily, 30% Al1504
was chosen as added protection.

To prevent the "self welding" of the elements during operation, a
preoxidation was specified. It was necessary to perform this operation
on the finished element to avoid contamination of the closure welds.

From experience gained in the manufacture of the prototype control
rods, specifications (Appendix A) and drawings (Appendix B) were prepared.
Quotations were obtained from several control rod manufacturers and were
carefully evaluated. The prime contract for manufacturing the control

elements was awarded to Westinghouse Atomic Power Division.

are given in Appendix A. 1In the case of the tubing, the ORNL Tubing
Specification (JS-81-183, Part II) was rewritten by the vendor, who
added additional manufacturing requirements and purchased the material
from a tubing vendor. The tubing vendor performed the inspection and
certified the material to ORNL specifications. In the case of the bar,
Westinghouse purchased the material to ASTM specification, performed the
necessary inspection, and certified to the ORNL specification (J5-81-183,
Part III). In both cases, the material was inspected by ultrascnic and
penetrant methods as raw stock and examined by penetrant methods after
final machining. All of the raw material had certified chemical analyses
and mechanical properties, and samples of each heat of material were
retained. A flowsheet for cladding components is given in Appendix C,
Procedure 1.

The Gdp03-A1,03 bushings for the prototype control element were hot
pressed, but Westinghouse proposed to manufacture the production bushings
by conventional pressing and sintering. In work performed previously at
ORNL, a chemical reaction occurred at 1650°C, and the pellets became
severely distorted; at 1750°C they melted.® Westinghouse could manufac-
ture bushings that would meet the specifications except that they were
so hygroscopic that they dissolved in boiling water. Experiments at ORNL
showaed that bushings could be made that were not hygroscopic by prereacting
the powder at 1650°C and then pressing and sintering.9 To manufacture a
bushing that would not react with water, Westinghouse used a prereacting
step on all production bushings.

The manufacturing procedure used for the bushing is outlined in
Appendix C, Procedure 2. The process started with mixing the Al;03 and
Gd,05 powder, pressing, and prereacting at 1700°C. The reaction products
were crushed, ball-milled, sized, pressed into bushings, presintered,
and then sintered at 1450°C. Bushings made by this method were boiled
in water for 48 hr without any appreciable weight loss. Fach bushing

was then given a thermal shock test by heating to 1400°C and quenching

in water. After surface grinding, the bushings were visually inspected
for chips or cracks. Bushings were rejected if they had chips longer
than 1/8 in. or deeper than 1/32 in. Each bushing was weighed and dimen-
sionally inspected with go-no-go gages. The content of Gd,053 was also
determined spectrographically for each batch.

Three bushings were selected for each control element so their
combination would yield the proper stack height and total weight of
Gdz03. The Gdp03 content was computed from the weight of the bushing
and the results of the spectrographic analysis for Gdo03.

Experience showed that even after a 150°C bake, the bushings could
actually release enough gas to bulge the Inconel can during the pre-
oxidation of it. To prevent bulging, it was necessary to outgas the

bushings at 815°C before loading.

CONTROL ELEMENT ASSEMBLY

Before production assembly, welding procedures were written and
qualified for each of the four weld joints required in a control element.
It was necessary that the procedures consistently produce a defect-
free weld with a minimum of 0.20 in. penetration. The weld must not
contain buildup or distort the can sufficiently that the element would
not pass final dimensional inspection. Appendix C, Procedure 3, gives
the welding procedure used, and Fig. 2 shows sections through typical
top and bottom welds. If the outer fop weld was made last, the weld
would blow out due to buildup of gas pressure inside the element. IT
The inner bottom joint was welded last, no difficulty was encountered.
This was probably because less gas was heated during welding as a result
of the configuration of the weld joint (see Fig. 2).

The assembly is described in Appendix C, Procedure 4. After both
top welds were made, the bushings were loaded into the subassembly in
a helium-filled dry box, and the bottom closure was pressed into place.
The final two bottom welds were then made. The element was then dimen-
sionally inspected with go and no-go gages, and, if necessary, excess

weld buildup was removed. An identification number was electro-etched

into each of the elements, and each part used in the manufacture of
that element was recorded. The element was given a careful visual inspec-
tion, helium leak checked, and inspected at the welds with post-
emulsified fluorescent penetrant. To prevent self-welding of the seg-
ments or components during service, the elements were oxidized by heating
to 927°C. They were then given a final visual and dimensional inspection,
packaged, and shipped.

During receiving inspection at ORNL, radiographic examination
(see Fig. 3) revealed that 51 of the elements contained cracked bushings.
These cracks had developed during welding or during preoxidation. Since
tests on the prototype element showed the bushings would crack during
the first few reactor cycles in any event, the elements were accepted.

The control elements that will be used in the MSRE were run in the
control rod test facility for a total of 2000 cycles. No dimensional
changes were noted. The elements were then put into position in the

MSRE, where they are presently operating.

SUMMARY

By the methods described in this report, 160 MSRE control rod
elements were successfully manufactured. Figure 4 shows a group of the

finished elements.

IEAK TEST (Continued)

b. The inspection shall be performed in a force-ventilated
location to facilitate the removal of any helium background.

c. The connecting lines between the test chamber and the
instrument manifold shall be as short as is practical and
should have a minimum inside diameter of 1/2 in. All
connections shall be leak-tight.

d. Care shall be exercised to avoid plugging leaks with
any sealant prior to attempted detection with helium.

e. All assembled elements shall be either helium-leak
tested within 48 hr after the final closure weld is completed
or stored in a helium atmosphere of pressure equal to or
greater than the internal pressure of the element until such
time as they can be helium-leak tested. If an element is to
be retested or if the testing procedure is interrupted, as
in Section VITIIA5-a, -f, and -g of this specification, the
element shall be stored in a helium atmosphere as described
until such time as testing can be completed. No assembled
element shall be allowed to remain in a non-helium atmo-
sphere for more than a total of 48 hr between the time

of its assembly and the completion of helium-leak testing.

5. The performance of the leak-detector equipment shall
be verified after each inspection. If at any time this
equipment fails to function properly as described in the
Manufacturer's operating manual, and/or if the sensitivity
as determined in Section VIIIA5c of this specification
decreases below the minimum level prescribed in Section
VIIIA4a, the equipment shall be readjusted to function as
specified and recalibrated, and all elements which have
been inspected during the interim since the last satis-
factory performance verification of the equipment shall
be inspected again.

IEAK TEST (Continued)

b. The element shall be inspected as follows: The
assembled, helium-containing elements shall be inspected
after the final closure weld has been accomplished by
placing the element in the inspection chamber, evacuating
the chamber, and searching for helium leaks as prescribed
in the instrument Manufacturer's operating manual.

c. The instrument shall be calibrated as follows: The
standard leak source (7 x 10-? sta ce/sec) shall be
connected to one end of the test chamber. The opposite
end of the test chamber shall be connected to the manifold,
and the time which is required to produce a signal two
times as large as the background noise shall be measured.
This measurement shall be accomplished while examining a
100% sample from the test chamber and with all valves
between the standard leak source and the helium-sensing
device completely open. This portion of the calibration
shall be continued until the signal from the standard lezk
reaches a stable amplitude. The signal amplitude and
manifold pressure shall be measured at this point.

d. The inspecticn shall be made taking a sample from the
test chamber. All valves between the element and the
helium-sensing device shall be completely open and the

time of inspection shall be no less than one minute and at
least twice as long as the time, as determined in Section
VIIIASc of this specification for that particular method,
required for the standard leak to produce a signal two times
as large as the background noise.

e. The manifold pressure at which the inspection is made
shall be the same as the pressure at which the instrument
is calibrated, as measured in Section VIIIA5c of this
specification.

f. Bxcessive pump-down time shall be indicative of an
external leak. The leak shall be located and corrected
before further testing is accomplished.

g. During the inspection, any signal which produces an
indication two times as large as the background noise
level shall be indicative of a through path or leak in
the element being inspected and that element shall be
rejected. If more than one assembled element is being
inspected at the time a leak is detected, the elements
shall be inspected again such that the leaking element or
elements are identified and rejected.

h. All rejected, assembled elements shall be disassembled.
Any salvageable parts of the rejected elements may be
reused in the assembly of other elements. A salvageable
item is one that is reinspected and found to conform to
the specification.

PENETRANT INSPECTION OF ELEMENT

Bach element shall be 100% examined for discontinuities by means
of penetrant inspection in accordance with MET-NDT-4, Revision 2.
The process times shall be that listed in Table 2 of NDT-4 for
"All forms with machine finish 125 rms or better.” The penetrant
inspection shall be performed before the elements are oxidized and
before the elements are leak tested.

SURFACE OXIDIZING REQJIREMENTS

A.

The outer surface of the closures shall be oxidized with a
black, adherent high-temperature oxide film to prevent self-
welding of the elements. The entire outer surface of the
element may be oxidized.

The process and procedure utilized by the Seller to provide the
oxide coating on the required surfaces shall be subject to the
Company's approval.

For each oxidizing operation, the Seller shall include a control
sample for testing purposes. The sample shall be material of
identical size and composition to that specified for the closure.
The sample shall be processed with and shall receive the same
treatment as the production parts. The samples shall become

the property of the Company and shall be delivered with or

prior to final shipment.

XI. DESTRUCTIVE TEST OF WELDMENT

A. A sample of 1% of the elements will be selected by the Company's
inspectors. The sample may be selected immediately after
welding or after all nondestructive testing has been performed
at the Seller's option.

B. All the welds on the elements selected for test will be
sectioned, examined, and photographed in accordance with
Section VIF of this specification. The photographs and
sectioned samples shall become the property of the Company
and shall be delivered with or prior to final shipment.

C. The sections shall be free of cracks. The sections shall be
free of porosity or other inclusions greater than 0.005 in.
in their largest dimension.

D. The welds shall show a minimum of 0.020-in. penetration on
all sections.

E. If one or more elements of the 1% random sample are rejected,
then double the number of elements shall be selected for
testing. If one or more of the second group are determined
to be rejectable, then the entire lot will be considered
rejectable and the Seller will be responsible for initiation
of corrective action. After initiation of corrective action,
sampling shall again go into effect as described above.

SPECTAL REQUIREMENTS (Contirued)

L. The transducer shall be no larger than 3/4 in. in diameter.

5. The equipment shall be calibrated with the use of the
appropriate reference standard. Clear indications shall be
demonstrated from the flat bottom of each radial hole, from -
the side of the hole parallel to the axis, and from the side

of the reference notch. The response from the hole parallel

to the axis shall be discernible when the hole is rotated
approximately 90 deg from the crystal position. IT adequate
indications from all notches and holes can be demonstrated with

s single test setup, this shall be considered sufficient for

the required inspection. However, it may be necessary to make
separate inspection setups and calibrations to achieve the
specified sensitivity for a particular reference standard. The
amplitude of the back surface reflection at a reduced-sensitivity
setting shall be noted for determination of differences in
ultrasonic attenuation properties in the test material as com-
pared to the reference standard. The equipment shall be
calibrated at the same speed and rate of translation that will

be used for the inspection.

6. The maximum indication from any detected discontinuity

shall be related to the reference defect which is most nearly
comparable in regard to cross-sectional position and with the
reference and detected discontinuities being, as near as practi-
cal, the same distance from the transducer. Bars containing
discontinuities which produce indications equal to or greater
than the proper reference defect, after consideration of
differences in ultrasonic attenuation properties between the
standard and the test material, shall be rejected.

17. All defects shall be explored for depth. When the depth encroaches
on the minimum specified dimensions, the bar shall be rejected.
