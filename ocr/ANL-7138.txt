PART I. HOMOGENEOUS AND QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS
SECTION IV. REACTORS FUELED WITH LIQUID METALS

Chapter 1. Introduction

Concepts in this section include reactors fueled with liquid fission-
able materials, as well as those fueled with solutions or dispersions of
fissionable materials in nonfissionable liquid metals. A solution of uranium
in a metal, particularly bismuth, has received the most attention. Disper-
sions of uranium oxide in bismuth or sodium, as well as molten plutonium
fuels, however, have also been investigated. Bismuth is a suitable fuel
medium because it will dissolve uranium, and it has a low cross section
for thermal neutrons. The solubility is, however, so limited that enriched
uranium must be used. Liquid metals can be fuels in either thermal or
fast reactors. Concepts for liquid-metal-fueled reactors, commonly re-
ferred to as LMFR concepts, are reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2,

The concepts in this section are divided according to the method of
cooling the reactor, internal or external (see below). A third classification,
integral or "pot," is frequently used. The only distinguishing feature of this
concept is that the reactor and primary heat exchanger are both in the pri-
mary reactor vessel. Because this feature is not basic, the integral re-
actors will be discussed according to the method of cooling.

In the internally-cooled reactors, Chapter 2, the liquid metal remains
in the core; the coolant, another fluid, flows through the core and out to an
external heat exchanger. Thus the core itself acts as a heat exchanger. In
this design, the fuel inventory is reduced, but the introduction of a second
- fluid complicates core design.

In externally-cooled reactors Chapter 3, the fuel circulates to an
external heat exchanger for cooling.

Liquid-metal-fueled reactors may be either one-fluid or two-fluid,
analogous to the one- and two-region reactors in Sections II and III, Part I,
of this Catalog. In the one-fluid reactors, the fuel carrier contains fertile,
material if breeding is desired, and there is no fertile blanket. In the two-
fluid reactors, a blanket of either solid or liquid fertlle rna.terla.l permits

higher conversion ratios.

In 1941, Halban and Kowarski suggested the use of a bismuth-
uranium alloy as a nuclear fuel.” The alloy would be circulated outside
the reactor for cooling in a heat exchanger. ’
14

Several workers in the wartime atomic-energy program advanced
ideas for reactors fueled with liquid metals, but most of the ideas were not
developed in enough detail for complete concepts. The advantages of a fuel
that could be used at high temperatures and low pressures and could be
easily reprocessed were rec:ognized'ea,rly,4 but development was hindered
by such difficulties as those arising in pumping liquid metals and by empha-
sis put on other concepts, which showed greater promise.

By 1944, a pile in which the fuel is dissolved in liquid bismuth and
the solution is circulated through the pile in bery'l‘lium tubes was being
studied.® The greatest difficulty expected was the removal of fission
products. In one 1945 concept, chunks of beryllium metal would be hung
inside of the pile container as a moderator.® Alternatively, the container
could be a cylinder that is filled with uranium dissolved in sodium and that
contains beryllium tubes through which the coolant stream flows.” Unfor-
tunately, uranium is even less soluble in liquid sodium than it is in liquid
bismuth. The possibility of an all-liquid pile containing a molten alloy of
plutonium and uranium, with some diluent, was discussed, but development
was hindered by lack of knowledge of the proper alloy.®

In 1947, Young summarized current developments of c:oncepts,.9
Fuels suggested included a slurry of uranium oxide in liquid metal and a
solution of uranium in a molten alloy.

Two more-advanced concepts were described in 1947 by Menke and
by Young. 10,11

Liquid-metal fuels have most of the advantages and disadvantages
previously discussed for aqueous and molten-salt fuels,! and they have
some of their own. Liquid-metal systems can operate at high temperatures
and low pressures and have good heat-transfer properties. They are com-
paratively free from radiation damage and bubble formation. Because of
their lack of inherent moderating properties, they can be used in either
thermal or fast reactors. As with other liquid fuels, removal of fission
products and reenrichment are simpler than with solid fuels. Wolfgang, !¢
for example, has suggested the use of fission recoil to separate fission
products and thus simplify waste removal. If a solid adsorbent, such as
alumina, were suspended in the fuel, fission products would be adsorbed
on the suspended solid rather than on the fuel. A mixed suspension of fuel
and adsorbent might be continuously processed by simple techniques. Such
a system has not, however, been developed. Among the disadvantages of -
these fuels are: the low heat capacity of metals as compared with that of
water; the greater difficulties of pumping liquid metals, some of which can
be avoided by the use of electromagnetic pumps; corrosion and mass-
transfer problems; and the low solubility of uranium in bismuth, requiring

‘the use of highly enriched fuel. Slurries are often used to attain high fuel

concentrations, but such difficulties as settling out of the solid and erosion
are encountered. The high melting point of metals makes startup of.a reactor
difficult. The sodium-potassium alloy is, however, liquid at room temperature.

15

Although several studies have been made on applying the liquid-
metal-fuel concept to aircraft propulsion, it has also been considered for

central- station power plants.

The problems of using liquid metals as fuels, which include selec-
tion of construction materials, heat transfer, special equipment, and engl-
neering aspects of operation, are discussed in Refs. 1 and 2,

Extensive developmental work in the United States on molten metals
as reactor fuels began with investigations at Brookhaven National Labora-
tory (BNL), the Babcock & Wilcox Cormupany, and the Los Alamos Scientific
Laboratory (LASL). Other organizations in which work was carried out on
liquid-metal fuels include the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL) of
the General Electric Company, the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and
the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (NEPA Project). At ANL
and KAPL, for example, slurries of uranium dioxide in molten sodium-
potassium were investigated. The development of a reactor fueled with
liquid metals began at BNL in 1947. In 1954, Babcock & Wilcox and other
companies prepared a reference design for a power reactor. In 1956,
this company contracted with the USAEC to design, construct, and operate
a Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor Experiment (LMFRE) and to do research and
development beyond that carried out at BNL.!

Several groups have evaluated liquid-metal-fueled reactors.

The Project Dynamo evaluation of 195337 concluded that the LMFR
was extremely attractive if it could be proven technically feasible. The first
comprehensive effort to determine general layouts and costs of a full-scale
LMFR power plant was made at BNL in March 1954. Pursuant to the re-
-quest of the USAEC, Brookhaven and Babcock & Wilcox arranged a formal
contract to determine the feasibility of the various LMFR types.“’ The re-
sults of this study favored the externally-cooled reactor for immediate
feasibility, but the integral type, either externally or internally cooled, for
long-range possibilities.'!7 A reevaluation by Babcock & Wilcox in 1957
reaffirmed the previous conclusion.®

In 1959, the USAEC sponsored a Fluid Fuel Reactors Task Force
to compare the three fluid-fuel reactor concepts then under development:
the agqueous-homogeneous, molten-salt, and liquid-metal-fuel reactors.
Although the task force found that the liquid-metal-fuel concept could be
developed into a "hold-own" (i.e., conversion ratio = 1) breeder with reason-
able power-cost potential, the development of a suitable container material
for the slurry fuel presented too many problems for the existing technology
for the LMFR to be considered technically feasible.

Three LMFR concepts were examined: an externally-cooled, one-
fluid breeder using a U*® 0,-ThO, slurry in bismuth; an externally-cooled,
open-type breeder using U-Bi solution for fuel and circulating ThBi,
"soluble" slurry in bismuth for fertile material; and an internally-cooled

16

breeder using a slowly-circulating suspension of U?3 and Th particles in
bismuth for fuel-fertile material, with a bismuth coolant circulating sep-
arately through a graphite core. In the third concept, fuel was circulated
solely to permit degassing and fuel addition. On the basis of rules estab-
lished by the task force, the first concept of the three--the externally-
cooled, one-fluid breeder--was chosen by Babcock & Wilcox as the most
attractive firsl-generation LMFR concept for low-cost power.2?

In 1960, the USAEC terminated the liquid-metal-fuel reactor pro-
gram, as well as the agqueous homogeneous progra.rn,?‘1 At LASL, however,
developmental work on fast reactors fueled with molten plutonium was
continued with a facility for testing cores for fasl reactoro.

Chapter 2. Internally-cooled Reactors

In the reactors described in this chapter, the fuel remains stagnant
within the core except for circulation needed for changing and reprocess-
ing fuel. The circulating coolant flows around the fuel. Typically, the core
is a graphite or beryllium structure, with tubes for the fuel and passages
for coolant., IFast reactors, with no moderator, have also been designed.
Because the fuel does not circulate outside the core, internally-cooled re-
actors have.the advantages that a lower fuel inventory is needed and the
heat exchangers and other equipment outside the core are not contaminated
by radioactive coolant. Alsvu, the shielding problem is simpler. The devel-
opment of internally-cooled reactors has been contemporary with that of
externally-cooled reactors, and they have been compared at different times
for specific purposes. ‘ ‘ ’ ‘

One-fluid Reactors

In these reactors, if conversion or.breeding is desired, the fertile
material is incorporated into the fuel solution or slurry.

In 1946, Snyder suggested a fast breeder in .which the fuel and fertile
material is a slurry of uranium-235 and uranium-238 in molten metal;’
The fuel is contained in compartments to prevent gross physical changes
in the physical disposition of the active metal, with consequent changes in’
reactivity. The coolant, either an alloy of lead and bismuth or one of
sodium and potassium, flows around the compartments.

A 1947 concept was the Bismuth-cooled, Liquid-metal-fueled,
Thermal Pile.? .In this concept, alternative arrangements of the U?*? fuel,
beryllium moderator, and bismuth coolant are given: a vertical or hori-
zontal cylindrical or a spherical core; the beryllium as plates separating
fuel from the coolant or as tubes containing the coolant, with the fuel
outside. ' '

An unusual coolant, boiling rubidium, is a feature of a concept by
Grebe.? Uranium-235 in molten rubidium is the fuel. The rubidium boils;
the vapors rise to the top of the reactor, where they are condensed by
contact with cooling coils; and the liquid returnsr to the bottom of the
reactor. .. o

Two concepts for internally-cooled reactors fueled with liquid
metals were proposed in 1950 by staff members of the H. K. Ferguson Co.*
In both concepts, the coolant would bé a liquid that is lighter than, and
immiscible with, the liquid-metal fuel. A molten salt or another non-
metallic, immiscible liquid might be used as the coolant.

20

In the Bubbler-type reactor, the fuel (molte‘n uranium-bismuth or
uranium-aluminum) fills the vertical, cylindrical reactor. The lighter,
immiscible coolant is pumped to the bottom of the reactor, and bubbles of
it rise through the fuel to extract heat, which is exchanged to a secondary
coolant.

The reactor vessel in the Rotating-plate reactor, which is similar
to the Bubbler-type reactor, is a horizontal cylinder with a battery of ro-
tating metal discs. This reactor also closely resembles Grebe's Rotating-
ring concept of 1954. The immiscible coolant floats on the fuel, and heat
is transferred from fuel to coolant by the rotating metal discs. The fuel
(uranium-bismuth or uranium-aluminum) partially fills the cylinder.

An early theoretical approach was that of Neustadt,” who in 1951
made calculations to determine the effect of fuel lumping on the performance
of a reactor fueled with uranium-235 in bismuth and moderated with
beryllium. An unusual feature is the sharp difference between the tem-
perature of the molten fuel in molybdenum tubes (1947°C) and the beryllium
moderator (20°C). The two were to be separated by a gap filled with helium.
Use of the low moderator temperature and the high fuel temperature was
an attempt to partly compensate for the effect of lumping on critical mass,
Calculations showed that it would not do so.

A 1952 ORSORT term paper by Davis et _a_\.l.f’ described a concept
for a fast reactor fueled with a eutectic of iron and slightly enriched urani-
um. This sodium-cooled reactor was designed to produce 153 MW(t).

In a preliminary investigation of the thermal properties of a power
reactor, Old” proposed a fast reactor fueled with a eutectic of plutonium
and nickel. This reactor, cooled by either sodium or lead and with an out-
let temperature of 1000°F, would produce 500 MW(t).

Four designs for fast reactors were proposed in 1952 in a joint
study of reactors by the Dow Chemical Company and the Detroit-Edison
Company.®? Among them was an unusual fast reactor, the "Pineapple" re-
actor. In it, the core is a sphere of molten-metal fuel (plutonium-nickel
eutectic), at about 750°C, within a container. The metal circulates rapidly
to the container surface. Near this surface are many small recessed
cyclones, into which the fuel is inducted by jets of sodium, the coolant.
After they are mixed, the fuel and coolant are separated by centrifugal
force; the coolant goes to heat boiler tubes, and the fuel returns to the
core. With plutonium fuel, this reactor should have a specific power of
5000 kW/kg and a breeding gain of 0.8 to 1.0. A blanket of thorium or
depleted uranium was suggested for breeding. Adding appreciable amounts
of fertile material to the core would slow neutrons by inelastic collisions
and would require an increase in the critical mass.

21

The remaining three reactors are similar in structure to each other
but differ in the type of fuel, power, size, breeding gain, and other details,
In all, the core is a container of molten fuel cooled by sodium flowing in
tubes through it. The reactor is made up of sections in a radiator type of
arrangement. Individual sections might be filled outside the reactor and
inserted. The individual sections, "fuel elements," are very small--
0.1-inch diameter,.

This small size is necessary because the high heat release per unit
volume requires either such small sizes of fuel elements or large drops in
ternperature.> For breeding, a blanket of thorium or of natural or depleted
uranium would be used. The coolant temperature available for steam pro-
duction is 900°F for the first and third reactors, and 1020°F for the second.

In the first design, the fuel is a eutectic of plutonium and nickel.
It has a maximum heat output of 25 MW (t) and, at 30% efficiency, produces
7.5 MW(e). The breeding gain is 0.8.

The second design is for a reactor fueled with a slurry of uranium-
bismuth alloy in bismuth. Because of the fuel dilution, adding appreciable
amounts of uranium-238 to the core for internal breeding would be dif-
ficult. This reactor requires four times as much [issionable material
(200 kg) for criticality as does the first design, and this core volume
(200 liters) is 25 times that in the first. The reactor produces 460 MW(t)
and 138 MW (e) at 30% efficiency. The breeding gain is 0.4.

The third design includes a solution fuel (plutonium-nickel) with
solid fertile material (uranium). The critical mass and core volume are
of the same order of magnitude as those of the second design. The re-
actor produces 75 MW(t) and 22.5 MW(e), at 30% efficiency. The breeding
gain is 1.0. | :

In Grebe's Rotating-ring concept (1954),10 the moderator-coolant
is a solid, formed of a series of concentric graphite cylinders (rings)
rotating as a unit and moving through the reactor core. Thus it is similar
to the 1956 Rotating-plate Reactor of the H, K. Ferguson Co. Beryllium
or lithium-7 deuteride might be used for the rings. The molten uranium-
bismuth fuel is in annuli between the cylinders in the core, which is po-
sitioned eccentrically with respect to the axis of the rings but parallel to
it. As the rings move through the core region, they are heated. The
portions outside the core act as a heat exchanger, and boiler tubes are in
annuli in the outside area.

In a 1955 ORSORT termpaper by Burch et al.'’ is a brief descrip-
tion of a uranium-bismuth-fueled reactor cooled by both water and molten
sodium. In one part of the core, water is circulated at 1000 psi, it is
heated, and pressure is reduced to form steam. In the other, molten

22

sodium is circulated to give heat for superheating the steam formed by
the water. Breeding ratios calculated for cores of 5, 10, and 20 ft diam-
eter were too low for economic power, and the concentration of uranium
needed was above the solubility of uranium in bismauth.

One of the Babcock & Wilcox designs was for a single-fluid,
internally-cooled converter, with a graphite core, and with a slurry of
uranium and thorium as combined fuel and fertile material.'?!* Both the
fuel and molten-bismuth coolant are in passages within the graphite struc-
ture, with the coolant flowing past the fuel. The power is 825 MW (t).

A reactor with a graphite core drilled with vertical passages con-
taining fuel and horizontal passages for circulating helinm coolant was
proposed by Robba and staff members of the Raytheon Manufacturing
Cornpany.14 The fucl is highly enriched uranium in molten bismuth. The
helium leaves the core at 1300°F to produce steam at 850 psig and 900°F
in a steam generator., This reference design for a power station would
produce 16.5 MW(e). '

The first Los Alamos Molten Plutonium Reactor Experiment
(LAMPRE-I)}1¢ was a fast reactor with a molten eutectic of iron and
plutonium as fuel. The fuel is contained in tantalum capsules in a cylin-
drical core, with stainless-steel reflector pins in some of the capsule
locations and fuel in the others. The investigative program for this re-
actor included determining feasibility of separating fission gas from the
molten plutonium fuel; satisfactory fuel containment; and the suitability
of this type of reactor for power breeders. The reactor has been success-
fully operated.

An internally-cooled, one-fluid reactor for ship propulsion was
described by Byford in 1959.'7 The fuel, molten uranium-235 in bismuth,

. is contained in tubes in graphite sheaths, with provision for adding and

removing fuel., Molten bismuth flows up through coolant tubes, around

the fuel elements, and out to a heat exchanger cooled by molten salt. The
power, 33 MW(t), is considered suitable for the class of ships with about
25,000-ton dead weight, powered by a geared steam turbine of 12,000 shp.

Two one-fluid reactors have been proposed for rocket propulsion.
In the first concept, by McCarthy,18 molten uranium or plutonium is held
by centrifugal force against the walls of a rotating cylindrical rocket.
Hydrogen, which is the coolant (working fluid), is passed through small
holes into the rocket chamber, and it bubbles through the fuel. The maxi-
mum temperature is reached as the gas leaves the surface of the metal.
Possible difficulties with this concept include loss of fuel by formation of
volatile compounds with the gas or by being blown out of the chamber,
difficulties in pumping gas through the molten fuel, and the problem of
keeping the engine spinning. In the second concept, by Rom,'? which is

23

very similar to the first, molten uranium carbide (m.p. 4485°F) is the

fuel. Hydrogen passes through the walls of the rocket, which are porous
tungsten-184, and bubbles through the molten fuel and out of the nozzle,
The reactor would operate at below 6500°F and 1000 psia. (Tungsten melts
at 6120°F;) :

Two-fluid Reactors

¥
The need for more fcrtile material than could be included in a one-

fluid reactor has led to many concepts for breeder reactors, particularly
those from BNL and Lhe Babcock & Wilcox Company.

One of the earliest concepts was a two-fluid breeder, briefly de-
scribed by Young in 1946.°° A molten alloy of uranium-235 in bismuth is
contained within the walls of a beryllium moderator core, and bismuth
coolant flows around the fuel. A thorium blanket surrounds the core.

Spedding, in 1953, discussed the use of molten metals as fuels in
advanced concepts for both thermal and fast reactors.?!

In the thermal reactor, which could be a converter or breeder, the
fuel is enriched uranium in a eutectic with chromium, iron, nickel, manga-
nese, or other metals; uranium-235 would be used initially, and the
uranium-233 produced would be used later. The fuel is within tubes around
which the coolant flows, and the fertile material circulates through tubes
in the annulus at the periphery of the reactor vessel. In the other concept,
Spedding postulated that a fast reactor of the same design as for the thermal
reactor would be possible if more than 2 percent uranium could be dis-
solved in molten magnesium, ’

A design for a molten-fuel fast breeder reactor, also known as the
Power Breeder Reactor or the Fast Power Breeder Reac‘cor,?“z’?‘3 was
developed by Kelly, Robbins, Stichka, and other members of the staff of
California Research and Development Corporation. This 1953 concept in-
cludes a molten alloy of plutonium, uranium-238, and nickel as fuel, a
blanket of spheres of uranium-238 as fertile material, and control by
movement of plutonium silicide rods in the core and movement of the
fast reflector--a hollow nickel cylinder around the core. The reactor was
designed for a power of 180 MW(e).

A modification of'the Sodium Graphite Reactor to take advantage
of the properties of liquid metal fuels was. given in a preliminary design
by Balent.”* Two core arrangements were suggested. In one, a solid rod
of thorium is suspended in the molten uranium-bismuth fuel contained
in each thimble. In the other, a hollow cylinder of thorium is within the
thimble, with the fuel inside the cylinder. There is a blanket of thorium

t

for breeding.

24

A 1956 concept of the Raytheon Manufacturing Company was a gas-
cooled, .liquid-metal-fueled reactor:?®> This breeder, with a graphite core
and thorium breeding blanket, resembles many other LMFR reactors.
Materials for several components were still to be developed when this con-

cept was advanced.

A 1960 British patent26 gives a fairly conventional design for a fast
reactor that is claimed to combine the best features of the externally-
cooled reactor fueled with liquid metal with those of designs for aqueous
homogeneous reactors that have cooling coils in the core. Molten metal
(unspecified) is one of the fuels listed in the patent. The fuel is cooled by
a liquid metal, a suspension, or a molten salt clrculaiing around it through
pipes. A liquid fertile material surrounds the core.

Several designs in the Brookhaven National Laboratory LMFR pro-
gram have been for internally-cooled, two-fluid breeders.

An early design by Teitel was for a fast breeder fueled with a slurry
of fine particles of solid USnj; in molten lead-bismuth-tin, 277 3°

In 1953, Fleck made calculations on a design by Teitel for a breeder
reactor.’! Based on "a bare, homogeneous, poison-free pile," the calcu-
lations were for breeding gain and power removal for different core speci-
fications. The fuel, uranium-233 suspended in a molten alloy of tin and
lead, was to be cooled by a combined coolant and fertile material consisting
of a solution of thorium in molten bismuth.

Falkenberry et al. published a design for a helium-cooled reactor
fueled with a solution of uranium in molten bismuth.?®* The concept was
intended to combine the advantages of a liquid-metal-fuel reactor with those
of a closed-cycle gas turbine, which uses the helium (1000 psi) directly
from the reactor. The core, a graphite cube, contains vertical passages
for fuel and horizontal ones for the gas coolant. The design power 1is
148.5 MW{(t). The high pressure used would permit use of compact power-
plant equipment, )

A 1956 design, the Internally Cooled Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor,*™>7
utilized the fertile material (thorium) as coolant. The fuel, a dispersion of
fine particles of [SEEE Sn; in a molten mixture of bismuth, lead, and tin, is
contained in U-tubes within passages between graphite blocks in the core.
The coolant-fertile material passes around .each: fuel element and into a
central channel. The construction is of the integral type, with heat ex-
changers located within the same pressure vessel as the core. The power
is 155 MW(e). '

In a 1959 design for a power breeder, fertile material is in both the
fuel and anexternal blanket.’® The fuel is a slurry of uranium-233 and

25

thorium in molten bismuth, and the fertile material is a slurry of thorium
in molten bismuth. The core consists of graphite stringers with vertical
passages for fuel and coolant. The power is 825 MW(t),

The work at Babcock & Wilcox on reactors fueled with liguid metals
has been reviewed.* Beginning in 1955, with the study by this and other
companies of the LMFR concept, Babcock & Wilcox completed several de-
signs. Although the externally-cooled reactor has been given more empha-
sis, internally-cooled reactors have also been considered,

In 1957, two internally-cooled rcactors were considered as alter-
natives to the reference design for the LMFRE (see Chapter 3), but both
were rejected for power applica,tions.40 They were similar except for core
design. In one, a bayonet-type, graphite heat exchanger is immersed in
molten uranium-bismuth within holes in a block of graphite. A blanket of
fertile material is cooled in the same way. In the other, the core is a block
of graphite with vertical holes. Headers are provided for fuel and coolant.
The fuel, uranium-bismuth, and the coolant, bismuth, are in adjacent holes.
Each reactor produces 500 MW(t).

A related concept, proposed in 1958, was for a LMFR in which the
fuel is contained in melybdenum tubes with headers at the top and bottom
of the core.*'*2 The tubes are surrounded by bismuth coolant, which is in
an annulus between the fuel tubes and the graphite moderator. Designs with
several core sizes were studied, but few details were given. The design
was rejected because of the low conversion ratio and the high cost cf
molybdenum. |

A gas-cooled LMFR was described by Babcock & Wilcox staff mem-
bers in 1958.%37%® This reactor is cooled by helium passing horizontally
through the core at 500 psi. Graphite stringers form a parallelepiped, with
vertical fuel channels and horizontal holes for the passage of coolant. The
power for this reactor is 200 MW (e).

A detailed design for an internally-cooled Liquid Metal Thorium
Breeder Reactor (LMTBR) was presented in 1960.*" This reactor, with
integral construction, is similar to earlier designs, with a fuel of
uranium-235 in molten bismuth, graphite moderator, and a blanket of
fertile material. The fertile material, a slurry of thorium oxide in molten
bismuth, is also the coolant. It flows from the bottom blanket through the
core, to a heat exchanger above the core, and back to the bottom of the re-
actor vessel in a divided flow. Part of the flow goes through the side
blanket; the other goes through the annulus between the graphite core and
the core vessel. The two streams join at the bottom of the vessel. The
power for this reactor would presumably be 500 MW(t), the same as that
for an externally-cooled reactor with similar design, which was discussed
in the same report.

26

A design (LIMB) for which many advantages are described has been
proposed by Teitel.*®s¥ The advantages include those usually listed for
internally-cooled reactors, such as low fuel inventory and no transfer of
radioactivity to boilers. Some other advantages are the use of a coolant
(lead) that does not corrode graphite or steel and does not become radio-
active, high specific power (7.1 kW/kg), high breeding ratio (1.08), mini-
mized maintenance, and integral, simple treatment for reprocessing fuel
and fertile material. The core consists of a hexagonal grouping of graphite
fuel elements. Each is a tube, closed at the bottom, that contains a
plunger. The plunger is hollow, with upper and lower blanket regions
containing the fertile material, a dispersion of thorium bismuthide in a
molten alloy of bismuth and lead. The upper and lower blanket regions
are connected by a tube. When the reactor is noncritical, the plunger is in
its upper position, and the fuel, a solution of highly enriched uranium in
molten bismuth, tresls at the bottom of the tube. To make the reactor
critical, the plunger is lowered to the bottom and fuel is displaced upward
into annuli between the graphite vessel wall and the plunger in the core
region. The coolant circulates upward around the fuel elements and out
to a boiler. Portions of the fuel and blanket are regularly circulated to
separate vessels for reprocessing. In the integral construction of this re-
actor, the fuel elements and units for processing fuel and fertile material
are in the same pressure vessel., The power for this design would be
either 200 or 1000 MW(t), depending on such factors as dimensions of core,
blanket, and reflector; and fuel and blanket compositions., Steam is pro-
duced at 1000°F and 1250 psi.

The investigations at LASL on molten plutonium as a fuel for power
reactors, which were begun with LAMPRIE-I, have continued with develop-
ment of concepts for a two-region breeder and a facility for testing cores
of molten plutonium.

The design for the second Los Alamos Molten Plutonium Reactor
Experiment (LAMPRE-II), like that for the first, included a molten iron-
plutonium eutectic as fuel, tantalum containment for the fuel, sodium
coolant, and control by rods in a movable shim outside the reactor
vessel.’®"%® In the cylindrical core, the fuel is contained in tantalum tubes
in a spiral configuration. Axial blankets of fertile material (uranium-
molybdenum alloy pins) are above and below the core. A paste of uranium

"and sodium was considered for a blanket that would be more mobile than

that with pins. This design was for a total power of 20 MW(t). LAMPRE-II
was proposed in 1959, but this designation for the project was later dis-
continued, and work on this concept is now incorporated into the Fast Re-
actor Core Test Facility (FRCTF).>*

'The Fast Reactor Core Test Facility is under development at
LASL, with.several objectives: developmental testing of core materials,
complete cores, or prototype steam generators; measurements of breeding:

27

ratios; developing blanket designs, methods of purging fission products,
and control methods; determining the effect of specific powers on the
core; studying the possibility of continuous integral processing; and de-
veloping methods for purging fission products. The fucl, coolant, and
core arrangement are similar to those of the LAMPRE-II design. The
power originally designed for is 15 MW(t); a specific power of 300 W/g
Pu is sought. The target date for this facility is 1967.72,%4

A related concept, the Direct Contact Reactor, is covered in
Chapter 3.

Spherical elements, containing molten fuel, are held in molten-
metal coolant in reactors described by Westman and Seltorp.’®

Two similar designs for a thermal reactor were proposed, one by
Westman and Seltorp, and one by Seltorp. In both, a sphere of graphite
contains the molten fuel, and provision is made for escape of evolved
gaseous fission products from the spheres into the molten coolant, which
flows upward to hold the spherés near its surface. The coolant leaves to
go to a heat exchanger. The flow of coolant is reversed to discharge the
fuel. For low-enrichment fuels, spheres of graphite could be used to
fill up spaces between fuel spheres, so as to reduce neutron absorption in
the coolant. The spheres are within a spherical pressure vessel, around
which there may be a beryllium or graphite reflector.

Advantages claimed are: high thermal performance and burnup,
plutonium production, and ease of fuel changing.

In a design for a fast reactor proposed by Seltorp, the fuel element
consists of fuel tubes, which contain molten fuel and fertile material,
packed within graphite spheres. These spheres are suspended in liquid-
metal coolant, which circulates. Additional fertile material is in loops
at the periphery of the core vessel. This breeder has a doubling time of
five years and a breeding ratio of 1.9.

pp. 13-24, 1965.
Originator: R. J. Teitel.
Status: Design being evaluated, 1965.
Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder. Fuel: solution 0.5% U
(95% enriched) in molten Bi, Coolant: molten Pb; Bi or Pb-Bi alloys
might be used. Moderator and reflector: graphite. Fertile material: dis-
persion of thorium bismuthide in molten Pb-Bi. Core arrangement: tubular
graphite fuel elements in hexagonal pattern. Each element is tube, closed
at bottom end, with three zones, upper blanket, core, and lower blanket.
Within graphite tube is hollow plunger, with larger upper and lower sections
connected by tube. Fertile material in upper and lower sections. When re-
actor is noncritical, plunger is in its upper position, and fuel rests at
bottom of tube. Reactor made critical by depressing plunger. Fuel is dis-
placed upward into annuli between plunger and cylinder wall in core region.
Part of fuel goes to top of cylinder for processing. Blanket fluid circulates
from top to bottom through connecting tube. . Portions of fuel and fertile
material forced by gas pressure to separate processing tanks above re-
actor. He, used as cover gas, operates piston; reducing gas pressure below
piston moves the plunger downward. Coolant enters bottom of core vessel
at 752°F, rises around fuel elements and moves radially outward through
plenum at top to go to boiler. Outlet temperature: 1022°F; steam produced
at 1000°F and 1250 psi. Containment: integral comstruction, with fuel ele-
ments and units for processing fuel and fecrtile material in same stainless-
steel vessel. Control: small movement of plunger causes large changes
in activity; withdrawal of plunger displaces fuel to bottom and shuts down
reactor; liquid-metal poison--alloys of Cd or In--could be displaced into
core. Power: 200 or 1000 MW(t), depending on dimensions of core,
blanket, and reflector, and on fuel and blanket compositions.

to make annular space. With low-enrichment fuels, to reduce neutron
absorption in coolant, balls of moderator fill up space between fuel ele-
ments; space between moderator balls partially filled with moderator
granules. Granules circulate with coolant. Fuel elements {(same sp. gr.
as coolant) held near top of core during power operation because of coolant
flow. Coolant flows into bottom 'of reactor, into channels in outer con-
tainer of fuel element, out of fuel element, and out top of reactor. Flow
reversed to discharge fuel. Spherical pressure reactor vessel, typically
about 22-1t ID, of material of low neutron cross section and resistant to

- Chapter 3. Externally-cooled Reactors

These reactors, which are cooled by the molten fuel circulating
outside the core for heat exchange, have been suggested for both propul-
sion and ccntral-station power.

One-fluid Reactors

Apparently, the earliest suggestion for fusing molten metals as
fuels was that of Halban and Kowarski.! They proposed in 1941 that a
molten alloy of uranium and bismuth he circulated cutside the reactor
("builer") for cooling in an external heat exchanger. The reactor would
be moderated with heavy water. The authors believed that the real limi-
tation on power would be the speed with which the molten alloy could be
circulated. A power of 40 MW(t) was projected for a system containing
2 tons of heavy water, and 5500 kg of uranium--500 kg within the boiler
at any moment, and 5000 kg in the heat exchanger. Some difficulty was-
foreseen in obtaining a material in which the .imetal could circulate within
the boiler. It would have to be temperature-resistant, have low absorp-
tion for slow neutrons, and not be too light an element.

Several reactor designs were suggested for propulsion in the period
1949-1951. -

In 1949, staff members of the NEPA division of Fairchild Engine
and Aviation Corporation suggested a reactor, fueled with a molten alloy
of uranium and bismuth, for aircraft propulsion.? The fuel would flow
through a graphite core, leaving at 1800°F. The power given'is 600 MW(t).
It was hoped to show the feasibility of a design that appeared to require
relatively little research and development. The authors concluded that
such a reactor would avoid many of the difficulties of other reactors for
aircraft. '

Four related concepts for reactors with circulating liquid-metal
fuels were proposed by staff members of the H. K. Ferguson Co. in 1950-
1951.%* In the circulating-fuel, dispersed-moderator reactor, the fuel
is either uranium-bismuth or a molten mixture of uranium dioxide and
lead dioxide. The beryllium moderator is distributed throughout the core
of the cylindrical reactor. The circulating-fuel, reflector-moderator
reactor, as the name indicates, differs in that the moderator is the beryl-
lium or beryllium oxide reflector in this spherical reactor. In the
circulating-fuel, beryllium-moderated reactor, the uranium-bismuth fuel
flows downward in tubes through the berylliurn moderator to a heat ex-
changer. A later development of this concept is the 1951 circulating-fuel
reactor. Here more detail is given on core structure, reflector, and con-
trol methods.
60

Another 1951 design for aircraft propulsion, originated by McDonald,
was for a uranium-bismuth fuel, and a moderator core of rods composed of
beryllium carbide and carbon, through which the fuel flows.” A saving in
uranium investment is postulated to be possible because no reflector is in-
cluded in the design. Problems that the author believed would determine
the feasibility of the concept were: fabricating the moderator rods, deter-
mining their structural stability under flight conditions, and determining
the effects on the moderator of radiation and the fuel solution.

A variation of this design utilized water as moderator-reflector.’
The core consists of thermally-insulated stainless-steel tubes forming an
equilateral triangle. The tubes are surrounded by water The fuel passes
through the tubes to an intermediate heat exchanger and back to the core;
the exit temperature is 1326°F. The water moderator is also cooled by
circulation to a heat exchanger. Advantages listed included: no need for
high-performance heat transfer or thermally-stressed solid-fuel elements;
simple fabrication, construction, and fuel processing; a negative tempera-
ture coefficient; and no serious concern about radiation damage to the
reactor. The feasibility of the design was considered to depend on whether
high maximum temperatures and power would be possible with materials
that were easily available.

An ORSORT concept of 1955 by Beusman et a_l.6 utilized the Fireball
core structure (see Section III, Chapter 2). The fuel is a slurry of uranium
dioxide in molten sodium. The reactor would give either 60 or 300 MW(t),
depending upon core parameters.

Three Brookhaven concepts for externally-cooled reactors were for
one-~fluid designs.

In 1955, Mozer' calculated characteristics of a reactor consisting
of two spherically-concentric regions, a core containing a homogeneous
molten mixture of uranium and bismuth, and a reflector of graphite.
Uranium-233 and uranium-235 were considered as fuels (in bismuth), and
changes in critical size and critical mass with changes in uranium concen-
trations were determined. Cores varied from 1 to 5 ft in diameter, and
critical masses from 11 to 45 kg of uranium. The fuel inventory with
uranium-235 was almost triple that with uranium-233. The authors con-
cluded that externally-moderated LMFR's with a core U/Bi atomic ratio
of less than 10 percent can produce a useful thermal flux greater than
10%° neutrons/sq cm/sec at low power.

A design that was given a preliminary evaluation is the LMFR
Single-region Burner.®’? The molten bismuth-uranium-233 fuel flows from
the bottom upward through a graphite core surrounded by a graphite re-
flector, which is cooled by molten bismuth. The power is 550 MW(t).

61

Recycled plutonium was a feature of a 1958 design by Miles et al. for
a reactor that could be either a burner or converter.'® Use of impure
plutonium-239 from outside sources would aid fuel economy. Depleted or
natural uranium could be added to the molten plutoniurm-bismuth solution to
furnish fertile material for breeding plutonium-239. The design was in-
tended to use as far as possible only components that had already been de-
monstrated or were under active development and to avoid arrangements
that would require further development. The fuel passes upward through
perforations in the cylindrical graphite rcactor, and out to secondary heat
exchangers. The design is for 180 MW(e) net.

The work by the Babcock & Wilcox Company included the design and
construction of a Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor Experiment (LMFRE). Two
designs were proposed, a first reference design, and a final reference
design. '

In the first design (1957),"7'* a burner, a solution of highly enriched
uranium in-bismuth enters at 750°F and flows upward through channels in
the graphite core, reaching a temperature of 885°F. The power was ex-
pected to be 20 MW(t) at first, with an increase to 33% MW(t) projected if
the temperature rise in the reactor could be increased to above 135°F.

Use of a blanket of fertile material so that the reactor could be a breeder
was considered, but it was decided that the research and development re-
quired for such a blanket could not be completed in time.

The final reference design, published in 195
it was decided to study a simpler, more economical design, with the as-
sumption that more than one experimental reactor would be built before
design of the large-scale LMFR plant. The reactor was designed for a
lower power--8.33 MW(t) maximum, with normal operation at 5 MW(t).
Although it was considered that a slurry would be used later,.a solution
of uranium in bismuth was used as fuel because of the need to first obtain
basic reactor kinetics on the simpler solution system. The general core
design, fuel flow, and cooling arrangement are like those of the first design;
after heat exchange in a bismuth-cooled heat exchanger, the heat would be

ultimately rejected to air.

A 1960 Babcock & Wilcox concept, a single-fluid LMFR,®72% ytilized
a suspension of uranium dioxide in bismuth for fuel, with thorium oxide
added to provide fertile material. The fuel flows upward through vertical
channels in the graphite blocks forming the core. The power level is
315 MW(e). Advantages listed for this design, in addition to those of one-
fluid reactors generally, are a simplified design and a 20-year fuel-
processing cycle.

In 1960, staff members published a feasibility study of the High
Temperature Integral Reactor (HTIR).?!72® In this concept, the fuel--
either slightly enriched uranium in molten bismuth, or plutonium-239--
circulates upward through a core of high-density graphite. From the top

62

of the core the fuel solution, at 1300°F, goes to:a heat exchanger, for cool-
ing with boiling mercury, and returns to the bottom of the core. The power
is 315 MW(e). Integral construction is used, with the core, reflector, and
mercury-cooled heat exchanger contained inside the same pressure vessel.
This design, with the choice of fuel, coolant, and construction materials,

is claimed to have many advantages. They include: negligible corrosion
or mass transfer; low energy costs; a fuel that can withstand prolonged
irradiation; a net efficiency of about 50 percent; low fuel costs (about I mill/
kw-hr); a compact plant that requires low capital investment and low main-
tenance costs; average conversion ratios of more than 0.6; and a total
energy cost of less than 7 mills/kw—hr. The use of mercury coolant, made
possible by the high temperature of the fuel leaving the reaclor, is a major
factor given for some of these advantages. Also, the low vapor pressure,
absence of such hazardous possibilities as metal-water reactions, and the
stability of the system against large increases in reactivity are believed

to make the reactor unusually safe.

Davidson et al., of KAPL, investigated the possibilities of slurries
of uranium compounds in liquid metals as practical reactor fuels.?*?% In
a design for a stationary power plant, a slurry of finely divided (1-5u)
uranium dioxide in molten bismuth is pumped upward through tubes in a
core of graphite, beryllium, or beryllium oxide. Either natural uranium,
slightly enriched uranium, or plutonium could be used as fuel. Alternative
methods of operating with different fuels were suggested. The reactor
power is 500 MW(t). The slurry was believed to be relatively stable, with
a low settling rate. Other advantages stated include a high conversion ratio
(0.8 or 0.9 with 10-15 vol.% fuel suspended); a simple fuel-processing
cycle; resistance of construction materials to detcrioration; and a high

thermal efficiency.

Two-fluid Reactors

As with molten-salt reactors, the two-fluid design represents an
advanced stage in the development of liquid-metal-fueled reactors. The
externally-cooled, two-fluid design has been developed into reference
designs by the staffs at BNL and Babcock & Wilcox.

In a concept by Wigner, Weinberg, and Young,26 heavy-water mod-
erator surrounds tubes through which a slurry of uranium-233 in molten
bismuth circulates. The heavy water prevents neutron loss and facilitates
disposal of Xe'?*. This early slurry concept was among the first in which

the problem of maintaining a suitable slurry in liquid metal arose.

A concept, proposed in 1947 by Menke, Wigner, and Weinberg, was
designed to combine the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of fast and
thermal piles.?”?® It was hoped that the design would utilize the better
neutron economy of the fast pile and retain the small critical size and

63

better control of the thermal pile. The reactor consists of concentric
spherical shells. The innermost shell is a fast core. It is surrounded
successively by shells containing a thermal core, a beryllium reflector,
and a blanket of fertile material. The fast core is fueled with plutonium
or uranium-233 in molten bismuth. The thermal core is fueled with
uranium-233 in molten bismuth and moderated by the beryllium. The
blanket is uranium-238 and thorium. The reactor is not critical in the
fast core alone. The method of cooling is not specified, but presumably
the fuel solutions could circulate to an external heat exchanger. Control
is stated to be possible with thermal-neutron absorbers. No useful power
is specified for this design. The breeding gain is given as 0.1 (v 0.2 for
uranium-233 and 0.2 to 0.3 for plutonium-239.

A 1947 concept, for which few details are given, is the molten-
alloy epithermal plutonium pile.?? In this concept, suggested by Connick,
the fuel, a molten uranium-plutonium alloy plus a diluent, presumably
circulates to an external heat exchanger for cooling. Uranium-238 is the
fertile material in this breeder.

A BNL design for a breeder intended to'utilize the advantages of
molten metals as fuels was published in 1951-1952.3°732 The fuel, a molten
solution of uranium-233 in bismuth, circulates upward through a core con-
taining graphite or beryllium rods and out to a heat exchanger before re-
turn to the bottom of the core. The fertile material, either a slurry of
thorium oxide in heavy water or a blanket of thorium fluoride pellets, sur-
rounds the core. The fluoride blanket was being developed, but the thoria
slurry was considered easier to cool. A molten solution of uranium-235
in bismuth might be used as fuel for startup or if the reactor were to be
operated as a converter instead of a breeder. The power is 450 MW(t). A
reactor experiment before construction of this reactor was suggested.

Two Brookhaven concepts were for alternative fuels and coolants
for the second LFR.?>?® In one, a suspension of an. alloy of uranium and tin
in molten lead, bismuth, or tin was suggested to increase the uranium con-
centration and to allow lower operating temperatures. In the other, sus-
pensions in liquid metal of such uranium compounds as oxides, nitrides,
carbides, or silicides were proposed.

BNL staff members described a reactor for central-station power
to produce-210 ]MW(e).34-3'6 The main elements resemble those of earlier
designs: uranium-233 in molten bismuth as the liquid fuel; a cylindrical
graphite core through which the fuel flows upward and out; a circulating
slurry of thorium bismuthide as fertile material around the core; a graph-
ite reflector; and external heat exchangers for fuel and fertile material.

A breeding ratio of about one was expected.
64

Part of the supporting work at BNL on the LMFRE project was a
preliminary design in 1956 for a reactor experiment (LMFRE-I) to operate
at low power [5 MW(t)].?" It was hoped that the design would be useful in
preparing the final LMFRE design. The fuel is a molten solution of
uranium-233 or -235 in bismuth, the fertile material is thorium bismuthide
dispersed in molten bismuth, and the core is a cylinder of graphite. The
fertile material circulates in loops within the graphite reflector around
the core.

A multiregion reactor, designed to reduce neutron loss and in-
crease breeding gain, was described in a 1954 report by Mozer and a 1961
U.S. patent of Miles, which was applied for in 1956.%%'3% The reaclor re-
sembles the earlier concept of Menke, Wiginer, and Weinberg.?"’*® The BNL
concept consists of two concentric spherical cores, an inner moderated
core (Zone I} and an outer unmoderated one (Zone II); a container for the
cores {(Zone III}; and two blankets of fertile material, an inner one of
thorium (Zone IV) and an outer one of thorium and carbon (Zone V). In
Zone I is molten uranium-233 or -235, in bismuth, with a graphite or
beryllium moderator. Zone II contains unmoderated uranium-233 in bis-
muth. Zone IV, the inner blanket, contains thorium, possibly as thorium
fluoride. Zone 'V, the outer blanket, contains thorium fluoride with a carbon
moderator. A reflector surrounds the outer blanket. According to the
authors, the unmoderated uranium-233 in Zone II absorbs thermal neutrons
from Zone I and produces fast neutrons, which escape capture by the stain-
less steel around the core. This makes for more efficient breeding. Fast
neutrons from Zone II that are not captured in Zone IV continue to Zone V,

- where they are moderated and absorbed by the fertile material. No cooling

means is specified, but presumably the fuel and blankets could circulate
to heat exchangers.

A 1955 reference design for an externally-cooled two-fluid reactor
was used in the evaluation of the LMFR concept by a study group repre-
senting 17 industrial firms. Under the direction of Babcock & Wilcox, the
group worked at BNL.%"%!1 The group concluded that the LMFR could be
shown to be technically feasible in the near future and that the concept was
economically attractive. Their study resulted in the design of a. large power
station. The two-fluid reactor utilizes the thorium-uranium-233 breeding
cycle. A molten solution of uranium-233 in bismuth flows through the
graphite core; several possible flow patterns were considered. The fer-
tile material, a slurry of thorium bismuthide in molten bismuth, flows
through a graphite region around the core. A power of 225 MW(e) and a
net breeding ratio of 0.79 are postulated for this design. Construction of
a 5-MW prototype was proposed for a test program before construction of
the full-scale reactor. '

A similar concept was that proposed by B&W in 1958 for an
LMFR.*¥"%* It has a molten uranium-bismuth fuel, a graphite core, and a

. | f

65

blanket of fertile material, either thorium bismuthide in bismuth or a slurry
of thorium oxide particles in bismuth. The power projected was 315 MW(e),
and a breeding ratio of 1.026 was given.

An advanced stage in the development of a liquid-metal-fueled re-
actor was the Liquid Metal Thorium Breeder Reactor (LMTBR), for which
a reference design was published in 1960.*°> The design was submitted to
aid the USAEC in selecting concepts for development under the thermal-
breeder program. It was a modification of the High Temperature Integral
Reactor to give a two-fluid design. This design was the basis for that used
by Alexander et al. nf OQRNL in their 1961 evaluation of thorium breeder
reactors®® (see below). In the design, the fuel, molten uranium-233 in bis-
muth, contains thorium, the fertile material. The core, made up of graphite
subassemblies, is surrounded by other graphite subassemblies that also con-
tain fertile material. Both fuel and blanket circulate to external heat ex-
changers. Integral construction is used, with the heat exchangers and pumps
within the same pressure vessel as the core and blanket. This reactor was
designed for 500 MW(e) and had a breeding ratio of 1.10; two reactors were
to be used in a power station. ‘

The Liquid Bismuth Breeder Reactor considered by Alexander
et _.':_L_l_.46 resembled the above concept, but there is no fertile material in the
fuel, and dimensions and operating conditions differ.

A 1955 ORSORT term paper described a reactor in which the liquid-
metal fuel (uranium-233 in bismuth), after two-pass flow through the graph-
ite core, is cooled by direct contact with a molten eutectic of potassium
and lithium chlorides in a jet pump above the core.*” To reduce entrain-
ment of coolant in the fuel, an annular settling ring limits the velocity of
fuel returning to the core. A blanket of thorium dispersed in molten bis-
muth acts as fertile material and reflector. This design was for a breed-
ing ratio of 0.987 and a power of 300 MW(e). Many of the nuclear
calculations for this concept were based on findings from the LMFR pro-
ject at BNL.

Two reactors on which few details are given are the LMFR-SGR
Power Reactor of the Dow. Chemical Company®® and the City of Qrlando
(Florida) Reactor.’” The design for the Dow reactor, which was to utilize
engineering and methods of operation of the Sodium Graphite Reactor, in-
cludes molten fuel of uranium-235 in bismuth, a graphite core, and a blan-
ket of solid fertile elements, which were not described. It was designed
for a power of 250 MW(t). The design of the City of Orlando Reactor has
no unique features that differentiate it from most other reactors fuelcd
with molten uranium-bismuth. This concept is apparently an adaptation of
existing concepts by the engineering firm of Black and Veatch for the
Orlando Utilities Commission. .The proposal for a 25-40 MW(e) reactor
was submitted to the USAEC under the Power Reactor Demonstration

Program, but it was rejected on the grounds that technical feasibility was
not established. ’

66

Two closely related concepts were proposed by AERE workers in
1956°° and 1958.°' In both, the fuel is molten uranium-233 in bismuth. In
one, the blanket is thorium, in the other, thorium bismuthide in bismuth.
Both fuel and blanket circulate through or around a graphite core. The
power for the 1956 design is 500 MW(t); that for the 1958 design is
755 MW(t).

In a 1962 patent,”® Rodin and Carter disclosed a design for a reactor
in which a slurry of uranium dioxide in molten NaK flows through a helix
around a graphite cylinder, with another graphite cylinder around the inner
one. The fuel flows to an external heat-exchange system. The reactor
power is 2 MW(t). Advantages listed by the authors include: simple de-
sign, with ease of disassembly; fuel containment of high integrity and re-
liability; internal and external reflectors that permit neutron flux to be
concentrated; and the possibility for use either in research reactors or
as a power source in remote locations.

Like the Mixed Fast and Thermal Pile (Data Sheet No. 19) and the
Multiregion Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor (Data Sheet No. 26), the Los Alamos
Direct Contact Reactor has a multizoned core and blanket.”®* It is a de-
scendant of the LAMPRE reactor and the Fast Reactor Core Test Facility
(Chapter 2) in that it is a part of the LASL program of development of re-
actors fueled with molten plutonium. In addition to the usual advantages
of liquid fuels, this concept offers the possibility of a negative fuel cost,
with the value of the plutonium bred exceeding all fuel costs.

The fuel is a molten alloy of plutonium, cobalt, and cerium. The
fertile material is uranium-238 dioxide in a paste with molten sodium. The
fuel is in three tantalum core capsules in a triangular array within a ver-
tical cylindrical tank. Each core capsule has a core container, inner
blanket, heat exchangers, and other primary equipment in a cylindrical
container. An inner blanket region surrounds each core, and an external
blanket region surrounds the three core units. The fuel is rapidly circu-
lated through the core by a jet of sodium coolant; thus cooling is by direct
contact with an immiscible coolant, as in the earlier ORSORT concept47
(see above). The fuel and coolant are separated centrifugally above the
core. The inner blanket is pumped as a dilute slurry, but settles in the re-
gion around the core as a dense paste. The outer blanket, which settles in
the bottom of the main reactor vessel, also circulates. The design power is
300 MW(t). It was expected that four or five years would be required for a
feasibility study, and the same amount of time would be needed for con-
structing a prototype. A plant with this reactor system was compared in
economic potential with one using a solid-fuel breeder reactor that was
based on an APDA-PRDC-Detroit Edison concept. The savings in fueling
cost for the mobile-fuel reactor was estimated as being greater than the
additional investment and operating cost required.

References: LA-2644; Nuclear Sci. Eng., 18, pp. 421-425,1964. .
Originators: R. P. Hammond, R. E. L. Stanford, and J. R. Humphreys, Jr.
Status: Conceptual design, 1961.
Details: Fast neutrons, steady state, breeder. Fuel-coolant: molten alloy
of 7.5 at.% Pu-25 at.% Co-67.5 at.% Ce. Secondary coolant system: Na.
Fertile material: U?*® as paste of UO, in Na. Structure: three Ta or Ta-W
core capsules located in vertical cylindrical tank. Each cylindrical cap-
sule, 4 ft in diameter, contains core and, above it, successively; jet pump
and phase separator, sodium heat exchanger, sodium pump, and surgc
volume. Two blanket regions: inuer 1egion, surrounding each core; and
outer region, surrounding three core units. Blanket in inner region is
pumped as a dilute slurry, but settles in the region around the core as a
dense paste. Blanket cooled, through heat exchanger, by portion of second-
ary Na coolant. Outer blanket system, in bottom of main reactor vessel,
circulates. Small amount of heat generated removed by thermal conduc-
tion. Core containment: integral construction. Main reactor vessel--
cylindrical tank, 13% ft in diameter, 41 ft high, clad with stainless steel.
Fuel is rapidly circulated through core by jet of liquid Na. Coolant and
fuel separated by a cyclone; fuel returns to core and coolant goes to heat
exchanger. Control: negative temperature coefficient; change in heat
demand; shutdown by pumping fuel out of core. Power: 800 MW(t);
300 MW{e) net. Breeding ratio: 1.3.
