FOREWORD

The customary approach to reactor development assumes that a reactor
is primarily a mechanical engineering device—that the ultimate goal of
economically competitive nuclear power will be achieved by simplifying
the mechanical design and by making the fuel elements more reliable.
The other, basically different, view of reactor technology holds that
reactors are chemical plants—that the methods which have proved so
useful in rationalizing the chemical industry, i.e., the continuous handling
of materials in liquid form, should lead to ultimate economies in reactor
plants. This “chemical” approach to reactors has been pursued vigorously
in the United States for almost a decade; it is summarized in this volume
on fluid fuel reactors.

The basic simplicity of the liquid reactor—the original idea of “a pot,
pump, and pipe”—has hardly persisted throughout the years. Those
who have actually built and operated high-temperature, high-powered
liquid reactors have become impressed with their difficulty—the difficulty
primarily of handling vast amounts of radioactivity in labile form. It
seems now that liquid reactor systems, when reduced to practice, are in
many ways more complicated than their solid competitors; at least their
complications (being in the plumbing system) are much more obtrusive
than the complications of a solid fuel reactor, which lie out of sight in the
core.

Yet in spite of their difficulties, the two underlying motivations for
liquid and other fluid systems remain: their fuel cycle is simpler and their
neutron economy is better than for solid-fueled reactors. Thus there
continues to be strong incentive to develop these systems. It is the belief
of fluid fuel enthusiasts that in the very long run the simplification in fuel
cycle and, more important, the better neutron economy made possible
by the use of fluid fuels will outweigh the difficult handling problems and
ultimately weight the balance of reactor development toward these systems.

The present volume contains a summary of the work done in the United
States on fluid fuel reactors. The first part deals with the aqueous homo-
geneous reactor; most of this work has been done at the Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory, with some phases of the work (on slurries) at Westing-
house Atomic Power Division and some work on phosphate solutions at
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. The second part deals with the fused
salt system, which has been investigated primarily at the Oak Ridge
Laboratory; the third part deals with the bismuth-uranium system, in-
vestigated at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

v
vi FOREWORD

It is my hope that the results described here will be helpful to all who
are interested in fluid fuel systems, and that, by disseminating this in-
formation, new ideas and new approaches will be generated to help solve
the remaining problems of fluid fuel reactors.

In their work on this book the editors and
authors were assisted by representatives of
the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission’s Indus-
trial Information Branch, Technical Informa-
tion Service. Charles D. McKereghan was
book project officer, and DeWitt O. Myatt
guided the styling of the art. The Technical
Information Service Extension at Oak Ridge
put the references in final form.

The references cite a number of publications
issued by the Atomic Energy Commission.
These are available for inspection at the Com-
mission’s depository libraries in the United
States and abroad and are sold by the Office
