PARAMETRIC SURVEY OF THE EFFECTS OF MAJOR PARAMETERS
| ON THE DESIGN OF FUEL-TO-INERT-SALT HEAT
EXCHANGERS FOR MOLTEN SALT REACTORS

A. P. Fraas and M. E. LaVerne
ABSTRACT

The design of heat exchangers for molten salt reactors
involves so many parameters and their interrelationships are
so complex that it is difficult to envision the effects of
the various trade-offs that can be made in attempts to opti-
mize the system. This report presents a procedure for
carrying out such analyses together with the results of a
parametric study showing the effects of tube diameter, fuel
pressure drop, inert salt pressure drop, and the temperature
difference between the fuel and the inert salt with either
NaBF, or Flinak as the fluid in the intermediate heat trans-
port system An unusual design for a 2200 Mw(t), 100 Mw(e)
power plant? was used as the reference design for the de-
tailed calculations of the parametric study presented in
thls report.

INTRODUCTION

In response to & request from.R.'B.'Briggs of this Laboratory,
A. P. Fraas worked out a conceptual design for a molten-salt breeder
reactor in which the heat exchangers and the pumps were‘enclosed with
the reactor in a single pressure vessel.® This design'approach was
taken in part to minimize the fuel inventory in the system and in part
to avoid difficulties with'thermal stresses and possible thermal stress
cracking that might be. caused by differential expansion in connectlng
plplng Extremely dlfflcult problems arise in plplng systems in whlch the
pipe length-diameter ratlo is too low to give good flex1bility for accom-

modation of the dlfferentlal thermal expansion between the hot and cold

'portlons of the system ThlS 1s partlcularly 80 because the system must

also be de31gned to w1thstand a severe earthquake.

'When the report descrlblng the 1ntegrated reactor-heat exchanger de-

's1gn was 01rculated 1n rough draft form, quite a number of people raised

questlons with regard to ‘the effects on fuel inventory of changes in the

major des1gn parameters. The analys1s presented in the following section

- was therefore carrled out to answer these questions. Inasmuch as the
 

2

calculational technique and computer program have general application, it

seemed desirable to present the study in this report.
SUMMARY

An anaslysis has been made of the performance of fuel-to-inert-salt
heat exchangers for the MSER. - Employing this analysis, a parametric study
has been made of the effects on the heat exchanger design of changes in the
input parameters of major interest. The result is to clarify the effects
of the various trade-offs that can be médé in attempts to optimize the sys-
tem design. Table 1 is a concise summary of the principal results of the

parametric study.

Minimization of the heat exchanger fuel inventory is highly desirable.
As can be seen from Table 1, the fuel inventory can be reduced by decreas-
ing the tube size, increasing the.fuel pressure drop, changing the inert
salt from NaEF, to Flinak, and by increasing the temperature difference
between the fuel and inert salt. Note that, in contrast with thé effect

of the fuel pressure drop, the fuel inventory is increased by an increase

in the inert salt pressure drop. From the table, one can deduce that, if
all the parameter changes producing reductions were employed, a reduction
in heat exchanger fuel inventory of as much as 62% could be obtained over
the reference design conditions. For the full-scale 1000 Mw(e) reactor
system described in Ref, 1, this would mean a reduction in total system
fuel inventory from approximately 1185 ft3 to approximately 871 ft3 for
NaBF; and from about 1095 ft> to about 825 ft for Flinak.

Fabrication costs for a tube bundle will depend primarily on the num-

ber of tubes in the bundle;'because this determines the number of header

- welds required. Material costs will vary with tube length and the total

tube cross~sectionallarear For the same set of parameter changes employed
above with respect to fuel inventory, one finds virtually no change in

the number of tubes and, thus, essentially an unchanged fabrication cost.
Tube'length,'from Table 1, is,reduced‘by a factor of approximately O.45.
The smaller tube'cross-sectional area contributes a further factor of 0.68,
for an overall reduction_factor of about 0.3, that is, a reduction in mate-
rial weight of nearly 70%. | -

A substantial fraction of the above savings is predicated on the
ability to increase the temperature difference between the fuel and inert
salt from 100 to 150°F; Experience gained in the ANP Program with thermal
stresses indicated that it is not difficult to assure a high degree of
reliability and freedom from difficulties with thermal stresses if the
temperature difference between the two fluid circuits does not exceed 100°F.
However, with careful design it seems likely thet the temperature differ-

‘ence might be increased to]asrmuch as 150°F without deleterious effects

provided that both”sfthorough"analysis_and near full-scsle'tests could be

~carried out.

As can be shown from the equatlons in the analysis of this report for

8 given system and fluid temperature rise, the pumping power in either

fluid circuit depends only on the salt properties and the pressure drop in

dthat circuit being linear in the pressure drop. Thus, for a given fuel
and inert salt combination, the pumping power can be reduced only by reduc-

" ing the pressure drop For a given fuel and set of specified operating

conditions, the pumping power can be reduced 10 to 20% by using Flinak in
 

 

place of NaBF, in the secondary circuit. The savings in total heat ex-
changer pumping power range from 10 to 20%, depending only on the ratio

of the inert salt pressure drop to the fuel pressure drop.
ANALYSIS

The analysis presented in this section is predicated on the use of
smooth, round tubes on an equilateral triangular pitch with axial fluid
flow outside the tubes. Conventional, well-established relationships
were used for the various heat balance, convective heat transfer, and
pressﬁre drop equations employed. (Recent experiments with molten salt
favor reducing the heat transfer coefficients about 15% from the values

used here.)

Design Bases and Criteria

 

The analysis and parametric study presented in this report were
carried out on the basis of a U-tube heet exchanger tube bundle having
the tubes in an equilateral triangular pattern with the fuel salt flowing
axially on the shell side and the inert salt (in the secondary circuit)
in counterflow on the tube side as described in Ref. 1. A cross section
of the exchanger configuration envisaged is shown in Fig. 1. However, as
will be seen subsequently, the analysis is by no means limited to the
particular configuration and conditions treated here but is applicablé to
a much wider range of problems. | |

The tubes were placed on an equilateral triangular pitch, rather
than a square pitch, in order to increase the thickness of the fluid
stream in the region between adjacent tubes because data from ANP heat
exchanger tests had indicated that thin fluid ligaments between tubes
'lead to flow stratification and a loss in heat transfer performance. This
effect was deduced from the curves in'Figs. 2 and 3, which were obtained
with ANP heat exchangers.®

‘The tube spacers, consisting of "oombs" of flattened wire, employed
in the ANP heat exchangers could be used with the equilateral triangular
spacing considered hefe. That approach would yield &n increase in pres-
sure drop by a factor of about 1.5 over that for the ideal case with no

spacers. It seems likely that spiral wire spacers would lead to an

increase in pressure dfbp Somewhat less than this and they might also have
a somewhat more favorable effect on the heat transfer coefficient, but no
clear-cut data are available, A definitive ansﬁer to these guestions would
require testing of the exact geometry of the heat exchanger matrix contem-
plated. | | |

Similarly, the effects of varlous types of surface roughness designed
to increase the heat transfer coefficiEnt,.in.fabt, aréfvery-difficult to
predict and will also require tests of the éXact geometry contemplated in
order to determine the extént to which the heat trahsfer coefficient is
improved at the expense of an increase in préssure drop. Because it ap-
pears that surface roughness frequently has not paid important dividends
for cases of the type of interest here, and because of the uncertainties
involved, it was decided to conduct the analysis assuﬁing bare, smooth

tubes with no allowances for spacers, Incluéion'of:the latter would in-

_créase the fuel pressure drop by around 30 to 50%, but should also in-

crease the heat transfer coefficient somewhat so that, with an equilateral

triangular tube pattern, the_éhélléside.heat transfer coefficient might

- well be higher than for-the.corfesponding circular passages inside the

round tubes.

 Solution of the Equations

Let us take as input parameters (independent variables) the total heat

. transport ‘the pressure drops on the ‘shell and tube-sides, the tube size,

the temperature phanges\in the,two fluid streams, and the overall_tempera-
ture difference between_the'fiuids.- Then5,the foregoing set of 11 equa-
tions is just sufficient to determine the two mass flows, the equivalent
diameter and flow area on the .shell side, the overall length and number of

tubes in the bundle, the three transverse temperature differences, and the

‘two heat transfer eoefficients,_ll dependent variables in all.

- The coefficients and exponents appearing in Eq. 23 are, in general, rather

complex combinations of the coefficients Cy through Cy; and the various
coefficients and eprnegts obtained from Table 3, Details of the elimina-
tion process will not bérpresented'here but are availgble in Appendix A.

'-'Although the parametfic;étudy:presentedjlater'in this-repbrt aSéumes

© an equilateral triangular tube pattern and fused salts in counterflow with

equal temperature changes in the two streams, the basic analysis is not,
in fact, so limited, as will be shown below.

6ther Fluids

Equations 6 and 7 for the convective heat transfer.coefficients,
although applied in the parametric study only to fused salts, are actually
applicable to any fluid having a relatively high Prandtl number, For
liquids of very low Prandtl number, such as liquid metals, Eqs. 6 and 7
must be modified, For example, one could employ the Lubarsky-Kaufman re-
lation® for the Nusselt number in turbulent flow and the theoretical value
of 4.36 in laminar flow.  These changes involve only redefining the expo-

nent on the Prandtl number in Egs. 6 and 7 to be a variasble rather than
the present constant and extending Table 3.

‘Tube Patterns

The basic equations, 1 though 11, contain no reference to tube pat-
tern, per se. The implication is that, for a given set of input parameters,
- the same solution set of dependent variables would be obtained for an
equilateral triangular pattern as for, say, a square pattern. This, of
course, involves the implicit assumption that the latter spacing is not
such as to result in the performance deterioration dbserved in Figs. 1
and 2. S

In order to determine tube spacing, one must employ an auxiliary rela-
tion such as Eq. 25,

A, = N(/352/2 — 1D2/4) - (25)

which defines the tube spacing in terms of the shell-side flow area, the
number of tubes, and the tube OD for an equilateral triangular pattern.

Other Conditions

Although applied in the parametric study only to a counterflow heat
exchanger with equal temperature -changes in the two streams,_the present

.analysis may be extended readily, both to parallel flow and to counterflow

 with unequal temperature changes, by the simple device of properly defin-

”ing the overall temperature difference. The appropriate quantity is the
log mean temperature difference (IMTD), defined by~
 

-

15

GTD — LTD

IMTD = ——————— (26)
' log ——== GTD

eLTD

where GTD is the greater and LTD is the lesser of the two terminal tem-
perature differences between the two streams. When the two temperature
differences are equal, the IMTD becomes indeterminate and must be taken
as equal to either of the two temperature differences, The existing com~

puter program uses these definitions.

PARAMETRIC STUDY

In this study, the U-tube configuration of Fig. 1 was employed, with
the fuel salt flowing axially sround the tubes on the shell side and with
the inert salt in counterflow inside the tubes. The heat.load was kept
fixed and equal to that for one of the six heat exchangers for a 2200
Mw (t) reference design reactor.l The tube wall material was taken to be
INCO 800 and the fuelxemployed was the lithium-beryllium-thorium-uranium

- fuel salt in current use for reference design purposes at the time of

writing. Two different inert salts, NaBF, and Flinak, were used in the
secondary circuit. The. physical properties of the materials used were
taken from Refs. 7 and 8 as tabulated in Table 4 The temperature rise in
the inert salt and the temperature drop in the fuel in traversing the heat
exchanger were kept constant at 250°F

With a temperature difference between the two fluid streams of 100°F,
the heat exchanger characteristics were calculsted for each of the two

inert salts, using all combinations of three different shell side pressure

_drops three different tube side pressure drops, and two different tube

dismeters. The results are given in Table 5. For one of the tube sizes,

the effects of changing the temperature difference between the fluid

' streams to 125 and 150°F were then investigated for the same set of pres-
'sure drops and inert salts used previously. Table 6 summarizes the re-

sults from this set of calculations The input parameter variations used

in this study are summarized in Table 7.

The principal results of the parametric calculations are summarized
in the series of curVes_presented in Figs. 4 through 9. Figures 4 through
6 show the effects of pressure drop, tube size, and inert salt on the num-
ber of tubes, the'tuberlength, and the heat exchanger fuel inventory for
a temperature difference of 100°F between the'fuel and inert salt. Fig-

ures 7 through 9 show the;effects on the same dependent variables of

changes in pressure drop and temperature difference between the two fluids

for each of the two inert salts, with a tube OD of 5/16 in.

Examination of Fig. 4 reveals that, if one decreases tube OD from 3/8
to 5/16 in., the nuﬂber:orltubes in the bundle increases by approximately
40% for either inert salt"all other things beingrequsl' It can be seen

that changes in the tube side, or inert salt, pressure drop are much more

effective in reducing the number of tubes in the bundle than the corre-

sponding change in the shell 51de, or fuel pressure drop A change in

the salt pressure drop from 100 to 200 psi reduces the number of tubes by
mfapprox1mately 25%, whereas the seme change in the fuel pressure drop pro-
~duces a reduction of. only about 5% For a typical set of conditions,
r'changing the inert salt from NaBFz to Flinak produces a reduction in the
"upnuMber of tubes by approximately 10%. '

For the same set of changes, Fig. 5 shows the resulting effects on

“tube length. Reducing the;tube 0D to 5/16 in. yields, for elther inert

salt and for a'givenﬂsetﬂOffpréssure_drops,-a reduction in the tube length

of approximately 20%Q' As before, an increase in fuel pressure drop pro-

duces a reduction in the dependent variable, in this case, about 10% in

the length. We note, however, that an increase in salt pressure drop has &hﬁj
the opposite effect, a doubling of the pressure’ drop yleldlng nearly 25%
increase in the tube length. Wlth all other condltions fixed, a change of
inert salt from NaBF, to Fllnak gives a reduction in tube length of about
104. | .
} The heat exchanger fuel inventory, a dependent variable of major in-
terest, is shown in Fig. 6. For a giveh set of conditions, the prescribed
reduction in tube OD yields a corresponding reduétion in fuel'volume of
about 25%. 'Ihcreasing the fuel pressure drop, as.before,iyields a substan-
: tial-savings in fuel invéntory of nearly 30%. ‘In cOntraét, hqﬁever, in-
creasing the salt pressure:drop frdﬁ 100 fo 200 psi produces an increase
in fuel volume of about 20%. Replacing the inert salt in the secondary
circuit with Flinsk reduces the heat exchanger fuel inventory by about 20%.

Figures 7 through 9 are intended, primarily, to show the‘effects:of
increasing the température'difference between the two fluid streams, The
tube diameter used is the smaller one, 5/16 in. Figure 7 shows that in-
creasing the temperature difference from 100 to 125°F yields a decrease
~ in the number of tubes of approximately 10%. ;A further increase in the
temperature difference to 150°F yieldé only an additional 5%_reduction,
giving an overall reduction in the number of tubés of approximately 15%
from the 100°F temperature difference reference condition. For the same
changes in temperature difference between thé_two fluids, one observes
from Fig. 8 that the corresponding reductions in tube length are 15 and
30%, respectively. Finally, as can be seen'frdm‘Fig. 9, majorISavings
in fuel inventory can be effected if the temperature difference between
the salt étreams can be increased. Increasing the difference from 100 to
125°F results in a 25% reduction in fuel inventory éhd,a-l50°F_différénce
yields an overall reduction of 40% in the fuel salt volume. |

As discussed earlier, a temperature difference of 125°F would probably
pose'no problems with thermal stresées, but a temperature'difference 6f
150°F might give trouble and would require exténsire proof testing because
it is difficult to evaluate precisely socme of the modes of failure that
might prove important. | ,

used to make rough estimates of the effects on the number of tubes, the

tube length, and the foel volume of arbitrary combinations of changes in

. the listed parameters. For example, if we were, simultaneously, to re-

duce tube OD from 3/8 in., to 5/16 in. and raise the temperature dif-

ference from lOO°F to 150°F the relative number of tubes would be ap-
j prox1mated by

(1. ud)(o 85) = 1.19

the relatlve tube length would be
(o 80)(0 70) = 0.56

- and the relatlve fuel volume would be

(0.75)(0.60) = 0.45

Actually, some of the effects_are-interrelated in such a wey that taking

advantage of one effect may'redUCe'the effect of another, hence it is

" best to use the charts of Flgs. 4 to 9 when estimating the ‘combined

effects of several s1multaneous changes. If these are not applicable,

- new calculations can be made using the program appended at the end of

this report.

From the equatlone in the analy31s sectlon of this report it can

_be_Shown that the pumping power in either fluid circuit, for & given
" heat load and fluid tempereturerchange3 depends only on the salt pro-

perties, the temperaturejchange3 and the pressure drop in that circuit.
Then, for a given fuel salt-and ‘temperature change, the ratio of the
total heat exchanger pumplng powers for two dlfferent 1nert salts de-
pends only on the ratlo of the inert salt pressure drop to the fuel

- CHOICE OF INERT SALT

In recent'years sodium fluoroborate has been the favored candidate
for use as the inert,salt in the intermediate heat transfer fluid system'
of the MSER. However, the writers felt that heat transfer considerations
make it worthwhile to review the possible advantages and disadvantages of
another candidate, Flinak, an inert salt that was employed in many tests
carried out under the ANP program .

Materialsrédmpatibility Considerations

The mass transfer and corrosion problems associated with the use of
both Flinek and fluorcborate salt were discussed at some length with
J. H. DeVan who kindly provided most of the material presented'here. The

:materials compatibility tests cited in this section are best understood if

considered in historical perspective It should be remembered that under

the ANP program some difficulties with corrosion and mass transfer were

. Observed in the Inconel loops operated_with fluoride salts, particularly

those containing UF;. As a consequence, a series of alloys was tested to
develop something having better corrosion resistance'than Incon€l, Around
40 individual thermal convection 1loops were built of di fferent nickel-

“molybdenum alloys containing various additions of titanium, aluninum,

chromium, niobium, vanadium, and iron. These loops were tested at 815°C
for periods of time ranging from 500 to 1000 hr. All of the loops except

" those containing large amounts of titanium and aluminum were essentially
unaffected by the fuel salt - The development of INOR-8 and ‘Hastelloy-N

was an outgrowth"of'this work, which is reported in Refs. 9 through 16.

_ Unfortunately, no recentftests'have been run with Flinsk in the latest

andamost_promising alloy,dHastelloyéN,_but it is belieVed'that the results

1of such tests would be'more'favorable than any of the earlier work because

of improved techniques for purifying the salt and loading it in the loop.
Note also that Hastelloy-N should be more corrosion resistant than the

thHastelloy-B and elimination of the UF, (added to the Flinak in the ther-
" mal convection loop tests) should reduce the tendency of the salt to at-

tack the structural material.
 

30

The results of tests with thermal convection and forced convection
loops both with Flinak and with fluoroborate salt are summarized in Table 8.
Note +that three of the Flinak foreed convection 1oops'were operated at
over 1700°F with a temperature drop in the salt circuit rangihg from 365
to 450°F, a very severe combination of conditions, While the first of
these showed some tendency to form subsurface voids as a result of solid
state diffusion and selective leaching of iron from the alloy, this effect
was not noticable in the other two loops.

The test experience with fluoroborate salt was discussed with
J. W. Koger who supplied the information summarized in the lower portion
of Table 8. The data fall into twormajor.éets. The«first-set was carried
out with the first fluoroborate salt to become availsble.l? This material
contained abeut 2000 ppm of oxygen because this was the highest purity
obtainable with the usual fluoride purification process; evolution of BF;
prevented a further reduction in impurities. (The vapor pressure of. BF,
at 1125°F ig 160 mm whereas the vapor pressure of the Flinak is less than
1 mm at the same temperature.) As a consequence of the high concentration
of impurities in the first batch of fluorcborate salt, the Croloy 9 Cr-l
Mo loop was attacked very rapidly so that operation had to be terminated
after about 1400 hr (Ref. 17). The Hastelloy-N loop, however, was only
lightly attacked — at a rate equivalent to about 2 mils/yr — but the cold
leg began to plug with Na3CeFg so that operation was“terminated at the.end
of 10,000 hr (Ref. 17). |

The second series of tests was run with a more highly purified fluoro-
borate salt having a nominal contamination level of 500 ppm of oxygen, 18
Three of these loops have been operated for over 20,000 hr with no apparent
signs of plug formation or other serious i1l effects.l?

Melting Poii.nﬂl:.f

In the design and operation of any high-temperature liquid system it
is always advantageous to reduce the melting point of the fluid employed
in order to ease the problems of preheatlng, filling, and draining the sys-
tem. Further, if the system is to include a steam generator, it would be
highly desirable to be able to make use of a molten salt whose melting

point is below the critical temperature for steam, that is, 706°F. One
of the outstanding advantages of the fluoroborate salt is that its melting
point is 725°F, only sbout 20°F above the critical temperature for water,
Flinak, on the other hand, has a melting point of 876°F, 170°F above the
critical temperature. The temperature difference is so largemfor the
latter that thermal stress problems under steam—generator.startup condi-

~ tions would be severe in heat,exchengers of conventionel‘design. Fertun-
‘ately, the reentry tube steam generator proposed in a coﬁpaniqn report2°
‘makes use of'a steam blanket between the boiling‘water‘and;the molten salt
sO that a large temperature difference between the two prdbably can be
accommodated without difficulties with salt freezing, heat transfer in-
stabilities associated with film boiling, or severe thermal stresses.

This favorable set of cosditioﬁs in the steam generator shOuldrhold over
the whole range of conditions from zero to full power including transients
and off-design operating conditions. As a conseguence, the difference in
melting point is not a controlling consideration in the use of fluoroborate

salt rather than Flinak from the steam generator standpoint.

Ieakage Problems

 

ORNL experience with high-temperature liquid systems has shown that,
while the probability of small leaks between systems can be kept very loﬁ,
'it is sot‘possible to assure that a small leak will never occur in a heat
exchanger. Thus it becomes important to cheose the fluids in systems
coupled by a heat exchanger so that a small leak from either system into
the other will not lead to a rapidly progressing failure or to a mess that
cannot be cleaned up readily. For example, in the ANP systems it was .
found that leakage of NaK into systems containing a fuel-bearing salt or
vice versa led to the formation of deposits that are highly 1nsoluble |
in either water or the molten salts, and hence could not be flushed from
the system in which they formed. Fortunately, it appears that either the
‘flﬁoroborate salt or the Flinak would beqcompatible with either the fuel
salt or the steam in this respect. Contamination of the erlrsalt by sub-
stantial quantities of either boron or natural lithium would pose problems,

the ©Li being much more seriocus. -

;Off—Gas Problems

 

In any pfactical system it is always necessary to have one or more
gas lines coupled to the gas space over the liquid in the expansion
tank., A varieﬁy of troubles has been experienced with material distil-~
ling off into these gas llnes, particularly in systems in which the
vapor pressure of the salt has been appreciable. The limited experlence
available to date with 92 NaRF, -8 NaF (which has a vapor pressure of
160 mm at 1125°F) indicates.that the problems posed by this material as
a consequence of the'evoiation of BFs are manageable, but_do require
care in the design and.operation of the system. The vapor pressure of

Flinak is so low that it has never given trouble of this sort.

Heat Transfer Performance

 'The physical propersies_of the molten salt used in the intermediate
fluid circuit affect not only the size and cost of the intermediate heat
exchanger‘and‘the boiler,,but they-also-affect the pumping power,_the
size of the piping, snd,'as'noted~above, the‘fuel inventory. The
physical properties of Flinek make it clearly superior to the fluoro- -
borate salt as a heat trensfer and heat transport fluid, the difference

running from 20 to 25% in favor of Flinak in ell of these items.

Tritium Leakage

Tritium generated 1n Fllnak by delayed neutrons released from the

’,fuel in the 1ntermed1ate heat exchanger would diffuse into the steam

system and thus would 1ntroduce hazards problems. The problems are

'essentlally s1milar to those posed by ‘tritium generatlon in the fuel
- salt, but it appears that they can be handled more readlly if fluoro-
L borate is employed rather than Fllnak.

APPENDIX A

Solution of the Heat Exchanger Equations

This appendix gives details of the elimination process involved in
going from the equation set, Eqs. 12 through 22, to the single equation in
tube-side mass flow, Eq. 23. We begin by using Egs. 12 and 22 of the text

to eliminate the shell-side flow area from the set, giving

C,
GND = o—m0 ., : (A-1)

We next eliminate the shell-side heat transfer coefficient between Eqs. 14
and 17 and the tube-side heat transfer coefficient between Egs. 15 and 18

to give
[1-S2y 524831 Ss o _ 2 | (ac2)
s B T8 Cg’ |
| o
1-T, T s | ]
L NDtBATt =5 (A-3)

By combining Eqs. 16 and 19 with Egs. A-2 and A-3 the three temperature
differences through the two fluid films and the tube wall may be eliminated

at one fell swoop to give

c .

The number of tubes, N, may be eliminated between Eqs. 13 and A-1 to give

A rewriting of Eq. 21 yields an expression for the tube length,_L,
L= oG5 2, ' , (A-8)

which may then be used to eliminate tube length from Eqs. 20 and A-6,

giving

APPENDIX C

SAMPLE COMPUTER PROGRAM INPUT AND OUTPUT -

This Appendix contains information on the‘preparationVOf input for -
the computer program described in Appendix B. A suggested input form, com-
pleted, and the corresponding paper tapeiinformation are shown, followed
by a sample printout from a cdmputer run. B |

Table C-1 shows a suggested input form for HEATXE,with-data entered
for two sample cases. Note that the given units are ndt completely con~
sistent but are specified for convenience. Conversibn to a'éonsiStent
set is performed internally by the program. :

For each item specified in the column headed "DAT(I)", the correspond-
ing "I" must be given. Also, the pairsrof input'numbers specified must
agree with the corresponding number at the top of the form. Note that for
the first case a complete set of input (the first 19 items) must be given.
The initial case number need not be specified, in which case the program
will start with "one", incrémenting by unity for each sucéeeding'case.

For all cases after the first, only those items differing from the
immediately preceding case need'bé changed. Note that if item 20, "Case
Number", is specified, the normal sequence of consecutive case nunmbers
is interrupted, continuing with the new value.

A normal termination of the computer run is obtained by specifying
"NIN", the pairs of input numbers, to be zero or negative. If "NIN" is
omitted, inadvertently or otherwise, an abnormal termination will occur,
with an error message that may be disregarded. |

Table C-2 is a printout of a paper tape prepared from the specificé—
tions of Table C-1. The line numbers shown are not essehtial; the exist-
ing program ends at line T05, so that any greater line number will suffice
for starting the tape. It is suggested that an initial line number of
roughly 800 or greater be used for input to allow for possible program
eXpansion.

The input is free-form, i.e., the numbers ﬁay be typed in any con-
venient form (note the mixture of exponential, fixed-point, and integer

forms) with as many or as few numbers per line as convenient. It may be
