C. W. Kee and L. E. McNeese

ABSTRACT

This report describes the machine solution of a
large number (v 52,000) of simultaneous linear algebraic
equations in which the unknowns are the concentrations
of nuclides in the fuel salt of a fluid-fueled reactor
(MSBR) having a continuous fuel processing plant. Most
of the equations define concentrations at various points
in the processing plant. The code allows as input a
generalized description of a processing plant flowsheet;
it also performs the iterative adjustment of flowsheet
parameters for determination of concentrations throughout
the flowsheet, and the associated effect of the specified
processing mode on the overall reactor operation,

 

1. INTRODUCTION

In a reactor such as a Molten~Salt Breeder Reactor for which contin-
uous processing is planned, the ability to compare alternate proceésing
methods is essential in determining the effect of small changes in proces-
sing method on the steady-state operation of a reactor and processing plant.
Because of the degree of interaction between the reactor performance and
that of the processing plant, it is necessary to consider the reactor and
the processing system simultaneously. The short cooling times resulting
from continuous processing cause appreciable decay of nuclides in the
processing system and result in high decay heating rates and time-dependent
chemical compositions. Most processing plant flowsheets of interest, when

coupled closely with a reactor, produce numerous feedback streams that
complicate material balance calculations and lead to accumulation of
materials over long time periods. To obtain an accurate representation
of the performance of the reactor and processing plant in such cases,

a flowsheet must be represented in detail, and a larger number of
nuclides than considered previously must be taken into account.

Computer programs have been developed and are discussed that allow
a processing plant and the associated reactor to be represented in such
a manner that the programs can be used independently to represent either
the reactor or processing plant in detail or in combination to obtain a
detailed repregentation of the reactor and processing plant system.
Although each code solves a large system of simultaneous linear algebraic
equations, because of the different characteristics of the two systems,
different methods of solution are used; both methods were adapted for
use with sparse matrices. The reactor code uses a Gauss-Seidel iteration
to solve approximately 750 equations. The processing plant code solves
approximately 52,500 equations. However, a special ordering scheme allows
a direct solution in which the equations are considered in blocks of 70
equations each.

The calculations are carried out in an iterative manner between the
reactor and the processing plant for determination of flowsheet parameters.
These parameters include the molar density of phases in each holdup vol-
ume and the distribution coefficients for each mass transfer operation
in the flowsheet; this feature allows the simulation of complex steps
in a flowsheet by using either an equilibrium or first-order rate

mechanism.
Sections 2 through 4 of this report discuss the general problem
and the set of equations employed in its solution, the method used for
solution of the equations, and the extensions of the code to similar
problems. The appendixes essentially form a user's manual and include
a description of the subroutines, the input, and the output from both
the reactor and processing plant codes. A code listing is available

from the authors.

2. EQUATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The multiregion processing plant code is based on a model in which
a MSBR and the associated processing plant are represented by separate
regions of uniform composition; allowance is made for continuous flow
between regions, radioactive decay of materials in each region, and trans-
fer of materials between regions in order to represent common mass transfer
effects. Allowance is also made for fission and neutron capture reactions
in regions representing the reactor. The equations which describe regions
in the processing plant are similar to those for the reactor; howeﬁer, the
reactor is represented by a separate code, MATADOR,2 which receives input
from a single region of the processing plant (the region from which proc-
essed salt is returned to the reactor). The equations for the processing
plant are described separately from those for the reactor to accommodate

the different assumptions that are required.
2.1 Model for the Reactor

A previously developed computer program, MATADOR, is used for cal-
culation of the concentrations of nuclides in the primary circuit of a
MSBR under steady-state conditions in which fuel salt is continuously
circulated between the reactor and a processing system. As such, the pro-
gram serves as a subroutine that calculates the input for the processing
plant program (in the form of concentrations and flow rate of the salt to
be processed) based on output from the processing plant (in the form of
concentrations and flow rate of the processed salt that is returned to
the reactor). From the standpoint of the processing plant program, the
reactor is treated as a single region; however, the reactor program treats
the reactor as a multiregion system. The equations permit the use of
terms which are not necessary for every region; for example, flow of
material between any two regions can be specified, but this seldom occurs.
The equations have been described previously,2 although much of that
description is repeated here.

The accumulation rate of species i in the fuel salt in the reactor
is the input rate of species i by feed, fission, radiocactive decay, and
neutron capture in the fuel salt, graphite, and circulating bubbles minus
the disappearance rate of species i due to radioactive decay, neutron
capture, deposition on exchanger surfaces, and chemical processing. At
steady state, this rate of accumulation is‘zero, so that:

0 = E:(Yeij Aj + ¢ vcfij Gj + Ag gij + Abhij + Sij + ¢ chijgf%)cj

Ui = average neutron-capture cross section of species 1, cm ,
Ufi = gaverage fission cross section of species i, cm ,
-2 ~1
¢ = average neutron flux, cm = sec .

Thus, for I nuclides, this equation is a system of I simultaneous alge-
braic equations and I unknowns. Two other sets of I equations and I
unknowns are considered by: (1) allowing for a volume of gas bubbles and
a holdup for materials plated out in the reactor flux, and (2) allowing
a region in which the evolving gas bubbles and the materials plated out
outside the reactor core are held in contact with fuel salt so that sol-
uble decay products may be returned to the reactor.

All three sets of I equations are solved by the Gauss—Seidel
successive substitution algorithm, with iteration occurring over each
of the successive sets of I equations. Because of the size of the
diagonal terms, the system of equations converges rapidly. Direct sol-
utions were not used because of the storage required for remembering a
coefficient matrix.

The treatment of diffusion of noble gases into and decay products
out of the graphite uses a model developed by Kedl and Houtzeel.3 This
model assumes that the graphite moderator is replaced by semi-infinite
solid cylinders with the same surface-~to-volume ratio, and that the
graphite is coated with a low permeability material to a depth of 1 mil.
Diffusion of noble gases into the graphite occurs through a liquid film
and the coating, and is simulated by a lumped resistance model. The
model developed for the migration of noble gases and noble metals to
circulating helium bubbles is an extension of the model proposed by Kedl

and Houtzeel.3 Both of these models are described in ref. 2.
Once the set of concentrations is obtained, it is possible to cal~
culate heat generation rates, fission product poisoning, production rates
of the materials in the reactor, inventory in moles of the material in
the reactor, the uranium mole fraction, and the breeding ratio. The
breeding ratio is calculated by assuming that it varies linearly with
small changes in the fission product poisoning. Thus, the breeding ratio
is determined from the difference between the reference fission product
poisoning (from R.OD4 calculations) and the calculated fission product
poisoning.

In calculating the fission product poisoning, the poisoning from
135Xe is excluded because it was also excluded in the reactor design code,
ROD, where it was always assumed to be one-half of 1Z. While MATADOR
calculations of fission product poisoning include absorptions by the
noble gases and noble metals in the gas bubbles, noble metals plated
onto surfaces outside the reactor core are not assumed to absorb neutrons.
Neptunium absorptions are included, because the reference fission product
poisoning used by ROD from previous calculations included the neptunium

absorptions with fission product poisoning.
2.2 Model for the Processing Plant

The processing plant code calculates steady-state concentrations
based on material balance equations, and constant reactor effluent concen-
trations as determined by the last MATADOR calculation. The multiregion
code assumes that the processing plant is composed of a number of regions
(or holdup volumes) connected by flowing streams. A region consists of

a well-mixed volume containing one or two phases in equilibrium. The
equilibrium is specified by a proportionality constant that varies with
atomic number and may be changed between successive flowsheet calcula-
tions. Any two regions may be linked by flowing streams or by rate
expressions, and each region may have feeds or discards. (These are

streams which do not connect two regions in the plant.)
2.2,1 Material balance equations

The rate of accumulation of nuclide i in a region (0 at steady
state) is the rate of appearance of 1 in the region from feed streams,
from flowing streams from other regions, from mass transfer from other
regions, and from production of other nuclides by radiocactive decay
minus the rate of disappearance of i from the region by flow out, by
mass transfer to other regions, and by radioactive decay. Thus, at

steady state in region n:

Hence, there is one equation and one unknown for each nuclide in each

region. There are 52,500 equations for 750 nuclides in 70 regions.

Because of the number of equations and the number and size of recycle

streams present in a flowsheet, the Gauss-Seidel iteration is too time

consuming.

Since neutron captures are neglected, it is possible to

arrange the nuclides so that each nuclide precedes all of its decay

daughters.

For N regions, there is one set of N equations with N unknowns
10

for each nuclide. By arranging the nuclides in the proper order and
solving each set of equations, a direct solution for the entire set of
equations is obtained. Solutions in the processing plant are alternated
with calls to MATADOR to obtain a converged solution for a reactor
coupled with continuous processing.

The program used has been designed to solve a large system of
equations in which the nontriangular coefficient matrix may be expressed
as a lower triangular coefficient matrix whose elements are matrices.
Each matrix on the diagonal is solved directly, with substitutions being
made for unknowns that were calculated previously. In this case, the

lower triangular matrix has off-diagonal terms in row i and column j of

the form:

The resulting system of equations, when used with a constant vector

indicating feed streams, is the set of Egs. (2).
2.2.2 Mass transfer coefficients

Three models were used for mass transfer between liquid and gas
phases. TFor transfer of noble gases to gas bubbles, the overall liquid
mass transfer coefficient was estimated from the Hughmark correlation
given by Schaftlein and R.ussell.5 This is substituted into the relation
for mass transfer:

N; = Kop2gley — Heg) = Kypagey — KopAgh ¢,
where

bubble surface area, cmz,

o

H = Henry's law constant, moles/cc (liq) per mole/cc (gas),
Ky = overall liquid mass transfer coefficient, cm/sec,
Ni = rate of mass transfer, moles/sec,

cy and c, = concentrations in liquid and gas, moles/cc.

This equation is broken into two contributions to matrix terms analogous

to a flow rate so that:

(kja)) m = Koo 4B

(kia)m,n = KOL AB H = H(kia)n,m’

where region n is the liquid phase, and region m the gas phase.

In addition to this transfer, the rate of mass transfer at the
surface between the liquid and cover gas must also be considered. For
volatile components, the mass transfer resistance is assumed to be across

a liquid film of thickness XR:
12

 

N, = DQAS (c, - Hc ) = DQAg c, — DQAS He |, (5)
L X % 8 X ¢ X g
% 2 2
where
DQ = diffusivity in liquid, cmz/sec,
2
A.S = surface area, cm ;
thus,

(kia)n m (DQAS)/XR

(kia)m,n (DRAS H)/XQ = H(kia)n,m . (6)

The same model is used to describe transfer of nonvolatile decay products
of volatile fission products across a gas film of thickness Xg; however,
since the transfer from liquid to gas is zero, there is only one term.
All of these terms must be added to obtain the matrix coefficients that
are used.

In both models the design criterion is based on some consideration
other than the removal of volatile nuclides. TFor example, the gas rate
might be based on the amount of reductant necessary for a hydrofluorinator
or a hydrogen-sparged vessel, or on the amount of argon needed for a level
probe in a surge tank. In a fluorinator, however, the design is chosen
to achieve a specified performance such as per cent removal of uranium.
For zero inlet concentration in the gas, a material balance gives:

F.c. =F.c.+ F c = PRFLCI + FLCL,

or

cp = (1 - PR) cyi Cp = L . (7)
13

where
FL’FG = flow rates in liquid and gas, cc/sec,
CIfCL’CG = concentrations in inlet liquid, outlet liquid, and
outlet gas, moles/cc,
P = percent removal;

R

thus, the transfer across the interface is P_ F. c Substituting for

R L T

CI:

In the simulation, FL was included as a parameter independent of the
element, and PR/(l - PR) was listed as a constant that depended on the

element number.
3. NUMERICAL METHODS EMPLOYED
3.1 Solution of Reactor Material Balance Equations

The number of equations to be solved by the reactor code is equal
to the number of nuclides, ®739, The coupling of the equations used for
the salt in the drain tank with those used for the gas bubbles adds two
additional sets of the same number of equations. The direct solution
of such a set of equations would require a method that would take advan-
tage of sparseness and might need only limited pivoting to minimize f£ill.
These problems are eliminated by the use of an iterative solution, pro-
viding the solution is obtained in a reasonable number of iterations.

The number of iterations has always been less than 30.
14

3.2 Solution of the Processing Plant Material Balance Equations

The number of equations and unknowns for a flowsheet of 70 regions
and a nuclear library of 739 nuclides is about 52,000. Storage of the
coefficient matrix of this system of equations is completely impractical,
and storage of even the nonzero terms could easily exceed the storage
capacity of machines available; therefore, a direct Gauss reduction
could not be used. Various approaches were made by using a Gauss-Seidel
iteration. The best method was found to be a series of solutions for
all nuclide concentrations in the flowsheet:; the nuclides were considered
one at a time so that some nuclides required only a few iterations. Even
with the rearrangement of nuclides, which necessitated only one solution
for each species, the time requirements were still excessive; this was
because the diagonal element of the coefficient matrices was comparable
in magnitude to the off-diagonal terms, except for nuclides with short
half-lives.

For each successive nuclide, a 70 by 70 matrix was solved to obtain
the concentration of that nuclide in each of 70 regions. The time
requirement for a direct solution for all concentrations in the processing
plant by this method was quite reasonable — less than a minute for the
IBM 360/91. In addition, the memory requirements were essentially the
same as those for the iteration technique. The storage of the solution
vector is a significant fraction of the storage requirement, and for
larger flowsheets (the IBM 360/91 at ORNL was able to handle 250 regions)

the solution vector uses most of the storage.
15

3.3 TIteration with Reactor Code

The existence of this reasonably rapid solution for the processing
plant calculation enabled iterations with the MATADOR routine which
simulated the reactor performance. MATADOR was coupled to the processing
plant calculation by using removal times defined as the reactor inventory
of a species divided by its net removal rate by chemical processing.
Fairly rapid convergence of concentrations was achieved for most nuclides
if the parameters that passed between routines were averaged with their
previous values to provide damping. All concentrations converged within
20 iterations. However, the variation of more parameters between itera-
tions, and the consideration of more difficult flowsheets required
improvement to the code. The use of reactor inlet concentrations rather
than removal times resulted in comparable performance, but permitted a
different set of nuclides to converge rapidly. Hence, the concentrations
in the stream returning to the reactor can be described as the sum of
the amount remaining after processing and the amount due to production
in the processing plant.

At the same time the solution is found for the processing plant
concentrations, a solution is also found for the first derivative of
the reactor inlet concentration with respect to the outlet concentra-
tion of the same nuclide. This is possible because the same coefficient
matrix is used for both sets of equations. The constant vector in the
solution for the derivative is a vector with unit concentration of each
nuclide in the reactor and no terms for production by decay. Hence,

with little increase in calculational effort and complexity, provision
16

can be made for small changes in concentration to allow the reactor

code to predict the processing plant performance. In addition, an even
greater saving of time is made by considering only those nuclides whose
concentrations are slowly converging, and by periodically reconsidering

all nuclides.

3.4 Calculation of Molar Volumes

The steady-state performance of a processing plant depends on the
rates of decay and, therefore, the molar inventories of radioactive
nuclides throughout the processing plant. It is thus necessary for the
molar inventories and molar volumes to be consistent with the volumes
specified. It is also necessary to know the ratio of the molar volumes
of the two phases in certain regions for use as a conversion factor to
convert the distribution coefficients from ratios of mole fraction to
the ratio of concentrations in moles per cubic centimeter. This problem
is not alleviated by use of molar flow rates and mole fractions, because
the parameters must be such that the mole fractions add up to 1.0,

Between iterations, each flow rate from a region is expressed as
a fraction of the total flow from that region. The molar volume of each
stream for which a molar volume correction is to be made is determined
by assuming additive molar volumes. The corrected flow rate is given
by the product of this molar volume; the molar flow rate and the ratio
of molar volumes for regions containing salt and bismuth provides a

conversion factor for the distribution coefficients.
17

3.5 Correction of Distribution Coefficients

For a given region n, the set of concentrations of that region is
the solution of:
[ S + Aivs,n + Ki,n(FB + AiVB,n{}Ci,n = § Ajeij(vs,n + K'j,nVB,n)cj,n
+ (NPUT), (9)

where

FS = L FSn,m + Dn’ and

(INPUT)i 0 = total input of nuclide i to region n from feeds or other
b
regions.

From a table of valences, it is possible to calculate an equivalent
density in the second phase in equivalents per cubic centimeter. It is
this number which must remain constant through any series of reductive
extraction operations to satisfy the condition of an equivalent balance.
The equivalent density, Eo’ in the second phase that enters the region
may be a calculated variable or an input variable. In either case, the
variable DLi = KLi,n must be determined so that

E-E =0,

where

E=LE N = E(VAL)i K = total number of equivalents per

Some provision must also be made for the failure of this scheme to converge.
The calculation procedure examines the sign of E - EO in order to contin-
uously specify upper and lower bounds for DLi' Any new DLi value that

is outside this interval is replaced with the value at the midpoint of

the interval. This value of DLi might tend to overcorrect in a flowsheet,
20

especially if these regions are in series. As a means of providing a
damping effect, the value returned for the next iteration is a weighted

average of this value and the old wvalue.

3.6 Investigation of Faster Solution Methods

When flowsheet parameters such as flow rates (i.e., molar volume)
and distribution constants are not changed between iterations, the solu-
tion for all but the first iteration can be speeded up. The solution
by reduction and back substitution is a series of row operations on an
augmented matrix; much of the calculational time is used to perform
operations on the coefficient matrix. For double precision calculations,
the information required for making the necessary row operation on only
the constant vector is a double precision constant and two indexes which
indicate the rows involved. This information can be stored easily in
the eliminated matrix positions during the first iteration so that they
may be used on subsequent iterations. The calculations after the first
iteration are manipulations performed on a vector rather than operations
on a matrix; in addition, the matrix, which is not required, need not
be determined in these subsequent iterations.

Before the introduction of changing flowsheet parameters, the
number of row operations required for a 50 by 50 flowsheet matrix was
determined. Between 200 and 280 row operations were performed with
about 807% of the calculational time required for operations on the
coefficient matrix. The number of constants needed for all nuclides
requires more memory than is available as fast memory; however, because
the constants need only be accessed sequentially, storage on a direct

access device is sufficient, and only a small buffer space is required,
21

4, LIMITATIONS AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATTIONS

4,1 Limitations of Steady State Calculation

A number of problems arise from the consideration of a steady state
process (i.e., flowsheet steps that are designed to be intermittent). A
good example is a waste tank that is slowly filled with waste salt over
a period of about 1 year, after which the salt is held up for a decay
period and fluorinated for uranium recovery. In addition, a number of
materials are accumulated over the lifetime of a reactor. As a result,
some materials must be removed by a discard stream so that the residence
time is about one reactor lifetime if the nuclides (e.g., lead) are to
be discarded.

It is also desirable to treat some nuclides (e.g., transuranium
isotopes) in a steady state concentration, even though steady state
requires several reactor lifetimes to achieve. Although the code makes
a steady-state material balance calculation, the convergence is slowed
down by this kind of calculation, because the code requires time to
permit the concentrations of this material to build up during successive
iterations.

A steady state calculation for processing plants with near total
recycle of any species requires user caution. The existence of any
material that cannot be removed from some region or group of regions
causes the system of equations to be singular, since the concentration
of this material in those regions is undefined. Iterations with the
reactor code do not alter the concentrations of major salt components,
and provision is made in the processing plant code for the concentration

of any nuclide to be defined by the input at any point.
22

4,2 System of Units

In the system of units that was used, the code calculated concen-
trations in moles per cubic centimeter by using flow rates in cubic
centimeters per second, volumes in cubic centimeters, etc.; however,
this is not necessarily implied by the equations, since they are just
as valid in other systems of units (the nuclear library uses seconds
as the unit of time). The most logical alternate set of units is the
description of volume in moles, rates in moles per second, etc., which
results in concentrations in mole fraction. Some calculations might
be changed by the user who prefers this system of units. For example,
the calculation of mole fractions is redundant and might be replaced
by the calculation of concentrations in moles per cubic centimeter.

The greatest alteration required in such a change of units is the
replacement of the output headings. By such label changes, it would
be possible to treat any system of equations of this form.
4,3 Description of Particular Items Using
Mass Transfer Coefficients

In most simulations, the use of mass transfer coefficients was
limited to gas—liquid contacts requiring one region for the gas phase
and one region for the liquid phase containing only one or two liquids.
It was assumed that the noble gas concentrations were small enough so
that no appreciable error would occur by treating the gas bubbles as if
they had the same concentrations as the bulk gas. This is not an essen-
tial assumption, however, since by using more regions, the same case

might be described as having more than one gas region. The bulk gas
23

would be a separate region from the gas bubbles, and the gas bubbles
in separate liquids could easily be separate regions, If the gas con-
centration changes as it rises through the liquid and is not small
rélative to its equilibrium concentration, the gas at wvarious levels
in the liquid would be in différent regions and would represent a
column.

Careful consideration has also been given to simulation of mass
transfer-limited transfer rates as a replacement of equilibrium stages
in a liquid-liquid contactor. For turbulent flow when transfer is lim-
ited by eddy diffusivity, the only difficulty arises in specification
of the distribution coefficients at the interface. This case can be
described by three regions: the bulk liquid phase S, the bulk liquid
phase B, and the interface contact of both phases. The flows between
the interface region and the bulk liquid region are the rates of eddy
transport in each phase. The product of eddy diffusivity and concentra-
tion driving force in each phase is implicitly obtained in two flow rate
terms for each phase in the same manner described in the section on mass
transfer coefficients. 1In this case, the distribution coefficients can
still be determined iteratively by the same technique used for equilib-
rium stages even though the distribution coefficients are not expected

to be the same.
4.4 VUses Requiring Modifications

It is possible to consider flowsheets involving batch processes
that might not be represented by either an equilibrium process or a rate

limited process, because the amount of material transferred between the
24

phases was dependent on the concentrations of other elements as well
(e.g., oxide precipitation). The rate coefficients that are used have
always remained constant, but this is not essential to the code since
iteration is required to converge other parameters in the flowsheet.

By using a reasonable estimate for percent removal (i.e., rate constants)
for various components, a set of concentrations would be obtained.
Subroutine VOLUME would then be used to calculate the proper removal
rates on the basis of these concentrations, and it would modify the rate
constants accordingly for the next iteration. This system for treating
more general processing steps should cause no greater convergence prob-
lem than the iterative determination of distribution parameters described
later.

An alternative to this approach is to provide concentration or feed
rate links to such a subroutine as is done with MATADOR, or even to
replace MATADOR with a routine simulating some section of the flowsheet.
However, the most likely substitution for MATADOR is either a subroutine
that reads and stores entering processing plant concentrations or one
that simulates a different reactor type. In this last case, the reactor
and processing plant need not be linked directly and processing need
not be continuous (i.e., there can be batch replacements of fuel and a
decay period); therefore, the steady state performance of a system of

reactors and processing plants can be obtained.

APPENDIXES
USER'S MANUAL

APPENDIX A: DESCRIPTION OF SUBROUTINES USED

A description of each routine used in the program is given in the
approximate order of use. Sufficient information is available to permit
use of the program and some modification by users. In particular, the
user should be able to utilize the reactor subroutines independently
of the processing plant code by supplying any necessary information and
a main program which calls MATADOR (with the BLOCK DATA routine described

in the processing plant code).

Subroutine MATADOR

MATADOR directs all the reactor calculations. It begins by reading
the input defining the reactor and the variables that will provide an
initial guess for process plant removal rates, Through several calls
to GRAPHT, it sets up the coefficient matrix for nuclear transitions
in the graphite. Whereas this matrix is stored separately from the
corresponding matrix for transitions in the salt, the processing plant
code can use the matrix for decay in the salt, and the matrix for graphite
may be changed between iterations when the code is used iteratively with
ROD.

MATADOR begins by setting up the constant vector and the diagonal
(the inverse of the diagonal elements is calculated to save calculational
time later on) for the calculation of the reactor salt concentrations.
While the variables XIN and DXIN are zero for the first call to MATADOR,
the chemical removal rate of each nuclide is assumed to be proportional
to the reactor concentration. Hence, chemical processing is specified

in the diagonal element.
28

Two additional options are available on subsequent calls. First,
it may be assumed that the flow rate of a nuclide into the reactor (XIN)
is independent of its concentration in the reactor. Second, it may be
assumed that the flow rate of material into the reactor is a linear func-
tion of the reactor concentration. In this case, DXIN and the derivative
of XIN with respect to reactor concentration are nonzero. In considering
chemical processing, it was necessary to allow negative efficiencies to
adequately treat those nuclides produced by decay in the processing
plant that were removed primarily by neutron captures in the reactor.
Accordingly, care is taken to ensure that the diagonal elements do not
approach zero. A message is printed if the diagonal element reaches some
predefined limiting value.

The program obtains a solution for the reactor salt with a first
estimate being made for only the first call to MATADOR. Solutions are
then obtained for the noble gases and noble metals that are in contact
with salt both inside and outside the reactor. Noble gases leaving the
holdup region inside the reactor are sent to the region outside the
reactor. The diagonal elements and the constant vecéors are defined so
that the calculations provide the holdup in moles for noble gases and
noble metals, and the flow rate into the salt in moles per second for
all other materials. The calculation actually assumes that the returning
nuclides are held up for 1 sec during which they may decay or capture
neutrons. In the calculations of the transfer rates from these holdup
volumes to the salt, the three systems of I equations are weakly coupled
and are assumed to converge in three passes. This may not be true for

long holdup times in these phases; therefore, the values are remembered
29

between calls to MATADOR so that each call improves the value of these
transfer rates.

Several output parameters are calculated before calling KEE, which
controls output; these are fission product poisoning per fissile absorp-
tion, nuclide production rates, molar volume, uranium mole fraction, and
breeding ratio. If the input variable KARD is nonzero, punched output
is obtained. 1If KARD is positive, the concentrations are in a format for
input to the CALDR.ON6 code; if KARD is negative, the concentrations are
in a format for input to ORIGEN.2 The ORIGEN input can also be prepared

by the calling program so that a modified ORIGEN code may be used as a

second job step.
Subroutine AMATRX

The main function of AMATIRX is the construction of the matrix A,
which contains decay and capture rates for all transitions between iso-
topes, except fission. The subroutine reads the data in the format
described in the section on input and writes a table summarizing the
nuclear library. Nuclides are identified by the value of 10,000 times
the atomic number plus 10 times the molecular weight (plus 1 for excited
state). It stores the identification of all decay daughters and capture
products in a matrix NPROD with the corresponding production rates in
COEFF. It also stores the parent nuclide identification, NUCL, the total
decay rate, DIS, and the capture cross section, TOCAP, as well as heat
generation rates, the fraction of heat which is gamma energy, fission
product yields, etc. Thermal, resonant, and fast neutron cross sections

are stored so that the program can be used iteratively with ROD by
30

allowing corrections based on the spectral factors determined by ROD to
be made to the cross section data for the next MATADOR calculation.

The program then constructs the vector A (C in this subroutine),
which contains the value of all nonzero production rates, and the cor-
responding vector LOC, which contains the ordinal number of the parent
nuclide, assuming that the daughter nuclides are in the same order of
the NUCLs. These constants are stored in the order of production by
decay, and by thermal, resonant, or fast neutron captures. For each
nuclide there are variables KD, KTH, KRI, and NONO which store the
cumulative number of terms for that nuclide with the sum of all the
NONOs being stored in NON. In these variables only members of a given
group produce nuclides in that group. Similarly, there is a set of
vectors indicating the production rate of fission products from the
fission of actinides. These variables are denoted by F, LOF, KF, and
NOF.

A vector NSTAR is constructed so that for any NUCL with atomic mass
NMASS, atomic number NATNO, and isomeric state (0 or 1) NISOM:

NSTAR = NTEMP + NATNO*10

for positron emitters, and

NSTAR = NTEMP -~ NATNO#*10
for all others, where
NTEMP = NMASS*10000 + 1000 + NISOM.
A vector I0 is constructed which contains the ordinal numbers of all
the nuclides in decreasing order of NSTAR. This is in decreasing order

of atomic mass with the ordinal number of excited state nuclides appearing

before that of the corresponding ground state nuclide. The sequence
31

includes positron emitters with decreasing atomic numbers for a given
atomic mass, followed by other nuclides with increasing atomic numbers.
This sequence includes all nuclides before any of their decay daughters
as long as all decays represent a loss of energy, mass, or reduction in
E + MCZ, rather than a capture of some kind. This sequence is used
later in the processing plant code as the order of calculation.

The variables are dimensioned so that as many as 800 nuclides can
be included, of which as many as 100 may be actinides; in addition,
there may be as many as 1500 production rates of nuclides from other
nuclides by decay or neutron absorption. The nuclear library contains

739 nuclides, 99 actinides, and 1466 production rate terms,
Subroutine GRAPHT (DIS1, CAP1, DIS2,CAP2,COEF¥,N,I,P2,VR,DEP,D1,P1,FLUX2)

The subroutine GRAPHT calculates rate coefficients for fission
product deposition in graphite based on the diffusion model described
in ref. 2, and the variable names are analogous: EN=n, EL=1, ENSQ=n2,
etc. The calculations are made to determine FLUX2, which is returned
to be inserted in a matrix G, and is analogous to the matrix A (described
with AMATRX). This value represents the contribution to the concentra-
tion of species i from diffusion into graphite of species j} (Ag gij’ as
described earlier). The adjusted diagonal matrix element for the parent
isotope (Gj)’ the contribution to poisoning by both parent and daughter
isotopes in the graphite, and the deposition rates of nonvolatile daugh-
ters are also calculated.

GRAPHT also uses the variables in common block GRAFIT that were

read by MATADOR: AREA,VOL,PORTY,FILM,DIFFY,RADIUS, and SOLBTY. These
32

variables have been described in the section on input. The subroutine

requires a subroutine BESI for computing Bessel functions.
Subroutine BESI(X,N,BI,IER)

This is a library routine which computes the Bessel function, BI,
of order N with argument X, where N and X are greater than or equal to

zero. IER is used as an error indication.

IER = meaning

0 = no error

1 = N is negative

2 = X is negative

3 = underflow, BI.LT.1.E-69,BI set to 0.0
4 = overflow, X.GT.170 where X.GT.N

Only Bessel functions of orders 0 and 1 are required by GRAPHT.

Subroutine CHEMPL

The value of the reciprocal of the removal time for the group of
which that nuclide is a member is stored in the variable PR(I) (processing
rate) for each nuclide. On the first call, the routine uses the group
removal times (NTIME) that are used for output purposes and the efficiencies
assumed for each element to calculate a removal time for each element in
the units used for that group of elements. This is written in a table
for output. In addition, on the first call the program adds to the
matrix elements for production of uranium from protactinium an amount
which assumes that all protactinium removed by chemical processing decays

to uranium and is returned to the reactor. A call to another entry point
33

(ENTRY REPAIR) causes these amounts to be subtracted from the proper
matrix elements, thus assuming that the link to the processing plant

routines takes this into account.
Subroutine GAUSS (XEQL,C,D,*)

GAUSS solves the matrix equation:

A(XEQL) = C ,
A "

where A is the coefficient matrix, and reciprocals of the diagonal ele-
ments are given by D. A nonstandard return is made if the system does
not converge within the maximum allowable number of iterations. The
groups of terms included in the coefficient matrix are determined by the

value of the logical variables REGION, and REG2.
Subroutine KEE

Subroutine KEE ensures that subroutine RESULT (described next) is
called if this is the last call to MATADOR as indicated by the logical
variable ILLOG, Subroutine KEE prints the number of calls to MATADOR

and a convergence message, and calls RESULT at specified intervals.
Subroutine RESULT (XEQL)

RESULT prints output tables for a given set of reactor concentra-
tions (XEQL). It first calculates the number of moles of material in the
stream returning to the reactor for use in the calculation of mole frac~-
tion for that stream. It then initializes or calculates other important

variables such as:
34

FISSL = the mass of materials lost due to fission,

FISSN = absorption rate by the five fissionable isotopes,
FISSA = agbsorption rate by fissile isotopes,

DMOLAR = molar density,

TOCAP (IGAS) = the adjusted cross section for noble gases that

reflects the number of absorptions of noble gases
in graphite.

The program calculates the gamma heat rate in the salt, the absorp-
tion rate in the salt normalized to absorptions per fission, the removal
rate due to chemical processing, and the contribution to radiocactivity
in the salt for each of the three groups of nuclides (light elements,
actinides, and fission products). A series of calls to subroutine SORT
is used to identify the 25 most important materials in each category.
Calculations for the fission products are somewhat complicated by the
contribution of nuclides in the circulating bubbles and by the contribu-
tion of nuclides plated onto the reactor surfaces. Once these are printed,
the program prints the totals for removal of fission products and actinides,
the burnup rate of thorium, and a correction factor based on the nuclear
transitions to nuclides not listed in the library. A correction factor
not considered is the amount by which the average mass yield from fission,
as given in the library, fails to match the mass of the fissionable nuclide
less the average number of neutrons emitted. Additional important variables

in this subroutine are:

COMPNG = composition of noble gases,
COMPNM = compositions of noble metals,
HEATNM = heat generation rates of noble metals,
35

COMPBI = composition of materials extracted into bismuth,

COMPRE = composition of rare earths,

COMPF2 = compositions of materials removed from fluorinators,
primarily the halogens,

COMPLB = compositions of materials removed in group 6 by chemical
processing,

SRATE = sum of the removal rate for each nuclide group,

SHEAT = sum of the heat genefation rates in each group, and

SCAPT = sum of the absorption rates in each group.

MAIN Program

The main program controls the processing plant calculations, and
begins by calling MATADOR for setting up the matrix for decay chains.

It then reads the input describing the flowsheet and prints the tables
of input data. Region names are compared with stream origin and des-
tinations to construct vectors which describe these streams by the
ordinal numbers of the region names used. In addition, total flows and
fractional flows are determined. All streams with a destination not in
the list of region names are assumed to be discard streams and are added
to the loss rates. The program calls subroutine EQKN to define the
equilibrium constants to be used.

The program then alternates calls to MATADOR with calculations of
processing plant concentrations. Processing plant concentrations are
calculated for one nuclide at a time in the order defined by IO to
ensure that decay products follow their precursors. The program defines

a coefficient matrix and two constant vectors for each nuclide before
36

calling a subroutine MATQD to solve the two sets of equations represented.
The first constant vector defines the production rates of the nuclide

and results in the list of concentrations. The second vector has its
only nonzero value corresponding to the reactor, and it results in the
solution of the concentrations for the case of no production by decay

in the processing plant; if instructed to do so, it determines the
influence of reactor concentration on the effluent from the processing
plant.

If the input instructions specify averaging between iterations, the
program averages concentrations to and from the reactor, and averages
removal times with their previous values. It also checks for conver-
gence (perhaps an ordered list of the reactor inlet concentrations in
decreasing order of their relative change in the last iteration) and
prints the first 50 in this list. VOLUME is called for possible modifi-
cation of the flowsheet parameters, and a logical vector is defined that
identifies the nuclides that have converged; therefore, they need only
be considered on every tenth iteration.

After the calculations have converged, or the program reaches the
allowed time limit or number of iterations, a deck of punched cards is
prepared. If I2 is greater than zero, the deck includes reactor effluent
concentrations and removal efficiencies for all the nuclides. If I6 is
greater than zero, much of the description of the processing plant is
included. The program then calls OUTO and stops.

BLOCK data. A block data subroutine is used to initialize the
100-element variable ELE to the element symbols, and the variable STA(1)

and STA(2) to blank and "™".
37

Subroutine EQKN

EQKN reads data for distribution constants and assigns values to
the distribution coefficient matrix, EQK. The data are selected for
characterizing a region by matching an input variable (NS) in the data
with the input variable (NSTR) corresponding to the region. For region
REGION(N), the distribution coefficient for the element with atomic
number NZ is EQK((N-1)*100+NZ). TFor NS = 1 or NS = 2 the value of NSTR
is used to choose between two temperatures. If NS = NSTR(N), the calcu-
lation assumes a temperature of 640°C; if NS+20 = NSTR(N), the calculation
assumes a temperature of 550°C. Sufficient data is stored in variables
IAE, AIE, AKE, and BKE to later allow a different calculation for these

distribution coefficients in VOLUME.
Subroutine VOLUME (NLEFT)

On the first call to VOLUME, the input variables are read, each
phase is assigned a starting molar density, and each region is assigned
a ratio of molar densities for use in converting distribution constants
from ratios of mole fraction to ratios of concentrations. Estimates of
molar density are found in the values of XVEST and YVEST for first and
second phases, respectively. The 16 values in each vector correspond to
the values of the two hexadecimal digits of NC which identify the phases
present.

On subsequent calls, VOLUME begins by calculating new values of
XLIB for those regions with NV.LT.0. The entering equivalent density

for a given region is determined by using the tables of valences, and
38

for specifying the equivalent density in that region if the value

supplied on input is less than 0. The equations for concentrations

in the region are then solved for each new intermediate lithium distri-
bution XLI, with the equivalent density and the derivative of equivalent
density with respect to XLI being determined for each solution. Each

new XLI value is then determined by Newton's method, but with XLI confined
to continually readjusting narrowing limits based on the sign of the dif-
ference of equivalent density and the reference value. A logical variable
DECIDE is defined to identify all nuclides that have a significant influence
on the derivative of equivalent balance with respect to XLI. NLEFT is the
number of regions requiring more than one iteration.

The converged values of XLI are stored in XLIB so that new distribu-
tion coefficients can be determined later, just before returning to the
main program. Before this calculation is done, however, the molar volume
is calculated for all phases indicated by the first digit of NC. This
is used to redefine the values for molar density, total flow rate, and
ratios of molar densities for use as a conversion factor for the distri-
bution coefficients.

This subroutine is used to change flowsheet parameters between
iterations. It could easily be modified to adjust other parameters as
well. The most probable adjustable parameter is the rate coefficient
table that would be adjusted to match some arbitrary function of
processing plant concentrations. This is the method considered for
simulating the oxide precipitation flowsheet that involved nonlinear-

ities, nonequilibrium contacts, and batch operations.
39

Subroutine MATQD (A,X,NR,NV,DET ,NA,NX)

MATQD solves a system of linear algebraic equations in double
precision, with coefficient matrix A and constant vector X, and returns
with the solution vector in X. Any number, NV, of systems of equations
with the same coefficient matrix may be solved by including NV constant
vectors,each of which occupies the first NR position in consecutive
segments in X of length NX; thus,

A = the coefficient matrix, where the element in row I and

column J is element number (J-1)#*NA+I.

X = solution vector and constant vector. The position represented

by variable I in the solution set K is (K-1)*NX+I.

NR = number of unknowns.

NV = number of solutions required with the matrix A.

DET = returns with value 0.0 for a singular matrix and a value 1.0

for a nonsingular matrix. Originally, DET was the value of
the determinant of A.

NA = number of elements in A allowed for each column.

NX = number of elements in X allowed for each set of equations.
Variables A, X, and DET are double precision.

MATQD was originally obtained from the ORNL computer library;
however, the solution here involves a sparse matrix. For this reason,
modifications were made to have the subroutine check for zeros before
performing multiplications and divisions in the coefficient matrix. A
vector ISTAR was defined to remember the row numbers of up to 50 rows,

with nonzero elements below the pivot element to be eliminated in a
40

given reduction step. After modification, the routine obtained the
solution in one-fifth the time required previously. This modified ver-
sion has been used to replace the library version in one other instance,

and it achieved a solution in one-third the time required previously.
Subroutine OUTO

OUTO supplies input for the modified ORIGEN7 code used as a second
job step and prints all output tables that supply concentrations or heat
generation rates. It requires the function NOAH, described previously,
for producing alphameric names from nuclide identifications. It also

calls the subroutine OUTL.
Subroutine OUTL (REG, RA, RB, XL, YL, NR)

OUTL searches through the loss rates and prints a summary of the

loss rates from the processing plant, where

REG = list of region names,

RA = 1list of first-phase names,
RB = list of second-phase names,
XL = first-phase loss rates,

YL = second-phase loss rates, and
NR = number of regions.

Miscellaneous Short Routines

Subroutine SORT (X,LABEL,Y,NAME,NX,NY)
SORT makes one pass through the veCtor, Y, and inserts the values

of Y and NAME in the vectors X and LABEL so that the X values are in
41

decreasing order. X and LABEL have dimension NX in subroutine SORT,

while Y and NAME have dimension NY.

Subroutine ZERO(A,B,N)

 

ZERO zeroes the space between address A and B inclusive in units

of N bytes.

Subroutine HALF(A.I)

 

HALF computes the decay constant, A, in units of sec—l from the
half-life A in units denoted by I, where I corresponds to IU in the

nuclear library.

Function NOAH (NUCLI)

This routine constructs a three-word alphameric symbol for an iso-
tope from its six-digit identifying number, NUCLI. The three words
consist of the symbol for the chemical element, the atomic weight, and
either a blank or an '"™M" to designate a ground state or metastable state.

These symbols are used only when printing output tables.

in which they are called. The input description is further divided so
that each type of input card can be identified. The argument list and

fission product yields.
The six~digit identifying numbers are made up so that the highest
order digits give the atomic number, the next three digits give the atomic
mass, and the lowest order digit is 0 for ground state and 1 for excited

state. This is the same system used by the ORIGEN7 code. The next cards

G. INPUT(1),X(1),I=1,4
FORMAT (4 (I5,F10.3))
INPUT = six-digit identifier of nuclide
X = composition in atom fraction or mole fraction.
The materials fed to the reactor are 7Li, 9Be, 232Th, and 19F.

The molar feed raté is FLOW1 * X(I) in g-atom/sec.

FORMAT (40(12))

NP(I) = the group number for element with atomic number I.
NZ(1),EFF(I),I=1,8

FORMAT (8(I3,F7.4))

EFF = the removal efficiency of the element with atomic number NZ.

Only those elements with a removal efficiency different from 1.0 need be

specified. As many cards as necessary may be used with input of EFFs,

stopping when NZ=0 is encountered.

THETA = six values,
FORMAT (8F10. 3)
THETA(1) = holdup time of group 1 elements (noble gases) in the

circulating gas bubbles.

THETA(2) = holdup of group 2 elements (noble metals) deposited
in the reactor core,
THETA(3) = holdup of group 3 elements (seminoble metals) deposited

in the reactor core,
47

THETA(4) = holdup of group 1 elements in contact with salt
outside the flux of the reactor. The gas is assumed
to be the effluent of gases from the reactor.

THETA(5) ,THETA(6) = holdup time of group 2 and 3 elements,
respectively, in contact with salt outside the
rTeactor.

L. NTIME(I),PUNIT(I),I=1,10

FORMAT (10 (I4,A4))

NTIME(I) = the removal time of group I elements expressed in units of
PUNIT(I); these are used only for printout purposes when going through
MATADOR for the first time.

M. NZ(I),EFF(I),I=1,8

FORMAT(8(13,F7.4))

The variables are dummy variables with no relation to the variables
read as card type J. Here NZ is an atomic number as before, but EFF is
a fraction of the element of group 2 or 3 which is plated out in the
reactor. The remaining material is assumed to be deposited outside the

reactor flux. As many cards are read as necessary until NZ=0 is encountered.

MAIN input

The main program primarily reads input describing the flowsheet and
variables which control execution and output. The cards that follow are

are not excluded because they do not affect DLi values.
I13 iterations are made at end in which nuclides do not
affect DLi values, and are not excluded.

If I14.GT.0, the program supplies MATADOR with a
derivative of reactor inlét concentration with respect
to reactor outlet concentration,

If I15.GT.0, the program starts output section after

I15 minutes of calculation.

FORMAT (A8, 2X, 3E10.0, I2, I3, I2, Z3, A8, 2X, A8, E12.0)
Each of these cards describes a region. Three are NREG cards.
Explanation of variables:

REGION Name of region, 8 characters.

VOLX Volume of the first phase, cc.
VOLY Volume of the second phase, cc.
XLIB Parameter for equilibrium (e.g., lithium distribution,

temperature). Number of column applicable in table
of valences NV.LT.0 implies a correction is to be
made to XLIB.
NSTR Number indicating the type of equilibrium.
IP Controls printout on the basis of binary representation.
IP=0 Printing includes both phases.
IP=1 First phase information stored in left half
of line.
IP=2 Second phase information stored in left half
of line.
IP=3 TFirst phase information stored in right half
of line.
IP=4 Second phase information stored in right half
of line.
Printout of a line occurs when a region has IP=0 or when two successive
regions have IP#0. One of these should have a value of IP=l or 2, and

the other should have IP=3 or 4.
51

NC This variable has three hexadecimal digits. The
first digit has a value from O to 3. TIts binary
digits indicate the phases whose molar volumes must
be iteratively recalculated. Its values are:

0-00 Neither molar volume is to be recalculated.
1-01 Second phase molar volume calculations only.
2-10 TFirst phase molar volume calculations only.
3-11 Both phases require molar volumes calculation.
The next two hexadecimal digits are used to identify
the first and second phases, respectively. Even when
molar volume calculations are not made, these can be

used for assigning the assumed molar volumes.

REGA Name of first phase to be used in output, 8 characters.
REGB Name of second phase to be used in output, 8 characters.
EIN The number of equivalents per cubic centimeter of the

materials considered assumed in the second phase. If
EIN is negative, the number of equivalents per cubic
centimeter entering is used.
RINTO(I), INPUT(I), COMP(I), ICP(I), I=1, NINP
FORMAT (A8, 2X, I10, E12.0, I3)
Each card describes an input of one nuclide to a region. Number
of cards is NINP.
Explanation of variables:
RINTO Name of region fed, 8 characters.
INPUT Numeric name (6-digit identification) of the nuclide.

COMP Feed rate of INPUT to RINTO, moles/sec.
52

ICP ICP.GT.0 identifies streams included in calculation
of second phase inlet equivalent density.
G. NSET

NSET is the number of cards of type H is NSET.GT.O.
H. RDEF(I), INDEF(I), DCOMP(I), I=1, NSET
FORMAT (A8, 2X, 110, E12.0)
These cards list the places where certain concentrations are
defined. They might be bismuth in a bismuth supply tank or 0.5
Li-Bi solution in a supply tank of that material.
RDEF Region name, 8 characters.
INDEF Numerical name of nuclide.
DCOMP The concentration in moles/cc of nuclide INDEF in
region RDEF.
I. RXFROM(J), RXTO(J), XRATE(J), J=1, NINX

XRATE TFlow rate of material of the first phase, cc/sec,
from region RXFROM to region RXTO.
'J. RXFROM(J), RYTO(J), YRATE(J), J=1, NINY
FORMAT (A8, 2X, A8, E12.0)
Variable definitions are analogous to variables read as type I,
except that flows are second-phase flow rates. The cards of types F, H,
I, and J, and some of the cards that follow require the identification

of regions by name. These are the regions named by cards of type E.
53

The names are compared for exact matches (spaces count). When a name
for a stream destination (type I, and J) is not in the list of region
names, the name is compared with "DISCARD" (left justified). If this
comparison indicates a match, the stream is assumed to be discarded.
If the name does not match, it is assumed to be discarded, but a message
to this effect is printed. Note that the comparison with this key word
is made only when no successful comparison is made to listed region names.
Thus, the key word can be a legitimate region if the user so desires.
Cards of type K, L, and M are read only if NWASTE # O.

FORMAT (204A4)
54

XI0 is the list of concentrations punched from previous programs.
The format allows a very compact representation of single pre-
cision numbers. One must ensure that the first number on the
card does not identify the card as an end-of-file or end-of-

information indication.

Next is read (if I1.GT.O):

DXIN (800 values)

FORMAT (20A4)

DXIN may be removal efficiencies or molar flow rates; their
values are examined for indications of which one they represent,
and the other 1s then calculated. This is not a fool-proof

method of identification, however.

If I8.GT.0, the program now reads a description of the flowsheet in the

format in which it can later be punched. In addition to replacing the

values in the previously defined variables, it replaces the values in

several variables determined from these. This is done to allow the use

of the parameter values arrived at in previous runs and thus save recal-

culation by iterationms.

RXNA(I), RXNB(I), SCFACT(I), NFORM(I), I=1, NRATE

FORMAT [2 (A8, 2X, A8, E12.0, I5, 5X)]

Elements are assumed to go from the region RXNA to the region
RXNB at a rate equal to the product of their concentration,
the value of SCFACT, and the value listed in the rate table

opposite the element symbol in column NFORM. If NFORM is
R.

greater than 100, the table used is NFORM—lOO, but the table
values are changed to 1 except where the value is 0.0,

There are JRATE cards of this type.

REGL, REGG, ITH, COMM

FORMAT (A8, 2X, A8, 2X, I5, 5X, 25Al)

REGL Name of region at origin of the stream.

REGG Name of region at destination of the stream.
ITH Column number of rate constant table.
COMM 25-character comment to appear in output listing.

Streams of this type use a scale factor equal to the flow of
material through REGL.
There are KRATE cards of this type.
REGL, REGG, AKL, AB, AS, XG, XL, ITD, ITH, ITC
FORMAT (A8 ,2X, A8, 2X, 5F10.7, 2I3, I2)

REGL, REGG, ITH are defined as above.

AKL Overall liquid phase mass transfer coefficient,
cm/sec.

AB Bubble area, cmz.

AS Surface area, cmz.

XG Thickness of stagnant gas through which diffusion
occurs.

XL Thickness of stagnant liquid through which diffusion
occurs.

ITD Column number giving gas phase diffusivities.

ITC Variable controlling input. If ITC is not 0, the

next card will be an extension of this card and
56

will replace the value of the comment with the
first 25 characters on the next card.
This type of card produces three rate streams which represent mass
transfer to and from the gas at the bubbles and at the surface, and
the transfer of nonvolatile nuclides from the gas to the liquid at the
surface.
S. TMT (100 values, 5 cards required)
FORMAT (20A4)
FMT is in the form of a format instruction and is the heading
printed at the top of the table of rate constant data read next.
T. RDATA(I), I=1,800
FORMAT (8X, 8ES8.0)

RDATA Contains the data referred to by column number
by variables ITH, ITD, and NFORM. The data should
be arranged on cards so that cards are in order of
atomic number (100 cards) with the columns con-
taining the numbers described previously. These
can be diffusivities, Henry's law constants,

PR/ (1-PR) (where PR is percent removal), or any
other constants which might vary with atomic
number.

After these cards are read, input is read by subroutine EQKN and

subroutine VOLUME, respectively.
57

INPUT TO EQKN

EQKN reads a series of card pairs from unit 50 to assign values to
the distribution coefficients throughout the processing plant. The
cards read contain:

A. LZ, NS, NT, AN, A, B, ENAME

FORMAT (I3, 212, 8X, F2,0, 10X, E8.0, 2X, E8.0, 33X, A2)

B. Lz2, NS2, REF

FORMAT (13, I2, 75Al1)

LZ atomic number

i

NS = number identifying the type of equilibrium corresponds

to NSTR in the description of regions.

NT = didentifies the type of equation involved.
0 End of input, return
1 1oglO(D) = (AN) log10 XLIB + A+B/T (in ° K)
2 D=A
3,4 log(P) = A/(273.2 + XLIB) + B
D Distribution coefficient
XLIB Constant read with region descriptions
P Partial pressure

AN, A, B = data
ENAME = elemental symbol name for output of equilibrium
LZ2, NS2 = not used
REF = 75 character reference for data in the first card.
Two special flags are recognized. If the element atomic number is

102, the value of NT is assumed to be 2. In addition, all elements are
58

assigned the same distribution constant for the distribution type NS.
This overrides previous input, but it is assumed that exceptions follow.
This device greatly reduces the amount of input. If the atomic number
LZ is 101, no data are taken from the cards, but the variable REF is
assumed to be a page heading for this type of equilibrium. For proper
output tabulation, it is assumed that all cards specifying a particular
type of equilibrium are together and that these are separated by title
changes.

The program prints the form of the equation in the output table,
The space allowed between constants on input cards may be used to type

the equation that will be used.

INPUT TO VOLUME

 

All input to VOLUME is read from unit 2 and is used to make estimates
of molar volumes and a table of valences.

A. NTA, NTB
FORMAT (3212)
Each variable has 16 elements corresponding to the value of
the second and third hexadecimal digit of NC, which corresponds
to regions and identifies the phases present. The values
identify the column numbers in VOLC.

B. VOLC
FORMAT (8X, 8E8.0)
Eight hundred values are read, corresponding to 8 values each
(1 card) for the elements in increasing order of atomic number.

A listing gives 8 columns, which correspond to phases, and 100
59

rows, which correspond to elements. VOLC contains the contri-
bution of the elements to the molar volume of each of the phases.
VAL

FORMAT (8X, 8E8,0)

VAL has 800 values arranged similarly to VOLC. The values of
VAL are valences for use in contactors, with columns being

referred to by the variable NV.

APPENDIX C: OUTPUT

Output Produced by MATADOR and its Subroutines

A. Output from AMATRX:

(1) Nuclear Library

(2) Summary of fission yields

The fission yields are summarized by mass chains in two groups,
and cumulative totals are given after each group for particle and mass
yields as indicated by the nuclear library.

B. Output from MATADOR on the first call:
MATADOR produces a list of the input wariables.
C. Output from CHEMPL on the first call:

CHEMPL produces an element-by-element table of removal times using
the starting efficiencies, the removal time given by NTIME, and the units
given by PUNIT. The user is responsible for ensuring agreement of NTIME
and PUNIT with the variable TIME in units of seconds.

D. Output from RESULT produced each time RESULT is called:

(1) A table is produced that lists the concentration for each
nuclide in moles per cubic centimeter and atom fraction, its
contribution to poisoning, its inventory in curies, its con-
tribution to the power density, the fraction of that power
produced as gamma heat, its chemical processing rate, and its
mole fraction in the inlet stream as determined by the proces-
sing plant code.

(2) This table is followed by a list of calculated values which

indicate redctor performance.
61

(3) This information is summarized for the 25 greatest values under
most of the headings in the first table; another table is given
providing totals for each stream.

(4) A summary is presented that compares thorium burnup rate with
the weight of fission products and actinides removed.

(5) A summary table is given that lists the total rate of chemical
processing for each element.

(6) A note is included on the number of calls to MATADOR. (This
is only accurate if KEE is called every time a pass is made

through MATADOR.)

Output from the Processing Plant Program

Printed Output

The output begins with output obtained by the first call to MATADOR.
The program then prints the input variables. Tables appear that describe
all regions, list-feed streams and specified concentrations, describe
flowing streams in each phase and streams defined by rate coefficients,
indicate expressions for distribution coefficients, and compute additive
molar volumes and valences.

A number of intermediate calculated results are printed to monitor
the progress of the calculations. Between iterations, there is a list
of the 50 nuclides with the greatest relative change in concentration
returning to the reactor, and the concentrations and the relative
changes. Upon convergence, this list is printed for all nuclides.

The lithium distribution XLIB calculated by VOLUME is also printed

between iterations, with the change in equivalent density entering
62

each stage for which the distribution coefficients are recalculated.
As a means of monitoring the progress of calculations, the time in
hundredths of a second is printed at various points in the calculation.
When the time limit or convergence criterion is met, another call
is made to RESULT to obtain output summarizing the reactor calculations.
A partial listing of the flowsheet description is made which reflects
the new flow rates used. A table, whose heading gives the half-1life
and removal time of the nuclide, is included for each nuclide in the
library. The table lists the concentration (moles/cc), the inventory
(in moles and in curies), and the total flow rate (in moles/day) of the
nuclide in each phase of each region in the processing plant. The tables
are shortened by the combining of one-phase regions as indicated by the
input variable, IP. Each of these tables is followed by a list of all
discard rates in moles per day, and a list of flow rates in moles per
day in all streams which do not represent the total flow of one phase
out of a region. In all of these, the regions and phases are identified
by their names. When two regions each have one phase to be listed on
the same line, as specified by IP, the region name of the first of the
two regions in the input is used to apply to both. This output is repeated
in a summary table for each element in which the totals are given for the
values in the previous tables. These tables are followed by a table giving
the totals for all materials.
This series is followed by a series of tables which give heat genera-
tion rates in each phase of each region. For each table, the 50 nuclides
with the highest heat generation rate at that point in the flowsheet are

listed along with their contribution to total heat generation rate, gamma
63

heat generation rate, and beta heat generation rate. Each of these is
given as total power in megawatts, and as power density of kilowatts per
liter. These are totaled for all nuclides, and an adiabatic temperature
rise in °C per minute is printed.

In addition to printed output, the program prepares punched output
which includes reactor concentrations and processing plant removal times
for all nuclides, and a description of the flowsheet. This output, if
requested by positive values for the input variables I2 and I6, can be
used later to essentially continue the calculations from the point at
which output was obtained. The reactor concentrations and processing
plant removal times can also be used to eliminate many of the iterations

required when a flowsheet with similar performance is used.

Qutput to be Used by ORIGEN

 

A copy of OR.IGEN7 was obtained, and modifications were made to allow
the printing of only those tables specified by input variables, to allow
input formats to be used which require flow rates in a form convenient
for output by the processing plant code, and to allow input to be read
from a source other than the card reader. Output in this form describing
a series of streams is produced on unit 28 for later input to ORIGEN,

In all programs used to date, this output was written on a disc file
read by ORIGEN in a second job step.

The first streams included are specified by the input variables
NWASTE, RWASTE, FWASTE, and KWASTE. TFor output stream IW (SNWASTE), the
variable RWASTE(IW) gives the name of the destination of all streams that

are included. Streams that are discarded may be sent to a nonexistent
64

region name in the list of waste regions. The included streams are
further decreased by the use of KWASTE(IW) to specify the phase as follows:

KWASTE*LT*0 only first-phase streams are considered,

KWASTE*EQ*0 streams from either phase are considered,

KWASTE*GT*0 only second-phase streams are considered.
The molar flows of streams meeting these requirements are added and
multiplied by ABS[FWASTE(IW)] before being sent to ORIGEN and included
in the total. TFor the special case of KWASTE(IW)'NE:0, and FWASTE(IW)
between -0.001 and 0.0, the value of FWASTE(IW) is 0.001 when considering
isotopes of neptunium. Streams are then output which represent 5 liters
of salt sticking to the graphite divided by the number of days in 4 years,
these represent daily discard rates of noble metals from the reactor core,
noble gases from the salt drain tank, and noble metals from outside the
reactor core. All of these, except the salt sticking to the graphite,
are added to the flow output streams with FWASTE(IW)-GT-0; the total is
output to represent total daily waste other than graphite removal.
Finally, the daily rate of deposition of materials on the graphite is

output as a stream that ORIGEN will assume is irradiated for 4 years.
