FOREWORD

This quarterly progress ‘i'eport of the Aircrof'f Nuclear Propuisionr Project at ORNL records
the technical progress of the research on Icirc_ulati'ng-.fue( reactors and all other ANP research at
the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts:
l.  Reactor Theory, Component Develbbhént, and Construction, [l. Materials Research, and
tH. Shielding Research. |

The ANP Project is coiﬁpﬁsed of about 510 technical and scienﬁ,fi‘c personnel engaged in
many phases of research directed toward fherqc‘rhrievemem‘ of nuclear pfopulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the national ANP effort.  However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is
directed toward the de\felopmenf of a circulcfing-fuel type of react.or.

The design, construction,i and operatibn of the Air'crdft Reactér Test (ART), with the coopera-
tion of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are the specific objectives of the project. The
ART is to be a power plant sYs'remr that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and adequﬁfe means for heat disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose

of determining the feasibility, and the problems associated with the design, construction, and

“operation, of a high-power, circulating-fuel, reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system.

- 17. Reflector-Moderoted Reactor -

A confract was oworded on Augusi 19 ]955 to the
V. L. Nicholson Cornpany, ‘Knoxville, Tennessee,
_'rhe Iow bldder for pockoge ] of the Aircraft Reactor
‘Test (ART) focdrfy. Therr low ‘b:d of $765,835
included $264,373 for the reactor cell, with the
Chrcogo Bridge & lron Co. engaged to serve as

“the subcom‘ractor to des:gn, fabricate, and erect

the cell, Package 1 includes, in addition to the

“cell, the major modifications of Building 7503.

Recent experiments at the Tower Shielding
Focr]rfy (TSF) emphasized the need for shleldlng
data from the ART, and therefore a layout has been
comple‘red to provrde for the measurement of the
gommo-roy ‘spectrum of the ART as a function of
the angle of emission from the reacfor shleld

; surfoce.

- Layout drow:ngs have been completed for the
prmcrpol features of the ART reactor—pump-—heat
exchanger-—-pressure shell assembly, and the de-
tails are considered to be sufflcrenﬂy firm for
procurement to be started. Fabrication of the

4‘she'Hs, such as the pressure shell, reﬂecfor |

that is insensitive to the one-pump-out condition,
Tests performed to date were planned to assist in
the systematic development of an inlet-guide-vane
and turbulence-generator design that will produce
radial velocities of sufficient magnitude to keep
the boundary-layer fluid mixed with the free stream.
High-speed photographs of dye injections and con-
ductivity measurements of salt injections are being
used fo examine radial flow, circumferential dis-
tribution, and transients, Core designs with lower
degrees of divergence than that of the present
21-in. design are being studied to determine the
effect of inlet annulus dimensions on the adverse
pressure gradients encountered by the fuel in
flowing from the core inlet to the equator.

Performance tests of the fuel pump with water as
the circulated fluid were completed. The noise
present in the initial testing was found to result
from a local flow condition that existed at the
tongue of the pump volute. A modification of the
volute design has eliminated the noise, and other
impeller modifications have brought about a con-
dition in which the hydraulic force balance on the
impeller occurs near design speed and flow., The
tests have demonstrated that the design point lies
in the region of maximum efficiency.

2 Experlmental Reucfor Engineering

The frrsf loop for” c:rcu!cmng fluoride fuel inb

hole HB-3 of the MTR was shipped to NRTS on

June 20. It successfully passed the preoperational
checks, and startup of the loop proceeded satis-
factorily to the final step, that is, melting of the
freeze line and filling of the loop with the fuel
mixture. The heater for the freeze line was found
to be inoperable, and therefore the experiment was
terminated. The loop has been returned to ORNL
and disassembled, The modifications required to
overcome the difficulties encountered have been
incorporated in a second loop that is nearly ready
for shipment to NRTS, A third loop is also being
fabricated. The auxiliary facilities required ot the
MTR for operation of the in-pile loop were com-
pleted, including a loop retractor mechanism for
adjustment of the loop nose position during reactor
operation.

Twenty-two fused-salt—Inconel forced-circulation

| loops were operafed in the test program for studying
corrosion and mass-transfer in high-temperature-

differential, htgh velocity systems under conditions
that simulate reactor flow rates and temperatures.
Nine similar loops were operated with sodium in
Inconel or in srcnnless sfee! tubmg.

A new test loop has been des:gned w:th whlch
it will be possnbie to obtain accurate information
~ ... on 'rhe oxygen content of sodium or NaK during

pera’r:on of the loop. The main loop of the system

is to include a bypass cold trap and a sampling

 

en.d analyzing device, and cnauxﬂ:arypluggmg-

indicator loop will be attached to the main loop.
Also, a loop has been designed, in which NaK will

be circulated, that has the same ratio of surface

area to volume as that of the primary NcK cnrcuufs

of the ART,

The design layouts for two loops for high-
temperature tests of full-scale models of the ART
fuel and sodium pumps were completed, and fabri-
cation and assembly were started, The first group
of bearing-and-seal and mechanical tests on the
rotary elements of the pumps was completed. In

A new muihgroup,mulhreglon reactor caleulation general, the test results indicate that the bearing-

Cis bemg programed for the Oracle. The code will

and-seal designs for the upper and lower units can

‘be made to function satisfactorily. One short-

circuit pump-test stand was completed and shake-
down tests with water were started.

Intermediate heat exchanger test stand A was

'operc:'red for 690 hr in a series of furnace and"‘_:

diffusion cold-trap tests of the NaK circuit and a
2-hr cleaning cycle of the fluoride-fuel circuit.
The gas-fired furnace for heating the NaK proved
to be copable of transferring 1.13 Mev of heat to
the NaK aofter minor modifications, including in-
stallation of a larger burner, had been made,
After the fuel mixture had been circulated and
dumped, a leak occurred in one tube bundle of the
heat exchanger, and subsequently one of the
NaK-to-air radiators developed a leak. The leak
in the heat exchanger was found to be a radial
crack on the inside of a tube bend, It was dlso
found that severe distortion had occurred as a
result of the thermal cycling created by operating
the heat exchanger with NaK in the tubes but with-
out fuel around the tubes. The temperature dif-
ferences thus created ranged from 200 to 1000°F
The failure of the radiator is also thought to be the
result of extreme thermal cyclmg, but the analyses
of the difficulties have not yet been completed.

‘Additional test assemblies are being fabricated.

The first series of tests were completed on a
small (20-tube bundle) heat exchanger that was
operated nearly continuously for 1560 hr. Heat
transfer, pressure drop, and corrosion and mass-
transfer data were obtained. No appreciable

amount of mass fransfer could be detected by
visual inspection, and metallurgical examination

is under way. The oxide content of the NaK' was

found to be high, and therefore cold 'rrcps ore ‘ro be
lnstolled in subsequent test !oops.

s'rrucfurol chqnges in the assembly were also

TWIdfh of one of the end ducts was mcreased from

'(29 to 2 80 m., which increased its volume al-

'most 2.5 hmes. The corresponding critical mass
‘was’ about 24 kg of U235. In the other alteration,

the radius at the center of the berylllum island
was increased from 5.18 to 7.19 in. The critical

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

of low meltlng pom’r contained too much UF, for
use with circulating-fuel reactors,

Preliminary studies were made of the NaF-RbF-
ZrF ,-UF, system fo determine whether it could
provide a low-viscosity fuel. Previous work on the
RbF-ZrF, system had demonstrated the need for a
fourth component in order to obtdin a low-melting

fuel with 20 to 40 mole % ZrF4. All the work was

carried out with RbF which contained about 20
mole % KF as an impurity. The KF caused un-
expected results in the phase diagram work, which
has therefore been postponed until better RbF can
be procured Viscosity measurements in the sys-
tem RbF-ZrF -UF (48-48-4 mole %) below 600°C
were hmdered by particulate matter, but the
measurements made above 600°C gave viscosity
values which were somewhat lower than those in
the NaF-ZrF -UF, system. In order to obtain
further msrght into ’rhe mixtures containing rubidium,
sfudles were made in the KF- -ZrF , and NaF-KF-
ZrF4 systems, The latter system proved fo be
much more complex than either the NaF-ZrF ,-UF

or NaF-LiF-UF, systems, which show no 'rerncry
compounds. The NaF-KF-ZrF, system was shown
to have at least five ternary compounds.

In the system NaF-LlF-BeF2 it was found that
acceptably low melting points can be obtained with
low LiF concentration by moving into the ternary
system along the drainage path leading from the
NaF-Na,BeF, eutectic toward the LiF-Na,BeF,
eutectic. In order to obtain-a melt with a kinematic
viscosity as low as that of the ARE-type fuel, it
was established that the BeF, content cannot be
greater than 30 mole % to assure complexing of
BeF as BeF ™" The LiF content will probably
have 1o _be. less than 10 mole %. The melting
“point of NaF LIF Ber (63.5-7.5-29" mole %) was
found to be 4A525°C -and a defermma’non of its

Workable methods have been devised for re-
processing fuel used in component testing at
ORNL and Pratt & Whitney. It is expected that
2000 to 3000 Ib will scon be available each month
for reprocessing and re-use. Since a satisfactory
commercial source of ZrF , has not yet been found,
a unit is being fabricated which is capable of pro-

‘ducing 1000 Ib of ZrF, per week by direct low-

temperature hydrofluorination of ZrCi ,.
A shortage of ZrF, reduced operation of the

large-scale (250-1b bcn‘ch) fluoride-processing facil-

ity to one-half the normal capacity during this
quarter. A total of 6960 Ib of purified fluoride
compositions was produced, including the fuel
carrier for the ART high-temperature critical ex-
periment, Pilot-scale equipment was used to pro-
duce 53 batches of purified fluorides. Enriched
fuels were prepared for the high-temperature
critical and in-pile loop experiments.

Interpretation of the data is complicated by the

solid fluorides in equilibrium with the melt not
being simple metal fluorides and their compositions

being dependent on the amount of fluoride present

in excess of the saturation value, Reproducible
emf’s have also been obtained in the case where

trodes. In the cell Cr|NaF, ZrF,, CrF, | Inconel,

the molecular structure of the melts. A summary is

ments with various alkali and heavy metal halides.

and nitrate ion in fused sodium nitrate.

5. Corrosion Research

Examinations were made of several Inconel
forced-circulation loops operated with NaF-ZrF -
UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as the circulated fluid for
various times under otherwise identical conditions.
These loops, which were direct-resistance heated,
had o temperature differential of 200°F, a Reynolds
number of 10,000, a maximum fluid temperature of
1500°F, and a maximum wall temperature of 1600
to 1625°F. A curve obtained by plotting depth of
attack vs operating time exhibited the two-stage
type of attack found previously in thermal-convection
loops; that is, the initial rapid attack that occurred
while chemical equilibrium was being established
and the impurities were reacting was followed by
the slower mass-transfer type of attack. An at-
tack rate of 3 to 4 mils per 1000 hr was found for
the second stage of attack. In two similar loops
operated under the same conditions, except that
one was heated in a gas furnace and the other was

heated by electrical resistance of the tubing, the

depth of attack was not found to be affected by the
heating method, Another similar loop with a maxi-
mum wall temperature approximately 100°F higher

fluoride mixture temperature.

Additional data have been accumuluted on mcss::':

increase the mass transfer. In an all-stainless-
steel loop in which sodium was circulated, there
was a mass-transferred layer that was 0.8 mil

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

thick, in contrast to a 9-mil-thick layer found in an
Inconel loop with a stainless steel cold leg.

In an effort to ascertain the cause of the erratic
results being obtained with Inconel thermal-
convection loops, several loops were cleaned by
different methods and then operated with NaF-
ZtF -UF, as the circulated fluid. No effects
attributable to the cleaning method could be
found. In other tests, heat was applied by direct
electrical resistance of the wall rather than by the
usual “‘clamshell”’ electric heaters, The resulis
confirmed a previous conclusion that the depth of
attack was not affected by the method of heating.
Since the forced-circulation loops had indicated
that the maximum loop wall temperature was a
significant variable, thermocouples were installed
on the hot legs of two standard lnconel thermal-
convection loops to study this effect. Preliminary
results indicate that the wall temperatures may
have been as much as 1670°F, in contrast to wall
temperatures of about 1600°F in the forced-circu-
lation loops. The higher temperature difference
between the wall and the fluid may account for the
attack in the thermal-convection loops being deeper
than in the forced-circulation loops.

A series of thermal-convection loops have also
been operated with small applied potentials., The
loop which circulated NaF-ZrF ,-UF, for 2000 hr
with a positive charge applied to the hot leg showed
only dbout one-half the depth of attack found in
the loop operated with a negative charge applied
to the hot leg. With a negative hot leg the attack
was about the same as that with no applied po-
tential. Inconel thermal-convection loops operated
with sodium gave results which confirmed those
obtained with forced-circulation loops.

Hot-pressed metal-bonded tungsten carbide

~ cermets were fested in NaF-ZrF -UF, and in
than the usual 1600 to 1625°F showed heavy sub-
surface-void attack to a depth of 18 mils. Thus
additional evidence was obtained that the wall
temperature is a more crmcol varmble fhan 15 the'_" -

sodium in seesaw apparatus; no measurable attack
was found on any specimens, Similar additional

tests were made of the Kentanium cermets. The
__best of the Kentcmlum cermets are being fabricated
into valve dlsks and seats for self-bonding tests

under service condmons.
Ruthenium was plated onto Inconel for tests of

" creep-rupture properties of the plated specimen.
'Prehmmary results indicate an increase in creep

rate and a decrecse in rupture life, m comparlson

‘with standard Inconel. Additional screening tests

- sodium, and several brazing alloys on Inconel and

~ on stainless steel were tested in static lithium.
Al ‘the brczmg alloys tested showed poor corrosion

* resistance to lithium.

A static test of a Hastelloy B specimen in an

Inconel capsule containing a fluoride mixture
showed the Hastelloy B to be unattacked, but the
Inconel was attacked fo a depth of 8 mils, in con-
trast to a normal attack to a depth of 2 mils in a
static Inconel ccpsule without the Hcsfel]oy B
 specimen,
Experiments are under way with a boiling-sodium—
* Inconel system so that the effect of oxide-free
- sodium on mass transfer can be studied. In pre-
liminary experiments no mass transfer could be
~ detected.

Seesaw corrosion tests have been made on
Inconel capsules loaded with sodium-potassium-
lithium mixtures in which the lithium content was
varied from 2 to 30 wt %. The heaviest attack was
found in the hot section of each tube, and it varied
from 0.5 mil in the presence of 10% lithium to 2 to
3 mils in the presence of 5% lithium. Molybdenum,
vanadium, and niobium were tested in static
lithium at 1500°F, Molybdenum was unattacked,
niobium was only slightly attacked, and vanadium
showed grain-boundary penetration by an uniden-
tified phase to o depth of 2 mils.

Measurements of the oxidation rate of metallic
sodium at 25 and 48°C were extended to periods of
2 x 10% min, The data obtained do not fit any of
the postulated oxidation-rate theories, although
highly protective oxide films were formed.
Measurements of the oxidation rate of metallic
columbium confirmed the previously reported change
in rate law with time. Tentative conclusions have
been drawn . ‘concerning the origin of the change.

Improvements in technique have been made for

e studymg fused sodium hydroxide by spectrophoto-

- metric techmques. Measurements of corrosion in
fused sodlum hydroxlde have shown that water
~'vapor is an important inhibitor and that the pres-
ence or absence of a closed electrical circuit be-
V’rween the hot ‘and cold parts of the corroding
~ system has a significant effect on mass transfer.

© Measurements of the self-dissociation of sodium
hydroxude have been made for the first time in the
"~ absence of s:de reactions. Both the expected
decomposmon into water and sodium oxide and
 the postulated decomposition to produce hydrogen
have been confirmed,

A series of studies of thefour-componentfuel
NaF-LiF- ZrF4 -UF , (22-37.5-35.2-5mole %) exposed

for 100 hr in sealed ccpsules of Inconel in the

standard rocking furnace have indicated that this

mixture may be less corrosive than others being
considered, A series of mixtures of the NaF-KF-
LiF eutectic with UF; and UF, added were also
tested in Inconel in the rocking-furnace apparatus.
The data indicate that UF, is quite unstable under
these conditions, regardless of the original UF,-
to-UF, ratio. It also appears that considerable
disproportionation of UF ; must be expected in this
sy stem. ' '

In experiments for determining the effect of
chromium on the mass transfer of nickel in NaOH,
it was not obvious that the chromium was particu-
larly beneficial. However, it was shown that some
mechanism for preventing the loss of hydrogen

from the system ~ perhaps cladding the nickel

with some metal impervious to hydrogen - might
be quite berieficial. :

6. Metallurgy and Ceramics

Mechanical property investigations of Inconel
have continued with stress-rupture tests of Z-in.
tubing in argon and in fused salts at 1300, 1500,
and 1650°F. A comparison of creep-rupture dnd
tube-burst data showed similar rupture times for
0.060-in.-wall tubing and 0.060-in.-thick sheet in
argon and in NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at
1500°F. The data being obtained indicate that
the presence of an axial stress in the tubing does
not appreciably affect the time to failure., Data
obtained for tubing with 0.010-, 0.020-, and
0.040-in. walls show, in comparison with data for
0.060-in.-wall tubing, that the thinner the wall the
shorter the rupture life at comparable stresses.

An evaluation test in fused-salt fuel of an

Inconel bellows with a welded diaphragm showed

only normal corrosion attack in the weld areas
and no cracks that resulted from flexmg of the

bellows. A determination of the extent of inter-

action between beryllium and Inconel in contaci
at high temperatures in an inert environment was
made. The results indicated that an intermetdllic
layer was formed that would be detrimental to the
load-carrying capacity of the Inconel. This in-
formation was needed in the design of the high-
temperature critical experiment, :

Additional tests were made of nickel-molybdenum
alloys containing titanium, aluminum, vanadium,

 

 
 

zirconium, columbium, or chromium which con-

firmed the previously reported embrittlement of
these ternary alloys after a long heat treatment at
elevated temperatures in hydrogen. The ductility
of the alloy can be restored by a high-temperature
anneal in vacuum. In the study of factors affect-
ing the fabricability of Hastelloy B, it was found
that canning the extrusion billets with Inconel

teduced the pressure required during the extrusion

and at the some time clad the alloy tubing with a
heat-resistant alloy.

A series of creep-rupture tests of solution-
annealed, 0.060-in.-thick, Hastelloy B sheet at
1500 and 1650°F in NaF- ZrF ,-UF ; (50-46-4 mole
%) were completed and de5|gn curves were pre-
pared. The influence of aging heat treatments on
the creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy B is

being studied in the range 1300 to 1800°F in

argon. The creep-rupture properties at 1800°F

‘are not substantially affected by aging, since at

this temperature a single-phase alloy exists. How-
ever, at 1500°F a second phase appears to exist

in aged specimens which increases the rupture

life at high stresses. Short-time tensile tests

' conducted after long-time aging of cold-worked
Hastelloy B at high temperatures indicate that
‘tesidual stresses from the cold-working operation
‘are quite detrimental to ductility. Data showed

the ductilities of cold-worked specimens to be
considerably lower than those of specimens an-

nealed before aging. Microstructural studies indi-

¢ate that cold work induces precipitation in larger
quantities and perhaps in smaller particles than
does annealing.

‘Additional oxudanon-resns’rance tests of high-
temperature brazmg alloys were ‘conducted, and

melting-point studies are being made by using

sintered, conical samples. Experiments are under

way in an attempt to find an alloy for brazing a
boroh carbide compact to an Inconel envelope.

The alloys lnveshga’red thus far that wet the

after the development of experimental techniques
for minimizing distortion. The fabrication of a
third, 500-kw, NaK-to-air radiator is under way,
The design of the radiator is essentially the same
as that used previously, but improved fabrication
techniques are being utilized, Presintered rings
are to be used for the preplacement of brazing
alloy. One tube bundle of the fuel-to-NaK inter-
mediate heat exchanger No. 3 has been completed,
and construction of the second tube bundle is under
way. Design modifications for this heat exchanger
have included the use of larger diameter fubing
(0.250 in.) and the elimination of right-angle
corners of header components to provide better
stress distribution. A second liquid-metal-to-air
radiator was fabricated for the Cornell Aeroncuflcal
L aboratory,

An eddy-current method for flaw detection in
[ow-conductivity tubing is being investigated.
Studies have shown that an ultrasonic method for
the inspection of small-diameter tubing is suf-
ficiently sensitive to detect the types of flaws
encountered to date.

Corrosion-erosion in graphite-hydrogen systems
at 2400°C, with a hydrogen velocity of Mach 0.15,
is being investigated., Present indications are
that the slight weight losses observed were due to
the small amounts of water vapor in the gas.

Two rare-earth-oxide control rod assemblies were
prepared for critical experiments; flux-detector
spacers of calcium fluoride and alumina were pro-
duced; dysprosium oxide disks were prepared for
use in measuring thermal flux; and a method for
preparing europium oxide wafers was investigated,
A study of the feasibility of synthesizing MozBs
and B,C was started, and the optimum pressing
conditions for pelletizing fluoride fuels are being
determined.

Investigations of diffusion barriers for use be-
tween Inconel and columbium have shown only
tantalum and copper to be useful. Tests for de-
termining 'rhe more saﬂsfoctory of the two barrier

materials are under way. Mixtures of columbium

and UO,, being considered for use as fuel elements

“were tested at 1500 and 1832°F for 100 hr. A

The deformation patterns obtained in two- and
three-ply extrusions of metal tubing were studied,
and limits were established on the metal ratios

and on the configurations of the billets that can be
successfully extruded, The creep performance of

" lead-calcium was found to depend upon the care

with which the master alloys were made. This
implies that an accurate knowledge of the amount

“of alloyed calcium rather than total calcium is

required.  Therefore, chemical analyses, which
give a measure of the total calcium, were found to
be an unreliable index for predicting the creep
properties of the alloy.

The fabrication of boron-containing materials
for use as neutron shielding is being studied. At
present, attempts are being made to thermally bond
boron-containing layers to Inconel, The use of
B;C tiles is also being considered for locations
where therma[ bonds are not necessary,

7. Heut Trunsfer and Phys:cul Properties

Forced-convectlon hec'r transfer medasurements

were made for ‘molten NaF-KF-LiF- UF, (11.2-41-

45,3-2.5 mole %) which was flowing furbulem‘ly

through type 316 stainless steel tubes. The re-
sults were comparable with those obtained pre-
viously in an Inconel tube and were thus 40% below
the general turbulent-flow heat transfer correlation,
A check on the experimental apparatus was ob-
tained by operating it with water as the heat trans-
fer medium, and the data were in good agreement
with the general turbulent-flow correlation, The
low heat transfer valuves obtained with NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, therefore appear to be real.

The heat transfer and friction characteristics of
a full-scale model of the ART heat exchanger
were determined with and without the presence of
tube spacers. These results were compared with
conventional heat transfer and friction relations
for simple duct systems. As was to be expected,
both the heat transfer coefficients and the friction
factors decreased upon removal of the tube spacers,
However,' when the spacers were removed, the

| tubes were not held rigadly and channeling occurred

in the flow pch‘ern.
A summcry of hydrodynamic research on models

.of the 18- and 2l-in. ART cores has been pre-
pared.  Rotational and axial flow patterns, as
‘well as various entrance conditions, were studied,

One core, which had a low ratio of flow cross-

sectional area at the equator to flow cross-sectional
“area at the inlet, was characterized by uniform and

steady flow.
~ The temperature distributions within fluids flow-

ing through converging and diverging channels were

.experimenfcny determined in the volume-heat-

source system, Information on the transient be-
havior of the wall temperatures, as well as on the
asymmetry of wall temperature profiles, was ob-
tained for these uncooled channels. A report has
been prepared which describes applications to
general convection problems of previously de-
veloped mathematical temperature solutions for
forced-convection systems having volume heat
sources within the fluids.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of LiF-KF
{50-50 mole %) were determined in the liquid and
solid states, The viscosities of eight fluoride
mixtures were determined. A mixture of RbF and
LiF (57-43 mole %) yielded a viscosity of 9.0
centipoises at 500°C and 3.4 centipoises at 650°C,
An RbF counterpart of the ART fuel was formu-
lated, This mixture, whose composition is RbF-
ZtF ,-UF, (48-48-4 mole %), had a viscosity of
9.5 centipoises at 550°C and 3.1 centipoises at
850°C, Its kinematic viscosity was found to be
about 20% lower than that of the corresponding
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , mixture.

8. Radiation Damage

The high-temperature forced-circulation fluoride-
fuel loop recently operated in a horizontal beam
hole in the LITR was examined metallographically.
Corrosion of the Inconel tubing by the circulating
fluoride-fuel mixture was found to be fow and to
be substantially the same as that found previously
in capsules exposed in the MTR. No increases in
corrosion attack because of irradiation and no
other unusual effects were found. In the portion of
the loop that showed the maximum corrosion, the
average penetration was 1 mil and the maximum
was 2.5 mils. In general, the changes in the
Inconel were those expected in specimens sub-
jected to the heat treatment imposed by operation
of the loop. The average corrosion for the entire
loop was 0.5 mil, and no deposits of mass-trans-
ferred material were found, The fuel circulated
in this loop was NaF-ZrF --UF4 (62.5-12.5-5
mole %). The fission power generated in the
fuel was calculated to be 2.8 kw, and the maximum
power density was 0.4 kw/cm3,

The miniature in-pile loop was operated in a

“vertical position in the LITR, but the experiment
was terminated after about 30 hr because a faulty’

pump motor prevented the maintenance of steady
fuel flow. The test was incomplete as a corrosion
study, but it was possible to make a fairly thorough

study of the in-pile characteristics of the loop.
The necessary design modifications are being
made, and a new loop is being fabricated,

The Reactor Experimental Review Committee
has approved the insertion of the pressurized
stress-corrosion apparatus in HB-3 in the LITR,
and specimen assemblies for a series of tests are
being filled with fuel. Bench tests are in progress
on an apparatus for insertion in the MTR that is
designed to test creep in two nonfuel atmospheres.
An MTR (tensile) creep test apparatus irradiated
during two reactor cycles is being returned to
ORNL for postirradiation measurements., The
bench equivalent of this apparatus has been
assembled and tests have been started.

The maximum high-energy neutron flux in HB-3
of the MTR was measured to be 3.1 x 103 fast
neutrons/cm2.sec, and the thermal-neutron flux
was found to be 2.3 x 104 neutrons/cmZ.sec. A
flux-depression experiment in HB-3 indicated a
lack of sensitivity of flux depression to the kind
of nuclear absorber used. The power to be ex-
pected in the MTR in-pile loop was estimated from
the measurements to be 31 to 36 kw.

Analyses of reactor-grade beryliium obtained from
The Brush Beryllium Co. and the R. D, MacKay
Company showed that the predominant source of
gamma activity after long irradiation followed by a
few days decay is Sc48, The quantity of scandium
present is so small that it cannot be found by
chemical analyses with a limit of detection of

200 ppm.

f9. Analyhcal Chemlstry of Reactor Materials

Modifications of the n-butyl bromide method for
the determination of oxygen in sodium were evalu-
ated. The modifications included the addition of
a column of silica gel and diatomaceous earth

for the rapid purification and desiccation of re-

agents and an lmproved apparatus in which the

‘reaction between sodlum and butyl bromide could

be carried ouf in an afmosphere of argon, Although

:Tests were made of fhe method for the determina-

tion of oxygen in sodium by titration of the Nazo,_'

that remains after vacuum distillation of the sodium
metal. An apparatus was constructed that was
similar to one developed by the Argonne National

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

L.aboratory. Preliminary results on sodium sampled
at 1200°F showed an oxygen content of the order
of 50 ppm. Since samples of sodium at high tem-
peratures can be obtained with this apparatus and
since fow levels of oxygen can be detected, the
apparatus is to be attached directly to a forced-
circulation high-temperature-differential sodium
loop so that analyses can be carried out during
operation of the loop.

Development of a volumetric method for the de-
termination of zirconium in fluoride salts was
completed, In this method zirconium is converted
to a stable complex by the addition of an excess
of disodium dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(EDTA) to a dilute H2804 solution containing
zirconium, The excess EDTA is ftitrated with
trivalent iron to a disodium-1,2-dihydroxybenzene-
3,4-disulfonate end point at a pH of 4.8, Titration
can be conducted in the presence of as much as
0.1 M of fluoride ion by first complexing the
fluoride ion with beryllium, Slight modifications
in the procedure make the method also applicable
to the determination of zirconium in the presence
of moderate amounts of trivalent iron, divalent
nickel, and trivalent chromium.

The apparatus for the determination of uranium
metal in mixtures of fluoride salts by decomposi-
tion of the hydride in an atmosphere of oxygen at
reduced pressures was modified to include two

combustion tubes so that one sample can be oxi-

dized while a second is being converted to the
hydride.

Analytical assistance was given in a study of
the rate of elimination of atmospheric gases from
a dry box with argon. The most efficient flushing
action was found to be the fairly rapid injection of
argon at the bottom of the dry box, without supple-
mentary agitation. With an argon flow rafe of 25
cfh, the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere
of a 21-ft3 dry box was reduced by a factor of 100

by flushing with two volumes of argon.

Investigation was continued of the application
of the bromination method to the determination of
oxygen in ZrF ‘and its mixtures with alkali-metal

fluoride sal'rs._ Incomplete removal of oxygen wdas
observed for samples of pure ZrO, after bromina-

tion for 6 hr at 950°C,

“In the bromination method for the determination

of oxygen in metal oxides, the oxygen is converted

to CO and then oxidized to C02 for measurement.
A method for the direct measurement of CO was
studied in which the CO is absorbed in an aqueous

solution of PdC|2 and KCl. The net increase in
- hydrogen ion concentration of this solution is a
function of the CO present. Excellent titration
curves were obtained only when an amount of Kl
in excess of ‘the PdCI present was added to the
_soluhon prIOI’ to h’rroflon with a standard base.

‘IO. Recovery and Reprocessing of Reactor Fuel

A _,rey_rl_ewr of the deslgn and construction prob-
- lems involved in the completion of the pilot plant

" for fhe fe'coikéfy of fused-salt fuels has indicated

~that a construction completion date near the end
of February 1956 will be more realistic than the
December 1955 date given previously. An engi-
neering flow shee'r was issved, and approximately
65% of the process equipment items are on hand
of are in some stage of procurement or fabrication,

The dump tank containing the ARE fuel was
moved, uneventfully, from the ARE building to
the pilot plant building. Methods have been de-

: 4ﬁV|sed for removing the fused salt from the dump

‘tank and from other types of containers for charg-
ing into the fluorination vessel.

Direct-resistance heating of transfer lines was
found to be satisfactory for preventing plugging,
except at fittings, where supplemental external
heating will be required, A freeze valve was de-
signed for closing the transfer lines to and from
the fluorinator, After 15 cycles of freezing and
thawing, this valve, when frozen, held against a
pressure of 20 psig without leaking.

An improved procedure for decontamination of the
UF6 product of the fluorination step was developed
which involves the absorption of the UF , on NaF
at 100°C and desorption by heating to 400°C, with
the product gas passing through a second bed of
NaF before collection of the UF, in a cold trap.
Since in this two-bed process, in contrast to the
previous process in which a single absorbent bed
was used, the fission products never enter the
product-collection system, decontamination factors
of greater than 105 were obtained in re-used equip-
ment. Preliminary results indicate that nitrogen
may be used as a sweep gas in both the fluorina-
~“tion and the NaF absorption and desorption steps

A survey of fhe welghts of spherically symmetric

10

for a range in dose rates of 0.1 to 10 rem/hr at a

distance of 50 ft and a range in reactor power of
100 to 300 Mw. An estimate was obtained for the
added weight of an NaK-to-NaK secondary heat
exchanger and its shielding, The additional weight
was found to vary sharply with the manner in
which the dose rate was divided between the

"secondary heat exchanger and the reactor and with

the absolute value of the sodium activation. The
chief sources of radiation in the 300-Mw circulating-
fuel reactor for the NJ- 1 power plant were determined.

New data recently obtained at the TSF and 'ﬂie
LTSF are being used in a parametric shield weight

study for a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor in

which the important reactor dimensions are varied.
Differences between the shield test mockups and
the design reactors are accounted for 'o_h“the' _boé_is
of the present understanding of the sources of
radiation in each. As a result, shield weight
dependence upon reactor and shield d|mens:ons
and materials can now be calculated with greater
certainty, The results obtained to date indicate
that divided shield weights can be significantly
reduced by increased shield-shaping based upon

The static source tests of the second series of
the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated-reactor and
shield (RMR-shield) mockup experiments have been
completed. The final tests included neutron und
gamma-ray measurements beyond the mockups to
determine the effect of placing an intermediate or
high atomic weight material immediately behind the
beryllium reflector, varying the thickness of the
reflector, and distributing the lead gamma-ray
shield in borated water,
RMR-shield, little, if any, welght saving results
from adding bismuth to the outer region of the
reflector rather than using lead in the shield. The
addition of a 2-in.-thick layer of copper in the
same region was insufficient to effect an appreci-
able weight saving, but there was ev:dence that
there might be enough self-absorption of ccpfure
gamma rays in a 4-in,-thick copper layer to show a
valuable weight saving,
thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.) did not have an

no weight saving as a result of distributing the
lead rather than placing it in one piece but that
there might be an appreciable weight saving as
a result of distributing the lead beyond the first
5-in. layer, The secondary gamma-ray dose rate
produced in the lead and borated-water shield fell
off at the same rate as the thermal neutron flux

~ and thus was apparently caused by thermal-neutron

captures in the shield.

~Sodium activation tests were performed to de-
termine the activation of the coolant in the heat
exchanger region as a function of the heat ex-
changer thickness, the boron curtain thickness and
distribution, and the reflector thickness, Results
of representative tests showed that the sodium
activation in the heat exchanger was increased in
going from a 4-in. thickness to a 6-in. thickness.
The probability of escape of the resonance neu-
trons was reduced by the increased thickness; the
probability may be increased, however, by dis-
tributing the boron curtain through the heat ex-
changer region. An increase in the reflector thick-
ness from 8 to 12 in. decreased the sodium acti-
vation by 80%. A gamma-ray shield of copper
placed between the beryllium reflector and the
first boron curtain increased the sodium activation
by a factor of about 6.

13. Bulk Shleldmg Fucull'ry

A part of the experiment designed for determining
the gross fission-product gamma-ray spectrum was
completed.  Small samples of enriched uranium
were irradiated in the ORNL Graphite Reactor for
time intervals ranging from 1 to 8 sec, and the
gross fission-product photon spectrum was studied
by using the mulhple-crysfol gammo-ray specfrom-
eter. The decay of six energy groups, covering

from the reactor were integrated. The integrated
dose {0.49 mrep/hrew) compared surprisingly well
with the total dose measured by the Hurst-type
dosimeter (0.52 mrep/hrew),

Measurements were also made through 70 cm of
water at a point 19.6 c¢cm from the center line of
the reactor and through 5 cm of water on the center
line of the reactor. In all cases the measured dose
remained constant, within the statistical devia-
tion, when the collimator was pointed at the active
lattice of the reactor.

14. Tower Shielding Facility
The results of Phase | of the TSF differential

shielding experiments have been incorporated in
the development of a procedure for optimizing the
neutron shield of a divided aircraft shield. In this
optimization procedure the neutron shield at the
reactor is divided into N conical shells. The
thickness of the nth conical shell is then denoted
by T, (n=1,2,...,N). Thecrew shield is assumed
to be cylindrically shaped, with a rear thickness
T, and a front and a side thickness T .. The pro-
cedure then consists in (1) expressing both the
total weight of the neutron shield and the dose
rate at the center of the crew compartment as
functions of the T 's, T, and T_; (2) using the
method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain the equa-
tions which the T ’'s, T, and T must satisfy in
order that the weight be a minimum for a specified
total dose rate at the center of the crew com-
partment; and {3) developing an iterative procedure
for the solution of these equations,

Core Flow Studies

E. C. Lindley W. J. Stelzman
A. M. Smith J. M. Trummel

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division
Two approaches to the core hydrodynamics
problem are being investigated. Both make use
~of a vortex sheet in the annulus between the
“island ‘and reflector in an effort to get a high
o degree of mixing. In the first system the vortex
~~ _axes parallel the island, while in the second they

spiral helically downward around it. In both
systems the two fuel pump volutes discharge
tangentially into the core inlet to give a system
that is insensitive to the one-pump-out condition,

Fight series of tests have been made on the
axial vortex system in the metal core rig. The
tests constituted a systematic development of an
inlet-guide-vane and turbulence-generator design

‘which would produce radial velocities of sufficient

magnitude to keep the boundary-layer fluid mixed
with the free stream, |

The results of tests of the core with inlet guide
vanes for eliminating the rotational flow com-

ponent are presented in Fig. 1.6. The induced

axial pressure gradient was removed, and the

_amount of flow reversal along the inner wall was

decreased. As in the first series, the flow was

~essentially two-dimensional; that is, no appreci-
-able radial component existed.

from Fig. 1.7 that the amount of flow reversal was
further reduced. '

In another series of tests (series 8) flow re-

versal was eliminated from station 6 downward
by use of a greater radial velocity component.
The configuration of series 8 was used for two
brief tests that simulated the one-fuel-pump-out

condition. Preliminary results’ md:cate that flow
conditions change very litile, ’rhe percentage of

flow separation remaining approxmately the same

as for the two-pump condition.

Data are taken from the metal core test rig by
means of wall static pressure taps and claw probe
traverses. The latter read total pressure and flow
direction but are limited to measuring flow which
is two-dimensional. As stronger turbulators are

designed and radial velocity components become
greater, accurate data will be mcreasmgly more

TIME AFTER INITIAL SIGNAL AT INLET PROBE (sec)

Fig. 1.8. Transit Time for Flow Between Core Inlet and Outlet.

Studies were made of the flow of water through
the transparent plastic mode!l by injecting a dye
at various points, The header, at the time of
these tests, was designed to produce two,
meshing, helical vortexes through the flow
chamber, Several combinations of chemicals for
imparting color changes were considered. The
most satisfactory one, by far, was a combination
of starch, iodine, and sodium thiosulfate., For the
tests the model was filled with a starch solution,
which was transparent prior to the injection of
the dye, the dye being an iodine solution (a
safurated solution of iodine in methyl alcohol).
After the dye was injected, transparency could
again be obtained in the closed system by the
injection of a clearing agent. The clearing agent
was a saturated solution of sodium thiosulfate in
water, The study was made by alternately in-
jecting the dye and the clearing agent. The dark
blue cloud resulting from the dye injection was

' f_transported with the water. The general choracter-
‘istics of the flow could be observed, and, in
‘particular, the flow at various points could be
noted. In one way the action of the clearing agent
was ‘superior to that of the dye: those areas

where turbulence was least were the last ones

28

to be cleared of the dye. Photographs were taken
of the tests, but they have not yet been analyzed.
Visual observations indicated that the water
circulated about the vertical axis of the core, with
the greater portion of the mass mckmg from four
to seven revolutions in passage. There was
upward flow in the upper hemisphere near the
island, but very good mixing appeared to prevail
throughout most of the core. An extensive series
of pictures of flow in both cores is scheduled for
completion in September. |

Core Design Analyses

W. T. Furgerson
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division
Interest in core designs with lower degrees of
divergence than that of the present 21-in. design

prompted a study of the effect of inlet annulus

dimensions on the adverse pressure gradients

encountered by the fuel in flowmg from the core
inlet to the equator. Any core desngn in which’

the area perpendicular to the flow mcreases along

the flow path will have adverse pressure gradlen’rs'

resulting from conversion of Velocdy head to
static head. If the flow entering the core has a
rotational component, an additional axial pressure

gradient will be induced through fluid friction
effects, |f the rotational component is centered
about the core axis, the induced gradient is
favorable along the outer wall and adverse along
the island, In each case, the gradient is algebrai-

cally additive to the gradients brought about by

area change. Since, all other things being equal,
flow separation is favored by higher relative
pressure gradients, the result is a tendency for
flow to separate from the island.

The effect of increasing the outside radius of
the present 21-in. core inlet on the two relative
pressure gradients along the island wall is illus-
trated in Fig. 1.9. The divergence gradient de-
creases because of the decreased divergence of
the core, but the induced gradient increases,
principally because of the increased ratio of inlet
radii. '

Further study was made of the noise which was

~ present in the initial testing and which was
- suspected to be cavitation noise. It has been
- determined that the noise was not primarily due

fo4f|uid'cdv'iﬂfaf'i6n but, rather, to a local flow

'&condmon that ex:sted at the tongue of the pump
volute. This was established by the use of a

carbon microphone probe. A circuit was devised
‘50 fhat the microphone signal could be observed

~-ona cafhode-ray oscilloscope. With this arrange-
‘_ment the region of maximum noise was located
_near the volute tongue. The absence of cavitation

was further indicated by no observable decrease
in efficiency when the pump was operated at the
design point under conditions of varying pump

_suction pressure. The pump suction pressure was
'varled from approxlmafely 11 to O psig with a

a’rer temperature of approximately 70°F. The

-~ vapor pressure ‘of the water at 70°F corresponds

to that of fuel at a temperature of 1535°F, which
is well above the maximum fuel pump suction
temperature expected. '

Analyses of the data from the pump performance
tests indicated the need for additional flow area
in the pump volute, The particular evidence for
this was the imbalance of hydraulic forces around
the periphery of the impeller at the design point
and the occurrence of design-speed maximum ef-
ficiency at approximately 20% less than the design
flow.

A design change in the reactor north head for
structural reasons allowed the pump volute flow
area to be increased; however, this increase did
not compensate for the increase in the fuel flow

rate required for improved heat exchanger per-

formance. To obtain the additional required flow
area, the pump volute was redesigned without

- diffuser cones.

R_esulfs ‘of water performance tests with the
redesigned pump volute indicated excessive re-

- circulatory losses between the impeller discharge
" .and suction volumes. The impeller lower shroud

was therefore modified to allow the 12 radial

slingers to be lengthened to the full impeller
_diameter in order to increase their developed back

circulatory loss, the impeller axial clearance was

reduced from 0.102 to 0.053 in. The results of
this modification are shown in Fig. 1.12, '

It may be seen from Fig. 1.12 that the desngn
point lies in the region of maximum efficiency.
The noise present with the earlier volute design
was eliminated, and the condition of hydraulic
force balance on the impeller occurs near design
speed and flow.

Controls and Instrumentation

A flow sheet has been prepared that shows,
schematically, the locations of the instrumentation
and control components,  Control-panel layout
studies“are being made. Elementary-control elec-
trical wiring diagrams are being prepared to
provide control actions in accordance with infor-
mation block diagrams, which show control func-
tions independent of control techniques or hardware
types. The selection of control technigues and
the specifications for component hardware are
being worked out. Apparently no fundamentally
new development work, except for special sensors,
will be necessary to meet control requirements,
although heat load responses may require the use
of some controls not previously required for
reactors,

The linear equipment for an ORNL reactor
simulator has been assembled and tested, Com-
pletion of the nonlinear simulator equipment is
scheduled for September 1, 1955, with the delivery
of special components from Reeve Electronics,
Inc. One of the major objectives of the simulation
is the determination of the control system re-
sponse requirements under emergency conditions.

Two instrument test loops are being prepared
for checking special sensors, including thermo-
couples, flowmeters, pressure indicators, and the
tachometers. Arrangements are also being made
for testing the fuel-level indicator.

Conceptual designs have been worked out for
the rod-drive mechanism, the enricher actuating

The most important objectives of this experiment
are to develop assembly techniques for use on
the ART, to furnish some information on thermal
stresses in the reactor assembly, to obtain some
heat transfer information on the radiators and the

some of the instrumentation to be used on the

REACTOR PHYSICS
Control Rod Heating and Burnup

W. J. Fader
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A. M. Per‘ry

Electronuclear Research Division

Calculations of control rod heating and burnup
to be expected in the ART were completed. The
rod designs considered included cylindrical annuli
of various rare-earth oxides, ]3/8--in. OD, either
7/8- or ]]/B-in. ID, and ](4 or 1/8 in. in annular
thickness. The maximum density of the heat
generated by gamma-ray absorption in the 141—in.
annulus was found to be about 140 w/cm?, of
which 15 w/em® was due to gamma rays produced
in the core; the remainder was due to neutron
capture gamma rays produced in the rod. The
heat generated in a %-in. annulus was found to
be about two-thirds of that generated in the Z-in.
annulus. Temperatures in the rod material depend
on whether the rod is fabricated of fused oxide
or of a cermet. For a Z-in.-’rhick fused oxide rod,
the temperature rise is expected to be 620°F if
the rod is cooled at both the inner and the outer
surface and to be 2300°F if it is cooled only at
the outer surface. Correspondmg temperature
rises for the cermet are very much smaller: 20

. and 54°F, respectively, if the conductivity of the
cermet is assumed to be the same as that of iron.

The heat fluxes are large: 140,000 Btu/ft2.hr if
the rod is cooled at both surfaces, 230,000

Btu/ft2.hr if it is cooled at fhe= outer surfoce

only.
The thickness of the poison material required

to allow for burnup by neutron absorption depends |

on the'cbundcnce of high cross-section isotopes
in the rare earth and on the density of the rare-
ear’rh oxide, which would be greater for the fused
ceramic rod than for the cermet. Calculated pene-

For a ]/4-in. annular control rod of BAOC in
copper (30 vol % B,C), the burnup penetration
would be one-sixth as great as that in a europium
oxide cermet, but the heat produced would be
one-third greater. All these considerations are
based on a neutron current of 2.5 x 1014
neutrons/cm?.sec into the rod.

ART Boron Layer
A. M. Perry

Flectronuclear Research Division

The boron layer (assumed to be made of B;OC
tiles) between the reflector and the fuel-to-NaK
heat exchanger was examined with respect to heat
generation, flux attentuation, helium gas evo-
lution, and burnup.? Heating will be largely due
to the alpha particles from the B19(n,a)Li? re-
action and will amount to about 13 w/cm? of tile
(40,000 Btu/ft2.hr). The heat flux per unit area

will be one-half this amount, since both surfaces

of the tile will be adjacent to cooled surfaces;
thus the temperature rise for radiative heat -

transfer will be about 500°F. The absorption
mean free path of thermal neutrons (1200°F)

B;OC with a density of 2.5 g/em® is 0.0017 in.,
while that of 3-kev neutrons (near the sodium
resonance) is 0.145 in. If the BlOC layer were
made 1 in., thick to absorb sodium resonance
neutrons, gamma-ray heating of the layer would
increase the total heat produced by only 30%.
The flux of about 4 x 103 neu'rrons/cm2 ec

" absorbed over an area of 4 x 10¢ em? yields a

theoretical helium gas evolution rate of 5

liters/day (STP) Burnup of the boron will be

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

experiment and the ART with respect to the
factors that determine the critical concentration
of UF'4 in the fuel mixture. The differences that
may have a significant effect on the critical
concentration are: (1) control rod position: the
ART will be made critical with the control rod

inserted fcrther than it was in the high- -temperature

_ -'crlhcal experiment; (2) beryllium density: cooling
. holes in the ART reflector will reduce the moder-
--;'cn‘or densny, (3) reflector poisoning: sodium
 coolant in the reflector will increase neutron
dbs'orpﬁ'oris' in the reflector; (4) reflector size:

in order to minimize machining of beryllium for

" the experiment, the reflector was made in an

irregular rectangular shape circumscribing the
design reflector and had a somewhat larger volume
than that of the ART reflector. The effects of
these differences are estimated in the following
paragraphs. |

The ART will be made critical ot 1200°F with
the control rod withdrawn about 1.5% in A% from
its fully inserted position, The control rod cali-
bration of the high-temperature critical experiment,
carried to a point 4 in. above the mid-plane of
the reactor, appears to be consistent with an
over-all rod value of about 5% in Ak. Thus, the
Ak inserted at critical will be about 3.5%. The
increment in concenfration necessary to com-
pensate for the initial rod insertion is thus about
7 x 3.5, which is ~24%. The initial rod position,
of course, is, to some extent, at the discretion
of the operators, and the increment in critical
concentration could, if desired, be chosen to be
less than 24% — say 18 or 20% — to correspond
to an initial rod insertion of 2.5 to 3%.

Since the change in beryllium density is not
uniform, the cooling holes being more closely
spaced near the core, it is necessary to calculate
a weighted average density change. This was
done in two ways., From two-group perturbation
theory, the importance of a change in the fast-
group diffusion coefficient or in the group-transfer
cross section is approximately proportional to the
square of the fast flux. The quantity U,(r) was
obtained by adding multigroup fluxes, and 1,[!2 was
used as a weighting . function.  An c!ternate

‘weighting function was obtained by computing the
- slowing- down density by means of age theory.
““In this case the weighting function at radius r
Colis opphed to the average density change in the
o spherlcal she” befween the core and the spherical

surface of radius r, rather than to the local density
change at r. Average density changes computed
in these two ways are 4.2 and 3.5%, respectively.
The reactivity effects of a uniform density change
in beryllium have been computed by Curtiss-Wright
Corp. to be 0.42% in reactivity for 1% in density,>
and by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft to be 0.35% in
reactivity for 1% in density.? Based on these
figures, an average reactivity change of —-1.5%
is predicted. Data from the high- fempérafure
critical experiment indicate (AM/M)/(Ak/k) to be
about 7. Thus a change in critical concentration
of 10.5% is anticipated as a result of the reduction
of the beryllium density. |

The effect of thermal-neutron absorptions in the
sodium coolant was estimated by comparing the
calculations of the Curtiss-Wright Corp.> for
Inconel-lined and unlined cooling holes.  The
penalty in uranium concentration due to the
Inconel was reduced in the ratio of the macro-
scopic thermal neutron gbsorption cross sections
of the sodium and the Inconel. When allowance
was made for the greater number of cooling holes
presently planned for the ART, the increment of
fuel concentration required to compensate for the
sodium in the reflector was 5.6%.

The effect of the additional beryllium in the
reflector of the high-temperature critical experi-
ment has not yet been satisfactorily computed.
This is due, in part, to the irregular distribution
of the added beryllium and, in part, to some
uncertainty regarding the dependence of reactivity
on reflector thickness. Whether the entire re-
flector volume is considered or only the portion
between two planes 1 ft above and below the
equatorial plane of the reactor, the beryllium in
the experiment was about 3 in, thicker, on the
average, than the beryllium in the design reflector
of the ART. According to the parametric studies
of Curtiss-Wright Corp.,> such a decrease in
reflector thickness over the whole surface of a
spherical reactor would increase the critical con-
centration by a factor of 1.26. Results of the
cold critical experiments, however, indicate that
removing 3 in. of beryllium over the region ex-
tending 1 ft above and below the reactor mid-plane

should increase the conceniration by about a
factor of 1.12. The true effect is believed to lie
between these extremes.

~ The over-all factor by which the critical con-
centration of the ART is likely to exceed that
of the high-temperature critical experiment is

_dbtained by multiplying the four factors together.

The result is

F = (1,2)(1.])(],06)(1912) = 1.56 ,
if the low estimates for control rpd allowance and
reflector size effect 'qr'é; ‘empléyed, or

F o= (1.25)(L1)(1.06)(1.26) = 1.84 ,
if the high estimates are used. Since the clean
critical concentration of the experiment was 2.9
mole % UF , the critical conceniration of the ART
is expected to fall between the limits 4.6 and
5.4 mole %. Some multigroup calculations are
to be undertaken, in the near future, which should
help to establish the critical concentration of the
ART somewhat more reliably.

The code will compute fluxes as a function of

IN-PILE LOOP DEVELOPMENT AND TESTS

Loop Installation

C. W. Cunningham

The instrument panel for the MTR in-pile loop
was installed on the first level balcony on the
reactor north face. This location is advantageous
in that it is above the activity on the main floor
and relatively close to the HB-3 beam hole. Pro-
vision of a central balcony extension for the oper-
ator enabled him to easily observe the instrument
and control panel in the somewhat restricted space,
The additional instrument panels and cabinets
were Iocated on balcony extensions at each end of
the instrument and control panel.

" The auxiliary equipment and the loop, on its
cradle, were placed on the main floor, largely

36

under and adjacent to the east face stairway.

Interconnecting tubes and wires were protected
by running them in troughs hung beneath the bal-
cony and the stairway above head level. The
tubes and wires to the loop were lifted into these
troughs after the loop was inserted into the beam
hole.

A means for flux compensation had to be pro-
vided, since the flux profile at the HB-3 beam hole
was not known with certainty, A loop retractor
mechanism was built and was mounted in the HB-3
cubicle to permit withdrawal of the loop plug 6 in,
from the fully inserted position. This device
permits adjustment of the loop nose position in the
tapering flux region and, thus, variation of the
loop power level independently of reactor opera-
tion. The retractor also serves as a safety device.
By withdrawing the plug 6 in. and reducing the
process air flow, reactor operation could continue
in the event the in-pile loop experiment had to be
operated on the limited, emergency, cooling-air
supply. The ability to preset the position of the
plug greatly reduces the risk of freezing or over-
heating the loop during the reactor startup and
shutdown,

Orderly arrangement of lines and equipment in
the cubicle presented a difficult problem. The
lead shields, retractor mechanism, tubing cutoff
block, tubing and electrical wires, and hoses
almost completely filled the available cubicle
space. The problem was further complicated by
the movement required for retraction. A workable
arrangement was found by trial and error movement
of the lines and tubes into various coiled configu-
rations. The water hose had fo be carefully routed
to eliminate excessive strain on the quick-discon-
nect fittings provided to eliminate the leakage of
radioactive process water,

facility at NRTS.

It successfully passed the pre-

operational checks required by the MTR Reactor

Safeguards Committee, and it was then inserted
into the HB-3 beam hole from the special loading
cradle supplied as part of the experiment, Fuel
e[ements adjacent to the beam hole were removed
for the insertion, since no shielding was provided.

Although a rather high radiation beam was meas-

ured adjacent to the in-pile loop plug shield, it
was well collimated, and the insertion proceeded
rapidly and smoothly without the coffin,

. The startup of the loop proceeded systematically
through pump operation and preheating of the fuel
and the piping. At the final step, melting of the
freeze line and charging of the loop, the heater for
the freeze line was found to be inoperable. An
internal short, to ground, had developed after the
preoperational checkout. Efforts to clear the short
were unsuccessful, and it was impossible to melt
the line by increasing the power to adjacent
heaters, This terminated the loop operation, and
the loop was removed from the beam hole for return
to ORNL. Since this loop had been reworked re-
peatedly during the initial assembly, it was deemed
to be irrepairable and was therefore cut up for
evaluation,

The short was fo}uhd in a nipple, or extension,
from the pump bulkhead to the glass seal for the
power leads. Braided glass insulation had become
frayed, apparently during assembly, and the copper
lead wire was eprsed ‘Mechanical separation

Horizontal-Shaft Sump Pump
J. A, Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The difficulties previously encountered with the
shaft seals of the horizontal-shaft sump pump have
been corrected. The original seal used a thin,
brass bellows, which failed mechanically. It was
replaced with a stainless steel bellows, which
serves both as the flexible member of the seal
and the loading spring, It was necessary that the
beliows serve as the loading spring because the
combined spring loading of the steel bellows and
a spring would have been excessive. However,
the spring-loaded bellows caused chatter between
the graphite nose and the mating seal ring, and
the graphite crumbled. The installation of friction
dampers, in the form of spring-loaded steel plugs
that pressed radiqlly against the outside of the
seal nose, eliminated this difficulty.

The maximum gas diffusion leakage rate for this
seal has been found to be 100 ppm of argon dif-
fusing from the pump sump into the helium in the
bearing housing. The flow rate of both the helium
and the argon is 700 cfh, Satisfactory seal leakage
rates could not be obtained consistently with the
initial drip lubrication system; so the oil level in
the bearing housing was raised until the lower
edges of the running faces of the seal were im-
mersed, This provided a better oil film on the
seal mating faces, and satisfactory sealing condi-
tions were obtained.

A prototype model of the in-pile pump operated
satisfactorily, with the fuel mixture NaF- -ZrF ,-UF

(53.5-40.6.5 mole %) as the pumped fluid, for

173 hr at 1400°F in an isothermal loop identical

Samples of Gulf Hcrmony ““A" oil were irradiated
at the gamma facility of the MTR to determine the
suitability of this oil for use in the lubrication and
hydraulic power systems of the in-pile loop. Cal-

the viscosity increased about 60 to 90%. In a few

S The mu|or cause of failure of these fused-salt

 

 

.Ioops has been the freezeup of fhe sclf in fhei

coolmg conl when flow was mferrupted for any

reason. " Most flow m’rerrupnons resuH from loss

of power, either at the test rig or in the building
as a whole. The freezing of the cooling coils has
occurred in times as short as 30 sec. Preliminary

tests have shown that a gas flame automatically

1gnn‘ed at the time of an interruption of the coolmg
air will prevent freezmg for perlods of 5 min or

more. Several methods of automatic |gmhon of

such a flome were tried, but the only one which
appears to give the surety of lgmhon requared is a
high-resistance heater coil in the gas stream; the
coil is energized from a 12-v, wet-cell circuit.

Nme forced-circulation loops were operated with
sodium in Inconel and in stainless steel tubing.
A summary of the conditions of operation of these
loops is given in Table 2.2, The loops were
heated with electric heaters, and each loop had
an economizer section. The results of metal-
lurgical examination of these loops are presented
in Sec. 5, ‘‘Corrosion Research.”

A new test loop has been designed with which
it will be possible to obtain accurate information
on the oxygen content of sodium during operation.
The test system, as indicated in Fig. 2.1, consists
of a main loop, which includes the sodium-sampling
device and a bypass cold trap, and a plugging-
indicator loop, with its separate pump and flow-
meter, (The plug indicator is described in a sub-

sequent portion of this section,) The cooling rate
of the entire loop can be controlled to a fraction of

a degree per minute. The oxygen content of the
sodium circulating in the main loop is controlied

by use of the bypass cold trap. The plugging-

indicator loop and the sampling device are both

7 used to :ndependenﬂy defermme the oxygen content
" and thus to determine the effic:ency of ’rhe cold' B

trap.

In order to use the pluggmg-lndlcator loop, them

valve between that loop and the main loop is
opened, and sodium is allowed to flow from the
main loop until the plugging- mdlcofor loop is
filled to a predetermined level in the surge fank.

the low specified leakage rate has not been met,
and only four seals had rates lower than 1 em3/hr.
It was noted that the Fulton Sylphon seal was not
balanced, and the resulting pressure changes
caused variable performance of the seal, Repro-

The lower journal bearing of the pump was de-
signed initially to carry loads of up to 600 b, but
hydraulic studies revealed that the expected
bearing load would be 150 ib or less.. With the
lower loads it appears to be feasible to employ
Inconel as the journal material and to thus obviate
the need for a hardened journal bushing, Tests 1,
2, 3, and 8 were conducted in the bearing and seal
testing facility, and loads up to 300 Ib were satis-
factorily carried by the Inconel shaft in a bronze

mine the effect of the left-hand threads used in
the flow breakdown annulus. With a radial clear-
ance of 10 mils and thread depth of 37 mils, a by-
pass flow rate of 2.3 gpm was measured at a pump
speed of 2700 rpm; the main circuit flow rate was
approximately 630 gpm. Increasing the radial
clearance to 15 mils gave the desired flow rate of
4,77 gpm.

The data obtained in the water tests will be use-
ful in analyzing the data obtained at high tempera-
tures, since it will be difficult to measure dis-
charge pressures when the system is operating at
high temperature. Throttling orifices for the loop
were calculated to give a 50-ft head at 650 gpm.
Data obtained in the water tests indicate a flow
rate of 650 gpm at a 46-ft head. The test loop is
now being readied for operation at the design tem-
perature, 1400°F,

ance data, and cavitation and vibration characteris-
tics will be noted. An endurance test will then be
run at design head and flow rate, The xenon-
removal system, inCIuding the helium-bleed and
o:l !eakage-removal sysfems, is to be incorporated
in the circuit for checking in conjunction with the
main fluid circuit. One of the two test stands will
be available for acceptance testing of the final

__MF-2 rotary assemblies with NaK.,

A concentric p[pe des:gn was chosen for the
test stand loop to eliminate thermal stresses from
nonuniform heating or cooling, to reduce the num-

bet of critical welds, und to provide a compact

assembly, The compactnessof the cssembly makes
possible a low fuel inventory.

A conventional venturi is located 15 pipe diam-
eters (60 in.) downstream from the pump volute
discharge, and a piston-type throttle valve is
located downstream of the venturi. The valve
travel was specified within the recommended travel
of a suitable bellows used as the valve-stem seal.
This valve cannot be fully closed; therefore, as
presently conceived, the minimum loop resistance,
with the valve wide open, will permit testing at
about one-half the rated pump head with rated flow,
and the maximum loop resistance, with the valve
closed, will permit testing at approximately one-
half the rated flow with the pump delivering the
rated head.

A screen-type, axial-baffle, flow=control device
is provided just below the inlet to the impeller to
prevent an uneven velocity profile and prerotation
in the stream entering the pump. To simulate the
fluid-expansion and xenon-removal region, a sepa-
rate chamber is provided above the top plate of the

pump volute. Fluid enters and leaves this chamber

only through the pump barrel wall, and this cham-
ber is not directly connected to the pump inlet

" chamber except through the impeller. The rise in

level of the fluid in this chamber for a 100°F in-
crease in the temperature of the fuel mixture will
be about the same as that for the ART.

During steady-state high-temperature operation,
the pumping power will be removed by blowing a
high-volume low-pressure air siream transversely

across the outer loop pipe. A power failure will

After the heat exchanger had been removed and
replaced with piping, operahon of the NGK system
was resumed. The NaK was circulated for 15 hr
at 1500°F and then drained while hot, Since the
NaK contained fuel contamination, it was rep[aced
with fresh NaK, and the second cold trap test de-
scribed above was made. However, the operation

radiators, described prevnously,6 developed a leak.
During the last 55 hr of operation, a “steady in-
crease in the NaK pressure drop across the radiators
was noted, The pressure drop increase coincided
with startup of the radiator blowérs, which caused

the radiators., The increase in pressure drop,
along with a gradual decrease in NaK flow at a
constant pump speed, could only mean that some
of the r_adlc’ror tubes were pluggmg. These plugged

 

gl

tubes were cooled by the air flow from the blower,
with the result that there were low-temperature
regions in the otherwise high-temperature radiator

were probably of significance in the ultimate
failure of the one radiator unit, The radiator that
failed is shown in Fig. 2,7.

The fuel that leaked into the NaK circuit after
the heat exchanger failure was not flushed out
during the 15-hr period of circulation of the NaK
after the removal of the heat exchanger. The
analysis of the black material scraped from the
fins of the NaK-to-air radiator when it was being
examined after the leak occurred showed 34%
zirconium and 0.25% uranium; the remainder of the

. 'material was sodium, potassium, iron, nickel,

chromium, and copper.

The NaK circuit was cleaned by the Materials
Chemistry Division. A total of 4.2 g of zirconium,
0.46 g of uranium, and 3939 g (8.6 |b) of Inconel

‘was removed in the cleaning operation. Two 5%

nitric acid washes removed 87% of the uranium,
and one wash with 2% ammonium bifluoride and
2.5% nitric acid, a highly corrosive agent, removed

82% of the zirconium, 'qu ammonium bifluoride
and nitric acid washes removed 90% of the Inconel.

this period of operation the efficiency of the NaK-
to-air radiator used as a heat dump dropped con-
tinuously for approximately 360 hr and then im-
proved suddenly. Samples taken from the NaK
sump tank at the completion of the test indicated
a very high oxygen content in the NaK (approxi-
mately 2500 ppm). A circulating cold trap has
been designed and will be installed on future
test assemblies in an effort to remove oxides
from the NaK.

Assembly of two, new, small heat exchanger
test stands is opproximately 25% complete. Each
of these stands has a 500-kw electric heat source
and will be used to test six 20.tube heat ex-
changers, Two heat exchangers are being fabri-
cated by ORNL and four have been ordered from
outside vendors.

A 25-tube heat exchanger is being designed,
with ART tube sizes and spacing, that will be
operated at ART design temperature and flow
conditions. [t is proposed to procure five of these
units from outside vendors. A block diagram of
the design operating conditions for this group
of heat exchanger tests is presented in Fig. 2.10.

The third test to be operated in the sodium-
beryllium-Inconel compatibility testing apparatus,
described previously,” was started on July 14,
1955. The test section consists of a beryllium
cylinder drilled centrally with a };‘-in.-dia hole
through which sodium can flow. The loop was
operated isothermally at 1100°F for 100 hr, with
a sodium flow of 3 gpm, ond then shut down on
July 18, 1955, because of the failure of the 250-kw
transformer. The loop was restarted on August 27,
1955, with a projected operating period of 1000 hr
with 100 thermal cycles. One cycle represents
4 hr of operation at high power, during which the
sodium enters the test section at 1150°F and is
heated electrically to 1300°F, and 4 hr of operation
at low power, during which the sodium enters the
test section at slightly less than 1300°F and
leaves at 1300°F,

COLD TRAPS ANDPLUG |NVDICA-T0RVS'
F. A. Anderé_on
University of Mississippi
J. J. Milich
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A survey of the literature and of the available
experimental data was undertaken to obtain infor-

“mation on the use of cold traps as devices for
removing or controlling the presence of undesir

able impurities, especially oxygen, in sodium-

‘or NaK«filled Inconel systems and on the use of

plugging indicators as devices for determining
the oxygen content of sodium or MaK streams.
In addition to information obtained from the litera-
ture, supplementary data were obtained during

" visits to the Knolls Atomic Power Ldboratory,

Argonne National L aboratory, Mine Safety Appli-
ances Company, and North American Aviation,

Although both diffusion and circulating cold
traps have been shown to be capable of reducing
the oxide content of liquid sodium or NaK to values
corresponding to the saturation concentrations at
the cold trap temperatures, specific data are not
available which will permit sound engineering
designofcoldtraps. Diffusion or natural-convection
cold traps do their work much more slowly than cir-
culating or forced-circulation traps and, so far,
have been of primary interest only in relatively
small-volume systems (up to a few gallons capac-
ity). The existence of fairly strong eddy currents
in diffusion cold traps is suspected. If such
currents existed, their effects would overshadow
completely the effect of natural diffusion. It is
evident that experimental work would be required
to obtain a basis for the design of diffusion cold
traps.

Circulating cold traps have the important advan-
tage of lowering the oxide concentration of a sys-
tem rapidly. Present conventional designs that
provide for holdup times of 5 min and superficial
liquid velocities of the order of 3 fpm give system
cleanup times that correspond to three system
charge turnovers through the trap. Cold traps
having volumes ranging from about 3 to 10% of
the volume of the system have been utilized suc-
cessfully. Although microporous filters are con-
sidered to be unsatisfactory in cold traps, the
use of a packing material such as York demister
packing has been shown to raise cold trap effi-
ciencies from 68 to about 98%.

Packing is used

L

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

* to provide sufficient surface to hold the precipi-

. tated oxide, but it is not intended to function as
' a filter medium, _

On the basis of the collected data and arbitrary

i° specifications, three circulating cold traps have

been designed, one for a relatively large, 80-gal
system and two for a relatively small, 4000-ml
(~1-gal) system, Figs. 2.13, 2.14, and 2.15. These
designs are not necessarily optimum; that is, it
is felt that they will lower the oxygen content
: of the system, but they may be larger than neces-
sary and may have more cooling or heating capacity
than that required. The traps are expected to
operate at 400°F and to reduce the oxygen con-
tent of the main liquid metal system to the cor-
responding saturation value of 50 ppm. During
operation, precautions must be observed to prevent
the saturation temperature of the liquid metal
with respect to oxide (Na,0) content being reached
* ~ at any point in the system other than in the cold
trap. If the saturation temperature were reached
outside the cold trap, precipitation of oxide would
occur at that point and plugging of a pipe or some
other sysfem component would occur.

Because of the difficulty of making rehoble de-
terminations of the oxide content of molten sodium
or NaK by chemical procedures, considerable use
-~ has been made of the plugging indicator as a

- simple device for determining the oxide content
indirectly. Although there is some disagreement

as to the exact significance of the results, in-
vestigators at KAPL feel that the use of a plugging
indicator is a reliable and accurate method for
determining oxide contents to within 10.001%.
Unfortunately, as in the case of cold traps, the
design of plugging indicators is, at the present
time, more of an art than a science. Because the
design first used at KAPL proved to be satisfac-
tory, and because of lack of time, no effort has
been made to determine whether a better design
could be developed.

A plugging indicator consists of a perforated
plate (containing 15 to 21 holes 50 mils in diam-
eter) placed in a l-in. line through which molten
metal flows at the rate of 1 gpm (~10 fps through
the indicator plate holes). The flowing stream
is cooled until the oxide saturation point is reached,
at which time precipitation occurs. When the pre-
cipitated oxide partially plugs the perforated
plate, a change in the flow rate occurs. The
temperature at the plate corresponding to the
change in flow rate, measured with an electro-
magnetic flowmeter, is taken to be the plugging
temperature,  Although this temperature can be
used as a relative indication of the purity of the
liquid metal stream, it is common practice to
translate the plugging temperature into an oxide
concentration by means of a solubility curve.
A recommended design for a plugging indicator
and a bypass loop is shown in Fig. 2.16.

¥ EXPERIMENTS "

 

A c:rmcal assembly of the reflector-moderated

- _circulating-fuel reactor loaded with sufficient
if-f"}siUz’?’fs to give about 3% excess reactivity was de-
'scrlbed prevuously.

After the completion of a
sferles “of experlmenfs in which the excess reac-

““tivity was utilized to measure certain reactivity

coefficients and the effects of various structure

changes, the assembly was reloaded in order to

determine the clean critical concentration more

exactly. With the same structure and dimensions

as those reported previously, the U235 concen-
tration was reduced from 0.416 to 0.345 g per cubic
centimeter of fuel region, equivalent to a loading
of 20,07 kg of U233, and the assembly (CA-21-2)
was critical with only 0.14% excess reactivity.
This assembly is compared in Table 3.1 with the
assembly (CA-21-1) which had 3% excess reac-
tivity.

Two structural changes in the assembly have
also been investigated. In one modification (as-
sembly CA-22) the average width of one of the
end ducts, the portion of the assembly that simu-
lates the fuel flow channels into the reactor core,
was increased from 1.29 to 2.80 in. to make its

volume almost 2.5 times that of the originally

constructed end duct. This change was made
because consideration is being given in the re-
actor design to the possibility of using end ducts
of larger cross section, The increased fuel capac-

ity of the assembly necessitated the addition of

U235 in the end ducts, which made a total of
28.35 kg of U233 gt an average density of 0.405 g

;_of_u U_2_35 per cubic centimeter of fuel material.

The array was crmcal wn‘h 3 2% excess recchvny, '

and the estimated ‘‘clean” critical mass was

24 £ 2kgof U235

In another experiment (CA-23), with end ducts of
the original size, the average radius of the central
psuedo-spherical beryllium region or ‘‘island’ was
increased from 5.18 to 7.19 in., with a correspond-
ing reduction in the fuel volume of from 58.2 to
44.3 liters. The use of a thinner fuel annulus is
being considered in the reactor design as a means
of reducing fuel self-shielding. The beryllium
content of the core was increased from 67 to 92 kg,
including that in the end ducts. This assembly
was critical with a loading of 18.62 kg of U235
at an average density of 0.420 g of U235 per cubic
centimeter of fuel region. The excess reactivity
was 0.19%, and the estimated critical mass, with-

out control rods, was 18.4 kg of U235, The di-

mensions of assemblies CA-22 and CA-23 are given
in Table 3.1, along with the data obtained with
these assemblies.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE

CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A low-nuclear-power, high-temperature, reflector-
moderated-reactor critical experiment is currently
under way, and some preliminary results have been
obtained. The liquid fuel in the assembly is at
1200°F. The reactor section of the equipment
closely resembles the current design of the ART.

It consists, essentially, of an annular fuel region

separated from the beryllium islané"an'cl' reflector
by ]/B-in.-'rhick Inconel core shells. The island,
partly surrounded by the inner Inconel shell, is
shown in Fig. 3.1. The outer shell, with some
of the beryllium reflector in place, is shown in
Fig. 3.2, A re-entrant tube is mounted along the

vertical axis of the reactor to serve as a guide

for the annular control-safety rod, which contains
a mixture of the oxides of the rare-earth elements.
The rod is magnetically supported and can be
positioned above the horizontal mid-plane for con-
trol. It is free to fall below the mid-plane for

 

reactor shutdown. The outside diameter of the
neutron-absorber section of the rod is 1.28 in.,
and the annulus is T/8 in. wide. The density of
the neutron-absorber compact is 6.5 g/cm?; its
principal constituents are Sm,0, (63.8 wt %) and
Gd,0, (26.3 wt %). The support and the driving
rod for the neutron source are coaxial with the
control rod. The beryllium blocks in the reflector
and the island are in an atmosphere of helium;
there is no sodium in the system.

The reactor is mounted above a reservoir for
the liquid fuel, which is a mixture of the fluorides
of sodium, zirconium, and enriched (93% U235)
uranium. The fuel is transferred to the reactor
by applying helium under pressure to the liquid
surface in the reservoir; the return to the reservoir
is by gravity. The temperature of the system has
been raised to 1350°F by electrical heaters located
external to the reflector and the fuel reservoir.
The completed assembly is shown in Fig. 3.3.

After an initial test of system operation and
leak tightness with an equimolar mixture of NaF
and ZrF,, successive increments of Na,UF, were
added until the reactor became critical, The fuel
concentration was then 6.30 wt % (2.87 mole %)
vranium, and the excess reactivity, determined
from the subsequent calibration of the control rod,
was about 0.13% Ak/k. A measurement of the
over-all temperature coefficient of reactivity be-
tween 1150 and 1350°F showed the value to be
negative and equal to 2 x 10=5 (AR/E)/°F. An
increase in the uranium concentration of the fuel
from 6.30 to 6.88 wt % resulted in an increase in
reactivity of 1.3% Ak/k. The control rod has a
value of 1.7% Ak/k when inserted to a point 4 in.
above the mid-plane. ' ‘

liquidus temperature was found to be abouf 390°C.
Recently obtained thermal analysis data showed
that the Li, ZrF -Li,ZrF, eutectic melts at about
580°C. S:nce Li,ZrF ; is the primary phase of the
mleure con’rammg 3] mole % ZrF,, the Li,ZrF

i eufechc must contcun less than 31 mole % of ZrF4.

No L|3ZrF7 was found in quenched samples con-

rtammg 33.3 mole % ZrF, over the range 530 to
'619°C, and thus it was confirmed that Li o ZrF
_melts congruenfly. The melting point of Li ZrF
~was found, by thermal analysis, to be about 587°C

Thermal and differential thermal analysis data

_indicated that a eutectic is formed by the mixture
- with about 50 mole % ZrF,, The primary phase of

. the mixture with 48 mole % ZrF, was found, by

. 'quenchmg, to be leszé, the liquidus temperature
o was  522°C, and the solidus temperature was

f508°C The existence of L|22rF and L|3Zr4F19

%

in these samples was confirmed by x-ray diffrac-
tion examination, The Li,ZrF -Li,Zr F,, eutec-
tic appears to contain abouf 48 mole % ZrF, and
to melt at 508°C,

The experiments reported previously! seemed to
narrow down the composition of the unknown phase
in the mixture with more than 50 mole % ZrF
either Li,Zr,F,, (60 mole % ZrF,) or LisZr,Fy
(57.1 mole % ZrF4) Other experiments confirmed
this conclusion, but no decision between the two
formulas could be reached on the basis of the
quenching experiments. However, analogy to the
NoF-ZrF, system indicated LiyZr,F,, to be the
more probob[e, and it has been estcblished inother
experiments (described below) that Na,Zr F19 and
Li,Zr,F o belong to the same crystcl system and
form a complete solid-solution series,

Another phase (cubic) has sometimes appeared
in quenched samples in the region above 50 mole %

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

ZrF, ot temperatures at which liquid would be
expected to be present, A differential thermal
analysis break at 580°C was thought at first
to be associated with this phase. However,
quench growth and well-crysfalllzed ZrF, were
found in quenched samples containing 57] 60,
62.5, 66.7, and 75 mole % ZrF, above 520°C,
the incongruent melting point of Li Zr 4F 19+ There
appeared to be no difference in fhe somples taken
above and below 580°C, It has been decided that
the cubic material is either a metastable or o low-
temperature phase which sometimes precipitates
during quenching, The break at 580°C was prob-
ably due to nonequilibrium conditions.

The liquidus femperature of the mixture with
66 7 mole % ZrF, was found by quenching to be
rear 695°C. Thermai analysis data for the mix-
ture with 57.5 mole % ZrF , gave a liquidus tem-
perature of 618°C.

There is evidence that Li Zr,F,, decomposes
slowly into Li ZrF6 and ZrF4 upon cooling. A
relatively pure sample of LizZr 4F 19: prepared by
heating for 48 hr at 500°C, was reheated to 446°C
for several hours and quehched The sample then
gave a good x-ray pcﬂern for Li ZrF and ZrF ,,
although some Li Zr,F g remame-d The decom-
position temperature has not been definitely estab-

lished.

unusually high ZrF , vapor pressures,

The System NaF-RbF-ZrF ,-UF,
H. A. Friedman R. E. Thoma

- Materials Chemistry Division

Preliminary studies of some systems containing
RbF and ZrF, were made in an attempt to obtain
materials with low viscosities for possible use as
reactor fuels, Previous studies? of the RbF-ZrF,
binary system had shown low melting points only
for mixtures with moderately high (greater than
40 mo!e %) ZrF concentrations; 3RbF. ZrF , melts
at 900°C. Consequenﬂy, low-melting mlxtures

The RbF available, at present, contains about
20 mole % of KF, and therefore all studies re-
_fr'r:béﬁ'eddhe're‘wéfe made with RbF containing that
- amount of KF. It was anticipated that the KF

" to be the case, For example,BRbF.ZrF4formed

preferentially, and, if additional KF were present,
an excess of KF remained. In low-melting parts of
the NaF«(Rb,K)F-ZrF , system, unexpected phases
made their appearance, and therefore quasi binaries
could not be established. A join at 47 mole %
ZtF , appeared to pass through the phase fields of
two femary compounds and to give the lowest
melting points at the high RbF-content end, This
behavior, coupled with lack of information regard-
ing the similar NaF-KF-ZrF , system, caused the
postponement of a systematic study of the NaF-
RbF-ZrF, diagram, pending results from viscosity
measurements on an RbF-ZrF .UF, fuel mixture
and the procurement of better RbF,

In an effort to find a suitable fuel mixture for
viscosity measurements, a constant 4 mole % of

UF, was added to the RbF-ZrF, binary over a
range of composmons from 55 to 45 mole % RbF,

All these mixtures appeared to melt between 410

and 420°C and to give no detectable heat effects
above this range. This result led to the suspicion,
later confirmed, that small amounts of precipitates
with a very low temperature coefficient of solu-
bility were escaping detection, From the middle
of this range of apparently low-melting mixtures,
the composition RbF-ZrF ,.UF, (48-48-4 mole %)
was chosen as a preparation ?or viscosity meas-
urements, = The purified mixture was cooled to
450°C to precipitate any solidified crystals before
transfer; however, the transfer was carried out
through heated lines and a heated filter, so the
flowing melt was heated to 575°C. Crystals of
(Zr,U)F4 solid solution were found in the heel re-
maining in the purification vessel but not in the
filtered product. Hence, (Zr,U)F‘4 was presumed
to be the primary phase; it is possible that the
(Zr,U)F ; precipitated incompletely in the 15min
equilibration period at 450°C, since small parti-
cles were subsequently observed in the melted
product at temperatures above 500°C. However,
petrographic examination of the solidified melis
in which particles had been observed while they
were molten showed the presence of significant
amounts of oxyfluoride,

Viscosity measurements below 600°C were not
satisfactory because of these particles, but the
values obtained above 600°C were comparable with
those obtained, to date, for satisfactory fuel mix-
tures (see Sec. 7, *"Heat Transfer and Physicdl

Properties'). All the work described here was

The system KF-ZrF, is being studied in an at-
tempt to obtain background information regarding
the rather similar RbF-ZrF, system and to check
and refine techniques for handling these hygro-
scopic materials. Cooling curves obtained for ten
stirred KF-ZrF, melts with compositions in the
range 33.3 to 59 mole % ZrF, were in general
agreement with the phase diagram previously pub-
lished.> Thermal breaks in the range 45 to 50
mole % ZrF, indicate that there are two forms of
KZtFg, one of which is metastable.

| The System NaF-KF-ZrF,
H. A, Friedman R. E. Thoma

Ma’rerlcls Chemistry Division

F’reltmlncry studies indicate that the NaF-KF-
ZrF , system is much more complex than either the
NaF-ZrF -UF, system or the NaF-LiF-UF, sys-
tem., Neither of these latter systems shows ter-
nary compounds; in contrast, the NaF-KF-ZrF
system shows at least five such compounds. One
compound has the composition NaF:KF.ZrF,, and
another has the composition 3NaF.3KF.2ZrF .
Although the latter compound forms a compatibility
~ triangle with NaF and K, ZrF,, it cannot form a
quasi binary with K ZrF,, NasZrF,, or NaF, be-

cause it apparem‘ly melts mcongruenfiy at about

- 755°C to K ZrF and liquid. Cooling curves on
- the Na,Z:F -K ZrF join show a minimum in the
' !iquidus femperm‘ures' at about 800°C for the com-

. position with about 15 mole % KF; the liquidus

' temperatures then rise gradually to about 918°C
- for-the compound K ZrF and about 850°C for the
'VCompound Na ZrF7. Smce a slowly cooled melt of

it can be concluded that this join is a common

triangles,

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

Eight melts were made along the 33.3 mole %
ZrF, join of compositions containing from 15 to
50 mole % KF and NaF as the remainder, Although
all these compositions contained the compound
NaF:KF.ZrF, as one of the phases in the com-
pletely crystallized preparation, liquidus-tempera«
ture relations indicate that the compound melts
incongruently and that therefore there is no quasi
binary along this join,

Melting relations and phase compositions of six
preparations along the 47 mole % ZrF, join indi-
cate that the mixture with 47 molé % ZrE, also is
not a quasi binary, because most of the composi-
tions consist of three solid phases, including a
new ternary compound of undetermined composition
that is probably near NaF.2KF.3ZrF,, The mini-
mum liquidus temperature along this join is about
420°C for a mixture with about 35 mole % KF, A
search in this general area has indicated that
there is a eutectic, with the approximate composi-
tion 38 mole % KF, 21 mole % NaF, 41 mole %
ZrF ,, which melts at about 400°C,

The System NaF-LiF-BeF,

Thermal analysis data were obtained with a num-
ber of compositions within a wedge-shaped areaq in
the temary diagram having the LiF-Na,BeF, eu-

~tectic (16 mole % LiF) at the apex and Na,BeF,

and NaF-BeF, (70-30 mole %) at the other corners.
The cva:lub[e data indicate that acceptably low
melting points can be obtained with low LiF con-
ceniration by moving into the ternary system along
the drainage path leading from the NaF-Na,BeF,
eufectic (approximately 31 mole % BeF,; melting
point, 570°C) toward the LiF-NGzBeF4 eutectic,
Further, viscosity data for BeF -bearing mixtures
indicate that, in order to obtain a melt with a
kinematic viscosity as low as that of the ARE-type
fuel (2.82 centistokes at 600°C and 1.34 centi-
stokes at 800°C),% the BeF, content of the melt

must not be greater than 30 mole %, to assure com-
plexing of BeF, as BeF,=~ ions in the melt, If
an NaF-LiF-BeF, mixture is desired, it also ap-
pears that the LiF content will probably have to
be less than 10 mole %. One composition that
‘meets these requirements is the mixture NaF-LiF-
BeF, (63.,5-7.5-29 mole %), which has a melting
point of about 525°C, It is expected that the
viscosity of this mixture will be determined in the
near future,

The low-melting ternary mixture NaF-LiF- BeF
(27-35-38 mole %), reported previously’ on thev
“basis of cooling<curve data to melt at 325 + 10°C,
was found to melt at 339 + 5°C by the use of dif-
ferential thermcl analyms techniques., The former
value was low because of undercooling. This mix-
ture has been reported8 to have kinematic viscosi-
ties that are too high — 3.85 centistokes at 600°C
and 1.47 centistokes at 800°C — to be considered
competitive with those of the ARE fuel but low
enough to be of interest for a reactor design re-
quiring @ substantially lower melting point fuel
than _can be obtamed with known ZrF -base com-
posmons.

quU|dus temperatures were determined for sev-
eral compositions by differential thermal analysis
of samples cooled rapidly from 675°C to room tem-

‘pefature in order to avoid the segregation of the

crystalline components that apparently occurs on
~slow cooling. The composition NaF-LiF-BeF,

(50-‘[63’-33‘/ mole %) showed a liquidus tempera-
ture of 478°C and a solidus temperature, deter-
‘mined from hecmng curves, of 329°C, The mixture

'NGF-LlF BeF (64-5-31 mole %) showed a melting

point of 545°C and a freezing point of 555°C. An
unpurified melt of this composition froze at 535°C,
Most mixtures in this system have exhibited much
lower freezmg points than melting points because
“of the prevalence of undercooling, but the 64-5-31
mole % mixture appears fo be exceptional in this
reSpect.

. The equimolar composition NaF-LiF-BeF,, pre-
"wously investigated by Jahn,? was studied by
“using quenching and differential thermal analysis
techniques. The latter technique gave a value of

John, A crystalline phase having the x-ray pattern
described by Jahn for the NaLiBeF, compound pre-
pared from aqueous solution was observed in
samples of this composition quenched at tempera-
tures ranging from 406 to 562°C. At the lower

‘temperature, LiF and Na,LiBe,F, were also pres-

ent, while in samples quenched at temperatures
above the liquidus temperature, quench growth was
observed petrographically, Jahn's failure to ob-
tain NuLiBeF4 from melted samples by quenching
at temperatures below 550°C, which he ascribed to
formation of Be2F73" ions in the liquid, was more
likely due to poor quenching technique. Solid-
phase decomposmon of NaL.iBeF, to give LiF and

The System NaF-LiF-BeF ,-UF,

Investigations of the NaF-LiF-BeF -UF system
were confined to liquidus remperature defermma-
tions with mixtures containing 2.5 mole % UF,,
which gives cpproxumately the same concem‘rohon
of UF, (in g/em3) at 800°C as that of NaF-ZrF,.
UF, (50-46-4 mole %). Various techniques, m-
cludmg thermal analysis, differential thermal anal-
ysis, filtration, and visual observation, were used.
The results are summarized in Table 4.1,

The first mixture listed in Table 4.1 was pre-
viously reported to have a liquidus temperature of
465 t 5°C, as determined by visual observation,

.The filtration experiment demonstrated that the
small, high-temperature thermal effects observed

on cooling curves were spurious,

Analyses of the filtrates obtained with the 64.5-
31 mole % mixture showed an increasing concentra-

obtained with temary compositions prepared from

earlier indications of high liquidus temperatures in
this system, particularly for the mixtures con-
taining 33 mole %, or less, BeF,. The mixtures
containing 33 mole %, or [ess, BeF are considered
to be the most promising maxtures from the vis-

Solubility of UF; in BeF,-Bearing Compositions

Data on the solublllty of UF; in a number of
BeF .bearing compositions were reported earlier.12
The composition(in mole %) designated 69 NaF-31
BeF, in the previous work was actually 69 LiF-31
BeF,. All the earlier data were obtained with
mckel filters.1® In view of the greater stability of
UF, dissolved in LiF-NaF in copper containers
(discussed below in this section under the heading
““Reaction of UF, with Uranium in Alkali Fluo-

rides’’), it seemed desirable to see whether more

consistent data could be obtained in copper ap-

paratus equipped with a bronze filter medium, The
data obtcuned are shown in Table 4.2, together
‘with some addmonol dm‘u obtained with LiF-BeF,
mixtures in ‘nickel apparatus. The uranium addt-
~ tions were made erh UF, and uranium metal or by
'addmg large excesses of uranium metal to UF,-
beormg melts,
It is difficult to draw definite conclusions from
such scah‘ered data, but it is apparent that alloying
o of uramum wnh the nlckel filters and containers

was not the sole cause of the poor reproducibility
of the UF .solubility data obtained in nickel ap-
paratus. The large amount of tetravalent uranium
found in all the filtrates, regardiess of valence
form of the uranium added to the soivent, could be
due to oxidizing impurities in the melt, dispropor-
tionation of UF,, or a reaction between UF; and
the alkali fluoricj’e or beryllium fluoride in the melt,
Further experimentation will be required to deter-
mine the controlling factor in the production of

UF, in BeF,-bearing compositions.

than that for any previous measurement obtained by
this technique. Unfortunately, the existence of
equilibrium cannot be demonstrated with certainty,
since the present equipment cannot provide a gase-

~ drogen-fired chromium was reacted with 114 wt %

UF, (2.5 mole %) dissolved in approximately 30 g

_of fhe NaF-LrF-ZrF4 mixture contained in nickel.

The averages for the chromium values given in
Table 4.3 — 570 and 750 ppm at 600 and 800°C,
respectively — are the lowest found for any of the
reaction media studied. For comparison, chromium

values at 600 and 800°C in NaF ZrF were 2250

“and 2550 ppm; in NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %), 1750

and 2150 ppm; in NaF.LiF- KF (11.5-46.5-42 mole
%), 1100 and 2700 ppm. Although the UF, con-
centration was somewhat lower (2, 5 compcred with
4.0 mole %) in the recent experiments than in the
previous experiments, this variable can account for
only a small part of the difference found in chro-
mium content., |t seems more probable that the
most important factor, for the ZrF -containing
mixtures, is that with a decrease in ZrF, con-
centration there is also a decrease in the activity
of the UF, because of increased complexing by
the alkali fluorides. The results cannot be com-
pared with those obtained in the NaF-LiF-KF
eutectic, because virtually all the chromium is
present as the trivalent form in the eutectic, As
reported below, a large fraction of the chromium is
divalent in the NaF-LiF-Z¢F , mixture,

Data for the reaction of UF ; with Fe® in nickel

in Table 4.4, In all these runs, 2 g of hydrogen-
fired iron wire and approximately 30 g of the
solvent containing 11.4 wt % (2.5 mole %) UF
were employed,

The equilibrium iron values reported in Table 4.4
fall in the same general range as those found in
the other reaction media. The one dlfference to be
noted is that the iron values given in Table 4.4 are

slightly higher at 800 than at 600°C, whereas in

the NaF-ZrF ; mixtures and the NaF.LiF-KF eutec-
tic slightly hlgher values were observed at 600

is seen that roughly 80% of the FeF, added re-
mains as Fe wnh the remainder apparently being

oxidized to Fe , although no logical mechanism

for the oxndqhon can be postulated, From the re-

sults for the runs in whuch FeF, was added, it is
ewdent from the increase in the nickel content of
the system, that the nickel container reduces Fe3*

to Fe2®, No saﬂsfac’rory balance between Fe2?

“and N|2+ is shown by these data; it is therefore

Compounds of ZrF, with CrF,, NiF,, and FeF,.
Evidence from various experiments has indicated
that the simple fluorides of chromium, iron, or
nickel are not the primary phase when solutions of
these materials in NaF-ZrF, mixtures are cooled;
also, petrographic and x-ray examinations of such
cooled melts show the solid phases recovered to
be quite similar, 1t was believed that primary
phases were complex compounds of ZrF, with the
“structural metal fluorides. Accordingly, ZrF, was
heated at 950°C in sealed nickel capsuies with
each of the compounds CrF, CrF,, FeF, and
N|F2 in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 stoichiometric propor-
~tions. The CI'F3 dld not react with ZrF ,, and no

peared. The compound seemed to be NiF,.ZrF,,
and the constancy of cell size with composition
of the mixture indicated very hmﬁed or no solid
solution of either NiF, or ZrF, in the compound,

The ZrF FeF fusions showed a compound that
was isomorphous withl\lin'ZrF4 but had a slightly
larger cell size. The compound FeF,.ZrF,, how-
ever, unlike its NiF,.ZrF, counterpart, forms
solid solutions with ZrF . the cell size of the
compound appeared to be lowered by the ZiF,.
When the FeF, was in excess (2 moles of FeF,
to 1 of ZrF ), an additional phase, as yet unidenti-
f:ed was observed; the unchanged cell size of the

FeF,-ZrF, present indicated virtually no solid

solution of these compounds.
Petrographic examination indicated that the com-

pound CrF,ZrF, existed and that it was ap-

parently lsomorphous with its FeF, and NiF,
counterparts, No xeray diffraction data and no
observations of solid solution formation are yet
available. Because of the value of these studies
to the interpretation of some electrochemical
studies (also reported in this section), these
studies will be extended to include systems con-
taining NaF, as well as ZrF ,

Reaction of UF4 with Uranium in Alkali Fluorides
C. J. Barton B. H. Clampitt

Materials Chemistry Division

It was previously reported?! that the reduction
of Uf:4 in the NaF-LiF (40-60 mole %) eutectic
with metallic uranium was more nearly complete in
copper than in nickel apparatus., In those experi-
ments the copper apparatus was equipped with a
filter medium of bronze (82% Cu, 16% Sn, 2% Zn).
The experiments were recently repeated, with a
filter medium of pure copper being used; the data
from these experiments are presented in Table
4.10. The higher UF,/UF, ratios obtained in
these experiments suggest that some dispropor-
tionation of UF, occurred on contact of the melt
with the bronze filters,

However, when the reduction of UF with ex-

cess U° was carried out with the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic (11,5-42-46.5 mole %) as the solvent, the
reaction yielded U3*/total U ratios of 0,55 to 0.7
regardless of whether copper or nickel containers

The results obtained with the NaF-KF-LiF eu-
tectic and with the NaF-LiF eutectic are presented
in Table 4.11. It is obvious from the data that
most of the trapped material was alkali metol;
less than 5% of rhe‘,condensqre was alkali fluoride.
Also, both the quantity of alkali metal evolved
and the uranium content of the melt increased
with time in a quite regular manner. = As was ex-
pected, the reaction preduced more K° than Na®
{when both were constituents of the melt) and
more Na® than Li% However, the amount of alkali
metal collected did not, by a large factor, cor-
respond to the amount of uranium oxidized. It
appetrs certain that some condensation of the
alkali metals occurred in cooler portions of the
apparatus before the condenser was reached. The
apparatus is being remodeled to eliminate this
possibility and to demonstrate the stoichiometry
of the process.

ples of the metal phase were easy to obtain in
that they could be poured without difficulty into

Removal of CrF2 from I*ic:F-ZrF“-l.H"‘4 Mixtures
F. L. Daley

Materials Chemistry Division

The standard hydrofluorination-hydrogenation
method for the purification of fluoride mixtures
will remove NiF, and FeF, by reduction of these
materials to the metals, but it is largely ineffec-
tive in removing CrF,. Accordingly, if the mo-
terials charged to the processing plant contain
appreciable concentrations of CrF,, an additional
processing step must be included. Since the raw
materials NaF, ZrF,, and UF, contain only traces
of CrF,, this contamination is not a problem in
the production of virgin fuel. However, the fuel
materials that will be available for reprocessing
after having been used in engineering test unifs
at ORNL and ot Pratt & Whitney wili contain
CrF, as the major contaminant.

If the used material is stored in contact with
air, considerable amounts of ZrQ, and/or ZrOF,
will be formed by hydrolysis when it is reheated,
and these compounds could also cause trouble
in the reprocessing steps, It is possible, however,
to handle and to store the material so that such
hydrolysis is negligibly small. In that event the
only contaminant present that would not be re-
moved by the normal processing procedure would
be the CrF,, which would probably be present
to the extent of 500 to 1500 ppm chromium.

To achieve nearly quantitative reduction of
CiF, to Cr% a considerable fraction of the UF
must be reduced to UF;. Since the solubility
of UF, in NaF-ZrF, melts is relatively low, even
at 800°C, the amount of reductant must be closely

controlled. If this reduction is performed in the

. standard production egquipment, the subsequent

hydrofluorination merely reoxides the UF; to UF,

the reduction must be accomplished in auxiliary

- equipment, and the reduced melt must be filtered

Effect of ZrO, in Fuel Preparahon |

F. L. Daley
Materials Chemistry Division

Since ZrO is expected to be a common con-
taminant in commercml ZrF,, studies have been
made in order to ascertain the efficiency of con-
in the present equipment.
Appropriate 5- |b mixtures of NaF-ZrF ,-ZrO,-UF
which would yield, after complete hydrofluorlna-
tion, 50 mole % NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,, and 4 mole %
UF, were prepared. A maximum of 10 wt % ZrO,
was used. The samples were hydrofluorinated in
the usual manner at 800°C, and the exit gases
were periodically sampled by absorption of H,O
and HF in pyridine. The resulting liquid was
analyzed for fluoride and water. These analyses,
though rather erratic during early stages of treat-
ment, indicated that the hydrofluorination effi-
ciency was not greater than 20% with the agite-
tion possible in the equipment used,

[f only 20% efficiency were obtained in the
production plant, a 50-hr hydrofluorination period
would be required for complete conversion of a
100-kg batch containing 10% ZrO,. Such a pro-
longed period is quite impractical. 1t is obvious
that ZrO, contamination ‘in the ZrF, must be kept
to a low figure if high throughput of fuel that
meets specifications is to be maintained.

Pilot-Scale Purification Operations

J. P. Blakely J. Truitt
C. R. Croft W. T. Ward
Materials Chemistry Division

Fifty-three batches totaling approximately 500
Ib of purified fluorides were processed in the
pilot-scale equipment during the quarter. This
material, including 22 batches of BeF ,-bearing
compositions, was made up entirely of specidl
batches for use in physical property determina-
tions, phase equilibrium studies, and other pro-
grams requiring small batches of fluoride mixtures
of possible interest as fuels. The study of proc-
essing techniques for the purification of BeF,-
bearing compositions has continued to indicate
that further refinements will be necessary before
consistently high- qualify material can be pro-
duced. The BeF2 used as charge material has
been found to contain carbonaceous occlusions,
which are believed to contribute to the high sulfur
content of the material. The relation between
carbon and sulfur content in some typical, finished
batches is shown in the following:

Carbon (wt %) Sulfur (ppm)

Since sulfur in amounts of over ]00 ppm is known

to be very detrimental to the life expectancy of

Approxma’rely 100 batches totaling 4129 ib of
_ various fluoride compositions were dispensed in

 batch sizes ranging from 1 to 250 |b. Operational

difficulties plus a downward revision in estimated
usage of processed fluorides in the ANP program
by both ORNL and off-area consumers have, it
appears, postponed the time of maximum fluoride
consumption to October—November of this year.
With presently known testing schedules, an aver-
age demand of between 4000 and 4500 Ib of proc-
essed fluorides per month should prevail during
the fiscal year 1956.

A substantial gain in stock inventory was made
during the quarter, despite the fact that the in-
adequate ZrF, supply curtailed production by
several thousand pounds. A material balance

The operohons necessary for fl!llng, drcumng,
and sampling of charge material in all test equip-

- ment other than the thermal-convection loops

have continued at a rate comparoble to that of
the previous quarter. Over 50% of the operations
have involved the handling of alkali metals.

With the rapid increase in festing of alkali
metals, con5|derqt|on of safe, rapid methods
of disposal of used metals became necessary
Commercial vendors will not accept the metals
for reprocessing. The small-scale methods of
disposal formerly used have become inadequate
for the quantities now involved. Information ob-
tained from the Mine Safety Appliances Co. led
to the installation of an underwater jet through
which NaK is forced at 30 psi under 10 ft of water
in the disposal quarry. It is now possible to
dispose of NaK at a rate of about 30 |b/min. With
proper heating of the lines leading to the jet, this
installation could be used for sodium disposal.

The ART high-temperature critical assembly was
loaded with approximately 750 Ib of NaF-ZrF,
(50-50 mole %) and sufficient NaF- UF, (66.7-33.3
mole %) to reach criticality. Most of ?he NaF-UF
was added by helium pressure transfer of fhe
molten material in approximately 5-1b increments.

Recent experlments have shown ’rhcn‘ the gas
stripped from fused salts and measured as xenon
was contaminated with SiF, and with some organic
material that was volcmle at room temperature
but trapped in liquid nitrogen. Accordingly, the
previously reported?® value of about 10~7 mole
of xenon per cubic centimeter of solvent for the
solubility of xenon in the NaF-LiF-KF eutectic

where M and M' are CrS Fe% and Ni°% These
cells appear to be reversible, and they are quite
reproducible. However, interpretation of the data
from these cells is complicated because the solid
phase in equilibrium with the melt is not the simple
metal fluoride; evidence reported in a previous
portion of this section suggests strongly that
complex compounds of which NiF,:ZrF, is typical
‘are formed. Accordingly, when M and M! are
both Cr® for example, and when the two half cells
contain CrF, in different amounts, both sufficient
to saturate the solution at temperature, small but
reproducible and significant potentials are ob-
served. For example, when one half cell contains
7.8% and the other contains 12.6% CrF, (solubility
of CrF, at 700°C is 5.8%), the emf of the cell
varies from 15 mv at 550°C to 8 mv at 700°C.
This potential arises because the CrF, added
in excess of the saturation concentration ‘‘pre-
cipitates’’ ZrF 4 and thus changes the composition
of the solvent and affects the activities of the
ZrF, and of the NaF to a different extent in the
two half cells,

Potentials measured at various temperatures for
- cells of this type are shown in Table 4.15. It
‘may be noted that the sum of values for the Cro-

at all temperatures with the values for the Cr°-

Brawer's27 estimates of free energy of formatlon

Tare assumed to be correct, E0 ‘values of 0.35,
0.25, “and 0.60 v are obtained for the CroFe®

"_,be nearly mdependent of temperature over this
interval.

trode as a result of an internal discharge in cells
of type 1.
A reaction that might possibly occur is

3CrF2-T-__"2CrF3 + Cr°®

If such an equilibrium did exist, there would be
a different equilibrium concentration of CrF, and
CrF, around each electrode because of the differ-
ence in concentration of metallic chromium in the
electrodes. If, as in cells of type 1, it is possible
for convection currents to carry solution from one
electrode to the other, an internagl discharge of
the cell may occur,

Cells of type 2 are obtained experimentally by
using two recrystallized alumina containers, one
within the other. The electrodes are placed so
that one is in the inner container and one is be-
tween the two container walls. The salt mixture
is placed in and around the inner container.

The results obtained with cells of type 2 are
somewhat erratic, but there is a general trend
that is shown by the data plotted in Fig, 4.4.
Further investigation will be necessary to clarify
these results. Particular attention will be paid
to the purification of starting materials and to

The capillary viscometer, previously described,?®
has been calibrated by using pure LiNO, and
KNO, and has been used to measure the viscosity
of a mixture of these materials. Attack by LiNO,
on glass at high temperatures has necessitated sub-
stitution of a nickel capillary for these studies.

Measurements obtained?® for KNO, are in close
agreement with those reported by Dantuma?? and
by Goodwin and Mailey.3? Values for LiNO,
agree reasonably well with those presented by
Goodwin and Mailey but are nearly 20% below
those of Donfuma.

High-Temperature X-Ray Spectrometer Studies
G. D. White, Metallurgy Division
* T. N. McVay, ansultaht

by ’ Samples of 3LiF.ZrF, were x-rayed at elevated

' temperatures by using the furnace attachment to
the x-ray spectrometer. The investigation was
conducted to confirm the decomposition tempera-
ture of Li,ZrF,, which had already been deter-
mined by quench methods and thermal data, and
also to determine whether there was a high-
temperature polymorph of Li,ZrF, that was not
retained when the material was quenched.

At room ’remperai’ure the samples contained three
phases: Li ,ZrF g, LigZrF,, and LiF. In this
study the procedure qu to heat the mounted
sample in the evacuated furnace attachment to
550°C and then maintain it at that temperature

~ until the x-ray diffraction pattern contained none
. - ofthe Li2sz6 or LiF peaks. The reacted sample
o was then cooled to various temperatures until the
x-ray pattern mdlcated the presence of Li ZrF
andLiF. In this manner ’rhe decomposition temperq-
ture was deTermmed as being 470°C, which is
to be compared with the value of approximately

 

S

sl  475°C obtained by quench methods, At no tem-
_ perature above 470°C was the x-ray pattern for
. the low-temperature form of Li,ZrF, obtained.

The high-temperature x-ray pattern, presented be-

conductance at corresponding temperatures has
been correlated with such properties as ion size
and mass. Conductance has been treated as a
rate process, and values of the heat of activation
and entropy of activation have been computed
from experimental data. In general, the heat of
activation is somewhat temperature dependent;
this dependence is approximately linear for lithium,
sodium, and potassium salts, while it deviates
progressively more from linearity with rubidium
and cesium salts. The entropy of activation for
these salts is in the range of —6 to —8 eu. This
small negative entropy of activation is reason-
able and indicates a similar conduction mechanism
for all the salts, but no detailed quantitative
significance can be attached to it at this time.

An extensive series of freezing-point-depression
measurements has been made in which molten
sodium nitrate was the solvent, The heavy-metal
halides CdCl,, ZnCl,, CuCl,, PbCIz, and CdBr,
all show less than complete ionic dlssocmhon
in molten sodium nitrate; dissociation decreases
as conceniration rises. However, the slopes
of the curves indicate complete dissociation at
infinite dilution, The significant discovery has
been made that the scecalled ‘““common ion effect’’
is generally applicable to these salts. Thus the
addition of any of a large number of completely
dissociated chlorides greatly represses ionic
dissociation of partially dissociated chlerides such
as PbCl, and CdCl,. It has been demonstrated
in the case of CdCl, that the complex ion CdCl, ™~
is formed in the presence of relatively low con-

" centrations of excess common chloride ion. Re-
___actions have been proposed to account for the
““results, and equilibrium constants have been cal-
‘ culated.  Apparently those chlorocadmium com-

plexes containing even numbers of chlorines are
the more stable.
—~Several preliminary measurements have been

and is being applied to studies of molten salts,
X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from liquid
mercury at room temperature were used to test the
instrument; the pattcrns were satisfactory. These
diffraction patterns and the analysis giving in-
formation concerning the distribution of atoms
within the liquid have been presented, 33 It has
been possible to obtain data which appear to be

Several Inconel forced-circulation loops that
were operated with fluoride mixtures and with
sodium as the circulated fluids were examined.
The effect of operating time on corrosion and
mass transfer under the dynamic conditions was
studied for loops that circulated NaF-ZrF -UF ,
as well as the effects of the method of heating the
loop and of the length of the heated section, The
loops in which sodium was circulated were used
to study the effects on mass transfer of varying
the temperature differential in the system and of
varying the oxide content of the sodium and were
used to compare mass fransfer in Inconel and in
type 316 stainless steel,

Additional Inconel thermal-convection loops
were examined to determine the effects on cor-
rosion and mass transfer, in loops that circulated
fluoride mixtures, of varying the loop cleaning
method, of using direct resistance heating, and of
applying electromotive forces. In one loop, the
wall temperatures in the heated zone were
measured, The effects of oxide additions were
studied in loops that circulated sodium.

Several hot-pressed metal-bonded tungsten
carbide cermets were screen tested in NaF-ZrF -UF
and in sodium, and additional solid-phase bonding
tests of cermets were made, Inconel plc'red with

Examinations were completed of several Inconel
forced-circulation loops in which NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %) was circulated. The loops anj
the operating conditions are described in Sec. 2,
‘‘Experimental Reactor Engineering'’ and in the
previous report.! The corrosion data reported in
Table 5.1 and the analyses of the fluoride mixtures
given in Table 5.2 were for Inconel loops operated
with a temperature differential of 200°F, a
Reynolds number of the fluoride mixture of 10,000,
a maximum fluoride-mixture temperature of 1500°F,
and a maximum wall temperature of between 1600
and 1625°F. These loops were heated by direct
resistance of the Inconel tubing. Loops 4695-4A,
-4B, -4C, -4D-1, and -4D-2 were a single loop in
which the two heated legs? were replaced at the
end of each experiment. A new batch of fluoride
mixture was used for cleaning and operating each
test, The loop was cleaned by circulating the
fluoride mixture for 2 hr at 1300°F. The loop was
then filled for the test with a fresh batch of
fluoride mixture, which was circulated iscthermally
for 25 hr before the temperature differential was
applied.
~The period of isothermal operation was for the
purpose of establishing chemical equilibrium,

the first 50 hr fhe chromrum contenf of the fluoride

increased, in conflrmohon of the thermai-con-

vechon-loop data on mass transfer. Considerable

scatter is present in the data, but a depth of attack
of between 3 and 4 mils per 1000 hr of circulation
seems to be a reasonable value for the second
stage of attack. Typical hot-leq sections from
these loops are shown in Flg. 3.1,

Two “other loops (4950 2 “and_ 4935- 2) wefe
operated in as nearly ‘an’ Jdenhcal manner as‘v‘
possible, except that one was heated in a gas

furnace and the other was heated by the direct
electrical res:stance of the pipe wall, Both loops
were operated for 1000 hr, with NaF- ZrF4 UF
(50-46-4 mole %) as the cwculcfed fluid, a temper-
ature differential of 200°F, a maximum fluoride
temperature of 1500°F, and a fluorlde-mleure
Reynolds number of 5000. In both |<:ops a moderate

evidence that the wall temperature is a more

Sodium in Inconel and in Stainless Steel

G. M. Adamson A, Tabeoada
Metallurgy Division

Two Inconel forced-circulation loops (49512
and 4951-3) in which sodium was circulated were
examined after operating for 500 hr with a hot-leg
temperature of 1500°F. Loop 4951-2 had a 300°F

temperature differential, and loop 4951-3 had a
- 150°F temperature differential.

The two loops
were of a test series which included loop 4951-1,
operated previously, which had a temperature
differential of 200°F Table 5.3 presents the
metallographic and chemical dota obtained in
this series of tests.

No correlation can be observed between the
amount of mass transfer and the temperature
‘differential. However, the three loops were not
identical, and high oxide impurities of different
amounts were found in these loops. The results
of these differences could have obscured the
effects of the different temperature differentials.

deposit in the economizer, and there was attack
to a depth of 2 mils in the hot leg. Three sections
from the economizer and one from the cold leg
are shown in Fig. 5.3.

The second loop, 4951-6, which was operated for
1000 hr, included a bypass cold trap for removing
oxides. The hot-leg temperature was 1500°F,
and the temperature differential was 300°F
Metallographic examination showed mass-trans-
ferred deposits to a maximum thickness of 11 mils
(Figs. 5.4 and 5.5), which is comparable with
the thickness of the deposits found in the loop
with no cold trap. There was attack in the hot leg
to a depth of 1.5 mils (Fig. 5.6) that was of the
intergranular type found previously in sodium-
Inconel systems., Analyses of the sodium after
operation of the loop showed from 150 to 290 ppm

removed,

repeated here to present a complete summary, The_

data from the completed series of ‘tests are
presented in Table 5.6.

The loop that was operated for 2000 hr with a
positive charge applied to the hot Ieg showed
only about one-half the depth of attack found in
the loop operated with a negative charge cpplied
to the hot leg. With a negative hot leg, the depth
of attack was about the same as that found
the control loop with no applied potenfial From
these few data, it does not appear that small

s'rray pofem‘ials will increase the attack. Alfhough B
it would be difficult to apply a potential in'a
system as complicated as a reactor, it appears'
that it would be possible to reduce the attack by

applying a positive potential.

Slnce the examlnanons of vorlous sechons of

‘the ARE4 and the LITR fluoride-fuel loop5

revealed slight deposits of ruthenium metal on
the walls of the Inconel tubes, the effect of
ruthenium on the physical properties of Inconel
is being studied. A thin layer of ruthenium metal
was electrodeposited from a solution of ruthenium
nitrosochloride on an Inconel creep-test specimen,
The thickness of the ruthenium plate on the
Inconel was approximately 1.5 mils. The plated
creep-test specimen was annealed in an evacuated
Inconel capsule for 100 hr at 1500°F to allow the
ruthenium to diffuse into the specimen. The
specu'nen was then glven a creep-rupfure test in a
purified argon atmosphere at a stress of 3500 psi.
In calculating the stress, the area of the ruthenium
plate was included. The results of the creep-
rupture tests on the ruthenium-plated Inconel and
on an unplated, standard, Inconel specimen are
presented in Table 5.10, Since a difference in
rupture times was found, another test is now in
progress to check the results,

A metallographic examination of the strained
portions of the ruptured rutheniumeplated Inconel
specimen showed no difference in microstructure
in comparison with that of a ruptured, unplated,
Inconel specimen (Fig. 5.9). Creep-rupture tests

~are also to be conducted on ruthenium-plated

Inconel specimens in the fused-salt mixtures,

Brazing Alloys on Inconel and on Nickel in

-Sodium and in NaF-ZrF4-UF4

C. F. Leitten, Jr.
Metallurgy Division

Seesaw tests have been completed on a series
of brazing alloys on Inconel T-joints. These

 tests were conducted in sodium and in the fuel

mixture NaF- ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) for
100 hr at a hot-zone temperai‘ure of 1500°F. A
temperature differential of approximately 400°F
was maintained between the hot and cold zones
of the test container, The data obtained from
weight measurements and metallographic ex-
amination of the tested T-joints are given in
Table 5.11. The 82% Au-18% Ni brazing alloy
and copper were tested only in the fuel mixture,
because previous corrosion data had indicated
the poor corrosion resistance of these alloys in
sodium, The seesaw test on the Coast Metals
No. 52 brazing alloy was a retest; the results
agree with those previously reported.6

The Coast Metals No. 53 brazing alloy and
Electroless nickel showed good corrosionresistance
to both mediums, as indicated in Table 5.11. The
Inconel T-joints brazed with Coast Metals alloy
No. 53 are shown in Fig. 5.10 after exposure to
the fue! mixture NaF- ZrF UF (53 5-40-6.5 mole %)
in a seesaw test for 'IOO hr af a hot-zone tempera-
ture of 1500°F and after exposure to sodium under
the same conditions. Only slight attack can be
seen along the surface of the braze fillet exposed
to the fuel mixture; the fillet exposed to sodium
showed similar slight surface attack.

Brazing Alloys on Inconel and on
Stainless Steel in Lithium

C. F. Leitten, Jr.
Metallurgy Division

Corrosion tests have been completed on three
brazing alloys — Nicrobraz, 73.5% Ni—10% Si—16.5%
Cr, and 71% Ni-16.5% Cr-10% Si-2.5% Mn — on
type 316 stainless steel and Inconel T-joints in
static fithium at 1500°F for 100 hr to verify
corrosion results previously obtained,

The results obtained from weight measurements
and metallographic examination of the tested

 
 

 

‘:,::Nicrobraz,

  
  
 
 

specimens are presented in Table 5.12. All
the brazing alloys exhibited poor corrosion
resistance to lithium, and the attack was more
severe on the brazing alloys on type 316 stainless
steel. This is probably due to the difference in
nickel concentrations in type 316 stainless steel
(10 to 14%) and Inconel (75 to 80%). Since nickel
is preferentially attacked by lithium, the attack
on the Inconel T-joints would be uniform on both
the base material and the brazing alloys, which
in these tests contained approximately the same
nickel concentrations as Inconel. However, the
attack would be more concentrated on the brazing
alloys on type 316 stainless steel T-joints, be-
cause most of the nickel would have to be leached
from the brazing alloy in order to reach the
solubility limit of nickel in lithium. The results
of these tests corroborated the results of the
previous tests; that 'is, the nickel-base brazing
alloys have very poor corrosion resistance to
lithium, especially when used to braze iron-base
alloys.

Hastelloy B-Inconel in NaF-ZrF,-UF,

R. Carlander
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A static test of a Hastelloy B specimen in an
Inconel capsule containing a fuel mixture was
petrformed to determine whether dissimilar-metal

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

mass transfer occurred in such an isothermal
system. The fuel mixture was NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %), and the system was held for 100
hr at a temperature of 1600°F. The Hasteiloy B
specimen showed a negligible weight loss of
0.0003 g, but no attack could be detected
metallographically,  Spectrographic analysis re-
vealed that no molybdenum had transferred to the
Inconel capsule wall.,

Two 5-mil cuts were machined from the surface
of the Hastelloy specimen and analyzed spectre-
graphically to determine whether chromium had
been picked up from the Inconel tube. Since
there was no detectable difference in the chromium
content of the two cuts, it appears that no ap-

~ preciable quantity of chromium had transferred.

The surfaces of the Hastelloy B specimen and of
the [nconel container are shown in Fig, 5.11.
Inconel is normally attacked to a depth of 2 mils
in an all-lnconel static test system under similar
test conditions. The presence of Hastelloy B
in the system increased the observed attack on the
Inconel to a depth of 8 mils.

nickel or in iron-base alloy systems has a con-
siderable effect on the amount of mass transfer
that occurs in the system. Therefore, in order to
study mass transfer in a system in which the
oxygen content could be held to a very low level,
a boiling-sodium loop test was run. The loop is
shown in Fig. 5.12. The temperatures around the
loop during the 400-hr test are indicated. There
are two traps for liquid sodium in the condenser
leg of the loop. The first trap is filled with hot,

freshly condensed sodium during the test. This
.is an ideal location for metal solution to occur.
The second trap catches the overflow from the
first trap and operates at a considerably lower
‘temperature.” This is an ideal location for metal
‘deposition to occur. Three nickel cooling coils

are located on the condenser leg, and air flow

- “through these coils is regulated to maintain the
‘desired temperatures. The boiler and the small
_return line to the boiler are the only areas where
heat is applied. The first test was terminated

tinved. Previous results? emphasized, contrary
to generally accepted oxidation theory,}0 that
sodium forms a highly protective oxide film in dry
oxygen. The research has, also, in some measure,
filled the gap which exists in the experimental
ox;dcmqn data for the alkali ond alkaline-earth
metals. Finally, the results indicate a consider-
able similarity between the oxidation of sodium
and other, more extensively studied, metals, such
as copper and aluminum. In this respect, addi-
tional evidence has been obtained in support of the
idea expressed by Cabrera and Mott!! that all
metals have comparable oxidation mechanisms at
relatively low temperatures,

OXidotion-fate measurements for sodium were
made manometrically. A film of sodium was
evaporated onto the walls of a small glass bulb
attached to one arm of a sensitive differential
manometer, The course of the reaction could
then be followed by measuring the decrease in
pressure in the bulb as the oxidation proceeded.

- The details of the experimental apparatus have

already been described.?
During the period covered by this report, most of

-the experimental work has been devoted to the

measurement of oxidation rates at 25 and 48°C
over extended periods of time. At these two tem-
peratures and also at 35°C, experiments lasting
between 15,000 and 20,000 min have been com-
pleted. |

Such prolonged experiments were considered
necessary for two reasons. First, they are re-
quired if a realistic determination is to be made of
the analytical form of the rate curves, Because
there may be a gradual change in the reaction
mechanism as oxidation proceeds and on account
of unavmdable errors in experimental measure-
mem‘s,' a misleading impression of an oxidation

curve can easily be obtained when data for only
‘the first portions of the curve are available.

A second reason for such extended tests was
that some metals (for example, columblum) undergo

‘abrupt changes in oxidation mechanism after o

relatively thick oxide film has developed on them.

It was important to determine whether or not sod:um
‘is subject to this phenomenon,

Seven rate determinations at 25°C and four at
48°C, all lasting for 17,000 to 20,000 min, have
been completed. Data from these, as well as the
measurements obtained at ~79, =20, and 35°C,
are shown in Fig. 5.16. The change in pressure
in the system, which is a function of the oxide-
film thickness, is plotted against the time of
oxidation on a log-log plot. Each unit of the
vertical scale is equivalent to approximately 10 A

of oxide; therefore after 20,000 min at 48°C an

oxide thickness of almost 1400 A was attained.

Each curve of Fig. 5.16 represents the com-
posite of data from three or more experiments,
Deviations of as much as 10% in the total pressure
change were observed between readings at the
same time and temperature in different experiments,
An error of this magnitude was not considered
serious; a basic assumption in comparing the re-
sults of different experiments was that the areas
of the initial sodium films were the same. A new
oxidation bulb was used for each experiment, and
it was impossible to avoid slight variations in the
dimensions of these bulbs. Therefore the assump-
tion that the apparent surface area of the sodium
films was identical for all experiments was true
only to a first approximation, Perhaps even more
important was the possibility that the surface
roughness (and, therefore, the true surface area) of
the sodium films differed slightly from experiment
to experiment. These two factors could easily
account for the observed variations in the experi-
mental results,

Mathematical analyses of the rate curves show
that none of the conventional oxidation-rate laws
was obeyed by sodium; that is, the data could not

- be fitted to rate equations of the form x™ =kt (where

x is the oxide thickness after a time ¢, & is the
rate constant, and » = 1, 2, or 3) nor to the loga-
rithmic, x = & log ¢, or the inverse logarithmic,

1/x = A - B In ¢, rate equations. The absence

of any abrupt changes in the oxidation curves
indicates that there were no sudden changes in
the mechanism of oxidation as the oxidation pro-
ceeded,

One interesting feature of the results was that
the oxidation proceeded at an ever-decreasing
rate with time, even at 48°C., Thus highly pro-
tective oxide films were observed under all con-
ditions investigated., There was no indication of

‘and behavior of the oxide films during the transition

from the parabolic to the linear rate would give
some mdlcchon of the criteria for linear oxidation
rates,

The first phase of the work consisted in a

careful redetermination. of the oxidation-rate
curves for columbium at 400°C. A manometric
technique, very similar to that used for the
“oxidation of sodlum,9 was found to be satisfactory
for the rate measuremenis, The oxidation speci-
mens cons:sted of 1 x 2 e¢m strips cut from a
0.020-in.-thick sheet of columbium. The specimens
were electropolished mechanically with 4/0 emery
paper and then electropolished in a 10% HF-90%
H SO bath. One such strip was placed in a
100-cm glass bulb attached to one arm of a
dlfferenhal manometer,  Octoil-S diffusion-pump
oil was used as the manometric fluid in order to
' obtain the desired pressure sensitivity. The
oxidation and reference bulbs of the manometer
were evacuated to a pressure of about 10=6 mm Hg
and then immersed, along with an oxygen reservoir,
in a molten-salt, constant-temperature bath. The
oxidation and reference bulbs were then filled
simultaneously with oxygen to identical pressures.
The absolute oxygen pressure was about 700 mm
Hg. The rate of oxidation was then determined by
measuring, with the manometer, the decrease in
pressure in the oxidation bulb. The use of an
accurately controlled constant-temperature bath
was considered necessary to avoid spurious
pressure changes arising from temperature differ-
ences in the oxidation and reference buibs,

Four oxidation experiments have been completed
at or near 400°C. In each case the oxidation
curve was initially approximately parabolic and
then became linear as tHe time of oxidation
increased. The data from one of these experiments
is shown in Fig. 5.17. The change of oxygen
pressure is plotted against the time of oxidation,
For reasons as yet unknown, the time at which
‘the transition from the parabolic to the linear

portions of the rate curves occurred varied some-

what from experiment to experiment. However, the
amount of oxygen which had been consumed by the
‘time the transition region was reached was found
to be relatively constant.

The oxide layers formed during the early stages
of the reaction exhibited the interference tints
typical of thin, transparent, oxide films. However,
as the reaction progressed, patches of a white,

opaque material developed on the surface of the
columbium specimens, These white areas ap-
peared under an optical microscope to be rough,
and it was assumed that they represented relatively
porous regions in the oxide film, X-ray ex-
amination of the oxidized specimens indicated
that both the white areas and those parts of the
oxide film that still showed interference colors
consisted of columbium pentoxide (Cb 205).  No
other oxides of columbium were detected,

Although the evidence is still not complete,
the occurrence of the regions of white oxide
seemed to be associated with the deviation of the
rate curves from their initial parabolic form. For
this reason it has been tentatively assumed that
the white portions of the oxide film represent the
type of oxide film which produces a linear reaction

rate. In order to study the nucleation and growth

of this white oxide, a hot-stage microscope has
been constructed and is being tested. This

apparatus should allow direct observation of the’

oxide films as they are formed.

An attempt is being made to express the over-all
oxidation-rate equation for columbium as the sum
of parabolic and linear terms approximately
weighted to take into account the fraction of the
total surface area oxidizing according to each of
the two mechanisms, Complete formulation and
testing of this equation awaits further data
concerning the growth characteristics of the

areas of white oxide. It is hoped that this infor-
mation can be obtained from observations of the
oxidation under the hot-stage microscope.

High-Temperature S'-peci'rophcromeiry in
Fused Hydroxides

C. R. Boston
Mefullurgy Division

Work is continuing on the improvement of
techniques for measuring absorption spectra at
high temperatures. The major components have
been fabricated and assembled for a new cell
arrangement, These include the MgO cell ('“-'7/ in,
deep with parallel flat sides); the stainless sfee!
cell holder, tube header, etc.; a quartz tube with
optically flat windows; a glass vacuum system;
and a furnace with light-path openings. A controlled
atmosphere can now be maintained over the melt
during spectral measurements, and, in addition,
the cell can be dry-box-loaded with previously
dehydrated hydroxide. This prevents etching of
the polished MgQ cell faces by water vapor, as
was experienced with the previous apparatus.
It was thought that the deeper MgO cell would
reduce the creep problem, However, with the cell
less than half full, the hydroxide was found to
creep over the top of the cell and down the sides
in a matter of minutes after melting. A still-
deeper MgO cell (~1 I/ in.} is now being cut.

At the present hme, a Coleman model 14
spectrophotometer modified for high-temperature
work is being used. This instrument is, of course,
inadequate for accurate work, and a Cary model 11
instrument is being acquired and will be rebuilt,

the system was evacuated, and the hydroxide

this way from reagent-grade sodium is now being

Mass Transfer and Corrosion in Fused Hydroxides

Studies of the corrosion and mass: transfer of
nickel and Inconel by fused sodium hydroxide are
continuing in the “‘cold finger' apparatus.'4 In
addition, two new metals, copper and Monel, have
been checked under hydrogen, and the results

‘indicate that both are attacked to approximately
the same extent as nickel., The mass transfer on

the Monel cold finger is interesting in that both
nickel- and copper-colored crystals are deposited.

[t has been reported that additions of chromium
in fine particles eliminate mass transfer of
nickel.!5 One addition of chromium as a single
lump, which was the only form available, was
made at 650°C under hydrogen. No change in
amount of mass transfer was noted. Addition of
a manganese sheet to the hydroxide at 650°C
resulted in transfer of manganese to the cold
finger.

have caused some speculation as to the specnes

 of ions present at elevated temperatures. An

investigation of the thermal dissociation is one
of several studies being conducted to identify
these species.

The apparatus consists of an Alphatron pressure-
gage tube and a crucible machined from a single
crystal of magnesium oxide and connected through
a water-cooled copper block to a vacuum and a
gas-collection system. The hydroxide (B and A
reagent grade, carbonate-free, or prepared from
sodium metal and distilled water) is dehydrated
in situ at 400°C under vacuum for periods ranging
from several hours to several days. The temper-
ature is raised to 800°C, and then, after equilibrium
has been established, gas samples are taken for
mass spectrometric analysis, The residual
hydroxide has been analyzed, in some cases, by
wet chemical methods and, in one case, by x-ray
diffraction, |

The gas-analysis results have been somewhat
erratic; they showed 2 to 89% water and 10 to 82%
hydrogen at total pressures of 4 to 5 mm Hg.
However, in every case, both gases have been
present, and their sum ranges from 74 to 99%, the
balance being contaminants, such as nitrogen,
which probably arise from air leaks. Wet chemical
analysis sheds no light on the residual hydroxide
content, but x-ray diffraction has identified sodium

As the data in Table 5.17 indicate, UF, is quite
unstable under these conditions, regardless of the

Effect of Chromium on the Mass Transfer of

Nickel in NaOH
H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
F. A. Knox

Materials Chemistry Division

The effect of chromium on the mass transfer of
nickel by NaOH was tested in a nickel rocking
furnace. The exposures, at 4 cpm, were for 100 hr,
with the hot ends of the capsules at 775°C and
with a 100°C temperature drop along the capsules,

When 1 wit % Cr® was added to the purified
NaOH, the mass transfer of nickel was reduced
by about a factor of 2. However, in no case was
the mass transfer eliminated, Analyses of the
caustic revealed the presence of about 4000 ppm
Ni in the tests without chromium added to the
NaOH, while about 2500 ppm Ni and 3200 ppm Cr
were found in the caustic to which 1T wt % Cr® was

added,

This decrease in mass transfer presumably can
be explained by the reaction of Cr® with NaOH to
yield hydrogen gas, which tends to suppress the
reaction of NaOH with Ni®. Since hydrogen diffuses
readily through nickel metal at the test tempera-
ture, these experiments were repeated with the
nickel capsules enclosed in evacuated, sealed
quartz jackets. In addition, two capsules were
sealed in quartz envelopes containing hydrogen
at 540 mm Hg pressure. After 100 hr in the
rocking furnace, no mass transfer was found in
any of the capsules, except one for which the
quartz envelope had cracked. This lack of mass
transfer was evident, however, even in the control
capsules containing no chromium, Furthermore,
analyses of the caustic after the tests showed
quite low (less than 100 ppm) concentrations of
nickel and chromium. Pressures inside the quartz
envelopes, obtained by breaking the quartz inside
an evacuated standard volume, were about 350 mm
Hg (590 for the one initially set at 540 mm Hg).
The gas was not analyzed, but it is presumed that
it was hydrogen.

From these studies it is not apparent that

chromium is particularly beneficial. It does
appear, however, that some mechanism to prevent
loss of hydrogen from the system — perhaps

cladding the nickel with some metal impervious to
hydrogen — might be quite beneficial,

Stress-Rupture Tests

J. H. DeVan
Metallurgy Division

Stress-rupture testing of %-in. inconel tubing in
argon and in fused salts at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F
is now in progress., Although data for Inconel
tubing at 1300 and 1650°F are as yet incomplete,
the results of tests of Inconel tubing with wall
thicknesses of 0.010, 0.020, 0.040, and 0.060 in.
at 1500°F in argon and in fused salts are suffici-
ent to show important trends.

In studying the biaxial stress system set up in
the tubes, the question arises as to whether failure

is related to the effect of combined stresses or

whether, 1he maximum stress component (in this
case, hoop stress) singularly controls the time to
failure, A comparison of the results of tensile
creep-rupture tests and tubesburst tests is pre-

sented in Fig, 6.1 for tests in argon and in Fig.

6.2 for tests in NaF-ZrF 4~UF, (50-46-4 mole %).
It may be seen that there is good agreement be-
tween rupture times for 0.060-in.-wall tubmg and
0.060-in.-thick sheet in both environments. Thus,
the presence of an axial stress in the tubing does
not appear to affect the time to failure,

It may be noted, however, that the specimens

“with thinner walls, 0,010 to 0.020 in., ruptured in
‘much shorter times than those observed for 0.060-

in.~thick sheet specimens at comparable stresses,
While this was originally thought to be due to the
effect of the combined stress system acting in the
tubing, it now appears from the results of tests on
0.020-in.-thick sheet that the poor rupture propet-
ties are associated with the smaller section thick-
ness.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

The results of creep-rupture tests of 0.020-in,-
thick Inconel sheet in argon and in hydrogen at
1500 and 1650°F are compared with those of tests
of 0.060-in.-thick sheet in Table 6.1. As may be
seen, a substantial reduction in rupture life ac-
companies the reduction in section size,

the circulation of fused salts was conducted by
utilizing a modified creep-rupture machine to simu-

bellows was deformed while the outside and inside
surfaces were in contact with the fused salt mix-
fure NGF-ZrF4-UF4 (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). Tests

was between that observed for a 7% Cr—-20% Mo~-

Ni alloy. Further, it is considered to be heat
resistant, and it forms a nonspalling oxide upon
oxidation. The samples from a vacuum melt of
Hastelloy B supplied by the Haynes Stellite Com-
pany showed no significant differences from com.
mercial grades of Hastelloy B, The 2.5% Be-
97.5% Ni alloy also forms a nonspalling oxide and
is considered to be heat resistant, The addition
of 5% Cb, however, increased the oxidation rate to
that observed for Hastelloy B.

Table 6.4, verified that low strength and duc-

tility resulted from long exposure in hydrogen at
elevated temperatures. The tests also indicated
that the effect of hydrogen could be removed by
vacuum annealmg.

The possibility that a hydride forms during
aging has been suggested, but, if such is the

“case, embrittlement in alloys containing chromium

and aluminum cannot be explcined The embrittie-

““ment effect was not detected in tests of Hastelloy

B and of the binary nickel-molybdenum alloys, and

it was not found in all the elevated-temperature -

tensile tests of the ternary alloys that have been
studied.

Twelve extrusions of Hastelloy B were attempted
by the Babcock & Wilcox Co. to determine the
commercial feasibility of making tube blanks for
seamless tubing. This effort was supported by
the Haynes Stellite Company, Each of the twelve
extrusion attempts were unsuccessful because of
severe cracking of the tube blanks or failure to
extrude (‘‘stickers’’). The extrusion temperatures

used were between 2000 and 2250°F, Based upon

experience at ORNL, it is concluded that improper
temperatures, socking time, and press capacity
were the main causes of failure,

Since this effort was made because successful
extrusions had been made at ORNL, additional ex-
periments were performed here to verify the recom-
mended extrusion conditions, to verify, with a
different heat, the superior redrawing properties of

for reducing. the pressure required for the extru-
sion. Two uncanned billets of Hastelloy B were
successfully extruded into tube blanks at an ex-
~trusion ratio of 5.5/1, The recommended condi-
_ tions were verified: namely, temperature, 2000°F;
‘heating time, 45 min per inch of billet thickness;
and extrusion pressure, 80 to 90 tsi. These tube
blanks are to be redrawn to small-diameter tubing.

A Hastelloy B blllef conned in / ¢-inethick
Inconel was extruded at 2100°F at an ex'rrus:on
~ ratio of 5.5/1, The pressure required for this ex-
" trusion was 55 tsi, as compared with 80 tsi for the
uncanned billets, A second canned extrusion was
made at a ratio of 9/1 at 2100°F with fair success,
At these temperatures, the first billet, if uncanned,
would have cracked severely. The high extrusion
ratio used for the second extrusion would have
caused the blHef, if uncanned to be a sticker,

The use of Inconel as cannmg material for
Hastelloy B is justified, since it serves a three-
fold purpose.. Besides acting as a lubricant, the
Inconel provides a thermally bonded oxidation-
resistant tayer for the alloy. Also, in a high-
temperafure air stream, the Inconel would inhibit
formation of the corrosive MoO vapor, and thus
there would be no possibility of catastrophic oxi-
dcmon occurring in the structural material, More-
over, the clad Hastelloy B could probably be re-
duced more successfully than the unclad material,
because Inconel is not sub|ect to ‘‘heat cracking,’’
that is, surface cracking durmg cnneahng of cold

work that is aftributable to poor themal conduc-.

tivity and a high rate of work hcrrdemng.

STRESS-RUPTURE TESTS OF HASTELLOY B

D. A, Douglas
Metallurgy Division

C. R. Kennedy
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A series of creep-rupture tests has been com.
pleted on solution-annealed Hastelloy B at 1500
and 1650°F in the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF -UF
(50-46-4 mole %). The results are summanzed m
design curves presented in Figs. 6.4 and 6.5. A
similar series of tests is nearly completed for
solution-annealed Hastelloy B at 1300 and 1800°F
in argon and in the fluoride mixture.

The influence of aging heat treatments on the
creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy B is being
studied at several temperatures ranging from 1300
to 1800°F. In general, aged specimens have
shown marked reductions in creep rate and tensile
elongations compared with specimens in the solu-
tion-annealed condition. Results obtained from
creep-rupture tests on solution-annealed and aged
specimens at 1500 and 1800°F in argon are pre-
sented in Table 6.5,

The creep-rupture properties at 1800°F are not
substantially affected by aging, since at this tem-
perature a single-phase alloy exists. However, at
1500°F, a second phase that appears upon aging
produces a marked change in the creep-rupture
properties of the alloy. It may be noted that for
stresses which produce a rupture life in excess of
100 hr for the solution-annealed material at 1500°F
the difference in rupture life of the solution~

This is

annealed and aged specimens is small.

. understandable, since, during testing at this tem-

~Two additional tube b!anks of_q\]57 M'o.-ss% N

.. age.” During testing at higher stresses, the solu-
V__:_:hon-c‘:nnealed materlul does not age appreciably

before rupture, and thus the rupture times for the

aged specimens are opprecmbly longer than those

for the squhon-anneoled Spec:mens.

a large number of high-temperature brazing alioys
have been tested, none investigated to date have
proved entirely satisfactory, Most of the brazing
alloys which wet the boron carbide also react with
it to form brittle bonds that crack upon cooling.
The most promising alloys tested thus far are
those that either contain zirconium as a component
or require an application of zirconium hydride
powder to the boron carbide surface prior to place-
ment of the brazing alloy on the same surface,
Experimental alloys are now being prepared to
permit a more thorough investigation,

Brazing of Cermet Valve Seats to
Inconel Components

Three assemblies incorporating Kentanium cermet
valve parts have been successfully brazed by using
the technique described previously.* An exploded
view of an assembly for determining the self-
welding characteristics of these cermet valve parts
is shown in Fig. 6.7. This assembly consists of
an Inconel structural piece, two copper-foil disks
that supply brazing alloy for the lnconel-to-nickel
joint, @ I/4--1in.-thi<:l-< nickel block to dissipate ther-
mal stresses resulting from the different coeffici~
ents of thermal expansion of Inconel and Kentani-
um, a copper-foil disk to supply supplementary
brazing alloy for the nickel-to-Kentanium joint, and
the Kentanium seat plated with a 0.0001-in, layer
of nickel-phosphorus followed by a 0.003-in, layer
of copper on the surface to be brazed,

‘Figure 6.8 shows an actual valve subassembly,
which is similar to the assembly for self-welding
studies except for the omission of several copper-
foil disks, Copper powder, which was substituted
for the disks, was placed in especially provided

qucnhtahve!y, the extent of distortion to be exs
pected. The first test consisted in the deposition
of a butt weld between two cylindrical segments
4 in, in depth, Each segment was machined from
a nominal, 12-in.~ID, sched-40 pipe, in which the
inside diameter was bored to 12,250 in. to improve
the roundness and the ou'rsrde diameter was tumed
down to 12,500 in. to provide a 0,125.in. wall for
3 in. of the 4-in. depth. A stainless steel face
plate was tack-welded at 60-deg intervals to the
l-in, shoulder of each segment to provide a degree
of restraint intended to approximate that provided
by the tapered reduction in diameter of the island
sheath. Micrometer caliper measurements at 48
scribed positions indicated that a maximum change
of 0.030 in. occurred in the nominal 12,5-in. out-
side diameter, As was expected, the frequency of
large changes increased wn‘h increasing proximity
to the weld. o

A second test was conducted to determine the
extent of distortion to be expected when butt-
welding the spun core segments with the aid of
mechanical support, Two 6-in.-deep Inconel cylin-
ders, 12,5 in. OD, ]/s-in. wall, were butt-welded
with an aluminum backing ring containing Lavite
inserts for support. Micrometer and dial-gage
measurements made at 96 positions on the weld-
ment, before and after welding, indicated a maxi-
mum shrinkage of 0,020 in. on the 12.5-in, outside
diameter, that is, an improvement of 0,010 in. over
the shrinkage obtained without mechanical support.

~The information gained in these experiments
was then utilized in the fabrication of the actual

core shells, The upper and lower halves of the
“inner shell were stress-reheved in dry hydrogen |
for 2 hr at 1500°F with heating and coolmg times

of 3 hr. They were then machined to the desired

length and beveled to fac:htate weldmg. Berylhum

The recent successes of several AEC instal-

aluminum shapes suggested that the technique
might be applied to the inspection of Inconel and
stainless steel tubing. A comprehensive literature
and patent survey indicated that the eddy-current
flaw detection method had been successfully
applied to magnetic materials and to high-conduc-

Hence, if / in,~dia, 65-mil-wall, Inconel tubing

change in wall thickness, However, changes in
eccentricity also produce changes in the resistive
component, as shown by the curves through the

ments in terms of the nature of the tubing flaws,
both the changes in the resistive and the reactive

indicated in Table 6.8. Work with experimental
equnpment has :ndlccted however, that such an
instrument is feasible but would require con-
snderable development work. As a result,emphasis
is now being placed upon the development of
su:table probe-type coils with which impedance
anulyses could be made without changing frequency
for each different size of tubing. In addition, it
is felt that a probe coil, because of its small size,
would be more sensmve to small flaws than would
an encnrclmg coil.

Since the eddy-current flaw-detection method

~ has many more unresolved problems than does the

method that employs ultrasonic equipment, the

located by dye-penetrant inspection have been
located with ultrasound. Alsa, subsurface defects
of equally small size haye been detected with
ultrasound and verified by metallographic exami-
nation. Experience indicates that defects located
on the inner surface will be similarly detected.
The conventional presentation of ultrasonic

~data is on a cathode-ray tube as the ‘*A* scan,

the vertical sweep being the signal strength and
the horizontal sweep being the distance (travel
time) from the crystal. This presentation is not
interpretable at high scanning speeds, since the
repetition rate of the flaw signals will be in
excess of 100 times per minute. Gated alarm
signals would also be unsatisfactory, since all
spurious signals, as well as flaw indications,
would pass through the gate, The less con-
ventional ‘‘B*" scan would present the defects as
a standing image of the tube cross section on a
17-in. cathodesray tube. In this case, the vertical
sweep would be a scan of the ‘A" type of
presentation, and the horizontal sweep would be
the rotation of the tube.

A ““B’* scan pattern from a tube having only

one defect in the particular cross section being

scanned is shown in Fig. 6.19. The defect, which
is represented by the diagonal line, was a non-
metallic stringer about 0.001 in. in diometer and
about 1/ in. long. This defect was longitudinal
and was located about 0.010 in. below the outer
surface of the tube and paralle! to the tube axis,

Graphlfe-hydrogen ‘systems at tempercfures of
. the order of 2400°C or higher are of interest for

nuclear rocket applications. An investigation
was carried out to determine whether hydrogen
flowing at a velocity of Mach 0.15 in high-density
graphite tubing (]/ in, OD, 1 in. ID, 24 in, long)
at’ approx;mately 2400°C caused significant
corrosion-erosion of the graphite. Two types of
graphite specimens were used:  Graph-i-tite
(density, ~1.8 g/cm3), supplied by Graphite
Specialties Corporation, and commercial graphite
(density, ~1.55 g/cm3),

A schematic drawing of the apparatus used for
the high-temperature graphite-hydrogen experiment
is shown in Fig. 6,.20. The graphite specimen was
heated electrically to 2400°C, and a nitrogen or
helium atmosphere was maintained in the specimen
until equilibrium conditions were reached. The
high-velocity hydrogen was applied for 10 min,

~and then the hydrogen was replcced ‘with helium
“while 'rhe specimen was coohngr Data and resulfs
“of the experlmenfs cre given in Table 6.9.

The average corrosion-erosion for the tests on

Grcph-:-hte showed a loss of 0.0001 g/m. .sec,

It was noted that the we;gl-n‘ losses were about

~ the same wn‘h hel;um as wn‘h hydrogen, and I1‘ !S
-.’rprobable 'rha'r ‘the losses were due to water vapor

- was believed to be about 1600°C, and the velocity
L was about 1900 fps, or approximately Mach 0.18.
‘It was observed that the weight losses of the

B ~ Columbium Research
 The investigation of metal diffusion barriers
~ for use in the fabrication of Inconel-clad columbium
sheet was continued, »
‘ported, 0 the interdiffusion between Inconel and
columbium at elevated temperatures is extensive.
The reaction products, which appear to be nickel-
columbium compounds, are brittle, and, because of
the difference in the coefficients of thermal
expansion between the metals, separation occurs
af the interface when the composite is cooled to
room temperature, The problem is not that of
preventing the formation of intermetallic compounds,
although this would be desirable, but primarily
that of selecting a suitable combination of metals
which will remain thermally bonded in service.
This is mandatory, since the composite is being
considered for use as a heat transfer surface,

The barrier metals to be studied were selected
somewhat at random, since the phase relationships
between columbium, the possible barrier metals,
and Inconel have not been thoroughly determined,
especially as to the nature of the compounds
which are formed. Vanadium, titanium, molybde-
num, tantalum, and copper have been evaluated
as the barrier metals, _
Composites were fabricated by hot-rolling
capsules which had been evacuated at 1100°F to
at least T x 10~4 mm Hg. Rolling temperatures
between 1800 and 2100°F were used at reduction

As was previously re-

schedules of 30 and 40% per pass. The total
reduction in thickness was about 5/1. No
particular effort was made to predetermine the
thickness of the columbium core or the Inconel
cladding. A final composite thickness of 0.020 in.
was evaluated. The barriers were calculated to
be 0.001 in. thick after being rolled, Cross
sections of strips that had been bent fo form an
involute of a circle were examined microscopically,
" The Inconelevanadium-columbium composite in

- the as-rolled condition withstood several 90-deg
'bending reversals over a sharp rudius. M:croscoplc
‘examination

showed a reaction layer at the

vanadium«|nconel interface that was less than

'0.0001 in, thick, The reaction layer was cracked
- perpendicular to a tangent to the curved surface.
‘Since no separation occurred at the interface, this
composite could probably be formed to a desired

shape by cold spinning. After 100 hr at 1650°F,
the composite separated at the Inconel-vanadium
interface upon bending, The reaction layer at
this interface had increased to about 0.0005 in.
in thickness, and the vanadium layer had decreased
in thickness. After 500 hr at 1650°F, the composite
separated during sectioning. Microscopic exami-
nation showed that the vanadium layer had been
completely transformed to an intermetallic com-
pound,

An |Inconel-titanium-columbium composite was
found to be unsatisfactory because of the formation
of a low-melting compound at the rolling tempera-
ture of 2100°F. The compound was brittle, and
separation of the composite occurred during
cooling. The experiment is to be repeated with a
lower rolling temperature,

An Inconel-tantalum-columbium composite was
prepared, but, since tantalum and columbium are
isomorphous in several aspecfs fhe composn‘e"
was not expected to be successful. Specifically,
this combination was tried to determine the effect
of the melting-point difference of the metals on
their diffusion rate with Inconel (columbium melts
at 4380°F; tantalum melts at 5425°F) It was -
also desired to compare the proper’rles of The

Examination of the composite after rolling at

Both ﬂcn‘-nosed and 45-deg tapered dummy

devu:mons in thickness were about 15%. The

‘inner layer in both extrusions was thinner than

desired. In the three-ply extrusions, the inner

 cladding was thinner and the outer cladding
!’rhlcker by 15% than had been calculated. The

since both compression and tension were evident.

Tensile forces prevclled in the outer and inner

layers, while compression forces prevailed in the
zone in between. The original 0.010-in.-thick
molybdenum washers varied in thickness from
about 0.003 in. near the tube walls to 0.050 in.
at the middle of the tube wall,

The displacements of the mo[ybdenum washers
from their starting positions were noted. After
extrusion, the washers could be located as
coordinates of a parabola of revolution, with the
axis being the center line of the tube. The shapes
of the separate washers differed along the length
of the extrusion. It is evident that because of the
tensile forces near the tube walls the flaws in
this zone in the starting billet will result in flaws
in the extrusion,

Oxidation Tests of Alummum Brouze -

The aluminum bronzes are bemg considered as

cladding material for the oxidation protection of

copper fins for radiators, Therefore oxidation
tests of several commercial bronzes were conducted
in air at 850°C. The weight gains of the alloys
as a function of time are shown in Fig. 6.22.

Lead-Calcium Alloys

The chemical-analysis technique for evaluating
the creep resistance of lead-calcium alloys was
investigated. It was determined that chemical
analyses were not indicative of the creep per-
formance of these alloys, because the normal
scatter of the data on the calcium content frequently

exceeded the desired calcium content of between

0.03 and 006%. The strengthenmg effect of

calcium can be realized only if it is present in
solid solution or as a compound with lead; that
is, if a portion of the calcium is presem‘ as Ca0,
the beneficial effects of the calcium are lost,
Since the chemical analysis gives the total
calcium rather than the CaO content of the alloy,
the chemical analyses can serve only as a guide

in the evaluation of the creep performance. For

example, three alloys calculated to contain 0.06%
calcium on the basis of analyses of three master
alloys containing 2% total calcium were found by
chemical analysis to contain 0.043, 0.030, and
0.059% calcium, respectively. In cantilever creep
tests at room temperature and 750-psi stress, the
deflections of these alloys at the end of a 2-in.
beam were 0.87, 0.33, and 0.54 cm, respectively.

ART FUEL TO NaK HEAT EXCHANGER

J L. Wantland
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

For the recent experiments with the ART fuel-to-
NaK heat exchanger! the tube bundle was heated
by passing an electric current through it; water
was circulated outside the tubes, but there was
no fluid flow Through the tubes. The fuel heat
transfer coefficients were determined by measuring
tube-wall and mixed-mean-fluid temperatures, as
well as heat transfer rates. As is shown in
Fig. 7.2, the data obtained corroborated the heat
transfer coefficients previdusly determined by
using the apparatus as a water-sto-water heat
exchanger.

Also, the heat transfer and isothermal friction
characteristics of the fuel side of the heat
exchanger were determined with all the tube
spacers removed from the tube bundie, except for
one horizontal and one vertical spacer at opposite
ends_.' In Figs. 7.2 and 7.3 the data are compared
with previous data taken with all the spacers in
the heat exchanger. As was to be expected, both
the heat ftransfer coefficients and the friction
factors decreased upon removal of the tube
spacers,  The difference is partially due to the
spacers creating form drag and inducing some

__additional turbulence, However, when the spacers
' were removed the tubes were not rrgldly held, and

no results were obtained on this mixture. It did
not have the turbid appearance characteristic of

full of air bubbles. lts viscosity appeared to be

The low viscosity values obtained for salt &
suggested the possibility that research with

. systems containing RbF might produce a satis-

factory fuel with a viscosity lower than that of
the zirconium-base fuel now being considered for
the ART. Salt b, which is, approximately, a
prototype of the proposed ART fuel, with RbF
substituted for NaF, was therefore investigated,
It was found to have a kinematic viscosity about
20% lower than that of the corresponding NaF
mixture, Further research and the use of higher
purity RbF might produce fuels with even lower
viscosities.

The previously described! loop in which fluoride
fuel was circulated in a horizontal beam hole
(HB-2) in the LITR was examined visually, metal-
lographically, and chemically for effects of the
irradiation. During operation of the loop the maxi-
mum fuel temperatures were 1450 to 1500°F; the
fuel Reynolds number was 4500 to 6200 or about
5000 for most of the operation; the power gener-
ation in the fuel was about 2.8 kw; the power
density was 0.4 kw/;m3; and the duration of oper-
afion was 645 hr, with the reactor at full power
(3 Mw) for 475 hr.
From flux measurements in the empty beam hole,

it was eshmm‘ed that the power generated in the
loop should be con5|derab|y higher than the 2.8

'in a simu!rated loop nosepiece. An assembly that

duplicated the irradiated portion of the loop was
made up and was filled with a 2% Cd-98% Pb
alloy, which had the same macroscopic absorption
cross section as the fuel salt. This assembly
was inserted in a water-cooled jacket in hole
HB-2, The neutron activation of the cadmium-
lead alloy was measured, and the relation between
the activation and the neutron flux was established
by calibrating the data for the alloy with cobalt-
foil data. Because of uncertainty regarding the
position of the fluoride fuel loop in the hole, it

was not considered that this experiment gave a

reliable measurement of the ﬂux, however, the

flux distribution found did agree ‘with that cal-

culated from the heat balance data and that de.
termined subsequently from the cobalt foils that
monitored the fuel loop.

After disassembly of the loop in the hot cells,
a measurement of neutron flux was obtained from
the activity of cobalt monitor foils which were
at various points in a copper tube attached to
the nose of the loop. Since these foils were of
necessity outside the fuel tube, it was also neces-
sary to measure the activity of the Inconel fuel
tube. The neutron flux was calculated from the
data by using the relation, measured by Bopp,?
between the activity of the Inconel and the flux.
The neutron flux data obtained from the activities
of the cobalt foils and the Inconel are plotted
as functions of distance along the loop in Fig. 8.1.
The fission power calculated from the Inconel
activation was 2.8 kw, and the maximum power
density was 0.4 kw/em?3.

The fission power generated in the fuel was
also determined by measuring the activities of
fission products in the samples taken for chemicadl
analyses., The octivity of the fuel was obtained
with a gamma-ray spectrometer, and the height
of the zirconium-niobium peak was compared with

that of a standard. The zirconium-niobium concen-

tration corresponded to a fission power of 2.0 kw,

from this section of the loop showed the minimum

v:ously, was operafed in vertical position C-48

~of the L!T‘R( Because of faulty behavior of the

pump~ motor, the fuel flow velocity could not be
maintained at @ steady value, and the test was
incomplete as a corrosion study. [t was possible,
however, to make a fairly thorough study of in-
pile characteristics of the loop, which operated
for a total of 30 hr at full power, with a fuel
Reynolds number of 3200 to 5000, The operation
throughout this period was complicated by inter-
mittent pump motor trouble, and the experiment
was terminated when the motor stopped completely.

The instruments controlled the temperature satis-
focforily to within £5°F ond did not allow ex-
cessive excursions in temperature when the fuel
velocity chqnged rapid[y Several scram situations
occurred during the short run because of low pump
speed, high activity in the off-gas stream, and
a high temperature indication that resulted from
a thermocouple failure. All these situations were
adequctely hondled in ’rlme to prevent high-tempera-
ture excursmns _

Threg c_omponents of the loop were faulty: the
pu{ﬁip""""""mb‘fpf, the pressure transmitters on the
venturi ’rube, and the header box in the off-gas
system.  No complete explanation for the erratic
behdvior of the motor can be given, as yet, but

it appecrs that ’rhe combination of high temperature
~and very dry helium atmosphere caused brush

“The pressure tronsmtﬁers were unre[:cble, but

it does not appear that any changes which could

be made in a reasonable time would be of much

‘help. Therefore they are to be removed from the

system. Removal of the pressure cells will permit

“-“more of the loop to be lowered into the reactor.
- This will increase the total power generation and

will place the pomt of maximum temperature near

' fhe maximum neutron flux.

During the short irradiation of the first loop a

- gasket was blown out of the off-gas header box

located at the face of the reactor. This allowed
some leakage of activity into the midriff area of
the LITR. The header box is to be redesigned to
withstand the fuli, avculcble, air pressure without
leaking.

Since the flowmeter was moperoble, another
method of obtaining fuel velocities was devised.
The method used was to find the pressure de-
veloped at a given pump speed and to find the
change in pressure vs flow for the loop. These
values were measured byusing water as the pumped
fluid in exact duplicates of the pump and the loop.

heater spaced between the fins is provided for
additional control of the specimen temperature.
The control thermocouple on the inside of the
specimen tube should give very nearly the maxi-
mum temperature of the system at any time. Heat
transfer calculations predict that the fuel will
freeze at the outer walls of the fuel chamber so
that the fuel will be contained in a cup of solid
fuel; thus the surface-to-volume ratio of the test
system will be considerably lowered. |t does
not appear likely, at this time, that the tempera-
ture of the specimen can be maintained at the
control level during reactor shutdown perlods,
however, fuels with a power density of 1000 w/cm?®
are dlfﬁcuh‘ to simulate in bench tests of this
type of expenmenf. The gas space above the
fuel is connected through a capillary tube to an
expansion chamber to decrease the back pressure
on the specimen walls when the specimen is
brought up to temperature. The first group of
specimen assemblies is now being filled with
fuel for tests in the LITR. Engineering of the

 plug design to adapt the apparatus for insertion

in the MTR is under way.

A simplified version of the apparatus to permit
creep data to be obtained in any combination of
two nonfuel atmospheres is undergoing bench
tests prior to irradiation. Measurements of the
total strain in the specimen tubes will be ac-
complished with a pneumatic measuring gage.
Inside-diameter measurements of the specimen tube
can be made with an accuracy of about 0.00005 in.
with the pneumatic gage, and the manipulative
operations are simple enough to be done in a hot
cell.

The operahon of a number of pressure-reducing
valves, with pressure ranges from 200 to 1000 psi,
has been checked over a period of about a week.
Of the two valves presently being tested, one
appears to be capuble of holdmg set pressures

A 1:1 rcmo pressure-volume transformer for iso-

cause of the controlled limited volume of gas

The MTR (tensile) creep test apparatus was
irradiated for two cycles in hole HB-3 of the MTR
at 1500°F and 1500 psi. For some unknown reason,
two of the four Bourdon tube extensometers did
not operate after insertion in the reactor. There-
fore total creep measurements and a determination
of the effects of radiation on the calibration fac-
tors of the Bourdon tube extensometers will be
made when the apparatus is returned to Oak Ridge.
The apparatus has been cut from the irradiation

of the inspile rig in time, temperature, and siress

- schematic diagram of the location of the HB-3

beam hole in relation to the lattice is shown in

because of a need to know the fast-neutron flux
intensity and distribution available for tests of
structural properties of ART materials, For such
tests to be realistic, both a high-energy flux and a
high, integrated fast-neutron dosage were required.
Thermal-neutron flux data were also obtained for
estimating power generation in uranium-bearing

A series of measurements of flux depression in a
mockup of a fluoride~fuel in-pile loop section as a
function of amount of fuel present, wall thickness
of the container, and position of the container were
made in order to serve as a basis for design of a
loop for operation in HB-3 of the MTR. The values
of effective thermal-neutron flux obtained from this
experiment were used to calculate the total power
generation and power density to be expected in
the loop.

The apparatus for the series of measurements
consisted of two major pieces. The outer piece
was an Inconel cylinder 7 in. in length and hol-
lowed to contain a solid-cylinder core of the neu-

three cores with the reactor operating at 5 Mw are
shown in Fig. 8.16.

An operating power of 5 Mw, rather than the usual
30 Mw, was chosen because the gammaeray heat
at 30 Mw would have raised the temperatures of
the cores to above their melting points. The ther-
mal-neutron flux as a function of power was ob-
tained at two positions, as shown in Fig, 8.17, so
that the flux-depression data obtained in the S<Mw
runs could be scaled to 30 Mw. As may be seen,
the flux vs power curves are nonlinear between 20
and 30 Mw,

pected in the first MTR in-pile loop,'4 based on
these data and on the results of irradiation of a

perimental data for the beryllium chips indicate a
half life of 90 days, which agrees satisfactorily
with a listed'% value of 85 days. Both the gamma-

gamma rays are in cascade, as they are shown in
the listed decay scheme.

Another beryllium sample, from the R, D, MacKay
Company, was analyzed in the same manner for
scandium and was found to have about the same
amount present {Fig. 8.20). The beryllium«to-
scandium weight ratio for The Brush Beryllium Co.
sample, as measured by the gamma-ray scintillation
specirometer and the MTR 47 high-pressure ioniza-
tion chamber, was 6.8 x 104, For the R, D, Mac-
Kay Co. sample, it was 7.1 x 104, Therefore, the
scandium present in both samples was below the
limit of chemical detection stated above. |

n-Butyl Bromide Method

The n-butyl bromide method' is the standard
method used in the ANP Analytical Chemistry
Laboratory for determining oxygen in sodium. The
original method has, however, been modified re-
cently by two laboratories.2® In the modified
procedures the organic reagents, n-butyl bromide
and hexane, are purified and dried by passing them
through a column packed with silica gel and dia-
tomaceous earth. The purified reagents are stored
over P,O.. A modification of the reaction tube
has also been recommended to reduce atmospheric
contamination. The modified method is reported
to be very sensitive and to be applicable to the
defermmohon of oxygen in sodium in concen-
trations as low as 5 to 10 ppm. An evaluation of

- these modifications was therefore undertaken pre-

paratory to incorporating them in the standard
procedure,
‘The reagents, hexane and n-butyl bromide, were

purified and dried by passing the liquids through

columns packed with silica gel and dlq’romaceous
earth; they retained about 10 ppm water. They
were then rendered anhydrous by desiccation with
activated Al,O, or ons' The latter has the dis-
advantage that it reacts with the water in the
reagents to form acids which remain in the liquid
phase in sufficient concentration to cause low
results in the oxygen determination. Such an

error can become significant when the reagents

are stored over P, O, for extended periods. Also,
anhydrous reagents become contaminated with
water when exposed to the atmosphere. Wet re-

agents lead to high results in the oxygen determi-

nation.

The n-butyl bromide procedure was further modi- |

fied so that an atmosphere of argon was maintained
over the reagents and reaction mixtures at all

times. In addition, transfer of the reagents from

the storage vessel to the reactor tube was carried
out by applying pressure with dry argon. The
modifications are illustrated in Fig. 9.1. Excel-
lent reproducibility was obtained in the determi-
nation of oxygen in sodium with the modified
apparatus when the samples were taken in glass
tubes. The oxygen content of the majority of the
samples received from ANP facilities was in
excess of 200 ppm. Much lower concentrations,
of the order of 20 to 40 ppm of oxygen, were found

The n-butyl bromide method was also used to

The interior of such sample
tubes was found to be effectively cleaned of

' oxygen com‘alnmg lmpurmes by treating with

. multibulb tube is required to accomplish the
. cleaning action with sodium. -

Vocuum-Dlshlluhon Method

A method is being ‘tested for the determmctlon

' of_ oxygen in sodium by titration of the Na,O that
‘remains after vacuum distillation of the sodium
.. metal. A distillation apparatus has been con-

structed that is srmllor to one developed by the

Argonne National Loborotory ~The vacuum-

~distillation method of analysis is particularly
‘suited to the sampling of sodium at operating

temperatures of the order of 1200°F and obviates
the necessity for precooling the sodium before
sampling. A schematic diagram of the equipment
is shown in Fig. 9.2.

The sample of molten sodium is introduced into
the evacuated apparatus through a heated transfer
line, which is maintained at the operating tempera-

ture of the system being tested. The metal flows

directly into a calibrated, hemispherical sample

‘cup, which is fitted with a thin, nickel liner. A

volume of sodium sufficient to flush the transfer

‘line and sample cup is first passed through the

apparatus. The excess sodium, which pours over
the edge of the somple cup, is discharged into

_a glass reservoir in which the volume of the flush

VOLUMETRIC DETERMINATION OF ZIRCONIUM
IN FLUORIDE SALTS WITH DISODIUM
DIHYDROGEN ETHYLENE-
DIAMINETETRAACETATE (EDTA)

A. S, Meyer, Jr. D. L. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

A volumetric method for the determination of
zirconium in mixtures of fluoride salts was de-
veloped. This method, which was outlined in the
previous repon‘,5 was based on the work of Fritz
and Johnson. ®

The procedure consists in adding an excess of
EDTA to a sulfate solution containing zirconium
and titrating the excess with trivalent iron to a
Tiron  (disodium-1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disul-
fonate) end point at a pH of 4.8. The color change

at the end point is from yellow to purple. The-

method is applicable to the determination of zir-
conium in the presence of sulfate, tartrate, smatl
amounts of fluoride, and hexavalent uranium. The
yellow color of hexavalent uranium seriously
interferes with the bismuth-thiourea end point
proposed by Fritz and Johnson.®

There are relatively few cationic interferences,
because zirconium and iron form extremely stable
complexes with EDTA. In the back-titration with
trivalent iron the purple color of the iron-Tiron
complex is not obtained until the metal-EDTA
complexes, which are less stable than the iron
- (IIH=EDTA complexes have been dissociated,

.....Fluoride ion concentrations of up to about 0.1 M
. do not appear to interfere with the titrimetric pro-
.- cedure, Higher concentrations of fluoride ion can

be effectively reduced by adding beryllium to the
solution prior to the addition of the EDTA, The
interference is removed through the formation of
- complex

" With a slight modification in the experimental

o 'rocedure, the method is opphcoble to the determi-
nohon of znrcomum m the presence of moderofe

Properties Section of the Reactor Experimental
Engineering Division, The concentration of
oxygen in the atmosphere of a 21-ft° rectangular
dry box was measured as a function of time while
argon was being passed through the box at a
constant flow rate. Oxygen concentrations in
excess of 1% were measured volumetrically by
absorption of oxygen in pyrogallol. Lower concen-
trations were determined by a modification of the
Winkler technique in which a suspension of
Mn(OH) in an alkaline solution of Kl is equi-
IIb!‘leECl with a measured volume of gas. The
iodine, whlch is equwaienf to the oxygen in the
sample, is liberated upon acidification of the
solution and is determined colorimetrically or by
titration th N025203 o

~When the gases in the dry box are thoroughly
agitated by means of a blower, the oxygen concen-
tration decreases exponenhcily with the volume
of sweep gos in accordance with theoretical
prediction. The oxygen can be eliminated more
rapidly by introducing the more dense argon at
the bottom of a quiescent dry box. Helium, when
introduced at the top of the box, provides a some-

"ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

- This 'mefhod mvolves the reaction of a metal
w ‘oxide with bromme vapor, in the presence of
_"_'_’_f‘igraph:te, to form the metal bromide and CO. The
~CO is then oxidized to CO, by reaction with hot
 f Cu0. The amount of CO evolved is a measure
o of fhe oxygen ortgmol[y present in the sample,
,_fThe opparatus for this analysis was described
e prev:ously
The prlmary objective of recent work has been
S fo find the ophmum conditions for the determi-
e nahon of oxygen in ZrF,. The oxygen in this
S A';Z':}salt is present as ZrO or ZrOF2 or, possibly,
el bo’rh compounds
S An oﬁempi was made to analyze synthetic
_---'f-mlxtures of Zr02 and ZrF by the bromination
‘method. The recovery of oxygen as CO,, was
f:ffmcomplete in all cases. Analyses of samples of
_‘-'r-_»pure Z:0, by the bromination method also resulted
©in lncomplete recovery of the theorehcal amount
T 'f-j{;of oxygen.
.7 Several experimental conditions were varied in
| lfi',,,"':_:these mveshgotlons The length of the platinum
. “.beats was changed from ] to 3 in., and in some
- experiments the sample wcs contomed on a sheet
- of platinum. The weight of ZrO, was varied from
3 to 50 mg, and the ratio of ZrO, to graphite was

< varied from 1:2 to 1:20. In one experiment, sugar

-'_‘.:_"'-fcharcoal was substituted for the graphite.
In these studles with ZrO2
’ tcuned und the res;duol Zr02, which remalned in
"Z,',the reacflon boat, were determined. The reaction
involved in fhe initial step of the analysis is

ZrO + 28!2 + 2C-——>ZrBr + 2CO

:L';Therefore any ZrO which did not react with fhe-
bromine should be found in the boat. The amounts

   
  
  
 

of CO, obtained from these samples appeared to
_'ceed the amount of oxygen actually removed
from fhe ZrO This has been attributed, in part,
o the presence of moisture in the graphite.

both the CO ob-

| of TiO, remaining in the plafindm-(beefz'c'ffer;d:': o
| 2-hr penod of bromination was determined in these

studies. Cqmplete removal of the T|02, as the
bromide, from the boat was achieved when the
oxide and graphite, approximately 15 mg each,
were mixed together with a mortar and pestle.

When the two materials were mixed by using a

spatula, quantative removal of TiO, from the
boat was not obtained; however, when fhe mixing
was done with great care, up to 95% of a 10-mg
sample of TiO, could be removed as TiBr4' in 2 hr,

The sample preparation described by Codell
and Norwitz® consists in placing titanium chips,
metal or alloy, between two layers of graphite.
In this case, it is probable that the volatilization
of the metal as a bromide would leave the re-
maining TiO, in intimate contact with the graphite,
without the need of external mixing. It would also
be probable that, in the determination of the oxide
contamination of salts that are volatile at moderate
temperature, there would be no need for tedious
sample preparation. For a determination of oxygen
in a material containing greater than 1% oxide,
it would be advisable to ensure an intimate mixture
of the sample and graphite. The information
gained in the study of the bromination of TiO,
will be applied to the determination of oxygen in
Zr0, and other oxides of interest.

The formation of a precipitate on the surface
of the BG(OH)2 bubbler, which was reported pre-
vnously, was prevented by inserting a thin
platinum tube inside the ignition tube. It was
necessary to use this platinum tube only during
the analysis of samples containing fluorides. |t

"is believed that the contact of volatile fluoride

salts with the hot quartz of the ignition tube re-
sulted in the formation of SiF,. This gas reacted
with the solution of Ba(OH), to precipitate
BaSiF . The platinum liner inserted in the ignition
tube prevented the formation of SiF .

Carbon monoxu:le is ollowed fo react W|'rh 0.01 megq
of PdCl in 0.001 N HCI; the solution also con-
tains MgCI to flocculate the colloidal palladium
that is formed in the reaction. The net increase
in hydrogen ion concentration, determined by
hfrchng with a base and using an indicator of
bromophenol blue, is a measure of the CO that
was originally present. ‘In the present study, it
was necessary to use a greater amount of PdCl,

(1 meq) and to eliminate HCI in the preparahon

of the reagent. Poiassium chloride proved to be

an effective substitute for HCl in the dissoluhon
of PdCI :
Tifrchons of synthetic mixtures of HCl and

- PdCI2 were performed to find suitable conditions
for a determination of HCl in such solutions,

Since solutions of PdCl, exhibit considerable
buffering action at a pH of 4.5, it was not possible
to determine HCl in a solution of PdCl,,. Several
means of removing the palladium ion were investi-

- gated, and the addition of Kl was found to be

effective for this purpose. Excellent titration
curves ‘were obtcuned when an amount of Ki, in
excess of the amount of F’c{CI2 was added to the

solution containing HCI and PdCl, prior to the:

titration of HCI. The change in pH, during the

~ titration, was observed by means of a pH meter,
‘and plots of pH agcnnst ‘the quantity of base added

A project analysis will be completed soon that

will serve as a basis for establishing an accurate

. schedule for design and construction of the pilot

plant for recovering fused-salt fuels, A new cost

estimate will also be made. Certain delcys in

An engineering flowsheet was issued that is
subject to revisions as needed to stay abreast of
laboratory work. Approximately 65% of the proc-
ess equipment items are on hand or are in some
stage of procurement or fabrication.

downcomer in the phofograph. Novel features of
the design are the provision for inertgas blow-

‘back through the inlet pipe and the conical bottom

to minimize holdup within the valve and to lessen
the mechanical strain imposed by expansion of the

and thawing, this valve, when frozen, held against

" a test pressure of 20 psig without [eaking.

" The nature of gas dispersion through a percola-

 the liquid recifculdfion rate was measured as a
' functlon of gas flow rate, gas inlet configuration,
“and percolotor tube length, diameter, and sub-

An Improved procedure for deconfcmlnufmg the

 

UFé product of the fluorination step was de-
veloped (Fig. 10.2). The procedure is based upon
UF  “absorption on NaF at 100°C and desorption
by heating to 400°C, with the product gas passing

through a second bed of NaF before collection of

the UF . in a cold trap. The over-all gamma de-
contammcn‘lon factors of greater than 10° that were
obtained are to be compared with the decontamina-
tion factors of only about 104 obtained with the
process in which a single bed at 650°C! or at
100 to 400°C was used. In the single-bed proc-
ess, cross contamination occurred because of the
use of the same lines for collecting the product
and for handling the waste gases containing small
amounts of fission products, and, as a result, the
decontamination factors are much lower in re-used
equipment than in new equipment. Since fission
products never enter the product-collection system
in the two-bed process, decontamination factors of
greater than 10° were obtained in re-used equip-
ment, Preliminary results indicated that the use
of nitrogen as a sweep gas in both the fluorination
and the NaF absorption and desorption steps re-
duced the amount of fluorine required for the
process. o

| 18-in.-long bed of NaF was used. The UF, efflus

ent from the fluorinator was passed through this
bed at 100°C, and then the flow was cut off while
the bed was heated to 400°C to desorb the UF .
As shown by analyses of the contents of the cold
trap after the absorption step and of the residual
NaF after the desorption step, 50 to 90% of the
volatile ruthenium passed through the NaF at
100°C, and more than 99% of the absorbed ruthe-
nium was not desorbed on heating to 400°C, Es-
sentially afl the niobium was absorbed at 100°C
and was not desorbed at 400°C, which gives a
decontamination factor of about 10% for the absorp-
tion-desorption step. When new tubing and equip-
ment were used, the over-all decontamination fac-
tors for the single-bed process were about 104
(Table 10.1). |

When the gas lines and equipment were re-used,

‘ruthenium that had been deposited in them in pre-

vious runs prevented good product decontamina-
tion, To avoid this contamination, two 9-in,-long
beds were fried. The UF, was absorbed in the
first NaF bed, the unabsorbed fission products

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

being collected in a cold trap. The line to the
cold trap was closed during the desomption step,
and the product stream was passed through the
second NaF bed for absorption of any fission prod-
ucts desorbed from the first bed or from the walls
of the lines between the first and second beds
(Fig. 10.2). In two test runs, UF, product con-
taining about the same beta and gamma activity as
natural uranium, or less, was obtained, The gross
beta ot gamma decontamination factors for the
whole process were of the order of 105, Because
of the low product activity, calculation of the
various specific decontamination factors was not
practical, The effectiveness of the method, how-
ever, was shown by the distribution of activities in
the two NaF beds and the cold trap used in the
absorption step (Table 10,2),

A yield of only 40% was obtained in the two runs
because of poor temperature control of the 9-in.«
fong beds. In two later runs, 6-in.-long beds with
better insulation and heating control gave yields
of 90 to 100% with the same high decontamination
factors of about 105, The same NaF was used in

rithe second run"a‘s in the flrst ond 'rhus, for the

first time, it was established that activity can be
~prevented from seriously contaminating the product
- UF process lines. Since the NaF/U weight ratio
in each run was 4, the over-all ratio after the
second run was 2,

The uranium loss in the cold trap used in the
absorption operation at 100°C varied from less
than 0.001 to 0.04% in the four runs with the two
beds. Less than 0,1% of the total uranium proc.
essed was found in the NaF in the two runs with
the use of the same NaF beds.

in the last two runs, an equal-volume mixture of
fluorine and nitrogen was used for the fluorination
until about 75% of the uranium had been volati-
lized, pure fluorine being used to remove the last

- of the uranium from the molten salt, The induction

period observed previously? was eliminated, and
uranium losses in the waste salt were only 0.013

and 0.004% with F,/U mole ratios of 3.7 and 5,
respectively. The over-all F,/U mole ratios, in-
cluding the fluorine used for desorbing UF, from
the NaF, were 5.6 and 6.7, which are somewhat
lower than the ratio of 9 used in previous! NaF
decontamination studies. |

Preliminary results also indicated that nitrogen
can be used to replace part of the fluorine used in
the NaF desorption step. A 10-g charge of 12- to
40-mesh NaF in a "/Z-in.-dia nickel tube at 100°C
was saturated with about 9.5 g of UF, and then
raised to 400°C for approximately 30 min to desorb
the UF, while nitrogen was being passed through
the tube at a rate of 200 ml/min. In two trials,
approximately 80% of the UF, was removed, This
method has not yet been used with activity present.

A survey of spherically symmetric unit shields
for circulating-fuel reactors was made, and weight
estimates for unit shields with various dose rates
at 50 ft are presented. The chief sources of radia-
tion in a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor for the
NJ-1 power plant were determined. A parametric
weight study of the shield weight dependence on
the dimensions of a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor
is described,

WEIGHTS OF SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC UNIT
SHIEL DS FOR CIRCULATING- FUEL REACTORS

Y survey of spherically symmetric unit shields
for circulating-fuel reactors was made for a range
in dose rate of 0.1 to 10 rem/hr at a distance of 50
ft and a range in reactor power of 100 to 300 Mw,
An estimate was obtained for the added weight of
an NaK-to-NaK secondary heat exchanger and its
shielding. This additional weight is quite sensi-
tive to the manner in which the dose rate is divided
between the secondary heat exchanger and the
reactor and to the absolute value for the sodium
activation. Consequently, the estimates must be
interpreted as indicating trends rather than absolute
values.

The reactor dimensions for this survey were
scaled from those glven previously ! for a 300-Mw
reactor having a power density of 2.75 kw/cm ’

alkylbenzene in such a manner as to attenuate the
neutrons as rapidly as the gamma rays and, thus,
to ensure the effectiveness of the lead; this method
is conservative. An analysis of data from the
current L TSF circulating-fuel reflector-moderated-
reactor and shield tests (see Sec. 12) should make
possible a shield arrangement that would result in
a saving of several thousand pounds of thick
gammea-ray shielding for unit shields. Additional
weight savings could be achieved by shield-shaping
according to the particular aircraft application and .
configuration. The source of data for the sodium
activation for these calculations was the current
LTSF tests, teported previously.? Results of this
survey are given in Table 11.1 and Fig. 11.1,

This mockup contained 4.5 in. of lead and 2%
boron in the water. As yet, the thermal-neutron
fluxes cannot be calculated for the reactor in this
region, Also, the degree of boration to be used
has not yet been determined. Consequently, the
capture data for the lead and alkylbenzene are
based on the assumption that the fraction of the
neutrons captured in the LTSF mockup applies to
the reactor, corrected only for neutron self-shielding

SHIELD WEIGHT DEP ENDENCE ON

THE DIMENSIONS OF A 300-Mw

CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTOR
" A parametric weight study that is nearing com-
pletion indicates that lighter shield weights for
circulating-fuel reactors may result from changes
in reactor dtmensmns. The shield weights are
belng determined for a fixed reactor power (300
Mw) and a ‘‘standard shield”’ (described below)
as a function of power density, islond radius,

“reflector thickness, and heat exchanger thickness.

The weights obtained will be used as part of the
input information in a parametric performance
study under way ot Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,

The standard shield consists of a set of specifi-
cations suff|c1en’r|y representative of tactical
bomber shaelds to ensure a realistic reactor op-
timization. Some concessions to e-xpedlency were
made, such as the selection of sea-level altitude
and a recctor-’ro-crew-compartment separation
distance of 64 ft, in order to make direct use of

regions, the various dose-rate components were
treated separately to account for the different
attenuation characteristics in the shielding ma-
terials. In considering air scattering, the dose
rate from neutron captures near the outer lead
surface was treated as a separate isotropic source
that was relatively independent of lead thickness.

A second difference arises from the use of TSF
fast-neutron experimental data for air scattering
and crew-cempcrtmem‘ penetration and the use
of an optimized shape for the neutron reactor
shield and the crew-compartment wall thickness.
A third difference arises from the use of a tapered

shadow shield.

For these calculations, the crew compartment
was assumed to be a right cylinder, with an area
of 35 ft2 on the rear and 225 ft* on the sides.
Plastic and lead were the shield materials used
to give a neutron dose rate of 0.25 rem/hr and a
gamma-ray dose rate of 0.75 rem/hr in the crew
compartment at sea level. The reactor-to-crew-
compartment separation distance used was 64 ft.
The reactor shield, which consisted of lead and
alkylbenzene (330°F), was designed to give a
maximum dose rate of 1000 rep/hr at 50 ft (as-
sumed radiation damage restriction).

The neutron shield was chosen in the following
manner, For a typical aircraft reactor (Table
11.2), the fast-neutron dose rate as a function
of the thickness of the spherical shield was ob-
tained by the application of conventional meth-
ods®? to data from the current LTSF circulating-

the plastic thickness at the rear of the crew com-
partment was 43 cm and at the side, 14 cm, Be-
cause the neutron shielding on the crew compart-
ment was unchanged throughout the parameter

study, the fast-neutron dose rate at 64 ft from

the reactor at the various values of the reactor
angle @ (where 0 is the angle measured with re-
spect to the reactor-to-crew-compartment axis)

- also remained unchanged. A parameter change

in the reactor that resulted in a change in the
fast-neutron dose rate at any angle ¢ was com-

" pensated for by an adjusiment of the neutron

shielding at that angle 6 to keep the fast-neutron
dose rate at 64 ft constant. In the TSF calcula-
tions, the angular distribution of the neutrons
escaping from the reactor shield surface was
assumed to be éos Y in calculating the direct
dose, where ¢ is the angle measured with respect
to the normal to the shield surface, while radial
emission was cssumed for the calculation of the
scattered dose.

With the neutron shielding fixed, the gamma-ray
shielding was taken to consist of four components:
the basic lead shield required to maintain a maxi-
mum dose rate of 1000 rep/hr at 50 ft (an crbn‘rary
radiation damage limitation); the shaped lead
shadow shield adjacent to the basic shield; the
lead on the side and front of the crew compart-
ment; and the lead on the rear of fhe crew come
partment,  The shadow shield was arbitrarily
shaped to permit the dose emission per unit
angle § to increase exponentially to compensate
for the exponential decrease in the probability
of scattered radiation penetrating the crew-
compartment side'® as 6 increased. An approxi-
mation for the effect of the angular distribution

-of the gamma rays escaping from the reactor
- shield surface wds made by assuming a ‘‘dis-
‘ 'cldvanfage angle a (assumed to be 15 deg) when
:cclcula’rmg the scattered radiation penetrating

the crew compartment. This assumption results

in a constant thickness portion of the shadow

reaches zero. The tapered section ends at 6§ = 63
deg for a 3.23-in. shadow shield shaped with a
12.5-deg relaxation angle and a 2.1-cm relaxation
fength in lead for the primary dosé. The basic
lead shield does not have a constant thickness
but decreqses from rear fo front 1o compensate
for the increased gamma—ay attenuation from the
increasing neutron shield thickness along a radial
path., |

The gamma-ray shield division chosen, under
the ‘assumptions outlined above, consisted of
0.1 in. of lead on the crew-compartment sides
and approximately 6 in. of lead, ‘in addition to
the basic shield for the direct dose, which was
divided into a 2.56-in, shield on the crew-compart-
ment rear and a 3.23-in.-thick tapered shadow
shield near the center; the exact d|v15ton of the
basic shield was not sensitive wsth respect to
weight, The shadow shield was in direct con-
tact with lead in most of the cases considered.

. Spacing was. employed, however, for some cases

in which the reflector was thin and for which the
secondary gamma-ray dose contribution was large.

The first step in the weight calculations was
to determine the shield necessary to give the
design dose rates from the rear of the shaped
reactor shield. The design dose rates were
108 rem/hr at 50 ft for fast neutrons (10,8 rep/hr)
and 1000 rem/hr at 50 ft for gamma rays (1000
rep/hr),

Neutron Shield

The neutron-attenuation data were taoken from
fast-neutron dose-rate curves obtained at the
LTSF by using the Glass-Hurst fast-neutron
dosimeters and the Hornyak button. The data
were extrapolated for thicknesses beyond the
range of the LTSF fast-neutron dose-rate instru-
ments by means of thermal-neutron-flux traverses
in the LTSF and fast-neutron dose-rate measure-
ments at the TSF. Neutron dose-rate curves were
available for beryllium reflector moderator regions

Gamma-Ray Shield

" The gammeo-ray shield was determined by finding,
separately, the gamma-ray dose rate at 50 ft caused
by (1) gamma rays emitted by the fuel in the core
and by neutron captures in the outer core shell and
in the reflector, (2) gomma rays emitted by fission
products in the heat exchanger, and (3) neutron

nger ‘mockup havmg a composmon of

contributions were determined separately and then

were divided into contributions from the source

in the natural uranium of the source plate, three-
eights of the thermal-neutron captures take place
in U238 and give radiative capture gamma rays
that are not present in the enriched reactor, Un-
fortunately, the energies and associated probabili-
ties of emission per capture for these gamma rays
are not known. For this study, a total energy of
6.4 Mev per U238 capture was assumed to be
emitted in a distribution corresponding to the
fission gamma-ray distribution,  Similarly, for
radiative capture in U235, a total energy in gamma
rays of 7.6 Mev per nonfission capture was as-
sumed. The fraction of gamma-ray dose attributable
to U233, t, in the source plate was then taken to

measurements). This ratio was 0.0592/0.0145 or
4.00. The contribution from the island was calcu-
lated to increase this to 4.05,

 The fraction of neutrons captured in the Inconel
core shell in the reactor was estimated in the same
manner as that from the reflector and was checked
against foil data from the Critical Experiment
Facility. The fraction captured in the LTSF mock-
up was also determined by integration of gold-foil
‘measurements. The scaling factor for the outer
core shell contribution is the ratio 0.0545/0.0161
or 3.39. Similar corrections applied to the inner
core shell raised the scalmg factor for the core
shells to 3.62. ,

- For each reflector thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.)
and for each lead fhlckness (3, 4.5, and 6 in.),

" these correction factors were applied to the com-
 ponents determined from the LTSF data. The

‘variation of the reflector component of the total
gamma-ray dose rate with reflector thickness, as
obtained from the LTSF dm‘a, was observed to be
in agreement wn‘h the variation for a reactor, as
determined in PWA-NDA multigroup calculations,
and therefore it was assumed that nonc of the
scaling factors changed with reflector thickness,

- The static source tests of the second series of

the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated-reactor and

Gummu- Ruy and Neutron Measmements

Neutron and gamma-ray measurements were made
in water beyond the RMR-shield mockups to de-
termine the effect of placing an intermediate or
high atomic weight material immediately behind
the beryllium reflector, varying the thickness of
the reflector, and d:stribufmg the lead gommo-roy
shield in borated water,

_obsorphon of capfure gamma rays; fhe fcst neutron

dose rate was the same as that for an equivalent
thickness of beryllium, Although the 2-in.-thick
layer of copper would not be sufficient to effect
an appreciable weight saving, there might be
enough self-absorption of capture gamma rays in a
4-in.-thick layer to show a valuable weight saving.

The effect on the total gomma-ray dose rate of
varying the beryllium thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.)
was not appreciable. There was greater attenuc-
tion of the source gamma rays by the larger berylli-
um thicknesses, but more capture gamma rays
resulted from the beryllium, Fast-neutron dose
rates were not very different behind the various
thicknesses.

A study of the effects of distributing the lead
gamma-ray shield in borated water was also made
in order to obtain the information needed for an
optimization of the placement of the lead, This
study showed that there would probably be no
weight saving as a result of distributing the lead
rather than placing it in one piece, for lead thick-
nesses up to 5 in., but that there might be an ap-
preciable weight saving as a result of distributing
the lead beyond the first 5-in. layer. The secondary
gamma-ray dose rate produced in the lead and
borated-water shield fell off at the same.rate as
the thermal-neutron flux and thus was apparently

" caused by thermal-neutron captures in the shield.

-+ Sodium Activation in the Heat
Exchanger Region of the Mockups

Sodtum activation tests were performed to de-

ll termlne the achvcmon of the coolant in the heat

| fect_on the achvahon of p!acmg a copper gamma-

ray' shield ‘immediately behmd the beryllium

straight line was drawn through the two points

because of the lack of more information. Addi-

tional information probably would show these
curves to be slightly concave downward, as in the

198

cases where three heat exchanger tanks were used,
The five tests shown in Fig. 12,1 are representa-
tive of the results obtained to date. A more com-
plete analysis of all tests is being prepared.

If test 2 is used as a reference, comparison of
the activations in the different tests shows the
effect of adding or removing different components
of the configuration, In tests 1 through 4, 8 in, of
beryllium was used to simulate the reflector,
while in test 5, 12 in. of beryllium was used.

Comparing test 1 (4-in.-thick exchanger) with
test 2 (6-in.-thick heat exchanger) shows that
there is greater relative activation in test 2; this
results from the reduced resonance-neutron escape
probability in the thicker heat exchanger. The
escape probability may be increased simply by

distributing the boron curtain through the heat

exchanger region, [n test 4, a distributed curtain
containing less curtain material reduced the total
activation to about 25% below that found in test 2.

An increase in the reflector thickness from 8 in.
(test 2) to 12 in. (test 5) effected a decrease in
the sodium activation of about 80%. This was due
to two effects: an inverse-square spreading and a
reduction by the extra 4 in. of beryllium of the
number of neutrons at and slightly above the sodium
resonance energy of 3 kev, »

fn test 3, o gamma-ray shield of copper was
placed between the beryllium reflector and the first
boron curtain. The sodium activation was increased
by a factor of roughly 6, in comparison with the
activation found in test 1 with no copper present
in the reflector, The copper apparently changes
the fast-neutron spectrum so that there are relatively
more neutrons at or just above the 3-kev resonance
level of sodium. The boron curtain is only gray to
neutrons of this energy, and, hence, some of these
neutrons diffuse through the boron curtain into the
heat exchanger, where they are slowed down to the
3-kev resonance level by the fluorine.

“of the relatlvely poor statistics in these

 The electronic instruments cssoc:qted with ’rhe

o fhat the counhng rote assocmted with a predeter-
' mined photon energy interval was available at any

given time after fission. A time analyzer recorded
this counting rate as a function of time in 40 time

" channels. These time channels were larger for

the longer times after fission so that the number of
counts received in the various time channels
would not vary too widely. In the phase of the
experiment discussed here, the first time channel
was about 1.6 sec wide, and the last was about
10 sec wide,

Photon energy calibrations were made by using
Hg2093, Na22, Zn65, F20, 7,90m ThC'', and N16
sources, Calibrations of the time analyzer were
obtained by using a 60-cycle pulser.

The efficiency of the spectrometer as a function
of energy must be known in order to interpret the
data in terms of photons per second leaving the

vranium sample, In the energy region up to 1.3

Mev, the efﬂmency was determined by using the
ubsolu)‘e source strength of Hg203, Na?2, Cs137,

at least 10%. The thermal flux and the macro-
scopic cross sections of the samples are also in
doubt. The effective thermal flux available to the
sample was measured by using gold foils and a
cadmium-difference technique.*  Thermal cross

the region between 1.6 and 2.3 Mev was studied

the efficiencies of either type of spectrometer vary

In a previous report! an analysis of the fast-
neutron measurements of the differential shielding
experiment at the TSF was presented. In this
analysis the probability of the air scattering of
neutrons into the various sides of the crew-
compartment shield was obtained as a function
of the angle 8 which a fast-neutron beam from the
reactor shield surface makes with respect to the
axis joining the reactor and the crew compartment,

It also gave the probability of neutron penetration
" through the shield into the crew compartment as a

function of §. These probabilities have now been
used in the development of a procedure for opti-

" mizing the neutron shielding of a dwnded shield

for an aircraft,

'A further mveshgahon of the GE-ANP reactor
and crew shield mockups was also made. Measure-
ments of gamma-ray doses inside the crew-
compartment mockup were completed, and, at
present, a study of the distributions of gamma-ray
intensities around the reactor shield is bemg made.

reactor, The radius ¢ in Fig. 14.1 is the radius of
the reactor, heat exchanger, gamma shield, etc.,
and thus the outer radius is the 'sum of radius a
and the neutron shield thickness T ., The crew
shield is assumed to have a rear thlckness T and
a side thickness T_, For simplicity, and because
of the small sacrifice in shield weight involved,
the front thickness T{ is taken to be equal to the
side thickness T _,

The procedure consists, first, in expressing both
the total weight of the neutron shield and the
dose rate at the center of the crew compartment
as functions of T , T, and T ; second, of using
the method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain the
equations which T , T, and T_ must satisfy in
order that the weight be a minimum for a specified
total dose rate; and third, of developing an iterative
procedure for the solution of these equations.

in the dose rate at the center of the crew compart-
ment caused by the angular distribution of the
neutrons leaving the inside surface of the shield

Finally, the dose entering as a direct beam from
the reactor through the rear of the crew compart-
ment shield must be considered. Let the angular
distribution of dose from an element of area at
the surface of the reactor shield be of the form
cos™ i, where i denotes the angle between the
normal to the surface element and a given direction.
If it is assumed that the separation distance be-
tween the reactor and crew shield is large com-
pared with the outer radius of the reactor shield
and that the nth conical shell is in the hemisphere
toward the crew compartment, it may be shown

The complexﬁy of the sysfem of equohons de-

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

Equation 21 gives L in terms of quantities which
are either specified or determined from the previous
iteration, For the first iteration, fairly accurate
estimates can be made of the values of the quan-
tities in Eq. 21. Since D?‘f"“' << D, .oy and
AL/AG ~ 1, X, will be approximately equal to 1.
Also, GWfoml/aTr is a constant and oW . |/8TS
varies only slowly with T_ for a reasonable crew-
compartment size. The relaxation lengths AY and
Al can be chosen to be equal to some average
values from the TSF data to within about +25%
accuracy. Hence, in the first iteration, a reason-
ably good estimate of { is obtained.

Step b. Equation 17 divided by Eq. 16 and com-
bined with the condition Er = ES gives a relation-
ship between T, and T_ that involves appropri-
ately averaged relaxation lengths and three basic
parameters. One parameter involves the relative
rate of shield weight change with respect fo the
rear of the side shield thicknesses at the crew
compartment. The second parameter is the ratio
of the total air-scattered dose into the rear to that
into the side of the crew compartment. The third
parameter is closely related to the ratio of the
total direct-beam dose at the rear to the total air-
scattered dose at the side of the crew compartment.

In detail, the relationship discussed above is
obtained in the following manner. If Eq. 17 is
divided by Eq. 16 and the definitions for AY and A
given by Eq. 18 are used, there results

Equation 25 relates T, and T_ in terms of the
various averaged relaxation lengths and the three
pardmeters whose physical significances are dis-
cussed above. The first parameter discussed above
is the quantity a in Eq. 25. The second parame-
ter is the left bracketed term at the right side
of Eq. 25, and the third parameter is the right
bracketed term. In a given iteration the parameters
and averaged relaxation lengths are evaluated on
the basis of the information obtained in the pre-
vious iteration. In the first iteration, AS is taken
to be the same constant as that used for )ts in
Step a, etc. Also, for the first iteration, “the
reactor shield is taken to be of an unspecified

' umform thickness (T = a constant for all »), in

whuch case the bracke’red terms in Eq. 25 reduce to

Hence, in a given iteration, a plot can be made of
T, vs T, which, upon convergence to the required

In Eq. 27, Cn is set equal to L, as previously de-
termined in Step a, Eq. 21. By using the values
of A that are consistent with the results of the
previous iteration, the right side of Eq. 27 is cal-
culated for each n (n = 1, 2, ..., N) for various
assigned values of T_. From a plot of the left
side of Eq. 27 vs T, the values of T, correspond-
ingto each assigned value of T _ are then obtained.
Hence, plots can be made of T vs T _ for each n,

Step d. For various assumed values of T, values
of T  are obtained from the plots made in Step c.
These values are then inserted into Eq. 16, with
use being made of Eq. 9 and the definitions given
by Eg. 23 to compute the C for each T, A plot is
then made of .,C vs T_. The value of T, for
which the correSpondmg CS is equal to the value
of L determined in Step a, Eq. 21, is the required
T for. the given iteration. The corresponding
values of the T and T ,’s, for the given iteration,
are then obtained from the plots made in Steps b
and ¢c. By using the above-described procedure,
the various shield thicknesses T, T, and T, for
n=1,2, ..., Nare determined in a given iteration.
The entire procedure is repeated for the following
iteration, and the iferations are continued until
convergence is obtained,

shift is relatively small. Hence, the air-scattering
probabilities plotted in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3 were
taken, in the present calculations, to be inde-

pendent of the energy spectrum of the neutrons

emanating from the reactor shield (that is, inde-
pendent of T ). Also, values of *ﬁszea (6) were
measured only in the range of angles, 6 = 90 to
180 deg, wherein the direct- beum dose at the rear
of the simulated crew compartment was small com-
pared with the air-scattered dose. The values of
@Pfe (6) in Fig. 14.3 are extrapolated values in
the range of angles from 0 to 90 deg, the extrapola-
tion being guided by the variation of £2ps 6
measured for this range of angles.

“The TSF measurements show that the relaxation
length for the direct-beam fast-neutron dose is a
function of the total water thickness between the
reactor and the dose detector at the rear of the

crew compartment; that is, the relaxation length

is independenf of whether the water is at the

the plot is the shell thickness, T, plus the dis-
tance in the water at the rear of fhe crew-compart-
ment shield at which the relaxation length, A7, is
desired. If plastic, instead of water, is used as the
crew-compartment shielding material, the values
of AJ taken from Fig. 14.4 should be divided by
1.14 (based on removal cross sections).

In the TSF experiments, the scattered-dose re-
laxation lengths, AS, at the side of the crew-com-
partment shield were obtained as functions of
water thickness at the side for various values of
the angle 6. In these measurements, the fast
neutrons were filtered through 45 e¢cm of water at
the reactor, that is, T, = 45 cm. Plots of A3(45,x)
vs x for various angles O are presented in Fig.
14.5, where A3(45,x) is the A measured at water
thickness x into the side of the crew-compartment
shield for fast neutrons filtered through 45 cm of
water (T = 45 cm). For the neutron shield calcu-
lations, it is necessary to know the variation of
A, with reactor shield thickness, 7 . A limited
amount of data obtained for T = 15 cm, when
compared with the data for T = 45 em, indicates
that A7 varies with T, in the same ratio as does
the direct-beam relaxation length, A, This re-
fationship is reasonable in view of the small

the general validity of this relation. For a total
neutron attenuation through the crew-compartment

tion calculated for Tn =15 cm, on the basis of the

foregoing relationship, and the A2 values for T =45

The relaxation Iengths, Al for the air-scatfered

senha”y constant over the mecsured range of 0
and T At the mid-point of the measured range
of Tr which was approximately 15 cm, the A7
value was 7.0 ecm. It was assumed in the calcu-
lations “that this Al value also applied in the
range 6 = 0 to 90 deg In the same manner as
described for A$, the effect of T on Al was ac-
counted for by the relationship

S v T

For plastic insrecd of water at the crew shield,
both A% and A7 would be corrected in the same
manner as described for )\é.

An important limitation exists, however, in the use

of the air-scattering probabilities and relaxation

lengths p'r'esenfed here. In the TSF experiments,
' scoﬁered -dose measurements were not taken for
- TS or T, smaller than about 5 cm of water. Hence,
“fo obtain the dose for T orT, less than 5 cm,
the data were extrapolated to TS =0orT, =0.

= 45 em over a range of values

T, less than 5 cm are, hence, extrapolated values.

For T_ and T, greater than 5 cm, the use of the
plots, of course, leads to correct results (within
~the limitations previously discussed). However,

for T, ‘and T, less than 5 cm, the plots are only

as rellable as the extrapolation. Indications are

that for T_or T less than 5 c¢m, the relaxation
fengths AS and A7 change appreciably; hence it
does not appear advisable to use the plots for

crew shield thicknesses less than 5 ecm of water.

The concept of the focusmg factor f; and the
method of interpretation of the TSF experiments

to obtain an experimental value of f were dis-

cussed previously by J. E. Van Hoom:ssen.3 Van
Hoomissen obtained an average value of < of

5.3 over the range of angle 0 f-rom 0 to 180 deg,
" the variation of fs with 6 was small and well

within the stchshcal accuracy of the data. Com-
parison with the analytical results of Faulkner?

indicates that the angular distribution of the dose
at the inside surface of the crew-compartment side
shield is approximately cos®. In the TSF experi-
ments from which the value of /° of 5.3 was ob-
tained, the side shield thickness for the crew-
compartment mockup was about 38 cm of water.
Inasmuch as the angular distribution of the dose
at the inside surface of the crew-compartment
sides would be expected to vary with side shield
thickness, the focusing factor /7 is also expected
to vary “With side shield thickness; however,
Faulkner's results show that /% is not very sen-
sitive to angular distribution (/3 is 4.0 for cos
distribution and 6.5 for cos® distribution), In
the calculations, % was taken to be constant at
5.3. This value of /7 should be well within 25%
of the correct value, at least for side shield thick-
nesses greater than about two relaxation lengths
wherein the extremely slanted neutrons are atten-
uated.

From the table it may be seen that the iterative
procedure results in a reasonably rapid conver-
gence of the L’'s toward a constant value. A
better choice for the average relaxation lengths
used in the first iteration would have led, of

course, to a much more rapid agreement between

the Efs. The average relaxation lengths used
in the first iteration were A = 53 cm, AT = 6.0
cm, and A} = 8.5 cm. The results of the third

“iteration md:co’re that the correct averages are
_opproxtmotely )\S = 4,3 cm, Al = 54 em, and

= 8.7 cm. A fourth iteration would bring the

) :_'Q s into still closer agreement; however, the
o 'wetgh'r would not be affected appreciably. Also,
 the input data are not sufficiently accurate to
':"h—‘\give real meanmg to the small changes in the

 

 

thicknesses which would be required to give
exact agreement between the [’s.

It is desirable to place a limit on the dose rqtev‘
in the vicinity of the reactor shield from the view

point of neutron activation of aircraft components.
A reasonable limit is that the dose rate of 64 ft
from the reactor should not exceed 125 rem/hr,
From the curve of Fig. 14.6 it is seen that this
shield optimization gives a dose rate of approxi-
mately 600 rem/hr at 64 f from the rear of the
reactor. Thus, some correction should be made
to this shield. The limit on dose rate from the

rear of the reactor shield could be included as 7 -

another condition in the ophmlzcmon calculation;

however, it would introduce a second Lagrange

multiplier and seriously complicate the iterafive

procedure. A simpler procedure is, of course,»

merely to add sufficient shielding to the rear
conical shells to reduce the dose rate to the de-

sired level. While this procedure does not make

precisely optimum use of the added we:ghf the

fact that only 11 cm of additional water is re-
quired on the rear to reduce the dose rate to the

desired level indicates that the fe.s-_ults__wiil_"ﬁ'ot
be far from optimum. If the thicknesses of the

two rear conical shells of the calculated shield

 

 

 

 
i

were changed to 20 em (T5 =T

 

= 20 cm), the
weight of the shield would be increased by 0.57
ton, The final shield weight would thus be 10,22
tons. - B '

It may also be seen from Table 14.1 that the

“optimum shield has a ratio of crew-compartment
‘shield weight to reactor shield weight of approxi-
. mately 1.6, If the caleulation were carried out

for a larger crew compartment, this ratio would
decrease, and a larger fraction of the weight would

be shifted to the reactor shield. Thus, the larger

the crew compartment, the more nearly the limit
on dose rate at the rear of the reactor is satisfied
by the calculated optimum shield. Conversely,
if the crew compartment were smaller, weight

_ '_VIWO'UIVd-Vbe_ shifted from the ‘rea'cfor shield, and the
limit on the dose rate from the rear of the reactor
would be more seriously violated by the calcu-

lated optimum shield.

Dose-rate measurements (Fig. 14.8) along the
y axis (fore to aft) of the crew-compartment mock-
up indicate a relatively large contribution from
the sides of the mockup, with only a small amount
of radiation penetrating the shadow shield at the
rear of the mockup. Data for the curve labeled
““Compartment D Empty”’ were obtained when
compartment D of the reactor shield was filled
with air.

The gomma-ray dose rates in the front half of
the crew compartment mockup were measured with
the relative position of the crystal and preamplifier
reversed from that shown in Fig, 14.7. Shielding
the detector by the preamplifier and the Lucite
spacer resulted in a 10% reduction in dose when
data were taken in the front portion of the crew
