COMPATIBILITY TESTS OF MATERIALS FOR USE IN BEARINGS, SEALS, AND
VALVES IN FUSED FLUORIDES AT 1200°F

W. C. Tunnell

ABSTRACT

A series of tests were made for selecting combinations of materials compatible for possible

use in journal bearings, face seals, and valve seats operating in fused fluoride salts at 1500°F.

The test apparatus was designed to impose on the test specimen conditions similar tc those that

will be encountered in starting journal bearings and face seals from rest or in opening valves

which have been seoted for a considerable time.

These conditions are considered to be those

most likely to cause damage to the working surfaces.

Thirty=six combinations of ten different materials were tested in fused fluoride salts at 1200°F

with the use of an apparatus consisting of a pin sliding against a rotating plate under a fixed

[oad. The following combinations of materials showed sufficient promise to warrant further testing

at higher temperatures:

Kennametal 151A vs Adamas A
Adamas A vs Kennametal 138A
Kennametal 151A vs Norbide B4C

Kennametal 151A vs Carboloy 608
Kennametal 151A vs Kennametal 151A

Kennametal 151A vs High-Density Graphite

 

MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS

A basic requirement of materials used for pump
journal bearings, face-type shaft seals, and valve
seats in contact with fused fluoride salts at high
In addition
the materials must resist wear, galling, and self-
welding under severe operating conditions. There-

temperatures is corrosion resistance.

fore screening tests were developed to ascertain
the design limitations that materials might impose
on the Aircraft Reactor Test, in which a fused salt
mixture i s to be circulated at 1500°F, The selected
corrosion-resistant materials were screened for
compatibility under conditions that simulated, in
a general way, the operation of journal bearings,
face-type seals with boundary lubrication, or valve
seats under load in fused fluoride salts at 1200
to 1500°F.

It was originaily planned that the materials would
be given a preliminary screening test at 1200°F,
that those proving to be compatible would then
be further tested at 1350 and 1500°F, and that
any material proving to be compatible at 1500°F
would be tested as actual bearing pump and valve
components. However, tests at 1200°F were the
only ones performed, because the work was stopped
by higher priority projects.

SELF-WELDING AND FRICTION EFFECTS

In considering materials for high-temperature ap-
plication, it is recognized that any formed, smooth
surface has microscopic asperities. Also, it has
been reliably demonstrated that two such surfaces
in intimate sliding contact will generate sufficient
heat to cause welding and shearing of these minute
asperities as they come in contact under the ex-
treme unit pressures, or that the asperities will
shear without welding, or that they will slide “‘up
and over'’ each other and create frictional forces,
metal transfer, and/or surface damage. A similar
condition exists in a valve poppet and seat, and
it is intensified when the assembly is subjected to
a high temperature with high unit pressures at the
minute contact points; that is, a *‘weld'’ forms
through diffusion bonding of the metals. When the
valve is to be opened, the welds must be broken;
surface damage and metal transfer result,
metal

Some
combinations apparently resist diffusion
bonding, or welding, but such resistant combi-
nations can be determined only through tests. In
a study of the friction of metals the conclusion
has been that the magnitude of the frictional forces
and the extent and type of surface domage caused

by sliding are determined primarily by the relative
physical properties of the two sliding surfaces.!

In particular, the behavior is very dependent upon
the relative hardnesses of the sliding surfaces,
and, if the sliding speed is high, the relative
softening or melting points are quite important.
Properly designed, hydrodynamically lubricated
bearings operate with a thin layer of the lubricant
separating the two sliding surfaces, except in
cases of extreme loads or of starting and stopping
under load, when the thin film may be destroyed
or interrupted and metal-to-metal contact may
occur. The bearing then operates in what is called
a '‘boundary region’’ of lubrication, and an analy-
sis of the friction developed becomes complicated.
The phenomena invelved cannot be explained by
any presently known lubrication theory. Surface
finish and the chemical and physical properties
of the. sliding surfaces become critical in this
situation, and hardnesses, shear strengths, and
melting points of the materials are important.

TEST APPARATUS

The test apparatus, which was modified from
apparatus previously used for testing seals, con-
sisted of an Inconel sump tank, an Inconel operat-
ing pot, and a concentric spindle shaft and sliding
shaft arrangement inserted in the operating pot
and externally supported by ball bearings (Fig. 1).
The 2%4“' specimen plate was rotated in the
operating pot and was held against a ]/2-in.-dia
stationary pin specimen. The contact pressure
of the plate on the pin couid be adjusted by on
external spring. The surface of the plate speci-
men was lapped flat, to within three light bands,
and the end of the stationary pin specimen was
ground to a Y%-in.radius cylindrical surface so
that theoretical line contact between the speci-
mens could be obtained. The pin was mounted
so that contact would occur at a mean radius of
1 in. from the center of the plate. The mean slid-
ing speed (7.4 fps) used by Vail at KAPL? was
selected for use in these tests, At the specified
sliding speed of 7.4 fps, the plate rotated at
850 rpm.

The test apparatus was calibrated {tests Nos. 1
and 2) by use of acetylene tetrabromide (1.1-2,2
TEB) as the liquid, a Graphitar 14 plate, and an

A pin-wear classification guide (Fig. 2) was
prepared by taking cuts of known amounts off the
wearing nose of an unused test pin and then photo-
graphing the pin. The photographs provided a
reference to which photographs of the tested pins
could be compared to determine visually the extent
of wear,

The results were in reasonable

SELECTION OF MATERIALS

An examination of work by Vail® with sodium
and sodium-potassium alloy at temperatures up to
950°F and recommendations made by the Materials
Chemistry Section and the Ceramics Department
of ORNL were used as the basis for selecting
materials, Samples of materials that were ex-
pected to be corrosion resistant were obtained
and were exposed to the fluoride salt in static
capsule or seesaw tests? for 100 hr, The ma-
terials selected and the results of the corrosion
tests are presented in Table 1,

TEST PROCEDURE

The test specimens were cleaned with alcohol
and then slowly heated to 1200°F in a purging
stream of dry, pure helium, After the operating
pot and specimens were heated, a fluoride mixture
at 1200°F was introduced into the pot and brought
to the level-control probe. The rotation of the
submerged plate specimen was started, and the
system temperature was allowed to come to equi-
librium at 1200°F, Contact was then established
between the pin and plote specimens, with a
10-Ib contact load being applied for 120 min,
during which time the specimens remained sub-
merged in the molten fluoride salt, The load was
released, and the fluoride mixture was allowed
to drain back into the sump pot and freeze. The

system was allowed to cool to room temperature
under a helium atmosphere before the specimens
were removed for examination. Photographs were
taken of the pin and the plate after each run (see
Appendix C), and enlargements were made of the
pin-surface and plate-surface photographs to show

the wear pattern.

A Faxfilm replica was also made of each plate
and pin. The process consisted in applying a
clear solvent to the surface to be recorded, pressing
a piece of soluble plastic tope against the solvent
and surface, allowing a few seconds for reaction
and drying, and then mounting the tape in slides
for projection.

A sample of the fluoride was recovered after
each run, and a spectrographic analysis was made,
with special emphasis given to the constituents
of the compatibility specimens., There was no in-
crease of metal content, except in the case of the
oxides, which were recognized as being soluble
in the fluoride.

CRITERIA FOR RATING MATERIALS

The compatibility of pairs of materials operating
in contact with each other was established as a
relative measure of resistance to mechanical dam-
age, such as wear, galling, and self-welding. For
the purpose of classifying materials according to
test results, arbitrary group standards were estab-
lished, as follows:

Group A ~ Only slight wear on the narrow-band
pin specimen; no spalling of either specimen; no
galling or smearing tendency; no appreciable change
in surface flatness of the plate; no change in
surface finish, except an improvement (polishing
or superfinishing); no appreciable reduction in
hardness as indicated by the Rockwell hardness
tester; and no evidence of erosion or corrosion by
spectrographic or visual means.

Group B ~ Slight wear indications on either
specimen; no spalling; no smearing or metal pickup;
slight scoring and surface roughening; no appreci-
able reduction in Rockwell hardness; no evidence
of erosion or corrosion by spectrographic or visual
means.

Group C — More extensive wear than on speci-
mens of Group B; some possible roughening of
either surface or of both; some metal pickup, smear-
ing, scoring, or spalling readily apparent; no
evidence of erosion or corrosion by spectrographic
or visual means.

EVALUATION OF RESULTS

From the post-test photographs (presented in
Appendix C), a very clear indication of the com-
patibility of the test materials was obtained. Wear,
smearing, or metal buildup, galling or self-welding,
spalling, and cracking are all identifiable in the
photographs. The extent of pin wear may be ob-
served by comparison of the test photograph with
Fig. 2. The hardness readings and the spectro-
graphic analyses were effective in indicating the
compatibility of the specimens,

The test data, presented in Tables 2 and 3,
showed that, in general, pairs of unlike materials
were more compatible than pairs of like materials.
Thirty-six combinations of ten different materials
were tested, and the following were considered
suitable for further testing at higher temperature:

Kennametal 151A vs Adamas A

Adamas A vs Kennametal 138A

Kennametal 151A vs Norbide B4C
Kennametal 151A vs Carboloy 608
Kennametal 151A vs Kennametal 151A
Kennametal 151A vs High-Density Graphite

The repetition of various tests showed that the
results were reproducible and indicated that the
test apparatus and methods used were consistent
and reliable.

No single property or combination of properties,
such as surface finish, hardness, or chemical
composition, was found which was characteristic
of the best materials. It is felt that tests of ad-
ditional combinations of carbides would be produc-

tive and that tests of available borides, nitrides,
and silicides would greatly increase the chances
of finding ideal combinations of materials for the
desired applications.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

From the results obtained at 1200°F it is con-
cluded that several of the combinations of ma-
terials tested were sufficiently compatible under
the conditions imposed on them to warrant further
testing at 1350 to 1500°F, as was originally
planned (see ‘‘Materials Requirements'’). There-
fore the following recommendations are made:

1. Resume the compatibility screening tests
reported herein and test additional promising com-
binations of carbides, as well as combinations
of borides, nitrides, and silicides, which alsc
offer promise,

2. Run a series of tests on the screened com-
binations at 1350 and 1500°F, successively screen-
ing and retaining the most promising.

3. Test the material combinations which show
promise at 1500°F as journal bearings, face seals,
and valve seats in apparatus designed to simulate
operation in an actual reactor circuit.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The work of D. B, Vail of the Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory (reports KAPL-58% and - 021)
on the compatibility of materials in sodium and
in NaK was of considerable value in the initial
selection of materials to be tested. It was also
used to check and to validate the calibration of
the apparatus used.

The data presented herein were obtained by
P. G. Smith and J. W, Kingsley of ORNL and by

W. K. Stair, consultant, the University of Tennessee,
