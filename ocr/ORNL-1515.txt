ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project
at OBRNL records the technical progress of the research on the circulating-fuel
reactor and all other ANP research at the Laboratory under 1ts Contract
W-7405-eng-26. The report 1s divided into three major parts I. Reactor
Theory and Design, II. Shielding Research, and III. Materials Research. Each
part has a separate introduction and summary.

The ANP Project 1s comprised of about three hundred technical and scientific
personnel engaged i1n many phases of research directed toward the nuclear
propulsion of aircraft. (The Project organization chart 1s included as an
appendix.) A considerable portion of this research 1s performed in support of
the work of other organizations participating in the national ANP effort. How-
ever, the bulk of the ANP research at OBRNL 1s directed toward the development
of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The nucleus of the effort on circulating-fuel reactors 1s now centered upon
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment - a 3-megawatt, high-temperature prototype of
a circulating-fuel reactor for the propulsion of aircraft. This reactor
experiment 1s now being assembled, 1ts current status 1s summarized in sec. 1.
However, much supporting research on materials and problems peculiar to the
ARE will be found in other sections of Part I and Part III of this report,
along with the general design and materials research contained therein.

A survey report on a reflector-moderated type of circulating-fuel reactor

REACTOR THEORY AND DESIGN
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(sec. 1) 1s rapidly taking form as
equipment 1s received and installed
in the ARE Building. There were no
significant changes 1n design or
concept during the quarter, and the
installation 1s proceeding according
to schedule. The fuel system heat
transfer loop and the fill and flush
tanks are completely installed, and
the sodium heat transfer loop 1s
nearing completion. Installation of
fuel and sodium piping 1s now 1n
progress. The control and graphac
panels have been completely instru-
mented and checked. The formal
presentation on the hazards involved
in the ARE was made to the Reactor
Safeguards Committee earlier in the
quarter, and in view of the subsequent
discussion of the Committee members,
1t 1s not expected that any modifi-
cations of the experiment will be
required.

Valves, pumps, i1nstrumentation,
and other components of the fluoraide-
fuel and sodium-coolant systems are
being developed and tested for the
ARE (sec 2). Both centrifugal and
electromagnetic pumps of ARE capacity
have been operated, the latter will
be employed in the by-pass loop for
preliminary tests, with NaK, of the
external fuel system. Impeller designs
for the centrifugal pumps are con-
ventional, but the pump seal, particu-
larly -for fluoride fuels, remains a
problem. The packed-frozen seals on
fuel pumps have widely varying leakage
rates, and adequate temperature
control of the frozen zone has not been
obtained. Both packing and face-seal
materials are being examined 1n an
effort to find materials with the
desired service and life charac-
teristics. Gas face seals for vertical-
shaft pumps are being investigated.
Considerable success has been experi-
enced with frozen-sodium seals 1n
sodium pumps, and frozen-lead seals

are being tested for use with fluoraides.
Frozen-sodium and frozen-lead seals
have proved to be unsatisfactory for
use on NaK pumps. The ARE bellows
type of valve was tested at 1100 and
1300°F and found to be satisfactory,
although excessive leakage occurred
after operation at 1500°F. The 1initial
mockup of the ARE fluid circuait
revealed i1nstabilities and gas entrain-
ment that were eliminated by mainor
system alterations. The rotameters,
level indicators, and pressure trans-
mitters have operated satisfactorily
for long periods of time under the
conditions expected in the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment.

The reactor physics studies (sec.
3) were concerned with the statics of
the reflector-moderated reactor and
damping of power oscillations. The
applicability of the multigroup method
to the calculation of the reflector-
moderated reactor was demonstrated by
the good correlation obtained waith
critical experiments. The damping of
power oscillations 1n a reactor 1s
demonstrated for a nonlinear case,
with delayed neutrons included, by
assuming (1) constant power extraction
or (2) a special case of cooling with
circulating fuel.

The reflector-moderated reactor
and an aircraft power plant assembly
employing this reactor are described
(sec. 4). 1In general, the reactor
consists of lumped regions of fuel
and moderator or reflector. An
essent1al element in this reactor 1is
the use of a thick beryllium reflector
that not only contributes to neutron
economy but also constitutes the farst
layer of the aircraft shield. This
reactor and the compact, spherical
arrangement permit realization of
what 1s practically a unit shield for
a 200-megawatt reactor and heat
exchanger combination that weighs
about 80,000 pounds. Craitical experai-
ments on a mockup of thais reactor

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
J. H Buck, Research Director's Division, E. S Bettis, ANP Division e

The major effort in the ARE project
during the quarter has been 1n instal-
lation of equipment in Building 7503.
The arrival of the heat exchangers
permitted the i1nitiation of a large
amount of construction work that had
been postponed for several weeks
Valves began to arrive toward the end
of the quarter, and work could proceed
on the i1nstallation of the maain
plumbing system. The installation of
equipment will no longer be dependent
upon the arrival of components. The
installation work 1s not ahead of
schedule, but thus far 1t appears
that the completion goal of June 1953
will be realized

No new technical crises have arisen
1n the project. Tests of valves,
seals, pumps, etc. continue (sec. 2)
and, to date, reveal no insurmountable
difficulties. Seals have operated
satisfactorily, but their performance
has not been so good as might be
wished. The same condition exists
with respect to the valve tests, but
the valves have been shown to be
usable.

Although detailing of installation
drawings continues to be a problem,
1t has not yet actually retarded the
job. There have been the usual
modifications dictated by problems
arising 1n the field, but they have
been no more numerous or serious than
would be expected 1n a system of such
complexity as the ARE.

FLUID CIRCUIT
G. A. Craisty

Engineering and Maintenance Division

No significant design changes were
made i1n the fluid circuit. However,
since 1t appeared 1nadvisable for the
long drain lines 1n the fuel circuat
to stand full of stagnant fuel, two
valves were added to permit draining

n
these long lines so that they w¥Il
be empty during operation of the
experiment. ot

The heat disposal loops for the
fuel circuit, that 1s, the fuel-to-
helium heat exchangers, the helium-to-
water heat exchangers, the thermal
barriers, the helium ducts, and the
helium blowers, are now completely
installed. Figure 1.1 shows these
loops 1nstalled 1n the pit. Three
sections of the fuel pipe, together
with annuli, thermocouples, and
heaters (where possible), have been
prefabricated and can be welded 1nto
the system when the valves for these
lines are ready. Figure 1.2 shows one
of these sections of fuel pipe.

All the fill and flush tanks have
been put 1n the pit, and work has
been started on installing heaters on
these units. These tanks are shown
in Fig. 1.3.

The by-pass, which enables the
system to be run without the reactor
in the circuit, has been designed.
The electromagnetic pump, which wall
be i1nstalled i1n this by-pass for
circulating liquid metal, has been
tested by the Experimental Engineering
Group (sec. 2).

The surge tanks have been completed,
and tests of the mockup of the hydraulic
system are continuing (sec 2).

The helium-to-water heat exchangers
for the sodium coolant circuit have
been received and are being installed.
The li1quid metal-to-helium heat
exchangers are to be delivered the
first week of March.

REACTOR

The reactor 1s ready for operation,
except for welding of the serpentine
coils and final assembly. Figures 1 4,
1.5, and 1.6 show the "status of parts
of the reactor All preliminary work
on the pressure shell has been com-
pleted The coi1ls have been received
and sample coi1ls are now being test
welded 1n ORNL shops It 1s planned
to assemble the reactor i1nto a test
circuit at the site and to circulate
l1guid metal through the fuel coils
at design temperature so that the
reactor can be i1ndependently checked
prior to 1ts i1nstallation Thais
pretesting of the reactor core will
also serve to clean the fuel passages
with hot ligquid metal prior to 1ts
1ncorporation 1nto the system.

INSTRUMENTATION
R. G. Affel, ANP Division

The only real design modification
in the i1nstrumentation 1nvolved a
change 1n the leak detection circuit.
The change was a simplification to
minimize trouble without changing the
principle of operation of the system.
All the control room instruments have
been mounted. The graphic panel has
been 1nstalled and checked with a
dummy setup of pneumatic switches
that simulated valve operation.

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

Pneumatic lines have been run to
valves and sensing points 1n th'
pits, but a small amount (2%) of work
remains to be done. Thermocouple
designs have been completed and orders
have been placed Several of the
thermocouples needed to allow instal-
lation work to proceed have been made
by the Instrument Department All
1instruments and actuators have been
labeled The enunciator panels have
been 1nstalled and checked, except
for connection to the sensing points.

OFF-GAS SYSTEM

There has been no change 1n the
off-gas system, and installation in
the building 1s practically completed.
The final design for the shielding of
the radiation monitors has not been
completed, but this shielding will be
quite simple and will be assembled 1in
the field by using a stacking of lead
bricks around the monitors

REACTOR CONTROL

The model fission chamber for use
at high temperature has operated
satisfactorily for several hundred
hours at a temperature of 1400°F
This test has proved the acceptability
of the i1nsulator for this chamber.
The live chamber, with a U235 sleeve,
has not yet been tested.

The control room relay panel has
been completed. The wiraing of the
console and the control board instru-
ments console has progressed as far as
the i1nterconnection terminal blocks
No interconnecting cables have been
run between the amplifier cabinet,
the relay cabinet control board, and
the control actuator assembly. This
work had just started at the end of
the quarter.

The mechanism for control rod
actuation 1s being assembled 1n the
crane bay area for testing. All
parts for this assembly are complete
and on hand i1n Building 7503, but no
significant progress had been made 1n
the assembly.

2. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

H. W. Savage, ANP Division

The work of the past three months
on the liquid circuits of the ARE has
been devoted to minimizing corrosion
to values acceptable for 1000 hr of
continuous or 1ntermittent operation
at elevated temperature, determining
and applying a process of blending
fluorides for the ARE that will yield
a product with a quality equal to that
of the mixture used 1n the most satis-
factory corrosion tests, providing
pumps for the circulation of fluorides
and ei1ther sodium or sodium-potassium
alloy, developing seals for the pumps
that are reliable for 1000 hr of
operation, providing other circuit
components, and studying circuit
modifications thatwill assure accepta-
ble and operable fluid dynamics.
This work was carried out cooperatively
with the Metallurgy Division, the
Materials Chemistry Division, and the
ARE Section of the ANP Division,

Both centrifugal and electro-
magnetic pumps of ARE capacity ~ 50 to
100 gpm - have been tested. The
conventional pump i1mpellers are satis-
factory, but seals for mechanical
pumps are still a problem, A 100-gpm,
a-c, double-cell, electromagnetic pump
has proved to be entirely satisfactory
for pumping sodium-potassium alloy at

1500°F, and 1t 1s being tested for
pumping sodium,
Packings for horizontal-shaft

centrifugal pumps have not yet been
proved reliable. The most promising
packing was graphite and/or MoS,
retained with braid or graphite rings,
or possibly by magnetic means. Leakage
rates have varied widely, and friction
demands, 1n some cases, have been
excessive. Thermal control of the
frozen zone, needed for low-friction
operation and for remotely stopping
and starting the pump,
been achieved.

has not yet

O1l-lubricated, low-temperature,
face-type, gas seals have been reliably
operated for thousands of hours in
high-temperature, centrifugal, sump-
type pumps. An ARE-size sump pump,
similarly sealed, 1s undergoing a
water test, and there have been no
major difficulties, to date.

Frozen-sodium or frozen-lead seals
for NaK have proved to be impractical.
Frozen-sodium seals for ARE-s1ze sodium
pumps (2 1/2-1n.-dia shaft) are now
being tested, and the difficulties
experienced to date appear to have
been due to thermal distortions,
Frozen-lead seals have been used
satisfactorily with fluorides, and in
several tests with molten fluoride 1in
contact with molten lead, there has
been no mixing of the fluoride and the
lead. High-temperature face seals for
use with molten fluorides are being
1nvestigated,
available.

Other components that have been
operated successfully for long periods
are high-temperature rotameters and
high-temperature liquid-level 1nda-
cators (both the rotameters and the
liquid-level 1ndicators use variable-
inductance pickups for signal gener-
thin-walled (0.005 1in.)
bellows 1n pressure stransmitters in
contact with fluorides, a pneumatically-
actuated, bellows-sealed, Stellite-
seated valve, and the slip-ring and
brush arrangements for removal of the
thermocouple signals used for measuring
temperatures 1n moving parts.

A study of the parallel circuits
and the pumping and expansion tank
arrangements of the ARE has revealed
operational steps that will have to be
taken i1n the event of failure of one
of the pumps so that loss of circu-
lation from the remaining pump and
expansion tank can be prevented. The

but data are not yet

study also revealed the need for
piping modifications to eliminate gas
entrainment at the free surface 1in

the surge tanks.
Sodium-potassium alloy has been

distilled from closed systems to
simulate circuit cleaning of the ARE,
negligible quantities of alloy remained
in 1solated pockets.

Centrifugal Pump with Combination
Packed and Frozen Seal for Fluorides
A 50-gpm pump with a Stellite No. 6
coated, 2 1/2-1n.-di1a shaft was
operated for 85 hr with the ARE fuel,
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %). The
seal consisted of a packing of 1/4-by
1/4-1n. monel braid wrapped in nickel
foi1l., Operation was unsatisfactory
and the test was terminated because of
shaft seizure i1n the packing area.
Examination of the shaft after the run
showed that very severe scoring had
occurred. Some grooves were 0,049 1in.
deep.

It may be concluded from this test
that small packings alone are
adequate. Compressive loading to
minimize leakage will be high and waill
result 1n excessive wear because the
poor penetration of liquid fluoraides
will prevent their acting as a sort of
lubricant. The packing i1n subsequent
tests 1ncluded braid as a component
and either graphite or MoS,, each of
which 1s a lubricant,

The pump has been repacked waith
Dixon’s Microfyne flake-graphite
powder, which 1s retained by close-
fitting, solid; APC-graphite rings at

in-

each end of the packing gland., Initial
dry runs, without fluorides present,
showed this packing to be quite
sensitive to compressive loadaing.
Approximately 35 psi was found to be a

18

maximum packing loading for smooth,
dry operation without the seal heating
excessively. The repacked pump has
now operated at a shaft speed of 700
rpm for 300 hr at 1200°F, The pressure
against the seal has been varied from
5 to 18 psi. Leakage of solid fuel
from the seal has varied from 60 to 75
g/day during operation with pressures
in the 5~ to 10-ps1 range. Power
1input to the driving motor has been
quite smooth, with a variation from
2.6 to 3.0 kw, and under these con-
ditions only 1.5 to 1.8 kw 1s being
lost as friction in the pump seal,
Alli1s-Chalmers Centrifugal Pump for
Liquid Metals. The Allis-Chalmers
hydrostatic-bearing pump previously
reported(!) was shut down during the
quarter for alterations. A new, one-
piece shaft has been fabricated, the
bearing surface on the 1mpeller has
been hard coated with Stellite, and a
frozen-sodium gas seal has been 1n-
corporated i1n the pump. All fabri-

cation 1s complete and the pump 1is
ready for reassembly and further
testing.

Laboratory-Si1ze Pump with Gas Seal
The laboratory-size gas-sealed cen-
trifugal pump operated 996 hr waith
fluoride fuel, NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %), at a temperature of 1500°F.
The pump has thus far operated a total
of 2300 hours. The pump was run at
3600 rpm and produced a 50-ps1 head
at 8 to 10 gpm.

Figure 2.1 shows the upper assembly
of the pump after 996 hr of operation,
The ZrF, condensation does not appear
to be excessive, however, 1in the
original assembly, probe shorting was
serious and the two probes in the pump
were rendered 1noperable after 50 hr
of operation, The shorting may have
been a result of fuel freezing around
and bridging the probe and radiation
shield assembly, shown 1in Fig. 2.1,
when an i1nadvertent liquid-level surge

occurred during operation or fillaing.
This condition has been alleviated by
1increasing the clearance between the
probes and radiation baffles and in-
serting a half cylinder in the cutaway
section 1n the baffle assembly,

The pump operated quite satis-
factorily without probes, and the
li1quid level 1n the pump bowl was
established by noting the pump per-
formance and temperature of the
face plate. The reason for termi-
nation was again a broken quide vane
1n the discharge bowl. The vanes have
been rewelded tothe bowl several times,
but the latest failure occurred in the
parent metal of the vane rather than
in the weld. The reliability of this
assembly can be greatly increased by
employing thicker vanes and adding a
reinforcing ring around the top edge
of the si1x vanes,

An 1dentical pump has been in-
stalled and has operated approximately
700 hr 1n a fluoride system that in-
cludes a fluoride-to-NaK heat exchanger.
Several design changes were made to
reduce or nearly eliminate the o1l
leakage past the rotary gas seal,

It was found that when the gas
volume above the pump was vented 1nto
a si1ght glass, the discharged helium
was heavily laden with o1l vapor. It
has not been ascertained whether this
vapor 1s harmful to fluorides, but, at
least, the contamination was un-
desirable.

In the original pump, o1l was used
to cool the drilled shaft and to flood
the rotary gas seal assembly both for
cooling and for lubrication. In the
present pump, the shaft and the
stationary seal ring are water cooled
by using a closed system. The rotary
face seal can be lubricated, 1f
necessary, by adding small amounts of
o1l, as liquid or mist, through an
opening 1n the bearing housing.

The rotary, Graphitar No. 30, gas-
sealing ring was replaced with a
si1lver-impregnated graphite (Morganite
MYIF) ring, and an attempt was made to

20

run the dry seal against hardened tool
steel. However, at a bearing pressure
of approximately 60 psi, this combi-
nation would not run unlubricated. It
has been necessary to add small amounts
of 011 to reduce gas leakage and to
prevent small power excursions in the
recorded demand of the pump motor. The
seal has required an average of 6 to 8
drops of o1l per day, and the gas
leakage has been negligible.

It 1s planned to use a Keller Air
Line lubricator to atomize the lubra-
cation i1nto the seal region through
the bearing housing. This unit may be
operated remotely as frequently as
experience dictates.

ARE-S1ze Sump Pump A modification
has been made to the existing model DA
pump(z) to convert 1t to a sump pump
with a shaft labyrinth seal from which
leakage wi1ll return by gravity to the
pump’s sump tank. The modified pump
1s now being tested with water and
other room-temperature liquids, and 1t
wi1ill be tested with liquids that
simulate the density and viscosity of
the ARE fuel. Studies are being made
of the labyrinth seal during pump
operation, the effects of the pump
inlet suction bell, and the volume of
fluid and the baffling required in the
sump tank for satisfactory pump
operation,

The operation of the labyrinth seal
(0 009-1n. radial clearance) was 1in-
vestigated by measuring the leakage
of the seal at various pump speeds and
heads. As expected, the fountain
1ncreases with increase i1n pump speed
and in pump head. However, the amount
of the bypass fountain flow varied
from 2 to 10% of pump flow, which 1s a
reasonable fraction. A minor problem
was encountered in that the labyrinth
leakage splashed the surface of the
lIiquid 1in the sump tank and some of
the gas bubbles were carried deep
enough to be entrained in the fluid
entering the impeller.

Grindell, and G D
Prog Rep Sept 10, 1952
The pump has been tested 1n two
types of sump tank. The first tank
was a rectangular, plexiglas box, 14
by 16 by 30 in., in which the fluaid
1inlet to the tank was considerably
offset from the eye of the impeller,
The second tank was a plexiglas cylin-
der, about 12 in. 1n diameter and 14
in. high, in which the fluid inlet 1s
below and directly 1nto eye of the
1mpeller. When continuously submerged,
even 1f only to a small fraction of an
inch, the pump i1nlet suction bell
appeared to function satisfactorily in
elther sump tank under all conditions
of pump speed and flow.

Pump priming 1s not difficult to
accomplish 1n either tank. In the
1nitial test setup, the volume of gas
1n the system piping at startup was
approximately equal to the volume of
Ii1quid, and 1n the cylindrical tank,
the prime was broken by a sudden surge
of gas into the impeller eye. Placing
an obstruction over the fluid inlet to
divert most of the gas bubbles away
from the eye to the free surface was
sufficient to maintain the prime. 1In
a system i1n which there 1s a small gas
volume compared with the liquid volume
at startup, priming 1s accomplished by
bleeding the trapped gas into the sump
tank or by filling under vacuum. In
the ARE system, the trapped gas 1s
forced out.

Tests were made 1n which the fluid
was gassed by admitting air, helium,
or argon 1nto the eye of the suction
bell until the fluid became milky.
The time required for the fluid to
become relatively clear was then
noted, In all tests, 1including tests
with flow rates of up to 100 gpm and
tests 1n which the cylindrical tank
without baffles was used, the fluaid
degassed 1nless than 5 min of operation.
When the 1inlet of the cylandrical tank
was offset about 1/2 1n. with respect
to eye of the impeller, the entire
holdup volume of liquid in the tank
was given a rotary motion that 1in-
creased 1n velocity at high impeller

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 16, 1953
speeds and low flow rates. When the
baffles were 1n place, this circular
motion occasionally caused the for-

mation of vortexes and gas entrainment
in the liquid. Without baffles i1n the
cylindrical tank, the rotary motion
was present but no vortexes were
observed. The gas seal for this pump
will be either a frozen-sodium or
frozen-lead seal or a mechanical face

seal.
ARE Centrifugal Pump An ARE model

FP pump(3’ has been constructed and
incorporated 1n a test loop. The most
critical feature of this pump was the
frozen-sodium seal for which sodium
from an external source was fed to a
sealing annulus and frozen in rings on
each si1de of the annulus.

Three tests have been run in which
NaK was pumped for about 15 min, 4 hr,
and 1 hour., FEach test was terminated
because of excessive seal leakage.
Chemical analyses of samples of leakage
material 1ndicated the presence of
from 1 to 7.5% potassium. Since thas
pump does not operate successfully
with NaK, 1t was modified for testing
with sodium. For operation withsodium,
the external supply of sodium to the
seal wi1ll not be needed and a larger
surface wi1ll be presented for cooling
of the seal.

Prior to installation of the new
sealing gland, a series of tests was
run on the externally supplied seal
with helium in the pump loop. During
these tests, pump speeds and seal
temperatures were systematically
varied, and considerable data were
taken to provide more adequate under-
standing of the frozen-seal mechanism.
Successful operation, as a gas seal,
was obtained over the available range
of speeds, 400 to 1920 rpm, and the
temperature of the sodium in the gland
groove varied from 300 to 400°F. Speed
and pressure conditions were determined
under which the seal would fail and
under which 1t would operate reliably.

The sealing gland that has been
installed i1n the pump for operation
with sodium has a length-to-diameter
ratio of 2.3, 1n contrast to the
ratios of 0.6 and 0.2 for the 1insade
and outside glands of the previously
used externally supplied seal. Also,
the radial shaft-to-gland clearance
has been increased from 0.015 an. for
the externally supplied gland to
0.030 1n. for the longer gland. Initaial
tests of this gland and seal indicate
a satisfactory seal, but they also
1indicate the presence of excessive
thermal distortions that will result
in displacement of parts and eventual
bindaing.

stage electromagnetic pump that waill
be used to circulate NaK in testing
and cleaning operations of the fuel

with NaK at 1500°F and 1s undergoaing
similar tests with sodium. With Nak,

Mechanical Face Seals High-
temperature mechanical face seals for
liguids such as fluorides are being
1investigated, Successful operation of
such seals may be dependent upon dry-
film lubrication, boundary lubrication,
or adsorbed-film lubrication, but
research has revealed only empairical

22

knowledge about the principles of
similar seals successfully used 1n
applications much less severe than
those i1mposed by ANP requirements.
The problem appears to be one of
selecting appropriate materials that
wi1ll retain optically flat surfaces at
high temperatures and will have the
proper degree of hardness and softness
relative to each other, Graphite 1s
being considered for the soft materaial
and materials such as tungsten carbade,
titanium carbide, and cermets are
being considered for the hard materaial,
The methods of fabrication and the
maintenance of high ambient tempera-
tures and low thermal gradients to
avoid distortions are also pertinent
problems.

The work of others has shown that
a principal factor in determining wear
and surface damage 1n sliding 1s the
tendency of the sliding or rubbing
materials to alloy. Although other
factors, such as the hardnesses of the
materi1als, the melting points, the
rubbing velocity, and the temperature
of operation, are considered as being
of secondary i1mportance, 1n some
instances they may become of controllang
1importance. The use of MoS, as a high-
temperature lubricant 1s intriguing,
and considerable work has been done to
obtain surfaces coated or impregnated
with this material. Table 2 1 lasts
the attempts to establash a MoS, layer
by adding MoS, to the vehicle to make
a paste. It should be noted that MoS,
wi1ll begin to oxidize at about 700°F
1n air, but 1n the absence of oxygen
1t 1s stable to 2000°F. Tests of face
seal materials, made by rotating them
1n contact with the other specimen are
described in Table 2.2, The chattering
noted may have been due to forces
resulting from the geometry used 1n
the test apparatus. These experiments
indicate that of the materials tested,
graphite 1s best for one of the
materials, under these test conditions,
when air 1s present.

date, the seal has not been consistent,
1t has leaked at times and in varying
amounts.

Other materials have been ordered,
such as boron nitride compacts, MoS,-
impregnated copper, silver and stain-
less steel compacts, and a sintered
molybdenum compact, that will be
treated to form a MoS, surface.

Combination Packed and Frozen Seal
with MoS,. Because MoS, has high-
temperature lubricating properties,
an attempt was made to use 1t as a

high-temperature packing material for
sealing fluorides, fluoride leakage
was slight, operation was smooth, and
there were no power surges. However,
as 1n previous experiments, the MoS,
was too fluid and could not be con-
tained. The retainers used were
Graphitar No. 14 rings. The material
slowly leaked out of the stuffing box
and around the gland until the gland
was completely 1inserted,

For the next attempt to seal waith
this material, a packing of Inconel

25
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

braid impregnated with MoS, was used.
This experiment was terminated after
approximately 925 hr of operation with
fuel No. 30 at 10 psi and 1750 rpm.
Excessive leakage occurred because the
seal reached too high temperatures
when an attempt was made to restart
operation after binding had occurred.
The operation of the seal corresponded
to operation of seals 1n other tests
1in that the leakage of the seal was
apparently temperature sensitive. When
the seal was too hot or too cold,
leakage and power surges resulted, but
under certain conditions operation was
smooth and there was no detectable
leakage, There have been nointentional
start-stop tests, although the unit
has been accidentally stopped on
several occasions, and power surges
have overloaded the motor relays
several times, The unit has been
restarted with little difficulty on
each occasion by heating the packing
area and using a wrench to ‘““break’” the

shaft loose.
Combination Packed and Frozen Seal

with Graphite. Thecontinuous operation
of the graphite-packed seal, mentioned
1n the previous report, was terminated
after 725 hours. The seal had shown
no signs of failure, and after another
150 hr of periodic and stop-start
operation, the test was again termz-
nated. During the latter period of
operation, attempts were made to
control the seal temperatures and,
thereby, the zone in which freezing
was occurring, since 1t was believed
that most satisfactory operation would
occur 1f freezing took place within
the graphite region. Two fairly
stable temperature ranges of operation
were found, one set of temperatures
corresponded to that maintained during
the 725-hr period of continuous
operation and the other set was about
150°F lower.

at intermediate temperatures.

Operation was unstable
At the
lower temperatures, operation was
smooth, there was no detectable
leakage, and the unit could be stopped

26

for as long as 20 min and started
again by motor power only. The seal
used 1n this test was similar to the
seals used 1n other tests i1n that
leakage occurred when the seal was
too hot or too cold.

Graphite Packed Seal. In an attempt
to determine the benefits of holding
the transition from fluid to solad
within the graphite, a test was set up
that i1ncluded a long (4 1in.), graphite-
packed, stuffing box. In order to
obtain more complete temperature data,
four thermocouples were installed in
the rotating shaft, and signals were
taken off through slip rings. After a
dry run, fluorides were i1introduced and
the seal i1mmediately started leaking
graphite. The Graphitar rings used
as retainers did not contain the
graphite at the top of the seal.
Approximately 3/4 in. of Inconel braid
was then added, and the graphite was
successfully retained. The motor for
this test was a 5-hp unit. Operation
started off fairly normally, but the
temperatures adjacent to the seal
began to increase. Cooling of the
bearing housing and the gland was
started, but the temperatures continued
to rise. The temperatures never
became stable, they fluctuated over a
range of 940 to 2190°F throughout the
seal regiron. The hottest point was
apparently near the middle of the
packing, and the lowest temperatures
were 1n the regions of the bearings
and the fluoride. The molten fluoride
was acting as a coolant in this test.
The temperatures continued to increase
unti]l the test had to be terminated
after approximately 50 hr of operation
because the shaft .froze. The shaft
could be restarted by motor power
afterit cooled, but would not continue
to operate when higher temperatures
were reached. At no time was there
any detectable leakage, however,
severe shaft scoring occurred.

other portions of the shaft (also at
very high temperatures) showed no
markings whatsoever. The condition
of the graphite 1tself 1s of interest,
since 1t apparently packed i1n more or
less “concentric” radial layers that
varied i1n thickness along the length
of the seal. The layers adhered at
times to the shaft and rotated, and at
other times they adhered to each other
and remained stationary. The powder
was exceptionally fine and very
“greasy”, the “concentric” layers were
very slimy, and there was no visible
evidence of fluoride penetrataion.
Rotating-Shaft Seal Test. The
apparatus for the tests of the rotating-
shaft seal consists of a container
for the packing material being tested,
an upper compression gland that exerts
pressure on the packing, a lantern
gland located midway in the container,
and a shaft extending through the
assembly. The shaft rotates in a
bearing beneath the assembly and 1s
driven by a motor mounted above The
packing container 1s mounted on four
rollers and 1s restrained from turning
with the shaft by two tension springs
The torque necessary to turn the shaft
1s 1ndicated by a pointer and a
calibrated scale on the assembly
Fluorides are forced under pressure
from a fill tube into the container
through the lantern gland During
the tests, the temperature of the
midpoint of the packing container was
1500°F, the temperature of the lower
shaft opening was 1400°F, the pressure
was 20 psi. The packing materaials
tested were MoS, and powdered graphite
The MoS, packing began to leak after
1 hr of operation. The torque required
to turn the shaft at 350 rpm was
2 ft-1b. The graphite test ran for
8 hr before leakage occurred, and the
same torque was required for rotation.
There was considerable wear on the
upper packing gland. The shaft had
to be started and stopped a number of
times because of severe vibration.

Packing Penetration Tests. The
apparatus used 1n the packing pene-
tration tests and the results of
several tests were described prevai-
ously ¢*) Further tests have been
made and the results are presented in
the following

Stainless steel braid impregnated
with MoS, was compressed and heated
twice to the annealing temperature,
with further compression after each
heating This packing held the
fluorides for 1/2 hr at 2 psi, but
when the pressure was i1ncreased to
5 ps1, leakage occurred. Examination
showed that the leakage path was along
the walls of the containers, the
screw stem, and the strands of the
braid It could not be detected that
any fluoride mixed with the MoS, or
penetrated through 1t.

A second boron nitride test was
run 1n an assembly with much smaller
clearances than those used for the
previous boron nitride test. In this
test, 1t was possible to raise the
pressure to 30 psi, and operation was
continued for 234 hr before leakage
occurred,

A test with J. T. Baker Chemical
Co. powdered graphite previously
reported(?) has continued for 240 hr
with no leakage. Analysis showed
that the packing was approximately
530% amorphous carbon. Three more
graphites have been tested, and ain
all cases 1t was possible to raise
the pressure to 30 psi without leakage
occurring. The analyses and results
are given 1n Table 2.3. There should
be a minimum of amorphous carbon 1in
the graphite because 1t would be
expected to increase the friction
between a rotating shaft and the
packing, however, the graphite waith
the highest amorphous carbon content
sealed for the longest periods. That

Frozen-Sodium and Frozen-Lead Seal
for NaK. It was reported previously(%’
that tests were under way to determine
the feasibility of sealing a NaK pump
with an externally supplied frozen-
sodium or frozen-lead seal. Although
the preliminary tests were encouraging,
subsequent tests revealed that seal
life (the time before failure because
of alloying) was, 1n general, inversely
proportional to NaK temperature and
that the seals were unreliable for
periods of operation greater than
100 hours.

In the frozen sodium seal, the
sodium alloys with the NaK and forms
a low-melting-point alloy 1in the seal
that cannot be frozen with room-
temperature cooling water, as a result
the seal 1s completely lost. Re-
frigeration, with temperatures below
the melting point of eutectic Nak
(12°F), would be required to assure
seal retention.

In the frozen-lead seal, the lead
alloys with the NaK and forms a high-
melting-point alloy, as a result there
1s shaft seizure and 1t 1s impossible
to operate with reasonable power
requirements.

ARE Valve Test. Preliminary gas
and liquid leakage tests have been
run on the ARE pneumatically driven
valve supplied by Fulton-Sylphon Co.
The valve 1s constructed of Inconel
and has a Stellite-to-Stellite valve
and seat. The shaft-sealing member
1s a four-ply Inconel bellows The
valve 1s adaptable to being either
normally closed or normally opened,
and the position 1s reversed by
application of 15 psi1 of air pressure
to a large bellows actuator.

For the 1nitial test, the valve
was mounted vertically and adapted
for normally closed operation. Waith
the valve at room temperature, gas
leakage was small with test pressures
from 30 to 60 psi1 that were first
applied up against the valve seat
and then down on 1t. Raising the
valve temperature to 1050°F caused a
slight i1ncrease 1n gas leakage,
however, the leakage remained small.

Testing for liquid leaks with the
ARE fuel, NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4
mole %), at 1100°F revealed that there
was no leakage with test pressures
of 30 to 60 psi applied both above and
below the seat. This test was repeated
several times.

In a test at 1300°F, slight leakage
(0.3 an.3/hr or less) occurred at
various 1ntervals However, 1t was
concluded that the leakage at thais
temperature was not serious. The
initi1al checks at 1500°F were very
successful. Subsequent checks,

29
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

however, showed a very serious leakage
rate, 120 in.3/hr, that could not be
corrected by reseating the valve,
It was concluded therefore that the
valve might be usable for several
cycles at 1500°F but that 1t could
not be expected to hold tight 1f
cycled indefinaitely.

Difficulty at the elevated tempera-
ture was experlenced 1n that the
valve stuck when left closed for short
periods However, 1n all cases to
date, the valve has eventually become
operable by increasing the pressure
up to 30 psi1i on the valve actuator
In one instance at 1100°F and another
at 1500°F, 1t was necessary to vibrate
the valve body to get the valve open.
When the valve was cut for inspection,
1t was found that some binding of the
Stellite faces had occurred

Sodium-to-A1r Radiator Tests.
The sodium-to-air radiator tested
had a core element with 30 fins per
inch,. (®) This test ran for 200 hr
and was then terminated because of
poor heat transfer per formance. The
maximum, over-all, heat transfer
coefficients obtained were of the
order of 6 Btu/hr*ft?+°F, which 1s
far below the predicted performance
It was discovered, after i1nlet sodium
temperatures of 1500°F were reached,
that very few of the Nicrobrazed
fin-to-tube joints were good. The
radiator could be seen through the
air exhaust, and 1t was observed that
with minimum air flow less than 10%
of the nickel fins showed any heat
color. The small amounts of braze
material used to avoid closing the
0.025-1n. fin-to-fin gaps were ap-
parently insufficient to completely
join the fins and tubes. No oxide
plugging occurred i1n the radiator

tubes during this relatively short
run, and the bypass filter caircuzit
was operated without diffaiculty.

A Roots Connersville gas pump
driven by a 2-hp Varidrive has been
installed 1n place of the Buffalo
centrifugal blower so that a wider
range of air flows and better flow
regulation can be obtained.

Bi1fluid Heat Transfer Loop. The
bi1fluid heat transfer loop,‘’’ which
has been 1n operation for approximately
two months, transfers heat from fuel
No 30 to NaK. The heat transfer
takes place 1n a concentric tube
section, the center tube contains
the hot fluoride and the NaK 1s 1in
the annulus. The center tube has an
inside diameter of 0.269 1in, and an
L/D ratio of 40, whereas the annulus
has an L/D ratio of 22.

Heat transfer data on the fluoraide
fuel have been taken over a Reynold’s
number range of from 5,000 to 20,000,
which corresponds to velocities of
from 8 to 30 fps. The maximum fluoride
temperature was 1400°F, and the
temperature drop across the heat
exchanger was varied from 15 to 40°F.
The NaK-side data were taken at
Reynold’s numbers from 20,000 to
100, 000.

The over-all heat transfer coef-
ficient for heat fluxes from 300,000
to 500,000 Btu/hr*ft? has varied from
1000 to 2500 Btu/hr<ft?:°F, Satis-
factory separation of the individual
coefficients has not been accomplished
because of the necessity of evaluating
thermal entrance effects and because
of what appears to be fouling in the
exchanger. It 1s possible that
fouling occurred, because there was
flow restriction when the temperature
of the NaK entering the heat exchanger
was lowered to the fluoride melting
point (approximately 950°F).

The pump for circulating fluoraide
fuel has operated satisfactorily with

a minimum of gas leakage. This pump

level 1s controlled with a spark-

ARE FUEL CIRCUIT MOCKUP
G. D. Whitman, ANP Division

A mockup of the ARE fuel circuait
has been constructed for investigating
the hydrodynamic stability of the
design and the characteristics of the
liquid flow in the surge tanks. The
system, shown schematicallyin Fig. 2 4,
was constructed from black iron paipe,
and 1t has viewang windows 1n the
surge tanks and glass sections in the
lines leaving the surge tanks. The
surge tanks are of the size to be
used 1n the ARE, and the two 1dentacal
pumps have characteristics in the flow
range to be i1nvestigated (0 to 50 gpm)

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

that are quite similar to those of the
proposed ARE pumps. Speed variation
of the pumps 1s obtained by using
5-hp Varidrive units. The heat
exchangers are simulated by gate
valves, and the reactor can be simulated
by a Globe valve or by the glass model
that was previously described.

Thus far, water and a water -
glycerine solution have been used ain
the system. The results are therefore
based on observations made with water
of approximately one-third the density
and one-tenth the viscosity of the
fuel and with the glycerine-water
solution of approximately one-thard
the density of the fuel and the same
viscosity. Tests have begun with
1-1,2-2,bromoethane, for which the
room- temperature density and viscosity
are nearly the same as those of
fuel No. 30 at 1400°F.

surge tank circuits - one for moderator
coolant and the other for fuel. Each
circuit includes two parallel circuits,
each of which includes, 1n series,
a pairofheat exchangers (inparallel),
a pump, and a surge tank. As designed,
each surge tank was to receive and
deliver the entire flow of 1ts par-
ticular pump. However, the surge
tanks of the moderator coolant circuits
have now been provided with bypasses
to reduce the flow through them to
low levels and thereby reduce gas-
entraining turbulence to acceptable
values. The moderator coolant flow
rate 1s, 1n general, several times
higher than the fuel flow rate.
However, in the fuel circuit there
are strong 1ncentives to retain
complete flow control of all fuel,
1inasmuch as the system will be filled
initially with nonuranium-bearaing
salts and wi1ll have U?35_bearing salts
added to 1t until criticality 1s
reached. Once addition starts, no
&alt can be removed or drained, and
complete and uniform mixing must occur.
Consequently, the expansion or surge
tanks must provide sufficient capacity
to receive the enriched fuel (about
15% of the system volume) and also to
provide for fuel thermal expansion
from 1000 to 1500°F (about 10% of
system volume). The thermal expansion
w1ll be about 200°F more than that
anticipated. There 1s also a strong
incentive for minimum volume holdup of
enriched fuel in each surge tank.

Vortexes and Bubbles. The system
was operated i1nitially with water,
and the surge tanks were 1nvestigated
for vortexing above the discharge
lines. The surge tanks had no baffles,
and entrained gas was observed in the
discharges at all flow rates above 10
gpm with the tanks half full of liquid.
This gas entrainment was due to vortex-
1ing of the liquid leaving the tanks.
At lower liquid levels, vortexing
occurred at flow rates of less than
10 gpm.

Many geometries were tried for
breaking up this vortexing, and a

32

baffle design was finally developed
that allowed water flow rates of up to
40 gpm to be put through the tanks
without visible gas entrainment 1f a
minimum level of approximately 4 in.
was malntained i1n the 10-1in.-di1a tanks.

This antivortexing baffle consists
of a flat plate, 6 by 8 1n., attached
to the bottom of the probe well that
1s centered over the discharge laine.
The probe well was cut off so that the
plate could be located 2 i1n. from the
bottom of the tank. There are three
vertical fins attached to the plate,
one 1n the center and one near each
edge, so that they are approximately
1/8 1n. from the bottom of the cy-
lindrical tank. This device serves to
guide the flow from the inlet to the
outlet with less velocity loss than in
the open tank, and the flow 1s re-
strained from going 1n on the sides
and edge near the end of the tank where
the more severe vortexing always
occurred.

When the glycerine solution was
tried, there appeared to be less
tendency to entrain gaé 1n the surge
tanks. At rated flow, 40 gpm, lower
fluid levels could be maintained 1in
the surge tanks without there being
visible gas entrainment 1in the dis-
charge.

It had been felt that Froude'’s
modulus should be applicable, since
the fluid mockup and the ARE fuel
circuits were similar, and that
gravity forces should predominate on
the free surfaces in the tanks. Since
the mockup surge tanks are full ARE
si1ze, the ARE fuel flow rates were
malintalned with the water and the
glycerine-water solution for this in-
vestigation i1n order to maintain
hydraulic similarity,

The moderator circuit in the ARE 1s
quite similar 1n design to the fuel
circuit. The Na or NaK flow (about
100 gpm) cannot be put through a surge
tank of ARE dimensions without there
being very severe gas entrainment 1in
the discharge. This condition can be
remedied by bypassing most of the flow
around the tanks or by using the tanks
as stand pipes only. The first remedy
would be the more desirable, since gas
removal would be more effective,

It was found that the surge tanks
removed visible gas bubbles in the
water and glycerine-water solution.
Air bubbles of the order of 1/8 in. 1n
diameter and larger were removed 1in a
very few cycles, and those so small as
to be barely visible were removed after
an hour or so of circulation at low or
rated flows., When the glycerine-water
solution was first transferred to the
loop, 1t was nearly opaque because of
the finely divided gas bubbles, but
the solution was clear after circu-
lation through the surge tanks for
approximately 1 hour. The system
tested for gas removal had a capacity
of 15 gallons.

Operational Instabilities The
system has also been i1nvestigated with
respect topump failures and operational
instabilities. During operation with
each pump delivering 30 to 40 gpm at
approximately 45 psi head, 1f one pump
1s shut down the remaining pump 1im-
mediately becomes gas bound, starts
pumping 1intermittently, and severely
gasses the loop. The gassing of the
pump that remains operable results
from the transfer of liquid from the
surge tank 1n the operating loop to
the surge tank in the loop that was
shut down, that 1s, when one pump 1s
shut off, 1ts associated surge tank,
which 1s essentially at pump suction
pressure, 1s subjected to the dais-
charge pressure of the operating pump
and therefore gas volume 1s compressed
and causes transfer of liquid from the
operating loop to the loop that was
shut down.

When a pump operating at or near
rated flows stops, eirther the loop
must be i1mmediately 1solated from the
system or the remaining pump stopped.
The loop containing the 1noperable
pump must be valved out of the system
before flow 1s restarted. Also, at
relatively high flow or pressure rise

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

across the pumps, impeller speeds must
be the same for both pumps, or excessive
amounts of liquid will be transferred
from one surge tank to the other,

In an attempt tomaintain equilabrium
between the two tanks 1n case of a
pump failure, they were connected by a
liquid line. It was never possible to
operate satisfactorily with this line
open because one pump would develop a
slightly greater head and take over
the entire load and thus 1induce back
flow through the other pump. At such
times, there was heavy flow from one
tank to the other through the liquad
line connecting the two surge tanks.
Flow through the heat exchanger cair-
cuits would not drop off apprecaiably.
The pump carrying the load could easily
supply both heat exchangers and a
small back flow through the other pump.

The head flow characteristics of
the pumps are shown in Fig. 2.5, It
will be noted that between shut-off
and 50 gpm there 1s little or no drop
1in head, and at some speeds a very
slight pulsation point can be detected.
These flat curves explain the abilaity
of one pump to handle the total flow
of the reactor and heat exchanger, as
previously mentioned. One pump run-
ning at a slightly higher speed can
easily buck the other pumps and handle
the total loop load without losang
sufficient head to fall below the
shut-off head of the other pump.

During operation below 25 gpm per
pump, oscillations have been observed
1n the flow. These have never been
serious and could always be reduced to
negligible amplitude by increasing the
flow rate of the system. The oscil-
lations are evidenced by an 1ncrease
1in flow rate and liquid loss 1n one
pump circuit and a simultaneous de-
crease 1n flow rate and liquid gaain
1n the other circuit. The condition
then reverses and the period of the
oscillation 1s approximately 2 seconds.
The maximum change in flow rate has
been t2 5 gpm at flow rates of 20 gpm
per pump. Thas disturbance can be

Head Flow Characteristics of Pumps.
explained by the pump characteristics
and the absence of check valves in the
discharge lines of the parallel pump
arrangement.

In this particular system, when one
pump takes the entire load, there 1s a
subsequent pressure rise i1n the surge
tank of the stalled pump. This 1s
then seen as an increase 1in discharge
pressure of the stalled pump, whach
then overpowers the pump handling the
load and momentarily reverses the
situation,

The actual reversal of flow occurs
only 1n the line connecting the surge
tanks through the pumps, that 1s, the
suction lines and the common dis-
charge line., The flow through the
heat exchangers 1s unsteady but does
not reverse or stop. The flow through
the reactor appears tobe quite steady,
even though 1t 1s being supplied by
alternate pumps.

An Esterline Angus recording watt-
meter was 1nstalled on one pump motor,
and 1t was established that durang
these oscillations the pump alternately
carried full load and shut-off head
demand. This condition can be ef-
fectively corrected by 1nserting a
resistance 1n the common pump dis-
charge line sothat stable pump charac-
teristics are obtained. A 2-psi 1n-
crease 1n pressure 1s sufficient to
result 1n a discharge curve which
shows that the head decreases with
flow from shut-off to maximum flow.
This was demonstrated by partly closing
one of the throttle valves 1n the
pump discharge line during an oscail-
lation, the disturbance immediately
stopped.

The system 1s now being tested waith
tetrabromoethane, which has physical
properties nearly the same as those of
the fluorade fuel (viscosity, 9.27 cps,
specific gravity, 2,95 at T7°F). The
mockup wi1ll again be used to check gas
removal and vortexing in the surge tanks,
filling and draining the reactor, pump
characteristics and flow i1nstabilitaies.

Pressure Measurement Two tests of
Moore Nullmatic pressure transmitters,
operating with the 0.005-12n. wall
bellows completely submerged in the
ARE fuel, NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole %),
at 1100°F, have logged enough operating
time to make 1t seem likely that thais
method of pressure measurement 1s the
most advantageous ofany tried to date.
The transmitters are ‘“upside down’' in
the sense that the cavity containang
the bellows and the liquid under
pressure 1s open at the top. A nickel
transmitter has been cycled every 1/2
hr between 10 and 30 psi1 for 1900 hours.
A type 316 stainless steel transmitter
has operated similarly for 1500 hours.
A third transmitter of type 316 stain-
less steel filled with lead and topped
with a layer of the molten fuel has
1500 hr of operating time, to date,
and 1s running slightly cooler than
the others. The initial zero shift ain
each case was approximately 1% of full
scale at the operating temperature,
and dri1ft over the 1500-hr period was
approximately 2%. However, the zero
position can be adjusted easaily, af
necessary.

Several other Moore transmitters
have been installed i1n dynamic loops
for circulating fluorides or liquad
metals. These transmitters operate
“right side up,’’ and there 1s trapped
helium around the bellows to protect
them from the liquid. This method of
protecting the bellows, although
operable 1n most cases, does not seem
as satisfactory as complete submersion.
The ARE fuel 1in the nickel transmitter
mentioned above has been rapidly
frozen and then rapidly remelted three
times, with no apparent damage to the
1nstrument. This 1s not possible with
the trapped-gas instrument because of
fouling of the bellows. It was also

35
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

found that when the pressure transmitter
1s filled with static fuel, the bellows
temperature can be maintained at 1100°F
or below. Operation of the bellows at
the reduced temperature reduces the
corrosion rate.

Failure of the bellows i1n one of
the type 316 stainless steel trans-
mitters after 500 hr of operation at
1200°F was apparently caused by oxi-
dation, Helaium instead of air 1s now
used as the continuous-flow-balancing
gas 1n the pressure transmitter tests,

ARE Leak Detection Indicator Tests
There 1s i1nterest in developing a
secondary method for detecting leaks
in NaK or fuel systems ain the ARE to
supplement the halogen leak detector.
Experimentation revealed that a so-
lution of phenol red can be made very
sensitive to changes in pH by adjust-
1ng the solution to a reddish brown.
When helium 1s passed over a surface
of hot fuel and then over the surface
of the i1ndicator solution, the solution
changes color. Likewise, 1t was found
that a cold lump of the fuel dropped
into the indicator solution changed
the i1ndicator toward the acid direction,

Slip Rings for Temperature Measure-
ment Three tests of slip raings for
measuring the temperature i1nside a
rotating shaft were started. Because
s1lver-graphite brushes were notavail-
able, carbon brushes were used. One
test was completed i1n which copper
rings and carbon brushes were used.
When the brushes were well run-in, an
accuracy 1n the temperature measure-
ments of +1°F at 1200°F was obtained.
The combination of carbon brushes and
carbon rings 1s satisfactory 1f a
wiping brush 1s mounted on the raing.
If the ring 1s not kept clean, the
resistance across the contact increases
with time, and the error may increase
to t40°F or more.

A second combination of materials,
coin silver and silver-impregnated
graphite, was placed 1n operation
before being tested, and performance
has been satisfactory for several

36

hundred hours. In a third test that
1s being conducted with type 316
stainless steel rings and carbon
brushes, an error of +20°F has de-
veloped, but 1t 1s a constant error.
The carbon brushes will be replaced
with si1lver-impregnated graphite
brushes, which should reduce the error
slightly. Commerical slip ring as-
semblies have been ordered that waill
work on either a 7/8- or a 2 1/4-1n.

Rotameter Type of Flowmeter. Testing

has continued on the rotameter type of
flowmeter reported previously, (%) and
approximately 1000 hr of operation has
been logged 1n the temperature range
of 1100 to 1300°F. This 1instrument
will measure flows of fuel No, 30 with
10% accuracy over the range of 9 to
60 gpm. Two instruments of this type
have been tested, and the results
1indicate that this instrument will be
reliable for ARE operation.

HANDLING OF FLUORIDES AND LIQUID METALS

Distillation of NaK. NaK has been
chosen as the precleaning fluid for
the ARE before introduction of fluoride
salts. Since only a small fraction of
NaK (less than 0.5 wt %, cf., sec. 9)
can be tolerated in the fuel without
reduction of UF, to UF3, studies have
been made to determine how much NakK
remains after the system 1s drained
and how effective distillation 1s 1n
removing 1t. Since the vapor pressure
of potassium at any temperature 1s
higher than that of sodium, upon
distillation the alloy undergoes rapad
depletion of potassium, and there 1s a
corresponding enrichment of sodium,
Therefore each distillation 1s pro-
gressively more difficult, The boiling
point of sodium 1s 1621°F at 1 atm,
hence, vacuum distillation 1s used to
avoid excessive temperatures. An

absolute pressure of 100 mm Hg, which
corresponds to asodium boiling temper-
ature of 1285°F, was selected for the
distillation. After some 1nitial
difficulty with gas leaks, several 5-1b
batches of NaK were daistilled, and the
following observations were made
1. There was no difficulty an
completely distilling the Nak.

2. Most of the distillation occurred
in one surge 1n each of the four runs,
and a part of the condenser was heated
to almost the distilling pot tempera-
ture.

3. The adjustable probe (a probe
wired through a stuffing box of
s1licone-rubber “washers’'’) worked
excellently, and gave reproducible
level readings that checked to within
1/32 in. or closer.

NaK has been distilled from ARE
pump loop, but because of excessive
oxidation of the type 316 stainless
steel 1n the loop, a sufficiently low
pressure could not be maintained on

the system for a good test of the
efficiency of the distillation process
to be obtained. Pockets of NaK re-
mained 1n some of the traps, par-
ticularly the pump. In the Inconel
ARE system, such corrosion should not
be encountered, hence, essentially
complete removal of NaK by distillation
should be effected.

Flame Tests for NaK Vapor 1n Helium
(D. R. Ward, ANP Division). Tests
are being conducted to determine the
reliabality of flame tests for detect-
1ng the presence of NaK 1n helium. One
method used was to introduce helium,
from the system from which NaK was
being removed by the distallation
process, i1nto an otherwise colorless
hydrogen flame, the brightness of the
resulting flame was then measured by a
phototube circuit. The results of six
tests indicate that this method may be
used to determine the degree of
cleanliness of a system from which Nak
has been removed by the distillation
method.

3. REACTOR PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen,

From the standpoint of the physics
of nuclear reactors, the main event
during the past quarter was the
correlation between the IBM multaigroup
calculations and the critical experi-
ment on a fairly realistic, reflector-
moderated, reactor mockup. Because
of the approximations i1nvolved 1in the
calculations, 1t previously had not
been clear how close this correlation
would be. That the experimental
critical mass turned out to be only
slightly higher than the computed
value and was well within the limits
acceptable with respect to uranium
investment and fuel chemistry, consti-
tutes a milestone 1n the development
of this type of reactor. Furthermore,
there was, except at the boundaries,
good correlation between the computed
and the measured flux Thais applies
to the flux distribution in space and
in energy, but the only experimental
indications of the energy distribution
are the thermal value and the cadmium
ratio, which are effectively only two
points on the energy distribution

curve. Some significant discrepancies
exi1st at the boundaries, but the
simple diffusion theory employed in
the calculations obviously cannot be
expected to hold at the i1nterfaces
between widely different materials.
The nuclear studies pertinent to the
reflector-moderated reactor are
included 1n sec 4, ‘“Reflector-
Moderated Circulating-Fuel Reactor.”

As to reactor kinetics, 1t was
shown that the delayed neutrons
introduce damping of reactor power
oscillations, even 1n the case of
large initial amplitudes, and, further-
more, one typical example indicates
that this damping does not interfere
destructively with the damping caused
by fuel circulation. Also, the damping
can be demonstrated i1n a typical case
in which the power and flux vary along
the path of a circulating fuel. The
techniques employed are very similar
to those reported i1n the previous
ANP quarterly reports and are therefore
not repeated here.

A. P, Fraas, ANP Division

Homogeneous reactors are the most
simple nuclear reactors with respect
to 1nternal structure because there
are no structural elements 1n the
reactor core. Although the con-
s1derable experience achieved with
liquid fluoride fuels i1ndicates that
they do not lend themselves to the
design of small, homogeneous reactors
because of their poor moderataing
properties, 1t has been shown that, by
using thick and efficient reflectors,
1t 1s possible to design a small,
fluoride-fuel reactor that will be
relatively free of structural com-
plexities. Further, the combination
of such a reactor with a spherical-
shell heat exchanger would provide a
reactor, heat exchanger, and shield
package that would be much smaller and
lighter than any reactor now being
considered for the nuclear propulsion
of aircraft,

This section summarizes the work
recently carried out on this type of
power plant. The first part covers
the work done on the static physics of
the reactor, including the effect on
the reactor of core size and the use
of various materials 1n the core and
reflector, The second part presents
the results of the critical experi-
ments and correlates them with the
multigroup calculations. The thaird
part covers the mechanical design
envisioned and the developmental work
1nitiated to provide a basis for the
detalled design of a full-scale reactor.
The fourth part covers the shielding
work todate, and the last part presents
some possible full-scale aircraft
power plant arrangements, including
engines and radiators.

STATIC PHYSICS
C. B. Mills, ANP Division

The most simple reflected reactor
1s a small sphere of fissionable ma-
terial surrounded by a concentrac
sphere of moderating material. The
fast neutrons leave the fuel-bearing
region easily and diffuse 1nto the
reflector. If the reflector 1s
relatively thick and does not capture
the essentially thermalized neutrons,
the chain reaction can be supported
because of the sufficiently great
probability that the low-energy
neutrons will diffuse back i1nto the
central fuel-bearing region. The
fission cross section,as well as the
other cross sections 1n the fuel
region, 1s so high that the slow
neutrons re-entering the reactor cannot
easily re-escape.

This reactor has been briefly
evaluated with respect to moderator,
fuel, and geometry effects to obtain a
qualitative understanding of neutron
diffusion and loss. The analysis
involved the use of the ORNL-ANP
multigroup method, (') supported by
critical experiments.

Neutron diffusion 1n a reflector-
moderator can be most easily described
by referring to the results of the
first multigroup calculation for a
32-1n.-dia fuel region surrounded by a
12-1n,-thick beryllium oxide reflector.
Figure 4.1 shows the leakage spectrum
as a function of lethargy for neutron
leakage from the central fuel-bearing
region i1nto the reflector. The net
current 1s very high across the boundary
for high-energy (low-lethargy) neutrons.
Most of the fission neutrons move
immediately into the reflector, where
they are moderated to thermal energy.

A small amount of U238 added to the
fuel or placed 1n the structure near
the fuel, would compensate for a
positive temperature coefficient, be-
cause with U238 3t 1s the absorption
that 1s self-shielded, and the decrease
in the self-shielding with increasing
temperature wouldreduce the reactivity,

Very low absorption and very good
moderation must be obtained in the
reflector. Structural material at the
core-reflector interface should also
have a low absorption cross section,
although the importance of the cross
section at the i1nterface 1s reduced by
the small probability of several
thermal-neutron transits because of

44

the high absorption and low albedo of
the fuel region. The structural ma-
terial in the fuel-bearing region will
compete with the uranium for thermal
neutrons,

Reactors with Various Reflector-
Moderators Computations have been
made for a number of possible reactor

compositions, and the results are
summarized i1n the following

are believed to be valid for a varaiety
of reflector-moderated reactors.

1. The ratio of the peak-to-average
power density can be decreased by re-
pllacing the central volume of the fuel
with a moderator, The ratio of the
peak-to-average power can be reduced
to about 1.3, and the critical mass
can be reduced to about 1/2 the corres-
ponding value for a comparable reactor
without a center island.

4, The substitution of 6 or 8 in.
of carbon for beryllium 1n the re-
flector increases the critical mass by
15 and 25%, respectively,

5. Most of the structural materials
that might be used between the fuel
and moderator have a high absorption
cross section, and therefore some of
the thermal neutrons coming from the
reflector are absorbed. The loss of
all the thermal neutrons would increase
the critical mass by a factor of at
least 10, A 1/4-in.-thick layer of
Inconel might result in a reactaivity
loss of as much as 0.24, which implies
an 1ncrease 1n Crltlcal mass Of the
order of 100%.

6. A negative component of the
temperature coefficient of reactaivity
1s obtained from the thermal expansion
of the fuel, for two reasons (1) the
loss of scattering centers for fast
neutrons and (2) the loss of fuel from
the active volume. If an expansion
coefficient for the fuel of 2x10°*/°F
1s assumed, the temperature coef-
ficients resulting from these two
effects are, respectively, 0.2 X
10°*/°F and 0.4 x 10°*/°F, a total of
0.6 X 10"*/°F, The first of these
reactivity coefficients 1s smaller for
some other reactors (for example, the

7. The mean lifetime of the prompt
neutrons 1s about 4 X 10°* sec for the
beryllium-reflected reactor with a
center 1sland. About 1/2% of the
prompt neutrons has a mean lifetime of
the order of 10°? sec because of the
low absorption and leakage probability
1n the reflector.

8. A cooling system must be pro-
vided for the moderator because of
gamma and neutron heating, about 4% of
the total power appears in the moderator
volume. Insertion of such a system
means an i1ncreased amount of structure
1n the reflector, which, an turn,
causes a loss 1n reactivity and a gain
1n gamma-ray intensity., This problem
1s being studied.

9, One aspect of importance from
the shielding standpoint 1s the energy
spectrum of the neutrons escaping from
both the surface of the thick reflector
and through the fuel-circulation
passages at the reactor ends. Thas
spectrum 1s strongly thermal for the
reflectors of interest. The addition
of 1 1n. of boron carbide at the
reflector boundary reduces the total
leakage through the sides of the
reactor to the values listed in Table
4.1 as “escape of fast neutrons.” The
use of a nonpoisoning, heavy materaal
(lead or bismuth) as the reflector
coolant may be beneficial from the
shielding standpoint because 1t should
moderate fast neutrons by 1nelastic
scattering and also serve as gamma
shielding. The fast leakage through
the fuel passages and from fissioning
1n these passages must be minimized by
suppression of fission and by the
addition of extra shielding materaial,
This problem 1s not easily adaptable
to calculation, and hence critical
experiments will be performed to
evaluate leakage control methods.

10. A feasible reflector-moderated
reactor can be built by replacing the
circulating-fuel coolant (for example,

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 190, 1953

NaF-UF,) withuranium-bearing stainless
steel fuel plates and sodium coolant.
A design 1ncorporating this feature
has been proposed by A. S. Thompson.
Shim control for such a reactor can be
accomplished by varying the concen-
tration of potassium 1n the sodium
coolant, By this means, the relative
burnup could be made very large.
These results imply that the goal of a
simple, structureless core 1s 1im-
practical because the fuel solvent 1s
1nadequate as a moderator. An 1island
of solid moderator in the center of
the core seems to be desirable, and
the usefulness of such an 1sland 1s
not entirely nuclear. As will be shown

later, the hydrodynamics of a re-
flector-moderated reactor are also
aided by a central 1sland.

Summary Tables and Graphs. The

multiplication constants of two- and
three-region reflector-moderated
reactors as a function of uranium
weight in the fuel region for several
core and 1sland sizes and moderator
compositions are given 1in Fig. 4.13.
The various reactors referred taq 1n
this figure are described in Table
4,1. The figure summarizes a number
of point values for reactivity. To
facilitate the extrapolation, the
curves drawn through point values
indicate the manner in which the
multiplication constant varies with
urantum weight for the partaicular
reactor to which the point value
refers. If only two-region reactors
are considered, the shapes of the
curves vary systematically with the
position of the point value 1n the
uranium weight vs. keff plane, Hence,
only a few of the curves were actually
computed, and the others were drawn by
analogy. Likewise, a few keff Vs,
uranium weight curves can be computed
for three-region reactors and then
similar curves can be drawn through
the point values. The shapes of the
curves for three-region reactors are,
of course, different from those for

The curves described above are not
expected to be exact. It should be
noted that the IBM multigroup method
starts with an assumed power distra-
bution, and, 1fthe calculation results
1n a power distribution different from
the assumed one, an 1teration must be
made by using the computed distrai-
bution as a start, Such 1terations
were carried out only where essential.
Whenever possible, fuel-coolant con-
stituents were held constant to
emphasize the effects of main interest.
It 1s to be noted that any fuel self-
shielding or poisoning effect, or any
change 1n reactor size, 1s reflected
by a rapid change 1n reactivity and a

52

rapid change i1n the slope of the curves
of keff vs. U235 pass,

Typical results of the multigroup
solution of the neutron diffusion
processes are given in Figs. 4,14 to

case — a reactor with a small (8-in.-

First Critical Assembly. A pre-
liminary craitical assembly of the
reflector-moderated circulating-fuel
reactor was described previously. (%)
Some i1nformation already reported 1is

repeated here to givea unified picture
of the first reflector-moderated
reactor critical experiment, The
fuel consisted of 0.020-1n.-thaick
pieces of U?35 petal lumped between
l-in. layers of sodium canned 1n
stainless steel. This arrangement
was shown to be 1nefficient 1in neutron
utilization because of the self-
shielding in the thick uranium layers.
The self-shielding of the fuel was
measured experimentally by replacing
one of the 20-mi1l fuel disks with
10 disks that were each 2 mils thaick
with aluminum catcher foils between
them. The activaity of the catcher
foi1ls showed that the 20-mi1l layers

were 66% effective, the corresponding
theoretical estimate was 63%.

The critical mass was found experi-
mentally to be 15 kg of U?35, With
this loading, amultiplication constant
of 1.03 was calculated by the multai-
group method. The usual self-shielding
correction for the lumped fuel was
used. The calculation was carraied
out for a spherical shape, whereas
the actual geometry was rectangular.
This difference was accounted for by
reducing the fuel volume for calcu-
lation purposes by 10%. The computation
did not include any poisoning effect
of i1mpurities i1n the materials.

The neutron-flux traverses measured
radially through the mid-plane of the
reactor were given previously.(3)
The activations of bare- and cadmium-
covered-i1ndium foils and their differ-
ences were shown. These results are
typical of those obtained along other
traverses, and they confirm the
prediction of high neutron flux in
the moderator 1sland and reflector.
This effect 1s, as expected, particu-
larly pronounced for thermal neutrons.

neutrons, was given previously.(*)
The values of this cadmium fraction,
as calculated from the IBM multigroup
computations, were also plotted.
Theoretical and experimental values
practically coincide i1n the center of
the fuel and in the bulk of the
reflector. The discrepancy at the
fuel surface 1s not surprising, since
all practical calculation methods,
including the “age” multigroup method,
are not exact near boundaries,

The fissioningdistribution through-
out the fuel region 1s shown 1in
Fig. 4.18. The experimental values
are catcher-foi1l measurements. Since
the measurements were not normalized,

there 1s no significance in the close
agreement of the absolute values of
the theoretical and experimental
curves. However, the agreement 1in
the peak-to-average ratios of power
density does seem significant, The
discrepancy 1in the shape of the curves
inside the fuel layer can be attributed
to the fact that there 1s more moderator
in the rectangular center i1sland than
was assumed in the computation based
on spherical geometry.

To determine the reactivity loss
expected from structural material at
the core-reflector 1nterface, an
experiment was performed (Fig. 4.19)
with one-half of one of the four
outside surfaces of the core covered
with 1/4-1n. stainless steel plates.
The loss 1n reactivity was 220 cents,
which 1s consistent with the theoretical

more closely resemble those of a
possible full-scale reactor was
constructed. In this second assembly,
the fuel was a mixture of 66 wt% ZrO,,
24 wt % NaF and 10 wt % C (the Zr0,-C
combination simulates ZrF,), with
sufficient enriched UF, added to
make the U?35 density 0.2 g/cm3. The

central beryllium core and were, 1in
turn, surrounded by the beryllium and
graphite reflector These regions
may be seen in Fig. 4.20, which shows
the loading 1n a plane through the
ax1s of the reactor. The maximum
cross section of the beryllium 1sland
was 9 by 9 in., and the maximum
thickness of the fuel region was
4 1/2 inches. (With materials availa-
ble, 1t was not possible to completely
fill the fuel region at all axial
locations.) The thickness in the
fuel region was decreased i1n both
directions from the center to simulate
the 1nlet and outlet ducts of the
full-scale reactor. Figure 4.21 1s a

DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS
A, P. Fraas, ANP Divaision

Although the many complex and
interrelated considerations underlyaing

Measured Power Distribution Parallel to Ax1s of Second Critical

the design of the full-scale reactor
shown 1n Fig. 4.25 should logically
precede a detailed description, an
exposition of these considerations
will be greatly samplified by early
reference to a fairly specific system.
Therefore, this section begins with a
description of the reflector-moderated
reactor design and subsequently takes
up the more significant of the many
factors that have entered 1nto that
design.

Much work remains to be done on
reflector-moderated reactors to give
better bases for detailed designs,
but the construction i1ndicated by
Fig. 4.25seems to be the most promising
one considered, to date, for an
aircraft power plant. This cross
section through the reactor core,
moderator, and heat exchanger shows a
series of four concentric shells,
each of which 1sa surface of revolutzion,.

Thé Twd® inner shells surround the fuel
region at the center, that 1s, the
core of the reactor, and separate 1t
from the beryllium 1sland at the
center and from the outer beryllium
reflector. The fuel cairculates
downward through this region in which
the fissioning takes place and then
downward and outward to the entrance
of the spherical shell heat exchanger
that lies between the moderator outer
shell and the main pressure shell.
The fuel flows upward between the
tubes 1n the heat exchanger into two
mixed flow pumps at the top. From
the pumps, 1t 1s discharged inward to
the top of the annular passage leading
back to the reactor core. The total
fuel volume 1n the system for thais
design would be approximately 7 ft?3,
of which approximately 1 1/3 ft3 would
be 1n the reactor core. Most of the
remaining fuel would be i1n the 1n-
terstices between the tubes 1n the
heat exchanger. The moderator was
designed to be cooled by sodium
flowing downward through the annular
space between the beryllium and the
enclosing shells and back upward
through passages i1n the beryllium.
Two centrifugal pumps at the top
circulate the sodium first through
the moderator and then through the
small toroidal sodium-to-NaK heat
exchangers around the outer peraiphery
of the pump and expansion tank region.
A horizontal section through the
pump and expansion tank region 1s
shown 1n Fig. 4.26. Note that sump
pumps with gas seals are used. A
pump of this type recently completed
1000 hr of very successful operation
1in a fluoride system, with pump inlet
temperatures of about 1400°F,

The praimary construction material
1s Inconel because 1t seems to be the
material that 1s most resistant to
fluoride corrosion., Beryllium was
chosen as the moderator material,
partly because 1t seemed to be the
best material obtainable, from both
shielding and critical mass stand-
points, and partly because 1ts physical

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

properties seem to be superior to
those of any other material that maght
be used in that location, other than
graphite., It was decided that the
vase-shaped 1sland i1n the center
should be used, partly because 1t
reduced the critical mass and improved
the power distribution 1n the fuel
region, and partly because hydro-
dynamically 1t promised to give the
simplest and most desirable fuel
passage The 12-in.-thick beryllium
reflector followed by 1 in. of boron
carbide was chosen originally to
keep the neutrons escaping to the
heat exchanger region to a level
approximately equal to that of the
delayed-neutron flux from the circu-
lating fuel i1n that region. It has
since proved to be nearly an optimum
configuration from both cratical mass
and shielding standpoints.

The spherical shell heat exchanger,
which makes possible the compact
layout of the reactor-heat exchanger
assembly, 1s based on the use of tube
bundles curved i1n such a way that the
tube spacing 1s uniform, irrespective
of latitude.®3) The i1ndividual tube
bundles terminate in headers that
resemble shower heads before the
tubes are welded i1n place. Thas
arrangement facilitates assembly
because a large number of small
tube-to-header assemblies 1s made
leaktight much more easily than one
large unit., Furthermore, these tube
bundles give a rugged flexible con-
struction that resembles steel cable
and 1s admirably adapted to service
in which large amounts of differential
thermal expansion must be expected.
This basic tube bundle and spacer
construction was used 1n a small
NaK-to-NaKheat exchanger that operated
satisfactorily for 3000 hr with a Nak
inlet temperature of 1500°F.(%) Two

Factors Affecting Core Diameter,
The first factor considered 1n es-
tablishing the reactor core diameter
(the fuel region) was the effect of
diameter on critical mass. Although
much work remains to be done to
establish the core diameter, 1t
appears, at this time, that the critical
mass 1s essentially independent of
the core diameter. A more important
factor affecting critical mass 1s the

presence and size of the i1sland. It
appears that the use of a beryllium
1sland with a diameter one-half that
of the fuel region cuts the critical
mass approximately in half. At the
same time, the 1sland reduces the
ratio of the peak-to-average power
density by a factor of about 1.5,
Further work on the effects of 1sland
s1ze and fuel region thickness 1s
under way.

A careful scrutiny of the data
that have been obtained on the melting
point, viscosity, and thermal conduc-
tivity of various fluoride melts
indicates that 1t will probably not
be possible to obtain a fluoride fuel
with more than 4 mole % uranium that
has close to optimumphysical properties
from the heat transfer standpoint,
in fact, from the standpoaint of
physical properties, there appears to
be an 1mportant incentive for keeping
the uranium concentration less than
2 mole %. On the basis of critical
mass data from the calculations and
the critical experiments, 1t appears
that a fuel-region diameter of at
least 18 1n. wi1ll be requaired to
satisfy this condition.

A major consideration 1n es-
tablishing the core diameter 1s the
power density. Work 1s currently
under way to determine the effect of
power density on radiation damage.
Although the experimental results are
difficult to interpret and therefore
no clearly defined limit to the
allowable power density has been
established, 1t 1sentairely conceivable
that radiation damage considerations
w1ll not be the limiting factor.

The kinetics of reactor control
are very complex. Work carried out
thus far on control of the reactor
indicates that transient power surges
may cause unacceptably large tempera-
ture excursions 1f the temperature of
the circulating fluoride fuel exceeds
1000 to 2000°F per second. A tempera-
ture rise of 2000°F/sec 1in the fuel
would i1mply a power density of approxi-
mately 3 kw/ecm®. This, in turn, would
mean that a core diameter of about
21 i1n. would be required for a 200, 000-
kw reactor.

The problemof cooling the moderator
becomes more severe as power density
1s 1ncreased. As the power density
1s 1ncreased for a given reactor
power output, the percentage of the
fission energy that appears as heat
1n the moderator 1s increased and the
intensity of heat generation in that
portion of the moderator closest to
the fuel regionis essentially directly
proportional to the power density an
the fuel. Althoughit seems practicable

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

to design and build the moderator
cooling system for a reactor having
power densities of up to 8 or 10 kw/cm?,
moderator cooling considerations
seem to 1ndicate that power densities
higher than 10 kw/cm® would be 1inad-
visable

Temperature variations in the fluid
fuel 1n the core will be a function
of both the velocity distribution and
the power density With a gaiven
velocity distribution, 1t would be
expected that certain localities such
as the boundary layer or the centers
of eddies would run substantially
hotter than the bulk mean temperature
of the fuel The magnitude of thas
temperature differential will depend,
to some extent, on the thermal conduc-
tivity of the fluid, but the rate at
which heat 1s dispersed by turbulent
interchange of particles between
hot and cold regions will probably
be much more important The Reynold’s
number for a high-power reactor will
be somewhere between 10° and 10°,
depending on fuel viscosity and design
values for the reactor core diameter
and the fuel temperature rise. At
present, 1t 1s not possible to make
more than the roughest sortof estimate
of the magnitude of the temperature
differenti1al between these hot spots
and the free stream. The problem 1s
being attacked both theoretacally
and experimentally, and 1t 1s hoped
that results from at least the latter
wi1ll place an upper limit on the
magnitude of the effectsto be expected.
One possible 111 effect with respect
to control could arise from these
hot spots If boiling were to take
place, 1rregular fluctuations ain
power level that would probably be
similar to those experienced 1n
boiling experiments made with the
LITR(?) would be expected to result.
There 1s also a possibilaty that

coupling of the oscillations i1n power
with the periodic fluctuations 1n
fluid flow that caused the eddies or
other hot spots might take place.
After the various considerations
outlined above were examined, 1t
appeared that only i1n a full-scale
experiment can the maximum, allowable,
power density in a fluid-fuel reactor
core be definitely established. Thas,
in turn, i1mplies that the first
experiment of this sort should be run
with the smallest practical core size
because the cost of the experiment
would be largely a function of the
total amount of heat to be dissipated.
Hence, the cheapest experiment to
yield a definitive answer will be the
one carried out with the smallest
reactor core that might reasonably be
expected to yield a power plant of
adequate s1ze Since fuel chemistry
and critical mass considerations
indicate that an 18-1n -dia core 1is
the smallest that can be used with
fluoride fuels that have desairable
physical properties, most design work
has been based on reactor core sizes
ranging from 18 to 21 i1n in diameter
Temperature, Pressure, and Stress.
Two major tenets of the design phi-
losophy have been that the pressures
throughout the fluid systems should be

zones, and that all structure should
be cooled to a temperature approxi-
mately equal to or below that of the
secondary coolant leaving the heat
exchanger. The temperature, pressure,
and stress values calculated for
various stations in the reactor are
indicated in Fig 4 27. The stresses
1n the structural parts have been
kept to a minimum Thermal stresses
were not included in this diagram,
since 1t 1s felt that they will anneal
out at these temperatures and, at
worst, will cause a little distortion
that should not be serious. Table 4 2
gives strength data on Inconel and
columbium Recent tests indicate
that 1n the absence of oxygen the
creep rate of Inconel may be two or
three times the rate given ain the
table for a given stress level.
Examination of Fig. 4.27 will show
that the stresses have been kept so
low that the creep rate should not
prove to be a serious problem. Note
that the highest stresses are in the
heat exchanger tubes.

A small, experimental, heat ex-
changer has been designed for in-
vestigating the problem of fabricating
tube bundles and header connections of
the type required. Although small,
the heat exchanger should be capable

 

 

 

 

kept low, particularly i1n the hot of transmitting 1 5 megawatts of heat

expected that, ultimately, six, small,
heat exchangers will be built for
investigating the effects on endurance
life of operation at various tempera-
ture and pressure levels. Figure 4.28
shows one tube bundle for this heat
exchanger. Six of these bundles will
be used in a 5-in.-dia cylindrical
annulus instead of in the larger and
more complex spherical shell array
envisaged for the full-scale reactor.

The temperatures specified in Fig. 4,27
were based on the highest temperatures
that appear reasonable from the stand-
pointof compatibility of the beryllium-
sodium-Inconel system. Higher tempera-
tures would be likely to give trouble
because of mass transfer and because
of attack of the Inconel canning
material by the beryllium. The
temperature levels required should
not be difficult to attain, since the
moderator heat would be removed at a
high temperature level. Two engines
could be fitted with small auxiliary
radiators placed between the compressor
and the main radiators. These could
be employed to subcool a portion of
the secondary circuit NaK to, perhaps,
900°F. This cooler NaK could then be
fed to the Na-to-NaK heat exchanger
at the top of the reactor. There, by
cooling the sodium from the moderator
cooling circuit, i1t would be heated
to about 1100°F so that it would then
flow to the main heat exchanger at
the same temperature as that of the
NaK from the other radiator circuits.
Thus the weight penalty attached to
cooling the moderator region would be
only about 400 1lb of radiator core
plus possibly 200 1b of extra reactor
shield and 100 1b of pump and line
weight.

Lead, bismuth, a nonuranium bearing
fluoride, sodium, and NaK were all
given serious consideration as coolants
for the beryllium moderator. The
metallurgists felt that lead or
bismuth would be likely to pose a
serious mass transfer problem. The
relatively high neutron absorption
cross section of the potassium in the
NaK made it quite undesirable from
the critical mass standpoint. Rubidium
might be used in place of potassium
but, because of little demand, it is
currently very expensive. Thus sodium
seemed to be the best choice for a
moderator coolant. Since corrosion
and mass transfer are likely to occur
in a Be-NaK-Na system, it seemed
essential that the beryllium be clad

 
1n some fashion. Work at Battelle!®’
indicates that beryllium can be
chrome-plated to give satisfactory
resistance to sodium attack at 932°F,
However, this work was carried out on
small specimens, and there 1s a
question as to whether adequate
protection to the very large surface
areas required would be practical.
An alternate possibility would be to
can the beryllium in thain-walled
Inconel cans and to fill the small
1nterstices between the beryllium and
the can with stagnant sodaum. This
arrangement appears to be the more
promising of the two, but both possi-
bilities are being investigated. The
reflector could be constructed of two
large hemispheres of beryllium 1f the
canning technique were used Cooling
passages couldbe rifle-drilled through
the beryllium and lined with thain-
walled tubes, which could be welded
into headers at the ends The Brush
Beryllium Co. has indicated that the
fabricationof these large hemispheraical
shells would probably be no more
difficult than the fabrication of
large flat slabs The personnel of
the Y-12 beryllaum shop state that 1t
would not be difficult to rafle-
drill holes 3/16to 1/4 1n. 1in diameter
and as much as 40 1n deep, with the
hole diameter held to within 0.001 in.
and the hole center location held to
within 0.010 inch. Since 1t would be
very difficult to plate the 1insides of
holes, an alternate construction that
appears attractive, 1f chrome-plated
blocks prove practicable, 1s the use
of a large number of wedge-shaped
segments, which would be shaped much
like the sections of an orange. These
sections could be made with shallow
grooves 1n their surfaces that would
form passages for cooling streams of
sodium in the assembly.

The choice of a secondary coolant
was di1fficult., Careful examination of
the components i1n the external system

indicates that about 40 ft® of fluad
would be required as a minimum. This
means that 1f lead or bismuth were
used, the weight required would be an
the range of 30,000 pounds. A number
of molten salt mixtures was considered,
but the melting points 1n all cases
were above 300°F, which 1s objectionably
high. Other media were rejected be-
cause of corrosion considerations.
Sodium or NaK seemed to be definitely
superior to any other coolant con-
si1dered except for the objectionable
neutron activation and resultant gamma
activity of sodium, and the faire
hazard associated with a possible
leak. Shielding characteristics
indicate that for the most promising
distribution of shielding materaial
between the reactor and the crew, gamma
activity from the sodium would be less
troublesome than the prompt-gamma
activity from the reactor core. Con-
si1derable experience with sodium has
1indicated that 1f the plumbing 1s
designed to keep the stresses low so
that burst types of failure will not
result, leaks that do occur as the
result of fatigue cracks or corrosion
pits develop slowly and do not result
in serious fires, In fact, saince
sodium does not explode (so long as no
water 1s present), 1n many ways 1t
seems no more hazardous than gasoline.
After all the factors were weighed,
the most promising secondary fluad
appeared to be NaK., A 56% sodium and
44% potassium alloy, which has a melt-
1ng point of 56°F, was chosen for the
analysis. Its low melting point,
excellent heat transfer characteristics,
good corrosion characteristics 1n
1iron-chrome-nickel alloys, and low
densi1ty made 1t appear to be the best
choace.

Reflector Heating (A. H. Fox, R. W.
Bussard, ANP Division). The heating
of the reflector of a reactor by the
absorption of gamma radiation and the
slowing down of neutrons originating
1n the core presents a heat removal
task that 1s only an order of magnitude

69
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

smaller than that of cooling the core
1tself.

The distribution of the heat
generated 1n the moderator depends on
the strength and location of the
sources and on the attenuation of the
radiation between the sources and the
point 1n question. For the gamma-ray
energies of interest, the mechanism of
degradation i1nvolves principally the
Compton collisions. The mechanism of
degradation of energy of the core
gammas 1s complicated, even with the
most simple geometry of source and
reflector, for amore complex geometry,
such as that of the reflector-moderated
reactor, many simplifying assumptions
are necessary before even an approxi-
mate estimate of the rate of heat
generation 1in the beryllium may be
obtained,

The first approximation used 1in-
volved the straight-ahead theory of
gamma absorption for whichit 1s assumed
that Compton collisions merely degrade
1in energy and do not scatter the
photons. Only exponential attenuation
with a coefficient that 1s charac-
teristic of the material through which
the photons pass need be considered.
When a photon passes from one medium
to another, no refraction 1s con-
sidered. Use of a buildup factor to
allow for ordinary scattering 1s being
investigated.

Another saimplifying assumption
concerned the source distraibution.
Only the total amount of gamma flux
was considered, and variations from
point to point 1n the core were
neglected, Thus an average power
density for the core was determined
simply by dividing the total reactor
power output by the volume of the fuel
region of the core. (An 1investigation
of sources distributed as indicated by
the critical experiments showed only
a small variation in results.)

The particular case considered was
that of an 18-1n.-dia, spherical,
fluoride-fuel region surrounding a

9-1n.-d1a, central, beryllium 1island

70

and enclosed by al2-in.-thick beryllium
reflector, A 3/l16-in.-thick layer of
Inconel was considered as being the
separating material between the fuel
region and each of the two moderator
regions. The reactor power output was
taken as 200 megawatts, and the energy
evolved 1n the gammas was taken as
12 Mev/fission, which gave a total
power from gammas of 12 megawatts and
a gamma source density i1n the fuel
region of 275 watts/cm>. The average
gamma energy was assumed to be 1 Mev,
and the reciprocal attenuation lengths
for the fuel, Inconel, and beryllium-
moderator regions were taken as 0.09,
0.30, and 0.16 cm™!, respectively.

The power density was computed at
points spaced about 1 in., apart along
a radius from the center of the island
to the outside of the reflector. The
resulting values are given in Table
4,3 (case A) and Fig. 4.29. Table 4.4
(case A) shows the integrated values
of the power, in the various regions
of i1nterest, obtained by graphical
integration of the power density curve.
The fact that the total gamma heating
indicated by Table 4.3 1s only 10,6
megawatts 1nstead of the 12 megawatts
assumed 1s due, 1n part, to leakage
from the reflector and,
the approxaimations made for the
computations. However, 1t 1s believed
that the distribution of the gamma
heating 1s approximated quite well by
Fig. 4.29., One important result of
this work 1sthat for this configuration
more than 60% of the gamma energy goes
into heating the fuel. A second
computation was made with different
values for the reciprocal attenuation
lengths, that 1s, 0.06 and 0.13 cm™!
for the fuel and beryllaium, re-
spectively, and the results are shown
1n Table 4.3 as case B, As can be
seen, this relatively large change had
no great effect on the distribution of
the gamma heating. The total power

of both the sodium and, especially, the
Inconel must be minimized to keep
parasitic neutron absorptions withain
reasonable limits. The neutron flux
curves show that from the neutron
economy standpolnt coolant passages 1n
the beryllium are much more i1mportant
several inches from the fuel region
than at the fuel-moderator interface.
Thermal stresses will be set up by
temperature variations 1in the beryl-
lium. Since an elongation of about

the operating temperatures envisioned,
thermal stresses should not lead to
cracking but might cause distortion
that could become a problem after a
number of thermal cycles of the system.
For this reason, the temperature
variation i1n the beryllium between
adjacent coolant passages was held to
50°F. The pressure drop through the
various coolant passages was limited
to 40 ps1i to keep pressure-induced
stresses low, The maximum beryllium-

SHIELDING

A. P. Fraas, ANP Division
J. B. Trice, Solid State Division

The shield design philosophy that
has been the basis of the work on
the reflector-moderated reactor shield
has been that an operational airplane,
in the military sense of the word, can
be achieved only with great difficulty
with the use of a divided shield
because a divided shield would give an
unprotected man 50 ft from the reactor
a lethal dose 1n 15 seconds. Those
experienced in aircraft operation and
maintenance know that perhaps 50% of
the maintenance work 1nvolves non-

scheduled operations, the character
and detailed nature of which are
1mpossible to predict without an
extensive background of experience.
Provision of an adequate set of equip-
ment and facilities to take care of
all contingencies promises to 1nvolve
expenditures of the same order as
those required for the nuclear power
plant 1tself, It was felt that 1f
the radiation dose at full power
could be cut to about 10 r/hr at 50 ft
from the reactor, the greater majority
of the nonscheduled maintenance jobs
that might delay a flight at the last
minute or require emergency attention
immediately following a landing could
be handled without special equipment.
For this reason, effort has been
directed toward the development of
something closely approaching a unit
shield., It 1s fully realized that a
welght penalty 1s inevitable.

It was found that the 1nitaial
startup and warmup of the reactor can
probably be carried out at power
levels that, i1n general, do not exceed
10% of the full power of the reactor,
thus the radiation dose during startup
and warmup would be 10% of that at
full power. If in the tuneup process
the operations must be carried out
close to the reactor, the reactor
might be 1dled down from 10% to
perhaps 1% of full power output so
that the radiation dose at any parta-
cular point would be only 1% of the
full-power dose. It 1s true, however,
that after a long flight the accumu-
lation of fission products will
constitute a substantial gamma dose
even after the reactor 1s shut down
completely. This dose w1ll still be
only of the order of 1 or 2% of the
total radiation dose at full power
output because the decay gammas are
fewer 1n number and softer than the
prompt gammas. A drain valve will be
provided at the bottom of the reactor
so that the fluoride fuel can be drained
1nto underground tanks. It 1s hoped
that about 98% of the fuel can be
removed by a simple draining operation
and that most of the remaining fuel
can be flushed out by using a non-
uranium-bearing fluoride. Precisely
what can be done 1n this direction
1s difficult to predict, but one of
the major 1tems of information ex-
pected from ARE test work 1s the
extent to which the radiation from a
circulating-fluoride-fuel reactor can
be reduced by draining and flushing.
The degree to which the Inconel
structure wi1ll be activated and waill
represent an i1mportant source of
radiation after shutdown 1s difficult
to estimate, If the shield 1s not
disassembled, rough estimates indicate

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

that the Inconel activation should not
be a problem. Here again, the ARE
w1ll yield much valuable information.
The shield for the 200-megawatt
reflector-moderated reactor has some
characteristics that are peculiar to
this particular reactor configuration.,
As 1ndicated i1n an earlier section,
the thick reflector was selected on
the basis of shielding considera-
tions.{%) The two major reasons for
using a thick reflector are that a
reflector about 12 in., thick followed
by a layer of boron-bearing material
w1ll attenuate the neutron flux to
the point where the secondary gamma
flux can be reduced to an unimportant
level for a quasi-unit shell., Thas
thickness also reduces the neutron
leakage flux from the reflector to
the heat exchanger to the level of
that from the delayed neutrons ap-
pearing 1n the i1ntermediate heat
exchanger as delayed neutrons from
the circulating fuel. An additional
advantage of the thick reflector 1is
that 99.98% of the energy developed
in the core will appear as heat 1in
the high-temperature zone inside the
pressure shell. This means that
very little of the energy produced
by the reactor must be disposed of
with a parasitic cooling system at a
low temperature level. The materaal
1in the spherical-shell i1ntermediate
heat exchanger 1s about 70%as effective
as water for the removal of fast
neutrons, so 1t too 1s of value from
the shielding standpoint. The delayed
neutrons and the decay gammas from
the circulating fuel 1n the heat
exchanger region might appear to pose
a serious handicap. However, each
has an attenuation length that 1s much
shorter than the corresponding attenu-
ation length for radiation from the
core. Thus, from the outer surface
of the shield, the intermediate heat
exchanger appears as a much less

1ntense source of radiation than the
more deeply buried reactor core.

It 1s true that this arrangement
violates one of the precepts of the
matched shield, namely, that each
layer of heavy material should be
placed as close to the reactor core
as possible, However, the loss in
weight associated with the disparaty
between this i1deal case and the shield
layout of Fig., 4.32 1s not too great,
whereas the engineering advantages
derived are of crucial importance.

A series of Lid Tank experiments
1S 1h progress to determine the
optimum arrangement and thickness of
the various beryllium, boron carbide,
1ron, lead, and borated water layers
for a shield of the type shown ain
Fig. 4.32, which represents the best
configuration tested to date, When
this series of tests 1s completed,
the resulting shield will be used as
a basis for comparison. Further tests
wi1ll be run with more unusual materaials,
Rough calculations i1ndicate that as
much as 10,000 1b of shield weaght
mi1ght be saved through the use of
some of the special materials. When
the test work 1s completed, 1t 1s
hoped that a fairly sound basis for
a decision on the use of these special
materials will be provided by a com-
parison of their cost and attendant
welght savings relative to the simpler
shield configuration of Figure 4,32,

One of the major pieces of 1in-
formation obtained from the Lid Tank
experiments has been the confirmation
of the original estimates of the
degree of activation of sodium 1n the
heat exchanger region. It had been
suspected that in a relatively than
slab of material having the poor
moderating properties of the heat
exchanger matrix, neutrons of 0.1 Mev
or higher would tend to escape from
the slab long before they could be
slowed down. Although 1t 1s not possible
to simulate the effects of the cir-
culating fuel i1n the Lid Tank experi-

76

ments, the spectrum of the delayed
neutrons 1s not too different from
that of the bulk of the neutrons that
escape from the fuel region through
the thick beryllium reflector and the
heavy boron carbide curtain between
the reflector and the heat exchanger.
For this reason, 1t 1s felt that the
sodium activation data from the Lid
Tank experiments give a good basis for
estimating the activation of the sodium
1n a full-scale reactor of the type
shown 1n Fig. 4.25, On this basais,
1t appears that the sodium activity
after a long period of full-power
output will give a dose of about 1
r/hr at 50 ft from the reactor. The
activity of the potassium in the Nak
would be much less than that of the
sodium. (%) The NaK could be drained
after operation and the activated
sodium allowed to decay. Several
weeks should suffice to bring the
activaity of the sodium down to a
negligible level.

The design described 1s believed
to give enough shielding all around
the reactor to give a dose of 5 r/hr
at 50 ft from the center of the reactor
at full power. An additional lead
layer would be employed at the front
of the reactor to act as a light
shadow shield for the crew. Further
shadow shielding would be employed
at the back of the crew compartment
to attenuate the radiation from both
the reactor and the NaK radiators to
give a dose of approximately 1 r/hr
1nside the crew compartment., Tables
4.5 and 4.6 give detailed data for

such a configuration for several
reactor core diameters, power out-
puts, and power densities. Further

work covering the effects on shield
weight of various dose levels for
both ground and flight crews 1s under
way.

POWER PLANT DESIGN

A. P. Fraas, ANP Division

Some early work on nuclear power
plants i1nvolved detailed designs of
power plants in which the engines were
widely separated from the reactor. The
acute problems of differential thermal

expansion, thermal lag and system
control, and the plumbing weight
associ1ated with these arrangements
1ndicated that i1t would be advantageous
to use compact units, Thus, the
current trend toward compact power
packages, followed by both the General
Electric Co. and the Pratt and Whitney
Aircraft Division, seems 1in order.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

In considering the types of appli-
cation of greatest 1nterest, 1t
appeared that there are three repre-
sentative cases namely, aB-36 flight-
test-bed installation, a Mach 0.9 sea-
level bomber, and a Mach 1.5 high-
altitude bomber. In sketching pre-
liminary layouts, 1t appeared that
there was little difference 1n the
requirements for the first two, and
the third differed 1n not too serious
a fashion., As a result, the layout
of Fig. 4.25 was prepared for the
Mach 0.9 sea-level bomber on the
basis that 1t would require a reactor
heat output of 200 megawatts.,
presumed that the same power plant
might be used for preliminary test
work at a reduced power, say 130
megawatts, in a B-36 flight-test-bed
installation.

Table 4.7 gives the weight of
various components of the installation
shown in Fig. 4.33. If an 1increase
1n power were made, the weight of the

would i1ncrease as indicated in Table
4.6, and the weight of engines,
radiators, pumps, and lines would be
roughly proportional to the power

A

to be required at an altitude at which
the air-swallowing capacity of the
engines was cut in half, the turbojet
engine weight would be doubled. The
wei1ght of the radiators would be
increased by, perhaps, 50%, but the
weight of the pumps and lines would
remain substantially the same. The
power plant of Fig. 4.33 represents
only a preliminary layout for showing
the proportions that might be expected.
The thrust that can be obtained from
this power plant 1s heavily dependent
on the allowable reactor operating
temperature., By careful design of the
moderator-cooling system, 1t will be
possible to keep the temperature of
all structural parts down to the
temperature of the secondary fluid
leaving the i1ntermediate heat ex-
changer. This should make 1t possible
to operate such a power plant, con-
structed of Inconel, at NaK outlet
temperature of about 1500°F for 500
hours. A take-off or war-emergency
rating of 1600°F might be permitted
for perhaps 20 to 50 hr of the 500
hours.

as that shown i1n Fig. 4.25. The
shield was designed so that 1t might
be inserted through an opening 6 ft
8 1n., wide in the bottom of the fuse-
lage. Thus 1t would lend 1tself to
installation in the bomb bay of the
B-36 just aft of the main spar. Two
cantilever beams placed on 6-ft centers
were employed as the primary structure,
The front ends of these beams could
be bolted or pinned to fittings on the
rear spar, and the reactor and the
shield structure could be attached to
the rear ends. The shield structure
would be divaided
sections, each of which would consist
of an i1nner lavyer of lead and an
outer tank of rubber that would be
filled with borated water. The top
and bottom sections would be separated
from the four sections in the central
region by surfaces of revolution for
enclosing the NaK ducts through the
shield. A large, bowl-shaped, rubber
tank would be placed at each side.
These tanks could be deflated while
the power plant was being inserted 1in
the airplane and could be filled with
water after the power plant was 1in
place., The top section of the shield
would be penetrated by five tubes.
Four of these tubes would carry quill
shafts to transmit power from bleed-
off air turbines to the pumps at the
top of the reactor, and the fifth
tube would carry the control rod
actuating mechanism.

into s1x major

Each of the engine radiators would
be coupled to a separate tube bundle
1n the i1ntermediate heat exchanger in
such a way that there would be 16
separate secondary fluid circuits.
The expansion tank, filter, and pump
for each of these circuits would be
located at the point of greatest
elevation and lowest temperature ain
the system, that 1s, at the top of
the shield and just outside 1t. Thus
the NaK would leave the pumps and
pass i1nto the shield, through the
1ntermediate heat exchanger, back out

82

through the shield down to the ra%fator,
and back up to the pump. Thejpipes
passing to and from the radiator
would be approximately 3 1/2 in, ain
diameter, The pressure drop through
the radiators would be about 35 psa,
and that through pipes fromthe reactor
would be about 7 psi. In all cases,
the pressure has been kept low to
keep the stresses low and, hence, to
minimize the likelihood of a burst
type of failure., Thus, even though
small leaks might occur as a result
of fatigue cracks or small corrosion
pits 1n welded or brazed joints, 1t
seems likely that a major leak (except
for gunfire) could be avoided.

The turbojet engines indicated in
Fig. 4.33 are modifications of a new
engine being developed by the Wraight
Aeronautical Corp. The original
engine 1s a high-compression-ratio
two-spool machine. Since fuel economy
1s less important than engine weight
for a power plant of the type shown, (11?
an estimate of the weight of a modified
engine was prepared by the Wraght
Aeronautical Corp., and estimated
performance curves for these engines
are given i1n Fig, 4,34, The radiators
used 1n these turbojets are of the
same type as those that have been
tested at ORNL in the form of core
elements during the past year. One of
these radiator cores operated for over
1000 hr at 1500°F, or above, including
over 40 hr at 1700°F.¢(11) J¢ ;5
expected that developmental work now
in process will produce lighter units
with better heat transfer performance
than the radiators of this preliminary
design,

The procedure that might be followed
to assemble the complete peower plant
would be to mount the reactor on the
cantilever beams that support i1t and
the shield assembly, The turbojet
engines would then be mounted to

structure 'attached to these same
cantilever beams. The pipes connecting
the engine radiator to the reactor
and heat exchanger assembly could then
be welded i1nto position, along with
the NaK pump and header tank assemblies,
The entire system could then be
pressure checked carefully and examined
closely for leaks. It would probably
prove desirable to i1nstall NaK in the
secondary circuit, sodium 1n the
moderator circuit, operate the pumps,
and check all components carefully for
leaks before the thermal insulation
was 1nstalled. An auxiliary supply
of compressed air would be required
to run the sodium and NaK pumps at
perhaps half speed for this check.
The system temperatures 1in the NakK
circuits would not have to exceed room
temperature, but an auxiliary burner
arrangement should be provided to heat
the two radiators coupled to the two
sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers for
the moderator cooling system. These
heaters could be used to bring the
sodium system temperature up to 300
or 400°F. Upon satisfactory completion
of this test work, thermal insulation
could be installed around the reactor
pressure shell and the connecting
lines and pumps of the sodium circuit,
By using the same heat source, the
sodium system could be brought up to
perhaps 1000°F and a nonuranium-
bearing fluoride salt could be pumped
into the reactor. The fluoride-fuel
system could then be checked and
drained, and the lead shielding and
the rubber tanks for the borated water
could be i1nstalled to complete the
assembly. After the power plant unit
had been i1nstalled i1n the airplane,
the rubber tanks could be filled with
borated water, and the necessary
connections could be made for the
instruments and controls.

84

In starting up the reactor, 1t 1is
expected that the NaK circuits would
be used to heat the sodium to bring
the reactor temperature up to about
1000°F. A fluoride fuel melt con-
taining less than the desired amount
of uranium would then be poured ainto
the fuel system and circulated.
Gradual additions of a fluoride melt
containing a rather high percentage of
U23% could be made until the reactor
became critical. The temperature of
the reactor could then be allowed
to 1ncrease to the desired value -
probably an average temperature of
1300°F - and the load could be gradually
increased by starting up first one
and then another of the turbojet
engines., It will probably be possible
to depend upon the self-stabilizing
characteristics i1nherent in the
fluoride fuel reactor to keep the
mean fluoride temperature essentially
constant so that, i1in effect, the
reactor would become a slave to the
turbojet engines and would act as a
constant-temperature heat source.,
Control of the individual turbojet
engines could be accomplished by
varying the amount of air allowed to
bypass the radiators through adjustable
louvers 1n the helical baffles between
In effect, this would
give a variable, mean, turbine-air-
inlet temperature. Coupled with this
control, 1t would probably be necessary
to have an adjustable jet exit nozzle
to give good performance and to avoid
compressor stall over a wide range
of operating conditions. Fine control
of reactor temperature could be
accomplished through the use of one
or two control rods in the central
1sland or i1n the reflector region.
Coarse shim control could be obtained
by varying the uranium concentration
in the fluoride fuel,

SHIELDING RESEARCH
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

E. P. Blazard

J. L. Meem, Associate

Physics Divasion

With the development of a reactor
design 1n which the fissions are
confined to a small volume, and an
which 1t 1s hoped the radiators can
be kept relatively nonradioactive,
the hopes for a laght unait shield
have been revived. Accordingly, a
unit-shield mockup was recently
installed i1n the Lid Tank Facilaty
and 1s now being optimized with regard
to the location of the shield com-
ponents. In addition, an intensive
search 1s beaing carried out for
promising materials that could be
used 1n the unit shield. Measurements
of relative shielding effectiveness
1indicate lathaium to be a promisaing
component for neutron shielding, and
inquiries have been i1nitiated to
determine whether uranium could be
made available and fabricated as a
gamma shield (sec. 5).

The air-scattering experiments at
the Bulk Shielding Facility have
been completed. Earlier difficulties
have been ascribable primarily to
unsuspected background effects, and
1ndications now are that the weights
described 1n the report of the Shielding
Board (1950) were approximately
correct. The neutrons were somewhat
low and the gamma rays somewhat high,
with the weight differences approxai-
mately cancelling. The i1rradiataion
of animals in the Bulk Shielding
Facility 1s now complete, and the

animals i1nvolved have been returned
for long-range observation of the
biological effects of these exposures.
Neutron spectroscopy on the divaded
shield i1n the Bulk Shielding Facility
has now commenced, and the first few
spectra have been measured with the
proton-recoil spectrometer. The
results are only preliminary, hence,
no data are yet available. However,
the gamma spectral measurements from
the divided-shield mockup are beang
tabulated for machine calculations
(sec. 6).

The Tower Shielding Facilaity design
1s being developed rapidly. The
tower structure design 1s final and a
building 1s fairly completely laad
out. The Reactor design features and
some of the instrumentation are yet
to be developed. Indications are that
the facility will begin operataion
by the end of the calendar year, and
tests with the first shields will
commence shortly thereafter (sec. 7).

A neutron spectrometer 1s being
developed that utilizes scintillation
in a lithium fluoride crystal. This
apparatus gives promise of appreciably
greater sensitivity than recoil-proton
spectrometers 1f developmental diffi-
culties can be overcome. No cross-
secti1on measurements were completed
on the 6-Mev Van de Graaff during the
quarter because the machine was being
moved to 1ts permanent location an the

X-10 Area (sec. 8).

The Lid Tank Facility has been
used during the past quarter pramarily
for measuring the fast-neutron removal
cross sections of a number of con-
ventional and potential shieldaing
materials. In addition, a mockup of
the unit shield of the reflector-
moderated reactor has been assembled.

EFFECTIVE FAST-NEUTRON REMOVAL
CROSS SECTIONS

The following effective fast-
neutron removal cross sections have
been measured

Al 1.19 barns/atom
Be 1.12 barns/atom
Cu 2.08 barns/atom
Fe 1.93 barns/atom
LiF 2.80 barns/molecule

W 3.08 barns/atom

The data on lithium fluoride are
particularly interesting. If fluorine
1s assigned a cross section of 1
barn, as would be indicated from a
comparison with previously measured
values for oxygen and carbon, 1t
would appear that lithium exhaibats
a cross section of 1.8 barns. Thas
is exceptionally high for such a light
nucleus, and, 1f verified, reveals a
real i1ncentive for using this element
in aircraft shields. Accordingly, 1t
1s planned to measure the cross section
of fluorine as soon as possible by
usingslabs ofa saturated fluorocarbon.

Measurements have also been made
on the effect of replacing water near
the source with a slab of transformer
o1l (CH,). By comparison of these
measurements with those for graphite,
1t 1s possible to determine the effect
of the oxygen that the o1l replaced
1n the water close to the source.

This represents the first measurement
of the true effective removal cross
section for this element. Previous
estimates have been dependent upon a
somewhat different definition, because
the oxygen that was measured was
spread throughout the shield as in
water It 1s 1nteresting to note
that, as might be expected, the oxygen
exhibits a somewhat greater effectave
removal cross section 1in the location
near the source.

It had been proposed by Sleeper of
Brookhaven National Laboratory that
deuterium might prove a more effective
shield component than hydrogen because
of the more nearly isotropic scattering
(laboratory system) 1t exhibits
because of 1ts i1ncreased mass. To
explore this point, a tank of D,0 was
1inserted next to the source 1n the
Li1d Tank Facility, and an effectave
removal cross section was measured
Results 1ndicate a difference 1n
effective removal cross section
between normal and heavy hydrogen of
0.1 barn. This corresponds very
closely to the difference 1n thexr
total cross sections 1n the range of
about 2 to 5 Mev and indicates that
no added premium accrues from the
increased angle of scattering or, at
least, that this 1s counterbalanced
by the greater energy degradation of
the light hydrogen.

MOCKUP OF THE UNIT SHIELD OF THE
REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR

Recently a mockup has been installed
in the Lid Tank Facility to simulate
the reflector heat exchanger and the
unit shield of the Fireball reactor.
The beryllium reflector 1s simulated
by a large slab of material supplied
by KAPL plus some additional material

89
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

that was available at the Y-12 sate,
The heat exchanger 1s simulated by
sodium fluoride and airon, the sodium
fluoride 1s loaded into large, than,
1ron boxes. The prototype for the
shield will be of lead and water, and
tests currently under way are designed
to determine the optimum location of
the lead within the water.

90

An investigation will also be made
of the desirability of borating part
of the water. These experiments have
just begun, and therefore no firm data
are yet available, however, there are
indications that the over-all reactor-
shield weight will be very low. This
1s a direct result of the small volume
to which the fissions are confined.

AIR-SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS

The air-scattering experiment at
the Bulk ShieldingFacility, originally
carried out last summer,(!*2) has
been extended and i1mproved 1in an
effort to understand the serious
discrepancy that appeared to be extant
between this experiment and the calcu-
lations of the Shielding Board.(?’
With the increased power now available,
100 kw having recently been approved
for the BSR, 1t 1s now possible to
eliminate much of the extrapolation
previously required. In addition, 1t
was discovered that the radioactaivaity
1n the pool water was responsible for
a large part of the observed dose 1n
the mocked-up crew position. Measure-
ments were taken to determine the
effect of spurious radiations scatter-
1ing from the pool walls, as well as
from the reactor support structure.

These were found to contribute only
negligibly to the observed neutron and
gamma doses.

Although the experiment has been
completed so recently that 1t as
1mpossible at this time to give a
complete report, the following con-
clusions can be drawn

1. The neutron dose 1n the crew
compartment appears to be lower by a
factor of 5 than the ANP-53 calcu-
lations i1ndicate. The advantage
accruing from this amounts to about
5000 1b for the standard crew-shield
design.

2. The gamma-ray dose in the crew
compartment appears to be higher than
indicated by the ANP-53 design by a
factor of 3.5. The weight penalty
associated with this 1s about 6000
pounds.

The conclusions differ from the
earlier ones both i1n the magnitude
of the discrepancies and 1n the amount
of material required to make up the
added attenuation. Since this experi-
ment 1s basically so very crude,
further exploitation of the Bulk
Shielding Facility in this type of
work 1s not considered worthwhile,
the present comparison with the ANP-53
calculations 1s considered adequate.

IRRADIATION OF ANIMALS

In addition to the two groups of
monkeys mentioned 1n a previous
quarterly report,¢*) a third group has
been i1rradiated by the Bulk Shielding
Reactor. The complete series of
experiments 1s summarized 1n Table 6.1.

trate the time decay of neutrons and
gamma rays from the reactor after

unity for operations at 1 and 100 kw
and plotted against time after scramming
the reactor. It 1s i1nteresting to
note how the (¥,n) reactionon beryllium
keeps the neutron level fairly haigh.
Without the beryllium oxide reflector,
the neutrons decay with periods that
are characteristic of the delayed-

Physiecs Division

J. Y. Estabrook, ANP Division

The preliminary design of the
Tower Shielding Facility proposed
by the firm of Knappen-Tippetts-
Abbett-McCarthy (KTAM), architectural
engineers, was accepted by ORNL early
1n January. Some delay was necessitated
by the discovery that the tower design
first considered by KTAM proved
exceptionally heavy 1n structural
steel, particularly i1n the long
overhead members from which the loads
were supported by a vertical hoist.
Since the heavier members raised the
background from structural scattering
beyond reasonable limits, a design was
proposed that eliminated the overhead
structure and reduced the weight of
the legs bya factorof approximately 2.
The designs and specifications of the
tower and associated buildings are
now scheduled for completion by KTAM
and the OBNL Engineering Department
on March 1.

Design, procurement, and con-
struction of the reactor and instru-
ments, as well as engineering of the
site, road, and utilities, are being
done by ORNL. This work 1s proceeding
ahead of schedule, at present.

TOWER DESIGN

The tower design 1s shown 1n
Figs., 7.1 and 7.2. The structure
1s 315 ft hagh and has a 200-ft insade
clearance 1n the north-south cdirection
and a 101-ft i1nside clearance 1n the
east-west direction. The four tower
columns are 9 ft square and weagh
approximately 400 1b per running foot.

The loads will be raised by saix
individual hoists - two for the

reactor shield and four for the crew
shield. The reactor shield can be
raised 200 ft off the ground, and 1t
may be moved laterally to approach:
the tower legs. This lateral movement
will permit measurement of the radi-
ations scattered by the tower structure,
The four hoists supporting the crew
compartment will allow considerable
flexibilaity 1n the crew compartment
position and orientation, 1including
the possibilaity of a variation of
from 35 to 100 ft in the reactor-to-
crew separation distance.

CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE

The tentative schedule for outside
engineers and contractors for completing
their various phases of design and
construction of the Tower Shieldaing
Facility have been somewhat optimisti-
cally estimated as follows

February 24 Design completed and submitted

to bidders

March 17 Bids received
March 20 Contracts awarded
June 15 Construction of the roads, tower

foundation, and guy anchors

ment.

neutrons has appeared so promising
for shielding work that two research
personnel have been assigned to the
project to accelerate the work.
Although europium-activated lithium

10odide crystals have been used to
date, lathium fluoride would be much
more desirable because of 1ts lower
gamma-ray response. Jhe work 1s now
concentrated i1n an effort to grow a
lithium fluoride crystal with suitable
scintillation properties.

MATERIALS RESEARCH
INTRODUCTION

The research on fused fluoraide
systems (sec 9) has been largely
concerned with the development of
techniques for purifying and preparing
enriched ARE fuel and fuel carrier
The fluoride treatment procedure
1involves successive purging of the
liquid with HF, H,, HF, and finally
He. The treated fuel then contains
only traces of HF, NiF,, and FeF,,
which are primary factors i1n fluorade
corrosion The beneficial effect on
the corrosion of the reducing agents
has been substantiated, and the
quantity of the various reductants
that may be tolerated 1n the fuel
has been defined. The consequences
of the attendant reduction of some UF,
to UF,; are being investigated. For
the longer-range fuel development
program, several ternary and quaternary
fluoride systems containing LiF are
being 1nvestigated, as well as some
binary chloride mixtures containing
ucl,

The corrosion rksearch (sec. 10)
has been primarilyon the determination
of the corrosion characteristics of
fluoride mixtures. The 1ncreased
attack experlenced 1n recent tests
with the ARE fuel mixture 1s believed
to be due to faulty purification
rather than to handling techniques
Zirconium hydride as an additive to
the fuel mixture reduces the fluoraide
attack on Inconel by a factor of 2
Apparently the mechanism 1s the
reduction of the metallic fluorides
Ni1F, and FeF;, which are present 1in
the fuel, because addition of these
fluorides to the fuel i1ncreases the
corrosion. Measurements of the concen-
tration of NiF,, FeF,, and CrF, as a
function of exposure time of Inconel
in the fuel have been made as an
index of corrosaion The nickel
content remains approximately constant
and the 1ron content drops sharply to

a constant value, however, the chromium

AND SUMMARY

content rises during the first 100 hr
and then levels off After the
addition of ZrH,, the only significant
change 1n these concentrations was 1n
the chromium content, which then
changed 1n the same manner as the 1ron
content. The addition of chromium
metal was not effective in inhibiting
fluoride corrosion, apparently because
of the low solubilaty of chromium 1n
the fluoride Although Inconel and
stainless steel are severely attacked
by lead 1n tests 1in convection loops,
molybdenum and columbium are relatively
1mmune However, static tests of
lead-sodium alloys show that sodium
additions decrease the otherwise
severely corrosive action of the lead
on both Inconel and stainless steel

The stability of BeO 1n NaK 1s staill
being investigated. It appears that
there 1s some solubility of BeO 1in NaK

The metallurgy and ceramics research
(sec 11) includes the fabrication of
various reactor components for use at
high temperatures, creep rupture tests
of structural metals, the development
of special alloys, cermets, and ceramic
coatings, and tests of welding and
brazing alloys Control or safety rod
inserts are being prepared for the
G-E reactor and for the Tower Shielding
Facilaity Chrome-plated, high-
conductivity fins have not proved
adequate for high-temperature radiator
use, but Inconel or stainless-steel-clad
copper fins may now be satisfactorily
brazed. Recent creep tests of stain-
less steel and Inconel have shown that
surface oxidationis not the controllang
factor i1n the longer rupture times
observed 1n air as compared with the
rupture times 1n hydrogen and argon
The cone-arc welding technique 1s
being adapted to the welding of
dished headers for heat exchangers
because of the unequal arc distances
encountered. Because of dilution and
embrittlement of the Nicrobraz used 1in

105
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

brazing a heat exchanger element
other alloys have been considered for
this application. The evaluation of
high-temperature alloys with respect
to temperature, strength, and corrosion
resistance 1s continuing

The physical property measurements
were made primarily for the determi-
nation of various properties of
several fluoride mixtures, and the
heat transfer studies were concerned
with experimental systems, as well as
aircraft components (sec. 12). The
heat capacity of the ARE fuel was
found to be 0 31 cal/g*°C from 550 to
850°C. Vapor pressure measurements of
the enriched fuel mixture were lower
than expected and i1ndicated the
formation of complex 10ons at high
temperatures. Preliminary measurements
were made of both the thermal conduc-
tivity and the viscosity of sodium
hydroxide at elevated temperatures.
A minimum-weilght analysiswas completed
for an aircraft radiator with the
optimum fin spacing and thickness and
the optimum tube spacing and diameter
Experimental apparatus to determine
the fluid velocity profiles and the
fluid temperature structure 1s being
assembled One study 1s under way to
determine temperature distrabution 1n
entrance regions, whereas another
study will compare the various high-
temperature heat transfer fluids.

Creepunder 1rradiation and corrosion
by sodium 1n an in-reactor loop are

106

being investigated, however, 1irradiation
of fluoride mixtures comprises the
greater part of the radiation damage
studies (sec 13) In recent 1r-
radiations of the ARE fuel mixture 1in
the MTR, i1n which the power generation
1s 20 times that expected in the ARE,
corrosion and changes 1n the fuel
composition occurred that were 1n
excess of those observed 1n control
tests. However, the Inconel and the
fuel were at temperatures 1n €Xcess
of 1500°F during the tests The
recent in-reactor creep measurements
confirmed previous conclusions that
irradiation had little effect on the
creep strength

studies of reactor
materials (sec 14) included chemical,
petrographic, and x-ray diffraction
1dentification of impurities, corrosion
products, reduction products, and
constituents of reactor fuels Volu-
metric methods for the determination
of zirconium 1n the presence of
uranium and for the simultaneous
determination of uranium trifluoraide
and zirconiummetal have been developed.
An apparatus has been built to aid in
the determination of traces of oxides
1n fluorades With petrographic and
x-ray-diffraction studies, 1t has been
possible to determine and define
compositions of the compounds and
eutectics present ain UCl, -NaCl,
UC1,-KCl, and NaF-ZrF,-UF, systems.

9. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

The major effort of the ANP Chemistry
group continues to be devoted to the
study of fluoride mixtures for use
as aircraft reactor fuels and coolants.,
A large fraction of this effort has
been devoted to the specific materials
that comprise the fuel solvent, the
concentrated fuel, and the final fuel
mixture for the ARE.

The final processing plans for
preparation of the fluoride mixtures
1n pure form are nearly finished
Progggsires for removing all except
traces of HF, N1F, and FeF, from these
materials are i1n the final develop-
mental stages. Contrary to previous
beliefs, hydrogen does cause partial
reduction of UF, to UF; 1n these melts
at 800°C. The beneficial effect of
reducing agents on the corrosion of
fluoride mixtures has been well sub-
stantiated, and the quantities of
various reductants thatmay be tolerated
1n the fuels has been defined.

Phase equilibrium and other studies
of systems 1n which all or part of the
UF, has been replaced by UF; are still
being carried out as a part of the
study of the effect of added reducing
agents and as an aid 1n the 1dentifi-
cation of corrosion products Adda -
tional materials have been synthesized
that contain trivalent uranium and
seem to be 1dentical with species
produced during corrosion. In the
hope of developing other and superior
fuel mixtures for future applacations,
an extensive study of phase equilibraia
1n systems containing lithium fluoride
1s being carried out. Some study of
UCl, systems 1s also 1n progress

L1F-ZrF,-UF,. The L1F-ZrF, -UF,
system was investigated with UF, con-

centrations of up to 45 mole % and
ZrF, concentrations of up to 50 mole
%. The lowest melting point observed
was 440°C for the mixture containing
68.5 mole % L1F, 26.5 mole % UF,, and
2.0 mole % ZrF,. Thermal halts were
noted with this composition, as well
as with other compositions nearly the
same, at about 400 to 415°C, however,
1t cannot be ascertained definitely
from the data that have been obtained
whether this effect 1s due to a
eutectic of unknown composition or to
a solid transition

KF-LiF-BeF,-UF,. The effect on the
melting point of varying the UF, con-
centration of one composition 1n the
KF-Li1F-BeF, -UF, system has been
determined. The data show that when
UF, 1s added to the 40% BeF,, 20% KF,
and 20% LiF mixture the mel ting point
goes through a minimum at a low con-
centrationof UF, and then rises rather
rapidly wath increasing UF, concen-
tration. The thermal effect noted at
330 to 340°C may indicate the existence
of a low-melting-point eutectic 1n
the four-component system, a great
deal of work will be required to

determine the composition of the
eutectic. The lowest melting tempera-

ture observed to date 1s 380°C at
2.5 mole % of UF,.

would be comparable to the diagram for

Synthesis of UCl, by liquid-phase

ene{3) has been used to provide
material for recent studies. Although
analytical data from which to evaluate
this material are not yet available,
1t appears that the material 1s not
of good quality The data reported
briefly below may therefore be revised
when purer UCl, becomes available.
NaCl-UCl,. Thermal data on 18 com-
positions i1n the NaCl-UCl, system have
been reported by Kraus.?4) He con-
cluded, on the basis of the data
obtained from cooling curves, that
the compound 2NaCl-UCl, was the only
compound formed 1n this system and
that 1t melted 1ncongruently at
430 £+ 5°C. It also appeared from
hi1s data that there was only one eu-
tectic, which melted at 370 * 5°C. The
present,lncomplete investigation seems
to show the existence of two eutectics
and two compounds 1in this system. The
first eutecticis believed to be at about
30 mole % UCl,, and 1t appears to
melt at 420 %+ 10°C. One of the
compounds, Na,UCl,, 1s believed to
melt congruently at 440 * 10°C. The
second eutectic 1s believed to be
at approximately 45 mole % UCl,, and
1t appears to melt at 370°C, 1n good
agreement with Kraus’' results. In
the 65 to 90 mole % UCl, range, a
series of breaks at 420 + 10°C probably
represents the i1ncongruent melting
point of a compound such as NaU,Cl,
or NaU,Cl,, The pure compound has
not yet been prepared, and 1t cannot
be definitely 1dentified on the basais
of information available at this time.

data showed that there was one com-
pound, K,UCl ., which mel ted congruently
at 650 + 5°C, and two eutectics 1in the
system. The KC1-K,UCl, eutectic was
stated to be at 25 mole % UCl,, and
1tsmelting point was given as 5601 5°C,
the K,UC1 ,-UCl, eutectic was 1ndicated
to be at 53 mole % UCl,, and 1ts
melting point was 350 + 5°C. Thermal
data and petrographic examination of
the soli1d phases show strong evidence
for the existence of three compounds
and three eutectics 1n this system.
The present results are in fair agree-
ment with those of Kraus on the
location and melting point of the
KC1-K,UCl, eutectic, the melting point
of K,UCl,, and the melting point of
the higher eutectic. However, 1t
appears that a K,UCl,-KUCl, eutectic
with 42.5 £+ 2 5 mole % UCl, occurs 1n
this system and that 1t melts at
320 £ 10°C The compound KUCI,
probably melts congruently, but a
reliable value for 1ts melting point
has not yet been obtained. The thermal
evidence for the existence of a com-
pound with more than 1 mole % UCIL,
per mole of KCl 1s a series of breaks
1in the 70 to 85 mole % UCl, region at
400 + 5°C. The thermal effect at thas
temperaturemay indicate the 1incongruent
mel ting point of this compound of
unknown composition. As mentioned 1n
the section on NaCl-UCl,, and 1in line
with experience with fluoride systems,
1t has been found rather difficult to
prepare incongruently mel ting compounds
in sufficiently pure state to permit
their positive 1dentification. The
composition of the KUCl.-KU Cl, .,
eutectic has not been accurately
determined.

the laboratory air. Petrographic
examination 1s accomplished by grinding
the material ina dry, inert atmosphere

ADDITION OF REDUCING AGENTS TO ARE FUEL

J D. Redman V. S. Coleman

Materials Chemistry Division

Decreased corrosion of Inconel 1in
thermal convection loops has been
demonstrated to result from small
additions of NaK, ZrH,, or Zr° to
fluoride mixtures of i1nterest as ARE
fuels., When these reducing agents
are added 1n large quantities to
materials containing UF,, they produce
UF,, which 1s only sparingly soluble
in the melt at 600°C. Therefore the
reactions of possible ARE fuels with
various reducing agents have been
studied i1n an effort to discover a
safe upper limit to the amount of such
additives.

Previous experiments had demon-
strated that addition of sufficient
reductant resulted i1n separation of
UF, as a discrete phase, which could
be removed by filtration at 600°C.
The resulting filtrates revealed no
trace of the easily detectable UF,
after solidification, but they showed
considerable quantities of various

110

complex compounds of UF,. Identical
mixtures (with the same reducing
agents) that were not filtered showed
considerable quantities of UF,. If
a sufficiently small quantity of
reducing agent was added so that no
UF, could be filtered at 600°C, there
was no UF, detected in the cool,
solidified material

Various ZrkF,-bearing mixtures, with
and without added UF,, have been
equilibrated with predetermined small
quantities of NaK (78 wt % K), ZrH,,
and Zr° 1n sealed capsules of Inconel
by rocking for 16 hr at 4 cpm with the
ends of the capsules at 800 and 650°C,
respectively. The capsules were then
heated at 800°C 1n a vertical position
for 2 to 6 hr to permit settlaing of
insoluble material and, especially,
unreacted reducing agent., Cooled
samples were sectioned longitudinally
for petrographic examination.

The upper tolerance laimits an
number of equivalents (one equivalent
1s the quantaity of reductant needed
to reduce all UF, to UF,) are listed
in Table 9.1.

Reducing agents added to NaZrF; 1in
amounts 1n excess of 0.2 wt % showed
opaque nonmagnetic masses, and chemical
and x-ray tests indicated the materaial
to be, at least in part, Zr°. Appar-
ently, trivalent zirconium does not
exi1st 1n fluoride melts under these
clrcumstances.

Verificationof the tolerance values
for ZrH, 1n the ARE fuel mixture has
been obtained by equilibration of ZrH,
with the fuel mixture at 800°C 1n
nickel equipment, followed by equila-
bration at 600°C and filtration of the
resulting melt at 600°C through
sintered nickel. The data obtained
by chemical analysis of the filtrate
and by petrographic examination of the
filtered residue are shown in Table 9.2,

The data indicate that no solad
materi1al exists i1n the liquid at
600°C 1f less than 0.9 wt % ZrH, as
added to the mixture. Agreement
between the data shown 1s probably
within the error of such experiments.
The failure to observe UF,, as such,
in any of the filtrates affords con-
firmation of the assumptions used to
interpret the previous data.

When small quantities (up to about
0.4 eq) of reducing agent are added,
an olive-drab phase (average refractave
index of 1.558) occursin the NaF-ZrF, -
UF, mixtures.

Reducing agents added to compo-
sitions 1n the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system
produced an olive-drab phase (average

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

refractive 1ndex of 1.558) at the
0 2-eq concentration. The quantaty of
olive-drab phase generally increased
upon addition of 0.4 eq of reducang
agent, With larger additions of
reducing agent, a decrease 1n the
olive-drab phase was observed, along
with an 1ncrease inthe red-orange phase
(UF,-2ZrF,). Synthesis and petro-
graphic examination have i1ndicated
that the olive-drab phase may be
UF3-2ZrF4, in which tetravalent uranium

examinations revealed that UF,-UF,-
4ZrF, was an olive-drab, pleochroic
phase, with an average refractive
1index of 1.564, a birefringence of
about 0.008, and an optic angle of
80 degrees. Another olive-drab
material (refractive index of 1.574)
was obtained when these materials
were mixed to correspond to UF,-3UF,-
8ZrF,. A mixture corresponding to
3UF,-UF,-8ZrF, produced striated
crystals of olive-drab and red-orange
materials.

The 50 mole % NaF composition
developed free UF, upon addition of
1.2 eq of Zr° or ZrH,. The 46 mole %
NaF composition formed free UF; upon
the addition of 1.6 eq Zr° or ZrH,.
The usual olive-drab and orange-red
phases were observed 1n these com-
positions with less than 1.2 eq of
reductants.

It was noted throughout this study
that the 46 mole % NaF, 50 mole %
ZrF,, 4 mole % UF, composition toler-
ated slightly more reduction without
precipitating UF, than did the 50
mole % NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,, 4 mole %
UF, composition. Further, 1t was
noted that both compositions are more
tolerant to Zr° and ZrH, than to NaK.
These observations support the mecha-
nism suggested previously, (%) which
postulates that NaF and UF, compete
for the ZrF, present. The Na(K)F
formed by the NaK reduction reaction
1s capable of breaking the UF,:2ZrF,
complex to form Na(K)ZrF, and free
UF,. On the other hand, ZrF4 formed
by the Zr° or ZrH, reduction reaction
1s capable of complexing more UF,.
This suggests that a fluoride com-
position with a ZrF,-to-NaF ratuio
larger than unity would be desirable
1f only because of 1ts capacity to
complex UF,.

COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

LiF-ZrF,. Study of the LiF-ZrF,
system, mentioned 1n the previous
progress report,(s) has been continued
by thermal analysis andbypetrographic
and x-ray-diffraction examination of
solidified melts. Although Li,ZrF  1s
the only compound that has been
positively 1dentified, there 1s some
evidence for one additional compound
with less than 33 mole % ZrF, and one
with more than 50 mole % ZrF,.

CsF-7ZrF,. Both Cs,ZrF, and CsZrF,
have been 1dentified by petrographic
examination of melts in the CsF-ZrF,
system, and three eutectics have been
shown to exist., The lowest-melting-
point (412 * 10°C) eutectic contains
about 40 mole % ZrF,. Further work 1is
1n progress to complete the equi-
librium diagram for the system.

KF-L1F-ZrF,. The KF-LiF-ZrF, system
has been examined over a ZrF, concen-
tration range of 5 to 60 mole %. A
ternary eutectic melting at about
385°C appears close to the KF-ZrF,
eutectic. The exact composition of
this eutectic has not yet been estab-
lished.

RbF-L1F-ZrF, Melting-point deter-
minations have been made for com-
positions in the RbF-LiF-ZrF, system
that have 5 to 60 mole % ZrF,. The
results were similar to those obtained
with KF-LiF-ZrF, mixtures. The lowest
melting point shown to date was 370°C
for amixture containing 45 mole % RbF,
45 mole % ZrF4, and 10 mole % La1F,
this composition 1s probably close to
a ternary eutectic. Thermal effects
at about 550°C were observed with a
number of compositions i1n this region.
These effects are believed tobe due
to the presence in the fused mixture
of complex oxyfluorides that may
result from the hygroscopic nature of

the RbF.

KF-LiF-BeF,. The data obtained
thus far with compositions 1n the 4 to
57 mole % BeF, range of the KF-LiF-BeF,
system seem to indicate that only
slight loweraing of the melting point
results from the addition of KF to
LiF-BeF, mixtures. The lowest melting
point that has been confirmed by both
heating and cooling curves 1s 350°C
for the mixture with 54 mole % BeF,,
10 mole % KF, and 36 mole % LiF, and
1t 1s only slightly lower than the
melting point (365°C) of the 50 mole %
L1F, 50 mole % BeF, composition.

PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION
OF FLUORIDE MIXTURES

F. F. Blankenship G. J. Nessle
Materials Chemistry Division
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

Study of the hydrogenation-hydro-
fluorination procedure previously
described¢’) for fuel preparation has
been continued on laboratory and pilot
scales. Operating conditions to
provide optimum purity of the molten
mixtures are now reasonably well
defined.

Construction of the production-
scale equipment for producing 3000 1ib
of ARE fuel solvent (NaZrF.) has been
delayed to some extent by lack of
manpower. This equipment should be
avallable for testing early in Aprail,
and the material should be prepared
during May and June. All raw materials
for this operation have been received,
and chemical and spectrographic
analyses of each batch indicate that
the materials are of satisfactory
purlity.

Corrosion by selective removal of
chromium from Inconel i1n fluoraide
melts may occur by any combination
of several mechanisms. Three of the

(TYF F Blankemship and G J Nessle, ANP

most likely of these processes are

Cr® + 3UF, < CrF, + 3UF; , (1)

2C:° + 3HF < 2CrF, + 3H, , (2)
and

2Cr° + 3N1F, < 3N1° + 2CrF,

2Cr® + 3FeF, < 3Fe® + 2CrF, ,  (3)

Cr® + FeF, < Fe° + CrF,

Addition of the strong reducing agent
ZrH, would be expected to minimize
the corrosion, regardless of whaich
mechanism was effectave.

Corrosion by the first mechanism
can be minimized by reduction of UF
to UF, by some reductant such as ZrH,
to the extent tolerable without
excessive deterioration of the physical
properties of the fuel. Corrosion by
the other mechanisms can, 1nprancaiple,
be eliminated by the proper techniques
for removing the reagent materials.

The hydrogenation-hydrofluorination
process for fuel purification was
originally chosen as the one most
likely to produce very pure fluoraide
liquids. The schedule for this process
was prescribed to provide what was
considered to be large excesses of
time for reaction and stripping at
each stage. In recent experiments,
attempts were made to quantitatively
evaluate the chemical changes during
each process stage. The need for such
data 1s obvious. Incomplete treatment
at any stage 1s reflected by poor
corrosion characteristics, however,
long treatment times are uneconomical
1n terms of equipment laife, production
rate, material consumed, and manpower
required and, in addition, result in
slight alteration in fuel composition
because of volatilization of the ZrF,.

Stripping with 1nert gas should
serve as a rapid and reasonably com-
plete method for removing HF, because
the acid fluorides are unstable at
temperatures above 500°C. Since any
residual HF should lead to enhanced
corrosion, the progress of HF removal

113
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

has been studied i1ntensively by
analyzing the exit gas stream for HF.

Initial experiments revealed that
plots of the logarithm of HF concen-
tration in the helium vs. volume of
helium passed were essentially linear,
with half-life volumes between 40 and
70 liters when 0.5 to 1.2 liters/main
of helium was passed through about 1
liter (3 kg) of the melt. From tests
of the stripping of the HF by He, 1t
may be concluded that typical batches
of fuel prepared by the standard
procedure described previously should
have been stripped to about 10°% mole
of HF per liter of He and should have
contained about 10 ppm of HF in the
melt, There 1s no detectable difference
in stripping rate with He between the
NaZrF, and the NaF-ZrF,-UF, mixture
containing 4 mole % UF,. The effect
of flow rate on attainment of equi-
librium vapor concentration has been
only partly explored.

When hydrogen 1s used to sweep the
melt after passage of HF, the acid
content of the effluent gas 1s con-
siderably higher than when helium 1s
used. The following reactions are
almost certainly responsible

NaF, + H, = Na° + 2HF, AF° 000k = —65 keal ,
2FeF -+ H, — 2FeF, * 2HF, AF° | 0% = =31 5 keal ,
FeF, + H, ~ Fe® + 2HF, AF° 000% = 1 5 kecal ,

2UF, + H, = 2UF; + 2HF, AF®;,00%g = 22 O keal .

In treatment of NaZrF, with hydrogen
at 800°C half-li1fe volumes of about
70 liters are found. Since most of
these experiments are performed 1in
nickel containers, appreciable amounts
the HF result from reduction of NiF,.

In stripping of the ARE fuel mixture
with H,, the contrast between He and
H, 1s even more noticeable. When H,
1s used, the HF content of the gas
drops sharply, as expected, but 1t
levels off at about 10°*% mole HF per
liter of H,. The reduction of UF, to
UF; 1n the solid state 1s considered
negligible below 900°C. However, UF,

114

has been shown by petrographic tech-
niques to be present in ARE fuel
batches after prolonged H2 treatment
at 700 to 800°C. There seems to be
no doubt that the high values for
HF i1n the exit gas are a consequence
of this reaction. From the rate of
HF evolution, 1t appears that the rate
of reduction 1s about 3% of the UF,
present per hour.

Filtration of the melt after
hydrogen treatment and HF stripping
serves to reduce the nickel content
of the fuel batch to less than 150
ppm. It has not been possible, to
date, to bring the i1ron content of
the melt to such a low level. It
appears, however, that low values for
N1F2, FeF,, and HF can be achieved
without excessive exposure times and
without undue reduction of the UF,.

Pilot-Scale Fuel Purification (G.
J. Nessle, J. E. Eorgan, Materials
Chemistry Division). During the past
quarter, a total of 326.4 kg of mixed
fluorides, comprising 24 small batches
of approximately2 kg each and 11 large
batches of approximately 25 kg each,
has been processed by the group in
Building 9928 and dispensed to re-
questing personnel in the ANP Division.
Heating the control panels to 125°F
has resulted 1n marked improvement 1in
the smoothness and efficiency of
operation. The addition of two
pressure gages, one directly on the
reactor can and one directly on the
receiver can, has eliminated the
difficulty i1n discovering possible
danger points, and minor failures
during a run are now practically
nonexistent,

The process for treatment of mixed
fluorides has been modified to permit
1.5 hr of stripping with H, and 1.5 hr
of stripping with He after the HF
treatment and before transfer of the
molten fluorides. A gas throughput of
about 15 liters/min 1s accomplished
by pressurizing to 10 lb (gage) and
releasing to 0 1lb (gage) 30 times per
hour. The HF content of the straip

 
gas 1s usually about 10”% mole/later
at the time of fuel transfer. Thais
probably corresponds to about 10 ppm
of HF 1n the melt. The combaination
of H, treatment and filtration through
sintered nickel has reduced the soluble
nickel 1n the melt from 900 to less
than 150 ppm.

Fluoride Production Facility (G. J.
Nessle, Materials Chemistry Division,
H. W. Savage, ANP Division). The
production facility for preparing 1in
excess of 3000 1lb of fuel solvent 1is
scheduled for completion during the
month of March. Shakedown runs and
other preliminary tests of the appara-~
tus should require less than four
weeks, the production operation could,
1f necessary, be finished by mid-June.

The low-hafnium ZrCl, has been con-
verted to ZrF,, and the equipment for
this process has been cleaned and put
into standby condition for future
use, 1f needed. At present, the
stockpile contains 3000 1b of ZrF,.

All batches of the ZrF, have been
sampled and analyzed by chemical
met hods for zirconium and fluoraine.
Complete spectrographic analyses,
with special shots of each batch,
for hafnium and boron are available.
The boron content of the batches
ranges from 1.8 to 0.3 ppm, with an
average of 0.8 ppm, and seven of the
nine batches show less than 85 ppm
hafnium. The other two batches,
comprising about 25% of the total,
show 150 and 550 ppm hafnium.

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

About 1000 1b of NaF from one
production lot has been stockpiled
for use 1n fuel production. Chemical
and spectrographic examinations of
samples from three containers indicate
that the material 1s satisfactory for

use
Hydrofluorination of Zroz-NaF

Mixtures (R. E. Thoma, Jr., C. M.
Blood, Materials Chemistry Division).
The feasibility of producing NaZrF,
by a short treatment of NaF-ZrQO,
mixture with HF at a high temperature
has been demonstrated. Best results
are obtained when some previously
prepared NaZrF; 1s added to the charge
so that a liquid phase 1s present
during the 1nitial stages. An amount
of NaZrF¢ that 1s equivalent to 10% of
the total charge appears to be suffa-
cient to bring about complete con-
version of the mixture 1in 4 hr at
800°C. Utilization of about 30% of the
HF delivered has been attained.

There are still some problems in
connection with the equipment for thas
operation. Frequent rupture of the
HF input line occurred when nickel
tubing was used. Metallographic
examination revealed that the attack
was due to sulfur, which was probably
present in the Zr0O, feed. Graphaite
liners 1n the nickel reactors have
been used satisfactorily, however,
there has been difficulty in the use
of graphite dip lines for HF because
of breakage during runs.

Further study of this procedure,
which promises to reduce materially
the cost of ZrF, as NaZrF,, 1s planned.

CORROSION RESEARCH

W. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division
W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemaistry Division
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

Corrosion phenomena are usually
examined first 1n static or seesaw
tests, and then selected systems or
phenomena are examined 1n the convection
loops. Crevice corrosion, effect of
exposure time, and the effects of
additives have been studied in both
static and dynamic tests during the
past quarter No significant increase
1in corrosion was noted ain static
tests However, the crevice corrosion
found 1n thermal convection loops
was about three times that found 1n
adjacent tubing, the mechanism by
which crevices 1ncrease corrosion
1s not yet understood. Corrosion, as
evidenced by the chromium metal content
of the fluoride, has been shown to be
fairly constant after the first 100 hr
of exposure Convection loops that
were run for 1000hr at 1500°F 1indicated
that the amount of corrosion decreased
with time, although there was a small
increase 1n the depth and intensaty
of attack.

The work on the dynamic testing of
the fluoride fuels 1n Inconel thermal
convection loops has continued, with a
major effort being made to determine
why the corrosion 1n the
fluoride systems has been 1increasing.
It has been shown that neither the
increase i1n fluoride batch size nor
poor handling techniques during
filling were responsible, retreating
the fuel batches has produced contra-
dictory results. Evidence indicates
that the 1ncrease 1n corrosion 1s
being caused by faulty purification,
since the corrosion was deeper 1n
loops 1n which hydrofluorinated
fluoride mixtures were circulated
than 1t was 1n the loops that used
as-melted fluoride as the fuel. One
Inconel thermal convection loop was

Inconel -

operated with a hot-leg temperature of
1650°F, and no large increase 1in the
depth of attack was noted 1n comparison
with that found 1n loops run at
1500°F A whairlagig rig, patterned
after one developed by NACA, with
which fluoride flow velocities of
10 fps can be obtained, has been
placed 1n operation. Preliminary
testswith this apparatus with fluoride
fuels 1n Inconel show only a slight
1ncrease 1n corrosive attack compared
with that found 1n static capsule
tests. It was confirmed that ZrH, 1s
an effective corrosion inhibitor when
used with NaF-ZrF, -UF, (46-50-4 mole %),
TiH, will also inhibit corrosion, but
not quite so effectively as ZrH,.
It now appears that the solubilaty of
chromium in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1 1 mole %) 1s about 3000 ppm,
which 1s not so high as originally
expected Considerable attack was
found 1n an Inconel loop 1n which the
fluoride had been saturated with
chromium metal prior to circulation.

The compatibility of BeO in Nak
continues to be examined, and a
correlation between the density of
the BeO and the corrosion behavior 1s
being studied Various surface
treatments for the BeO are being
evaluated. There 1s some evidence
that BeO 1s soluble 1n NaK to an
extent that 1s dependent on the
temperature of the system The
corrosion of two cermets was examined
1n both fluorides and liquid metals.
Al though the tests 1n liquid metals
showed little or no attack, at least
one fluoride test resulted i1n signifi-
cant corrosion

si1stance to mass transfer and corrosion
in liquid lead On the other hand,
severe corrosion and mass transfer
were found i1n lead-Inconel systems,
even thoughthe lead had been carefully
deox1d1zed Materials to be tested
in liquid lead include type 304, high
and low carbon, stainless steels,
type 410 stainless steel, and Armco
1iron. Tests of stainless steel and
Inconel 1n sodium-lead alloys continue
to show that additions of sodium to
lead decrease the severe corrosive
action.

The effect of a hydrogen atmosphere
in minimizing mass transfer of nickel
1n sodium hydroxide was demonstrated
by using a 50-50 mixture of helium and

hydrogen However, the use of atmos-
pheres of CO,, forming gas, wet
hydrogen, or dry air under a hydrogen

pressure of one-half atmospheric
pressure resulted 1n considerable mass
transfer.

A number of simple and complex
fluorides of the structural metal has
been prepared for studies of thear
effect on corrosion by fluorade
mixtures The complex fluoraides
formed 1n corrosion tests are 1dentified
by either petrographic or x-ray-
diffraction techniques,or both The
oxidation of molten NaUF, yielded no
Uuo,Fr,, UO,, or UF,. However, 1t 1s
evident from the resulting products
that the container plays an important
part in the mechanism of air oxidation
of uranium 1n the molten fluorides.

Crevice Corrosion. In connection
with the crevice corrosion tests

being run, 1t was suggested that a
more realistic method of testing
would employ a tapered or V-shaped
crevice 1n the bottom of the testing
tube Accordingly, a jig was designed
for putting tapered crimps 1n test
tubing With this jig, crevices can
be made that are approximately 1 1/4
in long and vary 1in width up to
approximately 0 3 inch. Several
static tests with various materials
for containing the NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) have been rumn to
test the crevices Corrosion in the
crevices seemedto be somewhat errataic,
with some surfaces being apparently
unattacked and others havaing the
usual subsurface voids However,
accelerated corrosionain these crevices
was not noted, the attack that was
found 1n the crevices was not beyond
what might be expected for the materials
tested.

High-Temperature Pretreatment of
Inconel. On the basis of results
from some previous tests with NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10 9-43 5-44 5-1 1 mole %)
at high temperatures (1200 to 1300°C),
1t was reported that there was no
surface layer attack on Inconel.
It was thought that perhaps a pre-
treatment at high temperature would
render Inconel i1mmune from corrosion
at the usual temperature of 816°C.
Accordingly, two Inconel tubes were
loaded with the fluoride, heated for
4 hr at 1250°C, and then heated for
250 hr at 816°C. Light attack was
noted 1n each tube i1n the form of
subsurface voids that extended to a
depth of 1 mil in one tube and 0.5 m1l
in the other tube.

Effect of Time of Exposure of
Inconel to Fluoride Mixture with and
Without ZrH, Added. When the ARE
fuel mixture NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4
mole %), without added material, 1s
tested 1n Inconel under an atmosphere
of helium, the severity of attack and
the depth of penetration seem to
1ncrease very slightly with exposure
times of between 100 and 250 hours.
Differences between corrosion observed
after 25 and 100 hr seem to be real.
A plot of the structural metal content
of the fluoride mixture vs. exposure
time 1s shown 1in Fig. 10.1. It 1s
obvious that the chromium content
shows a rapid i1nitial rise and then
tends to level off at a high value,
whereas the 1ron content falls rapidly
at first and then very slowly. It
seems certain that reactions such as

FeF; + Cr —— CrF; + Fe,

with consequent deposition of the
metallic 1ron on the walls, are
responsible fora part of the corrosion
observed.

When this fuel mixture, with
0 5 wt % ZrH, added, was tested in
Inconel, the corrosion obtained was
considerably less severe, but the
corrosion changes with exposure time

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

were similar. Figure 10 2 shows the
results of analysis of the fuel
mixture for the structural metals.
In this case, FeF; and N1F, contents
dropped to very low values because of
the strong reducing agent, and,
apparently, most of the CrF, was
also reduced. However, with increased
exposure time, the CrF; concentration
increased slightly.

These results are encouraging 1n
that they indicate that the relatively
large corrosion rates 1nitially
observed are drastically reduced at
longer exposure times

Structural Metal Fluoride Additives.
Chemical analyses of fluoride materials
before and after corrosion testing 1in
Inconel have repeatedly demonstrated
that the 1ron and nickel contents of
the mixture are reduced and the

are obviously involvedin the corrosion
mechanism, Since both 1ron and
nickel fluorides are likely to be
present to some extent i1n the final
ARE fuel and since considerable
amounts of these compounds have been
present 1n some of the batches tested,
a series of experiments has been
conducted to demonstrate the effects
of the fluorides of 1ron, chromium,
and nickel i1n considerable amounts on
the corrosion of Inconel by the ARE
fuel and the ARE fuel solvent.
Addition of either FeF, or NaF,
increases the severity of attack and
depth of penetration. The addition
of CrF, apparently has no effect on
the corrosion rate. When 1ron or
chromium fluorides are added, metallo-
graphic examination reveals metallic
deposits on the capsule walls,
Chemical analyses of the solidified
melts, after exposure, reveal that the

addition of CrF; does not appreciably
alter the amounts of i1ron and nickel
normally found i1n the mixture. The
addition of NiF,, however, greatly
increases the amount of CrF; found an
the melt, the very large quantities
of soluble nickel added are nearly
completely reduced and are apparently
deposited on the walls of the capsule
so that they are not removed with the
fluoride mass. The addition of FeF,
also serves to raise the chromium
content of the fluoride mixture, but
only a part of the FeF, seems to be
reduced to metal.

The handlaing, sampling, and ana
lytical techniques are not sufficiently
precise to permit obtaining accurate
material balances from the equations
shown above, i1n general, however, the
balance 1s within 220%, from which it
appears that a considerable fraction
of the corrosion 1s, as was expected,
due to other actions.

Hydrogen Fluoride Additive. Hydro-
fluoric acid 1s one of the reagents
used 1n the process for purifying
the fluoride melts. This reagent
may be present in the melts at low
concentrations, even though con-
siderable careis used i1n the stripping
operation.

Study of corrosion of Inconel by
a batch of ARE fuel, NaF-ZrF4-UF4
(50-46-4 mole %), to which HF had
been added as NaHF,, showed that
heavy subsurface void formation
resulted when as much as 0.3 wt % HF
was present. This attack was shown
to be as much as 3 mils deep, whach
1s at least twice the depth expected
without addition. However, the use
of 0.1 wt % HF resulted i1n less severe
attack, with penetration to only
15 mls, and the addition of 0 04 wt %
HF yielded a light metallic deposit
and relatively light corrosive attack.

The fuel mixture used 1n these
experiments had been treated waith H,
and, presumably, contained small
amounts of UF;. It 1s possible that
the reaction

2UF, + 2HF =— 2UF, + H,

may have masked the deleterious
effect of small HF additions.

Fluoride Corrosion i1n a Rotating
Rig. The whairligig ri1g¢!’ 1s now
running and operational ‘‘bugs” are
gradually being worked out In thas
device 1t will be possible to run
relatively high-velocity corrosion
tests with the fluoride mixtures
contained 1n Inconel and other suitable
tubing. At the present time, a fluaid
velocity of approximately 10 fps 1s
being employed. Upon metallographac
examination after a 100-hr test waith
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %) 1n
Inconel at a temperature of 816°C
(no appreciable thermal gradient
employed), 1t was noted that the
attack was no more severe than that
often encountered 1n ordinary static
corrosion tests, The attack was
quite uniform and was in the form of
subsurface voids to a depth of 2 mils.

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

Chemical analysis of the fluoride
after the test revealed the presence
of 0.025% Fe, 0.003% N1, and 0.141% Cr.
Other tests are being run with various
additions to the fluoride mixtures,
and attempts are being made to vary
the heating arrangements on the tubing
so that sizeable temperature gradients
can be attained.

Static Tests on Incoloy and Inconel
1n Fluorides. Incoloy (32 % N1-21%
Cr-47% Fe) was tested in NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) for 100 hr at 816°C.
In a few places, subsurface voids to
a depth of 2 mils could be noted. A
photomicrograph of the Incoloy,
taken after testing, 1s shown 1in
Fig. 10.3.

The descaling properties of the
fluoride on oxidized Inconel were
tested at 816°C, and 1t was found that
the oxidized Inconel was cleaned very
well at the 1-, 4-, and 8-hr test
times that were tried.

Effect of Fluoride Batch Size.
As discussed 1n the previous report, ( 2)
the corrosion has been i1ncreasing 1in
the Inconel loops circulating NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %). The
increases 1n themselves were not
enough to cause trouble, but they are
dangerous when regarded as a trend
that 1s not understood. Consequently,
a series of loops was run to determine
whether the 1ncrease in batch size 1n
the production of the fluoride mixture
was responsible for the corrosion
increase. Loops were run with fluoride
mixtures prepared in 5- and 50-1b
batches for 100- and 500-hr periods.
In both the 100- and 500-hr tests,
more corrosion was caused by the small
batches than by the large batches.
Obviously, the i1ncrease in batch
si1ze was not the reason for the

increase in attack. Furthermore,
even though extreme care was taken
during filling of the loop, the
attack was stil]l extensive; therefore
poor handling during filling was
also eliminated as the cause.

Fluoride Pretreatment. Two small
batches of NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %) were taken from the 50-1b
batch and given a complete retreat-
ment.¢3®) When these batches were
circulated in Inconel loops, the
attack in one instance was considerably
greater than average, whereas in the
other it was less; therefore it may be
concluded that some major variable
still has not been controlled.

The attack found in Inconel loops
in which NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %)
circulated was much less than had
been found when NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-
43.5-44.5-1.1mole %) was the circulated
material.(*) Since the NaF-ZrF,-UF,
had received more extensive pre-
treatment with H, and HF, its higher
purity is a logical explanation for
its lower corrosiveness. Accordingly,
two special batches of the NaF-KF-LiF-
UF, mixture were given the same
special pretreatment. These batches
produced attack on Inconel that was
almost twice that heretofore observed.
Two additional batches of the same
fluoride were then specially prepared
and circulated in Inconel loops, and

the attack was even worse than 1in
the first test,

In all the tests with pretreated
fuel, the operator reported a strong
odor of hydrogen fluoride during the
filling of the loops. Since hydrogen
fluoride, as an additive 1in static
tests, has been shown to 1ncrease
corrosion, 1t 1s most probable that
the HF used at one step 1n the fuel
pretreatment, as well as the NaiF
produced during this treatment, 1is
not being completely removed and 1s
causing the increased corrosion,
These tests show that poor purifi-
cation may do more harm than good.

Hydride Additives It has been
confirmed that zirconium hydride wall
reduce the attack of NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) on Inconel. An
addition of 1/2% zirconium hydrade
1n one thermal convection loop reduced
the depth of attack to between 1 and
4 mils. This attack 1s lower than
normal but 1s deeper than that found
when zirconium hydride 1s added to
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1
mole %). The coolant underwent
considerable transformation, as
evidenced by the presence of a brown
material.

Titanium hydride (1/2%) was added
to the NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture and
circulated 1n Inconel. The maximum
penetration of 2 5 mils, although
much less than that found when no
additive was used, was not quite so
low as that obtained when zirconium
hydride was added. Surface layers
were found 1n both the hot and cold
legs These layers must receive
additional study 1f any hydride 1s
to be used as an inhibitor.

Metal Additives. The three most
common 1mpurities found in the fuel
are nickel, 1ron, and chromium. One
loop 1n which chromium metal powder
had been added to NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10.9-43,5-44.5-1.1 mole %) was
discussed 1n the previous report.(?)
This test was repeated, and again no
change 1n the average depth of attack

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

was found, no unusual layers were
found, and the chromium content of the
fluorides from the loop was normal,
so again the chromium metal did not go
into solution. Chromium metal powder,
in sufficient quantity to make 0.5%
in the solution, was then added to a
transfer pot before the fluorides
were placed anto 1t. After the
fluorides had been added, the pot was
kept hot and helium was blown through
1t for 30 minutes. Again, average
attack was found after this materaial
had been circulated i1n an Inconel
loop. The chemical analysis of thas
fluoride showed a chromium concen-
tration of 2500 ppm, which 1s about
twice the normal concentration,
Further work 1s scheduled to determine
whether the solubility of chromium 1is
much lower than-was expected. This 1s
likely, since the chromium content
did not 1ncrease greatly during
circulation and yet attack had taken
place

As another approachto this problemn,
a section of Inconel pipe was chromium
plated and welded 1nto the hot leg
of a loop. After the NaF-KF-LaF-UF,
mixture had been circulated, the depth
of attack was the same 1n adjacent
plated and unplated sections. No
traces of the chromium plate remained
on the walls. A metallic appearing
layer was found in the cold leg. The
chromium content of the fluorides
varied from 2500 to 3000 ppm, whach,
although higher than normal, 1s about
the same as that found in the loop
discussed above.

Temperature Dependence. A loop
filled with the fluoride fuel, NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %), was operated
for 500 hr with a minimum cold-leg
temperature of 1500°F and a hot-leg
temperature of 1650°F., The hot-leg
attack was moderate to light, with a
maximum depth of 11 mils and an
average depth of 8 mils. A concen-
trationof voids in the grain boundaries
had taken place. The results may be
compared with those of a similar

123
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

loop test in which the hot-leg temper-
ature was 1500°F The hot-leg attack
1n this loop was from 3 to 10 mails
deep. Comparison of these two loops
indicates that the corrosion mechanism
1snot extremely temperature sensitive.
One disturbing fact 1s that with the
hotter loop there was some evidence of
uranium segregation 1in the cold leg.
This 1s now being checked in another
loop.

Crevice Corrosion. Another loop
operated 1n the study of crevice
corrosion?) was an Inconel loop,
with two crevices built i1nto the hot
leg, 1n which NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4
mole %) was circulated. The upper
hot-leg section showed a maximum
attack of 16 mils and an average
attack of 12 mi1ls, whereas the attack
in the lower hot-leg section had a
maximum depth of 9 mils. The maximum
attack i1n the crevices was 19 mils
and the average was 12 mils. The
intensity of attack 1n the crevice
was several times that in the straight
section. This confirms previously
obtained results i1n that the attack
1n the crevice 1s only slaightly
deeper but the 1ntensity of attack
1s greatly increased.

Inserted Corrosion Samples. Me-
tallographic data received for the
previously discussed(?) loops 1n which
thermocouple tubes were i1nserted into
the center of the hot and the cold
legs confirm the results obtained
with flat samples. With both NaF-
ZrF,-UF, and NaF-KF-Li1F-.UF,, the
attack on the loop walls i1n the hot
leg was normal, but the hot-leg
inserts were attacked to a depth of
onlyl mil, no satisfactory explanation
has been offered for this phenomenon.

Effect of Exposure Time. An
Inconel loop was used to circulate
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) 1000 hr,
and the resulting hot-leg attack was
moderate to heavy in i1ntensity and
extended to depths of 5 to 11 mils.
The attack was present both as general
attack and as a concentration of the

124

voids 1n the grain boundaries For
comparative purposes, these data are
summarized i1n Table 10 1, along with
simi1lar data for loops previously
operated for 100 and 500 hours
Although the depth and intensity of
the attack i1ncreases with the exposure
time, the rate of attack definitely
decreases

Nonuranium Bearing Mixtures. Since
NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %) will be used
during the 1nitial testing of the
ARE, several loops have been operated
to study 1ts effects These are
standard loops, that 1s, Inconel
loops operated for 500 hr with a
hot-leg temperature of 1500°F. The
upper section of the hot leg of one
loop showed light attack that extended
to depths of 4 to 8 mils,
the lower section was practically
unattacked The second loop 1s stall
operating. A third loop, 1n which
NaF-ZrF, (52-48 mole %) was circulated,
yielded scattered i1ntergranular attack
of from 3 to 8 mils 1n the top section
of the hot leg. The lower section
showed general pitting 1 mil deep,
with an occasional patch of pits up
to 6 mi1ls deep No deposit was found
in the cold leg

Zirconium hydride (1/2%) was added
to another batch of this coolant,
which was then subject to the standard
loop test The hot-leg surface of
this loop was pitted, but the attack,
as shown by the subsurface voids,
extended to a maximum depth of only

whereas
1.5 mils. A two-phase laver 1 mil
thick was present on the hot-leg
surface, and a tightly adhering
metallic-appearing layer 0.1 mil
thick was found in the cold leg.
Again the zirconium hydride acted as
an inhibitor, but hot-leg deposits
were formed.

One Inconel loop circulated 500 hr
with NaF-BeF, (57-43 mole %). The
maximum hot-leg attack was 9 mils and
the average was 4 mils. More voids
were concentrated in the grain bounda-
ries than are normally found, and the
voids were larger. A nonmetallic
deposit was found i1n the cold leg.
With both NaF-ZrF, and NaF-BeF,, the
attack mechanism seems to be the same
as for the other fluorides.

in several of the tubes, crystals
could be detected in the bath material.

materials have been run with lithium
at 1000°C to furnish a basis of

been noted in the three-component
tests, 10 to 15 mils penetration
being quite common. It should be

recent tests were static tests and
the attack might be less severe than
in the dynamic systems. Results of

Corrosion by Lead 1n Thermal
Convection Loops. A series of tests
has been made to determine the extent
of mass transfer and corrosion 1n
thermal convection loops containing
liquid lead. The systems lead-Inconel,
lead-niobium, and lead-molybdenum
have been studied. Results are also
avallable for the lead-type 304
stainless steel system, but are
incomplete.

Since the results of previous
investigations of mass transfer and
corrosion 1n lead thermal convection
loops have been subject to criticism
because of oxide i1n the lead or on
the metal tubing, 1n the present
series of experiments, the liquid
lead was deoxidized with hydrogen
prior to contact with the test metal.
Care was also taken to avoid heavy
oxidation of the metal sections of
the loops. The apparatus and experi-
mental procedure were described 1in
the previous report. (5)

loop 1s virtually i1nsoluble 1n lead

tration of 310, 1n the lead after one

test was only 17 ppm, and the S10,
concentration 1n a lead sample that
had not been 1n contact with glass or
quartz was 15 ppm

Loop tests were run with Inconel,
columbium, molybdenum and type 304
stainless steel samples suspended 1n
the circulating lead The results for
Inconel have been reported previ-
ously, (%) the results for the other
metals are summarized 1n Table 10 4.

The columbium specimens exhibited
no mass transfer and virtually no
corrosion even after almost 600 hr
of loop operation. The small decrease
in wall thickness was probably due to
the solution of the small amount of
columbium required to saturate the
lead. No mass transfer occurred with
molybdenum, but the corrosion, although
slight, was a little greater than
that found for columbium. Little or
no intergranular penetration was
observed. The reason for the dis-
crepancy 1n the wall-thickness measure-
ments for the second lead-molybdenum
test 1s not known.

The molybdenum specimens used were
not actually sections of tubing but
were made of molybdenum foil bent into
a cylinder. The foil had a specified
thicknessof 10 mils, which was checked
by micrometer readlngs at two points
on the foi1l. It 1s possible that there
was a variation 1n thickness i1n the

The results of the test with
type 304 stainless steel are 1ncomplete.
On the basis of the thermal record of
the experiment, however, 1t appeared
that circulation 1n this loop was also
stopped by plug formation. The
type 304 stainless steel specimen
used had a carbon concentration of
0.087%.

In summary, both columbium and
molybdenum showed very good resistance
to mass transfer and corrosion ain
liquid lead. On the other hand,
severe corrosion and mass transfer
occurred 1n the lead-Inconel systems
despite the careful deoxidation of
the lead with hydrogen. The tests
have i1ncluded a nickel-base alloy
(Inconel), columbium, molybdenum, and
an i1ron-base alloy (type 304 stainless
steel). It 1s planned to extend the
study to other iron-base alloys, such
as type 410 stainless steel, to a
low-carbon type 304 stainless steel,
and to Armco 1iron.

Static Tests of the ARE-Be0 Blocks
in Na and NaK. Two tests have been
performed with ARE beryllium oxide
moderator blocks heated for several
hundred hours at 810°C in a type 347
stainless steel pot containing Na or
NaK. In the first test, the beryllium
oxide was immersed in 255 in.?® of

sodium for 213 hr at 816°C. Although
no crackingor spalling of the beryllium
oxide was noticeable immediately
after the test, the surface im-
perfections apparent in part a of
Fig. 10.8 occurred after the test
specimen had been soaked in alcohol
and water.

In the second test, the NaK was
transferred to the pot with the
beryllium oxide when both the NaK and
the beryllium oxide were at room
temperature. The test was run for
500 hr at 816°C with the beryllium
oxide immersed in 255 in.® of NaK.
After the test, the beryllium oxide
was badly cracked, as can be seen
in part b of Fig. 10.8. The weight
and dimensional changes noted for
both tests are given in Table 10.6.

Convection Loop testsof Be0 in Nak.
Eight specimens of BeO 1/4 by 1/4 by

1n the surge tank of a thermal con-
vection loop, and NaK was permitted
to flow over the specimens at a
velocity of about 8 fpm for 212 hours.
The temperature of the NaK was 1150°F
1in the cold leg and 1000°F ain the
hot leg, and the samples were 1n
contact with NaK at 1500°F. The NaK
specimens 1n the second test were
pretreated before exposure to the
hot NaK i1n the following manner-
specimens 1 and 2 received no special
pretreatment, specimens 3 and 4 were
treated with MgNO,, specimens 5 and 6
were 1mpregnated with AlF,; and CaF,,
specimens { and 8 were treated with

mens 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectaively, 1in

dynamic test systems. The weight
losses of the BeO blocks observed in
a number of 1nstances prompted a
search for the beryllium that had been
removed from the block. 1In those
tests for which the NaK was filtered
at room temperature, the beryllium
found 1n the filtrate corresponded to
approximately 3 ppm of Be(O, which was
a very small part of the total beryllium
removed from the blocks. Further
examination revealed that the be-
ryllium or the BeO, or both, was
located praimarily on the walls of the
containers to which 1t adhered tightly,
The question then arose as to‘'whether
or not the beryllium was removed from
the block and deposited on the wall
by some process involving solubilaty
of Be or BeO i1n the NaK at 800°C.

Two tests were performed to measure
the solubility i1n NaK at 800°C. 1In
the first test, BeO was contacted with
NaK at 800°C for 6 hr in the reaction-
filtrationrig previously described. ()
The NaK was filtered at approximately
800°C, and the filtrate was collected
in a nickel receiving tube. Based on
this single experiment, the solubility
of berylliumin NaKat 800°C corresponds
to roughly 100 ppm, but 12t 1s not
known whether the material dissolved

was Be or BeO.

In the second test, a stainless
steel thermal convection loop was
used to circulate NaK over BeO blocks
suspended in the surge tank After
212 hr of circulation at a flow rate
of 6 to 10 fpm, a weight loss of about
25% was measured for the BeO blocks

(original weight of 4 g). After the
NaK had been drained, the loop was
sectioned as shown in Fig. 10.9. The

operating temperatures of the loop
are given on the figure, along waith
the analytical results for the BeO
determinations on the respective
3 1/2-1n sections.

The analytical results show that
the three coldest (and lowest) sections
of the loop contained the greatest
concentrations of beryllium. Since
the analytical data showno accumulation
of BeO fragments 1n the coldest part
of the tank, 1t 1s suggested that a
dissolution process, governed by the
temperature gradient, 1s responsible
for the transfer of the materaial
from the BeO block to the walls of
the cold region.

Such a mechanism could be represented
by the following reaction

2NaK + 2Be0 == Na,0 + K,0 + 2Be ,

whaich, 1f the reaction proceeds
slightly to the right at 800°C and
the beryllium formed 1s soluble 1n
NaK, would account for removal of

EFFECT OF ATMOSPHERE ON THE MASS
TRANSFER OF NICKEL IN HYDROXIDES

H. J. Buttram C. R Croft
F Kertesz
Materials Chemistry Division

The 1inclined-tube technique previ-
ously described(’’ was used for further
study of the effect of various expera-
mental factors on the mass transfer of
nickel by hydroxides. With a tempera-
ture gradient of 150°C (800°C at the
bottom and 650°C at the top) under
helium atmosphere, sodium hydroxide
transported enough nickel to the
liquid level of the inclined nickel
tube to plugit completely in 48 hours.
As was previously mentioned, hydrogen
gas sweeping over the surface of the
molten hydroxide reduced the mass
transfer considerably, only polishing
of the hot end and roughening of the
cold endof the tube could be observed.
The temperature gradient was then
increased to 300°C (500°C at the top
and 800°C at the bottom), and a
hydrogen atmosphere was used. Similar
satisfactory®results were obtained,
the hydrogen largely suppressed any
crystal deposit at the liquid level.

Attempts were made to determaine
the minimum pressure at which mass
transfer 1s effectaively i1nhaibited by
hydrogen. A 50 vol % helium-50 vol %
hydrogen mixture over the hydroxide
gave satisfactory results. On the
other hand, with an absolute hydrogen
pressure of 38 cm Hg - established as
a manually adjusted vacuum - the
hydrogen system affordedno protection,
possibly because of the technique
employed.

A number of other atmospheres was
also applied over sodium hydroxide 1in
the 1nclined tube test. The use of

136

carbon monoxide and forming gas (10%
H, + 90% N,) did not have a beneficial
effect. Water in the hydrogen, even
in small quantities, resulted in
considerable mass transfer, Bubbling
the hydrogen through water at various
temperatures resulted in nickel
crystal deposits 1n amounts similar
to those obtained under a helium
atmosphere. A continuous vacuum over
the system (which would remove any
hydrogen formed during the test)
resulted 1n extremely heavy corrosion
and mass transfer, and left the
hydroxide with a nickel concentration
of up to 3% However, when the tube
was evacuated and sealed, the mass
transfer was much less severe. Dry
air was definitely less harmful than
wet hydrogen. The use of commercial
sodium hydroxide, which contains up

to 2% water, resulted in greatly
reduced mass transfer under dry
hydrogen. One effect of the dry

hydrogen may be to strip the water
from the hydroxide.

In addition to the tests with
sodium hydroxide, experiments were
made with sodium hydroxide-potassium
hydroxide eutectic, with pure potassium
hydroxide, and with lithium hydroxaide.
With none of these materials could
the i1inhibiting effect of hydrogen on
the mass transfer of nickel be ob-
tained, the reason for this 1s not
yet clear. More closely controlled
experiments are planned.

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

Identificationof Corrosion Products
from Convection Loops (D. C. Hoffman,
Materials Chemistry Division). Cooling
jets that impinged on the cold leg
of an Inconel thermal convection loop
in which the LiF-NaF-KF eutectic
containing 1.8 mole % of UF, was
circulating, produced partial plugs
which persisted after the cooling jets
were removed and could not be liquefied
at temperatures of up to 650°C. X-ray
analysis of the plugs showed the
presence of KF and some material that
gave a slightly shifted spectrum of
K,NaCrF, Petrographic investigation
substantiated the presence of this
compound and also revealed some bright
metal that was shown to be nonmagnetic,
Inspection under binoculars (45X)
showed a network of crystals, presumed
to be the K,NaCrF,, growing inward
from the tube walls.

The compound K,NaCrF, has a solu-
bility 1n the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic of
450 ppm Cr(III) and 2000 ppm Cr(III)
at 500 and 650°C, respectively. It
therefore appears probable that
K,NaCrF, has been responsible for
plugging in this loop, as well as
1n others, 1n which the amount of
metal transferred was insufficient to
account for the phenomenon. ©Of the
ten stainless steel harps that were
plugged while circulating this mixture,
s1x showed higher chromium content 1in
the cold leg, one showed higher
chromium content in the hot leg, and
the other three showed no systematic
variation,

The K,NaCrF, crystals apparently
form an open network that gradually
stops the flow without developing,
under usual operating conditions,
easlly detectable local concentrations.
The observation that increased operating
temperatures postpone the onset of
plugging 1n stainless steel loops 1s
consistent with this explanation of
the plugging phenomenon.

Preparation of Special Complex
Fluorides (B. J, Sturm, L. G, Overholser,
Materials Chemistry Division). Prepa-
rations of K,LiCrF,, KNaLiCrF,
Li,NaCrF,, Na,LiCrF,, and NaCrF; have
been made to furnish specimens for
x-ray and optical crystallographaic
data. Continued study of the complex
fluorides of nickel has not yvet
established whether definite compounds
or solid solutions exist 1n the
composition range between K,NiF, and
Na,N1F,. Also, several simple fluorides
of the structural metals, including
chromofluoride, ferrofluoride, nickel
fluoride, and ferrous oxide, have been

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

prepared for studies of their effect
on corrosion by fuel mixtures.

Chromic fluoride can be prepared
by thermal decomposition of (NH,),CrF,
at temperatures not exceeding 900°C
some CrF, 1s formed at higher tempera-
tures. Chromous fluoride 1s prepared
by heating (NH,),CrF, or a mixture of
hydrated CrF; and NH,KF, to 1200°C 1in
graphite crucibles. The product from
ei1ther of these procedures 1s i1dentical
with that obtained by hydrofluorination
of metallic chromium at 800°C, Ferric
fluoride 1s prepared by hydrofluora-
nation of “anhydrous” FeCl; at 200 to
300°C. Ferrous fluoride may be
prepared by heating (NH, ) ,FeF, at
750°C or, preferably, by hydrofluorai-
nation of FeCl, at a maximum tempera-
ture of 500°C. Nickel fluoride 1s
best prepared by thermal decomposition
of (NH,),N1F, Ferrous oxide 1s
prepared by decomposition, under an
atmosphere of CO,, of ferrous oxalate
precipitated from an aqueous solution
of ferrous ammonium sul fate by ammonium
oxalate. The ferrous oxide produced
1s very finely divided and 1s easily
oxidized by room temperature air, all
handling of this compound requires
a dry, 1inert atmosphere.

Alr Oxi1dation of Fuel Mixtures

Division). Solad UF, 1s known to
yield UO,F, and UF, as predominant
reaction products when treated wath
oxygen at high temperatures.(®:?)
However, when molten NaUFS in a nickel
boat was treated with 40 to 60 cc/min
of dry air for 2 to 6 hr at 750°C,
no gaseous uranium compounds were
observed

X-ray-diffraction techniques reveal
the presence of N10, U;0,, and Na,NiF,
among the solid products of the
reaction. In addition, several un-

Cone-arc welding 1s now being
applied to the production of the many
tube-to-header joints needed 1n the
construction of the complicated heat
exchangers for aircraft reactors,
Since the heat exchangers are to be
operated at a moderately high pressure
for the temperature i1nvolved, dished
header sheets are desired. The dished
header sheets i1mpose a new problem of
unequal arc distances 1n cone-arc
welding., Studies are under way to
select the proper conditions tominimize
this effect so that consistently sound
welds can be produced. In the fabri-
cation of large heat exchanger test
units by Nicrobrazing, difficulties
due to dilution and embrittlement by
the brazing alloy were encountered.

It 1s possible to substitute other
alloys for this brazing cycle that
will not cause severe dilution and
embrittlement, and the evaluation of
high-temperature brazing alloys 1s
continuing. The melting point of the
palladium-nickel brazing alloy was
lowered by additions of germanium.
The effects of time at the brazing
temperature and of joint spacing on
the strength properties of Nicrobrazed
Joints have been determined, A summary
of the butt-braze tensile strength
data obtained on the various brazing
alloys 1s presented.

A search for a satisfactory brazing
alloy for the joining of stainless-
steel- or Inconel-clad copper fins to
Inconel and stainless steel tubes has
proved fruitful, and the oxidation
characteristics of the alloys that
show good flowability on Inconel are
now being studied. However, 1t has
been demonstrated that a chrome-plated,
high-conductivity, copper fin does not
have sufficient oxidation resistance
for this application.

The effects of environment and of
surface treatment on the creep and
stress-rupture properties of Inconel
are still being studied. Preoxidized
specimens were tested i1n argon, and 1t
was found that the creep properties
were quilte similar to those determined
in argon, therefore surface oxidation
1s not the controlling factor in the
longer rupture times observed in the
air tests.

Control rod inserts of a mixture of
boron carbide and i1ron are being
prepared by powder metallurgy tech-
niques for the GE-ANP program. The
control rod inserts must be metal-
lurgically bonded to the outside
stainless steel tube, and various
brazing alloys are being studied for
this application. Boron carbide
safety rods for the Tower Shielding
Facility were also produced.

Special heats of a high-puraty
Inconel are being prepared for cor-
rosion tests, In the subsequent
extrusion of Inconel tubes, one of the
biggest difficulties to overcome 1s
the selection of a proper extrusion
lubricant. A satisfactory tube has
been produced by the use of glass as a
lubricant. In other studies, the
oxidation characteristics of columbium
are being i1nvestigated, and some
exploratory runs have been made on the
production of materials for use as
pump seals of the face-seal type being
studied by the Experimental Engineering
Group.

An enamel with high boron content
was applied on a shield test plate,
but a part of the surface was not well
covered and a second attempt was
necessary. Two cermet fuel elements
are described. Impregnation of

WELDING AND BRAZING RESEARCH

Cone-Arc Welding. The design of
recent fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers for
reactor research has necessitated the
fabrication of small, Inconel, tube-
to-header subassemblies that can be
built individually and then be welded
into one, larger, test assembly. It
is obvious from the large number of
tube-to-header joints to be heliarc
welded that a semiautomatic method
would be extremely desirable, As a
result, the cone-arc welding technique
was applied to preliminary experiments
in this subassembly fabrication. Since
the heat exchanger is to be operated
at a moderately high pressure for the
temperature involved, dished header
sheets are desirable. If the plane of
the bottom of the header is kept level
during welding, it is obvious that
unequal arc distances will prevail
around the periphery of many of the
tubes., Thus the ability to make con-
sistently sound welds on the dished
header depends, to a large degree,
upon the selection of conditions that
will minimize these variations in arc
distance. Offsetting the tungsten
electrode from the center of the tube
prior to welding and using a ball-and-
socket joint arrangement from which
the header can be pivoted are obvious
means of equalizing the arc distance
around the tube periphery.

Preliminary experiments on this
problem have consisted of investigating
the variables of arc current, arc
time, and electrode distance required
to produce consistently leak-tight

welds. An experimental, cone-arc
welded, test specimen 1is shown in
Fig. 11.1, which illustrates the

tendency for uneven melting around
some of the tube peripheries when the
tungsten electrode was centered over
the tube with the header plate axis
perpendicular to the electrode axis.

0.125 inch. The tubing has an outside

wall, and the hole center-to-center
distance is approximately 0,378 1inch,
Some difficulties have been en-
countered with joints that are not
pressure-tight, but it 1s expected
that further experiments will enable
the production of subassemblies that
will be completely sound. In each
test assembly that has been fabricated
thus far, only one or two joints were
unsatisfactory; the other joints were
pressure-tight to air at approximately
60 psig, This indicates that an
improvement in technique or a slight
variation in welding conditions should
help to improve the quality of these
cone-arc welded joints.
Fabrication of Heat Exchanger Units.
A second large sodium-to-air heat
exchanger assembly was fabricated by

 
Nicrobrazing and the over-all appear-
was much

ance, as shown in Fig. 11.2,
better than that of the first as-
sembly.¢') Changes incorporated in

the brazing procedure for this second
unit were the use of lesser guantities
of Nicrobraz, the use of several
aspirators to promote more even hy-
drogen flow between the fins, the
buildup of the whole assembly off the
can bottom to overcome the drastice
initial heating rate, and the use of a
slightly lower brazing temperature.
Pressure testing with helium, however,
revealed the presence of a leak in
the tube-to-fin matrix. A technique
was developed to seal off this tube on
each side of the leak by rebrazing,

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

but upon performing this operation,
several other leaks appeared in other
tubes.

It is hoped that the damaging
effects caused by subsequent Nicro-
brazing operations can be eliminated
by adopting a modified design that
would permit the heliarc welding of
the tube-to-header joints and the
joints in the heavier manifold sections,
By the use of the single-braze method,
any leaks in the tube-to-fin matrix
after brazing can be eliminated from
the coolant circuit by plug welding
the proper tubes. The tube-to-header
welds could then be made by manual
heliarc welding, as could the other
joints in the manifold circuit. With
some minor changes in radiator design,
it seems probable that completed units
could be fabricated with less chance
of obtaining leaky joints. By elimi-
nating several high-temperature brazing
operations, grain growth in the stain-
less steel tubes could be minimized,
as could embrittling of the base metal
by brazing alloy diffusion.

It is well known that certain
Nicrobrazed stainless steel joints
exhibit brittleness to a high degree.
This factor, coupled with the alloying
away of the tube wall by brazing alloy
dilution and diffusion, is thought to
be responsible for a major portion of
the leaks encountered in heat exchanger
fabrication. Since it seems probable
that joint brittleness may also be
associated with dilution and diffusion
phenomena, a systematic study of this
problem has been initiated.

Nicrobrazed tube-to-fin joints are
being prepared by using 0.010-in.-
thick, type 302 stainless steel fin
material and 0.150-in.-0D, 0,016-1in, -
wall, type 304 stainless steel tubing
for studying, by metallographic ex-
amination, the effects of (1) the
quantity of brazing alloy used, (2)
the brazing temperature for a given
time, and (3) the brazing time for a
given temperature, Small, medium,
and large amounts of brazing alloy and

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

the time at temperature, which may
vary from 10 min to 18 hr (for an
overnight brazing cycle), are being
investigated., The choice of brazing
temperature 1s being varied from 20°C
above the melting point to a maximum
of 120°C above the melting point.

Since 1t may be advisable to find a
substitute for Nicrobraz in the con-
struction of sodium-to-air heat ex-
changer, two other brazing alloys are
being subjected to similar diffusion
and dilution i1nvestigations. An 82%
Au-18% N1 alloy 1s typical of the
lower-melting, ductile, oxidation-
resistant brazing alloys that, un-
fortunately,are i1ncompatible with
sodium but may be used for tube-to-fin
construction 1f dilution and diffusion
can be controlled. A 60% Mn-40% N1
alloy has been shown to be compatible
with sodium, but it 1sslightly attacked
in high-temperature oxidation tests.
It 1s also somewhat brittle in the as-
brazed condition.

Brazing of Copper to Inconel The
need for a satisfactory brazing alloy
for joining copper fins to Inconel
tubing and for edge-sealing sheared,
Inconel-clad, copper fins has been

be resistant to oxidation at 1500°F,
should preferably serve as a diffusion
barrier against copper penetration
into the Inconel during service, and
should have a relatively high strength
at 1500°F. It 1s likely that some
alloy other than a copper-base alloy
would best fill these requirements.
An experimental, modified, Nicrobraz
alloy, which melts at approximately
1850°F, appears to be very promising,
as do alloys of 82% Au-~18% N1 and 90%
Au-10% Co. Oxidation tests at 1500°F
on brazed Inconel joints indicate no
appreciable attack., A list of several
alloys, currently being 1investigated,
that melt i1n this medium temperature
range 1s given 1in Table 11.1. Flow-
abi1lity tests on Inconel have been
made, and the results of these tests
are also listed in Table 11.1.
Edge-sealing experiments on chromium-
plated copper disks are beaing con-
ducted, and techniques are being
studied for obtaining a satisfactory
edge seal on these disks. At the
present, the fin edges are being
suspended 1n a slurry of the modified,
low-melting-point, Nicrobraz alloy and

atmosphere. Another method to be
investigated for covering these exposed
copper edges is the preplacing of a
fine wire of brazing alloy in the
crevice formed by chemically etching
away asmall amount of copper in nitric
acid., It is expected that this latter
technique, if successful, will prevent
fin distortion, which is believed to
be due to unavoidable nonuniform
wetting of the fin periphery by
brazing alloy applied as a slurry.

is not so important as the previously
reported limited data indicated. The
room temperature strengths of these
joints are generally much less than
the strength of the base Inconel and
do not vary appreciably with time at
temperature. Only occasionally does a
joint exhibit high tensile strength at
room temperature, and the previous
results were apparently distorted by
these infrequent high values. A
summary of the data is given in Table
11.2; four tensile bars were tested
for each brazing time.

It is expected that the brazing
time will have a greater effect with
stainless steel, because the width of
the diffusion zone is generally larger.
The composition of Inconel is similar

to that of Nicrobraz, with respect to
nickel, chromium, and iron contents,
and therefore diffusion may be some-
what hindered by the lack of large
concentration gradients. The tensile
strengths of Nicrobrazed Inconel joints
at 1500°F have all been consistently

high, as previously reported, and the
fractures often occur in the base
metal.

Effect of Spacing on Brazed Joint
Strength. An investigation was con-
ducted to determine the effect of
joint spacing on the short-time,
room-temperature, tensile strength of
Nicrobrazed Inconel joints. Four
butt-brazed tensile bars were prepared
for each joint spacing of 0,005, 0.010,
0.015, and 0,020 The results of

this i1nvestigation indicate that joint
spacing 1s not a critical factor 1in
the room-temperature tensile strength
of Nicrobrazed Inconel joints, at
least within the ranges 1nvestigated.
This range should cover nearly all
applications, since the effect of a
shrink fit would tend tobe lost during
the furnace brazing operation, and a
spacing of over 0.020 in. would result
1n extremely poor fitup.

Strength of Brazed Joints with
Yarious Base Metals Butt-braze
tensile data on the 73.5% Ni1-16.5% Cr-
10 0% S1 alloy indicate that the base-
metal composition may be a very
1mportant factor in determining the
subsequent tensile strengths of
brazed joints., The average of the
room-temperature tensile strengths of
the Inconel joints was 33,700 psa.
Similar tests on brazed type 316
stainless steel showed an average
tensile strength of 64,400 psi, which
1s nearly double the value recorded
for Inconel. The elevated-temperature
tests for both base metals gave
excellent results. Joint efficiencies
of 99% were obtained for Inconel, and
efficiencies of 98% were obtained for
type 316 stainless steel,

Nicrobrazed joints on stainless
steel also had higher tensile strengths
than Nicrobrazed joints on Inconel,
The average, room-temperature, tensile
strength for stainless steel joints

was 68,800 psi, whereas the corres-
ponding value for Inconel was 34,900
psi. The 1500°F tensile tests again
gave evidence of joint efficiencies
approaching 100% for both base metals.

A summary of a major portion of the
butt-braze tensile data obtained thus
far 1s presented i1n Table 11.3. The
value listed for the room-temperature
strength of Nicrobrazed Inconel joints
1s that resulting from a series of
tests inwhich some specimens fractured
at values nearly equal to the tensile
strength of Inconel., Hence, this
average value 1s somewhat higher than
the values shown in Table 11.2, 1n
which no data were recorded that indi-
cated such high trends. Also the
values of joint efficiency for stain-
less steel joints are only approximate
because the 0.252-1n.-di1a stainless
steel tensile bars have not yet been
tested after they were subjected to
the brazing cycle.

during test would have a significant
effect on the creep rate and rupture
life. Results obtained during the
past quarter continue to indicate that
the properties are best when the
Inconel 1s tested in air, poorest when
tested i1n a hydrogen atmosphere, and
intermediate when tested in argon. The
rupture life observed 1n tests 1in a
hydrogen atmosphere was of the order
of one-tenth the life observed when
tested i1n air, this observation holds
for stresses of 4000 psi or less. One
hypothesis regarding the long rupture
life 1n air i1nvolved a strengthenaing
action by the oxide film formed during
the early part of the test., To test
this possibility, aseries of specimens
was heated in air for 200 hr at 815°C
to form such a film.

The preoxidized specimens were then
tested at 815°C 1n argon, stressed to
2500, 3500, and 4500 psi., In the
three tests, the rupture times were
far short of the rupture times 1n aair,
and were very close to the life when
tested i1n argon. It 1s to be noted

146

that the elongation during test was
much greater than that observed 1n
other environments, and there was no
evidence of cracking i1in the failm.
Figure 11.5 shows the strain vs. time
relationships of the bright and the
preoxidized specimens tested 1n argon,
These results could mean either that
nitrogen rather than oxygen was the
controlling factor or, as 1s more
probable, that the oxide film formed
stress rises when 1t cracked and that
this action, 1n turn, promoted the
integranular cracking that ultimately
led to failure.

Peened Inconel 1n Argon Specimens
of Inconel have been heavily peened
with fine steel shot and are now being
tested i1n argon. This mechanical
working of the specimen surface has
increased the rupture life in com-
parison with the life of specimens
that did not receive this treatment.
Also, the creep rate for the peened
specimen 1s much lower than that
observed for other specimens at the
same stress 1n any atmosphere. It 1s

improbable that this effect 1s the
result of residual compressive stress
induced by the peening action, since
such stresses would recover at a
temperature lower than the test temper-
ature, It 1s hoped that metallographic
examination will furnish a clue for
explaining the 1mproved properties
resulting from the peening.

Effect of Inconel Grain Size on
Time to Rupture As a general state-
ment, fine-grained Inconel (0.105 mm
1n diameter) 1s more sensitive than
coarse-grained Inconel (0.250 mm 1n
diameter) to the several test environ-
ments, Table 11.4 tabulates the
comparative responses to these environ-
ments at a representative stress
level.

When the hydrogen was introduced, the
strain rate was accelerated, and when
the argon was re-introduced, the creep
rate during the argon cycle remained
approximately the same as the last
creep rate 1n hydrogen. These results
appear to indicate that the effect of
the hydrogen atmosphere 1s one of a
permanent nature. Metallographic
studies do not clearly reveal what the
effect 1s, however, the microstructure

ment The absence of a linear, second-
stage section in the strain vs time

granular cracking characteristic of
high-temperature failure 1s 1nitiated
very early i1n the test life. The
various test conditions may either
hasten or retard the formation and
propogation of these i1ntergranular

of the descaling
The first series of tests
was preceded by a sodium descaling
operation. The rupture times were
very short, and the microstructures
1indicate a stress-corrosion type of
failure. Subsequent tests were pre-
ceded by a fluoride descaling process.
The rupture times were closer to those
observed 1n argon, and the micro-

structures revealed subsurface voids

showed a longer ruptu-e life than the

run to date were for type 316 stain-
less steel tubes loaded internally
with argon under pressure and held in
an atmosphere of pure argon, A speci-
men so loaded has a multiaxial stress

Control Rods for the G-E R-1 Reactor.
A study concerning the adaptation of
the 1ron-cemented boron carbide compo-
si1tion used for the ARE safety rod
slugs to the control rods for the G-E
R-1 reactor was undertaken at the
request of the General Electric Co.
In brief, the specifications for these
previous progress report(s) included
some results of tests conducted 1n
argon purified by titanium sponge.
The work during this period has in-
cluded 100-hr tests in vacuum at 800
and 1000°C., This work will also
indicate the pressures tolerable in
subsequent heat treatments. The data
obtained thus far are given in Table
11.6. Future work 1s to include the
effect of recirculating the purified
gas over titanium sponge and dryaing
agents by using a pump 1n a closed
system.

Oxidation. Tests have been com-
pleted on the oxidation of columbium
in air containing 18.7 mm water vapor.
This 1nvestigation was undertaken after
a run made at 400°C 1n air that
inadvertently contained water vapor
resulted i1n a particularly rapid rate
of oxidation. A constant humidity was
obtained by passing the air through a
saturated solution of NH4C1 at 25°C,
the moisture content checked to withan
0 5% of the saturation value when the
water absorbed i1n anhydrone was
weighed.

The results at 400°C have been
checked, and they show that the presence
of moisture 1ncreases the oxidation
rate by a factor of about 400 at the
end of 10 hours. At 600°C, a reverse
effect was found i1n that the oxidation

rate decreased significantly (by a
factor of 2). It was also apparent
that the oxi1dation rate was not linear.
Several breaks in the curve of a plot
of weight gain vs. time have been
observed and duplicated. At 800,
1000, and 1200°C, the oxidation rates
1n moist air are no different from
those 1n dry aar.

X-ray data have been obtained for
the specimens oxidized in air, and
thus far the oxides formed are all
modifications of Cb,0,, of which there
are three,(%) Inconsistencies have
been observed for the oxidation rates
at 800°C., In these runs, flat sheet
oxi1dized to a white scale on the
edges, but the other areas formed a
rather dense black oxide. A 0.040-1n,
wire became entirely white with oxide.
Above 800°C, the oxidation rate showed
a slight deviation from linearity,.
This may have been the result of
partial protection of the underlying
metal by the thick oxide or a decrease
1n the surface area. The results at
800, 1000, and 1200°C are being checked
by oxidizing columbium rod that 1s
clad on the circumference with Inconel.
It 1s hoped that the i1nconsistencies
observed at 800°C can be eliminated by
this method, since 1t 1s believed that
the i1nconsistencies were caused by the
surface areas not being constant.

High-Conductivity Metals for
Radiator Fins A program has been
outlined for the evaluation of coated
metals suitable for radiator fin ma-
terials, methods of assembly, and
effects of exposure to high tempera-
tures. The coated metals must have
good thermal conductivity, as well as
the requiredhigh-temperature corrosion
resistance. The materials required
for this work have been ordered, and
the detailed experimental work must
await their arraval.

Small quantities
simi1lar to those on order have been
prepared and submitted to the Welding
Group for evaluation of brazing tech-
niques. These materials include
chromium-plated copper, Inconel- and
type 310 stainless-steel-clad copper,
and Inconel- and type 310 stainless-
steel-clad silver.

Oxygen-free, high-conductivaity
copper chromium-plated to various
thicknesses was tested in flowing air
at 815°C for times up to 30 hours. It
was found that the chromium oxide
formed on the surface spalled and did
not form a protective film. Thus, the
possibility of using chromium-plated
copper for high-conductivity fins 1s
not very promising.

Solid-Phase Bonding. Two series of
samples of solid-phase bonded metals
have been prepared and are to be
studied. One series of samples will
be used for evaluating the effect of
time on the extent of bonding, the
other set will be used for measuring
the effectiveness of electrodeposited
chromium 1n bonding molybdenum to
other metals.

Chromium was selected as a trial
bonding medium because of 1ts un-
limited solubility with molybdenum.

of materials

152

Runs have been made with chromium-
plated molybdenum vs. nickel, 1ron,
stainless steel, and Inconel at 1150
and 1250°C. One run has been made to
check the self-welding of molybdenum
at 1500°C.

Extrusion of High-Purity Tubing.
This phase of development 1s a result
of the present need for high-puraity
Inconel tubing - and subsequently for
other high-temperature alloys - for
corrosion testing to determine the
effect of i1mpurities on corrosion
resistance. The primary problem to
date 1n the extrusion process has been
one of lubrication, as evidenced by
several attempts to produce the Inconel
tubing. None of the extrusions has
been entirely successful, because
either the mandrel broke or the tube
ruptured.

Molten glass was selected as the
lubricant for the extrusion process,
which 1s a modification of Sejournet-
Ugine process, because the unit
extrusion pressures required are lower
with glass than with graphite or o1l.
Another factor favoring molten glass
1s the reduced possibility of pickup
of carbon and sulfur. As an 1llus-
tration, a solid rod was extruded
successfully by using Necrolaine,
which has a graphite base, and analysas
1ndicated an 1ncrease 1n carbon and
sulfur from case to extruded form, as
follows 0.01% carbon as cast, 0.03%
carbon extruded, 0.007% sul fur as
cast, 0.017% sulfur extruded.

For the extrusions made thus far,
the extrusion billet was heated 1n
molten lead glass. Unfortunately, a
portion of the lead compound present
1in the glass was reduced, and as a
result metallic lead precipitated 1n
the bath. The mechanism of the re-
duction 1s not yet known, however, the
glass was held i1n a stainless steel
container that was seated i1n and
extended above the top of a gas-fired
pot furnace. The prescribed extrusion
temperature for Inconel 1s 2300°F, but
with the present heating arrangement,
2100°F 1s the maximum temperature
obtainable., These factors, no doubt,
contributed to or caused the extrusion
failures.

One of the ultimate objectaives as
to obtain tubing that has no inclusions
resulting from the addition of mal-
leabilizing elements such as magnesium,
titanium, manganese, and aluminum. To
determine whichmalleabilizing elements
are necessary, 1ngots were vacuum cast
with (1) no malleabilizing elements,
(2) 0.05% magnesium (nominal),
(3) 0.25% titanium, as a Ti1-Al-Mn
master alloy, and 0 05% magnesium.
Difficulty was experienced 1n attempting
to add magnesium ain the form of a
master alloy to Inconel melts under
vacuum because of the high vapor
pressure of magnesium,

These 1ngots were successfully
extruded by using rock wool insulation
in the press”éontainer and glass wool
(both pyrex and soft glass) on the hot
extrusion billet., This procedure 1s
essentially the same as that employed

and

by the International Nickel Co. The
extrusion conditions were

crucibles to eliminate magnesium

Ceramic Coatings for Shielding. A
lead borate enamel was applied by
flame-spraying to a 5-ft by 5-ft by
7/8-in. steel plate, but the coating
was imperfect on part of the surface.
The thickness of the plate prevents
the spraying of a smooth, glass coat-
ing, even when the plate is initially
preheated to 1000°F, A larger flame-
spray unit would probably work, but
with the available unit, a maximum
steel thickness of about 1/8 in. 1is
indicated.

The coating can be successfully
applied by the standard enameling
technique of dusting the powdered
glass on the red hot metal. An
initial metal temperature of 1400°F is
adequate for this coating.

Development of Cermet Fuel Elements,.
A Cr-Al,0; solid fuel element of
possible use in nuclear-powered air-
craft has been fabricated. These
cermet elements would be for use in a
reactor system that resembled a disk
heat exchanger, Disks of Cr-Al,Q;
containing an enclosed “sandwich” ring
of UD, are strung on 1/4-in,-dia
stainless steel tubes through which a
coolant passes. These disks give up
their heat to an air stream passing
over their surfaces. The coolant
keeps the steel tubes cool enough to
maintain adequate strength, resist
oxidation, and provide some moderation
in the reactor core.

154

The Cr-Al1,0, cermet has excellent
oxidation resistance up to 2200°F and
adequate heat-shock resistance in the
form proposed. However, radiation
damage and fission product retention
are unknown. The disks have been
fabricated with a 0.020-in. thickness
and a l-in. outside diameter. A
photomicrograph of a Cr-Al,0, disk
section containing 8 wt % UOD, is shown
in Fig. 11.7.

A silicon-silicon carbide material
has been proposed as a potentially
useful solid aircraft reactor fuel
element, and experiments have been
carried out to fabricate such elements.
A process similar to that developed by
the Carborundum Co. for impregnating
carbon 1s used. Cross-shaped elements

Reduction of the Porosity of ARE
Beryllium Oxide. A series of experi-
ments was 1nitlated 1n an attempt to
reduce the porosity and to 1ncrease
the corrosion resistance of the
hexagonal beryllium oxide blocks that
are to be used for the ARE. Impregnation
of porous beryllium oxide test pieces
with various materials was attempted,
and preliminary vapor deposition
studies were begun, Samples of the
impregnated beryllium and the other
specimens will be subjected to cor-
rosion tests 1n sodium.

In the first impregnation, the
beryllium oxide test pieces (1/2 by
1/4 by 1/4 1n.) were 1mmersed 1n
molten hydrated beryllium nitrate at
135°C for 48 hours. The test pieces
were then placed 1n a small porcelaain
crucible, covered with the beryllium
nitrate, and heated until evolution of
NO, was complete. Then, after the
powdered beryllium oxide had been
scraped from the surfaces, the test
pieces were heated to 1550°C, held for
15 min, and allowed to cool to room
temperature. This procedure caused a
slight permanent increase in the weight
of the test pieces but no measurable
reduction 1n porosity.

The second i1mpregnation experiment
was carried out under similar con-
ditions, but magnesium nitrate was
used i1nstead of beryllium naitrate.
This impregnation resulted 1in an
appreciable permanent weight gain and
in a reduction of the porosity to
about 35% of 1ts original value.

The third method tried was successful
1n reducing the porosity of the test
pleces to an almost negligible amount,
In this method, a mixture of 37,5%
AlF, and 62.5% CaF, was prefused to
give a glass. The glass was then
pulverized and suspended 1n water to
give a very heavy suspension. The

small (1/2 by 1/4 by 1/4 1n.) beryllium
oxi1de test pieces were dipped into
thi1s suspension and drained, and the
adhering coating was dried. These
pieces were then heated to 1550°C,
held for 15 min at this temperature,
and allowed to cool 1n the furnace.
This treatment resulted in the coating
soaking 1nto the porous pleces and
completely filling the pores.

A test was performed to determine
whether the method outlined above for
the AlF;-CaF, mixture would be feasible
when used on one of the ARE-s1ize
blocks. One of the half-blocks of
beryllium oxide, which had been shown
to be porous by both i1mmersion 1in a
fuschin-dye—alcohol solution and by
the water absorption method, was
coated with the AlF,-CaF, mixture,
The coated block was then heated at
750°C per hour to 1550°C, held at
1550°C for about 45 min, and cooled
overnight 1n the furnace. The result
was a nonporous block, except for
cracks that, although present in the
block before the heat treatment,
now much enlarged.

To determine the cause for the
enlargement of the cracks, two, full-
si1ze, hexagonal blocks of beryllium
oxide were heated at 750°C per hour to
1550°C and held for 1 hour. These
blocks had no applied coating, and
hence any effects could be attributed
to the heat treatment. There were
several minute cracks and a zone of
weakness perpendicular to the axais
across the middle of each block before
the heat treatment was carried out.
However, these blocks are typical -
nearly all blocks on hand have this
zone of weakness. After the heat
treatment, both blocks had broken
along the zone of weakness, and one
had also split axially from one side
into the core hole. It 1s to be
concluded therefore that the block
can be broken by heating at 750°C per
hour and that the impregnation treat-
ment 1s not the cause of the cracking
of the pieces.

Some preliminary thermal conduc-

hydroxide were made, and results
1indicate that the conductivity 1in-
creases from about 0.4 to about 0.8
Btu/hr ft*°F over the temperature
range of 650 to 1000°F, The enthalpies
and heat capacities of strontium
hydroxide and NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4

capacity of strontium hydroxide was
found to be 0.32 * 0.03 cal/g*°C over
the temperature range of 570 to 900°C,
the heat capacity of NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(503$§-4 mole %) was found to be
0.31 £ 0.03 cal/g*°C over the tempera-
ture range of 550 to 850°C. Some
preliminary vliscosity measurements on
molten sodium hydroxide were made that
varied from 4.6 cp at 340°C to 2.5 cp
at 448°C. Vapor pressure measurements
made on the enriched ARE fuel were
much lower than the theoretical value
determined for the pure components
(NaF, ZrF,, and UF,), which indicates
the existence of complex compounding
of 1ons at high temperatures. A graph
of the temperature variation of the
Prandtl moduli of several fluorade
mixtures, as well as some liquad
metals, water, and sodium hydrox-
1de, has been prepared, the Prandtl
modulil of the fluoride mixtures are
between approximately 1 and 10 i1n the
high-temperature range in which air-
craft reactors are to operate.

An analysis has been completed
that can be used to minimize the
weight of a radiator for a given power
output by optimizing the fin spacaing,
fin thickness, tube diameter, and tube
spacing for plate-fin radiators
operating in the laminar flow region.
An apparatus has been designed for
determining fluid velocaity profiles
1n the annular spaces found 1n reactor
systems. Temperature distributions

1n thermal entrance regions of cair-

Three different methods are now
being used to determine the thermal
conductivityof liquids at high tempera-
tures, Two methods are based on
steady-state flow of heat downward
through a thin section of liquid, and
the third method i1nvolves transient
heat flow from an electrically heated
tube to the surrounding test liquad.
These methods have been described in
previous quarterly reports. At
present, the thermal conductivity of
molten sodium hydroxide 1s being
determined. Preliminary results
indicate that the conductivity of
sodium hydroxide increases from about
0.4 to about 0.8 Btu/hr-ft*°F over
the temperature range of 650 to
1000 °F.

After additional thermal conduc-
tivity measurements on sodium hydroxide

If the mixture 1s regarded as being
composed of the compounds zirconium
tetrafluoride, uranium tetrafluorade,
and sodium fluoride, the 1deal vapor
pressure at 970°C, a temperature
arbitrarily chosen for comparison
purposes, 1s calculated from Raoult’s
law to be 518 mm Hg. The actual vapor
pressure of 19 mm 1s a very large
negative deviation from ideality. This
result 1s 1n agreement with results
obtained for other zirconium tetra-
fluoride-bearing mixtures and has been
interpreted as an indication that
zirconium tetrafluoride and uranium
tetrafluoride exi1st in the fused
mixture 1n the form of complex 1ons.
However, 1t 1s 1nteresting to note
that when the mixture 1s considered
tobe composed of NaZrF; and NaUFg (the
vapor pressure of NaUF, at 970°C 1s
negligible), the 1deal pressure 1s
calculated to be 33 mm. The negative
deviation 1s still present, but to a
much less extent. It 1s possible that

NaZrF, may exist in these melts,

PRANDTL MODULI OF VARIOUS MATERIALS

The Prandtl number 1s one of the

convective heat transfer. In the case
of turbulent flow, convective heat
transfer may be divided 1nto three
classes, depending upon the nature of
the fluaid the liquid metals are 1in
the Prandtl modulus range of about

are 1n the Prandtl modulus range of

fluids have Prandtl numbers of several

different classes of fluids 1s defined
by a different turbulent convection

mately 1 to 10 and thus should have
the heat transfer characteristics of
ordinary fluads.

The problem of designing a minimum-

Difficulties due to poor braze contact
between the fins and tubes have recently
been experienced in the fabrication
of plate-fin radiators. Therefore
attention 1s now being given to other
types of fins, such as circular disk
fins, that can be fabricated so that
the difficulties can be obviated. A
general analysis 1s being made of the
performance of radiators that embody
several different types of extended
surfaces and shapes.

Because the air radiator 1s to be
operated at high temperatures with
large temperature differences existing
between the wall temperature and the
air temperature, the problem of non-
1sothermal heat transfer assumes con-
siderable i1mportance. Since efforts
to correlate the performance of several
air radiators tested by the Experi-
mental Engineering Group with existing
theories for nonisothermal heat
transfer have not been too successful,
the possibility of developing new
analytical solutions is being examined.

CIRCULATING-FUEL HEAT TRANSFER

H. F. Poppendiek G. Winn
Reactor Experimental Engineeraing
Division

Thermal and hydrodynamic boundary
layers are usually not established
in short-duct circulating-fuel systems,
such as the Fireball, for example.
These systems are being studied
mathematically. For some specifac
systems, the differential equataions
describing the boundary-value problem
have been transformed to finaite
difference equations and evaluated
numerically. Recent evaluations have
been made with the aid of high-speed
computing machines,

An apparatus that will yield expera-
mental 1nformation on the thermal
structure i1n circulating-fuel systems,
1in both the entrance region and the
established flow region, was briefly
described previously.¢(!!) Thais
apparatus, which has been fabricated
and assembled (shown schematically
in Fig. 12.4), consists of a closed
loop that cairculates a sulfuric acad
solution, a volume heat source 1is
generated within the circulating acad
by means of an alternating current.
Several orifice meters have been
calibrated, and the power supply that

RADIATION DAMAGE

D. S. Billington, Solid State Division
A. J. Miller, ANP Division

Radiation-damage studies of struc-
tural materials, fuels, and other
coolants exposed in the ORNL graphite
reactor and the LITR have continued.
Two Inconel capsules containing the
ARE zirconium-bearing fuel were
1irradiated in the MTR and examined.
In both cases, various portions of the
capsule walls attained temperatures
well above 1500°F. There were inda-
cations of changes i1n the fuel com-
position, and corrosion occurred 1n
excess of that in out-of-reactor tests
at 1500°F. A third irradiation 1s
now 1n progress in the MTR, and, with
a more elaborate control system, an
attempt 1s being made to hold the
maximum wall temperature at 1500°F,.
Additional i1n-reactor cantilever
creep measurements on Inconel in an
air atmosphere were made 1in both the
graphite reactor and the LITR. In
confirmation of previous observations,
1t appeared that the irradiation had
little effect on the creep strength.

These and other radiation-damage
studies are described. Additional
information 1s contained 1n the

Thermal-flux measurements of fused
salts were made 1n the testing facilaty
in the MTR. The power density in the

ARE type of fuel was found to be 2700
watts/cm?®, rather than the 1900
watts/cm® predicted.

The wall temperature of the first
capsule of the ARE type of fuel
irradiated in the MIR was detected and
controlled by a single thermocouple.
Examination of the surface 1n contact
with the fuel disclosed that at least
some portions of the wall had been
heated to temperatures far above 1500°F
during the 116 hr of airradiation. In
some sections, the Inconel grain size
had been greatly 1ncreased and corrosion
penetration of up to 10 to 12 mails
occasionally occurred. In the regions
of normal grain size, the wall showed
uniform, dense, 1intergranular corrosion
that averaged about 2 mils in depth,
and there were subsurface voids 2 to
4 mils deep.

Fhe second MTR fuel capsule was
irradiated for 325 hr and the wall
temperature was detectedat two points.
The control thermocouple held the
capsule wall locally at 1500°F, but
the second thermocouple, several
milliliters away, recorded temperatures
as high as 1740°F. Examination of the
Inconel 1n this case showed only
dense, 1intergranular corrosion that
averaged about 2 mils in depth.

Sealed Inconel capsules that had
been prepared for irradiation in the
MTR were x rayed, and the photograph
showed that the fuel was not solidly
packed 1nto the 100-m11-ID fuel
chamber. Rather than occupying the
bottom of the chamber, the fuel was
scattered over the length, and thus
there were numerous voids in what had
been assumed to be asolid fuel column.
Considerable study was given to the
filling and temperature control
techniques. A thaird capsule, which 1is
currently being irradiated in the MTR,

165
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

was filled by an improved method, and
1t was observed with x rays that the
fuel formed a nearly continuous
100-m1l-d1a columnin the lower 1/2 1n.
of the fuel chamber. A rod attached
to the cap of the capsule was fitted
tightly 1nto the fuel chamber to
press on the top of the fuel to help
hold 1t i1n place. Three thermocouples
were spotted on the outside chamber
walls to record the temperatures 1in
various locations, and they were
instrumented so that the temperature
could be regulated by means of the
hottest thermocouple. During the
course of the experiment the middle
thermocouple has been damaged, and
the temperature 1s now controlled by
the top and bottom thermocouples.
Chemical analyses and analyses for
the fission product Cs!3®7 were carried
out on the two fuel samples irradiated
1n the MTR  Since there 1s some doubt
as to how thoroughly the fuel was
dissolved during the course of the
analytical work, there 1s some doubt
as to the validity of the analytical
results. Work 1s under way to improve
the methods of dissolution of the fuel.
However, a trend that warrants mention
was 1ndicated by the analytical re-
sults. There was indication that the
fuel which could be readily melted
out of the capsule was more deficient
1n uranium than could be accounted
for by burnup. This deficiency 1in
uranium did not occur 1in the controls
heated on the bench at 1500°F for an
equivalent number of hours. In addi-
tion, when the Cs'37 was counted 1in
the fuel that had been melted out,
there was less detected than would
be expected from the thermal-flux
measurements, In one case, the
discrepancy 1n Cs'37 corresponded
fairly closely with the discrepancy
in uranium content, 33% and 28%, and
led to the supposition that the
uranium had been segregated during the
early portion of the 1rradiation
period However, the shortage an
cesium might have been due to escape

166

of xenon 1into the capsule free space
and subsequent deposition of cesium
on the walls

If 1t 1s assumed there are no con-
vection currents i1n the capsule to
relieve the temperature gradients,
the central portion of the fuel 1s
calculated to be 1200°F hotter than
the fuel at the wall, which the
thermocouples try to hold at 1500°F.
Whether the apparent uranium segre-
gation was due to whatever temperature
gradients may have existed, the general
overheating of the capsule, faulty
analyses, or to radiation-damage 1s
a question that requires further
investigation. In 1rradiations
carried out several months ago with
the Y-12 Cyclotron and by North
American Aviation{(!) on the Berkeley
Cyclotron, some evidences of uranium
segregation in the various fuels were
also noted, but the question of un-
certain thermal history exists for
these cases too,

Before opening, the first capsule
irradiated 1n the MTR was heated to
well above the normal melting point
of the fuel and 1ts freezing point
was compared with that of unirradiated
fuel 1n a similar capsule by means of
a differential thermocouple arrange-
The melting point of the
irradiated fuel appeared to be 23°F
higher, but the difference was within
the range of experimental error. In
a similar experiment, a sample of
fuel 1rradiated for 140 hr in the
LITR at 140 watts/cm® appeared to have
an 11°F lower melting point than 1ts
corresponding unirradiated bench
tests

Only a small amount of work 1is
now being done on radiation damage
with the Y-12 Cyclotron. This work
included an i1nvestigation of methods
for helium-cooling targets containing
fused fluorides, the study has been
discontinued. Also, some work 1s

The loop previously reported(?) as
having circulated sodium 1n the LITR
"for a week was examined to determine
the cause of stoppage of flow. It
was found that the difficulty was due
to a leak 1n the Inconel tubing that
caused a lowering of the sodium level
in the surge tank. Additional experi-
ments were carried out with sodium
loops 1in the graphite reactor while
1mprovements were being made 1in the
design of the LITR loop. Development

CREEP UNDER IRRADIATION

Several new tests have been com-
pleted on annealed Inconel at 1500°F
with stresses of 3000 and 4000 psi in
air in both the LITR and the graphite
reactor. The spread i1n the data and
some variations in experimental condi-
tions allow no quantitative estimates
to be made of the effect of neutron
bombardment on creep, but 1t can
safely be said that the effect 1s not
great enough to cause material change
1n the design stress values for these
materials under these experimeéntal
conditions. The next work to be

(2)ANP Quar

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1953

performed will be to assess the effect
of the atmosphere in which the specimen
1s tested, since this 1s known to be
an important factor in the creep
strength of Inconel.(3)

In Fig. 13.1, the 4000-psi1 data
show that less creep was experienced
under irradiation than in the single
bench test. The odd shape of curve
X-1l 1s believed to have been caused
by the loading weight resting against
the microformer during the early
part of the test. The difference
between the LITR curves may have
resulted because the test shown by
curve L-2 received 24 hrof irradiation
before the furnace was turned on and
the specimen was stressed.

The total strains in each of two,
3000-ps1, graphite reactor tests, and
one LITR test, shown in Fig. 13.2,
are in good agreement with the values
for similar tests reported earlier.(*%)
On the basis of the single bench test
to which all the in-reactor curves
are compared, 1t 1is not possible to
say whether more or less creep resulted
from irradiation. At the end of the
quarter, two tests were operating in
the LITR in a helium atmosphere and
duplicate bench tests were about to
be started.

Annealed Inconel and type 347
stainless steel bars were exposed for
a one-week period in hole HB-3 of the
LITR 1n a gradient furnace to determine
the highest temperature at which
neutron bombardment would cause an
increase 1n hardness of the metals.
The temperature gradient was from
1700 to 1150°F over 4.5-1in. specimens.
Rockwell B hardness measurements were
made after i1rradiation and compared
to the 1nitial hardness and to the
hardness of control bars subjected to
the same time and temperature history
as the 1n-reactor specimens. The
Inconel was hardened slaightly by

the hardness data may help to explain
why no substantial effects of irrada-

the steep gradients in the experiment

ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF REACTOR MATERIALS

C. D. Susano, Analytical Chemistry Division

J. M. Warde, Metallurgy Division

The work on reactor fuel components
during the past quarter has produced a
satisfactory method for the determi-
nation of zirconium i1n the presence of
uranium. A method was also developed
by which the reduction products,
uranium trifluoride and zirconium
metal, may be determined 1n the presence
of one another. These reduced species
may be formed upon excessive addition
of a corrosion i1nhibitor such as a
hydride or NaK to the ARE fuel mixture,

Study has also been concentrated on
developing methods for the determi-
nation of contaminants in the fluoraide
fuel mixtures. An apparatus has been
developed and tested in which traces
of metallic oxides 1in fluoride mixtures
may be determined. The determination
of trace qguantities of hydrogen fluoride
1n helium 1s expedient during the final
stages of the fuel preparation process,
and a method for rapidly accomplishing
this at the site of the fuel preparation
has been developed.

A study 1s being made of the compounds
formed between fluoride melts and
their containers. Residues of these
corrosion products are being examined
analytically and spectrographically.

The systems UCl,-NaCl and UCl,-KCl
have been examined petrographically to
determine compound and eutectic compo-
sitions. Optical data are included
for the compounds 1n these systems.
Phases present in the NaF-ZrF, -UF,
system have been studied petro-
graphically and by x-ray diffraction
in an effort to define the ternary and
pseudobinary phase regions and to
1denti1fy the compounds therein, Data
for the compositions studied to date
are included,

The bulk of work performed by the
service groups during the past quarter
involved chemical analyses and petro-

examination of fluorade
In addition, chemical
analyses were performed on a group of

were made on a number of chloride and

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF REACTOR FUELS
AND CONTAMINANTS

J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

A new volumetric method for the
determination of zirconium was de-
veloped. This method consists of
dissolving the zirconium salt of
p-chloromandelic acid 1n a nonaqueous
medium with excess sodium methylate
and back titrating with acetic acid.
The reaction involved 1sstoichiometrac,
hence, no empirical factors are ain-
volved.

A method for the determination of
uranium trifluoride and zirconium
metal, which are formed upon the
addition of zirconium hydride or other
similar corrosion inhibitors, was
developed. These determinations can
be made i1n the presence of each other
because of the great differential
reaction rates of these two materials
with dilute hydrofluoric acid reagent.

The reactions of bromine trifluoride
with metallic oxides are being studied
1n an effort to measure trace amounts
of oxide 1n fluoride mixtures and also
to determine the completeness of
fluorination of zirconium oxide during
the preparation of the fluoride.

A method for the determination of
traces of hydrogen fluoride i1n helium
sweepings of fuel preparations was
developed 1in which the gas 1s trapped

The dissolution of Inconel con-
tainers, which have been corroded by
fluoride reactor fuels, was attempted
electrolytically in such a manner as
to separate metals from compounds. The

Of the several procedures explored for
the determination of zirconium, (! the
simplest and most accurate 1s a volu-
metric method employing mandelic acaid,
This reagent 1s especially good for
determining zirconium 1n the presence
of uranium. It was decided to further
investigate reagents of the mandelaic
acid type, and a volumetric procedure
was developed employing p-bromomandelic
and p-chloromandelic acids. These
acids precipltate zirconium 1n acidic

tetra p-bromo(chloro)mandelate, which

1s more easily filtered than the zir-
conium mandelate, (It 1s possible to
then dry this salt and determine zir-
conium gravimetrically,(2:3) but the
volumetric method 1s simpler to
execute, )

The salt dissolves 1n alkali with
subsequent hydrolysis of zirconium.
However, when an alkali 1s used 1n a
nonaqueous medium to dissolve the
salt, hydrolysis does not occur, On
this basis, a volumetric method for

Uranium trifluoride reacts gquanti-
tatively, as shown by Manning(¢(%) 1in
his method for the determination of
uranium trifluoride., When a mixture
of the two 1s treated with 9.6 M HC1,
hydrogen equivalent to the total zar-
conium and uranium trifluoride present
1s liberated 1n approximately 20 min
at 90°C. This reaction can be ex-
plained on the basis of formation of a
complex 10on by zirconium with the
fluoride 10ns that are liberated by
hydrochloric acid attack on the uranium
trifluorade.

A two-step oxidation reaction 1s,

and uranium trifluoride 1n the presence
of each other. A solution of 0.2 M
HF 1s added to the mixture and the
volume of hydrogen evolved from this
reaction, conducted at room tempera-
ture, i1s calculated as zirconium. A
solution of 9.6 M HCl 1s then added,
with boric acid, to complex excess
fluoride 10ons, and the volume of
hydrogen evolved upon heating 1s
calculated as uranium traifluorade.

reaction 1s of potential interest 1in
determining the oxide content of
fluoride mixtures.

type of reaction 1s shown in Fig. 14.1.
The reactor portion 1s designed so that
reaction pressures of up to the order
of 1 tsi1 can be permitted. The
remainder of the system consists of a
reagent transfer arrangement, in whaich
transfer may be made under vacuum, and
a high-vacuum system with the necessary
instrumentation for measuring the
oxygen liberated during the reaction.

Several samples of zirconium oxide
have been fluorinated with chromium
tri1fluoride 1n this equipment at
temperatures ranging from 200 to 300°C.
Analyses of the reaction residues
1ndicate that the experimental con-
ditions employed thus far have resulted
1n fluorinations that are at least 80%
complete, Efforts are being made to
obtain quantitative fluorination by
means of such promoters as uranium
dioxaide.

Fi1g. 14.1. Apparatus for Studying Reactions with Bromine Trifluoride

outgassing-with-helium step has been
included in the fuel preparation pro-
cedure. It 1s desired to test the
helium off-gas for hydrogen fluoraide
and to monitor the gas stream. The
most attractive means of attacking
this problem appears to be the measure-
ment of the conductaivity of the

174

scrubbing solutions through whaich the
gases are passed, This type of
analysis 1s rapid and has the added
advantage that 1t may be made at the
si1te of the experiment., Several
scrubbing solutions were studied, and
the most promising were calcium hy-
droxide and boric acid.
Calcium hydroxide reacts with hy-
drogen fluoride 1n the following manner

Ca** + 20H" + 2HF —> CaF, + 2H,0

and reduces the conductivity of the
solution by removaing hydroxyl 1ons.
Approximately 100 pg of hydrogen
fluoride reduced the conductivaity of
100 ml of 7 X 10°* N calcium hydroxide
solution by 7 X 10°¢® mho. A more
sensitive determination 1s possible 1f
boric acid 1s used as the scrubbing
solution. The reaction that occurs
between hydrogen fluoride and boric
acid 1s

H,BO, + 4HF —> H* + BF; + 3H,0 ,

1in which a strong acid (fluoboric) 1is
formed, therefore the highly mobile
hydrogen 1on 1s introduced 1nto the
system and the conductaivity 1s in-
creased. The concentration of the
boric acid solution should be very
dilute, 0.1 wt % or less, so that the
conductivity of the scrubbing solution
will be extremely low, of the order of
2 x 10°% mho. The conductivity of
100 ml of 3 X 10°3 M boric acid 1s
increased 13.5 X 10°% mho by the
addition of 100 ng of hydrogen fluoraide
- a change nearly twice that produced
by the same amount of hydrogen fluoride
1n calcium hydroxide solution., These
results show that conductivity measure-
ments are extremely sensitive and well

Corrosion Products (D, L. Manning,
Analytical Chemistry Division). Ex-
periments have been conducted to
ascertain the effects of molten
fluoride salt mixtures on Inconel and
other metallic containers. In these
experiments, the metal container that
has been exposed to fluorides 1s made
the anode 1n a sulfuric acid-citric
acid bath, Since the metals exist as
elements, they are electrolytically
dissolved and thereby separated from
the compounds present, A similar metal
tube 1s dissolved for comparative
purposes. The residues from the anodic
dissolution have been analyzed chemi-
cally and spectrographically. The
analytical methods used to date have
been unreliable because of flaking of
metal particles during dissolution,
Refinements i1n the electrode system
are being made to eliminate this
difficulty. Spectrographic data have
been collected for Inconel specimens
that were subjected to the standard
100-hr static corrosion test with
NaF-ZrF,-UF,, with and without addition
of zirconium hydride. The results are
given i1n Table 14.1.

The amount of the data collected 1s
insufficient topermit drawing definite
conclusions. Several points of
The

interest are evident, however.

PETROGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF FLUORIDES

G. D. White, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

Routine petrographic examinations
of more than 800 samples of fluoraide
mixtures were made 1n connection with
fuel i1nvestigations. Petrographic
examinations were made of compositions
1n the UC14-NaCl and UC1, -KC] systems.
The data obtained from these exami-
nations were correlated with the
thermal data to locate compound and
eutectic compositions,

UC1 ,-NaCl System In the UC1,-NaCl
binary system, two compounds were
found 2NaCl-UCl,, and a compound with
more than 50% UC1,, possibly NaCl-2UCl1,.
The latter compound seemed to have an
incongruent melting point, since
compositions on the high UCl, side of
the binary always contain considerable
amounts of free UCl,.

P. A. Agron
Materials Chemistry Division

The determination of the phases
present 1n solidified melts of various
compositions in the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system
has been helpful i1n elucidating the
paths of crystallization. The regions
of this ternary system that are rich
1n NaF have been examined during the
past quarter. Some progress has been
made here 1n definition of the ternary
and pseudobinary phase regions.

The petrographic and x-ray dif-
fraction 1dentification of the phases
found i1n the solid, upon melting given
compositions, are listed in Table 14.2.
The phases have been grouped according
to the similarities present in the
respective solidified melts, thus A-1
and A-2 represent one terhary area,
B-1 and B-2, the adjacent ternary
area, etc, This division i1into ternary
areas 1s 1n fair agreement with the
1sothermal contour plots (to be
published)., However, the anomalous
situation of four phases 1n samples
B-1 and D-2 obviously requires further
1investigation, Additional compositions
of these ternary areas should also be
1nvestigated before mapping the phase
boundaries.

The examination of a number of
fused solids along the composition line
joining NaUF, and Na,ZrF, appears to
1indicate a pseudobinary behavior.
Approximately 90% of the x-ray daf-
fraction pattern can be assigned to
these two phases. The cooling curves
of a series of these compositions (to
be published) i1ndicate a binary
eutectic at about 22.5 mole % UF,.

The behavior of salts along the
composition line between NaUF; and
NaZrF, 1s rather complex beyond 6

SERVICE CHEMICAL ANALYSES

A. F. Roemer, Jr.
Analytical Chemistry Division

Work in the ANP Analytical Chemistry
Laboratory during the period consisted
primarily of the analysis of alkala-
fluoride eutectic mixtures and zir-
conium fuels. Although there was a
slight decrease i1n the total number of
samples received during the quarter,
there was a significant i1ncrease 1n
the number of miscellaneous materials
recelved. Important among these was a
group of samples that were tested for
beryllium content. Included 1in the
group were large steel sections of
test rigs used to study the compati-
bility of NaK and beryllium oxide.
The specimens were first treated with
methanol to remove excess NaK and then
leached with hot, 50% sodium hydroxide
solutions to dissolve the beryllium
ox1de adhering to the surfaces of the
specimens. The beryllium content of
the alcoholic and caustic solutions
was determined colorimetrically, wath
p-nitrobenzeneazo-orcinol as the
chromogenic reagent,

A number of uranium tetrachloride
samples were analyzed for UO, and
UOCl,. Separation of UO, from the
salt was effected by refluxing portions
of the material with dilute ammonium
oxalate solution. The 1nsoluble UO2
was removed by filtration, dissolved
1in acid, and estimated quantitatively
by potentiometric titration with ferrac
sulfate. The UOCl,, along with any
UO,, was separated from the UCl, by
refluxing with anhydrous methyl
acetate. The 1nsoluble residue was
dissolved i1n dilute nitric acid, and
the UOCl, was calculated from a
volumetric determination of the
chloride content,

Comparative tests of phenylarsonic
acid and mandelic acid as precipitants
for zirconium were completed during
this period. Spectrographic exama-
nation of zirconium oxide residues
resulting from the a1gnition of pre-
cipitates of phenylarsonic acad
revealed the presence of significant
amounts of arsenic, antimony, and
1iron. Zirconium oxide from mandelic
acid precipitations was found to con-
tain only traces of silicon. The use
of mandelic acid as the precipitant
resul ted 1n much better separations
from interfering 1ons and, i1naddition,
a considerable saving 1n time. By the
use of this reagent during the latter
part of the gquarter, a marked reduction
1in the number of duplicate determa-
nations was effected, and a consider-
able 1ncrease 1n the accuracy of this
determination was attalned.

Of the 784 samples reported during
the period, 65% were submitted by the
ANP Reactor Chemistry Group and 27% by
the Experimental Engineering Group.
Over 7000 determinations were made
during the quarter, a fourth of which
were made on nonroutine samples.
