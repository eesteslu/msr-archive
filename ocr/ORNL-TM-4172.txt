ABSTRACT

Corrosion of type 304L stainless steel and Hastelloy N was
studied in gaseous mixtures of BF3, air, and argon at 600, 300,
and 200°C. 1In some tests the alloy specimens and gases were in
contact with molten fluoride mixtures. At 600°C under air,
specimens of both alloys were completely destroyed in both fuel
salt and fluoroborate salt mixtures. No significant weight
changes were measured for Hastelloy N immersed in salt exposed
to argon or BF3, but type 304L stainless steel lost weight under
the same conditions. This weight loss was greater under BF3;
than under argon and greater in the fluoroborate mixture than
in the fuel salt. With no salt immersion, the various gases
produced very small changes in the alloys at 200°C. Also with
no salt, only small changes were noted at 300 and 600°C for
Hastelloy N in any gas and for the stainless steel in air. At
600°C, large quantities of chromium and iron oxides were pro-
duced on the stainless steel by the air-BFj; mixture and large
amounts of unidentified corrosion products by BF3, argon-BFs,
and argon-air. Drying the argon decreased the amount of cor-
rosion. Hastelloy N was more resistant than type 304L stain-
less steel to corrosion by the gases tested in these experiments.

 

INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, increased interest has been shown in the use
of a sodium fluoroborate mixture, NaBF,—8 mole % NaF, as a coolant in a
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor. The physical properties of the salt mixture

have been determined' and many experimem:sz"12 have been undertaken to

ascertain the corrosion of various alloys in this salt. The use of this
mixture in a high-temperature environment is somewhat complicated by the

fact that the NaBF, dissociates by the reaction

NaBF, = NaF + BF3(g) ,

and the effect of the BF; gas must be considered. The equilibrium pressure

above a melt of NaBF,—8 mole % NaF as a function of temperature is given by

log P = 9,024 — 5920/T(°K)

The maximum design temperature for the coolant salt mixture is 621°C, and
this corresponds to a partial pressure of BF3; of 252 torr. Because of the

appreciable vapor pressure of BF; at operating temperatures, cover gases

BACKGROUND DATA

An early report on corrosion experiments with gaseous boron tri-
fluoride®® noted that the BF; reacted rapidly with traces of moisture to
give hydroxyfluoboric acid (HBF3OH) and HF. It also showed that BF3; and
glass reacted at an appreciable rate just above 200°C. Under the condi-
tions of those experiments, there was no appreciable attack by BF3; on any
metal or alloy examined at temperatures up to 200°C.

A systematic study of the compatibility of Hastelloy N with BFj3; had
not been undertaken before this study, but several observations indicated
possible compatibility problems. These observations were often made in the
course of experiments where compatibility was not the primary objective,
and the results are difficult to interpret. However, these miscellaneous
obeervations do contribute to our understanding of metal-BFj;-moisture
reactions.

1% BF; contacted chromium metal (a consti-

In one experimental program
in almost all alloys considered for use in a molten salt system) 60 hr at
650°C. The chromium sample gained weight (about 4%), and the weight gain
showed a linear dependence on the square root of the reaction time. The
surface of the chromium sample contained substantial quantities of Cr;03
and minor quantities of CrF,;~CrF;. Thus, commercially available BF; did
promote the oxidation of pure chromium.

In all Hastelloy N thermal convection loop tests>" that have

involved the fluoroborate mixture, specimens have been placed in the vapor

space above the hot and cold leg surge tanks to provide some data on the
compatibility of BF3 with Hastelloy N. The vapor space contained about
220 torr BF; and 5 psig He. Since the mass transfer rates in these
systems were quite dependent on salt purity, which varied from loop to
loop, the weight changes of the specimens exposed to the vapor (Table 1)
are scattered. However, in none of the cases were the losses excessive.
Based on uniform removal of all alloy constituents, the maximum corrosion
rate was 0.04 mil/year.

In another experiment Hastelloy N specimens were exposed to static
BF3; vapor for 6800 hr at 605°C in capsules that contained the fluoroborate
mixture.® The BFj; pressure was varied in each capsule. Table 2 shows
the measured weight changes. The weight changes were quite small, and no
composition changes were noted in any of the specimens.

Another experience with BF3; involved a pump loop (PKP-1), which was
used to test a molten-salt pump with the fluoroborate mixture.?®21% An
Inconel 600 bubbler tube, which had been used for BF3; addition and salt
level indication, had been in service 11,567 hr and was suspected to have
become plugged just before the loop shutdown. During most of the test
program the total gas flow rate was 370 cm®/min. The gas was He—13.5 vol %
BF3. The outside of the tube was exposed to the fluoroborate mixture at
550°C. After removal from the loop, examination disclosed a plug at the
bottom of the inside of the tube. Above the plug, in order, were a thin
black film, a gray thin deposit with a sprinkling of green particles, a
bright green deposit, and finally green material covered with magnetic
powder. The green deposit was Na3CrFg, and the magnetic mixture was
equivalent to NizFe. Figure 1 shows a cross section of the tubing wall
near the liquid-gas interface. We saw a zone of metallic crystals on the
inner surface to a thickness of approximately 20 mils. 1In view of the
apparent loss of wall thickness in this area, these crystals probably

represent vestiges of the original metal surface. Figure 2 shows a higher

to corroborate that the crystals are a result of material leaving the sur-
face rather than material deposition. The material on the inside of the
tube above the liquid level appeared to be the result of attack by water-
derived impurities in the BFj.

On removing the pump rotary element from the loop and dismantling the
various pump components, Smith!? found that the inner heat baffle plates
had been severely attacked, as evidenced by holes in some places and by
severe pitting in other placeé. The attack was not homogeneous on any one

plate or constant from one plate to another. The top surface of the top

the chamber above the top plate (shaft, inner surface of impeller housing
support cylinder, and lower surface of the cooling o0il chamber) were
relatively free of attack. All baffle plates except the one below the top
plate had holes corroded completely through. The inner heat baffles fitted
very tightly against the inner surface of the upper impeller housing sup-
port cylinder, so that probably most of the gas flow was past the inner
annulus between the baffle plate and the pump shaft. The attack was attri-
buted to the intimate contact of purge gas (or more correctly, the moisture
in the purge gas) with puddles of salt that lay on the baffle surfaces.

We believe that the temperature in this region was 280°C or less, so the
water—-salt reaction products appear to be highly corrosive even at rela-
tively low temperatures.

Because of the findings in this pump bowl and other questions concern-
ing the role of BF3; in corrosion of alloys, we felt that the compatibility
of BF3 and various gas mixtures with candidate alloys for molten salt use
should be studied systematically. As a first test, we exposed type 304L
stainless steel and Hastelloy N to argon, air, BF3;, and mixtures of these

for 100 hr at temperatures from 200 to 600°C.

RESULTS OF THE CURRENT EXPERIMENTS

The reaction chamber was a 30-in. length of 2-in. IPS nickel pipe,
mounted horizontally in a 3-in. tube furnace. The reacting gases were
admitted through a penetration in the end plate that was welded to one
end of the pipe. Sheathed thermocouples also penetrated the end plate
and extended into the central region on the heated zone. Several thermo-
couples were attached along the outside of the nickel pipe. The other
end of the reaction chamber, which extended some 10 in. out of the tube
furnace, was closed by Teflon in a threaded pipe cap. The gas manifold
system provided for the introduction of helium, BF3, argon, air, or mix-
tures of these gases at known flow rates into the reaction chamber. The
system was sealed from the atmosphere by bubbling the gas effluent through

a fluorocarbon oil. Metal samples were carried in nickel boats inserted
through the threaded access port. 1In several runs, metal specimens were
placed with a fuel salt, LiF—20 mole 7 BeF,—11l.7 mole % ThF4—0.3 mole %
UFy, or a coolant salt, NaBF4—8 mole % NaF, in the nickel boats. The tests
lasted 100 hr, and the gas flow rate was 100 cm®/min. The metal specimens
were approximately 0.75 x 0.375 X 0.030 in. and weighed about 1 g. Speci-
mens were weighed before and after each test, and reaction products were
analyzed whenever possible. The nominal amounts of the major alloying
constituents of Hastelloy N and type 304L stainless steel are given in

Table 3.

Table 4 gives the results for the metal-salt combinations exposed to
various gases at 600°C for 100 hr.

As was expected, air in combination with the fluoride salts produced
highly corrosive conditions, which destroyed not only the specimens but
the nickel boats. None of the weight changes measured for the Hastelloy N
immersed in salt and exposed to any of the gas mixtures other than air
were significant. For the stainless steel specimens immersed in salt,

BF3; gas caused more attack than argon. A larger moisture content in the
BF; probably caused the greater attack. The fluoroborate mixture was
more aggressive toward the stainless steel than the fuel salt. Weight
losses rather than weight gains occurred because the corrosion products
were dissolved from the specimens by the salt.

Table 5 gives the results for alloys exposed to the various gas
mixtures without salt at temperatures from 200 to 600°C for 100 hr. 1In
most cases, weight gains were found, since the corrosion products remained

on the specimens and were not carried away.

For Hastelloy N, the only significant changes measured at 600°C were
in the mixtures containing air. This effect can be attributed to too
small an amount of chromium in the Hastelloy to provide good resistance to
air oxidation. At 200 and 300°C, all changes were rather small.

For the stainless steel at 600°C, the air-BF; mixture produced a
large amount of chromium and iron oxides, which is shown in Fig. 3(b).

The stainless steel specimen from which the oxides in Fig. 3(b) had been
removed is shown in Fig. 3(c), and a relatively unaffected stainless steel
specimen that had been exposed to air at 200°C is shown in Fig 3(a). By
itself, BF3 at 600°C also produced a large amount of corrosion product on
the stainless steel and was more aggressive than argon. Significant
weight gains of the stainless steel specimens were produced at 300°C and
600°C by all gas mixtures except air. At 200°C, most changes were rather
small. Reaction of the stainless steel with argon, air, and an argon-BFj;
mixture resulted in a red corrosion product on the surface, whereas
reaction with BFj3 by itself resulted in the formation of white material

on the surface. These red and white corrosion products could not be

identified by x-ray analysis but contained iron, chromium, oxygen, and,
where BF; was involved, fluorine. Thus, the corrosion products were
probably complex mixtures of metal oxides and perhaps fluorides.

The use of drier argon (2 ppm moisture as opposed to 24 ppm) lowered
the weight gain of the stainless steel specimens by about one-half. The
effect of moisture was more dramatic when the gas was an argon-BF:; mixture
(Table 5).

Even though air had almost no effect on the stainless steel, the
air-BF3 mixture had the worst effect of any of the gases, much worse than
just BF3. The air in combination with argon also produced more corrosion
products than either of the two gases by themselves. In combination with
salt, BF3 had the worst effect. These results underline the problems that
can result in a system that allows air and/or moisture to come in contact
with molten fluoride salts or with the BFj3; vapor.

Except in air at 600°C, Hastelloy N was much more resistant to

corrosion than the type 304L stainless steel.

CONCLUSIONS

1. At 600°C, air completely destroyed Hastelloy N and type 304L
stainless steel specimens that were immersed in either a fuel salt or the
fluoroborate coolant mixture.

2. No significant weight changes were measured for Hastelloy N
immersed in salt exposed to argon or BF3 at 600°C, but type 304L stainless
steel lost weight.

3. For the stainless steel immersed in salt, the BFj3; gas was more
corrosive than the argon.

4, Stainless steel weight'losses were larger in the fluoroborate
mixture than in the fuel salt.

5. At 200°C, the various gases produced very small changes in the
alloys.

6. At 300 and 600°C, only small changes were noted in the Hastelloy N
specimens.

7. Small changes were noted in the stainless steel exposed to air at
300°C, but large amounts of corrosion products were produced by BF3,

argon-BF3, air-BF3;, and argon-air.
14

8. At 600°C, the air-BF; mixture produced large quantities of
chromium oxide and iron oxide on the stainless steel; also large amounts
of corrosion products were produced by BF3, argon-BF;, and argon-air.

9. Drying the argon decreased the amount of corrosion.

10. Hastelloy N is more resistant to corrosion by the gases tested

in this experiment than type 304L stainless steel.
