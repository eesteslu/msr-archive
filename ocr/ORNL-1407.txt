FOREWORD

The Atomic Energy Commission requires that a Reactor Hazards Summary Report
be submitted and approved prior to the operation of a new reactor or to the
modification of an existing reactor in order to determine, and thus assure, the
safety of its various reactor projects. In accordance with USAEC-OR-RDV-1,
Reactor Safety Determination, this report describes the hazards that may con-
ceivably be associated with the aircraft reactor experiment, All possible
types of hazards are described as well as the extent to which these hazards
have been evaluated and considered in the design and proposed operation of the
reactor. The text is presented in summary form, and the detailed supporting
material may be found in the appendixes or in the various references.

SUMMARY REPORT

INTRODUCTION

The aircraft reactor experiment
is aproposed medium power (3-megawatt)
reactor designed primarily to test the
feasibility of fluid-fuel, high-
temperature, high-power-density
reactors for aircraft. In such
reactors the heat 1s carried from
the reactor core by the fuel itself,
thus eliminating the need for large
heat transfer surfaces within the
active lattice. This, 1n turn,
reduces the amount of foreign material
in the core and thus reduces the
critical mass and size of the reactor.

To make such a reactor feasible
the liquid fuel must have the following
characteristics:

1. The liquid must contain suf-
ficient uranium for criticality.

2. No elements of high cross
section can be present.

3. The melting point must be
safely below the lowest design temper-
ature.

4. The vapor pressure must be low
at the highest design temperature.

5. The viscosity must be low
throughout the design temperature
range.

6. The coefficient of thermal
expansion must be large.

7. The heat transfer properties
(specific heat, thermal conductivity,
and heat transfer coefficient) must
be favorable.

8. The material must be stable
under radiation at the design temper-
ature and otherwise-suitable structural
metals must be able to serve as
container materials.

9., The fuel must be amenable to
simple chemical reprocessing.

Additional advantages may be
obtained if the liquid fuel contains
sufficient light elements to make it
sel f-moderating.

Several fluoride salt combinations
have been prepared that fulfill the
above requirements more or less
satisfactorily. The one that best
meets the requirements, at present,
is the system NaF-ZrF-UF,, with a mole
per cent composition of 50-46-4,
respectively.

The reactor incorporating this
fuel, together with a beryllium-oxide
moderator in an Inconel structure, 1is
designed for short-time operation,
during which such characteristics as
controllability, temperature coef-
ficient and stability, and corrosion
under radiation will be studied. The
primary purpose of the reactor 1is to
obtain data on the reactor system,
The various components of the system
such as pumps, seals, valves, and
instrumentation have already been
tested, independently, with the
fluoride fuel mixture, but they must
be tested in an actual reactor as an
integrated unit to finally prove that
such a system 1s feasible.

A summary of the design data for
the reactor is contained 1in the
following tabulation. A separate
report{!? containing the detailed
design philosophy, calculations, and
description has been issued.

THE REACTOR AND ITS OPERATION

SITE OF THE AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

The aircraft reactor experiment has
been located at a site 0.75 mile
southeast of the center of the present
ORNL area, which places it about
0.24 mile northeast of the homogeneous
reactor experiment, Fig. 1., The
reactor experiment 1s near the center
of a valley that is approximately
4 miles long and 0,5 mile wide. This
valley is parallel to and separated
from Bethel Valley by Haw Ridge. As
1s typical of the valleys and ridges
on the East Tennessee plateau west
of the Great Smoky Mountains, the
axls of the valley is oriented north-
east and southwest. The Clinch River
terminates both ends of the valley,
as well as forming a natural boundary
on an approximately 2-mile radius to
the southeast of the site.

The valley is unoccupied except
for the nearby homogeneous reactor
experiment, Between the site of the
alrcraft reactor experiment (ele-
vation, 840 ft) and Bethel Valley,
containing ORNL (elevation, 820 ft),
1s Haw Ridge, which averages 980 ft
in elevation, This ridge is con-
tinuous except for a narrow break
known as White Oak Creek Gap (elevation,
770 ft) through which a portion of
Bethel Valley drainage flows. This
gap 1s about 0.65 mile west-southwest
of the site and, in view of the local
weather conditions, does not signi-
ficantly decrease the natural pro-
tection afforded to ORNL by the
intervening ridge. To the south and
east of the site is a large area of
high and rough terrain that extends
to the Clinch River. This terrain
includes Copper Ridge, which forms
the 1mmediate southeast border of the
valley, and Melton Hill, the highest
(1356 ft) point in the surrounding
area.

Within a radius of 1.9 miles, all
the land 1s owned by the AEC and 1is
already a security controlled (that
is, fenced and patrolled) area. Within
a 2.3-mile radius, there is approxi-
mately 0.3 square mile of farm land
that 1s not AEC owned or controlled.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REACTOR EXPERIMENT

The aircraft reactor experiment (ARE)
consists essentially of a high-tempera-
ture (1500°F), intermediate ~power
(1 to 3 megawatts), circulating-fuel
reactor and the associated pumps,
heat transfer equipment, controls,
and instrumentation required for safe
operation. A schematic arrangement of
the reactor system is shown in Fig. 2.
The major functional parts of the
system are discussed separately below,
except for the off-gas disposal system
and the reactor control and safety
devices, which are described in separate
sections.,

Core Design. The ARE reactor
assembly consists of an Inconel
pressure shell in which beryllium
oxide moderator and reflector blocks
are stacked and through which pass
fuel tubes, reflector cooling tubes,
and control assemblies. Elevation
and plan sections of this reactor are
shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The innermost
region of the lattice 1s the core,
which 1s a cylinder approximately
3 ft 1n diameter and 3 ft long. The
core 1s divided into six 60-deg
sectors, each of which 1ncludes one
serpentine fuel-tube coil that passes
through 11 stacks in series, as
illustrated. The six serpentine coils
are connected in parallel by means
of external manifolds.

A reflector with a nominal thickness
of 7.5 in. is located between the
pressure shell and the cylindrical
surface of the core. The reflector

consists of beryllium oxide blocks
similar to the moderator blocks but
with 0.5-in. holes for the passage of
the reflector coolant., The reflector
coolant (NaK) is admitted at one end
of the pressure shell, passes through
the reflector, bathes the pressure
shell, fills the moderator interstices,
and exits at the other end of the
pressure shell.

Fluid Circuit. Circulation of both
the fuel and NaK 1s obtained by
packed-seal centrifugal pumps, and flow
rates of 84 gpm are realized. The
reactor heat 1s abstracted from the
circulating-fuel outside the core by
means of four fuel-to-helium heat
exchangers, each capableof dissipating
750 kw, through which the fuel 1is
circulated. The helium is then cooled
by passing i1t through four helium-
to-water heat exchangers, and the hot
water 1s discharged. The Nak 1s
cooled by a comparable NaK-to-helium-
to-water heat exchange system.

Helium flow rates in the fuel-to-
helium heat exchanger are controlled
by variable-speed hydraulic systems
that drive the helium blowers. Control
of the helium flow rate in this manner
permits smooth control of reactor
power at any reactor temperature for
which the nuclear controls are set,
within the capacity of the heat
removal system. At very low powers
the temperature of the helium passing
through the fuel heat exchanger closely
approaches the fuel temperature. At
design conditions, the helium will be
heated and cooled 500°F (that is,
between 250 and 750°F) as it passes
through the sets of heat exchangers.
The system 1s designed so that when
the rate of power generation 1is equal
to or less than the power loss through
insulation, electrically heated

helium passes through the fuel-to-

helium heat exchanger. The fluid
circuit flow sheet is shown in Fig. 5,
together with the design condition
values of temperature, pressure, and

flow.

Monitoring and Preheating Systems.
Leakage monitoring of both the fuel
and NaK systems is effected by the
use of double-walled pipes that
provide an annulus through which
helium is pumped on all lines and com-
ponents containing fuel or reflector
coolant, The helium pumping head is
maintained by drawing helium from
the syst'em, cooling it, and admitting
1t to rotary-type compressors at
various points in the system. Moni-
toring for fluoride leaks into the
helium is achieved by passing helium
samples through halogen detectors.

The relatively high melting point of
the circulating fuel (around 500°C

for the NaF-ZrF, -UF, fuel with a
composition in mole per cent of 50-
46-4) requires that all equipment with-
in which this coolant would be cir-
culated be heated to permit loading,
unloading, and also the possibility of
low-power operation. Preheating, as
well as the addition of heat during
low-power operation, will be accom-
plished by means of electrical heaters
attached to all components of the
fuel and NaK systems, thatis, pressure
shell, heat exchanger, pumps, tanks,
and the outer pipe of the double-
walled fuel and NaK piping. Within
the piping, the helium flow in the
annulus acts as a heat conveyer and
transports heat to sections that are
not directly in contact with heaters.

Fuel Fill and Dump System. The
fuel carrier, NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %),
1s first loaded into fill tanks
provided in a shielded pit adjacent
to the reactor and heat exchanger pits.
This molten salt 1s forced into the
fuel system by helium pressure. The
uranium-bearing fuel component,
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-25-25 mole %), 1is
then added by the fuel-enrichment
system (cf., section on shim control
under “Reactor Control and Safety
Devices’”) the composition of the
ultimate fuel, that is, the enriched
mixture plus the carrier, will be
somewhere in the neighborhood of
50-46-4 mole % of NaF-ZrF,-UF,. The
precise composition will be determined
by the critical loading of the reactor,
At the conclusion of the experiment,
or as a result of a reactor scram, the
fuel can be dumped into a special
tank designed to be subcritical when
filled with the dumped fuel. At the
time the fuel carrier is loaded to
the reactor system, the valves to the
then empty fuel-carrier fill tanks
will be sealed so that the enriched
fuel cannot accidentally be dumped
into these tanks. The design of all
the tanks has provided for heat
addition to maintain the fuel mixture
in a molten condition and, 1n the case
of the fuel dump tank, for removing
the afterheat evolved within dumped
fuel after power operation,
Instrumentation. Since a basic
purpose of the aircraft reactor experi-
ment is the acquisition of experimental
data, the importance of complete and
reliable instrumentation cannot be
overemphasized. Most ARE process
instrumentation is intended to observe
and record rotational speeds, flow
rates, temperatures, pressures, or
liquid levels. The values of tempera-
ture, pressure, and flow at various
stations around the ARE fluid circuits
are shown in Fig. 5. Most commercially
avallable equipment for performing
these functions 1s limited to tempera-

tures conslderable lower than the
minimum operating temperature of the

ABRE and employs open lines in which
the ZrF, vapor would condense and plug
the tubes. Accordingly, a bellows
type of device 1s employed as the
pressure indicator, and a fluid-
immersed inductance type of instrument
has been developed for measuring flow
and liquid level.¢!’ Conventional
Chromel -Alumel thermocouples located
in wells are used to determine tempera-
ture.

SUMMARY REPORT

Building. The ARE building 1is a
mill type of structure designed to
house the ARE and the necessary facili-
ties for its operation. The building
has a full basement 80 by 105 ft, a
crane bay 42 by 105 ft, and a one-
story service wing 38 by 105 feet.
The reactor and the necessary heat
disposal systems are located in
shielded pits in the part of the
basement serviced by the crane. One
half of the main floor area 1s open
to the reactor and heat exchanger pits
in the basement below; the other one
half houses the control room, office
space, shops, and change rooms.

In one half of the basement are
shielded reactor and heat exchanger
pits; the other one half of the base-
ment 1s service area. 1The control
room, office space, and some shops
are located on the first floor over
the service area. The first floor
does not extend over the one half of
the basement that contains the pits.
The crane is a floor-operated, 10-ton,
bridge crane having a maximum lift
of 25 ft above the main floor level.
Plan and elevation drawings of the
building are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

The entire reactor system 1s con-
tained in three interconnected pits:
one for the reactor, another for the
heat exchangers and pumps, and a third
for the fuel dump tanks. These pits,
which are sealed at the top by shielding
blocks, are located in a large crane
bay of the building. The crane bay
is separated from the control room and
offices, and the heating and air
conditioning systems maintain the
control room at a slightly higher
pressure than the crane bay.

OFF-GAS DISPOSAL SYSTEM

The off-gas disposal system provides
for the collection, holdup, and con-
trolled discharge of the radioactive,
volatile, fission products that may
be evolved as a consequence of reactor
operation. In addition to keeping

the normal release of radioactive
gases within the maximum permissible
concentration (MPC), the system will
perform a similar function in the
event of certain catastrophies (cf.,
chapter on ““Reactor Hazards’). 1t is
assumed throughout the discussion of
the off-gas system that all of the
volatile fission products that are
created will evolve from the fuel and
be discharged through the system.
This 1s not the case, however, and
preliminary experiments with a static
fuel mixture have shown that only a
small fraction (2.5% or less) of the
Xe'35% will evolve from the mixture.(?)

Description of System. A helium
atmosphere 1s maintained over the
surge tanks 1n the fuel system and the
fuel dump tanks. This helium gas,
which will contain the volatile
fission products (Br, I, Xe, and
lhﬂ,(a)passes through a NaK vapor
trap (where the Br and I are removed),
then into two holdup tanks (to permit
the decay of Xe and Kr), following
which the gases are released up the
stack. However, the release of gases
to the stack 1s dependent upon the
following conditions: (1) the wind
velocity 1s greater than 5 mph and
(2) the activity, sensed by a monitor,
is less than an established maximum
value. The monitor 1s located between
the two storage tanks, which are
connected 1n series. Provision 1is
also made to exhaust the reactor pits
through the holdup tanks inthe off-gas
system at a rate of 27 cfm (the limit
of the exhaust system). The off-gas
system 1s shown schematically in
Fig. 8.

With a static helium atmosphere in
the surge and dump tanks, the volumetric
flow rate of fission gases 1s a
maximum of 0.0014 cfm. In order to
have a measurable flow of gas, the
fission gases are mixed with a fixed

air bleed of 10 cfm between the first
holdup tank and the monitors. The
minimum flow rate past the monitors
then is 10 c¢fm and the maximum 37
cfm (that 1s, 10 cfm from the fixed
air bleed plus 27 cfm if the room is
being exhausted at the same time).
The monitor setting can then be based
on the premise that the flow 1s 37
cfm and the setting will be conservative
by a factor of 3.7:1 when the minimum
flow rate prevails.

The second holdup tank is placed
between the monitors and the stack
valve to increase the gas transit time
between the monitor and the valve
to ensure that the valve has time to
close after the monitor signals the
presence of excess activity.

Maximum Activity of Stack Gases.
The maximum activity of the stack
gases has been calculated, with the
assumption that the average energy
of disintegration 1is equal to 1
Mev.(3) The design of the off-gas
system includes two vacuum pumps that
deliver a maximum of 27 cfm and a
blower that discharges 10 cfm, giving
a total of 37 c¢fm maximum discharge
through the monitor. The maximum
permissible ground concentration for
the 1-Mev fission-product activity is

MPC = 1.6 x 10-5 uc/cm®. (%)

At 37 cfm or 1.05 % 10°% cm®/min and
with a permissible activity discharge
rate 0f0.832 curie/min, which produces
the above MPC, the activity per cubic
centimeter should not exceed

0.832
1.05 x 10°

as determined by the radiation monitor.
The monitors that control thepositions
of the stack valve will be set to
prevent discharge as soon as the
activity of the gas rises above a
predetermined level.

The discharge rate of xenon and
krypton fission products to the
atmosphere must be such that the
activity is within the above limit.
The effective system holdup, before
the monitors, is 11.4 ft3 or 3.53 x 10°
cm?® (the volume of one tank plus
piping). If it can be assumed that
the decay time of the fission products
is equal to the system volume divided
by the flow rate, the total energy at
a particular time can be calculated.
This energy must be converted to
disintegrations per unit time by
considering effective energy changes
in relation to the variation of
1sotoplic concentrations with time.
The values of permissible and calcu-
lated stack activity have been plotted
in Fig. 9, together with the per-
missible discharge rate, as determined
by the National Committee on Radiation
protection. (*) It will be noted
that at 8500 min of holdup, corre-
sponding to a discharge rate of 20.8
cm®/min through each restrictor, the
ground tolerance will not be exceeded.

Normal Discharge from the Surge
Tank. The maximum pressure within
the surge tank is limited by a 5-psig
pressure regulator in the gas supply
system. The maximum discharge rate
from the surge tank 1s limited by a
Bourdon restrictor to 20 cm®/min with

SUMMARY REPORT

a 5-psi pressure differential. Avg
this flow rate through each of two
restrictors, the holdup volume of the
system 1is such that 1t will allow
sufficient decay time, as required by
the akove calculation, to permit the
discharge of the off-gas directly up
the stack. The change of effective
energy owing to the persistence of the
longer lived 1sotopes has been accounted
for when considering ground concen-
tration of this gas.

Gas Vented from the Fuel Dump Tank
During Dumping. In considering waste
gases from the surge tanks it has
been assumed that all gaseous products
escape into the surge tanks during
operation. Actually, it 1is expected
that some portion of the fission-
product gases will remain in the fuel
and that some fraction of this portion
will be released when the fuel 1is
admitted to the hot-fuel dump tank.
When fuel is admitted to the fuel
dump tank it is expected that helium
will be displaced at a rate of the
order of 5 c¢fm. This helium, after
passing through the NaK scrubber and
the first holdup tank, will be admitted
to the monitors. Should the monitors
sense excess activity, the stack valve
will prevent discharge and the vacuum
pumps will permit recirculation
through the holdup tanks and monitors.

REACTOR CONTROL AND SAFETY DEVICES

Most of the control and safety
features of the ARE are similar, and
in many cases 1identical, to those of
certain reactors now in operation, The
nuclear instrumentation (such as
fission chambers and ion chambers) and
the electronic components (such as
preamplifiers and power amplifiers)
are copies of similar instruments and
gear in use on other reactors (MTR,
LITR, etc.). However, since the
fission chambers will be located in a
high-temperature region within the
reactor reflector, special high-
temperature chambers have been de-
veloped; helium cooling will be used
to keep them within a safe temperature
range. Alternate electrical power
systems are provided so that none of
the safety mechanisms can become
paralyzed by a simple power failure in
any one system,

There are three separate parts to
the control system: fuel shim control,
regulating system, and safety system.
The motor speed and gear ratio are
regulated so that safety rod with-
drawal cannot add Ak/k at a rate
greater than 0.015%/sec (that is,
0.005%/sec per rod). The regulating
rod can be inserted or withdrawn to
change Ak/k at a rate of 0,1%/sec.
The movement of this rod will be set
to provide a maximum change in Ak/k of
0.4% (approximately one dollar for
steady-state fuel circulation) between
the positions of maximum inserted and
fully withdrawn. The fuel loading
system cannot inject fuel at a greater
rate than that which would increase
the reactivity at arate of 0.013%/sec.

SUMMARY REPORT

These features are inherent 1in the
design of the control system; further-
since these three divisions
perform distinctive functions and
since each 1s almost, if not entirely
autonomous, each will be discussed
separately in the following.

Numerous automatic, as well as
optional, safety features are in-
corporated into the control system.
The automatic features scram the
reactor when activated; the optional
features warn the operator of potential
troubles. The specific situations for
each case are listed below. For every
scram the interlocks of the system are
such that the helium flow in the fuel
heat exchangers is cut off by opening
the electrical circuits to the motors.
This action is necessary to prevent fuel
from freezing in the heat exchangers.

more,

Automatic Scram Signals. For
certain instrument signals themagnetic
clutches holding the shim rods auto-
matically release the rods to fall and

scram the reactor. These signals are

the following:
l. reactor outlet temperature, upper
limit, 1550°F,

2. fuel heat exchanger outlet temper-
ature, lower limit, 1100°F,

3. one second fast period,

4. wupper limit on flux, equivalent to
reactor power of 4500 kw,

5. fuel flow stoppage.

In addition, a 5-sec period inserts
the shim rods, which decreases Ak/k at
a rate of 0.015%/sec.

Optional Scram Signals. There are
certain optional scrams that have not
been made automatic for two reasons;
namely, the sensory signals usually
have already lagged the event to such
an extent that a fast scram cannot
provide better protection than an
optional or delayed scram, and second,
reaction to these signals requires
limited judgment. To build judgment
into the equipment would complicate
the instrumentation unnecessarily. For
each case requiring the exercise of

23
ARE HAZARDS

limited judgment the equipment sounds

an alarm and annunciates to draw the

operator’'s attention to the possible
difficulty.

The following signals are provided
for the optional scram:

1. pronounced changes in differential
temperatures between reactor
outlet tubes (described in section
on ‘“Reactor Hazards”),

2. lowering level in any surge tank,

3. rising level in any surge tank,

4, alarm from a G-E halogen detector,

5. alarm from a radiation monitor,

6. lower limit on steady-state fuel-
flow indicator,

7. lower limit (1150°F) on fuel
outlet temperatures in fuel heat
exchangers,

8. oxygen concentration in pits,

9. humidity in the pits.

Shim Control. The reactor will be
made critical only after the fuel-
carrying liquid (NaF-ZrF,, 50-50 mole
%) has been brought up to a tempera-
ture of approximately 1200°F., The
liquid in the entire primary loop will
then be maintained at as nearly a
constant temperature as can be provided
by the external heating system. After
the system has been checked for leaks
and found to be tight, a fluoride
mixture (NaF-ZrF, -UF,, 50-25-25 mole %)
containing enriched uranium (93.4%
U?3% will be injected into the primary
fluid to bring the reactor to critical
at the temperature of 1200°F, This
technique for fuel enrichment comprises
the shim control of the reactor and is
designed only to add uranium to the
carrier; there is no plan to try to go
subcritical by fuel depletion.

The fuel enrichment operation 1is
accomplished by means of the mechanism
shown in Fig, 10. A small fuel line
first carries the fuel from the storage
tank to the transfer tank and thence
to the pump inlet. Injection of the
fuel at the pump inlet assures mixing
of enriched fuel and carrier. The
enriched fuel 1s held in the trans-

24

fer tank, where it is weighed, and when
the gas pressure over the liquid in the
tank is raised, fuel is forced through
the connecting line into the system at
the pump. The transfer tank i1s hung
from a beam balance so that an accurate
determination of the weight of fuel
is directly obtainable.

This method of fuel addition
permits the addition of known amounts
of fuel, and the magnitude of these
guantities can be controlled over a
considerable range as a critical
loading is approached. By introducing
the fuel into the circulating system
just before the liquid enters the
reactor, safe loading of the system is
assured. Should a slight excess of
fuel be added to part of the fuel
stream, the reactor would give an
indication of supercriticality when
the enriched liquid entered thelattice
and before the uranium concentration
of the entire fuel circuit had been
increased, If this occurred, the
fuel addition could be stopped and
subsequent mixing of the supercharged
ligquid with subcritical fuel would
lower the reactivity.

Regulating System. The reason for
providing a mechanical regulating
system is that the magnitude of the
reactivity change effected by the
expansion of the fuel cannot be
accurately predetermined. To supple-
ment the negative temperature co-
efficient, incase itis of insufficient
magnitude, a single absorber rod
having a total value of approximately
0.40% Ak/k is provided in the center
of the reactor, The maximum insertion
rate is 0.1% Ak/k per second.

The absorber rod is located in a
3-in.-~-dia hole that runs through the
pressure shell and core in the center
of the lattice. By means of a direct
drive, a 2-in.-dia boron absorber rod
is inserted into this hole. Since the
regulating rod will run within the
core while the reactor is running at
full power, the rod must be cooled.

ARE HAZARDS

This is accomplished by the forced
circulation of helium down and around
the rod in a closed loop.

The regulating rod is moved by a 200-
watt, 60-cycle, reversible motor of
constant speed that is either manually
or automatically actuated. For manual
operation the motor is energized by a
zero-position, momentary-contact,
reversing switch located on the operat-
ing console, Manual adjustments are
used during the critical experiment,
during the rod calibration operation,
and ifdesired during the power regime,
For automatic operation, the motor is
energized from a control error signal
derived from neutron fluxmeasurements,
from the reactor mean temperature, or
from a linear combination of the two
signals. The automatic system can be
operated only when a reasonable power
(greater than 300,000 kw) is being drawn
from the reactor,

The servo system is arranged so that
the reactivity changes introduced by the
regulating rod behave like a negative
temperature coefficient associatedwith
the fuel. When the regulating rod 1is
connected to the servo drive and temper-
ature or flux perturbations are intro-
duced into the reactor, control of the
reactor will be accomplished.

During normal operation of the
reactor, when power changes are being
made at a slow rate, the reactor will
be manually controlled. Improper
manipulation of the manual control,
which would result in getting the
reactor on too short a period, 1is
safeguarded by the cocked safety
system plus the coefficient of re-
activity associated with the expanding
fuel. Precautions in the form of
limit switches, interlocks, alarms,
etc,, 1n accordance with previous
reactor installations, are provided
to further minimize the opportunity
for improper manipulation of the manual
control.

The regulating rod drives are
located on the concrete slab directly

26

over the reactor and are accessible
to personnel at all times. The rod
linkage goes through holes in the con-
crete slab and provides means for
positioning the absorber portion of
the rod in the center hole provided in
the reactor.

Safety System. Three safety rods
for the ARE are located in the core on
120-deg points at a radius of 7.5 1in.
from the center of the reactor. The
rods i1nsert into 3-in. sleeves that
pass through the reactor shell and
core vertically from top to bottom.
The rods are of hot-pressed boron
carbide slugs that are canned in stain-
less steel sections and slipped over a
flexible tube. Sections of the rod
are cored to permit passage of helium
down through the rod for cooling.
Helium also passes down and around the
rod in the space between the rod can
and the core sleeve so that cooling of
the outside surface and the inside of
the rod i1s accomplished by parallel
helium flow,

Located above the reactor, on top
of the reactor pit, are the actuating
mechanisms for each rod. An actuator
1s provided for each rod, but all
actuators are energized simultaneously,
and the maximum speed of withdrawal of
the rods is fixed by the speed of the
constant speed a-c motor used to
actuate the driving mechanism, The
safety rods are suspended by electro-
magnets., This arrangement was used in
the MTR, and the ARE design has taken
advantage of the experience gained in
the operation of that reactor.

The driving mechanism is comprised
of a reversible 60-cycle motor con-
nected to a drive screw that 1is
arranged to drive an electromagnet in
a vertical travel of 36 inches. The
drive screw operates inside a cy-
lindrical enclosure, and the magnet
has a keeper that fits as a piston
inside the enclosure. The piston has
a small cable attached concentrically;
the other end of the cable is attached
to the absorber rod. When the magnet
is energized, the drive screw moves
the piston vertically within the cy-
linder and, by the cable attachment,
either raises the safety rod or allows
it to fall by gravity as the piston 1is
lowered on the drive screw., When the
magnet is de-energized, the piston
falls and permits the safety rod to
drop. As the piston reaches the end
of 1ts travel, gas 1s compressed in
the cylinder, to a degree controlled
by vent holes in the cylinder wall,
and acts as a pneumatic cushion for
the rod.

Each of the three safety rods has
approximately 5% Ak/k negative re-
activity when inserted in the reactor.
Thus a total of approximately 15%
Ak/k is available to shut down the
reactor., Three large rods are used
because statistics indicate that at
least one of the three rods is certain
to drop without hesitation at a signal
to scram.

OPERATING PLAN

A clear concept of the object of
the ARE i1s essential for an under-
standing of the specific reactor
operation. The object, briefly
stated, 1s: to operate the system at
as near a 3-megawatt power level for
as nearly 500 hr as possible. Even
1f the facility operates successfully
at a power level of 1 megawatt for
only 1 hr, the experiment will have
attained some measure of success.
The object, as stated above, 1s
essentially the development of an
operating unit. Consequently, practi-
cally all data derived from the ARE
will be data pertaining to this
particular type of nuclear power
plant. One piece of basic information
to be determined from the experiment
is the evaluation of the stabilizing
influence of the temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity.

Operation of the ARE depends, to an
extraordinary degree, on providing

SUMMARY REPORT

a leak-free system before fluorides
are introduced into it. For this
reason, several preliminary tests
have been proposed to ensure detection
of all possible leaks. These tests
must, and will be,made with the utmost
care. The following account of the
test procedure, in the interest of
continuity, omits details of the
repairs indicated from time to time
by these tests (for repair of leaks
see “ Appendix A”). Accordingly, the
description of each test step is
based on the assumption that the
system has been found tight by all
previous tests.

Installation of Piping. Installation
of the plumbing system, which involves
all basic components of the reflector
coolant and fuel circuits because of
the interconnecting piping, will be a
tedious and exacting job. The pipe
lines and components will be completely
encased with acirculating gas (helium)
system. All piping is to be installed
in a prestressed condition so that
thermal expansion will essentially
remove system stresses. All joins
of components to piping will be made
by inert gas welding, according to
strict functional specifications, and
will be inspected by dye-checks and
radiography. Each weld will be
approved before additional welds are
made.

The monitoring gas annuli, wherever
these are i1ntegral pieces, will be
installed as the piping is installed.
No welded joint will be covered by
the annulus until just prior to
installation of the heaters and thermal
insulation. After all plumbing is
installed, the checkout procedure for
the system will be started.

Helium Leak Test. The first check
of the system will be made by putting
the fuel and reflector-coolant circuits
under a helium pressure of about 50
psi. While the systems are maintained
under this pressure, each welded
joint and the flanged joints at the
pumps will be soaped and visually

27
ARE HAZARDS

inspected for leaks. This test will
reveal gross leaks and will enable
repairs to be made with a minimum of
inconvenience.

Alcohol Leak Test. The pump shafts
on the reflector circuit will be
sealed with wax and the system evacu-
ated. A DPI halogen detector will be
installed i1n the vacuum pump circuit
and will be left there while the
fuel circuit is filled with alcohol.
The filling technique will be the
the same as that followed in subsequent
filling operations for NaK and fluo-
rides. This involves evacuating the
fuel system and filling slowly by
means of a positive gas pressure
over the fluid in the fill and dump
tanks.

With vacuum on the reflector
circuit, the alcohol in the fuel
circuit will be circulated at design
point flow, and the system pressure
will be raised to design point by
means of helium pressure over the
free liquid surface in the surge
tank. Then, 1f there 1s a leak
between fuel and reflector circuits,
alcohol vapor will be detected by a
DPI unit, and the core will have to be
repaired, This fault is extremely
unlikely, but the test must be made to
determine the integrity of the reactor
core.,

While the alcohol is circulating in
the fuel circuit, all instrumentation
such as flowmeters, level indicators,
pressure indicators, and thermocouples
will be checked to assure that their
operation is at least qualitatively
correct. Pump speed will be checked
throughout the variable range, and a
hydrodynamic test of the system 1n
general will be made. All joints will
be inspected visually for evidence of
leaks. At this stage of the test
program, it will be essential to check
carefully all valve performance 1in
relation to the associated valve-
monitoring equipment., Gas space
between bellows will be sniffed with

28

the DPI monitor for detection of leaky
bellows.

On completion of the above tests,
the reflector circuit will be filled
with alcohol and checked almost exactly
as was the fuel circuit. Obviously,
no additional leak test of the core
can be made, since both circuits will
at that time be filled with alcohol.

Roth circuits will then be drained
of alcohol, to the extent possible, by
admitting high-pressure helium over
the top of the liquid. A vacuum will
be pulled on both circuits to complete
the removal of all alcohol by evapo-
ration. The alcohol thus drained into
the fill and dump tanks will be removed
from the building.

Assembly of Reactor, Gas Annuli,
Heaters, and Insulation. After the
alcohol leak tests, the top plug will
be installed over the reactor and
installation and testing of the control
mechanism will begin. Both circuits
will be on the vacuum pump continuously,
and they will be checked repeatedly
for leaks by the rate of rise of
pressure in each system,

Before additional tests are war-
ranted, the system must be brought up
to temperature. This firstnecessitates
the installation of all annuli,
heaters, and thermal insulation, a
job which will require several man-
weeks of effort. The annulus system
must be made tight so that helium can
be circulated independently of the
pit atmosphere, for, at this stage of
the test, the pits will be open and
will not have a helium atmosphere.

Vacuum Test at 1200°F. After the
complete system has been equipped
with annuli, heaters, and insulation,
power will be turned on the entire
heating assembly to begin the warm-up.
Helium will be circulating in the
annuli to assist in eliminating
longitudinal thermal gradients. The
warm-up will proceed at a very slow
rate, about 35°F per hour. During the
warm-up, the heater system will be
carefully monitored, and any inequality
in temperature will be corrected by a
shifting of heater power source (there

are four such sources of independently

variable voltage). The entire system

will be brought to a temperature of
1200°F,

With an isothermal condition at a
temperature of 1200°F, a rate-of-
pressure-rise test will be applied to
both fuel and reflector systems as a
final check for leaks before the hot
NaK is introduced into the circuits,
Also, at this high temperature, the
control rodswill be given anoperational
check to make sure that no interference
has resulted from thermal expansion.
At this point also, any heaters and
insulation damaged by thermal ex-
pansion will be repaired.

Hot NaK Test. One flush and fill
tank will be filled with NaK and the
heaters on the tank turned on to bring
the NaK to a temperature of 1200°F,
The fuel circuit will then be filled
with hot NaK. With NaK circulating in
the fuel circuit, the reflector circuit
will be carefully monitored with the
DPI sniffer to detect any leak that
might have developed in the reactor
core, All valve operation, thermo-
couples, flowmeters, level indicators,
and other instrumentation will be
checked for proper operation.

Once the fuel circuit has been
checked out, the reflector circuit
flush and fill tanks will be filled
with NaK, which will then be brought
up to a temperature of 1200°F, The
reflector circuit will be given the
same check as the fuel circuit, and
both circuits will be operated simul-
taneously in a shakedown run, This
run will involve operation of the
helium blowers of both circuits for
short periods of time. The heater
power will be inadequate to allow
extraction of much power by the heat

SUMMARY REPORT

exchanger loops, but the heat exchanger
outlet temperature will be reduced by
about 200°F for brief periods to see
that the equipment functions properly,
The system will be observed critically
and carefully for a period of con-
tinuous operation of about 40 hours.
Final testing will be done at 1500°F,

When the operation is satisfactory,
the fuel circuit only will be drained
of NaK and put under vacuum. When the
rate of pressure rise in the evacuated
circuit indicates that the NaK has
been removed, the system will be ready
for the fluoride loading. Since Nak
cannot be used in the fuel circuit
after the fluorides have been intro-
duced, the NaK will be removed from
the fill and dump tanks as well as
from the fuel circuit,

Tests with Fuel Carrier. If the
preliminary tests up to this point
indicate that the system 1s tight, the
loading of the fill and dump tanks for
the fuel circuit with the 1inert
fluoride fuel carrier, NaF-ZrF,, can
be started. The fluoride will first
be put into two fill and dump tanks of
the fuel circuit. FEach of these tanks
has a usable capacity of approximately
12 ft?; the capacity of the fuel circuit
is approximately 7.5 ft®, To provide
a reserve of 7.5 ft® of fluoride fuel
carrier for flushing the fuel system
and an empty dump tank for receiving
the mixed fuel and carrier, 1t 1is
proposed to divide the 15 ft3 of
fluoride fuel carrier in these two
tanks so that one will contain approxi-
mately 6 ft® and the other 9 ft?. The
system will be filled by using the
smaller supply first, to empty that
tank, and then the larger supply to
provide the required amount, 7.5 ft>.
Once the fuel carrier has been trans-
ferred to the reactor system, the
valves to the fill tanks will be
isolated so that the enriched fuel
mixture cannot subsequently be dumped
into these tanks,

29
ARE HAZARDS

Filling the system with molten
fluoride will be carried out in the
same manner as the previous fillings
with alcohol and hot NaK. The system
will be filled until the surge tanks
are approximately two-thirds filled.
With the pumps in operation, the gas
pressure over the surge tanks will be
increased by about 15 psi. A de-
pression of the level in the surge
tanks as a result of the increase in
gas pressure will indicate gas pockets
in the system.

A further check for gas pockets in
the reactor, as well as a check for
equality of flow in the six parallel
fuel paths i1n the core, can be made by
turning on the helium blowers to about
10% of full flow for a short time.
During all this time the fuel carrier
will be heated by external resistance
heaters. Unequal temperature rises
as the fuel carrier flows in the six
parallel channels will indicate
unequal flow rates, with the slower
moving fluid having the higher temper-
ature rise. Variations of as much as
5% 1n outlet temperatures between any
two parallel paths will indicate
unsatisfactory flow in the path with
the higher outlet temperature. Changing
the speed of the helium blowers will
introduce a temperature transient
in the fuel circuit. These vari-
ations in speed will be introduced by
manual adjustment of the wobble plate
of the Vickers hydraulic drive to the
helium blower in such a manner that
the fuel heat exchanger outlet temper-
ature will not decrease more than
25°F. The wobble-plate-motor speed-
control setting required to give
this 25-deg drop in temperature will
be noted, since it will be used again
in a subsequent test.

At this point in the test program,
the system will be ready for a shake-
down run before the addition of the
enriched fuel. The period of operation
with the fuel carrier will be extensive
so that any weak points in the system

30

can be discovered and final repairs
made before the fuel is added. All
instrumentation will be thoroughly
checked, as will valve and pump
operation. The system will be run for
about 50 hr before fuel addition 1s
started. The shakedown period should
be long enough to show up possible
danger points in seals, valves, rod
actuators, etc. Once this period has
been passed, the probability of
failure within the next 100 hr is
believed to be quite low. It 1s
imperative that every precaution be
taken to ensure the tightness of the
system before enriched fuel is added,
for 1t will be very difficult to
effect repairs after that time.

Critical Loading. When the 50-hr
test with the fuel carrier is completed,
the fuel (NaF-ZrF,-UF,, 50-25-25mole %)
will be brought into the building and
the fuel-enrichment system will be
filled. The fuel melt will be prepared
in ‘‘eversafe’ tanks atY-12 and brought
to the building for heating. All
temporary gas by-passes will be removed
and the pits covered so that the air
in them can be replaced by a helium
atmosphere, which will remain for the
duration of the experiment. With
helium in the pits, the heat loss
from the system will be increased, and
it will be necessary to increase the
heater power input to maintain the
temperatures at the desired point.
Steady isothermal conditions for the
entire system can be achieved after
sufficient time has elapsed.

With the system isothermal, or
approximately so, fuel enrichment will
be started. However, before this can
be done, 1t will be necessary to drain
approximately 1 ft?® of the fluoride
mixture from the system into the fill
and dump tank that already contains
approximately 6 ft3. Then one half
the calculated critical loading will
be made as rapidly as the enrichment
system will permit. The system
provides for injection of one quart
of fuel i1n approximately 3 minutes;
the system can inject no more than a
quart 1n each operation lasting 3
minutes. After each 1njection the
quart-measuring device must be re-
loaded. The 3-min loading-time
interval is approximately four fluid
loop transit times. Successive quart
loadings will be made in such a manner
that the start of no two loadings
will occur at the same point in the
loop cycle. This precaution should
ensure uniform fuel distribution in
the system, even though mixing after
injection should be good.

When one half the computed critical
loading has been made, the remaining
loading will be done with the care
and caution characteristic of loading
any reactor for the first time. The
safety rods will be approximately 75%
withdrawn, and the regulating rod,
which will be on ‘manual’’ operation,
will be in the midrange position.
The control system will be thoroughly
interlocked to prevent gross mis-
operation while permitting the operator
the maximum degree of freedom com-
mensurate with safety. Loading of the
fuel will be complete when the reactor
1s just critical at an 1sothermal
temperature of 1200°F with the shim
(safety) rods essentially 75% with-
drawn and theregulating rod completely
withdrawn.

Subcritical Measurement of Fuel
Temperature Coefficient. Loading will
be interrupted just as soon as a
measurable multiplication can be
detected on the nuclear instruments.
It 1s desirable to check the sign of
the fuel temperature coefficient of
reactivity as early in the operational
regime as possible. Therefore, when
the de finite multiplication is dis-
cernible, a cool-fuel temperature
transient will be induced in the
reactor. This will be done by setting
the helium speed control to that point
previously determined which gives a
maximum heat exchanger fuel-outlet
temperature drop of about 25°F.

SUMMARY REPORT

The characteristics of the temper-
ature transient can be determined
experimentally by starting and stopping
the helium flow for the fuel-to-helium
heat exchanger at that stage in the
test program in which the system
contains fluorides but no fuel 1in
the fuel circuit. Several helium-
flow time intervals will be used, and
the reactor inlet and outlet tempera-
tures for each will be recorded.
These records will be available so
that successively increasing time
intervals can be used i1n this test
for reactivity temperature coefficient.

The cool-fuel temperature transient
should increase the multiplication
because of the negative fuel tempera-
ture coefficient. If themultiplication
decreases, indicating a positive
temperature coefficient of reactivity,
the reactor will be shut down and
drained. It is the opinion of those
who will operate the ARE that no power
reactor having a positive temperature
coefficient of reactivity 1s safe to
operate, regardless of the type of
automatic control system associated
with 1t.

Regulating Rod Calibration. Before
the reactor is brought to power, 1t
will be necessary to calibrate the
regulating rod. This will be done 1in
the following manner: With the reactor
critical, as described above, the
regulating rod will be fully inserted
and a measured quantity of fuel will
be added uniformly to the system over
a complete loop circuit time interval.
By this time the quantity that must be
added to provide excess reactivity of
approximately 0.05% can be estimated.
The fuel can then be added uniformly
to provide anx 1ncrease 1n excess
reactivity of 0.05% in a single fuel
enrichment operation. With the
enrichment operation completed, the
regulating rod will be withdrawn until
the reactor is again critical. The
position of the regulating rod will
then be noted and recorded and the
calibrating procedure repeated for

31
ARE HAZARDS

the remainder of the length of the
regulating rod.

Zero Power Operation at 1300°F.
With the regulating rod calibrated and
the reactor critical, the temperature
of the system will be raised 50°F and
made isothermal at 1250°F. At this
temperature the regulating rod will be
adjusted so that the reactor 1is
critical again, since the temperature
rise will have caused it to go sub-
critical. The temperature will be
raised slowly so that the operator can
maintaln critical or subcritical
conditions rather easily throughout
the operation by withdrawing or
inserting the regulating rod.

Another 50°F temperature elevation
will then be made in the same manner
as was the first one. A further
withdrawal of the shim rods may be
required before the attempt is made
to raise the temperature, since the
magnitude of the negative temperature
coefficients 1n fuel and moderator
may be such that the excess reactivity
contained in the regulating rod cannot
compensate for a 100-deg temperature
rise.

With the system isothermal at
1300°F and subcritical by shim and/or
regulating rod insertion, fuel will be
added in small increments until a
sufficient amount has been added to
maintain criticality at 1300°F with a
regulating rod at the mid-position and
the shim rods approximately 75%
withdrawn. :

The calibrated regulating rod will
make possible determination of the
over-all reactivity temperature
coefficient by these above-mentioned
50°F temperature increases. However,
the precisionof the shim rodpositioning
mechanism is not good enough to
permit a reliable determination of
this coefficient 1f the shim rods are
moved during the operation of raising
the temperature.

It 1s doubtful that the fuel
temperature coefficient can be de-

32

termined accurately and independently
from any of these tests. Evaluation
of the temperature coefficient can
probably be made by analysis of the
load transients on the reactor at
design-polint power.

Power Operation. With the reactor
critical and isothermal at 1300°F
and the temperature coefficient tests
completed, power operation may be
undertaken. This step will be taken
as follows: The reflector coolant
helium pumps will be turned on. The
regulating rod will! be withdrawn
sufficiently to provide a reactor
period of approximately 20 seconds.
If no further manipulation of the
rod takes place, this period should
continue until thepower level suffices
to raise the mean fuel temperature
and lengthen the period. As the
period increases to about 30 or 40 sec
the fuel coolant helium blowers will
be started and brought up, as rapidly
as the equipment will allow, until
about 500 kwof power isbeing generated
by the reactor. This power level will
be indicated by a differential temper-
ature between reactor inlet and
outlet of approximately 60°F.

The power extraction will then be
leveled off long enough to check
operation, and 1f the system 1is
performing satisfactorily, the power
level will again be raised. Present
plans are to go to a power output of
3,000 kw as soon as possible. The
exact procedure for getting to this
high power level will be dictated
by conditions at the time of operation
and cannot be outlined in detail at
this time, since so much depends upon
the history of the system, the number
of repairs that have been necessary,
the elapsed time which the system has
been at temperature, etc. A decision
may be made to go to 3,000 kw for a
few hours and then reduce the power to
a lower value for a longer period
of time. Again, the object of the
experiment, to get all operating time
at 3,000 kw commensurate with safety,

will dictate the exact procedure to
be followed.

Shutdown. When the reactor has
been run at power for about 500 hr,
the experiment will be complete.
If operation has been satisfactory
and the condition of the various
components 1s good, one further
interesting test may be made. The
reactor will be scrammed and left
shut down for about 10 hr so that the
xenon poison peak will be reached.
At this time the rods will be carefully
withdrawn until the reactor is again
critical. If the reactor goes critical
at essentially the same rod position,
it will indicate that most of the
xenon has been evolved from the molten
fuel. If, however, the rods must be
withdrawn beyond the original position
to make the reactor critical, it
can be assumed that xenon is at best

incompletely evolved from the molten
fuel.

The reactor will be finally scrammed
and the fuel drained into the hot
fuel dump tank. This draining will be
done by blowing the fluorides out with
helium. The blow-down will remove all
ligquid except that retained in the
bottom of the loops in the core. The
system will again be filled with
fuel-carrier fluorides from the fill
and flush tank. The flushing mixture

will then be drained back into an

empty fill and flush tank. This tank
may be

for fuel recovery,

from the pit.

The NaK coolant used in the reflector

circuit will also be drained into
the fill and flush tanks provided for
this purpose. The NaK will remain in
these tanks until the activity has
decayed to a tolerance level that
permits its being pumped out of the
pit. The NaK can be removed after a
cooling period of about 67 days.

SUMMARY REPORT

EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM

As has been previously mentioned,
the main purpose of the ARE 1is to
test a reactor system and learn
everything possible about the reactor
itself. As a result, experiments not
directly connected with the reactor
have been discouraged. To date only
one such test is planned: a shielding
experiment of particular interest to
the entire ANP project. The purpose
of the experiment is twofold: to
obtain shielding requirements for
pipes containing flowing fuel and to
obtain some fundamental data on
delayed-neutron and gamma-ray emission.

To facilitate this experiment, the
exit fuel line from the reactor has
been routed through the corner of the
pit containing the dump tanks. This
will enable the shielding group to
set up equipment around the exit
fuel line close to the reactor but
shielded from any direct radiation
from it. The equipment will be set
up prior to reactor operation and the
data will be taken remotely.

CHEMICAL PROCESSING AND DISPOSAL

After the completion of the operation
of the reactor, the fuel will be
dumped into a special tank provided
for this purpose in the dump pit.
This dump tank i1s designed to be
subcritical at all times and in-
corporates helium convection channels
to remove the fission afterheat.
The fuel will be removed from this
dump tank, under helium pressure,
through a line in the bottom of the
tank that terminates at the outside of
the concrete shield. The fuel will
be removed i1n batches of appropriate
size for the chemical processing that
is being developed by the Chemical
Technology Division at ORNL. The
active wastes from the chemical
processing operation will be processed
and stored in the existing OBNL tank
farm and waste disposal system.

REACTOR HAZARDS

The nuclear and chemical hazards
peculiar to the ARE are discussed in
this section. No discussion is in-
cluded of the normal hazards of
radiation associated with all reactors;
however, every precaution has been
taken to minimize these dangers. The
usual tolerances were followed in the
calculation of the shielding require-
ments for the reactor, and careful
health-physics surveys will be made
during the entire operation. Monitrons
and air monitors are being installed
inside and outside the building so
that the operators will have constant
knowledge of the radiation level
around the area.

The radioactivity of the ARE 1s
inherently confined by the nature of
the design and materials i1in such a
manner that the uncontrolled dispersion
of radioactivity, even following an
accident, 1is improbable. The bulk of
the radioactivity 1s i1n the fuel,
which has a melting point of about
520°C. Since the fuel solidifies at
lower temperatures and 1s not water
soluble, the fission gases, in the
event of a fuel leak or a fuel and
water leak, remain in the fuel. The
NaK coolant permeates the core and
becomes slightly radioactive, but the
chief danger associated with the NaK
1s that i1t 1s a potential fire hazard.
Process water, which 1s in an external
heat exchanger, 1s sufficiently re-
moved from the radioactive source that
its disposal presents no hazard.
The off-gas system is designed so that
the released activity will not exceed
tolerance and is capable of safely
regulating the release of excess
activity following a disaster in which
the activity is confined to the pits.

Various possible failures are
di scussed below, including fuel
freezing, fuel inventory, fuel leaks,
and NaK leaks. It is apparent from
the discussion of these failures that

as a result of any single failure, no
serious damage will result and no
radiation hazard will occur. A
serious hazard could result only from
a coincidence of failures that would
permit the NaK and water to react and
release a large amount of energy, and
then all that energy, or some of it,
would be applied to volatilize the
the fuel. Since such a hazard would
require the coincident failure of
three independent fluid systems 1in
the immediate vicinity of each other,
it would appear that a serious catas-
trophe with the ARE 1s extremely
unlikely. However, for such a failure,
three situations have been examined
in some detail (cf., “Hazard to Sur-
rounding Area in the Event of a
Failure”). The situations are (1) the
activity is confined to the pits,
(2) the pits are ruptured and the
activity leaks slowly from the building,
and (3) the building, as well as the
pits, is violated and the activity
rises 1n a hot cloud.

FUEL FREEZING

One of the most hazardous features
of the ARE is the relatively high
melting point of the fuel., Accidental
freezing of the fuel with attendant
flow stoppage at some region in the
system would probably terminate the
experiment. The high melting point,
about 950°F, has been determined in
the laboratory. Search for a suitable
lower-melting-point fuel continues,
with little promise that such will be
available by the time the ARE is ready
to be put into operation. The high
melting point is a basic feature that
had to be taken into account in the
design of the ARE reactor and auxiliary
equipment,

The electrical heating system,
together with circulating helium in
the annuli about the fluoride-carrying
piping, has been designed to keep the

35
ARE HAZARDS

fluorides external to and between the
reactor and heat exchanger at uniform
temperatures., Circulating helium will
minimize occurrence of cold spots that
would otherwise be found at points of
local heater failure. Since it 1is
impractical to locate thermojunctions
at all vulnerable points, this hot,
circulating, helium “blanket’’ ensures
against development of such an un-
detected cold spot that could freeze
the fuel.

Within the closed heat exchanger
loops and adjacent to either side of
the fuel-to-helium heat exchangers,
thermal shields or barriers are located
to reduce the radiant losses when fuel
coolant helium is not circulating.

Electrical heater units have been
installed around all fluoride-bearing
lines and components. The number of
these units installed provides a 10-
to-1 safety feature over the calcu-
lated power required to heat the
system., This over-design gives a
margin of insurance against heater
failures,

Means for monitoring the anticipated
lowest temperature points of the
system are a part of the basic design.
Permissible lower limits of these
temperatures automatically actuate
mechanisms to diminish heat extraction
from the system adjacent to these
monitored points, wherever suchmethods
are feasible. This method is appli-
cable to the control of the fuel out-
let temperature of the fuel-to-helium
heat exchanger, The helium blowers to
the fuel heat exchanger are inter-
locked with the outlet temperature to
shut them down when the temperature
drops lower than a predetermined safe
value,

LARGE FUEL INVENTORY IN SYSTEM

The presence of more than one
critical mass of U?3% jin the system
constitutes a hazard. Any circulating-
fuel reactor that allows fuel external
to the eritical core volume is part of

36

a system containing more than one
critical mass of fuel that has access
to the critical lattice. Were there
any mechanism whereby this fuel could
precipitate selectively and conse-
quently increase the mass of U?3*® in
the core, the system would be po-
tentially dangerous.

Extensive examination of the
fluoride-melt phase diagrams indicates
that the melt is homogeneous under all
contemplated operating conditions.
Radiation damage experiments have been
run at a flux level comparable to that
anticipated for the ARE, These experi-
ments fail to show the development of
inhomogeneity in the fuel. This
evidence of fuel stability provides
the only insurance against fuel
precipitation either in the core or in
the external loop.

If, in spite of this evidence,
selective precipitation should occur,
it may be possible to determine this
by the following proposed test. If,
after the reactor is made critical,
it is kept in this condition and it is
isothermal for an extended period of
time, such as 8 or 10 hr, precipitation
then would more than likely not occur
uniformly throughout the system. In
particular, it might occur most
pronouncedly in those areas where the
surface-to-volume ratio was highest,
Or, it could very well be that the
greatest precipitation would occur in
those regions of the system where fluid
turbulence would be at a minimum. In
any case, selective precipitation that
would deposit a relatively greater
amount of uranium within the critical
lattice than elsewhere in the system
would increase the reactivity. Like-
wise, selective precipitation of such
a nature as to ‘allow greater deposits
in the external system than in the
critical lattice would decrease the
reactivity, Since this would occur at
low power, the decrease in reactivity
could not be brought about by reactor
poisoning. Consequently, this test
should provide confirming evidence of
the absence of selective precipitation,
If, in the period of 10 hr of operation
at zero power under isothermal con-
ditions, the reactivity remains con-
stant, it can be concluded that there
is no selective precipitation. This
test, of course, does not furnish in-
formation on precipitation as in-
fluenced by radiation.

There are, however, certain ob-
servations that can be made when the
reactor 1s at design-point power, or
an appreciable fraction of this power,
which may give some information on
selective precipitation, Under these
conditions, if the precipitations occur
in the active lattice to a greater
extent than in the external system the
reactor will be put i1nto a positive
period, the flux will rise, and the
reactor outlet temperature will slowly
rise; thus indications of trouble will
be given by both nuclear and process
instrumentation. If the predetermined
upper limits on any of these variables
(for example, too fast a period or too
high a temperature) is reached, the
reactor will be automatically shut
down. Unfortunately, an excess of
precipitation in the external loop
will decrease the reactivity, and
since there are other effects in the
operation of the reactor that also
tend to do this, 1t will not be likely
that any system presently provided will
discriminate between slow precipitation
in the external loop and these other
features. Consequently, the hazard
that has previously been extensively
investigated theoretically and which
accounts for a sudden release of
uranium previously precipitated in the
external loop into thecritical volume,
has not been guarded against by any of
the nuclear safety devices. It 1is
difficult to provide a means of
detecting this external precipitation,
should 1t occur, About the only
inherent safety features of the
system that afford protection for this
sort of situation are the negative

SUMMARY REPORT

reactivity temperature coefficients of
the reactor and the safety rods, which
will become effective when the dis-
lodged accumulation of uranium begins
entering the critical volume.

FUEL LEAKS WITHIN THE REACTOR

The basic design of the reactor is
such that fuel leaks occurring within
the critical lattice cannot accumulate
uranium in this region. All voids
(instrument holes, control rod holes)
that enter the active lattice are
vertical and open through the pressure
shell at the top and bottom. This 1is
done to eliminate the possibility of a
void filling with stagnant fuel in
case of a leak in the void. The volume
surrounding the fuel tubes is filled
with the reflector coolant, NaK. This
reflector coolant circuit is made
common to the core moderator so that
the NaK can permeate the interstices
between the beryllium oxide blocks.
Maintenance of a positive pressure
differential between the NaK and fuel
circuits minimizes any tendency for
fuel to flow into the moderator volume
in case of a leak between fuel and
moderator. Therefore, in the event of
a leak the direction of flow would be
from the NaK into the fuel, as dis-
cussed below. The fuel which might
back-diffuse into the NaK system would
be reduced into high-melting-point
solids.

NaK LEAK EXTERNAL TO REACTOR

The use of NaK as the reflector
coolant provides another hazard, The
NaK is circulated at a temperature of
the order of 1100°F, and consequently
its naturally pyrophoric nature 1is
accentuated.

Two features of the design are
effective in reducing the danger of
NaK fires. The monitoring system (a
helium filled annulus in which the
helium is monitored for NaK) that
encloses every piece of pipe and every
component carrying NaK will disclose

37
ARE HAZARDS

the presence pf a leak within a few
seconds. In order for the NaK to get
into the pit area, i1t would be necessary
for a leak to occur simultaneously in
both the metal and annulus circuits.
Furthermore, the helium atmosphere in
the pit will not support a NaK fire.
It would, therefore, be necessary for
water to leak into the pit and come in
contact with the metal in order to
cause a fire. In addition to the
fact that the probability of these
coincidental failures is remote, the
reaction of large quantities of Nak
and water under a helium atmosphere
results in only a mild fire - not the
violent explosion that occurs when the
mixture reacts in air, Furthermore,
means for sensing the loss of NaK from
the system are essentially the same as
those used to detect a leak between
the fuel and the NaK system; that is,
an appreciable loss of the metal will
lower the NaK surge tank level. As
added safety features, means will
be used to continuously examine both
the oxygen concentration in the pits
and the relative humidity of the helium
atmosphere in the pit. These features
should indicate promptly the presence
of an air or water leak into this
region.

NaK LEAK WITHIN THE REACTOR

A NaK leak within the reactor
implies three possibilities: (1) NaK
leaking out of the core (through the
pressure shell or welds therein),
(2) NaK leaking into control rod or
instrument voids, and (3) NaK leaking
into the fuel circuit. A leak in or
around the pressure shell in which the
NaK escapes into the annulus surround-
ing the reactor will be detected by
the monitoring system, Such a leak
is, 1n effect, similar to the external
leak discussed above.

A NaK leak into the helium-filled
control rod holes is impeded by the
3/16-in.-thick, double-walled seamless
tubing, control rod guide sleeve. The
annulus between the two walls of the

38

tubing i1s filled with diatomaceous
earth, The leak would be detected
either by the loss in volume in the
NaK system or by the halogen monitor-
ing system for the helium in the
control system.

The condition wherein NaK leaks into
the fuel system because of the lower
pressure maintained therein, must be
further subdivided according to
whether the leak is large or small.
If the leak were large (the result of
a tube rupture), the resulting reaction
between the NaK and the fuel would
create sufficient solid reaction
products to completely plug the tube.
(This will be discussed in considerably
more detail below.) On the other hand,
if the leak were small (a few cubic
centimeters per second), up to 5
volume % of NaK might be added to the
fuel circuit without noticeably
affecting the fuel flow. The slow
leak would be detected by the lowering
of the level in the NaK surge tank,
together with a rise in the level of
the fuel surge tank. If these two
levels change in this manner, the
reactor will be shut down and the
system drained.

With regard to a large leak, it has
been found that when sufficient NaK is
mixed with the fluoride fuel a high-
melting-point compound that is solid
at design-point temperatures is formed;
therefore a large leak of NaK into the
fuel circuit could block one of the
fuel passages by the formation of such
a solid mix., The reactor behavior for
a condition wherein one of the fuel
tubes becomes blocked has been care-
fully studied for one set of circum-
stances, It was assumed that the
reactor was operating at design-point
power when one fuel tube became
blocked by the leaking NaK and fuel
mixture and the fuel flow in the tube
stopped instantly. Although it 1is
difficult to define the cause or type
of fuel tube failure that could bring
about this result, the stoppage seems
to represent the utmost in perversity,
This condition was simulated on the
OBNL reactor power-plant simulator.

If one of the six parallel circuits
is blocked, the temperature of the
stagnant fuel in this passage will
rise rapidly, but there will be no
appreciable over-all reduction in
fluid flow in the circuit owing to the
plugging of the one passage. However,
the flow rate in the five passages
remaining open will be increased. The
increased flow rate will lower the
mean temperature of the fuel in these
five passages if the power remains
constant, Lowering of the mean
temperature in five-sixths of the fuel
will tend to offset the increase in
mean temperature of the fuel in the
blocked passage. Furthermore, the
temperature coefficient of reactivity
tends to maintain the reactor critical
in spite of the rise in temperature of
the fuel in the blocked tube.
these effects will bring about a
pronounced decrease in the mean temper-
ature of the fuel in the five un-
blocked passages and, consequently, in
the fuel outlet temperature for these
five channels.

Calculations indicate that the mean
temperature of the fuel in the blocked
passage rises exponentially to an
asymptotic value of 875°F above design
temperature, while the temperature of
the fuel in the remaining five passages
drops exponentially to an asymptotic
value of 175°F below design point.
This calculation has been checked for
the initial period on the reactor
simulator; the results are shown in
Fig. 11. The curve shows that after
3 sec the temperature in the blocked
tube is 120°F above design point,
whereas the temperature in the five
other tubes has dropped 23°F., The net
result of these temperature changes is
to put the reactor on a25-sec negative
period. For these studies it was
assumed that there was no shift in
flux distribution for a transient
condition in which the reactor inlet
temperature remained constant and no

Both of

compensating action was provided by
the control andsafety system. Dropping
of safety rods would, of course, limit
the amount of the temperature rise,

On the basis of the results derived
from the simulator studies, means have
been provided to sense the reactor
fuel tube outlet temperature sepa-
rately. Any appreciable change in
differential temperatures between any
two of the six outlet tubes will
automatically scram the reactor and
cut the helium coolant. Of necessity,
there is a transport lag between the
actual tube plugging and sensing of
the temperature changes caused by this
plugging, since the change in fuel
flow will not be abrupt even for the
assumed case of instantaneous blocking,
but rather will be of the nature of a
ramp function of time.

FUEL LEAK EXTERNAL TO REACTOR

The hazard of fuel leakage into the
pits naturally must be kept to a
minimum., In the first place, were all
the fuel to leak into the pit, there
must be assurance that it will not
accumulate in a compact volume so that
it will remain subcritical with any
conceivable surrounding. If the fuel
leaks onto the concrete pit floor, the
resulting solidified puddle will be
subecritical. The equipment 1n the
pits will have to be examined after
installation to ascertain that in the
event of a fuel leak no critical
accumulation can occur in the equip-
ment. Furthermore, fuel leakage into
the pits after the reactor has been
operated at power will release fission
fragments into the helium atmosphere
there. The results of a study of
atmospheric contamination caused by
fuel leaks of specified magnitude into
the pits are discussed below,

The fuel fluid circuit is in a
rather complex fabricated system,
There are a great number of joints 1in
this system and fuel leakage could
occur at any joint. '

TEMPERATURE (°F)
G-E halogen detectors will be used
to sniff continuously samples of
helium flowing in the annuli about the
fuel-bearing pipes between reactor and
heat exchanger. Minute fuel leaks in
the piping system will be sensed
promptly, and the detector will
actuate an alarm system whenever a
leak occurs. A sizeable leak will
cause a lowering of the level in the
fuel surge tank., With positive
evidence that the fuel level in the
surge tank is dropping, the operator
will shut down the reactor and drain
the fuel. TIf such a leak occurred
during or after power operation it
would also cause the radiation monitor
to actuate an alarm system. These
three signals, namely, an alarm from
the G-E halogen detector, lowering of
the fuel level in the surge tank, and
an alarm from a radiation detector,
constitute what is considered ample
evidence of the loss of some fuel from
the system, and other than draining
the remaining fuel there is not much
the operator can do to rectify the
situation.

The helium system of the fuel-to-
helium heat exchanger is nominally
closed to the pits but there is leakage
between the two systems., Consequently,
a fuel leak in the heat exchanger will
be discovered by either the halogen
detector or a radiation monitor after
the leakage products have entered the
pits external to the heat exchanger
loop.

BOMB DAMAGE

Blowing up of the ARE with explosive
charges set from within by saboteurs
is feasible but could be done only
with great difficulty because the
entire reactor system 1s enclosed
within concrete pits. The only way in
which access can be gained to the pits
1s by lifting at least four of the
concrete blocks covering the top of the
reactor pits. Since these blocks
weigh a minimum of 6 tons, it would

SUMMARY REPORT

require the cooperation of several men
experienced in rigging and it would
take considerable time. This type of
event appears extremely unlikely.
Should it occur, the mixture of water,
NaK,and fuel would react in the manner
described in the section below on “The
Ultimate Catastrophe.”

The situation with regard to a
bombing attack does not appear to be
any more hazardous or probable than
that resulting from the sabotage
described above. Again, the questions
of strategic importance of the ex-
perimental reactor, its invulnerability
because of the 7lk-ft-thick concrete
pits, and its 1solated location 1in
regard to possible hazards to other
installations and thickly settled
areas must be taken into account. A
bombing attack would most certainly
occur under wartime conditions, and
appropriate measures could be taken
at that time should that eventuality
occur,

OPERATIONAL SABOTAGE

To effect a serious accident by
sabotage would require deliberate
misoperation of the controls subsequent
to blocking out several interlocks 1in
the safety system. This method of
sabotage is feasible only by cooperation
(voluntary or otherwise) of all of
the operators and guards on a shift,

The only time that serious damage
can be produced by addition of fuel is
the period between the attachment of
the enriched fuel tank to the system
and the final procurement of criti-
cality, It is conceivable that a
saboteur by severing interlocks
could stop the pumps and then force
all the enriched fuel into the piping
system. With all of the fuel con-
centrated in one section of the
process piping, subsequent starting
of the pumps would place up to five

"critical masses in the reactor at one

time. This possibility has been

41
ARE HAZARDS

discussed with the ORNL Protection
Division and a special guarding system
is being worked out for this period
of operation. Once the reactor has
been brought to critical with the
required excess k, any fuel remaining
in the fuel tank will be removed so
that this method for sabotage will no
longer exist. _

Probably the most likely and
serious possibility for sabotage
arises after the reactor has been
operated for some time at full power.
The best method of sabotage at this
point would be to simply stop all four
fuel and secondary coolant pumps and
turnon all the process piping heaters,
While the reactor would kill itself
immediately by interlocks dropping
the safety rods or by its negative
temperature coefficient, the fission-
product heat and the electrical power
would raise the entire piping tempera-
ture.

By using the Way-Wigner equations,
as summarized in ORNL-963,(!) for the
fission-product energy, the cumulative
heat after shutdown has been calculated,
assuming that the reactor has been
continuously operated for 20 days at
3 megawatts. The results of the
calculations are given in Table 2.

(I)J. H., Buck and C, F., Leyse, Naterials
Testing Reactor Project Handbook, ORNL-963
(May 5, 1951},

The worst possible condition that
one can assume is that all the heat
1s transmitted to and retained by the
fuel end its immediate Inconel piping.
The heat capacity of the 8.5 ft3 of
fuel mixture and its associated piping
is approximately 2 x 10° calories.
Again, assuming no losses to the NaKk,
beryllium oxide, or annulus piping in
2 hr, the fuel temperature would rise
(130 x 10%) /(2x 10%) or 650°C (1170°F).
assuming that the fuel started at a
mean temperature of 735°C (1350°F),
its temperature at the end of 2 hr
would be 1385°C (2570°F). This 1is
only slightly below the melting point
of Inconel and somewhat above the
boiling point of the fuel. It must
be noted that no credit is taken for
the heat capacity of the annulus
piping, heaters, and insulation or,
more important, the large increase
of radiation to the walls of the pit
as the temperature rises above 1700 or
1800°F. Therefore, it must be assumed
that some time, that is, considerably
more than 2 hr, would be required for
the inner Inconel to give way and
allow the fuel to run into the annulus
piping. Then, as the annulus piping
melted, the fuel would run to the
floor of one of the pits where the
heat would be taken up by the concrete.
It should be noted that with this
method of sabotage, the chance of a

break within the reactor is extremely
small due to the large heat capacity
of the beryllium oxide. The first
break would probably occur in the
surge tanks or piping external to the
reactor pit.

Since something more than 2 hr is
required for the fuel to break into
the pits and thus release fission
products, this method of sabotage,
although i1t would effectively ruin
the reactor, has little chance of
harming personnel outside the building.

FIRE, FLOOD, WINDSTORMS,
AND EARTHQUAKES

Of the so-called “Acts of God, "
neither floods nor earthquakes present
a serious hazard to the aircraft
reactor experiment. As a consequence
of the particular topography (Fig. 1)
selected for the site of the ABRE, a
flood and, therefore, flood damage is
impossible. On the other hand, the
data on the frequency and severity of
earthquakes in the Oak Ridge area show
that the probability of earthquake
damage is extremely small (cf., section
on seismology of area in chapter on
““Hazards to Surrounding Area in Event
of a Failure”).

With regard to fire as a hazard,
the ARE building (Figs. 6 and 7)
carries a Uniform Building Code(?2)
fire rating of 2 hours. Inflammable
materials are not used in any appre-
ciable quantity in the construction
of the building or the reactor. The

reactor, as well as the associated
plumbing, pumps, and heat transfer
equipment, has been examined rather

closely from this point of view
because of the high (up to 1500°F)
temperatures expected. However, except
for the use of NaK as a coolant in the
reactor, even the high temperatures
(in the absence of combustible material)
present no hazard.

at the Pacific Coast Building Operations Confer-
ence and reported in Building Codes and Other
Criteria, L. Wilson, GM-127 (AEC).

SUMMARY REPORT

The possibilities of a NaK leak
have been previously discussed.
However, the operation of the reactor
system involving NaK will take place
in a helium atmosphere in which NaK
alone 1s not inflammable. In fact,
experiments have shown that in a helium
environment even the potentially
dangerous reactions of NaK on water
and water on NaK are greatly reduced.
In the event of a NaK fire, however,
fire extinguishers and procedures as
specified in the Alkali Metals Area
Safety Guide(3) will be employed.
Materials which will safely extinguish
a NaK fire are graphite powder and
Ansul-Met-L-X (sodium chloride coated
to prevent the absorption of mois-
ture). (*) Adequate quantities of
of these materials will be kept at
convenient locations.

It should be noted that such con-
ventional extinguishers as water, CO,,
and sand should not be applied to a
NaK fire. Therefore the conventional
sprinkler system has been omitted from
the design of the building, but a fire
hydrant on a 6-in. water maln 1is
provided 20 ft from the building.

With regard to windstorms, the
building is designed to the Uniform
Building Code Criteria. These
criteria design against wind loads
of 20 1b/ft? (about 100 mph) without
exceeding the allowable normal working
stress of 20,000 psi in the steel
structure. A review of the meteoro-
logical data for this area shows that
1t 1s highly improbable that winds
of this magnitude will even be ap-
proached at the sheltered site of the
ARE.

THE ULTIMATE CATASTROPHE
Consideration of the reactor

hazards discussed above shows that
the worst possible accident would be

the release of overheated fuel with
simultaneous mixing of the NaK and
water in the heat exchanger pit. This
would require the planned coincidence
of several independent failures.

If, by some unknown means, separation
of the fuel should cause a deposition
of uranium in the reactor, it is con-
ceivable that the reactor could be
maintained above critical to the
boiling point of the fuel. If, at
this point, the fuel were then released
into the heat exchanger pit and
simul taneous leaks occurred in the Nak
and water lines, tremendous amounts of
heat and radioactivity, as given in
Appendix C (section on “Basic Data for
the ARE Catastrophe’” ), would be re-

44

leased i1nto the pits. The results of
such an accident are discussed in

Appendix C, ““Dispersion of Airborne
Wastes in the 7500 Area.”

It is inconceivable that such a
series of circumstances could occur
without the aid of a saboteur, and he
would have to know some magical
formula for selective separation of
the fuel and deposition of some of
it in the highest turbulence region
of the system, Furthermore, the
saboteur would have to provide means

HAZARDS TO THE SURROUNDING AREA IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE

DISPERSION OF AIRBORNE WASTES

A study has been made of the wind
direction, temperature gradients, and
rainfall in the Melton Valley, site of
the ARE, and calculations have been
made on the deposition of airborne
activity under these conditions (cf.,
Appendix C, “Dispersion of Airborne
Wastes in the 7500 Area’ ).

The lower layers of the atmosphere
tend to be stable more frequently than
unstable, with inversions occurring
56% of the time, annually. In general,
the stability is much more pronounced
in the deep layer of air 183 to 5000 ft
than in the 183-ft layer above the
ground. With these climatological
conditions, 1t is expected that any
contaminant emitted into the inversion
layer at ambient temperature will not
be mixed vertically but will remain at
or near its level of emission with a
minimum of dilution, whereas a con-
taminant emitted into an unstable
layer will be mixed through the un-
stable layer in a comparatively short
time, during which puffs of relatively
high concentration may be momentarily
brought to the ground.

The valleys in the vicinity of the
ARE are oriented northeast- southwest
1ﬁﬂroughly the same orlentatlon as the
broad valley between the Cumberland
Plateau and the Smoky Mountains. As
might be expected, considerable
channeling of the winds results from
this orientation. The direction of
the prevailing winds is upvalley from
southwest and west-southwest, with a
secondary mass of down valleywinds from
northeast and east-northeast. Wind
speed is, 1in general quite low,
averaging less than 4 mph. In general,
during nighttime or -unstable- con-
ditions, the winds tend to bg northeast
and east-northeast and rather low in
the valley, regardless of t%ﬁ gradient
wind. Very strong winds aloft, how-

ever, will control the velicities and

- ml-»

direction of the valley winds, re-
versing them or producing calms when
opposing local drainage. In awell-
developed stable situation, however,
a very light air movement will follow
the valley as far downstream as the
valley retains its structure. Air
transport from the valley location
will be governed by the local valley
wind and the degree of coupling winds.

Two special wind patterns are
assumed to be of some significance:
(1) from the 7500 Area northwest of
Haw Ridge to X-10, and (2) from the
7500 Area west to White Oak Creek,
then northwest through Haw Gap, and
finally north to X-10. Studies show
that the frequency of these wind
patterns is 2.5% over the ridge and
0.4% through the gap.

Since the upwind pattern at Knox-
ville seems almost identical with the
pattern for Oak Ridge, the longer
period records from the Knoxville Area
have been used for this study. The
northeast-southwest axis of the valley
between the Cumberland Plateau and the
Smoky Mountains, as mentioned before,
influences the wind distribution over
the Tennessee Valley, up to 5000 feet.
Above 5000 ft, this pattern gives way
to the prevalent westerly winds
usually observed at these latitudes.

Consideration of the relation be-
tween precipitation and winds shows
that there is little correlation be-
tween wind direction and rain.

Meteorological data have been used
to calculate the possible radiation
hazards to the civilian population as
a result of accidental release of
radioactive materials from the ARE.
If it is assumed that the mass energy
release of the reactor would not be
more than the energy released by the
explosion of an equivalent weight of
TNT, then approximately 1.75 x 10° cal
could be released from the reactor.
This might be augmented by the

45
ARE HAZARDS

reaction of 15 ft3 of NaK with water,
which could add about 8.5 x 108
calories, This accidental release of
heat would heat the 10,000 m® of air
in the building, shatter the building,
and a hot, radiocactive puff would be
emitted to the atmosphere. By using
Sutton’s formula for such a hot puff,
it 1s calculated that in the stable
case the radiocactive cloud would rise
to about 200 meters, and in the un-
stable case the cloud would level off
at 1500 meters.

It has been-calculated that the
radioactive cloud would contain
6.5 X 107 curies at 1000 sec after the
catastrophe. This would give a con-
centration of about 72 curies/m® for
the stable case and 3.6 curies/m? for
the unstable case. Sutton’s formula
for isotopic diffusion from an in-
stantaneous point source has been used
to calculate the mass concentration at
the ground during the passage of a
puff and the integrated exposure at
the ground for the entire time of
passage of the cloud. Similar calcu-
lations have been made on the assumption
that the radioactive cloud remains at
ground level and is essentially blown
away from the ARE building as it leaks
out. From these calculations, it
appears that the worst type of ca-
tastrophe would be one in which the
1odine would be released slowly tao the
atmosphere. In such an event, it is

likely that the tolerances for iodine

would be exceeded for very long dis-
tances at night and even to about 30
miles in the daytime. However, the
most likely occurrence is a reactor
failure in which the activity is con-
tained in the building. In this case,
the halogen in the NaK would be re-
moved and only the noble gases would
be released. For such a failure the
MPC would be exceeded out to 2 miles

at night and 0.3 mile in the daytime,

Calculations have also been made on
the result of arainout of the activity
in the radiocactive cloud. This activity
deposited on the ground would produce

46

a dosage rate of about 36 r/hr at a
height of 3 ft, assuming 1-Mev energy
at a distance of 1 mile at night, and
about 20 r/hr at 3 ft, assuming l-Mev
energy at a distance of 1 mile after
catastrophe occurred during the day-
time. The consequence of surface
water contamination from rainout 1is
discussed in the following section.

If the failure does not rupture the
concrete pits, the fission-product
activity will be discharged into the
500 m® of helium atmosphere contained
therein. The fission products may be
held up in the pits and then dis-
charged. After 1000 sec, the total
volatile activity (with augmentation
owing to a power excursion) will be
6.8 x 10° curies and will have an
average energy of decay of 1 Mev, Since
the maximum permissible ground concen-
tration for this energy is 1.6 x 107°
we/em®, the fission-product activity
may be discharged up the 100-ft stack
during a 5-mph wind at an initial rate
of 0.832 curies/min or 61.2 cm®/min,
which increases with time owing to decay.

The potential hazard owing to the
use of large quantities (9 % 10°% g) of
beryllium oxide in the reactor has
been considered. At worst the potential
contamination is about 25% of that of
the radiohalogen and the probable
contamination is considerably less,
since the beryllium oxide is in solid
blocks that are contained within the
pressure shell,

SURFACE WATER CONTAMINATION

The most serious source of surface
water contamination from acatastrophic
failure of the ARE would be from rain-
out of airborne radioactive wastes.
In this case, surface contamination of
the order of 10° curies per square
mile would be realized for 10 miles
within a 0,1 radian at night with a
wind speed of 11 mph at cloud level
(cf., Appendix-C). HRadioactivity of
this order of magnitude would be
expected to present a serious hazard
to people who use the Clinch and
Tennessee Rivers for their water
supply. Therefore a great deal of
work has been done, and more is under
way, on this problem. The discussion
is limited here to the possible ex-
posure of people through the use of
water supplies derived from the Clinch
River below ORNL and the Tennessee
River below the mouth of the Clinch
River,

Principle Water Supplies Affected.
The predominant winds in Melton Valley
are southwest during the day and
northeast during the night (cf.,
Appendix C). Rainout during a north-
east wind wouldaffect downstream water
supplies only; however, rainout during
a southwest wind would affect both
downstream and upstream supplies.
Four, downstream, domestic, water-
treatment plants are listed below.
These plants treat the water by
coagulation, sedimentation, and rapid
sand filtration. The two downstream
steam plants listed softentheir boiler
water by the Zeolite process.

1. K-25 Plant. There is a water-
treatment plant at K-25 to provide
drinking water for approximately 6000
people during working hours and process
water for the plant., There is also a
steam plant for which the water is
taken directly from the Clinch River.

2. Kingston Steam Plant (TVA).
Operation of the Kingston steam plant
might be affected through concen-
tration of radioactivity in the Zeolite
system or in the boilers. Drinking
water for the small operating force
could be obtained from a distant
source 1f necessary,

3. Harriman. The town of Harriman,
approximately 6500 population, 1is
located about 12 miles upstream on the
Emory River. Contamination at the
water plant 1is problematical, since
upstream flow from the Clinch River to
Harriman occurs onlyoccasionally under
special conditions of stratification,

for the water-treatment plant for
Watts Bar Village 1s located above

is a

Watts Bar Dam. The village
resort community with, perhaps,
maximum population.

5. Chattanooga. The city of
Chattanooga, approximately 131,000
people, has a water-treatment plant
with intake about 5 miles below
Chickamauga Dam. The plant provides
industrial and drinking water for the
city and several surrounding com-
munities.

Upstream from ORNL, rainout of air-
borne activity might affect Norris and
Clinton, as well as Oak Ridge. The
towns of Norris and Clinton do not
take raw water from the Clinch River,
The hazards to these two small towns
and other communities through drinking
water supplies might have to be con-
sidered, but they are not included in
this analysis of the effects of River
contamination.

In the case of Oak Ridge, the water
treatment plant, similar to those
described above, has 1ts intake located
on the Clinch River about 10 to 15
miles upstream from ORNL, The plant
supplies drinking water for the town
of Oak Ridge, with a population of over
30,000, and to two of the AEC plants
(X-10 and Y-12). An emergency plan
has been formulated by which, in case
of a shutdown of the water plant, the
water supply to the town would be cut
off temporarily and the relatively
small reserve storage of filtered water
would be used to continue operation of
the two plants. It has been estimated
that with average unregulated stream
flow in the Clinch River, passage of
water from Norris Dam to a point below
the Oak Ridge water plant would re-
guire a period of one to two days. A
more precise estimate of time of water
travel in this and other stretches of
the Clinch-Tennessee River is being
made through cooperation of the
Tennessee Valley Authority, but these
data are not presently available,

Method of Analysis. Following an
explosive release of fission products

47
ARE HAZARDS

from the ARE, contamination could
reach the Clinch River by (1) surface
flow through Melton Branch and White
Oak Lake or (2) the rainout of air-
borne contaminants either into the
water of the River or on land where
they would be flushed into the stream.
In either case, the level of activity
in the water at downstream points would
depend upon reduction by decay,
dilution, and various other factors,
The significance of the resultant
hazard also would depend upon various
factors such as the number of people
who might be exposed to contaminated
drinking water, the period of use of
the water, and the counter measures
that could be effected.

Any evaluation of the weight that
should be given to the numerous
modifying factors is subject to dif-
ferences of opinion or interpretation.
For this discussion, it 1s assumed
that a given amount of activity is
dispersed into Clinch River under
specific conditions and the resulting
downstream concentration and effects
are estimated. These estimates can
then be scaled to correspond to higher
or lower levels of contamination. The
very adverse conditions represented
correspond to the worst conceivable
catastrophe., Allowances can be esti-
mated later for mitigating conditions
or countermeasures. The basic as-
sumptions and data are the following:

1. The dispersed contaminants will
be mixed fission products that decay
in accordance with the formula®!’

v = -1.2
Activity At .

2. A concentration of 1073 uc/cmd
is an acceptable emergency value in
drinking water for use up to several
weeks,

3. Complete dispersion of the
contaminants in the volume of stream
flow is assumed except where stated
otherwise,

(1)

The Effects of Atomic Weapons, Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory, p. 252 (June 1950).

48

4. As a basis for estimates, it 1is
assumed that flow conditions in the
rivers are the average unregulated
flows for the period of record.

5. Dilution factors and time of
water travel determinations are based
on the average unregulated flows.

6. In case of airborne dispersal
followed by rainout into the Clinch
River upstream from the ARE, contami-
nation in the stream might extend from
Oak Ridge to Norris Dam.

The average unregulated flows used
in the estimates are: Clinch River at
ORNL, 4460 cfs; Tennessee River at
Watts Bar Dam, 26,400 cfs; Tennessee
River at Chickamauga Dam, 36,500 cfs.

It is believed that estimates
based on these average figures will be
representative, since the longer decay
time corresponding to lower flows and
the increased dilution owing to higher
flow values tend to be compensating.
Otherwise, conservative assumptions
are employed, since these estimates do
not take into account a number of
mitigating factors; for example, not
all the contaminants deposited on land
will be flushed into the stream;
activity will be removed from the water
by adsorption upon organisms and
sedimentation following settling;
water-treatment plants will remove
some of the activity; additional time
could be allowed for decay before use
of the water from the distribution
system; use of the water by the people
could be limited to only a portion of
the acceptable period of exposure.
Some of these factors are discussed
very briefly in a subsequent section.

Estimated Conditions of Water Con-
tamination. The effects of water
contamination on the several water
supplies downstream from the ARE are
of the greatest interest. Table 3 has
been prepared to show the estimated
radioactivity in the water at selected
points downstream, The data given
are based on the assumption that the
equivalent of one million curies of

activity existing 1 hr after the
catastrophe finds its way into the
Clinch River during a 2-hr period
following the explosion. It is presumed
that this would occur as a result of
continuous heavy rainfall at and
following the time of the disaster, and
that the radicactive cloud would travel
over the Clinch River and its drainage
slopes so that, at the end of 2 hr,
435,000 curies would be dispersed in
the Clinch River, with the center of
the mass of activity at the mouth of
White Oak Creek.

At points downstream the concen-
tration would be reduced, as shown 1in
Table 3, both by decay and by dilution,
based on the assumptions given in the
footnotes to the table, The data
indicate that serious conditions of
contamination might be expected
throughout the Clinch River and near
its entry into the main stream of the
Tennessee River. Below this point,
the concentration would be greatly
reduced by dispersion in the large
volumes of storage water in Watts Bar
and Chickamauga reservoirs.

Factors Affecting Water Contami-
nation. The brief analysis of con-
ditions 1n the Clinch-Tennessee River
system resulting from the release of
a large amount of activity has neces-
sarily been based on arbitrary as-
sumptions and average river conditions,
Although the data in Table 3 indicate
that serious conditions of contami-
nation might be expected throughout
the Clinch River, there are several
mitigating factors, presented below,
that could combine to effect a re-
duction of the calculated contamination
by several orders of magnitude. This
is in addition to the fact that the
initial assumption presupposed the
most catastrophic failure conceivable,

Amount of Activity that will Become
Waterborne. There 1s uncertainty as
to the total amount of activity that
will enter the stream from aparticular
event. This depends greatly on

50

meteorological conditions such as wind
direction and speed and rainfall or
other factors. In the event of fall-
out over land, a sizeable portion of
the activity will adsorb on soil and
vegetation and other organic matter
and will not reach the stream, except
in the event the material to which it
is attached becomes waterborne. This
factor tends to decrease ingestion
hazards.

Dispersal Characteristics. Data on
channeling, thermal stratification,
etc., are incomplete. It appears
to be reasonable to assume that at
Chattanooga, after passage through two
reservoirs and dams, the total volume
of river water will be available for
dilution purposes. As one progresses
upstream, this is less likely to be
true. In general, this factor tends
to increase the potential ingestion
hazard near the source of contami-
nation,

Other River Conditions. These
estimates have been based on average
stream conditions, but the flow
characteristics of a stream depend on
a complex pattern of interlocking
variables, particularly in a system
that is controlled by hydroelectric
dam installations. More definitive
data are now being assembled with the
cooperation of the TVA, However, it
is doubtful that any other set of
conditions would yield more infor-
mation for this analysis than average
stream conditions, unless one could
predict the exact date and situation
when an accident would occur. For
example, an increase in stream flow
would initiate compensatory reactions.
Although the time of flow between any
two points would be decreased and thus
the loss in activity by decay would be
decreased, the increased flow would
compensate for this by decreasing the
concentration of activity through
greater dilution.

Removal by Water-Purification
Plants. Communities that have treated
water supplies (coagulation-filtration)
have an added safety factor. Data on
the removal of a number of radio-
isotopes by water treatment procedures
may be found in the literature.(?’ A
conservative value that may be applied
to mixed fission-product removal by
alum coagulation and filtration
procedures is 70%.

Adsorption of Radioisotopes by
Clays. The following data should be
considered in connection with the next
section, ‘““Geological and Hydrological
Considerations,” as well as with this
section,

On exposure to natural clays under
conditions such that adsorption and
base exchange can occur, a large
portion of any released activity will
be firmly attached to the clays. If
the exposure occurs in a liquid medium
(natural turbidity), the ultimate
location of the activity should be in

the bottom sediments, otherwise 1t
should be as firmly fixed in situ as
are the clay particles, Although in-
formation on this subject is not com-
plete, the magnitude of activity
removal by this mechanism can be
inferred from the data in Table 4.
Parallel studies with clay columns,
rather than stirring tests, indicate
that the results are at least as good
as those implied in Table 4 and perhaps
better.

A comparison has been made between
the shale from this area and well-
defined clays from other locations by
the jar-stirring method, using 5 g of
clay in 500 ml of fission-product
solution at a level of 9000 ¢/m/ml
obtained by the addition of Chalk
River waste. The results of this
comparison are given in Table 5.

A large experimental waste storage
pit has been built at ORNL in shale.

this pit, and thus a comparison, under
natural conditions can be made with
the laboratory data (Table 5). Data
are being continuously accumulated,
but up to this time (after a period of
several months) no movement of activity
through soil has been noted, except a
selective movement of some of the
ruthenium. This observation is based
on activity measurements and radio-
chemical analyses of the water in test
wells located around the pit., It
should be noted that ruthenium has
very complex chemistry, and its
behavior under natural conditions is
less predictable from laboratory tests
than that of most other isotopes.

GEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Melton Valley, in which the ARE is
situated, 1s underlaid by the Conasauga
shale of the Middle and Upper Cambrian
Age. The more resistant rock layers
of the Rome formation, steeply inclined
toward the southwest, are responsible

52

for Haw Ridge, which is immediately
northwest of the ARE site., These layers
dip beneath the shalesof the Conasauga
group in Melton Valley. The shale layers
in the area are in keeping with the
general structure of the surroundin§
area as reported 1n a recent survey.(3
Thin layers and lensesof limestone are
common but are generally irregular in
distribution. However, there are no
persistent limestone beds in the area
and, consequently, no underground solu-
tion channels or caverns to permit rapid
and free discharge of water underground.

Observations 1n test wells in soil
comparable to that of the ARE site
show that the Conasauga shale, although
relatively impermeable, is capable of
transmitting small amounts of ground
water at a rate of a few feet per
week. Furthermore, all of the active
isotopes, except for ruthenium,
apparently become fixed in the immediate
vicinity of the point of entry into
the soil (cf., preceding section). It
may be concluded that such ground
water flow as may exist in the soil
surrounding the ARE will be small and
slow (few feet per week) and that such
flow will reduce the level of the
activity of mixed nonvolatile fission
products more than 90%,

Aside from rainout of airborne
wastes (discussed in precedingchapter),
the only conceivable sources of ground
water flow are (1) the normal discharge
of process water and (2) the discharge
of water used to flood the reactor pit.
The fuel itself does not react with
water and in 1ts presence would
solidify., Process water, the ultimate
heat sink i1in the reactor system, does
not come in contact with the fuel,
since helium is present as an 1inter-
mediate heat transfer fluid. It 1is
therefore improbable that the process

water would contain appreciable radio-
activity. However, since the water

will be discharged at rates up to
300 gpm, it would create a surface
stream. At the point of discharge,
100 ft southwest of the ARE building,
this stream will flow south and join
Melton Creek about 1/2 mile above
White Oak Creek (Fig. 1).

A dirt storage pond has been
excavated as a means of permitting
decay in water used to flood the
reactor pits after operation. The
fuel will be dumped before the pits
are flooded, but the reactor design 1is
such that up to 15% of the diluted fuel
may remain in the bottom of the fuel
circuit, This fuel, plus the residual
activity in the structure, contains
the radioactivity to which the water
is exposed., The water used for
shielding during postoperative service
on the reactor will be pumped to the
storage pond located approximately
1/4 mile southeast of the ARE building.
This area also drains into Melton
Creek, but no surface flow from the
pond to the creek is expected.

In view of the lack of serious water

favorable geological environment, there
does not appear to be any ground water

of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.
These observations were summarized
from Appendixes D and E, which are
preliminary reports, The Office of
Research and Medicine of the ORAEC
has indicated that it will soon under-
take an extensive survey of the
geological conditions inMelton Valley,
in particular as they are expected to
affect the dispersion of radiocactive
wastes of the reactors and waste pits.,

SUMMARY REPORT

SEISMOLOGY OF AREA

Information on the frequency and
severity of earthquakes 1in East
Tennessee has been obtained both from
Lynch¢*? of the Fordham University
Physics Department and from Money-
maker¢®) of the Tennessee Valley
Authority. Both sources indicated
that such shocks as occasionally
occur in the region are quite common
in the world and do not indicate
undue seismic activity., Consequently,
earthquakes should be of little
concern in connection with the ARE.

The TVA records show that the
Appalachian Valley from Chattanooga
to Virginia has an average of only one
or two earthquakes a year. Further-
more, the maximum intensity of any
of these shocks is 5 on the Woods-
Neuman scale. This intensity 1is
barely noticeable by ambulatory as
well as stationary individuals. For
any one location, such as Oak Ridge,
the expectancy of an earthquake would

be one i1n every few years.

The Fordham University records
indicate even lower quake frequency;
however, the severity of the observed
guakes i1s the same. Lynch further
concluded ‘‘that it i1s highly im-
probable that a major shock will be
felt in the area (Tennessee) for
several thousand years to come.”

DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION

The population distribution within
30 miles of the site of the ARE 1is
summarized in Tables 6, 7, and 8.
A 30-mile radius was used for the
population study because the meteoro-
logical studies showed that under
certain conditions following a disaster
a significant fraction of the maximum
radiation dose would be received at
these distances. Table 6 presents the
the total number of employees at the
various plant sites within the AEC
restricted area at Oak Ridge. Although
practically all these employees work
a 48-hr week, there is considerable
variance at the different plants in
the number on any one shift. Table 7
lists the surrounding towns with a
population of 500 or more. Table 8
gives the rural population by counties

for those parts of the counties within
0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 to 30 miles
of the site of the ARE. The latter
data were calculated by deducting the
urban (communities of 500 or more)
population and assuming that the
remaining population is uniformly
distributed. These data are therefore
approximate and are intended only to
give an order of magnitude. Figure 12
shows the surrounding counties and all
towns therein with apopulation greater

than 500.

VITAL INDUSTRIES AND INSTALLATIONS

A list of vital industrial and

A. PROCEDURE FOR REPAIRING LEAKS

System Testing. Testing of the

plumbing system will be scheduledto

facilitate making the necessary
repairs. The tests become pro-
gressively more rigorous; the earlier
ones reveal only the larger leaks,
whereas the final test should reveal
any leak that could be of concern
to the operation of the system. It
will be a relatively simple matter to
effect a repair indicated by the
first pneumatic test. Conversely, it
will be very difficult to repair a
leak that develops after the system
has been operated at power. Since the
tests have been arranged in an ascending
order of importance, it is not proposed
to revert to a lower order test when
a leak is found, but rather after a
leak 1s repaired only that test which
revealed the leak will be repeated
before progressing to the next step.
Locating and removing leaks from
the system at any point in the testing
procedure will obviously be time-
consuming, It therefore follows that
the best cure for leaks 1s prevention.
Every precaution will be used to
install a leak free system, and at no
time will the installation work be
hurried at the expense of quality
workmanship. The successful operation
of the ARE stands squarely on the
quality of the craftsmanship that goes
into the fabrication and installation.
This philosophy dictates every action
of those supervising the project.
Techniques for determining the
existence of a leak 1n the system at
elevated temperatures are rather
simple. For large leaks the in-
ability to obtain a vacuum will be
ample evidence; the presence of
smaller leaks will be indicated by
rates of pressure rise in the system.
However, locating the small leaks
will usually involve the application

of special techniques, as well as

instrumentation.

Leak Detection.
bubble test method, locating a leak
is tedious at best, since there 1s
no indirect method that reveals the
exact location. An effort 1s being
made to develop a coating that can be
applied to joints that will react with
NaK and leave an easily recognizable
and visible indication of the leak.
The system will be inspected after
cooling down to room temperature so
that visual inspection can be made.
Thus far, such a coating has not been
found, and it may not be possible
to employ such a technique.

The first leak test to be applied
to the system will be the bubble test
method. The system, at room tempera-
ture, will be placed under pressure
and the suspected parts, namely, the
welds, will be painted with soapy
water. Bubbles created in the soap
film will be evidence of leaks. This
test is simple but tedious, and will
spot only the larger leaks.

At the next stage of the operating
procedure (cf., section on ‘“Operating
Plan'), the system will be brought to
a temperature of 1200°F and made
isothesmal, with a vacuum maintained
in both the fuel system and the
reflector cooling system. A leak into
either of these systems will cause a
loss of vacuum there; the seriousness
of the leak will be determined by the
rate of pressure rise when the vacuum
pump 1s cut off. During this test,
helium will be circulated 1n the
annuli., Once it is determined that a
leak exists in the system, the power
in the heating circuits will be
lowered. The electrical wiring is
such that each separate weld can be
locally heated with all the remaining
portions of the piping left unheated.
With the helium no longer circulating,
all heating will be stopped except

Except by the

61
ARE HAZARDS

at the individual welds. All portions
of the system will cool except the
welds, which will be allowed to cool,
one ata time, by opening the electrical
heating circuits one at a time.
During all this time the pumps will
be evacuating both the fuel and
moderator volumes. If a leak occurred
at a particular weld at high tempera-
ture, it might disappear as the
temperature of the weld was lowered.
This might well be the case if ex-
pansion at the weld were to open up
a small crack. A leak with these
characteristics would be extremely
difficult to locate by cooling the
entire system to room temperature.
But if cooling a particular weld
eventually removes the leak so that
a vacuum can be maintained in the
system, then that particular weld is
faulty. The system could then be
cooled and the faulty weld repaired
or replaced. If, on the other hand,
cooling the welds individually did
not remove the leak, 1t would be
clear that there was a permanent leak,
which could then be located by the
soap and pressure test used for room
temperature leak testing.

In another stage of leak testing at
elevated temperature, NaK will be
circulated in both the fuel and
pressure shell cooling circuits at
1200°F. The DPI halogen detector
(which detects NaK) will be used to
sniff the helium flowing in the annuli
ai.out the pipes. An alarm will be
sounded by the detector when it finds
a leak. When the alarm sounds, 1t
i1s proposed to stop the helium flow
and cut off the heater power. As the
system cools down and air is slowly
admitted to the annuli, localized
oxidation of NaK will occur at the
leak. Removal of the insulation,
heaters, and annuli will reveal where
this oxidation took place.

l.eak Repair. All repairs involving
a welding operation must be preceded
by a careful cleansing of the system.
If there is liquid in the system, the

62

liquid must first be removed. This
is a tedious job, but an absolutely
necessary one, since all vapor must
be removed and an inert gas introduced
before any welding 1s done.

The method of effecting a repair
of a faulty weld will be the same as
that employed in making a new weld.
This procedure is outlined in detail
inthe welding instruction bulletin.(!)
When a repair is completed, the test
that revealed the leak will again be
applied to the system and, as previously
stated, the next step of the test
procedure will be initiated as soon as
the repaired leak has satisfactorily
passed the retest.

B. ANALYSIS OF ARE KINETIC RESPONSE
ON REACTOR POWER-PLANT SIMULATOR

A reactor power-plant simulator
has been developed and built, within
the past year, at ORNL. The simulator
was designed to be sufficiently
general to be used as an engineering
tool for determining means of con-
trolling nuclear reactor power plants.
It has been used to determine the
response of the ARE reactor to changes
in both excess reactivity and in load.

The simulator will be described in
detail in an ORNL report. Operations
such as addition, subtraction, differ-
entiation, and integration are carried
out by means of operational amplifiers.
These are high-impedance-input, high-
gain, d-c amplifiers, that are chopper-
stabilized against drift; they are
similar to the units used in the
numerous analog computers in this
country. There are twenty operational
amplifiers in this simulator.

Multiplication is accomplished in
this unit by converting the relatively
slowly changing quantity, which i1s the
coefficient of P(Eq. 1; cf., next sec-
tion), to binary digital form and using

(I)Procedure Specification for Direct-Current
Inert-Arec Welding of Inconel Pipe and Fittings for
High-Corrosion Applications, ORNL, Metallurgy
Division, September 1952,

this digital quantity to operate
weighted gates for admitting the
quantity P to an operational ampli-
fier. The weight of a particular gate
is determined by the significance of
the binary digit assigned to the gate.
The weights are in the sequence 1/2,
1/2%, 1/23, etc.

Equations for the ARE System. The
kinetic equations of the complete
power plant, including reactor and
heat exchanger system, constitute a
nonlinear set of differential equa-
tions, even in their simplest form,
The simplification involves numerous
assumptions and approximations gener-
ally justified by the fact that the
solution of the exact and complete
equations would be extremely tedious
and expensive., Consequently, it has
been found convenient to neglect the
nonuniform spatial power distribution
within the reactor and consider the
power uniform throughout the fuel
within the critical volume. Likewise,
the traveling-wave nature of the

delayed-neutron sources in the cir-

culation system external to the
critical lattice, represented analyti-
cally as a set of differential differ-
ence equations, has been replaced by
a steady state concept wherein the
external loop produces a fixed at-
tenuation of each class of delayed-
neutron contributions. Obviously,
the latter concept does not permit
a true representation of the system
for power transients,

- Some thought has been given to the
question of whether the fuel cir-
culation appreciably changes the power
distribution within the reactor, since
the delayed-neutron contributions are
considerably lower from a unit fuel
volume when it enters the critical
volume than whenit leaves the critical
lattice. It is the opinion of those
who have seriously considered this
question that this effect 1s probably
present but not significant,

The realization that complete and
exact equations representing the

SUMMARY REPORT

kinetics of the entire power plant
would be clumsy, to say the least,
has led to the establishment of the
practical set of equations given here.
The symbols used are defined in Table
Bl. The constants that were used
when these equations were set up on
the simulator are given in Table B2,

in which the term involving P was
added experimentally for stabilization
purposes.

Discussion of Equations. Equations
1 through 13 are, as mentioned before,
based on the assumptions that the
power distribution is spatially uniform
throughout the fuel within the critical
volume and that the delayed-neutron
contribution has constant attenuation
because of fuel circulation. Transport
lags in the system have been approxi-
mated by cascaded first-order lags in
the conventional manner. Simulation
of transport lag by this means 1is
comparable to mathematical expansion
of a function 1n a series in which as
many terms as are considered feasible
are used to provide satisfactory
accuracy.

64

The set of equations for the system
includes two equations for an external
control loop or servo system. This
feature is an integral part of the
simulator, since a basic problem in
reactor control 1s to determine the
need for such a servo system, as well
as 1ts performance specifications.,.
The stability of the reactor power
plant without this external control
loop 1s a function of many parameters
that are inherent in the design and
can be altered only by altering the
design. If the equations of the servo
loop are added to those of the rest of
the system, the combined set of
equations then represents a new
system that may very well be stable
even though the initial one without
the servo was unstable. Stabilization
will have thus been attained without
altering the reactor design, which
would have been necessary to alter the
parameters producing instability. It
1s then possible to evaluate the
performance characteristics of the
servo system required for stabili-
zation. If these requirements show
that the servo system is well within
the possibility of servo control, it
is safe to assume that the power plant
can be controlled by such means.

Although it can be shown that the
negative-reactivity temperature
coefficients of fuel and moderator
are sufficient to provide stability
of the ARE power plant, it has been
thought advisable to provide a servo
loop for controlling the system in the
event these temperature coefficients
are found to be of considerably smaller
magnitude than expected. It is not
proposed to operate the reactor if the
fuel temperature coefficient of
reactivity 1s found to be positive,
Such a condition would be dangerous
in the event of failure of an other-
wise adequate servo controller.

These temperature coefficients
provide an excellent master-slave
relationship between load and reactor
.

power, in which it is possible to
change the reactor power solely by
changing the load on the heat exchanger
and in which the mean reactor tempera-
ture is a function of reactivity only
during steady-state operation,

It is relatively simple to utilize
an error signal for the servo system
which maintains this master-slave
relationship for the reactor without
temperature coefficients but with
servo control. This error signal 1is
a linear combination of electrical
voltages proportional to errors 1in
reactor mean temperature and variations
in the quantity P - a(6, - 8.), where
P is the reactor power (measured as
neutron flux by fission chambers),
8, is the reactor outlet temperature,
Bi is the reactor inlet temperature,

and a is a constant dependent on fuel
flow rate. P - a(f, - 8.) is equal
to zero for all steady-state operation.

Response to Load and Reactivity
Perturbations. The simulator for the
reactor with temperature coefficients
has been tested for load and reactivity
perturbations. The system is stable,
even though extremely small pressure
surges develop on transients. In
fact, the system behaves quite slug-
gishly in that it always supplies load
demand with relative smoothness in

are shown in Figs. B2, 3, and 4.

signal proposed above. Since 1t
seemed plausible that a relatively
simple on-o0ff type of servo system
should suffice for controlling the
ARE power plant, such a servo system
was first simulated. There will be
no means for determining the mean
fuel temperature in the reactor, so
a synthetic or steady-state mean
temperature equal to the mean of the
reactor inlet and outlet temperatures
was used.

The synthetic on-off servo system
was satisfactory for controlling the
reactor in that the control was suffi-
ciently comparable with that provided
by temperature coefficients, Also, it
provided responses completely com-
patible with the signals used for
actuating safety devices for every
conceivable load or reactivity tran-
sient that could occur in normal
operation of the power plant. The
safety devices are of course provided
for abnormal operating conditions.

Examination of the synthetic on-off
system showed that, with suitable
gear trains, a small a-c reversible
motor 1s sufficient to move the
regulating rod at a satisfactory speed
and over a large enough range to meet
the specifications determined by the
simulated servo. The output power of
this motor 1is 200 w at 3500 rpm.

The motor, gear trains, simulated
temperature and flux or power sensing
devices, and amplifiers were assembled
and attached to the ARE power plant
simulator. The composite temperature
and flux error signal was used pre-
cisely as 1t 1s to be used in the ARE.
The regulating rod was simulated by
a weight with a traverse and speed
identical to that of the ARE. Re-
cording instruments for temperatures
and power identical to those of the
ARE were used for recording data on
these quantities.

Load and reactivity transients of
magnitudes equal to any conceived for
the ARE were provided for the system
to obtain response-~time data on these

SUMMARY REPORT

quantities, The curve of Fig. B5 shows
responses 1n power, reactor 1inlet
temperature, and reactor outlet
temperature for a load transient.
Figure B6 shows the power response to
a step in reactivity of 0.2%. These
responses differ little from those
previously determined for the system
with a simulated on-off servo,

Data derived from these simulator
studies indicate that if the reactor
has the assumed negative reactivity
temperature coefficients owing to fuel
and moderator, the servo system will
be superfluous and probably will not
be used. On the other hand, 1f these
coefficients are much smaller than
anticipated, the on-off servo system
provided will easily provide excellent
regulation and will result in behavior
that retains the master~slave relation-
ship between load and reactor expected
of a negative-temperature-coefficient
circulating-fuel reactor,

Wind speed and direction measure-
ments at a height of 70 ft at the
site of the proposed ARE have been

ARE HAZARDS

correlated with wind, temperature
gradient, and rainfall measurements
made at the ORNL Health Physics
Division weather station and elsewhere
in theOak Ridge Area and with measure-
ments of winds aloft at nearby Weather
Bureau stations to show the climatology
of the site. Specialized measurements
of the turbulence, wind-speed gradients,
and temperature gradients have been
used to make quantitative estimates of
the meteorological factors involved in
the travel and dilution of contamination
released deliberately or accidentally
at the site of the proposed ARE.

Stability of the Lower Layers of
the Atmosphere. The lower layers of
the atmosphere tend to be more frequently
stable than unstable and inversions
(constant or increasing temperature
with height) occur about 56% of the
time, annually. Fall 1is usually the
season with the greatest percentage of
hours with inversions, and summer, as
might be expected, is the season with
the least number of hours of inversions.
A summary of the seasonal percentage
of frequency of inversions, as measured
at ORNL, 1s given in Table Cl for the
period 1944 to 1951.

A frequency distribution of the
temperature gradient (Fig. Cl) shows
the smallest range of values in the
summer and fall and the greatest range

in spring and winter. Higher wind
speeds 1n winter and spring tend
to increase the percentage of neutral
or adiabatic lapse rates (dashed
vertical line) during these seasons.

Figure Cl also shows the distri-
bution of temperature gradient between
the surface and the 850-millibar
pressure level (approximately 5000 ft
MSL). The stability is much more
pronounced in the deep layer of air
than in the layer 183 ft above the
ground. A marked shift occurs, during
the spring, from the very stable
winter distributions to the slightly
stable summer distribution. By fall,
the transition to the stable winter
pattern begins. It should be noted
that the frequency of adiabatic or
neutral lapse extending through the
whole layer up to 5000 ft MSL is
not large.

Low level soundings taken at
0300E, 0900E, 1500E, and 2100E from
the summer of 1949 through the fall
of 1950 are summarized in Fig. C2.
The average temperature gradients of
the lowest 1000 ft are the most
affected by diurnal changes. The
nocturnal inversion is well developed
in the 0300E and 2100E soundings.
This inversion, which forms after
sunset, usually builds up to 400 to
800 ft, with the stable layer ex-
tending higher, often to 5000 feet.

TEMPERATURE IN °*F

Fig. C2. Low-Level Temperature Soundings.
The afternoon temperature gradients,
as shown by the 1500E soundings, are
very unstable in the lowest 100 ft
and usually are neutral or slightly
unstable to several thousand feet.

The implications of these climato-
logical conditions are that it 1is
expected that any contaminant emitted
into the inversion layer at ambient
temperature will not be mixed verti-
cally, but will remain at or near
its level of emission with a minimum
of dilution, whereas a contaminant
emitted into an unstable layer will
be mixed through the unstable lavyer
in a comparatively short time during
which puffs of relatively high concen-
tration may be momentarily brought to
the ground.

Winds in Relation to Stability.
The valleys in the vicinity of the
site are oriented northeast-southwest,
and considerable channeling of the
winds in the valley may be expected.
This i1s evident in Fig. C3, which
shows the annual frequency distri-
bution of winds at the stations
operated in the vicinity of ORNL
during the meteorological survey.
The flags on these wind rose diagrams
point in the direction from which the
wind comes. The prevailing wind
directions are upvalley from southwest
and west-southwest, with a secondary
maximum of downvalley winds fromnorth-
east and east-northeast. The prevailing
wind regimes reflect the orientation
of the broad valley between the
Cumberland Plateau and the Smoky
Mountains, as well as the orientation
of the local ridges and valleys.
The gradient wind in this latitude is
usually southwest or westerly, so the
daytime winds tend to reflect a mixing
down of the gradient winds. The night
winds represent drainage of cold air
down the local slopes and the broader
Tennessee Valley. The combination of
these two effects, as well as the
daily changes in the pressure patterns
over this area, gives the elongated

SUMMARY REPORT

shape of the typical wind rose at a
channeled valley station.

During inversions, the northeast
and east-northeast winds occur most
frequently, usually at the expense of
the southwest and west-southwest winds.
Many of these drainage winds are very
light and are below the starting
speed of the anemometers available.
This characteristically increases the
percentage of calms recorded during
the night under stable conditions.
It may be seen in Fig. C4 that the
percentage of calms is much higher
under stable conditions at the 7500
area than under unstable conditions.
The predominance of light northeast
and east-northeast winds under stable
conditions 1s particularly marked in
the summer and fall when the lower
wind speeds aloft and the smaller
amount of cloudiness allows the
nocturnal drainage patterns to develop.

In Fig. C4, the unstable wind
roses are typical of the daytime
conditions when turbulence and dilution
are most pronounced. Wind speeds
under these conditions are usually
above average. The stable wind roses
are typical of nighttime when lower
wind speeds, little turbulence, and a
minimum of dilution are observed.

A comparison (Fig. C5 and Table C2)
of the winds of 140 ft at the X-10
site and the winds at 70 ft at the
7500 area for 1951 shows that the
distribution of direction 1s not
greatly different at the two locations.
The chief characteristics of the 7500
area winds are the lighter speeds and
a higher degree of channeling. This
is to be expected with the lower
anemometer height and narrower valley
at the 7500 saite.

Further comparison of the 1951
X-10 site winds with the adjusted
l6-point average of the 1944 to 1950
winds at the same location indicates
that the 1951 wind distribution was
very similar to the average for the
longer period and hence the 7500 area

wind data for 1951 would not be very
different from a longer period record
at that site. It should be noted
that the higher frequency of calms at
the X-10 site in 1951 is caused by the
starting speed of 2 to 3 mph for the
generator anemometer at that location,
whereas the 7500 area instrument and
the older X-10 instrument bhad starting
speeds of under 1 mph.

The seasonal distribution of
average hourly wind speed for 1951 1is
shown in Table C3.

Local Variation in the Winds.
Considerable variation i1s observed
both in wind speed and direction with-
in small distances in Bethel Valley
and Melton Valley. A study of the
wind flow patterns that occur during
the warm and cold halves of the year

with several groups of stability in
the lowest 5000 ft under various
regimes of 5000-ft wind direction and
speed was made. All the hourly wind
observations from thestations operated
during the meteorological survey of
1949 to 1950 were sorted by these
parameters, and the prevailing direction
for each station was plotted.

Examples of the effects of these
parameters on the local winds in the
vicinity of the X-10 site are illus-
trated in Figs. C6 and 7. These wind
patterns are typical of the winter, or
cold half of the year, when vegetative
cover is at a minimum and the surface
is less sheltered from the winds
aloft. Station 010 was located within
the tree cover on Haw Ridge and 1s
typical of the travel of contaminants

released at low levels on a north
facing slope. All four patterns shown
in Fig. C6 occurred with the same wind
direction at 5000 ft MSL, that 1is,
from the southwest. In the daytime,
when the air is relatively unstable
through the 5000-ft layer, the local
winds tend to follow the upper winds
in direction. The degree with which
they follow is determined mainly by
the speed of the upper winds. With
the 5000 ft winds ranging between
5 and 14 mph, direct upslope winds
occur on Chestnut Ridge, but the
valley stations follow closely. If
the upper wind speed is increased to
30 to 59 mph, all the stations follow
quite well, except the station under
the trees at Haw Ridge.

During the night, 1f the air 1is
stable and there are light upper
winds, the winds on the surface follow
their own pattern of drainage of cold
air from the local ridges down the
local valley and the deeper current
down the Tennessee Valley. ' If the
wind speed in the upper layer 1is
increased to 30 to 59 mph and all
other parameters remain the same, the
more exposed stations follow the
southwest wind, and the percentage of
calms increases considerably at most
stations. The well-protected stations

82 .

have the drainage wind cancelled and
their prevailing wind becomes calm.
It is interesting to note that the
wind velocity at Melton Hill (1431 ft
MSL) is reversed from a drainage wind
of 14 mph to a gradient wind of 11 mph
during the night merely by an increase
of the upper wind from light to strong.

In Fig. C7, theeffect of crossridge
gradient winds from the north and
northwest at 5000 ft MSL is shown
under the same combinations of speed
and stability as in Fig. C6. Here
again, even with the upper winds
blowing across the ridges, the valley
stations tend to follow the gradient
winds in daytime with a fidelity
dependent on the speed of the upper
wind. It should be noted, however,
that the probability of the wind
following the prevailing direction
is smaller for the crossvalley wind
than the upvalley wind. Under stable
conditions at night, downvalley flow
again predominates when the upper
winds are light and at right angles
to the valley orientation. When the
upper wind speed is strong, the surface
winds tend to follow it, except at
sheltered locations where the prevailing
wind 1s generally calm or at least
below the starting speed of the
anemometers.

Low-Level Variation in Winter Winds with Northwest and North Winds
Generalizing from these examples
and others that have been studied, it
may be said that in nighttime or in
stable conditions, the winds tend to
be generally northeast and east-
northeast and rather light in the
valley, regardless of the gradient
wind, except that strong winds aloft
will control the velocity and direction
of the valley winds, reversing them
or producing calms when opposing the
local drainage. In the daytime, the
surface winds tend to follow the winds
aloft, with increasing reliability,
as the upper wind speed increases.
Only with strong winds aloft or winds
parallel to the valleys would it be
of value to attempt to extrapolate air
movements for any number of miles by
using valley winds. In the well-
developed stable situation, however,
a very light air movement will follow
the valley as far downstream as the
valley retains its structure, even
though the prevailing winds a few
hundred feet above the ground are in
an entirely different direction. In
general, air transport from a valley
location will be governed by the local
valley wind regime and the degree of
coupling with the upper winds.

patterns of wind flow were assumed
to be of significance: (1) from the
7500 area northwest over Haw Ridge to
the X-10 area, and (2) from the
7500 area west to White Oak Creek,
then northwest through Haw Gap, and
finally north to the X-10 area.

Simul taneous wind records for four
months at the 7500 area, X-10 area,
two stations in Haw Gap, and a station
at the top of the adjoining Chestnut
Ridge were punched into IBM cards and
a study made of the occurrence of the
two patterns. For pattern (1) it was
required that each of the stations at
the 7500 area, Chestnut Ridge top, and
the X-10 area have a wind direction
within the sector east-southeast

through south. For pattern (2) it was
required that the 7500 area station
have a wind within the sector east-
northeast through southeast, both the
Gap stations have winds between
east-southeast and south-southwest,
and the X-10 area have a wind between
south and west-southwest.

The frequencies of these patterns
during theperiod September to December
1950 were normalized to the 1944 to
1951 wind record at the X-10 area by a
ratio method. The normalized frequen-
cies are shown in Table C4 for: (1) all
cases, (2) daytime (unstable) only,
(3) night (stable) only, (4) light
winds only (1 to 4 mph at X-10),
and (5) stronger winds only (5 mph
and above at X-10).

Upper Winds. A comparison of the
pibal observations made throughout
1949 to 1950 at Knoxville and Oak Ridge
shows that above about 2000 ft the
wind roses are almost i1dentical at
these two stations. This identity in
the data makes possible the use of the
longer period of record (1927 to 1950)
from Knoxville to eliminate the
abnormalities introduced by the use of
the short record at Oak Ridge.

for Nashville (1947 to 1950) are
available that consist of observations
taken regardless of the current
weather at the time of observation.
A comparison of these wind roses for
Knoxville and Nashville shows that
the mode for winds above 3000 meters
MSL should be shifted to westerly
instead of west-northwest when
observations with rain are included in
the set. In summer and fall, the
winds aloft are lightest and the
highest winds occur during the winter
months at all levels.

Table C5 shows the annual frequency
and speed of the winds aloft for
Knoxville for several representative
levels.

The northeast-southwest axis of the
valley between the Cumberland Plateau
and the Smoky Mountains continues to
influence the wind distribution over
the Tennessee Valley up to about

SUMMARY REPORT

the Valley do not extend above about
2000 feet. Above 5000 ft, the south-
westerly mode gives wayto the prevailing
westerlies usually observed at these
latitudes.

Correlation of Winds with Precipi-
Figure C5 contains a wind
rose for the surface wind at the X-10
site, for which only the hours of
observation i1n 1951 during which
precipitation was measured were used.
The direction distribution 1s very
little different from that of all
observations. This 1s consistent with
the experience of precipitation
forecasters that there 1s little
correlation between surface wind
direction and rain, particularly
in rugged terrain. Figure C8 shows
the upper winds measured at Nashville
during the period 1948 to 1950 when
precipitation was occurring at obser-
vation time. In general the prevailing
wind at any given level is shifted to

Catastrophe’’) to that available to
heat the released fission products
and air in the ARE building. '

The working assumption was made
that just sufficient heat would be
released in the disaster to bring the
reactor structure and fuel to about
1400°C, which would result in the
boiling of the fuel and the melting
of the Inconel. Only this amount of
heat, about 4.4 X 10% cal, would be
needed to heat to about 180°C the
10,000 m® of air in the building that
would contain the total activity of
the reactor, either as vapor or as
small particles under 50 microns.
This calculation presents a much more
pessimistic picture meteorologically
than one in which all the available
energy 1s utilized to push the initial
cloud higher into the air, which
allows greater dilution before 1t
rgaches the ground.

Height of Rise. Sutton(?) has
obtained an approximate solution for
the temperature excess of a rising hot
puff originating 1n an instantaneous
point source of heat and mixing with
its environment by eddy diffusion.
Satisfactory verification was obtained
by comparison with published data on

the Trinity explosion. Sutton's

where Af_ is the difference, in
degrees centigrade, between the
average potential temperature of the
cloud and the potential temperature of
the atmosphere, the latter being
assumed by Sutton to be constant with
height. The potential temperature 1is
the actual temperature of the air if
it were compressed adiabatically to
1000 marllibars. Qﬁ is the total heat

density, 1.2 x 10%® g/m®. C is the
virtual diffusion coefficient that
takes into account the natural turbu-
lence of the air and the enhanced
turbulence introduced by the hot puff.
Sutton gives an estimated range of
values, 0.3 to 0.6m'/%, for this
parameter, based on studies of shell
bursts. The 0.3 value is used here,
since the calculation 1s for a rela-
tively stable thermal stratifi-
cation.(®> Z is the height above the
source, meters. m 1s a parameter
resulting from the increase in size
of the effective diffusing eddies
during the spreading of the cloud.
Its value 1s estimated by Sutton,
from a wide variety of evidence, to
be 1.75 in the average case.

In order to determine the level
in a stable atmosphere at which the
cloud reaches thermal equilibrium,
1t 1s assumed that the vertical
gradient of potential temperature in
the atmosphere i1s a constant, 0 and
that at the equilibrium level the
temperature excess of the cloud with
respect to a neutral atmosphere 1is
just balanced by the actual increase
in potential temperature of the
atmosphere with height. Then,

cloud base). According to Sutton’s
formula, the temperature excess would
then be:

has been found that at greater distances
and for periods of sampling greater
than about 3 to 5 min, the formula
gives values that are too high by a
factor of 4 to 8.(?) This error can
be attributed to meandering or gross
displacement of the gas cloud by large
eddies with periods of the order of
several minutes, which are not wholly
accounted for even by using the 15-min
standard deviations of direction 1in
the Ciformula (Sutton used 3-min
samples). Since the exact value of
this correction factor is not known
for all meteorological conditions and
types of terrain, no allowance has
been made for it in these calculations,
but the resulting concentrations should
be regarded as upper limits for the
conditions specified, rather than as
averages.

The assumptions are made that all
the activity in the reactor at the
time of the catastrophe is augmented
by a runaway with an augmentation of
about 7.7 times the normal activity
at 3 megawatts. The volatile activity,
consisting of the noble gases, the

halogens, and the Sr°® is contained
in the 10,000 m? of air in the building.
A nominal leakage rate of 1000 ft® per
day is postulated to allow the con-
tained activity to leak into the air
and be diffused downwind continuously.

The values of the parameters used
in these calculations are givenm 1in
Table C9.

Substitution of the values of
Table C9 in Eq. 13 gives the values
in Table C10 for the expected concen-
tration downwind from the 7500 Area
(Fig. Cl1).

From these calculations 1t appears
that the worst type of catastrophe
would be one in which the 1odine would
be released slowly to the atmosphere.
In such an event, it 1is likely that the
tolerance for iodine would be exceeded
for very long distances at night and
even to about 30 miles in the daytime.
If 0.03% or less of the halogens were
released at night and 0.2% or less in
the daytime, the MPC’'s would not be
exceeded outside the exclusion radius
of 0.5 mile.

The most likely consequence of a
reactor failure in which the activity
is contained in the building would be
the binding of the halogens in the Nak

and the release of the noble gases,
which would only exceed the MPC out
to 2 miles at night and 0.3 mile in
the daytime.

Beryllium Hazard. The ARE will
contain approximately 9 X 10° g of
hot-pressed beryllium oxide as moderator
and reflector. The dispersal of this
hard-fired material into the rising
cloud from the catastrophe postulated
would result in a hazard that could
best be compared to the hazard of the
radiohalogens. It is certain that not
all of the beryllium oxide could be
powdered sufficiently to allow the
material to remain airborne. If the
particles were about 1000 to 1500
microns in diameter, they would settle
out in 2 to 5 min at night or in about
5to 15 minin the daytime, representing
a danger zone ranging from 1/2 to
1 mile (night) to 1 1/2 to 5 miles
(day) downwind.

Since the peak concentration that
should be permitted for a single
exposure to beryllium is 2 1/2 x 10°°

g/m3, the worst risk will be about
one-fourth of that for i1odine, con-
sidering a nighttime cloud, and about
one-sixteenth of that for i1odine,
considering a daytime cloud.

Rainout. A reasonable assumption
is that rain of moderate i1ntensity
continuing for a period of 1/2 hr
would wash out approximately one half
the particulate matter of a cloud
from an instantaneous source, A
simple approximation to the surface
contamination by rainout is obtained
by conservatively assuming an angle
of spread of the cloud, downwind,
equal to 0.1 radian. Then the area
covered by the cloud per unit time
will be roughly 0,lux. At the rate
of 50% per 30 min, the total amount
deposited will be Q/0.1lux in curies/mi?,
where Q i1s the source strength in
curies, 4 1s the wind speed in mph,
and ¥ 1s the distance in miles.

For @ equal to 6.8 X 10° curies
(total volatile activity at 1000 sec)
and u equal to 11 mph at the cloud
level at night and 18 mph at the cloud

level during the day, the surface
contamination (in curies/mi?) will be:

NIGHT DAY
At 1 mile 6.2 x 108 3.8 x 108
At 10 miles 6.2 x 10°% 3.8 x 10°

This activity deposited on the
ground would produce a dosage rate of
about 36 r/hr at a height of 3 f¢t,
assuming l-Mev energy at a distance
of 1 mile at night, and about 20 r/hr
at 3 ft, assuming l-Mev energy at a
distance of 1 mile if the catastrophe
occurred during the daytime.(lo)

Continuous Discharge from a Stack.
The discharge from the stack located
on the ARE building will be controlled
under the following two conditions:
the stack valve will not be open
unless a wind velocity of 5 mph is
measured and the activity of gas in
the holdup tanks 1s such that the
released activity will be less than
2.5 curies/minof Xe'?3 (average energy
about 0,35 Mev after holdup) or equiva-
lent, which is obtained by Sutton’s
formula for maximum ground concen-
tration from an elevated source:

X.'neuh2
Q=

Q = emission rate, curies/sec,

X, = MPC for Xe'**, 1x10°® curies/m?,
u = wind speed, mps,
h = effective stack height, meters.

This formula 1s rather conservative
when tested by experimental measure-
ments and the MPC i1s that for small
bodies, which should be doubled for
large bodies. These factors imply a
safety factor of at least 4 in the
concentration downwind from the small,
30-meter, l-in. -dia pipe that serves
as a stack for the ARE

If the reactor pits or dump tank
pits should be contaminated and the

activity contained in the pits, then
the contaminated atmosphere could be
pumped off after suitable decay, under
the restrictions imposed by the inter-
locked monitor and anemometer.

It will not be possible for a
continuous stream of helium to purge
off the gases as they collect in the
surge tanks, but they can be allowed
to bubble off at the rate of production,
diffuse through the holdup tanks, and
be emitted when the activity and wind
speed requirements are met. The
fission gases will be bubbled through
a NaK scrubber to absorb the halogens
and hence will consist only of the
noble gases. The cell atmosphere
also passes through the halogen
scrubber if for any reason it has to
be pumped out.

Summary. Calculations of the upper
limits of ground concentrations and
exposures from hypothetical catas-
trophic failures of the ARE have been
presented. If the reactor could be
melted and the NaK reacted with water
to blow the activity in the air with
more than 3% of the halogens released
to the air in an instantaneous puff,
then the MPC would be exceeded at
a distance of 15 to 20 miles during
the daytime. At night the release of
more than about 0.05% of the halogens
would exceed MPC at a distance of
7 to 12 miles.

If the disaster were contained 1in
the building and a leakage of the
contaminated air occurred at the rate
of 1000 ft3®/day, the release of more
than about 0.03% of the iodine would
result in tolerance being exceeded
beyond the 0.5 mile radius given by
the exclusion formula X = 0.01 (power
in kw)1/2,

There is also considered to be a
risk of contamination by beryllium
oxide, which 1s about 25% of the
hazard to the radiohalogens, aggravated
by the lack of decay in the beryllium
oxide and the continuing danger of
relocation of the particles after
they have fallen to the ground.

Theoretical Heat Evolution from the
Combination of NaK with water. When
a sodium-potassium mixture (44 wt %
Na and 56 wt %K), with adensity of
about 0.7 g/cm®, reacts with water,
the hydrides of the metals are formed
first and hydrogen is evolved, which
then burns violently. The end products
are the hydroxides of the metals.
For the reaction to go to cumpletion,
as indicated in the following, suffi-
cient oxygen must be present:

4Na + 0, + 2H,0 —> 4NaOH ,
4K + 0, + 2H,0 —> 4KOH .

Initial Temperature Prediction of a
Radioactive Cloud. If a catastrophe is
postulated in which the reactor core
reaches a temperature of 2500°F and
causes the fuel to be boiled off, 1t
can be further postulated that, as the
components cool down, the heat given
off will raise the temperature of the
room atmosphere. It will be assumed
that the reactor shell is not involved
with the rise of temperature. This
latter assumption 1s severe, Ssince
it means a lesser cloud temperature
and, consequently, a smaller rise for
the radioactive particles.

D. OCCURRENCE OF GROUND WATER AT THE
ARE SITE(!1)

R. M. BRichardson, Geologist
U. S, Geological Survey
Ground Water Branch
Knoxville, Tennessee

The following remarks are based on
a brief investigation made in col-
laboration with P, B, Stockdale of the
University of Tennessee. - They are
preliminary in nature and are given in
advance of approval by the Director of
the U. S. Geological Survey.

The ARE site is located in Melton
Valley, 1 1/2 miles southwest of the
Roane-Anderson County line. Melton
Valley is underlaid by the Conasauga
shale of Middle and Upper Cambrian
Age. The Conasauga shale consists of
light-brown, light-green, and dull-
purple shale., Thin layers and lenses
of limestone are common, but seem to
be generally irregular in distribution,
The rocks dip to the southeast at an
angle of about 35 degrees. Owing to
crumpling, the angle of dip may be
much greater locally. The Conasauga

shale weathers to a thin acid soil
full of shale chips. The soil mantle
is rarely more than a few feet in
thickness.

Although field investigations of
the rate and direction of ground-water
movement have not been made at the
ARE site, observations made at the
lagoon or liquid waste pit constructed
at ORNL this year are relevant to the
present investigation. The pit, which
is in Melton Valley about 1 mile
southwest of the ARE site, is excavated
in the Conasauga shale. While the
rocks at the lagoon are younger than
those at the ARE site, it is probable
that they are similar in their hydro-
logic characteristics.

Mineralogical examination of a
sample of Conasauga shale from the
waste pit, made by the Geochemistry
and Petrology Branch of the U. S.
Geological Survey, showed the follow-
ing: 19% CaCO, (loss on acid treat-
ment), 87% silt-grade particles (0.06
to 0.002 mm); 12% clay (0.002 mm);
base exchange capacity, 28.6 milli-
per 100 g; minerals,
quartz, little

equivalents
mica-type mineral,
halloysite.

Observations of fluctuations in the
level of liquid in the lagoon and in
test wells near 1t indicate that, al-
though relatively impermeable, the
Conasauga shale is capable of trans-
mitting small amounts of ground water.
The rate of movement is probably rather
slow and would be expressed in terms
of a few feet per week.

That ground water moves through
minute fractures and joints in the
shale rather than through solution
cavities in the intercalated limestone
lens 1s indicated by radiometric
analyses of liquid taken from wells
near the pit. Several weeks after
liquid waste containing mixed fission
products was introduced into the
lagoon, water in one of the wells was
found to be contaminated. Analyses
showed that this activity was solely
from ruthenium. Since the waste in
the pit contained many other isotopes,
it is probable that most of the activity
had been fixed in the immediate
vicinity of the pit by ion exchange
with clay contained in the Conasauga
shale.

Laboratory investigation of the
removal of radioactive 1sotopes by
samples of Conasauga shale from the
waste pit has been made by the Ligquid
Waste Disposal Research Section of the
Health Physics Division of ORNL (cf.,
section on “Surface Water Contami-
nation”). Tests by the jar-stirring
method using eight different isotopes
and two composite samples containing
mixed fission products showed es-

sentially complete removal of Ba'*?,

Cel44, Cs!37, P32 Ru'®6, and Zr95,
Removal of I'3! and Sr®® was reasonably
good, being 66,9 and 76.8% per 20 g of
shale, respectively. Removal of
activity from the samples of mixed
fission products was 98.2%. The
level of activity of the various
samples used averaged 7200 counts/min/ml.

Although these data are preliminary,
they indicate that with respect to
ground water the ARE site apparently
does not present features that could
be considered potentially hazardous.

E. BEDROCK GEOLOGY IN THE AREA
SURROUNDING THE ARE SITE(!?)

P. B, Stockdale
University of Tennessee

The ARE site is located near the
north edge of a northeast-southwest
trending valley trough, often referred
to as Melton Valley, which is bounded
on the northwest by Haw Ridge and on
the southeast by Copper Ridge. More
specifically, the site is three-fifths
of a mile east of the water gap across
Haw Ridge through which White Oak
Creek runs in passing from Bethel
Valley into Melton Valley. The site

( 12)Prelilinary Reporet.

SUMMARY REPORT

is covered by the Tennessee Valley
Authority-U. S. Geological Survey
topographic map of the Bethel Valley
quadrangle, designated as No. 130-NE,
published in 1941,

The principal streams in Melton
Valley are White Oak Creek, below the
water gap across Haw Ridge, and its
tributary Melton Branch. White Oak
Creek empties into White Oak Lake,
which serves as a final settling basin
for certain of the liquid waste
products that are discharged from
operations at X-10 into White Oak
Creek and thence into the lake.
Surface drainage of the area surround-
ing the ARE goes intosmall tributaries
that lead into Melton Branch and in
turn into White Oak Creek. The
general physiographic and topographic
setting of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory is treated in a recent
report,(!®) which contains a special
chapter on hydrologic features written
by G. D, DeBuchananne of the Ground
Water Branch of the U. S. Geological
Survey.

Only brief reconnaissance study has
been made of the geologic conditions
at the ARE site, where the underlying
rock, as well as that throughout most
of Melton Valley, belongs to ageologic
unit known as the Conasauga group.
Detailed measurements and studies
of this unit have not been made,
although a general examination was
made in connection with the previously
mentioned report, (!3) The rocks of
the Conasauga group are mainly shale,
mostly light-green, dull-purple, and
drab to olive-gray in color, with
considerable reddish-brown to black
stain, Although the shale 1s somewhat
variegated in places, it does not
possess the color brilliance that
typifies the rocks of the Rome for-
mation beneath, In the main, the
shale is argillaceous to slightly
silty, with considerable amounts of
slightly calcareous material. Most of
the shale tends to weather to a flaky
appearance, with abundant small chips,

103
ARE HAZARDS

Throughout, there occur in varying
quantities at different horizons, thin
siltstone layers, generally less than
l-in, thick, which stand out as ribs
on weathered slopes and break up into
small, angular blocks. Occasional
limestone lenses are found interbedded
in the shale., These lenses increase
in abundance upward in the formation.
The basal portion of the Conasauga
shale has been referred toby J. Rogers
as the Pumpkin Valley Formation. Not
far above the base of the Conasauga,
is a zone with a superabundance of
thin siltstone ribs, sufficient in
resistance to account in part for a
line of low hills, or knolls, that
rise above the valley floors carved in
the softer shales. Such is exhibited
along the northwest side of Melton
Valley in the area of the ARE site.
The shale is generally impervious. It
is characterized by abundant, minute
joints that are interconnected and
traverse the beds invarious directions.
In the topmost 200 ft or more of the
Conasauga group, there occur numerous
beds of gray limestone of various
textures and thicknesses separated by
shale zones. Some are dense; some
coarsely crystalline; some oolitic in
texture. Many of the limestone beds
are but a few inches thick; others
are massive, up to several feet thick.
The massive limestone portion at the
top of the Conasauga group is known as
the Maynardville limestone member. The
total thickness of the Conasauga group
in the Oak Ridge area is at least

1500 feet.

not been made.
The more resistant rock layers of

the Rome formation, steeply inclined
toward the southeast, are responsible
for Haw Ridge, immediately northwest

Exact measurements have

of the ARE site. These layers dip
beneath the shales of the Conasauga
group in Melton Valley. The Rome
rocks, which are sandstones and shales,
grade into the adjoining younger
Conasauga shales and thus make diffi-
cult the placing of the exact boundary
between the two stratigraphic units.
The ARE site lies upon the basal shales
of the Conasauga group, not far distant
from the adjoining Rome shales to the
northwest, '

The shale layers in the area under
consideration are inclined to the
southeast, generally at an angle in
excess of 30 degrees. The strike of
the beds is approximately N58°E. This
i1s in keeping with the general structure
of the surrounding area, as reported
in the previously mentioned study.(13)
Because of the general incompetence of
the Conasauga beds, a variety of minor
structural features and variations
occur.

Since there are no persistent
limestone beds in the immediate area
of the ARE site, there are no sinkholes
or underground solution channels and
caverns to permit rapid and free dis-
charge of waters underground.
