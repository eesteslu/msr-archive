SEMICONTINUOUS REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EXPERIMENTS

’ The new salt feed-and—catch tank was installed 1n the system, and
iron oxide was partlally removed from it ‘and from the system by contacting
the equlpment with hydrogen.u Reductant was added to the blsmuth about
20 liters of salt (72-16 12 mole % LiF-BeF —ThF ) was charged to the sys-

;-tem to replace salt that had been dlscarded w1th the orlglnal salt feed-
~ and-catch tank, and both phases were circulated through the system in
h;order to . complete the removal of ox1des. After the addltlon of a small
_'_1amount of 21rcon1um to restore the system 1nventory to about 15 g,rboth

DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
INSPECTION OF EXPERIMENT MTE-2

The equipment used for metal transfer process experimentrMTE—z, com-

pleted previously, was disassembled and inspected. Some blistering and

cracking of the 20-mil-thick nickel aluminide coating had oecurred‘duringh

-the 2370-hr period that the vessel had been held at_650°C.'_Thevessel__
- was sectioned in a manner.euch that the salt and bismuth nhaeeS'could
be observed. The salt and bismuth phases appeared to be clean, and
the ‘Interfaces were free of contamination. A black material which
‘covered the vessel wailin the fluoride compartment is thouéht_te be

a mixture of salt and finely divided bismuth,

Deposits containing unusually high concentrations of rare earths
were observed on the lip -and overflow spout of the Li Bi alloy contalner
| and in the bottom layer of the Th-Bi solutlon._ The total quantltles of
rare earths in these dep051ts were only 5 to 10% of the rare-earth 1n—'

ventories in the system.-

The inside of the carbon steel vessel appeared to be in gobd eondi—
tion except for corr051on ‘on items that vere constructed of thin carbon
_ steel. The carbon steel pump, which used bismuth check valves, was in
‘good condition at the completion of the experiments (i.e., after being
operated to circulate a total of 702 liters of Llcl)

in salt in a mechanically agitated system, and to evaluate a vapor-.

dep031ted tungsten coating as a means for protecting carbon steel from

,corr051on by molten salt and bismuth

Several shaft seals were tested for varlous time periods at aglta—

tor speeds ranging from 150 to 750 rpm. It was found that the seal life

. could be 1ncreased_and-that the 'seal leakage rate was decreased con51d—

erably by lubricating'the'seal with mineral oil., A seal des1gn which .
allowed satisfactory operation for T1 days was Judged to be acceptable

for use 1n experlment MTE—3

Unfiltered salt samples taken during a ThS-hr period in which salt

and blsmuth were mechanically ag1tated showed that the concentration of

blsmuth in the salt 1ncreased from 8 ppm to 200 ppm as the agitator

—speed was 1ncreased from 150 rpm to 750 rpm, During this perlod the
;concentration of nickel in the bismuth 1ncreased from 20 ppm to 1000

wppm which indicated that the bismuth had penetrated the tungsten coating

on the interior of the. test vessel. Inspection of the coating after

- completion of the test revealed cracks 1n the coating 1n a number of
7"places; Also, 1t appeared that the coating had not been applied over
~the entire surface of the drain 11ne at the base of the test vessel It

. was concluded that protection of a vessel from attack by bismuth via a

tungsten coating would be’ dlfficult because of the tendency for such a

- coating to crack

' DISTRIBUTION OF RADIUM BETWEEN L101 AND L1~B1 SOLUTIONS

Data on the distribution of radium.between molten LiCl and Li-Bi

solutions contalning 13 to 35 mole % lithium were obtalned prev1ous1y

'Tm»during metal transfer experiment MTE—2 Addltlonal data were obtalned
Iby dilutlng a portion of the Li-Bi solution from the experiment (con-

.e.taining radium) and equillbrating the resulting solutlon w1th 1icl at
s650° All of the radium distribution data could be. correlated well in

;the manner used preV1ously for correlating distributlon data for a large |

number of elements 1f radium was assumed to be divalent 1n the LlCl

phase.’ It was found that the distribution characterlstics for radium

 
 

viii

are'quite similar to those of the divalent-rare-eafthiand-alkaline--
earth fission products (Sm, Eu “Sr, and Ba), in fact the data for
radium and barlum are almost identical. '
 DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY AGITATED SALT-METAL CONTACTORS
Efforts involving the»development:of mechanically agitated salt- |
metal eontactors'oflthe Lewis cell type‘wefe eontinned.a Préliminany
“tests were carried out in contattdrs'of,several sizes and with differ-
V:entdagitator configuratiens in order to determine the factors that will
- limit the sgitator speedin'stirred—interface'contactors.'-The agitator
speed,was fonnd_to be iimited by ﬁhe.transfer of the 1ow—density (water)
phase via entrainment in the cifculating highfdensity-(mercury) phase.
‘The limiting-agitater speed was essentially independent'of theisize and
shape of the contactor but was strongly dependent on the agitator diam-
eter, A test made with a low-meltlng alloy and water, which resulted 1n
& density difference of T.l rather than 12.6, indicated that the limiting
agitator speed is not highly dependenﬁ on_the-difference in densities
of the two liquid pheses. It is believed that entrainment of salt in .
the bismuth.in metal transfer experlment MIE-3 will occur at essentlally
the same agltator speed as was observed w1th the mercury—water system
(300 rpm), and that the experiment should be operated 1n1t1ally with

agltator speeds well below this value.

| Two tests were carried out for determining the rate at which blsmuth
circulates between the two sides of a compartmented salt-metal contactor
contalnlng a captive blsmuth phase._ These tests, in whleh mercury and
'water were used rather than bismuth and saltg'indieated mércurj»flGW'
rates of 11.2 and 19. 3liters/minfbr agitaters (speed 195-rpn in each,
case) hav1ng straight and canted blades respectlvely. it was'coneluded |
that. the bismuth circulation rate in metal transfer experlment MTE—3
will be adequaterand much greater then the mlnlmum_de51redsvalue of 0.5

ANALYSIS OF MULTICOMPONENT MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN
'MOLTEN SALTS AND LIQUID BISMUTH DURING COUNTER-
CURRENT FLOW - IN PACKED ‘COLUMNS '

The transfer. of materlalsrbetween a molten salt”and liquid bismuth

_results in a conditxon where the fluxes of the transferrlng 1ons are

dependent on both concentratlon gradlents and electrlcal potentlal gradl—
ents. ThlS greatly compllcates the mass transfer process and makes the

design of cont1nuous reductlve extractlon columns dlfflcult. Calculatlons :

were completed for both blnary and multlcomponent mass transfer in order

to determine the condltlons under which the presence of an electrlc

potentlal grad1ent 31gn1f1cantly alters the mass transfer rate, Con-

:'dltlons whlch typify molten—salt--bismuth and aqueous—organlc systems

were examlned

The effect of the electrlc potentlal grad1ent was found to be of

,greater importance when the electrolyte is a molten salt than when it is

"an-aqueous solutlon. In the latter case, the nontransferrlng coions

redlstrlbute in the electrolyte phase 1n a manner which suppresses the

| effect of the electrlc potentlal gradlent., However, it was shown that

| 51gn1f1cant errors in calculated mass transfer rate values will result

under some operatlng condltlons in both cases.

in order to study the klnetics of uranlum oxide precipitation, to investi-

gate the 51ze dlstrlbution and settllng characterlstlcs of oxide precip-

The experimental facility will allow for batch precipitation studies
to be made in a b-in.-diam vessel coﬁtaining'approximately'2 liters of

72—16—12 mole % LiF-Bng-ThFh salt that also containseUFu at an initial

‘concentratlon of about 0.3 mole %. Oxide will be supplied to the pre-

cipitator in the form of a water-argon gas mlxture that will be 1ntroduced

through a l-in.-diam draft tube to ‘promote contact of the salt and oxide.

~ The salt will be decanted to a receiver vessel after allowing the oxide

to settle for a short time, The facility elso includes & system for

supplylng hydrogen—HF gas mixtures that will be used for convertlng oxides
to fluorldes at the conclusion of an experlment.' The off-gas system
1ncludes eaustlc scrubbers for - ‘removing HF from the preclpltator off-gas |

' STUDY OF THE PURIFICATION OF SALT BY CONTINUOUS METHODS |

tion of iron fluoride by countercurrent contact of the salt,(72.0-lh.h~ _
13.6 mole % LiF-Ber-ThFh) with hydrogen‘in & packcd column. Tests carried

out to investigate the possibility that iron particleslin the molten salt

might be the cause of occa31ona1 high iron analyses showed that iron
particles are not present. Sampllng tests w1th varlous sampler designs
showed that iron particles, if present, do not remalnsln the salt durlng

one pass through the experimental system; that iron analyses bélow 100

ppm sre'uhreliable with sample sizes of 1 g or less; end that salt samples

taken in nickel samplers are more subject to iron contamination during

 removal than samples taken in copper sammlers;!_ccmpariscn of flooding data

taken during the countercurrent flow of molten salt and argon indicate

. that floodlng occurs at throughput values below those predlcted by the

2. FROZEN-WALL FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS ON INDUCTION -
HEATING IN A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR SIMULATION

J. R. Hightower, Jr,

- An experlment to demonstrate the usefulness or l&yers of frozen salt
for protection agalnst corr051on in a continuous fluorlnator requires an
internel heat source that is not subject to corrosion by_the molten salt.
High—frequency inductionrheeting has been propOsed'for this purpose, and
the estlmated perf‘ormancel of a frozen~wall fluorlnator hav1ng an 1nduc-‘
' tion coil embedded in the frozen salt near the fluorlnator wall has 1nd1—
_cated that such a method may be acceptable,- However, there are uncer-
~ tainties associated with the effect of bubbles in thermolten salt and
_ with the amount.of heat that will be generated in the metal walls of the
fluorinator. Equipment ha.s.b_een,installed=2 for studying. heat generation'
in a simulated frozen-wall.flnorinaiortconteining'provisions for induc-
tion heating.. In the simulation a 31 wt. % HNO3 solution,'whieh nas
electrical properties similar to those of molten salts, is being used as
a substitute for molten salt in e fluorinator vessel.-'We have previously
_reported_3 results for the first eight experiments with the earlier indnc—
tion heating coil design."During fhis report period, experimentel work
'on:induction heating in the fluorinator simulation was completed. Twenty-
one additional runs were carried out in order to test three other induc-~
tion coil designs. Relations were derived for predicting the rates of
heet generation in the molten salt, the induction coil, andethe pipe}wall

in a fluorinator having frozen-well corrosion protection,

2.1 Modification of Power Genération and Transmission Systems

The eleCtrical diagram showing the rf power generation end trans-
mission. systems for the induction heating experlment is shown in Fig. 1.
The. generator, & Thermonlc Model 1400. oseillator, is rated at 25 kW,
operates. at a nominal frequency of 400 kHz, and develops a terminal
~_voltage of about 13,000 V (rms). :The terminals of the generator are-

- connected to the primery side of an.oil-filled. rf- step-down transformer,

this arrangement reduces the voltage to approximately one-s1xth that

of the input5inxorder to not exceed the voltage ratings of. the coaxial
 transmission cables, .The.coaxial,cdblés (Model T~20-D and Model T-10-D
made bylL; C. Miller Company) are connected in series and allow trans-
mission of power to a point about 30 £t from the generator. 7During'the
current report period, the 10~ft segment (Model T-~10-D) of the cable
was replaced with a S-ft-long coaxial conductor, This conductor was
madéAof 3/8—1n;ediam copper tubing enclosgd'within 1/2-in.~dism poly-
ethylene tubing, ﬁhich'wgs, in turn, placed inside 3/h-in.-diam copper
tubing. The new section of the transmission line operated satisfac~
torily. | | o |
In order to obtain & high current through the induétion‘cbilland to

. -minimize.the current in the coaxial{cable,;additional'1nductances and

:capacitanCes,were incorporatedintb:the.ci;guit.with'the induction coil
-to'fbrm7a parallel RLC resonant cirCuit.é”Two.capaCitors (General
Electric, Cat. NQ;_19F23h),-each:having a capacitance df 0.0105 uF, were
- used. These capacitors'were.fated_for a8 meximum current of 196 A at 5h0
kHz -and & maximum voiﬁage of_SSOO V.. For the induction heating,coils
tested, it was possible.to'aéhieve‘conditions néar resonance by%Substi-
tuting coils of different sizes,for'the,resonance and coarse-tuning .
-coils. (see Fig. 1). Resonance was then approaéhed more closely by
adjusting the slide-bar on the fine=tuning loop. It was not possible
to obtain precisely resonant conditions because the operating frequency
of the generator was affected by each tuning adjustment, waever, with
theJcircuit adjusted as close to resonance as possible, we were able‘to

coil design is apparently the result of having all of the small coil
rsectlons wound in the same dlrectlon since the remalnlng characterlstlcs
 'of the coil are similar to those for the other coils, Coil IT would

| require tﬁe largest current in order to produce a given heat generation
rate in molten salt; however, it might have a high efflclency for
A'heatlng the salt if the diameter of the molten reglon were suff1c1ently

large

The value of k, for coil I was smaller than that for coil III,
-although the two coils have essentially the same design and comparable
values were observed for the other‘constants; This varietion in ko
values is probably due to changes in experimental technique and operating
¢onditions incorporated after tests with coil I were carried out, The
new technique conS1sted in using alcohol-in-glass thermometers to measure
the acid temperatures, since the temperatures indicated by thermocouples'
used in the runs with coil I were affected to some extent by the rf power
generation. Also, the coil designs tested after. coil I resulted in
higher heat generation rates in the acid which, in turn, led to smaller

relative errors in the measured heat generation rates in the acid,

The difference between the k  value for coil IV and the k, values
for coils I and II is probably due, in large part, to the different
spacing of the small coil sections. Coil IV had h—ln.-long small coil
sections, with 11. T turns in each section (see Table 1), and the sec-

tlons were separated by a space of 2 in. in which turns were not present.

We have continued operation of a.facility in which aemicontinuous
reductive extraction experiments can be carried.out_in a'mildeSteel sys-

on studles of the countercurrent flow of mercury and aqueous solutlons
in backed columns. We have carrled out - several experlments for deter-
_lenlng the mass transfér perfbrmance of the packed column in whlch 8
-salt stream contalnlng UFh was countercurrently contacted zlth blsmuth
containing reductant over a range of operat1ng condltlons. T It was
found that the rate of uranium transfer to the bismuth was controlled
by the diffusive resistance in the salt film under'conditions.sueh that
the,concentration'of reductant_in the bisﬁuth remained higﬁ,throughOut
the column. The extraction dataicould be correlated in terms Of:the‘-
height of an overall transfer unit based on the salt phase. In order
to measure mass transfer rates under more closely controlled conditions
where the controllingiresistance is not in the salt phase, preparations.
were begun for experiments in which the rate of exchange of zirconium |
isotopes will,be.ﬁeasured'between salt and bismuth phases otherwise,at
chemical equilibrinm. Difficulty was encountered at the beginningaof
the first run of thls type because of a salt leak in the V1c1n1ty of the

After 1ts 1nstallat10n the new salt feed—and—catch tank was stress

' relieved by the same technique used for the original feed-and—catch '

was maintalned at less than 60°C/hr. The bismuth feed-and-catch tank,

,_which had been allowed to cool -during the time required to fabricate and

install the new salt tank was heated to the operating temperature (550°C)

at the samelcontrolled rate._ ‘Both the salt and bismuth feed-and-catch

o faces of the system.

: 3 2 Preparation:for Mass-Transfer'Experiment ZTR—l

After the system had been treated with' hydrogen for removal of most -

.,of the 1ron ox1de, 1t was necessary to (l) add reductant to the bismuth
: h-'phase, (2) 1ncrease the salt 1nventory in the system to ‘about 20 liters,
"'.; and (3) c1rculate the salt and bismuth phases through ‘the system in
'torder to remove 1mpur1t1es that might have been 1ntroduced during the
"maintenance operations.- It was also necessary to 1ncrease the zirconium
| glnventory in the system, to remove 1mpurities from the salt phase by
"lhhydrofluorination, and finalky, to add 8 suff1c1ent amount of reductant
- to the bismuth phase to produce 8 zirconlum distribution ratio of ‘about

| 1; These operatlons are discussed in the remainder of this section.

A 103—g quantity of thorium was suspended in the bismuth phase in
T s

'the treatment vessel in & perforated contalner as described earlier in

 
 

 

o

order to increase the reductant concentratlon in the blsmuth to about

- 0.002 equiv per g-mole of blsmuth During d;ssolutlon of the thorlum,
the treatment vessel was held at 650°C, and argon was fed to the draft
tube in the vessel at ‘the rate of 2.5 std ft3/hr Only S gdof thorium

| remalned undlssolved after a period of U1 hr; analyses of blsmuth sam-
ples for uranium and thorium showed that sbout 80% of the thorium had
dissolved during the first 2k hr. About 18 liters of salt (72—16-12'
mole % L1F-BeF -ThFh) was. then charged to the treatment vessel in order
to replace salt that had been discarded when the original salt feed—
'and—catch tank was replaced.. The salt and blsmuth phases‘uererequlll—
,brated'in the‘treatment vessel for about 20 hr before:they vere trans-
ferred to their respective feed tanks. Bismuth;andVSaltiwere'then

f circulated through the system in order to complete theuremOVal of oxides
'that had'not been removed from the internallsurfaceshof'the system after
the previous treatment with hydrogen. In addltlon, column pressure drop
measurements were made durlng a period when only salt was flow1ng through
the column The observed pressure drop was about 2 1n. H 0 at the salt

- flow rate of T0 ml/min, which is in agreement wlth data obtalned soon
after the column was installed. It was concluded that the flow charac-

teristics.of the colum hed not chenged during runs made to date.

The zirconium mass transfer experiments require that a significant
quantity of zirconium be present in the salt and bismuth phases to ensure
that only a negligible change will ocecur in the zireconium dlstrlbutlon

ratio durlng the transfer of ° 'Zr tracer from the salt to the bismuth
phase. A 5.2-g quantlty.of Zircaloy-2 was dissolved in the bismuth to.

increase the zirconium inventory of'the system to about 15 g.

| The salt and bismuth were then contacted in the treatment vessel

- with a 30% HF--hydrogen stream hav1ng a flow rate of about 16 std ft3/
hr at 650°C in order to remove oxide (from the salt) that mlght have

‘ accumulated during the prev1ous transfer of the salt and bismuth through
the facility. Treatment of the salt and bismuth Wlth the HF—H2 stream

" was 1nterrupted after,about 2 hr by a restriction caused,by'deposition‘
of material on the Sintered-Monel_filter in the off—gas_stream from the

at about 3 std ft /hr for. a 20—hr period in order to remove HF from the

salt. The blsmuth and salt. were subsequently sampled, and a perforated

verlfy that most of the tracer had entered the salt phase the steel

~ addition capsule was counted for “'Zr activ1ty.- The counting results
for the bulk salt and for the capsule showed that greater than 99% of

the tracer had been transferred to the salt phase.

o the 2w

i transfer.of 91

Zr act1V1t1es in the samples showed that no measurable
Zr tracer from the salt to the bismuth phase had_occurred;
during the experiment. It was later foﬁnd’that-the lack of transfer was
due to an unexpectedly low distribution coefficient for zirconium, which
resulted in essentially no zirconiumdbeing present in the bismuth phase.
»Wet-chemical analyses of post-run, equilibrated.sampleS‘fOr lithium and
uranium'implied a zirconium distribution coefficient Value of about
0.001. A more precise value (o. 023) was obtained by countlng the samples'
97 9TZr activity. It was concluded that essentlally all of the )
reductant that had been added to. the system had been consumed by one or
more side reactions, for exemple, the reductlon.of FeF2 1nithe salt
phase to metallic.iron, or the reaction of reductant with HF that was _
desorbed from the graphite crucible.’ It'is‘alsozpossible:that a fraction
of the 1lithium in the Li-Bi alloy reacted with air or water.vapor during

Data'on the variation of inventories of reductant, uranium, and

| zirconiUm’dnring this report period are summarized in Table 4. At the

 beginning of the period, the treatment vessel contained_IT.T liters of

bismuth and 1:4 liters of salt__(72-16-12~molé % LiF-BeF ~ThF) ). After
a 118-day period in which the salt and bismuth were held in the treat-
ment vessel, the reductanttinventory’in-the bismuth‘had'decreased from
0.80 g—eduiv to 0.058 g—eqniv; ,Thejaverage rate of decrease in redué-
tant concentration during,this period_this period was 0,26'meq/hr.. The
addition of 1. 69‘g4equivrof'thorium;metal to the bismuth phase resulted

in approx1mately the expected change in the reductant concentration in -

the blsmuth based on uranlum and zirconium analyses. FolloW1ng the

addition of salt to the system to 1ncrease the salt volume to about

21 5 liters, samples taken from the treatment vessel showed that the

"~ reductant 1nventory had decreased sllghtly to 1. 33 g-equiv; 8 decrease
‘was expected because of the probablllty of 1ntroduc1ng small amounts
.uof oxxdants during the addltion of salt to the system.: Subsequently,

3.5 . Operation of the'Argon‘Purification'System

The argon purlfication'syStem, described earliér,hwasmddified by

~ the addition of a parallel purlflcatlon system (Englehard Deoxo Puri-

flers, Models D and C. 1n serles) The purpose of this modification was
to evaluate the effectlveness of Englehard un1ts relative to that of
the regular purlflcatlon traln, whlch cons1sts of a bed of molecular

sieves followed by & bed of uranlum turnings at 650°C

The Delph1 trace oxygen analyzer indicated'an oxygen concentration

s_of 3.6 ppm 1n the argon stream leaving the Deoxo unlts, as compared
j~w1th a value of 1.6 ppm measured in the argon stream leav1ng the regular
ﬂr_prpurlflcatlon traln. The comparison was not completely conclu51ve how-
. ever, because of the poss1b111ty of sllght air 1nleakage and the pOSSl—-
Jblllty of catalyst p01soning 1n the Deoxo unlts The Delph1 analyzer

had also shown symptoms 1nd1cative of 31lver cathode p01son1ng, although

it had been restored to serv1ce by heatlng the cathode grlds to 800°C

;fln a1r to remove suspected surface contaminatlon. Recurrlng fallure of

argon stream to about 0.2 ppm in the outlet stream

at asbout the expected rate. Surprisingly, however, the lanthanum and

‘neodymium removed from the fluoride salt did not accumulate in the Li-Bi

the external oxldatlon that had occurred did not cause dlfflculty with

the experlment.

To'facilitate inspection of its interior, the vessel was cut in
such a manner that the lower 11 in. on each 51de of the partition could
be removed to expose the salt and metal phases. A view of the fluorlde
compartment 1s shown in Fig. 6. The fluorlde salt and Th-Bl phases
appeared. to be clean and free from any accumulatlon of materlal at the |
-salt—metal interface; ‘hovever, the vapor region of the fluorlde compart-
ment was covered with a black powder having the comp051t10n (by weight).

of: 2.4% Li, 2.2% Be, 70.2% Bi, 1.1% Th, 0.02% Fe, and 19.9% F. The
'h dep031t was greatest (about 1/8 in. thlck) in the cooler‘portlons of
the compartment near the upper flange. Some of the powder had also
dlscolored the surfaces of the salt that had contacted the vessel wall
The black powder is thought to be a mlxture of salt and metalllc bis-

| muth that had‘been entralned 1nto the gas space by the argon sparge.

A v1ew of the LiCl compartment (W1th some of the LlCl removed) and
the Li-Bi container is shown in Flg. T. The vapor region in the LlCl
compartment was covered W1th a white powder consisting of L101 contalnlng
0.6 wt % Bl. This material is belleved to have resulted from vaporiza-
tion and from entrainment of LlCl and smaller amounts of bismuth in the
‘argon stream fed to the gas spargers. The LlCl and'Th-Bl phasesrappeared
to be c1ean, with no accumulation of impurities at the salt-metal inter-
face as had been seen in metal transfer ekperiment MTE—l.el o

There,were only two areas in the system where'deposits'containing'
unusually high concentrations of rare earths were found. A l/8-in.-
“thick 1ayer‘of gray material (shown in Fig.,8) had deposited on the lip

inventory in the-System. -The mechanism by which the material was depo— ]
sited on the rim of the lithium-bismuth cup has not been determlned

that the hole'had_dereloped sfter about two months of operation; how-

experiment., The‘lower.portions of the.carbon'steel sperge tubes and
~ thermowells that were in contact with the salt and bismuth phases during
the experiment are shown in Fig; 9. The sparge tubes in.both the fluo-

due to a thermsl gradient 1n the bismuth phase.. Iron has a solubility
of about 80 ppm in bismuth at 650°C 14 and thermel gradients in the |

5. DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
AGITATOR TESTS FOR EXPERIMENT MTE-3

E. L. Youngblood ~ W. F. Schaffer, Jr.

, Mechan1ca1 agitators will be used to promote contact of the salt
and metal phases in metal transfer experlment MTE-3, whlch is currently
belng designed and.constructed,15 The shaft seals for.the agitators must

'be capable of operating in a dry argon atmosphere and mustrhave a low
' leakage rate in order to prevent-eir and moistureufrom entering the exper-

‘iment. Equipment has been constructed in order to testlthe'shsft sedl .

. design that‘iS'proposed for_use in metal transfer experiment MIE-3. .The'j

--system will also sllow us to measure the_extent'to which bismuthris
‘entrained in salt in c mechanically'agitated'system and tofevaluate a
'vapor-dep051ted tungsten coatlng as. a means for protecting carbon steel

from corrosion by molten salt and blsmuth.

5.1 Description of Equipment

" Figure 11 shows the test equipment before'inStallation_of the elec-
 trical heaters and thermal insulation. The agitator drive assembly (shown
in Fig. 12):consistedvof a 1-1/4-in.-diam steinless steel shaft held in
position by two ball bearings that were separated by a distance of-ﬁ in.
After passing through ‘the ball bearlngs, the shaft dlameter was reduced
t0 1 in.; the shaft passed through two Bal—Seals (product of Bal-Seal
Englneering Co.) before enterlng the test vessel. The seals were con-
structed of graphlte—lmpregnated Teflon and were spring-loaded in order
to hold the seallng surface agalnst the shaft. The portlon of the shaft
.'that was in contact with the seals was plated with chromium and polished
to_a 10- to 12—u1n. surface that would produce satisfactory seallng.

The region'between the two seals was pressurized'with-argonpin order to
reduce the rate of air 1n1eakage past the seals. A hwin;-long cooling
_water jacket was 1ocated below the shaft seal as a means of protectlng
the seals from damage by heat from the lower portion of the system (which
operates at 650°C). A thermowell was prov1ded for measurlng the temper-

‘ature in the v1c1n1ty of the seals.

The agltator used for the test, shown 1n Fig. 13, was machined from
a single bar of molybdenum. The agltator shaft was 12 31 in. long and

had a diameter of 0.5 in., Separate blade assemblles were located in the

‘salt and bismuth phases. Each assembly had a diameter of l 12 in. and

a height of 0.5 in.; each blade was 0.13 in. thlck.\ The upper end of
the agitator was threaded to facilitate'its attachment to the drlve unit.

The vessel used to conta1n the salt and blsmuth for the agitator
test was constructed of 3-in. sched 80 carbon steel pipe (ASTM A 106
Grade B). A standard-plpe cap was used for therbottom_of the vessel.
The overall length of_the'veSSel was,20.8;in. jFourvbaffles‘(3 in. long,
1/2 in. wide) were'welded'totthe inside of the'vessel_begihning at a
p01nt 2-1/h in. above the bottom of the vessel. A.l/h-in.-sched 40 pipe

was attached to the 51de of the vessel to allow sampllng of the salt and

‘bismuth phases, and a l/h-in. pipe was attached to the bottom to allow

the salt and blsmuth to draln from the vessel. The lower 10 in. of the

,vessel interior was . coated with tungsten in order to evaluate the effec—

tiveness of thls type of coating for reduc1ng corrosion in systems con-

C ta1n1ng blsmuth.

In applylng the tungsten coatlng, the 1n31de of the vessel was first

- plated with nickel (approxlmately 1 mil thlck) by electrodep031tlon. The
‘nickel layer was bonded to the vessel by malntalning the vessel in vacuum
at 800°¢c for-h hr. Heaters ‘were then installed on’ the vessel, and the
.tungsten coatlng was vapor dep031ted from a H -WF6 m1xture.16 The temper-
“ature of the vessel varied from about 400 to 650°C along its length

durlng the coatlng operation, consequently,'the coatlng thlckness varled

| rt:‘from 0. 00h to° 0. 020 in., w1th the thickest depos1t belng located near
a'tthe bottom of the vessel.- Flgure 1h shows & view of the 1nter10r of the
ﬂ:vessel after the coatlng had been applled. Examinatlon of the coating

_w1th 8 borescope revealed no obv1ous s1gns of cracklng or: bllsterlng.

The exterlor of the carbon steel vessel was spray coated wlth 8 20-

to the drive unit.

5 2 Experlmental Results

The shaft seals used in the first test were Bal-Seal No. RBOhA-
(SZ)G120 The agitator was anltlally operated ‘at 200 rpm-for 100 hr with .
no salt or bismuth in the system. During the first 50-hr period the
vessel was held at room temperature durlng the remalnlng 50 hr, temper-
atures for the vessel and the seal vere malntained ‘at 650°C. and about
_:'50°C respectlvely. Throughout the test the seal leakage rate was deter- o
mined by pressurlzlng the region between the two seals with argon and |
- measurlng the rate of decrease in pressure when the argon supply was shut
.off.. The seal leakage rate durlng the first 100 hr, as measured at 1
atm and ambient temperature, was about 3 cm3/hr. The internal pressure

in the reglon between the seals was 15 to 20 p51g inltlally. - ' o - -

After the 1n1t1al testlng of the seal 35h9 g of purlfled bismuth
and 915 g of fluoride salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeFeuThFh to which 0.3

" mole % LaF ‘had been added) were charged to the system. The salt-bismuth

‘interfacezas located at a point about 1 in. above the lower agitator
blades, and’the‘Salt—gas interface was 1ocated'about 1 in.‘aboue:thei
~upper agitator blades. During the f011owihg»one-month period-'the'agi—
‘tator speed was 1ncreased stepwise from 150 to 750 rpm; the salt ‘and

3

of oil between

hconflrmed that the use of oil 1s effectlve in reduclng the seal leakage

After Tl days of operation the seals were-remoVed for inspection.
'Although both seals showed some wear, a sufficient wall thickness remained
to allow a eonsiderably longer operatihg time,' BasedLOn'these'test'
‘results, 1t .was determlned that this type of seal is acceptable for use

in metal transfer experlment MTE-3.

At intervals throughout the period during‘which salt and bismuth
were present in the system, unfiltered‘samples-of the salt'phase were
_ taken to determine the extent of bismuth entrainment in.the selt. Also,
unfiltered bismuth samples were takeh'for‘nickel_and iron analyses in
Aorder to determine'whether the’tUngsten coating was intact. Daring the
test the bismuth content of the salt increased from 8 ppm- to 101 ppm
as shown in Table 6; however, there was no 1ndicat10n that 1arge quan-
'tltles of blsmuth were belng entralned in- the salt. The purlfled blsmuth-
charged to the experlment contained 10 ppm of ireon and less than 20 ppm
of nickel. During the test the‘concehtration of‘nickel,in the hismuth
- increased to about 1000 ppm (shown in Table 6), which indicated that
the bismuth had penetrated the tungsten eoating. Thercohcentration of
~iron ia the bismuth phase increased: from 20 ppm to 50 ppm {the approx-
inate solubility of iron in bismuth at 650°C during the test. The tungsten.
and molybdenum concentratlons in the blsmuth remalned below 20 ppm and o

10 ppm, respectlvely, throughout the test.~

After completion.of the agitastor test, the eqnipment'was disassembled
for inspection (see Fig. 15). During operation; the vessel and agitator'
--had been maintained at 500 to 650°C for a perlod of 1150 hr, and salt and
‘blsmuth had been present in the system for 1005 hr. Vlsual examlnatlon
revealed no evidence of corros1on. " The portion-of the agltator submerged
in the’ blsmuth phase had been wet by the bismuth. Also,-droplets of salt

and-bismuth could be seen clinging to the agitator shaft at points above
| the salt surface;' The upper portions of the shaft and the drive unit
were covered W1th~a ‘black material that may have fbrmed as. the result

'several_placés, and ‘there was evidence,that°bismuth'had_penetrated

these cracks and had5attacked the nickel"suhstrate;' The cracks are

thought to be the result of thermal cycllng since the coefficients of
thermal expans1on of the tungsten coatlng and iron vessel are consid-

erably dlfferent- In samples taken from the 1/4-in. drain line at the

bottom of the vessel the tungsten coat1ng was not in contact ‘with the

metal substrate and the nickel layer was absent. The carbon steel was
also attacked to a depth. of about 2 mlls in that area. Although the

nlckel and tungsten coatlngs were falrly adherent 1n the 1/b-in. sample

- 1line attached to the side of the veéssel, numerous cracks were found in

thertungsten'cOating It was concluded from examlnatlon of the vessel
that complete protectlon of a vessel of this type from exposure to bls-
muth by tungstenccoatlng Wlll be difficult because of the ‘tendency of

such a coating'to»crack' However although cons1derable dissolution

of the nlckel coatlng had occurred attack on the carbon steel base

The nlckel aluminlde coatlng on the exterlor of the vessel appeared

distribution characteristics similar to those for dlvalent rare-earth
fission products (Sm end Eu) and alkaline-earth fission products (Sr and
Ba). Thus, it is of interest to obtain information concerning the behavior |

of radium in metal transfer systems.

7. DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY AGITATED SADT—METAL CONTACTORS

H 0. Weeren . L. E. McNeese

As reﬁorted previous}y,22 & program.hes been ihitiéted for the'develop-
ment of mechanically agitated salt-metal contactors as an alternative to
packed column contactors presently under considerationrfor'MSBR processing
systems. After brief experimentation-with several centactor types using
mercury and aqueous solutlons, it was dec1ded that the Lewis type contac-
tor 23 Qh has the greatest potential for achieving acceptable mass transfer
rates with minimum dispersion of the salt amd metal phases; This is an
1mportant factor since entralnment of bismuth in processed fuel salt that
‘1s returned to the reactor cannot be tolerated. The Lewis contactor has
two agltators ~— one. in the salt phase and one in the-bismuth phase — that
are located well away .from the salt-metal interfece. These agltators
~are operated in a manner such that the phases are miXed as vigorously as

possible without dlspers1ng one in the other.

A review of the 1iterature23 revealed the existence of considerable
data concernlng mass transfer coefficients in mqueous-organic. systems in
Lewis cell contactors having agitator dlameters of 2 to 4 in. and 1nd1cated
that the mass transfer coefficient is strengly.dependent on both the speed
‘and the diameter of.the agitator. However, before Lewis cell cOntacters
_ can be designed amd evaluated for salt-metal systems, it will be'necessary
to obtaln data for larger contactors, as well as hydrodynamlc and mass
transfer rate data for systems having phy31cal propertles that more closely
 resemble the salt-bismuth system. | |

During'this report period, data were obtained on (1) the maximum
agltator speed that can be used with a mercury-water system before entrain-
ment of'water in the mercury is dbserved, and (2) the rate of circulation
of mercury between the two compartments of a stirred-interface contactor
'of the typelbeing considered for the metal transfer process.15 Results

from these studies are summarized in the remainder of this section.

7.1 Studies for Determination of Limiting Agitator Speeds

Preliminary tests were carried out in contactors of several sizes

,and:With,different,agitator configurations'in order to determine the

factors that will limit the agitator speed in Stirred—interface contactors.

- The contactors used in these tests contained two compartments and were

of the typefshown'Schematicaliycin Fig. 18. Aqueous solutions and mercury
or a low-melting alloy were used to simulate molten salt and bismuth
during the studies. It was found that the common factor that limited

the agitator.speed.was the transfer of water between the two compartments

via entrainment in the circulating metal'phase.__For a given contactor

and agitator confignration this‘phenomenon was found to begin at a defi-
nite agitator speed below thls speed no entralnment was observed The
tests were carried out in compartmented cyllndrlcal contactors having
dlameters of 5 5 and 10 1n.,and in & compartmented rectangular contactor
measuring 12 X 2l in. In each caSe, the vessel contained no baffles and
a single fourAbladed paddle was used 1n the metal phase on one 51de of

the contactor.

The 11m1t1ng agltator speed was found to be essentlally 1ndependent
of the 51ze and shape of the contactor vessel but strongly dependent on

the dlameter of the agltator.- Data obtalned durlng these studies are

| summarlzed in Fig. 19, where 1t is seen that the allowable agltator speed

is 1nverse1y proportlonal to the 1. h3 Pcwer of the agltator diameter.

%5

Since the Lew1s correlatlon 1nd1cates that the mass transfer coeffie-

| c1ent 1s dependent on the agltator dlameter to the 3. 7 power, it appears

‘that at speeds sllghtly below the llmltlng agltator speed ‘the mess transfer

coeff1c1ent will be dependent on the agltator dlameter to the 0 ol power.

Thus, 1t should be advantageous to operate a contactor havzng the largest

'vpossible agltator dlameter.s_r"

It should.be noted that the datsa shown in Flg 19 are valid only for

- the operatlng'condltlons under'whlch they were obtalned. ‘The use of
fbaffles, canted agitator blades rather than straight blades, an agitator

"~ on each sxde of a contactor, or other changes in. the cell design could

make a con51derable dlfference in the llmlting agltator speed. The

following observations relative to this_poiﬁt were noted dﬁring the
studies: T | R | |

(1) The limiting agitator speed was relatively independent of
the,#ertical'position of fhe paddle in the mercury phase as
long as the paddle was-located well-below_the mércury;water

~ interface. However, when the paddlg was located near the

_interfaée;;the'limiting speed was decreased appréci&bly.

(2) The limiting agitator speed was apprecisbly ﬁighef ﬁhéﬁ the
. bismuth-phaSe in each compartment.of:the-conﬁactor was'agitated
than when the bismuth in only one compartment ﬁas'agiﬁatéd.
| For example, the difference-in limifing agitatérﬁspeeds for
a 3-in.-diam agitator blade was sbout 60 rpm. The limiting
agitator speed was esséntiallj waffected by the degree of
' agitatiéh of the,a@ueous'ﬁhase. | | |
(3) The size of the opening below the'pértitign that separated
the two contactor compartments could be increased‘ffom 0.25 in.
to 0.75 in.lﬁithout appfeCiablj affecting the limiting agitator
| épeed; On the other hand, the‘limiﬁing agitator speed was
reduced considersbly as the separation distance was increased

above 0.75 in.

(L) The use of baffles or the location of the agitator at an off-
center pésition increased the limiting agitatbr speed. This
éffect‘was more important with small-diameter agitﬁtors, whefe:
the variation in limiting agitator speed was about 30%, then
with large-diameter agitators, where the differenée was ohly
about 10%. -

- (5) When the agitator blades were canted_father than being vertical
and when the direction of rotation was such that the sgitator
lifted the mercury phase, a considerably higher agitator speed
could be axtained without entrainment of_water bétweenlthe two
compartments of the cbnﬁéétdr. TTherlimitihg7aéitatof speed
under these conditions was about;twice that shown in Fig. 19

In the flrst test the agltator con51sted of a four4bladed paddle

hav1ng vertlcal blades, in the second test the blades were canted at

h59 1n a manner such that the mercury was llfted toward the metal surface.

During each test, only one side of the contactor cell was agitated}' The
experimentalrtechnique'consisted of temporarily preventing'circulationu
of mercury between the two halves of the contactor, establlshlng a temper-
- ature dlfferentlal between the mercury pools in the two compartments, and
allowing resumption of the circulation of metal between the compartments.
The rate of change of_the‘temperature_bf.the-mercury‘in one compartment
was then measured in order to determine the rate of mercury flow between
“the compartments. 'Results of previous tests had shown that'the rate af"
conductlve ‘heat transfer across the contactor partltlon and the rate of
heat loss to the surroundlngs were negligible as compared with the rate
,of convective heat transfer resulting from c1rculat10n of the mercury phase

A mathematlcal analysis was carried out to aid in'interpretation of
‘ the experlmental measurements made for the purpose of determlnlng the )
'rate of flow of mercury between‘the two contactor compartments. In

'making the analysis,-the following assumptions were'made:'

8. ANALYSIS OF MULTICOMPONENT MASS TRANSFER BETWLEN
- MOLTEN SALTS AND LIQUID BISMUTH DURING
COUNTERCURRENT FLOW IN PACKED COLUMNS

¢. P. Tung * J. S. Watson

Reductive,extraction; an important operation in the removal of prot-

,actiniumVand-rare_earths from MSBR fuel salt, involves: the exChange of

metal ionsfin the salt phase with nentral (reduced) metal atoms in the -

bismuthfphaseg ‘Since no'netielectric current flows_between the salt -
and metal phases, the rate at which metal ions are reduced must equal
the ratetatVWhich metal atoms are oxidized (taking into consideration
differences‘in'the charges of the ions involved) In the bismuth phase,
the fluxes of the transferrlng atoms are dependent only on concentratlon
gradients. In the salt phase however, electrlc potentlal gradlents are
generated near the salt—metal interface as the result of differences in
the mobllltles and/or charges of .the wvarious d1ffus1ng ions. This
results 1n a condltlon where the fluxes of the transferr1ng jons are

dependent on’ both concentratlon gradlents and electrlc potentlal gradi-

ents. These effects greatly compllcate the mass transfer process and

make dlfflcult the de51gn of continuous (dlfferentlal) reductive extrac-

One liquid phase is considered to be &n electrolyte (molten salt or an
aqueous solutlon) whlle the other is con51dered to be a solvent (b1smuth
“or an organ1c phase) The behavior of- materlals 1n the solvent phase is
similar in the two cases in that the transferrlng components are assumed
to be present in an uncharged or neutral state. However, the behavior of

materials in the electrolyte phase differs for the two_cases. In repre-

‘senting a molten salt, it was assumed-that.the concentratiohfof;electro—

lyte coions (ions which have & charge opposite to that of the'transferring

ions) is-constant throughout the electrolyte phase since the equivalent
volumes bf-therfluorides or chlorides of interest are'essentially equal

'In represent1ng an aqueous phase, it was. assumed that the concentratlon -

8. 2 Calculated Mass Transfer Rates for the Case of Blnary
| Exchange w1th Uniform Bulk Concentratlons

The extent to which an electric potentlal gradlent alters the rates
at Whlch components transfer between electrolyte and solvent phases
. having uniform bulk concentrations depends upon (1) the valences of the
.transferrlng and nontransferrlng ions in the electrolyte phase, (2) the
dlffu51on coefflc1ents of the transferrlng components in the electrolyte'r
and solvent phases, (3) the resistance to transfer of components through .
the electrolyte and solvent films ad}acent to the electrolyte-solvent |
“interface, (4) the equilibrium constants for the transferring components,
(5) the relative concentrations of the transferring components in the

electrolyte and solvent phases, (6) the concentration of nontransferring

ions in the electrolyte phase, and (T) the behavior of the nontransferring

ions.

Because of the large number of variables inwolved, it is not possi-
" ble to portray in & simple manner the complete solution to the set of
-equatlons that defines the effect of the electr1c potentlal gradlent on
the rates at which components transfer between therelectrolyte and sol-
vent phases. Instead' results for selected cases'involviné two trans-
»ferrlng components will be given in order to show the 1mportance of ther
various factors.‘ In each case, the rate at whlch a component,transfers-
between a solvent and an agueous or molten salt phase 1n the presence of
_an eleectrice potentlal gradlent Wlll be compared to the rate at which the

component would transfer in the absence of an electrlc_potentlal gradient.

- In the remainder of this_chapter, the term»relative,flux value‘(RFV)'will:'

be used to denote the ratio of the‘flux of a transferring cOmponent-in

the presence of an electric potentlal gradlent to the flux in the absence.'

- of an electric potentlal gradient |

In all cases 1nvolV1ng blnary exchange w1th uniform bulk concentra- :
tions, the valences of the transferrlng and nontransferring ions were
Jassumed to be unity. The concentrations of components 1l and 2 in the
solvent phase were assumed to be 0.1 and 0. 05 g-mole/cm3, respectiveLy,
and the concentrations of . components 1 and 2 in the eleotrolyte phase

‘were assumed to be 0.05 and 0.01 g-mole/cm3.

8 2.1 Effect of Diffusion Coeff1c1ents of Transferring Ions in Electro-
' lyte Phase
The effect of the diffusion coefficients of the'transferring'ions
in the electrolyte phase during blnary exchange is shown in Fig. 20,
‘where the RFV (for either component) is given as a function of the ratio

~of the diffu51on coefflclent of component 1l in the electrolyte phase to

. the diffusion coefficlent of component 2 in the electrolyte phase. In

' obtaining these results, the equlllbrium constant was assumed to be
'unlty, and the thickness of the solvent film was assumed to be negligible
(negllglble re51stance to transfer in the solvent fllm) It should be
;noted that the RFV is affected by the relatlve values of the diffusion
 coefficients for the transferrlng spec1es except in the case where the
dlffus1on coeff1c1ents (as well as the valences) are equal The effect
of an electrlc potentlal gradient on the mass transfer rate is greater
[ in the case of a uniform concentration of coions 1n the electrolyte

~ phase (molten salt solution) than for the - -case of a nonunlform concen-

"'-_tratlon of c01ons in’ the electrolyte phase (aqueous solution) because

the mobile c01ons in the aqueous electrolyte dlstrlbute across the

y 1e1ectrolyte film 1n a manner'whlch suppresses or reduces the effect

f-rof the electric potential gradient. If the ratio of the dlffu51on :
gcoefflcient fbr component l to that of component 2 is 0 25, ‘neglect of

;-'the effect of an electric potential gradient would result in errors in

the calculated mass transfer rate of 23 and 507 for aqueous and molten\

salt electrolyte phases respectively

8.2.2 Effect of Ind1v1dual Mass Transfer Coefflclent in Electrolyte

_f Phase

The effect of the 1nd1v1dual ma.ss transfer coeff1c1ent in the elec—,
trolyte phase is shown 1n Fig. 21,where the RFV. (for either component) is

glven as a functlon of the ratio of the 1nd1v1dual mass transfer coeffi~-

cient for component l in the electrolyte phase to the 1nd1v1dual mass

rtransfer coeff1c1ent of component 2 in the electrolyte phase. The mass.

transfer coeff1c1ents for components 1 and 2 1n ‘the solvent phase were
assumed to be equal to the mass transfer coeff1c1ent of component 2 in
the electrolyte phase ' The equlllbrlum constant was assumed to be unity.

The error caused by neglect of the effect of an - electrlc potentlal gra-

,dlent is greater 1n the case of the molten salt electrolyte than in the
case of an aqueous electrolyte and becomes s1gn1f1cant for the case where
- the 1nd1v1dual mass transfer coefflclent for component 1l in the electro-

'lyte phase 1s small relatlve to the. other 1ndiv1dual mass transfer coef-

8 2. 3 Effect of Ind1v1dual Mass Transfer Coeff1c1ent 1n Solvent Phase

 

The effect of the 1nd1V1dual mass transfer coefficient 1n the sol—

vent phase is shown’ in Flg.,22 where the RFV (for either ‘component ) is

-given as a functlon of the. ratlo of the 1nd1v1dual mass transfer coef-
'f1c1ent for component 1 or 2 in the solvent phase (assumed to be equal)
e to the :|.nd1v1dual mass transfer coeffn.clent for component 2 in the
'?electrolyte phase. In obtalnlng these results, 1t was assumed that the
1flequ111br1um constant was unlty and that the ratio of the 1nd1v1dual mass’
fj_yﬂtransfer coeff1c1ent for component 1 1n the electrolyte phase to that

':for component 2 was equal to 5

decrease since the transfer‘rate.is no longer_controlled by the electro-

coefficient (left side ofrFig 22), the transfer rate is controlled by
the film resistance in the solvent and is not 51gn1flcantly affected by

electr1c fields.

8. 2. 4 Effect of Equilibrium Constant

 

The effect of the equ111br1um constant on the RFV is shown in Fig.

- 23, In obtaining these results, it was assumed that the individual mass
transfer coefficients in the solvent phase were . equal to the individual

| mass transfer coefficient for component 2 in the electrolyte phase. It
was also assumed>that the individual mass transfer coefficient.for com- h
ponent 2 in the electrolyte phase was five times that for.component 1. )
Changes in the equilibrium constant result in changes in the interfacial
concentrationS'in both phases. For very small values for the equilibrium
“constant, the equilibrium concentrations of the transferring species on
the solvent side of the interfacerbecome small relative to,the‘concen—
trationston the electrolyte side of the interface. 1In this case, the.
resistance to transfer between the phases is principally in the solvent
film;tﬂneelectric potential gradient has essentially'no‘effect,;as shown
in the left-hand portion of Fig. 23. For high values of the equilibrium

constant, the primary resistance to mass transfer is in the electrolyte

film and the effect of the electric potentiallgradient becomes important,,

cases correépond'to redﬁCtive extracﬁion involving the transfer of

16-12-0.3 mole % LiF-BeF -ThFh-UF ) and liquid bismuth containing reduc-

tant. Although only four cations (Li , Be” , U , and Thh ) are con-

sidered here, calculational methods and computer programs which‘have
the capability of considering up to ten cations have been developed.

- Two elements (Be and F), assumed to be present in the éalt phase as
Be? and F , do not transfer to the bismuth phase. In each of the
cases, the solvent phase (bismuth) that enters the column contains no?
uranium. In one case, the solvent contains lithium (1 mole %) but no
thofium; in the other, the solvent contains thorium (1 mole %) but no
lithium. The column length is such that the total interfacial area

between the molten salt and bismuth phases is 2000 bm3.

The calculated concentration prdfiles for the two cases are shown
in Figs. 28 and 29. In both cases, the salt and bismuth-phases were
-essentialiy in equilibrium with respeét to 1ithium and thoriﬁm'negr:the
bismuth inlet. There were no Significant differences between the results
obtained when the effect of an electric potential gradient ﬁas considered
and when it was neglected. This result is not surprising;~however, since
the low concentratibn of feductant (Li and'Th) in the solvent'phase dic-
tates that the mass transfer rates are controlled primarily by the resis-
tance to transfer in the solvent phase. Also, uranium is & minor compo-

nent in the electrolyte (molten salt) phase, and the coions act Asra

9. ENGINEERING STUDIES OF URANIUM OXIDE PRECIPITATION

M. J Bell* L. E. McNeese. :

-Studies‘Of the chemistry of protactinium and'uranium oxide pre-
cipitation by Baes et al. have indlcated that ox1de precipltatlon may
be an attractive alternatlve process to fluorlnatlon-—reductlve extrac-
: tion for isolatlon of protactinlum and removal of uranium from the fuel
salt of an MSBR‘26 et Calculations made by Bell and McNeese 1nd1cate
that protactlnlum removal tlmes of 3 to 5 days can be obtalned for a
reasonable range of flowsheet varlables, and that uranium removal effi-
ciencies of greater than 99% can be reallzed with relatlvely few equi-
~librium stages. 28,29 Englneerlng studles of uranlum oxide precipitation
are planned in order to- study the kinetics of uranium: oxide precipitation,
to 1nvestlgate the size distrlbutlon and settling characteristics of
the oxlde preclpltate, and to gain experlence with oxide precipitation
systems. During thls report period, an experimental facility was designed

and 1nstallat10n of equipment was inltlated The facility is described

‘1n the remalnder of thls section.

9.2 Precipltator Vessel De51gn

In order to obtain 1nformatlon applicable to the design of the

”prec1p1tator vessel the experlmental system was simulated u51ng sand

and water 1n1t1ally, and then iron powder and a glycerolewater solut1on,

in place-of oxlde_and salt, a1r was employed_as the sparge gas. A 1-

in.-diam draft tube was placedrin:a;h;in.—diam glass pipe, and the
~effects of the distance between the bOttom of the draft tube and the

bottom of the vessel, as well as the shape of the vessel bottom, on

the degree of mixing of the sollds vere determlned. It was observed

._that only the solids located 1mmed1ately beneath the draft tube were
'dfentralned in the circulatlng 11qu1d and that the system performed most
feffectlvely when the bottom of the draft tube was positioned w1th1n a
_'few mllllmeters of the bottom of the vessel. When the draft tube was
raised as llttle as. l/h 1n. from the bottom, m1xing performance became
'very poor It was also observed that, if the solids were allowed to
'settle around the bottom of the draft tube, dlfflculty was sometlmes

The preclpltator vessel that was de51gned as’ the result of these -

diam, T-ft-long column packed with 1/4-in. nickel Raschig rings.
Flooding data were obtained during the countereurrent flow of molten
salt (66-34 mole % LiF—BeFa) andrhydregen or argon.Bl The objective
of the present work is to study the continuous reduction of iron fluo-
ride in molten salt by countercurrent contact of the salt with hydrogen
in a packed column. We have previously reported on two iron fluoride

~ reduction runs that were carried out at 700°C with salt having the
composition 66-3h mole % LiF-BeF (ref. 32) and nine runs that were
carried out at T00°C with salt hav1ng the comp031tion 72 O—lh 4L-13.6
mole % L1F-BeF -ThFh 33

Tron analyses from samples'taken during the 1ast sefiés of nine
iron fluoride reduction runs have shown considér&blescatter_(Fig.'3é),_
Also shown in this figure are the eﬁalyses for ten samples takep.after
the last reduction run when the soluble iron (fluoride) concentration
‘should have remained constant. Suspected reesons for the inconsis-
tencies are: presence of iron particles suspended in the salt, con-
‘tamination of the sample during ahalysis, and analytical difficulties.
at_iow i:on eoncentretions{ Several tests were carried out during this
report period in order to resolve these questions; the_results and con-

clusions are discussed in the remeinderpoffthis chapter.

specimens of nickel were suspended in the salt in the feed tank at

| varying}depths for 5 to 15 min. Leaching these specimené with HC1
~dissolved a negligible amount Of iron. To further subStantiate the ;
absence of iron partlcles in the salt, four dip (unflltered) samples
were taken. The iron concentratlons in these samples ranged from 65
to 75 ppm, which is equivalent to the concentratlon in the filtered
samples having the lowest iron content. Such resultsxshow conclu51vely

 that iron particles are not suspended in the salt.

' 10.2 Tests of Various Sampler Types

_ The samplers used durlng the iron fluoride reduction runs carrled
out to date have consisted of l/h-ln.—OD nickel samplers to which a
porous metal- filter is attached. The sample size is about 1lg. Removal
of the salt sample from these samplers (via a steel tublng cutter fol— ‘
lowed by crushing) is somewhat difficult and prOV1des a possible source
of iron contamination. Therefore, following the last reductlon,run,
both filtered and nonfiitered'samples-were taken in cOppér:samplers,
some of which allow removal of a larger {k-g) sample. The éopper tubing
'is,more easily crushed, and samples are less likely to be cdntaminated-
with iron during this ‘operation. ,Ayeragés of the iron concentr#tions

for the samples taken after run 11 are shown in Table 12. .
