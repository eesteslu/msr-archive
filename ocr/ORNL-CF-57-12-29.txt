4. J. Murphy

The subject of your memorandum dated Hovember 13, 1957 has been
reviewved.,

We have recently been advised that molten salt work has been digs-
continued in the Alrcraft HNuclear Propulsion Program on the grounds
that it is not a suitable approach to the solution of the problem
of the ANP., In view of this, and because such information would
appear to be quite useful to the civilian powexr application program,
the work which was described in the attachments to your above
referenced memorandum may be carried out as unclassified research
within the terms of‘Sgﬁegory II of AEC Manual Chapter 3403,

 

 

The above authorization does not include, nor would it permit,
declassification of any aspects of reactor design relating
specifically to aircraft application. Great care should be
exercised to prevent the release of the fact that this work was
discarded from the ANP program as being an impractical, or an
unsuccessiul approach.

3403-06 Procedures and Authorizations

 

061 It is expected thatoff-site research sponsored by the AEC may
vary from the completely unclassified research, through research in fields
~which are classified but declassifiable, to fields which are classified and non-
declassifiable, The same range of possible classification will, of course,
exist within AEC-sponsored laboratories,

062 The following categories have been established as guides to proper
classifidation and security procedures for off-site as well as on-site projects,
In all cases determination of the proper category for,a given: project shall be
the responsibility of the cognizant Washington Division Director, Prior to
conducting research considered to be in Categories Il and III, the concurrence
of the Director of Classification shall be obtained through the cogmzant Di-
vision Director, .

" which in their early stages will not involve restricted: ta_.\ »u
which as the work progresses may approach restricted data,
Such research programs can be initiated on an unclassified basis,

However, when itbecomes apparentthat restricted data is being ap-
proached, it shall be the responsibility of the Security Monitor - *

or the Senior Investigator to assure that the proper security =

- safeguards (including necessary Q-clearances) are applied,

 

 

To discharge this responsibility properly, it is essential that the
Security Monitor or Senior Investigator keep himself continuously
informed of the progress of the work so that he can impose the
appropriate security safeguards promptly when it appears that |
restricted data may be developed. An example of a project that /
may be carried out under this category is that kind of research /
