Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor (MSR)
Program is the development of nuclear reactors that use
fluid fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile
materials in suitable carrier salts. The program is an
outgrowth of the effort begun over 20 years ago in the

Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) Program to make a-

molten-salt reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-
salt reactor, the Aircraft Reactor Experiment, was
operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954 as
part of the ANP Program.

The major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while
simultaneously conserving and extending the nation’s
fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233UF, dissolved in a mixture of LiF and BeF,, but
235U or plutonium could be used for startup. The
fertile material would be ThF, dissolved in the same
salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar composition.
The technology being developed for the breeder is also
applicable to high-performance converter reactors.

A major program activity through 1969 was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE). This reactor was built to test the types of fuels
and materials that would be used in thermal breeder
and converter reactors; it also provided operation and
maintenance experience. The MSRE operated at
1200°F and produced 7.3 MW of heat. The initial fuel
contained 0.9 mole % UF,, 5% ZrF,, 29% BeF,, and
65% "LiF; the uranium was about 33% 233U, The fuel
circulated through a reactor vessel and an external
pump and heat exchange system. Heat produced in the
reactor was transferred to a coolant salt, and the
coolant salt was pumped through a radiator to dissipate
the heat to the atmosphere. All this equipment was
constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybednum-iron-
chromium alloy. The reactor contained an assembly of
graphite moderator bars in direct contact with the fuel.

Design of the MSRE was started in 1960, fabrication
of equipment began in 1962, and the reactor became
critical on June 1, 1965. Opération at low power began
in January 1966, and sustained power operation was

begun in December 1966. One run continued for six
months, until stopped on schedule in March 1968.

Completion of this six-month run ended the first
phase of MSRE operation, in which the objective was to
show, on a small scale, the attractive features and
technical feasibility of these systems for commercial
power reactors. The conclusion was that this objective
had been achieved and that the MSRE had shown that

. molten-fluoride reactors can be operated at 1200°F

without corrosive attack on either the metal or graphite
parts of the system; also the fuel is stable; the reactor
equipment can operate satisfactorily at these condi-
tions; xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts;
and when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be
repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.
In six days of fluorination, 221 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded into absorbers

“filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decontamina-

vii

tion and recovery of the uranium were very good.

After the fuel was processed, a charge of 233U was
added to the original carrier salt, and in October 1968
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 233 U. The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with
the 233U were close to the predictions, and the reactor
was quite stable. In September 1969, small amounts of
PuF; were added to the fuel to obtain some experience
with plutonium in a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE was
shut down permanently December 12, 1969, so that the
funds supporting its operation could be used elsewhere
in the research and development program.

Because of limitations on the chemical-processing
methods available in the past, most of our work on
breeder reactors was aimed at two-fluid systems in
which graphite tubes would be used to separate
uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile
salts. However, in late 1967 a one-fluid breeder became
feasible with the development of processes that use
liquid bismuth to isolate protactinium-and remove rare
earths from a salt that also contains thorium. Our
studies showed that a one-fluid breeder based on these
processes can have fuel-utilization characteristics ap-
proaching those of our two-fluid design concepts.
‘Since the graphite serves only as moderator, the
one-fluid reactor is more nearly a scale-up of the
- MSRE. These advantages caused a change in the
emphasis of the program from the two-fluid to the
one-fluid breeder; most of the design and develop-
ment effort is now directed to the one-fluid system.

In the congressional authorization report on the
AEC’s programs for FY 1973, the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy recommended that the molten-salt
reactor be appraised so that a decision could be made
about its continuation and the level of funding appro-
priate for it. Consequently, a thorough review of
molten-salt technology was undertaken to provide
information for an appraisal. A significant result of the
review was the preparation of QORNL-4812, The Devel-
opment Status of Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors. A
subsequent decision was made by the AEC to terminate
work on molten-salt reactors for budgetary reasons; in
January 1973 ORNL was directed to conclude MSR
development work.

viii

In January 1974, the AEC program for molten-salt
reactor development was reinstated. A considerable
effort since that time has been concerned with assem-
bling a program staff, making operational a number of
development facilities used previously, and replacing a
number of key developmental facilities that had been
reassigned to other reactor programs. A significant
undertaking was the formulation of detailed plans for
the development of molten-salt breeder reactors and the
preparation of ORNL-5018, Program Plan for Develop-
ment of Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors. '

Most of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now
devoted to the technology needed for molten-salt
reactors. The program includes conceptual design
studies and work on materials, the chemistry of fuel
and coolant salts, fission-product behavior, processing
methods, and the development of systems and compo-
nents. The most important single aspect of the program
presently is the development and demonstration of an
alloy that is suitable for the primary circuit of an MSBR
and has adequate resistance to tellurium-induced shal-
low intergranular cracking, which was first observed in
MSRE surveillance specimens.
‘Summary

PART 1. MSBR DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT,
AND SAFETY

1. Design and Analysis

Calculations were made to evaluate the steady-state
distributions of tritium and the rate at which tritium
enters the steam system in the reference-design MSBR.
The calculations were based on current estimates of
material and system properties, and effects of changes
in these properties were examined. Potentially variable
system operating parameters were varied over wide
ranges to determine their importance in limiting the
rate at which tritium enters the steam system. In the

absence of tritium fluoride sorption on the core

graphite, the tritium release to the steam system could
be limited to 2 Ci/day or less only by purging the
secondary salt system with HF and assuming a reduc-
tion in the hydrogen (tritium) permeability of the

steam-generator tubes by a factor of 100. This approach

could be questionable if the HF (TF) present at low
concentrations in the salt reacts rapidly with metal
surfaces to release hydrogen for diffusion through the
metal. Considerable improvement could be achieved,
without HF purging, if a highly efficient external
gas-stripping system could be developed to replace the
planned stripping system, which results in circulating
gas bubbles. The most promising approach appears to
be the addition of a chemical getter to convert the
tritium to a nonreactive and readily removable form
within the secondary salt.

Flux mapping and monitoring experiments were
performed in conjunction with the capsule irradiation
program associated with the effort to develop an
improved alloy for the MSBR primary circuit. The
results were used to evaluate fission rates in the fueled
capsules and to calculate fission-product inventories.

Work is being done in the ORNL High-Temperature
Design Program to determine the applicability to
Hastelloy N of simplified design procedures and rules

ix

being developed for type 304 stainless steel and to
evaluate the severity of thermal-ratchetting and creep-
fatigue damage problems in the MSBR. This effort,
which is just beginning, will eventually be factored into
the work leading to submission of an ASME code case
for the structural material of the MSBR primary circuit.

2. Systems and Components Development

A conceptual design study of a steam generator to
operate in the ORNL 1000-MW(e) MSBR reference
design was completed by the Foster-Wheeler Corpora-
tion under subcontract to ORNL. The steam generator
design chosen by Foster-Wheeler was an L-shaped
tube-and-shell heat exchanger with an effective tube
length of 140 ft, which operates in a supercritical steam
cycle. Foster-Wheeler also completed a literature survey
of Hastelloy-to-steam corrosion.

The first phase of the water runs was completed in
the Gas-Systems Technology Facility. The resulting
data indicated that the pump performance will be
satisfactory during salt operation, although the motor
horsepower requirement will be higher than anticipated.
Simulated tests indicate that the densitometer that is to
be used for measuring the void fraction of the circula-
ting water or salt may not be capable of supplying
information necessary to adequately evaluate the
bubble-separator performance.

Operation of the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility

'was restarted with sodium fluoroborate, the secondary

coolant salt for the MSBR reference design. The revised
load-orifice arrangement eliminated the cavitation that
had occurred previously. After 240 hr of operation, the
loop was shut down due to plugging in the off-gas lines
and in the salt filter upstream of the cold trap. Plans are
being formulated and equipment assembled for the first
tritium trapping tests.

Forced-convection loop MSR-FCL-2b was operated
with LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (68-20-11.7-0.3 mole %) salt
until October 1974, when the loop had accumulated
4000 hr of isothermal operation. The salt was then
replaced with newly prepared MSBR reference-design
fuel salt {72-16-12-0.3 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,.).
At the end of this report period, the loop had
accumulated 800 hr of operation with the salt circula-
ting at design conditions with a temperature difference
of 250°F. During both isothermal and AT operation,
the condition of the surveillance specimens indicated
low corrosion rates, as expected.

Two additional forced-convection-loop facilities,
designated MSR-FCL-3 and MSR-FCL-4, have been
authorized and are in the early stages of construction.
They are being fabricated of 2% titanium modified
Hastelloy N,

3. Reactor Safety

Studies examined the safety significance and potential
causes of salt spills within the primary containment of
an MSBR. Such spills would not lead to failure of the
primary containment, and the secondary containment
would provide additional protection of the public
health and safety. No probable events or event
sequences (other than an arbitrarily postulated piping
failure as the primary event) were identified as potential
causes of salt spills. Cleanup and recovery from a
postulated salt spill would require some effort to limit
the safety significance of such activities. '

PART 2. CHEMISTRY
4. Fuel-Salt Chemistry

The deposition rate of tellurium on Hastelloy N
surfaces in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR was estimated. If each
atom of Te (stable and radioactive) that contacts a
Hastelloy N surface is assumed to react, a cumulative
exposure to the heat-exchanger surfaces equivalent to
about 52.1 mg/cm® would occur in 30 effective
full-power years. The concentration of tellurium present
after 30effective full-power years would be much lower:
9.11 mg/cm? of stable tellurium plus 0.012 mg/cm? of
‘radioactive isotopes of tellurium.

Apparatus for the exposure of tensile test specimens
to tellurium vapor was constructed and initial tests
completed. Hastelloy N specimens exhibited grain-
boundary cracking after 400 hr exposure.

Extended graphite capsule equilibrations were com-
pleted at 600°C with dilute UF3-UF, molten fluoride
solutions in contact with equal molar amounts of solid
UO, and UC,. Equilibrations were also conducted with
dilute CO-Ar gas mixtures, and the resulting UF;/UF,

ratios were measured spectrophotometrically. No oxy-
carbide phases were formed at 600°C, and no stabilized
oxygen activity was observed which could account for
the apparently lower equilibrium values obtained in
earlier work. )

A reexamination of the hydrogen reduction of ura-
nium tetrafluoride in molten fluoride melts has been
initiated. A system has been built and is now being
tested which will allow reversible equilibrium measure-
ments to be made spectrophotometrically at variable
HF/H, ratios. '

A prototype packed-bed electrode of glassy carbon
spheres was tested. Results of linear-sweep voltam-
metric measurements showed that the cell, the instru-
mentation, and the auxiliary systems functioned suc-
cessfully; also, these results demonstrated the inherent
sensitivity of this method of analysis.

5. Coolant-Salt Chemistry

The compounds H;OBF,, BF;+2H, 0, HBF,(OH),,
NaBF;O0H, Na,B;F¢0, and Na3;B3;F,0; have been
prepared and characterized. Ternary solubility diagrams
for the system H3;OBF,-HBO,-H,0 at 25° and 60°
were established experimentally to help in the interpre-
tation of analysis of condensates of volatile fractions
above the coolant melt. There are indications that a
compound with the empirical formula Na,B;F;0,
might be a stable oxygen-containing species in fluoro-
borate melts up to 550°C. Simple species such as B, 0
or BO, ™ are not stable and are converted to species
containing B—F bonds in molten fluoroborate.

Studies of chromium chemistry in molten NaBF,
showed CrF; to be more stable by 6.3 kcal/mole in
Na3CrFs than in NasCryF,,; this explains why
Na;CrFg rather than Nag Cr3F, 4 precipitates from the
NaBF,4-NaF coolant. Equilibration of Hastelloy N and
Inconel 600 with NaBF,-NaF eutectic for up to 72
days at 640°C caused minor increases in the surface
boron content. for Hastelloy N and significant increases
for Inconel 600. Evidence of reaction of CrF; with
nickel was obtained. Evaluation of the data for the
reaction NaF(c) + NiF,(c) = NaNiF;(c) showed that
the enthalpy change at 25°C was virtually zero.

6. Development and Evaluation of Analytical Methods

Voltammetric techniques are used to measure
U*/U? ratios and to observe corrosion-product ions in
MSBR fuel in all corrosion test loops that are in current
operation. Ratios are presented graphically for the
initial period of operation of forced-convection loop
FCL-2b. During this report period the redox condition
of uranium in an experimental fuel solvent, LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (68-20-12 mole %), was adjusted by additions of
beryllium metal and nickel fluoride. Effects of addi-
tions of reductant and oxidant are clearly distinguish-
able on the plots, and stoichiometric reduction by
beryllium of tetravalent uranium to the trivalent state
was demonstrated. After additions of both reductants
and oxidants, a tendency for the U**/U" ratio to
return to the value prior to the addition was observed
during the following few days of fuel circulation.
Attempts to make quantitative interpretations of
chromium waves are in progress. Similar measurements
are now being made of reference fuel in this loop and in
two thermal-convection loops.

Continued studies of the voltammetric measurement
of BiF5 in LiF-BeF,-ZrF, were made in the presence of
NiF,, an anticipated interference. Limits of detection
were about 10 ppm by direct scan voltammetry but

Xi

were extended to a level estimated to be less than 25 -

ppb by stripping techniques. Preparations are being
made to perform similar studies in reference fuel
solvent.

An anodic wave, discovered at a gold electrode in
NaBF,-NaF eutectic, has been shown to be directly
proportional to NaBF;OH concentration. The wave is
complicated by catalytic regeneration of the reactant.
However, when measured under constant voltammetric
conditions, its height is proportional to the concentra-
tion of BF30OH™ as determined by infrared measure-
ments.

PART 3. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT
7. Development of Modified Hastelloy N

Scale-up of the 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N was
advanced by melting two large commercial melts
weighing 8,000 and 10,000 1b. Fabrication of the first
heat (10,000 1b) was difficult because of its narrow
working temperature range. The working temperature
range was much broader for the second heat; so
fabrication was easier. Several products were obtained,
and other products, including tubing, are being fabri-
cated. Small commercial melts were obtained which
contained 2% Ti and small additions of rare earths.
These alloys had good weldability, and their mechanical
properties in the unirradiated and irradiated conditions
were superior to those of standard Hastelloy N.

Two thermal-convection loops and one forced-
circulation loop, FCL-2b, circulating the fuel salt are in
operation. The operating times are short, but the
Inconel 601 thermal-convection loop exhibited rather
high corrosion rates. The other two systems are

constructed of standard Hastelloy N and exhibited
lower corrosion rates. Hastelloy N specimens exposed in
the stressed and unstressed conditions to steam in the
Bull Run Steam Plant fail to show any adverse effects
of the steam.

Considerable effort was spent to develop a screening
test for evaluating the compatibility of metals with
tellurium. Several methods of delivering tellurium to
metal surfaces at a controlled rate are being evaluated.
Several analytical techniques were developed or im-
proved for studying the specimens reacted in these
tests. Nickel foil was exposed to a partial pressure of
tellurium too low to form a stable telluride, but it was
embrittled.

The first fueled irradiation experiment was fabricated
and irradiated successfully. The three fuel pins from
this experiment (TeGen-1) were partially examined.
Metallographic examination of strained segments of the
fuel pins showed that the standard Hastelloy N cracked
profusely, that Inconel 601 was almost totally resistant
to cracking, and that type 304 stainless steel formed
very shallow cracks. These three cracking responses are
essentially those predicted on the basis of our labora-
tory experiments.

8. Fuel Processing Materials Development

Experiments were continued to determine the com-
patibility of graphite with lithium and bismuth-lithium
solutions. The solubility of carbon was found to
increase with increasing lithium content in bismuth-
lithium solutions at 650°C. The rate of thermal-gradient
mass transfer of graphite is being determined in a
molybdenum loop circulating Bi—2.5% Li at 700°C
maximum temperature with a temperature differential
of 100°C.

No evidence of intercalation compounds was found in
graphite exposed to Bi-Li-K and Bi-Li-Cs at 450 or
650°C. However, there was mass transfer of molyb--
denum to graphite in three-component test systems at
650°C.

Lithium was found to react with graphite at both 250
and 650°C. No evidence of intercalation compounds
between graphite and lithium was found at either
temperature, but at 650°C, the graphite was converted
to le C2 .

Coatings of Ni-Al and Ni-Cr-Al were applied to a plain
carbon steel to determine their effectiveness in prevent-
ing air oxidation of the base metal. Samples were
heated at 700°C for 401 hr and at 815°C for 520 hr in
air and thermally cycled 16 times to lower tempera-
tures. The Ni-Cr-Al coating (Metco P-443-10) was
superior to the Ni-Al coating (Metco M<405-10) under
these conditions and appeared to give adequate protec-
tion when applied properly.

PART 4. FUEL PROCESSING FOR MOLTEN-SALT
BREEDER REACTORS

9. Chemistry of Fluorination and Fuel Reconstitution

The rate of reduction of UF; dissolved in fuel salt by
hydrogen gas followed zero-order kinetics at 550°C.
The rate constant was independent of uranium concen-
tration, hydrogen flow rate, and hydrogen partial
pressure. Hydrogen utilization in these tests was <1%.
The apparent reaction rate was increased by approxi-
mately two orders of magnitude and hydrogen utiliza-
tion increased to near stoichiometric by the addition of
platinum catalysts to the melt. Even trace quantities of
platinum that combined with the gold reaction vessel
liner were adequate to effect the same increase; thus
practical application of this catalytic effect of platinum
can be readily attained in the fuel reconstitution step.

10. Engineering Development of Processing Operations

Engineering experiments to study the steps in the
metal-transfer process for removing rare-earth fission
products from MSBR fuel salt are to be continued in
new process vessels which duplicate those used in a
previous experiment, MTE-3. Installation and preopera-
tional testing of the new equipment for the experiment,
designated MTE-3B, have been completed. The addition
of the several salt and bismuth phases to the salt-
bismuth contactor and stripper vessels is under way.
One to two months will be needed to complete these
additions before experiments can begin to measure the
transfer rates for removal of rare earths from the fuel
carrier salt.

The seventh, eighth, and ninth tracer runs (TSMC-7,
-8, and -9) were completed in the mild steel contactor
installed in the salt-bismuth flow-through facility in

Xii

Building 3592. Run TSMC-7 was made at a low agitator

speed (68 rpm) to help define the effect of agitator
speed on the salt-phase mass-transfer coefficient under
conditions where salt is not dispersed into the bismuth.
The mass-transfer coefficient for this run was 0.0057 +
0.0012 cm/sec, which is 65% of the value predicted by
the Lewis correlation. Run TSMC-9 was made at a high
agitator speed (244 rpm) to determine the mass-transfer
coefficient under conditions where salt is dispersed into
the bismuth and to determine if large amounts of
bismuth and salt are entrained in the other phase. The

mass-transfer coefficient was 0.121 * 0.108 cm/sec,
which is 178% of the value predicted by the Lewis
correlation. The data suggest that when the phases are
not dispersed the effect of agitator speed on the
mass-transfer coefficient is less than that predicted by
the Lewis correlation.

Mass-transfer rates between water and mercury have
been measured in a mechanically agitated contactor
using the reaction '

Pb?*[H, 0] + Zn[Hg] - Zn*[H,0] + Pb[Hg] .

Data from a series of five experiments have been
reanalyzed using a model that was based on the
assumptions that the reaction is instantaneous and.
irreversible and occurs entirely at the water-mercury
interface; this reanalysis is to determine if an apparent
change in mass-transfer coefficient during the execution
of a run was due to the controlling resistance to mass
transfer changing from one phase to the other. Several
inconsistencies were found between the model and the
experimental data. Several runs were made in the
water-mercury contactor at an elevated temperature
(~40°C) to test the validity of the assumption that the
interfacial reaction is instantaneous. Results from these
tests were inconclusive.

Investigation was initiated to determine if polar-
ography is a viable alternative method for measuring
mass-transfer rates in a stirred interface contactor using
mercury and an aqueous electrolyte solution. Several
electrolyte solutions were investigated, but none was
found to be entirely inert to mercury. Information
found in the literature suggested that the Fe®*-Fe3*
redox couple (using iron complexed with oxalate ions)
may be suitable as an electrolyte for our application.
Further tests will be performed to determine whether
the iron oxalate electrolyte will produce suitable
polarograms.

Additional runs were made in a simulated fluorinator
in which the vessel wall is protected by a frozen-salt
film and fission-product heating is simulated by auto-
resistance heating. MSBR fuel salt was used in these
tests. Successful operation was not achieved with the
electrode in a side arm (necessary to avoid corrosion
when using fluorine). However several apparently suc-
cessful runs were made with the electrode at the top of
the vertical test section. Successful operation with the
electrode in the side arm may be demonstrated in the
next experiment, now being installed, which will
employ a circulating salt stream.

Measurements of mass-transfer rates in open bubble
columns during CO, absorption in water were con-
tinued. Results were extended to include the effects of
liquid viscosity as well as effects of gas- and liquid-flow
rates on mass-transfer rates. Further improvements were
made in the experimental technique and all previous
data were critically reevaluated. The new data were
combined with the most reliable data from earlier work
to produce correlations for estimating liquid-film mass-
transfer coefficients.

Installation of the fuel-reconstitution engineering
experiment in Building 7503 is expected to be com-
pleted in early April 1975. Details of the equipment for
this experiment are described.

A floor plan for the MSBR Fuel-Processing Engineer-
ing Center has been developed, reviewed, and approved.
The conceptual design of the building is under way and
an Engineering Job Plan has been developed for the
design. '

PART 5. SALT PRODUCTION

11. Production of Fluoride Salt Mixtures
for Research and Development

Activities during the report period fall in three
categories: (1) salt production, (2) facility and equip-
ment modification, and (3) peripheral areas that include
preparation of transfer vessels, assistance to others in
equipment clean-up, and reactivation of liquid-waste
handling facilities and procedures.

Salt production for the period, totaling 358 kg in
three different compositions, was delivered in 22
different containers and required a total of 30 salt
transfers. Most of the salt was produced in an 8-in.-diam
purification vessel and had acceptable purity levels.

A significant effort was devoted to installing of a new
12-in.-diam purification reactor and a new melt-down
vessel in the large production facility, to upgrading the
associated electrical power system, and to placing the
remainder of the facility in operating condition. Load-
ing of the first batch of salt to the large production
system was in progress at the end of the report period.
Part 1. MSBR Design, Development, and Safety

J. R. Engel

The composite objectives of this program are to
evolve a conceptual design for an MSBR with ade-
quately demonstrated performance, safety, and eco-
nomic characteristics that will make it attractive for
commercial power generation and to develop the
associated reactor and safety technology required for
the detailed design, construction, and operation of such
a system. Since it is likely that commercial systems will
be preceded by one or more intermediate-scale test and
demonstration reactors, these objectives include the
conceptual design and technology development asso-
ciated with the intermediate systems. In addition,
molten-salt reactors may be attractive for applications
other than electricity generation in large central stations
powered by breeding cores, so this program also
includes the examination of alternate MSR concepts.

A conceptual breeder design has been prepared and
described! by ORNL and an independent design study
was performed® by an industrial group under sub-
contract to ORNL. In addition, an initial conceptual
design has been developed,® under subcontract, for a
molten-salt-heated steam generator to produce super-
critical steam for an MSBR plant. The design of the
remainder of the plant, including the secondary salt
systems and the steam system, is incomplete; therefore,
the safety, performance, and economic analyses cannot
be precisely made. The industrial study and other
internal reviews have shown that several aspects of the
basic conceptual design of the primary system could be
improved to enhance its overall attractiveness.

ND/74/66 (Dec. 16, 1974).

The current emphasis in the MSR Program is on the
development of the basic system technology, and no
specific design work is now in progress. Design-related
studies are being performed as required to support
technology development, particularly with respect to
safety analyses, tritium management, high-temperature
design methods, and evaluation of basic design alterna-
tives. As the basic technology becomes more firmly
established, the design effort will be expanded to
provide a better basis for the required performance and
safety analyses.

The design work on MSBRs has indicated several areas
in which reactor technology must be developed to
properly make use of the inherent features of these
systems. Components and subsystems will be developed
and operated on various scales up to full size to
contribute to this technology. Currently two
engineering-scale and some smaller scale development
efforts are being pursued. A Gas-Systems Technology
Facility is being constructed to permit studies of
helium-bubble injection and stripping, on a scale repre-
sentative of a test reactor, by methods that are
expected to be applicable to larger systems. This facility
will also be used to study other engineering phenomena,
for examp]e, xenon and tritium behavior and heat
transport, in a system containing MSBR fuel salt. A
Coolant-Salt Technology Facility is being reactivated to
permit studies on a similar scale with the sodium
fluoroborate coolant salt. The initial studies will be
aimed at developing a better understanding of tritium
behavior and management, and the behavior of corro-
sion products in sodium fluoroborate. This facility may
also be used to study, on a small scale, the generation of
steam with molten salt. These loops will also contribute
to a better understanding of the technology of molten-
salt pumps.

A small forced-circulation loop is being operated and
two others are under construction to support the
development of a structural alloy for the MSR primary
circuit. These facilities permit the exposure of candi-
date structural materials to MSBR salts at maximum
design temperature (1300°F) and temperature differen-
tial (250°F) with realistic salt flow velocities in chemical
environments that can be readily manipulated. Effects
of specific fission products (e.g., tellurium) and salt
“redox conditions (e.g., U*'/U*" ratio) can be studied
under conditions that simulate many features of the
reactor system. In addition, small capsules of stationary
fuel salt and alloy test specimens are irradiated to study

separately the effects of reactor-generated fission pro-
ducts and radiation on materials.

Because the fuel in an MSR is molten and is circulated
through the primary circuit, safety considerations for
this concept differ from those of solid-fueled systems.
Studies are being made in order to identify and describe
the postulated events and event sequences that are
important to MSBR safety. These events will be
evaluated in greater detail as the system conceptual
designs evolve.

1.1 TRITIUM BEHAVIOR IN
MOLTEN-SALT SYSTEMS

G. T. Mays

1.1.1 MSBR Tritium Studies

Revisions of the computer program for calculating the
steady-state distribution and transport of tritium in an
MSBR! were completed. The program has been used to
investigate tritium behavior in the [000-MW(e) refer-
ence design MSBR, in which a tritium production rate
of 2420 Ci/day is expected.* Reference values for some
of the parameters in the computer program have not
been confirmed experimentally, so the potential effects
of these parameters upon tritium transport were ex-
amined for a number of combinations of operating
conditions. Various hypothetical methods of limiting
tritium transport to the steam system to within the
design objective of 2 Ci/day were examined also. If the
tritium entering the steam system at this rate were
routinely released in the condenser cooling-water ef-
fluent (~560,000 gpm for once-through cooling), the
tritium concentration would be a factor of 4600 below
the limits of 10 CFR 20 and a factor of 8 below the
guideline of the proposed Appendix I of 10 CFR 50 for
light-water reactors.

1.1.1.1 Background and basis for computer calcula-
tions. Tritium distribution is calculated for the refer-
ence design MSBR plant having a primary salt system, a
secondary salt system, and a steam system consisting of
a steam generator, steam reheater, and superheater. The
fluid in each of these three systems is assumed to be
well mixed and to contain uniform bulk concentrations
of all constituents under steady-state conditions. In
addition, hydrogen isotopic exchange reactions are
assumed to proceed rapidly in all the chemical forms
considered, so that isotopic equilibrium exists through-
out each system.

The mathematical model of the primary system
provides for production of tritium in the fuel salt, mass
transfer of elemental hydrogen® to and permeation
through the metal walls of the reactor vessel and piping

the Steady-State Distribution of Tritium in a Molten-Salt
Breeder Reactor Plant, ORNL-TM-4804 (April 1975).

into the primary containment atmosphere, removal of
gaseous H, and HF by purging the salt with circulating
helium gas bubbles®, sorption of gaseous H, and HF on
graphite, and transfer of elemental forms to and
through the metal walls of the primary heat exchanger
tubes into the secondary salt system. The equations for
the secondary system treat the transfer of elemental
forms through the piping into the cell atmosphere,
purging by circulating helium gas bubbles, and transfer
through the tubing walls of the steam generator,
superheater, and reheater into the steam system. The
introduction of chemical agents into the primary and
secondary salt systems for removal of tritium is also
provided for.

The steam system and the cells around the reactor
primary and secondary systems are considered to be
sinks for tritium. Disposition of the tritium that reaches
these locations is not treated explicitly in the model,
but the tritium probably would appear in liquid wastes.

Some of the processes identified above are not dis-
cussed explicitly in the description of the reference de-
sign MSBR; they were included in the computational
model to provide greater flexibility in considering
potential approaches for achieving the design objective
for tritium release. These processes are the circulating-
bubble purge of the secondary salt, sorption of gaseous
forms of hydrogen in the secondary system, and the
addition of chemical agents to facilitate removal of trit-
ium from the primary and secondary systems. The re-
sults given in the remainder of this section include con-
sideration of all these processes except the sorption pro-
cess in the secondary salt. (No simple procedure could
be visualized for implementing the sorption process in a
reactor system.)

Hydrogen is presumed to exist in the fuel salt in an
elemental form (H,) and a chemically combined form

3. Throughout this section, it will be convenient to use the
terms hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride and the symbols H, and
HF when reference is made to the chemical species, independ-
ent of hydrogen isotopic composition. For specific reference to
elemental tritium and tritium fluoride, the symbols used are
*H, (even though it probably occurs as the mixed molecule
3H'H) and ®HF. For specific reference to the more abundant
hydrogen isotope, the terms protium and protium fluoride and
the symbols ' H, and ' HF are used.

bubbles is to provide stripping of noble-gas fission products to
limit xenon poisoning.
(HF) in relative amounts that depend on the redox
potential of the salt of the UF,;/UF; ratio; that is UF,
+ Y4 H,=UF; + HF. In addition, the UF4/UF; ratio
determines largely the corrosion potential in the pri-
mary system because of reactions of the type: 2UF, +
M®=2UF; + MF,. If the corrosion effects resulting
from a UF,/UF; ratio greater than the value of 100
assumed in the reference design are found to be toler-
able, a larger fraction of the tritium would be present as
tritium fluoride. Under some conditions, tritium fluo-

ride might react with the metal walls of the reactor

system to produce elemental tritium, which could then
diffuse through the walls, that is,

2HF + M° = MF, + H,

However, for these calculations it was assumed that
hydrogen fluoride, at low concentrations and tolerable
salt redox potentials, would react sufficiently slowly
with the metal walls that the contribution of *HF to
tritium transport through the walls could be neglected.
However, the rate at which HF reacts with the metal
wall under these conditions is not known, and neglect-
ing this effect could cause the calculations to under-
estimate tritium release in circumstances where much of
the tritium is present as tritium fluoride.

In the primary circuit, hydrogen fluoride will be pro-
duced by the reaction:

UF, + % H, = UF; + HF,
for which the equilibrium quotient may be written:

X(UFy) ~ PHF) _
X(UF,) " [P(H,)] 172

where
X = concentration,

P = partial pressure.

The reference value used for the equilibrium quotient,
M=1.12 X 107® atm1/2 is that predicted by the data
of Long and Blankenship®. Although the value is based
on experimental measurements, there is some uncer-
tainty about its magnitude. A decrease in the value of
the equilibrium quotient would have the same effect
with respect to tritium behavior as decreasing the

Trifluoride, Part II. Stability in Molten Fluoride Solution,
ORNL-TM-2065, Part I1 (November 1969).

UF,/UF; ratio (with a given equilibrium quotient
value) while an increase in the value would have the
opposite effect.

The secondary system of an MSBR would not
normally contain constituents that are capable of oxi-
dizing hydrogen to hydrogen fluoride to limit the avail-
ability of hydrogen for diffusion through the metal
walls. Therefore, the model provides for the addition of
protium fluoride or other compounds containing pro-
tium to the secondary system. It is assumed that the
tritium will exchange with the protium in the added
compound and that the compound can then be re-
moved.

Several mass-transfer processes are involved in the
description of tritium behavior. These include the trans-
port of H, and HF from the fuel salt to. the graphite
moderator in the reactor core, the transport of H, from
salt to various metal surfaces in both the primary and
secondary systems, and the transport of H, from the
steam system to steam-generator surfaces. In all cases,
these processes are described by conventional mass-
transfer relations of the form:

—f-: h(CB — Cs)

where

— = transport rate per unit of interfacial area,
atoms/(sec cm?)

AN L

h = mass-transfer coefficient, cm/sec, and

Cpg, Cg = concentrations in the bulk fluid and at the
interfaces, atoms per cubic centimeter of
salt.

The interfacial areas are appropriate for the reference
design MSBR, and the mass-transfer coefficients were
calculated from heat-transfer—mass-transfer analogies
for the fluids in question. The reference values for areas
and mass-transfer coefficients are listed (Table 1.1);
these values were not varied in the studies reported
here.

In addition to the mass-transfer processes that were
treated explicitly, the effects of mass transfer of hydro-
gen and HF to the circulating purge gases were des-
cribed, also. Preliminary calculations indicated that the
transfer of hydrogen and HF will be limited by the
saturation concentrations of the stripped gases in the
bubbles, rather than by mass transfer to the bubbles, so
that equilibration between the gas and liquid phases
could be assumed. As a consequence, effective H, and

However, these coefficients could be lower for the
steam-system components due to the formation of
oxide films on the steam side. Reductions in the
nominal permeability coefficients by factors ranging
from 10 to 1000 might be expected, which would de-
crease tritium transport to the steam system. Oxide

films may also cause the transport process to vary with
partial pressure raised to a power greater than %, with
an upper limit of 1. The permeability coefficients may
be varied in the computational model, but no provision
is made for changing the exponent on the pressure
terms from Y%. Use of the Y% -power relationship would
tend to overestimate the rate of tritium transport
through the metal walls if the actual process were pro-
portional to the pressure to a power greater than Y%, .
The calculations would not underestimate the transport
unless the partial pressure of hydrogen exceeded the
reference pressure for the permeability coefficient,
which is usually 1 atm.

Partial pressures of dissolved gases are used to
describe the sorption processes, as well as the permea-
tion of metals by hydrogen. Therefore, solubilities of
H, and HF in both the fuel and coolant salt are re-
quired. The partial pressure, P, of a dissolved gas is
related to its concentration at a given temperature by:

P=KC,

where

K = Henry’s law constant® for the solubility of gas in
salt, atm/(atom H/cm? salt),

C = concentration in the salt, atoms/cm?.

The solubility coefficient or Henry’s law constant for
H;, in the fuel salt is described by an empirical
relationship' ® based on experimental data, from which
estimates' ' of H, solubility in sodium fluoroborate
were also derived. This relation probably yields
reasonably accurate values for the fuel salt, but the
values for sodium fluoroborate are less certain.
Experimental data'? were used to estimate the
solubility coefficient of HF in fuel salt and to infer a
coefficient for coolant salt. Reference values of the
solubility coefficients for H, and HF in various parts of
the system are listed (Table 1.2). Owing to the greater
solubility in salts for HF than for H,, significant
variations in the solubility coefficients for HF would be
expected to have a greater effect on the calculated

a Henry’s Law constant.

tritium behavior than comparable variations in H,
solubility.

Evidence from the MSRE and other experimental
work'? indicate that tritium will be sorbed on graphite,
but sorption of tritium fluoride on graphite is
questionable, owing largely to the low permeability of
the graphite with respect to gases. Since the calculations
indicate that tritium fluoride sorption on graphite
would be a significantly more important
tritium-removal mechanism than sorption of elemental
tritium on graphite, conditions neglecting sorption on
graphite were also examined. To permit consideration
of the core graphite as either a highly efficient sorber
for H, and for HF or as a nonsorber, an expression was
developed to describe the sorption process as a
mass-transfer rate. In developing this expression it was
assumed that the concentration of gas sorbed (either H,
or HF, either tritiated or not) on the surface of the
sorber is proportional to the square root of the tritium
partial pressure in the gas phase at the sorber surface
and that the sorber surface could be replaced at an
arbitrarily specified rate. The latter assumption permits
use of the same expression to describe the continuous
addition and removal of a sorber in the secondary salt
system. The resultant expression is:

£=BWP1/L
A

where
B = sorption coefficient, atoms/(cm? atm!/2),
W = sorber replacement rate, fraction/sec,
P'= gas partial pressure, atm.

To eliminate sorption as a mechanism, the sorber
surface area, A, is set equal to zero, and to describe a
highly effective sorber, that is, an infinite sink, the
surface replacement rate, W, may be made arbitrarily
large (e.g. 1 sec™!). A sorption coefficient for H, (and
HF) was calculated from the observation that, at 600°C
and 107% atm, hydrogen is sorbed on graphite to the
extent of about 0.01 of a monolayer. This value,
coupled with the observation that tritium in the MSRE
was sorbed to a depth of about 1.5 mm on graphite
with a density of 1.8 g/cm?® and a surface area of ~1
m?/g, leads to a sorption coefficient of 3 X 102!

considered in the calculations, the specific value of the
sorption coefficient is unimportant for the results
obtained to date.

Calculations have been made to estimate the behavior
and distribution of tritium in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR with
parameter values and operating conditions associated
with the reference design and for a number of other
assumed parameter values and conditions. The primary
purpose was to determine if possible combinations
could be identified which would limit the rate of
tritium transport to the steam system to 2 Ci/day or
less. The reference design conditions include sorption of
H, and HF by the core graphite, a UF,;/UF; ratio of
10?, and steam-system tube permeabilities to hydrogen
that are appropriate for clean metal. Other parameter
variations and operating conditions examined thus far
consist in the following:

1. deletion of sorption of H, and HF by the core
graphite,

2. UF,4/UF; ratio,

3. permeability of the steam-system tubes to hydrogen,

4. rate of addition of hydrogen to the primary and/or
secondary system, |

5. rate of addition of hydrogen fluoride to the second-
ary system,

6. salt bypass flow rates and purge-gas flow rates in the
primary and secondary systems,

7. an alternate side-stream contacting process for the
primary and/or secondary system, such as a spray

tower or packed column, with no limitation on the
purge-gas flow rate through the contactor and an
assumed removal efficiency of 99% for H, and HF
in the bypass salt stream (10% of main flow),

8. rate of hydrogen back-diffusion from the steam
system as a consequence of hydrogen concentrations
in the steam system greater than the reference
values, due either to deliberate additions or to corro-
sion effects,

9. rate of addition (and removal) of a hydrogen-bearing

chemical species or getter to the secondary system
to establish the circulating concentration necessary
to limit tritium transport to the steam system to 2
Ci/day or less, for a predetermined rate of processing
the secondary coolant.

In addition to the calculation of the effects on tritium
distribution of each of the above parameters and opera-
ting conditions singly, with the others held at their
reference values, calculations were also made to show
the effects of variations in combination with reduced
steam-tube permeabilities, higher UF,/UF; ratios, and
no sorption of HF or H, on core graphite, because of
the potentially large effects of these three parameters..

1.1.1.2 Calculated tritium behavior for various opera-
ting conditions. Under reference conditions (no special

-measures taken to limit tritium transport, sorption of

HF and H, by graphite included, a UF, /UF; ratio of
10%, and steam-system tube permeabilities that corres-
pond to clean metal), ~30.2% (731 Ci/day) of the 2420
Ci/day of tritium produced transfers to the steam
system. When sorption by graphite is assumed not to
occur, about 58.9% of the tritium produced (1425
Ci/day) transfers to the steam system. These values are
to be compared with the design objective for tritium
transport to the steam system of 2 Ci/day (about 0.1%
of the production rate).

The effect of increasing the UF,;/UF; ratio for a
range of steam-system tube permeabilities both with
and without sorption of hydrogen and HF on graphite
is shown (Fig. 1.1). If unlimited sorption on core

graphite is assumed to occur, the tritium transfer rate to
the steam system will be 2 Ci/day or less for UF,; /UF;
ratios of 7 X 10% or higher, even with clean steam
tubes. Under these conditions, a large fraction of the
tritium is present as tritium fluoride, and sorption of
tritium fluoride by graphite would become the primary
mechanism for removal of tritium from the fuel salt.
However, if graphite sorption is assumed not to occur,
unacceptably large quantities of tritium would enter the
steam system even with the steam-tube permeability
value reduced from the clean-metal value by a factor of
1000 and a UF,/UF; ratio of 10%. Under these latter
conditions the primary system purge-gas stream would
remove 87% of the tritium, but 34 Ci of tritium would
still reach the steam system. Thus, the rate of tritium
transport to the steam system can be limited to 2
Ci/day in the absence of special removal processes only
if sorption of both hydrogen and HF on graphite is
assumed.

The effects of reduced permeability of the steam
tubes on the rate at which tritium transfers to the steam
system with a UF,/UF; ratio of 100 both with and
without sorption on core graphite are shown (Fig. 1.2).
Permeability reductions by a factor of about 4 X 10*
would be required to meet the 2-Ci/day limit if reduc-
tion of steam-tube permeability were the only measure
considered for limiting tritium transport. As the reduc-
tions in steam-tube permeability values are increased,
larger amounts of tritium transfer into the secondary-
system containment cell.

FACTORS BY WHICH STEAM TUBE
PERMEABILITIES ARE REDUCED

Fig. 1.2. Effects of steam-tube permeability reductions on
tritium transport. ‘ -
With steam-tube permeabilities that correspond to
clean metal, addition of H, to the primary and/or
secondary salt systems increases the rate at which
tritium is transported to the steam system for addition
rates that are below about 10° times the tritium pro-
duction rtate. The protium addition has two direct
effects: an increase in the total HF concentration due
to the reaction UF, + Y% H,=UF; + HF, and a much
larger decrease in the 3H,/'H, ratio. With isotopic
equilibrium in both the elemental and combined states,

the net result is a decrease in the fraction of the total -

tritium present as *HF and an increase in the absolute
concentration of dissolved *H,. In addition, the metal-
permeation rates that result from low protium addition
rates are low enough that the dominant resistance to
hydrogen transfer to the steam system is the salt film,
rather than the metal wall. Hence, the rate of hydrogen
transport to the steam system is almost directly propor-
tional to the first power of the total concentration of

dissolved hydrogen, and the rate of tritium permeation .

increases with the increase in concentration of
elemental tritium. At higher protium addition rates,
additional increases in HF concentration and decreases

in *H,/'H, ratio occur, leading to still higher concen-

trations of dissolved elemental tritium. :
However, the rate of hydrogen permeation through
the metal becomes sufficiently high that the metal
resistance begins to become dominant over the fluid-
film resistance. As a consequence, the total hydrogen
permeation rate into the steam system increases only as

the square root of the dissolved hydrogen concentration .

while the *H,/"H, ratio decreases more rapidly. This

leads to a net decrease in the rate of tritium transport.

to the steam system. When lower steam-tube permea-
bilities are considered, the tube-wall resistance is
dominant at very low hydrogen permeation rates. Thus,
even low rates of protium addition, in conjunction with
lower steam-tube permeability values, significantly
reduce the rate at which tritium transfers to the steam
system (Fig. 1.3). Both the primary- and secondary-
system purge streams remove substantial amounts of
tritium under these conditions.

A protium addition rate of 10° times the tritium pro-
duction rate along with a reduction in steam-tube per-
meability by a factor of 100 is required to adequately
restrict the rate of tritium transfer to the steam system.
However, the dilution of the tritium as a result of add-
ing protium at this rate would not be acceptable. The
tritium production rate of 2420 Ci/day corresponds to
only 0.8 cm®/day of *H,0. However, if the *H, 0 were
diluted with *H, O by a factor of 10°, about 8800 m?
of water would result after 30 years of reactor opera-

tion. Storing this much water is not economically
acceptable. Reducing the steam-tube permeability by a
factor of 1000 reduces the required 'H, addition rate
to 10% times the tritium production rate. The effect of
graphite sorption at these protium addition rates is con-
siderably less pronounced than in the reference case.
The results were essentially the same for a given rate of
protium addition to either the primary or secondary
system. Simultaneous additions to both primary and
secondary circuits provide little advantage over addition
of hydrogen to either circuit. | -

Addition of protium fluoride to the secondary system
as a means of suppressing the rate of tritium transport:
to the steam system requires that the rate of exchange
of tritium for protium in HF to form 3HF shall be rapid
and that the *HF shall not react rapidly with the metal
walls to liberate tritium. As shown in Fig. 1.4, addition
of 'HF to the secondary circuit at 500 times the trit-
ium production rate (5.5 cm’/sec) limits the rate of
tritium transport to the steam system to 2 Ci/day or
less without assuming soirption of H, or HF or a reduc-
tion in the permeability of the steam system tubes be-
low that of clean metal. Addition of 'HF at this rate
would require adding and removing about 42 g-moles of
HF per day or about 0.84 kg per day. The correspond-
ing steady-state concentration of HF in the secondary
salt would be 0.6 ppm. B

ADDITION RATE TIMES TRITIUM PRODUCTION RATE

Fig. 1.4. Effects of HF addition to the secondary system on
the rate of tritium transport to the steam system.

Increasing the secondary purge-gas flow rate from 20
cfm (reference value) to 100 cfm along with addition of

'HF resulted in essentially no further reduction in the.

rate at which tritium transferred to the steam system.
Increasing the UF,/UF; ratio above the reference value
of 10% with 'HF additions also proved no more effec-
tive because the increase in removal of *HF by the
purge systems gained from the higher UF,;/UF; ratio
was negated by the decrease in removal of elemental
tritium in the purge systems due to the same increased
UF,/UF, ratio.

The gas-purge system of the reference-design MSBR
involves the injection of helium gas bubbles directly
into the salt stream, bubble circulation throughout the
loop, and gas stripping from a bypass flow on the main
loop. This system is explicitly provided for the fuel salt,
and for this investigation, a similar system is presumed
for the secondary salt. Variations in the operating para-
meters for such systems are limited by the bypass flow
rates, nominally 10%, that are economically acceptable
and by the circulating void fractions'? associated with
the gas purge rates, nominally 10 and 20 cfm for the
primary and secondary circuits, respectively. Neverthe-

10

less, various combinations of increased bypass flows in
the primary and secondary circuits, 15%; increased
purge-gas flows, 20 cfm and 40 cfm for the primary and
secondary systems, respectively; a further increase of
the secondary purge gas flow, 100 cfm;higher UF,/UF;
ratio, 10%; and consideration of graphite sorption and
permeability reduction of the steam tubes were all ex-
amined. However, the results of the calculations indi-
cated that the design objective of 2 Ci/day would not
be attained with the most favorable combination of
these particular parameter values within the ranges indi-
cated above. Only when the UF,/UF; ratio was 102,
with graphite sorption allowed, steam-tube permea-
bilities reduced by a factor of 1000, bypass flows in-
creased to 15%, and gas purge flows increased to 20 cfm
and 100 cfm for the primary and secondary systems,
respectively (where 9 Ci/day entered the steam system)
was the 2 Ci/day rate even approached. Thus stripping
via circulating gas bubbles in the absence of the addi-
tion of protium or protium-bearing materials will not
adequately limit tritium transport to the steam system.
These results led to a consideration of gas-stripping
systems outside the main loops, for example, spray
towers or packed columns, in which the gas flow rates
would be less restricted. For calculation purposes, it
was assumed that 99% stripping efficiencies for H, and
HF could be achieved. The calculations indicated that
high stripping efficiencies alone, on 10% salt bypass
streams, would not adequately limit tritium transport
to the steam system. The objective of a 2 Ci/day or less
tritium release rate was reached when the 99% stripping
efficiencies were assumed for 20% salt bypass streams,
with the UF,/UF, ratio at 103 and steam-tube permea-
bilities reduced by a factor of 100. In this case nearly
all the tritium was removed in the primary-system strip-
per, as >HF. Thus, small HF injections, with high strip-
ping efficiency, would achieve the 2 Ci/day objective
with less drastic changes in the other operating para-
meters. -
Some hydrogen will be present in the steam system of
an MSBR as a consequence of metal corrosion and the
thermal dissociation of water at high temperatures, as
well as from hydrogen added for corrosion control or
tritium management. If water dissociation is the only
source of hydrogen, the hydrogen concentrations in
steam will be 4 X 1073 ppb (by volume) in the steam
generator, 0.2 ppb in the superheater, and (.14 ppb in

fuel circuit because of nuclear reactivity effects. Effects on
pump performance limit the desirable void fraction in the
secondary circuit to a few percent.
the steam reheater; these quantities are used as refer-
ence values in the mathematical model. The effect of
back-diffusion of hydrogen from the steam system to
the secondary salt circuit on the rate of tritium trans-
port into the steam system was examined for steam-
system hydrogen concentrations ranging from 1 ppb to
100 ppm by volume.

With all other system parameters and operating condi-
tions at their reference values, increased hydrogen
back-diffusion increased the rate of tritium transport to
the steam system until the hydrogen concentration
reached ~10 ppm (Fig. 1.5). (When H, and HF sorp-
tion on core graphite was eliminated, the rate of tritium
transport to the steam system peaked at ~5 ppm H,.)
At higher steam-system hydrogen concentrations and
when the steam-tube permeabilities were reduced by a
factér of 100, tritium transport to the steam system
was inhibited. The rationale for this behavior is essen-
tially the same as that described earlier in connection
with direct hydrogen injections into the primary and
secondary systems. However, inhibition by hydrogen
back-diffusion was insufficient to limit tritium trans-
port to the steam system to the desired 2 Ci/day (Fig.
1.5).

If tritium entering the secondary salt system of an
MSBR could be converted to a chemically inert form
(i.e., a form which would not yield elemental tritium),
tritium transport to the steam system could be greatly
reduced. Consequently, tritium distribution calculations

weére made for conditions in which a hypothetical
hydrogen-bearing chemical, or getter, was continuously
added to the secondary salt and continuously removed
from a 10% salt bypass stream, with an efficiency of
80%, by an unspecified process. It was assumed that
rapid isotopic exchange would occur between tritium in
the salt and one atom of hydrogen per molecule of
getter and that the getter was completely inert. Under
these assumptions, with reference values for all other
system parameters and operating conditions but with-
out H, and HF sorption on core graphite, tritium trans-
port to the steam system was limited to ~1 Ci/day for
gram-mmole addition rates of the getter equal to 103
times the gram-atom production rate of tritium, or 42
kg/day if the getter molecular weight is 50. Note that

these results are quite similar to those obtained for the

addition of protium fluoride to the secondary salt for
the case where sorption on graphite was assumed not to
occur and with reference steam-tube permeability
values (Fig. 1.4).

Under the assumptions stated above and for fixed
operating conditions (other than salt bypass flow rate)
the required rate of getter addition to achieve a given
rate of tritium transport to the steam system is inde-
pendent of the salt bypass flow rate. However, the salt
bypass flow rate determines the equilibrium concentra-
tion of the getter in the secondary salt. Section 1 of
Table 1.3 shows the resultant concentrations in the
secondary salt at several different salt bypass flow rates,
along with the specific activity of tritium in the getter
(waste).

Because of the effect of hydrogen back-diffusion
from the steam system on the tritium transport rate to
the steam system and the fact that the hydrogen con-
centration to be expected in an MSBR steam system is
not accurately known, additional calculations were
made to determine the getter addition rates required to
limit tritium transport to the steam system to ~I
Ci/day. The results for hydrogen-in-steam concentra-
tions of 100 ppb and 100 ppm are shown in Sects. 2
and 3, respectively, of Table 1.3. Substantially more
getter would be required at higher concentrations if
high concentrations of hydrogen in steam are encoun-
tered.

In Table 1.4 are presented the calculated distributions
for removal of tritium in curies per full-power day for
some of the various conditions previously discussed.

proposed deuterium injection experiments for the
Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF). The purpose
of the experiments was to investigate the possibility of
tritium retention in sodium fluoroborate coolant salt
using deuterium as a stand-in for tritium. The results of
the calculations could be applied to either deuterium or
tritium for the conditions considered.

The parameters to be varied were temperature (850,
1000, 1150°F) of the loop, salt flow rate (785, 520
gpm), and deuterium injection rate (1.33, 2.8 cc/hr).

The results indicate that, for reference permeability
values of the loop walls, the steady-state concentrations
of deuterium in the salt and off-gas could be expected
to range from 0.013 ppb to 0.34 ppb and from 0.04
ppm to 1.1 ppm, respectively. For a reduction of wall
permeabilities by a factor of 10 the concentrations in
the salt and off-gas would range from 0.3 ppb to 7.3
ppb and from 0.9 ppm to 24 ppm, respectively. The
results are presented as D, or T, concentrations in the
salt as a function of the test parameters (Table 1.5).

1.2 NEUTRONIC ANALYSES
H. T.Kerr E.J. Allen

Estimates of the 233U fission rate and the tellurium
production rate in the recently completed TeGen-1 cap-
sule experiment (Sect. 7.14) were obtained from a flux
mapping experiment, direct flux monitoring in the
TeGen-1 capsule, and computational analyses.

In the flux mapping experiment, aluminum tubes con-
taining various monitor materials were inserted into an
aluminum-iron capsule intended to simulate the
TeGen-1 capsule. These monitors were irradiated in
selected positions in the P4B poolside facility of the
ORR. (The TeGen-1 capsule was operated in the adja-
cent facility, P4A) The 233U fission rate in the
TeGen-1 capsule was then estimated, based on the in-
duced activities of these monitors.

Various monitor wires were also contained within the
TeGen-1 capsule. When the TeGen-1 capsule was disas-
sembled, these wires were recovered and the induced
activities for the following reactions were measured:

59 Co(n,7)*° Co,
**Fe(n,p)**Mn,
58 Fe(n,y)*? Fe.

The activities of these monitors indicate a 233U fission
rate (and tellurium production) which is 40% less than
that previously estimated from the flux mapping experi-
ment.

To determine the source of this discrepancy, calcula-
tions were made using the neutron transport code
XSDRNPM!®. The calculations indicate that the
TeGen-1 capsule reduces the flux by about 35% more

than the aluminum-iron mockup capsule, which ac-
counts for the discrepancy between the two experi-
mental values for the 223U fission rate.

The corrected full-power fission rates and heat genera-
tion rates for the three fuel pins in the TeGen-1 capsule
are:

Fission rate Fission heat

(fissions/sec atom) rate (W)
Upper fuel pin 293X10°° 192.4
Middle fuel pin 3.23x10°° 211.5
Lower fuel pin 290x10° 190.4

An average fission rate of 2.15 X 10~ fission/sec per
atom of 223U was used to estimate the amounts of the
various tellurium isotopes produced by the irradiation.
These amounts are expressed as equivalent uniform
tellurium-deposition densities on the salt-wetted metal
surface (27 cm?) of each fuel pin (Table 1.6). The cal-
culated quantities are based on yield data from ref. 16
with the assumption that all the tellurium deposits
instantaneously on the metal surface. The maximum
integrated tellurium exposure was computed from the
total amount produced during the 67-day irradiation;
but this calculated value is clearly an overestimate since
significant fractions of the shorter-lived isotopes would
decay before the atoms could reach the metal surface.
The remaining two columns indicate the amount of tel-
lurium that theoretically could have been on the surface
after irradiation for 33.5 and 67 days, with appropriate

Program. From the results to be obtained, simplified
~ ratchetting Tules can be developed and/or evaluated,

modeling procedures for applying simplified ratchetting
rules to prototypic component geometries and loadings
can be examined, and the conservative applicability of
simplified rules and procedures and of elastic creep-
fatigue rules can be tested. Although the reference
material being used in these studies currently is type
304 stainless steel, a careful assessment of the applica-
bility of the results to Hastelloy N will be made. A
series of inelastic pipe-ratchetting analyses will be done
using Hastelloy N properties and typical MSBR temper-
ature and pressure histograms to determine the severity
of the thermal-ratchetting and creep-fatigue damage
problems in the MSBR (Sec. 1.3.2).

1.3.1 Analytical Investigation of the Applicability
of Simplified Ratchetting and Creep-Fatigue
Rules to Reactor System Component Geometries

1.3.1.1 Purpose. The purpose of the analytical
studies being performed under this task is twofold.
First, modeling procedures for applying the simplified

16

ratchetting rules given in ASME Code Case 1592 (ref. -

19), RDT Standard F9-4 (ref. 20), and RDT Standard
F9-5 (ref. 21) to geometries and loadings prototypic of
those encountered in high-temperature reactor com-
ponent designs are to be identified. Second, the
conservative applicability of these ratchetting rules and
procedures and of elastic creep-fatigue rules will prob-
ably be demonstrated and placed on a reasonably sound
and defensible engineering basis.

The basic approach is to perform a relatively small
number of carefully planned and coordinated rigorous
elastic-plastic-creep ratchetting-type analyses. The prob-
lems being examined range from prototypic three-
dimensional component geometries and loadings to
more basic two-dimensional axisymmetric problems
specially contrived to augment the more complex
problems by delineating the individual factors that
determine or influence ratchetting behavior in realistic
structures. Each inelastic analysis will include a com-
plete Code evaluation for accumulated strains and
creep-fatigue damage. Also associated with. each inelas-
tic analysis are a number of elastic analyses to provide
the input parameters required to apply the various
simplified ratchetting rules and procedures and elastic
creep-fatigue rules.

1.3.1.2 Discussion of problem. ASME Code Case
1592 and RDT Standard F9-5 provide simplified rules
and procedures that, in certain specified situations, can
be used in lieu of a detailed inelastic analysis for
demonstrating that the maximum accumulated inelastic
strains do not exceed the specified Code limits. In
addition to the O’Donnell-Porowski method?? that is
included in Code Case 1592, RDT Standard F94 also
allows the use of a modified Bree complete relaxation
method®® and of a detailed one-dimensional (pipe

ratchetting) inelastic analysis to predict accumulated
strains in more complex structures. Both the
O’Donnell-Porowski method and the Bree complete
relaxation method use the results of elastic calculations.
In fact, even the one-dimensional inelastic analysis must
properly reflect the elastically calculated primary mem-
brane and secondary discontinuity stresses.

All of these simplified rules and procedures are, as
explained in RDT Standard F9-5 (ref. 21), based on
mathematically one-dimensional inelastic analyses of
thin-walled cylindrical vessels under sustained internal
pressure with a cyclic temperature gradient through the
wall. The conservative applicability of these simplified
rules and procedures to straight pipes with axisym-
metric thermal and mechanical secondary stresses has
been verified through comparisons with the results of
detailed inelastic analyses.?* These simplified rules and

‘procedures have also been shown to be applicable to a

nozzle-to-spherical-shell geometry with axisymmetric
loadings®*:%% and to thin-walled pipes subjected to
nonaxisymmetric bending loads.?” On the basis of
these few comparisons, RDT Standard F9-5 states that
the simplified rules and procedures can, with caution,
generally be applied to axisymmetric shells subjected to
axisymmetric loadings in locations where there are no
local structural discontinuities?® and to straight pipes
subjected to net nonaxisymmetric bending. For the
latter case, the maximum outer fiber bending stress
must be treated as an axisymmetric axial primary stress
in the one-dimensional evaluation.

28. A local structural discontinuity is a geometric or material
discontinuity, such as a partial penetration weld or a small fillet
or notch, that affects the stress and strain distributions through
only a fractional part of the wall thickness. Local discontinu-
ities have no significant effect on shell-type discontinuity
deformations. -
As stated, the applicability of these procedures is
severely limited. Without justification and owner ap-
proval they cannot be used in many, if not most,
realistic design situations. These limitations were recog-
nized when the rules were written, but it was expected
that they would be shown to conservatively apply to a
broader class of structural situations as additional
inelastic analyses of prototypic structures were per-
formed and experience was accumulated.

This study will provide the basis and justification for
removing the limitations placed on the applicability of
the simplified ratchetting rules and procedures. The
validity of the application of these procedures to
regions of local structural discontinuity, to nonaxisym-
metric loading on axisymmetric shell-type structures,
and to general nonaxisymmetric shell-type structures
(such as nozzle-to-cylinder attachments, valve bodies,

- piping elbows, etc.) is being systematically and progres-

sively studied. Although these specific applications are
limited by present Code restrictions, this study is to
show that the procedures are appropriate for any
general shell-type structure.

If costly and time-consuming rigorous inelastic analy-
ses are to be avoided in design, the elastic creep-fatigue
rules must be satisfied as well as the simplified
ratchetting rules. The elastic creep-fatigue rules in Code
Case 1592 include the use of an approximate equation
for estimating the maximum inelastic strain from
elastically calculated quantities for determining fatigue
damage. The fatigue curves to be used include reduc-
tions for slow strain rates and hold times. Creep damage
is based only on primary and secondary stresses
resulting from sustained operating conditions; second-
ary stresses generated by transients are assumed to relax
off and thus be taken care of by the hold-time effects
that are factored into the elastic analysis fatigue curves.

The conservatism of these and other possible elastic
analysis creep-fatigue rules relative to the more rigorous
inelastic analysis rules is currently being evaluated by
the ASME Code Working Group on Creep-Fatigue for
simple cylindrical shells.?® ORNL participated in this
evaluation by performing a series of comparative elastic
and inelastic analyses and evaluations.®® The conserva-
tive applicability of the procedures to more prototypic
geometries and loadings is even more uncertain. Thus,
comparative elastic and inelastic creep-fatigue evalua-
tions are an important part of the study described
herein. These evaluations allow an assessment to be

made of the conservatism of the various elastic
creep-fatigue procedures and also help to establish the

relation between the simplified ratchetting rules and

17

procedures and elastic rules and

procedures. .
1.3.1.3 Scope of Study. The analytical study consists

creep-fatigue

of five types of elastic-plastic-creep ratchetting
analyses:
1. notched circular cylindrical shells — 2 cases,

2. circular cylindrical shells with axial temperature,
pressure, and/or wall thickness variations — 7 cases,

3. prototypic nozzle-to-spherical-shell attachment
(FFTF IHX inlet nozzle geometry) — 1 case,

4. prototypic nozzle-to-cylindricalshell attachment
(FFTF IHX inlet nozzle geometry) — 1 case.

5. comparison infinite cylinder (one-dimensional pipe
ratchetting) analyses — 30 to 40 cases.

These tive types of analyses are described with a brief
statement of the purpose of each and a description of
the types of loadings to be applied and the analyses to
be performed (Table 1.7).

These analyses are being carried out in a closely
coordinated manner by ORNL and ORNL subcontrac-
tors. The axisymmetric analyses (types 1 and 2) and the
one-dimensional pipe ratchetting analyses (type 5) are
being performed at ORNL using the two-dimensional
elastic-plastic-creep finite-element program PLACRE.
The nozzle-to-sphere and nozzle-to-cylinder analyses
were subcontracted by ORNL to two LMFBR com-
ponent manufacturers experienced in performing com-
plex inelastic analyses on realistic component geo-
metries. The MARC computer program is being used for
these cases, and a three-dimensional element idealiza-
tion will be used to properly represent the reinforced
junction region in detail.

Although the analyses are being performed at differ-
ent locations using different computer programs, the
analysis efforts are being jointly planned and coordi-
nated by the several participants. Of course, it is
imperative in a study of this kind that the various
inelastic analyses be completely compatible with one
another. As far as possible, the mesh layouts and the
degree of mesh refinement are similar in all cases.
Identical constitutive relations and material behavior

29. The most questionable aspect being examined in this
evaluation is the stress value used in the creep damage
determination.

AlBo, each inelastic analysis will be accampanied by a series of elastic analyses for each individual loading and, where
appropriate, by a transient thermal analysis.
representations are being used in all cases. The constitu-
tive equations being used are those recommended in
RDT Standard F9-5 (ref. 21), and the physical and
mechanical properties were obtained from the Nuclear
Systems Materials Handbook.?"

To assure that the inelastic analyses performed by the
various participating groups are completely compatible,
each group is performing an identical analysis of a
straight pipe subjected to an internal pressure and to
repeated internal sodium downshocks followed by hold
periods. Five cycles are being analyzed in this bench-
mark problem. Any significant differences between the
various results will be resolved before the final inelastic
analyses are run.

As previously mentioned, each inelastic analysis will
be accompanied by a number of additional supporting
analyses. In many of the cases, a transient thermal
analysis is required. Common heat transfer and physical
properties are being -used in all the thermal analyses.
Also, each inelastic analysis will have a series of
companion elastic analyses for the individual mechani-
cal and thermal loadings at different points during the
transients. Primary and secondary stress magnitudes and
elastic strain concentration values from these elastic
analyses will be used in applying the simplified ratchet-
ting rules and the elastic creep-fatigue rules at various
critical cross sections or locations.

Each inelastic analysis will include a determination of
inelastic strains during each hold period as follows:

1. strain averaged through the thickness at critical
locations,

2. surface strains at critical locations due to equivalent
linear distributions through the thickness, and

3. maximum strains at critical locations.??

The inelastic strains' of interest are the maximum
positive principal strains computed from the strain
components as specified in Code Case 1592 guidelines.
Each inelastic analysis will also include inelastic creep-
fatigue damage calculations at critical locations using
Code Case 1592 rules. |

Experience has shown that at least ten cycles of
loading should be analyzed to determine the trend in
ratchetting behavior. Thus, all the inelastic analyses will
be for a minimum of ten loading cycles, except for the
three-dimensional analyses, where cost makes this

strain quantities, each of which must meet the respective strain
limit specified in Code Case 1592.

number totally impracticable. Hold periods will be 200
hr. '

Analytical results will in all cases include plots of -
selected stress-strain histories, strain accumulation vs
time, and creep and fatigue damage accumulation vs
time.

The material assumed for all analyses is type 304
stainless steel. Maximum temperatures are 1100°F, and
sodium downshocks are from 1100 to 800°F.

The five different types of elastic-plastic-creep ratch-
etting analyses are discussed separately below:

Type 1. Notched-cylindrical-shell analyses. The limi-
tation that the simplified ratchetting rules ‘cannot be
applied in regions containing local structural discontinu-
ities has been criticized by some as being overly
conservative. Because of the localized nature of a local
discontinuity, gross ratchetting will not be significantly
affected in such regions.

Shallow notches are representative of severe local
discontinuities. Thus, a notched-cylinder geometry has
been chosen to evaluate the effect of a local discontinu-
ity on ratchetting and to verify, if possible, the
conservative applicability of simplified ratchetting and
creep-fatigue rules and modeling procedures. Two prob-
lems, with variations in the notch geometry and/or the
loadings, are planned. By comparing the predicted
ratchetting in undisturbed regions of the shell with the
ratchetting strains across the shell at the notch location,
the effects of the localized notch can be assessed.

Although the notched cylindrical shell is geometri-
cally simple, it represents a sizable finite-element
problem because of the mesh refinement required to
represent adequately the notch region (see ref. 33 for a
description’ of a similar finite-element analysis). The
length of the cylinder modeled will be sufficient to
eliminate any interaction between the notch effects and
end discontinuities. |

The loading will consist of an internal pressure, an
axial 1oad (to magnify the notch effect), and a repeated
internal sodium thermal downshock followed by hold
periods. The loading magnitudes will be chosen so that
a moderate amount of ratchetting strain is predicted in
the undistrubed region of the cylinder by a one-
dimensional pipe-wall ratchetting analysis.*#

Notched Round Bar Subjected to Creep,” pp. 253-62 in

nology, Part I — Design and Analysis, American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, 1973.

34. In choosing loading conditions for all the inelastic
analyses, an attempt will be made to maximize the ratchetting
strains without getting into the R, or R, regions of the
Bree-type diagram (ref. 21).
Probably, the results of the inelastic analyses will
show that, even in the relatively severe case of a notch,
a local discontinuity has a negligible effect on ratchet-
ting. If the effect is not negligible, the aim will be to
develop the proper modeling procedures for using
elastic analysis results as input parameters to the
simplified rules to obtain conservative inelastic ratchet-
ting strain predictions.

Type 2. Cylindrical-shell analyses. The ratchetting
behavior at a given point in a general shell-type
structure is dependent not only on the conditions
through the wall at that location but also on the
behavior at other points. Adjacent sections which are
thicker or thinner, hotter or colder, etc., may drive the
ratchetting ‘strains at the point being considered to
higher values than conditions at the point would
indicate, or they may constrain the ratchetting to
smaller values than would be indicated. Likewise, the
elastic follow-up associated with mechanical and/or
thermally induced discontinuity stresses can affect
ratchetting. Of course, it is these structural interactions
that interfere with a straightforward application of the
simplified one-dimensional rules to complex structures
using only the conditions through the wall at the
location of interest.

Probably, with appropriate modeling rules, conditions
at adjacent sections can be covered by using elastic
analysis results. As an example of a special modeling
rule, Code Case 1592 states that in using the simplified
ratchetting rules, ‘“‘any stresses with elastic follow-up
(e.g., secondary stresses other than those caused by
radial temperature variations) should be included as
primary stresses for purposes of predicting ratchetting
strains unless otherwise justified.” This appears to be a
é(_)nservative requirement that might be adequate even
for general nonaxisymmetric situations. However, no
general experience with applying this procedure exists.

The axisymmetric cylinder problems are to help
delineate the effects of the individual factors, discussed
above, that affect ratchetting at a given point. Results
from this type of problem will provide a better
understanding and assessment of the results of the
prototypic nozzle-to-sphere and nozzle-to-cylinder
problems (types 3 and 4).

There are four different types of cylindrical shell
problems. The first, type 24, is a cylinder with a
localized step increase in wall thickness. This geometry
is intended to represent, in a very simple way, a
reinforced junction region. By properly choosing the
pressures p; and p,, pressure discontinuity stresses can
be included or eliminated. In one analysis, the transient
loading comes from repeated internal sodium thermal

20

downshocks. Because of the varying cooling rates in the
thick and thin sections, thermally induced discontinui-
ties occur during the transients. In another analysis, the
transients are produced by linear thermal gradients
pivoted about the midsurface. In this case, the ther-
mally induced discontinuity stresses other than those
caused by the radial temperature variation are elimi-
nated. Four problems of type 2a are planned.

In problem 2b there is no wall-thickness discontinu-
ity, but there is an abrupt change in the magnitude of
the linear through-the-wall temperature transient.?®
Thus the two halves of the cylinder will ratchet at
different rates, allowing a basic examination of the
driving or constraining effect of adjacent regions.

Problem 2c¢ is a uniform cylinder with a nonlinear
axial thermal gradient. In cases where the temperature
distribution tends to create high discontinuity stress, a
simplified ratchetting analysis may not apply.2® This
problem will examine this possibility.

Finally, problem 2d is a cylinder built in at one end.
Built-in cylinders have been repeatedly cited as an
example of elastic follow-up, and thus the problem is
included here to provide a test of both ratchetting and
creep-fatigue procedures under such conditions.

A study of problems of the built-in cylinder type is
expected to provide a clearer and more defensible
understanding of modeling rules to be used in applying
the simplified ratchetting procedures. The rules derived
from these problems will be applied to the prototypic
structures in problem types 3 and 4.

Type 3. Nozzle-to-spherical-shell analysis. The
nozzle-to-spherical-shell problem is an intermediate step
in identifying ways of conservatively applying simpli-
fied procedures to general structures. Here, a non-
axisymmetric load — a bending moment applied to the
nozzle — is applied to an axisymmetric shell-type
structure. Probably, the method of treating net bending
of a straight pipe that is given in RDT Standard F9-5
could just as well be applied to any axisymmetric
shell-type structure. In fact, Code Case 1592 states that
“nonaxisymmetric loads such as bending of a pipe or
vessel may . often be conservatively included as axisym-
metric loads and the present rules may be applied.”” The
nozzle-to-sphere analysis is intended to check this
premise.

To be realistic, the geometry to be analyzed is that of
the FFTF IHX inlet nozzle. The details of the junction
region are to be accurately modeled in the finite-

Table 1.7 simply indicates the assumption of zero axial heat
flow to be used in the thermal analyses.
element representation. In addition to the sustained
nozzle bending moment, the loading will consist of an

21

internal pressure and a repeated internal sodium ther-

mal downshock followed by hold periods. The magni-
tudes of the loads were chosen to produce moderate
ratchetting in the membrane regions of the nozzle.

This problem, even though in axisymmetric geometry,
will require a complex and costly three-dimensional
analysis. The inelastic ratchetting evaluations and the
inelastic creep-fatigue damage calculations will be car-
ried out across the thickness at various circumferential
positions around the shell and at discrete meridional
locations starting in the membrane region of the nozzle
and ending in the membrane region of the sphere.?®
Parameters from the elastic analyses will be required at
these same locations.

It is expected that the results of the nozzle-to-sphere
analysis, together with the results from the type 2
cylinder analysis, will demonstrate that the simplified
procedures can be conservatively applied to the case of
an axisymmetric vessel with nonaxisymmetric loading
and also will explain why the procedures are conserva-
tive.

Type 4. Nozzle-to-cylindrical-shell analyses. The pro-
totypic nozzle-to-cylindrical-shell problem is the final
step in the progressively more complex series. It
represents a general shell-type structure, but at the same
time it is a logical extension of the earlier problems in
the series.

The geometry will be that of the FFTF IHX inlet
nozzle, and in the transverse cross section of symmetry
(through the nozzle) the dimensions will be exactly the
same as for the nozzle-to-sphere problem. The loading
will be an out-of-plane bending moment applied to the
nozzle, an internal pressure, and a repeated internal
sodium thermal downshock followed by hold periods.
The magnitudes of the loads will be exactly the same as
those used for the nozzle-to-sphere analysis.

Of course, this problem is completely three-
dimensional. To reduce the problem size, symmetric
boundary conditions, representative of a membrane
region, will be taken at either end of the cylindrical
shell. In this way only half of the structure will need to
be considered. As in the case of the nozzle-to-sphere
attachment, the junction transition region and rein-
forcing will be realistically modeled. The nozzle will be

included in the finite-element model to ensure a region of
membrane behavior undisturbed by the junction region discon-
tinuities.

long enough for a well-defined membrane region to be
established. ' : :

Inelastic ratchetting and creep-fatigue damage evalua-
tions will be carried out through the thickness at points -
along lines defined by planes containing the axis of the
nozzle. The longitudinal plane of symmetry, the trans-
verse plane of symmetry, and at least one intermediate
plane will be examined. Parameters must be obtained
from the associated elastic analyses for each of the
locations examined.

Possibly the results of the nozzle-to-cylinder analysis
will provide the final demonstration of the applicability
of the simplified procedures.

Type 5. Infinite cylinder (one-dimensional pipe-
ratchetting) analyses. The inelastic pipe-ratchetting
analyses will be used in a number of ways throughout
this study. First, pipe-ratchetting calculations will estab-
lish the suitability of the loading magnitudes chosen for
each inelastic analysis problem. _ -

Second, a number of analyses will establish lines of
constant ratchet strain for each cycle of loading (hold
time = 200 hr) on a Miller- or Bree-type diagram.
Although previous ORNL studies have shown that a
given point on the Bree-type diagram (characterized by
the maximum values of P and Q during the cycle) does
not have a completely unique value of accumulated
strain associated with it,37 these Bree-type plots will be
used in making first-pass correlations and comparisons.

Third, critical regions identified by the elastic analy-
ses associated with each problem will be examined by
one-dimensional pipe-ratchetting calculations that are
tailored .specifically to the conditions at that point by
various potential modeling procedures. The correct
parameters to be modeled, and the method of model-
ing, will be identified by comparing these final one-
dimensional analyses with the inelastic results at the
critical locations in each problem.

1.3.2 Inelastic Analyses of MSR Piping Subjected to
Internal Pressure and Transient Temperature Cycles

A series of four or five detailed inelastic analyses will
be done to examine the severity of the thermal
ratchetting and creep-fatigue damage that will be
encountered in the MSBR. The analyses will all be done
on axisymmetrically loaded pipes subjected to internal
pressure and transient radial temperature distributions.

37. Reference 24 illustrated that the accumulated strain for a
given P, and .. depends on the wall thickness and on the
loading cycle.
The temperature and pressure histories as well as the
pipe sizes will be typical of those expected in an MSBR.
The temperature dependence of the instantaneous
coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity,
heat capacity, and heat transfer coefficient as well as as
the mechanical properties of the Hastelloy N will be
taken into account. The two-dimensional elastic-

22

plastic-creep finite-element -program (PLACRE) will be
used to perform these analyses. The results of these
analyses will allow an assessment of the applicability of
the simplified methods study described in the preceding
section to Hastelloy N. Also, these results will help
define the magnitude of the high-temperature design
problem in an MSBR.

2.1 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
INDUSTRIAL PROGRAM

J. L. Crowley

Task I of the Molten-Salt Steam Generator Design
Study has been completed by the Foster Wheeler Cor-
poration under subcontract to ORNL and a design re-
port summarizing the work was issued.! In this study a
steam generator was designed to operate in the ORNL
1000-MW(e) reference-design®> MSBR. The supercritical
steam cycle employed in this design requires that feed-
water be supplied to the steam generator at supercritical
pressure and 700°F with full-load outlet conditions of
3600 psia and 1000°F. The Foster Wheeler Corporation

" chose an L-shaped tube-and-shell heat exchanger with a
thermal capacity of 483 MW to be operated as a single
unit per coolant circuit. (The MSBR reference design
incorporates four coolant loops with NaBF,-NaF as the
intermediate coolant and with both steam-generating
and steam-reheat exchangers in each circuit.)

The design uses an all-welded construction with 100%
radiography of all pressure-boundary welds. The pres-
sure shell is designed to minimize salt volume, and,

where the shell must be of a larger diameter than the

tube bundle, a flow shroud maintains the flow velocity
over the bundle. Individual tubes are connected to the
tube sheet with an internal bore-welding process which
provides a full-penetration weld that can be completely
radiographed.

An axial salt flow was used in the hydraulic design
after several attempts at using the more efficient cross-
flow pattern failed to meet the conflicting design re-
quirements for tube vibration and pressure drop. How-
ever, this compromise is not so significant in this unit,
because the thick tube wall necessary for supercritical
pressure becomes a dominant resistance to heat transfer
in the overall thermal performance. Some of the basic
design parameters are listed in Table 2.1

The Design Report includes extensive thermal-
hydraulic analyses that cover important steam-generator
characteristics during startup and part-load perfor-
mance, as well as investigations of dynamic and static

The status of Hastelloy-to-steam corrosion was inves-
tigated thoroughly and is reported with extensive refer-
ences in the design report.! The Foster Wheeler Corpo-
ration provided a summary of its literature survey and
included recommendations for additional investigations.

Considerable structural analysis demonstrated the fea-
sibility of the design. Major components of the steam
generator were given an elastic analysis, and simplified
inelastic analyses were conducted on highly stressed
members such as the salt-inlet nozzle, the outlet tube
sheet, the shell, and the tubes. Outline versions of a
manufacturing plan and maintenance procedures are
included in the design report.!

2.2 GAS-SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY FACILITY

R. H. Guymon W. R. Huntley

2.2.1 General

Construction of the Gas-Systems Technology Facility
(GSTF) was carried to a point that permitted water
operation, and the first phase of the water runs was
completed during this period. '

After the salt-pump rotary assembly was refurbished
(Sect. 2.2.2), it was installed along with the drive motor
and the auxiliary lines and was supplied with the neces-
sary electrical power. Since the instrument panels and
other miscellaneous jobs had already been installed,
checkout of the system was started. As is usual in com-
plex systems, several leaks were found and repaired, and
difficulties with some equipment and instrumentation
had to be resolved. ' , _

The loop was filled with distilled water, and circula-
tion was started on February 10, 1975. Since the pur-
poses of the first tests were to check salt-pump shaft
deflection and to obtain other data on pump character-
istics, the loop-bypass line was blanked, and the entire
flow was directed through the main loop, which con-
tains a venturi flowmeter and a variable flow restrictor.
" The salt pump was operated at speeds of 800 to 1790
rpm and at flow rates up to 840 gpm with various set-
tings of the variable flow restrictor. The information
obtained indicates that the 11%-in.-diam impeller pre-
sently in the system will provide the design conditions
of 100-ft head at 1000 gpm. The power data show that
the.- 75-hp drive motor will have to be overloaded to
about 125 hp to provide GSTF design conditions with
fuel salt. Motor design and performance data indicate
that the motor probably can be operated with this large
overload. Thermocouples have been located on the
motor windings to measure the heating effects of the
proposed overload condition.

2.2.2 Mark II Pump

‘The critical frequency of the Mark II pump rotary

assembly was investigated to ensure that the pump
would operate satisfactorily at proposed rotational
speeds up to 1790 rpm. The assembly was mounted in a
cold shakedown test stand and vibrated to evaluate the
critical frequency. An MSRE coolant-pump impeller
weighing 29.4 1b was mounted on the shaft for these
tests, since this type of impeller is needed to meet
GSTF flow conditions. The critical frequency occurred
at 38 cps, which is equivalent to a rotational speed of
2280 rpm (Fig. 2.1). The maximum GSTF pump speed
will be 1790 rpm, when the pump is operated with no
fluid in ‘the pump bowl, so the pump should be satisfac-
tory for the intended service. For comparison, the vi-
bration testing was repeated using an MSRE fuel-pump
impeller weighing 39 Ib. The critical frequency was
lowered, as expected, and occurred at an equivalent
speed of 2040 rpm with the heavier impeller. Similarily,
a test run without an impeller on the shaft raised the
critical speed to more than 3000 rpm.
- After vibration testing was completed, the pump
rotary assembly was disassembled to replace the ball
bearings and mechanical face seals. Although the Mark
Il pump had previously been operated more than
16,000 hr in a test loop in Building 9201-3, the bearings
and seals showed normal but not excessive wear.

assembly.

Shaft scoring (about Y% in. deep) was found in the
narrow annulus of the shield plug when the Mark II
rotary assembly was disassembled. The shaft scoring

. must have been caused by accumulations of frozen salt

mist from within the pump tank. Previous progress
reports showed that plugging of the pump-shaft annulus
had occurred at least nine times and was troublesome
during the previous operation. Similar problems are not
expected in the GSTF, since the salt spray ring within
the pump bowl will no longer be in use. The pump shaft
was not seriously damaged by the scoring action and
was reused as is; no damage was found on the stationary
annulus wall within the shield plug. Record photo-
graphs of the scored shaft and shield plug were made.
This shaft scoring, due to mist accumulation and
freezing, must be considered if future molten-salt
development returns to the use of a spray ring within
the pump bowl.

The cleaning facilities in Building 9419-1 were reacti-
vated after salt deposits were found within the Mark II
pump. The fuel-salt deposits were removed by use of a
6% oxalic acid solution that was heated to about 94°C.
Soaking periods of from 24 to 48 hr were required to
remove the salt deposits. After the cleaning, beryllium
and alpha contamination were found to be within
acceptable limits. :

Attempts to dynamically balance the Mark II pump
shaft-impeller subassembly in the UCCND shops were
unsuccessful, because the large overhang of the impeller
prevented satisfactory shaft rotation on its two bearing
surfaces while mounted horizontally in the balancing
machine. Therefore, a portable balancing system was
used which permits dynamic balancing of the pump
rotary assembly as the shaft rotates vertically in the
cold shakedown test stand. The pump shaft, with new
bearings and relapped seals, was balanced at 1500 rpm
and was operated satisfactorily above 1790 rpm imme-
diately after the balancing. However, the pump shaft
repeatedly went out of balance and vibrated excessively
after operating sufficiently long for the bearing housing
to approach its normal operating temperature in the
cold shakedown test of about 110°F. The excessive
vibration was found to be caused by an interference fit
between the bearing-housing bore and the outer races of
the lower pair of bearings. The interference fit pre-
vented axial movement of the lower bearings as the
bearing-housing temperature increased to the normal
operation temperature. Although small, the tempera-
ture rise created differential thermal expansions and
shaft bending of a few thousandths of an inch, which in
turn led to large dynamic imbalances at the desired
operating speed. The bearing-housing bore was in-
creased by 0.003 in. to a diameter of 6.694 in., which
corrected the problem.

The pump was reassembled and operated satisfac-
torily at 1775 rpm for a period of five days in the cold
shakedown test stand. During cold shakedown testing
the oil-seal leakage rates were also found to be accept-
able with no measurable leakage from the lower seal
and about 10-cc/day leakage at the upper seal. After
cold shakedown testing was completed, two eddy-
current probes were installed and were calibrated for
future use in measuring pump-shaft deflection during
water testing. The Mark II rotary assembly and drive
motor were installed in the GSTF on January 7, 1975,
for initial water testing.

When the pump rotary assembly was removed from
the pump bowl on February 20, after the initial water
tests, scoring of the outer diameter of the impeller inlet
hub was present. This scoring occurred as a result of
shaft deflection, which exceeded the 0.034-in. radial
clearance in this region. No significant damage occurred
from the rubbing of the impeller against the stationary
labyrinth surface at the pump inlet. Based on the infor-
mation from the shaft deflection probes, the clearances
were increased to the following values:

0.066 in. radial
0.072 in. radial
0.082 in. radial

Upper labyrinth
Lower labyrinth
Impeller hub

To allow for the additional fountain flow created by
the larger clearances, eighteen % 4-in.-diam holes were
added which lead from the labyrinth-fountain region to
the pump tank.

2.2.3 Densitometer

To evaluate the efficiency with which circulating bub-
bles are removed from water or salt in the loop by the
bubble separator, the void fraction downstream of the
bubble separator must be measured. A project decision
had been made in 1972 to employ an existing densitom-
eter for this purpose. The densitometer had been used
in 1965 at the MSRE and consisted of a 30-Ci '37Cs
source located in a collimated shield on one side of the
5-in. pipe and a shielded scintillation detector on the
other side of the pipe. The detector and associated elec-
tronics were restored to operational condition, and tests
that simulated the intended operating mode were made
in the Instrumentation and Controls Division. It soon
became apparent that signal noise and drift were very
high compared with the small change in signal expected
from changes in void fraction. Subsequent upgrading of
the electronic components has produced only limited
improvements.®> Data from the simulation tests in-
dicate that the error in measured void fraction (with
water in the loop) would amount to an error of
about *5% in the calculated bubble separator effi-
ciency with a helium input flow rate equivalent to
1% void fraction at the core centerline. This error
would increase as the helium flow rate is decreased
and would be about *25% at .rates equivalent to
0.2% void fraction at the core centerline. During salt
operation, these errors would be reduced in propor-
tion to the densities and would be about *1.5% and
8% respectively.

Some improvement could possibly be obtained by
periodically interrupting the gas flow to check the zero
output of the detector and by inserting shims to cali-
brate the detector span. Another possibility is to inter-
mittently impose a constant gamma flux directly on the
detector to provide calibration data.

2.3 COOLANT-SALT TECHNOLOGY FACILITY
A. N. Smith |

During this report period, the recommissioning of the
CSTF was completed, some equipment modifications
were made, and the shakedown of the system was con-
tinued.

The system had been held under a static inert-cover-
gas pressure since the shutdown in January 1973. In
September 1974, the cover gas contained 58 pCi of

tritium per standard cubic centimeter of gas.* The trit-
ium is assumed to have been present in the walls of the
piping during operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment (MSRE), was transferred with the portions
of the MSRE piping used in construction of the CSTF,
and then was diffused from the pipe wails into the salt
when operation of the CSTF was initiated. '

A design change was made to eliminate cavitation at
the throat of the load orifice. The change consisted in
adding a new 2.466-in.-diam orifice about 2 ft upstream
of the existing orifice and enlarging the existing orifice
diameter from 2.400 to 3.270 in. The calculated pres-
sure profiles for the old and the new orifice arrange-
ments are given in the previous report.® When the
system was opened to make the orifice modifications,
the missing material-surveillance specimen® was found
lodged against the upstream side of the old orifice, as
expected.

Work was completed on the checkout of instruments
and of flow and pressure controls, and a new set of
material-surveillance specimens was installed. The loop
was filled with the MSBR secondary coolant (sodium
fluoroborate) on December 19, 1974. Salt circulation
was started but was terminated after 1'% hr because of
instrument trouble. On January 14, 1975, salt circula-
tion was again initiated and was continued until
January 24, 1975, when the system was shut down
because of a flow restriction in the off-gas line. During
this 240-hr operating period, the following measure-
ments and observations were made:

1. Cavitation measurements were run at various salt
temperatures and pump speeds to check the effec-
tiveness of the modified load orifice installation. The
results indicate that, for pump bowl overpressures of
10 psig and higher, the CSTF can be operated at
maximum conditions of temperature (1150°F) and
pump speed (1790 rpm) without significant load
orifice cavitation. Operation at these conditions by
use of the old orifice resulted in violent cavitation.’

2. Measurements were made of the salt level in the salt
cold trap at various flow rates to determine whether
the high-salt-level problem® had been resolved. It
was found that at maximum flow the gas deflector

" was submerged about Y% in., so that the off-gas

stream, upon entering the salt cold trap, bubbled
through a column of salt. This bubbling action is
undesirable, because it might increase the salt mist in
the off-gas. '

3. Periodic measurements were made of the salt flow
through the salt-cold-trap circuit by use of the flow
calorimeter that is an integral part of the salt-flow
circuit. The salt flow appeared to remain fairly
steady at the design flow rate (about 0.2 gpm) for
the first seven days. On the eighth day, the flow
dropped to about 0.1 gpm and on the ninth day to
about 0.02 gpm, indicating the development of a
severe flow restriction.

. The off-gas stream (1.9 liters/min STP) was passed
through a Dry-Ice—alcohol (—70°F) cold trap.
About 2 drops of fluid were collected during the
240-hr period. Although actual data are not avail-
able, if certain assumptions are made, an estimate
may be made for the average concentration of con-
densable material in the off-gas stream. Thus, assum-
ing 10 drops/cm?, a condensate density of 1 g/cm?,
and a cold-trap efficiency of 100%, the average con-
centration of condensables in the off-gas stream is
calculated to be about 7 ug/cm?. The rate at which
the condensable material is being removed from the
salt is decreasing with time as shown by the follow-
ing comparison of the current operating period with
the two previous operating periods:

After shutdown of the operation, an analysis of the
condensate for tritium® showed that the concentration
was equivalent of 4400 uCi/g. By comparison, the trit-
ium analysis of salt samples taken from the pump bowl
showed an activity of 0.014 uCi/g, so that the tritium
content of the condensate is higher than that of the salt
by a factor of at least 10°. One possible explanation for
this result is that the tritium which was in the walls of
the loop piping (as a result of the operation of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment) has been transferred
to the salt by isotopic exchange with a hydrogenous
impurity in the salt and that the impurity, now trit-
iated, is carried out with the off-gas stream and con-
densed in the cold trap.

9. See Section 5.1 this report (Leon Maya)
After shutdown the system was cooled to room tem-
perature and flooded with argon. The material-
surveillance specimen holder was removed from the
loop, and, as in the case of the previous operating
period, the upper specimen was missing and is presum-
ably lodged somewhere inside the loop piping. The re-
maining two specimens had the shiny, etched appear-
ance typical for high-temperature service with fluoro-
borate salt.!® Both the off-gas system and the salt-
cold-trap salt-flow circuit were examined to determine
the causes for the flow restrictions. The following is a
summary of the findings and the remedial actions that
were taken:

The top flange and integral cold finger were removed
from the salt cold trap. The interior surfaces at and near
the top of the trap were uniformly coated with a white
solid (Fig. 2.2) that was subsequently found to be
NaBF,. The ¥ ¢-in.-ID off-gas line leading from the
trap was completely plugged with the same material.
The plug was located at the trap outlet and was only
about Yin. long. The gas line downstream of the plug
was relatively free of deposit. Apparently, the flow re-
striction was caused by an accumulation of salt particles
that resulted from the freezing of salt-mist droplets
which were present in the off-gas stream, so the phe-
nomenon was the same as had been observed previously
duringtest-work on a similar system! 1. Probably, the salt
mist is caused by mechanical agitation of the salt in the
pump bowl, by effervescence at the salt-gas interfaces
due to the release of BF; bubbles, or by a combination
of the two mechanisms. Mist droplets small enough to
remain gas-borne are carried along with the gas until a

27

point is reached where the temperature drops below the -

freezing point of the salt; at this point the droplets
freeze and stick to nearby surfaces. In the CSTF the
upper part of the salt cold trap is the first point in the
off-gas line where the temperature drops below the salt
freezing point. To prevent future gas-line plugs, a filter
was installed in the upper part of the salt cold trap so
that the cooled gas is filtered before passing into the
exit line. The filter medium is stainless steel Huyck
Feltmetal, type FM-225, with an effective surface area
of 30 sq. in. As a backup measure in the event the filter
does not prove effective, a cleanout plug was installed
just downstream of the salt cold trap so that flow re-
strictions can be rodded out with a minimum of down-
time.

culation in an MSRE Scale Facility, ORNL-TM-3344 (Septem-
ber 1972), p. 54.

The salt-cold-trap salt-inlet line was cut open to check
for a restriction at the 0.104-in.-diam flow orifice since
a restriction had occurred at this point during a previ-
ous operating period,’? but this time the flow orifice
was completely unrestricted. The salt filter just up-
stream of the flow orifice was then cut open, and the
nickel wire-mesh filter element was found clogged with
a dark-gray magnetic material in which the major metal-
lic constituent was determined by mass spectrography
to be nickel. A gas-flow test was made through the
remainder of the salt-flow circuit, and no significant
flow restriction was observed. Probably the flow restric-
tion was caused by the accumulation of material in the
salt filter. The material probably results from corrosion
of the Hastelloy N surfaces followed by reduction of
the nickel to the elemental form, although it is possible
that some of the material might be due to self-corrosion
of the filter material. The nickel is insoluble in the salt
and circulates with the salt as a slurry or scum unless
separated out by some mechanism such as filtering. It
was decided that the design of the salt-cold-trap salt-
flow circuit would be revised to provide an arrangement
capable of operating under stable flow conditions. Since
the cold-trap salt-flow circuit is not an essential part of
the planned deuterium trapping test, the salt-flow lines
were disconnected from the pump suction line and
from the salt cold trap, and the loop side openings were
capped off. After this change, there will no longer be a
salt flow through the salt cold trap, but it will still serve
as part of the off-gas piping arrangement.

During the report period, work was continued on
plans for the deuterium test.'® A draft of the test plan
was issued for comment, and fabrication of the deute-
rium injection assembly was completed. Near the end of
the report period, a status review was made, and it was
concluded that the analytical equipment and techniques
needed for the determination of deuterium in the salt
and in the off-gas stream, at the anticipated concentra-
tion levels,'* will not be available in the required time.
It was further concluded that the test can be done using
tritium as the test gas because tritium, at the expected
concentration levels, can be readily measured by estab-
lished radiation counting and isotopic ratio techniques.
Therefore, work is currently under way to determine
and effect those changes in design and procedure which

rium test to a tritium test.

At the close of the report period, the CSTF was still
shut down for the purpose of effecting the previously
discussed changes to the off-gas system and the salt-
cold-trap flow circuit.

2.4 FORCED-CONVECTION LOOPS
W. R. Huntley M. D. Silverman

The Forced-Convection Corrosion-Loop Program is

part of the effort to develop a satisfactory structural
alloy for molten-salt reactors. Corrosion loop
MSR-FCL-2b is presently operating with reference fuel
salt at typical MSBR velocities and temperature gra-
dients in a study to evaluate the corrosion and mass
transfer of standard Hastelloy N. Tellurium injections
into MSR-FCL-2b are planned after baseline corrosion
data are obtained in the absence of tellurium. At this
time, the loop has operated approximately 800 hr at
design AT conditions with the expected low corrosion
rates.

Two additional corrosion-loop facilities, designated
MSR-FCL-3 and MSR-FCL4, have been authorized and
are in the early stages of construction. They are being
fabricated of a modified Hastelloy N alloy containing
2% titanium, which is expected to be more resistant to
tellurium attack than standard Hastelloy N. Like
FCL-2b, each of the new forced-convection loops will
be constructed of '%-in-OD, 0.042-in.-wall tubing and
will contain three easily removable corrosion-test speci-
men assemblies exposed to circulating salt at three dif-
ferent temperatures.

2.4.1 Operation of MSR-FCL-2b

Corrosion loop MSR-FCL-2b continued to operate’®
with LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF; (68-20-11.7-0.3 mole %)
until October 1974, at which time the test was halted
to replace the salt. The test had been run from April to
October 1974 primarily to evaluate an electrochemical
probe for on-line monitoring of salt chemistry; the loop
operated isothermally most of this time. During the
latter part of the test run, three additions of powdered
NiF, were made to the salt in the loop. The NiF, was
added by lowering the powdered material below the salt
surface within the auxiliary tank using the salt sampling
apparatus, which consists of a removable air lock with

15. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. .Rep. Aug. 31, 1974,
ORNL-5011, pp. 14.

29

ball valves and a hydrogen-fired copper bucket. The
nickel fluoride powder was placed in the prefired
bucket within a dry box and protected from atmos-
pheric contamination until inserted into the loop.

The expected effects on the oxidation potential were
noted by Analytical Chemistry personnel with the elec-
trochemical probe as detailed in Part II of this report.
However,'pump-drive-motor power increases of 10 to
25% were noted after each of the three small NiF,
additions (1 to 1.6 g to the 14,000-g salt inventory).
The third and final NiF, addition of 1.6 g was made
specifically to confirm the two previous indications of
drive-motor power change. Power input to the motor
was 3.75 kW prior to the NiF, addition with the salt
circulating isothermally at 663°C at a pump speed of
4020 rpm. The pump was stopped for 3 hr during the
NiF, addition, and when these conditions were
restored, the motor power was 25% higher (4.6 kW).
The motor power decreased gradually, as had been the
case with the previous NiF, additions, until it had
reached 4.3 kW after three days. The loop was operated
with a 50-kW input to heater No. 2 to compare heat-
transfer data with similar data taken just before the
third NiF, addition. No changes in apparent salt
density due to possible outgassing or changes in
viscosity could be inferred from the two sets of heat-
transfer data, so the cause of the motor-power changes
is as yet unexplained. No sharp changes in pumping
power were noted during many previous pump stop-
pages for electrochemical readings or for beryllium
additions, but step increases were noted after each of
the NiF, additions.

Shortly after the NiF, additions were completed, the
pump was disassembled to replace a defective static
O-ring seal. This provided an opportunity to search for
defective bearings and mechanical seals, salt deposits, or
shaft rubbing which might explain the power-
requirement increases. Close examination showed that
the bearings and seals were in good condition after
4000 hr of operation, and no salt or metal deposits
were found in the pump shaft annulus that would ex-
plain the increased pump-power requirements.

Nineteen salt samples were taken from the auxiliary
tank from April to October 1974 to monitor the salt
composition; no significant variations in the major salt
constituents were noted over this period. The last four
of the nineteen samples were taken while NiF, was
being added to the loop, and increased metallic
impurity levels were observed in the salt. Chromium
increased from an average level of 100 ppm before addi-
tion of NiF, to about 150 ppm after the additions. Iron
content increased from about 55 to 90 ppm. Nickel
content ranged from 20 to 35 ppm before the NiF,
additions and from 38 to 60 ppm afterward. The
oxygen concentrations in the salt ranged from 40 to 80
ppm during the NiF, additions.

An oil leak occurred in the ALPHA pump on
November 1, 1974, which resulted in about 200 cc of
Gulfspin-35 oil draining into the empty salt-piping
system. The pump and piping had just been drained and
cooled to room temperature, in preparation for chang-
ing the salt charge,'® when the oil leak occurred, so the
oil was not carbonized within the piping system. The
pump was removed from the pump bowl, and disas-
sembly revealed that the failure of a hardened, inelastic
Viton O-ring in the lower oil seal assembly caused the
oil leak. Probably this static O-ring seal overheated and
hardened during 4000 hr of operation, pumping salt at
temperatures up to 700°C. Also, a review of the loop
log book showed that the oil flow was interrupted for
several hours while hot salt remained in the pump bowl
during in-situ pump repair operations in July 1974, and
it is possible that O-ring damage occurred at that time.
The oil leak occurred just after the pump bowl was
heated twice from room temperature to 650°C to
promote complete salt drainage. Differential expansion
and contraction during this thermal cycling apparently
caused the oil to leak past the hardened O-ring. The
pump was reassembled with new Viton seals and reused
without design modification. To reduce the probability
of future O-ring failures, no in-situ pump repairs will be
made when the pump bowl is at elevated temperatures.
The salt in the pump bowl will also be at a lower tem-
perature (about 565°C) during most of the future
operation.

The corrosion specimens had been removed from
MSR-FCL-2b for examination before the oil leak occur-
red. These specimens had been exposed to the fuel salt
for a total of 4224 hr, of which 3682 hr was in iso-
thermal operation, 100 hr with a typical MSBR thermal
gradient, and 442 hr with the salt not flowing. Corro-
sion and mass-transfer rates were apparently increased
by the NiF, additions to the salt but were still low
overall (Part III).

A thorough loop cleaning was required because of the
leakage of pump oil into the piping system. All three
drain lines were cut to aid in oil removal. The piping
system was flushed by filling and draining three times

16. Salt with the reference composition, LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %), was unavailable when the
MSR Program was reactivated, and this shutdown was scheduled
to permit the change to the reference material, which had just
been produced.

30

with perchloroethylene and twice with denatured ethyl
alcohol. The oil content of each flush charge was
checked by chemical analysis to confirm effective oil
removal. After flushing operations were completed, the
piping system was dried by flowing helium and then
evacuated and heated to about 150°C to outgas metal
surfaces and any remaining salt droplets within the
piping system. The cut drain lines were then rewelded
in place. :

The ALPHA pump rotary element was reassembled
and operated successfully in the cold shakedown test
stand to check out new bearings and oil seals and was
then reinstalled in the pump bowl of the loop. All re-
pairs to the piping system and routine maintenance of
instruments were completed by January 14, 1975, and
preheating operations were started. A flush charge of
MSBR reference fuel salt was circulated isothermally at
a pump speed of 2000 rpm for 48 hr at 593°C to clean
the piping system of residual salt from the previous salt
charge and also to remove any oil or atmospheric con-
taminants from the oil leak. The corrosion specimens
were not installed during this flushing operation. Salt
samples were taken before and after circulation of the
flush charge, and analyses for carbon and sulfur con-
firmed that essentially all traces of oil had been
removed by the perchloroethylene. The flush salt was
removed from the loop and discarded, and a new charge
of fuel salt was placed in the drain tank.

New standard Hastelloy N corrosion specimens were
installed, and the piping system was filled with fuel salt
on February 3, 1975. The system was operated isother-
mally at about 650°C for 166 hr as the pump speed was
gradually raised to its normal operating value of 4000
rpm. A rather rapid decrease in the U**/U* ratio, from
approximately 7 X 10 to approximately 4 X 10%, was
indicated by the electrochemical probe during this
period, but the ratio has since leveled at approximately
2 X 10%. Operation with a typical MSBR bulk-fluid
thermal gradient was started on February 10, 1975. The
first examination of the new corrosion specimens was
made after 494 hr operation under thermal gradient
conditions with the specimens exposed to salt velocities
of 8 and 16 fps; the corrosion rates were very low, less
than 0.1 mil/year (Section 7.7.3).

Oil leakage from the mechanical ocil seals of the
ALPHA pump has been higher since operation was
resumed in February 1975 than in the past. Oil leakage
from the lower pump seal gradually increased to 25
cc/day, and the upper seal leakage rose to 50 cc/day
during the first week of pump operation. However, the
leakage did not increase further during the next four
weeks, so the pump operation appears trouble free.
2.4.2 MSR FCL-3 and FCL-4

A request for $300,000 was granted by AEC for
FCL-3 in November 1974, and $260,000 was granted
for FCL-4 by ERDA in February 1975. Since these two
loops are similar, the design, fabrication, and construc-
tion will be done concurrently to the extent possible to
reduce costs. The expected completion date is January
1, 1976, for FCL-3 and March 31 for FCL4. The over-
all design of FCL-3 is approximately 75% complete.
Mechanical and instrumentation design should be com-
pleted by the end of April 1975. Electrical design
should be completed by the end of May.

Construction drawings have been issued for the
ALPHA pumps, auxiliary pump tanks, metallurgical
sample stations, cooler housings, coolers, ventilation
ducts, and structural support frames. The fill and drain
tank for FCL-3 has been completed. Fabrication of the
instrument panels for FCL-3 is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of May 1975. The longest procure-
ment lead-time item for both loops is the pump motors.
Delivery has been promised for September 1975.

31

Equipment previously used in other development pro-
grams has been removed to make room for FCL-3 and
FCL4. Layout drawings have been completed for
equipment placement on the track floor. Two variable-
speed motor-generator sets previously used in another
program have been refurbished and will be installed to
supply power to the pump motors for the new loops.

Plate and forgings of titanium-modified Hastelloy N
were received in February for use in fabrication of parts
for the two loops. Edge and surface cracking on the
forgings required their machining and testing to ensure
suitability of the material. Bar stock arrived in March;
however, weld-wire delivery is behind schedule, and
tubing will not be available before May 15, 1975. The

- delay of these deliveries will cause some delay in the

fabrication of components.

A compendium of work orders, purchase requisitions,
vendors, and costs for the major items ordered for
FCL-2 has been made in order to ascertain any poten-
tial fabrication and procurement problems for FCL-3
and FCL-4.

3. Safety Studies
J. R. Engel

3.1 SALT-SPILL ACCIDENTS
J.R.Engel E.S. Bettis

Preliminary studies of MSBR safety indicated that the
events with the greatest potential for safety-significant
consequences are those which involve salt spills within
the primary containment. As a result, the work during
this period was directed primarily toward events of this
kind. These studies indicated that the consequences of
such an accident do not pose a threat to the integrity of
the primary containment and, also, that only very
unlikely events, or combinations of events, will lead to
salt spills. While the immediate risk! associated with
salt spills is limited by the probability of their occur-
rence and by the containment systems, these events
share with some others a potential for delayed safety
significance when (and if) remote operations are under-
taken to recover from the accident or to decommission
the plant.

3.1.1 Potential Causes

Although the direct consequences of salt spills are
tolerable, any such spill would require an extended
plant shutdown and substantial maintenance activity,
either for recovery or, at worst, decommissioning of the
plant. Therefore, the frequency with which spills might
occur is an important consideration in determing the
overall risk associated with MSBR systems. Several
conceivable accident sequences were examined to
determine their potential for causing a break of the
primary coolant pressure boundary (PCPB).

Primary failure in piping. Although they are not acci-
dent sequences in the normal sense, primary failures in
the system piping must be considered as events that
could lead directly to salt spills. Such failures could
conceivably result from inadequate quality assurance
during design, construction, or operation of the plant
that would allow conditions to arise for which the plant
was not designed. If it is presumed that adequate
quality assurance is practiced and that appropriately
conservative design procedures are employed, the prob-
ability of a primary failure should be extremely low.

1. Risk, in this context, is used to imply an appropriate com-
bination of consequences and probability of occurrence. Thus, a
high-consequence event may involve low risk if its occurrence is
sufficiently unlikely.

Pressure excursions. Pressure excursions of sufficient
magnitude to breach the PCPB and cause a salt spill
could, in principle, be produced by a variety of event
sequences. Those of primary interest in an MSBR
system are (1) neutronic excursions, (2) primary heat-
exchanger failures, and (3) steam-tube failures.

Positive neutronic transients may cause temperature
as well as pressure excursions, but in an MSBR only the
most severe transients will cause pressure excursions of
sufficient magnitude to be of direct interest. Prelimi-
nary analyses of a variety of neutronic events indicated
that none of the commonly considered transients would
lead to significant pressure rises. Included in this cate-
gory are control-rod malfunctions, externally produced
fuel-salt temperature and flow perturbations, salt-
composition perturbations that might result from pro-
cessing plant malfunctions or partial salt freezing, and
perturbations in the circulating bubble fraction. In
principle, uniformly distributed voiding of salt from the
core region could lead to a major neutronic transient,
but no mechanisms are known for producing such void-
ing.

The only process by which a neutronically induced
pressure transient of sufficient magnitude to threaten
the PCPB could be produced is a return to the core of a
“cloud” of uranium that had been previously separated
from the salt and held up in a region of low nuclear
importance. A theoretical mechanism for such hideout
exists in the form of UO, precipitation if the fuel salt
becomes sufficiently contaminated with oxygen. How-
ever, the solubility of oxides in the salt appears to be
high enough, and the rate at which oxygen (either ele-
mental or combined) could be added in normal opera-
tion is low enough, that ample time (of the order of
weeks) would be available to identify and correct the
developing condition before any precipitation could
occur. On this basis, neutronically induced pressure

‘excursions do not appear to constitute a significant

mechanism for breaching the PCPB.

Failures within a primary heat exchanger which lead
to intermixing of the fuel and coolant salts are, in a
sense, breaches of the PCPB in that they cause radio-
active contamination of a system that would otherwise
be only mildly radioactive. However, such failures
would not release salt to the primary containment. If,
on the other hand, gases were released as a consequence
of salt mixing, pressures could be generated that might
cause other failures of the PCPB. The mechanisms for
releasing BF; on mixing MSBR fuel salt with the
NaBF4-NaF coolant are not yet sufficiently well
defined to permit any conclusions regarding the safety
significance of such events.

Since the steam system of an MSBR plant could
operate at very high pressure (approximately 3500
psig), steam-tube ruptures could impose severe pressure
transients on the rest of the plant. Such failures are to
be expected; so the plant must be designed to accom-
modate them without serious consequences. In the
MSBR reference design, rupture disks are provided in
the secondary salt system at both ends of the steam
generator to limit the pressure transients. The presence
of these devices eliminates steam-tube ruptures as a
mechanism for breaching for PCPB.

Temperature excursions. Since the estimated boiling
temperature of MSBR fuel salt — 1525°C at 1 atm — is
above the melting point of the Hastelloy N structural
material, - it is conceivable that extreme temperature
excursions in the primary system could lead directly to
failures of the PCPB. Such temperature excursions
could result either from nuclear transients or from
fission product afterheat if the provisions for afterheat
removal fail.

The nuclear transients that were examined to evaluate
temperature effects are the same as those discussed
cearlier in connection with pressure excursions. None of
the events, with the possible exception of the return of
precipitated uranium, produced excessive salt tempera-
tures, provided that salt circulation and heat removal
were maintained. The temperatures also remained
within reasonable limits in the absence of negative-
reactivity insertion to limit the initial transients. (These
results imply that a fast-acting safety scram system may
not be absolutely essential for an MSBR.) These studies
show that the temperatures associated with neutronic
transients do not represent a significant threat to the

PCPB.

Since the fuel salt in an MSBR is also the primary

core coolant, a possibility for attaining unacceptably
high temperatures could be associated with interruption
of the fuel-salt flow. Two general types of events were
considered in this context: interruption of flow through
a limited number of core fuel passages, such as might
result from the appearance of an obstruction at the
inlet(s) of the passage(s), and total interruption of all
core flow by events that reduce the performance of all
four primary-salt circulation pumps.

Blockage of one (or a few) fuel passages in an MSR
core might reasonably be expected to occur at some
time during the life of any given reactor. The most
likely cause would be the appearance of a foreign object

33

at the passage inlet(s), and the most significant conse-
quences would result from complete blockage of pass-
ages in the region of the maximum core power density.
The maximum salt temperature in a single blocked pass-
age at the maximum power density would tend to
approach 1730°C if a steady state could be achieved.
However, since this temperature is above the boiling
temperature of the salt, the rise would be checked by
the onset of boiling in the affected passage(s).

The first effect of a flow blockage would be a temper-
ature rise in the salt at about 120°C/sec in the
maximum-power-density passage. However, the MSBR
core design and the nuclear reactivity effect of the rise
are such that it probably would be undetectable. Then,
about 8 sec after occurrence of the blockage, salt boil-
ing would commence, which would cause voiding of the
salt from the affected channel. For the MSBR fuel-salt
mixture, vaporization of only about 3 X 107* of the
liquid in any passage would produce enough vapor to
displace all of the remaining liquid. Thus, voiding would
proceed rapidly, and since abundant nucleation sites (in
the form of helium bubbles circulating with the salt) are
available for growth of vapor bubbles, little temperaturé
or pressure overshoot would occur. More than 99% of
the vapor formed would be BeF, + LiBeF;, so that all
the uranium and thorium would be expelled with the
salt, leaving a “pure” void in the core. The voiding
would terminate the heat generation in the affected
passage. The fuel passage would then refill with cooler
salt, and the heat-up and boiling sequence would be
repeated. The positive reactivity effect associated with
the voiding of a few 4-in.-square fuel cells* — 5 X 107%
Akfk per cell — would be insignificant from a nuclear-
excursion standpoint, but the increased ‘“‘noise” in the
neutron flux due to repeated voiding and refilling of
blocked fuel passages would reveal the presence of the
blockage, and corrective action would be taken at once.
In this situation, both the overheated salt and the vapor
would contact only the graphite in the core and there-
fore would not constitute a threat to the PCPB. (The
effects of salt vapor on graphite will be investigated
experimentally in other areas of the Program to deter-
mine if such interaction could have safety significance.)

A fuel-flow interruption that affects the entire core
could result from an electric power failure, which
causes all four primary circulation pumps to stop, or
from a loss of salt from the primary circuit, which

cells in an MSBR core is expected to be less than a simple
multiple of the single-cell effect and is currently under investiga-
tion.
leaves all the pumps (at the high points of the loops)

above the salt level. In the event of a power failure to

all four primary-pump motors, the following events
would occur:

1. automatic shutdown of nuclear power by insertion
of shutdown rods,

2. salt circulation continued at a low rate in one or
more loops, with the pumps being driven by auxil-
iary (pony) motors which have redundant and
diverse direct-current power supplies, and

3. drainage of fuel-salt if undesirably high temperatures
are reached.

If salt circulation were absolutely prevented (as by
seizure of all four pumps or loss of system level) the salt
would have to be drained to prevent the eventual attain-
ment of excessive temperatures in the core from fission
product decay heat.

Even if the nuclear shutdown rods failed to insert as
expected, the fission power would be reduced by the
negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of the
fuel salt. In the absence of salt circulation, the salt
temperature is equal to or higher than that of the
graphite, thereby ensuring lower core reactivity than
when the graphite (which has a positive temperature
coefficient) is above the fuel temperature. Although
some heating would continue due to fission product
decay, preliminary calculations suggest that tempera-
tures would remain tolerable for times longer than the 5
min required to initiate a salt drain under even the most
adverse conditions. Considerably more time would be
available if the shutdown rods were effective in acceler-
ating the rate of nuclear power reduction. Therefore, it
was concluded that even this highly improbable com-
bination of events is unlikely to cause a failure of the
PCPB.

Missiles. Since the primary system of an MSBR is
enclosed in the primary containment, which also pro-
vides biological shielding (several feet of reinforced con-
crete), and a secondary containment, it is highly
unlikely that missiles originating outside the primary
containment could affect the integrity of the PCPB.
The only rapidly moving components inside the pri-
mary containment are the rotary elements of the fuel
circulation pumps. Preliminary investigations of the
consequences of a pump-impeller failure indicated that
the resultant missiles would not penetrate both the
pump volute and the pump tank, as would be required
to breach the PCPB.

3.1.2 Direct Consequences

Although salt spills could result from a number of
event sequences and could involve either fuel salt or

34

coolant salt or both, the consequences are not strongly
dependent on either the nature or the magnitude of the
spill. Thus, for the purpose of this description, it is
assumed that the salt is spilled from a double-ended
pipe failure that occurs with the reactor at full power,
and that all the salt flows out of the failed system.

The expected response of the system to such a spill
would be an opening of the thermally actuated contain-
ment drain valve to allow the salt to flow into the fuel
drain tank. Since the design ambient temperature inside
the primary containment is above the salt liquidus
temperatures, there would be no freezing, and essen-
tially all of the salt would reach the drain tank. Any salt
remaining in the primary system would also flow to the
drain tank through the normal drain line. The redun-
dant cooling systems in the drain tank would remove
fission product afterheat from the salt while limiting
the salt temperatures to acceptable levels.

After the containment drains, an open line would still
remain between the drain tank and the containment,
which would allow much of the gaseous fission product
inventory to be released from the drain tank to the
primary containment. Quantitative estimates have not
been made of the fission product inventory in the con-
tainment at this stage of the event sequence, but it is
clear that the primary containment ought to remain
intact to avoid a challenge to the secondary contain-
ment and any possibility of releasing activity to the
environment. If only fuel salt were involved in the spill,
there would be no significant pressure rise and hence no
threat to the primary containment.

If coolant salt (NaBF,;-NaF) were involved in the
spill, as much as 730 ft3 could flow into the drain tank
to mix with the fuel salt. While some BF3; gas would be
evolved as the two salts were mixed, there is currently
no basis for accurately estimating the extent of this
release or the primary-containment pressure that would
result. Very likely, additional engineered safeguards
would be developed, if needed, to limit the pressure rise
to an acceptable value.

Probably, the most adverse condition that could arise
during a salt spill would be a failure of the containment
drain line to open. In the case of a fuel-salt spill, this
would leave essentially the entire inventory in the
primary containment and would require removal of the
fission product afterheat by way of the containment-
wall cooling system. Preliminary analyses of the
primary-containment design concept described with the
reference design® indicated that heat removal would be

Single-Fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor, ORNL-4541 (June
1971) pp. 138—-44.

inadequate and that failure of the containment proba-
bly would occur as a consequence of overheating. How-
ever, similar analyses of an alternate concept which pro-
vides for water cooling outside the containment liner
showed that this system would provide the needed heat
removal capability without intolerable liner tempera-
tures.

The conclusion from these considerations is that salt

35

spills can safely be retained within a properly designed

primary containment system for an MSBR, provided
that any pressure rises associated with the mixing of
fuel and coolant salts can be limited to system design
values. Since MSBR includes secondary containment as
well, any spill would thus be doubly contained and
would not release significant quantities of radioactivity
to the environment.

3.1.3 Deferred Consequences

The above investigations indicated that a breach of
the PCPB of an MSBR system is highly unlikely and

that if such a breach were to occur, the short-term con-
sequences would be limited by the primary contain-
ment, so that there would be no significant hazard to
the public health and safety. However, any major
release of activity inside the containment of an MSBR
presents another safety problem which should receive
some attention. This problem is the cleanup operation
that would be necessary either to restore the plant to an
operable condition or to decommission it afterward.
Such an operation would require that the primary con-
tainment be opened, leaving only the secondary con-
tainment to limit releases to the environment. By the
time the cleanup was started, any spilled salt would
probably be frozen, and the ‘containment atmosphere
could be purged of gas-borne activity. Experience in the
operation of the MSRE showed that radioactivity is not
readily dispersed from frozen salt, so the task would be
difficult but not impossible. To establish the extent to
which this process should be factored into the plant
design, the existence of cleanup possibilities must be
considered along with the very low probability of
requiring such action.
Part 2. Chemistry

L. M. Ferris

At ORNL the chemical research and development
efforts related to the design and ultimate operation of
molten-salt breeder reactor systems are concentrated on
fuel- and coolant-salt chemistry, including the develop-
ment of analytical methods for use in these systems.

The chemistry of tellurium in fuel salt is being studied
to help elucidate the role of this element in the
intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N. This work in-
cludes the estimation of the rate of tellurium deposition
on Hastelloy N surfaces in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.
Another phase of the program was the construction of a
test stand in which Hastelloy N and other alloys are
exposed to tellurium vapor at controlled temperatures
and deposition rates.

Studies were continued of the effect of oxygen-
containing species on the equilibrium between dissolved
UF; and dissolved UF,, and, in some cases, between
the dissolved uranium fluorides and graphite, and the
UC,. The presence of dissolved oxide or gaseous CO did
not convert the solid UC, to an oxycarbide. A general
conclusion of these studies is that UCy02_ phases are
metastable with respect to UO; and UC, at tempera-
tures below 700°C. Apparatus is being assembled to
redetermine the equilibrium quotient for the important
reaction UF,4(d) + % H,(g) = UF;(d) + HF(g), using a
spectrophotometric method. In preparation for studies
of the electrolytic removal of bismuth, oxide, and other
species from fuel salt, a prototype packed-bed electrode
of glassy carbon spheres has been constructed and
tested.

Several aspects of coolant-salt chemistry are also
under investigation. Specifically, hydroxy and oxy
compounds that could be formed in molten NaBF, are
being synthesized and characterized. These studies will
help define reactions and compounds that may be
involved in corrosion or in methods for trapping
tritium. The phase diagram of the system H;OBF,-
HBO,-H,O has been defined at 25°C as an aid in

36

determining the composition of mixtures of condensed
species produced by the interaction of water with
NaBF,4. Studies of the chemistry of chromium(IiI)
compounds in fluoroborate melts were continued as
part of a systematic investigation of the corrosion of
structural alloys by coolant salt. The compound CrF,
was found to be thermodynamically more stable in
Na3CrFg than in NasCryF, 4, which explains why the
former compound is the one that precipitates when
Hastelloy N is corroded by NaBF,. Thermodynamic
calculations have shown that NaBF, might react with
Hastelloy N to form borides. Consequently, an appara-
tus has been assembled to test boride deposition on and
penetration of structural alloys. Preliminary results
from 72-day exposures of Hastelloy N.and Inconel 600
to NaBF,-NaF eutectic at 640°C show that the boron
concentration at the surface of the Hastelloy N was
increased by a minor amount and that the surface
boron concentration was increased significantly in the
case of Inconel 600.

The development of analytical methods for both fuel
and coolant salt was continued. An in-line voltammetric
method for determining U**/U3* ratios in fuel salt was
tested in a forced-convection loop, FCL-2b, over a
six-month period. The redox potential of the system
was changed intermittently by adding either beryllium
metal or nickel fluoride to the loop. The subsequent
changes of the U*/U ratio were readily determined,
but quantitative determination of chromium was not
possible. Similar voltammetric measurements of BiF; in
molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, were made in the presence of
NiF,, an anticipated interference. By use of a stripping
technique, the limit of detection was extended to less
than 25 ppb. With NaBF,-NaF coolant salt, an anodic
wave has been found which is directly proportional to
the NaBF;OH concentration. This latter development
could provide the basis for a continuous in-line determi-
nation of hydroxy species in molten fluoroborate.

4.1 TELLURIUM DEPOSITION ON HASTELLOY N
SURFACES IN AN MSBR

A.D.Kelmers D.Y. Valentine

An estimate of the deposition rate of tellurium on
Hastelloy N surfaces in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR is needed
to design deposition experiments for investigation of
tellurium-induced corrosion and grain-boundary crack-
ing to be encountered on the Hastelloy N surfaces of
the MSBR. To make a conservative estimate (i.e., a
maximum vilue) of the amount of tellurium that could
deposit on various Hastelloy N surfaces in an MSBR,
the overall disposition of tellurium both in the primary
system and in the drain tank must be considered. For
the purpose of these calculations, the sources of
tellurium were taken as the direct fission yield of
tellurium from the fuel salt plus all significant decay-
chain yields.! Contributions from various tellurium
isotopes to the total accumulation can be obtained
from steady-state rate and mass-transfer calculations.? >3
To write a steady-state rate balance for production vs
decay of tellurium produced from direct fission and
decay of precursors, the following assumptions have
been made:

1. A steady state has been achieved.

2. Noble-metal fission products are homogeneously
dispersed in the fuel salt.

. Tellurium and its precursors are insoluble in the fuel

salt.

The reaction with all surfaces is rapid, and the

tellurium remains with the surface once contact is

made. _

5. The mass-transfer coefficients can be estimated with

conventional theory (i.e., Newtonian behavior of

fuel-salt fluid, independent migration of tellurium

species in the fuel salt, etc.).

Deposition is homogeneous on the Hastelloy N

surfaces.

The species under consideration include the tin and
antimony precursors as well as tellurium produced
directly. The assumption is also made that iodine does
not remain on the Hastelloy N surface but redissolves in
the fuel salt immediately. If the diffusivity of tellurium
in Hastelloy N were large compared with the decay
half-life of a particular tellurium isotope, the iodine
daughter might form far enough below the surface to be

trapped there. However, from observations of the
fission product behavior in the MSRE, this condition
does not appear to be the case.?

Two more assumptions were made to approximate
the concentration of tellurium that deposits on any of
three types of surfaces found in the MSBR — metal
(Hastelloy N}, graphite, and bubbles:

1. The residence times of tellurium and its precursors
in the salt and the half-lives of these species are long
compared with the fuel-salt circuit time (13 sec).’.

The residence half-life® is defined as (In 2)/X, where
1
X=A+PlEH A

+ EHs—ygAg +2Hs—>bAb] 3 hr_l s
H = mass-transfer coefficient, ft/hr,

A = area of the particular surface, ft?
V = fuel-salt volume, ft3,

A =decay constant for isotope under consideration
(small in comparison with the rest of the expres-
sion and may be omitted),

for transfer considered from the fuel salt (s) to metal
(m), graphite (g), and bubble (b) surfaces. For a
tellurium particle size of 2.8 A, the residence half-life in
the fuel salt is 89 sec and the dacay half-lives of the
shortest lived species are 50 sec and about 30 sec for
1348p and '35 Te respectively. Thus, this assumption is
valid and assures that the contributions from fission
yields in the core are uniformly distributed throughout
the primary system.

2. In addition, the residence times of tellurium and
its precursors are short compared with the half-lives of
these species, assuring that deposition occurs as fast as
production and that the total inventory is somewhere
on a surface. For most isotopeg involved, this second
assumption holds for the 2.8-A-particle-size residence
half-life of 89 sec. It is violated for 50-sec 134Sb and
about 30-sec '*5Te; however, the yields of these
isotopes are so low that no significant error is intro-
duced. Although 89 sec is not much shorter than the
decay half-lives of 2.2-min '32Sn and 2.1-min *32Sb,
the yields of which are considerably higher, the final
decay product, '*?Te, has a half-life of 105_days, and
again the second assumption holds. For 100-A tellurium
particles the residence half-life is 2.3 min. Subtraction
of species in violation of the second assumption
introduces an error of only 0.02%, so the assumption is
still valid. However, for 1000-A particles the residence
half-life becomes 67 min. Quite a few species have
half-lives in this range or shorter. Fortunately, the
yields of these species are fairly low, and the estimated
maximum error is only about 6.5%. The validity of the
second assumption assures that decay during transport
to a surface is negligible, thus allowing a simplified
calculation that provides a reliable estimate of tellurium
deposition on surfaces.

At steady state, then, the production rate of the first
parent in a chain will equal the decay rate, where

production rate (atoms/min)
= (fissions/min) (yield/fission)
and
decay rate = (A) (number of atoms present).
Thus, the steady-state inventory of a species (number of
atoms present) may be found from

(fission rate) (yield)

A
When deposition from the fuel salt was calculated for a
parent of Te (Sn, Sb), the tellurium surface concentra-
tion was obtained by successively balancing production
and decay rates; for example, for a decay chain leading
to 127 Te, the balance would be written as

(Bw)127sn = (7\N)1275b,
(Bm)lz‘TSb = (MV), 27Te>

N = inventory =

where B denotes the branching ratio.
The total inventory may then be proportioned to the

various surfaces of interest according to the laws of
mass transport. The fraction? sticking to a particular
surface (metal, for example) is given by

38

Fo= SmHS‘—'_mAm
m b}
szHsamAm t SgZHs—rg-Ag t SbEHSQbAb

where § = sticking coefficient. The effective sticking
coefficient for noble-metal particles to bubble surfaces
appeared to be much smaller (0.1 or less) than for metal
(1.0) or graphite (1.0) in the MSRE.?> However, it was
not determined whether the sticking coefficient for
bubble surfaces was truly smaller or only appeared
smaller because the particles were reentrained and
recirculated in the salt after leaving the pump bowl. To
provide a maximum estimate of tellurium deposition on
the heat-exchanger surfaces in an MSBR, a sticking
coefficient of 1.0 was used for the metal and graphite
surfaces and 0.05 was used for the bubble surfaces.
Finally,

(NV)(F)/area = atoms/area

on each surface. This calculation was done for deposi-
tion of tellurium particle sizes of 2.8, 100, and 1000 A
on heat-exchanger surface areas in an MSBR (Tables
4.1, 4.2). Values ofHS_,]- and the areas were taken from

Table AlI-1, ref. 2. These results show that the particle
size has little influence on the deposition rates. There-
fore, further discussion will concentrate on the 2.8-A
particle size only.

The deposition on Hastelloy N surfaces of the heat
exchangers may be expressed as:

(0.8316 X 1073 +0.1197 X 10™!) mg/cm?,

with ¢ in effective full-power days (EFPD). The first
term in this expression represents the deposition of
stable tellurium isotopes, and the second term repre-
sents the steady-state amount of radioactive tellurium
isotopes at the heat exchanger surfaces, or, if ¢ is
expressed in effective full-power years (EFPY):

(0.3035¢ + 0.012) mg/cm?
= (1.406¢ +0.055) X 10'® atoms/cm?.

Previous estimates® gave a value of (0.88¢ + 0.03)
X10'® atoms/cm?. Thus in 30 EFPY, 9.105 mg/cm? of
stable tellurium isotopes would deposit on Hastelloy N
surfaces. In addition, 43.08 mg/ecm? of radioactive
isotopes of tellurium would have at one time contacted
a Hastelloy N surface (steady-state amount times time
times 0.6931/z, 2). Since neither the rate of diffusion
of tellurium into Hastelloy N nor the mechanism of any
surface reactions is known, the effect of the radioactive
isotopes cannot be accurately predicted. However, if
each atom of tellurium (stable and radioactive) that
ever contacts a Hastelloy N surface is assumed to react,
a cumulative exposure equivalent to about 52.1
mg/cm?® would have been available in 30 EFPY to the
heat-exchanger surfaces.

Tellurium deposition on the Hastelloy N surfaces in
the drain tank must also be considered. The surface area
and disposition of the bubbles used to remove fission
products from the primary system to the drain tank
may vary considerably with different reactor design
modifications. A centrifugal separator is envisioned to
extract the bubbles from the salt along with a small
amount of salt; both the bubbles and this small amount
of salt will then flow to the drain tank. The salt phase is
in the drain tank about 1 min and then returns to the
primary salt system from the bottom of the drain
tank.” However, the gas phase has an average residence
time in the drain tank of about 6 hr before proceeding
to a particle trap and cleanup system.® The disposition
of the noble-metal fission products in this system is
somewhat uncertain except that they are removed from
the primary system and that the opportunity exists for
deposition to occur on the drain-tank surfaces.

39

Consistent with the assumptions made for the heat-
exchanger calculation above, a cumulative exposure
equivalent to about 5.5 mg/cm? (0.965 mg/cm? stable
Te isotopes + 4.57 mg/ecm? cumulative radioactive Te
isotopes) would have been available to the drain tank
surface in 30 EFPY. This estimate assumes that all the
tellurium arriving in the drain tank on bubble surfaces
ends up uniformly distributed on the 17,802-ft? drain-
tank surface area.’ Probably, however, a higher concen-
tration of noble-metal fission products will be found in
a ring at the gas-liquid interface area around the drain
tank. A correction to the steady-state amount that
enters the drain tank must be made if the time required
to circulate the entire fuelsalt inventory through the
drain tank (7;, = 20 min) is not short compared with
the sum of the mean lives of a decay chain (7,), where,
for example, 7, = 7, T 72 T 73 for the reaction

Sb3! snf? Te 3 |

If 74,27, a significant fraction of radioactive tellurium
from the chain under consideration will decay on
bubbles in the primary circuit. The fraction that does
not so decay may then be described approximately by
¢ Tg:l7s. If all the tellurium isotopes produced from
decay chains having 7,<27,, were omitted, the resulting
error in the calculation would be only about 0.3%.
Therefore, this correction has been neglected in these
calculations.

Further estimates of the tellurium exposure that
might be encountered by the Hastelloy N surfaces in
the drain tank if the bubble fraction in the primary
circuit were increased were made by increasing the
bubble surface area from about 10% of the total surface
area (value used in the previous calculations) to about
48% of the total surface area and by calculating the
amount of tellurium that adhered to bubbles. A
bubble-surface-area fraction of 48% represents a bubble
surface area of about 100,000 ft*, which corresponds
to the maximum allowable void fraction in the core of
1 to 2%.7 Also, since considerable uncertainty exists
concerning the value of the bubble-sticking coefficient,
equal sticking probabilities were assigned to each
surface (1.0) for the purpose of maximizing the
drain-tank estimates.

In the maximum case calculated (48% bubble surface
area) the tellurium deposition in the drain tank may be
expressed as

(0.2647 X 1072+ +0.3810 X 10™") mg/cm?,

with # in EFPD. Cumulative tellurium exposure accrued
may be proportioned from the values calculated for the
heat exchangers. Thus, in 30 EFPY, 29.0 mg/cm? of
stable isotopes would deposit on and 137.1 mg/cm? of
radioactive isotopes would contact the Hastelloy N
surface of the drain tank; such a deposit would amount
to a cumulative exposure equivalent to 166.1 mg/cm?.
In this case, the tellurium exposure on the heat-
exchanger surfaces would be reduced to 9.7 mg/cm?
(stable Te isotopes, 1.70 mg/cm? + cumulative radio-
active Te isotopes, 8.019 mg/cm?).

4.2 EXPOSURE OF METALLURGICAL SAMPLES
TO TELLURIUM VAPOR

A.D.Kelmers D.Y. Valentine

Investigation of the Hastelloy N surfaces in the MSRE
showed that the grain boundaries of this alloy had been
selectively attacked and that intergranular cracking had
occurred. Subsequently, tellurium, produced as a fission
product in the MSRE fuel salt, has been shown to
induce such cracking. Probably, resistance to tellurium
attack can be achieved by modifying the Hastelloy N
alloy by minor additions of Ti, Nb, or rare earth
elements or by small increases in the Cr content. An
experiment, described in the previous semiannual
report,!® is now in progress to evaluate the extent of
tellurium-induced grain-boundary cracking that occurs
when Hastelloy N or its various modified alloys are
exposed to tellurium vapor.

Three consecutive test exposures of standard Hastel-
loy N have been made for periods of 100, 100, and 200
hr, respectively. In the first 100-hr test, four tensile
specimens, one sheet sample, and one foil sample were
exposed to tellurium vapor at a diffusion rate to the
specimens of 0.048 mg of Te per hour. With the
temperature difference between solid tellurium and the
specimens as the controlling variable, this particular
diffusion rate was produced by holding the solid
tellurium at 440°C and the specimens at 700°C. After
this exposure, visual inspection of the test specimens
showed deposition almost exclusively on the end of the
specimens nearest the tellurium source. At a specimen
temperature of 700°C, the rate of reaction of the
tellurium vapor with the specimens appeared to be as

40

rapid as the rate at which tellurium diffused to the
specimens. Thus, the initial assumption of perfect
gettering used in the transport model'® appears to be
valid. The samples were removed and weighed. The
weight of tellurium deposited on the specimens aver-
aged one-fourth of the value predicted by the
transport-model diffusion equation.

The specimens were replaced for a second 100-hr
exposure after having been turned end for end, so that
the end oriented toward the tellurium source was that
which showed no visual signs of having reacted in the
first 100-hr exposure. The identical Te, vapor exposure
procedure was repeated. After the second 100-hr
exposure, the specimens were darkened on the end
closest to the tellurium source as before, with no
reaction visible in the center of the specimens; this
verified the rapid reaction rate. However, when
weighed, two samples had lost weight and the other two
showed no weight change. Although no volatile tellu-
rides had been expected, possibly the preliminary
procedure of heating the specimens and the quartz tube
under vacuum for outgassing purposes prior to loading
the tellurium could have removed some material from
the specimens before the second exposure began.

To test this possibility, the deposition was repeated a
third time for an increased period of 200 hr. Visual
inspection of the specimens after the 200-hr exposure
revealed a uniform darkening of the entire surface area.

" However, the weight data were still inconsistent. Two

specimens gained weight slightly, and two lost weight.
In addition, there was a gray deposit on the inside of
the quartz tube in a position that could have been as
much as 5°C cooler than the specimen temperature.
Apparently, material had been transported from the
specimens to the quartz surface. X-ray diffraction
analysis of this material showed it to be NiTeq ;. No
elemental tellurium was detected. Since a volatile nickel
telluride species was formed, material could well have
been lost from the specimens during outgassing proce-
dures prior to the Te, exposure in addition to the
material lost to the quartz during the exposure itself.
This loss would explain the failure to record weight
gains from tellurium addition.

Various techniques were used to analyze the surfaces
of the tensile and sheet specimens. X-ray diffraction
identified NizTe, and NiTeq ¢ on the surface of the
sheet specimen. Relative amounts of these species could
not be obtained, because their diffraction patterns
overlap to a great extent. Auger spectroscopy was used

to examine the first few atom layers on one of the
tensile specimens. The elements Cr, O, C, and possibly
some Te were detected. The distribution of these
elements along the length of the tensile specimen
appeared to be fairly uniform. The Cr and O are
believed to result from a thin Cr,O; surface coating
that may have been present on the specimens before the
exposure began. The carbon is presumed to arise from
the diffusion of oil in the vacuum system.
~ The other two tensile specimens were tensile tested
and examined for intergranular cracking. No loss of
yield strength or tensile strength was recorded. How-
ever, under microscopic examination, extensive inter-
granular cracking was visible over the entire surface of
the specimens, with an average along the length of the
specimen of about 75 cracks/cm. The depth of the
cracking ranged from 1 to 5 mils, with most of the
cracking occurring to a depth of about 2 mils (Fig. 4.1).
Quantitative data on tellurium accretion to tensile
specimens cannot be obtained by this vapor-deposition
method due to the unexpected formation of volatile
nickel tellurides. However, this method is capable of
producing tellurium-induced intergranular cracking in
the tensile specimens and appears to be a useful
screening method to initially test the extent to which
Hastelloy N modifications are attacked intergranularly
by tellurium. In view of this possible screening method,
another test is in progress in which tensile specimens of
three modified alloys will be exposed, along with
another set of standard Hastelloy N specimens. The
modified alloys contain: increased Nb content, 2.6%;
increased Ti content, 2.16%; or both increased Nb
content, 2.6%, and increased Ti content, 0.71%, in the
same alloy. These four alloys, each in a separate quartz
tube, will be exposed as before with the exception that
the exposure time will be increased to 1000 hr. The
1000-hr period corresponds to 10'® atoms of Te per
square centimeter, which is about 2.4% of the exposure
expected during 30 effective full-power years of
1000-MW(e) MSBR operation (Sect. 4.2).

4.3 EFFECTS OF OXYGEN ON THE UF;/UF,
EQUILIBRIUM IN MOLTEN
FLUORIDE SOLUTIONS

L. O. Gilpatrick R.M.Waller'' L. M. Toth
Equilibria involving the U*/U*" redox couple in
molten fluoride solutions have been under continuing
study.!2-!* Results in the previous report'? suggested
that the inadvertent admission of an oxygen-containing
species could alter the equilibrium quotient for the

41

reaction 4UF; + 2C = 3UF; + UC,, possibly by
forming an oxycarbide rather than a pure dicarbide
phase. Two series of experiments were conducted
recently by use of fixed oxygen activities in attempts to
better explain the previous findings.

In the first series, solid UQ, was used to fix the oxide
activity. Sealed graphite capsules were rocked at 600°C
to equilibrate UO, and UC, using molten fluoride salts
dilute in UF;-UF, as a flux medium for either 41 or 90
days in an attempt to produce a stable oxycarbide
phase such as UOy‘Cz_y of lower reducing potential
than UC,. The capsules contained LiF-BeF, mixtures
(66-34 o or 48-52 mole %), respectively. In

. ..n, the capsules contained UF, at a molarity of
(.035 and equimolar amounts of pure solid UO, and
UC, totaling 50% of the solution weight. Analyses of
the UO, and UC, recovered from the capsules after the
tests indicated no significant changes from the results
reported earcl)ier.1 2 An unaltered cubic lattice parameter
of 54711 A for UO, and a slightly expanded UC,
lattice were detected by x-ray diffraction. No new
phases could be detected.

Three of the solutions recovered were examined
spectrophotometrically to determine if the UF;/UF,
ratio had fallen to the level indicated previously’? asa
result of the extended contact with UQO,. Each solution
contained concentrations of UF; equivalent to or
greater than those of the previous experiments with
pure carbide equilibria."® These results give further
support to the observation that UO, does not alter the
equilibrium of UC, with UF;3;-UF, in these molten
fluoride solutions.

A second possible fixed oxygen activity that could
account for the lower UF; equilibrium concentration
observed earlier'? would be the presence of oxygen-
containing species in the gas phase above the melt.
Therefore, controlled-atmosphere experiments were
conducted. A gas manifold was constructed to blend
high-purity (99.9999%) argon and 99.99% carbon
monoxide so that a variety of mixtures having low
partial pressures of CO could be produced. Solutions

that contained 0.07 mole % UF; were then exposed to
the flowing gas mixture at a total pressure of 1 atm.
Preliminary trials with CO and CO, at 1 atm indicated
that both were much too oxidizing to maintain any
measurable UF; concentration at 600° or 700°C. The
oxygen pressure from reaction (1) can be easily
calculated from standard equilibrium tabulations:"®

CO=C+%%0,. (1)
A second reaction results in the conversion of UF; to
UF; and UQ,; the UO, was identified as an end
product in all cases:

4UF;(d) + 2C0O(g)

= 3UF,;(d) + UO,(c) + 2C(c). (2)

Oxygen fugacities can be lowered by dilution with
argon. Partial pressures of CO equal to 2 X 107® atm
would be necessary to achieve equilibrium (2) at 600°C
for UF,; and UF, concentrations of 6.7 X 10™* and 6.7
X 1072 mole % respectively. Measurements were made
at successwely lower CO paurtlal pressures until the
practical experlmental limit was reached at 1.5 X 107°
atm. In all cases, as predicted, reaction (2) proceeded to
completion within the limits of detection.

These data indicate that impurities such as oxide ion
from UO, or oxygen from CO do not react with UC,
to form uranium oxycarbides. The compound UQ, has
no observable effect on the UF3-UF, equilibrium, but
traces of CO oxidize UF; to UF4; and UQ,. Therefore,

43

UC 0,. y phases are metastable with respect to UO,

and UC, at temperatures less than 700°C, and, as a
result, the maximum tolerable oxide concentration in
the fuel solution will be determined by the solubility
limit of UO, or Pa,0s.

4.4 THE URANIUM
TETRAFLUORIDE—HYDROGEN EQUILIBRIUM
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SOLUTIONS

L. O. Gilpatrick L. M. Toth

Discrepancies exist between the equilibrium quotients

measured for the reaction:

4UF;4(d) + 2C = 3UF,4(d) + UC, (4)
and those predicted from other sources. We have
undertaken a reexamination of the equilibrium:

UF,4(d) + %4H, = UF5(d) + HF, ()

previously studied by Long and Blankenship'” because
of the importance of reactions (4) and (5) to MSBR
fuel-salt chemistry.

In previous work,! 7 the progress of the reaction and
the concentrations of UF; and UF,; in solution were
inferred from the amount of HF evolved from the melt,
so it was difficult to distinguish between side reactions
and reaction (5). In addition, equilibrium could be
approached only by reducing UF,. This procedure may
be improved in several ways. In-situ spectrophotometric
measurements of both UF; and UF, concentrations as
a function of time, temperature, and HF/H, ratio are
now possible. In addition, the recently available
fluoride-sensitive electrodes allow measurement of
much lower HF concentrations. These improvements
permit a wider range of temperatures to be explored,
especially lower temperatures in the range of interest to
the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. Another advantage of
the new procedure is the possibility of reversing the
equilibrium by changes of temperature or gas composi-
tion so that equilibrium can be approached from either
side while under constant monitoring and control.

Preparation of equipment and the assembly of a
gas-handling and -analysis system for the study of
reaction (5) are nearly complete. Pure H, is generated
by an electrolysis—palladium-diffuser unit. The hydro-
gen gas stream is saturated with HF (in low concentra-
tions) from the dissociation KHF, = KF + HF at a
carefully controlled temperature. This three-phase
system (excess KF is present) gives a controlled partial
pressure of HF.'® The blended gas stream is then
passed over (or sparged through) the fluoride solution
that contains UF; and UF,, which is contained in a
graphite cell. A newly designed pure-nickel spectral
furnace encloses the cell. Nickel construction allows for
a cleaner system than was previously possible, because
of the more thorough removal of oxide species, which is
possible by H, reduction prior to use. Gas mixtures
entering and leaving the furnace are analyzed for flow
rate, pressure, and HF content. Hydrogen fluoride
determination is made by aqueous scrubbing of the gas
stream and measuring the fluoride ion concentration-
with a specific-ion electrode. |

4.5 POROUS-ELECTRODE STUDIES

H. R. Bronstein  F. A. Posey

Studies were continued on the development of porous
and packed-bed electrode systems as continuous, on-
line monitors of the concentrations of electroactive
substances in MSBR fuel salt. First priority was given to
the design and testing of a device that could monitor,
and perhaps remove, dissolved bismuth from fuel salt,
since small concentrations of bismuth in fuel salt
returning to the reactor from the processing plant could
result in corrosion of the Hastelloy N of which the
reactor primary circuit would be constructed. Continu-
ing studies in support of other programs have demon-
strated the usefulness of porous and packed-bed elec-
trodes for electroanalysis and for recovery of trace
amounts of reducible inorganic pollutants from various
effluents and process streams.'?»2°

During the previous report period, a prototype
packed-bed electrode of glassy-carbon spheres (about
100 u in diameter) was tested in a preliminary study by
use of the LiCI-KCl eutectic system.2! Results of
linear-sweep voltammetric measurements, carried out in
the presence of small quantities of iron salts and
cadmium salts, showed that the cell, instrumentation,
and auxiliary systems functioned successfully and
demonstrated the inherent sensitivity of this method of
analysis. However, the tests on the prototype cell
showed the need to modify the experimental apparatus
to facilitate the addition of known amounts of various
substances to the melt and to allow operation under
vacuum or inert atmosphere over long periods of time.

Most of the effort during this report period has been
devoted to the redesign of the experimental assembly,
to the acquisition of more advanced and convenient
instrumentation than that used previously, and to the
construction and testing of the assembly prior to the
resumption of experimental measurements. An overall
view of the new experimental assembly and the
necessary control and measurement equipment is shown
(Fig. 4.2). The cell, located inside a test chamber, which
is mounted on a portable test stand (shown in the
center of the picture), is inserted into a furnace that
permits direct observation of the quartz cell assembly
during operation. The experimental assembly will
permit establishing proper operating procedures for
later studies on MSBR fuel salt, for which a metal cell
assembly will be required. Attached to the top of the
test chamber are various entry ports for insertion of the

44

packed-bed electrode assembly and for addition of
reagents, a thermocouple well, a counterelectrode, and
an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, as well as pressure
and/or vacuum fittings for the cell and for the valve
assemblies. At the left in Fig. 4.2 are shown cabinets
that contain equipment for precise control of the
temperature of the furnace and cell assembly. To the
right of the test stand are rack-mounted instruments for
carrying out the electrochemical measurements (poten-
tiostat with electronic auto-ranging coulometer,
electrode-potential programmer, and electrometer).
Also shown at the right is a two-pen X-Y,,Y, recorder
for simultaneous recording of current-potential and
charge-potential curves for the packed-bed electrode.

The newly designed packed-bed electrode is shown
(Fig. 4.3). The packed bed of glassy-carbon spheres is
supported on a porous quartz frit and is contained in a
quartz sheath. Another porous quartz frit presses on the
bed from above. A glassy-carbon rod penetrates the
upper quartz frit to provide compaction of the bed and
electrical contact with a long stainless steel rod that is
insulated from the surrounding tantalum support tube.
The electrode is dipped into the melt so that the molten
salt flows up through the interior of the packed bed and
out an overflow slot. By this means, a reproducible
volume of melt can be obtained inside the packed-bed
electrode.

Preliminary testing of the entire experimental assem-
bly has been completed, and experimental measure-
ments will be resumed immediately following prepara-
tion and loading of the salt mixture for the melt.
Initially, work will be in LiClI-KCl eutectic, since the
behavior of a number of electroactive substances has
already been established for this medium, and thus the
new cell assembly can be conveniently checked out and
calibrated. Results of experimental measurements on
the bismuth system and on other electroactive sub-
stances will be presented in a subsequent report.
Following successful testing of the present cell assem-
bly, a similar apparatus will be designed and con-
structed for use with molten fluoride melts.

5. Coolant-Salt Chemistry

5.1 CHEMISTRY OF SODIUM FLUOROBORATE
L. Maya

An unacceptable amount of the tritium (731 Ci/day)
produced in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR could reach the
steam system unless it is trapped by the coolant.! Indi-
cations? are that a sodium fluoroborate melt, NaBF,-
NaF (92-8 mole %), presently considered as one possi-
ble coolant in the MSBR, could sequester tritium. Work
done in the past with this coolant melt in the CSTF,? as
well as in laboratory experiments,4 has shown the
presence of at least two hydrogen-containing species,
one acidic and the other NaBF; OH. In addition, one or
more oxygen-containing species exist above the melt
and also above the melt are additional volatile
hydrogen-containing species that are condensable at
room temperature. These compounds constitute a
potential sink for exchanging and/or trapping the trit-
ium. The present work is to identify these species,
study their chemistry, and ascertain their ability to trap
tritium. The -approach chosen consisted of preparing
and studying a number of model compounds. The
initial work, reported in the preceding report®, involved
the synthesis and characterization of the following com-
pounds: H3O0OBF,;, BF;2H,0, HBF,(OH),,
NaBF3;OH. Also reported was the synthesis of
Na;B,F¢O and Naz;B3F¢0O5. Availability of these
materials permitted an evaluation of the analytical tools
available to identify these compounds in actual systems.

During this report period the system HBO,-H; OBF,-
H, O was characterized to help explain the behavior and
composition of the volatile fractions condensed from
fluoroborate melts. The compounds H;OBF,,
HBF,(OH),, and BF;3-2H, O, which are constituents of
this system, were examined using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The protons in all these
compounds undergo exchange among the hydronium
ions, the undissociated acid, and the anion; further-
more, there is also proton exchange in mixtures of these
compounds. The fluorine NMR showed that the fluo-
rine atoms are equivalent in these compounds, as would
be expected, and that there is fluorine exchange in mix-
tures of these compounds. The NMR of these com-
pounds is thus of limited value as an analytical tool in
view of the exchange processes taking place; no specific
signal could be assigned with certainty to a particular
species.

Ternary diagrams for the system HBO,-H; OBF4-H, O
at 25 and 60°C have been constructed to aid in charac-
terization of these compounds in the pure state or as
mixtures. The diagram for the system at 25°C (Fig. 5.1)
shows a large area of compositions having an equilib-
rium solid phase. The main features at 60°C are the
same as those observed at 25°C. The solid phase is boric
acid for compositions of relatively high water content
and metaboric acid for compositions of low water con-
tent; there is also a limited region which contains both
solid phases. The composition of volatile fractions from
fluoroborate melt, expressed in terms of molecular
species, can be found from the fluorine and boron
chemical analysis of the mixture. The fluorine concen-
tration is expressed as H;OBF,, and the boron content,
after subtraction of the amount present in HyOBF,, is
expressed as HBO,, thus fixing a composition in the
diagram. This is illustrated for an actual condensate
collected in the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility. The
analysis was 22.6 millimoles of F per gram and 9.3
millimoles of B per gram.®> This gives a composition of
60.2 wt % Hy0OBF, and 16.4 wt % HBO,, the differ-
ence being water. Expressing this in terms of the stable

molecular species for this region of the phase diagram
gives the composition: 79% BF3;-2H, 0, 12% H;BO;,
and 9% H, O

The ternary diagram is useful also in predicting the
relative stabilities of the molecular species. It has been
found that HBF,(OH), is a metastable species at 25°C
that should disproportionate according to:

This prediction was experimentally substantiated. The
BF;:2H,; O has a relatively high free energy of forma-
tion, which accounts for the fact that boric acid is
dehydrated at room temperature according to:

BF3 + 2H3 BO3 -> HBO'Z + BF3 2H20 ‘ (2)

The NMR studies and the work done in preparing the
phase diagrams indicate that the molecular species of
the system can form stable solutions under certain con-
ditions and interchange easily on addition of HF, BF;,
or H,O; therefore the volatile fractions formed from
the fluoroborate melt are most likely a mixture of com-
pounds rather than a single compound. Also, this means
that isotopic equilibrium should be readily attained
between protium, deuterium, and/or tritium, which
suggests that isotopic exchange should be a viable
method of tritium trapping in the MSBR.

Determination of the oxide and hydroxide -species
present in the melt at low concentrations is a much
more difficult task since the quantity of fluoroborate
will interfere. The compound NaBF;OH can be deter-
mined® by the OH absorption in the infrared region,

but the bands for oxide species are not specific and
appear as broad signals in the region from 700 to 1400
cm™', where there is considerable overlap of the
sodium fluoroborate bands. X-ray powder diffraction
analysis is of limited value since it cannot distinguish
less than about 5 mole % of foreign species in fluoro-
borate. NMR is also of limited use unless the species are
in solution. Thus, the development of separation techni-
ques or the finding of more sensitive spectroscopic
means of detection are required. Dimethyl sulfoxide

(DMSO) has been examined in an initial attempt to

work out separation procedures since it dissolves up to
20 wt % NaBF, at room temperature without decom-
position. The solubility of Na; B3 F;O; in this solvent is
very low, less than 0.5 mg of B per milliliter; thus,
DMSO was used to separate these two compounds. On
the other hand, DMSO reacts with NaBF;OH and
Na, B; F O, producing acidity and BF, ~ ions.

The compounds Na,; B, F¢O and Na; B3 F4 05, poten-
tial oxygen-containing species in the melt, were exam-
ined by differential thermal analysis and thermogravi-
metric analysis. Both are thermally unstable and do not
show a sharp melting point; instead, they form glasses,
and a crystalline phase segregates that is composed of
NaF and NaBF, in the case of Na, B; F¢O and of NaF
in the case of NayB3F¢O5. This finding would tend to
eliminate these compounds as possible oxygen-
containing species in the melt; however, this is not
certain since NaBF; OH is also unstable as a pure com-
pound but has limited stability in the melt. Experi-
ments were made in order to find alternate stable com-
pounds in the system NaF-NaBF,-B,Q5, of which both
Na;B,F¢O and Na3;B3F,0; are components. Flve
mixtures in the system were examined:

Molecular ratio

Mixture NaF NaBF, B,0,
1 2 1 1
2 1 1 1
3 1 2 1
4 2 2 1
5 0 2 1

Each mixture was melted in a platinum container under
a nitrogen stream at either 450 or 550°C. There was no
significant weight loss except for mixture 5, which
showed a weight loss corresponding to the volatilization
of one mole of BF;. In addition to these mixtures,
Na3B3Fs0;3, NayB,F¢O, and a mixture composed of
NaBF, and NaBQO, (2:1 ratio) were also examined. All
these mixtures formed glasses, however, a crystalline
phase could be separated from all except the 1:1:1 mix-

ture. Chemical analysis indicated, and later x-ray
diffraction analysis confirmed, that the identity and
approximate quantity of the crystalline phase corre-
sponded to the component (or components) in excess
of the ratio 1:1:1. Chemical analysis also showed that
boric oxide or the metaborate was converted into a
compound containing B--F bonds.

The following conclusions can be derived from these
experiments: (1) Simple B—O-containing compounds,
such as B,O03; or BO, ", can be discounted as the
oXxygen-containing species in molten fluoroborate; any
B—O species up to a certain concentration will contain
fluorine as well; (2) fluoroborate melts can contain rela-
tively large amounts of oxide species without forming a
separate solid phase; and (3) there are indications that a
compound containing NaF, NaBF,;, and B,0; in a
molar ratio of 1:1:1 is especially stable. This would
correspond to a compound with the empirical formula
Na, B3 F50;5. Further spectroscopic evidence for this
will be sought.

The compound NaBF;0D was prepared by the
reaction:

NaF + DBF,(0OD), - NaBF;0D + D,0

in an 88.6% isotopic purity, for the development of an
infrared method of analysis by the Analytical Chem-
istry Division.

Samples of salt and condensate obtained during a
recent run’ of the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility
were prepared for analysis. The tritium content of these
materials was found to be 4.35 X 103 uCi/g for the salt,
which gives a tritium concentration factor of 7.6 X 10°
in the condensate relative to the fluoroborate melt.
These values are similar to those previously reported,?
confirming that fluoroborate melts can contain tritium
and that the condensate provides a means to concen-
trate and eliminate the tritium. The mechanism for the
process is still unknown.

5.2 CORROSION OF STRUCTURAL
ALLOYS BY FLUOROBORATES

S. Cantor  B. F. Hitch

5.2.1 Thermodynamics of Cr(IIl) in Fluoroborate

When oxidants (e.g., O,, H, O, Ni**) are introduced
into molten NaBF,-NaF in contact with alloys con-
taining chromium, a sparsely soluble green salt,
Na; CrFg, is formed. Other complex salts might also
have been expected to form since the NaF-CrF3 phase
diagram® shows the existence of NazCrFg, NasCr3F, 4,

and NaCrF,. An experiment was designed to obtain the
free energy of formation (AGY) of Nay CrFg by measur-
ing the equilibrium BF; pressure from the reaction

CrF3(c) + 3NaBF,; (d,a v 1) ‘
= Na; CrF¢(c) + 3BF3(g). (1)

However, it was found that Na;Cr3F,, also forms
when CrF; and molten NaBF, interact; thus, it was not
possible to measure AG/ of Na;CrFg by reaction (1),
but the relative stabilities of Na; CrFg and Nas; Cr3Fy 4
could be determined from the equilibrium

sNagCryF, 4(c) + % NaBF,(d, a Y 1)
= Na3 CI'FG(C) + 4/3 BF3(g), (2)

for which the equilibrium constant is
K=Pgp.%h (3)

where PBF3 is the equilibrium pressure.

Measurements of BF; pressures taken over mixtures
of -differing proportions of crystalline NasCr3F,4 and
Na; CrFg in molten NaBF, yielded the same pressure
date (Fig. 5.2) in the temperature range 408 to 592°C.

From the thermodynamic date®!®-'2 for the equi-
librium

it can be shown that, at 800°K, the difference between

the molar free energies of formation of BF3(g) and
NaBF,4 (/) is 122 kcal;

(8)

This is combined with AG® at 800°K for reaction (2) to
obtain a free energy difference between the two com-
plexes:

AGfBF3 (€) — AGfNaBF,, () = 122 keal.

AG gy crp, —HAG N, cr,F,, = 163 keal. (9)
This difference permits the calculation of the difference

formation:

explains why Cr(lII) corrosion products precipitate
from fluoroborate coolant as NayCrF¢ rather than as
Na;CryF 4.

5.2.2 Metal Boride Formation

Thermochemical data for the borides of Fe, Cr, Ni,
Ti, and Mo are sparse and often unreliable. Thus, it is
difficult to accurately predict the extent to which reac-
tions such as

2NaF(d) + NaBF,(d) + (x + 1)Cr(c)

= Na3 CrF¢(c) + Cr, B(c) (12)
may occur in an MSBR coolant loop. The free energy of
this reaction is probably negative; thus, molten NaBF,-
NaF in contact with chromium or a chromiun-
containing alloy is likely to form borides. To test boride
deposition and penetration of structural alloys, an
apparatus has been assembled in which metal specimens
are equilibrated for varying periods of time in molten
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) at 640°C; specimens and salt
are kept under a protective argon atmosphere. Speci-
mens removed from the salt are first washed in boiling
water for several minutes to dissolve salt adhering to
metal surfaces; the metal is then analyzed for boron by
spark-source mass spectrometry (SSMS) and by ion
microprobe.

Spark-source mass spectrometry showed increased
surface boron concentrations for specimens of
Hastelloy N, modified Hastelloy N containing 2% Ti,
and Inconel 600 that were equilibrated with molten
NaBF,-NaF for periods up to 72 days. Typical analysis
showed about 100 ppm B for Hastelloy specimens and
up to 1500 ppm B in Inconel 600, compared with un-
reacted controls in which B contents ranged from 10 to
30 ppm. lon microprobe mass analyses were made on
two metal samples: Inconel 600, in which SSMS
showed 1500 ppm B, and Hastelloy N, 80 ppm B.
Boron was found distributed in small particles on the
surface of the Inconel 600 sample, but the ion micro-
probe analysis could not quantify the amount. Chro-
mium was significantly depleted from the surface.
Boron was also observed on the Hastelloy surface;
removal of part of the surface showed only a much
lesser residual concentration (<100 ppm) of B, and this
was not present in discrete particles. In contrast with
the Inconel 600 specimen, the Hastelloy specimen did
not show a surface depletion of chromium when the
sample was observed through a depth of about 1 um.
5.2.3 Corrosion of Nickel

In heating crystalline NaF and CrF; to 890°C in
nickel capsules, finely divided nickel metal particles
were found in the cooled salt, which indicates that the
nickel is evidently attacked. An explanation of this
result is that the reaction

NaF(c) + 2CrF3(c) + Ni(c)
= NaNiF;(c) + 2CrF,(c) (13)

occurs, proceeding to the right at high temperature and
reversing at low temperatures. Sturm'? reported that
mixtures of CrF3; and CrF,, when heated in nickel,
underwent the reaction

2CrF3 + Ni = NiF, + 2CrF,. (14)
This proceeded to the right at 800 to 1000°C but was
reversed upon cooling, although the AG® values of reac-
tions (13) and (14) seem to be positive. Possibly these
reactions serve as mechanisms for mass transfer of
nickel. That nickel undergoes mass transfer in an

Inconel pump loop'? can be rationalized by a reaction
analogous to (16) and (17),

2CrF3(d) + Ni(Inconel)

NaBF,-NaF
———

NiF,(d) + 2CrF,(d). (15)

Indirect evidence for reaction (15) comes from a study
of Na;CrF4 solubility in NaBF,-NaF. Barton!®
reported that two samples taken at temperatures close
to 700°C gave values of 300 and 390 ppm nickel, possi-
bly indicating corrosion of the nickel container.

An interesting aspect of reaction (17) is that AH" is

nearly zero. In essence, the stability of the complex
(NaNiF3) depends on its entropy, which is greater than
the entropy of the component salts. The thermo-
dynamics of crystalline NaFeF; is likely to be similar.
An analogous situation exists for MgF,. For the reac-
tion

The stability of NazCrFg (the green salt that is the

characteristic corrosion product of any chromium-
containing alloy found in eutectic NaBF,-NaF) is cer-
tain to be much greater. For the reaction

NaF(c) + 3 CrF;(c) = /5Na;3 CrFe(c), (7)
AH 45 is probably —6 kcal (per mole of NaF); this
enthalpy change is estimated from the analogous alumi-
num reaction.!?

6.1 IN-LINE ANALYSIS OF
MOLTEN MSBR FUEL

R. F. Apple B. R. Clark
J.M. Dale D.L.Manning A.S. Meyer

Much of the program effort during this report period
was spent in doing in-line analyses in corrosion test
loops. Presently the U*/U®' concentration ratio is
being measured in one forced-convection loop (FCL-2b)
and two thermal-convection loops (NCL-21 and
NCL-23). During the coming year this effort will
expand to include in-line analyses in as many as a dozen
circulating-salt facilities. To perform these measure-
ments, which must be carried out at widely spaced loca-
tions, two additional voltammeters have been fabricated

and are now being checked out prior to installation. -

Voltammetric data generated for the determination of
U*/U should also be useful for later estimation of
relative changes in corrosion-product ion concentra-
tions. The chromous-ion reduction wave and anodic
stripping wave may be suitable for making semiquanti-
tative measurements of the chromous-ion concentra-
tions.

A relatively long record of the U** /U ratio was
obtained during the first six months of operation of
FCL-2b. This forced-convection loop initially contained
an experimental fuel of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (68-20-12 mole
%) with about 1.4 wt % 238U. This facility is now
operating with a reference fuel composition of 72-16-12
mole %; electroanalytical measurements are in progress.

Initial attempts to obtain electroanalytical data on
the circulating salt were complicated by various convec-
tive modes of mass transfer to the electrode surface,
namely, vibrations from the pump motor and thermal
gradients near the electrode. Reasonably good data
were obtained when the circulation was temporarily
interrupted for the measurements. In the near future,
an electrode assembly will be installed with special fea-
tures to eliminate or minimize the problems encoun-

52

tered in obtaining reliable measurements during circula-
tion of the melt.

Many electroanalytical measurements were made
throughout the operating period of April 18 to October
24, 1974. These measurements have provided our first
experience in the voltammetric analysis of thorium-
bearing fuels, and the data provide a basis for compari-
son with electroanalytical measurements being made in
the reference fuel salt, LiF-BeF,-ThF,; (72-16-12 mole
%), which has a significantly higher “free fluoride’ con-
centration.

As reported earlier,! qﬁalitative differences are
evident between electrochemical behavior in this fuel
solvent and in the more familiar MSRE compositions
(LiF-BeF,-ZrF;). One of the more significant differ-
ences was an apparent improvement in the resolution
between the chromium and uranium reduction waves.
Because of the absence of zirconium in the thorium-
bearing fuel, a higher cathodic limit is observed, and the
reduction wave for U3 + 3e™ =U0C can be observed if
the potential is scanned a few hundred millivolts
beyond the U* reduction wave.

Under conditions of minimized convection and rea-
sonably fast scan rates (0.1 to 0.5 V/sec), voltam-
mograms are obtained which exhibit a shape closely
resembling the theoretical shape for the reversible U** +
e~ < U* reduction. A typical wave of this sort has been
illustrated previously.! Not all the waves used for the
calculation of U**/U> ratios were close to ideal, and
hence many were not easily interpretable. The method
used for the calculation of the U**/U? ratio has been
reported previously.” Two points must be measured to
use this method: (1) the rest potential of the high-
impedance iridium quasi-reference electrode and (2) the

half-wave potential of the U** — U* couple. The first
point is the zero-current potential between two'iridium
electrodes, and the second point (half-wave potential) is
extracted from the uranium reduction wave generated
with linear-sweep voltammetry.

The precision of this method appears to be limited by
the assignment of half-wave potentials from the raw
data. In a potential-sweep experiment, the theoretical
half-wave potential is the point on the curve which
occurs at 85.2% of the peak height.® This is true only
for -reversible systems and does not include contribu-
tions to the current from sources other than the reduc-
tion or oxidation of the couple in question. In actu-
ality, curves are seldom ideal because charging currents
and extraneous Faradaic currents are included in the
total current responses. A more reliable method for
obtaining half-wave potentials from nonideal curves is
to choose the potentials at the midpoint between the
peak potentials of the cathodic and anodic peaks. Such
a treatment makes the reasonable assumption that the
shift in the.peak potentials occurs to the same extent
(but in opposite directions) for both the cathodic and
the anodic waves. In the ideal case, the half-wave poten-
tial is midway between the peak potentials. In the treat-
ment of these data, the half-wave potentials were
assigned using the two methods outlined above. In addi-
tion, a theoretical point was chosen about 50 mV more
negative than the derivative-wave peak potential. Half-
wave potentials for each curve were computed by these
three methods; the bisection method gave the more

(1964).

53

consistent results. Whenever the curves approached
ideality, all three methods yielded potentials in good
agreement with each other (about 5 mV).

 Data obtained during the six-month operation with
the experimental fuel melt have been evaluated for
U*/U3 ratios, and the calculated ratios are recorded as
a function of time (Fig: 6.1). The data in this figure can
best be considered in four. sections: (1) the initial
period of 40 to SO days during which attempts were
made to make measurements in circulating melts (there
were frequent variations in loop operation interspersed
with maintenance shutdowns), (2) a period of about
three weeks during which the ratio was deliberately
adjusted by the addition of beryllium metal, (3) an
interval of essentially steady-state operation (50
days), and (4) a terminal period during which'additions
of nickel fluoride were made to reoxidize the fuel.

The initial period is characterized by widely scattered
data, which can be interpreted only as general trends. In
view of the quality of many of the voltammograms
recorded in the interval, this scatter must in large part
be attributed to the analytical method. Initially the fuel
was quite oxidizing (U**/U3 ratio about 10%, perhaps
the upper limit of the method); the ratio was rapidly
reduced to about 10% by reactions with the loop
metals, principally chromium. On continued operation
the ratio underwent a gradual decrease, with a concur-
rent increase in the height of the observed chromium
wave. When the ratio had decreased to about 3000 and
the chromium wave had become quite pronounced,
incremental beryllium additions began.

These additions were made using beryllium foil speci-
mens of sequentially increasing weight calculated to

yield an unambiguous decrease in the ratio. The speci-
mens were crimped in a loop of platinum-rhodium wire

which was welded to a rod that could be inserted-

through a Teflon bushing on the sampling port. An
effort was made to avoid shorting the support rod to
the apparatus, so that contact of the specimen with the
fuel could be detected electrically; however, in most
cases the support rod was inadvertently shorted to the
loop either during insertion or through vibration when
circulation was started. The beryllium specimens were
inserted 1 to 2 in. below the quiescent fuel surface,
circulation was resumed, and the progress of the reduc-
tion was followed, qualitatively, during the next few
hours by voltammetric measurements. Although the
effects of stirring and vibration mentioned earlier pre-
cluded me asurements of the uranium wave, shifts in the
position of the distinct two-electron chromium wave
could be detected.

Potentiometric measurements of the melt using the
reference electrode vs the beryllium support rod and vs
the loop structure were made for some of the reduction
steps. It was observed that when the beryllium was
shorted to the loop, reduction took place smoothly and
rapidly to ostensible completion in 2 to 4 hr. On one
occasion when the support rod was electrically isolated
from the structure, reduction slowed to an undetectable
rate but accelerated when the rod was deliberately
shorted. An electrically isolated beryllium specimen
assumed a potential >1 V negative to the melt. When
the specimen was connected to the loop structure, the
potential decreased to a value less than 100 mV, so that
the potential of the fuel was positive to both the walls
of the loop and the beryllium specimen. Therefore, it is
evident that the bulk of the reaction occurred by elec-
trolytic reduction of U*" at the inner walls of the loop
rather than by direct chemical reaction at the beryl-
lium, which would be rate-limited by transport of U**
to the small surface of the metal specimen. Although no
further reduction could be detected after 4 hr, the sup-
port wire was left in place for at least 24 hr to ensure
quantitative reaction with residual beryllium or its
reduction products.

The results of beryllium additions are shown in Fig.
6.2, an enlargement of a section of Fig. 6.1. The overall
curve in this region resembles a titration curve, and
indeed the reduction experiments represent an uncom-
mon potentiometric titration. An examination of
detailed response to addition reveals a reasonably con-
sistent pattern (after the third reductant addition) of an
immediate decrease in ratio (reduction of fuel) followed
by a slow increase in the ratio toward recovery of the
initial value. With some license taken in connecting

sparse data points, the tendency toward recovery can be
interpreted as approaching a new steady-state value
within a period of several days. Regrettably, the time
between additions was not enough to achieve steady-
state ratios, nor was the frequency or precision of the
measurements sufficient to permit mathematical anal-
ysis of the observed recovery regions. The recovery can
be readily explained by the oxidation of U by Cr**,
but the slow nature of the recovery may reflect hetero-
geneous reactions involving either the loop walls or
particulate metal in the fuel.

reduction steps. For each reduction the unshaded bar

Fig. 6.3. Yield of U%* from beryllium additions to MSBR fuel,

from the increments in ratio and the total equivalents
of uranium in the loop). Low yields in the early reduc-
tions were expected because at high ratios the beryllium
is largely consumed by strong oxidants such as Fe®*.
For the intermediate additions, stoichiometric reduc-
tion was obtained within the precision of this method.
The low yield in the last reduction can be attributed to
consumption of beryllium by chromous ions. A
decrease in ionic chromium concentration was evident
from voltammograms but has not yet been quantified.
The overall yield of the additions was 85%. Thus, the
results of the reduction experiments show that the pre-
sent method for determining the U*/U3" ratio is also
reliable in thorium-bearing breeder fuels and needs only
to be optimized for maximum sensitivity and precision.

During the third period, of less eventful operation,
the data are more consistent, with an estimated overall
precision of measurement of about 10%. This value may
not fairly represent the reproducibility of the analytical
measurements, however, because some of the variations
may reflect changes in ratio with minor changes in loop
operating conditions, for example, temperature, AT
operations, etc. In earlier measurements, made in a
thermal-convection loop under more favorable condi-
tions, a precision of about 2% was obtained.* A final
plotting of the most probable ratio in the fuel and final
evaluation of the measurement will be delayed until a
comparison of in-line analytical data with the operating
history of the loop can be made.

During the fourth period of operation, three NiF,
additions were made. An expected oxidation of the fuel
(increase in U*/U*" ratio) occurred, followed by a
relatively slow reduction (Fig. 6.1). Again it may be
necessary to evoke heterogeneous reactions to explain
this slow recovery. It is doubtful that quantitative inter-
pretations can be made for these additions, because the
NiF, reagent was so finely subdivided that it is not
possible to be sure that all of it mixed or reacted quan-
titatively with fuel.

We are now attempting to interpret the data from
these measurements for chromium concentrations.
These concentrations will be used to test electron
balances during recovery- periods after the additions of
reductants and oxidants (e.g., check the agreement with
stoichiometry of the reaction 2U3* + Cr?* 2 2U* +
Cr0 during these periods). In addition, an estimate of
the equilibrium quotient will be made for the above
reaction, and the data will be examined for evidence of
Cr, 0, formation® in oxidizing melts. Quantitative
interpretation of the chromium data is complicated by
interference from the adjacent uranium wave, variation
in the area of the working electrode, low tolerance of
stripping methods to disturbances in the melt, and
absence of basic experimental data such as diffusion
coefficients in the thorium-bearing breeder fuels.

The loop FCL-2b has been recharged with fuel of the
reference composition LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole
%) vs (68-20-12 mole %) used in the original study. At
this time, no efforts have been made to adjust the redox
condition of the fuel, and voltammetric measurements
are being made on a weekly basis. Immediately after the
loop was filled on February 10, the fuel was oxidizing
(ratio 7 X 10%); however, the U**/U3" ratio has dimin-
ished to about 2 X 102, presumably by reaction with
chromium in the walls of the loop or in the specimens.
Measurements are also being made on the fuel in two
thermal-convection loops, NCL-21 and NCL-23. In
NCL-21, which was fabricated from Hastelloy N and
had been operated with MSRE fuel salt previously,
there has been little indication of reaction. The U**/U%*
ratio was about 200 initially and decreased during the
first month to about 28, where it appeared to stabilize.
About a week after Inconel specimens were inserted, a
second trend of reduction was evident, and the ratio is
now approaching 10. This melt is now one of the most
reducing so far, and it may well be approaching the
applicable limit of this voltammetric method.

6.2 ELECTROANALYTICAL STUDIES OF

BISMUTH IN MOLTEN LiF-BeF,-ZrF,

G. Mamantov®  D. L. Manning -

Voltammetric studies of bismuth in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, (65.6-29.4-5.0 mole %) were continued
to ascertain the lower limits of detection by linear-scan
voltammetry and anodic stripping techniques. This
study is directed toward determining the feasibility of
making in-line measurements of traces of bismuth in the
return stream from processing systems, As indicated
previously,” bismuth is slowly lost from the melt, at
least in part, by volatilization, presumably as BiF;.

Because nickel is an anticipated interference, the
effect of nickel on the bismuth voltammograms was
determined while enough bismuth (approximately 5
millimolar) remained to produce well-defined curves.
Nickel as NiF, was added to give an Ni?* concentration
of 15 millimolar. Voltammograms were recorded at
gold, iridium, and glassy carbon electrodes. At the three
electrodes, the reduction of bismuth occurs first at
approximately —0.05 V, followed by nickel at about
—0.25 V vs a quasi-reference electrode (QRE). Thus,
the peak potentials are separated by about 200 mV,
which, although not ideal, warrants investigation at
lower concentration levels. In general, the best resolu-
tion, deﬁnlition', and reproducibility are obtained at the
gold electrode. However, on reverse scans, a single strip-
ping peak is observed at gold, which may correspond to
the oxidation of a Bi-Ni alloy.

Voltammograms showing the reduction of bismuth in
the presence of nickel.at an iridium electrode are shown
in Fig. 6.4. For the upper curve, the melt contained
approximately 500 ppm Bi** and 240 ppm Ni*". The
nickel wave is pborly defined; however, two clearly
separated stripping peaks were obtained on reverse
scans. The first peak could correspond to the oxidation
of Ni or possibly Ni-Bi alloy, and the second peak corre-
sponds to stripping bismuth from the electrode. When
the scan is started at an initial potential of about +0.4 V
vs Ir QRE, a small prewave is seen, which, although not
yet completely understood, is believed to result from
the adsorption of bismuth at the electrode surface. The
second voltammogram corresponds to about 10 ppm
Bi®* and 240 ppm Ni?*. The bismuth reduction wave
has practically disappeared, and only one stripping peak

(largely 'due to nickel) is present. The prewave, which is
shown on an expanded scale in the lower curve, did not
change significantly.

The slow loss of bismuth from the melt at 600°C was
followed voltammetrically; the concentration decreased
from approximately 400 to about 7 ppm in 40 days.
This is about the lowest concentration that can be
measured by direct linear-scan voltammetry. Anodic
stripping techniques were used for measurements at
lower concentrations. By plating bismuth under con-
trolled conditions of time, potential, etc., onto glassy
carbon at a potential sufficiently cathodic to reduce
Bi(III) but not Ni(Il), and then scanning the potential
anodically, the bismuth is stripped from the electrode,
and the peak height of the anodic stripping curve is a

function of the concentration of bismuth (Fig. 6.5).
Calibration of the anodic stripping method was
achieved by comparing the peak height of the stripping
curves to the concentration of bismuth calculated from
voltammetry and by assuming linearity at lower bis-
muth concentrations. The peak height of the stripping
curves is approximately a linear function of plating time
(Fig. 6.5). The concentration of bismuth during con-
tinued loss from the melt was followed with this tech-
nique to sub-ppm (<25 ppb) amounts by employing
plating times of about 30 min. Longer plating times
were not practical, due to small signal-to-noise ratios.
Also, at longer plating times, the interference of nickel
Is more severe. '

The prewave observed at the iridium electrode did not
change appreciably until the bismuth concentration
decreased below ~v1 ppm; then the prewave decreased
markedly but not linearily with bismuth concentration.
In fact, a small prewave is still observed although the
bismuth concentration is below detection by anodic
stripping. This prewave may prove of value, possibly as
a qualitative indicator of bismuth.

Additional anodic stripping studies will be made on
reference fuel-salt solutions having low bismuth concen-
trations but with no nickel.

electrode. As indicated previously,' ® the wave seems to
be directly proportional to the NaBF;OH content of
the melt. The anodic voltammogram is well defined
(Fig. 6.6). However, noise is encountered on the
diffusion-current plateau, which usually indicates gas
formation at the electrode surface. The wave is also
irreversible; no reverse current is seen at the scan rate of
0.1 V/sec (Fig. 6.6). This is also true at much faster (20
V/sec) scan rates. Further scan-rate studies revealed that
the electrode reaction also exhibits catalytic complica-
tions whereby the reagent is regenerated at the elec-
trode surface. For reversible and irreversible charge
transfers in the absence of catalytic complications, plots
of ip/vll2 vs v (where I,, is the peak current and v is the
scan rate) consist of horizontal lines. For the catalytic
case, the ip[vll 2 values are large at the slower scan rates
(<0.1 V/sec) and usually level off at fast scans (>10
V/sec). For the anodic wave in fluoroborate, the
ip/vll'2 values (Fig. 6.7) continuously decreased with
scan rate (up to 100 V/sec). This indicates that the rate
of regeneration of the reagent is extremely fast. The

Part 3. Materials Development
H. E. McCoy

The main thrust of this materials program is toward
the development of a structural material for the MSBR
primary circuit which has adequate resistance to embrit-
tlement by neutron irradiation and to intergranular
cracking by fission product penetration. A modified
composition of Hastelloy N containing 2% Ti has good
resistance to irradiation embrittlement, but some ques-
tion remains whether it has sufficient resistance to
intergranular cracking. Numerous laboratory tests are in
progress to answer this important question. It may be
necessary to further modify the alloy with rate-earth,
niobium, or higher chromium additions to impart better
resistance to intergranular cracking.

Laboratory programs to study Hastelloy N-—salt—
tellurium interactions are being established including
methods for exposing test materials under simulated
reactor operating conditions. Surface-analysis capa-
bilities are being improved so that the reaction products
can be identified.

The procurement of products from two commercial
heats (8000 and 10,000 lb) of 2% Ti modified Hastel-
loy N has continued. Many products have been

59

obtained and much experience gained in learning to
fabricate the new alloy. The products will be used in all
phases of the materials program.

The work on chemical-processing materials is concen-
trating on graphite. Capsule tests are in progress to
study possible chemical interactions between graphite
and bismuth-ithium solutions and to evaluate the
mechanical intrusion of those solutions into the graph-
ite. Since the solubility of graphite in bismuth-lithium
solutions seems to increase with increasing lithium
concentration, a molybdenum thermal-convection loop
that contains graphite specimens has been started to
study mass transfer in Bi—2.5% Li.

Much of the effort during this reporting period was in
reestablishing test facilities. Two thermal-convection
loops are in operation in the new loop facility, which
will accommodate at least ten loops. The mechanical
property and general test facility is partially opera-
tional, but numerous test fixtures remain to be assem-
bled and tests started. An air lock has been added to the
general test facility to make it more functional.

7. Development of Modified Hastelloy N
H. E. McCoy

This program is for developing metallic structural
material(s) for an MSBR. The current emphasis is on
the development of a material for the primary circuit,
since this appears to be the most important problem at

the present time. The material for the primary circuit -

will be exposed to a modest thermal-neutron flux and
to fuel salt that contains fission products. Probably, a
modification of standard Hastelloy N will be a satisfac-
tory material for this application. An alloy that
contains 2% Ti seems to adequately resist irradiation
embrittlement, but it remains to be demonstrated
whether this alloy satisfactorily resists intergranular
embrittlement by fission product tellurium. Small
amounts of niobium and rare earths (e.g., cerium,
lanthanum) also improve the resistance to intergranular
cracking and likely will not reduce the beneficial effects
of titanium from the neutron-embrittlement stand-
point. Currently, factors associated with production of
the 2% Ti alloy in commercial quantities are being
studied, while smaller heats are being made of alloys
containing both 2% Ti and additions of Nb and rare
earths. These materials are being evaluated in several
ways.

Two large heats, one 10,000 1b and the other 8,000
Ib, of the 2% Ti modified alloy have been melted by a
commercial vendor. Product shapes including plate, bar,
and wire have been obtained for use in several parts of
the program. Tubing is currently being produced by
two independent routes. These products are being used
to fabricate the salt-contacting portions of two forced-
circulation loops.

Laboratory methods for studying Hastelloy N—salt—
tellurium reactions are under development. Methods
must be developed for exposing candidate structural
materials to simulated reactor operating conditions.
Essential to this program are adequate techniques for
identifying and characterizing the reaction products.
Several methods for the analysis of surfaces are under
development.

Materials determined to resist intergranular cracking
in laboratory tests will be exposed to fissioning salt in
the Oak Ridge Research Reactor TeGeu fuel-capsule
series. Three materials (standard Hastelloy N, Inconel
601, and type 304 stainless steel) were irradiated in the
first TeGen experiment and are currently being ex-
amined. Additional capsules are being prepared.

7.1 PROCUREMENT AND FABRICATION
OF EXPERIMENTAL ALLOYS

T. K. Roche B.McNabb J.C. Feltner

7.1.1 Production Heats

Two production heats, one 10,000 and one 8000 1b,
of 2% Ti modified Hastelloy N have been produced by
an outside vendor. Plate, bar, wire, and tubing con-
verted from these heats will be used for experimental
work, with a principal use being the construction of
two forced-circulation loops for studying the compati-
bility of the alloy with fuel salt.

Both heats were double melted by vacuum induction
melting followed by electroslag remelting. Chemical
analyses of the heats are shown in Table 7.1. Some
difficulty was experienced with the hot workability of
the first heat, heat 2810-4-7901 (or 74901), in that
some edge cracking was noted on forging the ingot to a
10- by 19-in. slab. Subsequent forging of a portion of
this slab to S5-in.-thick sheet bar and then rolling to 2-,
1-, %-, and Y-in.-thick plate resulted in products
having both edge and surface cracks. The balance of the
10 X 19 in. slab was reforged to 4 X 4 in. round-
cornered square bar and S-in.-diam round bar. The
temperature for these hot-working operations was
approximately 1200°C. Further conversion work on

" this heat was held up at this stage, and a sample of

'hp-in-thick plate was obtained from the vendor for
evaluation.

The %-in.-thick plate with its attendant surface
cracks can be seen in Fig. 7.1. A metallographic section
revealed that most of the cracks were 5 to 15 mils deep.
The piece of % -in.-thick plate from heat 2810-4-7901
was cut into two pieces, approximately 3 X 12 in., for a
restrained weld test and into %-in. square strips. The
strips were swaged to %,- and Y-in.-diam weld wire
and Y -in.-diam rod for preparation of mechanical
property and Gleeble test specimens. Gleeble tests
determine the tensile ductility of an alloy under
conditions of temperature and strain rate that approxi-
mate hot-working operations such as forging and
rolling, and are useful for defining limits of the
hot-working temperature range. Gleeble specimens
given a prior anneal at 1177°C were tested over the
61

temperature range 982 to 1260°C at a speed of §
in./sec. The results of post-test ductility (reduction in
area) measurements are compared with data obtained
on specimens of standard Hastelloy N tested under the
same conditions (Fig. 7 The curve for standard
Hastelloy N is relatively flat with fairly high values of
ductility between 982 and 1177°C, indicative of a
broad hot-working temperature range and good
fabricability. Heat 2810-4-7901 of 2% Ti-modified

Hastelloy N exhibits a peak in ductility between 1093
and 1177°C with a sharp ductility decrease below
1093°C, indicating a narrow hot-working temperature
range for this particular heat. Although the cause for
this behavior is unknown, it is probably related in one
way or another to melting practice.

The previously rolled 2-, 1-, and ":-in.-thick plate,
which showed cracking, was conditioned by surface
grinding and rerolled in the temperature range of
maximum ductility to thicknesses of 1, %, and Y% in.,
respectively. Fabricability was improved, but some edge
cracking was still evident. The rerolled plate yielded a
usable product which has been received.

Upset forgings were substituted for 2-in.-thick plate.
Segments of billet stock cut from the previously forged
4 X 4 in. round-cornered square bar were upset at
1121°C by the vendor to obtain approximately 2%-in.-
thick forgings. The forgings, 8 to 11 in. in diameter and
2% in. thick (Fig. 7.3), had very minor edge cracks, in
the center of each face was a 4- to 6-in.-diam cracklike
defect outlining the ends of the starting billet. This
sed by “die lock,” that is, friction between
the press tooling and the billet that prevents the billet

defect is ca

ends from moving laterally during forging and results in
a fold. In the case of these forgings the depth of the
fold was % in. or less and was readily removed while
machining the forgings to a thickness of 2 in. A chord
was cut from four of the forgings by the vendor for
determination of room-temperature tensile properties.
The forgings are of sul

ient size for machining pump
irculation loops.

-in-diam forged bar
was further forged to 4-in. round-cornered square to
provide starting stock for bar-mill rolling. A pilot run

demonstrated that bar stock could be rolled with care
down to about a l-in. diameter at 1149°C, but for
smaller diameters apparently chilling action by the rolls
caused excessive cracking — predictable from the
Gleeble data previously reported. Therefore, an attempt
was made to produce small-diameter bar (% and
5 6-in. diameter) and wire (Y- and % -in. diameter) by
cold drawing of approximately 1-in.-diam bar with

intermediate annealing treatments at 1177°C. This
approach was only marginally successful, because the
drawn bar was found to be susceptible to stress-induced
annealing cracks. This problem was partially solved by
either of two ways: flexing of the drawn product in
straightening equipment prior to annealing at 1177°C,
or lowering the intermediate annealing temperatiife to
1121°C.

A significant quantity of material was consumed in
establishing the processing parameters for producing bar
and wire, and only a small quantity of '%- and
% ¢-in.-diam bar and ¥%,-in-diam weld wire was
received from this first heat. However, the requirement
for 100 ft of 1-in.-diam bar and 30 ft of 1%-in.-diam
bar was met. The flow diagram summarizes the process
routing for heat 28104-7901 (Fig. 7.4).

The second heat (8918-5-7421) has been scheduled
for conversion to tubing, round bar, and wire (Fig. 7.5).
To date, fabrication has progressed smoothly with no
cracking during hot working or during annealing after
cold working as experienced with the first heat. The
processing parameters developed for the first heat are
being used for the second heat.

Gleeble data for the second heat were obtained by the
vendor on specimens taken from 4-in.-square forged
bar. The results are compared with the earlier data from
the first heat (Fig. 7.6). The much broader temperature
range of high ductility for the second heat suggests that
greater latitude in processing parameters is permissible
and that the fabrication problems encountered with the
first heat are not inherent to the basic alloy composi-
tion but were peculiar to that specific heat.

The tubing to be produced from the second heat
presents a scheduling problem in that the vendor will be
assisted by two other conversion sources, one for
trepanning the billet stock and the other for drawing to
final size. This results in a long projected delivery time.
To shorten this time, a forged bar 4 X 4 X 60 in. will be
processed by an alternate route to produce at least the

7.1.2 Semiproduction Heats

Six semiproduction heats of 2% Ti modified Hastelloy
N, four of which contain rare-earth additions (lantha-
num, cerium, or misch metal), have been included in
the alloy evaluation program. These alloys will test the
effectiveness of rare-earth additions as gettering ele-
ments for tellurium to minimize shallow intergranular
cracking. Each alloy was a 120-lb double-melted
(vacuum induction plus electroslag remelt) heat pro-
duced by an outside vendor. The compositions of the
alloys are shown in Table 7.2. Because the aluminum
content of heats 74533, 74534, 74535, and 74539 was
somewhat higher than the specified 0.15% maximum,
two heats, 74557 and 74558, were produced with much
less aluminum.

The 4-in.-diam ingot of each alloy was forged to a
2-in.-thick slab at 1177°C, then hot rolled to %-in.-
thick plate at the same temperature. A portion of the
plate product from each of the heats is shown in Figs.
7.7 and 7.8. The fabricability of heats 74533, 74534,
74535, and 74539 was better than that of heats 74557
and 74558, which exhibited profuse edge cracking.
There is an apparent connection between the aluminum
content of the alloys and their fabricability which may
be real; but factors such as melting environment, type
and quantity of other malleabilizing additions made to
the alloy, and timing of these additions during the

melting operation can also significantly influence fabri-

Gleeble evaluation tests were performed on heats
74533 and 74557 over the temperature range 982 to
1260°C (Fig. 7.9). The results are consistent with
fabrication experience in that heat 74533 showed
excellent ductility between 982 and 1200°C, and the
ductility of heat 74557 fell off sharply above 1150°C.
Both alloys were hot worked at 1177°

Current studies on the semiproduction heats include

weldability and the measurement of mechanical prop-
erties in the irradiated and unirradiated conditions.
Weld wire and mechanical-property-specimen stock
were obtained by swaging strips cut from the Y-in.-
thick plate. Tubular specimens have been machined
from heats 74533 and 74534 for future fuel-capsule
studies. In addition, an attempt is being made to
process welded and drawn tubing of heats 74533,
74534, 74535, and 74539 to provide specimen stock
for strain-cycle and in-reactor fueled-capsule testing.
The tube blanks were produced by rolling %-in.-thick
plate to 0.140-in.-thick strips and then cold forming the
sheet into semicircular (clamshell) shapes. The seams of
pairs of the clamshells were closed by electron-beam

welding, and the blanks are now ready for drawing.

7.1.3 Laboratory Heats

Earlier work has shown that niobium additions to
titanium-modified Hastelloy N enhance resistance to
tellurium embrittlement. Aluminum is also an impor-
tant addition to these alloys, since it is often used as a
deoxidizer during melt preparation. However, Nb, Ti,
and Al can combine with Ni
compounds causing embrittlement of the alloy. There-
fore, laboratory heats based nominally upon Ni—12%
Mo—7% Cr with varying Nb, Ti, Al, and C contents are
being studied to determine the concentrations of these
elements that can be added before precipitation of
intermetallic compounds occurs.

The alloys (Table 7.3) were prepared at ORNL as
l-in.-diam, 24b ingots by arc-melting and drop-casting
techniques. The ingots were worked to %-in.-diam rod
by hot swaging at 1177°C from the l-in. diameter to
approximately 0.437-in. diameter and then to final size
by cold swaging using intermediate anneals at 1177°C.

Solution-annealed specimens of the alloys have been
subjected to aging heat treatments between 650 and

to form intermetallic

7.2 WELDABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ALLOYS
OF MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

B. McNabb H. E. McCoy T. K. Roche

As shown by the successful operation of the MSRE,
Hastelloy N is fabricable and weldable to quality levels
required for nuclear reactors. Modified compositions of
Hastelloy N with improved resistance to radiation
damage and tellurium embrittlement must also fulfill
these requirements for use in an MSBR. Six smail
semiproduction heats (120 1b) and two large production
heats (8000 and 10,000 Ib) of modified Hastelloy N
containing approximately 2% Ti, with and without
small rare-earth additions, have been received from an
outside vendor. The chemical analyses of these heats are
shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.

The six small heats were each received in the form of
four pieces of ‘-in.-thick plate approximately 5 in.
wide by approximately 24 in. long in the rolling
direction. One plate of each heat was cut in half and the
edges beveled to give a 100° included angle when placed

68

together for welding, thus yielding a finished welded
plate approximately 10 in. wide by 12 in. long. Strips
% in. by % in. by 12 in. long were sawed from one
plate of each heat, the corners were rounded, and the
bars swaged to Y% in. in diameter for mechanical
property tests. Some of this %-in.-diam rod was further
swaged to '%- and 3%,-in.-diam weld wire for auto-
genous welding of the prepared weld plates. Inter-
mediate anneals at 870°C in air during swaging stress-
relieved the material, and sand blasting removed the
oxide after swaging. The weld wire was electro-
chemically cleaned and the prepared plates were
cleaned with acetone before welding.

The first product received of the 10,000-1b heat
(74901) was a plate approximately % in. thick, 6 in.
wide, and 24 in. in the cross-rolled direction. This plate
was cut into two pieces, each approximately 3 X 12 in.,
and the remainder into '%-in.square strips for fabri-
cation of wire and rod. The plate and wire were
prepared for welding by the same procedure as the
small heats.

Prior to the weld test, plates were welded to a
4-in.-thick steel strongback to achieve a restrained
condition. All welds were made by ORNL Welding
Procedure WPS 1402. Each pass was visually inspected,
and the first, third, and final weld passes were inspected
with dye penetrant. A wire brush was used as needed to
clean the surface between passes. Weld wire having a
diameter of %, in. was used for the root and next two
passes, and Y%-in.-diam wire was used for the approxi-
mately 20 remaining passes. The root, second, and
fourth passes were made with the weld plates at room

- temperature; the other interpass temperatures averaged

about 93°C. The root pass was made at approximately
14 V and 85 A, pass No. 2 at 110 A, No. 3 at 115 A,
No. 4 at 17 V and 180 A, and the remainder of the
passes at 17 V and 190 A. After the welding, the plates
were x-rayed; no cracks or porosity was noted for any
of the plates. The welds were sound, with no cracking
found either visually or by dye-penetrant inspection.
Side-bend specimens % in. thick were sawed from the
welded plates and dressed down on each side with an
abrasive grinding wheel. These were then bent in a
Y%-in.-radius bend fixture and dye-penetrant-inspected
for cracks in the weld. Figure 7.11a is a photograph of
the tension side of two such side-bend specimens of
heat 74533 (modified Hastelloy N, 2.1% Ti—0.48% Al).
One specimen shows no flaws, and one has two small
indications at the edges but still should pass the
side-bend test, which allows open flaws up to %4 in.

tension side of two side-bend specimens of heat 74535
(modified Hastelloy N, 2.1% Ti—0.55% Al-0.04%

flaws, indicating that the addition of 0.04% rare earths
as misch metal has no adverse effect on the weld
properties.

Hastelloy N, 1.9% Ti—0.20% Al-0.03% Ce). Both
specimens ate free of flaws, indicating that 0.05% Ce in
this alloy has no adverse effects on the weld properties.
Figure 7.12b is a photograph of the tension side of
bend specimens of heat 74557 (modified Hastelloy N,
approximately 2% Ti—0.02 Al). Although this heat had
relatively poor hot workability, it appears to have
acceptable weld properties, as only a very small flaw is
shown on each of the side-bend specimens. Figure 7.12¢

is a photograph of the tension side of two side-bend

specimens of heat 74558 (modified Hastelloy N, 2.1%
Ti—0.02% Al—0.02% La). Both specimens are free of
flaws, indicating that the small lanthanum addition is
not detrimental. Darker areas on the specimens were
caused by spalling of the thicker dye-penetrant devel-
oper after it had dried.

Figure 7.13q is a photograph of the tension side of
side-bend specimens of heat 74901 (10,000-b heat).
There are some small flaws near the root pass on both
specimens, which are oriented differently. One of the
specimens was examined metallographically, and a
typical photomicrograph is shown in Fig. 7.13b6. This
photomicrograph shows some grain-boundary separa-
tion in the weld area, although the weldment was still
quite strong. Another side-bend specimen was given a
post-weld anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C in argon before
bending. There were some small dye indications on the
bend specimen. Even though the sample appeared
ductile, there was some localized grain-boundary separa-
tion (Fig. 7.13¢).

Heat 74901 appears to have lower weld ductility than
some of the other heats, but considerable deformation
can be accommodated without massive failure. The
grain-boundary separations are localized and do not
propagate in a catastrophic manner (as in sudden brittle
fracture). Tensile specimens tested at 25°C had ultimate
tensile strengths of 109,000 and 110,000 psi, elonga-
tions of 30% in a 1-in. gage length, and reduction in
area of 35 and 40%. Mechanical property specimens are
being prepared from the six semiproduction and first
commercial heats for further evaluation of tensile and
creep properties of welds in both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions.

7.3. STABILITY OF VARIOUS
TITANIUM-MODIFIED HASTELLOY N ALLOYS

T. K. Roche D.N. Braski J. C. Feltner

Additions of Nb, Ti, and Al to modified Hastelloy N
enhance resistance to tellurium-induced intergranular
cracking, improve resistance to radiation embrittlement,
and deoxidize the alloy, respectively. However, excess
amounts of these elements can cause aging reactions by
the precipitation of 7'-Ni3(AlTi) or NizNb. These
precipitates can cause hardening and loss of ductility.
As a first approach toward determining the limits to
which these elements can be tolerated in modified
Hastelloy N before encountering intermetallic precipita-
tion, specimens of the alloys whose compositions are
shown in Table 7.3, together with specimens from the
first production heat and one semiproduction heat
(heats 74901 and 74533), were given aging heat
treatments at 650, 704, and 800°C for up to 1000 hr.
Their respective tendencies to form gamma prime are
being evaluated by post-aging hardness measurements.
Presently, 100-hr aging data have been obtained (Table
7.4). The data for alloys that show significant hardening
relative to the as-annealed condition have been blocked
off in the tabulation. The data suggest the following
important trends: '

1. As expected, carbon is an effective hardening
addition. This can be seen by comparing the data for
several of the pairs of alloys, namely, heats 427 and
428,429 and 430, 431 and 432, and 433 and 434.

2. For alloys that do not contain niobium, about
2.0% Ti plus 0.5% Al can be present before gamma-
prime precipitation occurs. Increasing the titanium
content to about 2.5% with 0.34% Al results in

‘hardening (Table 7.4) and in gamma-prime precipitation

(Fig. 7.14).

3. For alloys containing about 2% Ti, no more than
about 1% Nb and 0.1% Al can be added before aging
occurs at 650°C. Increasing the alloy content to 1.5%
Nb and 0.25% Al broadens the aging temperature range
to 704°C.

4. Aging occurs at 650, 704, and 800°C when the
niobium content is increased to 3% with about 2% Ti
and 0.25% Al present.

Limited microstructural analyses using transmission
electron microscopy and selected-area diffraction tech-
niques have correlated the hardness data with the
precipitation reactions in the alloys. Heat 430 after
aging 100 hr at 650°C shows a dispersion of fine
spherical gamma prime in the microstructure (Fig.
7.14). Metal carbide (MC) precipitates were also identi-
fied in grain boundaries. As shown in Fig. 7.15, a

This study will be continued by extending the agfng

of the alloys to determine the effects of aging on
strength and ductility.

7.4 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF
TITANIUM-MODIFIED HASTELLOY N ALLOYS
IN THE UNIRRADIATED CONDITION

T. K. Roche J.C. Feltner B.McNabb
The mechanical properties of the latest production

and semiproduction heats of 2% Ti modified Hastelloy

These data will serve as a reference for comparison with
the properties of standard and other modified Hastelloy
N alloys both in the unirradiated "and irradiated
conditions. Included in this work are the determination
of room- and elevated-temperature tensile properties
and of creep-rupture properties in air at 650, 704, and
760°C. Facilities will soon be completed for performing

creep-rupture and strain-cycle tests in fluoride salts.

The room-temperature tensile properties reported by
the vendor for specimens taken from the various mill
products received from the 10,000-b production heat
(74901) of 2% Ti modified Hastelloy N are compared
with data from three earlier semiproduction heats of
the same alloy and with typical data for standard
Hastelloy N (Table 7.5). The yield strengths of all heats
fall in the range of 43,000 to 53,000 psi; further testing
will be required to determine whether the differences
are significant. The ultimate strengths for the products
of the 10,000-lb heat are slightly less than those
determined for the earlier heats of the 2% Ti modified
alloy. The lower ultimate tensile strength is accom-
panied by a lower elongation; both properties may be a
reflection of fabrication history. The elongations of the

modified heats are greater than for standard Hastelloy
N. In general, the tensile properties of the 2% Ti
modified alloy are about the same as those of standard
Hastelloy N.

Data from creep-rupture tests in air are being
obtained on the latest heats of 2% Ti modified
Hastelloy N. Tests currently in progress are designed to
establish reference creep and stress-rupture curves at
650, 704, and 760°C. Specimens were obtained from
swaged rod of the various alloys and were annealed 1 hr
at 1177°C prior to test. Stress-rupture data obtained to

78

date are given in Table 7.6. These same data are
compared with stress-rupture curves for standard
Hastelloy N and a previous heat of 2% Ti-modified
Hastelloy N (Figs. 7.17 and 7.18). The newer heats of
2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N are essentially equivalent in
strength to the earlier heat, and there appear to be no
significant effects from the rare-earth additions to the
2% Ti-modified alloy. As determined from past work
and confirmed by the recent tests, the modified alloys
exhibit longer rupture lives than standard Hastelloy N
at both temperatures.

7.5 POSTIRRADIATION MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES OF MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

H. E. McCoy

Samples of the modified compositions of Hastelloy N
are irradiated in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor
(ORR) and subjected to postirradiation creep tests to
evaluate the influence of irradiation on the mechanical
properties. Samples of the heats shown in Tables 7.1,
7.2, and 7.7 have been irradiated under several condi-
tions and are ready for creep testing. Twelve in-cell
creep machines are available for this work. The test
matrices are fragmentary at this time.

Figure 7.19 shows the postirradiation stress-rupture
results at 650°C of several heats of Hastelloy N
containing nominally 2% titanium. The fracture strains
are shown by the individual data points. These samples
were irradiated at 650°C in the ORR poolside facility
to a thermal fluence of about 3 X 10?° neutrons/cm?.
The minimum creep rates (Fig. 7.20) for many of the
same tests indicate several important trends.

1. The variation in rupture lives for the heats is large
(more than a factor of 10 from the shortest to the
longest). The titanium concentrations vary from 1.4
to 2.2%, with alloy 471-583 containing the least and

alloy 474-533 the most, but the variations in rupture
life do not appear to be simply proportional to the
titanium concentration.

. Minimum creep rates vary by a factor of 10, but

generally less than the variation noted for the
rupture life.

. Both the rupture life and the minimum creep rate

vary considerably for the heats in the unirradiated
condition.

. The rupture life of each heat except 472-503 is

reduced by irradiation. The rupture life, minimum
creep rate, and fracture strain for this heat are
extremely good.

. The rupture lives and fracture strains of all other

heats are reduced by irradiation, but the extent of
reduction varies from heat to heat.

. The minimum creep rate does not appear to be

influenced by irradiation at lower stress levels, but
the minimum creep rate does appear to be increased
at the higher stress levels. Further analysis of the
individual curves will be required to conclude
whether this is a true effect.

. Heat 7 3-008 has the lowest fracture strains of all

heats evaluated. Electron microscopy has shown that
this heat has an inhomogeneous, generally coarse
carbide structure.

8. Three heats (474-534, 474-539, 474-535) contained
small additions of rare-earth elements, but the
postirradiation properties of these heats appear
equivalent to those of heat 474-533 from the same
series, which did not contain a rare-earth-element
addition. '

The data presented in Figs. 7.19 and 7.20 are for
samples irradiated at 650°C. It was shown previously
that irradiation at higher temperatures causes a further
decrease in the rupture life and strain.' This change is
associated with carbide coarsening and varies from heat
to heat. This subject can be dealt with more quantita-
tively after the completion of additional postirradiation
creep tests.

A number of tests have -been completed which
strongly suggest that the postirradiation creep prop-
erties of the titanium-modified alloys are sensitive to
the preirradiation annealing treatment. The post-
irradiation testing is not complete, and the data have

82

not been critically reviewed for errors, so it is difficult
to make firm conclusions yet. One of the more
complete sets of data is shown in Table 7.8 for
discussion. The preirradiation anneals at 1038 and
1093°C resulted in short rupture lives and fracture
strains generally less than 1%. Preirradiation annealing
at 1177°C resulted in some improvement in rupture life
and ductility. Annealing at 1204°C resulted in slightly
lower fracture strains, but the rupture life and mini-
mum creep rate were improved. Increasing the anneal-
ing temperature to 1260°C caused a dramatic decrease
in the rupture life at a given stress and a decrease in
fracture strain.

Although the trends discussed above are generally
supported by the data, there are some tests which do
not fit in this pattern. For example, there should be

the fracture strain of test R-1720 seems too low. More

7.6 MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF
TITANIUM-MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

D.N. Braski J. M. Leitnaker  G. A. Potter

This investigation was to determine why two
titanium-modified Hastelloy N heats, alloys 472-503
(503) and 471-114 (114), having virtually identical
compositions (Table 7.7), displayed such different
postirradiation creep properties. This problem was
approached by examining the microstructure of both
alloys in detail after furnace aging at 650, 704, and
760°C and after irradiation in the Oak Ridge Research
Reactor (ORR) for similar times and temperatures. The
reasoning behind this approach was that an under-
standing of the problem would be less difficult if the
effects of temperature and irradiation on the precipita-
tion processes in the alloys could be separated.

The electron microscopy of 503 and 114 aged at 650,
704, and 760°C has been reported previously.? In brief,
both alloys showed essentially the same development of
stacking-fault precipitates along {111} planes, with
some coarsening of the precipitates at the higher aging
temperatures. The sections immediately below describe
recent results from aging studies on unirradiated speci-
mens and electron microscopy examinations of irra-
diated samples.

7.6.1 Microstructure of Aged 503 and 114 Alloys

An electrochemical extraction technique® using a
solution of 10 parts of HCL in 90 parts of water
removed the precipitates from 503 and 114. After
extraction, the precipitates were weighed with a micro-
balance and then analyzed by x-ray diffraction and
x-ray fluorescence. The amounts of precipitate

extracted form 503 and 114 are given in Fig. 7.21. The
data plotted are values taken for a 4-hr extraction of
precipitates from the button head of tensile samples
that were aged for 1000 hr. A 4-hr cleaning extraction
was conducted previous to these runs to remove any
surface effects. The results show that a greater amount
of precipitate was extracted from 503 than 114 at all
three aging temperatures. This might be expected since
the 503 alloy contains more carbon. The amount of
precipitate formed in both alloys generally decreases
with increasing temperature. However, the experimental
values probably do not represent equilibrium amounts
of precipitate that will form at these temperatures.
Long-time aging studies of 503 and 114 are under way
which should help determine the equilibrium quantities.

In another experiment, precipitates were extracted
through the entire thickness of 503 and 114 samples
that had been aged at 650°C for 1000 hr. The
distribution of precipitates was not homogeneous (Fig.
7.22); in both alloys more precipitates were located in
the outer layers of the sample than in the central
region. The total weight percent of precipitates col-
lected across the sample was 0.62% for 503 and 0.56%
for 114. These results cast some doubt on the findings
in Fig. 7.21, where only one extraction near the outer
surface was considered. We can only speculate as to the
cause of the inhomogeneity in the two samples (Fig.
7.22), but it is possibly related to the processing of the
alloys from ingots to tensile specimens. The effects of
inhomogeneity on the performance of the alloys in a
reactor are also unknown. However, a later section of
this report (Sect. 7.6.3) shows that a uniform distribu-
tion of carbide precipitates in the microstructure

appears to be desirable for radiation resistance. There-
fore, these observed inhomogeneities will be further
investigated.

7.6.2 X-Ray Analysis of Precipitates

After the amounts of precipitates in 503 and 114
samples were determined using the extraction tech-
nique, the extracted particles were analyzed by x-ray
diffraction. The data showed that the precipitates
formed at all three temperatures and in both alloys
were face-centered cubic MC (metal carbide)-type car-
bides.oThé lattice parameters (@q) varied from 4.22 to
4.30 A depending on aging temperature. Generally, the
higher the aging temperature, the greater the lattice
parameter of the MC. This indicates that the composi-
tion of the MC particles depends to some extent on
aging temperature. There is also evidence that the
composition of MC may not be completely uniform for
any particular aging treatment. All of the MC peaks
formed upon aging at 650, 704, or 760°C were
asymmetric with “tailing” toward the higher 20 values.
Therefore the MC which precipitated out at these
temperatures fell within a range of compositions and
had latticg parameters that were all slightly smaller than
the 4.30-A value observed for primary MC.

The x-ray diffraction data showed an additional
difference between 503 and 114 - namely, extra lines
that could not be indexed as MC were found in the 503
alloy. The extra lines were not consistent from one
aging temperature to the next, so it was not possible to
relate them to any of the more obvious metal carbides.

84

However, it is still quite possible that a third phase
exists in the 503 alloy. There was also a possibility of
contamination (from the extraction process) causing
the extra lines, but this seems rather remote since no
extra lines were detected in MC extracted from the 114
alloy, which was processed identically.

The x-ray fluorescence data in Table 7.9 also show
some difference in precipitate composition between
503 and 114. Precipitates from both alloys contained
Mo, Ni, Ti, Cr, and Fe, but 503 also contained traces of
Nb, Zr, Pt, and Sr. Furthermore, the iron content was
always higher in the 503 precipitates. Although the
platinum and strontium may be contaminants (e.g.,
platinum from the specimen holder), the other extra
elements cannot be ignored. (Carbon cannot be
detected by the x-ray fluorescence techniques.) The
composition of MC in 503 is different from 114, and,
again, the existence of a third phase in 503 should not
be ruled out. Many of these questions will be answered
by quantitative elemental analysis of the precipitates.

7.6.3 Irradiation and Creep Testing
Tensile samples of the 503 and 114 alloys were

irradiated in the Oak Ridge Reactor (ORR run 226) for
1203 hr at 650, 704, and 760°C. The nominal fluence

alloy at the different irradiation temperatures was
designated for examination by transmission electron
microscopy. The remainder of the samples were creep
tested. The results of some of these tests are given in
Table 7.10. The 503 alloy demonstrated longer creep
rupture lives and larger total strains than the 114 at
every condition.

7.6.4 Microstructure of Irradiated
503 and 114 Alloys

The microstructures of 503 and 114 after irradiation,
but before creep testing, are shown in the electron
micrographs in Figs. 7.23—7.26. Figure 7.20 shows the
alloys after irradiation at 650°C. Both alloys contained
ribbons of stacking-fault precipitates of MC-type car-
bides, but the ribbon lengths were considerably shorter
than those observed in samples aged in furnaces at
similar times and temperatures.> Therefore, the neutron
irradiation must be hindering the stacking-fault precipi-
tation mechanism that was described originally by
Silcock and Tunstall.* Also present in both alloys were
thin MC platelets lying on {111} planes which usually
had dislocations associated with them. The dislocations
were probably produced as the matrix accommodated
the large lattice of the MC platelets. Not seen in the
micrograph were other large MC particles located in
grain boundaries and occasionally in the grain interiors.
These primary carbides were present after the alloy was
solution annealed 1 hr at 1177°C.

Figure 7.24 shows the alloys after irradiation at
704°C. Both micrographs were taken near grain bound-
aries to iltustrate the differences found between 503

Steels,” Philos. Mag. 10, 36089 (1964).

85

and 114 at this temperature. The 503 alloy contained
MC platelets that were distributed fairly evenly
throughout the matrix. However, precipitation in 114
was localized as large platelets or structures resembling
stacking-fault precipitate ribbons. The particles were
generally located near grain boundaries and primary MC
precipitates. ‘

After irradiation at 760°C the microstructures of 503
and 114 were quite similar to those for 704°C (Fig.
7.25). The 503 contained MC platelets within the grain
interiors (Fig. 7.22a), while the 114 had isolated MC
particles in the vicinity of primary MC precipitates (Fig.
7.256). The micrographs in Fig. 7.26 illustrate two

‘additional microstructural features. The first is shown

in a 503 sample irradiated at 760°C (Fig. 7.26a).
Besides the 0.2- to 0.5-um-diam platelets of MC already
discussed, particles that were approximately 200 Ain
diameter were dispersed throughout the 503 samples
irradiated at 760°C. It is not known at this time
whether the fine precipitate is simply MC that follows a
different nucleation and growth mechanism due to the
irradiation or whether there is a third phase present as
indicated by the x-ray analyses. The second observation
is a difference between the distribution of MC precipi-
tates in 503 and 114 near grain boundaries. In general, a
higher concentration of MC platelets was found near
grain boundaries in the 503 (Fig. 7.26a), while precipi-
tation near the primary MC particles effectively pro-
duced a denuding of MC at grain boundaries in 114
(Fig. 7.26b). .

The electron micrographs of irradiated 503 and 114
just presented have shown several marked differences in
microstructure that might help explain the differences
in postirradiation creep prbperties. Precipitates dis-
persed throughout a material can increase radiation
resistance, probably by tying up various impurities and
possibly by serving as sinks for helium produced during
irradiation.® The impurities and helium are thus pre-
vented from segregating at grain boundaries and causing
embrittlement of the material. Such a mechanism may
be operating in the case of the 503 alloy but not in the
114. Although precipitation of MC occurred in 114 it
was localized and consequently may have not been
effective in trapping impurities. The uniformly dis-
persed fine precipitates found in 503 after irradiation at

properties seem to improve with increasing irradiation

is a third phase or a different morphology of MC, its
presence could provide a more effective network of
sites for trapping impurities and helium.

7.7 SALT CORROSION STUDIES

J. R. Keiser J. R. DiStefano

Several hundred thousand hours of corrosion experi-
ence have now been accumulated with Hastelloy N and
fluoride salts in thermal-convection and forced-
circulation systems. This experience has shown that in
clean fluoride salts containing uranium the predominant
corrosion mechanism is the leaching of chromium from
Hastelloy N. Impurity fluorides such as FeF,, MoF,,
and NiF, will also react with chromium to form CrF,.
Water will react with the salt to form HF, which
oxidizes all metallic components of the alloy. In the
MSRE the overall corrosion of Hastelloy N was quite
low during almost four years at temperature, attesting
to the excellent corrosion resistance of this alloy in an
actual system. However, operation of the MSRE also
revealed that Hastelloy N was embrittled at grain

90

The experiments discussed in this section are being
conducted to determine the corrosion behavior of
regular and modified Hastelloy N as well as other
selected alloys in molten fluoride salts and to determine
the effect of tellurium in the fuel salt on the alloys.
These corrosion experiments include the use of
thermal-convection loops, a forced-circulation loop, and
the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility.

7.7.1 Status of Thermal-Convection Loop Program

The facility for operation of thermal-convection loop
tests is essentially complete. Two loop tests are cur-
rently in operation (Table 7.11), and six loop systems
are under construction. Two of the six loop systems
will use some components from previously operated
systems (18B and 22A), while the other four will be
completely new systems. All will have provisions for
electrochemical probe measurements to follow the
U(IV)/U(III) ratios of the circulating salt. Table 7.12

7.7.2 Fuel Salt Thermal-Convection Loop Results

The thermal-convection loop program is to (1)
develop electrochemical methods for evaluation of
corrosion data in molten salt systems, (2) study the
behavior of tellurium in molten salt systems and
determine its effect on potential MSBR containment
materials, and (3) evaluate the corrosion resistance of
Hastelloy N, modified Hastelloy N, and other potential
containment materials to the MSBR fuel salt LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF,; (72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %).

Thermal-convection loop 23 is constructed of Inconel
601, a material which shows resistance to tellurium-
induced grain-boundary embrittlement. However,
Inconel 601 has a high chromium content (23 wt %)
and is more susceptible to oxidation by UF,; than
Hastelloy N. During initial operation of loop 23,
electrochemical measurements were made at regular
intervals, and after 721 hr, corrosion insert specimens
were removed for examination. The results of the
electrochemical measurements (Sect. 6.1) indicate that
the U(IV)/U(III) ratio dropped rapidly after the salt
was put into the loop. The U(IV)/U(III) ratio was
initially above 10%, but after 15 min it was 200, and
after six days it was 40. A short time before the
specimens were removed, the ratio had decreased to
about 20. A decrease in the U(IV)/U(III) ratio of this
magnitude implied that extensive corrosion had occur-
red. Examination of the removable specimens verified
that the corrosion rate was indeed high. All the
specimens that were in the salt lost weight; those in the
hottest positions lost nearly [% of their initial weight.
Weight loss as a function of temperature and location is
shown in Fig. 7.27. Because of a malfunction of the
heaters, the temperature of the lower portion of the hot
leg was higher than the design temperature for a short
time. Consequently, the weight losses of specimens in
the lower portion of the hot leg are probably greater
than would have been the case if no malfunction had
occurred. (These points are not plotted in Fig. 7.27.)

Thermal-convection loop 21A is a Hastelloy N loop
which had been previously operated before the MSR
Program was terminated in early .1973. The loop has
been restarted with new specimens and fresh MSBR fuel
salt. The U(IV)/U(III) ratio in this loop has remained at
a relatively high level. After one day of salt circulation,
U(IV)/U(IID) was 1.2 X 10%, after 11 days it was 5 X
10%, and after 45 days it had only decreased to about
1.5 X 10 *, indicating that the corrosion rate was fairly

91

low. Insert specimens were examined after 2760 hr.
Four specimens in the hottest portion of the loop lost
weight, while all others gained weight. Weight change as
function of temperature and position in the loop is
shown in (Fig. 7.28).

A comparison of Figs. 7.27 and 7.28 shows that
Inconel 601 is corroding more rapidly than Hastelloy N.
More serious attack of the Inconel 601 would have
occurred if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio had been maintained
in the range of 102-° to 10%-2, as presently considered
appropriate for an MSBR.® Therefore the compatibility
of Inconel 601 with MSBR fuel salt does not appear
adequate for service at the present” design temperature.

7.7.3 Forced-Circulation Loop Results

Hastelloy N forced-circulation loop FCL-2b com-
pleted preliminary operations near the end of October
1974. During this period, the loop contained MSRE
fuel salt LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,; (68-20-11.7-0.3 mole %)
and operated isothermally for all but the last week.

- Operation was. interrupted by an oil leak and was

resumed in January 1975 (Sect. 2.4).

During the preliminary operational period, Hastelloy
N metallurgical insert specimens were removed twice,
once in early September after six beryllium additions
had been made to the fuel salt and a second time near
the end of October, after three NiF, additions had been
made. The beryllium additions made the salt less
oxidizing by lowering the U(IV)/U(III) ratio, while the
NiF, additions raised the U(IV)/U(III) ratio and made
the salt more oxidizing. Consequently, the corrosion
rate was expected to be very low during the first period
and somewhat higher during the latter period. Results
are given in Table 7.13.

During the first period, when the salt had a low
U(1V)/U(III) ratio and operation was isothermal, weight
losses and corrosion rates were low, as expected. During
the second period of preliminary operation, the
U(IV)/U(III) ratio was much higher, and, in addition,
there was al39°C (250°F) temperature gradient
imposed on the loop for part of the period. Conse-
quently, the maximum weight loss and attendant
corrosion rates were higher than during the first period.
Data obtained during the preliminary period showed
that changes in the oxidation potential of the salt could

During the next period, FCL-2b was operated under
conditions designed to gather baseline corrosion data
using. MSBR fuel salt LiF-BeF,-ThF,;-UF,
(72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %). The specimens were examined
after one month’s exposure (Table 7.13). Because this
exposure was almost entirely under the MSBR
reference-design operating conditions of 704°C
(1300°F) maximum temperature and 139°C (250°F)
temperature differential, corrosion rates were higher
than during the earlier periods of isothermal operation,
when there was no contribution from mass transfer.
However, corrosion rates remained well within accept-
able limits.

7.7.4 Coolant-Salt Technology Facility Results

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility has provisions
for exposing three metallurgical specimens to high-
velocity NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant salt. During
this reporting period, three Hastelloy N specimens were
exposed for a ten-day period. When the specimen
holder was removed from the test facility, one of the
specimens was missing, and another was damaged
during removal from the holder. Examination of the
third specimen showed that its surface had been
scratched. Salt was observed in the scratches by
microscopic examination, which indicates that the
specimen was damaged prior to exposure or, possibly,
as a result of abrasion by the missing specimen.

Both of the recovered specimens showed weight
losses, but these losses reflect other effects in addition
to corrosion of the specimens by the fluoroborate salt.
Assuming that all weight lost was material that was
removed uniformly, the material removal rate was

almost 1 mil/year. However, because some material was
lost by mechanical means, this rate overestimates the
true corrosion rate.

The next experiment to be performed in this facility
will make use of a different specimen holder designed
to prevent loss of specimens from the holder.

7.7.5 Static Pot Tests

A series of experiments is planned using thermal-
convection and forced-circulation loops to study mass
transport of tellurium in fuel salt and its effect on the
ductility of the containment material. However, a
method must be developed that will effectively simulate
the production of tellurium in fuel salt as it occurs
under reactor conditions. Several methods for adding
tellurium have been proposed, and two test vessels are
being constructed to evaluate the various methods. The
first vessel will have viewing ports, electrochemical
probes, and accesses for stirring, sampling, or making
additions. Pellets containing measured amounts of
lithium telluride will be added to the salt to simulate
production of tellurium. The second vessel will -have
electrochemical probes and accesses for stirring and
sampling and will use nickel or chromium telluride for
supplying tellurium to the salt.

7.8 CORROSION OF HASTELLOY N AND
OTHER ALLOYS IN STEAM

B. McNabb  H. E. McCoy

The corrosion of standard and modified Hastelloy N
and other iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-base alloys is being
evaluated in steam at 538°C in TVA’s Bull Run Steam
Plant. Unstressed sheet specimens 2 in. long, % in.
wide, and 0.035 in. thick have been exposed to flowing
steam (approx 1000 Ib/hr) for up to 17,000 hr. Weight
changes and observations have been reported previ-
ously® for 15,000 hr exposure, and the same trends are
continuing with increased exposure.

One material of considerable metallurgical interest
was type 201 stainless steel. This material, when 50%
cold worked, had markedly lower weight gains in the
cold-worked condition than in the annealed condition.
After 6000 hr exposure the cold-worked specimens had
average weight gains of 0.146 mg/cm?®. X-ray diffrac-
tion patterns were made from the oxides on two of

8. H. E. McCoy and B. McNabb, Corrosion of Several Iron
and Nickel-Base Alloys in Supercritical Steam at 1000°F,
ORNL-TM4552 (August 1974).
these specimens®, and the specimens were returned to
the Bull Run facility for additional exposure. Prelimi-
nary analysis indicates that the annealed specimen (No.
353) formed oxides of Fe3 04 and a-Fe, Q5 sufficiently
thick that no matrix peaks were detected. These data
and some additional information on control specimens
are given in Table 7.14. The cold-worked specimen (No.
354) had a (body centered cubic) matrix (strong
intensity) with a lattice parameter of 2.878 % 0.002 A,
which could correspond to an Fe—60% chromium
ferritic alloy. Some (face centered cubic) phase (weak
intensity) with a lattice parameter of 3.594 A was
present, indicating that the transformation of the
matrix from fcc to bce must be rather sluggish not to
have been completed in 6000 hr at 538°C. The oxide
layer consisted of MnFe, 0, (medium) and a-Fe,0,4
(weak). The matrix lines dominated the pattern, indi-
cating that the oxide was thin. This was also indicated
by interference colors still visible in the oxide layer. A
cold-worked specimen which had been oxidized 4000
hr in air (No. 422, 117 mg/cm?) also had the same
strong bcc matrix with a lattice parameter of 2.875 A
and oxides MnFe, 04 (medium), (Mn,Fe),0; (weak),
and a-Fe, Q5 (very weak), which accounted for most of
the lines in the x-ray pattern. There was slightly more
of the fcc matrix (3.591 * 0.003 A) present in this

95

specimen than in the one exposed to steam. The lower
exposure time (4000 hr vs 6000 hr) probably accounts
for this, since the transformation to bec ferrite at this
temperature (538°C) appears sluggish. Annealed and
cold-worked samples which had not been exposed to
high temperature (538°C) had fcc (austenite) matrix
with a lattice parameter of 3.598 A. The transformation
to bee from fcc under the influence of cold work and
annealing is not completely understood, but this is
being investigated.

The effect of stress on the compatibility of Hastelloy
N in steam is being evaluated by tube-burst-type
specimens using the 3500-psig steam pressure and
varying wall thickness to obtain the desired stress on
the specimens. A double-walled tube arrangement is
being used with the annulus between the tubes con-
nected by a capillary tube to the condenser. When
rupture of the inner tube occurs, steam passes through
the capillary tube and is sensed by a thermocouple
attached to the capillary tube. Thermocouples from the
ten instrumented tube-burst specimens are connected to
a multipoint recorder, and a temperature increase
indicates rupture of a specimen.

Two heats of standard Hastelloy N, N15095 .and
N25101, have been tested in argon and in steam. The
tests in argon used that gas as the pressurizing medium
and as a cover gas over the outside of the specimen. The
reduced-wall-section specimens were identical in geom-

specimens had plugs welded in each end with one plug
having a capillary tube connected to an argon supply
for pressurizing. The specimen geometry used in steam
has been detailed previously.'®

The stress-rupture properties of heat N15095 are
shown in Fig. 7.29. As discussed previously,'® flaws in
some specimens probably contributed significantly to
the scatter in the data both in argon and in steam.
There appears to be some effect of the steam only at
higher stresses and shorter times. These data were
obtained before ultrasonic inspection of the specimens
was instituted. A number of tests are still in progress as
indicated by the arrows in Fig. 7.29; the specimens in
“argon and steam environments appear to have equiva-
lent rupture times. This indicates that under these
conditions steam does not shorten the rupture life of
Hastelloy N (heat N15095).

Figure 7.30 shows the stress-rupture properties of
heat N25101. All of the annealed, highly stressed
specimens tested in steam had shorter rupture times
than those tested in argon. These test specimens were
not ultrasonically inspected, so it is not known if they
had flaws. Specimens that were inspected and tested in
steam in the “as received” condition appear to have

96

rupture times equivalent to those of specimens tested in
argon. Several are still in test, as indicated by the arrows
in Fig. 7.30. Annealed specimens that have been
ultrasonically inspected will be tested to determine if
there is an effect of cold work or pretest annealing on
the rupture life of stressed specimens. There appears to
be no effect of cold work on weight gains of unstressed
specimens of Hastelloy N.

At 538°C the fracture mode of Hastelloy N can be
shifted very easily from intergranular to transgranular.
Thus it is not too surprising that the fracture appear-
ances are tather randomly distributed between inter-
granular and transgranular modes regardless of rupture
time and test environment. Figure 7.31 shows photo-
micrographs of the fractures of Hastelloy N heat
N15095 tube-burst specimens tested at 538°C in steam
in the as-received or as-machined condition. Specimen 4
was stressed at 66,000 psi; it ruptured at 4.0 hr with a
ductile fracture. Specimen b was stressed at 49,400 psi;
it ruptured at 2088.8 hr (approximately half the normal
rupture life} with a brittle fracture. Specimen ¢ was
stressed at 53,200 psi; it ruptured between 5000 and
6000 hr with a ductile fracture. The cracks in the
outside surface of the tube and deformation at the
outside edge of the fracture were caused by the impact
of the stressed tube at rupture with the outside tube of
the double-walled specimen. The 3500-psig steam pres-
sure was on the inside of the stressed tube.

Figure 7.32 shows photomicrographs of the fractures
of Hastelloy N heat NI15095 tube-burst specimens
tested in the annealed condition (1 hr at 1177°C) in
steam at 538°C. Specimen a was stressed at 64,000 psi;
it ruptured in 28.8 hr with a ductile fracture. Specimen
b was stressed at 59,500 psi; it ruptured in 75.3 hr with
a ductile fracture. Specimen ¢ was stressed at 55,500
psi; it ruptured in 1443 hr with a ductile fracture. These
specimens had considerable deformation at the outside
of the fracture caused by impacting the outside tube at
rupture. This ability to deform indicates that the

material was not embrittled by the exposure to steam.

Figure 7.33 shows photomicrographs of Hastelloy N
heat N25101 tube-burst specimens tested in the as-
received condition at 538°C in steam. Specimen a,
stressed at 71,300 psi, ruptured in 5.1 hr; specimen b,
stressed at 70,000 psi, ruptured in 174.3 hr; and
specimen ¢, stressed at 56,000 psi, ruptured in 5000 to
6000 hr. Specimen ¢, which was not an instrumented
specimen, had not failed when inspected at 5000 hr,
but had failed when inspected at 6000 hr. The cracks
on the outside surface of each tube were caused by the
impact of the stressed inner tube with the outer tube of
the double tube specimen. All three of these specimens
tested in steam appear to have ductile fractures and to
have rupture times equivalent to or greater than those
of specimens tested in argon. In fact, specimen ¢ had a
longer rupture time than a similar test in argon which
was stressed at 55,000 psi and ruptured in 1525.8 hr.

Figure 7.34 shows the fractures of Hastelloy N heat
N25101 tube-burst specimens tested in the annealed

condition (1 hr at 1177°C) in steam at 538°C.
Specimen a was stressed at 70,000 psi; it ruptured in
1.3 hr with a ductile-type fracture and considerable
deformation of the outside of the fracture on impact
with the outside wall. Photomicrographs b and ¢ were
made of a specimen stressed at 56,500 psi that ruptured
in 19.5 hr with a brittle fracture. An area away from
the primary fracture is shown in c. The reason for these
variable test results is not presently known.

As reported previously,'® some specimens tested in
argon ruptured prematurely and exhibited some crack-
ing on both the inside and the outside of the specimen
wall. All of the specimens tested in steam in the
annealed condition (1 hr at 1177°C) ruptured at shorter
times than similar stressed specimens tested in argon.
The annealed series of specimens had not been ultra-
sonically inspected before testing, so they could possi-
bly have contained some flaws. However, it is unlikely
that all of them would have contained flaws. The very
similar heat N15095 in the annealed condition had
ductile failures (Fig. 7.32). In both heats the specimens
were machined, annealed 1 hr at 1177°C, then welded
into the double-walled specimen geometry before test-
ing. As far as is known, the same cleaning procedures
were used before welding (thorough degreasing in
acetone), but different welding facilities were used in
the fabrication of the specimens. The annealed speci-
mens (N25101) were fabricated by outside vendors; the
others were fabricated by ORNL personnel. Other
specimens will be prepared with close control over these
variables to resolve the differences.

7.9 DEVELOPMENT OF A
TELLURIUM-DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR
A REPRESENTATIVE TELLURIUM-CORROSION
SCREENING TEST METHOD

J. Brynestad

Several factors are important to the development of a
good tellurium-corrosion screening test system for
study of tellurium-induced intergranular cracking. The
test system must expose the test specimens to a
tellurium level that exceeds that encountered at any
vulnerable place in the MSBR, and in such a way that
the test results can be used to predict the materials’
behavior under MSBR conditions. On the other hand,
the exposure level should not be unreasonably high.

At this stage, the tellurium exposure level in an MSBR
is not defined. Although it is possible to estimate the
total amount of tellurium produced during the life-span
of an MSBR, the activity of the tellurium is not
defined. However, one must assume that a considerable
part of the tellurium that contacts the alloy will be in a
highly activated state, whereas the remainder will react
with the melt and assume the redox state imposed by
the melt. The kinetics of all these reactions are
unknown.

The test system must be reproducible; that is, it must
expose all specimens in the same way. The duration of
the test must be relatively short as compared with the
lifetime of an MSBR without violating the first require-
ment. The system ought to be reliable and relatively
simple to operate. :

Among these requirements, the tellurium exposure
level is the most nebulous one. At present, it is not
known what tellurides, if any, were formed with
Hastelloy N in the MSRE. However, it is known that
tellurium can cause intergranular embrittlement of
nickel at low chemical activities.

To obtain more information about tellurium-induced
intergranular attack of Hastelloy at different tellurium
activities, three different nickel-tellurium equilibrium
systems were prepared with different, but time-
constant, tellurium activities:

1.
2.

Ni; Te, (82)(s) + Ni(s) (low tellurium activity),
Ni3zTes 4, (82 )(s) + NiTeq 776 (71 )(s) (medium tellu-
rium activity), and

. NiTeg gs5(v1)(s) + NiTe; 45(8)(s) (high tellurium
activity).

The designatiohs of the nickel-tellurium phases are the
same as used by Klepp and Komarek.!! Of these
systems, system 1 should be unable to form any nickel

102

telluride on Hastelloy N by isothermal interaction, since
the activity of nickel in this system equals 1, whereas
the activity of nickel in Hastelloy N is less than 1. Three
different compositions of Hastelloy N tensile specimens
were embedded in each of these granulated mixtures in
evacuated and sealed silica capsules and were treated for
200 hr at 700°C. ‘

The high-tellurium-activity system did in fact have
too high tellurium activity, since it almost completely
destroyed the samples. The low-tellurium-activity
system had little effect on the specimens; indicating
that the activity indeed is too low, or that the exposure
time was too short. The medium-tellurium-activity
system showed considerable attack on the specimens,
more than desired for a screening test. '

To test further, systems 1 and 2 were retested using
system. 1 at 700°C for 1000 hr and system 2 at 650°C
for 250 hr. Again, the medium tellurium activity was
quite active, whereas the low tellurium activity was
substantially less.

It appears that a tellurium activity somewhere
between those of systems 1 and 2 may prove to be most
like that actually in an MSBR. The system Cr,Te;-
Cr;Tes is such a system, and experiments are in
progress to obtain more information.

7.10 REACTIONS OF TELLURIUM WITH NICKEL
AT LOW TELLURIUM ACTIVITIES

J. Brynestad  R. E. Clausing

It is important to obtain meaningful, basic informa-
tion concerning the nature of the grain-boundary
products or “surface compounds”!? which give rise to
intergranular embrittlement. Necessary steps toward
this goal are information about the equilibrium distribu-
tion of tellurium between the bulk phase of the metal
and the grain boundaries, about the relative stabilities
of the *surface compounds” vs the regular (bulk)
tellurides, and about the tellurium activity levels at

934-46 (1972). _ .

12, The term ‘*‘surface compounds™ is introduced to apply
specifically to surface (grain boundary or free surface) products
which are formed when tellurium and metals are reacted.
Although compounds or phases commonly refer to bulk phases,
this concept has developed simply because of our inabitity to
detect compound formation on a smaller scale. Grain bound-
aries have properties different from those of the bulk material
and would be expected to react differently chemically. The
development of analytical tools such as Auger spectroscopy
gives the capability to characterize the reaction products
contained within the grain boundary.
which the surface compounds are formed. The nickel-
tellurium system was chosen for preliminary study.

In the experiment a 1.5-mil-thick nickel foil about 1
cm wide and 4 cm long was exposed for 2500 hr to
tellurium vapor at 990°C (lower end) to 1005°C (upper
end). The tellurium vapor was delivered from the
equilibrium system Ni(s) + 8, -Ni telluride(s) (37 at. %
Te), which was kept at ~980°C, which is a lower
temperature than that of any point on the foil. The
whole system was contained in an evacuated, sealed
silica capsule. Since §,-Ni telluride is the most nickel-
rich telluride in the nickel-tellurium system at these
temperatures, this setup ensured that the nickel foil
could not react as to form any bulk nickel telluride, but
could only form solid solutions of tellurium in nickel
and surface compounds. After equilibration for 2500
hr, the system was removed from the furnace and
air-cooled. '

The foil was visibly deformed and quite brittle. A
piece of the foil was investigated by x-ray analysis. No
bulk nickel tellurides were detectable. The lattice
parameter of the nickel was found to be 3.5272 #
0.0002 A (20°C), as compared with Jette and
Foote’s'? value of 3.52394 A (25°C), indicating a
slight lattice expansion. (A control thermal test of
unexposed nickel foil is being done.)

Chemical analysis of a piece of the toil gave aun over-
all content of 0.25 at. % of tellurium. A piece of the
sample was investigated by Auger spectroscopy using a
newly acquired high-resolution, small-area Auger spec-
trometer with a beam size of <5 u. Both surface and
grain-boundary areas were examined, and both showed
tellurium concentrations of about 10 at. % (when
normalized to % Ni + % Te = 100%). No corrections
have yet been made for chemical effects on the nickel
spectra or the inhomogeneous distribution of tellurium
with depth. Neither of these corrections can be made
satisfactorily until special standardization techniques
have been established. Probably, both corrections will
increase the measured tellurium concentration, with the
combined effect that the tellurium concentrations may
be double the reported values. Sputtering the surfacg
and grain-boundary regions to a depth of about 10 A
reduced the tellurium concentration by about 75% angl
85%, respectively, and sputtering to about 100 A
reduced the tellurium concentration to about 1 at. % on
the surface and to $0.2 at. % in the grain-boundary
region.

103

Strong chemical effects were seen in the nickel Auger
spectra. These complicate the present analysis but offer
a potential method for identifying compounds by the
nature of the chemical bond formed.

These results indicate that tellurium has a strong
tendency for surface-compound formation on grain
boundaries in nickel, with a distribution ratio < 100 for
the distribution of tellurium between the grain-
boundary phase and the bulk phase. This indicates, in
the case of nickel, that tellurium vapor can embrittle
nickel by intergranular surface-compound formation at
pressures that are much lower than those required for
the formation of bulk nickel tellurides. The question
remains as to what extent this also holds true in the
case of Hastelloy N. Most probably, the distribution
ratios of the alloying constituents in Hastelloy N
between bulk and grain boundaries are not unity.
Therefore, depending upon this distribution and upon
the properties of the various surface-compound tellu-
rides, a given alloy composition may be embrittled by
tellurium more or less than pure nickel. The tellurides
of chromium and titanium are thermodynamically more
stable than the nickel tellurides, as are also some
ternary compounds (nickel-titanium tellurides), and it
might seem plausible to assume that the same would
apply to surface-compound tellurides, so that surface-
compound tellurides in Hastelloy N would be expected
to be more stable than those in pure nickel. However,
the stability of an intergranular surface compound must
be measured relative to the stabilities of the possible
bulk metal tellurides and to solid-solution-type struc-
tural units. If an alloying constituent causes a shift in
the relative stabilities of surface-compound telluride
formation vs regular bulk telluride formation, the
constituent could prevent intergranular embrittlement,
although at the expense of increased corrosion by bulk
telluride formation. However, this would represent an
advantage in an MSBR, where the total amount of
tellurium produced is very small.

A serious obstacle in this work is the fact that our
understanding of intergranular surface compounds in
general is still very limited. Largely unknown are the
nature and strength of bonding, thickness, and struc-
tures as a function of the nature of the grain boundaries
(low angle, high angle). Also, only limited analytical
tools and methods are as yet available for attacking
these problems. However, a coordinated study involving
Auger spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction,
electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, electron
microscopy, x-ray analysis, and thermodynamic and
chemical methods certainly bear the promise of signifi-
cant gains in this area. '

7.11 SURFACE AND GRAIN-BOUNDARY
STUDIES RELATED TO HASTELLOY N
GRAIN-BOUNDARY EMBRITTLEMENT

R. E. Clausing L. Heatherly

Auger electron spectroscopy and other new surface-
sensitive techniques are being applied to study the
grain-boundary embrittlement of Hastelloy N which
was observed in some specimens removed from the

MSRE. This effort is intended to (1) confirm that’

tellurium was indeed present in the grain boundaries of
samples removed from the MSRE in amounts sufficient
to cause the observed embrittlement, (2) examine
samples prepared in various screening tests to determine
the nature and extent of grain-boundary and surface
reactions of various alloys with tellurium, (3) study in
detail specially prepared materials designed to help

understand the mechanisms, chemistry, and metallurgy

of this form of grain-boundary embrittlement, (4)
determine the equilibrium partition of tellurium
between bulk, surface, and grain boundaries in nickel,
Hastelloy N, and modified Hastelloy N, and (5) explore
the use of high-temperature in situ Auger electron
spectroscopy for rapid and direct screening of alloys for
resistance to tellurium attack. Items 1, 2, and 3 depend
heavily on the availability of ‘the high-performance
Auger spectrometer described below. Accordingly, most
emphasis is on this effort. The spectrometer is now in
operation, and data are being obtained on a regular
basis. The continuing development of supporting equip-
ment (especially for data acquisition and handling) will
increase the usefulness of the spectrometer.

The equipment is being continually improved for in
situ  high-temperature studies; some data recently
obtained using this technique are reported in Sect.
7.11.2. Presently under study is the diffusion of
tellurium, sulfur, and carbon to the surface of several
samples prepared from the shoulders of tensile samples
made from alloys containing tellurium. Data obtained
in a few hours with this technique can provide
information on the partition of tellurium between the
bulk and surface of a sample and on the rate of
diffusion of tellurium to the surface. A tellurium
evaporator has been designed for use with the high-
temperature equipment so that the inward diffusion of
tellurium from the surface of an alloy may be studied in
an experiment which is more or less the inverse of the
above experiment. This new experiment will provide
information on the penetration of tellurium into grain
boundaries and bulk material from the surface as a
function of time, temperature, and alloy content.

Construction and use of this equipment are not
presently proceeding because of budget limitations.

7.11.1 Development of Improved Techniques

An apparatus developed to provide Auger electron
spectroscopic analysis of areas as small as 5 u in
diameter is operating satisfactorily. This provides the
ability to analyze surfaces and grain-boundary fracture
surfaces in great detail. The small-diameter electron
beam used for analysis is rastered to produce a scanning
electron microscope type of display (using absorbed
sample current) at a magnification of several hundred
times the actual size, and can position the beam on
selected spots for complete elemental analysis. The
analysis is nondestructive, and as many points as desired
may be analyzed for all elements except hydrogen and
helium. Auger signals are obtained only from the first
few atom layers of the exposed surface. These surface
layers can be removed by sputtering to €xpose suc-
cessive depths for analysis, so that we may determine
composition as a function of distance below the original
surface and therefore the distribution of elements in
and near the embrittled grain boundaries.

The analysis of a thin nickel foil embrittled with
tellurium and fractured to expose the grain boundaries
(Sect. 7.10) illustrates an application of the new
equipment in a situation where the older apparatus
would not have provided satisfactory results.

7.11.2 High Temperature Studies of the
Behavior of Tellurium in and on Experimental Alloys

This work has been given less priority than the work
with the small-diameter beam; nevertheless, several
recent runs have been made with tellurium-doped
Hastelloy N heats 359 (7% Cr) and 361 (<1% Cr). The
compositions of these alloys are given in Table 7.15.

The most significant results thus far are that these
alloys both appear to have about 2.5 at. % tellurium
and 10 to 15 at. % sulfur on their surfaces in vacuum at

700°C. This represents a surface enrichment over the
bulk of about 4000 for sulfur and about 100 for
tellurium. The tellurium surface-enrichment factor in
these alloys is similar to that reported in the previous
section for tellurium in nickel at 1000°C. Because of
the differences in temperature, alloy content, sulfur
levels, and exposure conditions, this result is interesting
and worthy of further investigation but does not allow
a direct comparison. Additionial nickel samples prepared
at lower temperatures will be examined, and additional
experiments with tellurium-doped alloys are planned.

7.12 IDENTIFICATION OF REACTION LAYERS
ON HASTELLOY N
EXPOSED TO NICKEL TELLURIDES

D. N.Braski O.B.Cavin R.S. Crouse

This study was to identify the reaction layers formed
on Hastelloy N alloys after 250 hr exposure to 8, and
v, nickel tellurides at 700°C. The three alloys included
in the study were 5065, 583 (shortened from471-583),
and 114 (shortened from 471-114), whose composi-
tions are listed in Table 7.7. These experiments were
part of a series to determine an alloy’s susceptibility to
intergranular cracking due to tellurium. The conditions
of the screening tests were probably orders of magni-
tude more severe than would be found in an actual
molten-salt breeder reactor. Nevertheless, rapid screen-
ing of candidate structural alloys with regard to
tellurium attack is useful in alloy development. Such
tests may also help characterize the corrosion process
and provide clues toward understanding the mechanism.
The following paragraphs describe the results of metal-
lographic, electron microprobe, and x-ray diffraction
analyses of reaction products on the three alloys.

7.12.1 Metallographic Examination

Sections of tested tensile samples of 5065, 583, and
114 alloys  were mounted in epoxy and polished for

metallographic examination. All three materials were
coated with reaction products caused by exposure to
tellurium at 700°C. The nominal thicknesses of these
layers are listed in Table 7.16. The titanium-modified
alloys, 583 and 114, exhibited considerably thicker
reaction layers than the standard Hastelloy N (5065).
The number and average depth of intergranular cracks
that were opened up along the length of the tensile
samples after tensile testing at 25°C are also given in
Table 7.16. Fewer cracks were observed in alloy 114
(1.75% Ti) than in either alloy 5065 or 583 (1.44% Ti).
The average depth of cracks in both titanium-modified
alloys was less than one-third of that found with alloy
5065. However, since crack depth was measured from
the metal—reaction-layer interface, the reaction-layer
thickness must also be considered in comparing the
different alloys. The titanium-modified alloys had
shallow cracks but were subject to moderate general
corrosion, while alloy 5065 showed deep cracks but no
corrosion. These results are difficult to interpret for
screening purposes. Therefore, it would probably be
better to reduce the severity of the tellurium attack so
that only intergranular cracking resulted. A 1000-hr test
using a lower activity of tellurium is currently being
evaluated.

7.12.2 Electron Microprobe Analysis

Electron microprobe scans of tellurium-reaction
layers on 5065, 583, and 114 alloys are given in Figs.
7.35, 7.36, and 7.37 respectively. The backscattered-
electron scan for 5065 (Fig. 7.35) shows a relatively
thin reaction zone with a very uneven interface between
it and the base metal. The reaction layers contain Ni,
Cr, Mo, and Te. The amount of nickel was slightly less
than was present in the base alloy and was distributed
evenly'th-rougho'ut the layer. Chromium was present in
approximately the same concentration as in.the base
alloy (7%), but was confined to a layer close to the
reaction-layer—base-metal interface. The molybdenum
concentration in the reaction layer appeared to be

slightly higher than in the base metal. The tellurium was
detected throughout the reaction layer and appeared to
concentrate in areas that were low in molybdenum.
Atomic-absorption analysis showed the concentration
of tellurium in the reaction layers to be 33.6 wt %.

The scans for 583 alloy, containing 1.79% Ti, are
given in Fig. 7.36. A thicker reaction layer (actually
two layers together) was observed for this alloy (note
the magnification of only 200 times). The interface
between the metal and reaction layers was nearly a
straight line. Nickel was observed in high concentration
in the layer nearest the base metal, but only small
amounts were found in the thinner outer layer. The
reverse situation was detected for chromium. Again,
molybdenum appeared slightly concentrated in the first
layer. However, no molybdenum was present in the
outer layer. Titanium was distributed uniformly
throughout both layers. The tellurium was found in
both layers but appeared to be concentrated in the
outer layer. The average tellurium content for the
combined layers was 39.9%. In other areas of the same
sample, chromium was not always detected in the outer
layer. The explanation for this is unclear at this time.

The results for the 2% Ti modified alloy 114 are
shown in Fig. 7.37. As in the case for 583, a relatively
thick reaction layer had a uniform interface. However, a
distinct outer layer was not present. Nickel appeared to
be present in the reaction layer in moderate quantity,
and the amount of chromium was less than 5%. Again,
the reaction layer appeared to be slightly enriched in
molybdenum. Titanium was observed in about the same
concentration as in the base metal. Tellurium was
detected throughout the reaction layer but was slightly
depleted in a layer near the interface. The tellurium
content of the reaction layer was 37.5 wt % as
determined by atomic absorption.

The results above differ somewhat from earlier
investigations by Gehlbach and Henson where Hastelloy
N foils were exposed to tellurium vapor at different
temperatures.!* We did not find any striated nickel-
chromium tellurides of the type that were observed in
their Knudsen cell exposures at 750°C. However, both
their earlier work and ours found material near the
outer surface that was enriched in molybdenum. Addi-
tional quantitative analyses of reaction products are in
progress to broaden our understanding of tellurium
attack. The results should be useful in characterizing
the Hastelloy N—tellurium reactions in ways that will
be helpful in interpreting the alloy screening tests.

7.12.3 X-Ray Diffraction Analysis

X-ray diffraction has been used to analyze the

- reaction products scraped off 5065 and 114 specimens.

"H.E. McCoy J. Brynestad D. Kelmers

In both cases, Ni; Te, appeared to be the main reaction
product. This result is similar to that reported by
Gehlbach and Henson.!? NiTe, ¢o may also have been
produced, but differentiation between the two com-
pounds is difficult since the interplanar spacings of both
are nearly identical. Other extra lines can be indexed to
several lines for molybdenum tellurides (MoTe,,
Mo;Te,s) and/or chromium tellurides (Cr,Te;, CrTe),
but the identification of these lines must be considered
tentative. The extra lines may actually be due to the
formation of ternary compounds such as Ni-Cr-Te.
Positive identification of such compounds is difficult
because their interplanar spacings have not yet been
indexed and do not appear in the ASTM file system.

7.12.4 Conclusions

1. Hastelloy N alloys were severely corroded by direct
contact to B, and 7; nickel tellurides at 700°C for 250
hr.

2. The titanium-modified alloys, 583 and 114, exhib-
ited only shallow intergranular cracks after tensile
testing but were subject to moderate general tellurium
corrosion. The reverse situation was observed for
standard Hastelloy N (5065).

3. Electron microprobe scans showed the presence of
Ni, Cr, Mo, and Te in the reaction layers. Titanium was
also present in the corrosion products on 583 and 114.

4. The concentrations (by weight) of tellurium in the
reaction layers, as determined by atomic absorption,
were 33.6, 39.9, and 37.5% for 5065, 583, and 114
alloys respectively.

5. The main reaction product appeared to be Ni; Te,
or NiTey g9 as shown by x-ray diffraction analysis.
Numerous other x-ray lines were not positively indexed
and may be associated with other binary and/or ternary
tellurides.

ing tensile specimens to tellurium are being considered.
In an MSBR the flux of tellurium will be about 10'®
atoms cm 2 sec”!, so the screening tests need to
involve fluxes of similar magnitudes. The methods
investigated thus far use the dissociation pressure of
nickel tellurides or the vapor pressure of tellurium
metal as sources of tellurium. Tensile specimens were
exposed, and these were subsequently deformed to
failure. The fractured samples were examined metallo-
graphically to determine the extent of intergranular
cracking. The results of the tests done to date are
summarized in Table 7.17.

Samples of four heats were exposed to telluride
mixture B (Table 7.17) for 250 hr at 650°C. The
samples were embedded in small particles of the
mixture in a quartz tube, evacuated, and sealed. The
photomicrographs shown in Fig. 7.38 show that the
specimens formed thick reaction layers and shallow
intergranular cracks to a depth of 1 to 1.5 mils. The
samples lost weight during the exposure because of
spalling of the reaction product. The losses in cross-
sectional area are likely responsible for the decreases in
the yield and tensile stresses.

Samples were exposed to nickel telluride mixture A,
which had a lower dissociation pressure of tellurium
than mixtures B and C. The first group was exposed for
250 hr at 700°C, and the weight gains were about 2 mg,
which corresponds to a flux of about 2 X 10! atoms
cm™? sec”™!. No reaction layers formed, and only
shallow cracks <0.3 mil formed in the two titanium-
modified alloys (Fig. 7.39). The samples exposed for
1000 hr gained about 20 mg, with an effective tellurium
flux of about 5 X 10'! atoms cm™ sec . However,
these specimens did have isolated regions where surface
reactions occurred. Thus, the weight gain includes
particles which effectively sintered to the specimens,
and the flux of reactive tellurium is lower than the
above value. These specimens had a few shallow cracks
(Fig. 7.40). Some small changes occurred in the
mechanical properties, but these likely resulted from
carbide precipitation during the 250- and 1000-hr
anneals at 700°C.

Samples exposed to mixture B for 250 hr at 700°C
underwent extensive chemical reaction. A detailed
post-test examination of these specimens was made by
Braski.'® Thick reaction films were produced, and large
weight losses occurred due to their spalling. An interest-
ing difference was that the titanium-modified alloys had
thicker reaction layers, but the cracks formed during
tensile testing were shallower (Fig. 7.41). The reduc-

tions in yield and tensile stresses were likely due to
reduction in the cross-sectional area by the extensive
reaction layers.

The samples exposed to mixture C underwent even
further chemical reaction. There was very little ten-
dency for intergranular crack formation (Fig. 7.42).
The reductions in the strength parameters were likely
due to reductions in the cross sections by chemical
reaction. However, the total elongation and reduction
in area were not reduced more than could be accounted
for by carpide precipitation.

One set of samples was exposed in a quartz capsule at
700°C with tellurium at 300°C. The partial pressure of
tellurium under these conditions is about 1 X 107*
torr. The three samples were in the same capsule, and
the weight gains shown in Table 7.17 are indicative of
the extent of the bulk chemical reaction. The standard
Hastelloy N specimen gained only about 0.1 mg,
whereas the titanium-modified alloys gained about 1 mg
each. The standard specimen did not have a visible
reaction layer, but the two modified specimens did have
reaction layers. The average tellurium flux reacting with
the standard specimen was about 10'° atoms cm ™2
sec”!, whereas that reacting with the titanium-modified
alloys was 10'! atoms cm™ sec™!. The extent of
cracking in all three specimens was about equivalent,
and the maximum crack depth was about 5 mils (Fig.
7.43). The changes in mechanical properties were quite
small and can be accounted for by changes due to
carbide precipitation.

The last two specimens (Table 7.17) were exposed to
telluriumn vapor in an experiment designed to limit the
rate of transport to the specimens; examination after
the first 100 hr showed that the reaction proceeded
more rapidly at the end of the specimen closest to the
tellurium. The samples were turned twice and exposed
at 700°C for a total of 400 hr. The weight changes were
negative, and nickel tellurides were formed elsewhere in
the system. No reaction layer was metallographically
visible on the specimen, but the deformed sample
formed cracks to a depth of about 3 mils (Fig. 7.44).

The tests described in this section represent a variety
of test conditions and specimen compositions. They are
not adequate for firm conclusions, but they indicate
some important trends:

1. The ‘tests reaffirmed the extreme sensitivity of
standard Hastelloy N to intergranular embrittlement
when exposed to tellurium fluxes of only about
10'° atoms cm™2 sec™!. However, the unknown
partial pressure of tellurium in equilibrium with
telluride mixture A was not sufficient to cause
significant cracking.

7.14 OPERATION AND ANALYSIS OF TeGen-1
C. R. Hyman

TeGen-1 was the first in a series of ORR poolside
irradiation experiments designed to irradiate prospec-
tive MSBR vessel materials under conditions expected
in a molten-salt breeder reactor. The experiment was
designed to produce a fission product inventory similar
to that found in the MSRE when intergranular cracking
was first observed. Probably the fission product tellu-

119

rium is the chief cause of this cracking. Therefore, this

experiment was designed specifically to produce a

tellurium inventory of at least 5 X 10!¢ Te atoms/cm?

at the metal-to-salt interface together with a representa-
tive mix of other fission products.

The test device was an irradiation capsule containing
three ' % -in.-OD, 0.035-in.-wall, 4-in.-long tubular fuel
pins, partially filled with fuel salt. The three fuel pins
were type 304 stainless steel, standard Hastelloy N, and
Inconel 601. The fuel pins were filled with 7.1 cm? of
fuel-salt, leaving a Y%-in. void at the top of the pin,
which was filled with helium. The fuel salt was a
mixture of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-*33UF,-?238UF,
(63.5-29-5-1.0-1.5 mole %).

The fuel pins were arranged vertically inside a
double-walled type 304 stainless steel vessel. The void
between the fuel pins and the inner wall of the vessel
was filled with NaK for improving heat transfer. A
schematic drawing of TeGen-1 is shown in Fig. 7.45.
The capsule was instrumented with four Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples per fuel pin. One electrical
resistance heater was wrapped around each fuel pin, and
these heaters were positioned to minimize axial temper-
ature gradients while the experiment was operating. The
heaters also kept the fuel pins about 150°C during
periods when the reactor was down and while the
capsule was removed from the reactor after completion
of the irradiation but prior to hot cell disassembly.
Fission product decay radiation in cold (<150°C)
irradiated fuel causes dissociation of the fuel salt
components and consequently leads to the release of
fluorine. Calculations indicate that fluorine pressures as
high as 440 psia could be generated inside the fuel pins
if they were allowed to remain for long periods at
ambient temperature.

The design operating temperature for the specimens
was 700°C at the salt-to-metal interface and was
maintained as uniform as possible over the length of the
specimens throughout the duration of the irradiation.
Bulk temperature control was maintained by adjusting
“the experiment position with respect to the reactor by

means of the movable track on which the experiment
was placed in the ORR poolside facility. This move-
ment changes the neutron flux at the experiment and
thus varies the fission heat produced. Fine temperature
adjustment and uniform axial temperatures were
attained by heater power manipulation. A more com-
plete description of the experiment may be found in an
earlier report.!”

7.14.1 Operating History of TeGen-1

TeGen-1 was inserted into the ORR poolside irradia-

tion facility position P4A on September 19, 1974. It
was irradiated for 145.8 hr during ORR fuel cycles 121
and 122 with the reactor at the full 30-MW(t) operating
power. The irradiation was terminated on November
25,:1974, at which time the capsule was retracted to 13
in. away from the reactor face. On December 3, 1974,
the capsule was removed from the poolside facility and
hung on the south side of the ORR pool with all the
instrumentation left intact. During this time, the
specimen temperatures were maintained at an average
of 200°C.
- The only occurrence not expected during the irradia-
tion was the change in flux that occurred upon the
removal of a large experiment in the P-5 position
adjacent to the P4-A position. Before removal of this
adjacent experiment, the TeGen-1 experiment was
operating at 700°C. After removal of this other
experiment, the TeGen-1 capsule had to be inserted 2.3
in. further toward the reactor to compensate for the
decrease in the local thermal-neutron flux.

On February 10, 1975, the capsule was transferred to
the ORR hot cell, at which time it was disassembled.
Personnel from the Metals and Ceramics Division then
took charge of performing the chemical and metal-
lurgical evaluation. '

7.14.2 Data Analysis for TeGen-1

Table 7.18 gives typical operating data. The average
thermocouple reading over the length of the experiment
was 703°C. This corresponds to a calculated average
temperature at the fuel-salt-to-fuel-pin interface of
about 710°C. The maximum temperature variation
occurred in the bottom fuel pin. This temperature
difference of 103°C can be explained by convection
currents existing in the NaK at the bottom of the

locations of the thermocouples both vertically and
circumferentially as well as their orientation relative to
the face of the reactor.

Several sets of temperature data are plotted in Fig.
7.47. The top set of curves represents normal operating
conditions with the heater power as noted (Table 7.18).
The middle set of curves denotes temperatures at the
same capsule position but without heater power. The
bottom set of curves denotes the retracted position
with heater power the same as noted (Table 7.18). This
latter condition represents negligible gamma and fission
heat.

Neutronics data gave the fission reaction rates existing
in each of the fuel pins. These reaction rates were 2.93

X 107%, 3.23 X 107%, and 2.90 X 10~° fission per
second per 233y atom for the top, middle, and bottom
fuel pins respectively. The reaction rates were obtained
for an average operating distance of 5.6 in. away from
the face of the reactor. Each pin had 0.88 g, or 2.88 X
102! atoms, of 233U. The above reaction rates were
assumed to be constant throughout the irradiation; also
assumed was an effective absorbed energy in the pin per
fission of 180 MeV. The average linear fission heat
generation rate was 0.509 kW/ft. For an irradiation
time of 1145.8 hr, an inventory of 3.82 X 10!'® Te
atoms should have been produced, assuming known
fission yields of tellurium from 233 U. This would give
1.23 X 10'%,1.36 X 10'%, and 1.23 X 10'® atoms of
tellurium in the top, middle, and bottom fuel pins

respectively. If all the tellurium were deposited on the
specimen metal surface, the specific inventory of
tellurium would be 4.7 X 10"°%, 5.2 X 10'®,and 4.7 X
10% ¢ Te atoms per square centimeter of metal area for
the top, middle, and bottom fuel pins respectively.
These calculations assume that all the tellurium was
deposited below the salt level. These specific inventories
are acceptably close to the 5 X 10'® Te atoms/cm?
required by design criteria.

Figure 7.48 presents the design temperature profile as
a function of radial distance from the center of the fuel
pin. This profile was based on a one-dimensional
analysis using GENGTC.!® This analysis did not take
into account the end heat losses, nor did it account for
the convection currents that may occur in the hot fuel
salt. Also, the input data to this program assumed that
the fission and heater heat were averaged over an
effective length of 14 in. Figure 7.49 gives the relative
radial temperature-profile estimates for the top, middle,
and bottom fuel pins respectively. Although exact
temperature distributions are not known, the differ-
ences in the respective fission reaction rates in the fuel
pins cause the centerline temperatures of the middle

and bottom fuel pins to be higher than for the top fuel -

pin. As a result, the temperature gradients in the fuel

pins differ substantially, radially as well as axially, and
therefore may effect the corresponding fission product
deposition rates on the surfaces of the fuel specimens.
This occurs in spite of having the same temperature
along the outside of the fuel pins. Note that the
temperatures at the surfaces of the fuel pins are the
respective averages of the lower three thermocouple
readings on each fuel pin in Table 7.18. These thermo-
couple readings represent actual fuel region tempera-
tures and not those of the void region above the salt.
Also note that the heater powers (Table 7.18) provide
heat to the ends of the fuel pins where little or no
fission heat is produced. This has the effect of leveling
out the temperatures over the length of the experiment
(Table 7.18). ‘

During the data analysis, a comparison was made of
the fission heats produced as calculated from neutronics
support and those indicated by a thermal heat balance.
The thermal heat balance technique required certain
assumptions. First was the assumption that absolute
heater power inputs were known. However, the original
design did not specify precise measurement of heater
power, and, as a result, the instrumentation was not
calibrated to provide high precision. Second, gamma
heating rates were assumed to be the same as when the
experiment was first designed. This was not precisely
correct, because the reactor core configuration has been
changed since that time, thus changing the gamma flux.
Since the gamma heating rates as well as the electrical

heating rates were a large fraction of the total heating
rate, any calculation of the fission heat by heat balance
would be subject to inherent errors. Finally, the
thermal model used in the heat balance did not take
into account the heat losses that occur in the ends of
the fuel pins.

As a result of the above uncertainties and the
uncertainties involved with neutronics methods, the
disagreement of the two calculations amounted to a
maximum of 20% in the fission heat production rates.
Additional information on fission product production
will be obtained when complete chemical and metal-
lurgical analyses are performed.

7.14.3 Future Irradiations

Future TeGen capsules will be basically the same as
TeGen-1, but with different fuel pin materials. In
addition, eight 5 X 3% X 0.005 in. foils will be
suspended inside each fuel pin. Four will be placed in
the space above the fuel salt, while four foils will be
suspended in the fuel salt at the bottom of each fuel
pin. These foils will be made of the same material as the
respective fuel pins.

In addition the heater coils will be distributed to give
a more uniform axial temperature profile, and heater
power instrumentation will be improved by installing

calibrated meters on line so that accurate electrical
power measurements can be made. Accurate gamma
heating measurements as well as improved flux map-
pings of the poolside facility are planned, also. With
these improvements, a more precise thermal calculation
should be possible.

7.15 EXAMINATION OF TeGen-1

B.McNabb  H. E. McCoy

TeGen-1 was designed to study the effect of tellurium
and other fission products on containment materials of
interest to the MSR Program.!? (TeGen is an acronym
for tellurium generator.) The experiment was operated
in the ORR poolside facility P4A for 1145 hr at 700°C
with the ORR operating at 30 MW(t) during fuel cycles
121 and 122.

Three fuel pins (length, 4 in.; diameter, % in.; wall
thickness, 0.035 in.) were each filled with 7.14 cm? (3
in. depth) of MSR fuel salt containing 0.78 g 233U. A
total of approximately 3400 Ci of mixed fission
product activity was estimated to be generated in each

be about 5 X 10'® Te atoms per square centimeter of
contact area. The operating conditions and design
characteristics were reported previously:'” The fuel
pins were made of (1) type 304 stainless steel, (2)
standard Hastelloy N, and (3) Inconel 601 and were
doubly contained in a type 304 stainless steel sheath.
The fuel pins were in contact with NaK on the outside
~ surface and with fuel salt on the inside. There was a
~ %-in.-high helium-filled gas plenum above the fuel salt.

TeGen-1 was removed from the reactor flux on
November 25, 1974, by retracting the experiment 13
-in. from the reactor face. On December 3, 1974, it was
removed from the poolside facility and hung on the
south side of the pool with the fuel pins kept at 150°C

to prevent fluorine evolution from the fuel salt. On
February 10, 1975, the power was cut off the heaters,
and the fuel pins were moved to the ORR hot cells for
disassembly. ,

The fuel pins were examined visually and photographs
were taken during disassembly. Figure 7.50 is a com-
posite photograph of the three fuel pins when first
removed from the NaK-filled assembly. A 50% mixture
of alcohol and mineral oil was used to remove the NaK
residue. Some unreacted residue can be seen on the
thermocouple wires at the top left in the photograph.
The Inconel 601 fuel pin was at the bottom (right),
Hastelloy N in the middle, and type 304 stainless steel
at the top (left). All the fuel pins, heater coils,

excellent condition. It was determined from flux
monitors and thermocouple readings -that the surface
shown in the photograph was facing the reactor during
operation. The longer section of Y 4-in. heater coils was
at the top and the shorter coil at the bottom of each
fuel pin. The thermocouples are the same size (%6 in.)
as the heater coils, and the flux monitors are smaller
wires. The shaded areas in.the photograph arise from a
difference in lighting for the several photographs
required for the composite. The titanium flux monitors
were embrittled and could not be removed intact, but
the other monitors were in excellent condition. The
fuel pins were separated from the assembly, identified,
and placed in a furnace at 150°C to prevent fluorine
evolution. They were maintained at this temperature
except during transfer between hot cells and during
gamma scanning and sectioning in the hot cells.
The fuel pins were gamma-scanned in the High

facility using a sodium iodide detector in conjunction
with a 17-in.-thick lead collimator with a 1-X-0.01-in.
slit. A counting time of 1 min and an excitation
potential of 10 keV/channel were used for the
irradiated-salt-bearing portions of fuel pins, and a
10-min counting time was used for the gas plenum and
an unirradiated control pin (Hastelloy N pin 2A) and
for background. Figure 7.51 shows the gamma scans of
the three fuel pins (length in inches vs counts per
minute, with 100,000 being full scale) scanning from
the bottom to the top. Note that the top pin (type 304
stainless steel) and the middle pin (Hastelloy N) have a
spike or sudden increase in activity at the top of the
fuel, but the bottom pin (Inconel 601) has lower
activity and does not have the spike. No explanation
can be given presently for these differences.

pins appear to be in qualitative agreement with their
initial chemical analysis. For example, 3! Cr is higher in
Inconel 601, intermediate in type 304 stainless steel,
and lowest in Hastelloy N. Additionally, ®°Co is higher
in Hastelloy N, intermediate in type 304 stainless steel,
and lowest in Inconel 601. These can occur by (n,p) or
(n,y) reactions with the chromium, nickel, iron, and

cobalt in the alloys. The chemical analyses of the fuel
pins are given in Table 7.19.

Figure 7.53 shows gamma-scan plots of energy vs
counts per minute per channel for the three fuel pins at
or near the top of the fuel. For the type 304 stainless
steel and the Hastelloy N pins, the scan was on the
activity spike noted in Fig. 7.51. Inconel 601 did not
have an activity spike at the top of the fuel, and a scan
was taken approximately % in. from the top of the
fuel. The major difference in the scans appeared to be
in the peak at approximately 0.485 MeV contributed to
by '°3Ru, '%%1a, #5Kr, and *®Co and in the peak at

0.78 MeV contributed to by ?3Zr and °>Nb. Scans
were taken at the middle and bottom of the fuel, but
the scans were similar to the ones just discussed except
that the peak intensities were slightly lower.

The diameters of the fuel pins were measured in the
hot cells with a micrometer (Table 7.20). The pre-test
diameters were only known to satisfy the design range
of 0.500 to 0.501 in. The tubes were generally smaller
at the gas plenum and largest near the middle. The
maximum diametral change of 0.9% occurred in the
Inconel 601 pin. These changes most likely occurred
from several cycles of alternately melting and freezing
the salt. ’

The pins were sectioned in HRLEL according to the
schematic in Fig. 7.54. The ¥ ¢-in. rings (designated A)
were for mechanical property tests, Auger, and metallo-
graphic examination, the ¥%-in. rings (designated B)
were for leach and salt analysis, and the remaining
sections (designated C) were retained as backup speci-

mens. The rings were cut by flexible abrasive cutoff
wheel (dry) with the pins held in a rotating chuck so
that cuts were made just through the tube wall and not
through the salt. The abrasive cutoff wheel was approxi-
mately 0.030 in. thick, but cuts nearly 0.06 in. wide
were made due to the slight flexing of the blade during
cutting.

Visual examination of the meniscus of the fuel salt
revealed differences in the appearance of the three pins.
Figure 7.55 shows macrophotographs (approx 6X) of
the meniscus after removal of the top cap and one
Y ¢-in. ring for pin A, the top cap and four %-in. and
one Y-in. ring for pin B, and the top cap and two
Y 6-in. and one Y%-in. ring for pin C. The meniscus of
the type 304 stainless steel pin appeared to be level,
with dendritic structure and shrinkage voids formed on
solidification of the salt. It was difficult to obtain
proper lighting on the meniscus at that depth from the
lights on the stereomicroscope. The meniscus on the

top. (b) Hastelloy N fuel pin, middle. (c) Inconel 601 fuel pin, bottom. Reduced 22%.

Hastelloy N pin (Fig. 7.55b) had a different appearance,
and the salt appeared to have solidified at an angle
(with the high side toward the reactor face or possibly
180° away). The marking identifying the side facing the
reactor was wiped off accidentally and remarked by its
relationship with the top and bottom pins, so there
could have been a 180° rotation of the mark. At higher
magnification there was some dendritic appearance, and
some holes were visible in the salt surface. The meniscus
of the salt in the Inconel 601 pin also appeared to have
solidified at an angle, with the high side of the salt
toward the reactor face. Holes were visible at the salt
surface and where the abrasive saw went through the
top of the meniscus. The salt surface had a dendritic
appearance, and some shrinkage voids were present.

No explanation can be given at this time for the
differences in the appearance of the salt surfaces in the
three fuel pins. Chemical analysis of the salt near the
top and bottom of the salt may provide additional
information. As the experiment was retracted from the
reactor flux, about 13 in. away from the reactor face,
the slightly higher flux in the middle (Hastelloy N) and
bottom (Inconel 601) pins probably kept them molten
for a longer time than the top (type 304 stainless steel)
pin. When fully retracted the pins were at a small angle
from vertical, with the pivotal point being 132 in. above
the bottom pin. The pins were at a small angle (2.3%)
when in operating position, vertical when retracted 8
in., and at a small angle (4.6°) in the other direction
when retracted 13 in. from the reactor face.

131

Ten of the "¢-in. rings from each pin (Fig. 7.54)
were tensile-tested in an Instron tensile machine in the
hot cells. The rings were slipped over a split-ring fixture
and pulled in tension until failure occurred. Due to the
difficulty of deburring the rings without damaging the
important inside surfaces, most of the rings were not
deburred properly, and some slipped out of the fixture
upon loading. A clamp held most of the rings in the
fixture to prevent their slipping out. Friction of the
clamp on the pull rods probably contributed to the
higher yield stress on some of the specimens, but the
ultimate tensile strength probably was not affected as
much because of the higher loads. No correction has
been made for the clamp friction. The clamp friction
varied from 20 to 70 lb for typical runs, and the
ultimate loads were approximately 500 Ib. The control
specimens included for comparison were tested without
the clamp.

Tensile data for the irradiated fuel pins and unirradi-
ated control specimens are given in Tables 7.21-7.23.
An arbitrarily assumed gage length of 0.5 in. was used
in the calculation of the yield strength and the uniform
and total elongations. The values in the tables are not
absolute but are useful for comparisons within the
series. The properties affected most were the reduction
in area and the elongation. Hastelloy N was affected
most, type 304 stainless steel was intermediate, and
Inconel 601 was affected least, if at all. These changes
are due to the combined effects of the thermal neutrons
and the shallow cracking caused by the fission products.

The rings were numbered consecutively from the top of
each fuel pin as shown in Fig. 7.54.

Several rings were chosen near the fuel level for
examination. In the MSRE, the most severe cracking of
deformed Hastelloy N occurred near the salt-to-gas
interface. Rings No. 2 (at or just above the interface),
No. 5 (just below the surface), and No. 16 (near the
bottom of the fuel salt) were examined metallographi-
cally. Figure 7.56 shows photomicrographs of the
fractures of 304 stainless steel fuel pin rings after tensile
testing at 25°C. There were some cracks approx 1 mil
deep in each of the pins-on the surfaces that were
exposed to fuel salt and fission products, but the
cracking frequency was slightly greater in ring 4, at or
just below the salt surface. :

Figure 7.57 shows photomicrographs of the Hastelloy
N irradiated fuel-pin rings tensile-tested at 25°C. Ring 2
was at or just above the salt surface, ring 5 was at or
just below the salt surface, and ring 16 was at the
bottom of the salt. All rings developed extensive
intergranular cracks, but rings 2 and 16 appeared to
have about equal depth (2 mils) and frequency of
cracks, and ring 5 had shallower cracks about 1 mil
deep. The reason for the difference is not known.

Figure 7.58 shows photomicrographs of the rings
from the Inconel 601 fuel pin after tensile-testing at
25°C. Ring 2 was at or just above the salt level, ring S
was at or just below the salt level, and ring 16 was at
the bottom of the salt. Ring 2 had the greatest depth of
cracking of approximately ' mil. Ring 5 had some fine
cracking averaging approxim_ately Y% mil. Ring 16 at the
bottom of the salt resisted cracking to the greatest
degree of any of the specimens. There were a-few tiny
cracks (approx 0.1 mil) on both the inside exposed to
salt and the outside exposed to NaK, but a few such
cracks might be expected in unexposed tubing tested in
this manner. Inconel 601 appears to be the most
resistant to cracking caused by exposure to fuel salt and
fission products of the three materials tested in
TeGen-1.

133

These observations strengthen our supposition that
tellurium is responsible for the intergranular cracking in
Hastelloy N. Laboratory experiments showed that
intergranular cracking could be caused in Hastelloy N
by exposure to tellurium and that alloys such as Inconel
601, which contain 23% Cr, were resistant to cracking
under reasonable exposure conditions. The profuse
cracking of Hastelloy N and the sparsity of cracks in
Inconel 601 in the TeGen-1 experiment are in excellent
agreement with the laboratory experiments. The
behavior of type 304 stainless steel was not pursued
adequately in our laboratory experiments to make a
prediction about how it would react with fission
products other than tellurium. Numerous studies by
other investigators have indicated interactions between
stainless steels and fission products such as iodine and
cesium. However, these studies were not made with salt
systems, and the applicability of such studies to the
TeGen-1 capsules is questionable.

Analytical chemistry samples were taken from each
fuel pin designated B in Fig. 7.54, numbering consecu-
tively from the top. Specimen B-1 was from the gas
plenum, B-2 from near the top of the salt, and B-3 from
near the bottom of the salt. The three metal rings of
each pin will be leached with a “verbocit” leach®® to
remove salt residue and loosely bound fission products,
and a second leach (aqua regia) to remove approxi-
mately 1 mil of the metal from each surface. The
solutions from both leaches will be gamma-scanned for
fission products, and chemical separations will be
performed as needed for further analysis. Salt samples
were taken from specimens B-2 and B-3 of each fuel
pin: These are being gamma-scanned for fission prod-
ucts and analyzed for corrosion products. These analy-
ses are not complete but should help in understanding
the differences noted in the behavior of the fuel pins.

8. Fuel Processing Materials Development

J. R. DiStefan

A principal requirement for structural materials to be
used in the reductive extragtiori and metal-transfer
processes for fuel salt processing is compatibility with
bismuth-lithium and molten salt solutions: Past studies
have indicated that iron-, nickel-, or cobalt-base alloys
are not acceptable because of high rates of
temperature-gradient mass transfer in bismuth-lithium;
but graphite, molybdenum, and tantalum alloys are
promising. Graphite has low solubility in pure bismuth
(less than 1 ppm at 600°C) and has excellent compati-
bility with molten fluoride salts. Although attacked by
lithium, graphite has shown excellent resistance to
bismuth-lithium solutions (up to 3 wt % Li) at
temperatures as high as 700°C. The open structure of
the graphite does permit intrusion of liquid, and the
amount of penetration has been found to be a function
of graphite bulk density, accessible poré volume, and
pore diameter. During the repbrting period, studies
concentrated on graphite-bismuth-lithium systems.

8.1 STATIC CAPSULE TESTS OF GRAPHITE WITH
BISMUTH AND BISMUTH-LITHIUM SOLUTIONS

J. R. DiStefano 0. B. Cavin

The program to evaluate the compatibility of graphite
with fuel processing fluids was directed to five research
problems:

1. the solubility of carbon in bismuth-lithium solutions

at 650°C,

the rate of thermal-gradient mass transfer of graphite

in Bi—2.5% Li (Section 8.2),

. the formation of intercalation compounds between
graphite and fuel processing fluids,

. the evaluation of coatings and impregnation tech-
niques to reduce penetration of graphite by fuel
processing fluids, and

. the penetration of graphite as a function of pore size
and density of the graphite and lithium content of
the bismuth-lithium solution.

H. E. McCoy

The results reported for the last period® indicated
increased carbon in bismuth-lithium solutions as a
function of increasing lithium content after exposure to
graphite for 1000 hr at 650°C. The grades of graphite
included were PGX,2 PGXX,* and ATJ.* These were
exposed to Bi—100 ppm Li, Bi—1% Li, Bi—2% Li, and
Bi—3% Li. Additional tests have been run for 3000 hr,
Results were similar to those found after 1000 hr
except that slightly lower values of carbon were
measured in the 3000-hr tests.

Previously, -improper handling of bismuth-lithium
samples before analysis led to spuriously high carbon

-and oxygen. values. In all- cases, samples are exposed to

137

air during the few seconds it takes to transfer them into
the analytical apparatus. However, slightly different
procedures were used in subsequently handling the
1000-hr and 3000-hr samples.- Samples analyzed after
1000-hr exposures were loaded into the apparatus, and
then the system was evacuated and filled with argon.
Samples analyzed. after 3000-hr exposure were loaded
into the apparatus after it had previously been evacu-
ated and backfilled with argon. Determinations of
carbon are compared in Table 8.1 along with values for

0Xygen that were obtained on the samples exposed for

3000 hr. Lower values for carbon after 3000 hr may be
related to the handling procedure. However, probably
the low oxygen values and- the relative consistency of
the data confirm that the carbon solubility in bismuth-
lithium does increase with increasing lithium content of
the solution.

Graphite (PGX,2 PGXX,® ATJ,* pyrocarbon coated,®
and AXF-5Q%) was also exposed to Bi—3% Li—100

ppm K and to Bi—3% Li—100 ppm Cs for 1000 hr at

450 and 650°C. Potassium and cesium are possible
fission product or trace contaminants in fuel salt, and
they have been reported to form intercalation com-
pounds with graphite.” Compounds of this type are
formed by chemical interaction at the edge of the
graphite layer planes, and diffusion can then occur into
the graphite between the layer planes. Thus, one
method of detecting the formation of these compounds
is an expansion of the ¢ lattice parameter of the
graphite. Visual observations did not indicate any
differences among the various tests except that graphite
tested in molybdenum containers at 650°C had a
metallic appearance. The results are summarized in
Table 8.2.

No expansion of the lattice parameters of any of the
graphites was found, but several samples did show
unidentified lines. Chemical analyses showed that the
samples all contained Li, Bi, and either K or Cs. (The
various analytical methods used vary with regard to the
size of the sample, so the reported values should be
considered as indicative of trends rather than absolute
values.) Bismuth was detected in all but one of the
sample sets analyzed by x ray, but the other elements,
which were usually present in smaller concentrations,
were not. Chemical analyses also confirmed that mass
transfer of molybdenum to graphite occurred at 650°C.

Selected metallographic samples showed that penetra-
tion was greater in PGX and PGXX graphites than in
the other graphites. This was expected since they have
greater amounts of open porosity. Although none of
the pyrocarbon-coated samples showed evidence of
penetration, the coating spalled from several of the
samples after the tests. Since the base graphite appeared

quite porous, it seems that more adherent coatings are
required,

Previous tests of graphite with lithium at 700°C
resulted in conversion of lithium to Li,C, after 1000
hr. To further study reactions of lithium with graphite,
tests were conducted for 1000 hr at 250 and 650°C
using several different grades of graphite specimens in
an ATJ graphite holder. Extensive reactions occurred at
both temperatures, and in no case could the specimens
be separated from the holder. Specimens. exposed at
250°C were soaked in alcohol and then water to remove
the excess lithium that did not drain from them. As a
result they formed a black surface layer which could
easily be removed by sanding. However, when left in air
they turned black again, indicating that they contained
lithium, which continued to react with air. Graphite
with unchanged g and c lattice parameters along with
other unidentified lines were found by x-ray analysis.
The unidentified lines did not correspond to Li,C, or
to the intercalation compounds C, ¢ Li and C4 ¢ Li.

After exposure to lithium at 650°C in a molybdenum
container, one set of graphite specimens was contacted
with alcohol and water. The specimens dissolved in the
solution accompanied by the strong order of acetylene.
Acetylene could have formed from the reaction Li,C,
+ 2H,0 = 2LiOH + C,H,. This indicates that the
graphite had probably been converted to lithium
carbide during exposure to lithium. Additional graphite
specimens were also exposed at 650°C, except this time
in a graphite capsule instead of a molybdenum one. The
samples and graphite holder were converted to a chalky,
greenish-yellow product. An x-ray powder sample of
this product was prepared in an argon-atmosphere
chamber and loaded into a sealed capillary tube to
prevent reaction of the product with air prior to
analysis. The reaction product was identified as ortho-
rhombic Li, C,.

Capsule tests are now in progress to evaluate the
effectiveness of chemically vapor-deposited molyb-
denum coatings in sealing ATJ graphite against penetra-
tion by Bi—3% Li at 650°C. Graphites having variable
density and different but uniform pore sizes are being
used in tests to characterize more precisely penetration
as a function of the internal structure of the graphite.

8.2 THERMAL-CONVECTION LOOP TESTS

J. R. DiStefano

An important requirement of materials to be used for
containment of bismuth-lithium solutions during fuel
processing is resistance to mass transfer in the presence
of a temperature gradient. Although graphite has low
solubility in pure bismuth (less than | ppm at 600°C),
recent capsule tests suggest that considerably higher
concentrations are present in Bi-2% Li and Bi—3% Li
solutions. To avoid the developmental problems associ-
ated with fabrication of a graphite loop, a molybdenum
loop was constructed, and interlocking tabular graphite
specimens were suspended in the hot- and cold-leg
sections (Fig. 8.1). The solution Bi—2.5% Li is being
circulated at 700°C maximum hot-leg temperature and
a temperature gradient of approximately 100°C. It has
completed approximately 800 hr of a scheduled 3000
hr of operation. :

Apparatus (Fig. 8.2) was constructed to prepare the
bismuth-lithium solution for this test. Lithium was first
purified by hot gettering with zirconium foil at 800°C,
and the required amount was transferred into a type

304 stainless steel container as shown. Sequential steps
were then as follows:

1. Solid bismuth was loaded into a molybdenum-lined
stainless steel container and the container sealed
under argon atmosphere.

2. The bismuth container was evacuated and heated to
650°C.

3. Hydrogen was bubbled through the molten bismuth
for 24 hr.

- 4. The temperature of the bismuth was raised to
700°C, and lithium in a separate type 304 stainless
steel vessel was heated to 250°C.

5. Lithium was transferred into the bismuth container
using a pressure differential. _

6. The mixture was bubbled with argon about 2 hr for
mixing.

After alloying, a sample was taken and the following
analyses obtained: Li, 2.35%; H;, 14 ppm; O;, 90 ppm.
The alloy was cooled to room temperature and the
container attached to the loop by means of a mechani-
cal connector. Although the melting temperature of the
alloy should be about 450°C, transfer into the loop
could not be effected until the bismuth-lithium was
heated to 900°C for over 24 hr.

This test measures the corrosion rate of graphite
exposed to a high-lithium—bismuth solution in a
temperature-gradient system. However, capsule test
results (Sect. 8.1) suggest that mass transfer of molyb-
denum to graphite will likely occur. If so, accurate
temperature-gradient mass-transfer data may not be
obtained.

8.3 TESTS OF OXIDATION-RESISTANT COATINGS
ON MILD STEEL PIPE

B. McNabb  J. A. Hackney  H. E. McCoy

Carbon steel vessels have been used extensively in fuel
processing studies. Mild steel vessels have acceptable
compatibility with fuel salt, bismuth, and molten LiCl
in many applications but must be protected from the
external air environment to prevent excessive oxidation
at higher temperatures. In the past, one approach to
protection from oxidation was to flame spray the
outside of the vessels with various aluminide coatings.
In most instances, these coatings offered excellent
resistance, but some failures of the coatings had been
noted. In discussions with the vendor (Metco) and the
Plant and Equipment Division personnel who apply the
coatings, some suggestions were made as to the type of
coating and method of application for uniformity of
the coating.

The type of coating used most frequently in the past
was Metco M405-10; however, the type recommended
most highly by Metco for this application was Metco
P443-10. Metco M405-10 is a self-bonding coating; the
“M” denotes metallizing wire. Its composition is 80%
nickel and 20% aluminum. It is flame-sprayed, using
oxygen and acetylene and deposits as a nickel-
aluminum alloy plus oxides in the coating.

Metco P443-10 is a self-bonding argon-plasma-sprayed
coating. The “P” denotes plasma-sprayed powder. A
nitrogen-hydrogen mixture can also be used in the
plasma-spraying process, but argon is recommended.
The composition is nominally 80% nickel and 20%
chromium, to which 6% aluminum powder is added.
The coating density is about 7.5 g/cm?, and the typical
particle size is —-120 to +325 mesh. The approximate
melting point (aluminum constituents) is 660°C. The
aluminum reacts with the base material exothermically
to yield a self-bonding coating. A spray or grit-blasted
surface preparation is recommended for both coatings.

Two longitudinal half sections of 6-in.-diam mild steel
pipe were metal-sprayed with these two different
coatings. One half section, 8% in. long, was flame-
sprayed using a wire gun and the nickel aluminide
coating wire (Metco No. M405-10). The other half
section, 4%, in. long, was plasma-sprayed with a
nickel-chromium alloy containing 6% aluminum (Metco
No. P443-10 powder). Both pieces were coated on all
exposed surfaces to a depth of approximately 0.010 in.,
and the wall thickness of the pipe was approximately
0.3 in.

The two coated pieces were placed on firebricks in
the center of a furnace and heated at 700°C (1292°F)
over a 2-hr period. Samples were held 48 hr at 700°C
and furnace-cooled to 100°C, and the cycle was
repeated. The total time at 700°C (1292°F) was 403.7
hr; there were five thermal cycles to 100°C (212°F) and
three thermal cycles to room temperature for visual
examination. In a photograph of the two coated pieces,
after 403.7 hr at 700°C (1292°F) with eight thermal
cycles to lower temperatures, both coatings appear
intact (Fig. 8.3). The darker areas on the Metco
M405-10 piece were reddish (rust colored), and the
lighter areas were light gray. The weight gain was about
10.3 mg/cm?. The nickel-chromium plus 6% aluminum
coating was a uniform darker gray, with only a small
area of rust-colored oxidation product at one edge. The
weight gain was about 7.3 mg/cm?.

Both coatings appear satisfactory for use at 700°C
(1292°F) for relatively short times of exposure, but the
nickel-chromium plus 6% aluminum coating appears to
be superior.

cycles to lower temperatures.

In fuel processing studies it is desirable to know the
effects of temperature excursions to higher-than-normal
operating temperatures. Therefore, evaluation of these
coatings at 815°C (1500°F) was also undertaken. In
addition to the 403.7 hr at 700°C (1292°F), the total
time at 815°C (1500°F) was 520 hr, with five thermal
cycles to 100°C (212°F) and three thermal cycles to
room temperature for visual examination. The cycling
at 815°C was done on the same schedule as the 700°C,
that is, 48 hr at the upper temperature between cycles
to lower temperatures. The total weight gain for the
oxidation at 700°C and 815°C was 69.18 mg/em? for
the M405-10 coating and 20.54 mg/em? for the
P443-10 coating. Some spalling near the edges of the
pipe section occurred on the M405-10 coating, so the
weight change may actually be a little large. Some of
the scale had cracked near one edge of the P443-10
coating, but it appeared to be intact at the time of
weighing.

Figures 8.4 and 8.5 are photographs of the coated
half sections of pipe after oxidizing in air for 403.7 hr
at 700°C (1292°F) and 520 hr at 815°C (1500°F).
Figure 8.4 shows the worst area of coating M405-10 on
the left where some spalling occurred. Figure 8.5 shows
the worst area on the P443-10 coating on the right. The
darker areas are reddish (rust) colored, and the lighter

areas are grayish. The P443-10 coating appears smooth
and adherent except at one edge, where the coating
may have been thinner. No measurements were made
on coating thickness, and variations in wall thickness of
the pipe were probably of the order of the coating
thickness. Wall thickness of the pipe plus the coating
varied from 0.263 in. at one edge to 0.299 in. at
another edge for the M4-5-10 coated piece.
Metallographic specimens were cut from the worst
and best areas of each coated piece for examination of
the bond between the metal and coating. Figures
8.6—8.8 are photographs of the M405-10 coated sec-
tions. Figure 8.6 is a magnification of a section through
the worst and best areas of the pipe section coated with
M405-10. Oxide formed beneath the coating and lifted
it from the surface. The thickness of the remaining
unoxidized metal was reduced considerably in the

of a typical edge of the wrost-appearing area showing
the separation of the oxide from the surface. Figure 8.8
is a photomicrograph of a typical edge of the best-

metal and oxide during thermal cycling caused the
oxide to spall.

Figure 8.9 is a photomicrograph of the worst- and
best-appearing areas of the pipe section coated with
P443-10. In the worst-appearing area the oxide has
separated from the metal, but the remaining unoxidized
metal was thicker than was the M405-10 coating in
similar areas (Fig. 8.6).

Figure 8.10 is a photomicrograph of an area where
the oxide and coating separated but very little oxida-
tion occurred below the coating. This possibly indicates
that some of the elements in the coating may have
diffused into the base metal. A comparison of Figs. 8.6

and 8.9 shows that more unoxidized metal remained on
the P443-10 coated pipe section than on the M405-10
section in the worst of each case. Figure 8.11 is a
photomicrograph of a typical edge of the best-appearing
area of coating P443-10. There appears to be very little
oxidation of the metal at the coating-to-metal interface,
indicating that the coating is an effective barrier to the
inward diffusion of oxygen.

In this admittedly limited testing of oxidation-
resistant coatings, it appears that the P443-10 coating is
superior to the M405-10 coating for this application. It
appears to give adequate protection when applied
properly.

Part 4. Fuel Processing for Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors
J. R. Hightower, Jr.

Part 4 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the removal of fission
products from molten-salt breeder reactors. During this
period studies were continued of the chemistry of fuel
reconstitution, studies of autoresistance heating for use
in a frozen-wall fluorinator, studies of mass transfer in
agitated contactors using both molten-salt—bismuth and
mercury-water systems, and installation of experimental
equipment for a metal transfer experiment and a fuel
reconstitution engineering experiment. Studies of mass
transfer in open bubble columns (carried out in the
Chemical Engineering Research Program funded by the
ERDA Division of Physical Research) were continued.
Floor plans for an MSBR Fuel Processing Engineering
Center were accepted, and the conceptual design was
started.

In studies of the chemistry of fuel reconstitution it
was found that the rate of reduction of UF; dissolved
in fuel salt by hydrogen gas followed zero-order kinetics
at 550°C. The rate constant was independent of
uranium concentration, hydrogen - flow rate, and
hydrogen pressure. Hydrogen utilization in these tests
was less than 1%. The reaction appeared to follow
first-order kinetics at 675°C. The apparent reaction rate
was increased by approximately two orders of
magnitude and hydrogen utilization was increased to
nearly stoichiometric by the addition of platinum
catalysts to the melt. Even trace quantities of platinum
that combined with the gold reaction vessel liner were
adequate to effect the same increase; thus practical
application of this finding can be readily attained in the
fuel reconstitution step.

Engineering experiments to study the steps in the
metal transfer process for removing rare-earth fission
products from molten-salt breeder reactor fuel salt are
to be continued in new process vessels which duplicate
those used in a previous experiment, MTE-3.
Installation and preoperational testing of the equipment
for this experiment, designated MTE-3B, have been
completed. The addition of the several salt and bismuth

phases to the salt-bismuth contactor and stripper vessels
is under way. Probably one to two months will be
needed to complete these additions before starting
experiments to measure the transfer rates for removal
of rare earths from the fuel carrier salt.

The seventh, eighth, and ninth tracer runs (TSMC-7,
-8, and -9) were completed in the mild steel contactor
installed in the salt-bismuth flow-through facility in
Building 3592. Run TSMC-7 was made at a low agitator
speed (68 rpm) to help define the effect of agitator
speed on the salt-phase mass-transfer coefficient under
conditions where salt is not dispersed into the bismuth.
The mass-transfer coefficient for this run was 0.0057 +
0.0012 cm/sec, which is 65% of the value predicted by
the Lewis correlation. Run TSMC-9 was made at a high
agitator speed (244 rpm) to determine the mass-transfer
coefficient under conditions where salt is dispersed into
the bismuth and to determine if large amounts of
bismuth and salt are entrained in the other phase. The
mass-transfer coefficient was 0.121 + 0.108 cm/sec,
which is 178% of the value predicted by the Lewis
correlation. The data suggest that when the phases are
not dispersed, the effect of agitator speed on the
mass-transfer coefficient is less than that predicted by
the Lewis correlation.

Mass-transfer rates between water and mercury have
been measured in a mechanically agitated contactor
using the reaction

Pb2*[H, 0] + Zn[Hg] - Zn**[H,0] + Pb[Hg] .

Data from a series of five experiments have been
reanalyzed using a model that was based on the
assumptions that the reaction is instantaneous and
irreversible and occurs entirely at the water-mercury
interface i an attempt to determine if an apparent
change in mass-transfer coefficient during the execution
of a run was due to the controlling resistance to mass
transfer changing from one phase to the other. Several
inconsistencies were found between the model and the
experiment data. Several runs were made in the
water-mercury contactor at an elevated temperature
("40°C) to test the validity of the assumption that the
interfacial reaction is instantaneous. Results from these
tests were inconclusive.

Investigation was started to determine if polarography
is a viable alternative method for measuring
mass-transfer rates in a stirred interface contactor using
mercury and an aqueous electrolyte solution. Several
electrolyte solutions were investigated but none was
found to be entirely inert to mercury. Information
found in the literature suggested that the Fe**-Fe**
redox couple (using iron complexed with oxalate ions)
may be suitable as an electrolyte for this application.
Further tests will be performed to determine whether
the iron oxalate electrolyte will produce suitable
polarograms.

Additional runs were made in a simulated fluorinator
in which the vessel wall is protected by a frozen salt
film and fission product heating is simulated by
autoresistance heating. MSBR fuel salt was used in these
tests. Successful operation was not achieved with the
electrode in a side arm (necessary to avoid corrosion
when using fluorine). However, several apparently

149

successful runs were made with the electrode at the top
of the vertical test section. It is believed that successful
operation with the electrode in the side arm will be
demonstrated in the next experiment, now being
installed, which will use a circulating salt stream.
Measurements of mass-transfer rates in open bubble
columns during CQO, absorption in water were con-
tinued. Results were extended to include the effects of
liquid viscosity as well as effects of gas and liquid flow
rates on mass-transfer rates. Further improvements were
made in the experimental technique, and all previous
data were critically reevaluated. The new data were
combined with the most reliable data from earlier work
to produce correlations for estimating liquid-film mass-

transfer coefficients.

Installation of the fuel reconstitution engineering
experiment in Building 7503 is expected to be com-
pleted in early April 1975. Details of the equipment for
this experiment are described.

A floor plan for the MSBR Fuel Processing Engi-
neering Center has been developed, reviewed, and
approved. The conceptual design of the building is
under way, and an Engineering Job Plan for the design
has been developed.

9. Chemistry of Fluorination and Fuel Reconstitution

M. R. Bennett

The chemistry of the fluorination and fuel reconstitu-
tion steps of the reference processing plant flowsheet
was reviewed in the preceding report.! In previous
experimental studies of the reaction of hydrogen with
UF; dissolved in fuel carrier salt, the hydrogen utiliza-
tion and the rate of reaction were found to be low.?

A detailed investigation of the reaction

2UFs(d) * Ha(g) > 2UF,4(d) + 2HF(g) (1)

was carried out during this report period. In a typical
experiment, a 200-g charge of fuel carrier salt (72-16-12
mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,) plus about 1 to 4 wt % UF,
was placed in a gold reactor and sparged with equimolar
H,-HF at 600°C for about 24 hr to remove oxide
contaminants. Then the stoichiometric amount of
gaseous UF, was contacted with the salt at 600°C to
convert all the uranium to UFs. The temperature was
then adjusted to the desired reaction temperature, and
the salt was sparged with hydrogen to reduce the UF;
to UF,. Samples of the salt were withdrawn at intervals
and subsequently analyzed for U** and U*" content by
the Analytical Chemistry Division using the procedure
described previously.? Normally, the reducing gas flow
rate was 40 cc/min for the first 4 hr and then 120
cc/min for an additional 4 hr. The reducing gas was
either pure hydrogen or an argon-hydrogen mixture.

In the first series of tests, at 550°C, the rate of
reduction followed zero-order kinetics. In this case, the
rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration
of the reacting substance; thus, '

_adn_g, )

dt

where n is the number of moles of substance under-
going reduction, ¢ is the time in hours, and X is the rate
constant. From the integrated form of Eq. (2), it
follows that a plot of the number of moles of UF;
reduced vs time should be linear with a slope of K. Data
from the experiments at 550°C are plotted in this
manner (Fig. 9.1). All the data are consistent with

zero-order behavior. The rate of reduction was inde-
pendent of uranium concentration, hydrogen flow rate,
and hydrogen partial pressure. The data yield a rate
constant of 0.00135 mole/hr.

The effect of temperature was evaluated in one test at
675°C. A pronounced increase in the rate of reaction
was observed, and the data gave an excellent fit for
first-order kinetics, a linear relationship of In [U**] vs
time, indicating a probable change in the reaction
mechanism or rate-limiting step at the higher tempera-
ture. In all the tests the hydrogen utilization was low
(<1%); most of the gas simply bubbled through the
melt. ]

Dissociation of the hydrogen molecule to yield
reactive hydrogen atoms is often a rate-limiting step in
hydrogenation reactions and would be consistent with
the zero-order kinetics observed at 550°C. Therefore,

tests were initiated to study the effect of adding
catalysts to the molten salt prior to hydrogen reduc-
tion. When 500 mg of platinum-black catalyst was
added to the salt prior to sparging with hydrogen in
Test 8-UR (Table 9.1), the reduction was complete in
less than 30 min and the hydrogen utilization was 90 to
100%. The possibility that a reaction was occurring
between the platinum catalyst and the UFs to yield
UF, or that catalytic disproportionation of UF; was
occurring to yield some UF, was precluded in Test
11-UR (Table 9.1), in which the U* concentration was
increased to 4.14 wt % and the solution was exposed to
the catalyst for 2 hr in the absence of H,. No US*
reduction occurred. Following introduction of hydro-
gen, the reduction was again nearly complete in 30 min.
Following these tests, during cleanup of the reactor, a
discoloration and granular appearance on the bottom of
the gold liner and also at the salt-gas interface indicated,

-presumably, that some of the platinum had alloyed

with or sintered to the liner. Test 12-UR was then made
to see whether this material exhibited catalytic activity.
The results (Table 9.1) again showed complete reduc-
tion in less than 30 min and near stoichiometric
hydrogen utilization. This fortuitous result suggests that
it will be easy to take advantage of the catalytic effect
in engineering-scale apparatus by combining platinum
with gold components of the fuel reconstitution equip-
ment. The catalyst increased the rate of reduction of
UF; to about 100 times the previous value and will
thus permit the design of smaller and simpler engi-
neering apparatus. ‘

Additional experiments are under way to attempt to
define the rate-limiting step in the catalytic reduction
and also to investigate the effect, if any, of noble-metal
fission products likely to be found in this portion of an
MSBR processing system.

10.1 DEVELOPMENT OF METAL
TRANSFER PROCESS

H. C. Savage

Engineering experiments to study the steps in the
metal transfer process for removing rare-earth fission
products from molten-salt breeder reactor fuel salt will
be continued in new process vessels which duplicate
those used in a previous experiment, MTE-3." Mechani-
cally agitated contactors®> will be used to achieve
effective rates of transfer of the rare-earth fission
products between the salt and metal phases.

Installation of the new equipment for the experiment,
designated MTE-3B, in Building 3541 was completed
during this report period. The preoperational testing of
the vessels, mechanical agitator, and associated auxiliary
equipment is complete. Work is now in the initial stages
of adding the salt and bismuth phases to the fuel-salt
reservoir vessel and the mechanically agitated contactor
and stripper vessels.

10.1.1 Installation and Preoperational Tests
of Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-3B

Installation of equipment for experiment MTE-3B
was completed during this report period. Figure 10.1 is
a photograph of the process vessels with the heaters and
thermocouples attached. Figure 10.2 is a photograph of
the completed experimental facility with the thermal
insulation on the vessels and with the mechanical
agitators and all process piping and associated equip-
ment installed.

On completion of the installation, all process instru-
mentation (cooling water and purge-gas flowmeters,
pressure gages, thermocouples, temperature indicators
and recorders, and the agitator speed control units)
were tested and calibrated. The carbon steel process
vessels were then heated to "650°C, and the interior
surfaces of the equipment were hydrogen treated to
remove any residual oxides.

The charging of the several salt and bismuth phases to
the vessels is now under way. All the necessary

materials are on hand. We have received the required
fuel carrier salt (120 kg of 72-16-12 mole %
LiF-BeF,-ThF,) from the salt production facility at
Y-12. The bismuth, thorium, and lithium chloride are
available from stocks used previously in experiment
MTE-3. The charging of the salts and bismuth requires
the temporary installation of the charging vessels along
with the required heaters and temperature indicating
and control circuits. Careful procedures are followed to
ensure that the correct amounts of each phase are
added to the system and to prevent contamination of
the salts and metals by oxides (air, water) during the
charging operations. Probably, one to two months will
be required to complete these additions before experi-
ments are started to measure the rates of removal of
rare-earth elements from the fuel carrier salt.

Currently we have installed the bismuth charging
vessel and have hydrogen-fired it, added ~90 kg of
bismuth metal to the vessel, and sparged the bismuth
with hydrogen to remove oxides; we are preparing to
transfer the bismuth into the salt-metal contactor.

10.2 SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT:
EXPERIMENTS WITH A MECHANICALLY
AGITATED NONDISPERSING CONTACTOR IN
THE SALT-BISMUTH FLOW-THROUGH
FACILITY

C. H. Brown, Jr.

In continued operation is a facility in which mass-
transfer rates between molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) and molten bismuth can be meas-
ured in a mechanically agitated nondispersing contactor
of the Lewis type.> A total of nine experimental runs
have been completed to date. Results from the first six
runs have been previously reported.* Preparation for
and results obtained from the seventh, eighth, and ninth
runs (TSMC-7, -8, and -9, respectively) are discussed in
the following sections.

In preparation for each of the three runs made during
this report period it was necessary to (1) add beryllium
to the salt to adjust the uranium distribution coeffi-
cient, (2) contact the salt and bismuth by passing both

phases through the mild steel contactor to ensure that
chemical equilibrium was achieved between the salt and
bismuth, and (3) add a sufficient quantity of 237U
tracer to the salt while it was in the salt feed tank. The
experimental procedure that was followed in the first
six runs has been previously reported,* and was
followed in the last three runs.

In run TSMC-7, salt and bismuth flow rates were
maintained at 152 cc/min and 170 cc¢/min, respectively,
by controlled pressurization of the salt and bismuth
feed tanks. The agitator was operated at 68 rpm for this
run. At such a low agitator speed, no dispersal of salt
into the bismuth was expected. Results from this run
expand the data base for defining the effect of the
agitator speed on the mass-transfer rate in the non-
dispersed regime. The uranium distribution coefficient
was measured to be greater than 97, which is greater
than the minimum desired value of 20 which is
necessary for decreasing the sensitivity of the meas-
ured data to small errors in the distribution coefficient
for uranium.’ The run was made without incident;
however, the pre-run phase equilibration procedure
required three attempts before a successful flow-
through of the salt and bismuth was achieved. During
the first two attempts, a leak developed in the transfer
line from the bismuth feed tank to the contactor. This
transfer line was completely replaced along with the
associated heaters and thermal insulation.

Run TSMC-8 was done with salt and bismuth flow
rates of 152 cc/min and 164 cc/min respectively. The
uranium distribution coefficient was maintained at a
high level (>>40) for this run. The agitator was thought

to have been operated at 241 rpm, which is high enough
to produce mild dispersion of the phases in the
contactor and therefore result in a high measured
mass-transfer rate. However, results from this run
indicated that little (\25%) of the 237U tracer was
actually transferred from the salt to the bismuth.
Inspection of the magnetically coupled agitator drive
assembly indicated that an accumulation of a highly
viscous carbonaceous material between the upper car- -
bon bearing and the agitator drive shaft had prevented
proper rotation of the shaft. The drive asembly was
cleaned of all foreign material, reassembled, and found
to operate satisfactorily.

The ninth tracer run, TSMC-9, was performed as a
repeat of the eighth run. Salt and bismuth flow rates
were set at 169 cc/min and 164 cc/min respectively.
The agitator was operated at 244 rpm during this run. A
high stirring rate was maintained to determine the
effects of dispersal of one phase in the other on the
mass-transfer rate and to determine if large amounts of
bismuth and salt are entrained in the other phase after
passing through the small settling chamber in the
contactor effluent line. The uranium distribution coeffi-
cient was greater than 47 during this run. No operating
difficulties were encountered, and the run was per-
formed smoothly.

Operating conditions along with mass-transfer results
for runs TSMC-7, -8, and -9 are summarized in Table
10.1 along with the results from runs TSMC-2 through
-6. The salt-phase mass-transfer coefficient was calcu-
lated using three different equations derived previously
from an overall mass balance around the contactor®
based on three of the four measured concentrations of a
given material in the inlet and outlet streams. The
average measured mass-transfer coefficient is reported
(Table 10.1) along with the corresponding standard
deviation.

- The mass-transfer coefficient measured in run

TSMC-7 is 0.0057 *.0.0012 cm/sec. This value corre-
sponds to 65% of the value predicted by the Lewis
correlation.> As previously discussed in the first of
Sect. 10.2, the agitator failed to operate properly in run
TSMC-8, which explains the rather low mass-transfer
rate measured during this run, 0.0022 + 0.0010 cm/sec.
The measured mass-transfer coefficient obtained in run
TSMC-9 is 0.121 % 0.108 cm/sec, which corresponds to
178% of -the Lewis correlation. As shown by the high
value for the standard deviation, the three determina-
tions for the mass-transfer coefficient in this run differ
greatly. One possible explanation for this is that the
237 tracer balance around the contactor showed
closure to within only 50%.

A Lewis plot of the results from the six runs which
have produced meaningful results is shown (Fig. 10.3).
The nomenclature used in Fig. 10.3 is:

k = individual mass-transfer coefficient,

phase

v = kinematic viscosity, cm?/sec,
- Re = Reynolds number (¥D?/v), dimensionless,

D = stirrer diameter, cm,

N = stirrer rate, sec” !,

subscripts 1, 2 = phase being considered.

The values of the mass-transfer group based on
uranium for runs 3, 5, and 7 are between 33% and 65%
of the Lewis correlation, while the values for that same
group for runs 4, 6, and 9 are greater than 100% of the
Lewis correlation (Fig. 10.3). In all but one case, the
mass-transfer results based on zirconium are consist-
ently slightly lower than the values based on uranium.
This discrepancy is probably related to the inability to
correct for the self-absorption of the 743.37-keV §~
resulting from the decay of ®7Zr in the solid bismuth
samples. _

Results from the runs performed in the nondispersed
regime, runs TSMC-3, —5, and —7, suggest that the
dependence of the mass-transfer group on the Reynolds
number group is slightly less than that predicted by the
Lewis correlation. The exponent appears to be closer to
1.0 than to 1.65. This is consistent with the data of
Lewis, which show that for a single aqueous-organic
system the exponent on the Reynolds number group is

more nearly 1.0 than 1.65.

higher agitator speeds is a manifestation of an increase

in the surface area for mass transfer due to surface
motion. This effect is verified by the high mass-transfer
rates measured in runs 4, 6, and 9. Experiments with
water-mercury and water—methylene bromide systems
indicate also that phase dispersal occurs initially at
agitator speeds near 180 rpm.

It is possible that at high agitator rates (>>170 rpm)
some salt or bismuth is entrained in the other phase and
is carried out of the contactor. This effect is detectable
if sufficient settling time is not available between the
times when the salt and bismuth exit from the
contactor and when the flowing stream samples are
taken. Figure 104 shows the results of analysis for
beryllium in the bismuth flowing stream samples taken
in runs TSMC-5, -6, and -9, which were performed at
124, 180, and 244 rpm respectively. The concentration
of Be in bismuth samples fell within the range of 10 to
464 ppm. A concentration of 1 ppm of Be in bismuth
corresponds to 1.1 X 107 vol % salt entrained in
bismuth.

It is assumed that any beryllium present in the
bismuth is due to entrainment of salt in the bismuth
phase. Even when dispersion is suspected, there is

essentially no more beryllium, and hence no more salt,
present in the bismuth stream than when the phases are
not dispersed (Fig. 10.4). In the middle of a run there
does not appear to be an effect of agitator speed on the
amount of beryllium in the bismuth. The effect of salt
entrainment in the bismuth would be most significant
in the metal transfer process, where the presence of
fluoride ions in the lithium chloride at concentrations
above several mole percent decreases the separation
between the rare-earth elements and thorium. Thus, it
appears that the LiCl-Bi contactors can probably be
operated under conditions of mild phase dispersal.

Analyses of bismuth in the salt samples could not be
obtained. However, no gross amounts of bismuth were
indicated from the weights of the salt samples. It is
possible that the increased mass-transfer rate afforded
by mild dispersal of the salt and bismuth phases in a
stirred contactor can be taken advantage of without
imposing any detrimental effects to the reactor vessel or
adding a large burden to the bismuth removal step. A
series of runs at high agitator speeds is planned to
investigate more closely the magnitude of entrainment
effects in this type of contactor.

10.3 SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT:
EXPERIMENTS WITH A MECHANICALLY
AGITATED NONDISPERSING CONTACTOR
USING WATER AND MERCURY

C. H. Brown, Jr.

The reference flowsheet for the proposed MSBR
processing plant calls for the extraction of rare-earth

157

elements from the fluoride fuel carrier salt to an
intermediate bismuth stream. One device being consid-
ered for this extraction is a mechanically agitated
nondispersing contactor in which bismuth and fluoride
salt phases are agitated to increase the mass-transfer rate
of rare earths across the salt-bismuth interface. Previous
reports® % have indicated that the following reaction
in the water-mercury system is suitable for simulating
and studying mass transfer in the water-mercury sys-
tem, which approximates molten salt-bismuth systems:

Pb**[H, 0] + Zn[Hg] - Zn**[H, 0] + Pb[Hg]. (1)

A large amount of data has been reported® for the
water-mercury system under the assumption that the
limiting resistance to mass transfer existed entirely in
the mercury phase, as suggested by literature correla-
tions.’ : .

A series of experiments was previously described!®
which was designed to identify the phase in which the
controlling resistance to mass transfer occurs. In these
experiments it was noticed that the mass-transfer
coefficient appeared to vary during the course of the
run if the initial concentrations of zinc in the mercury
phase and Pb?* in the water phase were not equal. The
value of the mass-transfer coefficient would change
rather abruptly after the experiment ran about 12 to 18
min. During this report period the following has been
accomplished: (1) data reanalyzed from the experi-
ments which were done in the water-mercury contactor
in an attempt to determine if the apparent change in
mass-transfer coefficient was due to the controlling
resistance changing from one phase to the other during
the course of an experiment, (2) further experiments
done in the water-mercury contactor, at an elevated
temperature, to verify the assumption that the reaction
given by Eq. (1) is instantaneous, and (3) experiments
begun to determine if polarography is a workable
alternative method for determining individual water-
phase mass-transfer coefficients in the nondispersing
stirred interface contactor. '

10.3.1 Theory

As was previously reported,’® the reaction being
studied, Eq. (1), is considered to be a fast irreversible
ionic reaction which occurs entirely at the mercury-
water interface. The rate of transport of reactants from
the bulk phase to the interface where they react is given

by:

Nzpo =k A(Czy0 g —Czn0 1) (2)
NPb2+ - kHz OA(CPb2+’B _ CPb2+,i') , (3)
where

k = individual phase mass-transfer coefficient,
cm/sec,

N =rate of mass transport to the interface, g/sec,
A =interfacial area, cm?,
C = concentration, g/fcm?,
B =bulk phase,
i =interface

and Hg, H, O refer to the phase being considered. Since
one mole of Zn® is equivalent to one mole of Pb**
according to Eq. (1), Np,** = Nz ,°. Substituting Egs.
(2) and (3) into this expression yields the following
equality;

ko(Czn’ B — Czn° )

=ku,0(Cpp " 5 —Cpp ") 4

As earlier reported,'? if the controlling resistance to
mass transfer is assumed to occur in one phase, the
interfacial reactant concentration in that phase is smail
with respect to the bulk reactant concentration. In the
experiments which have been done,!® it may be
possible for the limiting resistance to mass transfer to
change from one phase to the other during the course
of an experiment. At this transition point the following
equality exists, since both interfacial reactant concen-
trations are small with respect to their bulk phase
concentrations:

k1igCzn° B = Kk1,0Cks " 8 - ()

If the controlling resistance to mass transfer is in the
aqueous phase, two equations, one in terms of meas-
ured concentrations of Pb®* and one in terms of
measured concentrations of Zn?*, can be derived:

Con 2*(¢ kg A
n{ Pb ()]=_ Hy04 6)
Cpy,2*(0) VH,0
Cpy, 2*(0) = C 2+(r)] ky. oA
ln[ Pb Zn = FH04 (7)
Cpp2*(0) J VH,0
where

V = volume of phase, cm?,
t = time, sec,

and quantities in parentheses indicate times.

- If the mercury phase contains the controlling resist-
ance to mass transfer, two other equations, one in terms
of measured concentrations of Pb?* annd one in terms
of measured concentrations of Zn?*, can be derived:

In [CZ"O(O) — Cpy,*"(0) + CPb2+(t)]
CZ n’ (07)

9)

[CZn0 (O) - C2n2+(t)}
n = -

Cz,0(0) Vhg

Equations (6), (7), (8), and (9) are all of the form

(10)

where y is the natural logarithm of a concentration
ratio, m is a mass-transfer coefficient times the inter-
facial area divided by the phase volume, and ¢ is time,
which indicates that a plot of the logarithm of the
concentration ratio vs time should yield a straight line
with the slope being proportional to the mass-transfer
coefficient. If the control of mass transfer switches
from one phase to the other during an experiment, then
the slope of the line mentioned above would change.
Equation (5) can be used with experimental values of
Kgg ku,o, and concentrations of Zn** and Pb**
evaluated at the time of apparent change of mass-
transfer coefficient and at the beginning of the experi-
ment, to determine the phase in which the limiting
mass-transfer resistance occurred at the beginning of the
run. The first step in the determination of the mass-
transfer limiting phase at the beginning of a run is to
find the pair of individual phase mass-transfer coeffi-
cients, one before and one after the transition point,

y=-—mt,
159

which satisfy Eq. (5) with the bulk reactant concentra-
tions evaluated at the transition point. Two combina-
tions of mass-transfer coefficients are possible, giving
~ Eq. (5) the following two forms:

(1) _ . (2) +

kiig Czn® = ki, 0 Cob " tr » (11)
(2) (1) +

kg Czn® =kp o Cpp e - (12)

where superscripts 1 and 2 refer to the slope in Eq. (10)
before and after the transition, respectively, and the
subscript tr refers to the transition point. Equation (6)
or (7) is used to determine k(H)O and k% )8 and Eq.
(8) or Eq. (9) is used to determine khg and ng

Once it has been determined from this test which pair
of mass-transfer coefficients is applicable to a particular
run, the mass-transfer limiting phase at the beginning of
the run may be determined by comparing the magni-
tude of the product of mass-transfer coefficient and
bulk reactant concentration at the beginning of the run.
The individual phase mass-transfer coefficient in the
limiting phase times the bulk reactant concentration in
that same phase must be less than the same product in
the nonlimiting phase. Therefore, if Eq. (11) is satisfied,
then the direction of the following inequality deter-
mines the initial mass-transfer limiting phase:

(1)

( +
kyg C2,0(0) 2 kg, 0 Cpp>7(0), (13)

and similarly if Eq. (12) is satisfied the limiting phase is

determined by the direction of the inequality

(2) (1)

kg Czn(0) Z ki, 0 Cpo(0) - (14)

10.3.2 Experimental Results

Five experiments were run in the water-mercury
contactor to determine if the apparent change in
mass-transfer coefficient was due to a shift in the
controlling resistance from one phase to the other
during the course of an experiment. The initial
mercury-phase zinc concentration was held constant at
0.1 M. Phase volumes and agitator speed were also held
constant at 1.8 liters and /150 rpm respectively.

The data obtained from these five runs were analyzed
with the equations given in the previous section. The
results of this analysis for determination of the phase in
which the limiting resistance to mass transfer occurred
at the beginning of each run are given in Table 10.2,
along with the measured value of the mass-transfer
coefficient in the limiting phase.

The results given in Table 10.2 indicate that, in the
runs made with the initial aqueous-phase lead concen-
tration equal to or less than the initial mercury-phase
zinc concentration, the limiting resistance to mass
transfer was initially in the mercury phase. For the runs
made with an initial lead ion concentration greater than
the initial zinc amalgam concentration the aqueous
phase controls mass transfer. The results from run 148,
in which the initial reactant concentrations are nearly
equal, are difficult to analyze because only a slight
change of slope in a plot of Eq. (10) was detected.

In runs 145 and 149, the initial lead ion concentra-
tion was low with respect to the zinc amalgam
concentration. This would indicate that the aqueous
phase should initially contain the limiting resistance
since the initial lead ion concentration times the
mass-transfer coefficient should be less than the initial
zinc amalgam concentration times the mass-transfer
coefficient in that phase. Similarly, in runs 146 and 147

coefficients in the phase initially containing the

147 0.184 0.0046

the initial lead ion concentration was large with respect
to the zinc amalgam concentration, which would
indicate that the mercury phase should initially contain
the limiting resistance to mass transfer.

According to the model developed, if the aqueous
phase initially contains the limiting resistance to mass
transfer the following inequality is satisfied:

khg Czn0 () >ky, o Cpp2(0). (15)
During an experimental run, the inequality given by Eq.
(15) should always be satisfied, since the lead ion
concentration decreases, with an equal decrease in the
zinc amalgam concentration. This indicates that the
aqueous -phase should control mass transfer throughout
the run with no change of slope, corresponding to a
change in the controlling phase, in a plot of Eq. (6).
The parameters of Eq. (6) are plotted for the data
obtained in run 146 (Fig. 10.5). A definite change of
slope is recognizable at a value of the abscissa (time)
between 15 and 18 min, which would indicate a change
in the phase containing the limiting resistance to mass
transfer.

The value of the individual phase mass-transfer
coefficient should be the same for all runs since the
agitator speed was not varied. However, the experi-
mental results indicate that the measured mass-transfer
coefficient for the mercury phase in runs 145, 148, and
149 increased in direct proportion to the initial lead ion
concentration (Table 10.2). Similarly the values

reported for the aqueous phase mass-transfer coefficient
in runs 146 and 147 vary inversely with the initial lead
ion concentration.

Several runs were made in which the temperature of
the contactor and reactants was raised to approximately
40°C. The results from these runs are inconclusive

because it was found that at this elevated temperature,

hydrochloric acid, which was present in the aqueous
phase to prevent oxide formation at the mercury
surface, reacted with zinc to form zinc chloride. This
makes the mass-transfer analysis more difficult by
introducing a competing reaction. Also, depletion of
the acid caused formation of a spongy lead compound
on the agitator blades and at the water-mercury
interface.

From the results presented here it is clear that
sufficient uncertainty exists in this method of deter-
mining mass-transfer coefficients in water-mercury
systems that another method should be developed. The
next section discusses initial attempts to develop such a
method.

10.3.3 Polarographic Determination of
Mass-Transfer Coefficients

Polarography has been suggested as an alternate
method for determining the water phase mass-transfer
coefficient in the water-mercury contactor. The neces-
sary experimental equipment has been assembled, and
preliminary tests have been made to determine a
suitable redox couple and an electrolyte which will

~ produce the desired polarization curves while being

chemically inert to mercury.

10.3.3.1 Theory. The polarographic technique for
determining mass-transfer coefficients involves oxida-
tion of a reduced species or reduction of an oxidized
species at an electrode which is at a condition of
concentration polarization. One system which has been
previously studied'' is the reduction of ferricyanide
ions at a polarized nickel electrode. As ferricyanide was
reduced at the cathode, ferrocyanide was oxidized at
the anode. There was no net consumption of chemicals
or change in the composition of the electrolyte solu-
tion. Polarization of the cathode can be accomplished
in one of two ways: either the cathode surface area is
made very large with respect to the anode surface area,
or the concentration of the oxidized species is made
very small with respect to the reduced species.

moters for Increasing Mass Transfer Rates in Aqueous Chemical
Flow,” Ph.D. Thesis, University of Tennessee (1967).
The migration of an ion in both electric and concen-
tration fields is described by the Nernst-Planck

equation:

0=pvc+ZL vy, (16)
RT

where

C = concentration of reacting ion, moles/liter,
Q = flux of the ion, moles cm 2 sec ™!,
D = diffusion coefficient, cm? [sec,

Z ='valence,

R = gas constant,

T = absolute temperature, °K,

F= Faraday’s constant, C/inole,

¢ = electric potential, V.

The first term in the expression represents the contribu-
tion of ordinary diffusion to the flux, and the second

161

term represents. the contribution of electromigration. A -

large concentration (relative to that of the reacting ion)
of an inert electrolyte alters the dielectric properties of
the solution so that the potential will decrease
smoothly across the region between the electrodes
while the concentration drops sharply across the thin
polarized layer near the cathode. Thus, the term

containing the electric potential becomes relatively
small and
g=DvC. (17)

X,Y PLOTTER

Then the current flowing between the electrodes is a
measure of mass-transfer rates governed by ordinary
molecular diffusion. This current is sometimes called
the diffusion current.

The impressed current is proportional to the mass
flux across the stagnant layer between the bulk electro-
lyte and the polarized cathode, and the mass-transfer
coefficient is given by:

k=_1__ (18)
ZAFCp
where
k =mass-transfer coefficient through the film,

cm/sec,
I = polarization current, A,
A = area of the polarized electrode, cm?,

Cg = concentration in g-moles/cm® of transferring
species in the bulk liquid.

Thus, it is possible to determine mass-transfer rates
from the bulk electrolyte to the electrode surface using
experimentally determined values for I, Cg, and 4.

10.3.3.2 Experimental equipment. The experimental
apparatus which will measure mass-transfer rates in the
water-mercury stirred contactor is shown schematically
in Fig. 10.6. The equipment consists of a 5 X 7 in.
Plexiglas contactor which was used in previous work
with the water-mercury system. The mercury surface in
the contactor acts as the cathode in the electrochemical
cell. The cathode is electrically connected to the
remainder of the circuit by a Y%-in.diam stainless steel

phase by a Teflon sheath. The anode of the cell is
suspended in the aqueous electrolyte phase and consists
of a Y-in.-thick piece of nickel sheet which is formed
to fit the inner perimeter of the Plexiglas cell. The
current through the cell is inferred from the voltage
drop across a 0.1 £ 0.0005 £, 10-W precision resistor.
The voltage drop across the resistor is recorded as the y
coordinate on a Hewlett-Packard x, y plotter. The x
coordinate on the plotter is produced by the direct
current voltage supplied to the cell from a 0—-10 V,
0—10 A Hewlett-Packard dc power supply.

10.3.3.3 Experimental results. Several different elec-
trolyte solutions have been evaluated subject to two
different criteria: the electrolyte must be chemically
inert to mercury, and it must be possible to polarize the
mercury surface with the given electrolyte. The differ-
ent electrolytes that have been examined are (1)
potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide with
a sodium hydroxide supporting electrolyte, (2) potas-
sium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide with a
sodium chloride supporting electrolyte, (3) potassium
ferro- and ferricyanides with a sodium nitrate support-
ing electrolyte, (4) ferrous and ferric sulfate with a
sodium hydroxide supporting electrolyte, and (5) fer-
rous and ferric sulfate with sulfuric acid as the
supporting electrolyte.

None of the electrolytes mentioned above met both
of the required criteria. The ferrous and ferric sulfate
system with sulfuric acid as the supporting electrolyte
was the only combination which proved to be chemi-
cally inert to the mercury cathode. However, it was
found, that the ferric ions reacted with the mercury
cathode at a voltage less than that required to polarize
the mercury cathode. This phenomenon has been
previously discussed in the literature by Kolthoff and
Lingane,'? who reported that the following reaction
occurs when ferric ions are contacted with mercury:

2Fe* + 2Hg = 2Fe** + Hg, ** (19)

making the half-wave potential of ferric ions not
directly measurable.

The reversible oxidation and reduction of ferrous and
ferric ions have been reported’ to be feasible when the
iron ions are complexed with excess oxalate ions. This
system will be examined in detail for potential applica-
tion to the experiment under development.

10.4 CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT
- R.B. Lindauer

The investigation is continuing into autoresistence
heating as a heat source for the nonradioactive demon-
stration of frozen-salt corrosion protection in a contin-
uous fluorinator. Successful operation in a simple
vertical test vessel using 66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,
(AHT-2) has been reported.!® A fluorinator mockup
(AHT-3) that was designed to test an electrode in a side
arm out of the fluorine path has been previously
described.'®>'5 Initial test runs in this equipment using
MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF,-ThF,; (72-16-12 mole %),
have also been reported.’®:'® Additional runs were
made with this equipment as designed but with little
success. Subsequently several apparently successful runs
were made with fuel salt but with the electrode in the
vertical section instead of in the side arm.

A circulating salt system is being installed to complete
the frozen wall formation tests planned before tests are
started using fluorine. This test (AHT-4) uses the same
test vessel as AHT-3 but with an argon gas lift to
circulate the salt. The salt will be introduced through
the electrode in the side arm. Probably, the circulating
salt will reduce wall-temperature differences throughout
the test vessel during the formation of the frozen salt
film, thus maintaining a molten core until a continuous
electrically insulating film has been formed on the
vessel wall. ‘

10.4.1 Autoresistance Heating Test AHT-3

As previously reported,'® this equipment was built
and five unsuccessful runs were attempted before the
MSR Program was terminated in the spring of 1973.
Four more runs were also attempted in the previous
report period, ending with the melting off of the lower
6 in. of the %-in. Inconel electrode. Therefore the
initial work in this period was concerned with draining

the electrode side arm and recovering the melted
portion of the electrode. A drain line was installed
between the bottom of the side arm and the vertical
section of the test vessel, and the side arm was drained.
A new electrode was fabricated of 3¥-in. sched 40
nickel pipe with a 5-in.-long section pointing up the
slanting section of the side arm. This is the configura-
tion planned for the circulating system of AHT-4 to
avoid impingement of the molten salt directly on the
frozen wall. The other modification made at this time
consisted of the installation of %-in. stainless steel
cooling coils on the test section. Air, with a small
amount of water to increase the heat capacity, was used
as a coolant. This eliminated the need to remove (or
loosen) the insulation during each test and reduced the
cooling time.

Seven runs were made with the side arm electrode,
but a uniform, nonconducting salt film could not be
formed before complete freezing of the salt occurred.
During the most successful of these runs, AHT3-15, an
autoresistance power of 1130 W was reached. The
resistance between electrodes was 1.3 £2. However, a
short occurred, and the power could not be increased to
that required to balance the heat loss.

To demonstrate that stable operation could be main-
tained with the 72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF, salt,
an electrode was installed in the top of the vertical
section of the test section, and the salt in the electrode
side arm was frozen. This shortened the length of the
test section from 44 to 24 in. and eliminated the side
arm junction from the current path. Reasonably steady

conditions were maintained but with a much lower

resistance than anticipated. The resistance across the
2-ft test section was ~0.1 £, indicating that the
resistivity of the salt was about one-third of the 0.75
Q-cm value stated in the literature.! 7 Salt from the test
vessel could not be transferred with a frozen wall
present in the test section to verify the thickness of the
salt film. It can be inferred that the resistivity was
probably between 0.1 and 0.2 Q-cm (Fig. 10.7). An
average film thickness of % in. is probably necessary to
prevent shorting, since the film is not normally uni-
form. This implies a resistivity of 0.2 {2-cm or greater to

account for the resistance (0.1 £2) measured in run 21.

Similarly, if the resistivity were less than 0.1 Q2-cm, the
average film thickness in run 15 would have been 2%
in. or greater, and current blockage by freezing would
probably have occurred at some point.

10.4.2 Design of Equipment for Autoresistance
Heating Test AHT4

Thé next equipment to be used in the development of
the frozen-wall fluorinator consists of a circulating salt
system using autoresistance heating. The flow diagram

tor by means of an argon gas lift. The salt then flows by
gravity to the test vessel via a special insulated flange
and the electrode. The salt leaves the bottom of the test
vessel and passes through a heat flowmeter before being
returned to the surge tank through another insulated

164

flange. The insulated flanges are water-cooled to permit
the use of Teflon gaskets. The bolts are insulated by a
Bakelite sleeve and Teflon washers (Fig. 109). A
deflector is located in the return line at the point where
it enters the surge tank to prevent short-circuiting
across the liquid stream (Fig. 10.10). The surge tank

and separator are therefore at the same electrical
potential as the electrode and must be insulated from
the equipment supports. Gas lines to these two vessels
have insulated sections. An air-cooled freeze valve is
located in the line between the separator and the test
vessel to make it possible to pressurize the test vessel
and transfer the molten salt from the test vessel to the
surge tank after a run to determine the thickness of the
frozen salt layer. The individual equipment pieces are
described next.

10.4.2.1 Test vessel. The test vessel is the same one
used in AHT-3. Inspection of the vessel-after draining
salt from the last run revealed about 11 liters of
material which failed to drain. This was due partly to
runback but mainly to plugging of the side arm drain
line with impurities (oxides and structural metal fluo-
rides) accumulated over the past two years of opera-
tion. The bottom 6% in. of the vessel was filled with
salt and was cut off. Another cut was made below the
electrode side arm to allow submergence of the vessel in
an open vat; there it was contacted with a hot
("“200°F) 6% oxalic acid solution for seven days and
hot ammonium oxalate for two days. The solution was
changed two times during the cleaning operation.
Cleaning was complicated by the salt remaining in the
electrode side arm, which prevented removal of the
electrode and flange. This prevented circulation of the
oxalic acid through the side arm. After the electrode
was broken loose, the residual salt was broken up
manually, and decontamination was completed. New
heaters and cooling coils have been installed on the test
vessel for better control of temperature. The electrode
(Fig. 10.11) is similar to that used in AHT-3 but has an
open-end pipe for salt flow.

10.4.2.2 Fluoride salt surge tank (Figs. 10.12 and
10.13). This is a dual-diameter vessel having a lower
section of 6-in. sched 40 nickel pipe 46 in.long and an
upper section of “-in.-thick nickel 24 in. in diameter
by 11 in. high. The long 6-in.-diam section provides
ample submergence for the gas lift, while the large-
diameter upper section provides sufficient capacity to
contain the salt from the entire system. A sensitive
(0.20 in. of water) liquid-level instrument in the
large-diameter section will indicate any unusual buildup
of salt at the top of the test vessel or separator as well
as measuring the volume of the frozen salt film after a
test run.

104.2.3 Gas-iquid separator. This is an 8-in.-diam,
12-in.-high cone-bottom nickel vessel containing an
8-in.-deep layer of Yorkmesh nickel demister. Two
baffle plates are located below the Yorkmesh for
separation of the bulk of the salt from the argon-salt

165

mixture from the gas lift. A differential pressure
instrument will detect any liquid buildup in the bottom
or any excessive pressure drop across the separator. A
thermowell that is located in the Yorkmesh will be
maintained above the melting point of the salt.

10.4.2.4 Heat flowmeter (Fig. 10.14). The salt leaving
the test vessel passes through a 28-in.-long section of
2-in. nickel pipe containing a cartridge heater. Heat loss
from the flowmeter will be balanced by external
heaters. The internal heater can be operated on either
120 V (750 W) or 240 V (3000 W) depending on the
salt flow rate. A temperature rise of about 10°C
through the flowmeter will indicate a salt flow rate of
either 0.9 or 3.6 liters/min depending on the voltage.

10.5 FUEL RECONSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT:
INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT FOR A FUEL
RECONSTITUTION ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT

R. M. Counce

The reference flowsheet for processing the fuel salt
from a molten-salt breeder reactor is based upon
removal of uranium by fluorination to UF4 as the first
processing step.'® The uranium removed in this step
must subsequently be returned to the fuel salt stream
before it returns to the reactor. The method for
recombining the uranium with the fuel carrier salt
(reconstituting the fuel salt) consists of absorbing
gaseous UF¢ into a recycled fuel salt stream containing
dissolved UF, by using the reaction:

UFs(g) + UF4(d) = 2UF(d). (20)
The resultant UFs; would be reduced to UF, with
hydrogen in a separate vessel according to the reaction:

2UFs5(d) + Ha(g) = 2UF4(d) + 2HF(g). 21

Engineering studies of the fuel reconstitution step
have been started to provide the technology necessary
for the design of larger equipment for recombining UF,
generated in fluorinators in the processing plant with

~ the processed fuel salt returning to the reactor. During

this report period, equipment previously described was
fabricated and is being installed in the high-bay area of
Building 7503. This report describes the details of the
experimental equipment.

Factors important in carrying out reactions (20) and
(21) will be studied in experimental process equipment
described later in this report. The parameters that are
expected to be of interest are gas flow rates, liquid flow
rates, and reaction temperature. Results will be deter-
mined by analyzing the efficiency of UF absorption
for reaction (20) and hydrogen utilization for reaction
(21) under various operating conditions. These quanti-
ties will be determined by component mass balances
around the respective reaction vessels. The major
components of the equipment for this experiment are a
UF, absorption vessel, a H, reduction column, feed
and receiver tanks, feed tank and effluent stream

samplers, transfer lines and freeze valves, packed-bed
traps of NaF pellets for collecting excess UF¢ and for
disposing of HF, gas supplies for UF, argon, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, and instrumentation and controls (Fig
10.15).

The experiment will be operated by pressurizing the
feed tank with argon at a controlled rate to displace salt
from the feed tank to the UFg absorption vessel at rates
from 50 to 300 ¢cm®/min. From the UF¢ absorption
vessel, the salt will be siphoned into the H, reduction
column. From the H, reduction column, the salt will
flow by gravity through the effluent stream sampler to
the salt receiver. The feed salt will be LiF-BeF,-ThF,

(72-16-12 mole %) MSBR fuel carrier salt containing up
to 0.3 mole % UF4. Absorption of UF, by reaction
with dissolved UF4 will occur in the UF, absorption
vessel, and the resultant UFs will be reduced with
hydrogen in the H, reduction column. UF, flow rates
from 60 to 360 std cm® /min and H, flow rates from 60
to 720 std em?®/min will be used. The effluent salt will
be collected in the receiver for return to the feed tank
at the end of the run. The off-gas streams from the
absorption vessel and the reduction column will be
analyzed for UF and for HF respectively. The salt in
the feed tank will be analyzed, and samples of the
effluent salt from the column will be analyzed for
uranium. The performance of the column will be
evaluated from these analyses. The effluent HF and
UFg passing through the column will be collected on
the NaF traps before the gas is exhausted to the
building off-gas system.

In the initial series of experiments all components
contacting molten salt will be made of nickel; however,
later series may involve the use of gold-lined vessels and

171

lines for all equipment that contacts molten salt
containing dissolved UF;.

The UFg absorption vessel (Fig. 10.16) is constructed
of 4-in. sched 40 pipe with an inside height of 11 in.
The vessel is mounted vertically with a 150-Ib rated,
standard Monel flange at the top and a 0.25-in.-thick
bottom plate. The top of the vessel has four nozzles.
The hydrogen reduction column (Fig. 10.17) is con-
structed of 1%-in. sched 40 pipe mounted vertically
with a 150-Ib Monel flange on the upper end and a
sched 40 welded cap on the lower end. The column is
115 in. long. The top of the column has two nozzles.
Gas enters through a %-in. sched 40 side arm at the
bottom. A photograph of the feed tank is shown in Fig.
10.18. The feed and receiver tanks are identical in
construction, except that the feed tank has an addi-
tional nozzle. Both tanks have 0.25-in.-thick walls and
Ys-in. top and bottom plates. The vessels have inside
diameters of 10 in. and inside heights of 33 in. Both the
feed tank and the salt effluent portion of the hydrogen
reduction column are provided with sample ports.

These ports are made from %-in. sched 40 pipe fitted
with a ball valve through which the liquid phase may be
sampled.

The direction of salt flow through the facility is
controlled by two freeze valves in the transfer lines.
These are located in the transfer line extending from
the feed tank to the UFg4 absorption vessel and in a

transfer line running from the receiver tank to the feed
" tank. These freeze valves are small vertically mounted
cylindrical vessels fabricated from 1%-in. sched 40 pipe
4 in. in length with % ¢-in. top- and bottom- welded
plates. The salt inlet line extends through the top plate
to within % in. of the bottom, while the overflow line
extends through the bottom to within % in. of the top
plate. To prevent flow through a freeze valve, the
heating circuit to the valve is turned off, allowing the
salt to freeze.

The experimental facility, which is of welded con-
struction, contains approximately 30 ft of salt transfer
lines (%- and '%-in. pressure tubing). The UF¢ and HF
traps are identical in construction except for their
lengths. They are fabricated from 4-in. sched 40 Monel
pipe and are vertically mounted with 150-b standard
flanges on both ends for charging and removing NaF
pellets. The UF, trap (Fig. 10.19) is 55% in. long,
while the HF trap is 31 % in. long. Each trap has a
%-in. fitting on the top and bottom for the gas inlet
and outlet. A 6-in. section in the lower end of each trap
contains 4-in.-diam nickel Yorkmesh to keep pellets
from plugging the exit.

The uranium hexafluoride for the fuel reconstitution
engineering experiment comes in 5-in.-diam-by-36-in.-
high cylinders. These cylinders contain up to 55 1b of
UF¢. The UF¢ will be supplied to the experiment as gas
by maintaining the UF¢ cylinder at 220°F, where the
vapor pressure will be 70 psia. This heating will be done
with 17.2-psia steam. The steam heats the cylinders
directly through %-in. copper tubing, which is coiled
around the entire cylinder. The lower 18 in. of the
cylinder and tubing are plastered with a conductive
material to minimize thermal response time. The
cylinder and associated valves are then enclosed in a
cabinet that is insulated with 2 in. of fiberglass
insulation.

Purified argon will be used for all applications
requiring an inert gas: pressurization of tanks for
transferring salt, dip-leg bubblers for liquid-level mea-
surements, purging of equipment and lines, etc.
Cylinder argon is passed through a bed of uranium
metal turnings, where water and oxygen are removed.
This bed operates at 600°C. Cylinder hydrogen is
purified sufficiently by passing it through a Deoxo unit,

174

where oxygen is converted to water. No further
purification of the nitrogen is needed, since it is
sufficiently pure for calibrating the gas-density cells.

'The flow rate of salt to the UF, absorption tank is
controlled by regulating the change of liquid level in the
feed tank. This liquid level is inferred from the pressure
of argon that is supplied to a dip-leg bubbler in the
tank. An adjustable ramp generator and an electric-to-
pneumatic converter are used to linearly decrease the
set point of a controller that senses liquid level in the
feed tank and controls the level by controlling the flow
rate of pressurizing argon to the gas space of the feed
tank. The result should be a uniformly decreasing salt
level and, hence, a uniform discharge rate of salt from
the tank. This control system should be unaffected by
small increases in back pressure caused by plugging of
transfer lines, decreasing feed tank level, etc., or leakage
of pressurizing argon (a small argon bleed is provided to
improve pressure control).

The equipment for the fuel reconstitution engineering
experiment is being installed in Building 7503 and will
be ready by early April 1975.

10.6 MASS-TRANSFER RATES IN
OPEN BUBBLE COLUMNS

J. M. Begovich  J. S. Watson

Measurement of mass-transfer rates in open bubble
columns continued during this report period? ®-*® using
CO, absorption in aqueous solutions. Results were
extended to include the effects of liquid viscosity as
well as the effects of liquid and gas flow rates on
mass-transfer rates. In addition, further improvements
were made in the experimental technique, and all
previous data were critically reevaluated. The new data
were combined with the most reliable data from our
earlier work to produce correlations for estimating the
effects of gas velocity, liquid viscosity, and column
diameter on liquid-film mass-transfer coefficients. This
work in support of MSR fuel processing was done in the
Chemical Engineering Research Program supported by
ERDA Division of Physical Research.

10.6.1 Experimental

The equipment used in these studies has been
described previously,?! but several refinements were
made in the experimental technique. The experimental
apparatus is shown in Fig. 10.20. The liquid phase was
pumped from a 55-gal stainless steel feed tank through
a rotameter to the top of either the 1.5- or 3-in.-ID
Plexiglas column. Carbon dioxide and air passed sepa-
rately through rotameters and were mixed in a surge
tank. The gas stream then entered the bottom of the
column and countercurrently contacted the liquid. The
exiting gas stream was vented to the atmosphere, while
the exiting liquid stream was passed through a 6-ft-high,
6-in.-ID Plexiglas stripping column and then returned to
the feed tank. The stripper column was operated using a
high air flow rate and removed the carbon dioxide from
the liquid.

Section Semiannual Progress Report, March 1, 1974 to August
31, 1974, ORNL-TM-4777 (in preparation).

A manometer attached just below the column meas-
ured the gas pressure at the rotameters. There were no
valves or other restrictions between this point and the
gas rotameters, and hence no large pressure drops. For
slug flow, the gas valve just beneath the column was
completely open, so the manometer pressure was
essentially the pressure at the bottom of the column.
For slug flow, the stripper and absorption columns were
operated simultaneously because liquid flow rates were
high. Samples were taken every 15 min from the feed
tank. If no change in carbon dioxide concentration
occurred between consecutive samplings, the system
was assumed to be at steady state. Samples of liquid
were also taken from the bottom of the column every
15 min. If two consecutive samplings showed no
difference in carbon dioxide concentration, this again
indicated that the system was at steady state. The time
to attain steady-state conditions was a minimum of 45
min.

The experimental equilibrium measurements (Henry’s
law constant, m eXp) were made after each run in which
a new gas flow rate had been used. The liquid flow was

stopped, and the liquid in the column was allowed to
equilibrate with the gas stream. Liquid samples were
collected at the 50-cm port every 15 min until
equilibrium was established. Comparison of measured
Henry’s law constants with literature values®? proved
to be a useful way to check the reliability of earlier
data.

Accurate determination of the carbon dioxide con-
centration in aqueous samples required considerable
care in sampling, in handling samples, and in titration.
Three steps were followed carefully to ensure accuracy:

1. Initially 10 ml of 0.01 & NaOH was emptied into a
sample bottle. A steady flow of argon into the sample
bottle was applied to create an inert argon blanket
above the NaOH. This prevented NaOH absorption of
CO, from air. The sample bottle was then covered with
a ground-glass cap until the column sample to be tested
was prepared.

2. Samples were taken from the tank and column in
the following manner: (2) 10-ml samples from the tank
were obtained by filling a 10-ml pipet with liquid twice:
first to rinse the pipet and then to remove the sample.
Care was taken so that no gas bubbles would be drawn
into the pipet. () Samples from the bottom of the
column were obtained from the bleed tube located on
the jackleg running between the column and the
stripper holding tank. Approximately 25 ml of solution
was allowed to flow through the pipet before the
sample was collected. No gas bubbles were allowed to
be entrapped in the sample. (¢) Equilibrium samples
were taken from a side port in the same manner
described in step 2b. .

After the 10-ml sample was collected, it was drained
into the sample bottle already containing NaOH. The
sampling pipet had been adapted with a No. 10 rubber
stopper to provide a snug fit with the sampling bottle,
so that air and additional CO, could be kept out of the
sample bottle. Also, the tip of the pipet was below the
surface of the NaOH to prevent the argon from
stripping CO, from the sample solution.

3. The resulting 20 ml of solution (10 ml of NaOH
and 10 ml of column sample) was then titrated with
0.01 & HCI to an end point of 8.3 (as recommended by
the American Society for Testing and Materials)*?
using a Radiometer Copenhagen automatic titrator.
During titrations, samples were again kept under an
argon atmosphere. '

A stoichiometric coefficient based on the weighted
equilibrium fraction of H,CO5;, HCO;~, and CO5%~
species present at pH 8.3 is needed to determine the
actual total CO, in all samples. Equivalents of base can
neutralize CO, in one of two ways:

H, CO5 + NaOH Z (HCO; )(Na") + H, O, (22)

NaHCO; + NaOH ” Na, CO; + H,0. (23)
If the reaction stops after the first step, one equivalent
of base per mole of CO, is required. But if it continues
as in step (2), two equivalents of base per mole of CO,
are required. The stoichiometric coefficient needed to
calculate the true CO, concentration at a final pH of
8.3 can be calculated:

X (fraction of CO, as un-ionized H,CO;). (24)

The fractions of total CO, present as CO32 ~, HCO;",
and H, CO; at pH 8.3 (ref.’5) were found to be 0.0090,
0.9795, and 0.115 respectively. The K value was
calculated as

stoic

=2 X 0.0090 +0.9795 X 1+0 X 0.0115
=0.9975. (25)

Thus, at pH 8.3, essentially all the CO, exists as
bicarbonate, which is desirable for limiting absorption
or desorption of carbon dioxide. Using the stoichio-
metric coefficient and the titration data, the concentra-
tion of CO, is determined by:

C, =WpVp —N,4VIVK (26)

of solution,
178

N =normality, equivalents per liter of solution,

B = base,
S = sample.

Carbon dioxide concentrations determined using this
technique yielded results that agreed to within 4% with
those obtained using a Beckman infrared analyzer.
However, the titration technique was considered more
accurate, since results were more difficult to reproduce
with the Beckman analyzer.

10.6.2 Effect of Liquid Velocity on K;al;

Both dispersion and mass-transfer coefficients in open
bubble columns appear to be determined principally by
the gas flow rate; the liquid flow rate has a much
smaller effect. With earlier data, the significance of the
effects of the liquid flow rate could not be determined.
New data show the effect of liquid flow rate, U, on
the number of transfer units, NTU, in the slugging
regime (Fig. 10.21). Each data point shown represents
an average of three or more runs, with data taken at
different heights to eliminate end effects. The data
shown were obtained in the 1.5-in.-ID column with the
same gas rate, Ug, but with three different liquid flow
rates. The mass-transfer coefficient can be obtained
from each curve using the relation:

d(NTU)
dH

K;al5=U; (27)

Figure 10.22 shows the mass-transfer coefficient for the
three liquid velocities tested. Note that in the slug
region there was no significant effect of liquid velocity
onK;alz.

10.6.3 Effect of Viscosity on K; a] 5

Figure 10.23 shows the effect of viscosity on K;a] 3.

Different aqueous glycerol solutions with liquid viscosi-
ties of 0.96, 4.4, and 9.3 cP were used. The data were
taken in both the 1.5- and 3-in.-ID columns with a
single set of flow rates (Ug = 4.5 and U = 6.7 cm/sec).
Again, each data point shown in Fig. 10.23 represents
the slope of one or more curves such as those shown in
Fig. 10.21 and includes several experimental measure-
ments. The mass-transfer coefficient in the 1.5-in.-ID
column decreased approximately as the square root of

the liquid viscosity. At viscosities of 0.96 and 4.4 ¢cP,
there appeared to be little difference between results
from the two columns. However, at 9.3 ¢P, the
mass-transfer coefficient for the 3-in.-ID column fell
significantly below that for the 1.5-in.-ID column.

10.6 .4 Analysis of Previous Data

An extensive analysis was made of all previous data,
and several sources of experimental error were
uncovered:

1. Even small errors in titration volumes caused large
changes in NTU values calculated by the computer
code.

2. Large deviations of the experimentally determined
Henry’s law constant from the literature value
created uncertainty in the resulting NTU values.
These could have resulted from error either in the
titrations or rotameter settings (i.e., gas composi-
tions).

3. At large values of F or small X values, the error
associated with computing NTU was large (Fig.
10.24). Some earlier data were not taken near an
optimum value for F.

4. Some previous measurements did not allow suffi-
cient time to reach steady state. The time required
to attain steady state in both the column and the
feed tank was greater than 45 min.

To select data for correlation, criteria were developed
for discarding or retaining data points from previous
investigations.!®+2%:24~26 These criteria were as fol-
lows:

1. Proper £ and X values were used, and NTU did not
exceed 3. This ensured that the run was carried out
at a point where the Miyauchi-Vermeulen®*? com-
putational technique was less sensitive to experi-
mental error.

2. Experimentally determined Henry’s law constants,
Mexps Were consistent with other runs in the same
investigation or with literature values. Where Mexp
diverged significantly (more than 30%) from pre-
ceding and succeeding runs or from the available
literature value, the point was rejected.

3. Scatter in titration data was not excessive. Usually,
the range for titration of our earlier studies was not
larger than 0.25 ml; however, scatter larger than this
led to rejection of the data.

4. There was a minimum of four points on the NTU vs
H plot (such as Fig. 10.21).

5. Sufficient time was allowed to attain steady state.
Experience showed that the necessary time was
approximately 45 min; hence, whenever past data
indicated that less than 30 min was allowed to reach
steady state, the point was discarded.

6. The scatter of the NTU vs H plot was not excessive.
A regression coefficient (concerning the least-squares
linear fit, NTU = aH + b) of less than 0.9 was
indicative of scatter. Table 10.3 lists all data sets
retained.

10.6.5 Correlation of Column Parameters

The volumetric mass-transfer coefficient, K a] 3, cor-
rected for end effects and dispersion, was correlated
with superficial gas velocity, liquid viscosity, and
column diameter. Additional correlations were made
using dimensionless parameters. K;a]y, expressed in
terms of a modified Sherwood number, was correlated
with Reynolds number, Schmidt number, Suratman

To facilitate the correlations, a computer code was
written to calculate the dimensionless groups and to
interface with an IBM Scientific Subroutine Package for
multiple linear regression. The criteria for evaluating the
quality of each correlation were

I. the multiple correlation coefficient, which repre-
sents the fraction of the total variance explained by
the regression coefficients, |

. the 1 statistic for each independent variable, which
indicates each independent variable’s relative value
in the correlation, and

. the F statistic, which is indicative of the overall
degree of confidence in the correlation.

Only regressions with a correlation coefficient greater
than 0.9 were considered. Correlation with the column
diameter in any combination was low in power depend-
ence (absolute value less than 0.2) and of low signifi-
cance. Although this is in disagreement with earlier
findings,”® only five sets of data in the larger diameter
column were used in the correlations. The best correla-
tion in terms of both correlation coefficient and F
statistic was:

Kpalg (28)
= 0.00490 U&;O.843 +0.124 My 0.517£0.120

with the 90% confidence intervals of the exponent.
Figure 10.25 shows the correlation and all of the
reliable data.

Correlation of the modified Sherwood number with
Reynolds, Schmidt, and Suratman numbers also yielded
high correlation coefficients and F statistics. Their
correlation was:

Figure 10.26 presents a plot of Eq. (29) for all the
reliable data. Equation (29) was chosen over those
involving the Archimedes number for three reasons:

1. Equation (29) was statistically better.

2. The Suratman number is more applicable to slug
flow, as evidenced by the fact that Peclet number
has been correlated with Suratman number in the
slug regime and with Archimedes number in the
bubble regime and most of the points corresponded
to siug flow.?®

3. The Suratman number introduces a new variable,
oy . Although o; does not vary greatly throughout
the study, the correlation indicates that ¢; is a
significant variable. Future studies which investigate
varying surface tension will check this point.

10.6.6 Conclusions

1. The titration technique used was shown to be both
accurate and precise.

2. In the slug-flow regime, liquid-flow rate has a
negligible effect on liquid-film mass-transfer coeffi-
cients, K a] -

10.7 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF MSBR FUEL
PROCESSING ENGINEERING CENTER

J. R. Hightower, Jr.

A conceptual design is being prepared for a $12
million MSBR Fuel Processing Engineering Center. The
building will provide space for the engineering develop-
ment of fuel processing technology.

A floor plan for the Fuel Processing Engineering
Center (FPEC) building has been developed, reviewed,
and accepted. The three-story building will contain

office space for about 40 people, a high bay area for
large experiments, laboratories, equipment storage
areas, change facilities, a lunch room, and a conference
room. The building will be approximately 150 ft wide
X 175 ft long X 50 ft high, with a high bay area which
will be 81 ft wide X 128 ft long X 45 ft high.

The high bay and laboratories will be suitably
ventilated to house beryllium and thorium fluorides.
Space has been provided for a facility to prepare and

183

purify molten salt mixtures needed in the MSBR
program.

The design discipline effort necessary to complete the
FPEC conceptual design has been started. The Engineer-
ing Job Plan which has been developed calls for a
preliminary schedule 44 construction project data sheet
to be submitted by April 15; a final schedule 44 to be
submitted by June 30; and the conceptual design report
to be issued and approved by September.
Part 5. Salt Production

11. Production of Fluoride Salt Mixtures for Research and Development

A salt production facility is operated for preparation
of salt mixtures required by experimenters in the MSR
Program. The composition -of the mixtures and the
packaging for delivery are controlled to maintain
purity.

Major -objectives during this reporting period were
continued production of salt in the small-scale research
facility, and completion and start-up of the larger-scale
production facility. The first objective was attained
without major delay to the program, and the second
was very close to schedule with loading of the first
batch of salt started on February 28, 1975.

Activities during the report period fall in three
categories: (1) salt production, (2) facility and equip-
ment modification, and (3). peripheral activities that
include preparation of salt-transfer vessels, assistance to
“others in equipment- clean-up, and reactivation of
liquid-waste handling facilities and procedures.

- Salt was produced -continuously during this period
“except for interruptions for analyses and for transfers
into other vessels. Total production of salt was 358 kg
_in three different compositions. This material was
delivered in 22 different containers, requiring a total of

.30 salt transfers. In all cases the vessels used were

pretreated with hydrogen at temperatures >650°C to
" reduce metallic oxides.

Most of- the salt (350 kg) was produced in the
.8-in.-diam reactor. ‘Ten batches (35-kg each) were
. processed for 18 hr each with HF-H, and for 30 hr with

Hy al(_)ﬁ'e (average times). The average HF content of
the offgas was reduced from 045 meg per liter of
~ off-gas at 1 hr of H, stripping to 0.02 meg per liter of
" off-gas at 30 hr. At this point, the reduction rate was
changing so slowly that the processing was terminated.
These values are based on titration of HF in the off-gas
stream with KOH using phenolphthalein indicator. The
- gas volume which has been stripped of HF is deter-
~mined by passing the gas through a displacement

(wet-test) gas meter. The method does not provide
highly precise values but by observing the trend of a
sample series the end points for HF-H, treatment and
for H, reduction can be estimated. The salt is sampled
at the end of the run by inserting a copper sample cup
into the melt through an argon-purged sampling device;
the sampling rod and cup which contacts the salt are
hydrogen-fired to eliminate oxides before sampling.
Analytical results on the salt made to date show iron at
130 ppm, chromium at 49 ppm, nickel at 38 ppm,
sulfur at 6 ppm and oxygen at 112 ppm. These are
averages for all samples, and probably the values are
reasonably representative except for oxygen. Due to

.early sampling and sample handling problems, many of

184

the oxygen results are high. The behavior of these salts
in corrosion loop experiments tends to verify this last
statement.

The facility and equipment-preparation effort has
been concerned mainly with the large production
facility. A new 12-in.-diam processing reactor and a new
meltdown vessel which were designed and fabricated to
pressure-vessel code requirements were installed in the
existing furnaces in the production facility. The elec-
trical power system was upgraded to provide separate
contactors for the furnace operating controls and for
the high-temperature safety cut-off. All metallic parts
of the equipment were grounded and new auxiliary
line-heating circuits with Variac control were installed.
All piping was either renewed or inspected and cleaned.
The charging system for loading the component mate-
rials into the meltdown vessel was rebuilt for more
positive flow of solids into the vessel. All control and
alarm circuits were checked and unused circuits and
equipment were removed. A new hydrogen-control
system was installed for protection against loss of
hydrogen pressure or loss of electrical power.

The peripheral functions included cleaning and fabri-
cation of salt containers to be used for delivery
purposes. A variety of vessels is needed to meet the
needs of experimenters, and all must be of suitable
materials (copper or high-nickel alloys) and must be
thoroughly cleaned. Other work included preparation
of a heated vat (located in a special building) for
removing beryllium-containing fluoride salts from
equipment before repair or modifications. Solutions
from the vat are drained into an open concrete pit
where they are held temporarily. When a sufficient
volume accumulates, the solution (contaminated with

185

beryllium and thorium) is pumped into a tank trailer
and taken away for disposal. A 1200-gal steel tank
located in Building 9201-3 which serves as a holding
tank for solutions from floor drains and sinks in the
salt-production area was leaking and was repaired.

Work at the present and in the immediate future will
be concentrated on production of salt having the
composition 72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF, in the
large production facility (155 kg per batch).
