MSBR CONTROL STUDIES

ABSTRACT

A preliminary study was made of the dynamics and control of a 1000 Mw(e),
single-fluid MSBR by an analog computer simulation. An abbreviated, lumped-
parameter model was used. The control system included a steam temperature con-
troller and a simplified version of the MSRE reactor temperature control system. The
results of the study indicate a need for a variable speed, secondary=salt pump for
close control of the steam temperature. During severe transients, considerable care
must be taken in designing the control system if freezing or overheating of the salts
is to be avoided.

1. INTRODUCTION

By means of an analog computer simulation, a preliminary investigation was
made of the dynamics and possibilities for control of the proposed 1000~-Mw(e) single-
fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). For the purposes of this analysis the MSBR
plant consisted of a graphite-moderated, circulating-fuel (primary salt) reactor, a
shell-and-tube heat exchanger for transferring the generated heat to a coolant (sec-
ondary) salt, and a shell-and-tube supercritical steam generator. The analog simula~
tion of the plant consisted of a lumped-~parameter heat transfer model for the core,
primary heat exchanger, and steam generator; a six-group model of the circulating-
fuel nuclear kinetics with temperature reactivity feedbacks; and an external control
system. This investigation was concerned with the formulation of this control system
and the integrated plant response; it was not concerned with a safety analysis of the
system, although some of the transients introduced would be of an abnormal nature
(e.g., step changes in the load demand on the plant). It was an initial probe into
the response of the system initiated by such perturbations as changes in load demand,
reactivity changes, and sudden loss of a secondary-salt coolant loop.

The simulation was carried out on the ORNL Reactor Controls Department an-
alog computer. So that the model would have the maximum dynamic range, the system
differential equations were not linearized, and, as aresult, the requisite quantity of
nonlinear equipment required the model to be severely limited spatially to minimize
the number of equations. In addition, the pressure in the water side of the steam gen-
erator, as well as in the rest of the plant, and the physical properties of the salts and
water were taken to be time invariant. The flow rate of the primary salt and the tem-
perature of the feedwater to the steam generators were also held constant.

In this report, the path taken to arrive at the conceptual control system is out-
lined along with the equations and values of the system parameters used in the simula-
tion. The results are given as summary curves and graphs of the variations encountered
in the system variables (femperatures, flows, etc.).
2. FORMULATION OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM

2.1 investigation of Plant Conditions for Less than Full-Load Operation

The primary objective of this study was to formulate a control system that would
maintain the temperature of the steam delivered to the turbines at a design value of
1000°F during all steady-state conditions and to within a narrow band around this value
during plant transients. To accomplish this objective, the first step was to investigate
the plant conditions (temperature profile, flows, etc.) for less than full-load operation.
(The full-load temperature profile is shown in Fig. 1. The steady-state heat transfer
equations and the method used in calculating off-design conditions are given in the
Appendix, Sect. 5.1.) Three basic methods of plant operation at less than full foad
were investigated:

1. The average reactor temperature was held at its 100% power level value, and a
secondary-salt bypass line was included in parallel with the steam generators.
The salt flow in the bypass line was given by

2. The average reactor temperature was held fixed ot its 100% power-level value, and
there was no secondary-salt bypass.

3. The secondary-salt flow rate was held fixed at its 100% power-level value, and
there was no secondary-salt bypass.

With the first two methods of plant operation the temperature of the secondary
salt approached its freezing point of 725°F at power levels = 50% of full power. With
the third method, however, the secondary-salt temperatures remained well above the
freezing point. With the second method, the AT from primary to secondary salt in the
primary heat exchanger increased from 150 to 335°F at the primary-salt exit end of
the exchanger at 50% power, and the AT increased at the steam outlet end of the steam
generator as well. The increases in these AT's were reduced for the first method where
a valved bypass line had been placed around the steam generator, but this also was
more complex because a flow control valve and a variable speed pump were required.
The simpler arrangement of the third method showed that the AT's from primary to sec-
ondary salt and from secondary salt to steam decreased with decreasing power level
except at the feedwater inlet end of the steam generator where it increased only 65°F
at 30% power (Fig. 2). This AT increase occurred in the coolest part of the system,
however. Therefore, the third method of plant control, in which the secondary-salt
flow rate was held constant, appeared to be the most promising from the viewpoint of
simplicity and thermal stresses on the heat exchangers.

2.2 Transient Behavior of Control Method with Constant Secondary=Salt Flow Rate

A steam-temperature controller was devised to vary the plant temperature pro-
file as shown in Fig. 2. The transient behavior of such a control scheme was investi-
gated by use of the analog computer simulation model shown in Fig. 3. Each heat
exchanger was divided into five lumps: two for each of the two fluids and one for the
tube walls. The reactor heat transfer system was approximated by two lumps for the
circulating primary salt and one for the graphite moderator. A two-group approxi~
mation of the circulating-fuel nuclear kinetics equations was used, and temperature
reactivity feedbacks were included. (The system equations that describe the model
are given in the Appendix, Sect. 5.2. The values of the physical constants and system
parameters used as "given" information are shown in Table 1. The values for various
system volumes, masses, etc., were calculated from these constants and are listed in

Sect. 5.2.)

The steady-state partial-load calculations showed that a reasonable system-
temperature profile could be obtained for off-design conditions by maintaining a con-
stant secondary=-salt flow rate and by allowing the reactor and secondary-salt temper-
atures to vary. The transient behavior of such a system was investigated, using at first
only that part of the simulation model that included the primary heat exchanger and
the steam generator. The secondary=-salt flow rate was held constant, and the steam

portional to the steam temperature error, or

A brief parameter study of a showed that with a gain of about 1°F/sec change
in To per 10°F error in T the steam temperature returned to its design value of 1000°F
and remained stable. At higher gains the system became unstable. For a typical trans-
ient initiated by a 10% step decrease in load demand from 100 to 90% of full load
(Fig.4), 100 sec was required for the steam temperature to return to within 1°F of its
design value. One method of reducing the time required for the steam temperature to
return to its design value would be to vary the secondary-salt flow rate during a trans-
ient. This would enable close control of the amount of heat delivered to the steam
generator, resulting in more restrictive temperature control.

2.3 Study of Steam Temperature Control with Variable Secondary-Salt Flow Rate

Restrictive temperature control was accomplished by the control system shown in
Fig. 3. The steam-temperature error was allowed to control the rate of change of the
secondary-salt flow rate by

dF

— -a(T7 ~ 170). (3)

Then, after the steam temperature transient, the flow rate was slowly adjusted to its
original full-power value by allowing the flow rate error to change the temperature of

the primary salt entering the primary heat exchanger by a second controller having a
gain of fB:

dT F

where F20 is the initial full-power value of the secondary-salt flow rate Fy

A brief parameter study of a and B indicated that a reasonable steam-temperature
response was obtained when a 1°F steam-temperature error produced a secondary=-salt
flow rate change of 10%/min and a 1% error in flow rate produced a primary-salt tem~-
perature change of 1°F/min.

With this control system, a 10% step decrease in power demand from 100 to
90% of full load produced the transient shown in Fig. 5. The steam temperature re-
turned to within 1°F of the design value in about 30 sec, as compared with 100 sec
described previously. The maximum change in the secondary-salt flow rate was about
20%, i.e., from 100 to 80% of the design value; the maximum rate of change was
about 50%/min. The flow rate returned to within 3% of its design value in approx-
imately 250 sec (4.2 min).

With the addition of the reactor heat transfer and nuclear kinetics equations
to the model, the temperature of the primary salt entering the primary heat exchanger
(reactor outlet temperature) was controlled by inserting or withdrawing control rods to
change the reactor power according to the error in the secondary=-salt flow rate. Steam
temperature control by means of the secondary=-salt flow rate remained the same. The
rate of change of the set point for the reactor outlet temperature Ty op WOS obtained
from the error in the secondary=~salt flow rate, as follows: 2 set

which is similar to Eq (4). This controller slowly adjusted the reactor outlet temperature
set point in the proper direction until the secondary-salt flow rate returned to its 100%
power value.

The values for the controller gains a and B were adjusted for the transient runs
such that a 3°F error in steam temperature yielded a 10% per min rate of change of the
secondary-salt flow rate and a 1% error in the secondary-salt flow rate yielded a 1.7°F
per min rate of change of the reactor outlet temperature set point. These values were
obtained after a brief parameter study in which a 10% step decrease was initiated in
the plant load demand and the gains were adjusted to yield the minimum steam temper=
ature deviation.

The required set point for the reactor power level Pr sef is obtained from the
reactor outlet temperature set point by

where A is the proportionality constant between reactor power and reactor AT. Thus,
as the reactor outlet temperature set point is altered by the secondary-salt flow rate,
the reactor power level set point will be altered as well. The error in the reactor
power level is given by

where G is the controller gain, w is the bandwith, and ( is the damping factor. In
this simulation w equaled 31.42 radians/sec (5 Hz) and  equaled 0.5. These values
are typical of the kind and size of servo which may be used in this control-rod-drive
service. The gain of the controller was such that for €. 2 1% of full reactor power
the control reactivity addition or withdrawl rate was

For errors less than 1%, the rate of change of reactivity was proportional to
the error. For errors greater than 1%, the reactivity rate was maintained constant at
the 0.1%/sec valve. Integration of Eq. (9) yields the term p _ in the reactivity equa-
tion (see Sect. 5.2). This method of con’rrollin% the reactor outlet temperature is
similar to that used in the MSRE control system.

To obtain more realistic transient results from the simulation, limits were im-
posed on several of the system variables, as follows:

1. The secondary-salt flow rate was limited to a range from 40 to 110% of the full-
power flow rate.

2. The maximum steam flow rate was limited to 110% of the full-power flow rate.

3. The reactor outlet temperature set point was constrained to a range from 1000 to
1400°F (100°F over and 300°F under its full-power value of 1300°F).

4, A 5-sec first-order lag was introduced between the steam flow rate demand F
in Eq. (43) in Sect. 5.2 and the steam flow rate in the system F, in Egs. (363 -
(40), in order to better simulate the response of a turbine throttle valve.

3. RESULTS

Calculations of the temperature profiles with the system under partial load at
steady state were made using the steady-state form of the analog simulation equations
in Sect. 5.2. The variation of salt temperatures with various steady-state power
levels is shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6 also shows the variation of the same salt temper-
atures obtained by use of another method of calculation described in Sect. 5.1.
Divergence of the two sets of curves begins at about the 50% power level. Thus, if
it is assumed that the calculation method of Sect. 5.1 is more reliable for predicting
system temperature profiles at steady state, the present analog simulation model is
valid only at power levels greater than approximately 50%.

Several transient cases were run which included (1) decreases in load demand
P from 100% by steps of 10, 30, 50, and 60%; (2) ramp changes of 30 and 70% each
of 5 and 10%/min; (3) changes in reactivity of steps of +0.05, +0.1, and -0.5%; and
(4), with the reactivity controller disconnected, (a) reactivity steps of £0.05, +0.01,
and -0.1% and (b) ramp changes in reactivity of +0.05 and =0.1% at 0.1%/min. Also,
the step loss of one secondary-salt coolant loop was simulated. The system transfer
function Pe(s)/p(s) was also measured.

3.1 Decrease in Load Demand

The action of the system during a typical load demand transient was as follows.
When the load demand P, was decreased, the steam flow rate decreased, transferring
less heat out of the steam generators and decreasing the heat transfer coefficient be-
tween the steam generator tubes and the steam. This caused the steam femperature to
begin to rise. The steam temperature controller sensed the steam temperature error
and began to decrease the secondary-salt flow rate at a rate proportional to the tem-
perature error in order to transfer less heat into the steam generator and to decrease
the heat transfer coefficient between the secondary salt and the steam-generator tubes.
The transfer of heat from the secondary salt at the reduced flow necessary for steam
temperature control caused the temperature of the secondary salt leaving the steam
generator to decrease. The reduction in flow rate also decreased the amount of heat
transferred out of the primary heat exchanger as well as the heat transfer coefficient
between the primary-heat-exchanger tubes and the secondary salt. The primary salt
was, thus, returned to the reactor at a higher temperature, producing the reactor
power error signal . As this error was sensed by the reactivity servo controller, the
control rods were withdrawn (inserting negative reactivity) to reduce the reactor power
commensurate with the decrease in load demand. The secondary=~salt flow rate con-
troller sensed the decrease in the flow rate and began to decrease the reactor outlet
temperature set point at a rate proportional to the secondary-salt flow rate error. A
new steady-state operation was achieved when the steam temperature reached its
design value of 1000°F and the secondary-salt flow rate its full-power value.

The results of a 30% decrease in load demand from 100% as o step and af rates
of 10 and 5%/min are shown in Figs. 7-9. The reduction of the temperature of the
secondary-salt leaving the steam generator after a change in load demand is shown in
these figures. For large, rapid changes in load demand, the temperafure of the sec-
ondary-salt may approach its freezing point (725°F). This possibility exists also when
the load demand on the plant is increased. Under such conditions the steam temper-
ature initially tends to decrease, causing the steam temperature controller to accel-
erate the flow of secondary salt, which will transfer more heat into the steam gen-
erator. Since this flow may increase only to 110% of full flow, a sufficiently rapid
load increase will cause the temperature of the secondary salt leaving the steam gen-
erator to decrease and, perhaps, approach the freezing point. However, increases
in plant load will usually occur in a more orderly and controlled fashion than decreases
since, under accident conditions, decreases will be more probable. Increases in load
must be accomplished in a carefully controlled manner.

The data from Figs. 7-9 and the results of other runs made with changes in load
demand are summarized in Table 2 which also lists the maximum steam temperature de-
viations from 1000°F, the maximum required rates of change of the secondary=-salt flow
rate and of the control reactivity, and the maximum magnitude of the control reactivity
requited. The highest reactivity rate was well below the 0.1%/sec maximum allowed
by the controller.

A plot was made of the maximum steam temperature variation from 1000°F as
a function of change in load demand (Fig. 10). The plot shows, for example, that a
step change of 30% in load demand from 100 to 70% of full power produced a max-
imum steam temperature deviation of about +42°F at some point in the transient. The
break upwards in the three curves for load changes greater than 30% was caused by the
40% lower limit imposed on the secondary=-salt flow rate. Changes in load of more than
30% required a change of greater than 60% in the secondary-salt flow rate to maintain
control of the steam temperature. When this lower [imit was reached, control of the
steam temperature was considerably reduced and higher deviations allowed to occur.

3.2 Changes of Reactivity

The results of reactivity steps of 0.1 and -0.5% are shown in Figs. 11 and
12. A +0.1% step yielded a peak reactor power of about 155% as a puise with a
fwhm (full-width, half maximum) of about 0.75 sec. This is an excess energy input
of approximately 930 Mw~sec. The reactor outlet temperature peak deviation from
1300°F was about 25°F. The reactor inlet temperature and steam temperatures varied
only a few degrees. The control reactivity changed at its maximum allowable speed
in a direction te counter the reactivity step. A negative reactivity insertion of -0.5%
decreased the reactor power sharply to about 18% before the control reactivity re-
turned it to its 100% level ofter a 35% overshoot (Fig. 12). The reactor outlet tem-
perature peak change was about =100°F, and the peak steam temperafure variation
was about -15°F.

3.3 Step Changes of Reactivity with Controller Disconnected

With the reactivity controller disconnected so that a reactor power-level
error proditced no response from the reactivity servo (i.e., no control-rod motion),
step changes of +0.05 and -0.1% were studied (Figs. 13 and 14). The +0.05%
step change produced a peak reactor power of about 147%, and the reactor tem-
peratures increased to a value commensurate with the negative temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity. The secondary-salt flow rate decreased to its 40% lower
[imit, after which steam temperature control was lost. The final steam temperature
deviation was +75°F. The decrease in secondary-salt flow rate caused a decrease
in the temperature of the secondary-salt leaving the steam generator. This temper-
ature decreased to as low as 690°F during the transient, returning to a steady-state
value of approximately 735°F. (The secondary-salt freezing point is 725°F.) Sim-
ilar reactivity transients in runs made without limiting the secondary-salt flow rate
to a minimum of 40% of full flow caused this temperature to decrease to well below
its freezing point. Without the reactivity controller, control of the reactor outlet
temperature set point was lost; the outlet temperature reached 1485°F as its steady -
state value (Fig. 12). The steady-state temperature of the secondary-salt leaving
the primary heat exchanger was 1470°F.

The negative reactivity step of -0.1% (Fig. 14) required a decrease to 50%
in the steady-state reactor power level to produce the compensating reactivity by
means of the negative temperature coefficient. The primary-salt temperature at the
reactor inlet decreased to approximately 865°F--well below its freezing point of
930°F. The secondary-salt flow rate quickly increased to its 110% limit, after
which steam temperature control was lost. The final steam temperature was 840°F.
At this low temperature, the steam flow rate increased in an attempt to meet the
100% load demand on the plant, but it was also limited to 110% of full flow rate.
These conditions correspond to a plant output of 51% of full power, which matches
the observed steady-state reactor power.

3.4 Ramp Changes of Reactivity with Controller Disconnected

With the reactivity controller still disconnected, ramp changes in reactivity
of +0.05 and -0.1% at 0.1%/min were inserted. The positive-ramp insertion pro-
duced a peak power of about 130%. Again, the secondary-salt flow rate decreased
to its 40% lower limit, and steam temperature control was lost. Both of these ramp
reactivity perturbations produced much the some response as the step insertions of
the same amount except that the reactor power changed more slowly.

3.5 Step Loss of One Secondary~-Salt Coolant Loop

A simulation of the loss of one secondary-salt coolant loop was attempted as
follows (see Fig. 3). In a four~loop system the temperature of the primary-salt enter-
ing the reactor core is the average of the temperatures of the primary-salt leaving the
four primary heat exchangers. We call the reactor core inlet temperature T]T, and the
primary~salt outlet temperatures from the four primary heat exchangers Ty 127 T]3,
and TM} then, with perfect mixing

To= Ty # T, + T

]
- 1
] 4} 11 12 (10)

13 7 Tl

We now assume that if one of the primary heat exchangers, e.g., number 4, suddenly
were to cease to remove heat from the primary salt, the reduction in heat removal
would appear as a step increase in the primary-salt outlet temperature T4 from 1050
to 1300°F. If the other heat exchangers were to remain unchanged, the reactor core
inlet temperature would become

-

1 T..+tT,.,+T

- +

2T T T2 T g T Ty (n
Thus, the reactor core inlet temperature would be changed as a step at t = 0 from T
to T,.

1
Similarly, the steam temperature to the turbine is the average of the steam

temperatures from the sixteen steam generators, four of which are supplied heat by
each secondary-salt coolant loop. If we call the steam temperature at the turbine T,
and the steam generator steam temperatures T7., then

o

L
7518 ]T7. (12)
|

i

If one secondary=-salt loop were to be lost suddenly, four steam generators would be
supplied heat no longer, say generators 13, 14, 15, and 16. We assume that this re-
duci'ion would appear as a step decrease in the steam generator outlet temperatures

B T7, 14~ T7’ 15 and T7’ 16 from 1000 to 700°F. The turbine steam temperature
would becdme

12
. 1
o +
T, ]6(;5i 4T6). (13)
£

Thus, the turbine steam temperature would be changed as a step at t = 0 from T

to T7. 7
27

The results of such a run are shown in Fig. 15. The turbine steam temperature
dropped as a step to 925°F, and the reactor inlet temperature rose to 1113°F. This
increase in reactor inlet temperature was accompanied by a sudden decrease in the
reactor power sef point, producing an error signal that indicated high reactor power.
The control rods were withdrawn (inserting negative reactivity) and, with the aid of
the negative primary=-salt reactivity temperature coefficient, the reactor power dropped
sharply to 70%. The steam flow rate increased to its 110% limit in an attempt to meet
the 100% load demand at the reduced steam temperature. The secondary-salt flow rate
increased to its 110% limit in an attempt to maintain the steam temperature at 1000°F.
With the loss of 25% of the heat transfer capability in the secondary [oop, the reactor
temperatures began to rise to meet the 100% load demand. However, when the reactor
outlet temperature reached its 1400°F limit, the reactor power had increased to only
92% of full load, and the steam temperature had increased to 956°F. Therefore, under
this accident condition and with the temperature and flow limits placed on the system,
the plant could not deliver 100% of full load with one secondary=salt loop inoperable.
Figure 15 also shows the result of decreasing the load demand to 75% at a rate of
10%)/min beginning 325 sec after the step loss of heat transfer capacity. The plant
could meet this demand at design steam conditions.

3.6 Measurement of System Transfer Function

The full power system transfer function Pr(s)/o(s) was measured with and with-
out the reactivity servo controller (Fig. 16). The curve for the case with no controller
is similar to previous data for the two—fluid MSBR,2 although the magnitude of the
peak gain at about 3 radians/sec (~0.5 Hz) was greater by a factor of about & for the
single-fluid case. Adding the servo controller greatly decreased the low~frequency
gain, as expected; above the upper cutoff frequency of 5 Hz ¢30 radians/sec) for the
servo it had no effect.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have described a preliminary investigation of the control problems asso-
ciated with the 1000-Mw(e) single-fluid MSBR. The control system was formulated
in four basic steps: the first was an estimation of the system temperature profiles for
partial load conditions, assuming various possible modes of plant control. Based on
these results the most promising mode of plant control was investigated for its dynamic
response, using only the primary heat exchanger and steam generator. The results
indicated that a variable secondary=salt flow rate would give better steam temper-
ature control during o transient, and this was investigated using the same model.

The reactor was then added to the simulation, and the response of the entire plant
to various perturbing conditions was studied.

The results indicate that careful control will be required to maintain the
temperatures of the two salts within the rather narrow allowable limits. Such plant
maneuvers as increasing and decreasing the load demand on the plant and certain
reactivity excursions might allow these temperatures to decrease below freezing
points. However, since the models used in these simulations and calculations were
abbreviated, the results are regarded only as indicative of possible trends that might
be elucidated in more detailed investigations. Such investigations were not possible
with the analog equipment available to the author without either linearizing the
simulation equations (reducing the dynamic range) or simulating only a part of the
plant ot a time, or both. Even then, the modeling of such a unit as a supercritical
steam generator would be a difficult task on the analog computer.3 A more detailed
simulation than was tried here should be attempted by employing more powerful sim-
ulation techniques, e.g., hybrid computation.

5.2 Description of the Analog Simulator Model

The following equations describe the analog simulation model used in this
study and shown in Fig. 3. The heat transfer driving force across the heat exchanger
tubes and from the graphite to the primary salt is shown by the dotted lines in the
figure. The mass of the primary salt and the primary-salt-to-tube-wall heat transfer
area in the primary heat exchanger were equally divided between the two primary-salt
lumps. Similar statements can be made about each of the remaining pairs of lumps
except in the case of the two steam lumps.
34

For the two steam lumps wy and wp, the density of the steam varies by a
factor of 7 in passing through the steam generator.® The mass of the steam in lump 1
was determined by the average density of the steam in the half of the steam generator
at the steam exit end. The mass was determined in a similar manner for lump 2. The
steam pressure was assumed constant at all times.

The simulation of C.{t - TL] requires a transport lag device of which only
two were available in the Reactor Controls Department analog computer. Both were
employed in the simulation of Eqs. (41) and (42), the transport lag between heat ex-
changers. Therefore, the term Ci(’r - TL) was approximated by
