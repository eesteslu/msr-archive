Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid
fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in
suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of
the effort begun over 20 years ago in the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion program to .make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at
ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while
simultaneously conserving and extending the nation’s
fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233JF, . dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but 235U or plutonium could be used for
startup. The fertile material would be ThF, dissolved
in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar
composition. The technology being developed for the
breeder is also applicable to high-performance converter
reactors.

A major program activity through 1969 was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This
reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials

.that would be used in thermal breeder and converter -

reactors and to provide experience with operation and
maintenance. The MSRE operated at 1200°F and
produced 7.3 MW of heat. The initial fuel contained 0.9
mole % UF4, 5% Z1F,, 29% BeF,, and 65% "LiF; the
uranjum was about 33% 23°U. The fuel circulated
through a reactor vessel and an external pump and heat

- exchange system. Heat produced in the reactor was
transferred to a coolant salt, and the coolant salt was .

pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to the
atmosphere. - All this equipment was constructed of
Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybdenum-iron-chromium
alloy. The reactor core contained an assembly of
graphite moderator bars that were in direct contact
with the fuel.

Design of the MSRE started in 1960, fabrication of
equipment began in 1962, and the reactor was taken
critical on June 1, 1965. Operation at low power began
in January 1966, and sustained power operation was
begun in December. One run continued for six months,
until terminated on schedule in March 1968.

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the
objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and technical feasibility of these
systems for civilian power reactors. We concluded that
this objective had been achieved and that the MSRE
had shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be oper-
ated at 1200°F without corrosive attack on either the
metal or graphite parts of the system, the fuel is stable,
reactor equipment can operate satisfactorily at these
conditions, xenon can be removed rapidly from molten
salts, and, when necessary, the radioactive equipment
can be repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.
In six days of fluorination, 221 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded onto ab-
sorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decon-
tamination and recovery of the uranium were very
good.

After the fuel was processed, a charge of 2??U was
added to the original carrier salt, and in October 1968
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 233U. The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with
the 233U were close to the predictions, and the reactor
was quite stable.

In September 1969, small amounts of PuF, were
added to the fuel to obtain some experience with
plutonium in a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE was shut
down permanently December 12, 1969, so that the

ix
 

 

 

 

funds supporting its operation could be used elsewhere
in the research and development program. '
Most of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now

~ devoted to the technology needed for future molten-

salt reactors. The program includes conceptual design

studies and work on materials, the chemistry of fuel

and coolant salts, fission product behavior, processing

methods, and the development of components and

systems. '
Because of limitations on the chemical processing

methods available at the time, until three years ago -

most of our work on breeder reactors was aimed at

~ two-fluid systems in which graphite tubes would be

used to separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from

thorium-bearing fertile salts. In late 1967, however, a

. one-fluid breeder became feasible because of the devel-
opment of processes that use liquid bismuth to isolate

protactinium and remove rare earths from a salt that
also contains thorium. Our studies showed that a

one-fluid breeder based on these processes can have fuel

utilization characteristics approaching those of our
two-fluid designs. Since the graphite serves only as
moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a
scaleup of the MSRE. These advantages caused us to

change the emphasis of our program from the two-fluid .

to the one-fluid breeder; most of our design and
development effort is now directed to the one-fluid
system.

Summary

PART 1. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

1. Design

Design studies were continued on the 300-MW(e)
MSDR. The core graphite was changed to slab shapes,
about 1% in. X 9% in. X 21 ft long. The slabs are held
in place by graphite posts which maintain the core
configuration yet permit movement to accommodate
temperature and radiation effects. Salt which reaches
the drain tank by entrainment in the gas effluent from
the gas separator is now returned to the primary
circulation system by two jet pumps located in a cluster
in the drain tank. The jets are actuated by salt flows
from the primary pumps and are arranged to prevent
pumpback of gas into the primary loops. The manifolds
that connect the NaK cooling circuit thimbles in the
drain tank have been rearranged to facilitate mainte-
nance, and three water tanks for heat rejection are now
provided instead of one. Seismic effects on the drain
tank and its cooling system have received preliminary
study. A basin has been provided in the drain tank cell
to catch accidental salt spills from the salt lines or
valves and to drain it into the fuel-salt drain tank.

“A study was made of the consequences of the mixing
of fuel and coolant salts as a result of various modes of
failure of tubing in the primary heat exchangers in the

MSBR ' reference design. Four specific cases were ex-

amined: (1) doubled-ended failure near the fuel-salt
outlet; (2) double-ended failure near the fuel salt inlet;
(3) small coolant-salt leak into the primary system; (4)
small fuel-salt leak into the secondary system. The
study is, in many places, speculative both because of
the preliminary status of the design and the lack of

-adequate ph'ys_icochemicral data on mixing of fuel and 7
coolant salts. However unpleasant some of the conse-

quences of tubing failure may be, no way of generating
either a nuclear excursion or a rupture in the primary or
secondary loop piping is foreseen.

xi

The incentives for side-stream processing of the
MSBR fuel salt for iodine and/or xenon removal as an
alternative means for dealing with the '3%Xe poison
level are being examined. lodine stripping would require
only small bypass flow rates, approximately 225 gpm
sufficing to reduce '35Xe poison level to ~1% in a
100% efficient stripper. Analysis of laboratory sparging
experiments indicates only negligible movement of
iodine as HI into the graphite. Combined xenon and
iodine strippers appear to be a reasonable development
goal and a highly attractive means for acluevmg 0.5%
poison level with uncoated graphite.

Design studies on the MSBE were continued with
emphasis on the core heat removal and core mainte-
nance. Both prismatic and slab-type graphite elements
were considered. Maintenance studies were also con-
ducted on repair of a leak in the primary heat
exchanger. o

A subcontract between ORNL and the Ebasco Ser-
vices Group, consisting of Ebasco, Babcock and Wilcox,
Byron Jackson, Cabot, Conoco, and Union Carbide
companies, was negotiated and signed. This industrial
group will conduct a design study of a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR plant. They have essentially completed the
selection of a reference conceptual design for further
study and evaluation.

2. Reactor Physiés

During the report period we completed and issued a
report describing the Reactor Optimum Design Code
(ROD), with instructions for its use. The code package
has been furnished to the Argonne Code Center, where
it is available upon request.

Since the Hastelloy N in the fuel system of an MSBR
should last for the life of the plant, we have calculated
the ‘radiation damage caused by delayed neutrons
emitted outside the core and by léakage neutrons from

the core. Results indicate that helium production,

 
 

 

 

primziri]y from !°B(n,&) reactions, would be the most
important source of damage (assuming an initial '°B

-concentration of 2 ppm). The lifetime helium pro-

duction in the heat exchanger due to delayed neutrons

would be less than 2 ppb with NaBF4-NaF coolant salt, -

or close to 50 ppb with Li, BeF, enriched to 99.995%

in the 7Li isotope. In the reactor outlet line, the

terminal helium concentration would be less than 10
ppb from the delayed neutron source. Rather larger
amounts of helium could be produced by core-leakage
neutrons in parts of the heat exchangers or piping
directly facing the reactor vessel. For our present
reference design, the maximum amount of helium could
approach 1 ppm, primarily from 52 Ni(n,a) reactions.
We calculated various reactivity coefficients for the
MSBE and compared them with values for our reference
MSBR. The most noteworthy differences are a positive
fuel-salt density coefficient for the MSBE (negative for

‘the MSBR) and the negative graphite temperature

coefficient for the MSBE (positive for the MSBR). Both

of these differences are associated with a greater
* neutron leakage from the smaller MSBE, and result in a
- much more negative overall temperature coefficient,

that is, ~8 X 107%/°C vs —0.9 X 1075/°C for the
MSBR.

Investigation of batch fuel cycles for fixed-moderator
molten-salt reactors has been continued. We have found
that reactor lifetime-averaged reaction-rate coefficients

~are adequate for calculating the time-dependent fuel

composition throughout the lifetime for enriched-
uranium-fueled reactors, but only for the asymptotic
portion of the lifetime for recycled-plutonium-fueled
reactors. Reaction coefficients calculated specifically
for the beginning of the lifetime are required for
plutonium calculations, because the amounts of pluto-
nium in the system at startup are sufficient to cause
significant hardening of the neutron spectrum. Calcula-
tions with plutonium feed are continuing. :

Results are presented for a reactor designed as a
breeder (with continuous processing) but operated as a
converter, with enriched-uranium feed and batch
processing in four cycles over the lifetime of the
reactor. An average conversion ratio greater than 90%
and a fuel cost, excluding processing, of about 0.76
mlll/kWhr were found for this reactor.

3. Systems.and Components Development

Tests on t_he MSBE-scale bubble separator were
continued in the water loop to study the formation of
the very fine bubbles encountered with the water-
glycerol test fluid and to evaluate the separator per-

formance with these small bubbles. These tests showed
that the production of the small bubbles is influenced

mostly by the pump head and speed. Dilution tests run
with CaCl, solution showed a very sharp increase in
separator efficiency as the concentration approached
2.7 wt %, probably the point at which significant

bubble coalescence began. Such a threshold at a lower

concentration has been discussed in the recent litera-
ture. Attempts to increase the vortex to the length
needed to separate gas from the higher viscosity fluids
led to an instability when the gas flowed at the rates
needed. However, removal of the core from the annular
recovery hub resulted in satisfactory vortex stability
over the full gas flow range. A test is being planned to
compare the bubble formation and coalescence proper-
ties of molten salt with those of demineralized water

-and other solutions.

The conceptual system design description and the
quality assurance plan for the molten-salt loop for
testing gas systems (GSTF) were completed, and the
design is proceeding.

A report is being written on the design bases for
molten-salt reactor off-gas systems.

The development of a computer program for the
design of charcoal beds for MSR off-gas systems was
started. The plan is to develop a new program by
revising and expanding existing programs. The existing
programs provide necessary information, but they are
not arranged to be of maximum usefulness to the
designer.

Foster Wheeler Corporatlon was chosen as the com-
pany to perform the conceptual design study of the
steam generator for use with molten-salt reactors. The
scope of work finally included in the request for
proposal package differed from that reported pre-
viously. The changes basically limit the industrial firm
to work on the steam generator and exclude the
systems design work originally requested.

Work continued on the preparation of a conceptual

_system design description for the steam generator

technology facility (SGTF). This facility would be a
side loop of the coolant-salt technology facility (CSTF)
and would be used to study transients and steady-state
operation of some full- and part-length tube test
sections of a molten-salt steam generator. A study was
made of the configurations which could be used in the
SGTF and the larger (3 MW) steam generator tube test
stand (STTS). It was found that only the %- and
%-in.-diam steam tubes could be tested in the 150-kW
SGTF at full length and that larger tubes could be
tested only under limited inlet and outlet conditions.

C .
 

 

 

i

However, multiple tubes and tubes up to about 1n. in

‘diameter could be tested in the STTS.

' The PKP pump rotary element was disassemnbled, and
the component parts were visually examined. Except

* for the inner heat baffle plates, the appearance of the

Inconel metal surfaces indicated insignificant corrosive
attack. The inner heat baffle plates were severely
attacked, and this effect was attributed to the forma-
tion of corrosive products by reaction of moisture in
the incoming purge gas with puddles of NaBF, salt
which were present on the heat baffle plates as a result

- of ingassing transients.

The mechanical design of the CSTF is nearing
completion. The design now includes the corrosion
product trap for studying the deposition of corrosion
products and the on-line monitoring station for study-
ing the electrochemical and surface properties of the
salt. The parts of the MSRE to be used in the
construction have been removed and cleaned in prepara-
tion for assembly. Fabrication of the drain tank and the
specimen .surveillance station was completed. Fabrica-
tion of the corrosion product trap and the on-line
monitoring station was started.

The pump requirements for the CSTF and the GSTF
were reviewed, and a plan for adapting the pumps from
the MSRE program was developed. It was found
desirable to alter the MSRE Mark II pump by use of
available equipment to provide additional head.

After making temporary repairs to the ALPHA pump,
it was installed in the MSR-FCL-2 ‘test facility and 1s
being operated at test program design conditions. »

A study of a particular jet pump system (two pumps
in series) for returning fuel salt from the drain tank to
the fuel-salt system in a Molten-Salt Demonstration’
Reactor indicated that the system was hydrauhcally
sultable for the apphcatlon '

5. Heat and Mass Transfer and Physical_ Propérties_ .

‘Heat transfer. The influence of the magnitude of the
temperature coefficient of viscosity on the variation of
the heat transfer coefficient along a tube has been
determined with and without a hydrodynamic (un-

Xiii

heated) entrance, using a proposed MSBR fuel salt as
the working fluid. Experiments were performed at two
temperatures, 1450 and ~1100°F, for which the
temperature coefficients of viscosity differ by a factor
of 4, the higher coefficient corresponding to the lower
temperature. Results indicate that, in the transitional
flow regime of these experiments (Reynolds modulus
3000 to 4000), increasing the negative temperature
coefficient by decreasing the average temperature re-
sults in a reduction in the heat transfer coefficient near
the exit of the heated length (120 L/D) for operation
without a hydrodynamic entrance region. The influence
of temperature for operation with an entrance region
was found not to be significant beyond L/D of about
40. The observed influence of temperature on heat-
transfer development is attributed to the stabilizing
effect of heating for the case of a fluid whose negative
temperature coefficient of viscosity is relatively large

Thermophysical properties. New measurements have
been made of thermal conductivity of the mixture
LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) over the range 300 to 870°C
using an improved variable-gap apparatus capable of
+10% or better accuracy. These new results suggest that
the temperature dependency of thermal conductivity
for this mixture is smaller than previous measurements
had indicated. The ratio of the thermal conductivity of
the liquid to that of the solid was determined to be
~0.75.

coefficients have been measured and correlated for
helium bubbles (mean diameter from 0.015 to 0.05 in.)

high flow, the horizontal and vertical results "are
equivalent and are correlated in terms of the dimension-

PART 2. CHEMISTRY
6 Postoperational Exanﬁiiation of MSRE

A graphite stringer removed from the core of the
MSRE after being exposed to fissioning molten salt for
the total duration of MSRE operation appeared to be in
e ot AL e o e e o

 

generally good condition, with sharp corners, clean
surfaces, and no visible evidence of attack by corrosion
or radiation. X-ray diffraction analysis of material from
the surface suggested that Mo, C, Ru metal, Cr,C;, and
NiTe, may have been present but that Mo metal, Te
metal, . Cr metal, CiTe, and MoTe, were probably
absent. Gamma scanning of cross sections of the
stringer by a pinhole technique showed the deposition
of 1258b and ! °¢Ru to be limited to the surface and to
be very spotty and erratic.

‘Samples milled from the surface to the middle of the
graphite stringer were dissolved and analyzed radio-
chemically for many long-lived fission product species.
The samples were also analyzed chemically and by
delayed neutron counting for U, Li, Be, Zr, Fe, Ni, Mo,
and Cr by spectrographic. methods. The observed
concentration profiles for these species were generally
in agreement with behavior previously observed for the
surveillance specimens. The uranium analyses indicated
that there was a total of about 10 g of 233U on and in
all of the graphite in the MSRE. The spectrographic

" analyses indicated traces of nickel in a few of the

outermost surface samples. The radiochemical analyses
showed that the “noble metals” (*°%Ru, '25Sb,
110Ag 95Nb, and 127Te) were concentrated at the
surface, that the ?%Sr (33-sec ?%Kr precursor) had a
much steeper concentration profile than ®°Sr (3.2-min
89Kr precursor), and that the profiles for 1**Cs and
137Cs indicated appreciable diffusion of cesium toward
the fuel salt. The ®°Co analyses indicated that some
nickel had deposited on the graphite surfaces.
“Careful analyses for tritium in the MSRE graphite
yielded the surprising result that nearly 15% of the
tritium produced in the MSRE was retained by the
graphite, About one-half of this tritium was trapped in
the outer 0.15 cm of the graphite stringer.
Concentration profiles for two cesium isotopes,
137Cs and !3%Cs, were obtained on the graphite bar
from the MSRE core center, removed in early 1971.

 These profiles demonstrate diffusion of cesium atoms,

probably on internal graphite surfaces, after adsorption
at rates consistent with estimates based on data from
gas-cooled reactor studies.

The recovery of segments of surfaces from the MSRE
fuel circulating system in January 1971 has permitted
the determination of intensity of deposition of fission

-product isotopes in the core, heat exchanger, and pump

bowl. Antimony, tellurium, technetium, ruthenium,

- and . niobium were found deposited strongly on both

metal and graphite surfaces, with intensities somewhat
greater than previously observed on surveillance speci-
mens. '

Cobalt-60, found on segments of MSRE heat ex-
changer tubing and core graphite bar, must have come
from neutron irradiation of Hastelloy N, with subse-
quent transport and deposition. Higher values on core
graphite indicates further activation after deposition.
General metal loss and deposition are indicated. The
reactor vessel walls are suggested as a source, the

 transported metal possibly being sputtered by fission

fragments from adjacent fuel.

1. Hydfogen and Tritium Behavior in Molten Salts

Modifications were made to the experimental appara-
tus in an effort to improve the reproducibility of the
data. Results for helium solubility in Li; BeF, indicate
that these efforts have been successful; although the
hydrogen solubility data still show an uncomfortable
degree of scatter, we believe this to be due to air
inleakage over prolonged periods. The effects of such
inleakage can be corrected by a straxghtforward but
tedious procedure.

Tests of the efficiency of hydrogen recovery in the

stripper chamber of the apparatus indicate at least 90%

‘operation. Moreover,

of the gas can be recovered within a 2-hr period of
in contrast with our previous
(probably erroneous) result, only 5% of the hydrogen
recovered resulted frorn the stnpper annulus col-

- lections.

Measurements of the transport of hydrogen through
Kovar metal at 495°C. indicate that the -pressure
dependence for the rate of transport can be described
by P?, where n = 0.560 £ 0.011 over the pressure range
1.4 torrs < P < 800 torrs. The product of the diffusion
coefficient and solubility constant characteristic of this
system under the conditions cited was found to be. DK
=(5.18 £ 0.24) X 107! moles/cm-min-torr”.

In studies with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer,
pure NaBF3;OH was shown to decompose completely
under continual pumping at 100°C. The volatile
product was pure water, and the yield was precisely 0.5
mole H, O per mole of NaBF 3 OH. Continued heating to
800°C ylelded only BFj;, whose evolution began at
about 245°C, and NaF, whose vapor appeared -at
725°C.

In preliminary experiments with the TOF mass
spectrometer, pure anhydrous sodium nitrate was
shown to evolve only NO and O, over the temperature
range 380 to 400°C.

The use of a dissociating-gas heat transfer system
using nitrogen dioxide (N;O; =NO, =NO+0,)(?~>
N, + 0,) under development in the U.S.S.R. appears to
offer possibilities to the Molten-Salt Breeder of miti-
 

 

 

vt

gation of tritium losses from the power system. Under
dissociating conditions the effective heat capacity and
effective thermal conductivity of the gas are increased
severalfold, resulting in increased efficiency of heat
transport, higher cycle efficiency, and the possibility of
lower equipment costs.

8. Processing Chemistry

As expected, it has been found that the precipitation
of Pa** from a molten mixture of LiF-BeF,-ThF,
produces a ThQ,-PaO, solid solution. From measure-
ments of the distribution of Pa** to this phase it can be
predicted that in the event of an accidental contami-
nation with oxide of an MSBR fuel, the precipitated
phase would consist mainly of a UQ,-ThQO, solid
solution with little PaO, dissolved in it.

In further studies of the precipitation of the much
less soluble Pa(V) oxide, its solubility in the presence of
UF, and a UO,-rich oxide phase has been found close

‘to the predicted value, based on measurements in the

absence of uranium. These results thus confirm that
Pa** can be precipitated by oxide from an MSBR fuel
salt while precipitating no other oxide.

A comparative evaluation of bismuth-lead eutectic
with pure bismuth for application in the reductive
extraction process was made. Distributions of barium
and thorium between the eutectic melt and LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) were determined at 650°C
after successive additions of lithium metal were made.

9. Development and Evaluation of Analytical
Methods for Molten-Salt Reactors

The first successful in-line analyses of a flowing salt
stream are now being performed. Trivalent uranium is
being determined in an MSRE-type salt in a thermal

‘convection loop using the voltammetric technique.

The equilibrium quotient for barium, Dg,/ |

(Dp)? =9.81 X 10%, from this experiment was 2.4
times less than that reported for pure bismuth. The
equilibrium quotient for thorium, Dy, /(D )* = 6.64 X
108, was 3.7 times greater than reported for this salt

‘and pure bismuth. The indicated solubility of thorium
in the eutectic at 650°C was approximately 1500 ppm
by weight or about -one-half that of thorium in pure-

bismuth.

The removal of cerium from molten LiCl onto Linde

4A, sodium form, No. 8 mesh zeolite was demonstrated

‘at 650°C. For a 1-kg batch of LiCl-CeCly (99.5-0.5

mole %) and successive exposures to 14-g aliquots of
dried zeolite, loading capacities of about 0.13 g of
cerium per gram of zeolite were found. Within the
precision of the data the distribution of cerium between

the molten chloride and solid zeolite phases could be

expressed empirically as In  (ppm Ce in
LiCl)=12.163 + 1.35 In (g Ce/g zeolite) for cerium
concentrations down to 4600 ppm. Analyses of the salt
phase showed essentially complete exchange of lithium
for sodium in the zeolite.

Concentrations of U(III) from 0.02 to 0.15% of the
total uranium have been measured. For these deter-
minations we are using a special voltammeter that has
been modified for operation with the counter electrode
at ground potential and can be operated by a PDP-81
computer. This system is operated automatically and

performs analyses at hourly intervals. During one 72-hr

period of constant U(III) concentration the precision of
the determinations was about 2%. This operation has
uncovered two problems not encountered in quiescent
laboratory melts: interference from particulate matter
on the melt’s surface and an unexpectedly high effect
of surface vibrations on the electrode response. These
problems have largely been resolved by shielding the
working electrode in a nickel tube which opens below
the surface of the melt and is purged of salt by a stream
of helium until immediately before the analyses are

made. This feature should also extend electrode life and

will be incorporated in future in-line systems.

We are developing a simple slotted optical probe that
will prove useful for the analysis of fluid streams. Its
application to MSRP streams will depend on the
discovery of an optical material that is impervious to
molten fluorides. At present, LaF; appears to be the

~ best candidate for NaBF, streams.

A large part of our development effort was directed
toward the analysis of NaBF,, particularly for proton-
ated species. which may be of significance in the tfitium
containment problem. A “dewpoint™ technique appears
feasible for the in-line measurement of hydrolysis
products in coolant cover gas. Both electrical and
optical methods are being tested. For calibration of this
system and other water determinations a special Karl

- Fischer method is being developed. An improved

coulometric titrator for this analysis has been fabncated
and is almost ready for use. ‘

We are now routinely determining OH™ in NaBF,
samples to low ppm levels by measuring the absorbance

of pressed pellets at 3641 cm™", To confirm tentative

calibration factors for this infrared method we are using
an isotopic dilution technique for the measurement of
total hydrogen in NaBF,. Initial results are in excellent
agreement with those of the infrared method; however,
the blanks resulting from the extraction of hydrogen
from the Pyrex equilibration ampule are so high that
 

 

results are subject to question. Additional measure-
ments will be done in quartz ampules.

A novel electroanalytlcal method is based on the
diffusion of hydrogen into a hollow palladium electrode

- when NaBF, melts are electrolyzed at a controlled

potential. The. measurement of the pressure generated
in the electrode is a sensitive measure of protons at ppm

concentrations. The technique offers advantages of
specificity, apphcablhty to in-line analysis, and the

possibility of a measurement of H3/H ratios in the
coolant.

A general voltammetnc study in progress on molten
NaBF, has shown a working voltage span (vs a quasi
reference electrode) from —1.2 V, limited by the
deposition of boron, to +1.8 V where dissolution of the
platinum electrode occurs. Waves for Fe** - Fe?" and
Fe?* to Fe® are observed at approximately —0.2 and

—0.4 V respectively. The Ti** - Ti>* wave occurs at

—0.5 V while the Ti** - Ti® reduction is beyond the
cathodic limit of the melts.
To complete the fundamental study of the electro-

analytical chemistry of nickel in LiF-BeF,-Z1F,, dif--

fusion coefficients (D) of Ni(Il) were measured at
platinum and pyrolytic graphite electrodes. At 500°C
values of D of 1.05 X 107 and 1.07 X 107® cm?/sec
were found by voltammetry and chronopotentiometry
respectively. There was no evidence of alloy formation
when nickel was deposited on and stripped from a
platinum electrode.

* 10. Other Fluoride Researches

Spectrophotometric techniques using the diamond
window cell have been used to determine the ratio of
UF; to total dissolved uranium in molten mixtures of

'LiF and BeF, in contact with graphite. The data

obtained for these mixtures agree well with values
calculated using activity coefficients obtained by other
workers. However, data obtained in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
mixtures by the spectrophotometric method agree
much less well with the calculated values. Attempts in
this study to unambiguously identify the stoichiometry
of the uranium carbide phase in equilibrium with the
UF3-UF4 solute have not been successful.

Similar spectrophotometric techniques have been

- used to define the equilibrium

UFs* = UF,> +F~

in mixtures. of LiF and BeF, as a function of

compositions. It appears that a quantitative ranking of -

fluoride solvents as to their activity of free F~ may be
possible by use of this method.

xvi

A systematic study of the solubility of BFj; in
LiF-BeF, mixtures of varying composition is con-

* tinuing, These measurements, which are also capable of

defining free F~ activity in solvent melts, continue to
show that over the composition range 63 to 85 mole %
LiF the BF; solubility varies nearly linearly with the
thermodynarmc activity of LiF. Enthalpies of solution
and mole entropies of transfer of BF; from the gas to

- solution - at the same concentrations have been evalu-

ated. |
Study of the reactions

2o (s) = Mo(s) + MoFe (@)

and

2 MoF3(5) =3 Mo(9) + MoF4(®),
in which accurate measurements of equilibrium pressure
of the product gases were made, has permitted assess-
ment of the standard free energy changes for these
reactions and evaluation of the free energy of formation
of MoF; and MoF,. The free energy of formation (per
fluoride bond) at 700°C |appears to be —50.5 kcal for
MoF4(g), —55.0 £ 0.3 kcal for MoF,(s), and —49 t1
kcal for MoF4(g).

An improved procedure for synthesis of pure NbF4
was developed and employed during this reporting
period. The vapor products from reaction of Nb,Os
and F, have been determined over the temperature
range 375 to 550°C, and the gaseous products of
reaction of NbFs with Nb, O5 have been studied over
the temperature range 350 to 750°C. '

Continuing the investigation of electrical conductance
and. its relation to glass transition temperatures, mea-
surements were made of the temperature dependence of
conductance in molten and supercooled NaF-BeF,
mixtures containing 65 and 70 mole % beryllium
fluoride. Temperatures ranged from 540 to 329°C,
105° into the supercooled region, while activation
energies varied from 10.5 to 15.2 kcal/mole. Measure-
ment of glass transition temperatures Tg in this system
indicated that the region of bulk-quenched glass forma-
tion extends from 37 (1) to 100 mole % BeF,, Tg
values fallmg from 129 (+2)°C at Xpp, =0.38 to 117°
at XBeF = 0.50 and remaining relatlvely constant
(£2°) to XBeF = 0.90, beyond which the thermal
effect could not be discerned.

The enthalpy of LiBF, was measured from room -
temperature to temperatures above the melting point. -
No evidence for a solid transition was found. The
 

 

(1]

results are compared with those for the other alkali
metal fluoroborates. .

The phase diagram of Li, BeF,-Lil was determined.
The interesting deviations from ideality of both the
Li, BeF,4 liquidus and the Lil liquidus are discussed.

PART 3. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

11. Examination of MSRE Components

Examination of specimens from the mist shield of the
MSRE pump bowl, a rod from the sampler cage in the
pump bowl, and rings from the control rod thimble that
had restricted salt flow showed that all components had
intergranular cracks when strained. Two samples from
in-pile loop 2 were strained, and some shallow cracks
were formed in both samples. Thus, all metal surfaces
exposed to the fuel salt have intergranular cracks,

Fission products on graphite specimens were meas-
ured by two techniques. Significant quantities of
elements from the Hastelloy N and fission products
were observed by both techniques.

12. Graphite Studies

The large range of graphitic materials which have now
been irradiated in HFIR has permitted certain general-
izations as to irradiation behavior. Two classes, so-called
conventional materials and hot-worked materials,
appear to have quite limited resistance to radiation
damage. The other two, apparently binderless graphites
and black-based graphites, appear to offer room for
substantial improvement. Both types of material are
being studied in our own fabrication program. Speci-
mens of the binderless type that we have made have
already been irradiated to 1 X 1022 neutrons/cm? in
the HFIR, and to that level appear to be stable. '

- Increased efforts are being directed at sealing the

graphite against fission product gases. We continue to

have somewhat mixed results with irradiated sealed
samples, and in no case is there an unqualified
successful sample. A major effort is now proceeding on

. microstructural examination of the coated and surface-

impregnated samples to determine the modes of failure.

The thermal conductivities of potentially useful
graphites are now being measured as-a function -of
fluence. An. apparatus to similarly follow radiation-

induced changes in thermal expansion is almost com-

plete. ‘

. The calculation -of strain fields about an interstitial
aggregate has been completed, and electron diffraction
calculations are well under way.

15. Flowsheet Analysis

A study was completed in which the capital and

‘operating costs were determined for a plant that

processes the fuel salt from a 1000-MW(e) MSBR on a

- ten-day cycle. The processing plant is based on the

reference flowsheet that uses fluorination for uranium
removal, reductive extraction for protactinium removal,
and metal transfer for rare-earth removal. The latest
version of the flowsheet incorporates an improved
method for recovering UF¢ from the fluorinator off-gas
and a method for recycling fluorine, hydrogen, and HF
in the plant in order to xmnnmze the quantity of
rad:oactlve waste produced.

In preparing the cost estimate, preliminary designs
were made for all major process equipment items, and
the costs of piping, instrumentation, and certain auxil-
iary items were determined by using appropriate per-
centages of the costs of the fabricated equipment items.
The total direct and indirect costs for the plant are
$20.6 and $15 million respectively. Thus, a total plant
investment of $35.6 million is required. The resulting
net fuel cycle cost (1.12 mills/kWhr) is composed
largely of fixed charges on the processing plant (0.7

mill/kWhr), inventory charges on salt and fissile ma-

terials in the reactor and ??3Pa in the processing plant
(0.42 mill/kWhr), and processing plant operating
charges (0.083 mill/kWhr); credit is taken for excess
fissile material produced (0.089 mill/kWhr). A 0.28
power dependence of processing plant cost on process-
ing rate was estimated; this indicates that a considerable
saving in processing cost could be achieved by using a
processing plant with a larger power generation capacity
than 1000 MW(e). B

Capital and operating costs were calculated for two
methods for obtaining and disposing of hydrogen, HF,
and fluorine in a processing plant. The first method,

‘purchase and disposal of the gases after one cycle

through the process, requires large amounts of F,, Ha,
and HF to be purchased and a large amount of
radioactive waste to be generated. The second method,
collection of the HF and H, and production of
additional H, and F, for recycle by electrolysis of the
HF, requires the purchase of only small amounts of HF
and H, and produces only a small quantity of radio-
active waste. Contributions to the fuel cycle cost for
the once-through case and the recycle case are 0.11 and
0.024 mill/kWhr respectively. The recycle case was
adopted for use in the processing plant.

Calculations were made of the thermal power that

will be produced in an MSBR processing plant by the

decay of noble-metal fission products as a function of
the residence time of these materials in the primary
reactor system and of the fraction of the materials
accompanying the fuel salt to the processing plant. A
heat generation rate of 200 kW will result if 1% of the
noble metals reach the processing plant in the case of a
1-min holdup time, or if 20% reach the processing plant
in the case of a ten-day holdup time. Calculations were
also made of the heat generation rate resulting from
decay of the halogen fission products in the processing
plant as a function of the halogen and the noble-metal
removal times. The heat generation rate will be 210 kW

- for.a halogen removal time of ten days if the noble-

metal holdup time in the reactor is 0.1 day.

Calculations were made of the long-term hazard of
high-level radioactive wastes produced in the three
nuclear fission fuel cycles under development. Several
aspects of the MSBR fuel cycle related to waste disposal
problems are considered.

A survey was made of published data on the
availability of and future demand for natural resources
required for an MSBR power economy. Consideration is
given to the possible impact on the MSBR concept of
the depletion of world reserves of natural resources
required by molten-salt breeder reactors.

16. Proceésing Chemistry

Measurements were made of the equilibrium distri-
bution of lithium and bismuth between liquid lithium-
bismuth alloys and molten LiCl, and of the mutual
solubilities of thorium and selected rare earths in liquid
bismuth. These studies relate to the development of the
metal transfer process for removing rare earths from
MSBR fuel salt.

Protactinium pentoxide was selectively precipitated

- from LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) that contained

up to 0.25 mole % UF, by sparging the salt with
HF-H, O-Ar gas mixtures at 600°C. The equilibrium
quotient for the reaction PaFs(d) + %4H,0(g) =%
Pa, O4(s) + SHF(g) was determined to be about 3 at
600°C. The results of this work are consistent with
earlier indications that Pa, 05 can be precipitated from
MSBR fuel salt as a pure, or nearly pure, solid phase.
Studies relating to the chemistry of fuel recon-
stitution were initiated. Gaseous UF, reacted quantita-
tively with UF, dissolved in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %) at 600°C according to the equation
UF¢(g) + UF,(d) = 2UFs(d). The dissolved UF; ap-
peared to be stable in both gold and graphite equip-
ment. : ‘

17. Engineering Development of Processing -
- - QOperations ’

Additional information on the behavior of lithium
was obtained during metal transfer experiment MTE-2.
During this experiment, the lithium concentration in
the Li-Bi solution used to extract rare earths from the

| lithium chloride decreased from an initial value of 0.35

to 0.18 mole fraction after about 570 liters of LiCl had
been contacted with the Li-Bi solution. The decrease in

lithium concentration was shown to be consistent with -

recently obtained data on the concentration of lithium
in LiCl that is in equilibrium with Li-Bi solutions.

A new.experiment (MTE-2B) is presently under way
to study further the transfer of lithium from a Li-Bi
solution containing lithium at the concentration pro-
posed for extracting trivalent rare earths from LiCl (i.e.,
5 at. %). This experiment is designed in a manner such
that data on lithium transfer can be obtained by several
independent methods. The data obtained thus far show

-a decrease in the lithium concentration in the Li-Bi

solution that represents an equilibrium lithium concen-
tration in the LiCl of less than 0.3 wt ppm. Since the
corresponding quantity of reductant did not transfer to
the Th-Bi solution in the experiment, it is believed that
part of the decrease is due to a slight loss of reductant
from both the Li-Bi and the Th-Bi solutions as the
result of the reaction of reductant with impurities in
the system. It is believed that further operation of the
experiment will show lower equilibrium lithium concen-
trations in the LiCl. o
The design of the third engineering experiment for
development of the metal transfer process has been
completed, and most of the equipment has been
fabricated. The main process vessels are now being
installed. This experiment will use flow rates that are

1% of the estimated rates required for processing a

1000-MW(e) reactor. Mechanical agitators will be used
to promote efficient contacting of the salt and bismuth

- phases. Tests are under way to evaluate an agitator drive

unit and nonlubricated shaft seal assembly that is
water-cooled and buffered with inert gas. Although
some leakage of gas around the seal has been observed,
it appears that the seal will be satisfactory for use with
experiment MTE-3. No evidence of stable emulsions of
bismuth in salt that had been mechanically agitated was
found. The hydrodynamic performance of mechanically
agitated salt-metal contactors was investigated using
mercury and water to simulate bismuth and molten salt
in order to determine favorable operating conditions.
Tests of several sizes of contactors with differing

- agitator arrangements established that the common

factor that limits the agitator speed is entrainment of
water in the mercury circulating between the two halves
of the contactor. Consideration of the data on limiting

‘agitator speed, along with data from the literature on

mass transfer in this type of contactor, suggests that

~ optimum mass transfer performance will be obtained by

the use of the largest possible agitator diameter. This
will also result in the lowest possible agitator speed,
which should facilitate maintaining a gastight seal on
the agitator shaft.

We have begun mass transfer experiments in which
the rate of transfer of zirconium from molten salt to
bismuth is measured by adding ®?ZrQ, tracer to the

 

 
 

 

 

salt phase prior to contacting the salt with bismuth
containing reductant in a -0.82-in.-diam, 24-in.long
packed column. Three of the experiments resulted in
the transfer of 15 to 30% of the ® 7 Zr present in the salt
and gave measured HTU values that ranged from 1 to 4
ft; the lower values were obtained from data in which
we have the most confidence. These data indicate that
packed column contactors will be satisfactory for use in
MSBR processing systems. We believe that much of the
scatter observed in the mass transfer data obtained thus
far is caused by small amounts of air entering the
flowing stream samplers in which samples of salt and
bismuth are obtained. An improved sampling technique

- will be used in future experiments.

We have been investigating high-frequency induction
heating for possible use as a corrosion-resistant heat
source (in the molten salt) in an experiment to
demonstrate protection against corrosion in a con-
tinuous fluorinator by use of a frozen wall. Heat
generation rates were measured with four induction coil

XX

Fabrication and installation of equipment for a
single-stage experiment to study the precipitation of
UO,-ThO, solid solutions from molten fluoride salts
have been completed. The major equipment. items
performed satisfactorily in the two experiments carried
out to date. In the first experiment, a gas stream
containing 15% water—85% argon was fed to the
precipitator vessel at the rate of 0.5 scfh for a period of
4 hr with the salt at 600°C. Analyses of samples
indicate that 17% of the uranium initially present in the
salt ' was precipitated during the run and that a water

" utilization of about 25% was obtained. In the second

experiment, the temperature of the salt and the
composition of the inlet gas were the same as in the
first experiment. The salt was contacted with the gas at
the rate of 0.5 scfh for 9 hr; after which the gas flow

rate was increased to 1.5 scfh for an additional 5 hr. .

The total precipitation time (14 hr) extended over a

- period of about ten days. During this time the run was

designs in a system that used 31 wt % HNO; as a

substitute for molten salt. The measured heat genera-
tion rates were used to compute correction factors for
use in equations for calculating heat induced in similar,
but idealized, geometries. These equations were then
used to design equipment for a molten-salt induction
heating experiment for verifying the design equations,
and for testing the operation of the proposed heating
method and the means for introducing the power leads
into the fluorinator. The test vessel, which is 5 ft tall
and has a diameter of about 6.5 in., is a short version of
the proposed frozen-wall fluorinator.

A mathematical analysis for predicting continuous
fluorinator performance was completed, and calcula-
tions were made for operating conditions of interest for
MSBR processing. The model assumed that the removal
of uranium from the salt is first-order with respect to
the uranium concentration in the salt, and took into
account the effects of axial -dispersion resulting from
the rising gas bubbles. Values for the dispersion
coefficient were obtained from recently developed
correlations on axial dispersion in open columns during
the countercurrent flow of air and aqueous solutions,
and the fluorination reaction rate constant was evalu-
ated using previously obtained data on the performance
of a l-in.-diam continuous fluorinator. The predicted
fluorinator heights required for removal of 95 and 99%
of the uranium from MSBR fuel salt on a ten-day cycle
are 10.2 ft (for a 6-in. diameter) and 17.8 ft (for an
8-in. diameter) respectively. The calculated results are
encouraging since they indicate that the desired ura-
nium removal efficiencies can be obtained with single

open columns of moderate height.

interrupted on several occasions for minor equipment
modifications. Analyses of samples and measurements
of HF evolution throughout the second experiment
indicate that more than 50% of the uranium was

. precipitated.

The detailed designs of the extraction column and the -

salt and bismuth head pots were completed for the
molybdenum reductive exiraction facility, and fabri-
cation of these items was started. Conceptual design
sketches for the equipment supports in the containment
vessel and preliminary drawings for the molybdenum
piping arrangement inside the containment vessel were
completed. Further work on these drawings will be
deferred until the piping can be analyzed for thermal
expansion stresses and the full-scale mockup can be
completed to investigate fabrication and field assembly
problems. '

An eddy-current type of detector is being developed
to allow detection and control of the bismuth-salt
interface in salt-metal extraction columns or mechani-
cally agitated salt-metal contactors. The probe consists
of a ceramic form on which bifilar primary and
secondary coils are wound. A high-frequency alter-
nating current is passed through the primary coil, and a
current that is dependent on the conductivities of
materials adjacent to the primary and secondary coils is
induced in the secondary coil. Initial tests showed that
the probe was quite sensitive to drift in the electronic
circuit, to minor variations in line voltage, and to
changes in temperature of the electronic components.
To circumvent this problem, an improved electronic
circuit that is relatively insensitive to these effects was
devised. Calculations for predicting the performance of
interface detectors were made based on measurements
 

 

of either the magnitude of the current induced in the
secondary coil or the shift in phase between the
primary and secondary voltages. Optimum operating
conditions were defined, and a prototype probe for use
in the molybdenum reductive extraction column was
fabricated. Tests carried out at room temperature
confirmed the predicted performance of the probe.
Equipment has been installed for final testing of the
probe at 600°C with molten bismuth.

18. Continuous Salt Purification

Contamination was found to be the reason for the
occasional high iron concentrations reported for salt

samples from previous experiments. This contamination
apparently occurred during removal of salt from the
nickel samplers. To eliminate this problem, the sampler
design was modified, and copper was used as the
material of construction. Five iron fluoride reduction
runs were made with iron concentrations of about 700
to 900 ppm. The gas flow rates used in these runs were
only about 20% of previous values since the packed
column had become partially restricted. After the runs
had been completed, the column was removed and cut
into sections for examination. A heavy deposit of nickel
and a near-uniform deposit of iron were noted on the
packing. A column of slightly modified design has been
fabricated and installed.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

Part 1. MSBR DeSign and Development

W. R. Grimes

The design and development program has the purpbse

'_of describing the characteristics and estimating the

performance of future molten-salt reactors, defining the
major problems that must be solved in order to build
them, and designing and developing solutions to prob-
lems of the reactor plant. To this end we have published
a conceptual design for a 1000-MW(e) plant and have

contracted with -an industrial group organized by -

Ebasco Services Incorporated to do a conceptual design
of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR plant. This design study is to
use the ORNL design for background and to incor-
porate the experience and the viewpoint of industry.
One could not, however, propose to build a
1000-MW(e) plant in the near future, so we are doing
studies of plants that could be built as the next step in
the development of large MSBRs. One such plant is the
Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE). The MSBE is
intended to provide a test of the major features, the

. most severe operating conditions, and the fuel reproc-

essing of an advanced MSBR in a small reactor with a
power of about 150 MW(t).. An alternative is the

Molten-Salt Demonstration Reactor (MSDR), which

would be a 150- to 300-MW(e) plant based largely on
the technology demonstrated in the Molten-Salt Reac-
tor Experiment, would incorporate a minimum of fuel

reprocessing, and would have the purpose of demon- .

strating the practicality of a molten-salt reactor for use
by a utility to produce electricity. In addition to these
general studies of plant designs, the design activity
includes studies of the use of various fuel cycles in

P. N. Haubenreich

molten-salt reactors and assessment of the safety of
molten-salt reactor plants. The fuel cycle studies have
indicated that plutonium from light-water reactors has
an economic advantage over highly enriched 23°U in
fueling molten-salt reactors. Some studies related to
safety are in progress preliminary to a comprehensive
review of safety based on the design of the 1000-MW(e)
MSBR.

The design studies serve to define the needs for new
or improved equipment, systems, and data for use in
the design of future molten-salt reactors. The purpose
of the reactor development program is to satisfy some
of those needs. Presently the effort is concerned largely.
with providing solutions to the major problems of the
secondary system and of removing xenon and handling
the radioactive off-gases from the primary system. Work
is well along on the design of the one loop facility for
testing the features and models of equipment for the
gaseous fission product removal and off-gas systems and
for making special studies of the chemistry of the fuel
salt. Design is nearing completion and construction is in
progress on a second loop facility for studies of

- equipment and processes and of the chemistry of

sodium fluoroborate for the secondary system of a
molten-salt reactor. The steam generator is a major item
of equipment for which the basic design data are few
and the potential problems are many. A program
involving industrial participation is being undertaken to
provide the technology for designing and building
reliable steam generators for molten-salt reactors.

-1.1.1 AGeneral

Design and evaluation studies of a 300-MW(e) mol-
ten-salt demonstration reactor (MSDR) were continued.
This reactor would be a first-of-a-kind prototype to
demonstrate the feasibility and to delineate the prob-

lems of construction and operation of a large-scale

molten-salt reactor power station. Insofar as possible,
all aspects of the MSDR design study have been made
conservatively and in such a manner as to require
development of little new technology. The 26-ft-diam
reactor has a sufficiently low power density (~10
W/cm?) for the radiation damage to the core moderator
to be low enough for the graphite to last the 30-year
design life of the plant. The MSDR reactor outlet
temperature was taken as 1250°F to increase the
margin of safety with regard to radiation damage to
Hastelloy N, although it has not been established that
this is required. This reduction in temperature, together
with use of 900°F steam rather than the 1000°F steam
proposed for the MSBR, will allow the nitrate-nitrite
salt in the tertiary system to operate at a - lower

temperature, although, here again, these are not neces-

 sarily requirements for an MSBR. It was also decided to

operate the steam system at 2400 psia (with reheat to
900°F), again in line with using conservative design
conditions for the MSDR. The fuel-salt chemical treat-
ment need not consist of more than fluorination, which
is an already well-developed process. Periodic discard of
the LiF-BeF, carrier salt will be used to limit accumula-
tion of fission products. The built-in safety features of

‘the MSDR give it a “walk-away” capability — that is,

the decay heat removal system will operate even with
complete loss of station power.

The reactor vessel, the reactor containment and plant
building layouts, the fuel-salt storage tanks, and prelimi-
nary primary and secondary heat exchanger design
concepts have all been described previously.'™ The
design properties of the fuel salt and the secondary and
tertiary heat transport salts have been reported.®
During the past report period, however, the configura-
tion of the core graphite was changed, and the method
of handling the off-gas and continuously pumping salt
back from the drain tank was revised. The drain tank
cooling system, along with the drain tank valve and salt
catch pan arrangement, was also studied and probably
received the major portion of the MSDR 'design effort
during the past period.

1.1.2 Reactor Core

As described previously,? the MSDR reactor vessel is
made of Hastelloy N and is about 26 ft in diameter by
35 ft high, including the fuel-salt inlet and outlet
plenums at top and bottom. The reactor is graphite
moderated and reflected, with the fuel salt circulating
upward through the core at a velocity of about 1.5 fps.
At this low velocity it will not be necessary to seal the
graphite against penetration of xenon in order to
maintain the !35Xe poison fraction below 0.003. Use
of the unsealed graphite will greatly simplify the
production of graphite and will lower the fabrication
costs. . . ,

The configuration of the core graphite has been
changed from that previously reported. Slabs of graph-
ite 14%4 X 9% in. X about 21 ft long are now spaced

vertically in the core as indicated in the plan view, Fig.
1.1, and in more detail in Fig. 1.2. This configuration is
similar to one proposed by the Ebasco Services group in

the current industrial study of an MSBR. The methods

of assembling the core at bottom and top are shown in
elevation in Fig. 1.3. If the slabs are not available in
21-ft lengths, they can be made up of shorter lengths
joined together. Because of the relatively low power
density in the MSDR, fuel salt trapped in small cracks
at the joints would not cause excessive temperatures.
Graphite vertical posts about 2% ¢ X 2% ¢ in. in cross
section and formed as shown in Fig. 1.2 are used to
maintain the configuration of the graphite slabs within
the core, while at the same time accommodating
thermal and radiation-induced dimensional changes.
The lower 6-in. length of each post is turned to 1% in.

grid plate, and an upper l-in. length has a diameter of

about % in. to fit into a corresponding hole in the

upper orifice plate, as shown in Fig. 1.3. The posts and

stabs thus form a cell about 11% X 11% in. Dowels
provide interstitial spaces for maintaining the upward
flow of salt at the design velocity and establish the
salt-to-graphite ratio necessary for nuclear performance.
Retainer plates at the top of the posts tie the entire
core together, as indicated in Fig. 1.3. Individual orifice
plates are placed over each cell under the retainer plates
to hold down the slabs as well as to provide the
necessary orificing of the flow. :
The slabs adopted for the MSDR core graphite ar

easier to fabricate than the prisms used in the MSBR
and earlier MSDR designs. The slab shape will also allow
the graphite to operate at lower temperatures and at
lower stress levels. The graphite temperature at the
center of the core has been estimated to be 1190°F.

1.1:3 MSDR Off-Gas and Salt Pump-Back System

The primary fuhction of the fuel-salt drain tank is to

store the salt safely when it is drained from the reactor

primary system, but the tank serves some secondary

- purposes as well. The revised MSDR system no longer

depends upon the drain tank as an expansion volume
for the salt since the salt-circulation pump bowls are
large enough for this purpose. The drain tank continues
to serve as a holdup and decay volume for the gases

stripped from the circulating fuel salt in normal

operation. The drain tank is well suited for this purpose
because its heat removal system can handle the approxi-
mately 6 MW(t) of heat generated in the gas.

In the MSDR fuel-salt circulation system about 10%
of the pump outlet flow is bypassed through a gas

separation loop. The salt first passes through a gas °

separator in this loop, where about 2 cfm (STP) of gas,
with 1 to 2 ft3 of salt entrained in it, is removed.
Several schemes were studied for separating the en-
trained salt from the gas, such as spray towers, cyclone
separators, etc. The very high heat release from the
radioactive. gas requires large heat removal systems,
however, and the indeterminate manner in which the
solid daughters of the gaseous fission products could
coat metal surfaces makes it necessary to provide ample
surface for accumulation of the particles. After some
study it was decided to use the drain tank itself to
separate the salt from the gas, the large volume of the
tank permitting simple separation by gravity. The large

surface of the cooling thimbles in the drain tank would

provide sufficient area for the solid daughters of the
_noble gases to coalesce.

Each of the gas separators in the three salt-circulation
loops in the MSDR discharges the gas-salt mixture into
the drain tank through a 1%-in. line. The temperature
of the pipe is limited to about 1325°F by the cooling
action of the salt entrained in the gas. The line -is
provided with a syphon break to prevent drainage of

the main salt-circulation loops in the event of a pump -

failure. The syphon break is in the form of a loop of
piping that rises above the level of the liquid in the
pump bowl and is equipped with a venturi, the throat
of which communicates via a ' -in. pipe to the gas
space above the liquid in the pump bowl. During

normal operation, gas from the bowl is drawn into the
venturi and discharged along with the gas-salt mixture
from the gas separator into the drain tank. The total
flow of salt into the drain tank via the gas separators is
estimated to be about 40 gpm. Two small jet pumps in
the tank return the salt to the primary loops. The
operation of the system is described below, and.the
design of the jet pumps is described in Sect. 3.7.3.

- An elevation of the jet pumps mounted in the center
of the drain tank is shown in Fig. 1.4. The assembly is

" installed so that it can be withdrawn from the tank if
- repair or replacement becomes necessary. One of the jet
- pumps takes its suction from the bottom of a vertical

6-in. pipe at the center line of the vessel. The suction

head on the pump varies from about +15 to —5 ft as the
level of salt in the pipe changes from full to empty.
Since the discharge from the jet is proportional to the
suction head, varying from zero at the lowest level to
about 50 ppm when the sump is full, the jet cannot
pump gas from the tank when it is empty of salt. The

‘jet pump uses salt as its working fluid, the salt being

taken from a manifold connecting the three salt-circula-
tion pumps. Each manifold connection has a ball check
valve to prevent backflow in the event of a pump
shutdown.

As is also shown in Fig. 1.4, a second jet pump is
provided in the assembly to keep the 6-in. central pipe
supplied with salt from a small sump in the bottom of
the drain tank. This jet has a capacity of about 50 gpm,
keeps the liquid pumped out of the drain tank, and,
when the tank is empty, may recirculate gas within the
tank. As described above, however, the system is
designed to prevent pumping of gas from the tank back
to the pump bowls. It provides automatic flow control
regardless of the number of primary pumps that are

" running.
 

 

 

A third jet pump is provided in the assembly to fill
the primary system with salt from the drain tank and to
transfer salt from the drain tank into the fuel-salt
storage tank. The working fluid for this third jet pump
is provided by a separate small pump located in the
chemical processing cell.

1.1.4 Drain Tank Cooling System

The drain tank cooling system described in a previous
report? has not been changed in principle, but the

thimbles have been rearranged. The change was made to

facilitate the manifolding of the pipes which carry the
cooling NaK into and out of the thimbles. As shown in
the plan view of the top of the drain tank, Fig. 1.5,
there are now 60 sets of thimbles, each containing 6
thimbles arranged symmetrically in a circular pattern.
Figure 1.6 is an elevation of the drain tank. One of the
manifolds is shown in cross section in Fig. 1.6 to
indicate that it would be possible to remove and replace
manifolds if maintenance were required. By manifold-
ing only six thimbles in a circular pattern, the measures

required to accommodate thermal expansion are made
much less stringent. Use of 60 different circuits limits
the amount of NaK that could leak from one circuit to
about 16 ft3.

In another change in the drain tank system from that
described previously,> the one large water tank, to
which the NaK circuits reject their heat by radiation,
has been replaced by three smaller tanks. The NaK
circuits are manifolded in such a manner as to divide
the heat removal capability between the three water
pools, and with any two water tanks in operation the
temperature in the drain tank could be limited to about
1400°F. This arrangement is considered to be more
reliable than the previous one in which a single leak
could result in total loss of water.

Studies have been initiated on the effects of seismic
disturbances on the drain tank and its cooling system.
Preliminary calculations indicate that the individual
thimbles in the drain tank would have a natural
frequency of about 1.5 cps when each thimble is
considered to be a 20-ft-long cantilevered member.

to 4 cps, means for changing the natural frequency of
the thimbles have been given preliminary study. All
“thimbles in each group of six would be tied or banded
together at 3-ft intervals along the length. In addition,
all 60 groups of thimbles would be tied together at the
bottom by “U”’-bolt-type clevises. These ties would
restrict radial movement to make the entire array act as
a unit if seismically disturbed, but would permit
longitudinal motion resulting from differential thermal
expansion. The method of joining the units together is
indicated in Fig. 1.6.

1.1.5 Drain Valve Cell

The cell provided for the freeze valve in the fuel-salt
drain line leading from the bottom of the reactor to the
drain tank has been eliminated in the revised MSDR
design, and the valve is now located in the drain tank
cell. This arrangement facilitates replacement of drain
lines and associated piping should maintenance be
required. The drain lines now pass through penetrations
in the side of the reactor cell, and the valves in these
lines are accessible through a separate hatch in the cover
of the drain tank cell.

1.1.6 Drain Cell Catch Pan

A catch pan is provided in the bottom of the reactor

cell to collect any accidental spillage of salt and direct it

into the drain tank through frangible disk valves. An
additional catch basin has now been added near the top
of the drain tank in the drain tank cell to catch any
leakage from the primary salt lines and direct it into the
drain tank. This catch basin extends from the periphery
of the drain tank at the top to the walls of the drain
tank cell. As presently conceived, a 6-in.-diam hole in
the basin communicates with the drain tank, the
opening being normally sealed by an inverted cap with
its lip in a trepanned groove that is filled with NaF.
Since the melting temperature of the NaF is about
1600°F, the opening would remain sealed unless

flooded with fuel salt, which would dissolve the NaF

and allow the fuel salt to run into the interior chamber
to float a graphlte plug and then flow into the drain
- tank.

With catch basins prov1ded for the reactor cell
equipment, for the salt piping in the drain tank cell, and
for the drain tank vessel itself (in the form of a cooled
*“crucible” surrounding the tank), we believe that the
likelihood of an accident in which molten salt collects
“in a pool in the bottom of the containment vessel
without sufficient cooling is very remote indeed.

1.2 SOME CONSEQUENCES OF TUBING FAILURE
IN THE MSBR HEAT EXCHANGER

R. P. Wichner

A study was made of the consequences of the mixing
of fuel and coolant salts as a result of various modes of
failure of tubing in the primary heat exchangers in the
MSBR reference design. Four specific cases were ex-
amined: (1) double-ended failure near the fuel-salt
outlet; (2) double-ended failure near the fuel-salt inlet;
(3) small coolant-salt leak into the primary system; (4)
small fuel-salt leak into the secondary system. The
study is, in many places, speculative both because of
the preliminary status of the design and the lack of
adequate physicochemical data on mixing of fuel and
coolant salts. However unpleasant some of the con-
sequences of tubing failure may be, no way of
generating either a nuclear excursion or a rupture in the
primary or secondary loop piping is foreseen.

Some additional tentative conclusions of the study
are:

(1) For a case 1 failure (double-ended tubing failure
near the fuel-salt outlet of the heat exchanger), 3.5
Ib/sec of coolant salt initially leaks into the primary
system. The boron poison in this leakage stream is
sufficiently large such that a low-power-level trip, if
present, is actuated essentially immediately on arrival of
the contaminated fuel at the lower axial blanket in the
reactor vessel. The worth of the boron poison is
estimated to be 0.18% &k/k per pound of coolant salt
distributed uniformly over zones I and II of the reactor
core,

(2) Additionally, for a case 1 tublng fallure 0.96
Ib/sec of fuel salt initially leaks into the secondary loop,
However, the bulk of the fuel-salt leakage into the
secondary system, and the coolant-salt leakage into the
primary system, occurs after reactor shutdown. A total

- of approximately 300 Ib of fuel salt leaks into the

secondary system, all but 4 Ib occurring in the 20-min
interval in which the freeze valves are thawing and the

‘loops are draining. If the cover-gas pressure in the

secondary loop were set about 3 psi higher than the 10
psig in the present design, there would be no fuel-salt
leakage in this interval, and the total loss of fuel salt to
the secondary system would be approxlmately 4 Iv for
this case. _
-(3) It is judged that the fuel salt whlch leaks into the
shell of the heat exchanger after shutdown will initially
be in the form of immiscible droplets that subsequently
freeze and settle onto the lower tube sheet. The
maximum temperature caused by this localized heat

 

 
 

 

 

 

source is estimated to be approximately equal to that
reached in central portions of the heat exchanger due to
noble-metal heating, or approximately 1660°F when
coolant salt remains in the shell.

(4) If rapid evolution of BF; from the coolant-salt
stream leaking into the primary system is assumed, a
maximum pressure rise of 74 psi in the primary loop is
estimated for a case 1 type of failure. It is judged that
rapid evolution of BF; will not damage the primary
pumps if shutdown procedures are initiated most

promptly — as would be the case if a low-power-level

10

trip is incorporated into the automatic protection

system.

(5) Since there is no provision for draining coolant
salt from the shell of the heat exchanger, ultimately,
following a case 1 failure, the entire contents of the
shell — 444 ft* (52,000 1b) — leaks into the primary
drain tank through the failed tube. The main con-
sequence of this large addition of coolant salt to the
fuel salt is judged to be the evolution of large volumes
of BF; in the primary system with possible deleterious
effects to the charcoal beds. No means for seriously
elevating the -fuel liquidus temperature is envisioned
even by the addition of two heat exchanger shells worth
of coolant.

(6) A case 2 failure (double-ended tubing failure near
the fuel-salt inlet) initially allows 7.4 1b/sec of fuel salt
to leak into the secondary system. If a delayed neutron
detector on the secondary system is an integral part of
the reactor protection system and a signal from it stops
the pumps, then a total of approximately 60 Ib of fuel
salt is lost. It is judged that this fuel salt will form

immiscible droplets that freeze and settle to the lower

tube sheet.
(7) For case 3 it was assumed that a plnhole in the

tubing allows 3 X 10™* lb/sec of coolant salt into the

primary system, at which rate approximately 2.6 hr are
required to add —0.3% &k/k — the total worth of the
control rods. A control rod location alarm is set off at

‘some point during the gradual inward drift of the

control rods. If no operator action is taken, the
low-temperature trip on the core outlet initiates shut-
down -approximately 26 min after full insertion. Thus,
the duration of this incident is 2 to 3 hr; however, even
a fairly insensitive BF; detector on the off-gas flow, if
one ‘were available, would detect the presence of the
leak within minutes.

(8) In case 4 a 3 X 107 Ib/sec leakage rate of fuel

salt into the secondary system is assumed to occur -

through a 2-mil-diam pinhole in the tubing near the fuel
inlet. A leak rate of this magnitude would cause a flux
of delayed neutrons of approximately 70 neutrons

cm”“ sec

2 sec™ at a detector positioned near the outlet of

the heat exchanger. This is seven ‘times the lower
detection limit of ion chambers, and hence an auto-
matic shutdown would be initiated a few seconds after
the inception of the leak, if a delayed neutron detector
were so deployed.

1.3 SIDE-STREAM PROCESSING OF THE MSER
" PRIMARY FLOW FOR XENON-
AND/OR IODINE REMOVAL

R.P. Wichner -

A state-of the-art report presently in preparation, on
means for dealing with the ! Xe poison in molten-sait
reactors will contain an evaluation of the side-stream
processing approaches to the problem. These processes

differ basically from the present reference design .

method in that a single bypass flow of fuel salt is
processed in a gas-stripping device for removal of xenon
and/or iodine. Thus, the four gas-separator loops are

eliminated as are the circulating bubbles; however, use
of the latter is not precluded in side-stream processing

concepts. 7

There are a number of strong incentives for side-
_stream removal methods, especially for iodine or
combmed xenon and iodine removal schemes. Present
evidence indicates that the “effective solubility” of
iodine in fuel salt is quite high,* so that some difficulty
may be expected in efficiently removing it in a stripping
device. This inconvenience is more than compensated

for by the corollary that diffusion rates of HI into the

graphite will be low. Hence, the sole significant com-
petitive removal rate is the slow decay to xenon, and
consequently only very small bypass flow rates are
required. If an efficient iodine stripper is available,
bypass flows as low as 225 gpm will capture almost all
the iodine before it decays to xenon, and if no other
control method is applied, the xenon poison fraction
will be the 0.001 resulting from the direct fission yle]d
of 135Xe.

A particularly attractive sltuatlon is attamed by a

combined jodine plus xenon stripper. If one assumes a
bypass flow through such a device of 10% of the
primary flow — equal to the bypass flow rate in the

 

4. The “effective solubility” is defined by Pyy = [17]/kesr
and can be shown to be a function of the proton concentration.
The ehenlistry of iodine stripping will be further discussed in
the next semiannuat report and in the forthcoming state-of-the-
art report on !3%Xe control procedures. Experiments by Baes
and Bamberger are the basis of the iodine-stripping remarks.
 

 

 

 

reference design through the four gas separators — and
that such a device, designed primarily for xenon
removal, does so with high efficiency, then if addition-
ally only 10% of the iodine throughput were simultane-
ously removed, a '35Xe poison fraction of ~0.003
would be attained without employing impervious coat-
ings on the graphite. Present understanding of the
mechanism of iodine stripping indicates that some HI
(and TI) will be removed in a xenon stripper employing
inert helium stripping gas due to the presence of
protons and tritons in the fuel. The degree of HI
removal may be enhanced by adding some HF to the
stripping gas.

1.4 MSBE DESIGN
M.L Lundin J. R. McWherter

1.4.1 Reactor Core Power
and Neutron Flux Distribution

J. R. McWherter J. P. Sanders

The design studies reported previously® were contin-
ued with the reactor core concept remaining essentially
unchanged. The core is a cylinder 45 in. in diameter and
57 in. high formed of graphite bars and contains 15 vol %
fuel salt. The core is in a 90-in.-ID spherical reactor vessel.

The space between the vessel wall and the core is filled’

with fuel salt. The reactor thermal power is 150 MW.

A computer subroutine, entitled HOLES, was used to .

11

analytical and numerical solutions are indeterminate at
these points. The subroutine HOLES plots the contour
lines by making a linear mterpolatlon along the gnd
lines between the given values.

Because of the relatively gross spacing of lattice
points, the power density and the neutron flux are not
represented accurately in the region near the boundary
between the core and the blanket. The neutron flux is
assumed to vary linearly between the lattice points in
the core and in the blanket nearest the boundary, and
the power density varies across the boundary with the
change in flux and fuel-salt fraction. The approximation
of spherical geometry by stacked cylindrical disks,
which is used in CITATION, becomes evident in the
perturbations in the contour lines for power densities
near the vessel wall. Because of the symmetry of the
core, all the contour lines should have slopes which are
perpendicular to the axes. Again, the large difference in
the values of the coordinates of the lattice points
obscured this characteristic at the higher power levels
where the change in values for ad]acent lattice points
was the greatest.

The values shown for power density in Fig. 1.7 are
per unit volume of the core and moderator. Discon-
tinuities occur at a radial position of 57 cm (22% in.)
and at an axial position of 72 cm (28% in.) above the
midplane; at these points, the salt fraction changes from

‘0.15 to 1.00 in the radial direction and to 0.70 in the

produce contour plots of the power distribution and .

neutron fluxes in the MSBE core; the calculated power
and neutron flux distributions were produced by a
finite-element, multigroup reactor physics code called
CITATION. Data from CITATION case 41 (the 45-in.-
diam, 57-in.-high cylindrical core with a 0.15 salt
fraction located in a 90-in.-diam spherical vessel) was
scaled to a reactor power of 150 MW as input for
HOLES.

Two of the plots produced are shown in Flgs 1.7 and :

1.8. Several characteristics of the plots are dependent
upon the features of the CITATION code. The CITA-
TION code indicates the value of the power density and
neutron flux for a limited number of points in the axial
and radial directions, and the code approximates a

axial direction.

This same subroutine was used to draw contour plots
of several combinations of the nine energy groups of
neutrons in the MSBE. To get the graphite damage flux,
data from the first (highest) group were combined with
85% of the data for the second energy group. This gives
the estimated flux above 50 keV and was used as input

for the plot given in Fig. 1.8.

the reference desién." The main difficulty in removing

~élements individually is holding the elements remaining
_ in the core in their normal upright positions when some

have been removed. A permanent fixture or a re-
movable jig will have to be designed to accomplish this.
Layout studies of the MSBE primary heat exchanger

were made with the major consideration being given to

maintenance. In one approach proposed, a tube can be
plugged in place or the entire heat exchanger can be
removed from the reactor cell for repair or replacement.
The heat exchanger is assumed to be a U-shaped unit
mounted horizontally. Horizontal mounting of a U-
shaped unit is desirable to permit draining of the fuel
and coolant salts and to minimize the possibility of
accumulating crud in the heat exchanger tubes.

‘In the proposal, the unit is mounted on trunnions to
facilitate removal from the cell for repair or replace-
ment, in the unlikely event this is required. A remote
pipe-cutting device is lowered into the cell through an
opening in the shielding above the equipment to cut the
pipes connecting the exchanger to the salt systems. The
exchanger is then rotated on the trunnions to a vertical
position and lifted out of the reactor cell through an
opening at the top of the cell. This procedure is
reversed when installing a heat exchanger with the
welding of this unit to the connecting pipes being done
remotely. Pipe springback and alignment are major
considerations in the last step. Present remote welding
technology' ! indicates that the two ends of a pipe to
be welded must be aligned within % ¢ in.

Task I, the selection of a reference conceptual design,
is essentially complete. Two progress reports were
submitted.

The overall core size is the same as that in the ORNL
reference concept,® but a slab-type graphite element is
proposed. Several of these slabs are held at the top and
bottom in a hexagonal array as shown in Figs. 1.10 and
1.11. This assembly is sufficiently small to be handled
and replaced as a unit. One hundred fifty-seven such
arrays are required for the core. A 2-ft-thick radial
graphite reflector surrounds the core. A boron-contain-
ing thermal shield separates the reflector from the
pressure vessel to reduce the radiation damage resulting
from transmutation of boron in the Hastelloy N.

2.1.1 HILTR Lattice Experiments
G.L.Ragan O. L. Smith

The experimental program, described in considerable
detail in the preceding semiannual report,! has now
been completed at the Battelle Northwest Labora-
tories.2 Measurements were made at four operating
temperatures: 20, 300, 627, and 1000°C. At each
temperature BNWL measured the basic lattice multipli-
cation factor k. and the reactivity worths of some 24
perturbations at the center of a lattice that was
neutronically similar to a typical MSBR design pro-
posal. These perturbations were chosen to reveal certain
reactor physics characteristics of such a lattice and to
provide experimental results against which we can test
our calculational techniques.

The measured multiplication factor k.. varied from
1.029 at 20°C to 1.004 at 1000°C. Our only precalcu-
lated value (1.020 at 627°C) was considerably higher
than the measured value (1.007 at 627°C), but the
significance of the discrepancy cannot be assessed until

perform multigroup one-dimensional neutronics calcu-
lations with the S, transport method. The standard
version of XSDRN used in the precalculations is limited
to one degree of heterogeneity per region, for example,
homogeneous ‘fuel rods disposed in a lattice arrange-
ment. We have now modified the GAM-II part of the
XSDRN code so that it obtains group cross sections in

the resonance energy range for doubly heterogeneous

regions; for example, the self-shielding effects of ThO,
particles within the above-mentioned fuel rods may be
included. _ _

In its original form,* GAM-II yields the lump (region
0) collision density per unit energy Fo(£). From this,
one readily obtains the lump flux per unit lethargy,

These results are made possible by eliminating explicit
reference to the external (region 1) moderator by (1)
assuming that region 1 sources are well approximated
by using the asymptotic flux and the narrow resonance

(NR) approximation for them, (2) using the flat-source

invoking the reciprocity theorem. With the same: as-

to be simply the asymptotic flux, nor is the equation
given limited to small fractional lump volumes. As
illustrated by examples given below, the equation has
been tested rather extensively, with good results.

The revised GAM-II treatment in the XSDRN code
treats a doubly heterogeneous problem by assuming

17

sections that include grain self-shielding effects. The
same procedure is repeated for each thorium resonance,
as is customary with GAM-IL.

Instead of using the modified GAM-II treatment to
obtain grain shielding factors as was done above, several
alternative procedures may be used. Perhaps the sim-

~ plest of these is the NR approximation, as applied to

that the two degrees of heterogeneity are separable —

an assumption that will be examined below. Although
the code is more general, it will be explained on the
basis of the ThO, grains in the fuel of an HTLTR
loading. The fuel is first considered as an infinite
medium, and the GAM-II solutions for ¢¢(u) in the
grains and ¢;(u#) in the matrix around them are
obtained over the usual lethargy band encompassing a
given thorium resonance. The associated volume-
averaged fluxes and the regional disadvantage factors
do(u) and d,(u) are then obtained, and the appropriate
disadvantage factor is applied to the cross sections of
each nuclide at each lethargy point. These disadvan-
taged cross sections are then taken to characterize a
smeared (homogenized) fuel within the fuel rods (say,

~region 2) in a lattice having graphite (say, region 3)

between the rods. The GAM-II treatment is again
applied, over the same lethargy band encompassing the
given thorium resonance, to obtain ¢,(ux) and ¢5(u).
Now. one performs for the given thorium resonance the
appropriate® integration to obtain cell-averaged cross

well approximated by using the asymptotic flux and the
grain potential scattering cross sections to calculate
them — just as one assumes for the moderator in the
usual GAM-II treatment. This leads to

Alternatively, one may assume that the NR approxi-
mation may be used for all sources due to moderators,
but that no downscattering is contributed by collisions
with resonance-absorber atoms, the so-called narrow
resonance infinite-mass (NRIM) approximation. The

Numerous other approxnnate methods have been
proposed. In a recent paper,” P. Wilti discusses several
of these and proposes one of his own that is somewhat
related to the NRIM approach. Walti gives an example

volume. We have used his problem to compare several
methods of obtaining grain shielding factors, with
results given in Table 2.1. Our results differ slightly
from Wilti’s because we used slightly different reso-
nance parameters. Fluxes and flux ratios are given at
the peaks of the two lowest thorium resonances.

2.2 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSER

2.2.1 Neutron Irradiation Effects Outside
the MSBR Core

J.R. Engel

One of the basic characteristics of the current MSR
concepts is the emission of a substantial fraction of the
delayed fission neutrons in regions other than the core

- of the reactor. Besides the effect on the dynamics of

the chain reaction in the core, the emission of neutrons
from the circulating fuel allows a number of potentially

- significant neutronic processes to occur in noncore

components. Computations were performed to estimate
the magnitude and effects in the reference design MSBR
of two out-of-core neutron processes: irradiation dam-
age to the Hastelloy N structural material and neutron
activation of the secondary salt. In general, two areas

~ were examined: the reactor outlet lines where the

we have carried out, that the use of GAM-II to evaluate -

the grain shielding factor in a heterogeneous fuel — as
we have done in our revised XSDRN code — is valid.
The results are very close to those given by GAROL,
which is an almost exact solution. Not quite so good,
but probably adequate for most practical cases, are the
other three methods tabulated.

On the other hand, the assumed separablhty of the

- two degrees of heterogeneity certainly introduces some

error, perhaps enough -to be significant. In principle,
one could consider the three distinct regions (called 0,
1,and 3 above) simultaneously and either (1) generalize

exchangers where there is interaction with the coolant
salt. ' :

Neutron sources. Delayed neutrons are emitted by at
least 25 nuclides that have fission product precursors
with half-lives ranging from a small fraction of a second
to 55.6 sec. These precursors are normally combined

. into six groups, and the net yield of delayed neutrons in

each group is expressed as a- fraction of- the total
neutron yield from fission. Data on the half-lives and
yields of delayed neutrons are readily available for the
various fissile materials. However, considerably less
material has been published regarding the energy
spectra of the delayed neutrons, particularly for neu-
tron energies above 1 to 2 MeV. Although relatively few

high-energy delayed neutrons are to be expected, some
neutron capture processes are quite sensitive to the
high-energy neutron flux. Consequently, ‘calculations
were performed for two assumed shapes of the de-
layed-neutron energy spectrum above 2 MeV. In one
series the spectrum was assumed to be flat out to 10
MeV, and in the second series the data below 2 MeV
were extrapolated to zero at about 5 MeV. The first
assumption almost certainly overestimates the high-
energy processes, and the second may also be con-
servatively high.

The intensities of the delayed-neutron sources were
computed from a hydraulic model® in which the
reactor was divided into 16 regions with fission-energy

production in 10 of them. Each region was treated asa

homogeneous vessel to compute the concentration of
delayed-neutron precursors at its outlet, and the various
streams were mixed according to the flow distribution
through the vessel. This led to a 'precursor concen-

tration for each delayed-neutron group at the reactor

outlet. From that point slug flow was assumed in
calculating the concentratlons in other parts of the
external loop. ' _

ppb) have been found to significantly reduce the
ductility of the standard (unmodified) alloy.}®
Although the modified alloys are much less sensitive to
helium, the production rate remains of interest. For
low-energy neutrons the principal source of helium is
the '°B(n, a)’Li reaction in boron that occurs as an
impurity in the alloy. At higher neutron energies, the
reaction *®Ni(n, )®*®Fe may also be important because
of the high nickel concentration in Hastelloy N. There
is evidence from high-flux irradiations of other helium-
producing reactions (probably involving sequential neu-
tron absorptions), but these are not likely to be
significant at the low fluxes that will exist outside the
core of an MSR. Aside from helium effects, Hastelloy N
is also subject to damage due to atom displacements
caused by neutron scattering events.

The activation processes of interest in the secondary
salt depend on the choice of coolant. With sodium
fluoroborate, the principal activity is 15-hr 2*Na from
the reaction

23Na(n, v)**Na .

With lithium-beryllium fluoride, the several reactions
that lead to tritium production are of greatest interest.
(Other activities are very short-lived.) Tritium pro-
duction was evaluated both for a coolant salt containing
natural lithium and for one in which the lithium is
0.99995 7Li.

Computations and results. All the processes described
above were evaluated from one-dimensional neutron
transport calculations made with the computer program
XSDRN,? using 123 neutron energy groups. The results
of the various neutron absorption processes are sum-
marized in Table 2.2.

 

 
 

 

 

20

The values listed for helium buildup in HasteHoy'N

are based on an initial '°B concentration of 2 atom

ppm (about 2 wt ppm of natural boron). Since the =

boron reaction is essentially a thermal-neutron reaction,
the helium from this process was unaffected by the
assumed shape of the delayed-neutron energy spectrum.
On the other hand, the 32 Ni(n, ) reaction has a high
energy threshold, so two values are listed. The first or
lower value corresponds to the neutron emission spec-
trum that went to zero at about 5 MeV, while the
_higher value was obtained with the spectrum that
extended to 10 MeV. Since all of the helium values
. from *®Ni are quite low, the only potentially signifi-

cant difference produced by the shape of the delayed- -

neutron spectrum is in the reactor outlet line. The
results in Table 2.2 consider only the internal neutron
sources — delayed fission neutrons plus those produced

by fissions within the components. One calculation was,

performed to estimate the effect of core-leakage neu-
trons on the rate of helium production. The maximum
amount of helium produced in the outer shell of the
heat exchanger in 30 equivalent full-power years
(EFPY) was about 500 ppb, 80% from °®Ni(n, a)
reactions. Thus helium production from core-leakage
neutrons may completely overshadow, at least locally,
the production from delayed neutrons, unless appro-
priate shielding is provided to reduce the fast-neutron
flux from this source.

The activation processes in the coolant salt were
found to be essentially independent of both the
high-energy end of the delayed-neutron source spec-
trum and the incidence of core-leakage neutrons. The

24Na calculation is applicable only to the ‘NaBF,:

coolant, and the value listed is the total steady-state
inventory for the 1000-MW(e) MSBR reference design.
The production rates of tritium in the various coolant
salts are all much smaller than the rate of production in
the fuel salt (2400 Cif/day). In the case of coolant
containing natural lithium, however, the production in
the coolant is not negligible.

The damage rate in Hastelloy N by atom displacement
was calculated for the highest flux regions in both the
reactor outlet line and the heat exchanger with NaBF,
coolant. Since the neutron flux spectrum outside the
core is quite different from any ﬁssic)'n-reactor spec-
trum, the.rate of accumulation of such damage was
expected to be different also. Consequently, atom
displacement rates were - computed using effective
“damage cross sections” evaluated by Jenkins.!! These
cross sections were obtained by explicit evaluation of
the energy transferred to primary recoil atoms and the
Kinchin-Pease model for secondary atom displacements.

In the calculations, the effect of the assumed delayed-
neutron spectrum was examined for the heat exchanger;
however, none of the calculations included the effects
of core-leakage neutrons. The effect of the delayed-
neutron source spectrum was appreciable in terms of
the *®Ni(n, ) reaction rate, but not significant in terms
of overall helium production. However, all of the flux
spectra in the out-of-core components were substan-
tially “softer” than a typical test-reactor flux spectrum
(e.g., that of HFIR). Consequently, the rates of atom
displacement per unit flux (£ > 100 keV) were lower
by factors of 1.2 to 1.3 than those that would be
encountered in a reactor spectrum with the same total
flux above 100 keV. Thus, the total number of
metal-atom displacements produced in these compo-

~ nents by operation of an MSBR for 30 EFPY could be

produced by irradiations to 2 to 4 X 10'® nvt (£ > 100
keV) in a test reactor like HFIR. Although the total
number of atom displacements is not an entirely
accurate measure of metal damage (since it completely
ignores annealing effects), the low equivalent HFIR
fluences suggest that damage by this process is probably
not of major concern for MSR components.

2.22 MSBE Nuclear Characteristics
| J. R. Engel

Perturbation calculations were added to a two-
dimensional, nine-group diffusion calculation for the
core of the reference concept MSBE!2? to provide
estimates of some of the reactivity coefficients of this
reactor. Although these calculations are subject to
refinement when a detailed core design is evolved, they
serve to illustrate the kinds of values that may be
expected. The results are summarized in Table 2.3,
along with previously published results.for the single-
fluid MSBR.'? A prominent difference between the
MSBE values and the comparable quantities for the
larger MSBR is in the reactivity effect of fuel-salt
density. In the MSBE the density coefficient is positive,

so that voids decrease reactivity (—0.1% 8k/k for 1%

voids in the salt). This effect appears to be a con-
sequence of the higher neutron leakage from the
physically smaller MSBE core. Also significant is the

2.2.3 Fixed-Moderator Molten-Salt Reactor
H. F. Bauman

We have extended the capability of the ROD code for
the calculation of the lifetime average performance of
molten-salt converter reactors with batch processing. At
the end of a batch cycle, usually more uranium can be
recovered than is required to make the reactor critical
with clean salt at the start of the next cycle. Therefore,
we have added an option in the HISTRY part of ROD
to permit the required portion of the uranium (as the
mixture of nuclides present in the core at the end of the
cycle) to be used for startup and the remainder to be
fed in as required before extraneous feed (e.g., pluto-
nium) is resumed. We have also added a provision for
changing from one extraneous fuel feed to another
(e.g., from plutonium to enriched uranium) at a
specified time in each cycle. Further, we have repro-
grammed the cost section of HISTRY to permit the
calculation of the present worth of all purchases of
fissile, fertile, and carrier salt materials over any number

- of cycles at a specified discount rate. This method is

more accurate for calculating costs which change with
time (e.g., the inventory cost, when the fissile inventory
increases during the cycle) than the calculation of costs
from data averaged over the reactor lifetime. (A
description of the ROD code, mcludmg the foregoing
improvements, was pubhshed during this report
period.!$) The studies reported below used these new
calculatlonal methods.

In previous reports we :described the calculated
performance of fixed-moderator'®  continuously
processed molten-salt breeder reactors,”° and how a
reactor with core proportions optimized for breeding
could operate as a converter using only batch process-
ing.'® Based on these results we chose the reactor
described in Table 2.4 for further studies on the effects
of various fissile feed schemes. Throughout: these
studies we held the processing interval fixed at six
full-power years (four cycles covering a 30-year life at
0.8 plant factor).

The first calculations were intended to compare the
use of plutonium and enriched uranium as the fissile
material for the initial startup and as feed to supple-
ment the bred material. The plutonium feed compo-
sition was taken to be equivalent to that produced in
water reactors (at. %- 23°Puf?%°Pu/?%!Pu/?%?Pu:
60/24/12/4); the uranium feed was assumed to be 93%
235U. In either case, we assumed that at the end of
each cycle the uranium is recovered and the salt
containing the fission products and plutonium is dis-
carded. (Uranium recovery. by the fluoride volatility

process is inexpensive and efficient, but there is at

present no economically feasible process for recovering

plutonium from the fuel salt.) None of the recovered
uranium is sold except that from the last cycle. Instead
it is used for startup in the next cycle, with any excess
fed in as required as long as it lasts. We found that in
either case the calculated conversion ratio is high (over
0.90) so that 233U soon builds up to become the
dominant fissile material. Consequently, over most of
the lifetime ~of the reactor the concentrations of the
extraneous fissile nuclides are low compared with their
concentrations for a short time after the initial startup.

~ Recognition of this situation caused us to reexamine

graphite, assuming continuous processing (case SCC-201).

one of the approximations in the calculations, namely,
that neutron energy spectra and effective cross sections
do not change drastically over the time interval being
considered.

The ROD-HISTRY computatlon takes an mput set of
nine-group cross sections and generates a set of reac-
tion-rate coefficients (equivalent one-group cross sec-
tions) averaged over the reactor volume and over a
neutron energy spectrum corresponding to a particular
fuel composition. The program then uses these coef-
ficients to compute nuclide concentrations as a func-
tion of time and a new fuel composition that is the

calculation. This routine is iterated until the time-
averaged composition “agrees satisfactorily -with the
composition used in evaluating the reaction-rate coef-
ficients. (The same set of nine-group cross sections is
used throughout the iterations.) Of course, the changing
fuel composition would actually affect the neutron
energy spectrum so that the effective cross sections are
not always exactly the same as they are when the fuel
composition is at the average for the time interval; the
error involved in the calculation depends on how much
the spectrum changes during the interval.

We suspected that for the reactors started on pluto-
nium a considerable spectrum change might be induced
by the effects of the low-lying plutonium resonances. A

typical set of nine-group "absorption .cross sections -

prepared for our study is given in Table 2.5. The energy
boundaries are shown in the table; groups 1 to 5 are

slovﬁng—dow_n (fast) groups while 6 to 9 are thermal

groups. The cross sections of 233U and 225 U are fairly
similar; starting up on 23%U and shifting to 2330,
therefore, would not be expected to greatly change the
reactor neutron spectrum or the fuel-nuclide reaction
rates from those calculated for the lifetime average. The
239Pu cross sections, on the other hand, are very much
higher in thermal groups 7, 8, and 9. This high cross

section makes plutonium a very reactive fuel, with low -

critical loadings in reactors in which the flux is well
thermalized. However, when recycled plutonium con-
taining much 24°Pu is the principal fuel, the high
240Py cross section (group 6) tends to depress the
thermal flux, hardening the spectrum and increasing the
critical loading of fissile material. Over the lifetime of a
molten-salt converter reactor that is started on recycled
plutonium but soon has much 233U and little pluto-
nium in it, the effect of plutonium on the neutron
energy spectrum might be expected to range from quite
important to rather slight. Reaction-rate constants
appropriate for the low lifetime average concentration
of plutonium are therefore likely to be seriously in
error at the start of life when the plutonium concen-
tration may be over ten times as high.

Our calculations had used a set of nine-group cross
sections appropriate for a fuel composition close to the
lifetime average and had computed reaction-rate coef-
ficients for the lifetime-averaged composition. Our first
test was to recalculate the first full-power year of
operation for both the uranium-fed and the pluto-
nium-fed converters, using the same nine-group cross
sections as before but having HISTRY evaluate reac-
tion-rate coefficients for the average composition for
the first year rather than for the average over.the

_reactor lifetime. Some results of the two computations
are listed in the first two columns of Table 2.6. The -

most salient point is that the calculated fissile loadings
for ‘the plutonium-fed reactor differ by a factor of 4
between two computations in which the only difference
is the interval used in evaluating the reaction-rate
constants. This is because the plutonium concentrations
during the first year, being much higher than the

~ lifetime average, cause more flux hardening and de-

pression of the reaction-rate coefficients. Obviously the

use of a lifetime-averaged fuel composition in deter-
mining the reaction-rate coefficient entails unacceptable
error when applied to the plutonium startup cases we
had been considering.

However, the reaction-rate coefficients for the en-
riched-uranium startup case changed hardly at all, and
lifetime-averaged coefficients appear to be entirely
adequate for these calculations.

The changes in self-shielding of the plutonium of a
plutonium-fed molten-salt converter reactor are great
enough to affect the calculation of the nine-group cross
sections also. To evaluate the significance of this, we
calculated a set of nine-group cross sections for a
reactor containing about 1000 kg of fissile plutonium.
(The asymptotic fuel composition used previously in
calculating nine-group cross sections included less than
100 kg of fissile plutonium.) This set was then used in
HISTRY to calculate the first year of operation,
evaluating reaction-rate constants for the average com-
position during the year. Results are shown in column 3

- of Table 2.6. The effective thermal cross sections for

the plutonium nuclides in the resonance groups were
considerably lower in this set. The spectrum-hardening

_effect ‘was therefore not as great, and the reaction-rate

coefficients were not as greatly depressed as they were
in case A32. Compared to case A24-2, however, the
coefficients are low, and the critical loadings are much
higher. _ - '
From the above considerations we conclude that

- previously reported calculations for converters started

on plutonium,'® while well representing the asymptotic

portion of the feed cycle, do not adequately represent

the startup condition in which plutonium is the
principal fissile material. The erfor involved in these
calculations will be minimized in future calculations in

which ROD-HISTRY averages fuel compositions over
much shorter intervals. It is evident, however, that
measures to maintain a well-thermalized flux spectrum
will probably be required to use recycled plutonium
effectively for the startup of high- performance thorium-
2337 converter reactors.

We are continuing. to study plutonium startup, with
the object of reducing the initial fissile loading. One

method would be to increase the moderator ratio by
- simply lowering the thorium concentration in the
reactor that we have been studying. In addition, we
plan to study reactors designed specifically as pluto-
nium-fed converters (in contrast to the reactor studied
thus far, whose core characteristics were optimized for
breeding with continuous processing). We would expect

the optimum converter reactor designs to have a
well-thermalized core flux spectrum.
The results of the enriched-uranium feed case shown

_in Table 2.7 indicate that very good performance can be

obtained from the breeder reactor operated as a
converter with batch processing. The changing fuel
composition over the reactor lifetime is shown in Fig.
2.3. The conversion ratio of over 90% is good for a
reactor processed only every six years. The fuel cost of
about 0.76 mill/kWhr excluding processing is attractive.
The cost of processing and disposal of the spent fuel has
been roughly estimated to add about 0.1 mill/kWhr to
this cost. The high fissile inventory cost relative to the
burnup cost suggests that a lower thorium concen-
tration would give a lower overall fuel cost for a reactor
designed specifically as a converter. This would result in
a lower fissile inventory at some sacrifice in conversion
ratio.

3.1 GASEOUS FISSION PRODUCT REMOVAL
C. H. Gabbard

'3.1.1 Gas Separator and Bubble Generator

The testing of the bubble separator continued in the
water test loop.! Tests were conducted to learn more
about the formation of the very fine bubbles that were
encountered with the water-glycerol test fluid and to
evaluate the separator performance with these small
bubbles. Although much of the available evidence
indicates that the bubbles will be larger in molten salts,
the large changes observed in the circulating gas content
of the MSRE fuel salt suggest that the bubble size might

- vary over a considerable range. The development of the

bubble separator is therefore proceeding on the basis of

-removing the small bubbles with the best possible

efficiency.

A series of tests with glycerol was completed which

shows that the liquid circulation pump was the source
of the very small bubbles and that the bubble size was
related to the pump head or speed. It is probable that
small bubbles formed in the pump during the operation
with demineralized water coalesced to a larger size
before reaching the separator, while the bubbles formed
in the glycerol solution were inhibited from coalescing

~and were representative of the size generated. The test

fluid was changed from the water-glycerol mixture to a
31% CaCl, solution in hopes of avoiding the very small
bubbles while maintaining hydraulic similitude, but
little or no difference was observed.

A gamma radiation densitometer was installed on the
water test loop to measure the separation efficiency
under several conditions of operation. We measured the
performance of the separator with the large bubbles in
demineralized water and with the small bubbles in the
31% CaCl, solution, and the results are shown in Fig.
3.1. The effect of bubble size on the performance of
the bubble separator was also demonstrated by a
dilution experiment starting with the 31% CaCl,
solution. Figure 3.2 shows the results of this experi-
ment. As the concentration was reduced, a sharp
increase in separation efficiency indicated the point
where the bubble size increased as a result of coales-
cence. The coalescence transition occurred at a concen-
tration of about 2.7 wt %, which is considerably greater
than the 0.61 wt % reported in recent literature,2 but

this difference could be caused by other additives in our

test solution or by the grossly different hydrodynamic

“conditions. These tests suggest that the size of bubbles

circulating in a reactor system will be determined by
the hydraulic design of the pump and circulating system
and by the coalescence properties of the fuel salt.

The distance between the swirl vane hub and recovery

hub of the test separator was increased from 27 to 44
in. to achieve the greater vortex length required to
separate bubbles from higher viscosity fluids. The
separation efficiency was improved substantially at low
gas flow rates by lengthening the separator, but a vortex
instability limited the gas removal capacity to below 1
scfm. Similar results were obtained with a long separa-
tor having a tapered outer casing. However, the removal

27

of the central core from the annular recovery? hub
resulted in satisfactory vortex stability over the full gas
flow range of O to 6 scfm. When operating in this
manner the gas void diameter is between % and Y% in.
depending on the gas flow rate. Efficiency tests are

currently in progress for this mode of operation.

3.1.2 Bubble Formation and Coalescence Test

A test has been planned to compare the bubble
formation and coalescence properties of molten salts
with those of demineralized water and other fluids. The
test will consist of mechanically agitating a sealed
quartz capsule of the test fluid in a special furnace and
photographing the capsule to show the size and
behavior of bubbles of gas in the liquid during and after
the agitation. The design of the test rig is nearing
completion.

3.2 GAS SYSTEM TEST FACILITY
R. H. Guymon

The gas system test facility (GSTF) is a loop for
circulating a fuel salt typical of the MSBR for use in
developing the technology of components to be used in
the primary system of a molten-salt reactor. The
performance of bubble generators and bubble separa-
tors, being developed initially in a water loop (see Sect.
3.1.1), will be tested, along with components for
purification and recycle of off-gas. Other tests include
determining the effect of the UF3;/UF, ratio on the
surface tension of the salt, studying noble gas and
possibly tritium distribution, and measuring heat and
mass transfer coefficients. The conceptual system de-
sign description (CSDD)? and the quality assurance?
for the facility were published during the period.

The facility, shown schematically in Fig. 3.3, will be
located in the enclosure previously occupied by the
molten-salt pump test stand in Building 9201-3 of the
Y-12 plant. The loop is of 5-in. sched 40 Hastelloy N
pipe, much of which was removed from the MSRE

“coolant system. Molten salt at 1050 to 1300°F is

pumped at 1000 gpm and 100-ft head by the MSRE

line downstream of the pump allows part (approxi-
mately one-half) of the flow to bypass the main loop.
The main loop flow goes through a flow-measuring
venturi (from the MSRE), a bubble separator, and a
bubble generator before rejoining the bypass flow and
returning to the salt pump.

Helium is injected at the bubble generator and flows
around the loop and through the pump prior to being
stripped at the bubble separator. The separated gas (0
to 37 slm) and entrained salt (12.5 to 6 gpm) go to the

“bulk salt separator which is an 8-ft-long section of 5-in.

Hastelloy N pipe inclined slightly from horizontal. The
salt from the bulk salt separator is returned to the loop
via the salt pump bowl, and the gas is recycled to the
bubble generator.

Pipe nozzles are shown in the high- and low-pressure
parts of the loop to facilitate installation of future
experiments. A salt-monitoring station is included for

testing various on-line instruments for determining

chemical and physical properties of the salt.

The main loop configuration was established, the
preliminary instrument application drawings were com-
pleted, and the drain tank design was nearly complete

at the end of the period. Initial operation is scheduled
to start in the fall of 1972, using coolant salt from the
MSRE to establish a base line for later operations. After
preliminary experiments and shakedown tests are com-
plete, this salt will be replaced with a salt similar to the
fuel salt projected for the MSBE.

3.3 OFF-GAS SYSTEMS

3.3.1 Off-Gas System for Molten-Salt Reactors

A design basis report is being written for off-gas
systems for use with molten-salt reactors. This report
reviews the present technology of off-gas systems,
discusses the advantages and disadvantages of several
approaches for the design of the off-gas systems,
describes the  design of the system chosen for a
reference, and discusses the additional information
which must be developed to establish the design. The
primary purpose of this report is to document the basis
for the reference design and to define the development
effort needed for the design of reliable off-gas systems.
 

 

 

 

3.3.2 Computer Design of Charcoal Beds
for MSR Off-Gas Systems

The design of charcoal beds for the delay of fission
product gases in MSR off-gas systems involves an
iterative calculation best handled by a digital computer.
Existing computer programs, which were used for the
Homogeneous Reactor Test and the Molten-Salt Reac-
tor Experiment, are arranged to calculate charcoal
temperatures and isotope exit concentrations and, as
such, are insufficient to be of maximum usefulness to
the charcoal bed designer. A computer program is
needed which includes cost and other selected param-
eters and which furnishes data necessary for mechanical
design. A study is being made to determine how the
existing programs might be revised and enlarged to
achieve such a program.

3.4 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
J.L.Crowley R.E.Helms

3.4.1 Steam Generator Industrial Program

Proposals were received from four of the eight
industrial manufacturers of steam generators that re-
ceived the request-for-proposal package. An evaluation
team studied the proposals and sclected the Foster
Wheeler Corporation. A subcontract is being negotiated
with them.

The scope of work requested of the industrial firm

was revised from that reported previously.® The
changes basically involved limiting the industrial firm to

-work on the steam generator and excluding the systems

design work originally requested. Although Task II was
most affected by this change a brief description of all
four tasks follows.

Task I — conceptual design of a steam generator for
the ORNL 1000-MW(e) MSBR reference steam cycle.

29

The firm will produce a conceptual design of a steam

generator to operate with the salt and steam conditions
of the MSBR reference design. The industrial firm will
consider all aspects of a conceptual design, including
unit size, control of steam temperature, and unique

support systems such as a startup system and a salt

circuit pressure relief system.

- Task IT — feasibility study and conceptual deszgn of
steam generators using lower feedwater temperature.
This task is divided into two parts, with the execution

 

6. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug. 31, 1970,
ORNL-4622, p. 40.

of the second dependent on the results of the first.

First, the selected firm will assess the feasibility of

molten-salt steam generators using feedwater tempera-

tures between 500 and 600°F. He will investigate both
subcritical and supercritical pressures. If the feasibility

assessment is affirmative for one or both of the above

pressures and if ORNL agrees, then the industrial firm

will prepare conceptual designs for steam generators

using these conditions and the salt system conditions of

Task I.

Task III — conceptual design of a steam generator for
a molten-salt reactor of about 150 MW/t). ORNL will
select a steam generator conceptual design from the
results of Tasks I and II. Then the industrial firm will
adapt this concept to a molten-salt reactor system of
about 150 MW(t).

Task IV — description of a research and development
program for Task III steam generator. For Task IV the
industrial firm will describe the research and develop-
ment program necessary to assure that the design of the
Task III steam generator is adequate. As part of this
task the industrial firm will review ORNL’s proposed

‘steam generator tube test facility and the associated

program and will also review the program of testing
Hastelloy N and other materials in steam.

We hope to have Task I conceptual design completed
during FY 1972. Tasks I, III, and IV would be
completed during FY. 1973 or early in FY 1974.

3.4.2 Molten-Salt Steam Generator Technology Facility

Work continued on the preparation of a conceptual
system design description (CSDD) for the steam gene-
rator technology facility (SGTF).” This facility would
be a side loop of the coolant-sait technology facility
(CSTF)® and would be used to study transient and
steady-state operation of some full-length tube test
sections and portions of a tube test section of a
molten-salt steam generator. The tests performed in this
facility would better define some of the technological
uncertainties to be investigated later with a larger
multitube test facility (STTS). The SGTF would be
used to:

1. investigate some of the problerns of generating steam -
using sodium fluoroborate and feedwater at various
temperatures up to 700°F;

30

2. perform heat and mass transfer tests in various steam
generator tube configurations;

3. investigate the use of thermocouples, strain gages,
and flow elements in a molten-salt environment
typical of larger test fa_cilities such as the STTS;

4. study flow stability in a single tube and the,ability
of orifices to eliminate any instabilities for load

- changes in the range of 20 to 100%;

5. explore some of the prbblems associated with the .

detection of ‘a steam—to-salt leak and the venting of
resulting pressure; :

6. obtain operating data on a scaled-down version of a
startup system.

3.4.3 Molten-Salt Steam Generator Test Proposals

Molten-salt steam generator test configurations are
being considered for test in the SGTF and the STTS.
" To date studies have been made on several tube-in-
tube configurations in which supercritical water flows
vertically in the inner tube countercurrent to an
unbaffled salt stream in the annulus between the inner
and outer tube. To select an inner tube wall thickness, a
computer stress analysis program was written to calcu-
late the internal working pressure that would produce a
total primary plus secondary stress intensity of 13,000
psi at 1100°F. The allowable stress intensity of 13,000
psi at 1100°F meets the requirements of Section III of
the ASME Code and Code Case 1315-3 for Hastelloy N
material. The results of these calculations are shown in
Table 3.1.

Seven tube sizes ranging from % to 1 in. in diameter
in steps of % in. and having an allowable working

pressure equal to or greater than 3600 psig at 1100°F
were selected from Table 3.1. 'These tubes were
subjected to further study. _

A heat transfer program was written to calculate the
salt and supercritical water/steam temperature profile
for the tube-in-tube molten-salt steam generator test
section. The program calculates the steady-state heat
transfer, steam pressure drop, water/steam temperature,
salt temperature, and temperature difference across the
inner tube for a finite element length of test section.
The salt temperature (TFI), the inside wall temperature
of the inner tube (TWI), the water/steam temperature

. (TS0), and the temperature drop across the inner tube

wall (DTW) as a function of test section tube length (ft)’
are then displayed by the Calcomp plotter as shown in
Fig. 3.4. The inner tube inside diameter (DI), the inner
tube outside diameter (DQO), the outer tube inside
diameter. (D1I), the outer tube diameter (D10), the
total heat transferred (kW), the salt flow rate (WF), the
steam flow rate (WS), the inlet pressure (psia), pressure
drop (psi), the finite element length (ft), and the date
are printed by the Calcomp plotter above the curves.
Using a feedwater flow rate that would produce 20
fps and a salt flow rate of six times the feedwater flow
rate, the outer tube was sized to give salt velocities of
about 20 fps. Preliminary results of calculations for
seven tube-in-tube steam generator configurations are
shown in Table 3.2. For full-length tubes that receive
700°F feedwater and produce 1000°F steam, only the
4- and the %-in.-diam tubes could be tested in the
150-kW SGTF, while larger tubes would be tested in the
3.0-MW STTS. Sections of larger tubes could be tested

_in the SGTF but not for full inlet and outlet steam
- generator conditions.

" 3.5 SODIUM FLUOROBORATE TEST LOOP
A. N. Smith

The as-removed appearance of the PKP pump rotary
element and the appearance of certain other test loop
components were described in the previous report.

During this period, the pump rotary element was

dismantled, and the component parts were examined

- visually after washing with hot water. Except for the

inner heat baffle plates, the appearance of the Inconel

metal surfaces was such as to imply insignificant attack -

during the fluoroborate service. The inner heat baffle
plates were badly corroded, and their condition was
attributed to corrosive material produced by the reac-
tion of moisture in the incoming purge gas with puddles

of salt which were left on the baffle plates during the

ingassing transients in May and June 1968. More
detailed information on observations and conclusions
resulting from examination of the rotary element parts
is presented below. No further work is planned on this
test program. A report? is being prepared summarizing
the work on the sodium fluoroborate test loop.

3.5.1 Inspection of PKP Pump Rotary Element

The impeller and upper impeller housing (see Fig. 3.5)
were removed from the PKP pump rotary element, and
the upper labyrinth seal ring and the heat baffles were
removed from the impeller housing. All parts were then
examined visually after washing with hot water to
remove residual deposits of NaBF, salt. The following
is a summary of our findings.

1. The vanes on the back side of the impeller and the
grooves inside the upper labyrinth seal ring showed
little sign of wear, based on the appearance of sharp
edges and corners.

2. The diameter of the slinger ring appeared to match
the curvature of the high-nickel, gray-black lumps
previously described.19

3. The appearance of the inner heat baffle plates was
markedly different from that of the outer heat baffle
plates. Except for a slight blackening of the surfaces,
the outer plates suffered very little attack. On the other
hand, the inner baffle plates (see Fig. 3.6) had been
severely attacked as evidenced by holes completely
through in some places and by severe pitting in other
places. The attack was not homogeneous on any one
plate or from one plate to another. The top surface of
the top plate was severely pitted, but the other surfaces
which combined to form the chamber above the top
plate (shaft, inner surface of impeller housing support
cylinder, and lower surface of the cooling oil chamber)
were relatively free of attack. All baffle plates except
the one below the top plate had holes corroded
completely through. The inner heat baffles fitted very
tightly against the inner surface of the upper impeller
housing support cylinder, so that probably most of the
gas flow was past the inner annulus between the baffle
plates and the pump shaft. ’

4. A groove was found in the surface of the pump
shaft at a point adjacent to the inner heat baffles. The
groove was about % in. 'wide and about Y% in. in
maximum depth. It was smooth in contour and was not
pitted. '

5. Metal surfaces had a coarse, grainy appearance but
were not severely pitted except on the inner heat baffle
plates. s "

6. Contrary to pump assembly drawing F-2882-K,

there were no holes in the impeller housing support

cylinder just above the inner heat baffles. The absence

of these holes means that all of the pump shaft purge
gas had to flow past the five inner heat baffle plates in
order to get to the main part of the pump bowl.

We have drawn the following conclusions from these
observations:

1. Except for the inner heat baffles, corrosive and
erosive attack was slight, which is consistent with
observations made of pump bowl surfaces.19

2. The high-nickel, gray-black lumps were formed by
deposition on the' surface of the slinger ring, probably
by precipitation of corrosion products on the cooler
shaft surface as was discussed earlier.19

3. The severe heterogeneous attack suffered by the
inner heat baffles came about in the following manner.
NaBF, salt was forced into the baffle region during the
ingassing transients in May and June 1968.1! Scattered
puddles of salt were retained on the baffle surfaces
because the latter were not perfectly flat. The incoming

 

11. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug. 31, 1968,
ORNL-4344, pp. 76—177.

purge gas was in intimate contact with the puddles of
salt, and the moisture in the purge gas, estimated to
have been somewhere between ! and 20 ppm by
volume, combined with the puddles of salt to form
reaction products which corroded the adjacent metal
surfaces.

4. The degree of attack on the upper baffle piates |

was at least as severe as that on the lower baffle plates.
If we assume a significant temperature gradient between
the bottom and top plates, the implication would be
that the water-salt reaction products are highly corro-
sive even at relatively low temperatures. Direct measure-
ments of the baffle plate temperatures were not made,
but it is estimated that the temperature of the top
baffle plate was SO0°F or less. Additional tests are
needed to determine the variation of corrosiveness with
temperature, since there are important general implica-
tions for reactor systems using NaBF,. For example,
efficient cleaning procedures will be needed to ensure

that NaBF, salt residues are not left on the outside

surfaces of pipes and equipment where exposure to
moist atmospheres is probable, and where the metal

3.6 COOLANT-SALT TECHNOLOGY FACILITY
A. 1. Krakoviak

The mechanical design of the coolant-salt technology
facility is nearing completion. The design now includes
two side-stream loops and a specimen surveillance
station. One of the side-stream loops supplies salt to a
corrosion product trap to investigate on-line removal of
Na;CrFs from sodium fluoroborate by cold zone
deposition as outlined in'the “Conceptual System
Design Description.” The trap was designed to operate
from 750 to 1150°F at a salt flow rate of 0.2 gpm for a
salt system cycle time of approximately 8 hr. The cold

trap was also designed to investigate the recombination

of BF3 vapor (12 to 25% BF,; in the off-gas stream
from the pump bowl) with the relatively cool salt melt
(~850°F) in the cold trap. This system is expected to
reduce the BF; content in the off-gas stream to <0.5%
BF;. Provisions have been made in the cold trap to
condense and collect the acid liquid!2 from the off-gas
stream.

The second side-stream loop was designed for on-line

monitoring of the salt by electrochemical means (devel-

oped by the.  Analytical Chemistry Division). The loop
consists of a 3-gal-capacity vessel with associated piping
which will operate at a flow rate of ~2 gpm while
maintaining a constant salt volume of 1.2 gal in the
vessel. The salt-monitoring vessel was designed to

 

12. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr Rep. Aug 31 1970,
ORNL-4622, pp. 4144,

provide: (1) a quiescent liquid surface: of sodium
fluoroborate representative of the main loop, (2)
operation at constant temperature and salt level in the
vessel, (3) salt residence time of approximately 30 sec,
(4) on-line removal, insertion, and adjustment of depth
of immersion of the electrode, and (5) visual access to
the gas-liquid-electrode interface.

Fabrication of the drain tank and the material
specimen surveillance station for the CSTF is complete,
‘and fabrication of components for the two side-stream
loops has started.

The MSRE coolant system piping, pump bowl and
level indicator, which were removed for reuse in the
CSTF, were cleaned with oxalic acid to remove the
residual LiF-BeF, salt. However, removal of the resid-
ual tritium contamination from the inside surfaces of
the pump bowl was not complete. The greatest contam-
ination was associated with oily and carbon-like coat-

‘ings on surfaces,!3 and a standard smear test of a

coated area in the pump bowl cylinder opposite the
shield plug showed ~800,000 dis/min of transferable
tritium. After cleaning this surface with abrasive cloth
and dilute nitric acid, transferable tritium was reduced
to 12,000 dis/min. Using this procedure, the piping and
pump bowl nozzles within approximately 6 in. of
proposed welds were cleaned to tritium levels below
2000 dis/min (MPC for uncontrolled area) and are
ready for assembly.

3.7.1 Salt Pumps for MSRP Technology Facilities

The coolant pump tank and volute that were removed

~ recently from the MSRE and the spare rotary element

from storage will be used in the coolant-salt technology
facility. When used with a 10.33-in.-diam impeller, this
combination will provide the required 90-ft head and
800-gpm flow at 1765 rpm by operating slightly toward
the shutoff side of its approximate MSRE operating
point of 85-ft head and 900-gpm flow rate. This
operation is not expected to impose excessive radial
hydraulic forces on the pump shaft. The available 75-hp
motor will be loaded to. approximately 45 hp for this
service, :

The rotary element will be reconditioned with new
bearings, and the shaft seals will be relapped. It will
then be operated in a cold shakedown stand to check
shaft seal leakage rates prior to installation in the
coolant-salt technology facility.

The head and flow requirements for the gas system
test facility will be provided by installing an available
11%-in.-diam impeller of MSRE coolant-salt pump
design in the MSRE Mark 2 fuel-salt pump. This
impeller will provide 1000 gpm and approximately
100-ft head with 100-bhp input at near 1800-rpm pump
speed. Since the inlet and discharge openings in the
coolant-salt pump impeller are smaller than those in the
fuel-salt pump impeller, a stationary filler piece will be
installed in the volute inlet. A spare MSRE coolant
pump drive motor, nominally rated for 75 hp at 1200
rpm, but wound for 1800-rpm operation, will be used.
This oversize motor can sustain continuous operation to
113 hp at 1800 rpm. The oversize frame was selected
early during MSRE design to standardize the motor-to-
bearing housing mounting dimensions for both the
1200-rpm fuel pump and 1800-rpm coolant pump.

The rotary element from the Mark 2 pump will be
reconditioned. New bearings will be installed, the shaft
seals will be relapped, and the rotary assembly will be
balanced dynamically. The element then will be oper-
ated in the cold shakedown stand to check shaft seal
leakage rates prior to installation in the gas system

technology facility. During the assembly, measurements _

will be made of radial load vs shaft deflection and shaft
critical frequency of the Mark 2 pump shaft with the
11%,-in.-diam impeller. .

35

Spare parts for the two pump assemblies have been

- inventoried, and spare hollow metal O-rings made from

Hastelloy N tubing have been ordered. The %-in.-OD
by 0.035-in.-wall tubing for the O-rings will be formed
by drawing %-in.-OD by 0.072-in.-wall Hastelloy N
tubing that is on hand. '

3.7.2 ALPHA Pump

Initial operation of the ALPHA pump!4 with high-
temperature salt in the MSR-FCL-2 test facility demon-
strated the need for several modifications to improve
reliability; the design of these modifications is in
progress. In the meantime, the pump is being operated
in the MSR-FCL-2 at the specified design conditions.

Prior to installation in the salt facility, the pump was
subjected to a cold shakedown test to ensure that
bearings and rotating and static seals function properly.
The results of several tests indicate steady-state oil
leakage rates past the rotating shaft seals ranging from
0.3 to 3.5 cc/day for a pump speed of approximately
4000 rpm and a seal differential pressure of 7 psi.

Considerable difficulty was experienced with the
hollow metal O-ring gaskets which seal the removable
pump rotary element to the pump bowl. In the present
design the space between two concentric gaskets is
buffered with helium. The gaskets are of hollow
stainless steel tube construction, have a toroidal diam-
eter of % in., an overall diamefer of 6 in., and are
plated with silver or gold. In an initial test with
silver-plated gaskets, after carefully hand polishing the
sealing surfaces in the matching flanges, a total leak rate
of approximately 6 cc/hr past both rings was attained
with the buffer zone pressurized to 6.5 psig. The plating
flaked from gold-plated gaskets during installation, and
so gold plating is not receiving current attention. The
total leak rate was reduced in a later installation by
carefully hand polishing the silver-plated gaskets: the
total leak rate of approximately 1 cc/hr was attained
with the buffer zone pressurized to 8 psig. This leak
rate was considered satisfactory because it is unlikely
that either air-or moisture can enter the pump in a
significant quantity past the buffer gas barrier. How-
ever, because of the difficulty in attaining and maintain-
ing the polished surfaces needed to achieve a satisfac-
tory seal with the hollow metal O-rings, we plan to
replace them with a buffered ring joint seal utilizing a

- solid metal gasket.

ORNL-4676, p. 59.
 

 

 

The ALPHA pump developed a gas leak across the

lower shaft seal after 56 hr of intermittent operation .

“and a total of 510 hr at elevated temperature in the
MSR-FCL-2. Disassembly and inspection of the pump

revealed than an O-ring made of Buna-N had failed. The

O-ring is part of the shaft seal which was purchased
from the Sealol Corporation. The lower shaft seal
operates with oil lubricant contacting its top side and
gas contacting its lower side. The gas is principally
helium containing approximately 0.1% BF; whose
* source is the sodium fluoroborate in the pump tank.
. The dilute BF; attacked the Buna-N material and
produced the gas leak. The split purge flow of helium in

the shaft annulus was not operated in this application

because it had not been found necessary to the
successful operation of a similar seal on the LFB pump
in the MSR-FCL-1. Impurity control -and facility
operation are also simplified when the split purge is not
used. T
~ The mechanical design of the lower shaft seal is being
changed to (1) replace the present elastomeric static
seal with a metallic bellows and (2) to eliminate the
press fit of the seal cartridge in the inner bearing
housing. The press fit has caused galling of the static
sealing surface in the inner bearing housing. In addition,
the cross section of the pump shaft will be strengthened
in the vicinity of the lower shaft seal and bearing. These
improvements in the pump will be accomplished during
a future scheduled shutdown.
 In order to proceed with the test program for the
MSR-FCL-2, temporary repairs were made to the pump.
An O-ring made of Viton, which is more resistant to
BF; than Buna-N, was installed in the present lower
shaft seal. The inner bearing housing was machined and
plated with copper to provide a good sealing surface for
‘the seal cartridge. After a cold shakedown test the
pump was reinstalled in the MSR-FCL-2 facility and is
- presently supplying 850°F salt at the design flow rate
of 4 gpm at 4800-rpm shaft speed.

3.7.3 Drain Tank Jet Pump System for MSDR

A study was made of a jet pump system to return fuel
salt from the drain tank to the fuel-salt system of the
Molten-Salt Demonstration Reactor (MSDR). The salt
going to the drain tank is part of the effluent from the
~gas separator used to remove the gaseous fission
products from the fuel salt. It is estimated that the flow
- of fuel salt into the drain tank will be between 27 and
36 gpm when all three fuel-salt pumps and their gas
injector-separator systems are operating normally.

The jet pump system is shown schematically in Fig.
3.7. During normal operation, jet pump A, having a
pumping capability of a little greater than 36 gpm, will

take salt and gas from the bottom of the drain tank and
discharge it along with its driving salt, Q, 4, into the

inner vessel. It will probably be necessary to install a gas

separator in the discharge line of jet pump 4.
Jet pump B is the primary salt return pump and is

~ designed to have a suction flow that is strongly

dependent upon the salt level in the inner vessel. The
characteristics of jet pump B are shown in Fig. 3.8,

- where Qgp is the flow return from the drain tank and

includes the driving flow, Qp 4, for jet pump A. During
normal operation the salt level, Hy, in the inner vessel
will be between 6 and 10 ft above the center line of jet

pump B. If the salt level in the inner vessel should drop .
to about 5 ft below the jet pump center line, the

suction flow will go to zero and the pump will be
operating very near cavitation. The purpose of having
this pump characteristic is to prevent the unwanted and
uncontrolled reintroduction of gas from the drain tank

~ into the fuel-salt system should the salt flow from the

separator be drastically reduced. The jet pumps have
some overcapacity should the flow from the gas

operational characteristics of jet pump B. The (unused)
jet pump would have a nominal design area ratio
(driving nozzle area/mixing throat area) of 0.197. Four
conditions were investigated:

a. an area ratio of 0.207 caused by an increase in the
nozzle diameter by erosion and corrosion,

b. an area ratio of 0.207 caused by a decrease in the
mixing throat diameter by plating,

c. an area ratio of 0.187 caused by a decrease in the
nozzle diameter by plating,

d. an area ratio of 0.187 caused by an increase in the
mixing throat diameter by erosion-corrosion.

The driving nozzle diameter for the 0.197 area ratio
was about 0.500 in., and the corresponding mixing
throat diameter was 1.126 in. The four conditions listed
above represent corresponding diametral changes as
follows:

a. nozzle diameter increase of 0.012 in.,

-b. mixing throat diameter decrease of 0.027 in.,

¢. nozzle diameter decrease of 0.013 in.,

d. mixing throat diameter increase of 0.030 in.

The results are shown in Fig. 3.8 from which it can be
seen that (1) an increase in the nozzle diameter
increases jet pump delivery just as does a decrease in the
mixing throat diameter, and (2) a decrease in the nozzle .
diameter decreases jet pump delivery as does an increase
in the mixing throat diameter. It can also be seen in Fig.
3.8 that conditions ¢ and & would result in an
uncontrolled delivery of radioactive gas to the fuel-salt
system if the inflow of salt to the drain tank from the
gas separator were reduced to about 6 gpm, which
corresponds to a Qgp of approximately 15 gpm.
Conditions ¢ and d limit the pumping capability of the
two jet pumps to about 40 to 45 gpm. '
There are alternative -configurations and character-
istics for jet pumps that may furnish adequate opera-
tional margins when the long-term erosion, corrosion,

~ and plating characteristics of container material in fuel

salt are understood well enough to warrant additional
study. o

4.1 TRANSIENT AND CONTROL STUDIES OF THE
- MSBR SYSTEM USING A HYBRID COMPUTER

O.W. Burke

The hybrid computer model of the MSBR system as
described in the February, 1971, semiannual progress
report! is operational. In order to accommodate the
calculational stability and time requirements of the
digital portion of the hybrid computer, the model
operates in a time domain that is 20 times real system
time.

The model has been checked out, and a number of
transients have been run in order to test its validity. At
this point the model includes no controllers. The next
order of business is to incorporate system controllers
into the model and to check the performance of these
controllers. ,

The model will be used in the development of an

overall control scheme for the MSBR plant. Of partic- -

ular interest is the effect of variable flow rate in the
secondary salt loop and the use of bypass valves in the
secondary loop. The model will also be used to aid in
the determination of the range of thermal transients
which could be expected in the salt systems under
anticipated transient conditions. This information is
needed as input for the design studies of the steam
generator.

5. Heat and Mass Transfer and Thermophysical Properties

H. W. Hoffman

‘5.1 HEAT TRANSFER
J. W. Cooke

In studies of heat transfer to a proposed MSBR fuel
salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF,; 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %) we
observed that, for the Reynolds modulus range from
2000 to 4000, the heat transfer coefficient varies along
the test section in a manner which appears to be related
to a delay in transition to turbulent flow. It has been
suggested that this delay in transition is abetted by the
stabilizing influence of heating for the case of a fluid
having a large negative temperature coefficient.! Addi-
tional experimental results using the proposed MSBR
salt have been obtained which tend to conf:rm this
theory.

In Fig. 5.1, the v1sc051ty 1.1 and its first derivative
du/dt are plotted as a function of temperature for the
subject molten-salt mixture. Note that the temperature
coefficient ldu/dt| decreases by a factor of 10 from 900
to 1450°F. If, indeed, the flow is stabilized by a large
negative value of du/dt, the stabilization should become

less pronounced as the fluid temperature increases; the

variation_ in the local heat transfer coefficient with
To verify this hypothesis,
additional heat transfer measurements were taken at an
average fluid temperature of 1450°F and compared
with existing data at 1100°F. These data are tabulated
in Table §. 1

It was not practical to operate the gas-pressurized
heat transfer system in such a manner that exactly the
same mass flow rate and average fluid temperature were
maintained for consecutive runs with and without an
unheated entrance length. This was particularly true at
the higher temperature where both the mass flow rate
and frictional pressure losses were so small that moni-
toring the flow rate to hold the Reynolds modulus
constant was not possible. In- addition, the fluid
temperature (and thus the fluid viscosity) varied from
inlet to outlet of the ‘test section, particularly during
the higher heat flux runs.

To compare the local heat transfer coefficients at the
two temperatures with or without an entrance region, a
method was developed to normalize the data using
Hausen’s equation to include the dependence of local
heat transfer coefficient on Reynolds modulus and fluid
properties:

u 0.14
Ny, =0.116 (Vg 2/3 — 125)Npr‘/3(3> . (5.1)

This equation correlates molten salt as well as oil and
water heat transfer data in the transitional flow regime.
The normalizing procedure followed three steps: (1)
Each local heat transfer coefficient for the individual
runs was adjusted to the same Reynolds and Prandtl
moduli based on the average fluid temperature in the
test section; (2) each local coefficient for a pair of
consecutive runs (with and without an entrance region).
was then adjusted to an average of the two Reynolds
- and Prandtl moduli for the pair of runs; and (3) finally,
the coefficients for two pairs of runs at two tempera-
ture levels were adjusted to the average Reynolds
modulus for the two pairs of runs. In most cases, these
adjustments amounted to only a few percent in the h
value.

Variations in the ratio-of the normalized local heat
transfer coefficient &, to the heat transfer coefficient at
the exit, hey;, (entrance length case), with distance
from the inlet to the heated test section are shown in
_ Fig. 5.2. Included are results for two values of heat flux
and Reynolds modulus.

A small but significant improvement can be seen in |
the heat transfer development with length at the higher
fluid temperature, as evidenced by the more rapid

approach to constant h, for the case without an

entrance length. The influence of heat flux on the heat -
-transfer development cannot be conclusively deduced

from Fig. 5.1, however, because of the simultaneous
variation of Reynolds modulus in this transitional range
for which relatively small changes m the Reynolds
modulus are significant.

Experiments aimed at a study of the effect of wetting
on molten-salt heat transfer using the proposed MSBR
fuel salt have been delayed due to inability, at the
present, to understand the wetting behavior of this salt
in static capsule experiments. The salt was observed to
be wetting on Hastelloy N initially, whereas our
previous experience with the salt mixture LiF-BeF,-
ZrF,-ThF 4-UF, (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) suggested that
nonwetting should be observed initially, and that a
reducing agent (e.g., Zr or Be) would be required to
produce wetting.? Since the MSBR salt exhibited
wetting under all conditions, we believe that it is
necessary to explain the behavior and to investigate
techniques for inducing nonwetting which can be
applied in the heat transfer system.

5.2 THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES
J. W. Cooke

Measurements of the thermal conductivity of the salt
mixture LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) have been made over
the temperature range from 300 to 870°C (458°C mp)
using the improved version of the variable-gap tech-
nique.? The preliminary results (omitting two data sets
in the solidus region which are being analyzed) are
shown in Fig. 5.3. These new results fall midway
between previous uncorrected and corrected results,®**
but the temperature dependency in the liquidus region
is less than our previous measurements had indicated.

"The ratio of the liquid to solid conductivity is around

0.75 compared with the average value of 0.86 + 0.13
published for a group of salts.® The estimated maxi-
mum uncertainty in the present results is expected to
be less than £10%.

Mass transfer coefficients have been measured for
helium bubbles of mean diameters from 0.015 to 0.05
in. extracting dissolved oxygen from five different
mixtures of glycerol and water (Schmidt modulus range
from 419 to 3446) over a pipe Reynolds modulus range
from 3.1 X 10? to 1.6 X 10° for both horizontal and
vertical flow in a 2-in.-diam conduit. Extensions of this
program are projected for different pipe diameters and
different interfacial conditions. Additional experiments
are anticipated that will establish mass transfer rates
applicable to such flow “discontinuities” as elbows,
tees, valves, venturis, etc.

One of the first conclusions of these experiments is
that the only effect on mass trarisfer rates of bubble
volume fractions up to 1% is in the highly predictable

‘change in surface area. No significant influence of

bubble volume fraction on the mass transfer coeffi-
cients (which are based on unit area) was detected.
An examination of all the experimental data has

revealed that the mass transfer coefficients depend on

the flow orientation (horizontal or vertical). At suffi-
ciently high flows, however, the horizontal and vertical
results are observed to be indistinguishable within limits
of the experimental error. To establish a criterion for
the Reynolds modulus that marks this equivalence of
horizontal and vertical flow, use was made of an
expression developed previously” for the relative im-

A conservative value, F;/F, = 1.5, has been estab-

As flow was decreased to a value for which the ratio
of liquid axial velocity to bubble terminal velocity (in

the gravity field) was about 3, severe stratification of

The preceding correlations apparently apply only for
mobile interfacial conditions as evidenced by the high
exponent for the Schmidt modulus. For rigid interfaces,
this exponent is expected to be %, and the coefficient

Part 2. Chemistry

R. B. Briggs

The chemical development activities described below
are, in the main, conducted to provide chemical
information required in the development of molten-salt
reactor systems.

An appreciable, though diminishing, fraction of the -

effort is still devoted to postoperational examination of
specimens and materials from MSRE. Such -examina-
tions, several of which are detailed in this document,
should be largely concluded during the next reportmg
period.

The behavior of hydrogen and tritium in molten salt,

metals, and graphite constitutes a substantial fraction of
the research and development effect. “Solubility of
hydrogen and its isotopes in molten fluorides is under
study, as are rates of diffusion of hydrogen through
pertinent metals and possible chemical exchange
schemes capable of holding up the tritium to allow time
for its controlled recovery.

Studies of chemical separation of protactinium during
this period have been confined to those based upon
selective precipitation of oxides. It now appears that
such a separation process is chemically feasible; we
anticipate that, insofar as small-scale studies are con-

~cerned, these researches will be concluded during the

45

coming few weeks. Small efforts continue on improve-

ments to the reductive extraction process for rare earths

and, more significantly, upon methods for removal of
rare-earth species from lithium chloride.

Study of possible mechanisms of the intergranular
attack upon the metallic components in MSRE now
constitutes an appreciable fraction of the chemical
research program. These studies, all initiated in recent
months, have not yet produced information to report.

The principal emphasis of analytical chemical devel-
opment programs has been placed on methods for use
in semiautomated operational control of molten-salt
breeder reactors, for example, the development of
in-line analytical methods for the analysis of MSR fuels,
for reprocessing streams, and for gas streams. These
methods include electrochemical and spectrophoto-
metric means for determination of the concentration of
U3 and other ionic species in fuels and coolants, and
adaptation of small on-line computers to electro-
analytical methods. Parallel efforts have been devoted
to the development of analytical methods related to
assay and control of the concentration of water, oxides,
and tritium in fluoroborate coolants.

 

 
 

 

 

6. Postoperational' Examination of MSRE -

6.1 EXAMINATION OF MODERATOR GRAPHITE
FROM MSRE

S.S.Kirslis  F.F. Blankenship

. A complete stringer of graphite (located in an axial
position between the surveillance specimen assembly
and the control rod thimble) was removed intact from
the MSRE. This 64.5-in.-long specimen was transferred
to the hot cells in building 3525 for examination,
segmenting, and sampling. Most of the examinations
and analyses were similar to those given to the graphite
surveillance specimens previously removed from MSRE
during its scheduled shutdowns. In addition to these
“standard” methods, surface samples from the stringer
were examined by Auger spectroscopy and by a special
x-ray diffraction technique, cross sections of the
stringer were gamma scanned with a special pin-hole
collimating device, and samples milled from the stringer
were carefully analyzed for tritium.

6.1.1 Results of Visua! Examination

Careful examination of all surfaces of the stringer
with a Kollmorgen periscope showed the graphite to be

generally in very good condition, as were the many

surveillance specimens previously examined. The cor-
ners were clean and sharp, the faint circles left upon
milling the fuel channel surfaces were visible and

appeared unchanged, and the surfaces, with minor

exceptions described below, were clean. The stringer
bottom, with identifying letters and numbers scratched
on it, appeared identical to the photograph taken
before its installation in MSRE.

46

Examination revealed a few solidified droplets of

flush salt adhering to the graphite, and one small (0.5

cm?) area where ‘a grayish-white material appeared to
have wetted the smooth graphite surface. One small
crack was observed near the middle of a fuel channel.
At the top surface of the stringer a heavy dark deposit
was visible. This deposit seemed to consist in part of
salt and in part of a carbonaceous material; it was
sampled for both chemical and radiochemical analysis.
Near the metal knob at the top of the stringer a crack in
the graphite had permitted a chip (about ! mm thick
and 2 cm?® in area) to be cleaved from the flat top
surface. This crack may have resulted from mechanical
stresses due to threading the metal knob into the
stringer (or from thermal stresses in this metal-graphite
system during operation), rather than from radiation or
chemical effects. '

6.1.2 Segmenting of Graphite Stringer

Upon completion of the visual observation and
photography and after removal of small samples from
several locations on the surface, the stringer was
sectioned with a thin carborundum cutting wheel
(Canosaw) to provide five sections of 4 in. length, three
thin (10 to 20 mil) sections for x radiography, and
three thicker (30 to 60 mil) sections for pin-hole
scanning with the gamma spectrometer. Each set of

samples contained specimens from near the top, middle,

and bottom of the stringer. The large specimens, from
which surface samples were subsequently milled, in-

cluded (in addltlon) two samples from intermediate

positions.

6.1.3 Examination of Surface Samples
by X-Ray Diffraction

Previous attempts to determine the chemical form of
fission products deposited on graphite surveillance
specimens by x-ray reflection from flat surfaces failed
to detect any element except graphitic carbon. A
sampling method which concentrated surface impurities
was tried at the suggestion of Harris Dunn of the

‘Analytical Chemistry Division. This method involved

lightly brushing the surface of the graphite stringer with
a fine Swiss pattern file which had a curved surface. The
grooves in the file picked up a small amount of surface
material which was transferred into a glass bottle by
tapping the file on the lip of the bottle. In this way
samples were taken at the top, middle, and bottom of
the graphite stringer from the fuel channel surface,
from the surface in contact with graphite, and from the
curved surface adjacent to the control rod thimble.
Samples were also taken of the “dirty” graphite and salt
on the top end surface of the stringer.

Although each sample contained only about a dozen
tiny particles and weighed less than 0.1 mg, the various
samples read 1 to 4 R/hr at a distance of 6 in. with a
soft-shelled “Cutie Pie” outside the glass bottle wall.

This radiation field made transfer of the particles into"

glass capillaries for powder x-ray diffraction examina-
tion a difficult operation. However, three (0.2 m)
capillaries were packed and mounted in holders which
fitted into the x-ray camera. -

Short-exposure x-ray photographs were taken with
precautions to minimize blackening of the film by the
radioactivity. In spite of the precautions, samples from
the fuel channel surfaces yielded very dark films which
were difficult to read. Many weak lines were observed
in the x-ray patterns. Since other analyses had shown
Mo; Te, Ru, T¢, Ni, Fe, and Cr to be present in
significant concentrations on the graphite surface, these
elements and their carbides and tellurides were searched
for by careful comparison with the observed patterns.

In all three of the graphite surface samples so far
analyzed, most of the lines for Mo,C and Ru metal
were certainly present. For one sample, most of the
lines for Cr,C; were seen. (The expected chromium
carbide in equilibrium with excess graphite is Cr;C,,
but nearly half the diffraction lines for this compound
were missing, including the two strongest lines.) Five of
the six strongest lines for NiTe, were observed. Mo

the chemical form of fission products known to be

“deposited on the graphite surface.

metal, Te metal, Tc metal, Cr metal, CtTe, and MoTe,

were excluded by comparison of their known pattern
with the observed spectrum. These observations (except
for that of Cr,C;) are in gratifying accord with

Several hot cell techniques were tried for mounting
the x-ray diffraction samples in glass capillaries or on
quartz fibers, but they proved unsuccessful. To avoid
undue radiation exposure to analytical chemistry per-
sonnel, the remaining samples were not analyzed.

6.1.4 Examination with a Gamma Spectrometer

In order to provide an inexpensive guide for later
radiochemical work with milled stringer samples, a
simple technique was developed (with the help of E. I.
Wyatt and H. A. Parker of the Analytical Chemistry
Division) for taking gamma scans of a number of
locations on the cross-section samples of the graphite
stringer. The sample, approximately 2 X 2 X 0.050 in.,
was placed over a %, ¢-in.-diam hole through the center
of a large face of a 4 X 4 X 8 in. lead brick. The hole
was positioned over the center of the Nal crystal of a
gamma spectrometer. The sample was shielded above by
a ¥,-in.-thick sheet of plate glass with a scratched cross
on the bottom surface positioned above the hole in the
lead brick. By means of a 12-in. plastic ruler taped to
the specimen, any desired region of the graphite cross
section could be positioned over the hole in the lead
brick for gamma scanning. With this relatively rapid
technique, 18 to 20 positions were gamma scanned on
each of the cross-section samples from the top, middle,
and bottom of the graphite stringer.

The distribution of the four main activities observed
(*°®Ru,258b, 134Cs, and *37Cs) in the three samples
is shown graphically in Fig. 6.1. The numbers on each
map are counts per minute above background and are
proportional to the radioactivity at each position for a
given isotope. (For comparison between isotopes,
counts per minute are not proportional to disintegra-
tions per minute because of different counting. effi-
ciencies.) In broad outline, the results were as expected.
Heavy surface depositions of '®®Ru and '?°Sb were
observed with little penetration to the interior. The Cs
isotopes were found at deeper locations since they
possessed gaseous precursors (5.27-day '3*?Xe and
4.2-min 137 Xe). ' -

The volume of graphite scanned by this technique was
quite small (%} in. diam X 0.050 in.); this permitted a
more fine-grained look at fission product distribution
than was possible by the milling techniques previously
used for sampling graphite surveillance specimens.
Correspondingly, the surface concentrations of all

isotopes varied considerably between the two fuel
channel surfaces examined. Usually, but not always,
there was less of each isotope deposited near the
surfaces in contact with adjacent graphite stringers or
with the control rod thimble. Individual (reproducible)
134Cs points were often considerably higher or lower
than adjacent points on a line between one fuel channel
surface and the other. The variations at the graphite
surface are believed to indicate spotty rather than
uniform deposition of fission products on the specimen
surface. The interior variations are believed to indicate
variations in porosity of the interior graphite. These

observations and hypotheses are in accord with auto- -

radiographs of graphite surveillance specimens pre-
viously examined which indicated spotty distribution of
total activity.

6.1.5 Milling of Surface Graphite Samples

As was done for the five previous sets of graphite
surveillance specimens removed from the MSRE, sur-
face samples for chemical and radiochemical analyses
were milled from the five 4-in.-long segments from the
top, middle, bottom, and two intermediate locations on
the graphite stringer. The milling techniques developed
for previous surveillance specimens could not be used
because of the peculiar geometry of the graphite
stringer. A new technique was developed using the large
milling machine in building 3525 hot cells and a

_rotating milling cutter 0.619 in. in diameter. The

specimen was clamped flat on the bed of the machine,

49

10, 20, and 30 mils deep were taken. Finally, a single
cut 62 mils deep was taken on the opposite flat fuel
channel surface. Only the latter cut was taken on the
two stringer samples from positions halfway between

~ the bottom and middle and halfway between the

and cuts were made from the flat fuel channel surface

and from one of the narrower flat edge surfaces on both
sides of the fuel channel. The latter surfaces contacted
the similar surfaces of an adjacent stringer in the MSRE

_core. After the sample was clamped in position, the

milling machine was operated remotely to take succes-

sive cuts 1, 2, 3 10, 20, 30, 245, 245, and 245 mils

middle and top of the stringer.

Four blank samples were milled by identical proce-
dures in the hot cells from an unirradiated spare stringer
of CGB graphite to indicate the amount of contamina-
tion received by the samples in the process of being
milled in the highly contaminated hot cell.

The sample bottles were reweighed and delivered for
radiochemical analysis.

6.1.6 Radiochemical and Chemical Analyses
of MSRE Graphite

The milled graphite samples were dissolved in a
boiling mixture of concentrated H,SO,; and HNO,
with provision for trapping any volatilized activities.
The following analyses were run on the dissolved
samples:

1. Gamma spectrometer scans for '®®Ru, '?°Sb,
134CS, 137CS, llOAg, 144Ce, 9SZI, 95Nb, and
6000

2. Separate radiochemical separations and analyses for
898r, °°Sr, '127Te, and *H. A few samples were
analyzed for ®° Tc.

3; Uranium analyses by both the fluorometric and the
delayed neutron counting methods.

4. Spectrographic analyses for Li, Be, Zr, Fe, Ni, Mo,
and Cr. (High-yield fission products were also looked
for but not found.)

Uranium and spectrographic analyses. In Table 6.1 are

~given the uranium analyses {calculated as 233U) by

deep to the center of the graphite stringer. The

powdered graphite was cOll_ecte’d during and after each
cut in a tared filter bottle attached to a vacuum cleaner

hose. The filter bottle was a plastic"'cylind'ricai bottle -

with a circular filter paper convering a number of
drilled holes in the bottom. This technique collected
most of the thinner samples, but only about one-haif of
the larger 245-mil samples. After each sampling the

uncollected powder was carefully removed with the_

empty vacuum cleaner hose.

Before samples were cut from the narrow ﬂats ‘the
corners of the stringer bars were milled off to a width
and depth of 66 mils to avoid contamination from the
adjacent stringer surfaces. Then successive cuts 1, 2, 3,

both the fluorometric method and the delayed neutron
counting method. The type of surfaces sampled, the
number of the cut, and the depth of the cut for each
sample are also shown in the table. Samples between 19
and 29 were inadvertently tapered from one end of the
specimen block to the other so that larger-than-planned
ranges ‘of cut depth were obtained. Samples from 3 to
18 were taken from the topmost graphite stringer
specimen, those from 19 to 31 and sample 36 were
from the middle specimen, and those from 32 to 48
were taken from the bottom specimen.

In view of the fact that the uranium concentrations
were at the extreme low end of the applicable range for
the fluorometric method, the agreement with the
delayed neutron counting method was quite satis-

factory. The data suggest that the sizable variations

between different surfaces (e.g., the three deep cut
samples 18, 31, and 32) were real. Sizable variations
also exist in uranium concentrations in the deep interior
of different regions of the stringer. These values range
from 2.6 ppm at the top to 0.8 ppm at the middle to 3
ppm at the bottom. '

The concentration profiles indicated by the data in
Table 6.1 were generally similar to those previously
observed both on the surface and in the interior.
Concentrations dropped a factor of 10 in the first 16
mils. A rough calculation of the total 233U in the
MSRE core graphite indicates about 2 g on the surface
and about 9 g in the interior of the graphite. These low

values indicate that uranium penetration into modera-
tor graphite should not be a serious problem in
large-scale molten-salt reactors.

The fact that fluorometric values for total uranium
and the delayed neutron counting values for 233U
agreed (with the 232U value usually larger than the
total U value) indicates that little uranium remained in
the graphite from the operation of the MSRE with
2357 fuel. Apparently, the 238U and 225U previously
in the graphite underwent rather complete isotopic
exchange with 233U after the fuel was changed. '

The spectrographic results also given in Table 6.1
were disappointing in several respects. The sensitivities

for all species were lower than hoped. Thus only the

v,

strongest spectra (Be and Li) could be measured with
any reliability, and results for Zr, Fe, Ni, and Mo were
highly susceptible to sample contamination. While the

51

U-to-Li-to-Be ratios were approximately the same as for

fuel salt (1 to 14.5 to 8.7) for about half the samples
analyzed, the Zr results were more erratic. It had been
hoped that high yield stable or long-lived noble-metal
fission products (Mo, Tc, Ru, and Te) might be
detected in these samples, but they were not. The
finding of 150 to 2900 ppm Ni in a few of the surface
samples is probably real. The main conclusions from the
spectrographic analyses are that adherent or permeated
fuel salt accounted for the U, Li, and Be in half the
samples and that a thin layer of Ni was probably
deposited on some of the graphite surface.
Radiochemical analyses. Since the graphite stringer
samples were taken more than a year after reactor
shutdown, it was possible to analyze only for the
relatively long-lived fission products. However, the
absence of interfering short-lived activities made the
analyses for long-lived nuclides more sensitive and
precise. The radiochemical analyses are given in Table

,6.2, together with the type and location of surface

sampled, the number of the milling cut, and the depth
of the cut for each sample.

The species 125Sc, 12¢Ru, !1%Ag, °SNb, and 12" Te
showed concentration profiles similar to those observed
for noble-metal fission products (*?Mo, 12°Te, 32 Te,
103 Ry, 1Ry, and ®*Nb) in previous graphite surveil-
lance specimens, that is, high surface concentrations
falling rapidly several orders of magnitude to low
interior concentrations. The ?5Zr profiles were of
similar shape, but the interior concentrations were two
or three orders of magnitude smaller than for its
daughter $Nb. It is thought that ®5 Zr is either injected
into the graphite by a fission recoil mechanism or is
carried with fuel salt into cracks in the graphite; the
much larger concentrations of ?*Nb (and the other
noble metals) are thought to result from the deposition
or plating of solid metallic or carbide particles on the
graphite surface. The °°Sr (33-sec °°Kr precursor)
profiles were much steeper than those previously
observed in surveillance specimens for %?Sr (3.2-min
89Kr precursor), as expected. An attempt to analyze
the stringer samples for ®®Sr also was unsuccessful. It is
difficult to analyze for one of these pure beta emitters
in the presence of large activities of the other.

samples were also contaminated with ®°Co, the concen-
trations.in the outermost stringer samples were signifi-
cantly higher. It probably was formed by an n,p

‘reaction from stable ®°Ni. Its presence confirms the

spectrographic analyses indicating that nickel was pres-
ent on the stringer surfaces.

Surprisingly high concentrations of tritium were
found in the moderator graphite samples (Table 6.2).
The tritium concentration decreased rapidly from about
10'! dpm/g at the surface to about 10° dpm/g at a
depth of Y4 in. and then decreased slowly to about
half this value at the center of the stringer. If all of the
graphite in the MSRE contained this much tritium, then
about 15% of the tritium produced during the entire
power operation had been trapped in the graphite.
About half the total trapped tritium was in the outer
Y 6-in. layer.

Similarly high concentrations of tritium were found
in specimens of Poco graphite (a graphite characterized
by large uniform pores) exposed to fissioning salt in the
core during the final 1786 hr of operation. Surface
concentrations as high as 4.5 X 10'° dpm/g were
found, but interior concentrations were below 10°
dpm/g, much lower than for the moderator graphite.
This suggests that the graphite surface is saturated

* relatively quickly but that diffusion to the interior is

The hot cell facility in which the graphite samples

were milled was heavily contaminated with-'®2Eu and

- 154Ey. Correspondingly, the blank samples (Nos. 1, 2,

49, and 50) did not contain significantly less of these
activities than the stringer samples. Although the blank

slow.

If it is assumed that the surface area of the graphite
(about 0.5 m?/g) is not changed by irradiation (there
was no dependence of tritium sorption on flux), there
was one tritium per 100 surface carbon atoms. Since
the MSRE cover gas probably contained about 100
times as much hydrogen (from pump oil decomposi-
tion) as tritium, a remarkably complete coverage by
chemisorbed hydrogen is indicated.

IN MSRE GRAPHITE

E.L.Compere S.S. Kirslis

Fission product concentration profiles have been
obtained on the graphite bar from the center of the
MSRE core which was removed early in 1971. The bar

“had been in the core since the beginning of operation; it

thus was possible to obtain profiles for 2.1-year '*4Cs
(a neutron capture product of the stable 3Cs daugh-
ter of 5.27-day !'33Xe) as well as the 30-year *37Cs
daughter of 3.9-min '37Xe. These profiles, extending
to the center of the bar, are shown in Fig. 6.2.

resulted in a fairly even concentration of this isotope
throughout the graphite and must have produced a flat
deposition profile for '33Cs. This isotope and its
neutron product '34Cs could diffuse to the bar surface
and could be taken up by the salt. The *3*Cs profile
shows that this occurred. The ' 3#Cs concentration that
would accumulate in graphite if no diffusion occurred
has been estimated from the power history of the
MSRE to be about 2 X 10'* atoms per gram of
graphite (higher if pump bowl xenon stripping is
inefficient), assuming the local neutron flux was a
minimum of four times the average core flux. The
observed !3%Cs concentration in the bar center where
diffusion effects would be least was about 5 X 10'*
atoms of '3*#Cs per gram of graphite. The agreement is
not unreasonable.

Data for 30-year !37Cs are also shown in Figure 6.2.
For comparison, the accumulated decay profile of the
parent 3.9-min !37Xe is shown as a dotted line in the
upper left of the figure. This was estimated assuming
that perfect stripping occurred in the pump bowl with a
mass transfer coefficient from salt to central core
graphite of 0.3 ft/hr,* and a diffusion coefficient of Xe
in graphite (10% porosity) of 1 X 1075 cm?/sec.’

Near the surface the observed !37Cs profile is lower
than the estimated deposition profile; toward the center
the observed profile tapers downward but is about the
estimated deposition profile. This pattern should de-
velop if diffusion of cesium occurred. The central
concentration is about one-third that near the surface.
Steady diffusion into a cylinder® from a constant
surface source to yield a similar ratio requires that
Dt/r* = ~0.14. For a cylinder of 2-cm radius and a salt
circulation time of 21,788 hr, a cesium diffusion
coefficient of about 7 X 1077 cm?/sec is indicated.

Data developed for cesium-in-graphite relationships in
gas-cooled reactor systems’ at temperatures of 800 to
1100°C may be extrapolated to 650°C for comparison.
The diffusion coefficient thereby obtained is slightly

ter, is somewhat similarly though perhaps less intensely
deposited.

Ruthenium-106 was found more strongly depos1ted in
the core than in the heat exchanger and most strongly
at the gasliquid interface in the pump bowl (as was
12SSb)

Because over a dozen half-ives had elapsed before
counting, the >>Nb data are doubtless less precise but
appear similar to the ruthenium pattern.

Generally these data show somewhat higher inten-
sities of deposition than reported® for surveillance

specimens; turbulence and mass transfer rates may have .

been less for surveillance specimens.

The mass transfer coefficients cited by Briggs'®
indicate that deposition should vary with flow condi-
tions from region to region, and also should depend on
sticking factors presumably characteristic of the surface
material and substance transported. Mass transfer coef-
ficients for xenon atoms in various regions of the MSRE
were given as: core center 15%, 0.3 ft/hr; core average,
0.06 ft/hr; heat exchanger, 0.7 ft/hr; piping, 1.2 ft/hr;
reactor vessel, 0.6 ft/hr; and 0.02-in. bubbles in salt, 2
ft/hr. The same proportions between regions should
hold for coltoidal partlcles (<1 ) of s1m11ar size, shape
and density.

There is nothing in the data presented here to show
directly whether deposition occurred by an atomic or
particulate mechanism. The relative scatter of the data
does not permit us to relate them to the mass transfer
coefficients of the reglons

bulk metal serves as a measure of its irradiation history,
and the detection of $°Co activity on surfaces should
serve as a measure of metal transport from irradiated
regions. Cobalt-60 deposits were found on segments of
coolant system radiator tube, heat exchanger tubing,
and on core graphite removed from the MSRE in
January 1971.

The activity found on the radiator tubing (which
received a completely negligible neutron dosage) was
~160 dpm/cm?. This must have been transported by
coolant salt flowing through heat exchanger tubing
activated by delayed neutrons in the fuel salt. The heat
exchanger tubing exhibited subsurface activity of about
3.7 X 10® dpm/cc metal, corresponding to a delayed
neutron flux in the heat exchanger of about 1 X 10'°.
If metal were evenly removed from the heat exchanger
and evenly deposited on the radiator tubing throughout
the history of the MSRE, a metal transfer rate at full
power of about 0.0005 mil/year is indicated.

Cobalt-60 activity in excess of that induced in the
heat exchanger tubing was found on the fuel side of the
tubing (3.1 X 10® dpm/em?) and on the samples of
core graphite taken from a fuel channel surface (5 X
10% to 3.5 X 107 dpm/cm?). The higher values on the
core graphite and their consistency with fluence imply
that additional activity was induced by core neutrons
acting on %°Co after deposition on the graphite.

The reactor vessel (and annulus) walls are the major
metal regions subject to substantial neutron flux. If

‘these served as the major source of transported metal,

and if this metal deposited evenly on all surfaces, a
metal loss rate at full power of about 0.3 mil/year is

“indicated. Because deposition occurred on both the

hotter graphite and cooler heat exchanger surfaces,
simple thermal transport is not indicated. Thermo-
dynamic arguments preclude oxidation by fuel.

- One mechanism for the indicated metal transport
might have 10% of the 1.5 w/cc fission fragment energy
in the annular fuel within a 30-u range deposited in the
metal, and a small fraction of the metal sputtered into
the fuel. About 0.4% of the fission fragment energy
entering the metal resulting in such transfer would
correspond to the indicated reactor vessel loss rate of
0.3 mil/yr. If this is the correct mechanism, reactors
operating with higher fuel power densities adjacent to
metal should exhibit proportionately higher {oss rates.

 

 
 

 

 

7. Hydrogen and Tritium Behavior in Molten Salt

7.1 THE SOLUBILITY OF HYDROGEN
IN MOLTEN 2LiF-BeF,

D. M. Richardson ~ W. Jennings, Jr.
A. P. Malinauskas

The efficiency with which a dissolved gas can be
stripped from a liquid depends in part on the solubility
of the gaseous species in the fluid. Therefore, the rate
of removal of tritium in the MSRE circuits, both
intentional (in the helium sparge) and unintentional
(through the heat exchangers), is governed to some
extent . by the solubility of the gas in the pertinent
molten salts. For this reason, hydrogen solubility
studies in molten salts have been undertaken.

The experimental method and apparatus have been
described earlier.! In brief, the apparatus is of the

two-chamber type which was first employed by Grimes,

Smith, and Watson,2 but modified to accommodate
-effects which arise because of the ability of hydrogen to
migrate through metals. The molten salt under investi-
gation. is saturated with hydrogen in one of the two

chambers, and, after saturation has been attained, some -
of the fluid is transported to the second chamber. In

this second chamber the hydrogen is stripped from the
salt, and in auxiliary apparatus the amount dissolved in
the known volume of liquid is determined.

Chem. 62, 862 (1958).

Several modifications were made to the apparatus
during this reporting period in an effort to improve the
reproducibility of the data. The extent to which these
alterations have aided the experimental method is indi-
cated by the results for helium which are given in Table
7.1. These data are still of a preliminary nature. They
were taken while a considerable inleakage of argon,
which is used as a cover gas for the circulating pump in
the strip section, was known to occur.

The hydrogen data, which are also presented in Table
7.1, again display an uncomfortable degree of scatter.
We now believe this scatter to be a manifestation of air
inleakage over prolonged periods of time, with resultant

- interactions between the oxygen and the hydrogen-

metal-salt system. The lattermost hydrogen result which
is tabulated was obtained after sparging the salt with
hydrogen over an extended period of time. This run was
also the only one of the three involving hydrogen in

‘which complete removal of hydrogen in the stripper
‘chamber was indicated. However, the différence in

purity between this run and that immediately preceding
is due almost entirely to helium of a still undetermined
origin. : | , '

Shortly after the last hydrogen run listed in Table 7.1
had been completed, two hydrogen recovery tests were
performed. These tests involved admitting a known
amount of hydrogen to the xenon strip gas in the
stripper chamber (which contained 622 cm® Li,BeF,
at 600°C), circulating the mixture through the salt,
then attempting to recover the hydrogen admitted. The
fraction of original hydrogen recovered as a function of
time is shown graphically in Fig. 7.1. The purity of the
gas collected at the termination of recovery run 1 was

obtained throughout the experiment, and was charac-.

teristic of the gas collected through the stripper annulus
as well as the stripper section itself. On this basis the
amount of hydrogen collected through .the annulus
region only amounted to about 5% of the total col-
lected. This is in marked contrast to ‘the result reported
earlier! when no salt was present in the stripper

chamber; we now feel that the earlier value was grossly

in error. The important point is that we can. recover at
least 90% of the hydrogen from the stripper chamber
within a 2-hr period. Further experimental work is
currently in progress.

7.2 PERMEATION OF METALS BY HYDROGEN

J. H. Shaffer A. P. Malinauskas
W. Jennings, Jr. ~ W. R. Grimes

Accurate evaluation of tritium migration in an MSBR
will depend, in part, on estimates of its permeation
rates through the metal walls of the fuel and coolant
systems. These estimated transport rates are currently
based on diffusion coefficients and solubility constants
derived from relatively extensive data that are available
in the open literature. However, the extrapolation of
these transport rates to low hydrogen pressures shows
significant departures from their classical dependence
on the square root of the hydrogen pressure. This
dependence on square root of H, pressure at higher
hydrogen pressures is due to the dissociation and
association- of hydrogen as the rate-controlling step.
Departures from this pressure dependence at lower.
hydrogen pressures are presumed to be due to surface
adsorption phenomena as the rate-controlling event.
Thus, estimates of gas. transport rates at very low
tritium pressures in an MSBR (assumed to be dependent
on v/P) may be erroneous. This experimental program
has been directed toward an evaluation of hydrogen
permeation rates through metals at hydrogen pressures
less than 10 torrs where departures from the P1/2

- dependence have been reported.

The amount of hydrogen g which will pass through an
area A of metal per unit time is given by the relation

for the increase of pressure P, as hydrogen diffuses
through the metal cylinder from pressure P,.

The diffusion cell consisted of a Pyrex glass envelope
into which a short section (1.73 in. X 0.018 in. wall) of
Y4-in.-OD Kovar metal (54% Fe, 28% Ni, and 18% Co)
had been fused. Glass tubes connected to the ends of
the envelope in a manner which permitted access by gas
pressure to either side of the metal surfaces. The cell
was mounted horizontally within a mullite tube in a
l<in.-diam X 12-in. tube furnace. Four thermocouples
in wells within the glass envelope were used to establish
the operating temperature of 495°C and to define the
thermal gradient of the furnace. Gas pressures were -
determined from an electronic pressure meter (MKS
Baratron type 77) using two differential-pressure-sens-
ing heads having 0- to 10- and 0- to 1000-torr ranges.
Hydrogen used in the system was passed through a
palladium diffusion unit for purification. The vacuum
system was of conventional des:gn with mercury diffu-
sion and oil pumps.

In the first set of experiments, P, was maintained at
zero and the qiantity g evaluated from incremental
changes in P,. An average value for g at an average value
for P, for each experiment was determined by the
method of least squares. In the second set of experi-
ments, P, was held constant and q¢ was evaluated from
incremental changes in Pp, where P, = 0 at ¢t = 0.
Extrapolations of the data from each experiment to 7 =
0 yielded instantaneous gas transport rates at P, =0 at
discrete values of P,. Thus, under both experimental
conditions the equations defining the pressure depend-
ence of the diffusion process could be reduced to

Ing=nl1nP;+ 1n2nl/ln b/a)DK. ©)

The results obtained by least-squares regression analyses
from some 30 experiments according to this equation
yielded a value of n=0.560 £ 0.011 and a value of DK =
5.18 X 107'" moles/torr”-cm-min (limits of standard
error =4.95 to 5.42 X 107 ) at pressures for P, of 1.4
to 800 torrs. The direction of hydrogen flow through
the test cell had no significant effect on the expen-'
mental results.

Although the resulis of thase experirnents demon-
strate some deviation from the P1/2 pressure depend-
ence of g, the experimental apparatus was not suffi-
ciently sensitive for evaluation at much lower hydrogen
pressures contemplated for an MSBR. Consequently,
further work on this program has been discontinued
pending results from a similar study using mass spectro-
metric techniques and much lower pressure ranges.

7.3 TRITIUM CONTROL IN AN MSBR

The tritium generated in an MSBR must be prevented
from escaping into the environment. Some removal
(and containment) of tritium as T, , HT, or TF from the
primary fuel system is expected. However, the ease of
diffusion of hydrogen isotopes through metal (and
especially through the large area of thin metal in the
heat exchangers) ensures that a large fraction of the
tritium will proceed through the heat exchangers and
eventually to the outside world unless it can be held up
by chemical means or by efficient diffusion barriers.

7.3.1 Mass Spectrometric Examination
of Stability of NaBF ; OH

C. F Weaver J.D.Redman

If hydrogenous material (i.e., NaBF30H) can be
incorporated in reasonable quantity in the NaF-NaBF,
secondary coolant, the tritium diffusing from the fuel
circuit of an MSBR could be held up by chemical
exchange

T + NaBF;OH == NaBF;0T + H

for a period sufficient to permit its controlled removal
from the coolant circuit. This possibility has received,
and is receiving, considerable attention.

We have investigated with a TOF mass spectrometer
the thermal behavior of several of the pertinent mate-
rials. A previous report3 has described the behavior of
NaBF,, NaOH, and the products of reaction of H,O
with NaBF,. We have studied the thermal stability of
NaBF;0H and the composition of gas produced during
its decomposition over the temperature mterval 25 to
800°C..

The starting material was shown by x-ray diffraction
to be nearly pure NaBF;OH. The material began to

decompose at 90°C, and H,O was the only gaseous

product. The reaction, as suggested previously,? is
probably: '

2NaBF3OH(s) = Nay B, F6O(3) + H, 0(g) .

The H, O was shown to be free from Jmpurltles by mass
spectrometric analysis.

This reaction was followed to completion at 100°C
by constantly monitoring the effusing water vapor.
Nearly 100% agreement between the theoretical mass of
H, 0 and that accounted for by the mass spectrometer

by 2 moles of decomposing NaBF;OH. At 373°C, 1.3

7.3.2 The Thermal Stability of Nitrate-Nitrite Mixtures
C.F.Weaver J.D.Redman

A study of the nitrate-nitrite mixtures was initiated as
part of an evaluation of their potential use as coolants
in molten-salt reactors. In such salt mixtures as HITEC,
NaNOQ,-NaNO3-KNO; (40-7-53 wt %), the reaction

H, + 2KNO; = 2KNO, + H,0

(which has a large negative standard free energy
change) may afford the means to convert elemental
tritium to tritiated water, and thus provide a means to
control its distribution.

Since nitrates and nitrites are known to decompose
thermally, it is useful to identify the vapor products of
the above reaction to determine what additional species
are formed. In order to establish the needed back-
ground for interpretation of such data, the separate
components were first investigated.

Sodium nitrate was dehydrated in a Pyrex flask by
passing dried helium gas through the molten sait for

_several hours at temperatures just above the melting

point, 306.8 °C. The product was colorless and did not

‘adhere to the container. Samples of the salt were

transferred to a nickel Knudsen effusion cell. The gases
from the heated cell were analyzed with a TOF mass

_spectrometer. The only vapor products at 380 to 400°C

were NO and O,. These permanent gases do not allow
accurate pressure measurements because of background
interference, but approximate values were NO = 1.6 X
1072 torr, O, = 2.1 X 107? torr. The presence of

 

 
 

 

 

ongen-léaves little doubt that tritium will be oxidized.
The behavior of KNQO; and NaNO, is being investigated
by experiments now in progress. In subsequent experi-

ments we expect to observe the vapors over HITEC salt

with and without H,.

7.4 DISSOCIATING-GAS HEAT TRANSFER SCHEME
' AND TRITIUM CONTROL IN MOLTEN-SALT _
POWER SYSTEMS

E. L. Compere

The use of a dissociating-gas heat transfer system using
nitrogen dioxide (N, 04 = NO; =NO+0,)(? =N, +
0;), under development in the U.S.S.R., appears to
offer some interesting possibilities to the Molten-Salt
Breeder in terms of mitigation of tritium losses from
the power system. Under dissociating conditions the
effective heat capacity and effective thermal conduc-
tivity of the gas are increased several fold, resulting in
increased efficiency of heat transport and the possi-
bility of lower equipment costs.

In the Soviet fast reactor proposal,5 pressurized nitro-
gen dioxide is the primary fluid, removing heat from
fuel elements and driving a gas turbine. Thermal and
radiation decompositions are by implication not signifi-
cant, and '*C production was not mentioned. Similar
usage in molten-salt systems, though replacing both a
secondary salt and a steam system with the dissociating-
gas system, would involve the possibility of leakage of
nitrogen oxides and oxygen into the primary salt circuit
and subsequent reaction with graphite. Although such
reactions would doubtless not be extremely violent —
probably the gases would behave about like pressyrized
air — the use of nitrogen dioxide to transfer heat
directly from molten-salt fuel will not be further con-
sidered here.

For a Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor, the dissociating
gas system could drive a gas turbine, Teplacing the steam
turbine system; the primary coolant presumably would
be lithium beryllium fluoride or some other such salt.
‘Heat would be transferred to nitrogen dioxide at 100
atm or more, possibly reaching temperatures of 600 to
700°C. At temperatures above about 500°C, appreci-

60

able (and rapidly reversible) dissociation into NO and

0, occurs (absorbing about 14 kcal/mole). As the gases
pass through the turbine and cool, exothermic recombi-

Dissociating Heat Transfer Agent, ORNL-tr-2500.

nation occurs at a rapid rate until most is recombined.
The reaction of NO and O, is kinetically third order;
the rate increases slightly as temperature is decreased.
The nitrogen dioxide associates (rapidly and reversibly)
to dinitrogen tetroxide at temperatures of 100 to
200°C, with release of an additional 6 to 7 kcal/mole
NO, . The dinitrogen tetroxide can be condensed with a
fairly low heat of vaporization. (The heat of vaporiza-
tion of N,O4 is 9.1 kcal/mole at the atmospheric
boiling point of 21°C, and of course diminishes to zero
at the critical temperature of 158°C and 99 atm.) The
ease of vaporization at low temperatures and the rela-
tively high heat of dissociation at high temperature may
facilitate - the recovery of thermal energy from the
molten-salt system.

Though both NO, and NO are thermodynarmcally
susceptible to decomposition into the elements, rates
appear acceptably slow. Any decomposition of NO,
appears first to produce NO, which may decompose
further, so NO is the critical substance. The thermal
decomposition of nitric oxide as reported by Yuan,
Slaughter, Koerner, and ‘F. Daniels® and Fraser and
Daniels? proceeds by both a second-order homogeneous
mechanism for which the rate at 600°C is indicated to
be ~4 X 10" X P, moles liter™ hr™' and a
heterogeneous, zero-order reaction for which the rate of
600°C is indicated to be less than about 3 X 1078
moles/m™ hr~'. Though not trivial, such rates may
well be tolerable, depending on processing and makeup
requirements in particular systems. In any event the
heat of decomposition of NO, ~20 kcal/mole, is of the

same order as heat transferred, and there is no increase

in molecules on decomposition. Consequently any de-
composition into N, and O, would require release of
these gases and makeup, but little hazard should ensue.

The materials of construction should be stainless
steels, or chromium containing alloys such as Inconel
(or Hastelloy N) which can be heated in pressurized air
to the temperatures in question. Oxide films will build
up on the surface in the usual way and inhibit corrosion
processes.

Tritium entry into the power system would be inhibi-
ted by the films. It will become diluted by the entire

gas phase, reducing its activity. Furthermore, any trit-

ium entering the system should be oxidized and re-

tained in the form of TNOQ, and T, O vapors. These
should react relatively slightly with oxidized walls, so
little escape is indicated by permeation of corrosion
hydrogen through the metal. The gaseous T, 0 or TNO;
in the system would occupy the full volume (~10°
liters) of the heat transfer system, which thereby would
have appreciable capacitance before processing was
required. (The ~2400 Ci/day of total tritium produc-
tion is 0.04 moles/day, most of which should not even
penetrate into this system.)

Processing to remove such tritium as enters the
nitrogen dioxide system could probably be accom-
plished by various schemes, batchwise or on side
streams: adsorption, freezing, or distillation suggest
themselves. Addition and removal of H, O could readily
provide an isotope dilution effect if desired. Thus the
major modes of escape of tritium from the power
system which remain are by leakage, either through
turbine seals or into the condenser water. It would
appear necessary to prevent leakage of NO, and such
burden as it has of tritium into condenser water, and to
contain or recover any leakage past turbine seals. This
appears required in corresponding steam systems also,
but tritium is thought to enter the steam systems
considerably more readily.

In either system the diversion of tritium from the
power system implies a requirement that it be recovered
from the primary circuits. Recovery from the primary
system is not discussed here.

In summary, possible advantages of a nitrogen dioxide
power system thus include:

61

1. The ability to block a major tritium path to the
environment.

2. The recovery of such tritium as may enter the
system in a concentrated form.

3. The lower equipment costs because of improved
thermal transport properties.

4. Improved thermodynamic efficiency.

5. Less restriction on properties of intermediate cool-
ant salt, since vapor generation can be accomplished
with possibly greater ease.

Hazards and uncertainties include:

1. Routine handling of toxic or noxious gases under
pressure.

2. The question of the irreversible decomposition of
nitrogen oxides into the elements.

3. The relation between chemical reaction rates, heat

transfer, and flow rates when all rates are high.

4. The effectiveness of the oxide films in preventing
tritium passage has not been evaluated.

5. Recovery methods for recovery of such tritium as
enters the system are undefined.

6. Cost comparisons with other systems (steam) have
not been made.

On balance the use of nitrogen dioxide as a dissociat-
ing-gas thermal fluid for a Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor
appears to merit further consideration.

A study was initiated previous‘ly2 to determine the

(72-16-12 mole %) when oxide is introduced. This

information is needed not only in connection with the ,

development of possible MSBR fuel reprocessing meth-
ods based on oxide precipitation, but also because it is
obviously relevant to the determination of the oxide
tolerance of MSBR fuels. | '

where d denotes a dissolved species and ss a solid

expected on the basis of the similarity in size of the

UOQ,-ThO, are formed from fluoride melts upon oxide
additions.® In order to confirm the above presumed

where X denotes mole fractions, it was necessary to
determine the composition of the solid phase. Accord-
ingly, we decided to isolate and examine directly the
few milligrams of oxide phase present.

The flanged top with the stirrer assembly was
removed from the cooled equilibration vessel and
replaced by another top provided with a 1-in.-OD nickel
filter to be used for removing the molten fluorides at
temperature. The system was reheated to 570°C under
flowing H, and kept at temperature for 40 hr before we

attempted to remove the molten fluorides. This permit-

ted redissolution of any solid phase that might have
precipitated on cooling. Only 10% of the fluoride phase
was subsequently removed, probably due to plugging of
the - filter. The system was again cooled to room
temperature and the procedure repeated with another
filter. This time we successfully removed all but a small
fraction of the fluoride phase. After cooling, the solid
residue was loaded into a '%-in. nickel tube with a
fritted bottom, and the remnant of the fluoride phase
was forced out of the compartment at temperature
using H, pressure on the inside and vacuum on the
outside of the compartment. '

with 7N nitric acid solution at 70°C. It was then
washed with acetone and dried. Gamma counting
indicated the solids to contain 27.9 mole % as Pa0,. No
significant amount of elements other than Pa, Th, and
O were found by spectrographic analysis and analysis
for fluoride. The results of these analyses were (in
ppm): Li = 10, Be <1, Ni= 30, Cr =30, Fe =200, and
F = 1700. X-ray diffraction showed, surprisingly, that
two fcc phases were present, giving:

1. Major phase (60 to 90 mole %),
ap =5.5926 £ 0.0003 A .

II. Minor phase (10 to 30 mole %),

aa = 5.5429 £ 0.0024 A .

No Pa was dissolved during the treatment with HNO;.
Since the amount of fluorine found was quite low
relative to the Pa present, it was concluded that no
significant amount of a Pa oxyfluoride phase was
present. )

The purified oxide sample was examined with the
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The presence of
two distinct phases was confirmed, the most abundant
‘phase consisting of large well-formed octahedral crys-
tals, 5 to 25 u on a side, and the other of small, <1 p,
irregularly shaped particles or aggregates. The composi-
tion of individual crystals of Phase I, the composition
of the smaller particles or aggregates containing Phase
II, and the average composition of a large field were
measured by x-ray fluorescence with the SEM. The
results obtained, normalized to the average composi-
tion measured by v counting, were:

Phase I (large crystals), 17.5+ 1.8% Pa .
Phase I1 (small crystals), 43.9 £ 4%Pa .

Use of the above results to calculate the relative
abundance of each phase gives 61 mole % of Phase I and
39 mole % of Phase II, which is in fair agreement with
earlier estimates based on the intensities of hnes
obtained by x-ray diffraction.

Due to the marked difference in morphology of the
phases it seems reasonable to assume that Phase I, the
well-formed large crystals, was the phase present at
equilibrium and very probably is a PaO,-ThO, solid

63

rwhlch, in terms of XPa o

solution. - Furthermore, the composition found for

Phase 1 is consistent with that calculated for the

equilibrium Pa0,-ThO, solid solution by material
balance. (The latter estimate fell in the range Xp,o, =

0.13 to 0.33 depending on the value assumed for the
solubility product of ThO, and the amount of oxide
present initially.) Phase II probably precipitated as an
artifact of oxidation by impurities during the filtration
procedure and could consist of mixed aggregates of
Pa0, , . and ThO,, where x < 0.5.

The composition of Phase I (Xp,0 , 0.175), which
is assumed to have been at equilibrium with a melt
containing Xp,p, = 2.7 X 107 at 567°, gives Q13 =
94.4.

Assuming, as was the case for the UQ,-ThO, solid
solutions, that the entropy change for the exchange
reaction (1) is zero, we obtain

Xp.0.X.
log Q=2 = log (M) =1.66(10%/T). (3)

This estimate, along with the estimated solubility
product of ThO,, leads to the predicted Pa*"-0%"
precipitation behavior shown by the smooth curves in
Fig. 8.1. The calculation was performed as follows:

If it is assumed that 2.5 millimoles of dissolved oxide

Work presently continues to obtain additional Q;;
values with other solid solutions more dilute in Pa and
to test further the assumption that the Pa0,-ThO,
phase is a regular solution. The data obtained thus far
indicate that in the event of an accidental contamina-

tion with oxide of an MSBR or an MSCR, the precipi-
tated phase would consist mainly of a UO,-ThO, solid

solution with little PaO, dissolved in it.

Previous measurements® on the precipitation of Pa(V)

by oxide in molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 ‘mole %)

led us to predict that protactinium could be efficiently
precipitated from an MSBR fuel without precipitating
any uranium (as UO;) by the controlled addition of

was based on measurements of the assumed equilibrium

log Q5 = 103( PaFsg Uozl UF4) ' : 3

where Q3 relates the concentration of PaFs in the salt
phase (in mole fraction units) to the activity of
U0, (ayo 2) when Pa, Qs is present. The value of Q3
estimated in this way was sufficiently small to suggest
that the concentration of PaFs could be lowered by
oxide precipitation to a value as low as 10 ppm in the
presence of 0.3 mole % UF, without precipitating UO,.

In order to confirm that Q5 is indeed small enough to
achjeve such a selective precipitation of protactinium,
reaction (3) was measured directly by equilibrating
molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) containing
initially 0.3 mole % UF, and 0.06 mole % PaFs (2300
ppm) with precipitated Pa(V) oxide and UOQO,-ThO,
solid solution formed in situ by the addition of ThO,.
Agitation was provided by sparging argon through the

- melt, which was contained in a copper liner, with a

conical bottom, in a nickel vessel. A small amount of
CuQ was added to the system to establish a relatively
oxidizing condition and thus assure that all the protac-
tinjum was in the pentavalent state. Filtered samples of

the melt were obtained using copper filter sticks of -

for uranium (sufficient 235U was present for determi-

tinfium (by gamma spectroscopy). The results obtained
were used to calculate values of Q4 at various tempera-
tures which are shown in Fig. 8.2. In these calculations
of Qs, the activity of UQ, in the oxide phase was

we believe that this could be caused by the presence of

appreciable amounts of Pa*" in the previous determi-
nations of Q,. It was assumed in these experiments,
wherein nickel oxide was added, that all the protac-
tinium was oxidized to the pentavalent state. In view of
the uncertainty in the potential of the Pa®*/Pa** couple,
this may not have been the case. When improved values
of the redox potential become available it will allow us
to correct these data for this effect, although it is
expected that the correction will not be a large one.

~ The values of Q; and @, have also been measured by |
Mailen” but using much lower initial concentrations of

66

protactinium (100 ppm). His results show more scatter,

probably reflecting the greater difficulty of achieving
equilibrium with the much smaller amount of Pa(V)

' oxide phase present. The resulting plots of @, and Q3

vs 1/T cross ours at ~670°C, but they are much steeper,
indicating much more positive AS values and much
more negative AH values for reactions (1) and (3). We
feel that the results reported here are more accurate not
only because they show less scatter, but also because

. the resulting AS values are much more consistent with

what one would predict from estimates of the absolute

“entropies for the reactants and products.

The value of Q3 obtained by us at 600°C (0.009)
agrees within a factor of 3 with a value of 0.027 derived
from the results of Tallent and Smith (Part IV, this
report), who measured the equilibrium ,

",Pa, 05 (c) + SHF(g) = PaF5(d) + 2.5H,0(g) . (6)

This agreement is notably good since, in order to derive
a value of Qs from these measurements, we have
combined their measured equilibrium quotient for
reaction (6) with the equilibrium quotient for the
reaction

$,U0,(c) + SHF(g) = % UF4(d) + 2.5H,0(2) (7)

estimated® from measurements in a different solvent

(0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF;).

The consistency of the present results provides
confirmation that Pa(V) can be precipitated by oxide
from uranium-containing melts while precipitating no
uranium as an oxide phase. This is illustrated in Fig.

8.3 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION DISTRIBUTIONS
OF BARIUM AND THORIUM BETWEEN
BISMUTH-LEAD EUTECTIC AND
BREEDER FUEL SOLVENT

D.M. Richardson  J. H. Shaffer

The éutectic mixture of bismuth and lead (56.3-43.7
mole %) offers the advantages of a low melting point
(125°C) and zero volume change on freezing; it should
also be somewhat less aggressive than pure bismuth
toward container materials. These properties were
sufficiently attractive to merit further examination.
Distributions of barium and thorium between the
eutectic melt and LiF-BeF,-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %)
were determined at 650°C in a 4-in. IPS, SS 304L vessel
with a mild steel liner. Barium fluoride was added to
the fuel solvent salt to make 9.1 X 1073 mole % (with
133Ba). Reductions were performed by successive
additions of 0.25 or 0.5 g of clean lithium metal;
samples of salt and metal phases were taken after a
minimum of 5 hr of argon sparging at 1 liter/min.

The distribution data obtained are shown in Fig. 8.5

~ together with the derived lines (with theoretical slopes).

These lines arbitrarily pass through the log-average of
the first 11 data points. This weighting of the sample
results is based on the assumption that phase segrega-
tion in the frozen metal pellets caused the measured
barium and thorium concentrations to be low in the
later stages of reduction.® The equilibrium quotient for
barium was: Dg,/(Dy;)* = 9.810 X 102, 2.4 times less
than reported for this salt and pure bismuth.!® The
equilibrium quotient for thorium with eutectic metal
was: Dy, /(D ;)" =6.635 X 10%, 3.7 times greater than
reported for this salt and pure bismuth.!

The barium activity of the metal phase was essentially
constant following the last three additions of 0.5 g of
lithium and would indicate that the solubility limit of
thorium in the eutectic had been reached. Unfortu-
nately the sample data scattered badly, and additional

special samples were not taken. Examination of the

data points suggests the thorium solubility in the
eutectic may be approximately 1500 ppm at 650°C.

‘It is apparent from these data that the Pb-Bi eutectic
is less valuable for this particular separation (though it
is quite acceptable) than is pure Bi. It is clear that if the
low freezing point, low volume change upon freezing,
and probable less corrosivity of this eutectic are of real
value additional separation studies should be under-

. taken.

8.4 REMOVAL OF CERIUM FROM LITHIUM
CHLORIDE BY ZEOLITE

D. M. Richardson  J. H. Shaffer

The observation that cerium (as Ce®*) is partly
removed. from molten LiCl solutions by finely pow-
dered Linde Zeolite 4A was reported earlier.'® The
same results have now been demonstrated repeatedly in
an experiment where the dried zeolite was exposed,
using filter tubes, in the form of commercially supplied
No. 8 mesh spheres. Fission product processing feasi-
bility is indicated, at least for cerium, by observed
loadings of as much as 0.13 g of cerium per gram of dry

.Zeolite 4A.

The initial salt was approximately 1 kg of LiC1-CeCl,
(99.5-0.5 molé %) with several millicuries of 4*Ce.

Purifications and s_ubsequent exposures to zeolite were
conducted in the same 4-in.-IPS nickel vessel.
Numerous 20-mil aliquots of Linde 4A, sodium form,

No. 8 mesh zeolite were equilibrated to constant weight

(five weeks) over CaCl,+6H,0 solid and saturated
aqueous solution at 24.5°C. Each aliquot was dried in a
filter tube for 18 hr at 375°C with argon purge. The
filter tube was then transferred under continuous argon
purge to the extraction vessel and slowly lowered into
the molten chlorides at 650°C. Salt was then pushed
alternately into and out from the tube by pressure
fluctuations. Inflow was damped by-autopressurization
of argon in the top of the tube and was terminated
upon contact of salt with an electric probe. Contact
times were approximately 20 sec per stroke; contacted

volumes were 10% of salt inventory per stroke. Al-

though SO strokes were usually made per aliquot, no
significant increase of loading was noted from 20 to
100 strokes.

The exposed zeolite was recovered as loose’ spheres
unaltered in appearance except for a film of salt on the
surface. It was very radioactive-and could be monitored
with a survey meter. Since the specific activity involved
an indeterminate amount of salt, however, the amount
of cerium removed per aliquot was computed from
physical inventory, and the decreasing radioactivity of
filtered salt samples removed after each batch exposure.
The data obtained are shown in Table 8.1. Within the
precision of the data the distribution of cerium between
the molten chloride and the solid zeolite phases canbe

.expressed empirically by the equation

In (ppm Ce in salt) = 12.163 + 1.35 In (g Ce/g zeolite)

for concentrations down to 4600 ppm in the salt phase.

"Although an effective experimental procedure was

established, cumulative errors introduced in material
balance calculations prevented further evaluation of the

- rare-earth removal process in this experiment.

Chemical analyses for sodium in the salt showed a

steady increase and indicated, as shown in Table 8.1,

that exchange with lithium was essentially complete.
This finding is .contrary to the reported equilibrium
quotient Dy,/Dy; = 78.4 for this zeolite in LiCl at
650°C,'* and suggests that a processing plant for a
molten-salt thermal reactor would require that Zeolite
4A be in the lithium form, with 7Li. Analyses for
aluminum in the salt were several hundred ppm but

"showed no rising trend.

Zeolite 4A is initially floated by molten lithium
chloride, but filling of the void space between crystal-
lites with LiCl causes the spheres to sink to the bottom.

‘Complete filling of the void space between crystallites

would result in the consumption of approximately 0.16
g of lithium per gram of dry, lithium form, Zeolite 4A.
Molecular inclusion of lithium chloride within crystal-
lite cavities would increase this consumption by possi-

- bly 50%.! ° This consideration involving conservation of

materials would need to be included in the final
evaluation of a zeolite process. ,

Further experiments are intended to measure the
removal of other fission products, both divalent and
trivalent, from molten LiCl by zeolite. Wide variations
may be found since the possible mechanisms include
jon exchange, reaction with the zeolite structure, and
formation of molecular inclusion complexes.

9. Development and Evaluation of Analytical Methods
for Molten-Salt Reactors

A.S. Meyer

9.1 IN-LINE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
OF MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALT STREAMS

J.M.Dale A.S.Meyer

The first successful in-line analysis of a constituent in
a flowing molten fluoride salt stream is now in
operation. Automated analyses for U(HI) in LiF-BeF,-
ZrF4-UF, (65.4-29.1-5.0-0.5 mole %) in the NCL-21
thermal convection salt loop are being routinely per-
formed by our PDP-81 computer voltammeter system.

- The loop was set up and is being used by the Metals and

Ceramics Division' to study the effect of the melt on
metal specimens in Hastelloy N.

The NCL-21 loop was filled on July 20 and held
under isothermal conditions at about 650° until July
26, at which time the cold leg temperature was

established and Hastelloy N specimens were inserted

into both the hot and cold leg of the loop for corrosion

studies. ‘Analyses of the U(III) concentration of the

melt were started on July 22 and were continued on a
routine basis until the specimens were removed from
the loop on August 23. The original measurements in

the melt indicated that about 0.02% of the total .

uranium was present as U(IIT). The U(III) concentration
showed a gradual increase until-a value of 0.05% was
reached at 475 hr of loop operation. At this point the
rate of formation of U(III) increased, and the concen-

No major problems have been encountered with the
computer or the voltammeter in this system. Prior to
installation on the loop the voltammeter was modified
by T. R. Mueller of our instruments group to enable the
counter electrode of the system to be used at ground
potential. This was done to help suppress any electrical
noise that might be contributed to the voltammetric
wave by surrounding equipment. However, on occasion
the response from the electrodes has been noisy and
erratic, making it impossible to locate the E'% of the
U(IV) - U(Il) reduction wave with any degree of
confidence. It appears that this is caused by some
material floating on the surface of the melt as it comes
in contact with the electrodes. In order to eliminate this
problem a new electrode assembly was designed which
allows the salt to be flushed from around the electrode
with helium. This assembly was installed in the loop

after the metal specimens were removed. The electrode

is encased in a % -in. nickel tube, open at the bottom,
which protrudes below the surface of the melt. During
computer-controlled runs the salt enters the electrode
compartment from below the melt surface and remains
there for the time of measurement. The salt is then

flushed from the compartment, and the electrode

tration reached a value of about 0.15% when the metal -

specimens were removed from the loop.’

remains in a helium gas envelope when not in use. This
appears to keep floating material away from the
electrode and also should increase the lifetime of the
electrodes or electrode area-defining insulators which
may be added at a later time. It was hoped that this

new assembly would also decrease the surface vibrations

around the electrode. It was observed during operation
of the analysis system with the original electrode that
 

the derivative voltammogram which is used to locate
the £, is highly susceptible to small variations in the

70

height of the melt. If the salt loop is given a small push

during a run the derivative wave oscillates with the wave
created on the melt surface. The new assembly does not
completely eliminate this effect, but it does dampen the
surface wave in the vicinity of the electrode, and
equilibrium is restored within a few seconds.

After the system is started the analyses are performed
completely unattended through computer control. At
initiation of the analyses a signal from a logic circuit
that we added to the computer starts a timer which
causes the pressure in the electrode assembly to be
released and salt enters the electrode compartment. The
computer then operates the voltammeter to perform

probe.? This probe, somewhat similar to a pH electrode
in shape, makes use of multiple internal reflections of a
light beam of a selected infrared wavelength range
within the probe to direct a beam of light, which enters
the top, through the probe around the bottom and
again through the probe finally exiting in a different

~direction at the top. A detector monitors the exiting

beam. Since internally reflected light is subject to
absorption by the medium which surrounds the point
of these reflections, the multiple-reflected beam is

attenuated if the probe is placed in an absorbing -

solution, and absorption measurements are possible. In
considering the usefulness of such a device it seemed

~apparent that the utility could be greatly enhanced if
~one cut a slot (see Fig. 9.1) of appropriate width in

five analyses for U(II), and the results plus some

. diagnostic information are printed out on a Teletype

after each analysis. At the end of the run the average
U(III) concentration and standard deviation are calcu-
lated and printed out. When the run is completed the
timer shuts off causing the salt to be flushed from the
electrode assembly. At the present time a set of five

- analyses is made every hour, although the number of

analyses and the intervening period may be adjusted in
the computer program for the particular needs of the
experiment. The computer program which we have
modified to fit our particular situation was originally
developed by M. T. Kelley and R. W. Stelzner.2 As an
example of the precision of the analysis system, a
standard deviation of 2.1% was obtained for the results
of the hourly analyses made over a one-weekend period
when the U(III) concentration appeared to be relatively
stable.

One useful addition to the analysis system is now
being considered which involves the measurement of
the.salt temperature. During the first month of opera-
tion the temperature of the melt where the analysis is
made varied from about 610 to 680°C. Because the
temperature is needed in the computer program to
calculate the U(III) concentration, it is planned to
monitor an amplified thermocouple output with the
computer so that the true temperature at the time of
analysis is used in the calculations. It is also planned to
investigate the extension of the analysis system to the
monitoring of the corrosion products in the melt.

9.2 SLOTTED PROBE FOR IN-LINE
SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS

J.P. Young

A device has been recently developed by Wilks
Scientific Corporation called a “Miran” infrared

_some. portion of the internal beam path and in a

~ direction normal to the beam path. With a slot of -

perhaps 0.2 to 1.0 cm in width a probe could be made-
with a controlled "and relatively much longer path
length than that which could be realized with only
internal reflection. With a slot the optical design of the
probe could be simplified to require a minimum of two
or three internal reflections to direct a beam of light
into and out of a cylindrical probe; the base of the
probe would be prismatic, conical, or perhaps hemi-
spherical, with the slot in the apex of the prism or on
the side of any of the shapes. By incorporating a
suitable light source and detector with a suitable slotted
optical probe, absorbance measurements could be made
in any region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The

device could also be used for other optical measure-

ments such as turbidity. The design of this probe would

lend itself to a sealable insertion into a pool of liquid or
a flowing stream. It should be remembered that internal

reflection can occur only when the index of refraction
(n) of the medium through which the light is traveling

(probe) is larger than 7 of the surrounding medium (the

liquid sample). Over the common range of values of 7

encountered, a difference of about 0.5 in the two values

of n seems adequate; however, through the use of a

specially designed probe bottom a smaller difference

may be satisfactory.

By the use of a probe made from Plexlglas and using
solutions of a blue dye, copper phthalocyanine sulfo-
nate, placed in the slot, absorbance data were collected
and compared with similar data obtained from the

reflections within the probe.

9.3 IN-LINE DETERMINATION OF HYDROLYSIS
PRODUCTS IN NaBF; COVER GAS

R.F.Apple A.S. Meyer

- Earlier analytical studies®® on the off-gas of the

- NaBF, circulating test loop have shown that water can

be present in significant quantities as hydrolysis prod-
ucts of BF; in the cover gas of the proposed MSBR
coolant salt. An in-line method for the measurement of
this “water” would be useful for the detection of leaks
in steam generators, the investigation of the role of the
cover gas in the containment of tritium, the develop-
ment of methods for the removal of the corrosive
hydrolysis products before they can reach sensitive
components of the flow control system, and studies of
coolant reprocessing systems.

Conventional methods for the determination of water
in inert gases are subject to interference from BF; and
possibly HF in the cover gas. At the suggestion of
Dunlap Scott” we are investigating “dewpoint tech-
niques” for the determination .of these hydrolysis
products. We anticipate that this empirical technique

. may require extensive calibrations because the conden-

solution with a Cary spectrophotometer, model 14M.
The light source used with the probe was a 100 uwatt
He-Ne laser line at 633 nm, and the detector was a
“Densichron” phototube detector. The comparison is
shown in Table 9.1.

. | In-line applications for spectral analysis by means of a

o

slotted optical probe appear numerous. For molten-salt
. ‘ reactor applications, it is possible that an LaF; slotted

probe would be useful in monitoring protons by means
of the BF;OH™ absorption in molten NaBF,; the

\ | existence of such an absorption was reported previ-

-

sation temperature of a given concentration of “water”
may well be influenced by the partial pressures of both
BF; and HF.

In feasibility studies we are using a simulated cover
gas prepared by bubbling mixtures of BF; and helium
- through a saturator that originally contains water. When
a steady state is reached the saturator contains liquid
hydrates of BF3, and the exit gas contains hydrolysis
products in relatively low concentrations. By direct
Karl Fischer titration (subject to significant interference
from BF,) we have estimated “water” concentrations
of about 200 ppm at a saturator temperature of 45°C
and 3000 ppm at 75°C. In our experiments the
dewpoint detector is either contained in the same oven
that maintains the saturator temperature or is con-
nected to the oven through a short nickel tube that is
heated above the saturator temperature. Under these

72

conditions the observed dewpoint should coincide with

the temperature of the saturator.

- Qur initial approach was to attempt to detect the
formation of a conductive film of BF; hy_drétes by
measuring the resistance between closely spaced plat-
inum electrodes inserted in the gas stream. The elec-
trodes are mounted through an insulator (temperature
controlled by an air stream) which provides a surface
for the condensation of the hydrolysis products. At
present we have used Teflon, Teflon with its surface

modified by treatment with a sodium solution, and

high-fired alumina as insulating materials. Measurements
on alumina appear more consistent; however, this may
be the result of improved electrical instrumentation
used in the later tests. This technique gives definite
indication of the condensation of a film of hydrates.
When the probe (electrode assembly) is about 10°C
above the saturated cover gas temperature its resistance
is about 500 kS for 20-mil electrodes spaced about % ¢
in. apart. The resistance falls to about 300  when the
temperature is reduced to 10°C below that of the cover
“gas. In its present state the electrical probe does not

appear to be practical because of its extremely slow "

response. Several hours are required to approach these
equilibrium resistance values.
We are now testing an optical method for dewpoint
“detection. The design of our optical cell is based on a
suggestion of 8. S. Kirslis.® The cell utilizes a cylindrical
copper block with one face polished and gold-plated.
This polished face is sealed into an observation chamber
through which the cover gas sample flows. The external
end of the copper block is penetrated to near the

polished surface by holes for cooling air and a thermo- .

couple. The inlet stream is directed against the polished

surface, and films of condensate are observed through a
sapphire window. With this cell condensation is ob-
served within about 15 min after the block is cooled to
the dewpoint. Over the range of 45 to 75°C dewpoints
are observed at about 1°C below the temperature of the
cover gas. It is likely that this difference reflects the
difficulty in detecting the initial formation of a film of
condensate visually. With commercial instruments (not
necessarily applicable to our corrosive gases) dewpoints
can be measured to a few tenths of a degree. A
complete evaluation of the precision and accuracy of
the method must await calibration using gas streams
whose absolute water content is determined by some
alternate method. The Karl Fischer titration applied
after the water is separated from BF; and HF by
azeotropic distillation with pyridine appears to be the
most promising method. For the quantities of water
involved it will be necessary to petform the titrations

with coulometrically generated reagents.® D. J. Fisher =

and T. R. Mueller’® have designed an improved
coulometric titrator for this application. The instru-
ment has been fabricated and is now being tested.
Initial measurements on standards have shown about
1% reproducibility for the titration of milligram quanti-
ties of water. With minor modifications in the elec-
tronics and in the design of the titration cell we expect
to achieve similar precision in the titration of 100-ug
quantities, This apparatus together with  its metal
azeotropic still will be sufficiently portable to permit
on-site analysis of water in engineering streams.

A preliminary estimate of the potential sensitivity of
the optical dewpoint method has been made by a
dilution technique. When the concentration of hydroly-
sis products in a stream saturated at 59°C (estimated
“water” concentration, 1000 ppm) was diluted fivefold
with a gas stream that contained the same concentra-
tion of BF;, the observed dewpoint decreased by 24°C.
This response is roughly equivalent to that of un-
complexed water at room temperature. From these
results .we estimate the precision of the method to be
about 10% for visual detection with perhaps a fivefold
improvement with automatic photometric instruments.
Commercial photometric instruments would require the
replacement of their conventional glass optics.

We believe that the optical cell will prove useful for
various development studies and may provide informa-

In application to pumped systems, however, it will
probably be subject to interference from oil which
enters the system through the shaft seals. We will
therefore continue development on the resistance

9.4 DETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN

IN FLUOROBORATE SALTS
J.P. Young J. B. Bates -
M. M. Murray  A. S. Meyer

From the results which were reported earlier* for the
interaction of OH™ with NaBF,, it was obvious that
protons (as BF; OH™) could be detected in fluoroborate
salts. The detection limits and the quantitative nature
of such a determination, however, were unknown. Work
this period has been directed toward these latter ends.

It was found that pellets pressed from mixtures of

* NaBF30H and NaBF,; which were ground in a micro

ball mill yielded infrared spectra in which the ab-
sorbance of the NaBF3OH peak at 3641 cm™ varied
linearly with the added concentration of this species. In
a 45-mg pressed pellet the resultant factor is 63 ppm H
per absorbance unit. The method is very sensitive; much
less than 1 ppm H could be detected. It is assumed that
the method will be equally sensitive, on a molar basis,
to deuterium. :

Although a good calibration curve was obtained, the
method of preparing the samples did not guarantee that
these “‘standards™ were of known hydrogen concentra-
tion. If some of the added BF;OH™ were lost in the
grinding and pressing, or, rather, if it were converted to
some species which did not exhibit the sharp peak at
3641 cm™!, the experimentally observed factor would
be higher than the actual factor. Indeed, one such effect
was observed in high concentrations of NaBF3; OH or if
the mixtures were ground for too short a time. Under

3641 and at 3621 cm™!. The former peak is as seen for
BF;0H" in solid solution in NaBF,4. The latter peak is
at the same position as the BF;0OH™ peak in pure
NaBF,OH. On mild heating of the pellets, 70°C for 18
hr, the peak at 3621 cm™ disappears with little if any

- enhancement of the 3641 cm ™' peak. Apparently when

these two peaks are observed, two kinds of BF;OH™ are
present in the NaBF, matrix: a bound or dissolved
species and an undissolved and probably segregated

73

‘such conditions, rather than one sharp peak, two sharp .
-peaks are observed in the spectrum of the pellets at

species. On heating the latter species it decomposes to
form water and some form of oxyfluoroborate.

From the above it is seen that one particular kind of
nondissolved OH species can be identified. It is reason-
able to assume that all OH species could be observed by
their absorbance in this region of the infrared spectrum
so that their presence would be detected. Rather than
rely on this assumption, however, an independent
method involving isotopic dilution of H with D was
devised so that the spectrally observed BF;0H, or H,
concentrations could be compared with H concentra-
tions found by mass spectrometry. If one allows a

quantity of hydrogen in a particular species to react

with an approximately equal amount of deuterium, as a
volume of D, gas, in a sealed system at equilibrium, one-
should find a large and proportionate amount of H in
the D, gas. Such an equilibration was studied by
allowing several molten samples of H-containing NaBF,
or NaF-NaBF, to react with a known amount of D, gas
in sealed Pyrex ampules for various periods of time at
440°C. The proton concentration of the original salts
was determined by the infrared pellet technique using
the factor derived from the ground NaBF; OH-NaBF,
mixtures. The results of the comparison are shown in
Table 9.2.

‘The correlation of the results is quite gratifying, but
there is an attendant high blank correction.in the mass
spectrometric results that is worrisome. We have found
that the blank correction, equivalent to 10 to 12 ug of
H, is due to Pyrex; the mechanism of the exchange is as
yet-unknown. The blank is reduced by at least an order

- of magnitude if Si0, ampules are used. Further isotopic

exchange studies of fluoroborate melts contained in
Si0, ampules will be made.

 

 
 

 

 

74

Various parameters of the infrared method of H
determination in fluoroborates have been evaluated.
Too short a time of mixing with the ball mill, less than
approximately 4 min, or hard grinding yields absorption
peaks which give low results. Variation in the relative
humidity to which samples were exposed did not affect
the intensity, and therefore concentration, of the
-BF3;OH™ absorbance. Even though samples were stored
at 100% relative humidity for 48 hr and showed
obvious signs of caking from moisture pickup, this
adsorbed water was removed in the pelletizing process
at least down to the equivalent of 4 ppm H. Since a
sample of less than 4 ppm H has not yet been observed,
it cannot be said as yet whether the 4 ppm is a real
concentration in NaBF, or whether it represents the
extent of some hydrolysis reaction occurring during

pelletization. It would appear, however, that the former

view is more likely.

‘Most of the fluoroborate samples that have been’

previously melted yield proton concentrations between
20 to 30 ppm. The sample shown in Table 9.2 which
has 7 ppm has never been melted. When this sample is
melted under what is thought to be inert conditions the
hydrogen content increases two- to threefold. This
apparent affinity for H, or more correctly OH since the
species being observed is BF;OH™, coupled with the
partial immiscibility of fluoroborates with BeF,-
~containing melts suggests the possibility of extracting
OH™ from molten fluoroberyllates into fluoroborates
for the subsequent spectral determinations. Preliminary
studies using molten. LiF-BeF, equilibrated with D, 0
have shown a very small but definite transfer of
deuterium into the fluoroborate-rich phase, as
BF;0D", which must have occurred by extraction of a
species from the molten fluoroberyllate phase. Further
studies of this will be made.

9.5 VOLTAMMETRIC AND ELECTROLYSIS
STUDIES OF HYDROXIDE ION IN MOLTEN NaBF,

D.L.Manning  A.S. Meyer

Experiments were conducted to observe the voltam-
metric behavior of hydroxide ion in molten NaBF, at
approximately 400°C. Hydroxide added as NaOH or

NaBF3;0H (200 to 800 mg per 80 g of melt) produced

an increase in current over background on the voltam-
mograms over the potential range ~—0.5 to —1.0Vvsa
Pt quasi-reference electrode. Considerable noise was
encountered which is characteristic of bubble formation
at the electrode surface. This is not surprising since
hydrogen is evolved when OH™ is reduced at the
indicator electrode (OH™ + le ~» 0% + 4 H,). After a

few hours, however, the current essentially returned to
background level. This is evidence that appreciable
concentrations of hydroxide ion are not stable in
NaBF, melts at least under our experimental conditions
in which the melt is contained in a graphite crucible
that is sealed in a quartz and Pyrex envelope. Voltam-
metry at platinum or pyrolytic graphite electrodes does
not appear applicable to low levels of hydroxide ion,
since background voltammograms do not reveal any
wave that can be related specifically to OH reduction.
By purposely increasing the OH concentration, how-
ever, one can observe the potent1a1 range at which this
substance is reduced.

We are now testing a palladlum tube electrode so that
the hydrogen formed at the electrode surface could
diffuse through the palladium into an evacuated volume
and be observed as a pressure change of the system.
This would appear to have two distinct advantages; it
would be specific for hydrogen and would allow for
increased sensitivity through controlled potential elec-
trolysis. Also the separated hydrogen could be trans-
ferred to an internal proportional counter for the
measurement of its tritium content. The technique
could thus be adapted to an in-line method for *H/H
ratios in the reactor coolant.

To test the feasibility of this technique, a melt was
prepared of commercial nonrecrystallized NaBF4 (esti-
mated proton level 20 to 40 ppm). A palladium tube
electrode % ¢ in. diam, 0.004 in. wall, 2 in. long was
closed at one end and fastened to a %-in. nickel tube
riser. The electrode was immersed to a depth of ~1 cm.
The evacuated volume associated with the electrode
assembly is of the order of 10 cc. Upon applying a
negative voltage step to the electrode, a pressure
increase was observed as the hydrogen which is formed
at the surface of the electrode diffused through the
palladium into the evacuated volume. Initially the.
pressure increased from background (<2 u) to ~100 u
upon applying a 1-V step for 1 min. This is an
indication that we were definitely observing the reduc-
tion of protonic species present in the melt. After about
48 hr, however, the pressure measurements had de-
creased to ~30 u for the same potential step and time
of electrolysis. This agrees with previous voltammetric
observations which seemed to indicate that appreciable
concentrations of OH are not stable in NaBF, melts
under our experimental conditions. An addition of
~500 mg of NaBF;OH to the molten NaBF, resulted
in an increase in the pressure measurements to about
160 p.

.The results are encouraging. It is believed that the
electrolysis technique at palladium will result. in a
 

 

 

[

specific method for detecting protonic' species in
fluoroborate melts. We plan to continue these experi-
ments. However, to eliminate any effect of silica and
also to achieve higher temperatures, further experi-
ments will be conducted in a nickel cell enclosure.
Initial measurements indicate that useful voltammetric
waves for the reduction of OH can be obtained on the
palladium electrode.

9.6 ELECTROANALYTICAL STUDIES
IN THE NaBF, COOLANT SALT

D.L.Manning F.R. Clayton'?
G. Mamantov!?

Voltammetric studies are in progress in molten
NaBF, -at ~420°C. Platinum and graphite cells are used
to contain the melt which is enclosed in aPyrex jacket
to maintain an inert atmosphere. A cover gas of helium
was maintained under static conditions at a pressure of
approximately 4 psig. Voltammograms were recorded at
platinum and pyrolytic indicator electrodes (~0.1 cm?
area) vs a platinum quasi-reference electrode. The
platinum quasi-reference is supposedly poised at the
equilibrium potential of the melt. Background voltam-
mograms recorded on Harshaw NaBF, as received
showed an iron impurity wave at ~—0.4 V vs the
platinum quasi-reference. The concentration of iron
calculated from the voltammogram agreed well with the
chemical analysis of ~200 ppm. Reduction waves were
not observed that could be attributed to the reduction
of nickel or chromium. Chemical analyses gave 16 and 6
ppm of Ni and Cr, respectively, which are below
practical limits for well-defined voltammograms. We
have not yet investigated stripping techniques for these
ions. A small amount of iron(III) was added to the melt
to gain some idea of the potential of the Fe>" — Fe?*
reduction. This wave was observed at a half-wave
potential of ~—0.2 V. It appears that the iron impurity

“in the NaBF, is predominantly Fe(II). On platinum, the
melt exhibits a cathodic current limit at ~—1.2 V which

appears to be due to the reduction of boron, while the
anodic limit appears at ~+1.8 V due to the dissolution
of the platinum. |
The magnitude of the iron impurity was significantly
decreased by recrystallizing the NaBF, from 0.1 M HF
as suggested by L. O. Gilpatrick (Reactor Chemistry
Division). The iron was decreased from ~200 ppm to

Tennessee, Knoxville.

20 ppm with one recrystallization, and a reasonably
well-defined reduction wave at this level was observed.

A voltammetric study is in progress on titanium(IV)
added as K, TiF¢ to molten NaBF,. Melts of Ti(IV) in
NaBF, appear to be stable in graphite. The Ti(IV) —
Ti(IIl) reduction wave is observed at ~—0.5 V. It may
prove difficult to separate the reduction waves of
Ti(IV) and Fe(II). A Ti** - Ti® reduction wave is not
observed in NaBF, because the cathodic limit of the
melt occurs first..

IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE FUEL SOLVENT

D. L. Manning

Further voltammetric and chronopotentiometric
studies were made at fast scan rates and short transition
times on Ni(II) in molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at 500°C. The
diffusion coefficient for Ni(II) was evaluated by the
two methods. For linear sweep voltammetry, the
equation for the reversible deposition of an insoluble
substance is

i, =228 X 10° n3/24D112¢v1/2

where i, = peak current (nA), n = electron change, C=
concentration (mM), A = electrode area (cm?), D =
diffusion coefficient (cm?/sec), and v = scan. rate
(V/sec). The voltammograms were recorded at a pyro-
lytic graphite electrode (PGE) with an area of 0.1 cm?
and at a concentration of nickel of 6.7 mM. Plots of i

vs v1/2 were linear to 50 V/sec. From the slope of the
line, the value of D is 1.07 X 107® cm?/sec. Although
an unsheathed pyrolytic graphite electrode was used (7o
= 0.05 cm), the equation for linear diffusion can be

utilized as pointed out by Delahay,'? since the quan-

tity (1/roXD/nv)1/2 is less than about 0.2 at the scan

rates employed. :

Chronopotentiograms were recorded at the PGE at
current densities ranging from 5 to 30 mA/cm?.
Corresponding transition times varied from 0.76 to
0.028 sec. Within experimental error, the ig71/2 prod-
uct was constant at 469 = 0.25 X 10™* A cm™?

where ip = current density, 7 = transition time, F =

was obtained. This is in excellent agreement with the
value obtained from voltammetry. Within the precision
of the measurements, the same results were obtained

to form an Ni-Pt surface alloy under the experimental
conditions employed. Log (ip — i) vs E plots were linear
over the range ~0.5 to 0.9 i, with the theoretical slope

for a two-electron change.14 Also from the chrono-

potentiograms, the ratio of forward to reverse transition

times was approximately unity, in agreement with the
predicted value for the reversible deposition of an
insoluble substance.'* -

that this proposed MSBR solvent is more F~ rich (or

with the equilibrium quotient Q measured for reaction

10.2 SOLUBILITY OF BF; IN FLUORIDE MELTS
S.Cantor R.M.Waller

The general objective of this investigation is to relate
the thermodynamic behavior of a solute gas, BF;, to
the thermodynamic properties of molten fluoride sol-
vents. .The guiding hypothesis for this investigation is
that BF;, with its unsaturated valence (i.e., its Lewis
acidity), will readily interact with the more loosely
bound fluoride ions (often.referred to as “free”
‘fluoride) in the melt. In this part of the investigation,
we are measuring BF; solubility in the system
- LiF-BeF, ; depending on melt composition, this system
would be expected to exhibit a large variation in “free”
fluoride concentration because LiF is a fluoride donor

and BeF, is a strong fluoride acceptor.

This work is -also relevant to molten-salt teactors
First, boron, with its high absorption for thermal
neutrons, can be introduced into the fuel salt as BF,
for purposes of reactor control.* (The BF; could be
readily removed from the fuel salt by inert-gas sparg-

ture, and on the vapor space available for the escape of
BF;. BF; solubility measurements in a few melts
composed of NaF-LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF, could provide
the information required to determine how these
factors affect the decomposition of the coolant.

The apparatus and procedures of measurement have
been previously described.® Since the last report,’
measurements in four compositions have been carried
out: measurements have been completed in mixtures
with 63 and with 80 mole % LiF, nearly completed in
mixtures with 85 mole % LiF, and begun in mixtures

. with 48 mole % LiF. A summary of the solubility data

in six melt compositions is given in Table 10.2.

In the last report® we noted that, in the composition
range 63 to 80 mole % LiF, the Henry’s law constant
for BF; solubility varied linearly with the thermo-
dynamic activity of LiF. As Fig. 10.1 shows, the results

at 85 mole % LiF are in reasonable accord with this

linear relationship at 700°C; at 600° the deviation of
this point from the line may be an artifact of the long
extrapolation (180°C) of the data. The lines in Fig.
10.1 do not go through the origin, probably because the
solubility of BF; is also dependent on the activity of
BeF, ; this dependence is much weaker than for LiF,
but is certain to be of greater importance in composi-

tions where the activity ratio of BeF, to LlF is

. considerably greater than one.

‘where R is the gas constant, 1.987 cal mole™ °K™',

For the six melts given in Table 10.2, the temperature
coefficient of solubility is negative and is not very
dependent on composition. The solubility per unit
pressure decreases by about one-half for every 60°C
(~100°F) rise in temperature. The enthalpy of solution

'is calculated from the temperature coefficient of

Henry’s law:

and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin. Values of AH
are listed in Table 10.2; with the possible exception of
one solvent (85 mole % LiF), the enthalpies of solution
are nearly identical.

A second and more interesting thermodynamic quan-
tity derived from the solubility data is the molar
entropy - associated with the transfer of gas from the

vapor phase to the melt at equal concentrations; this
quantity, usually symbolized AS, is a measure of the
change in entropy of the gas caused solely by the
interaction of the melt with the gas. For noble gases
dissolved in fluorides,”*® AS, is zero or slightly
negative. Such values may be interpreted to mean that
the vibrational entropy associated with the dissolved
state of the noble gases is about the same or slightly less
than the translational entropy of the noble gases in the
gaseous state. In the case of BF;, AS, would not be
expected to be near zero; BF;, upon dissolution, should
lose some of its internal degrees of freedom (rotation
and vibration); hence, AS,, should be negative. The data
thus far (see last column of Table 10.2) give substance
to the expectation; AS,, averages about —12 cal mole ™
°K™'. There appears to be a trend in AS, with mole

) ‘fraction; the lower the LiF concentration, the more

negative is AS,. A tempting but highly speculative
explanation for this trend is: the higher the local
coulombic field (i.e., the higher the concentration of
Be?* ions) in the melt, the greater the hindrance to

rotation of the dissolved boron species (which is almost

certainty BF;"). We shall have to obtain data at
different mole ratios of LiF to BeF, to determine

- whether or not the trend of AS, with composition

holds.

10.3 FLUORIDES AND OXYFLUORIDES
OF MOLYBDENUM AND NIOBIUM

C. F.Weaver J.D. Redman._

Study® of the fluorides and oxyfluorides of molyb-
denum and niobium has continued at an appreciably
reduced level during the past six months; major
emphasis has been placed on mass spectrometric investi-
gation of these materials. Though several unanswered

~ questions remain in each case, no studies of molyb-

denum fluorides or of niobium fluorides in molten salt
(2LiF-BeF,) solutions were performed during this
period.

10.3.1 Mass Spectroscopy of Mo]ybdénum Fluorides

The thermal decomposition of solid MoF; and the
reaction of Mo with gaseous MoF4 have been described
previously. One of the reactions observed

2M§F3(s) = Mo(s) + MoF¢(g)

is of interest because the pressure of gaseous MoFg will
yield the standard free energy change for this reaction,
and, when combined with the standard free energy of
formation of gaseous MoF,'°
free energy of formation of solid MoF; . The pressure of
MoF, at 700°C (973°K) was 0.79 X 10~° atm, yielding

27 kcal for the standard free energy of the reaction

written above. From this information, the standard
formation free energy per bond for solid MoF3 is —55 &
0.3 kcal compared with —50.5 kcal per bond'® for
MoF4(g) at the same temperature. In addition the
reaction

4/31\40[«.‘3 (3) = 5Mo(s) + MoF,4(g)

at 700°C vyielded a pressure of 4.6 X 107% atm and
hence a AF® of 24 kcal. This number combined with

~ the AF/® of MoF3(s) yields AF;® of MoF,(g) of —49 +
1 kcal per bond. The errors were estimated from
-pressure calibration measurements.

10.3.2 Mass Spéctroscopy of Niobium Fluorides
and Oxyfluorides

Mass spectrometric studies of NbF, previously re-
ported have clarified the procedure for producing this
material in high purity. The literature suggests and

~ we have confirmed!? that the reaction

80

- the niobium metal at 200°C with an excess of liquid -

will give the standard

4NbF + Nb <= SNbF,

at 200°C with excess NbF provides a useful synthesis
of NbF,. Mass spectroscopic studies indicated that the
tetrafluoride was unstable with respect to dispropor-
tionation at 200°C by the reaction

NbF,(s) = NbF5(s) + NbFs

unless an overpressure of NbFs was maintained. This
instability of NbF, was not noted below 100°C. The'
best procedure for this synthesis, therefore, is to react

NbF; in an isothermal container until the reaction is
complete. At that time liquid NbFs is present with
NbFs vapor at nearly 1 atm. After the reaction is
complete, the temperature is lowered to less than
100°C. Then the top of the capsule is cooled with
dry ice while the bottom remains near 100°C; the
excess NbF; is evaporated from the NbF,4 and is frozen

in the upper cold end of the capsule. The pure NbF,

remains in the lower end of the capsule.

The following additional experiments were performed
to improve our understanding of the production and
reactions of niobium and oxyfluorides.

A study of the vapor products from the reaction of
Nb,Os and F, was made over the temperature range
375 to 550°C. Fluorine was introduced into a nickel
reaction-effusion cell containing pure, outgassed
Nb,Os. The residue remaining after several hours of
fluorination was a mixture of Nb3 O, F and Nb3,05,F,
as identified by x-ray diffraction analysis. The vapor
species consisted of NbFs, NbOF;, and O,. The
current results, together with those from earlier studies

of the thermal decomposition of NbO, F, indicate that

the dominant reactions were:

2Nb, 05 (s) + 4F, (g) = 3NbO, F(s) + NbF; (g) + 20,(g)

fluoride polymer. The oxyfluoride polymer fragment

10.4 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF MOLTEN

A_ND SUPERCOOLED MIXTURES OF NaF-BeF,
_ G.D. Robbins J. Braunstein

Measurement of electrical conductances in the molten

NaF-BeF, system has continued with a view toward -

relating the temperature dependence of conductance in

cooled NaF-BeF, mixture (60 mole % BeF;).!7 These
measurements have been extended to mixtures con-
taining 65 and 70 mole % beryllium fluoride where
conductance has been determined as a function of tem-
perature. Temperatures ranged from 540 to 329°C, 105
degrees into the supercooled region.

The results are presented in Table 10.3. For the 65
mole % BeF, mixture the measured resistance varied
approximately as a linear function of the reciprocal
square root of the measuring frequency from 10 to 80
kHz. The data were obtained with an R-C series-
component balancing-arm bridge and an all-metal con-
ductance cell, previously described.'® Due to the very
low resistance of the melts, the bridge (containing the
leads used in the measurements) was calibrated as a
function of frequency with calibrated resistances (2 to
10 ) in series with a 20-uF capacitor. The corrections
applied to the data ranged from +0.10 £ at 10 kHz to
+0.19 Q at 80 kHz. The values of resistance, extrapo-
lated to infinite frequency R, are given in the table,
together with the magnitude (AR,,_.) and relative
resistance change (AR/R_) between 10 kHz and R_.:
Also listed in Table 10.3 are data for resistances of the
70 mole % BeF, mixture. Here the measured resistances
(corrected for the bridge calibration) appeared inde-
pendent of frequency from 10 to 80 kHz within the
limits shown. :

resistance vs the reciprocal absolute temperature are

On termination of these experiments, cell constants
were determined as a function of depth of electrode

_immersion (the major variable) and melt volume in
aqueous 1.000 demat KCI solution. These will be used

to calculate the composition dependence of specific

10.5 GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES
IN THE NaF-BeF, SYSTEM

G.D. Robbins  J. Braunstein

The investigation of glass transition temperatures in
the NaF-BeF, system has continued, their relation to
electrical transport in molten alkali fluoride-beryllium

fluoride systems having been discussed before.'® Pre-

viously?® we presented results of measurements of glass
transition temperatures Tg at a number of composi-
tions; Tg’s for additional compositions have been
obtained and some of the previous experiments re-
peated. -

The lower portion of Fig. 10.3 shows a composite of
previously reported experimental glass transition tem-

peratures plus new data for compositions of 35, 70,85, |

and 90 mole % beryllium fluoride. Thesé were deter-
mined by differential thermal analysis’' employing
techniques already described.?® The open symbols

observed in plots of temperature difference between an

temperature of the fluoride sample. Duplicate values are
indicated by ticks on the symbols. The average value of

line segments connect these solid symbols. _
Investigation of a sample of 35 mole % BeF,
quenched from 850 to 0°C produced the transition
temperatures- shown (the numbers indicate the order in

‘which they were observed), the temperatures shifting to

lower values on successive cycling between 50 and
150°. Heatl_ng to higher temperatures produced very
little thermal effect on crystallization of the super-

~ cooled liquid, yet the crystalline solid transitions were

sizable. This indicates the formation of very little glass

-and mostly crystalline phase on the initial quench, with

precipitation of more crystalline material on each of the
50 to 150° cycles. Previously, under these experimental
conditions, we have failed to observe a glass transition
temperature following quenching of a 30 mole % BeF,
mixture, while a reproducible Tg was measured at 38
mole % BeF,. Hence, it would appear that, at least
under the bulk quenching conditions employed here,

the lower composition limit for forming reproducible
glasses is between 36 and 38 mole % BeF,.

~ Glass transition temperature drops with increasing
beryllium fluoride content until the liquid composition
from which the glass was quenched approaches the
primary phase field .of BeF, (the approximate phase
diagram?2+23 is shown.in the upper portion of the

. figure). Little variation of Tg with composition is

observed between 50 and 85 mole % BeF,. The size of
th_e thermal effect associated with the glass transition in
this region, however, decreases with increasing BeF,
content. While the 0.3° temperature change at 85 mole
% is measurable, the temperature change at 90 mole %

BeF, is léss than 0.1°C. Accordingly, the 90 mole %
values are less certain than the other data, and several
different experiments at this composition have been
performed. These are labeled A, B, and C in Fig. 10.3
and represent three different equilibration times and

~ two different batches of homogenized starting material.

The average Tg of 116° at Xpep, = 0.90 is probably
uncertain by +6°C. Glass transitions in pure beryllium
fluoride could not be observed, presumably due to the
similarity in heat capacity of liquid and glass. However,
since BeF, is a known glass former, it appears that the
region over which bulk-quenched glasses are formed
extends from 37 (1) to 100 mole % BeF,, that is,

including the primary phase fields of BeF,, NaBeF,,

and Na, BeF4, but not NaF.
In relating the temperature dependence of activation
energy for electrical conductance to glass transition

temperatures, one desires a Tg corresponding to the -

glass-to-liquid transition where the liquid phase is that

in which conductance has been measured at a higher
temperature. However,. the apparently small (or negli-

‘gible) variation of glass transition temperatures from

0.50 to 0.90 mole fraction beryllium fluoride raises the

possibility of metastable phase separation of the under- .
cooled liquid into two liquid phases. Among the three

previous investigations of phase relations in the NaF-
BeF, system,2%27 there is considerable discrepancy.

revealed incipient crystals of brown material dispersed
in the clear glass matrix, the number density of the

tation of the micrographs indicates little or no surface
structure on the cleavage surfaces of most of the glasses
(resolution =~0.5 u), with some interesting (and dif-
ferent) patterns from the two 90 mole % samples. Thus,
the cause of the visually observed opalescence has not
been provable by either polanzed light or electron

another®? reports a transition at about 115°C. We

therefore have measured the enthalpy of LiBF, from
room temperature up to about 40° above its melting

- LiBF,; liquidus and the eutectic in the LiBF,-LiF

temperature to complete our thermochemical studies of

the alkali metal fluoroborates.

We found no evidence for a transition either in the
enthalpy measurements or in a separate thermal analysis
experiment. LiBF, is hygroscopic and must be handled

in a dry, inert atmosphere as it was in our work and in

that of ref. 32. However, this was not the case in the
work reported in ref. 33 where in fact the LiBF, was
ground to a fine powder in the open and even heated in
an open system for the differential thermal analysis
experiments. ‘ '

A chemical analysis performed in the Analytlcal
‘Chemistry Division showed that our sample contained 3
mole % LiF. Our measured data were therefore cor-
rected for this impurity. The following equations
represent the corrected enthalpy data for LiBF, in
cal/mole:

10.7 NONIDEALITY OF MIXING IN Li; BeF,-Lil
A.S.Dworkin M. A. Bredig

The small deviations from ideality of mixing large
BeF,*" ions with small F~ jons and the larger deviations
of mixing similarly large but much more polarizable I~
jons with F~ ions have been discussed elsewhere.?? It
was of further interest to examine mixtures of I~ with
BeF,2” ions of similar size but different polarizability.
An estimate of the degree of dissociation of the BeF4*~
ion in dilute molten iodide solutions can also be made
from a study of this system. Indeed, the phase diagram

of Li; BeF,-Lil determined by thermal analysis showed
interesting deviations from ideality. The system would

be truly binary only if the fluoroberyllate ion remained

dilute solutions in Lil (Fig. 10.4). The dashed lines
represent initial slopes of an ideal Lil liquidus for one
particle per Li; BeF,4, n = 1 (undissociated BeF, "), and
for n = 5 (complete dissociation to 1Be** and 4F~
ions). The experimental liquidus appears to start with a
slope approaching the n = 5 line but then strongly
curves to and apparently beyond the #» = 1 line. Thus,
the Li,BeF, seems to show a high degree of dissoci-
ation only in very dilute solution. At the lowest
concentration measured, about 3 mole % Li, BeF,, only
about 10 to 15% dissociation is indicated. The rate at
which the degree of dissociation decreases with in-
creasing Li,BeF, concentration is difficult to estimate
because of the nonideality of mixtures of I” and
BeF4%” ions. This nonideality is apparent from the
phase diagram at and near the eutectic composition.
The much greater dissociation reported earlier in an
MSR monthly report was most likely due to the

‘presence of oxide in the Lil (~1 mole %) which may

have reacted with the Li, BeF, according to BeF,%™ +
0>" - BeO + 4F~ to give an effect similar to
dissociation. The experiment was repeated with single-
crystal Lil which, when analyzed after the melting
point determination, was shown to contain only 0.1
mole % oxide. The small halts reported at 380 to 385°C
in the original experiments were much weaker but still
present in the later experiments. Whether these halts
may be attributed to a ternary eutectic with the
remaining oxide impurity or to the stabilization of
another form of Lil, perhaps tetrahedrally coordi-
nated,>® which undergoes a phase transition to the
common octahedral one at about 385°C is still under
investigation. | ‘

Part 3. Materials Development / |

1. R. Weir, Jr.

The areas of materials research and development
discussed in Part 3 include the postoperation examina-
tion of components from the MSRE, the development
of radiation-resistant impermeable graphite, investiga-
tion of radiation damage and compatibility of Hastelloy
N in various environments, and materials work in
support of the chemical processing equipment develop-
ment.

One of the most important problems discovered by

examining components from the MSRE is a shallow
intergranular penetration into the Hastelloy N that
produces intergranular cracking to a depth of several
- mils. This phenomenon only occurs in metal exposed to
the fuel salt, and it is of concern whether it is associated

surfaces of gfaphite with pyrolytic carbon is proving
difficult. We are increasing our effort in this area by

examination of the microstructural mechanisms of fail-
ure of the sealant and are investigating other sealants
such as barren salt.

The resistance of small heats of Hastelloy N modified
with Ti, Nb, Zr, Si, and C to irradiation-induced

. embrittlement continues to be studied. We are utilizing

with a corrosion mechanism or the penetration of

certain embrittling fission products. Work is also con-
tinuing on the fission product and corrosion product
deposition on graphite removed from the reactor.

The graphite program involves an assessment of the
resistance of commercial graphites to the dimensional
and structural instabilities produced by radiation
damage. Recent irradiation results indicate that graph-
_ites can be fabricated at ORNL with behavior similar to

the best commercial graphites. This result is encourag-

ing in that it increases our confidence that we under-
stand enough about the radiation damage processes to
further improve the important properties of the moder-
ator. Maintaining low permeability (during irradiation)

the microstructures to evaluate the type of carbide

precipitate developed in the various compositions, since

there is a reasonably good correlation between the
existence of MC-type carbides and good radiation
resistance. Our compatibility programs involve deter-
mining the corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N in fuel
salt, the coolant salt (NaBF,-NaF), and steam. The
possibility of using a duplex tube of nickel on the
coolant-salt side and Incoloy 800 on the steam side of a
steam generator is being investigated. This combination
should produce the optimum corrosion resistance for
both, fluids. :

The major effort in our work in support of chemical
processing equipment involves the development of
fabrication procedures to build a complicated reductive
extraction processing unit of molybdenum. Procedures
have been worked out for most of the components of

the system. Other possible materials that appear to be -

candidates for this application are tantalurn and graph-
ite. We are evaluating these materials and a few brazing
alloys for their resistance to bismuth corrosion.

11. Examination of MSRE Components

H. E. McCoy

As described in the last semiannual report,’ Hastelloy
N components .of the MSRE appeared superficially to
have suffered very little corrosion, but when specimens
of :a control rod thimble and heat exchanger tubes were
tested in tension at room temperature, shallow cracks
appeared at surfaces that had been exposed to the fuel
salt. These cracks were intergranular, extending to a
depth of roughly one to two grains, and did not occur
on the other sides of the specimens, which had been
exposed to air or coolant salt. It thus appeared that the
Hastelloy N exposed to the circulating fuel had been
attacked or embrittled along the grain boundaries by
some unknown mechanism.

As part of our efforts to resolve the effects of the fuel
salt on Hastelloy N, we have proceeded to test pieces
from the fuel sampler and part of the control rod
thimble that were exposed to fuel salt under different
conditions. We have also tested pieces of Hastelloy N
that were exposed to fuel salt in in-pile loop 2 in 1967
and have 'reexamined surveillance 'specimens removed
from the MSRE core at various times ‘during its
operation.

Examination of a graplute moderator element was
extended to obtain more information on the elements
at or near the surface.

‘temperature’ had been exposed to fuel salt in the main

circulating stream. Other pieces available to us that had
been exposed to fuel salt under somewhat different
conditions were rods and mist shield from the fuel
sampler in the pump bowl and a section of the control
rod thimble that had been under a loose sleeve.

The mist shield was located in the pump bowl, and its
purpose was. to keep salt spray from the region where
salt samples were being taken. The sampler cage is
located in the center of the spiral mist shield. The mist
shield is a spiral fabricated of “4-in. sheet that has an
inside diameter of about 2 in. and an outside diameter
of about 3 in. The spiral was about 1% turns, and the
outside was exposed to agitated salt and the inside to
salt flowing at a much slower rate. The outside was
exposed to salt up to the normal liquid level and to salt
spray. about this level. The inside was exposed to salt up
to the normal salt level and primarily to gas above this

"level. The general appearance of the mist shield was

described previously.?

Four specimens approximately 1 in. (vertlcal) X Y% in
(circumferential) X % in. thick were cut from the mlst
shield. Their locations were (1) outside of spiral
immersed in salt, (2) outside of spiral exposed to salt
spray, (3) inside of spiral immersed in salt, and (4)
inside of spiral exposed primarily to gas. Bend tests
were performed on these ‘specimens at 25°C using a

0.006% S, and 0.001% B. The yield stress at room

temperature was certified as 53,000 psi, ultimate tensile

strength 116,000 psi, and elongation 49% for the
original material. Table 11.1 shows the results of bend
tests on the specimens from the mist shield after
~ removal from the pump bowl. Note that the yield and
~ultimate stresses are -about twice as high as those
normally reported. These values can be used only for
comparison of the relative effect of the environment on
the properties. The unirradiated control test of % in.
sheet of a similar material (heat N3-5106) did not fail
when subjected to the same bend test as the mist shield
specimens, indicating that the mist shield specimens

were embrittled somewhat. even though all of them did

The room-temperature yield stress was certified as

and the elongation as 51% for the original material. The
yield stress of the sampler cage rod from the pump
bowl was 42,450 psi, the ultimate tensile stress 93,241
psi, and the elongation 35.7%. As seen in Fig. 11.6a, the
rod ruptured below the center, probably near the
average liquid-gas interface where the deposits on the
rod appeared thickest. Numerous cracks can be seen
near the rupture in Fig. 11.6b, a greater enlargement,
and individual grains appear to have dropped out. The
cracking occurred almost to the bottom of the rod,
even extending into the area covered by the grips where
the stress would be much lower. The cracking dimin-
ished toward the upper part of the rod above the liquid

level, and cracks were not apparent at 5.5X magnifi-
cation at the top specimen grips. Figure 11.7 is a
photomicrograph of the edge near the fracture area,
which was in the liquid zone, showing the extensive
cracking. Figure 11.8 is a photomicrograph of a section
from the vapor region about 1 in. above the rupture,
and.the cracks are seen to be less deep than in the
section below the liquid level.

The control rod thimble was a tube having dimensions
of 2 in. OD X 0.065 in. wall thickness. To keep the
thimble /centered’ in the graphite moderator, spacer
sleeves were used periodically. They were joined to the
thimble by weld beads on the thimble that were
deposited through a clearance hole in the sleeve. Thus
the sleeve was restrained in the vertical direction, but
was free to move some in the radial direction. The
maximum and minimum clearances (according to shop
drawings) between the sleeve and the thimble were

Previous microprobe examination of the control

We decided to test a ring from under the spacersleeve
to see if cracking occurred there as it did in the thimble
exposed to flowing salt. Figure 11.9 is a macro-

photograph of the rupture of the control rod thimble -

under the spacer sleeve. Numerous cracks can be seen

over the entire gage length, so.it appears that rapid flow

of fuel salt is not required to cause cracking under these

~ conditions. Figure 11.10 is a photomicrograph of the

same area as shown in the above figure, showing the

exposed to flowing fuel salt. Only a few cracks are
visible near the rupture, but the spacer sleeve failed at
much lower ductility than the thimble. Figure 11.12 is
a photomicrograph showing the ID that was exposed to
the same stagnant fuel salt as the OD of the control rod
thimble and the OD that was exposed to flowing fuel
salt. There does not appear to be much difference in the
cracking pattern on the OD and the ID. The spacer
sleeve was made of Hastelloy N heat 5060. Table 11.2 is
a tabulation of the tensile data on ‘the control rod
thimble rings and the spacer sleeve The spacer sleeve
(heat 5060) had higher strength and lower ductility
than the control rod thimble, either under the sleeve or
exposed to rapidly flowing salt.

The observations. are conmstent with our general
conclusions that all Hastelloy N surfaces exposed to
fuel salt crack. The samples from the mist shield show
that the severity of the cracking is less where the service
environment is vapor or mist than where 100% liquid is

‘the environment. The specimens from the control rod

thimble ‘and the spacer showed that the degree of
cracking was not dependent upon the salt flow rate.

Some of the components were made available for
testing to determine if cracking would occur under
stress as had been observed for some MSRE compo-
nents exposed to fuel salt and fission products.- A
rectangular strip approximately 1 X % X % in. thick
was cut from the top of the core vessel and bend tested
in the same way as the specimens from the mist shield.
The apparent yield stress was 104,000 psi, the ultimate
tensile stress was 225,000, and the outer fiber strain
was 41.5%. Figure 11.13 is a macrophotograph of the
bend specimen, showing that it did not fail. This
contrasts with the failure in a similar test of the mist
shield, which had been exposed for a much longer time
to flowing salt and fission products. The peak operating
temperature for the loop was approximately 720°C,
and this bend specimen came from near the hottest
region. Figure 11.14 is a photomicrograph of the top

was attempted. Figure 11.16 shows microphotographs
of the cross section of the ring. The small cracks
extending to a depth of about 1 mil covered the entire
interior surface. It appears that cracking did occur on
the fuel-salt side of the Hastelloy N loop material when
it was stressed after exposure, even with its short
exposure time and low temperatures (545°C). However,
the mechanical properties were not greatly affected.

The first indication that grain boundary cracking was

from surveillance specimens exposed in the core. When
the third set was removed and examined in April 1968,
we first ‘noticed intergranular cracking on specimens
stressed in tension.® Since that time we have examined
more components and find that the cracking is quite

were strained at room temperature will be used to
demonstrate the cracking, since grain boundary crack-
ing is a normal process at elevated temperatures. Thus
cracks are also present in the samples tested at elevated
temperatures, but it is impossible to separate those
caused from exposure to the fuel salt and those dueto -

that the cracks were visible in many of the samples when
they were removed from the MSRE, and straining only
opened the cracks to make them more visible.

cracks in the irradiated specimen, but there are so few

that it is not surprising that we did not feel that they

‘were significant when first observed.

Similar photographs of samples removed after 22,533
hr at 650°C are shown in Fig. 11.18. By now the
frequency of cracking in the samples from the MSRE
was quite high. These samples have an enlarged section

at each end for pulling. Note that the cracks extend

along the radius even though the strain is decreasing
rapidly as the cross section increases. '

A ring was cut from the control rod thimble after it
had been at temperature for 26,000 hr and had received
a thermal fluence of about 2 X 10?' neutrons/cm?. A
portion of the stressed tube is shown in Fig. 11.19. The
outside that was exposed to the fuel salt is heavily
cracked, but the crack tips are generally quite blunt,

‘indicating that they did not propagate as the tube was

strained. The other side of the tube was oxidized by
exposure to the cell environment of N, containing 2 to
5% 0,. The oxide cracked, but the cracks do not
penetrate the tube wall. Thus this component was
heavily irradiated, but only the side exposed to fuel salt
cracked.

‘Several pieces of tubing were cut from the primary
heat exchanger and examined. One piece was strained

“and numerous cracks formed on the fuel-salt side (shell

side), but not on the coolant-salt side (tube side) (Fig.
11.20). A close examination of the unstressed tubing
showed that the cracks were visible. This is shown more
clearly in Fig. 11.21, a photomicrograph at higher
magnification. This component revealed that neither
irradiation nor straining were requirements for the
cracking, but that exposure to the fuel salt was
necessary.

We have collected the information that we presently
have on the depth and number of cracks formed in
various samples (Table 11.3). Several points seem
important:

1. The maximum depth of cracking did not seem to
increase systematically with exposure time over the
range 4800 to 26,000 hr. The depth seems to have
been limited to one grain diameter.

2. The frequency of cracks increased dramatically with
increasing  exposure time and reached different
values in different components because the grain size
was different.

3. The cracks were present when the material was
removed from the MSRE, and they were made more

 visible by straining the sample. They have blunt tips,
indicating that they do not penetrate much as the

" sample is strained.

Layers were removed from several samples using

concentration per unit area was computed by assuming

methanol—10% HCI as an electrolyte. These solutions °

were analyzed by several methods and did indicate that
fission products had penetrated the metal. A typical set
of results for a heat exchanger tube is shown in Fig.
11.22. However, it is difficult to attach much signifi-

cance to these results since the cracks extended to
depths greater than our calculated sample depth (based -

on the amount of Ni). We were able to find all fission |

products with sufficient half-lives to still be present in

detectable amounts. Thus, these concentration profiles

may not represent solid-state diffusion, but rather the
deposition of materials in existing grain boundary
cracks.

Compere compared the concentrations of several
fission products found on the Hastelloy N surfaces with

the total inventory. The inventory values were com-

puted taking account of the power history, and the

that the fission products were distributed uniformly
over the entire metal area of 7.9 X '10° cm?. The
measured concentrations were obtained by summing
the amounts found in successively removed layers.
Some samples inherently yielded better data because
the surface being dissolved was better defined. The
surveillance specimen and the heat exchanger tube were
good specimens, but the other samples- had various

“problems. For example, the sampléslfrom the control -
'rod -thimble were small strips cut from a thin-walled -

tube. ‘The edges contiibuted appreciably to the nickel
content, but did not contribute to the fission product

~concentration. The depth of penetration was based on

the nickel content of the solutions, so the measured
fission product concentrations are actually lower than
those present on the single surface that was exposed to
fuel salt. The fission products for which 10% or more of
the inventory was found on the metal surface are shown

‘in Table 11.4. There is much scatter in the data, and

there does not seem to be any systematic variation of a

particular fission pro&uct as one progresses around the
primary circuit. However, significant fractions of the
elements shown in Table 4.4 were found on the metal
surfaces, | e

‘We noted ' that oxide films interfered with the
dissolution process. To concentrate the materials that
were present along the grain boundaries, we preoxidized
a surveillance sample in air at 650°C, strained it about
half way to fracture, and dissolved successive layers. We
found that Te, Ce, Sb, Cs, Sr, and S were higher than
noted previously for samples not oxidized.

Two general mechanisms seem possible based on these
observations. First, the fission products (or S from the
salt and the pump oil) could be diffusing along the grain
boundaries. All of the elements mentioned above that
were concentrated along the grain boundaries have low

melting points and would reduce the melting point of
the Hastelloy N. Several of these elements (namely, Te,
Sb, and S) are also known to embrittle pure nickel,!!
and Te has been shown to embrittle a Ni-Cr-Co-Mo
alloy.?? Thus penetration of these elements along the
boundaries could produce a localized region with a
lower melting point and low ductility. To open the
boundary up as a crack during service would require
that this region become completely molten or that a

stress be imposed. The first possibility seems unlikely,
and the design conditions of the items that we
examined required that they either be unstressed
(surveillance specimens) or under compression (thimble,
heat exchanger tube). Another mechanism is one of
selective corrosion. The accepted corrosion mechanism
for the fuel salt and Hastelloy N is the selective removal
of Cr by the reaction

UF4 +Cr (m alloy) = UF3 + Cl'Fg (m salt).

Much of our experimental corrosion work was done at
higher temperatures, and all of it was done in systems
where the concentrations of UF; and UF,; were
uncontrolled and not known accurately. Thus, although

we did not observe selective grain boundary attack in
our tests, the possibility of its occurring cannot be ruled -

out. In fact, the grain boundaries are generally more
reactive in metals, and selective attack would be
expected under some conditions. When the concen-
tration of UF; was high no corrosion would occur, and
when it was low all elements would be removed. At
some intermediate concentration selective removal
along the grain boundaries could occur.

An example of selective grain boundary attack of
type 316 stainless steel in LiF-BeF, is shown in Fig.
11.23. This experiment was run to determine whether a
Mo coating could be produced on stainless steel to

"make it usable in Bi systems. The specimen was

suspended in salt at 650°C, some MoF was injected as
a gas, the melt held at temperature for 48 hr, and the
salt discharged. The top layer is quite high in Mo, the
intermediate layer contains salt and some metallic
elements, and the substrate is type 316 stainless steel.
The grain boundary attack is quite evident.

We cannot presently distinguish between the various
mechanisms that have been proposed. However, numer-

ous experiments are in progress to define and learn how

to control the process.

11.5 shows the results of successive analyses, using
increasing amounts of current. These data are quite
useful, but several factors limit their accuracy. The

. penetration of the spark into the graphite was likely a

hemisphere, so some new surface continued to be
included as the penetration depth increased. The
calculated depths are estimates of the maximum depths
sampled. The sensitivity of the analysis increases with
increasing current. The size of the area sampled is also
of concern, particularly at the lower penetration
depths. This graphite has pores about 0.1 ¢ (1000 A) in
diameter, and the compositions of the first samples
(taken from areas a few angstroms in diameter) could
be quite dependent upon the location. These factors
make it impossible to obtain a quantitative concen-
tration profile, but it appears that the fission products
are concentrated at the surface and decrease rapidly

Quantitative analysis of thin layers of fission products

MSRE would provide information valuable for pre-
dictions of the requirements for afterheat removal in
future molten-salt reactors. Auger electron spectros-
copy offers unique capabilities for such analyses. The
construction of equipment for this purpose was de-
scribed previously.!* The equipment has been modified
to permit ten samples and standards to be loaded for

‘examination at the- same time, thus facilitating the

comparison of samples with other samples or standards.

The measurements and analysis of data have been

delayed partially because of unexpected problems with

complexity of the spectra. ,

for MSRE sample 6 (ref. 15) but differing considerably
in detail. For example, on one sample, MSRE 7, the
amounts of rhodium and technetium are at least twice
that on MSRE 6. (Rhodium was found to be present on
MSRE 6 but had not been identified in the previous
report.) .

Table 11.6 shows some sputter profile data from
MSRE 7. This sample came from the center of the flow
channel near the reactor midplane. The concentration
of fission products is only given in units relative to the
carbon. The determination of the actual concentrations
of various elements present must await comparison with
standards. It appears, however, that technetium, rho-

dium, and molybdenum are all present in large per-
centages (>>5%) and niobium in a smaller but detectable
amount. The analysis of ruthenium is difficult because
of interference from the carbon peaks and other fission
products, but there is reason to suspect that it may also
be present in relatively large amounts in that the carbon
peak shapes are somewhat distorted. A similar situation
exists for tellurium, whose primary peaks fall at the
same energies as the secondary oxygen peaks. Although
not included in the table for this reason, it appears that
significant amounts of tellurium are also present. The
large oxygen and nitrogen peaks may indicate that a
large portion of the fission products is present as oxides
and nitrides. Small amounts of iron and nickel have
been detected on MSRE sample 13, which is from
another part of the same moderator element.

12. Graphite Studies

W. P. Eatherly

The purpose of the graphite studies is to develop
improved graphites suitable for use in molten-salt
reactors. The graphite in these reactors will be exposed
to high neutron fluences and must maintain reasonable
dimensional stability and mechanical integrity. Further,
the graphite must have a fine pore texture that will
exclude not only the molten salt but also gaseous
fission products, notably !5 Xe. - _

The general irradiation of commercial graphites and
experimental samples obtained from the Y-12 Dévelop-

ment Division has spanned a broad range of raw

materials and fabrication technigues. It has been found
that these materials could be divided on the basis of
their geometric behavior under irradiation damage into
four classes: conventional, apparently binderless, hot-
worked, and black-based graphites. At the present time

it appears that only the binderless. and black-based

materials offer the opportunity of significant improve-

-ment. Our own fabrication studies have therefore been

based on these. two approaches The first ORNL-
fabricated “binderless” graphites have now. been irradi-

ated to 1 X 10?2 peutrons/cm? (£ > 50 keV) in'the

HFIR and are stable to this level. These results are most
encouraging in supporting our general concepts as to
the ‘microscopic physical phenomena controlling dam-
age. ~ -

- In view of the initial successes of the graphite

fabrication studies, we have recently decided to reduce
effort in this area pending further irradiation results.
This permits an increased effort on various techniques

for sealing graphite against fission product gases. ‘A
considerable portion of the present -progress report
centers accordingly on improved or alternative process-
ing techniques and evaluation of the microstructure on
previously irradiated specimens. The previous materials
were fabricated in fluid bed furnaces, a technique
involving complex gas reaction Kinetics and limiting in
the size specimens that could be coated or impregnated
with pyrolytic carbon. For these reasons a new furnace
was constructed utilizing a fixed substrate, and initial
coating and impregnation runs are now under way.

. Additionally, a second look is being taken at im-
pregnation with frozen salt as a means of pore blockage.
Although there is reason to question whether the
desired diffusion rates and irradiation stability can be
obtained, the technique is so simple in application to
justify at least a cursory exploration.

During this reporting period the apparatus to measure
thermal conductivities of HFIR-irradiated samples was
completed and the first irradiation performed. A
thermal expansion apparatus which will permit accurate
determination of the linear expansion:'coefﬁcient as a
function of temperature is almost completely con-
structed. This .information ‘is desired not only for

" engineering purposes but also because of its close

alliance to damage.

Progress continues on the theoretical mterpretatlon of
damage clusters as seen in the electron microscope. The
strain field calculation has been completed for intersti-
tial aggregates, and diffraction effects for crystal di-

11

111~

 
 

 

rections have been completed. At least qualitatively the
calculations are in excellent agreement with observed
effects.

C.R.Kennedy - W.P. Eatherly

We have extensively studied the neutron irradiation
behavior of graphite at 715°C, primarily to determine
the incremental or decremental changes in life ex-
pectancy resulting from a wide variety of starting
materials and fabrication methods. Over 40 experi-
mental and commercial grades of graphite were irradi-
ated in the HFIR to fluence levels up to 4 X 10%2
neutrons/cm? (350 keV), invariably producing signifi-

112

cant volume expansions. The changes in linear di-

mensions and bulk density were the prime measures in
evaluating the materials.

The irradiation behavior of the graphites demon-
strated that all of the various grades could be separated
into four basic types of materials:

1. Conventional graphites. These graphites all consist

of materials made from calcined coke or graphite flour

as filler bonded with either thermoplastic or thermo-

setting hydrocarbons. The general imradiation behavior
is characterized by an immediate densification followed
by a parabolic expansion, as shown in Fig. 12.1. The
isotropic materials have a lower tendency for densifi-
cation than the anisotropic graphites made with acicular
cokes, and both demonstrate that the maximum densifi-
cation varies inversely with the original density. A
considerable degree of anisotropy in the densification
process appears to depend on both the method of
fabrication and the crystalline structure of the filler
particles, which usually is reflected in their morphol-
ogy. The more isotropic graphites always densified
more in the extrusion direction for extruded grades and

normal to the forming force for the molded grades.

The linear dimensional changes depended upon the
anisotropy of the graphite, the crystallite size, and the
density changes. The growth rates at fluences where the

density change was constant agreed with the Reuss

one-dimensional constant stress model.! The effect of
crystallite size on the growth rate was in excellént
agreement with that found by Bokros.?

Fig. 12.1. Volume changes of conventional graphites, 715°C.

Conventional graphites all have virtually the same
lifetime expectancy with no apparent effect of molding,
extrusion, type of filler, Thermax additions, type of
binder, or the type of impregnant. The choice of
graphites within this category would depend upon the
necessity of isotropy and other properties, such as
thermal conductivity, mechanical properties, and coeffi-
cient of thermal expansion.

2. Apparently binderless graphites. The raw materials
and the fabrication procedures for most of these
graphites are proprietary. They are characterized by an

apparently binderless single-phase microstructure with a

fairly fine optical domain size. These graphites are all
very isotropic, have a high coefficient of thermal
expansion, and generally have a lower crystallite size
than the conventional materials. 7

Their irradiation behavior- shown in Fig. 12.2 is
characterized by a delay or an elimination of the
densification process, yielding a more dimensionally

‘stable graphite with about twice the lifetime of the

conventional graphites. The linear dimensional changes
are isotropic, reflecting only the bulk density changes.
Thus, the individual crystallite growth rates cannot be
calculated dlrectly from extrapolated orientation de-
pendence.

graphites.

3. Hot-worked and mesophase graphites. These
graphites by virtue of hot working are highly aniso-
tropic. Although the original densities may not be very
high, the void structure for densification has apparently
been eliminated by the hot working. None of these
materials densified under irradiation, as shown in Fig.
12.3. The volume remained constant for a short period
and then began to expand parabolically with fluence.
The life expectancy of these grades is similar to that of
the conventional grades; however, the linear di-
mensional changes are quite large due to the anisotropy
and would not be acceptable for most designs. The
linear dimensional behavior, excluding density changes
can be represented by the Reuss model.

4. Carbon-black grades. These are grades in which all
the filler is a carbon black. They are characterized by a
structure of randomly oriented, ultrafine optical do-
mains with no anisotropy and a fairly small crystallite
size. The coefficient of thermal expansion is generally
large, the thermal conductivity is low, and the mechani-
cal properties are fairly good for the generally low
bulk density. The densification due to irradiation is
quite rapid, as shown in Fig. 12.4, possibly reflecting
high negative crystalline growth rates. The expansion
after densification, unlike that for all other materials, is
linear with fluence and seems to be independent of
grade and heat treatment. The initial increase in
density, however, depends upon final heat treatment
temperature, as shown in Fig. 12.5, and there is some

evidence ‘that the densification is binder-dependent as
well. These materials are all isotropic, and the linear
~dimensional changes are again a result only of bulk
density changes. The lifetime expectancy of these
materials is equal to or greater than that of the
apparently binderless grades, such as represented by
Poco-AXF in Fig. 12.4. |

It appears, therefore, that graphite w1th improved

- lifetimes may be developed from either the apparently

binderless graphites, carbon-black grades, or from com-
binations of the two. The disadvantage of the low
thermal conductivity of the carbon-black grades can be
moderated by combinations of green coke and carbon-
black filler materials. Also, as discussed in an earlier
rteport,® the addition of carbon blacks to green filler

The various -grades of carbé\n and graphite that we
have received since January 1, 1971, are summarized in

coke as the filler with and without Thermax additions,
and with coal-tar pitches 15V and 350 as binders. The
densities were reasonable; however, the structures con-
tained a fine network of lamellar voids normal to the
molding direction. This structural fault has been elimi-
‘nated in newer moldings. The results to maximum

of 1.87 g/cm®, but the remainder have apparent
densities from 1.79 to 1.47 g/cm®. On this basis, they
are not outstanding; however, they generally represent
some special parameter(s).

The first four grades listed in Table 12.1 represent
studies primarily on isotropic fillers bonded with
synthesized, experimental bmders of acenaphthylene
and isotruxene.

The graphlte-ﬁber-remforced-grade PTE is not - ex-
pected to have any potential as a moderator material,
but it may be useful as a high-temperature structural
material in regions of low flux. : '

- Grade A680 is the low-fired lampblack-base materlal
that we had requested to replenish our supply of this
material to continue our studies previously reported.?

Grade Q322 is similar to the previously described
graphitized lampblack grade A671. Grade Q322 is a
short section from a 7%-in.-diam cylinder and was
offered as physical evidence that base stock sizes as

116

required by the MSBE can be fabricited using a

lampblack filler.

Grade A676 is grade A681, the graphitized lamp-
~ black-base body we have been studying, that has been
impregnated to change the nominal apparent densities
from 1.60 to 1.87 g/cm?.

The grade JA-5 is in the early stages of development

interest. We continue to determine these parameters on
newly fabricated bodies made at both ORNL and the
Y-12 installations, as well as potential new grades that
are received from the manufacturers. _
Three samples of mesophase graphite were received
for evaluation. The x-ray-determined crystalline pre-
ferred orientation parameters are shown in Table 12.2.

It was thought that the mesophase bodies should be

as grade JM-15.

The series of grades R18, R20, and R24 represents
the start of a study with varying amounts of pitch
binder with an isotropic filler made from calcined

nearly isotropic; however, this is not the case.

The ACF4Q is a low-fired Poco grade that has not
been above 1400°C and is the starting material for the
AXF grade. Three sphere samples were cut with their
axes mutually perpendicular, and the results are shown

Arrangements have been essentially completed to
obtain specimens of carbon materials from Poco Graph-
ite, Inc., spanning the temperature range 1400 to
2500°C. The low-fired materials would be grade AXF
precursor fired to 1400, 1800, 2000, 2200, and
2500°C. We plan to extend the temperature range to
3000°C by refiring a Poco-supplied stock piece (fired
to 2500°C) to 3000°C and machining specimens from
it. Since these specimens represent material at inter-
mediate stages of a production process, certain agree-
ments are being arranged to protect their proprietary
position.

The purpose’ of the experiment is to take the most
stable graphite known to us and examine the effect of
heat treatment on its behavior. Both the plasticity and
crystalline size are sharp functions of heat treatment
temperatures, and both are believed to be important in
determining the lifetime of graphite under irradiation.
The resulting. data, aside from their intrinsic interest,
will also afford a qualitative check of our proposed
radiation damage model.

We have received a graphite flour, grade 1074 (~23.0
kg), from the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation. This
material is slightly anisotropic. It is being evaluated for
use in both the Molten-Salt Reactor and High-
Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor Programs.

determined independently the anisotropy value in each
of the three directions. A sample of the same grade but

a different block was submitted by L. G. Overholser of

Y-12. The results obtained from these samples are listed
in ‘Table 12.2. The anisotropy values indicate that the
material was fabricated by. molding and that the axis of
sample S-1 is parallel with the fabrication axis. The axis
of Overholser’s sample was also parallel with the
fabrication axis but had a greater degree of anisotropy.
This indicates either a nonuniformity in the graphite or
it came from a position in the block near the end where
die effects, if any, would be greatest. There was some
question as to the maximum temperature to which JA-5
had been; therefore, all four samples were fired at
2800°C for 1 hr. The anisotropy values-obtained from
the fired samples are within experimental error of those
in Table 12.2.

Each of the other grades of graphite reported in Table
12.2 has been around for some time, but anisotropy
values had not been determined.. These samples with
axes mutually perpendicular were used to determine the
anisotropy values independently in the three directions.
One of the samples of HS-17A had a high density, and
so a sphere was machined on each end of a l-in.-long
sample. The sample marked A2 was the sphere having
the higher density and has a much different anisotropy
value than the Al sample. This apparently came from
near the surface where impregnation effects would be
most pronounced.

The sum of the three independently determined R
values for each grade is very near the theoretical value
of 2.0, but there is some variation due to the
inhomogeneities of the graphite.

We are ‘also studying the effects of firing different

graphites and filler particles to successively higher

-temperatures. These will be reported in the near future.

applications, it is not surprising that their permeabilities
Ky, are relatively high. These were determined on
l-in.-diam disks from 0.1 to 0.5 in. thick that were
machined with specific orientations from their starting
stock. Grades HL-18, ATJS-G, HS-82, ATIJS, and
AXF-5QBG illustrate how the permeability value varies
with orientation and specimen location.

. The isotropic Poco grades have been ‘given .more
attention because the AXF series have shown the most
resistance to fast neutron damage at 715°C. To more
clearly show the permeability variations from grade to
grade .and within a grade, the helium permeabilities Ky

~ are plotted vs mean pressures in Fig. 12.8 for grades

AXZ-5Q, AXM-5Q, AXF-5Q, and AXF-5QBG. The first

‘three grades are standard materials that represent

different ranges of bulk densities, and AXF-5QBG is an

119

an order of magnitude more permeable to helium than
grades AXM-5Q and AXF-5Q. The latter two are not
much different from each other based on these few
measurements.

Data for grade AXF-5QBG for several specimens were
plotted to show the effect of the impregnation, and
that even though the material is relatively uniform, like
all grades of graphite, it can vary appreciably in
localized zones. The latter is illustrated in Fig. 12.8 by
the results obtained on specimens 831 and 832 that
were machined from the same block. The impregnation
appears to reduce the permeability of grade AXF-5Q by
one to two orders of magnitude.

12.6 REDUCTION OF GRAPHITE PERMEABILITY
BY PYROLYTIC CARBON SEALING

C.B.Pollock W.P. Eatherly

Graphite to be used in the core of an MSBR must be
able to exclude fluoride salts and gaseous fission
products. We have been studying techniques to seal the
surface of the graphite with pyrolytic carbon. Two
techniques have been used: a vacuum-pulse impregna-
tion technique in which surface pores of the graphite
are closed by plugging them with pyrolytic carbon and
a coating procedure in which a continuous surface
coating of impermeable pyrolytic carbon is deposited
on the graphite. Both techniques have been successful
in sealing commercially available graphite suitable for
use in the core of an MSBR.

In conjunction with the fabrication program a con-
comitant irradiation testing program is being conducted

- in which graphite samples sealed with pyrolytic carbon

impregnated, graphitized version of AXF-5Q. All were

fabricated from fillers having a maximum particle size
of 0.001 in. (ref. 7). In Fig. 12.8 and from Table 12.3 it
is interesting to note that grade AXZ-5Q is more than

ite, Inc., Decatur, Texas.

are subjected to MSBR conditions of neutron fluence
and temperature. A HFIR irradiation experiment con-
taining a number of coated samples and impregnated
samples was recently completed. This experiment con-

‘tained 10 graphite samples coated with pyrolytic

carbon and 12 graphite samples that were impregnated
with pyrolytic carbon.

. Tuning first to the coated samples, four of these have |
been cycled twice through HFIR and now have a total
neutron dose of 2.4 X 10?2 neutrons/cm?® (E > 50
MeV) at a temperature of 700°C. Three of the samples
appeared to be intact except for some small cracks on
their ends, but independent of this, the helium perme-
abilities went from less than 1072 to greater than 1072
cm?/sec. The remaining sample was extensively cracked
over its entire surface. A second set of coated samples
has been cycled through HFIR for the first time and
received total neutron doses of up to 1.3 X 1022
neutrons/cm? (E > 50 MeV) at 700°C. Five of these
 

 

120

samples cracked badly and had helium permeabilities of |

greater than 1072 cm?/sec. However, one of the
samples appeared to be unaffected by the experiment.

The only significant differénce between these two sets
of coated samples is the coating thickness. The first

group had coating thicknesses ranging from 4 to 6 mils; .

the second set had coating thicknesses of 2 to 3 mils.
The one sample of the second set that survived had a
coating that was 3 mils thick. Coating thickness and
microstructure are the significant variables, but further
work will be required to determine if satlsfactory
coatings can be devised.

The results on the 12 pyrolytlcally 1mpregnated
samples are given in Table 12.4. Six of these have been
recycled in HFIR to fluences of up to 3.7 X 1022; six

 new samples have received only their first irradiation up

to 1.2 X 10?2, The new samples appear to be
significantly - better than previous samples irradiated to
similar fluences. The pore size distribution of these
samples will be examined by mercury porosimetry. The
amount of pyrolytic carbon required for sealing can be
controlled by varying process parameters. Helium per-
meabilities of less than 107% cm?/sec have been

obtained in graphite samples whose weight increase was -

less than 4% with a processing time of only 2 hr at
750°C. Graphite samples sealed in this manner should
behave more like unimpregnated base stock graphite. A
number of samples containing the minimum amount of
carbon needed for sealing has been prepared for the
next experiment in an attempt to control the neutron-
induced expansion of the graphite.

As noted in Table 12.4, one of the samples has
increased its length by 11%, or substantially more than

would be expected from the unimpregnated base stock
graphite at similar fluences. _
Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasi-

bility of coating graphite with pyrolytic carbon. -

Samples have been prepared in fluid bed furnaces

designed for coating spherical fuel particles. The small

graphite samples were suspended in a bed of inert

particles that were levitated by a flow of helium. Then

the gaseous hydrocarbon was infected 'and cracked at
various temperatures, and the graphite sample was
coated in the same manner as the spherical particles.
Dense isotropic coatings of pyrolytic carbon tightly
bonded to the samples were obtained in this fashion;
however, this would clearly be a difficult technique to
use on large graphite tubes or cylinders.

A carbon resistance furnace has been built for coating
experiments with larger graphite samples. This furnace
is similar to conventional fluid bed coating furnaces but
will permit the investigation of depositing dense iso-
tropic pyrolytic carbon on a fixed substrate by altering
such variables as gas flow, gas mixture, and bed

condition. The furnace is complete, and samples are

being prepared for coating.

12.7 THE MAGNIFIED TOPOGRAPHY
OF GRAPHITE SEALED WITH
PYROLYTIC CARBON

W. H. Cook

We have begun a detailed characterization of the
graphite grades sealed with pyrocarbon. The objectives
are to learn more about the pyrocarbon-sealing tech-
niques and to determine what produces a pyrocarbon
seal that has the maximum resistance to damage by fast
neutrons.

Parts of the early phases of this work are evaluatlons
of the various.techniques available for characterization
of the pyrocarbon sealants. The scanning electron
microscope (SEM)-is one of the potential tools for this
work. A preliminary examination of the surfaces of
unirradiated grade AXF specimens of graphite ma-
chined in the shape of HFIR specimens, 0.128 in. ID by
0.400 in. OD by 0.500 in. long, has been made with an
SEM.? One specimen was as-machined, and the other
had been impregnated with pyrocarbon from butadiene
at 750°C and heat treated at 1650°C.

The examination of the as-machined specimen shown
in Fig. 12.9a suggests a tearing of the filler particles
more than a cutting operation. At this magnification of
2000X, the surfaces appear to be mosaic of irregular-
shaped, equiaxed particles. In:Fig. 12.95, at the same

magnification, the surfaces of the pyrocarbon-sealed .

specimen showed that pyrocarbon covered the exposed
filler particles so that they now had sphere-like shapes
and appeared to be a surface composed of closely
stacked, rough spherules. Since the sealing with the
pyrocarbon was designed to be an impregnation rather
than a surface coating, the latter surface appearance is
not illogical. s

There are some charging-up effects observable in Fig.
12.9 that might have been eliminated or reduced by
coating the specimens with a thin film of metal prior to

their examination with the SEM. We did not do this
“because such an operation would be impractical in our -

future work with irradiated specimens that we periodi-
cally examine and recycle for additional radiation.

This SEM work indicates promise; however, addi-
tional work with it remains to be done in order to
evaluate it and apply it to our objectives.

12.8 REDUCTION OF PERMEABILITY
BY FLUID IMPREGNATION

W. H. Cook

It has been proposed® that unfueled salt impregnated
into the accessible pores of graphite may be a practical
way of reducing its gas permeability. Preliminary tests -
with an analog impregnation with bismuth and unfueled
salt impregnation indicate that helium permeability of a
permeable graphite can be reduced to the range of 107°
cm? [sec. Additional studies are required to determine
the practical limits for reducing permeabilities by this
technique and to evaluate the effectiveness of such fluid

impregnations for reduclng ﬁssmn gas penetration into
the graphite.

In an analog test using 1mpregnatlon by blsmuth
(which expands on freezing) instead of molten salt, the
helium permeability was decreased two to five orders of
magnitude, depending on the grade of graphite used.’
The lowest permeability values were in the 107°
cm?[sec range. Apparently, there were enough <0.25-
um pore entrance diameters that were not impregnated
to prevent the permeability from attaining the desired
‘range of <10™® cm?/sec.

Prior to the early shutdown of the MSRE, we had
planned to determine the actual effect of an unfueled
salt impregnant on graphite from the standpoints of the
reduction of gas. permeabilities and gaseous fission

products penetration into the graphite in the MSRE

environment. To do this, we impregnated evacuated
specimens of grade AXF-5Q graphite with NaF-BeF,
- (66-34 mole %) under a pressure of 200 psi at 705°C.
This should have caused pore ‘entrances down to
approximately 0.5 pm in diameter to be filled. Equip-
ment limitations for the required -salt temperature
prevented our using enough pressure to penetrate pore
entrance diameters down to approximately 0.25 um as
was done in the analog test with the bismuth. The
permeability values for the bismuth- and the salt-
impregnated specimens are compared with their con-
trols in Table 12.5. The higher permeability of the

salt-impregnated specimen over the bismuth-impreg-
nated specimen is probably due to the shrinkage that
occurs in the salt when it freezes. This is supported by
the facts that the pore entrance diameéters of the
unimpregnated grades AXF and AXF-5Q are concen-
trated at 1 u, and there is a larger viscous component of
gas flow for the specimen impregnated with the frozen
salt vs the one impregnated with frozen bismuth. The
freezing of the salt apparently makes available porosity
that has relatively large effective pore diameters com-
pared with those remaining in the bismuth-impregnated
specimen. The salt in the molten state should seal

against helium flow as well as the frozen bismuth.

~ Additional studies are required to determine (1) the
practical limits for reducing gas permeabilities by this

technique and (2) the diffusion rates of fuel salt

components into the impregnant(s). The final gas
permeability values attained will determine the effec-
tiveness of such impregnations for reducing fission gas

penetration into the graphite. Xenon-135, which has a .

high cross section for thermal neutrons, is the fission gas

of primary concern. Uranium (or plutonium) and
salt-soluble fission product migration into the impreg-

nants wﬂl be the primary concerns in the diffusion rate
studies. o :

to the formation of visible spot-type damage structure
in relatively short times. Studies of the contrast of the
defect clusters for various diffraction conditions have
shown that the defects are dislocation loops of inter-
stitial type. In dark-field micrographs as in Fig. 12.10,
the damage clusters frequently appear as both black and
white spots in roughly equal numbers.'® This black and
white contrast is found to be quite sensitive to the
diffraction condition, that is, the deviation from the
Bragg condition. Stereoscopic study of this structure

with variation of the diffraction condition has been
found to be consistent with and hence attributable to
the stacking fault present in the prismatic dislocation
loop formed by the clustering of interstitial atoms.
Figure 12.11a shows the intensity of the diffracted
beam as a function of the position of a stacking fault in
a 2300-A-thick graphite crystal. The oscillation of the
intensity with depth about the perfect crystal value
(dashed line) predicts three layers of dark (black) spots
and two. layers of light (white) spots as has been
observed experimentally.

Other aspects of the contrast of these defect clusters,
although qualitatively consistent with. the behavior
expected of interstitial-type dislocation loops, suggest
that the strain contrast is less than would be expected
on the basis of diffraction contrast theory employing:

theory. In order to clarify this matter, the stress and

displacement fields for a circular prismatic dislocation
loop have been derived using anisotropic elasticity
theory. The results indicate that the overall effect of
crystal anisotropy is to reduce the stress and displace-
ment fields around the loop by about an order of
magnitude, except for the component of displacement
normal to the loop plane which is increased by about a
factor of 2. These results appear reasonable when one

_considers the nature of chemical bonds in graphite,

which calls for a strong covalent bonding in the basal

plane compared with a weak van der Waals-type

bonding across the basal plane. When a dislocation loop

is created between basal planes, the crystal expands
more readily along the ¢ axis giving rise to large atomic
displacements in this direction. In the basal plane,
graphite is elastically too rigid to accommodate appre-
ciable dlsplacement '

On the basis of the anisotropic elasticity theory of
atomic displacements around a dislocation loop, calcu-
lations of image contrast in the electron microscope
have been carried out in the IBM-360 computer. It is
found that the crystal anisotropy does influence the
intensity and apparent size of the image of a dislocation
loop. Figure 12.115 shows the calculated diffracted
intensity at the exit surface of the specimen for the
central region of a loop as a function of the position of
the loop in a specimen for diffraction conditions similar
to those present in' Fig. 12.10. The variation of the
intensity relative to the perfect crystal value is similar
to that for the stacking fault alone (Fig. 12.11a),
indicating that the stacking fault:is dominant in
determining the contrast for the conditions considered

here. Experiments and calculations are currently being

made to examine more closely the agreement between
observed and calculated contrast.

13. Hastelloy N

H. E. McCoy

The search for a chemically modified composition of
Hastelloy N with improved resistance to irradiation
damage continues. The elements of primary concern are
Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr, Si, and C. We continue to approach the
problem by initially making small laboratory melts and
then procuring 50- to 100-lb commercial melts. This
gives us some feel for the problems that will be
encountered in scaleup of these alloys to production
size (10,000 1b or greater). This work involves mechan-
ical property studies on unirradiated and irradiated
samples. |

Our compatibility programs are involved with the
corrosion of Hastelloy N in several fluoride salts and in
steam. The salt of primary concern is the new proposed
coolant salt, sodium  fluoroborate. Several thermal
convection and two pump loops are committed .to
studying corrosion in this salt. Steam corrosion work
continues at two facilities. Hastelloy N is currently
being exposed in the unstressed and stressed conditions.

13.1 ELECTRON MICROSCOPY STUDIES
R.E.Gehlbach  S.W.Cook-

Our studies of the effects of alloying additions on the
microstructures in modified Hastelloy N at elevated
temperatures have concentrated in three primary areas.
The first area consists of the effects of Hf, as a sole
addition or in combination with Ti and Nb, on carbide
precipitation. These ‘studies have included variable
concentrations of C and Si and both laboratory and
small commercial melts. We have achieved a reasonable
understanding of precipitation processes in laboratory
heats containing Hf; however, its effect in commercial
alloys is not clear.

The second area of interest deals with the precipita-
tion of NiyTi in titanium-modified Hastelloy N. Recent
observations indicate that a Ti concentration of about
2% may provide good resistance to irradiation embrit-
tlement at 700°C and higher. We are concerned whether
this amount of Ti will promote the formation of Ni; Ti
at various temperatures. Precipitation of this inter-
metallic dramatically increases the strength, but causes
embrittlement.

The last area of study reported deals with preliminary
observations of strain-induced precipitation in modi-
fied alloys. Carbides which precipitate during a creep-
rupture test are different in morphology and distri-
bution from those generated during short-term tensile
tests or elevated temperature exposure in the absence of
strain.

bides are somewhat coarser (0.3 to 0.5 um) in the more
highly modified series. In addition, a very small amount

‘of MC carbide precipitates in the stacking fault mor-
. phology previously observed in the titanium-modified

 

alloys. This stacking fault precipitate (SFP) is much
finer in the alloys modified with Hf-Ti-Nb than in those
modified with Ti alone. In general, the SFP only occurs
in the interior of grains.

Aging at the lower temperature of 650°C results in
finer matrix precipitates than at 760°C. Thin platelets
are generally formed at 760°C (Fig. 13.22), and
particles and thick platelets are formed at 650°C (Fig.

13.2b). The amount of precipitate is considerably -

higher at 650°C than at 760°C, and formation of SFP is
much more prevalent at 650°C. In addition, a disper-
sion of very fine carbides (<200 A) is observed

throughout the matrix after aging at 650°C (not
resolvable in Fig. 13.24). These extremely fine precipi-
tates are also present in alloys modified only with
hafnium after exposure at 650°C.

Effect of carbon concentration. The effect of carbon
concentration on precipitation in the Hf-Ti-Nb series is
shown in Figs. 13.2 to 13.4. The microstructures of an
alloy with 0.008% C (alloy 331) after aging 1000 hr at
760 and 650°C are shown in Fig. 13.3. The matrix
carbides are slightly smaller at 760°C (Fig. 13.34) than

those in the alloy with the nominal 0.05% C (Fig.

13.2a), but are present in a much lower concentration.
Grain boundary carbides are very numerous, however.

- A high density of very fine carbides is present after

exposure at 650°C (Fig. 13.3b). With 0.014% C (alloy
332) the microstructure after aging at 760°C is similar
to that of the very low carbon alloy, but with more
carbides present.

Increasing the carbon concentration above the
standard (0.05%) level generally results in fewer but
coarser carbides. The microstructures of an alloy
containing 0.14% carbon (alloy 335) after aging at 760
and 650°C are shown in Fig. 13.4. Large primary
carbides of the M,C type are present at both tempera-
tures. The characteristic matrix MC carbide is virtually
absent at 760°C but is present in relatively high
concentrations at 650°C. Its occurrence is generally
limited to large-grained areas which do not contain large
quantities of M,C. The MC carbide is coarser than that

YE-10361

formed at 650°C in heats containing lower carbon
levels. A carbon concentration of 0.087% results in
considerably more fine matrix precipitate at each
temperature, but much primary M, C is also present.

Effect of silicon additions. Additions of silicon to
Hf-Ti-Nb-modified alloys containing the standard 0.05%
carbon results in massive silicon-rich primary MsC
carbides primarily. located in grain boundaries and as
stringers. The microstructures resulting from the addi-
tion of 0.44% silicon are shown in Fig. 13.5 after aging
at 760 and 650°C. Large MgC precipitates are in the
grain boundaries in Fig. 13.5a after exposure at 760°C.
No matrix precipitation of MC-type carbides occurs at
this temperature (compare with Fig. 13.22 where the Si
content was <0.1%). At the lower aging temperature,
precipitation of all morphologies of MC discussed
previously are present in addition to the large MsC
particles in the grain boundary (Fig. 13.5b). Some fine
MC is also present in the grain boundaries after aging at
650°C.

Silicon additions of about 0.15% result in a smaller
quantity of MgC and corresponding increases in the
amount of MC precipitating in the matrix during aging
at both 650 and 760°C. Thus, silicon removes much of
the carbon from solution that would otherwise be
available for MC precipitation during aging.

- In summary, MC carbides which precipitate in the
matrix of Hf-Ti-Nb-modified Hastelloy N are present in
various sizes, morphologies, and- concentrations de-

pending on the aging temperature at the standard 0.05%
carbon level. Decreasing the carbon content decreases
the size and amount of matrix MC precipitated.
Increasing the carbon level above 0.05% results in large
primary M, C carbides at the expense of fine MC.

The addition of silicon results in precipitation of large
primary silicon-rich MgC carbides with subsequent
precipitation of MC dependent on the amount of
carbon remaining in solid solution.

Commercial alloys. We have examined the micro-

“structures of nearly all of the commercial heats of
modified Hastelloy N listed in Table 13.1 after aging at
650, 760, and in several cases 700°C. Our general
observations have been reported previously.>** A par-
ticular concern is that the microstructures of the heats
containing hafnium do not resemble those of laboratory
melts with similar compositions. Instead of platelets
and fine particles of MC carbides in the matrix and
grain boundaries, the microstructure consists of large
amounts of MC in jagged grain boundaries and ex-
tending into the matrix 1 to 3 um. The grain interiors
are generally quite free of precipitates. The alloy
modified only with 0.8% Hf (heat 70-796) does exhibit
some matrix MC, although it is very heterogeneously
distributed and much larger in size than that observed
in the laboratory heats. The grain boundaries are rather
typical of the other commercial heats, although less
‘carbide is present adjacent to the boundaries. Similar
observations were made on a commercial alloy (67-504)
containing 0.5% Hf that was produced by a different.
vendor.

Material from both of these commercial heats was
remelted and fabricated at ORNL with .the same
procedures used for the laboratory heats. The micro-
structures of the lab remelts after aging at 760°C are
similar to each other. The remelts differ from the
straight commercial material in that grain boundary
precipitation of the reprocessed alloys strongly re-
sembles that of conventional laboratory melts: fine
particles with no precipitate adjacent to the grain
boundaries. Figure 13.6a shows typical grain boundary
precipitate and a patch of heterogeneous matrix carbide
in the commercial alloys containing 0.8% Hf. The
laboratory remelts (Fig. 13.6b) do not have ¢arbides
adjacent to the grain boundary. A very small amount of
matrix carbide is present in the remelis after aging
although heterogeneously distributed.

The microstructures of the remelted alloys aged for

200 hr at 650°C are both free of precipitate. This

microstructure is different from that of the commercial
and the laboratory melts, and we currently have no
explanation for this anomalous observation.

13.1.2 Ni; Ti Precipitation in Ti-Modified
Hastelloy N

Observations that Ti concentrations above 1% result
in improved postirradiation ductility after irradiation at
temperatures above 700°C have generated renewed
interest in using Ti as the sole modifying element in
Hastelloy N. Precipitation of Ni3Ti would be unde-
sirable, as its effect is one of dramatic strengthening at

tallic Ni, Ti are present in the 2.9% Ti alloy, very homo-
geneously distributed throughout the matrix as shownin
Fig. 13.7. The intermetallic is lenticular, appears to be
shaped somewhat like a clam shell, and is oriented
parailel to the cube planes. Although present in the
2.4% Ti alloy, the Ni3Ti is heterogeneously distributed
and present in much smaller quantities. Isolated parti-
cles were observed in the 2.0% Ti, but they are much
smaller than in the more highly alloyed heats. _

The unstressed buttonhead from a creep specimen of
the 2% alloy was examined. The specimen had been
annealed and aged for 1000 hr at 760°C before a
47 000-psi creep rupture test at 650°C that lasted about
5200 hr. A considerable amount of NiyTi is, present;
although poorly developed, and was probably nucleated
during the 760°C age prior to the 650°C exposure. We
will look at these alloys exposed at 650 and 760°C for
various times to define more closely the maximum Ti
concentration allowable for semce in this temperature
range. The effect of 1rrad1at10n on NiyTi will also be
investigated.

13.1.3 Strain-Induced PrecipitAtion
in Modified Hastelloy N

Examination of the gage sections of several creep-

ruptu'fe specimens reveals. that precipitation during -

o/

elevated temperature tests is different from that which

131

forms in the unstressed buttonhead or in aged material. .

The typical MC carbide distribution in a 1.2% Ti-
modified Hastelloy N (alloy 467-548) after a 40,000-psi
creep test lasting 450 hr at 650°C is shown in Fig. 13.8.
Precipitation occurs as very fine carbides (200 to 1000
A) in high dislocation density slip bands. These disloca-
tions are out of contrast in Fig. 13.8a. The carbides are
clearly imaged in Fig. 13.8b, a dark-field micrograph
using a carbide .(220)_ diffraction spot. Precipitation in
the absence of the creep strain consists of carbides in
the stacking fault morphology, nucleated around re-
sidual primary carbides.

The strain-induced precipitate is not observed in
short-term tensile samples tested over a wide range of
strain rates. The dislocation structure generated in
tensile tests is characterized by relatively long, straight,
oriented dislocations with little or no tangling. The
dislocation structure of creep test specimens is mark-
edly different from that generated in tensile tests.
Although annealed specimens are used for both types of
tests, the load required for a creep test is well above the
yield point of the alloys. The application of this load to

~ the specimen results in very rapid plastic deformation

up to approximately 5%. The dislocation structure after
this strain-on-loading consists of bands of tangled
dislocations in [110] directions. This configuration

prowdes the sites for preclpltatlon during the remainder
of the test.

A different type of strain-induced precipitation
occurs in alloys containing Nb as a major addition. This
precipitate is present as very thin sheets as shown in the
bright field. and precipitate dark field micrographs (Fig.
13.9). The specimen is from a heat containing 1.95%
Nb and 0.9% Ti (alloy 69-648). The 63,000-psi creep
test lasted 470 hr at 650°C. As before, the initial
structure after loading consisted of bands of tangled
dislocations. Although the resulting precipitate has not
been identified, it does not appear to be the MC-type
carbide usually found in these alloys.

In reality, then, the microstructures of specimens
creep tested above the yield stress are not the same as
those which would be found in a reactor constructed of
annealed material and operating below the yield stress.
The property changes resulting from the nécessity of
performing creep tests at stresses above the yield point
would be an apparent increase in yield strength and
possibly lower ductility. The extremely low creep rates
found in the Nb-Ti alloys are indicative of the higher
strength. The Nb-Ti-modified alloys having this strain-.
induced precipitate are extremely strong with very
respectable ductilities, generally above 20%.

We will be investigating the extent of this strain-
induced precipitate in several of the modified alloys and

One of the prime requirements for nuclear reactor
"materials is long-term metallurgical stability. We are
aging materials at anticipated service temperatures and
measuring the mechanical properties to determine
whether the material is stable. Some modified Hastelloy

N specimens were solution annealed (1 hr at 1177°C)

and then aged at 650°'and 760°C for 1000, 3000, and
10,000 hr. These will be subsequently creep tested at
650°C and 55,000 psi or at 760°C and 20,000 psi.

The testing is partially complete, and the rupture lives
are compared in Table 13.2.

The results to date indicate that the alloys are qulte '
stable with only small changes in properties. The

~ fracture strains of all the alloys were 20% or greater,

The double-vacuum-melted and electroslag-remelted
commercial melts of modified Hastelloy N have been
further evaluated by mechanical property tests. Some
unirradiated mechanical properties and relative welding
characteristics were previously reported.* Mechanical
property tests on transverse specimens (0.125 in. diam

been conducted.

shorter than those of the base metal. The minimum
creep rate of the “as welded” specimen was lower than
that of the base metal, but the lower fracture strain of
the weld caused the rupture life to be reduced
considerably. After annealing 8 hr at 870°C, the
weldment specimens generally had a higher minimum
creep rate than the base metal, a shorter rupture life,
and a lower strain at fracture. Failure generally oc-
curred in the weld metal on the weldment specimens.
Rupture lives for the base metal varied from 72 to 3912
hr for tests at 55,000 psi and 650°C in air.

13.4 CREEP-RUPTURE PROPERTIES OF
HASTELLOY N MODIFIED WITH
NIOBIUM, HAFNIUM, AND TITANIUM

H. E. McCoy

Laboratory melts having nominal compositions of
Ni-12% Cr—4% Fe—0.2% Mn-0.5% Hf-0.5% Nb—
0.5% Ti and various concentrations of C and Si were
prepared. The detailed analyses of these alloys are given
in Table 13.6. The alloys were 2-1b castings and were
fabricated to %-in.-diam rods. They were annealed 1 hr
at 1180°C before testing. Several of the samples were
irradiated in the ORR at 760°C to a peak thermal
fluence of 3 X 10?? neutrons/cm?. All of the results
reported in' this section were obtamed at a test
temperature of 650 C. '

The first series of alloys had carbon concentrations
that ranged from 0.006 ito 0.137%. The results of creep

 tests on these alloys at 650°C are shown in Figs. 13.10

and 13.11. The rupture lives show some scatter, but
they generally show the expected trend of increasing
rupture life with increasing carbon content. Alloys 330
and 331 have similar carbon contents, but the rupture
lives are different at high stresses. This may be due to
the higher oxygen content of heat 330 and its influence
on the carbide structure. Alloys 334 and 335 with
0.087 and 0.137% C, respectively, have the longest
rupture lives of the series, and there is no detectable
difference in the two alloys. The minimum creep rates
of these same alloys in Fig. 13.11 show a systematic

- progression of strength with carbon level up to 0.05%.

The data for alloys 329 (0.052% C), 334 (0.087% C),
and 335 (0:137% C) are described by a single line. Heat
333 (0.049% C) seems weaker than heat 329 (0.052%).
All of the alloys are as strong or stronger than standard
Hastelloy N.

The stress-rupture properties of these same alloys
after irradiation at 760°C for 1100 hr are shown in Fig.
13.12. Alloys 330 (0.006% C), 331 (0.008% C), and
332 (0.014% C) have about equivalent rupture _lives,
which slightly exceed those of standard air-melted
Hastelloy N. The other four alloys with carbon levels of
0.049 to 0.137% seem to have rupture lives that are
better than those of the lower carbon alloys. The creep
strengths (Fig. 13.13) show a similar behavior. All
alloys have creep strengths above those noted for
standard vacuum-melted material.

The fracture éfrziihs of these alloys after irradiation
(Fig. 13.14) are ‘very good. Standard vacuum-melted
material has been observed to have fracture strains of
only a few tenths of a percent under these irradiation

and test conditions,® but the minimum fracture strain
noted for these alloys was 5%. There is a marked effect
of carbon content at lower creep rates. For alloys with
carbon contents of 0.049% or greater, the lowest
fracture strain is 13%. There is no systematic effect of
carbon content above 0.049%.

Three of the alloys contained Si additions. The
variation of the rupture lives of these alloys in the
unirradiated and irradiated conditions is shown in Fig.
13.15. Silicon does not seem to have any systematic
effect on the rupture life in the irradiated or unirradi-
ated conditions. The fracture strains are quite good for
all specimens, and there is no detectable effect of Si.

The mechanical behavior of these alloys is generally
what would be expected from the microstructural
observations made by Gehlbach. However, some
apparent conflicts exist. For example, aging at 760°C
produced a relatively coarse carbide structure in the
higher carbon alloys, whereas the mechanical properties
do not show a deterioration at the higher levels. Also,
the alloy with 0.44% Si (338) formed coarse M¢C-type

carbides and very little matrix precipitation during
aging. This should result in poor postirradiation proper-
ties, but the data (Fig. 13.15) do not bear this out. Two
factors likely account for these discrepancies. First, the
precipitates that form during aging without a stress may
be different from those that form in a stressed specimen
during testing. Second, irradiation may influence the
type and distribution of precipitate that forms. Both of
these factors must be investigated further since nuclear

applications will both stress and irradiate the material.

13.5 CORROSION STUDIES
J. W. Koger

The success of a molten-salt reactor system is strongly
dependent on the compatibility of the materials of
construction with the salts comprising the primary and
secondary circuits of the reactor.

A number of factors contribute to molten-salt corro-
sion. The tendency for a reaction to occur is measured
in terms of the chemical potentials of the reactants and
the products. The reaction kinetics will be influenced
by factors such as the temperature, pressure, concen-
tration, and nobility of the salt constituents, solubility
effects, and viscosity of the melts. ‘ |

The experiments discussed in this section are intended
to assess the mass transfer characteristics of candidate
salt-alloy systems under design parameters based on the
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor. The majority of studies
are conducted in thermal convection and pumped loops
constructed of Hastelloy N. The salts of interest are LiF
and BeF, based with UF, (fuel), ThF, (blanket), and
UF4 and ThF, (fertile-fissile) and a NaBF,-NaF mix-
ture:(coolant salt). ,

Of the major constituents of Hastelloy N, chromium
is much more readily oxidized in fluoride salts than Fe,

. Ni, or Mo. Accordingly, attack in our systems is

normally manifested by the selective removal of chro-
mium from the Hastelloy N. Several oxidizing reactions
may occur depending on the salt composition and
impurity content, but among ‘the most important
reactants causing oxidation are UF,, FeF,, and HF.
Because our experimental systems are not isothermal,
temperature gradient mass transfer effects are quite

‘important. Conventionally, we observe weight losses in

the hotter regions of our loops and weight gains in the
colder sections. - - o

The status of the thermal convection loops in
operation is summarized in Table 13.7.

139

13.5.1 Fuel Salts

Loop 1255, containing an MSRE-type fuel salt with 1
mole % ThF, and constructed of Hastelloy N, has been
terminated after 80,439 hr (9.2 years). The loop
contains insert specimens of standard Hastelloy N and a
Hastelloy N plus 2% Nb alloy. The latter alloy was
developed for improved weldability and mechanical

. properties, although similar compositions are now

under consideration because of increased resistance to
neutron damage. | ,

‘This loop was operated as a “life-test” to provide
long-term data on mass transfer in a fluoride salt, air
oxidation of Hastelloy N, and corrosion properties of
various weld junctions. We elected to terminate the
experiment after a salt leak was detected under one of
the main loop heaters. Prior to the discovery of the
failure, the amperage to the loop heaters dropped by a
factor of 2. Investigation revealed that half the main
heaters were open and grounded, which suggested the
presence of salt. After removing the insulation and
heaters, a small salt leak was found under one of the
Lavite® bushings used to position the loop heaters
around the hot leg.

The appearance of the wall near the failure is shown
“in Fig. 13.16. The failure site was at the center of a
- Y-in-diam crater whose depth was comparable to the
thickness of the wall. The crater formed from the
outside in, and its location suggests that it was caused
by catastrophic oxidation of the tube wall associated
with the Lavite bushing which surrounded the failure
area. We have examined metallographic samples from

* various sections of the loop, including the leak site, and,
except for the '%-in.-diam crater, these samples showed
only superficial corrosion (<1 mil) on either the outside
or inside surfaces of the loop. Even surfaces covered by
the leaking salt showed limited oxidation. New heaters
and insulation had been placed on the loop after 8.8
years of operation.” Based on our inspection of the
loop at that time, we believe that the failure was
induced following the heater replacement and that it
was not progressive over the life of the loop.

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel,
has operated about eight years with the same salt as
Loop 1255. The heaters and insulation on this loop
were replaced at the same time as for loop 1255, and it
continues to operate normally.

Loop NCL-16, constructed of Hastelloy N and con-

taining removable spemmens in each vertical leg, has
operated with MSBR fuel salt (Table 13.7) for over 3.5

‘years. The heaviest weight loss after this period is —2.9

mg/cm?, and the largest weight gain is +1.7 mg/cm?.
Assuming uniform loss, the maximum weight loss. is
equivalent to 0.04 mil/year. The chromium content of
the salt has increased 550 ppm, and the iron has
decreased about 100 ppm in 30,000 hr. Titanium-
modified Hastelloy N specimens (12% Mo—7% Cr—0.5%
Ti, bal Ni) in this loop show smaller weight losses than
standard Hastelloy N specimens (16% Mo—7% Cr—5%

Fe, bal Ni) under equivalent conditions. We attribute

this difference to the absence of iron in the modified

alloy. Principal corrosion reactions acting in this loop

appear to be -

We are now using loop NCL-16 to assist in the study
of the intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N found in
the MSRE. Specifically, we are evaluating the extent to
which the attack is related to the localization of normal
corrosion processes to grain boundaries. In any solid
solution alloy where there is a difference in nobility of
the constituents, electrochemical corrosion (oxidation-

reduction reactions) will cause the removal of the least -
noble constituent, attack being preferential to the grain-

boundaries. In time, given a continuing electrochemical
process, this will lead to crevices in the grain boundaries
and at defect .sites in the grain surfaces. Diffusional
processes within this crevice will normally lead to its
broadening and ultimately to the formation of pits.
However, if the root of the crack is anodically polarized

and the walls cathodically polarized, the knifeline .

-attack will continue. Such a condition may arise if the
walls of the crevice become covered with a very noble
material (nickel or molybdenum). This covering by a
noble constituent can occur either by the noble

material remaining on the wall when the least noble
constituent is removed or by dissolution of all the alloy
constituents with subsequent precipitation of the more
noble constituents.

In order to test this thesis we added approximately
400 to 500 ppm FeF, to NCL-16. Chemical analysis
showed an immediate increase of 300 ppm Fe in the
salt which has significantly increased the oxidation
potential of the salt compared with past operation of
the loop. '

The specimens from NCL 16 were removed after
448-hr exposure to the FeF,-doped salt and showed
weight changes typical of all our temperature gradient
mass transfer systems, that is, weight losses in the hot
section with corresponding weight gains in the cold
section. However, the weight changes obtained in the
last 448 hr were equal to those previously generated in
10,000 hr. No metallographic information is available at
this time.

NCL-21, a Hastelloy N thermal convection loop of a
somewhat different design (Fig. 13.17) with removable
specimens in each leg and containing the MSRE fuel
salt, was started and has operated for over 1000 hr. This
loop is equipped with electrochemical probes which will
measure the U3 /U% ratio, and, hence, provide an
instantaneous measure of the oxidation potential of the

salt is circulated only through tubing which is in a
harp-shaped configuration. The flow then goes out the
bottom of this tank into a crossover leg and into the
cold leg. The different design of the upper portion of
the loop was dictated by the fact that we wanted the
electrochemical probes to see a fairly large and calm salt
surface. The electrochemical probes pass through

- mechanical fittings (separated from the metal by

Teflon), which are on risers 10 in. from the surge tank
(to protect the Teflon from the heat of the salt) and
then enter the salt in the large hot-leg surge tank. There
are five access ports for the probes.

The specimens from the loop were removed, weighed,
and examined aftér 665-hr exposure. Weight losses and
gains, as expected in a temperature gradient mass

transfer system, were seen in the hot and cold leg

respectively. The maximum weight loss in the hot leg
was 0.1 mg/cm® and the maximum weight gain in the
cold leg was 0.05 mg/cm?. As expected, the U*/U**
ratio increased with time, and we are correlating these
values with our weight-change data. After these initial
measurements, further steps will involve additions of
oxidants and reductants to study their influence on our
measurements.

Details on the U**/U* ratio as monitored by the
probes are discussed in the Analytical Chemistry section
of this report.

13.5.2 Fertile-Fissile Salt
A fertile-fissile MSBR salt has circulated for over

13,400 hr in Hastelloy N loop NCL-19A, which has

removable specimens in each leg. The test has two
purposes: (1) to confirm the compatibility of Hastelloy
N with the salt and (2) to determine if bismuth will be
picked up by the salt and carried through the loop. The
bismuth is contained in a molybdenum vessel located in
an appendage beneath the hot leg of the loop. Assuming

uniform loss, the maximum weight loss is equivalent to -

0.024 mil/year. A modified Hastelloy N alloy (Ni—12%
Mo~7% Cr—0.1% Fe—0.4% Ti—2.0% Nb) has lost less

~weight than a standard alloy at the same position. The

chromium content of the salt has increased 134 ppm in
7400 hr, and there is no detectable bismuth in the salt.
The corrosmn reactions were discussed in the NCL-16

section.

- 13.5.3 Blanket Salt "

Loop NCL—]SA constructed of standard Haste]loy N
and containing removable specimens in each leg, has
operated three years with a blanket salt (LiF-BeF, with

25 mole % ThF,) proposed for a two-fluid MSBR
concept. Mass transfer, as measured by the change of
chromium concentration in the salt, has been very
small. Specimens exposed to this salt have a “glaze” or
coating (probably a high-melting thorium compound)
that is impossible to remove without damaging the
metal. However, metallographic studies show little, if
any, mass transfer of metallic components.

13.5.4 Coolant Salt

Loops NCL-13A and NCL-14, constructed of stand-
ard Hastelloy N and containing removable specimens in
each leg, have operated for 2.8 and 3.8 years, respec-
tively, with the fluoroborate mixture NaBF4-NaF (92-8
mole %). The maximum corrosion rate (assuming
uniform removal) at the highest temperature, 605°C,
has averaged 0.7 mil/year for both loops. Corrosion has

- generally been selective toward chromium

FeF,(d) + Cr(s) = CrF,(d) + Fe(s) ,

but there have been short periods when gaseous
impurities entered the salt to cause general attack of the

Hastelloy N, for example, by the reaction

2HF(d) + M(s) = Ha(g) + MF2(d) ,

where d, s, and g refer to dissolved state, crystalline
solid, and gas, respectively, and M =Cr, Fe, Ni, and Mo.

- The latter periods were caused by leaks in the seals of

ball valves which are located above the surge tanks.

. These valves are exposed to a mixture of He and BF;

gas and not to salt. We attribute the leaks both to heavy
use of the ball valves and to corrosion induced by any
air 1n!eakage into the gas mixture. Although the overail

‘corrosion rate in these 1oops is not excessive, the rates

observed in the absence of ball valve leaks have been an
ordei of magnitude lower than the average rate. In
NCL-14, over the last 4450 hr, the maximum corrosion
rate has been 0.3 mil/year. Figure 13.18 shows weight

'éhanges from specimens in NCL-13A as function of

position in the loop (temperature) and time. Note the
areas of weight gain and weight loss and the balance
pomts where no mass transfer occurs.

Loop NCL-17, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
and contammg removable specimens in each leg, is
being used to determine the effect of steam on the mass
transfer characteristics of the fluoroborate salt mixture.

- After 1000 hr of normal operation, steam was injected

from the loop and weight changes measured. The -

maximum metal loss for this time period (525 hr) was
0.34 mil/year with a correspondingly low weight gain.
Thus, the mass transfer rate was not greatly accelerated.

A salt analysis did not disclose any gross changes. The
valve was replaced, and loop operation continued.

- During the next 1850 hr, the maximum corrosion rate
(assuming uniform loss) was 0.7 mil/year. Part of this
increased mass transfer was probably associated with
the regulator problem, but further inspection disclosed
a leaking mechanical pressure fitting. This was repaired,
and the loop is contmumg operation.

An experiment was started to evaluate the corrosion
properties of eight brazed Hastelloy N specimens in
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). The specimens are con-
tained in a nickel capsule at 607°C (1125°F). The
reason for this test is that little, if any, work has been
done to determine brazes suitable for use in the sodium
fluoroborate coolant salt. The test was intended as an

_ initial screening study of brazes composed of Au-Ni,

AgCu, Cu, and several types of Ni-Cr-Fe alloys.
Specimens will be removed periodically for visual
observation and to determine weight changes.

The test has operated for over 3000 hr with all
specimens showing a net weight gain from +3 to §
-mg/cm?. Between 1200 and 1500 hr of operation a
pressure gage between the He cylinder and the capsule
‘became defective. During this time some of the speci-
mens lost weight as a consequence of the more highly

Over the 3000-hr run the iron content of the salt has

The spark plug probe consisted of a %-in.-diam -
electrode. which was installed April: 8, 1968 and was

assumed to be Hastelloy N. However, metallographic
examination of the rod disclosed cracks extending 5
mils into the metal. Spectrographic analysis revealed
that the material was Haynes alloy No. 25 (50%
Co—20% Cr—10% W—10% Ni—3% Fe). '

This parallels a finding in 1968 in which the specimen
support rods of thermal convection loops NCL-13 and
-14 were found to be Haynes alloy No. 25 rather than
Hastelloy N.'' That investigation revealed that the
source of the %-in. rod was a misidentified storage
carton, and we are assuming that the rod found in the
PKP loop was from the same source.

It was shown in the thermal convection loop tests
that the Haynes alloy No. 25 was attacked much more
than the Hastelloy N. In the case of the PKP-1 loop, the
spark plug probe comprised an infinitesimal fraction of
the loop surface, a fact that would explain the much
heavier attack compared with Hastelloy N.

NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant salt at temperatures
similar to those expected in the MSBR secondary
circuit. The loop designation has been changed from
MSR-FCL-1 to MSR-FCL-1A because of changes in the
equipment and in the operating parameters. The new
velocity in the '%-in.-OD, 0.042-in..wall tubing is
nominally 5% fps. The maximum and minimum salt
temperatures in the loop are 620 and 454°C respec-
tively. Hastelloy N corrosion test specimens are exposed
to circulating salt at 620, 548, and 454°C.

_ A second forced-circulation loop of improved design,

MSR-FCL-2, has completed shakedown tests and is in .

operation. This loop will be used to study the corrosion
and mass transfer of standard Hastelloy N in sodium
fluoroborate coolant at typical MSBR salt tempera-
tures. A new pump design for MSR-FCL-2 provides salt
velocities up to 20 fps. The loop contains three sets of
removable corrosion specimens which are exposed to
salt at 620, 537, 454°C and salt velocities of 10 and 20
fps.

13.7.1 Operation of Forced-Convection
Loop MSR-FCL-1A

We completed loop repairs and placed the loop in
operation at simulated MSBR conditions on Aug. 16,
1971. The test has operated smoothly since that time
and has accumulated 380 hr at design condmons as of
Aug. 31, 1971.

During the repair period, modlﬁcatnons were made to
the control system to prevent accidental overheating of
the loop piping. About 25 ft of Hastelloy N loop tubing
was replaced, and new corrosion specimens were in-
stalled. The specimen assembly was modified so that
specimens could be clipped rather than tack welded
into the assembly. The 27-ftlong cooler coil was
undamaged and was reused. The NaBF,-NaF (92-8
mole %) coolant salt was removed from the dump tank.
and cooler coil by water flushing. This salt had been in
the system for the entire period of operation preceding

~overheating (10,335 hr at design conditions). In view of

the .changes in corrosion specimens and operating
conditions, the loop de31gnat10n was changed to MSR-
FCL-1A.

The LFB pump was disassembled and repaired prior
to reinstallation in MSR-CFL-1A, and new bearings and
mechanical face seals were installed as is customary.
The pump was operated at 3000 rpm in a cold
shakedown for about 24 hr to ensure that the bearings
and seals were operating properly. An oil leakage rate of
about 4 cc/day was observed from the internal mechan-
ical seal and was considered acceptable. The LFB pump
operates at 3000 rpm in MSR-FCL-1A, which is slower
than the 5000 rpm previously used in MSR-FCL-1. It is
hoped that this reduced speed will appreciably increase
the reliability and service life of the bearings and
rotating seals.

The piping system was filled with 510°C salt from the
dump tank on Aug. 12, 1971. The salt was circulated
isothermally at 540°C for 90 hr at a flow rate of about
0.8 gpm during final system checkout. The flow rate
was then increased to the design value of 2.4 gpm
(pump- speed 3000 rpm) for an additional 4 hr at
intermediate temperatures prior to reaching design
conditions on Aug. 16, 1971. The power input te the
loop at design conditions is 63 kW. This power level
represents a practical upper limit for long-term opera-
tion of the power input system because of heating
limitations of the saturable reactor.

13.7.2 Metallurgical Analysis of Forced-Convection
Loop MSR-FCL-1A

A salt sample was taken from the pump bowl on Aug.
16, 1971, after circulating the salt isothermally for 90
hr at 540°C. This initial salt analysis disclosed relatively
large amounts of chromium, iron, molybdenum, and
hydrogen. However, a later sample taken from the
pump bowl at 454°C, after the loop had operated 138
hr at design conditions, showed smaller amounts of
impurities. If any of the impurities were at saturation,
the difference in temperature at which the samples were
taken could explain the apparent discrepancy.

13.7.3 Operation of Fo’rced-Convection
Loop MSR-FCL-2 '

Assembly and preoper'ational checkout of the second
molten-salt forced-convection -loop MSR-FCL-2 (ref.
13) were completed during this report period. The loop

Rep. Aug. 31, 1970, ORNL-4622, pp. 176-78.

was filled with a specially processed sodium fluoro-
borate salt charge, placed in operation, and heat
transfer performance of the salt was measured. After a
short period of hot. operation an O-ring seal failure in
the ALPHA pump required a loop shutdown. The seal
failure was repaired and the test returned to design
conditions. This loop, constructed of Hastelloy N, will
be used to study the corrosion and mass transfer
properties of Hastelloy N in fluoroborate-type coolant-
salt systems at conditions proposed for the MSBR.

Preoperational checkout was completed in accordance
with the operating manual, and all documentation was
reviewed for compliance with the Quality Assurance
Plan (Engineering Document Q-10566-RB-001-5-0). All
recorders and indicators of temperature, pressure, and
power input were calibrated. Heat loss measurements
were made on heater No. 2 in preparation for deter-
mining the heat transfer performance of the salt.

The salt charge for MSR-FCL-2 was processed to
improve its purity prior to transfer into the loop. The
first routine processing was done after 25 kg of the salt
components was mixed and sealed in a vessel. The
mixed powders were heated to 149°C and evacuated
with a mechanical vacuum pump for 45 hr to remove
moisture. The salt was then heated to 500°C and 16.7
kg was transferred to a small filling pot. The salt in the
filling pot was heated under sealed-off vacuum to check
for further impurity outgassing. The pressure rose from
28.7 in. Hg vacuum at. 149°C to 26.4 in. Hg at 470°C
which indicated little outgassing above the expected
BF; vapor pressure of the salt. An equilibrium mixture
of He-BF; was bubbled through the salt at 480°C at
about 100 cc/min for 60 hr, and the effluent gas was
passed through a cold trap at 0°C. This test was run to
check for impurity collections such as were noted
during operation of a liquid level bubbler in the PKP
loop.!* The inlet gas mixture was prepared for the

experiment by mixing dried helium (<1 ppm H,0)

with BF; in the proper ratio to balance the vapor
pressure of the hot salt.

- Impurities were found in the gas mixture after it had
bubbled through the salt. A gas rotameter downstream
of the cold trap initially became fouled with a clear
liquid. A white film also deposited on the walls of the
glass cold trap. A total of 0.15 cc of brown liquid was
collected in the trap after 60 hr, and the materials
collected appeared similar to those noted by A. N.
Smith'* during operation of the PKP loop. Analysis

was inconclusive as it only disclosed major quantities of
Na, B, and F with ppm values for many other elements.
These instances of impurity collection show that
presently available sodium fluoroborate systems can be
expected to give acid collection and fouling problems
when devices such as liquid level bubblers are used.
From the small amount of material collected, we
concluded that our method was not practical for
removing large amounts of impurities. However, we feel
that improvements could be made on the basic process
which could provide more efficient removal.

The heat transfer performance of NaBF4-NaF (92-8
mole %) coolant salt was measured in heater section No.

2 of MSR-FCL-2 during hot shakedown operations.

Heat transfer data were obtained at Reynolds moduli

from 4200 to 48,000, salt velocities from 1.25 to 10.6

fps, heat fluxes from 43,000 to 157,000 Btu hr ! ft72,
film coefficients from 230 to 2100 Btu hr ™! ft~2 °F !,
and at salt temperatures from 454 to 616°C. The test

- -section is % -in.-OD tubing with a measured ID of 0.416

in. Resistance heating is supplied by a three-lug system
with voltage potential applied to the center lug and the
two exterior lugs at ground potential. Therefore, there
is a section at the center lug of the heated length which
has an interrupted heat flux. The actively heated length
is 11.5 ft which gives an L/D ratio of 331. Guard
heaters are located on ‘the heater lugs and along the
resistance-heated tube to reduce heat losses dunng the
heat transfer tests.

Temperature of the bulk fluid is measured by three
thermocouples located in wells at both the inlet and
exit. Wall temperatures along the heated section are
measured by thermocouples that are wrapped 180°
circumferentially around the tubing and clamped
against the wall at about 1-ft intervals. The above-
mentioned ;thermocouples are all sheathed, insulated
junction, 0.040-in.-OD, Chromel/Alumel and have been
precalibrated. Four bare wire thermocouples
(0.010-in.-OD, Chromel/Alumel) are also placed on the
heated wall and read out on a potentiometer for
comparison with the sheathed thermocouples recorded
by the DEXTIR data logger. The readings of the two
types of thermocouples were in good agreement.

The heat transfer data obtained with sodium fluoro-
borate salt in MSR-FCL-2 have been put in dimension-
less form as shown in Fig. 13.23. The data are in good
agreement with the empirical correlation of Sieder and
Tate' * .which is shown by the solid line. The plotted
data points were obtained with more precise thermo-
couple techniques than those used in earlier work! ¢ by

the writer; therefore, the data of Fig. 13.23 are
_ considered the best available evidence that sodium

A gas leak occurred at an O-ring seal w1thm the
AYLPHA pump on July 7, 1971, as the test was being
brought to design operating conditions. At that time
the salt had been in the loop for 510 hr and had been
circulated by the pump for 56 hr. The salt inventory
was sampled to check for impurity additions resulting
from the gas leak, and none were found. The system
was then drained to repair the pump. The gas leak
resulted from BF; attack of a BUNA-N O-ring in the
mechanical seal cartridge. The manufacturer of the
mechanical seal indicated during early engineering
discussions that Viton (a DuPont fluoroelastomer
which is more resistant to BF; than BUNA N) would be
used in this application, but this was changed during
actual assembly of the seals. The pump has been
reassembled with new seal cartridges containing Viton
O-rings, and MSR-FCL-2 has just been placed in
operation at design conditions. Details of the ALPHA
pump O-ring seal replacement and other pump engi-
neering problems are discussed elsewhere in this report,

13.7.4 Metallurgical Analysis of Forced-Convection
Loop MSR-FCL-2

Corrosion test specimens were in the loop while the
heat transfer measurements were made. These speci-
mens were examined after salt exposure of 510 hr and
salt circulation with the ALPHA pump for 56 of those
hours. During the heat transfer measurements the pump
operated at speeds between 1400 and 5400 rpm, and
the specimens were exposed to temperatures between
440 and 620°C.

The weight changes were higher than expected (maxi-

- mum weight loss of 1.5 mg/cm?) and showed a definite

velocity effect. The specimens exhibited expected
temperature-gradient mass transfer behavior with
weight losses in the high-temperature region, very little
change in the medlum-temperature region, and we1ght
gains in the cold region.

During the time of the heat transfer measurements,
the chromium in the salt increased from 64 to 82 ppm,

and the iron changed from 359 to 347 ppm. The oxide

content varied from 500 to 800 ppm, and the H*
content increased from 27 to 31 ppm. Mass transfer was
not considered excessive, and the decision was made to
go to design conditions.

13.8 CORROSION OF HASTELLOY N IN STEAM
B McNabb H E. McCoy

The modlﬁcatlons to the sample chamber at Bull Run
to accommodate tube burst tests has been completed
and the test faclhty placed back in operation.' Some of
the unstressed weight gain specimens have accumulated
8000-hr exposure-and are still following the same trends
reported previously.!” The Hastelloy N specimens,
both air and vacuum melted, have total weight gains of
about 0.4 mg/cm? at 538°C. The same heats of
Hastelloy N exposed to steam at 593 °C in the Florida

“steam plant for approximately 15 000 hr have weight

gains of about 3.5 mgfem? .
Two of the Hastelloy N tube burst spec:lmens installed

in the Bull Run facility failed prematurely. The h1ghest

stressed (77,000 psi, 0.010 in. wall thickness) specimen

‘failed in 1 hr, and the next-highest stressed (52,500 psi,
0.015 in. wall thickness) failed in 3.7 hr. These speci-
mens were stressed considerably above the yield stress 5
at 538°C (40,000 psi), and yielding might continue ina
thin-walled tube to produce rupture quickly. It was first

believed that these failures were caused by either flaws
in the specimens, poor machining of the gage section, or
inaccuracies in measuring the wall thickness of the
specimens. Later evidence indicates this was not the
case. Figure 13.24 is a photograph of these double-
walled tube burst specimens, with the outer tube
removed.

The 77 000-p31 spemmen falled catastrophically, but
the 52,500-psi specimen developed a small crack
starting at the tip of the arrow shown at the right of the
photograph. Even though the specimens failed in a
short time, they were not removed from the facility
until 1000 hr, so the outside of the inner tube was
exposed to steam for about the same time as the
outside of the outer tubes shown at the top of the
photograph,

These two failed specimens were replaced by speci-
mens stressed at 56,000 psi (0.014 in. wall) and 50,000
psi (0.016 in. wall). These stresses bracket the lower
stress of the failed specimens (52,500), and these

" replacement specimens have been in test over 1000 hr
-without failure, indicating the other specimens had

failed prematurely. These latter specimens were
machined carefully and had a superior surface finish
and appear to have uniform wall thicknesses.

Figure 13.25 is a photomicrograph of the area of

| ~ failure of the 52 ,500- ps1| tube burst. It appears that

stress corrosion cracking has occurred with the cracks
starting on the ID (steam side) of the tube. Since the
other tubes stressed in the same range as this one have
not failed, it raises the possibility that something could
have happened to this individual specimen. Either some
contaminant was left in the tube following fabrication

- due to poor cleaning practice or some contaminant was

introduced by the steam during operation. An investi:
gation is under way to check water quality records
during the run to determine if any unusual conditions
existed during the run. The plant had been in a period
of sustained operation for over one month before the

.- first specimens were inserted.
- Preliminary results from studies by Hammond at

Dunedin, Fla. showed that Hastelloy N may be suscep-

~ tible to stress corrosion crackmg in steam containing
~sodium chloride and oxygen. Some of the test con-
"ditions actually deposited NaCl on the material. H. W.

mechanism for rapid intergranular deterioration of
austenitic stainless steels by oxygen and dry NaCl that
may be pertinent to these observations. This mechanism
was based on the formation of a nonprotéctive scale
containing NaCrQ, from the reaction of NaCl and O,
with Cr, 03 and Cr, 3C¢, with reaction rates increasing
in the order listed. Since Hastelloy N contains 7%
chromium, it was decided to test it.in contact with
NaCl at 593°C. An air-melted heat (5065) with 16.5%
Mo, 7.2% Cr, 3.9% Fe, 0.55% Mn, 0.6% Si, and 0.065%
C and a vacuum-melted heat (2477) with 16.3% Mo, 7%
Cr, 4.1% Fe, 0.05% Mn, 0.05% Si, and 0.06% C were
tested in air at 60,000 psi and 593°C in the uncoated

and coated conditions. Rod specimens having gage -

sections 1.125 in. long X 0.125 in. diam were used for
these creep tests. The specimens were annealed 1 hr at
1177°C ‘in argon prior to testing. The NaCl was applied
to the specimens by painting a saturated NaCl solution
on a % -in. length of the gage section and allowing it to
dry before installing in the furnace. The coatings were
typically about 5 mils thick before testing.

Figure 13.26 shows a plot of the percent elongation
vs time for heat 5065 at 593°C and 60,000 psi in air for

specimen had about two times the rupture life of the
coated specimen and a slightly lower creep rate. Figure
13.27 is a plot of the percent elongation vs time for
heat 2477 in the uncoated and coated conditions at
593°C and 60,000 psi in air. The first two specimens
designated anneal 000 had a mill anneal of 1 hr at
1177°C prior to machining, and the third specimen had
an additional anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C after machining
but prior to testing.

It appears that there is little effect of the NaCl on the
creep strength of Hastelloy N at these conditions, but
further testing will be required to determine the
magnitude of the effect at various stresses. The reason
for the difference in creep strengths of heats 5065 and
2477 is not presently understood, since at higher
temperatures, |such as 650 and 760°C, the strengths are
quite close.

due to the presence of the NaCl.

(468.3: hr without and 475.9 hr with salt) shows NaCl
has little if any effect on vacuum-melted Hastelloy N at
these conditions.

13.9 EVALUATION OF DUPLEX TUBING
FOR USE IN STEAM GENERATORS

B.McNabb H.E.McCoy

Duplex tubing has been proposed for steam generator
service with Incoloy 800 on the inside (steam side) and
nickel 280 (pure nickel with 0.05% Al, Q5 for grain size
control) on the outside or salt side. A piece of the Inco
duplex tubing reported previously!® was further evalu-
ated by mechanical property tests. A 12-in. piece of the
0.750-in.-diam tubing was tensile tested in a Baldwin

Tensile Machine at 25°C and a displacement rate of

0.05 in./min. The 0.2% offset yield stress was 37,600
psi, the ultimate tensile stress was 70,780 psi, and the

elongation -50.5% in 2 in. It appears that at room

temperature the Ni 280 and the Incoloy 800 contribute
equally to the strength in the tensile test.

A tube burst specimen was tested at 538°C in an
argon atmosphere with argon internal pressure and
ruptured in 3263 hr. Calculating the stress on the entire
duplex wall thickness assuming 0.065 in. each for the
Incoloy 800 and Ni 280 would give a hoop stress of
28,720 psi. The hoop stress in the Incoloy 800,

assuming the Ni 280 did not add any strength, would be

46,000 psi. The rupture life of 3263 hr for a stress of
46,000 psi at 538°C is in good agreement with the data
in Bulletin T-40 (Inco) for Incoloy 800. Therefore, it
appears that the nickel contributed very little to the
strength at this temperature.

Figure 13.32 is a photograph of the tube burst

~specimen with Incoloy 800 end plugs and nickel rings

82T weld wire and GTA welding were used to make the

the gage section of the tube, and the many longitudinal
cracks in the nickel 280 can be seen clearly in the
figure. Figure 13.33 is a photomicrograph of the Ni 280
tubing showing the extent and depth of the cracking in
the outer portion of the duplex tube. Figure 1334 isa
photomicrograph of the rupture area with the crack in
the inner Incoloy 800 tube and extending on through

the Ni 280 outer tube. The Incoloy 800 was not

cracked around the circumference as was the Ni 280,
and the interface between the two matenals was
metallurgically sound.

The tubing was made by coextruding the two
materials into a tube shell and then drawing into tubing.
Since the tube burst specimen was profusely cracked
longitudinally, it was thought that prior working
direction might have influenced the cracking behavior.
Specimens from some Ni 280 sheet already on hand

"were cut longitudinal and transverse to the rolling

direction and creep tested at 538°C and 20,000 psi in
argon. Figure 13.35 is a plot of the percent elongation

vs time for a pair of these tested in the as-received
condition. It appears that the longitudinal specimen is
slightly stronger, with a longer rupture life and lower
minimurh creep rate. However, the fracture strains are
quite high for both specimens.

The proposed use for the tubing would have steam on

“the inside (Incoloy 800 side), but it would be desirable

75 mgfcm?

to know if Ni 280 would be compatible with steam in
the event of a leak. Some specimens of Ni 280 sheet
were exposed to 3500 psi steam at 538°C in the Bull
Run facility for 2000 hr. The specimens gained about
in this period and appear to be almost
completely oxidized as shown in Fig. 13.36. The green
flaky oxide was easily removed, and the remaining
black oxide was easily broken in handling the specimens
with tweezers. The thickness of the specimens had
doubled because of the low density of the oxide. It
appears that Ni 280 is not compatible with steam under
these conditions.

14. Support for Ch.emical Processing

J. R. DiStefano

Reductive-extraction reprocessing has been proposed

as a method of removing protactinium and fission;

products from an MSBR fuel. The process involves
extracting uranium, protactinium, and rare earths from
the fuel salt into molten bismuth containing dissolved

thorium and lithium as reductants. Qur materials

program is aimed at selecting the most promising

material for containing these Bi-Li- Th solutions at 500

to 700°C.
At present our efforts are concentrated in two areas.

One is the fabrication of an experimental reductive-

extraction unit from molybdenum. This unit, which

involves a packed column, will allow us to obtain
metallurgical data on the test equipment as well as

chemical engineering process data under a variety of

conditions. The second part of our program is to
evaluate the compatibility of molybdenum, TZM, tan-

talum, T-111, brazing alloys, and various grades of

graphite with several Bi-Li solutions under reprocessmg
conditions. : ,

14.1 CONSTRUCTION OF A MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE-EXTRACTION TEST STAND

J.R. D1$tefano

We are constructing a molybdenum system that will
be used for metallurgical and chemical engineering
evaluation. Details of the desngn of this test stand have
been reported elsewhere.!»? Basically, it consists of a
5-ft-long 1%-in.-OD packed column with enlarged (3%
in. OD) top and bottom sections; feed pots (3% in

OD); gas lift pumps; freeze valve; and %-in.-OD X
0.020-in.-wall, %;-in.-OD X 0.025-in.-wall, % -in.-OD X
0.030-in.-wall, and %-in.-OD X 0.080-in.-wall inter-
connecting lines. Molten salt and bismuth will be
countercurrently circulated through the column, sep-
arated in the disengagement sections, and returned to
the elevated head pots for gas separation, sampling,
flow measurement, and gravity flow back through the
column. The system is designed to operate isothermally
in the range 550 to 650°C.

Back-extrusion, welding, brazing, and mechanical
joining techniques have been developed to fabricate and
assemible -the loop. The following is a general outline of
the fabrication schedule: |

1. fabrication of contamers and column

2. machining of loop components

3. fabrication of head pot and column subassemblies,
4. mounting of subassemblies on test stand supports,

5. joining of subassemblies and other loop components.

We have completed pnmary fabrication of the head
pots, enlarged end sections of the column, and the

Evaluation of three sizes of commercially obtained
molybdenum tubing (% in. OD X 0.020 in. wall, % in.
OD X 0.025 in. wall, and %, in. OD X 0.030 in. wall)

has revealed differences in hardness, recrystallization

behavior, and ductility. Table 14.1 shows the variation
in hardness and microstructure that occurred as a
function of ‘heat treatment. The data for the %-in.-OD
tubing indicated it was partially recrystallized in the
as-received condition, and heating to 925°C resulted in

complete recrystallization. Contrarily, both the %-and

1,-in.-OD samples were received in a cold-worked
condition. Heat treating to 925°C did not alter the
hardness or microstructure of the % -in.-OD tubing, but
the '%-in.-OD sample softened and was almost com-
pletely recrystallized.

To evaluate the ductility of the tubing as a function

of temperature, we devised a somewhat qualitative test
in which a ring sample was impact squashed a pre-
determined amount. In these tests the ring becomes
elliptical, and we have defined the amount of defor-
mation in terms of a displacement (original ring diam —
minor axis diam-of ellipse) divided by the original
diameter of the ring. The data obtained have been
summarized in Table 14.2. Note that the %-in.-OD
tubing was “ductile” (no cracks) at room temperature
while, under the conditions of these tests, we were
required to heat the %-in.-OD tubing to 150 to 250°C

and the %-in.-OD tubing to 300°C before they became
ductile, We traced the behavior of the %-in.-OD tubing
to a brittle layer on the ID as indicated in Table 14.3.

~ Removal of 0.004 in. from the ID {(0.002 in. from the
wall thickness) resulted in lowering the temperature at

which ductility was observed from 300 to 125°C; when
0.006 in. was removed from the ID the material was
ductile at room temperature. Chemical analysis in-
dicated that material from near the ID of this tubing
contained higher oxygen and carbon concentrations
compared with bulk sample analyses. We suspect that
contamination of the tubing occurred during fabri-
cation; inadequate cleaning procedures, perhaps due to
the difficulty of getting a pickling solution into the
relatively small diameter opening, resulted in a brittle
zone near the ID. To determine if ID contamination
might also be responsible for the brittle behavior of the
%-in.-OD tubing, we removed (by etching) 0.001 to
0.002 in. from the inside. Subsequent tests then showed
good ductility at room temperature for this material
also.

The fabrication schedule used in making the 3-

in.-OD tubing could also have contributed to its lack of

ductility. We noted that the %-in.-OD tubing com-
pletely recrystallized when it was heated for 1 hr at
925°C. Since recrystallization temperature is a function

of the prior history of the material, we felt the

fabrication schedule merited investigation. Additional
%-in.-OD tubing made by a different schedule was

A roll-bonding technique has been developed to join
the ¥-, %-, and %-in.-OD tubes to the closed-end feed
pots and upper and lower column disengagement
sections. Some of the commercially obtained tube
expanders that we are using to make these joints are
shown in Fig. 14.1. The tool fits inside the tube to be
joined such as the one shown extending into the boss of
the typical back-extruded half section in Fig. 14.1.
Expandable tube. rollers then mechanically force the
tube against the surface of the boss to which it is to be
joined. Because of its room-temperature brittleness,
molybdenum joints are more easily made at 250°C; in
order to prevent contamination of areas that must be
subsequently joined by welding, an inert atmosphere is
required (Fig. 14.2). Leak-tight joints (<1 X 1077 atm
cc/sec) have been made under the following conditions:

These joints were also leak-tight after they were

To further strengthen roll-bonded joints, each joint

~ will be sealed by a chemically vapor deposited tungsten

layer on the bismuth or salt side and will be back
brazed with the alloy Fe—15% Mo—5% Ge—4% C-1%B
on the inert gas atmosphere side. A macrophotograph

tooling consists of a 3%-in.-diam plunger and a split die
. with an oblong hole in the closed end to produce a boss
needed for support of inlet and exit tubes. All surfaces
of the tooling in contact with molybdenum are coated
with plasma-sprayed ZrQ, to prevent chemical inter-
action. : -

We have fabricated all of the required eleven 37%-
in-diam back extrusions for the molybdenum test
stand. Four of five 5-in.-long back extrusions have been
machined for the salt and bismuth head-pot assemblies,
leaving one spare. Two of three 8-in.-long back ex-
trusions are being machined for the lower disengaging
section of the packed column, also leaving one spare.
All of these back extrusions were accomplished at
1600°C with a stem load of 800 to 900 tons.

“In order to make the lower disengaging section of the

column from two back extrusions of approximately
equal length, 9, ¢-in.long half sections are required. A
12-in.-long die was procured, and three half sections
between 9 and 10 in. long have been back extruded at
1700°C. One of the half sections was made in two
steps. Under similar conditions, it did not back extrude

the required length as did the others. It was reheated to
1700°C, and by carefully aligning it with respect to the
die it was again back extruded to increase its length
without altering the preformed boss.

Our studies have shown that back extrusion of
molybdenum depends upon the quality of the starting
blank, back-extrusion temperature, and reactivity be-
tween the tooling and molybdenum. Some of the early
starting blanks had small surface cracks, and we found
it difficult to avoid cracks in the finished product.
Initially we used a ZrQ,-coated plunger and die, but the
die length was short and allowed the molybdenum to
contact the tool steel container of the press along its
OD as it was being back extruded. Interaction of the

-molybdenum with the steel caused some tearing of the

OD surface. This was eliminated by use of a ZrO,-
coated long-length die as shown in Fig. 14.4. We also
found that ‘recoating both plunger and die before each
back extrusion ensured high-quality finished products.

Since coating and tooling life is dependent upon

temperature, we ftried temperatures from 1350 to
1700°C during our development period. Unfortunately,

we often had more than temperature as a variable and
were unable to conclude what might be the optimum
temperature. However, we did find we were able to
consistently produce good quality back extrusions at
temperatures from 1600 to 1700°C. Tensile and bend-
test .specimens have been machined from back ex-
trusions made at several temperatures for mechamcal
pr0pert1es evaluation.

14.3 WELDING MOLYBDENUM .

A. J.Moorhead
Three major types of welded joint (tube-to-header,

header-to-header, and tube-to-tube) are required for
fabrication of the molybdenum test stand for chemical

processing. Our initial work on these three joints was.

described in an earlier report.* During this period we
have fabricated more complex structures which sim-

‘ulate actual loop components. We are also optimizing

our welding procedures and are designing and building
weld fixtures.

~ As an aid to fabrication, we have begun constructinga

full-scale ‘mockup of the molybdenum test stand.
Wooden models of the four pots were made, and short
stubs of Monel tubing were inserted in the, appropriate

~ -holes in the bosses. The tubes were previously bent to

the shapes required of the molybdenum tubes. These

The standard 80-mil wall thickness of the molybdenum
tubing will be machined down to 50 mils for this weld.
Therefore, %-in.-OD X 0.050-in.-wall tubes were
welded to 1%-in.-OD cylinders representing the boss on
the back-extruded header. The weld joint was preheated
to about’ 700°C’ with the defocused electron beam.
Welding parameters were 140-kV acceleratmg potential,

10-mA beam current, 11-in./min travel speed, with the
beam defocused 15 mA. This is the final size of tubing

to be welded in developing procedures for weldmg the
tube-to-header type of joint.

Two Y%-in.-diam tubular weirs were electron-beam
welded into one of the '4-in.-thick molybdenum baffle

plates for the head pots. These welds, which were of the
tube-to-header type, were made by rotating the electron
beam around the joint rather than by rotating the
workpiece under the beam. The speed of beam rotation
was manually controlled. This technique is very useful
in welding parts in which the weld joint is off-centered
(as in this case) or otherwise difficult to rotate.

. Visually, both welds looked good, and no defects were

detected by fluorescent penetrant inspection.

‘Three sets of back-extruded headers were successfully |

joined by girth welds to form three nearly full-size feed
pots. The first set was welded using the electron-beam
process and the step joint (shown as the “alternate”
joint) in Fig. 14.5. Both headers were preheated to
above 700°C with the defocused electron beam prior to
welding; earlier work had revealed that preheating was
necessary to prevent weldment cracking, although the
minimum preheat temperature has not been de-
termined.. The welding parameters were: 140-kV -ac-
celerating potential, 20-mA beam current, 41.5-in./min
work travel speed, and the beam defocused 10 mA from

sharp focus. No weld defects wete fevealed by flu-
orescent-penetrant inspection. However, metallographic
examination revealed that weld penetration was about
45 mils rather than the desired 100 mils. We will try to
overcome this shortcoming on the next practice weld
by using a more sharply focused beam and a higher
beam current.

The other two sets of headers were joined using the
manual gas tungsten-arc process in an argon-filled
chamber. Two weld passes were required to fill the 90°

vee-groove weld joint (Fig. 14.5), using low-carbon,
low-oxygen molybdenum filler wire. No weld preheat
was required. One of these welded pots is shown in Fig.
14.6 together with the two back-extruded headers. No
defects were detected on either arc-welded feed pot
when they were fluorescent-penetrant inspected.

To more closely simulate conditions required in
fabrication of the test stand, additional tube-to-tube
welds have been made with the orbiting arc weld head.
Longer lengths of tubing were joined with the axis of

the tube vertical. As we expected, problems of axial
tube misalignment after welding and weld cracking due

‘to excessive restraint of the joint occurred. In order to

overcome these difficulties, we have procured longer
weld- inserts to provide better internal support and a
yoke type of fixture for external support. The latter
will be left in place around the joint until after the
sleeve surrounding the weld has been attached.

We are also in the process of optimizing our welding
procedures for each size of tubing to increase the
reproducibility of these welds. Helium-leak-tight tube-

to-tube welds have been made in all the required sizes
of tubing, but the penetration achieved on the Y-
in.-OD" tubing has been only about one-third of ‘the

50-mil wall thickness. The welding current required to
make these latter welds is relatively high (110 amp),
and the welding speed slow (11 in./min), resulting in

" overheating of the orbiting-arc weld head. Therefore,

we are investigating the use of a weld cycle i in which the
current is pulsed between a high current (to get deeper
penetratlon) and a lower current to perrmt some
cooling of the head.

14.4 DEVELOPMENT OF BRAZING TECHNIQUES
FOR FABRICATING THE MOLYBDENUM
TEST LOOP

N.C.Cole

The iron-base alloy, Fe—15% Mo—5% Ge—4% C—1%
B, has been selected as the filler metal for back-brazing
joints in sections of the chemical processing test loop
that will contain bismuth. Back brazing will serve two
purposes. It will provide reinforcement to the weld
zone which is brittle at room temperature, and it will

provide a seal should a leak develop through a roll bond . .

or a cracked weld. The alloy selected satisfies the
requirements of having a moderately low brazing
temperature (<1200°C) and adequate resistance to
bismuth at 650°C. Since specific brazing techniques for
the variety of joints encountered have never been
developed previously, much of. our ‘work has been
devoted to basic process development and im-
provement. We have developed several methods of

_brazing using resistance and h]gh-frequency mductzon as

the heatmg sources.

14.4.1 Resistance Furnace Brazing

Small thin-walled tubes have been brazed to latge pots
3% in. OD X 9% in. long X % in. wall) in vacuum in a
resistance furnace. Into each end of the container
shown in Fig. 14.5, two or more short lengths of tubing

must be roll-bonded or welded and then back brazed.
At the same time, a split ring covering the girth welds of
the pots or chambers will also be brazed. Mockups of
these subassemblies were brazed in a resistance furnace
with a 7-in. X 7-in. X 30-in.-long chamber at relatively
isothermal conditions at a pressure of 10~ torr. -

To ensure proper flow of the brazing filler metal into
the joint, a joint gap of at least 0.001 in. is necessary.
However, the joint preparation for roll bonding and
welding ‘requires a closer tolerance to produce sound
welds and proper alignment. Therefore, the portion of
the joint to be back brazed will be counter bored an

~extra 0.0015 to 0.0025 in. on the diameter to a depth

of % in. We have also provided filler-metal feeder holes
by drilling into the bosses of the large components;

- these serve as reservoirs for the brazing alloy powder

and provide insurance that the filler metal does not
prematurely flow away from thé joint. Otherwise, the
thin-walled ‘tubing may reach the brazing temperature
faster than the heavy pot, and the brazmg filler metal
might flow. along the hotter tube (and away from the
joint) rather than into the joint.

144.2 Induction Vacuum Brazing

We plan to manually weld the 1%-in.-OD X 5-ft-long

X 0.080-in.-wall packed column of the chemical proc-

essing system in a dry box filled with argon. In
addition, the %-in. tubing that connects the bismuth
head pot to the upper disengaging section of the
column will also be welded in the dry box. Because of
the size and fragility of these large welded sub-
assemblies, we plan to induction braze the reinforcing

sleeves over the weld before the 10-ft assembly is

removed from the dry box. The controlled atmosphere
of the dry box will‘also be utilized to prevent oxidation

of all portions of the assembly which will be heated -

during the welding operation.
In preliminary experiments, we learned that brazing
must be accomplished in vacuum (107 torr) since we

. experienced difficulty with arcing in helium or argon

atmospheres. To add further complication, the organic
binder, which is used to preplace the powdered filler
metal, caused arcing when it began to vaporize. As a
result, it is necessary to vaporize the binder by other
heating techniques before the induction unit is ac-
tivated or else preplace the filler metal without using

“the binder. To eliminate the need for the binder, we

have machined grooves on the inside diameter of
samples of split sleeves to hold the powdered filler
metal. These grooves also allow space for the reinforced
(raised) weld bead. -

We have induction sleeves over tube-to-tube welds in
the atmosphere chamber. However, actual mockup
assemblies have not been brazed but are currently being
prepared.

14.4.3 Induction Field Brazing

Many interconnecting lines of the loop will have to be
joined in the field. Tubing of the sizes ', %, %, and
possibly 7% in. OD will probably be welded and the split

173

sleeves back brazed on site. In this regard, we have

induction field brazed sleeves on all of these sizes of
tubing (Fig. 14.7). We surrounded the part to be brazed
with a quartz tube placed inside the induction coil.
Helium gas flows over the heated area to protect the
braze from air. However, the induction coil is still
operated in air. When the induction unit is activated,
the 2-in.-long section of tubing with the split sleeve is
quickly brought to brazing temperature. Because of the
small amount of material being heated, adjacent areas

 

 

remain relatively cool, and the entire brazing cycle
takes less than 5 min. . _ ‘

We are currently refining our apparatus for main-
taining a protective atmosphere and are preparing to
braze more mockups of actual joint designs.

14.5 COMPATIBILITY OF MATERIALS
WITH BISMUTH

0O.B.Cavin L.R. Trotter

Successful operation of a processing plant for the
extraction of fission products from the fuel salt of an
MSBR is dependent upon the compatibility of the
container material with molten Bi-Li solutions. There-
fore, we are continuing to evaluate the dissolution and
mass transport of potential structural materials in static
capsules and thermal convection loops containing bis-
muth and Bi-Li solutions with up to 2.5 wt % lithium
concentrations. The tests are being conducted at a

maximum temperature of 700°C, and the loops have a

AT of 95 * 5°C. For lithium concentrations up to 100
ppm, we have used quartz loops, but for higher
concentrations of lithium (2.5 wt %) the loop is made
from the material to be tested. -

Previously we reported grain boundary cracking of

small surface grains on recrystallized molybdenum

samples.’ Since cracking was limited to these grains we
hope to circumvent this problem by removing these
grains prior to testing. This was done by electro-
polishing samples after vacuum annealing for 1 hr at
1500°C. These samples were included in loop 11, and
the results are summarized in Table 14 .4. R
The samples lost weight above a temperature of
650°C and gained weight at or below this temperature.
Because of difficulties in removing residual bismuth
from the specimens, we cannot be certain of the
absolute magnitude of the weight changes, although

- they are relatively small. The effect of electropolishing

will be evaluated by metallographic examination of the
specimens. A maximum weight loss of 3.18 mg/cm?
was observed on omne of the tensile samples and
corresponds with a uniform surface removal of 0.36

mil/year. The room-temperature mechanical properties
of the molybdenum were unaffected by exposure to
Bi—100 ppm Li, as indicated in Table 14.5.

Tantalum specimens exposed to Bi + 100 ppm Liin
loop 13 lost weight at all temperatures (Table 14.4).
The maximum loss (45.2 mg/cm?) corresponds to a
corrosion rate of 3.13 mils/year. This does not agree
with results obtained by Shimotake et al. in short-term

tests (100 hr) at 1000 C in which they reported no-

observable corrosion.® The room-temperature me-

‘chanical properties of these samples were unaltered
~ (Table 14.5) even though there was a detectable

decrease in their dimensions, The maximum measurable
change in dimensions corresponds to a uniform surface
removal of 2.6 mils/year, which is in close agreement
with that calculated from weight-change data.
Conversely, the T-111 alloy (Ta—8% W—2% Hf)
tested in loop 12 showed excellent resistance to

-dissolution and mass transport. Tensile samples all

showed slight weight losses of up to 4.45 mg/cm? (0.31

mil/year), but all the tab samples had weight increases

of up to 0.37 mg/cm? (Table 14.4). These weight losses

molybdenum. However, the room-temperature ductility
of the T-111 was drastically reduced, as shown in Table
14.5. This is no different from the data previously
reported for T-111 in pure bismuth.” To determine the
effects of aging T-111 at 700°C, samples were held at
this temperature for 3000 hr in an argon-filled capsule.
No significant changes in the room-temperature me-
chanical properties were observed, and, if anything, the
ductility was slightly higher. The microstructure of the

as-received material shows a grain boundary precipitate.

Similar precipitates have been identified by Inouye® as
HfC and by Sheffler and co-workers’ as a hafnium
oxide. We are presently evaluating the extent to which

such hafnium-rich phases may interact with bismuth or

impurities dissolved in bismuth.

Four grades of graphite were tested in loop 14, and
the weight-change data are shown in Table 14.6. All the
samples increased in weight except the high-density
pyrolytic sample. The available open porosity of grades
AXF-5Q and ATJS are 15 and 13%, respectively, but

‘not primarily upon the total available porosity. Since
graphite generally is an inhomogeneous material as to
density and porosity, samples taken from the same
billet may vary considerably. This, as well as the

uncertainty in complete bismuth removal, could

account for some of the weight-change variations
observed in Table 14.6.

14.6 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITED COATINGS

J.L Federer

Roll bonding of molybdenum tubes to integral bosses
attached to molybdenum vessels is being used to make
mechanical joints. Although these joints can be made
leak-tight, brazing from the outside of the vessel will
reinforce the mechanical bond. A chemical vapor
deposited coating around the joint on the inside of the
vessel is also contemplated as an added precaution. The
coating provides an additional seal that minimizes any

" compatibility problems between the braze alloy and

probably by an intergranular Hf-Bi reaction. If this

reaction resulting in loss of ductility can be eliminated
by some pretreatment of the T-111 or by alloying
additions, a tantalum-base alloy may also be attractive
as container material. Graphite appears suitable if the
- available open porosity can be eliminated, at least at the
surface. Tests will be done to determine the extent to
which bismuth will penetrate commercially available
~ graphites and to evaluate the resistance of pyrolytically
sealed graphite to bismuth and bismuth-lithium in-
“trusion. A molybdenum thermal convection loop is
being readied for operation and will contain Bi—2 5% Li

bismuth. Several joints have been coated for evaluation.
These were made by roll bonding 0.5-in.-OD mo-
lybdenum tubes into 0.5-in.-ID molybdenum cylinders.
The tubes extended about ' in. or more out of the
cylinders. Four joints were coated at 500°C with
0.002-, 0.007-, 0.015-, and 0.018-in.-thick layers of
tungsten. Three other joints were coated at 900°C with
0.005- to 0.009-in.-thick layers of molybdenum. The
joints had very small but measurable helium leak rates
prior to coating (~107® std cc/sec). After coating all

- the joints were leak-tight as determined with a helium

leak detector having a sensxtmty of 8 X 107'? std
cc/sec.

An attempt was made to coat a Hastelloy N loop with

tungsten so that the coating could be tested in flowing

~ bismuth. The loop dimensions, preliminary -coating

experiments, and the method for coating the loop were

described previously.!! Portions of the coated loop
that were accessible to a borescope were visually
examined. The entire loop was radiographed. We
determined that all surfaces of the loop were coated,
but that several small cracks occurred in the coating at
the corners of two joints where tubing was welded
together at approximately a 90° angle. Also, the coating
was thinner in one cross member than elsewhere, and a

Y,-in.-diam blister occurred in the cross member near

one of the joints mentioned above. Subsequently, we
coated the two joints and the cross member again.
Radiography revealed that the cracks on the joints were
filled, the blister was covered, and the coating thickness
in the cross member was comparable to other parts of

‘the loop; however, a new crack was found in the cross

member. This crack was probably caused by the large
difference in thermal expansion between tungsten and
Hastelloy N. The cross member was coated again, but
the crack persisted, and further attempts to coat the
loop have not been made.

Several specimens of types 304 and 430 stainless steel
were nickel plated by the electroless method so that the
adherence of tungsten and molybdenum coatings to the
specimens could be evaluated. The plating method used
for these specimens yielded a phosphorus content of
about 2% in the nickel plate compared with about 8%
phosphorus in specimens plated previously. One spec-
imen of each type steel was coated with about
0.004-in.-thick tungsten. The coating was smooth in
both cases but spalled from the type 430 specimen
during bend testing. Another pair of specimens was

coated with about 0.001- to 0.004-in.-thick mo- .

lybdenum. The coating on the type 304 specimen was
too rough for accurate thickness measurements. The

- coating on the type 430 specimen was much smoother

but spalled during bend testing. Since previous ex-
periments showed that molybdenum coats smoothly on
specimens electroplated with nickel, we believe that the
electroless nickel was responsible for the poor coating
characteristics. These results and the previous obser-
vation!! that both tungsten and molybdenum coatings
are less adherent to electroless nickel containing about
8% phosphorus indicate that electroless nickel is in-
ferior to electroplated nickel for promoting adherence.

14.7 MOLYBDENUM DEPOSITION FROM MoF
J. W. Koger

We have continued to conduct experiments to op-
timize the conditions for coating stainless steel with
molybdenum by contacting the stainless steel with a
molten fluoride salt containing MoF4. Holding temper-
ature and time constant, we have determined- the
concentration of MoF¢ which must be added to our salt
mixture to get a coating. Future plans involve an
evaluation of time and temperature effects on coating
rates and coating integrity.

In one of our more successful runs, microprobe
analysis'? of the type 316 stainless steel capsule on
which molybdenum was deposited showed that mo-
lybdenum was deposited at the sample surface and that
grain boundaries at least 350 u into the metal were
enriched in molybdenum.

~ Part 4. Molten-Salt Processing and Preparation /

L. E. McNeese

Part 4 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the removal of fission
products from molten-salt breeder reactors. During this
period we continued to evaluate and develop a flow-
sheet based on fluorination—reductive extraction for
protactinium isolation and the metal transfer process
for rare-earth removal. The portion of the flowsheet

dealing with recovery and recycle of thé UF¢ from the

fluorinators was modified so that the UF4-F, gas
stream would be directly absorbed in molten salt
containing UF,; and the resulting uranium fluoride
would be reduced to UF; by contact of the salt with
hydrogen. A method was devised for recycling fluorine,
hydrogen, and HF in the plant in order to minimize the
quantity of radioactive waste produced. A study was
completed for determining the capital and operating
costs for a plant that processes the fuel salt from a
1000-MW(e) MSBR on a ten-day cycle. The total direct
and indirect costs for the plant were found to be $20.6

~and $15 million, respectively; thus the total plant

investment required would be $35.6 million. The
resulting fuel cycle cost was 1.12 mills/kWhr. A
0.28-power dependence of processing plant cost on

- processing ‘rate was derived; this indicates that a

considerable saving in processing cost could be achieved
by associating a processing plant with a larger power
generation capacity than 1000 MW(e).

Studies relating to the chemistry of fuel reconstitu-

tion were initiated. It was found that gaseous UFg

reacts quantitatively with UF, dissolved in LiF-BeF,-

- ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) at 600°C to produce soluble

UFs. The molten salt containing UFs appeared to be
stable in both gold and graphite equipment. These re-

sults are in agreement with those from scouting experi-
ments carried out several years ago on fuel reconstitution.

- During this report period we found that the lithium
and bismuth concentrations in LiCl in equilibrium with
lithium-bismuth solutions are higher than initially ex-

- pected and increase markedly as the lithium concentra-

178

tion in the lithium-bismuth solution is increased. We
realized that this could have a significant effect on the
performance of the metal transfer process since lithium-
bismuth solutions having lithium concentrations of 5
and about 50 at. % are proposed for extracting rare
earths from lithium chloride in the process. Therefore, a
study of the equilibrium distribution of lithium and
bismuth between molten LiCl and liquid lithium-
bismuth solutions was initiated. Data obtained thus far
with lithium concentrations of 20 to 50 at. % are
consistent with the observed behavior of lithium in'the
second metal transfer experiment (MTE-2) completed
previously. An engineering experiment involving the
metal transfer process (MTE-2B) is in operation in order
to study further.the behavior of lithium in the process.
The experiment, in which a § at. % lithium-bismuth
solution is being used to extract rare. earths from
lithium chloride, has been in operation for about nine
weeks. To date, the results iridicate that the equilibrium
concentration of lithium in lithium chloride above a 5
at. % lithium-bismuth solution is less than 0.3 wt ppm.

It is not believed that the metal transfer process will be

affected significantly by the unexpected behavior of
 

 

179

lithium and bismuth in the process. The design of the
third engineering experiment (MTE-3) for development

of the process was completed. Most of the equipment

was fabricated, and the main process vessels are now
being installed. The experiment will use salt flow rates
that are 1% of the estimated flow rates requlred for
processing a 1000-MW(e) reactor.

QOur work on contactor development was continued
successfully during this report period. Mass transfer
experiments ‘were carried out in which the rate of
transfer of zirconium from molten salt to bismuth was
measured in a 24-in.-long, 0.82-in.-ID column packed
with Y-in. molybdenum Raschig rings. The results
indicate HTU values of 1 to 4 ft, with the lowest values
being given by data in which we have the most
confidence. These results indicate that packed column
contactors can be used successfully in MSBR processing
systemns. We have initiated studies on mechanically
agitated salt-metal contactors as an alternative to

packed columns. This type of contactor is of particular -

interest for use in the metal transfer process since

designs can be envisioned in which the bismuth would

be a near-isothermal internally circulated captive phase.
The hydrodynamic performance of a mechanically
agitated contactor was investigated using mercury and
water to simulate bismuth and molten salt. These data,

 

along with data from the literature, indicate that
satisfactory mass transfer performance may be achieva-
ble in this contactor without dispersing either the salt
or the metal phase. Contactors of this design may be
easier to fabricate than packed columns, and the

problem of entrainment of bismuth in salt to be

returned to the reactor should be eliminated if the
phases are not dispersed. ‘

We have continued studies of oxide precipitation as
an alternative to the fluorination—reductive-extraction
method for - isolating protactinium and for subsequently
removing uranium from MSBR fuel salt. Protactinium
pentoxide was selectively precipitated from LiF-BeF,-
ThF,; (72-16-12 mole %) that contained up to 0.25
mole % UF,4 by sparging the salt with HF-H, O-Ar gas
mixtures at 600°C. Recent results on the equilibrium
quotient for the precipitation reaction are in agreement
with earlier results and are consistent with earlier
indications that Pa; O can be precipitated from MSBR,
fuel salt as a pure or nearly pure solid phase. Installa-
tion of equipment was completed in preparation for
engineering studies of the precipitation of UQ,-ThO,
solid solutions from molten fluoride salts. Two experi-
ments in which as much as 40% of the uranium initially
in the salt was precipitated were carried out success-
fully. Results of these experiments are encouraging.

15. Flowsheet Analysis

A study was completed in which the capital and
operating costs were determined for a plant that
processes the fuel salt from a 1000-MW(e) MSBR on a
ten-day cycle. The plant is based on the reference
flowsheet that uses fluorination, reductive extraction,
and metal transfer. Capital and operating costs were
calculated for two methods for obtaining and disposing
of hydrogen, HF, and fluorine in a processing plant.

- Calculations were made of the thermal power that will

be produced in an MSBR processing plant by the decay
of noble-metal fission products as a function of the
residence tlmé of these materials in the primary reactor
system and of the fraction of these ;natenals accom-
panying the fuel salt to the processing plant. The
long-term hazard of high-level radioactive wastes pro-
duced by MSBRs was considered. A survey was made of
published data on the availability of and future demand
for natural resources required for an MSBR power
economy. ’ '

shown in Fig. 15.1, includes two significant improve-
ments over the previous version of the flowsheet: (1) an
improved method for recovering UF¢ from the fluorina-
tor off-gas and (2) a method for recycling fluorine,
hydrogen, and HF in the processing plant in order to
minimize the quantity of radioactive waste generated.

The behavior of fission products and other com-
ponents of the fuel salt in the processing plant is
summarized in Table 15.1, which shows only the
dominant removal method for each of several groups of
fuel salt constituents. The removal times for the noble
gases (50 sec) and noble and seminoble metals (2.4 hr)
are short as compared with the ten-day processing
cycle, and only small amounts of these materials are
removed by the processing plant. In the previous
flowsheet,! the fluorinator off-gas (primarily a mixture

carrier salt for return to the reactor. Several difficulties
were encountered with this approach, for example: (1)
the uranium inventory in the UF4 collection system
would be appreciable (3 to 10% of the uranium
inventory in the reactor); (2) beds of granular heat-
emitting solids (NaF) would have to be .filled and
discharged remotely; (3) the discharged NaF would
require subsequent treatment in order to ensure ac-
ceptably low uranium losses; and (4) collection of UF
in the cold traps might be complicated by heat
produced by the decay of fission products that are
desorbed from the NaF beds with the UFg. Initially in
the present study, consideration was given to recycling

--the” unused. fluorine after UFg - collection; however,
“several problems were encountered with this mode of

tions in the fluorine recirculation system and repre-
sented a significant heat source (210 kW as shown in

Sect. 15.3); and (2) maintenance on the sealed dia-
phragm-type fluorine compressors is known to be
higher than desired. The alternative of disposing of the
unused fluorine by absorption in aqueous KOH solu-
tions was unattractive because of the large volume of
radioactive waste (mostly KF) that was generated.

In the current flowsheet, difficulties associated with
UFs collection and recycle or disposal of unused
fluorine were avoided by sending the F,-UF4 ‘gas
mixture directly to the UF, reduction step, where both
the F, and UF are absorbed in a sufficient quantity of
molten salt containing UF, to produce an average
uranjum valence between 4+ and 5+. The resulting
uranium fluoride is reduced to UF, by contact of the
salt mixture with hydrogen. The reconstituted fuel salt
is then returned to the reactor after a final cleanup
operation. The HF produced in the UFg reduction
operation is sent to a remotely operated fluorine plant,
~where F, and H, are generated for recycle to the
processing plant. As discussed in Sect. 15.2, the cost for
-recycling the fluorine and hydrogen via a fluorine
generation plant is only 0.024 mill/kWhr as compared
with a total cost of 0.11 mill/kWhr associated with
absorbing the HF in an aqueous KOH solution and
disposing of the resulting radioactive wastes. ‘

Cost estimate. In preparing the cost estimate, prelimi-
nary designs for all major process equipment items were
completed, and the equipment cost was estimated using
unit costs for fabricating the various structural shapes.
The general design criteria assumed that a material
having a cost equal to that of Hastelloy N would be
used for vessels containing only molten salt and that
molybdenum would be used for vessels that contained
bismuth. The cost of fabricated molybdenum equip-
ment was assumed to be $200/lb; a value of this
magnitude was used because of the difficulty of
fabricating molybdenum. The costs of piping, instru-
mentation, and certain auxiliary equipment items were
estimated as appropriate fractions of the costs of
fabricated equipment items. '

A -summary of the capital costs for the processing
plant is shown in Table 15.2. The total direct and
indirect costs-are $20.6 and $15 million, respectively;
- thus the total plant investment is $35.6 million.

Fuel cycle cost. A breakdown of the fuel cycle cost is
given in Table 15.3 for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR that is
processed on a ten-day cycle (a processing rate of 0.88
~gpm) by fluorination—reductive extraction—metal
transfer. The inventory charges on fissile materials and
salt in the reactor are those given for the reference
MSBR design.® The net fuel cycle cost (1.12 mills/
kWhr) is composed largely of fixed charges on the

15.2 COMPARISON OF COSTS FOR ALTERNATE
OFF-GAS TREATMENT METHODS FOR AN
MSBR PROCESSING PLANT

W. L. Carter 7

Capital. and operating costs associated with two
-methods (see Fig. 15.3) for obtaining and disposing of
HF, H,, and F, in a plant were determined. In the first
method, HF, H,, and F, are purchased, and the H, and
HF that appear in the plant off-gas are subsequently
‘disposed of; in the second, the HF and H, from the
plant off-gas are collected, and the HF is electrolyzed to
produce H, and F,, which are recycled to the
processing plant. The once-through gas cycle results in
the purchase of a large amount of F,, H,, and HF and
in the generation of a significant volume of radioactive
wastes. The second method, however, results-in the
“purchase of only minor amounts of HF and H, and
produces only a small quantity of radioactive waste.
‘The principal fission product activity in the process
off-gas is iodine, although small amounts of bromine,

krypton, xenon, and volatile noble and seminoble metal
fluorides are also present. .

Once-through gas cycle. As shown in Fig. 15.3,
hydrogen and HF are collected from the plant off-gas
streams resulting from UFg reduction, hydrofluorina-
tion of bismuth, and hydrogen sparging. The combined
HF-H, stream enters a caustic scrubber, where it is
contacted with an aqueous KOH solution for removal
of HF, HI, and HBr. It was assumed that 135 ft* of 10
M KOH solution would be recirculated through the
scrubber for 100 hr and that the KOH concentration
would be reduced to 0.5 M during this period. The heat

~ generation rate in the scrubber solution after 100 hr
would be about 153 kW, and the solution would be
held for an additional 400 hr for fission product decay

  
   

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before the solution is evaporated to produce a solid
waste residue. Evaporation is carried out in the waste

- container, which has a diameter of 2 ft and a length of

10 ft. This is the largest waste container presently

considered for interment in a salt mine. The aqueous

condensate produced by evaporation of the waste is
recycled to produce additional 10 M KOH solution.

The hydrogen stream leaving the scrubber is assumed
to contain low concentrations of SeFg and TeF,. The
gas is passed through a dryer, an Al,O; bed for
sorption of SeF¢ and TeF;, and a charcoal bed for
retention of noble gases. About 10.5 scfm of hydrogen
is discharged to the stack. j

This offgas treatment method results in the produc-
tion of 489 kg of solid waste per day and requires that

105 waste cans be stored annually in a salt mine.
Approximately 66 kg of fluorine, 102 kg of HF, and 41
kg of hydrogen would be required daily.

~ Recycle of H, and F, via electrolysis. In this off-gas
treatment method, hydrogen and HF are collected from
the various off-gas streams in the process. The mixture
is compressed to a pressure of about 2 atm and chilled
to a temperature of —40°C to condense the bulk of the
HF. The liquid HF is distilled at essentially total reflux
to separate volatile fission product fluorides (principally
HI, HBr, SeFg, and TeFg). About 70 kg of HF is
electrolyzed per day in a remotely operated fhiorine
plant in order to produce the hydrogen and fluorine
that are required for plant operation. The remaining HF
is recycled to the plant, where it is used principally for
hydrofluorination of bismuth streams containing dis-
solved metals.

The hydrogen stream leaving the HF condensation
and distillation operations will contain most of the
fission product activity in the initial H,-HF stream and
a small amount of HF. This gas stream is contacted with
an aqueous KOH solution to remove HF, HI, and HBr.

It is assumed that 20 ft* of 10 M KOH solution will be

recirculated through the scrubber for 34 days. At the

185

end of this period, the KOH concentration will have
been reduced to 0.5 M, and the steady-state heat
generation rate in the solution will be 210 kW. The
solution would be held for 45 days for fission product
decay before it is evaporated to produce a solid waste.
The solid waste production rate is only 9.7 kg/day, and
only 2.1 containers having a diameter of 2 ft and a
length of 10 ft would be filled annually.

The hydrogen stream leaving the caustic scrubber is
dried and recycled to the processing plant. About 5%
(0.5 scfm) of the hydrogen is discarded through an
Al,O; bed (for removal of SeFg and TeFg) and a
charcoal bed (for retention of noble gases). This off-gas
treatment system requires the purchase of only 1.4 kg

of hydrogen and 13.4 kg of HF per day.

Comparison of costs for off-gas treatment. Costs
associated with the 'operation of the two off-gas
treatment methods were determined by calculating the
capital equipment and operating charges for each.
Results of these calculations are summarized in Table
15.4 for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR that is processed on a
ten-day cycle. The contribution to the fuel cycle cost
for the once-through gas cycle is about 0.11 mill/kWhr,
while the cost for the treatment system resulting in

almost complete recycle is only 0.024 mill/kWhr. The
higher cost- for the once-through gas cycle is due
primarily to the cost of disposing of a relatively large
quantity of solid waste and to the purchase of fluorine.
The most significant cost for the gas recycle method is

186

amortization of the remote fluorine plant, which hasa

direct cost of $1.005 million. In making the cost
estimate, capital costs were amortized at 13.7%/year.
Salt mine storage charges* were assumed to be $300 per
waste container, which is the minimum interment
charge.- Based on  this comparison, the gas recycle

salt and will be extracted into bismuth in the protac-

tinium isolation system. If the removal of 1% of the
noble metals from the holdup volume occurs with a
residence time of 1 min, the heat generation in the
processing plant will be increased by 200 kW, with the
bulk of the heat being generated in the UF¢ recovery

result if 10% of the noble metals reached the processing

REMOVAL TIMES ON THE HEAT GENERATION
RATE IN AN MSBR PROCESSING PLANT
M.J.Bell L.E.McNeese

The thermal power that will be generated in an MSBR
processing plant by decay of the noble-metal fission
products will depend on' the residence time- of these

removal time and the noble-metal removal time since
halogens are produced by the decay of some noble
metals. If the noble metals are removed from the fuel
salt on a very short cycle, their daughters are prevented
from entering the fuel salt and thus will not reach the
processing plant. The heat -generation rate rtesulting
from the decay of halogen fission products is shown in
Fig. 15.5. An effective noble-metal removal time of 0.1

‘day is believed to be reasonable for -the present

elements in the primary reactor system and the frac- -

tions of these elements accompanying the fuel salt to
the processing plant. We have performed a series of
calculations in which the noble metals were assumed to
be transferred from the fuel salt, on a 50-sec cycle, into
a holdup volume having a residence time ranging from 1
sec to 1 year, The holdup volume was assumed to be in
contact with fuel salt so that materials produced by the

flowsheet. This would result in a heat generation rate of
210 kW for the halogens for a halogén removal time of
ten days or 520 kW for a removal time of three days.

- For a noble-metal residence time in the holdup volume

as long as one year, the halogen thermal power would
be increased by only 60% over that for a 0.1-day

- residence time.

decay of noble metals could return to the fuel salt if |

these materials were not noble metals. The model is
sufficiently general that the holdup volume could
represent noble metals associated with circulating gas
bubbles, a stagnant film of noble metals in a pump

“tank, or noble metals deposited on graphite and metal

surfaces. The residual thermal power of the noble
metals leaving the holdup volume is shown in Fig. 15.4
as a function of residence time in the holdup volume.
The residual thermal power is defined as the integral,
over all time, of the instantaneous heat generation rate
for all isotopes leaving the holdup volume. The noble
metals were divided into two groups: those that form
stable volatile fluorides (As, Se, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Sb,
and Te) and those that do not (Rh, Pd, and Ag).
Elements in the first group are assumed to be com-
pletely removed from the salt in the primary fluorina-

it was assumed that the thorium in the waste salt would
not be recovered, that 0.5% of the reactor uranium
inventory would be discarded over the 30-year life of

the plant, and that all of the transuranium isotopes and

" their daughters would be present in the waste. The

removal times for the transuranium elements were
assumed to be ten days except in the case of neptu-

The volume of water required to dilute the three
types of high-level wastes to the radioactivity concen-
tration guide values for continuous ingestion in unre-
stricted areas is shown in Table 15.5 for wastes of
various ages. Also shown for comparison are the
volumes of water required to dilute comparable quanti-
ties of (1) uranium ore tailings and (2) material
containing uranium and - thorium at concentrations
equal to their respective average concentrations in the
earth’s crust. The quantities of these materials used in
the comparison were assumed to be those that would
occupy the same volume as the high-level waste and
associated salt and shale in the proposed Federal salt
mine repository. Wastes aged 300 years would present
an ingestion hazard similar to that from uranium ore
tailings, and wastes aged 10,000 years would present a
hazard about one order of magnitude greater than that
associated with naturally occurring uranium and tho-
rium at their average concentrations in the earth’s crust.

The study. identified two potential problems relating
to the MSBR fuel cycle, as envisioned at the present
time. As a result of the inefficient use of relatively
inexpensive thorium in the present MSBR concept, the
mass of wastes produced per MW(e) by an MSBR is
substantially greater than the masses of waste produced
by the other reactor types. Also, MSBR wastes aged one

million years or more have a greater ingestion hazard
associated with them than other waste types, princi-
pally as the result of radioactivity from 232 Th daugh-

ters. Both of these problems can be alleviated by

making more efficient use of thorium in the fuel cycle,
which is, at present, utilized with an efficiency of only
13.7%. We are investigating processing schemes that can
increase the thorium utilization to greater than 90% and
thus eliminate these problems. -

The study also revealed that a greater ingestion hazard
is associated with MSBR wastes during the period

30,000 to 1 million years as the result of the presence

of 22Ra, a daughter of 23%Pu. The isotope 23%Pu
exists in MSBR wastes in substantial concentrations as a
result of the long removal time for neptunium and the
short removal time for plutonium in the present
processing scheme. The amount of 238Pu in the MSBR
wastes could be reduced by removing neptunium more
efficiently or by use of a processing scheme that would
allow  plutonium to remain in the fuel salt and be
consumed by neutron capture. Both of these possi-
bilities are being .considered as nnprovements to the
present processing flowsheet.

15.5 AVAILABILITY OF NATURAL

MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS

M. J. Bell

A study has been made of published data on the
availability of and future demand for natural resources
of special importance to the MSBR program.® Materials
considered in the survey included the -constituents of
coolant and fuel salts, Hastelloy N, and materials
required for construction and operation of a chemical
processing plant. Table 15.6 presents the cumulative
demand for a number of materials through the year
2000, compares the requirements of the assumed MSBR
economy with those of the rest of the world, and
compares the world demand with world reserves and
estimated world resources of these materials. The

known world reserves of beryllium, fluorine, and
bismuth are being rapidly depleted by non-MSBR uses
and are expected to be exhausted before the end of the
century. Ample beryllium resources (in the form of
bertrandite) and fluorine (in the form of phosphate
rock) exist; however, an improved mining technology

‘will be required to make recovery of these materials

economical. Bismuth resources are limited by the
demand for lead, copper, and zinc ores from which
bismuth is recovered as a by-product. In order to satisfy
the cumulative world demand through the year 2000, it
is necessary that new base metal ores be developed and
that the technology for recovering bismuth during the
refining of copper and zinc ores be improved. '

Ores from which thoria can be recovered for $10/1b
will be available well into the next century. Large
reserves of higher-priced thoria are also available. MSR
demands for all materials, with the exception of
thorium and hafnium, comprise only a small fraction of
the world demand for these materials and will not
require the development of new industries for the sole
purpose of sustaining an MSBR economy.

Studies relating to the metal transfer process':? for
the removal of rare-earth and other fission products
from MSBR fuel salt were continued. Included in this
work were measurements.of the equilibrium distri-
bution of lithium and bismuth between liquid Li-Bi
alloys and molten LiCl, and of the mutual solubilities of
thorium and selected rare earths in liquid bismuth. The
equilibrium precipitation of Pa,0s from MSBR fuel
salt by sparging with HF-H, O-H,-Ar gas mixtures was
also studied. The effect of temperature on the solubility
of Pa, Qs in fuel salt that was also saturated with ThO,
was determined. Studies relating to the chemistry of
fuel reconstitution were begun. The initial phase of this
work involves a study of the reaction of gaseous UF
with UF 4 dissolved in MSBR fuel salt.

Work done at Argonne National Laboratory® with
LiCI-LiF solutions indicated that high lithium and
bismuth concentrations (up to 0.1 mole %) might be
expected in LiCl that is in equilibrium with lithium-
bismuth solutions in which the lithium concentration is
5 to 50 at. %. Concentrations of this magnitude could
have a significant effect on the performance of the
metal transfer process. Consequently, we have initiated
a.study of the equilibrium distribution of lithium and
bismuth between molten LiCl and liquid lithium-
bismuth solutions. The results of this study should aid
in optimizing operating conditions for the metal
transfer process.

In this study, LiCl containing less than 0.05 mole %
LiOH was ethbrated with various lithium-bismuth

_solutions at 650°C. Thorium was added to the system

in some cases to minimize the oxide and hydroxide
concentrations in the salt. The apparatus and general
procedure have been described eisewhere.* The equi-

librium lithium concentration in the salt phase was

generally determined by removing a salt sample with a
stainless steel sampler, hydrolyzing the sample in water,
and measuring the amount of hydrogen evolved by a
gas-ch:omatographlc procedure. Samples for bismuth

analysis were takén with quartz samplers. When the

bismuth concentration in the salt was greater than
about 100 wt ppm, a colorimetric analytical method
was used. An inverse-polarographic method was used
for the determination of bismuth at lower concen-
trations. - :

‘Data obtained thus far at 650°C are summarized in
Table 16.1. As can be seen in the table, both the
equilibrium lithium and bismuth concentrations in the
salt phase increased markedly as the lithium concen-
tration in the metal phase was increased. This is also
shown quite clearly in Fig. 16.1, which is a log-log plot
of lithium concentration in the salt phase vs lithium

concentration in the metal phase. In those cases where

both lithium and bismuth analyses of the salt were
made, the Li/Bi atom ratio in the dissolved species was
about 3. Thus, the dramatic increase in the equilibrium

concentrations of lithium and bismuth in the salt with

increasing lithium - concentration in the metal phase
appears to be .related to the simultaneous increase in

~ concentration in the metal phase of a saltlike species,

such as Li3Bf, which has a high solubility in LiCl. The
data given in Table 16.1 indicate that the presence of
thorium in the metal phase had no measurable effect on
the distribution of lithium and bismuth between the
two phases. Measurements have also been made of the
solubilities of pure bismuth and of Li;Bi in molten
LiCl. The preliminary results indicate that the solubility
of bismuth is about 0.1 wt ppm at 650°C, whereas the
solubility of Li,; Bi is about 0.3 mole %.

The magnitude of the equilibrium lithium and
bismuth concentrations in LiCl determined in this
investigation is consistent with the limited amount of

192

previous work done at Argonne National Laboratory®-*
with LiCl-LiF (75-25 mole %) as the salt phase and solid
Li3Bi or liquid Li-Bi (50-50 at. %) as the metal phase.
We do not agree, however, that the Li/Bi atom ratio in
the species dissolved in the salt is markedly lower than
3 when the metal phase is a lithium-bismuth solution
rather than solid Li;Bi. The present study also yielded
values for the solubility of pure bismuth in LiCl that
were substantially lower than those obtained by the
ANL workers® with the molten LiCl-LiF salt phase.
Extrapolation of the results of this study indicates

~ that the equilibrium concentrations of both lithium and
~bismuth will be less than 1 wt ppm in LiCl that is in

equilibrium with Li-Bi (595 at. %), which is the
composition of the alloy proposed for stripping the
trivalent rare earths and thorium from the LiCl in the
metal transfer process.!>? Lithium and bismuth dis-
solved in the LiCl at these low concentrations should
not produce a deleterious effect on the performance of
this part of the metal transfer process. However, the
present results indicate that the lithium and bismuth
concentrations in the LiCl in contact with the divalent
rare-earth strip solution, Li-Bi (50-50 at. %), would be
about 0.3 and 0.1 mole % respectively. These concen-
trations are sufficiently high that a significant amount
of lithium and bismuth (as much as 370 and 1110
moles/day, respectively) will transfer from the lithium-
bismuth solution used to remove divalent rare earths

In each of a set of experiments, 300 g of biSmuth
containing the equivalent.of about 2000 ppm of rare

earth (either La or Nd) and about 4000 ppm of thorium

was equilibrated for at least 8 hr at several temperatures
between 750 and 300°C. At the end of each equili-
bration period, a filtered sample of the liquid phase was
removed for analysis. The expenments were initiated by
heatmgr the system to about 750°C, where both the
thorium and the rare-earth metal were soluble. The
temperature of ‘the system was then progressively
lowered to about 300°C; finally, the temperature was

returned, in steps, to 750°C. The results from one of

our recent experiments (LA-3), along with those from a
previous® experiment (LA-2), are shown in Fig. 16.2.
Agreement among the results of these two experiments
is obvious. As the temperature of the system was
lowered, the thorium concentration in the liquid
remained at its ongmal value until about 650°C was
feached. Below 650°C, the thorium concentratmn in
the liquid decreased regularly with decreasing temper-
ature (Fig. 16.2). The equilibrium thorium concen-

trations in each experiment are in excellent agreement
with the published? values for the solubility of thorium
in liquid bismuth. Similarly, as the temperature was
lowered, the lanthanum concentration in the liquid
remained at its original value until some temperature
below 550°C was reached; then it decreased regularly
with decreasing temperature (Fig. 16.2). The lanthanum
behavior in each experiment was identical. The equi-

- librium lanthanum concentrations in the liquid were

much lower than the reported solubility values.®+® On
the basis of the lanthanum results, we postulate the
formation of a La- and Th-containing solid phase that
has a very low solubility in liquid bismuth. The results
obtained for thorium indicate that there was sufficient
thorium present in the system to satisfy the solubility
product of the compound containing the rare earth and
thorium and to saturate the system with thorium
bismuthide. In this case, the maximum thorium concen-
tration in solution at a given temperature is determined
by the solubility of thorium in bismuth. The variation

of thorium solubility in bismuth with temperature has

been shown” to follow the usual relationship
log Ny =A'+B'T. e
Substitution of Eq.(3) into Eq. (2) yields
xlogN;,=4"+B"IT,

indicating that a plot of the logarithm of the lanthanum
concentration in the bismuth solution vs 1/T should be
linear. As seen in Fig. 16.2, lanthanum behaved as
predicted. It should be noted that a value of x cannot
be determined from data obtained in the manner
outlined above if thorium bismuthide is present as a
second solid phase.

An experiment (Nd-6) with neodymium as the rare

earth was conducted in the same manner as experiments
LA-2 and LA-3, and the results obtained were similar to
those obtained with lanthanum. In addition, an approx-
imate value of x = 1 was obtained in an experiment
(E-70) conducted entirely at 640°C. In this experiment,
neodymium was added to a thorium-bismuth solution,
and the equilibrium concentrations in solution were
determined after each addition. From Eq. (1), a plot of

% Nd and about 3500 ppm of Th. The temperature of
the system was varied between 500 and 700°C, and
samples of the liquid phase were removed at selected
temperatures. Analyses of these samples showed that
both the thorium and neodymium concentrations in the
liqguid were much lower than the solubilities of the
respective bismuthides. From these results, we assumed
that only one solid phase, a Nd- and Th-containing
compound, was present. Assuming x = I, we calculated
the mole fraction solubility product Ky, = NygNtp,
using data from the three experiments involving neo-
dymium. The resulting log Kp, vs 1/T plot is shown in

Ksp(Nd-Th) = 3.233 — 7285/H°K). Assuming that x is
also 1 for the La- and Th-containing solid phase, we

_.obtain, from Fig. 16.2, log Ksp(La-Th) = 2410 —

6480/ T(°K).
In reference to the metal transfer process,' ** the K,

_values for both lanthanum and neodymium indicate

that the desired thorium and rare-earth concentrations
should be attainable in the lithium-bismuth strip so-
lutions without precipitation of a rare-earth- and
thorium-containing compound if the temperature of the
trivalent rare-earth strip solution Li-Bji (595 at. %) is
kept at 600°C or higher.

Using the data and interpretation given above, we
considered a scheme for removing rare earths from
MSBR fuel salt that involved reductive extraction

followed by selective precipitation of thorium bis-

muthide. Rare-earth fission products would be ex-
tracted from fuel salt that is free of uranium and
protactinium into bismuth that contains lithium and
thorium as reductants. If the extraction were conducted
at 600°C, the thoriym concentration in the bismuth
leaving the extraction unit would be about 1800 wt
ppm for the reference case of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR and
a 25-day rare-earth removal cycle. The corresponding
rare-earth concentration would be less than 107% mole
fraction. Equilibrium cooling of the bismuth to 350°C
would precipitate thorium bismuthide and decrease the
thorium concentration in solution to about 35 wt ppm.
No rare earths would precipitate because their concen-
trations in solution would be too low to satisfy the Ksp
for .the compound containing the rare earth and
thorium. For example, the K, for the La-containing
solid at 350°C is about 1072, With a thorium concen-
tration of 35 wt ppm (Ny, = 2.9 X 107%), the
lanthanum concentration in solution could be as high as
3 X 107* mole fraction (about 240 wt ppm) without
precipitation of a La-containing solid. The supernatant
solution resulting from the precipitation of thorium
bismuthide would be removed, and the dissolved species
(Li, Th, and rare earths) would be stripped, either by
hydrofluorination or hydrochlorination, into a suitable
salt phase for disposal. The clean bismuth would then
be used to- dissolve the thorium bismuthide, more
thorium and lithium would be added, and the resulting
solution would be recycled to the reductive extraction
unit. The thorium decontamination factor for the
conditions cited above would be about 100 but could
be increased to about 1000 if the extraction were
conducted at 750°C and the resulting bismuth solution
were cooled to 300°C. The decontamination factor is
not affected markedly by increasing the rare-earth

removal cycle to at least- 100 days. The chief dis-
advantage of the above scheme is the economic penalty
‘involved in the large lithium and thorium losses, about
30 and 15 kg/day, respectively, for the reference case.

16.3 OXIDE PRECIPITATION STUDIES
O.K. Tallent F.J. Smith

 Studies in support of the development of oxide _

precipitation processes for isolating protactinium and
uranium from MSBR fuel salt have been: continued.
Previous work’® has shown that addition of oxide to a
salt solution containing Pa®* results in precipitation of
pure, or nearly pure, Pa,Os and that Pa,Os can be
precipitated in preference to UQ,.!!'12 We are in-

vestigating a process in which salt from the reactor

would be treated with the appropriate HF-H,0-H, gas

mixture to convert practically all of the protactinium to

Pa®* and to precipitate a large fraction of the protac-
tinium as Pa, 05 without precipitating uranium oxide.
We have also determined the effect of temperature on

the solubility of Pa,Os in MSBR fuel salt that was

- saturated with both ThO, and NiO. These measure-
ments aid in defining the lowest protactinium concen-
trations attainable at a given temperature without
changing the uranium or thorium concentrations in the
salt. ‘ L

Protactinium has been systematically precipitated

from molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, solutions at about

- 600°C by equilibrating the salt with various HF-H,0-Ar

and HF-H,O-H,-Ar gas mixtures. The data obtained
with HF-H, O-Ar gas mixtures were considered in terms
of the equilibrium

some value A, Eq. (5) can be written, in logarithmic
form, as

For a given value of A, a log-log plot of protactinium

concentration in the salt vs HF partial pressure should

" be-linear with a slope of 2.5. If the gas present at

equilibrium contains hydrogen in addition to HF .and
H, 0, tetrapositive protactinium is produced according
to the reaction '

Eq. (8) thus yields:

Two experiments designed to yield values of Q, at
600°C have been completed. Each experiment was
initiated by loading 200 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %), a weighed amount of 233U oxide, the
equivalent of about 100 wt ppm of 23!Pa, and 1 mCi
of 233Pa tracer into a nickel vessel. After the system
had been heated to 600°C, the salt was sparged for two
days with HF-H, (50-50 mole %) to dissolve the
uranium and protactinium in the salt. After residual HF
and H, had been removed by sparging with argon,
filtered samples of the salt were taken for analysis. By
analysis, the initial uranium concentration in the salt
was 0.288 + 0.028 wt % (about 0.08 mole %) in
experiment I and was 0.93 * 0.03 wt % (about 0.25
mole %) in experiment II. The salt was then sparged
with either an HF-H, O-Ar or an HF-H,0-H,-Ar gas
mixture. A standardized aqueous HF-H,O solution
(H; O/HF mole ratio = 3) was fed at a controlled rate to

- @ heated vaporizer, using a Sage syringe pump with a
 

Teflon syringe and piston. The vaporizer was a heated
cylindrically shaped 500-ml Monel vessel that had a
gold-plated cup in the bottom. The HF-H,0 solution
was fed into the cup, where it was vaporized and then
was carried into the nickel reaction vessel by a stream
of argon or an Ar-H, mixture. The argon and hydrogen
flow rates were controlled using calibrated DP cells. In
all cases, the salt was sampled without measurably
changing the composition of the gas phase. In prelim-
inary experiments, in which samples of the salt were
removed periodically, it was shown that equilibrium
was attained in less than 16 hr. All data reported below
were obtained by allowing at least 16 hr for equili-
bration. Each sample was first analyzed for protac-
tinium by gamma spectrometry and then was submitted
to the Analytical Chemistry Division for dissolution and
analyses for 23'Pa and 233U by the alpha-pulse-height
method.

Data obtained at 600°C in the two experiments
outlined above are summarized in Table 16.2. As seen,
when HF-H,0-Ar gas mixtures were used, the equi-

‘considerable variation,

regularly with the partial pressure of HF in the gas
mixture. A log-log plot of the protactinium concen-
tration vs pyy is shown in Fig. 16.4. The protactinium
concentrations used in this plot were those obtained by
gamma spectrometry, since this analytical method gave
what appeared to be the most accurate and self-

consistent results. Increasing the UF, concentration

from 0.08 to 0.25 mole % had no measurable effect on
the equilibrium protactinium concentrations. The slope

of the line in Fig. 16.4 is 2.5; we interpret this as

confirmation that the equlhbrlum involved was that
given by Eq. (4). The equation of the line is log (wt
ppm Pa) = 2.5 log pyp + 4.870, from which we derive
log Np,p, = 2.5 log PHF — 1.6925. Since 4 = 3, we
obtain Q1 = 3.2 at 600°C.

~The wuranium analyses of the salt, desplte their
support the contention that
protactlmum oxide was precipitated as a pure solid
phase. However, we do not yet have sufficient data to
define accurately the lowest protactinium concen-
trations attainable under given conditions without

 

librium protactinium concentration in the salt varied  precipitating uranium and thorium oxides. Our data

can probably be reduced to about 5 wt ppm without
the attendant precipitation of uranium oxide.

When hydrogen was present in the gas mixture, the
equilibrium protactinium concentration at a given value
of pyp was higher than that obtained in the absence of
hydrogen (Table 16.2). We attribute this behavior to
~ the formation of Pa%, according to Eq. (7). The values

The current flowsheet? for the processing of MSBR
fuel involves removal of the uranium from the salt as

UF¢ by fluorination prior to isolation of protactinium

by reductive extraction and removal of rare earths by
the metal - transfer process. The proposed fuel re-
constitution method consists in contacting, in the
presence of hydrogen, the purified UF, with carrier salt

We have begun a more comprehensive study of the
chemistry involved in the fuel reconstitution step. Our
initial goals were to establish the validity of  the
stoichiometry of reaction (15) and to find a suitable
material for containing molten-salt solutions in which

- uranium is present in oxidation states higher than 4+,

~ The experimental equipment is shown schematically.
in Fig. 16.6. The UF4 generation system consisted of a
1-1b UF, cylinder fitted with the appropriate -control

valves and gages and a calibrated DP cell for the
accurate control of UFg flow rates. The entire
generation system was wrapped with resistance heaters
and thermal insulation so that it could be maintained at
65 to 70°C. The nickel reaction vessel, which was
similar to the vessels used in our related studies,* was
equipped with %-in.-diam ports for a thermowell and
sparge tube and a Y% -in.-diam ball-valve sample port.
The general experimental procedure used was as
follows: First, the UFg generation system was re-
peatedly pressurized and purged with UF¢ at about 15

‘psig in order to remove argon from the lines and valves.
Excess UF¢ was vented to NaF trap No. 1 (Fig. 16.6). -

 

 

 

 

 

"A predetermined amount of UF¢ was then metered into

purified molten salt contained in a crucible inside the

nickel reaction vessel. The UF¢ flow rates generally
‘ranged from 0.1 to 0.25 g/min. Argon was admitted at a

low flow rate at point B (Fig. 16.6) at the same time
that UFs was flowing into the reaction vessel. This

argon flow was maintained after the UF introduction -

period until the thermocouple and sparge tube had been
retracted to positions above the salt level. The system
was then left under argon for the desired period of time
before the salt was sampled. Samples were taken by
inserting a cold graphite rod through the ball valve into

- the salt and withdrawing it rapidly. The sample was

hydrolyzed in phosphoric acid, and the resultant
solution was analyzed for total uranium and U®". We
assumed that uranium present in the salt in an
oxidation state other than 4+ was present as UFs, and
thus on hydrolysis the following reaction occurred:

W =U*+US . - (18)

Obviously, when all the uranium in the salt is present in
the 5+ state, the U®* concentration is one-half the total
urapnium concentration. _

Our first series of experiments was initiated by
loading 2.9 g of UF, and 197.1 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF,

graphite crucible, which was then sealed in the nickel
reaction vessel under argon and heated to 600°C. When
molten, the salt produced a pool about 2 in. deep. The
salt was then sparged with HF-H, (50-50 mole %) for
about two days to ensure dissolution of the UF, and to
remove oxide from the system. The sparge tube used

for the hydrofluorination was fabricated of a relatively -

low-density spectrographic-grade graphite. Analysis of
the salt after hydrofluorination gave the expected 1.1

wt % uranium. With the system at 600°C, we attempted -

to introduce UF4 gas into the system through the
graphite sparge tube, which extended to within Y%, in. of
the bottom of the reaction vessel. However, the UF,
was quantitatively reduced to UF, at the inlet of the
tube, even though the temperature was 200°C or lower

. at this point. Analysis of the salt after this attempt

showed that the uranium concentration in the salt was
still 1.1 wt %.

Prior to a second test, the graphite sparge tube was

replaced by one made of high-fired Al,0;. Then, five
times the amount of UFs necessary to convert the
uranium to UFs was fed to the system. Following the
addition, the Al,0; sparge tube was retracted to a
position above the liquid salt, and the system was

" maintained under an argon atmosphere for several hours

before the salt was sampled. Analyses showed that all of
the uranium added to the system was present in the salt
(the uranium concentration had inereased from 1.1 to
5.1 wt %), but little, if any, UF; was produced. The
Al, O; sparge tube had been severely corroded.

The Al,O; sparge tube was replaced by one made of
copper, and the amount of UF4 required to convert all
of the UF,; in the salt to UF; was introduced. The
copper sparge tube was then retracted so that it was not
in contact with the molten salt, and the system was
again maintained under argon for several hours before
the salt. was sampled. Analyses of the samples showed

that all of the uranium introduced as UF¢ had been

absorbed in the salt; the total uranium concentration
was now 9.63 wt %. About 60% of the uranium was

present as UFs, and the Cu/UF, ratio was about 1. The.
copper sparge tube was badly corroded. Either the

copper had reacted with UF, according to the reaction

UFe(@) + Cu(®) = UF4(@) + CuFy () (19)

during the 0.5-hr period in which UF was being added
to the system, or it was corroded according to the
following sequence of reactions:

UF¢(g) + UF4(d) = 2UFs(d), (15)

2UF5(d) + Cu(s) = CuF,(d) + 2UF,(d) . (20)

Despite the corrosion of the copper sparge tube, the
results of this test strongly indicated that the graphite
crucible was inert, at least for a short time, to UF,
dissolved in a molten salt.

Even more convincing evidence for the stability of
graphite to dissolved UF; was obtained in the final test
in this series. The salt from the prior test involving the
copper sparge tube was left at 600°C under argon for
about two days while we awaited analyses of the
samples. Once these analyses were available, the amount
of UF, necessary to convert the 40% of the uranium
calculated to be present as UF, to UFs was admitted to
the system through a gold sparge tube. The gold was
unaffected during the 0.5-hr period required for the
addition of the UF4. After the gold sparge tube had
been retracted, the salt was left under argon for about 6

~ hr before it was sampled. Analyses confirmed not only

that all of the uranium added as UFs; had been
absorbed (the total uranium concentration was 12.8 wt
% compared with the expected 12.5%) but also that the
uranium was present in the salt, within analytical
uncertainty, as UFs (the U®* concentration in the acid
was equivalent to 6.57% U%* in the salt). These results
strongly indicate that the UF; concentration in the salt
had not been reduced in the two-day period between
the tests with the copper and gold sparge tubes,
providing additional confirmation that graphite is stable
to UF; dissolved in molten:LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole - %). These results also support the stoichiometry
of reaction (15) and suggest that gold would be a
suitable material for the containment of dissolved UFs.
Consequently, we are planning an experiment in gold
apparatus not only to evaluate the long-term stability of -
gold to dissolved UF; but also to obtain further
confirmation of the stoichiometry of reaction (15).

 
 

 

 

. 17. Engineering Development of Processing Operations

L. E. McNeese

Studies related to the development of a number of
processing operations were continued during this report
period. Additional information on the behavior of
lithium during metal transfer experiment MTE-2 was
developed. The data are consistent with recently ob-
tained data on the concentration of lithium in LiCl that
is in equilibrium with lithium-bismuth solutions. A new
experiment (MTE-2B) is under way to study further the
transfer of lithium from a Li-Bi solution containing
lithium at the ‘concentration proposed for extracting
trivalent rare earths from lithium chloride (5 at. %).
Studies on mechanically agitated salt-metal contactors,
which are being developed as an alternative to packed
columns, were also continued during this period. The
design of the third engineering experiment for develop-
ment of the metal transfer process (MTE-3) has been
completed, and most of the equipment has been
fabricated. Installation of the completed equipment
items is in progress. Mass transfer experiments were
begun in which the rate of transfer of zirconium from
molten salt to bismuth was measured during the
countercurrent contact of salt and bismuth in a packed
column. Equations were developed for predicting the
rate of heat generation in a frozen-wall fluorinator that
uses radio-frequency induction heating. Calculations
were carried out for predicting the performance of
continuous fluorinators. The installation of equipment
for engineering studies on uranium oxide precipitation
was completed, and two experiments were carried out.
Work on the design of a processing materials test stand

and the molybdenum reductive extraction equipment

202

was continued. Studies of a salt-bismuth interface
detector for use in salt-metal contactors were also
continued. i :

17.1 LITHIUM TRANSFER DURING METAL
TRANSFER EXPERIMENT MTE-2

E.L. Youngblood  L.E.McNeese

Additional analytical results were obtained for the
concentration of lithium in the Li-Bi solution used for
extracting rare earths from lithium chloride in metal
transfer experiment MTE-2, which was completed
previously. During the experiment,! the lithium con-
centration decreased from an initial value of 0.35 to
0.18 mole fraction after about 570 liters of lithium
chloride had been contacted with the Li-Bi solution (see
Fig. 17.1). Only a small fraction of this decrease can be
accounted for by the reaction of rare earths with
lithium. The major portion of the decrease is believed
to be associated with the circulation of the lithium
chloride since little or no decrease occurred during
periods in which LiCl was not circulated. Recently, it
has been determined that the equilibrium concentra-
tions of lithium and bismuth in lithium chloride in
contact with lithium-bismuth solutions are appreciable

and that they increase markedly as the lithium concen-
tration in the metal phase is increased (see Sect. 15).

A mathematical analysis has been carried out using
the recently obtained data on the equilibrium lithium
concentration in lithium chloride in contact with Li-Bi
solutions. These data can be represented by the
relation:

(1

XLi(Licl) = 0.2278 xLi(Bi)S.s 1,

where

X1i(Liciy = concentration of lithium in lithium chlo- |
ride, mole fraction, |
Xpicpi) = concentration of lithium in lithium-
bismuth solution, mole fraction.

~ In experiment MTE-2, lithium would have been re-
moved from the lithium-bismuth solution as a result of
(1) circulation of the LiCl and (2) extraction of
materials into the lithium-bismuth solution. During the

- period of interest (which constitutes most of the
experiment), only lanthanum was present in sufficiently
high concentrations to react with an appreciable
amount of lithium. Thus a material balance on lithjum .
in the Li-Bi'solution can be written as follows:

d -
—Vpi-Li dr FLi(Bi) =fFxpiwicy Y Ria

VpiL;i = volume of the bismuth-lithium solution,

In the above relation, it has been assumed that

essentially all of the lithium was removed from the
lithium chloride by extraction into the main bismuth
pool in the experiment. Equation (1) was substituted
into Eq. (2), and the resulting equation was solved
numerically for various values of fin order to determine
the value that best represented the data. The curve

- shown in Fig. 17.1, which resulted from an f value of

0.37, is in good agreement with the measured lithium
concentration in the Li-Bi solution during the experi-
ment, and the value of fis in reasonable agreement with
the value of 0.2 reported earlier, based on the rate of

-accumulation of lanthanum and neodymium in the

Li-Bi solution. It should be observed that essentially no
transfer of lithium occurred until after about 50 liters
of lithium chloride had been ‘circulated; at. this time,
operation of a gas sparge tube in the Li-Bi container was
initiated. Similar behavior was observed in determining
the rate of accumulation of lanthanum and neodymium

in the Li-Bi solution during this period in that essen-

tially no accumulation was observed until the sparge
tube was activated. The agreement of the measured
lithium concentration with the predicted values was less
satisfactory “after a total of 400 liters of lithium
chioride had been circulated because, by this time, a

hole had developed in the Li-Bi container. This hole

caused poor contact of part of the solution with the

- lithium chloride during the remainder of the experi-
- ment. Thus the measured lithium concentrations would

be expected to be lower than the predicted values, as is

observed in Fig. 17.1.

 
 

 

 

The agreement between the predicted and observed
behavior of lithium in experiment MTE-2 provides good
confirmation of the recently measured data on the
equilibrium concentration of lithium in lithium chloride
in contact with a lithium-bismuth solutlon having a high
hthmm concentration.

. 17.2 OPERATION OF METAL TRANSFER
o 'EXPER_IIMENT MTE-2B ‘

E. L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

As discussed in the previous section, a much larger
- decrease than expected was observed in the lithium
concentiation in the bismuth into which rare earths
were extracted from the lithium chloride in metal
transfer experiment MTE-2. A new experiment, desig-
nated MTE-2B, is now under way to study further the
transfer of lithium from a lithium-bismuth solution
containing lithium at the concentration proposed for
extracting trivalent rare earths from lithium chloride
(ie.,5at. %).

bismuth are fabricated of carbon steel. The main vessel -
is constructed of 6-in.-diam sched 40 pipe and is divided
into two compartments by a partition that extends to
within % in. of the bottom of the vessel. The two
compartments are interconnected by a pool of bismuth
containing reductant. One compartment contains fluo-

ride salt (67-33 mole % LiF-BeF,) to which were added

11 mCi of 147NdF, and sufficient ThF, to produce a
concentratlon of 0.19 mole %. The other compartment
contains lithium chloride. A separate, electrically insu-
lated vessel containing a 5 at. % Li-Bi solution is
connected to the lithium chloride compartment with a
Ya-in.-diam sched 80 pipe. During operation, molten
lithium chloride is circulated between the Li-Bi vessel
and the compartmented vessel by pressurizing the Li-Bi
container with argon. Gas-lift sparge tubes are used to
improve the contact of the salt and metal phases. The
experiment is being operated at 645°C.

The quantities of materials used in the experiment are
shown in Table 17.1. These materials were purified for
removal of oxides prior to being used in the experi-
ment. The two bismuth phases were sparged with H, at -
650°C for 12 hr and were charged to the carbon-steel

vessel, which had also been contacted with hydrogen at
650°C for 12 hr. The lithium chloride was contacted
with bismuth that had been saturated with thorium at
650°C, and the fluoride salt was obtained in purified
form from the Reactor Chemistry Division.

-The experiment is designed in a manner such that
data on lithium transfer can be obtalned by the
followmg independent methods:

1. Direct determination of lithium in the Li-Bi solution
used for extraction of rare earths from the lithium
chloride.

2. Direct determination of the lithium and thorium

concentrations in LiCl in equ1hbnum with the Li-Bi
solution. :

3. Determination of the rate at which lithium is
transferred from the Li-Bi solution to the main
bismuth pool, as indicated by. changes in the
distribution ratios for thorium and '¢7?Nd. The
composition of the fluoride salt and the relative
volumes of fluoride salt and bismuth were chosen
such that the maximum thorium concentration that

- can be attained in the bismuth is only one-half the
solubility of thorium in bismuth. This will prevent
the bismuth phase from becoming saturated with
thorium, If -saturation occurs, the thorium and

neodymium distribution ratios will not be sensitive -

to transfer of ]ithium into the main bismuth pool.

4. Measurement of the voltage that is developed when
the two bismuth phases containing lithium are
connected by the lithium chloride. It was antici-
pated that the developed voltage could be interpre-
ted in terms of a concentration cell involving
bismuth phases that contain lithium at different
concentrations.

Data obtained thus far are summarized in Table 17.2.
During the first two weeks of the experiment, decreases
were observed in the concentrations of lithium in the
Li-Bi solution and in the main bismuth pool. Simulta-
neous decreases were noted in the distribution coeffi-
cients for thorium and neodymium, whereas an increase
was noted in the emf measured between the two
bismuth phases. We believe the decreases in the lithium
concentrations resulted from reacticn of lithium with
impurities in the system. Two weeks after the beginning
of the experiment, 8.5 g of thorium was added to the
Th-Bi solution in order to increase the concentration of
reductant to the desired value. At this time, the
measured emf between the two bismuth phases de-
creased to near the expected value of about 250 mV,
and the distribution values for thorium and neodymium
increased to "about the expected values. During the
subsequent operating period, the lithium concentration
in the Li-Bi solution decreased slightly (from 4.40 to
4.0 mole %), as shown in Fig. 17.3. During this period,
the émf measured between the two bismuth phases
increased steadily from about 250 to about 276 mV.
Calculated values for the lithium concentration in the
Th-Bi solution, based on the measured emf values and
the concentration of lithium in the Li-Bi solution, are
observed to be in reasonable agreement with lithium
concentrations determined by analysis. Data on the
variations of the thorium and neodymium distribution
ratios during the experiment are shown in Fig. 17.4.
Calculated results based on emf measurements and on
lithium analyses -of the Th-Bi solution are shown for
comparison with experimentally determined values.
Although the scatter in the experimental data is
appreciable, the values appear to lie closer to the results
that are based on emf measurements than to those
based on lithium analyses. '

Several conclusions can be drawn from these data.
The observed decrease in the lithium concentration in
the Li-Bi solution represents an equilibrium lithium
concentration in the LiCl of less than 0.3 wt ppm;
however, transfer of this amount of lithium from the
Li-Bi solution to the Th-Bi solution would have
increased the concentration of reductant in the Th-Bi
solution by about 10% and would have also increased
the neodymium and thorium distribution ratios by

about 33 and 46% respectively. In addition, a decrease

in measured emf of about 5% would have been
observed. The data appear to be consistent with a slight
loss of reductant from both the Li-Bi and the Th-Bi

~solutions by reaction with 1mpur1t1es in the system. It is

believed that further operation of the experiment will

17.3 DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY
AGITATED SALT-METAL CONTACTORS

H.O.Weeren  L.E.McNeese

Mechanically agitated salt-metal contactors are being
developed as an alternative to packed columns for
MSBR processing systems. This type of contactor is of

-particular interest for use in the metal transfer process
since designs can be envisioned in which the bismuth in
the contactor would be a near-isothermal, internally
circulated captive phase. It is believed that contactors
" of this design may be easier to fabricate than packed
column - contactors. The proposed contactor, shown
schematically in Fig. 17.5, consists of a vessel that is
divided ‘into two compartments by a central partition
that does not extend to the bottom of the vessel. A seal
‘between the two compartments is provided by a pool of
bismuth that. will contain reductant. In operation, fuel
carrier salt containing rare earths will flow through one

erable distance away from the interface, and the phases
will be agitated as vigorously as possible without
actually causing dispersion of one phase in the other. -

the agitator speed is entrainment of water in the
mercury circulating between the two halves of the
contactor. Entrainment of water was found to begin at
a definite agitator speed; below the limiting speed, no
entrainment was observed. The limiting agitator speed
was found to be relatively independent of the size and

shape of the contactor vessel but was strongly depend-
ent on agitator diameter, as shown in Fig. 17.6.
Consideration of these data, along with data from the
literature,2 on mass transfer coefficients in this type of
contactor suggest that optimum mass transfer perform-
ance will be obtained by use of the largest possible
agitator diameter. This will also result in the lowest

possible agitator speed, which should facilitate main-

taining a gas-tight seal on the agitator shaft. -

- It was found that the distance between the lower edge
of the partition and the bottom of the contactor vessel
could be increased from ¥, to ¥ in. without appreci-
ably affecting the limiting agitator speed. However, the
limiting agitator speed was reduced as the separation
distance was increased above ¥ in. Considerably higher
limiting agitator speeds could be obtained when the
agitator blades were canted at a 45° angle instead of
being vertical and the direction of rotation was such
that the agitator lifted the mercury phase toward the

 

2. 1. B. Lewis, Chem. Eng. Sci. 3,248-59 (1954),

mercury-watei interface. It is believed that the entrain-
ment of water in the mercury phase results from flow
of water down the agitator shaft to a point below the

water-mercury interface, where it is then dispersed into

the mercury phase. The limiting agitator speed with
canted blades was decreased significantly when the
contactor contained baffles or other items such as
thermowells or sampling tubes. In all cases, however, a
higher limiting agitator speed was obtained with canted
blades than with vertical ones.

A test was also carried out to observe the effect on °

contactor performance of the difference in densities of
the two phases. The test was made in a heated
contactor with Cerrolow-105 (42.9-21.7-18.3-8.0-5.0-
4.0 wt % Bi-Pb-In-Sn-Cd-Hg) and water. The metal
phase has a density of 8.1 glem® and a liquidus

_temperature of about 38°C. At the operating tempera-
ture of 60°C, the limiting agitator speed was nearly’

identical to that obtained with mercury and water in

the same contactor. Thus, it appears that the perform- -

ance of the contactor will not depend.significantly
upon the difference in the densities of molten salt and
bismuth.

The rate at which mercury circulated between the
two halves of a 10-in.-diam contactor having a 3-in-

diam agitator was determined by measuring the rate of
return of the liquids to a common temperature on
resumption of mercury flow after one side of the cell
had been chilled and the other side of the cell had been
heated. The mercury flow rate was found to be about
15 liters/min and depended, to some extent, on
propeller configuration. A bismuth circulation rate of
0.5 liter/min or greater is desired in the contactor for
metal transfer experiment MTE-3, which uses a 10-in.-
diam contactor. Thus, it appears that circulation of the
bismuth phase will be more than adequate.

The design of the third engineering experiment
MTE-3 for development of the metal transfer process
for removing rare earths from MSBR fuel carrier salt has
been completed. Most of the equipment has been
fabricated, and the main process vessels are now being
installed. This experiment will use salt flow rates that
are 1% of the estimated flow rates required for
processing a 1000-MW(e) reactor. The planned experi-
ment and equipment have been described previously.3

The three carbon steel vessels required for the
experiment are shown in Fig. 17.7. The fluoride salt
reservoir is on the left, the compartmented salt-metal
contactor is in the center, and the rare-earth stripper
vessel is on the right. The fluoride salt pump, which has
been fabricated, will be inserted in the large flange on
the fluoride salt reservoir. Both the pump discharge line
to the salt-metal contactor and the return stream from
the contactor pass through the upper horizontal 3-in.-
diam pipe between the two vessels. The lower pipe is a
structural member. The agitators for promoting contact

- of the salt and bismuth will be mounted on the two

flanged nozzles on the salt-metal contactor vessel (only
one nozzle can be seen in this view) and on the vertical
flanged nozzle on the rare-earth stripper. The lithium
chloride will be pumped back and forth between the
salt-metal contactor and the rare-earth stripper vessel by
varying the gas pressure in the stripper vessel. Figure
17.8 shows a detailed view of the top of the rare-earth
stripper vessel with the agitator shaft seal housing and
shaft cooler installed in the agitator nozzle. The vessel is

electrically insulated from the other equipment to
minimize the rate of transfer of lithium between the
two bismuth pools (which have different lithium
concentrations) in the experiment. The LiCl transfer
line is constructed of ¥%-in. sched 80 pipe and is
insulated from the rare-earth stripper vessel by the
water-cooled, Teflon-gasketed flange assembly shown
on the right side of the figure. The portion of the
carbon-steel pipe located adjacent to the cooled flanges
is heated by a nickeljacketed copper sleeve on which a
Calrod heater will be mounted. The method used for
mounting the heater will facilitate replacement of the
heater in the event that this becomes necessary. The
heater will be wound in the grooves in the enlarged
threaded part of the nickel-clad copper sleeve. This
figure also shows the flame-sprayed, oxidation-resistant

nickel aluminide coating that was applied to the
carbon-steel parts of the vessel. ‘

We are still testing the agitator drive unit and the
nonlubricated shaft seal assembly, which is water-
cooled and buffered with inert gas. The assembly
contains two standard graphite-impregnated Teflon
Bal-Seals (product of Bal-Seal Engineering Co.). Figure
17.9 shows the test equipment prior to completion of
the piping and installation of the electrical heaters and
thermal insulation. Two seals were tested initially for
820 hr at shaft speeds of 150 to 750 rpm while salt and
bismuth were agitated at 650°C in the 3-in.-diam test
vessel. The seals were buffered with argon at 16 psig.
After an initial run-in period, the seal leak rate was
about 8.6 cm® of gas per hour. After 700 hr of

operation, the leak rate increased rapidly up to the time

the test was terminated. Gas leakage was principally to
the outside rather than into the vessel. On completion
of the test, examination of the upper seal ring showed
signs of excessive wear.. Therefore, both seals were
replaced with a new flange-mounting type of seal that
had light-duty seal expander springs and a thicker cross

section. The seal holder was also modified to facilitate -

self-centering of the seals on the shaft. Subsequent tests

were made at room temperature, since the previous-

tests showed that the shaft and seal cooling system
maintained the critical parts at room temperature with
salt and bismuth in the vessel at 650°C. After prelimi-
nary testing, the seals were replaced with ones having
medium-duty expander springs. These seals have been
operated for 200 hr at 125 rpm to date; the seal leak
_rate is only 0.13 cm?/hr, which is quite satisfactory.

The vapor-deposited tungsten coating on the interior of
the test vessel and the sprayed stainless steel undercoat .
beneath the nickel aluminide protective coat on the.

outside will be evaluated after tests of the seal are
completed. No evidence of stable emulsions of bismuth
- in salt was found in the first test.

17.5 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

ENGINEERING STUDIES '
B. A. Hannaford W.M. Woods
- D.D. Sood L. E. McNeese

We-have begun mass transfer experiments in which

the rate of transfer of zirconium from molten salt to

bismuth is measured by adding °?ZrQ, tracer to the
salt phase prior to contacting the salt with bismuth
containing reductant in a packed column. Three of the
experiments (ZTR-2, -3, and -5) resulted in the transfer
of 15 to 30% of the ®7Zr present in the salt and gave
measured HTU values that ranged from 4 to 1 ft. Other
experiments (ZTR-1, -4, and -6) were carried out under
conditions where no transfer of tracer between phases
was expected to occur.

Preparation for mass transfer expenments using ° " Zr
tracer. The new salt feed tank and newly installed lines
were treated with hydrogen for 13 hr at 600°C to
reduce surface oxides in preparation for the ®7Zr tracer
experiments. Thorium reductant was added to the
bismuth in the treatment vessel, and about 18 liters of
salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF4) was charged to

the treatment vessel to replace salt that was removed-
when the original salt tank was replaced. The salt and

bismuth were equilibrated for 20 hr and were then fed
through the system to complete the removal of surface

oxides not reduced by the earlier hydrogen treatment. -

The measured pressure drop across the column when
only salt was flowing (~70. ml/min) was about 2 in.
H, O, which is the same value that was measured soon
after the column was installed. Thus the column

~ characteristics apparently have not changed as a result

of runs made to date.
A small amount of Zircaloy-2 (5.3 g) was dissolved in

the bismuth to bring the zirconium inventory in the

system to about 10g. The steel draft tube in the
treatment vessel was replaced with a molybdenum tube
of similar dimensions in preparation for H,-HF treat-
ment of the bismuth and salt. Following a 20-hr

. treatment with 30% HF in H,, the bismuth and salt

were. sparged with argon for 20 hr. A 48g charge of
thorium metal was suspended in a perforated steel

basket in the bismuth phase in the treatment vessel in-

order to add reductant to the bismuth. After 25 g of

thorium had dissolved, a 240-g batch of 1 g5 wt %
- lithium-bismuth was added to the vessel in order to

make a rapid; final adjustment of the reductant

~inventory to an expected value of about 1 g-equiv.
Following a 22-hr equilibration period, the salt and

about one-half of the bismuth were transferred to the
feed tanks. Transfer of all of the bismuth was prevented
by a leak in the transfer line at the weld joining the
molybdenum tube to the mild-steel tube m51de the
treatment vessel.

A 6.7-mg quantity of *®ZrO, ‘that had been irradi-
ated for 12 hr (to produce about 8 mCi of ??Zr) was
transferred to a steel capsule to facilitate its addition to
the salt phase. Analyses of samples taken periodically
from the salt feed tank: after the capsule had been
immersed in the salt indicated that the tracer was
completely distributed throughout the salt after 2 hr.

Mass transfer runs using ®7?Zr tracer. When the °*7Zr
activity in the seven sets of samples taken dunng
experiment ZTR-1 was counted, it became obvious that
no measurable transfer of ®7Zr tracer had occurred.
The lack of transfer was due to an unexpectedly low
distribution coefficient for zirconium; postrun samples
from the treatment vessel showed that D, was only
0.023 instead of the expected value of 1.0.

- An additional 1 g-equiv of lithium, in the form of
lithium-bismyth alloy, was added to the treatment
vessel in preparation for experiment ZTR-2. Following
a 105-hr equilibration period, a new charge of *7Zr
tracer (about 10 mCi) was added to the treatment
vessel. Bismuth and salt samples taken at various times
showed that, when the tracer addition capsule was
removed (after being immersed for 80 min in the salt),
the concentration of tracer in each phase was within

about 90% of the equilibrium tracer concentration that

"

o
 

 

 

 

was observed after a 32-hr period. The equilibrium
distribution coefficient for zirconium, determined by
?7Zr counting, was 0.32. Since the addition of reduc-
tant should have produced a D, of about 5, it is
believed that reductant was consumed by side reactions
with materials such as HF, FeF,, or air (a contaminant
in the argon cover gas). The same explanation would
account for very low D, observed in ZTR-1. Subse-
quent samples demonstrated that some loss of reduc-
tant continued to occur as the mass transfer experi-
ments were performed.

The results of the three experiments that yielded mass
transfer data are summarized in Table 17.3. The
calculated HTU value is quite dependent on the
zirconium distribution ratio (D,,) and the ?7Zr con-
centration in the bismuth leaving the column. Since the
quality of the data improved from run to run, the
calculated HTU values are not directly comparable.

Samples of bismuth exiting from the column during
the second -°7Zr tracer experiment, ZTR-2, indicated
that about 30% of the tracer had transferred to the salt;
however, analyses of salt samples indicated that only
"~ 15% of the tracer had transferred. The postrun zirco-
nium distribution ratio (determined from the °*7Zr
activity) was found to be 0.034. This is in excellent
agreement with the value of 0.038 + 0.020, which was
calculated from postrun uranium distribution data.
Since the observed ®7Zr transfer could not have
occurred with such a low zirconium distribution coef-
ficient, it is apparent that some loss of reductant must
have occurred between the packed column and the
bismuth and salt receivers.

In order to increase. Dz before the next experiment,

Li-Bi alloy containing 0.38 g-equiv of lithium was added
to the treatment vessel; the addition of ®7Zr tracer
‘indicated a Dy, of 0.25. An additional 0.75 g-equiv of

213

lithium was then added to the treatment vessel, thereby

increasing the D, _ to 1.90. Since each of the additions

of reductant produced an effect corresponding to only
about two-thirds the amount of Li-Bi alloy added, it is
possible that the lithium in the alloy was partially
oxidized before it was added to the treatment vessel.
After the ®7Zr tracer that was used to monitor the
adjustment of D,_ had decayed, additional ®7Zr tracer
was added to the salt feed tank in preparation for
experiment ZTR-3. About midway of the experiment,
the presence of a frozen-salt plug in the flowing salt
sampler caused a brief interruption since it halted the
sampling operation (Fig. 17.10). With the exception of
samples that reflected the effect of this interruption,
the scatter in ®?Zr counting results was satisfactorily
low. The fraction of tracer transferred from the salt was

© 0.30 and the calculated HTU was 2 ft, based on a D,

of 1.9. The postrun zirconium distribution coefficient,
measured after a 2-hr equilibration of the salt and
bismuth in the treatment vessel, was 0.77.

~In order to remove suspected oxidants from the
system, the bismuth and the salt were countercurrently
contacted in the column about 20 hr prior to experi-
ment ZTR-5. Tracer was then added to the salt feed
tank, and run ZTR-5 was carried out with each phase
having a nominal flow rate of 150 ml/min. Counting
results for five of seven bismuth samples (Fig. 17.11)
were within 7% of their average. However, the
counting rates for the two remaining samples were 2
and 170 times the average of the other samples.
Following a 3-hr equilibration period in the treatment
vessel, both phases were returned to the feed tanks, and
run ZTR-6 was carried out. Counting results for salt
samples were comparable with results obtained during
run ZTR-5. However, the tracer concentrations in
bismuth samples were generally a factor of 2 to 3 times

lugher than in the previous experiment. Suspected
contamination of the bismuth samples with salt was
ruled out by visual inspection of several of the samples.
A review of the sampling procedure indicated that small
amounts of air might possibly be entering the flowing

stream samplers. Such a ‘contaminant could have re-
sulted in the accumulation of ®7Zr, as ®7Zr0,, at the
bismuth surface in the sampler; subsequently, some of
this material might have been drawn into the sample
capsule since the samples were taken from near .the
bismuth surface. |

We are presently replacing several bismuth and salt
transfer lines in which leaks have occurred. We are
preparing for additional ®7Zr tracer mass transfer
experiments that will use an improved techmque for

17.6 DEVELOPMENT OF A FROZEN-WALL
FLUORINATOR: INDUCTION HEATING
EXPERIMENTS '

LR 'Hi‘ghtower, Jr.

An experiment to demonstrate protection against
corrosion in a continuous fluorinator by use of a frozen
wall will use high-frequency induction heating to serve
as a heat source in the molten salt. Heat generation
rates were measured with four induction coil designs in
a system that used 31 wt % HNO; as a substitute for
molten salt. With these measured heat generation rates,
correction . factors could be 'computed for use in
equations for calculating the amount of heat that is
induced in similar, but idealized, geometries. The
equations were then used to design equipment for a
molten-salt induction heating experiment for testing (1)
the operation of the proposed heating system and (2)
the means by which power leads are introduced into the
fluorinator. The results of measurements with the nitric
acid system and the design of equipment for the
molten-salt induction heating test are summanzed in
the remainder of this section.

Results of experiments with a simulated 'fluorinator.
The equipment for measuring heat generation rates in a
system - that uses 31 wt % HNO; as a substitute for
molten salt has been described previously.? Twenty-
nine runs were made to determine heat generation rates
in the acid, in the pipe surrounding the acid, and in
each of four induction coils. The length of each
induction coil assembly was 5 ft, and each coil assembly
was made -of a number of smaller coil sections con-
nected electrically in parallel. Each small section had an
inside diameter of 5.6 in. The characteristics for each of
the coil assemblies are given in Table 17.4.

%The dimensions of K, are defined by Eq. (3).

The values for all constants for coil II are smaller than
the corresponding constants for the other coils. This is
apparently the result of winding all of the small coil
sections in the same direction, since other character-
istics are similar to those of coils I, III, and IV. Coil II
requires the largest current to produce the required heat
generation rate in the molten salt but might have a high
efficiency for heating the salt if the molten dJameter is
sufficiently large.

The value for k, was largest for coil IV, This is
probably due to the difference in spacing between the
small coil sections. Coil IV had 4-in.-long small coil
sections with 11% turns per section, and the coil
sections were separated by a space of 2 in. The smaller
sections in the other coils were placed close together so
that the coil turns were spaced evenly over the length of
the acid column; the total number of turns was about
the same for each coil. In the case of coils I and II, this
closer spacing compressed the magnetic field between

each of the small coil sections, thereby effecting a

nickel tubing (using a coil IV design in which each small
section has 9% tumns over a 3%-in. length, with a
2Y,-in. space between small sections), and a 6% ¢-in.-ID
nickel fluorinator vessel, an efficiency of heating the
salt (with no bubbles) of about 49% would be achieved
with a total current of less than 140 A. With coil III,
the efficiency of heating the salt would be about 58%,
but a coil current of 267 A would be required.
Molten-salt induction heating test. The experimental

results obtained with the simulated fluorinator indicate

that sufficient heat can be produced in the molten salt
by induction heating. However, before a fluorinator
experimeni is designed, a number of factors require
further study. These include: (1) verifying the predicted
coil performance; (2) demonstrating a means for intro-
ducing the rf power leads into the fluorinator vessel,
and (3) checking the general operability of a system
that contains molten salt. Equipment has been designed
and installed for inductively heating molten salt in 2
vessel similar in design to that expected for the

proposed frozen-wall fluorinator, is ‘a 5-ftdong by
6% 6-in.-ID nickel column having two conduits for the
induction coil electrical leads that extend along the
vessel wall from the top to within 1 ft of the bottom of

‘the vessel. The conduits are made from 14n. sched 40

nickel pipe. The gas inlet nozzle near the bottom of the
column is made from 2% -in. sched 40 nickel pipe and
enters at a 45° angle to the axis of the test vessel. The
test section in which the frozen-salt layer will be
formed is 3 ft long and begins 1 ft from the bottom of
the vessel. Figure 17.12 shows the installed vessel with
Calrod heaters and thermocouples in place. The induc-
tion coil to be used for this test is of a design similar to
coil IV. The coil, shown in Fig. 17.13, consists of six

~ small coil sections connected electrically in parallel to
leads that are made of %-in. nickel tubing. Each small

section is 3% in. long and 5% in. ID and consists of
9%, turns of Y,-in. nickel tubing. Adjacent coil sections
are wound in opposite directions and are separated by a

distance of 2%, in. The leads to the small coil sections

fit into the conduits on the vessel wall and allow the

- 17.7 PREDICTED PERFORMANCE
OF CONTINUOUS FLUORINATORS

" 1. S. Watson L.- E. McNeese

~ Thus far, most of the flowsheets considered for use in
processing molten-salt reactor fuel salt require fluorina-

~ tion of molten salt for removal of uranium at one or
‘more points in thé flowsheet. These include: (1) re-

moval of trace quantities of uranium from relatively
small salt streams prior to discard, (2)removal of
uranium from a captive salt volume in which 233Pa is
accumulated and held for decay to 233U, (3) removal
of most of the uranium from relatively large fuel salt
streams prior to isolation of protactinium and removal
of rare earths, and (4) nearly quantitative removal of
uranium from a salt stream containing 233Pa in order
to produce isotopically pure 233U. Not all of these
operations would require continuous fluorinators. In
fact, the use of batch fluorinators has definite advan-
tages in certain cases. However, as the quantities of salt
and uranium to be handled increase, the use of
continuous fluorinators becomes mandatory in order to
avoid undesirably large inventory charges on uranium
and molten salt, as well as the detrimental increase in
reactor doubling time that is associated with an
increased fissile inventory.

Although the literature contains many references to
the removal of uranium from molten salt by batch
fluorination, information on continuous fluorinators,
particularly on fluorinators capable of handling salt
flow rates on the order of 100 ft?/day, is rather meager.
A mathematical analysis for -predicting continuous
fluorinator performance was completed, and calcula-
tions were made for fluorinator operating conditions of
interest for MSBR processing. _
- Mathematical analysis of open-column continuous
fluorinators. Consider a differential height-of a con-
tinuous fluorinator in which fluorine and molten salt
containing uranium are in countercurrent flow. If the
rate of removal of uranium from the salt is assumed to
be first order with respect to the uranium concentration
in the salt, a material balance on the differential salt
volume yields the relation:

The terms in Eq. (1) represent the transfer of uranium
in the salt by axial diffusion, the transfer of uranium in
the salt by convection, and the removal of uranium
from the salt by reaction with fluorine respectively. The
assumption of a first-order reaction does not imply a

‘particular rate-limiting reaction mechanism; however, it

is consistent with the assumption that the rate-limiting

step is diffusion of uranium in the salt to the gasliquid

interface. In this case, the first-order expression would

. imply that the concentration in the salt at the interface

is negligible in comparison with the uranium concen-
tration in the salt at points a short distance from the

_interface.

Application of Eq. (4) to the design and evaluation of
continuous fluorinators requires information on the
rate constant k and the axial dispersion coefficient D.
Values of the dispersion coefficient were obtained from
correlations resulting from studies in which air and
aqueous solutions were contacted countercurrently in
open bubble columns, as indicated below. A value for
the rate constant was calculated using data obtained

- previously during a study of the performance of a

l-in.-diam continuous fluorinator.

Dispersion coefficient values. Studies in which air and
aqueous solutions were contacted countercurrently in
open bubble columns having diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
and 6 in. were carried out previously. The viscosity of
the aqueous solutions was varied between 1 and 15 cP
by the use of water-glycerol mixtures. The viscosity of
molten salt under conditions of - interest is about 15 cP,
The effect of the surface tension of the aqueous phase
was determined by varying the surface tension from 68
to 27 dynes/cm, using water-isopropanol mixtures. The
surface tension of molten salt is much higher than these
values;, however, the data allow estimates of the effect
of surface tension on the dispersion coefficient. Data
from these studies were correlated® by use of dimen-
sionless groups in the following manner: for low gas
flow rates (bubbly ﬂow)

Evaluation of fluonnation reaction rate constant. The
fluorination reaction rate constant was evaluated from

Eq. (4) using previously obtained data on the perform-

ance of a l-in.-diam open-column continuous fluori-
nator® and the axial dispersion coefficient data dis-
cussed above. The ﬂuormator performance data were
obtained in studies with two different uranium concen-

~ trations in the salt feed (0.35 and 0.13 mole %) at
~ 600°C and one uranium concentration (0.35 mole %) at

525°C. Three data points corresponding to different

~salt flow rates were obtained for each set of tempera-

tures and inlet compositions. The fluorine flow rate was

different for each data point; however, according to Eq.

(1), which defines the present model, the fluorine flow
rate only affects the results by changing the axial
dispersion coefficient. The data obtained at 525°C were
used to evaluate the rate constant X, since the operating
temperature of the proposed frozen-wall fluorinators

~will be 10 to 15°C above the salt liquidus temperature

of 505°C. Application of Eq. (4) to the three data
points obtained at 525°C produced the results shown in
Table 17.6. The scatter in the calculated values for & is
acceptably small, and no trend with salt or fluorine

flow rates is observed. Although these data do not

confirm the validity of the model, they do not
contradict it. '
Predicted performance of open-column continuous
fluorinators. The performance of large, open-column
continuous fluorinators was estimated from Eq. @
using the previously discussed estimates of the reaction
rate constant k and the axial dispersion coefficient D.
The required fluorinator height is shown in Figs. 17.14
and 17.15 for a range of salt flow rates for two
fractional uranium removal values (0.95 and 0.99). The
uranium concentration in the inlet salt was assumed to
be 0.0033 mole fraction in all cases, and the fluorine
flow rate was assumed to be equal to 1.5 times the
stoichiometric requirement. These results are encourag-

- ing since they suggest that single fluorination vessels of
moderate size will suffice for removing uranium from

MSBR fuel salt prior to the isolation of protactinium
by reductive extraction. The reference flowsheet for
isolating protactinium by fluorination—reductive ex-
traction requires fluorination of fuel salt at the rate of
170 ft?/day, which is equivalent to a ten-day processing
cycle. A 6-in.-diam fluorinator having a height of 10.2
ft will be required for a uranium removal efficiency of
95%, and an 8-in.-diam fluorinator having a height of
17.8 ft will be required for a uranium removal
efficiency of 99%. '

17.8 ENGINEERING STUDIES -
- OF URANIUM OXIDE PRECIPITATION -

M.J.Bell D.D.Sood
L. E. McNeese '

The fabrication and installation of equipment” for a
single-stage experiment to study the precipitation of
UO,-ThO, solid solutions from molten fluoride salts
have been completed. In the two experiments carried

out thus far, the major equipment items operated:

satisfactorily. Several minor difficulties that were en-
countered, including the freezing of salt and the
condensation of water in several lines in the system,
have been alleviated. A third experiment is in progress.

In the first experiment (OP-1), a gas stream con-

taining 15% water—85% argon was fed to the precipita-

tor vessel at the rate of 0.5 scfh for a period of 4 hr
with the salt at 600°C. The gas flow was interrupted
periodically during the run, and filtered salt samples
were obtained. The precipitate and the salt were
allowed-to equilibrate for 64 hr, after which a sample of
the oxide phase was obtained for analysis by x-ray
diffraction. The salt was then slowly transferred from
the precipitator vessel to the treatment vessel in order
to leave most of the precipitate in the precipitator.
Subsequently, the salt was hydrofluorinated. in the
treatment vessel and sampled again in order to deter-
mine the amount of precipitated uranium that had
transferred to the treatment vessel. Finally, the salt was
returned to the precipitator vessel, where it was
hydrofluorinated for 12 hr using a 20% HF—80% H,
gas mixture at the rate of 3 scfh in order to redissolve

Analysis of samples taken during the prec1p1tat10n
phase of the experiment indicated that 17% of the

uranium . initially present in the salt was precipitated
during the run. However, the analyses show consider-
able scatter, and the uranium concentration in the salt
does not decrease monotonically with time. The analy-
ses indicate a water utilization of about 25%, although
there is some uncertainty in this value because of
problems encountered with the condensation of water
in gas lines during the experiment. Analysis of the oxide
phase collected at the end of the precipitation period
revealed that a UQ,-ThO, solid solution having a UO,
concentration of 0.94 mole fraction was formed, and
that 5 to 15% of the precipitate was ThO,. The
concentration of BeQ in the precipitate was below the
limit of detection (< 1 wt %). The presence of ThO,
and the fact that the uranium content of the solid
solution was slightly lower than the value expected at
equilibrium (0.96 mole fraction UO;) indicate that
equilibrium between the salt and the precipitate was
not obtained. The uranium concentration in the de-
canted salt after hydrofluorination was found to be the
same as that obtained for the filtered »alt sample taken
after the precipitate had been allowed to settle for 64
hr. This indicates that it may be possible to separate the
precipitate from the salt W1th relatively sunple equip-
ment. :

" In the second experiment (0P-2) the salt temperature
was again held at 600°C, and the composition of the
inlet gas mixture was 15% water—85% argon, as before.
In this experiment, the salt was first contacted with the
gas mixture at a rate of 0.5 scth for 9 hr; then the gas
flow rate was increased to 1.5 scth for an additional
5-hr period. The total precipitation time (14 hr)
extended over a period of about ten days, during which
the run was interrupted several times in order to modify
gas lines and add heaters and thermal insulation to a

number of lines where condensation of water was

suspected. The uranium concentration observed in
filtered salt samples obtained during the run and the
expected uranium concentration based on the amount

of HF evolved during the run are shown in Fig. 17.16.
" The discontinuity in the curve based on HF evolution at

6.7 hr resulted from the fact that condensate was
observed in an off-gas line between periods of precipita-
tion. The condensate was collected and titrated; then
the resulting correction was made. Additional heaters
were placed on this line, as well as other lines, before
the precipitation phase of the experiment was con-
tinued. The greater rate of HF evolution observed after
these changes had been made suggests that the conden-
sation problem has been eliminated.

17.9 DESICN OF A PROCESSING MATERIALS
TEST STAND AND THE MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EQUIPMENT

E. L. Nicholson = W. F. Schaffer, Jr.
J. Roth

- A report describing the conceptual design and fabrica-

tion development program for the molybdenum reduc-
tive extraction equipment test stand was completed.
The conceptual design for the system has been de-
scribed previously;*!? fabrication development details
are reported in Sects. 14.1—14.4. -

The detailed designs of the extraction column and the

salt and bismuth head pots have been completed, and

fabrication has begun. Conceptual design sketches for
the equipment supports in the containment vessel,
machined . tees, and the freeze valve have been com-

pleted. Preliminary drawings for the molybdenum
piping arrangement inside the containment vessel have
also been completed; however, further work on these
drawings will be deferred until the piping can be
analyzed for thermal expansion stresses and a full-size
mockup of the system can be completed to investigate
fabrication and field assembly problems. The overall
height of the molybdenum components of the loop
(from the underside of the containment vessel flange to
the lowest point) is about 17 ft. Both the salt and the
bismuth gas-lift pumps are designed to operate with a
minimum submergence of 50%, which should provide
the maximum flow rate desired for elther phase (1.1
liters/min).

Final tests were completed with the revised demgn of
the full-scale transparent plastic mockup of the bismuth
head pot and the top portion of the extraction column.
Mercury ‘and *water were used to simulate molten
bismuth and salt. Problems with internal flow restric-
tions and gas venting noted previously were solved by
the revised design. Entrainment of liquid in the exit gas
was reduced to very low levels by routing the gas
through a settling chamber and Raschig-ring packing in
the top of the head pot.

The design of the probe for determining the position
of the salt-bismuth interface in the disengagement
section below the extraction column was completed,
and a prototype probe has been built for testing. Work
associated with the development of liquid-level probes
is discussed in the following section.

secondary coils are wound. Contact of the coils with
molten salt or bismuth is prevented by enclosing the
coils in a molybdenum tube. In operation, a high-
frequency alternating current is passed through the
primary coil and it induces a current in the secondary
coil. The induced current is dependent on the conduc-
tivities of the materials located adjacent to the primary
and secondary coils; since the conductivities of salt and
bismuth are quite different, the induced current reflects
the presence or absence of bismuth.. The principal
problem associated with this type of detector stems
from the low permeability of molybdenum, the fabrica-
tion material of the protective sheath. Two approaches
for obtaining an output from the detector are being
pursued. The first is based on measuring changes in the
magnitude of the induced current; the second is based
on measuring the phase shift that occurs between the

voltage imposed on the primary coil and that thch is
induced in the secondary coil.

Initial tests in which measurements were made of
variations in the induced current caused by changes in
the bismuth interface position showed that the probe
was quite sensitive to drift in the electronic circuit, to
minor variations in line voltage, and to changes in the

~ temperature of the electronic components. To circum-

vent this problem, an improved electronic circuit, which
is relatively insensitive to amplifier drift and to changes
in the temperature of the electronic components, was

~ devised. Difficulties caused by line voltage variations

were ‘avoided by use of a constant-voltage power

supply. A full-scale response of about 1.5 mV was

obtained at the optimum frequency for the primary coil
(35 kHz) for a 9-in. change in the bismuth interface

position at 600°C.

During this reporting penod calculations were made
for predicting the performance of interface detectors.
These calculations were based on either measurements
of the magnitude of the induced current or the shift in

phase between the primary and the secondary voltages. - |

Optimum operating conditions were defined, and a

prototype probe for use in the molybdenum reductive |
extraction column was fabricated. Tests for confirming
the predicted performance of the probe were carried .

out at room temperature. Equipment for final testing of
the probe at 600°C with molten bismuth has been
installed. Details of this work are discussed in the
remainder of this section.

Calculations for determining probe performance and

optimum operating conditions. Preliminary calculations
- were performed using a two-conductor model consisting
of a bifilar coil inside a molybdenum tube that was .

surrounded with either liquid bismuth or air. Results of

these calculations revealed the manner in which the
magnitude of the signal in the secondary coil and the
difference in phase between the signals in the primary
and secondary coils varied as tube size, tube wall
thickness, and frequency of the signal impressed on the
primary coil were changed. The results indicated that an
adequate phase shift (a change of approximately 11°
from the condition in which no bismuth was present to
the condition in which the tube was submerged in
bismuth) should be obtained with a molybdenum tube
having an outside diameter of 0.785 in. and a wall
thickness of 0.030 in. Additional calculations were then
carried ‘out with a three-conductor model, which
allowed consideration of the effect of the container in
which the bismuth and the probe are located. It was
determined that the phase shift technique would have
about the same sensitivity at any frequency in the range
of 20 to 34 kHz. The maximum change in magnitude of
the voltage induced in the secondary coil was about
30% as the submergence in bismuth increased from 0 to
100%; the optimum operating frequency was 8 to 12
kHz. _ _

After we had determined the conditions under which
maximum sensitivity could be achieved for the two
measurement techniques, additional calculations were
made to find the conditions that would minimize the
change in probe output resulting from a variation in
probe temperature from 600 to 700°C. The following
effects were considered:

1. The calculated thermal expansion of the molyb-
denum tube is approximately 0.05%; the phase shift
due to this effect was calculated to be less than
0.01°, which is considered negligible.

2. The resistivity of the bismuth increases from 145.7
Q-cm to 151.3 Q-cm, and the resistivity of the
molybdenum increases from 17.7 £2-cm to 21 Q-cm.
While these changes produced a significant phase
shift over most of the frequency range, it was found
that a minimum change of about 0.1° occurred at
25.2 kHz when no bismuth was present and at 30.2
kHz when the probe was completely submerged in
bismuth. On this basis, it was decided that the probe

‘would be ‘least sensitive to these effects at a
frequency of 27.7 kHz with the salt-bismuth inter-
face at the midpoint of the detector.

3. The dc fesistance of the primary and secondary coils

increases from 69.4 to 79.2 Q in the temperature
interval considered; however, by matching the im-
pedance of the primary and secondary circuit with

 
 

 

 

the cable capacitance, it was possible to essentially
eliminate this effect: (a ‘phase shift of less than
0.001°).

4, P_hase shift changes of less than 0.01° were calcu-
lated for changes of 1% in the operating frequency,
the amplitude of the signal impressed on the primary

224

coil, the output impedance of the primary signal, the

input impedance of the secondary signal, or the
cable capacnance '

wound in 0.022-in.-wide grooves having a depth of

primary and secondary coils contain about 189 turns
each. The probe was designed for insertion in a
0.785-in.-OD, 0.725-in.-ID molybdenum tube on which
a molybdenum end cap was welded by an electron
beam technique (see Fig. 17.17). The lower end of the
probe is fitted with an adapter that fastens the probe to

diameter of 4 in. were stacked on the probe to simulate
increases in the bismuth level. Difficulties were en-
countered initially with use of the cable proposed for
the molybdenum reductive extraction facility because
of shorting that occurred when the cable was flexed
slightly. Therefore, a cable consisting of two single-
conductor shielded wires was used as a substitute, and
phase shift measurements were carried out at fre-
quencies of 10 and 20 kHz. The measured results at 10
kHz were linear and reproducible to within 0.01°. The
sensitivity ‘'was 0.6°/in. of Inconel level, which is in
satisfactory agreement with the calculated value of
0.53°/in. The sensitivity at 20 kHz was considerably
less (0.3°/in) than at 10 kHz due to the high
conductivity of molybdenum at room temperature. The
results obtained with a frequency of 20 kHz were as
reproducible as those at 10 kHz but were not quite as
linear. Surrounding the probe with a 2.5-in. sched 40
ferromagnetic steel pipe caused a decrease in sensitivity
of 0.02°/in. at 10 kHz and room temperature, although
a somewhat greater loss in sensitivity would be observed
at 650°C. The random noise in the measurements at
both 10 and 20 kHz was 20.015° due to the wide
frequency response of both the driving and the re-
ceiving amplifiers. This noise can be easily eliminated
by limiting the bandpass of either amplifier.

Carbon-steel probe test vessel. A carbon-steel vessel
(Fig. 17.18) has been fabricated for use in tests of the
prototype probe described above. The enlarged upper
part of the vessel, which is the bismuth reservoir, is
arrariged in such a way that known amounts of molten

225

bismuth can be added to, or removed from, the probe.

test chamber that is located below the reservoir. The
probe extends upward from the bottom of the test
chamber and will be secured in the test vessel by

welding the carbon-steel adapter to the bottom of the

test chamber. The enlarged lower section, which simu-
lates the interior of the high-temperature containment
vessel for the molybdenum reductive extraction equip-
ment, will be filled with an inert gas. Space is provided
for the 13-ft length of high-temperature electrical cable
(maximum rated service temperature, 2000°F) and for
the nozzle that duplicates the electrical and service
penetration on the containment vessel flange. The
probe will be installed in the test vessel as soon as
difficulties with shorting in the high-temperature elec-
trical cable and connector plug assembly have been
corrected.

18. Continuous Salt Purification

R. B. Lindauer

‘Studies were carried out to determine the cause of the
occasional high iron concentrations reported for
samples obtained during the previously reported experi-
ments' on the reduction of iron fluoride in molten salt
by countercurrent contact with hydrogen in a packed
column. Possible causes for the high iron concentration
are: (1) bypassing of suspended iron particles around
the poorly sealed sampler filter and (2) contamination
of salt samples with ‘iron from tools used during
removal of salt from the nickel sampler. The presence
of suspended iron particles in the filtered salt appears to
be ruled out by low iron concentrations (average, 68
ppm) reported for four large (4-g), unfiltered samples
taken from the system. Also, leaching of nickel speci-
mens that had been exposed to the salt in the system
with aqueous HCI showed only a negligible amount of

molten salt with hydrogen were continued after the
iron fluoride concentration in the salt (72-14.4-13.6
mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,) was increased to about 1000
ppm_(which should be sufficiently high to allow
accurate iron analysis). The pressure drop across the

~ column increased significantly due.to a partial restric-

iron deposited on the specimens. Therefore, it is

believed that the samples are being contaminated during
the removal of salt from the nickel samplers. In order to
‘minimize such contamination, the samplers were rede-
signed to obtain a larger (4-g) sample and were
~constructed of copper, which will facilitate removal of
‘the salt. The larger salt sample should also provide
improved sensitivity in the analysis for iron at low
concentrations. o -

fluoride is reduced during the countercurrent contact of

tion and limited the gas flow rate to about 20% of that
used previously with a comparable salt flow rate. Five
iron fluoride reduction runs were carried out at the
reduced gas flow rate; however, the extent of iron
fluoride reduction averaged only 6% per run (see Table
18.1) rather than 27%, as had been observed with
higher gas flow rates. With the lower gas flow rates, the
HF concentration in the exit gas stream was about 60%
of the equilibrium value, based on the concentration of
iron in the exit salt stream, instead of about 27%, which
has been noted with higher gas flow rates. During run
15, a hydrogen flow rate of only 300 cm?®/min was
used, and the extent of iron fluoride reduction was
about 100% of that which would have been obtained if
the salt and gas streams had been brought to equilib-
rium at the operating temperature of 700°C. The

~average mass transfer coefficient measured in this run

226

was only 0.002 ft/hr as compared with about 0.018
ft/hr measured in previous runs. |

Following these runs, the column was removed and
cut into sections in order to determine the cause of the
restriction. Most of. the Raschig-ring packing in the
column contained salt that had not drained from the
packing. In addition, a considerable amount of salt
could be seen between rings in the upper part of the

ses of the salt for iron indicated the expected concen-
tration of iron (640 ppm) for the material that did not

change color, while two samples that became rust- .

colored in appearance contained 890 and 2055 ppm of
iron. It appears that some of the salt globules contained
dispersed iron particles which oxidized on exposure to
air. Analysis of the black deposit in the upper part of
the column (after the material had been exposed to air)

indicated a nickel content of 49.2 wt % and an iron

content of 3 wt %. Analyses of packing removed at
12-in. intervals along the column showed little differ-
ence in the amount of deposited iron; the deposition on
the packing had an average thickness of 0.05 mil. The
observed differences in the manner in which nickel and
iron deposited .on the packing are quite reasonable since
NiF, is much more easily reduced by hydrogen than
FeF, . Hence one would expect the nickel to deposit in
the upper part of the column and the iron to deposit

 

228

almost uniformly throughout the column. The total
amount of iron contained on the packing, based on the
average iron deposition, is about 17 g. The amount of

iron believed to have been reduced in the system thus

far is about 24 g. Therefore, it appears that most of the
iron is deposited on the column packing as the FeF, is
reduced. ' : ' ,

A column of slightly modified design was fabricated
and installed. The cross-sectional area of the liquid

deentrainment section at the top of the column was.

increased by 75% and was packed with a 5-in. depth of
Raschig rings. The wall thickness of the ' -in. Raschig-

ring packing in the column was decreased from Y4 to
Y%, in., which should increase the throughput and

lengthen the operating time before flow restriction due

to reduced metals necessitates removal of iron from the -

packing. ’ g
