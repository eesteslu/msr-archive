FOREWORD

This is the quarterly progress
report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propui-
sion Project at the Oak Ridge National

Laboratory and summarizes the technical

progress on the project during the
-period covered. It includes not only
the work of the Laboratory under its
own contract, Y-7405, Eng 26, but such
research for the national ANP program

 

as 1s performed by Laboratory personnel.
The report is divided into four parts:
I, Reactor Theory and Design; 11,
Shielding Research; III, Materials
Research; and IV, Appendixes. As each
of these parts may be regarded as
a separate entity, each has a separate
"Summary and Introduction” which pre-
cedes the part in this report.
 
SUMMARY AND

The search for a nonoxidative high-
temperature fluid other than sodium
which would be suitable as a reactor
coolant has lead to the proposed use
of fused fluoride salts containing
uranium (Sec. 1). The resulting cir-
culating-fuel reactor would have the
important advantage of eliminating a
heat-transfer stage within the reactor
core. Preliminary design studies of
such a reactor indicate that a 3.5-ft-
“diameter beryllium oxide—moderated
circulating-fuel reactor will produce
around 350 Mw at amaximum temperature
of 1500°F, The design point of the
aircraft incorporating this reactor is
Mach 1.5 at 45,000 ft. Performance
and weights of the airplane, reactor,
shield, engines, and radiators are
being explored.

Although the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment (Sec. 2} was originally
intended as a prototype of the sodium-
cooled quiescent-liquid-fuel aircraft
reactor, substantial portions of the
~equipment would be applicable to the
circulating-fuel reactor. Consequently,
construction, design, and procurement
of equipment have proceeded on the
original schedule. The building
facility itself is 80% complete and
mest components are on their design or
delivery schedule.

Reactor physics calculations (Sec.
3) have been devoted primarily to the
staties, and to some lesser extent
the kinetics, of the circulating-fuel
reactor. The minimum uranium invest-
ment 1in the beryllium oxide—moderated
circulating-fuel reactor has been
determined as 69 1lb of which 26 lb 1is
in the core. (The uranium investment
in a water-moderated circulating-fuel
reactor is somewhat lower because of
the better moderating capacity of
water, but design considerations appear
to favor the use of Be0,) The percent

INTRODUCTION

thermal fissions of this BeO-moderated
reactor is 52, 1.e., the reactor lies
between epithermal and intermediate.
Kinetic studies, which have shown the
practicality of the conservation of
delayed neutrons, imply that the design
of the reactor must provide for as high
a fuel volume as practical, possibly
even at the expense of the uranium
investment.

A second mockup of the General
Electric "direct cycle” reactor has
been assembled (Sec. 4)}. The critical
mass of this assembly was 90 1b of
uranium.

The cross-sections of iron and
beryllium are being determined for
refined reactor physics calculations
(Sec. 5). Measurements of fast neutrons
in the 5-Mev Van de Graaff give an
average total cross-section for iron
which varies from 2.5 barns at 0.6 Mev
to 3.2 barns at 3.6 Mev. Upper limits
for the (n,2n) cross-section has been
determined in one case to be < 0.56
barn and in another to be < 0.26 barn.
Final adjustment are being made on the
time-of-flight neutron spectrometer
with which resolutions of at least
1.2 pusec per meter are anticipated.

The development of reactor plumbing
and associated hardware, while largely
concerned with that for a sodium-
cooled reactor, has been redirected
to the requirements of the circulating-
fuel reactor (Sec. 6). Valves, pumps,
seals, heat exchangers, and related
equipment are being developed for both
fluids for operation at reactor temper-
atures, i.e., up to 1500°F. However,
extensive development with the fluoride
fuels has first necessitated a program
for their manufacture, purification,
and handling; hence, to date the
experimental work with fluorides has
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

been somewhat limited. A frozen-
fluid-seal centrifugal pump which was
successful with sodium is being modi-
fied for use with the fused fluorides.
A centrifugal pump with a gas seal,
however, has already been used to
pump the fluorides satisfactorily for

short periods. Valve tests in sodium
systems show significant increase in
torque with time although several
combinations cf metals appear to resist
self-welding. A NaK to NaK heat
exchanger has now operated for 550 hr
with a maximum temperature of 1200°F.

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR

R. W. Schroeder,

The objective of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in the national
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program
is the development of high-performance
reactors, 1.¢., for supersonic propul-
sion. This implies the use of liquid-
conolant systems which require small
core sizes and have good heat-transfer
characteristics. The specific objective
of the ORNL-ANP project is, accordingly,
the exploitation of nonoxidative high-
temperature fluids. This line of
research avoids not only the high
pressures associated with some cycles
but alsc the oxidation inherent to
others. A sodium-cooled guiescent-
liquid-fuel reactor was the Laboraea-
tory’'s first considered proposal as a
reactor with potentialities for super-
sonic flight. However, the almost
prohibitively difficult task of
assuring the safety of a sodium~cooled
and water-shielded reactor, as well as
the limitations of a unifunctional
coolant, has enhanced the search for
a more versatile, and less inflammable,
coolant. As a result of this search,
OBNL has turned toward the use of
fused fluoride salts (generally a
ternary or quaternary sSystem composed
of uranium fluoride and a mixture of
two or three alkali1 fluorides or
beryllium fluoride) -—— not for just
the heat-transfer medium, however,
but as the reactor fuel as well. In
addition to the advantageous physical
properties of the fused salts (although
not so good as sodium from the stand-
point of heat transfer) and their
noninflammability in air and water,
an important advantage of such a cir-
culating-fuel reactor 1s that 1t
eliminates a heat-transfer stage
within the reactor core.

The advantage to be gained from
separating core and heat exchanger

ANP Division

cannot be overemphasized. Although
it is perhaps possible to conceive of
a small and at the same time a well-
designed 500 Mw heat exchanger, the
requirements of these entities are so
different that i1t is difficult te
design the heat exchanger into the
reactor without severely penalizing
both. Furthermore, whereas the sodium-
cooled reactor required considerable
departure from conventional design
practice to remove approximately 200 Mw
from a 3-ft core, it now appears
feasible, from a fabricaticnal and
fluid~flow standpoint, to remove
350 Mw from a 3%-ft core employing
circulating fuel.

The c¢irculation of fissionable
material external to the core dirscts
attention to design studies of the
entire system -— rveactor, radiator,
engine, etc. Although the circulating-
fuel system has not been studied suffi-
ciently long to ensure the performance
of the resulting aircraft, the more
outstanding problems of this cycle have
been appreciated. The preliminary
design studies which have been initiated
for the exploration of a supersonic
airplane application of a circulating-
fuel reactor are encoursaging. However,
performance and weights of the air-
plane, reactor, shielding, engines,
radiators, and other components are sco
interrelated that i1t was found necessary
to make studies of the overall arrange-
ment. The studies have not yet been
completed, and it is not possible to
to draw conclusions at this time.
However, the arrangement being studied
may be cursorily described. '

AIRPLANE AND OVERALL ARRANGEMENT

The airplane visualized is designed
for a speed of Mach 1.5 at 45,000 f¢,
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

with a gross weight of approximately
350,000 1b, an L/D ratio of approxi-
mately 6.5, and a wing loading of
approximately 70 1b/ft?, A divided
shield 1s employed with gamma and
neutron shielding about the crew com-
partment and neutron shielding about
the reactor. Six turbojet engines are
arranged 1n the fuselage in a circle
aft of the reactor-shield assembly,
and circulating fuel isducted directly
from the reactor to the engine radiators,
thereby eliminating the weight and
temperature loss associated with the
use of i1ntermediate heat exchangers.

REACTOR

Water-moderated and solid-moderated
reactors have been explored, and
tentatively, both types appear to be
feasible. However, the water-moderated
and -reflected reactor would, for
this application, require a water-
cooling system capable of disposing of
approximately 30,000 kw with a small
radiator temperature difference and a
small air temperature rise. The small
temperature difference would require
very large radiaters, and the small
air temperature rise would entail very
large cooling air flow requirements.
Further, the use of water as a moderator
involves a potential hazard associated
with rapid steam formation if a failed
fuel tube should permit abrupt mixing
of fuel and water. Accordingly, the
studies outlined here are based on the
use of BeO as amoderator and reflector.
Moderator heat is removed by the cir-
culating fuel and is employed usefully
in the propulsion cycle. By proper
allocation of coolant flows and
coolant-tube surface areas, it is
possible to maintain maximum coolant-
tube wall temperatures only slightly
in excess of the circulating-fuel
maximum temperature. To permit re-
moving reflector heat with a high
radiator temperature difference, the
design under study postulates cooling

the reflector with a non-fuel-bearing
fluoride mixture. This reactor con-
forms to the specifications given in
Table 1.1.

ENGINE

A circulating-fuel type reactor
should be inherently capable of supply-
ing propulsive power by means of a
turbojet cycle or either of several
vapor cycles. The relative superiority
of these cycles has not yet been com-
pletely established, but, pending com-
parisons, the use of the turbojet
cycle has been presumed. Preliminary
optimization studies have indicated
that a compression ratio in the region
of 6.1, with a turbine inlet tempera-
ture of approximately 1250°F, 1is
desirable. Further increases 1n the
compression ratio would diminish the
radiator weight at the expense of
engine weight, and further increases
in turbine inlet temperature {(with
fixed reactor conditions), would favor
turbojet weight to the detriment of the
radiator log mean temperature differ-
ence and radiator weight. More rigorous
evaluations of these component weights
will be required before the turbojet
specifications indicated here can be
accepted with any degree of fimality.
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

°

Installational convenience favors
the use of asmall number of relatively
large engines, whereas engine develop-
ment and availability considerations
favor the use of a larger number of
smaller engines., Tt is difficult to
predict at this time the size of engine
that could be made available when an
airplane of the type studied would
require these engines, but 1t appears
that the validity of the overall study
is relatively insensitive to the
number of engines presumed. Therefore
the use of six engines conforming to
the general specifications listed
in Table 1.2 has been assumed.

Calculations have indicated a

specific impulse of approximately 30

and overall efficiency of 30%. This
latter 1s defined as the ratio of mnet
thrust horsepower to reactor thermal
hersepower.

RADIATORBS

Radiators with heat-transfer capac-

ity per unit volume 1n excess of the
best obtained to date will be desired

for any ligquid-cycle supersonic
nuclear-powered airplane. Arrangements
are being made to receive the advice
and consultation of established heat-
exchanger manufacturers relative to
the design of radiators for such appla-
cations. This advice will not be
available for at least several months,
however, and

1t was necessary to
achieve a preliminary radiator design

in order to permit related phases of
the study to continue. The design
conceived of, which may be far from
optimum, involves a radial grouping
of rectangular-shaped banks about the
engine centerline between the com-
pressor and turbine. Liquid-conveying
tubes are passed through, and normal
to, closely spaced sheet fins. The
flow pattern contemplated 18 counter-
current, as dictated by the tempera-
tures of the two fluids. The arrange-
ment entails the use of dividing
baffles between adjacent banks, and
the 1nstallation of by-pass valves in
these baffles will permit controlling
turbine inlet temperature while a
substantially constant liguid tempera-
ture 1s maintained.

SHIELDING

Shielding calculations currently
are 1n process, and it 1s not possible
to make a guantitative description of
the shielding at this time. Initial
studies have indicated (see "Circu-
lating-Fuel-Reactor Shields™ in Seec.
8), however, that the circulating fuel
in the radiators and the associated
plumbing may remain unshielded provided
that sufficient neutron and gamma
shielding is placed about the crew
compartment, and alsec provided that
the payload, and possibly other com-
ponents, are protected by local
shielding.

It currently i1s contemplated that
the reactor shield will include only
hydrogenous material,

ACCESSORY SYSTEMS

Accessory circuits are required to
permit cooling the reflector and shield
and to provide power for pumps and
general aircraft accessory demands.
As it appears that many of the acces-
sories are favored by the use of
variable-speed drives, the overall
ANF PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

accessory system contemplated involves
the use of individual pneumatic tur-
bines for power supply. The energy
1s supplied, and reflector cooling 1is
achieved, by passing compressor bleed-
of f air through the reflector radiators
and then to the accessory turbines and
to parallel propulsive nozzles. The
accessory turbines are controlled by
me ans of variable-area discharge
nozzles, which provide some net thrust
after imparting energy to the accessory
turbines. Preliminary analysis of
this system indicates that 1t not only
provides reflector cecling and acces-

10

sory power adeguately, but that the
reflector cooling system, when con-
sidered as an open Braytom cycle
power plant, has a favorable cycle
efficiency and power-weight ratio. The
use of 1ndividual accessory drive
turbines permits supplying the acces-
sories with power and speed control
without special mechanical, hydraulic,
or electrical transmission systems.

The shield-water radiator is cooled
by low-pressure compressor bleed-off
air, and the =2ir is then discharged
through a propulsive nozzle.

2. LIQUID-METAL-COOLED AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

R. W. Schroeder,

Aircraft reactor cycles other than
the sodium-cooled stationary liquid-
fuel cycle have been(!”? and are (Sec. 1)
under active study. A large portion
of design effort has, therefore, been
diverted to study of these alternate
cycles., These i1nvestigations have
indicated a high probability that
substantial portions of the equipment,
designed for the original sodium-cooled
reactor experiment, would still be
usable 1f the ARE were to be a prototype
of one of these other cycles. Ac-
cordingly, design and procurement of
the building and equipment have been
continued on the original basis.

At the present time the facility
under contract te the Nicholson
company is approximately 80% complete.
All major fluid-circuit components
have been designed and are on order
or under construction locally, and
all core and pressure shell components
are either scheduled for fabrication
or have already been completed. Instru-
mentation, electrical circuits, and
remote-handling equipment have been
partially designed, and 1tems requiring
long fabricational time spans have
been ordered.

was a modification, to eliminate pre-
heating, of the use of sodium) is
approximately BO0% complete, and all
major components have been released
for procurement or local manufacture.

REACTOR CONTROL

E. S. Bettis

Research Director’s Division

Because of the proposed modifi-
cations in the ARE design, work on
the control system for this reactor
has necessarily slowed down. However,
satisfactory design of most of the
components of the control system had
already been attained.. The high-
temperature fission chamber failed at
T00°F and is being redesigned. Develop-
ment of the reactor dynamic computor
has continued.

Control System. Detailing of the
control rcom, console, 1nstrument
racks, and interconnecting cables has
continued. Discussion of the manu-
facture of the hardware incorporating
these designs was held with possible
outside vendors. Several companies

but no commitments

High-Temperature Fission Chamber.
The high-temperature fission chamber
was completed and tested. It failed
at about 700°F because the insulators
were inadequate. A new chamber,
correcting thisdifficulty, 1s presently
under construction and will be ready
for test in about six weeks. No
difficulty 1s anticipated in providing
a satisfactory fission chamber for use

in the ARE.

Reactor Dynamic Computer. The
reactor dynamic computer has progressed
to a point where 1t will be ready for
use in about six weeks. The converter,
from d-c to digital notation, and the
multiplier have been tested and
debugged.

INSTRUMENTATION

About 5% of the instruments required
for the ARE have been received, and
an additional 75% are on order and
should be received within four months.
Ten percent will probably be constructed
by the Laboratory because of unavaila-
bility from industrial concermns. The
remaining 10% are in a deferred status

12

pending the outcome of experimental
engineering investigations currently
in progress.

REMOTE ~-HANDLING EQUYPHMENT

Remote-handling equipment design 1is
in process, and some components have
been ordered. Demonstrations have
been made simulating installation,

removal, and reinstallation of the
core dome, involving a sequence of
welding, cutting, scarfing, and re-
welding. These demonstrations will

continue and will employ the automatic
cutting equipment intended for the

ARE.

Remote removal of the core dome
after power operation of the reactor
will be accomplished by means of
rubber-bonded abrasive cut-off wheels,
operating under water, driven by a
Vickers hydraulic system and guided
by peripheral tracks. This equipment
has been designed, some components
have been requisitioned, and other
components have been released to Y-12
shops for fabrication.

ARE BUILDING FACILITY

The building shell 1s virtually
complete; walls and roofing are 1in
place. Painting, plumbing, and internal
partitioning are in process. ORNL
engineering of special internal
features is approximately 80% complete
and should be ready for transmittal
to Nicholson via AEC in approximately
four weeks.

3. REACTOR PHYSICS

Nicholas M. Smith,

Significant studies by the ANP
Physics Group have been the surveys
of the circulating-liquid-fuel designs.
These surveys have been conducted
using bare-reactor theory (i.e., a
condition under which space and
lethargy variables are separable)
and for several parametric variations.
For a given moderator these parameters
were core diameter and the volume
ratio of circulating fuel to that of
the moderator. The rather extensive
bare-reactor calculations were made
possible by having the calculation
set up entirely on the Card Frograming
Computor IBM equipment.

Considered first are the values

of these parameters leading to a

minimum fissionable material in-
ventory in the overall system. When
the core diameter 1s fixed, 1t 1is

seen that as the fuel-coolant volume
fraction increases, the critical mass
increases but that the uranium density
in the fuel-coolant at first de-~
creases, then increases. The result
is that there is a minimum in the
uranium investment in the overall
system. This minimum usually re-
sults 1n a reactor with about half
thermal fissions, 1.e.,
the borderline between the epithermal
and the intermediate.

It 15 known from kinetic studies
that the ratio of fuel in the reactor
to that in the overall system should
be as high as is practical 1in order
to conserve delayed neutrons. Thus,
in comparison to the condition of
minimum critical uranium mass, the
condition of minimum overall uranium
mass results in a higher reactor-to-
system volume ratio and favors the
kinetic behavior. The kinetic be-
havior can be favored to an even
greater extent by choosing a fuel-

a reactor on-

Jr., ANP Division

coolant volume ratio greater than
that resulting in a minimum uranium
inventory. Since the curves of total
uranium inventory vs. fuel-coolant
volume ratio havea very broad minimum,
it is possible to design for a greater
fuel-volume ratio without greatly in-
creasing the uranium requirement.

Thus it becomes advisable to design
the reactor with as high a fuel volume
ratio as practical — say, one in-
creasing the uranium requirement 5%
over that of the minimum —~ in order
to favor the kinetic response. The
conditions of near-minimum uranium
mass and of favorable kinetic behavior
thus result in an increase of the
neutron spectrum, yielding a reactor
just barely in the intermediate class.
The trend of the nuclear design to
one of the intermediate class is thus
inescapable.

Very satisfactory agreement within
theory and critical experiment 1s
reported for intermediate uranium-
graphite and uranium-water assemblies.
The agreement gives corroboration to
the explanation that the discrepancy
between theory and experiment for the
uranium-beryllium assembly is caused
by omission of a significant physical
phenomenon, possibly the (n,2n) re-
action.

Water-Moderated Reactor. The first
calculations on the water-moderated
circulating-fuel reactor were made
with the NaF-UF, fuel-coolant since
density values on other possible
fluoride mixtures were not available.
The appearance of some data on the
new fuels NalF-BeF-UF, and NaF-LiF-KF-UF,
for use with circulating-fuel re-
actors subsequently permitted 1nitia-
tion of a more complete set of cal-
culations. Critical mass was deter-
mined as a function of reactor size
and percent fuel-coolant for all
fuel-coolants. The thickness of
reflector for saturated reflector
savings was estimated in all cases,
and the actual core radius was 1in-
creased by a fraction of this amount
{(plus augmentation distance) to obtain
the radius of the equivalent bare
reactor. This reflector thickness 1in

each case was such that a 6-in, re-
flector was still unsaturated. The
assumption that the reflector is
equivalent to added core material is
thus sufficiently accurate. All
calculations in the first survey have
been done on this equivalent bare
reactor.

Naf-UF, Fuel-Coolant. This series
of bare-reactor calculations were
made on a design series of the same
type as that used with the BeO~-moderated
reactor. Cores 2%, 3, and 3% ft in
diameter were used, with volume per-
cents of H,0 varying from 10 to 80%.
The first set of calculations was
made with the NaF-UF, fuel-coolant,
since density values for the two new
coolants were not initially available.
A reflector savings of 6 in. was in-
c¢luded i1n the usual way. Volume
fractions for the NaF-UF, —~cooled
water-moderated reactor are given 1in
Table 3.2. The core diameter for this
set was 3 ft. Calculations of uranium
mass vs. k_,. for this core indicated
that the critical mass i1is a very
slowly varying function of the percent
fuel-coolant, since a change from

15 to 35% results 1n an increase of
only 8% in critical mass in the
vicinity of 18 lb. Figure 3.8 1in-

dicates the total uranium inventory
and critical mass as a function of
fuel-coclant fraction for 15 ft* in
the heat exchanger. With the fuel-
cocolant NaF«UF4 and a 3 ft core, the
uranium inventory will be near 75 1b.

Figure 3.14 presents the summary
graphs for the system, showing critical
mass values for the cores and in-
dicating the minimum uranium require-
ments for the systems to be 127 lb for
the 2¥%-ft-diameter core, and 122 1b
for the 3- and 3¥%-ft-diameter cores.
The optimum volume fraction for fuel-
coolant in the core is mear 0.50, with
a very small sensitivity to this
parameter indicated by the small rate
of change between 0.30 and 0.60 volume
fractions.

This reactor has approximately 80%
thermal fissions.

Comparison of H,0- and BeD-Moderated
Reactors. These reactor series serve
to indicate the regions of interest
for possible designs. No attempt has
been made to compute any one design
in detail because of the sensitivaty
of reactivity calculations to shape
and constituents. The relative ac-
curacy of the results depends not only
on the usuvual assumptions but also on

the proximityof the estimated physical
constants {(such as the fuel-coolant
density) to their actual values, as
well as on the structural details.

Some of the differences between the
water-moderated and the Be0O-moderated
reactors are given in Table 3.4. More
detailed comparisons may be made
directly from the various spectra
that are presented for both types of
reactor.

In addition to the i1tems compared
in Table 3.4, the poisoning effect of
stainless steel is somewhat worse for
the BeO-moderated reactor. On the
other hand, there is a great deal
more escape of fast neutrons from the
H,0-moderated reactor. However, no
important "physical"difference between
the reactors has appeared to date, so
that design considerations must be
given the greater weight 1in choice
of a reactor type. Attention 1is
called to the large increase in
uranium inventory caused by the use

Effect of Delayed Neutrons on
Kinetic Response (C. B. Mills, ANP
Division). The importance of delayed
neutrons for controlling the speed of
response of a stationary-liqguid-fuel
ARE (Aircraft Reactor Experiment) was
determined by repeating a calculation
in which an increase in inlet coolant
temperature of 25°C is 1introduced
stepwise and then maintained and a

 

control rod is actuated to 1insert or
remove 0.00025 unit of reactivity per
second. Two-thirds and four-fifths
of the delayed neutrons were removed
from the kinetic response equations,
and the twe curves for (¢ - ¢0)/¢0 vs.
time were compared with the curve for
no loss of delayed neutrons.

The results in Fig. 3.15 1ndicate
a rate of change of flux three times
as great as normal when the fraction
of delayed neutrons is decreased by
80%. For a 67% decrease the rate of
change of flux 1is almost twice as
great as normal.

These results were then extrapolated
to the case of kinetic response of
the circulacing-fuel reactor. The
factors i1im the kinetic calculations
described above areabout the same for
the stationary and the circulating
fuel reactors with the single ex-
ception of fuel expansion in the fuel
tubes. However, for times less than
0.5 sec there 15 very little daif-
ference in the rate of change of flux
between the case with fuel expansion,
as it occurs in the stationary fuel
and the case with no expansion. 1t
appears therefore thatif a disburbance
such as the one specified above is
introduced, the kinetic response
within 1 sec thereafter 1s not sensi-
tive to fuel expansion and the circu-
lating-fuel-reactor flux will follow
a rate-of-change curve very similar
to that shown on Fig. 3.15. The loss
0of delayed nentrons from the core
up to 80% of these there for the
stationary-fuel case should not in-
crease the kinetic response rate of
the liquid fuel reactor by more than
a factor of three times that for the
reactors with stationary fuel for
which kinetic response data are

use KOH. However, the critical mass
for a 3k-ft-diameter KOH-umoderated
reactor is only 70 1b. The higher
critical mass of the smaller core

greater leakage of that core. More

4. CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS
A. D. Callihan, Physics Division

A second wmockup of the General
Electric direct-cycle (air-water
cycle) reactor was completed, and the
critical mass of the assembly was
found to be 90 1b of uranium. The
inhomogeneities of the mockup are
serious, however, and the extrapo-
lations of the critical mass of this
assembly to that of the aircraft
reactor are not yet reliable.

Considerable data have been taken
on the uranium graphite assembly, but
the results have not been reduced.

PRELIMINARY ASSEMBLY OF
DIRECT-CYCLE REACTOR

At the request of the General
Electric Company and with its co-
operation, studies are being made of
the proposed direct-cycle nuclear
reactor for aircraft propulsion. This
reactor, as presently conceived, will
be air cooled and water moderated,
with stainless steel as one of the
principal structural materials,
Beryllium will be the reflector. One
series of experiments was outlined in
the preceding report(!) and has been
described more fully elsewhere,{(?)

During the period reported here a
second mockup has been assembled and
made critical. The core is an approxi-
mate right cylinder, 36 in. long and
51 in. in diameter, the periphery of
which i1s not smooth because the

The gamma-ray and neutron yields
from the proton bombardment of Li7,
Be®, and F!9 have been extended to
approximately 5.4 Mev. These curves
are to be printed in the Physics
Division quarterly report for period
ending December 20, 1951.

The (p,n) thresholds for F!% and
Na2? have been determined to be
4,253 £ 0.005 and 5.09]1 £ 0.010 Mev,

respectively.

The total cross-section of ordinary
iron for fast neutrons has been
measured from 0.6 to 3.6 Mev with a
resolution of 35 kev. Unresolved
levels occur every 100 kev, with
indications that with better resolution
many more would be observed. The
average cross-section varies from 2.5
barns at 0.6 Mev to 3.2 barns at
3.6 Mev. These total cross-section
data have not yet been reduced to
specific cross-sections, which are
used inshield calculations.

MEASUREMENT OF THE (n,2n) REACTION
IN BERYLLIUM

E. D. Klema, Physics Division

The data on the (n,2n) reaction in
beryllium discussed in the previous
quarterly progress report{!) have been
reduced by G. B. Arfken to an average
(n,2n) cross-section for the spectra
of the two sources used. The calcu-
lations were made under the assumption
that a neutron which makes any sort of
collision [(n,n), (n,a), or (n,2n)] in
the beryllium sphere is lost as far as
producing the (n,2n) reaction 1is
concerned, The absorption of neutrons
by the beryllium sphere was estimated
from the data obtained with the carbon
spheres.

The upper limits for the (n,2n)
cross-sections as determined by this
experiment are as follows:

o.(n. 2n)

Po-a-B source,

< 0.25 barn

Po-a-Be source,

Sn,2n) < 0.56 barn
The upper limit of this cross-section,
although appreciably lower than that
reported by Houtermans, (2) is still
so high as to be capable of introduc-
ing a significant error in the critical
mass of a reactor assembly employing
beryllium, In reality, this cross-
section is the suspected cause of the
discrepancy in the calculated (disre-
garding the cross-section altogether)
and actual critical mass of the

6. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. S. Savage, ANP Division

The activities of the Experimental
Engineering Group now center around
the vigorous pursuit of the technology
of both sodium and the fused fluorides
to provide fundamental engineering
data through the development of actual
components: valves, pumps, seals,
heat exchangers, etc. Consideration
of the advantages of a circulating-
fuel-coolant reactor for aircraft
application necessitated a program for
manufacturing fluorides and for
determining their effects on container
materials and reactor components.
Approximately 400 1b of eutectic
LiF-KF-NaF has been produced for test
purposes.

A pump incorporating a gas seal has
satisfactorily pumped fused fluorides
up to 1300°F for 35 hr. Also, fluoride
transfer through small tubes has been
repeatedly demonstrated, as has
successful filtration through a 10-pu
sintered stainless steel filter. Thus
far, fluorides appear to reduce oxides
inside the system and to be severely
corrosive only in the presence of
oxygen. Equipment is being assembled
as rapidly as possible for conducting
self-welding and pump-shaft-seal
experiments with fluorides.

Continued work with ligquid-metal
systems during the quarter resulted in
a pump incorporating a frozen sodium
seal operating approximately 450 hr
with sodium at temperatures up to
1100°F with a pressure across the seal
of 25 psig. In other equipment, a
seal test rig operated with sodium at
1500°F sealing successfully against
107 psig. Electromagnetic pump-cell
development reached the stage at which
sodium was pumped at temperatures up
to 1300°F for approximately 160 hr;
test-loop heater limitations prevented

40

the attainment of higher sodium temper-
atures. Self-welding tests were
continued with sodium, and equipment
1s being modified to continue work of
this nature with fluorides.

Valve testing was continued to
evaluate certain commercially available
varieties for use in liquid-metal
systems. In some cases instrumentation
needs for fluorides are radically
different from those required for
liquid-metal systems; this program has
thus undergone change compatible with
the changes 1in ARE. Null-type pressure-
measuring devices were belng tested
with both ligquid-metal and fluoride
systems at the end of the quarter.
Preliminary work on heat exchangers
and analytical methods for sodium were
continued during the period, as were
cleaning procedures for both fluoride
and ligquid-metal systems. Planning of
full-scale ARE component testing
facilities were being continued along
only such lines as would allow the
facilities to be used for testing
either liquid-metal or fluoride
systems.

PUMP DEVELOPMENT

The centrifugal pump employing a
gas seal of graphite set against a
flat sealing face has operated with
NaK and subsequently with the fluoride
eutectic LiF-KF-NaF. The latter test
system was operated for 35 hrat 1300°F
and was terminated because of a leak
outside the pump. The design of the
centrifugal pump of the above type for
the liquid-metal (NaK) ARE has been
completed. The 1V-hp canned-rotor
pump, as rebuilt with high-temperature
(500°F) windings, has been satis-
factorily pretested with water, but
some difficulty has arisen in canning
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 16, 1951

the rotor. The 6-hp canned-rotor pump
operated poorly because of an inef-
ficient suction inlet, which is being
redesigned. The centrifugal pump with
a frozen-sodium seal operated with no
indication of seal failure for 450 hr
with fluid temperatures up to 1100°F,
Limited development of electromagnetic
pumps has continued, and two new
design cells have been tested.

Centrifugal Pumps for Figure-Eight
Loops (W. G. Cobb, ANP Division). The
centrifugal pump for liquid metals(1)
was operated on two occasions with NaK
as the pumped fluid. 1In the first
test pumping was continuous for 12 hr
and the NaK temperatures reached 820°F
be fore a leak
necessitated a

in a welded joint
shutdown. The second
test also was conducted with NaK, and
temperatures reached 940°F during the
12-hr pumping period. Excessive gas
leakage through the shaft packing and
gasketed joint under the stuffing box
necessitated termination of this test.

The pump and system were cleaned,
reassembled, and provided with heaters
and insulation to allow preheating to
approximately 1000°F. The system was
then filled with the eutectic LiF-KF-
NaF. Flow, metered by a sharp-edged
orifice with pressures being indicated
by gas trapped in bulbs connected to
the orifice taps, was approximately
4.8 ft/sec (about 6 gpm). Level
control was accomplished by means of
electrical probes and gas pressure
directly in the pump body. The test
system ran continuously for 35 hr,
pumping at temperatures up to 1300°F.
Considerable encouragement was derived
from the fact that gas leakage through
the shaft seal was negligible through-
out the run, and a2 small but definite

signal was observed from the electro-
magnetic flowmeter. Moreover, smooth
operation was obtained with a gas-held
level control. Although several small
leaks in the system developed, omne of
which eventually caused termination,
the pump itself operated satisfactorily
throughout the run.

ARE Centrifugal Pump Design. (W. G.
Cobb, L. V., Wilson, and J. F. Haines,
Consultant, ANP Division). The design
and detailing of a centrifugal pump
employing NaK for the ARE has been
completed, General design features
are compatible with those listed
previously(?? with the exception of
level-control features. Avoiding the
necessity for simultaneously develop-
ing a satisfactory pump and a level
control device appeared advisable;
this pump is therefore to be located
in the fluid circuit on the same level
as the expansion tank. Therefore, the
ligquid level in the pump 1s determined
by the level in the expansion tank,
and sufficient shaft overhang has been
incorporated to compensate for level
variations occurring in the surge
tank. A gas seal of graphite against
a flat sealing face has been in-
corporated in the design, and tempera-
ture control of bolted joints and pump
body above the casing is to be effected
by circulating gas. Also, provisions
for internal cooling of the shaft by
circulating gas have been included.
All bearings are external to the gas
space above the coolant being pumped,
and a circulated lubricant serves the
bearings as well as the graphite seal.
All parts except the impeller are to
be of fabricated and machined con-
struction. Impellers of Worthite have
been received from Worthington Pump
Corporation,

Canned-Rotor Pump (M. Richardson,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division), The NaK test loop discussed
in the previous report 1is being
mod1fied to include a 30-kw heater and
a vertical double-tube heat exchanger
in which water flows as a falling film
down the 8-ft length of the inside
2-in. tube and the sodium-potassium
alloy rises in the annulus formed by a
3-in. pipe. The two canned ¥%-hp
motors, wound with 500°F Class H
windings, have been tested in water
and found to operate satisfactorily.
Attempts are being made to can the
to protect them from
high temperatures.
Stainless steel has been used and
found to operate satisfactorily, but
the increase in gap caused by the
0.010-1n. wall of stainless steel
causes the current load to become
excessive, Some magnetic material
will be tried next which will protect
the rotor and reduce the stator-rotor

gap.

COTTrosi1on at

The 3- to 6-hp canned-rotor pump
was operated for a short period but
the performance was poor. It 1s
believed that this poor performance
was caused by the turbulence and
thrust load which, in turn, were
caused by the poor design of the
suction inlet to the pump. This 1is
being corrected by straightening out
the sharp bend at the suction face and
placing a baffle at the inlet to reduce
the pressure on the shaft at this
point, A sleeve bearing will be
introduced within the motor can which
will protect the can from damage
caused by misalignment but will allow
the rotor bearings

A new wire 1nsulating material
which is manufactured by the Bentley-
Harris Insulating Company of Coshocton,
Pa., would allow the canned-rotor

pumps to operate at 1200°F. This

42

insulation will be 1included in future
pumps. Investigations are underway to
determine the possibility of making
the rotors of suitable material, which
wi1ll make canning unnecessary.

Frozen-Sodium-Seal Pump (W. B.
McDonald, ANP Division). Testing the
frozen-sodium seal under dynamic
conditions was effected in an 1sothermal
test loop containing a modified
Worthington centrifugal pump. This
test ran approximately 450 hr at sodium
temperatures up to 1100°F, alimitation
imposed by silver-solder pump-casting
repairs. Flows up to 40 gpm were
attained, and the pressure differential
across the seal was 25 psig. No
indication of seal failure was observed
during the test.

Two-Stage Electromagnetic Pump (J.
H. Wyld and A, L. Southern, ANP
Division). Some parts of the two-
stage electromagnetic pump have been
received from the main shop; however,
the increase in emphasis on fused
fluorides has necessitated postponing

plans for immediate testing.

Electromagnetic Pump Cell Develop-
ment (A. G. Grindell, Engineering and
Maintenance Division). Two types of
electromagnetic pump cells designed by
ANP personnel for high-temperature
liquid-metal applications were given
preliminary tests during the period.
The first of these featured integral
construction of the throat and elec-
trodes from type 316 stainless steel.
Initial tests indicated that severe
local overheating occurred. The
second cell, employing nickel lugs
inserted into the stainless steel
pump throat and welded in place with
inconel filler, operated satisfactoraly
for approximately 160 hr, pumping
sodium at temperatures up to 1300°F.
Test-loop heater limitations prevented
raising the sodium temperature above

SEAL TESTS
W. B. McDonald, ANP Division

Many problems arising in connection
with pump development for liquaid
metals and fluorides may be more
properly classified as seal problems.
A program is underway in which various
types of seals are evaluated on pumps
as well as in simulated eguipment.
Seals currently being developed are
the frozen-sodium seal, the frozen-
fluoride seal, and the graphitar
ring-—tool steel gas seal. The frozen-
sodium seal has been successfully
tested for 1150 hr with pressure across
the seal of up to 107 psig. Only
limited success has yet been ex-
perienced with the two other seals.

Frozen-Sodium Seal. During this
quarter one phase of testing the
frozen-sodium seal was successfully
completed., Using the seal-testing
device described in a previous re-
port,¢?? the frozen-sodium seal
operated for a total of 1150 hr at
sodium bath temperatures up to 1500°F.
Maximum pressure across the seal with
no indication of failure was 107 psig.
Just prior to termination, however,
the pressure was raised to 150 psig,
resulting in a small amount of sodium
being forced out of the system around
the shaft. Pressure was further in-
creased to 200 psig in an effort to
make the seal fail completely, but the
leakage observed appeared to be no
worse than at 150 psig. Leakage was
at no time sufficient to cause a
serious sodium fire; rather, it was
characterized by sparks emerging from
around the shaft.

A design has been completed in which
the refrigeration coil, used in the
tests above to freeze the sodium, heas
been replaced by copper cooling fias
attached to the stainless steel sleeve.

 

(3)%'. B. McDonald, “Frozen-Sodium Seal,”
ORNL-1154, op. cit., p. 21,

Calculations indicate that a section
approximately 5 in. long and contain-
ing 3%-in.-diameter fins spaced 1/8 in.
apart are sufficient to freeze sodium
around the shaft by convective cooling
only. This radiant-cooled seal has
not been tested.

Frozen-Fluoride Seal. Design and
assembly have been completed on a
device with which to determine the
feasibility of a frozen-fluoride seal.
The principle involved is identical to
that of the frozen-sodium seal in
which the liquid is solidified in an
annulus between a sleeve and a rotating
shaft. (3)

The first test has been completed
in which the shaft, extending through
a finned cooling sleeve into a pot
containing eutectic NaF-KF-LiF-UF, at
1200°F, was driven by a 5-hp motor.
Pressure across the seal was 20 psig.
The test lasted for 19 hr hbefore a
heater failure and a leak caused
termination.

Postrun inspection revealed that
material was deposited on both the
shaft and sleeve, and some scoring
at the bottom end of the shaft was
observed. Whether the attack on the
shaft 1s chemical or mechanical was
undetermined, but the material deposits
were found to be magnetic.

Graphitar Ring—Ketos Toel Steel
Gas Seal. Testing of a graphitar
ring—Ketos tool steel gas seal was
continued during the period. Thas
type of seal, consisting of a graphitar
ring sandwiched between a stationary
and a rotating member both made of
Ketos tool steel full hardened, was
tested in the presence of air and of
helium to secure control data for
comparison with runs made in the
presence of NaK vapors. Successful
sealing was obtained in these i1nstances
with differsntial pressures of 5 psig.

43
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Three tests were conducted with the
seal operating in the presence of
vapor from NaK bath at 600°F, a seal
temperature of 500°F, a spindle speed
of 1300 rpm, and a differential
pressure of 5 psig. The first test
failed after 24 hr, and postrun ex-
amination indicated that the graphitar
had been attacked. Subsequent tests
operated under similar conditions with
no apparent attack on the graphitar
ring for 70 and 170 hr,
Failure in both cases appeared to be
due to eccentricity in the seal test
device. As the period ended, a fourth
test had been in progress for 220 hr
with no indication of failure. Ap-
parently the graphitar in the first
test was faulty,

respectively.

TEST LOOPS

A. G. Graindell, Engineering
Maintenance Division

A calibration loop for checking
electromagnetic pumps and flow measur-
ing devices is now being used routinely
for this purpose. The sodium manometer
loop for measuring flow rates has not
proved successful.

€alibration Loop. The calibration
loop was designed for testing electro-
magnetic pumps and flow measuring
devices. During the previous period
this loop was used for reproducing
manufacturer’s performance curves for
a type G-3 General Electric electro-
magnetic pump. This work was con-
tinued i1nto the present period with
the result that two electromagnetic
pump cells designed by ANP personnel
were tested. HResults of these tests
are included in the section "Electro-
magnetic Pump Cell Development™ (see
above).

Sodium Manometer Loop. During the

previous quarter, the sodium manometer
loop, designed for developing and

44

testing flowmeters, was used for test-
ing an electromagnetic pump. First
attempts to determine sodium flow in
the system resulted 1n plugging of the
small tubes connecting the flow nozzle
to the primary manometer. Efforts to
prevent this plugging by using NaK in
place of sodium as the working fluid
failed because NaK shorted electrical
probes 1n the level control device.
De-emphasis on liguid metals systems
in favor of fused salts caused this
project to be placed on a standby
basis.

SELF-RELDING TESTS

The self{-welding of metal to metal
contacts in a high-temperature fluid
stream, as might occur in reactor
pumps or valves, is being examined.
Tests of five pairs of metals under
static load in sodium for 100 hr have
been completed. Stellite against
stellite and inconel against zirconium
exhibited no welding. Test of valves
in sodium systems indicated a signifi-
cant increase 1n opening torque with
time. The valve had a stellite face
and a 316 stainless steel seat.

Materials Tests (G. M. Adamson,
Metallurgy Division)., Several ma-
terials were examined to determine
their self-welding properties at high
temperatures in the presence of liquid
sodium. A series of three cylinders
with diameters of 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8
in. were machined from one material to
be tested, and three corresponding
cylinders 1/2 in. in diameter were
machined from either the same or
different material. After being
polished, pairs of these were placed
end to end in the desired liquid bath
under a load of 75 1b for 100 hr. The
results, obtained in sodium at 1500°F,
were:

Valve Tests (W, C., Tunnell and K.
W. Beber, ANP Division). Valve testing
experiments were begun during the
gquarter to determine the suitability
of commercially obtained valves for
use in liquid-metal systems. The
first test was conducted on a Y%-in.
Powell bellows valve with a stellite
face and a 316 stainless steel seat,
The valve was installed in the hot leg
of a thermal-convection loop which was
filled with sodium and heated to
1500°F. The valve was to be left open
for 24 hr and then closed for 24 hr
with a torque of 20 ft-1b. The torgue
required for opening the valve varied
widely during the 323 hr of the test,
although the valve was operable at all
times. Postrun inspection of the
valve awaits availability of suitable
inspection equipment. :

A second test was started in which
two %-in. Powell bellows valves were
placed in parallel]l in the test loop
in order that the valves could be
alternately opened and closed on 24-hr
cycles, thereby permitting convection
fiow of the sodium at all times. The
valves in this test also had stellite
faces and 316 stainless steel seats
and were closed with 35 ft-1b torque.
Torgques required to open each ranged
from 20 to 53 ft-1b. The time of
closure was increased from 24 to 48 hr,
and the torque required to open the
first valve was 76 and 44 ft-1b after
the first two cycles, while the second
valve required 46 ft-1b after one
cycle, Valve tests were still under-
way at the end of the period.

The study of bellows type valves,
with the bellows surrounded by con-

ventional packing material, has been
suspended owing to the successful
operation of the conventional valves
and the emphasis on fluorides.

HEAT-EXCHANGER TESTS

A. P. Fraas and M. E. LaVerne
ANP Division

A heat exchanger with NaK as both
the primary and secondary fluid has
operated for 550 hr at temperatures up
to 1200°F. The agreement between
actual and expected heat transfer 1is
good at high (11 gpm) flow rates but
is poor at low (5 gpm) flow rates. A
heat exchanger (radiater) with sodium
as the primary fluid and air as the
secondary fluid has been designed and
built.

NaK to NaK Heat Exchanger. The NaK
heat exchanger figure-eight loop has
completed 550 hr of operation at
temperatures up to 1200°F and flows
of 5 and 11 gpm. Increased tempera-
ture could be achieved only by reducing
the flow rate. Present plans call for
continuing testing until 1000 hr of
operation has been completed.

Thus far there has been indicataon
of neither any increase in pressure
drop across the heat exchanger nor any
loss in heat-transfer performance.
This has been reassuring since the
heat-exchanger matrix was made of 1/8-
in.-o.d. tubes spaced 0.041 1n. apart,
and it had been feared that clogging
might be a preblem. All experimental
features of this loop have proved quite
satisfactory; for example, the nicro-
brazed electromagnetic pump cell,
by-pass filter, venturi, and null-type
pressure units have given no trouble.

Heat-transfer data at high flow
rates agree well with values computed

from Lyon’s formula, but data at low

flow rates give heat-transfer co-
efficients as much as 40% below the
theoretical values,

Sodium to Air Radiator. A high-
performance air-radliator core section
suitable for use 1n a J-53 turbojet
engine has been designed and con-
structed (Fig. 6.1). The core matrix
consists of 0.010-1n.-thick stainless
steel fins spaced 15 to the inch on
3/16-in.-0.d. stainless steel tubes.
The latter have been placed in a square
spacing on 2/3-in. centers. Parts for
the core-element test section have
been completed and are ready for
nicrobrazing, Preliminary testing 1is
to be effected with air supplied by a
blower extracting the heat which 1s
supplied by electrically heated Nak
pumped through the radiator.

LIQUID-FUEL SYSTEMS

E. Wischhusen and D. R. Ward
ANP Division

The fluid dynamics of the ligquid-
fuel system of the liquid-metal-cooled
reactor have been studied from mockups
of the fuel system. The first two
mockups(*’ were primarily glass systems
with a colored fluid and yielded use-
ful qualitative information on such
problems as filling and emptying rates,
valving requirements, bubble formation
and migration, and flushing methods.
A third mockup of the static-fuel
system was intended, but the design
change to a circulating-fuel system
and the difficulty in transferring
molten fluorides has directed attention
to their handling.

The fuel-transfer apparatus consists
essentially of two tanks, one in which
the raw material 1s introduced and a
second to which the molten fluorides

 

g, L. Meem, ‘““Bulk Shielding Reactor,”
ORNL-1154, op. cit., p. 83.

are transferred through a filter by
gas pressure, Fuel lines are 347
stainless steel while all other com-
ponents are of 316 stainless steel.
The filter is of 5-u stainless steel.
After the first transferral, a viewing
window was provided in the charge tank.

The fuel has been successfully
filtered and transferred from one tank
to the other., The unfiltered fluid is
generally dark, the filtered fluid
rather bright green and uniform in
appearance. At the transfer tempera-
ture, 1400°F (the melting point of the
fuel, NaF-KF-LiF-UF_, is 960°F), the
fuel has a watery consistency and a
concave meniscus. Postrun examination
of the equipment revealed a black
layer of uranium oxides on the bottom
of the supply tank and on the inlet
side of the filter. Portions of the
system wet by the fuel mixture exhibited
a rather bright satinlike appearance,
indicating the removal of welding
scale and oxides. Subsequent transfer
resulted in a leak in a connecting
fitting and after that a plugged
transfer line. Examination of the
filter now shows the presence of
bundles of dendritic metal crystals
which are being analyzed.

INSTRUMENTATION

J. F. Bailey and P. W. Taylor
ANP Division
A. G. Grindell, Engineering
and Maintenance Division

Instruments capable of giving
adequate indication and control of
either liquid-metal or fluoride systems
must be developed., Work is being
carried out on the development of
level-control, flow-measurement, and
pressure-measurement devices for the
ARE. Spark plugs appear satisfactory
for level control sincemolten fluorides
conduct electricity. Venturi methods

47
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

appear to be best suited for the
measurement of the flow of fluorides.
The null-balance type pressure-measur-
ing devices are suited for both liguid-
metal and fluoride systems.,

Level Control and Indication. Work
on instrumentation for level control
and indication for liquid-metal systems
centered around the testing of resist-
ance type probes. An experimental
loop for testing level control and
indicating devices was fabricated in
which a resistance type probe immersed
in sodium was connected to a Brown
potentiometer through a Wheatstone
bridge. As the sodium level fluctuated,
the resulting resistance change of the
probe produced a signal which both
indicated and controlled the level.
This method proved unsatisfactory
since the probe resistance constantly
changed as a result of sodium buildup.

[imited experience with fused
fluorides indicates that sparkplug
type level controls are adequate for
laboratory-scale systems. Solid-
state fluorides are nonconductors,
which eliminates the problem of elec-
trical shorting of probes previously
encountered with sodium,.

Flow Measurement. The shift in
emphasis to fused fluorides caused a
change in flowmeter development.
Electromagnetic flowmeters had received
major consideration for use with liguid
metals, but the comparatively poor
electrical conductivity of fused
fluorides as compared to container
materials made this means for detect-
ing flow appear impractical. On the
other hand, venturi methods of flow
measurement appear to be quite practi-
cable, having virtue in their sim-
plicity of construction and small head
loss under operation. Since this method
involves differential pressure measure-
ment, null-balance type pressure-
measuring devices are being examined.

48

Pressure-Measuring Devices. Seek-
ing suitable methods for measuring
pressure i1n liquid-metal systems led
to the modification of null-balance
type devices to meet specific needs.
The device in use, as modified,
operates on the principle of balancing
pressure on either side of a bellows
and employing electrical methods for
establishing approximate bellows
The bellows
1s essentially filled with
trapped gas which transmits circu-
lating-fluid pressure. This pressure

values within 0.1 psi, the pressure

ficiently to make electrical contact
which 1s indicated by a signal light
and/or a buzzer.

Although these pressure-measuring
devices were designed and fabricated
primarily for use with liquid-metal
systems, the only foreseeable objection
to their use with systems containing
fused fluorides 1is the methods used
for joining the bellows to bellows
heads. The search for suitable methods
for making these connections centers
around heliarc welding, resistance
seam welding, and nicrobrazing. Thus
far, two devices have been assembled
using nicrobrazing for joining bellows
and heads and have been installed on
the gas-seal fluoride pump.

FULL-SCALE ARE COMPONENT
TEST FACILITIES

H. P. Kackenmester and G. A, Cristy
ANP Division

Plans for full-scale testing
facilities for ARE components to be
located in Bldg. 9201-3 were reviewed
in relation to providing them by late
winter or early spring, 1952, For
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 16, 1951

the present, utilities and services
are being provided sufficient to handle
fluorides and other equipment capable
of being safely operated without test
cell enclosures.

Plans and specifications have been
developed for construction of an
equipment train in which fluid-flow
measuring instruments can be calibrated
and pumping characteristics can be
determined by weight-rate measurement
of fluid flow. Equipment for the
calibration system will be capable of
handling either liquid metals or molten
salts. Jnquiries to manufacturers
indicate that low-frequency (60-cycle)
induction heating apparently offers a
versatility along with higher heat-
input rates to vessels contalning
either liquid metals or molten salts
than can be achieved by radiant- or
conductive-heating equipment. Also,
investigations of fume-collecting
equipment show that several types of
relatively inexpensive commercial
equipment are available which will
collect 99%% of condensed dispersoids
of liquid wetals or liquid salts 1in
large guantities (20,000 to 50,000
cfm) of air in temperature ranges of

0 to 2000°F.

FLUORIDE PRODUCTION

L. A. Mann, ANP Division

The decision to make engineering-
scale tests on eutectic salts of
LiF-NaF-KF activated earlier plans for
assembling and fabricating production
type equipment and storage contalners
for this fluoride mixture. Liaison
with the Liguid Fuels Chemistry Group
was maintained in the effort to ensure
adequate quality and purity of product.

Early runs were made by charging
c.p. salts 1nto a melt tank 1n proper
proportions for producing the eutectic

mixture, purging air from the system,
and melting at 1825°F under 5 psi of
helium. Material was forced from the
melt tank into the receiver through a
5-4 sintered 316 stainless steel
filter by helium gas pressure. After
three melts, succeeding runs were made
uvnder approximately a 500-u Hgvacuum,
Also, 316 stainless steel scrap was
put into the chamber to "precondition"
the mixture., Thus far, seven melts
have been made, totaling approximately
400 1b of eutectic fluorides. The
addition of desired amounts of UF, to
certain batches has been accomplished
in the receiving tank. The entire
contents are agitated by bubbling
helium through the mixture.

CLEANING OF FLUORIDES VFROM SYSTEMS
R. Devenish, ANP Division

With the advent of fused fluorides,
the problem of removing the residue
from containers in asafe and efficient
manner arose. Sodium and potassium
fluoride constituents are comparatively
water soluble and hence present less
difficulty; however, lithium fluoride,
being only slightly soluble in water,
adhered to the container walls. The
best method found thus far for removing
this material i1is with hot 25 vol %
nitric acid solution. Aluminum
nitrate for this application proved
unsatisfactory.

In collaboration with the Health
Physics group the following pre-
cautions have been temporarily es-
tablished for working with fluorides:

1. Dust respirators should be worn
by personnel when charging the
fluorides of lithium, sodium,
and potassium i1nto production
furnace pots.

2. Assault masks withM-11 canisters
should be used when working with

molten fluorides in open con-

talners.

NakK DISPOSAL
R. Devenish, ANP Division

A method was formulated for dispos-
ing of used NaK which previously had
presented difficult storage problems.
In this procedure NaK was mixed with
graphite powder and kerosene, and the
resulting slurry was oxidized off with
steam. A continuous fire was observed
until all the NaK was consumed.

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION

E. P, Blizard, Physics Division

The aircraft unit shield design as
specified over one year ago by the Lid
Tank optimization experiments has heen
verified in the Bulk Shielding Facility
(Sec. 7). The calculations are now
complete and show a slightly lighter
shield (127,700 1b actual weight) than
was originally predicted. The experi-
ments in this shielding reactor have
been started on the divided shield.
A long period of detailed measurement
will ensue, however, before a divided
shield weight will be available.

The most significant progress in
the shielding art has been the air-
duct theory, which grew directlyout of
a series of tests in the Lid Tank
(Sec. 8). Measurements of the neutron
at tenuation in air ducts agree to
within 20% of the calculated dose.
For these duct sizes (2 in. 1.d.) with
bends, no correction 1s necessary for
streaming and the net effect of the
ducts on the shield weight is of the

order of 1 to 2 tons. This favorable
result with air ducts implies that
liguid-metal ducts would have a
negligible effect on total shield
weight.,

The divided shield mockup, mentioned
above, cannot provide shield weights
with the degree of accuracy possible
with the unit shield because of the
uncertainty associated with the trans-
mission of gamma rays in air. Conse-
quently, a proposal has been submitted
to the AEC for a "Tower Shielding
Facility” with which air scattering,
as well as the effect of this scat-
tering on the crew shield, may be
determined (Sec. 9). Shielding weights
and thicknesses have been estimated
for the circulating-fuel reactor and
do not appear to be significantly
different from those for the sodium-
cnoled reactor in spite of the circu-
lating fissionable material.

During this quarter themain efforts
at the Bulk Shielding Facility have
been devoted to analyzing and reporting
the results of the measurements on
the unit shield mockup and inpreparing
for and installing the divided shield
mockup.

REACTOR OPERATION

Preliminary measurements on the
temperature rise of the water flowing
through one of the reactor fuel elements
have been made, and the results look
reasonable. However, to obtain an
accurate value for the heat released
per fission, an especially insulated
fuel element is being ordered and the
measurements will be repeated.

Since the presence of the borated
water in the unit shield mockup altered
the power distribution i1n the reactor,
it was necessary to redetermine the
power with neutron-flux measure-
ments. {!? The total power of the
reactor against the borated shield was
only 3% less than the value found
previously with the reactor im water
without the shield. However , the power
generated in the front row of fuel
elements was 16% less with the reactor
against the shield than with no shield.

These new power measurements were
use to calculate(?’ the leakage from

evaluated as will be seen later.

with reactor operating at a power of
10 kw. Taking into account the attenu-
ati1on of a small amount of water and
aluminum between the reactor face and
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10,

leakage from the reactor into the unit
shield was

L, = F x 0,607 watts/cn’

at 10 kw power.

MOCKUP OF THE UNIT SHIELD

The results of the unit shield
experiments are presented in detail
in ORNL-1147.¢?) The experimental
curves for gamma rays, thermal neutrons,
and fast neutrons are shown in Figs.

7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.

In one experiment (Exp. 3) measure-
ments were made starting from the
surface of the last lead layer and
proceeding outward in the water of
the pool along the centerline. In
another experiment (Exp. 4) a tank of
borated water was placed around the
shield as described in an earlier
pProgress report,(q) and measurements
were made ocutward from the wall of the
tank. As the boron concentration was
increased, gamma measurements were
repeated, as shown in Fig. 7.1, until
a concentration of 0.4% was reached.

The weight of the unit shield as
specified by the Shielding Board(®’
was 134,000 1b for a 200-Mw reactor
in the shape of a 3-ft right square
cylinder with a dose of 1 r/hr al-
lowed at the crew, 50 ft away.

The power density of the aircraft
reactor was assumed to be constant,

and accordingly the leakage is calcu-
lated to be

It 1s convenient for the purpose of
these calculations to define a dosage
unit D as follows: The D unit 1s the
maximum dosage rate of nuclear radia-
tions that may be taken by military
persennel during a 25-hr flight of a
nuclear-powered aircraft. Accordingly,

1D =

1 r/hr of gamma radiation or

0.1 rep/hr of fast neutrons

The tolerance dosage of 1D is not to
be exceeded in any combination of fast
neutrons and gamma rays.

Fast-Neutron Dosage for the Unit-Shield Experiments.
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

For these calculations the 3-ft square
cylindrical aircraft reactor isclosely
approximated by a 3.8-ft sphere. The
significance of each term in this

expression 1s:

(S/R)? is the
attenuation due to reactor-
crew separation,

inverse-square-law

Lu/La is the ratio of leakages of
the two reactors, and

ru/ra is a factor which represents

the geometrical attenuation

in a shield with spherical

surfaces.

Using this formula and the data of
Fags, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, the shield
thickness was determined and the weight
of the aircraft shield was found to be
129,200 1b. Since the insertion of a
layer of lead in water has anegligible
effect on the neutron attenuation,; and
since the effective relaxation length
for gamma rays in lead at this position
in the shield has been established as
3 cmat the Lid Tank, 1t 1s interesting
to calculate the effect of adding or
substracting lead in the last layers of
the shield. This 1s done by holding
the total neutvon plus gamma dosage
constant but varying the fraction of
the dosage taken in either neutrons or
gamma rays. When lead is subtracted,
the apportioned gamma dosage goes up
and a thicker outside layer ol water
muist be added to bring the apportioned

neutron dosage down, and vice versa.

The results of these calculations
are shown inFig. 7.4, where the shield
weight 1s plotted against both the
shield thickness and the outside radius
of the shield around the Bulk Shielding
Reactor. The percentage of the dosage
taken in neutrons is also shown. In
Shield No. 1, the shield
actually measured as weighiang 129,200
1 (mentioned above), 44% of the dose
is taken 1n neutrons and the rest in

which was

gammas. For ease of construction of
the mockup all lead layers were made
with l-in. thicknesses. Actually, the
shield specified by the Shielding
Board was only 0.4 in. thick in the
last lead layer. If this excess lead
is peeled off and water added, the
weight goes down to 127,600 1b, as shown
under Shield No. 2 in Fig. 7.4. This
is the minimum weight of shield which
is possible with the present lead
spacing and boron concentration. This
shield is identical with that predicted
by the Shielding Beoard except it has
6 cm less water. The agreement in
weight 1s within 5%. All the combined
errors in measurement and calculation
from the bulk shielding data do not
add up to an error of 5% in shield
weight. It 1s estimated that these
combined errors would amount to less
than a ton.

The important result of these
exper iments 1s not that an aircraft
shield will weigh 127,600 1b, since
this is an ideal shield. The necessary
engineering will undoubtedly increase
1ts weight, while current Lid Tank
experiments iadicate that the addition
of more boron to the water with a
subsequent reoptimization of the lead
spacing may decrease the weight by as
much as 10%. The real significance of
these tests 1s that the methods of
calculation used by the Shielding
Board have been confirmed. Given the
proper specifications about the reactor
and airplane, it is probable that the
weight of an engineered unit shield
can be calculated from existing data
to within a few tons.

8. DUCT TESTS

C. E. Clifford, Physics Division

Following the decision of General
Flectric to build an air-cooled
reactor, 1t was decided that the Lid
Tank could do some useful experiments
to aid in the design of the air ducts
which penetrate the water-reactor
shield. As these experiments pro-
ceeded, the results indicated that the
problem of penetrating a water shield
with ducts, even though only filled
with air, was not so difficult as had
been previously supposed. Once a
theoretical evaluation of the experi-
ments has been made, the prediction of
the transmission through sodium-filled
only minor

ducts would i1ntroduce

complications.

AIR-FILLED DUCT TEST IN LID TANK

A. Simon J. D. Flynn
T. V. Blosser

Physics Division

Two types of air ducting are under
consideration: (1) small round pipes
with various bends, and (2) annular
ducts with various bends. In the
annular ducts the flow is confined to
the region between two large cylinders.
Bends are effected by displacing the
center of the ducts i1in fractions of
1ts diameter with both ends remaining
approximately fixed.

Cylindrical Ducts. Considerable
work was done on the round pipes since
they were believed to be the most
favorable arrangement, The size of
the ducts investigated was chosen on
the basisof pressure-drop calculations
made by the G.E. group. This indi-
cated that the pressure drop due to an
array of approximately 200 small
circular ducts on the order of 2 to 3
in. in diameter would not be excessive.
Design studies by the G.E. ANP group
have indicated that the ducting system

1s not radically changed i1n contem-
plated supersonic applications,

The measurements were concentrated
on the 1nlet air ducts, since these
ducts would face the crew compartment
and therefore would probably have the
greatest effect on the shield weight
due to the larger attenuation required
in that direction. After some experi-
mentation it became apparent that an
array of 2-1n. ducts on a 3.7-1n.
triangular lattice, four of which are
shown in Fig. 8.1, could be used with-
put seriously increasing the radiation
transmitted by the shield. This array
was built up of 2-1in.-1.d. electrical
conduit, the walls of which were
1/16-in. steel. Standard 90° elbows
were used which were bent onm a 10-1in.
radius. Each elbow had two 5-1n.
straight sections, so that when two
were joined by means of a standard
coupling, a 10-in. straight section
resulted. The assembled elbows were
held in place by wooden spacers and the
whole array was mounted in the Lid Tank
on a plywood table.

Neutron Transmission. The effect
of this duct array on the transmitted
radiation is shown in Fig. 8.2. This
shows the thermal-neutron-flux distri-
bution in the water beyond an array of
15 ducts, three rows high and five
rows wide. It was possible to measure
only thermal neutrons in these tests
because of time limitations and the
necessity of taking a large number of
data. However, 1t is felt that these
thermal measurements can be readily
interpreted in terms of fast-neutron
dose by correlations obtained from
measurements made 1in water of both
thermal -neutron and fast-neutron dose
under the same conditions. All that
is required is that at some point 1in

of the duct. When the center was dis-
placed onediameter, entirely eliminat-
ing a line of sight transmission down
the duct, the largest decrease was
noted, approximately a factor of 40.
Further displacement of the center
gave smaller decreases until, finally,
beyond a 30° bend no further decrease
was noted. Calculations for this
bend indicated that the intensity was
about what would be expected for the
reduced density shield.

Theoretical Duct Attenuation. On
the basis of these dataa simple theory
was derived which would predict the
geometrical attenuation of the duct to
within 20 to 40% for the various
configurations tested. The theory is
based on the picture of virtual sources
created at the bends of the duct with
the neutrons emerging with an isotropic
distribution from the walls. Since
these sources are small, the geometri-
cal attenuation is Jarge for duct
lengths that are many times the diameter
of the duct (in comparison to the
exponential attenuation of the sur-
rounding water). A fuller account of
this theory will be reported after
further experimental correlation.

Annular Ducts. One quick experi-
ment was done on a mockup fabricated
by G.E. to simulate a segment of an
annular duct (Fig. 8.5). The measure-
ments taken on this mockup are pre-
sented in Fig. 8.6. These data have
not been subject to analysis as yet,

12

but seem to indicate that theattenu-
ation of high-energy neutrons {(which

G.E. of these data indicates that such
a duct could be used, although it
results in a sizable increase in the
shield weight, The principal reason
for using this type of duct is to in-
crease the accessibilityof the reactor
faces for control mechanisms.

E. P. Blizard,

Present shielding facilities do
not permit a divided-shield mockup
which incorporates the effects of
crew-compartment shielding and air
scattering on the radiations emerging
from the reactor shield. Recause of
the importance of this effect on air-
craft shield weights, a proposal has
been submitted to the AEC for a new
shielding facility, called the "Tower
Shielding Facility," with which air
scattering and a crew shield mockup
can be effected. This facility could
be constructed at an estimated cost of

about $694,650.

Shielding weights and thicknesses
for circulating fuel reactors have
been estimated for application to
configurations as they are developed,
In general, these shields are pertur-
bations of the divided shield for the
sodium-cooled reactor. Divided-shield
design studies are continuing at NDA
in their effort for optimization of
this shield weight.

It was recognized in the Shielding

not on so firm a ground as those
leading to the weight of unit shields.
Unit shields have subsequently been

Bulk Shielding Facility, and the

resultant weights were in excellent
agreement with those predicted by the
Shielding Board. A divided-shield 1is
now being mocked-up in the PBulk
Shielding Facility. However, the
information to be obtained from this
mockup 1s only the intensity and
direction of the radiations emerging
from the reactor part of the divided
shield. One of the larger uncertainties
in divided-shield weights 1s the
assumed scattering of the complex
spectra emerging from the reactor
shield and the effect of thais radiation
at the crew shield after having been
air-scattered.

Since an increase of 1 1b in shield
weight entails an increase of 2% 1b in
aircraft weight,{(2) considerable
effort is justified in specifying
shield weights as closely as possible.

reason that some of this shielding
could not be removed from the reactor
shield, but some other modification
may be reqguired, for example, the
location of gamma shielding around the

No calculations have been made
concerning the gamma shielding, but
for the present it seems safe to assume
that the exposed fuel will not consti-
tute a source much worse than some
cases already considered, namely, the
sodium coolant discussed in ANP-53,(1!)
It 1is also apparent that the divided
shield for the circulating-fuel reactor
is not fundamentally different from,
but merely a perturbation of, the
shield design for the sodium-cooled
reactor.

SUMMARY AND

Recent interest in the high tempera-
ture circulating-fuel reactor has
emphasized the need for liquid fuels
or low (below 450°C) melting point with
relatively low (4 to 8 1b/ft®) uranium
concentration. Five fluoride systems
fulfilling these requirements have
been studied. Research on the chemistry
of these and other high-temperature
liquids, such as, the development of
liquid moderators, self-moderating
fuels, and the investigation of fluoride
mixtures as possible reactor coolants,
are reported im Sec. 10. Several
ternary systems of alkali fluorides
and beryllium fluoride are shown to be
suitable coolants and are also of
potential value as solvents for UF,
in the development of fuels.,

Static corrosion tests of fluoride
fuels i1indicate that these fluids are
readily contained at 1500°F by inconel
and any one of a number of stainless
steels (Sec. 11). Dynamic corrosion
tests in inconel have been similarly
successful, but the two stainless steel
loops in which the fluorides have been
circulated have plugged, presumably
as a result of mass transfer. The
static and dynamic corrosion of these
fluoride mixtures, which are of primary
interest to the circulating-fuel
reactor, are, except for the dynamic
test 1n stainless steel loops, reason-
ably satisfactory. Considerable
research has been undertaken in attempts
to contain the alkali hydroxides in
nickel and the structural metals.
Static-corrosion tests of hydroxides
have shown, however, that only nickel,
copper, and the more noble metals will
withstand the corrosive action of
these media. Furthermore, dynamic-
corrosion tests of hydroxides in
nickel have indicated severe plugging,
also, as with the fluoride in stainless
steel, the result of mass transfer.
Fundamental studies of this phenomenon

INTRODUCTION

indicate that oxygen may play an

important role in mass transfer, at
least in hydroxide-nickel systems.
Heat-transfer research (Sec. 12)

has been concerned primarily with the
determination of heat-transfer coeffi-
cients of various systems, including
those of the fluorides, hydroxides,
and liquid metals. Although satis-
factory data have not yet been obtained,
mathematical solutions have been
derived for the temperature structure
in forced-convection fluoride systems.
Excellent agreement has been obtained
between theory and practice for the
natural convection i1n a brine solution
simulating the fuel elements; the peak
temperature 1s substantially reduced
from that computed assuming conduction
only. HRoutine measurements are now
being made on the heat capacity of
materials and the density of high-
temperature fluids. Some data are also
available on the thermal conductivity
of materials and the vapor pressure
and viscosity of the fluoride salts.

The metallurgical processes involved
in the construction and assembly of a
high-temperature core, including
welding of fuel tubes, fabrication of
solid fuel elements, and creep and
stress rupture of metals, are currently
under investigation {Sec. 13). The
fabrication of solid-fuel elements
has been further refined by the evalu-
ation of the effects of the particle
size of the UQ, powder, rolling temper-
ature, and elimination of the capsule
during hot rolling. Satisfactory spot
welding and brazing of these fuel-
plate laminates has also been demon-

strated. The creep and stress~rupture
testing of reactor fuel tubes in
sodium has been initiated. Stainless

steel tubes have withstood hoop stress
up to 2600 psi for 1000 hr at 1500°F
in sodium, whereas similarly stressed
inconel tubes failed.

Although no pronounced radiation
damage effects have yet been observed
in irradiation of the constituents of
the aircraft reactor in the X-10
graphite pile or the Y-12 cyclotron,
the one irradiation of a fuel capsule
in the higher-flux LITR showed an
increase of corrosion products in the
fuel, an increase in the decomposition
of the fuel, and an 1ncrease 1n

corrosion of the capsule (Sec. 14).
It is not yet possible to draw any
conclusions regarding the significance
of radiation damage to the aircraft

are completed. A second irradiation

atures up to 575°C has not confirmed
the decrease in thermal conductivity

Warren Grimes,

Research in the ANP Chemistry Group
has been concerned almost entirely
with studies of high-temperature
liguids for use as fuels, moderators,
and/or heat-transfer fluids for an
aircraft reactor. The general prop-
erties required of such liquids along
with progress 1in development of such
materials have been described 1n
previous reports (see p. iv for list).
The research effort i1s at present
concerned with fuel and woderator
development with somewhat less emphasis
on the heat-transfer fluid (coolant)
development program.

Hecent interest in a high-tempera-
ture circulating-fuel reactor has
emphasized the need for liquids of
extremely low melting point with
relatively low uranium concentration
(4 to 8 1b of uranium per cubic foot),
Five systems fulfilling these require-
ments have been studied, but the
program for the development of self-
moderating fuels has not produced
materials more satisfactory than those
previously described.!) Several
moderator-cooclant systems have been
examined, but this program has not
been vigorously pursued pending the
demonstration, 1n design studies and
corrosion research, of the appli-
cability of these systems. Investi-
gation of fluoride mixtures as possible
reactor coolants have shown several
ternary systems of the various alkal1
fluorides and beryllium fluoride to
be suitable.

Phase equilibrium studies utilizing
the technique of thermal analysis(?+3)
were directed initially toward develop-
ment of fluoride mixtures with high
uranium content and melting polnts
below 550°C. A previous report(*’
listed nine systems which promised to
fit these gqualifications. However,
only three of these systems show low
melting points in the range 0 to 2.5
mole % UF, and promise to be of use
in circulating fuel reactors. This
relative scarcity of suitable fuel
mixtures along with the desirability
of lower melting liquids for such
reactors has prompted additional study
of systems containing low concentrations
of UF,. In addition 1t has been
necessary to re-examine 1n greater
detail the low-uranium regions of some
of the known systems.

At present the five systems listed
in Table 10.1 are those which appear
promising as circulating fuels. The
examination of several of these listed
systems is far from complete, and 1t

is possible that continued study will
result in compositions of lower melting
point. In addition, it should be
emphasized that the search for such
fuels was initiated quite recently
and it 1is likely that the list will be
extended considerably in the future.
As i1t is probable that four-component
systems will be required for melting
points below 350°C, such research will
consequently bhe relatively slow,

Examination of Table 10.1 indicates
that BeF, is a component of the lowest
melting systems. Indeed, 1t seems
certain that BeF, and LiF will be
components of any fluoride system
melting below 350°C.

The various fuel systems studied
are described briefly under appropriate
headings below.

1s substantially correct. The lowest
melting point found in this system was
470 + 10°C at 5 mole % UF,, 55 mole %

point at l mole % UF, would be approxi-

indicate that the addition of several

does not raise the melting point
appreciably. This system will be of
definite interest and will receive
additional study 1f it appears that
melting points of the order of 450°C
can be tolerated.

Difficulty in establishing true

These data show that this system
offers the lowest melting point avail-
able to date. Although some of these

mixtures were stirred at tempevratures

well below 300°C, it is possible that
extensive supercooling occurred. It
1s not possible to give any estimates
of the viscosity at these low tempera-
tures although such studies are being

made.

IONIC SPECIES IN FUSED FLUORIDES

M. T. Robinson

Materials Chemistry Division

Determination of the electrolytic
transference numbers in fused mixtures
of UF, and alkali fluorides has been
attempted in an effort to determine
the nature of the 1onic species 1in
these systems. In advance of the
experiments i1t was thought that the
uranium existed in solution as U*’ or
as some species of negative complex
ion, e.g., UF~ Electrolytic trans-
ference experiments should distinguish
clearly between these two possibilities
but would be less likely to determine,
with certainty, details of the nature
of species differing sllghtly from
those mentioned, e.g., UF*’ or UF,

Experimeantal Procedure. The
electrolytic vessel consists of a
graphite cup acting as the anode 1in
which 1s suspended a graphite rod
cathode. The anolyte and catholyte
are separated by a diaphragm of
platinum sponge. The apparatus 1is
sealed, evacuated, provided with an
inert atmosphere, and maintained at
temperature 1n a molten lead bath.
The electrolytic current provided by
two 6-v storage batteries is maintained
at about 0.3 amp for 90 min, after
which the apparatus is cooled. The
anolyte and catholyte are remcoved
separately, dissolved in HNO,;-A1(NO,;),
solution, and analyzed for U, F~, and
alkali metal ions.

82

Electrolyses have been performed
at both 750 and 900°C on a binary
mixture containing 28 mole % UF, and
72 mole % NaF. From the chemical
analyses before and after the experi-
ment, and from a knowledge of the
quantity of electricity passed, 1t is
possible to derive the transference
numbers of the various i1oms present.

Results of Electrolysis. It
appears that both sodium and uranium
are deposited at the cathode and that
fluorine is evolved at the anode. No
uranium (from anodic formation of UF)
has been detected in the vacuum lines
of the apparatus. A deposit of NaF has
been observed 1in the quartz tube con-
taining the electrolysis cell. This
is probably due to volatilization of
sodium and subsequent reaction with
evolved fluorine. The apparent
deposition of both metals 1s 1n agree-
ment with the reported partial reduction
of UF, by metallic sodium.(?’

The data indicate that no appreciable
quantity of uranium is transferred into
or out of either compartment. If com-
plex ions of the type UF:' are assumed
to be present, only the assumption that
n = 4 yields results i1in which the
transference numbers of all i1ons are

However, the
4 does not mean
that uranium 1s present as un-ionized
UF,, but simply that no detectable
transfer of uranium takes place. This
result is 1n excellent agreement with
the theory of Frenkel('%) of the
electrical conductivity of fused salts.
Briefly, Frenkel states that the
conductivity of a fused salt may be
taken as due only to the smallest 1on
present. The 1onic radii of the Na®,

F~, and U** ions are 0.98, 1.33, and

between 0 and unity.

0.97, respectively.(!?) Since the
sodium and uranium(IV) ions are about
the same size, 1t appears that uranium
is complexed with fluoride in some
manner, although the precise nature of
the complex canmot be clucidated from
the presently available data.

It 1s 1intended to extend the work
to another solution of UF, in NaF and
to two solutions of UF, in KF. Since
the radius of the potassium ion 1s
about the same as that of the fluoride
ion, it may be possible to throw more
light on the nature of the uraniferous
ion from measurements on mixtures
containing KF.

The solubility of uranium trioxide
in mixtures of sodium hydroxide and
sodium tetraborate with and without
additional boric acid has been previ-
ously reported.‘!?? It was found that
the presence of borate increases the
solubi1lity of uranium 1n sodium
hydroxide but that the concentration
of borate required to give a useful
solubility is so high that the melting
point of the resulting mixture 1is
above 500°C. Additional studies have
been made utilizing other hydroxides
and borates in an attempt to find a
mixture which will dissolve sufficient
uranium and still possess a sufficiently
low melting point. Nelther the
addition of borates nor of any of
several other materials appears likely
to yield a hydroxide mixture melting
below 600°C and containing 2 to 4 wt %
dissolved uranium. All experiments

Uranium Solubility in Hydroxide-
Borate Mixtures. The results of some
of the experiments in which borate-
hydroxide mixtures were used as
solvents are summarized in Table 10.5.
These data 1ndicate that the solubility
of uranium at 650°C is too low to be
of any interest. It does not appear
likely that any combination of hydroxide
and borate will be found having a
melting point below 500°C and dissolving
2 to 4% uranium at 600°C.

of these materials withother compounds.
Since 1t 1s apparent that the most
difficult problem 1n use of these
materials 1s control of the corrosion,
major emphasis in the program 1s in
that field (see Sec. 11, Corrosion
Rescarch).

Relatively pure samples of the
bydroxides of sodium, potassium,
barium, strontium, and lithium have
been prepared. Study of one bimnary
hydroxide system and several hydroxide
fluoride systems were completed during
the past quarter. Pending encourage-
ment from corrosion studies no further
studies of this kind seem justified
at present.

Preparation of Pure Hydroxides
(L. G. Overholser, D. E. Nicholson,
E. E. Ketchen, and D. R. Cuneo,
Materials Chemistry Division). Sodium
hydroxide has been purified in pound
batches by removing sodium carbonate
from a 50% aqueous solution of NaOH
followed by dehydration. The residual
sodium carbonate concentration 1is
about 0.5 wt %. Attempted methods for
purifying potassium hydroxide have
included recrystallization of this
material from isopropyl alcohol and
precipitation of carbonate as barium
carbonate in aqueous medium. While
not completely satisfactory, the
former method has proved the bhetter,
yielding potassium hydroxide with a
total alkalinity greater than 99% and
with less than 0.5 wt % potassium
hydroxide. Approximately 10 1b of
barium hydroxide has been purified by
removing the carbonate 1n aqueous
solution, recrystallizing barium
hydroxide octahydrate, and dehydrating
under carefully controlled conditions.
The resulting samples have contained
less than 0.4 wt % contaminant 1n the
form of either the oxide or carbonate.
Strontium hydroxide is being purified
in an analogous manner. Commercial
lithium hydroxide monohydrate has been
found to be quite pure on dehydration.

apparent that up to 15 mole % NaOH or

CGOLANT DEVELOPMENT

Investigation of low-melting
fluoride mixtures of possible appli-
cation as coolants has been continued
during the past quarter. While a few
binary mixtures have been examined,
largely to fill gaps in the available
literature, most of these studies have
been concerned with termary systems of
the various alkali fluorides and
beryllium fluoride. In addition to
the value of such data in coolant
development, any low-melting composi-
tions which are found are of potential
value as solvents for UF, 1in the
development of fuels of low uranium
content.

been examined i1n order to complete the

The Fuel Preparation and Service
Group was called upon to fill a wide
variety of containers during the past
quarter. The amount of fuel required
ranged from 0.5 to 3900 g. The 3900-g
batch of material required the con-
struction of special equipment for
melting and filtering the fused salt.
This equipment has been used several
times successfully. The filtering
material 1s sintered stainless steel,

RESEARCH

During the past quarter a consider-
able change in emphasis occurred in
the corrosion testing program. While
fluoride fuels and coolants continued
to receive some attention, a major
effort was placed on attempts to
contain the alkali hydroxides in
nickel and the structural metals.
Corrosion tests have been run at
800 to 815°C in various nonmetallic
media, including the molten hydroxides
of barium, stromium, sodium, lithium,
and potassium and molten sodium
cyanide. Some tests were run on the
liquid metals sodium and lead to
check previous results.

In the corrosion tests with the
hydroxides 1t was found that only
nickel, copper, and the more noble
metals silver, gold, and platioum will
withstand the corrosive action of
these media. Therefore coatings of
copper and nickel on structural mate-
rials, stainless steels and inconel,
were tried with variable results.
Tests are underway to determine the
minimum coating thickness needed.
The hydroxides exhibit considerable
metal transport {mass transfer) in
tests when there 1s a temperature
gradient across the tube and the
hydroxides are flowing. Sodium,
potassium, and lithium hydrdxides,
circulated in nickel thermal-convection
loops at 1400°F, each provoked suffi-
cient mass transfer to plug their
respective loops. This mass transfer
phenomenon 1s being studied with
thermal-convection loops of two
different designs and with two addi-
tional pieces of equipment, a thermal
gradient standpipe furnace and a

88

"seesaw" furnace in which the hydrox-
ides are sloshed back and forth from
the hot to the cold portion of a tube.

In addition, work has been started
on a fundamental approach to the
problem of the reaction of the hydrox-
ides with metals at high temperature.
Some of the first tests tobhe run in the
NaOH-nickel system demonstrate the
role oxygen plays 1in the metal trans-
port phenomenon; in thermal-convection
loops the presence of oxygen will
increase the amount of mass transfer.
Results from thermal gradient stand-
pipe tests have shown the effect of
hydrogen atmosphere onmetal transport.
Considerable research will be needed,
however, before the transport phenomenon
will be understandable.

There i1s no evidence of unusual
problems concerning the behavior of
fluoride mixtures 1n static tests with
structural metals. Such tests have
demonstrated that the pretreated
fluoride mixtures can be contained in
capsules of inconel or 316 stainless
steel. Dynamic-corrosion tests of
fluorides in inconel convection loops
have been completely satisfactory
although similar tests 1w stainless
steel loops have shown appreciable
mass transfer. There is evidence that
the iron and nickel content of the
pretreated fuel decreases after 100 hr
of exposure 1n the structural metal
while the chromium content of the fuel
increases. This phenomenon, however,
is not completely certain and 1s being
investigated further because of the
light i1t may shed on the pretreatment
problem.

STATIC CORROSION BY FLUOGRIDES

H. J. Buttram C. R. Croft
N. V. Smith J. M. Didlake

Materials Chemistry Division

No information was obtained which
would change the previously reported(!’
conclusions that properly treated
fluoride mixtures present no serious
corrosion problems with structural
metals, such as inconel and stainless
steel, 1n static tests for periods up
to several hundred hours. This applies
also to the low-uranium-content fuels,
as well as to the uranium-free alkali
fluoride mixtures. Exposure at temper-
atures up to 900°C for 100 hr also
yielded satisfactory results.

Although the fluorides were pre-
treated in the majority of cases,
untreated fluorides did not seriously
attack inconel test specimens. Pre-
treatment with a single metal rather
than by alloys appears to be feasible.
The mechanism of the pretreatment
process 1s not completely clarified
yet, but it 1s receiving further
attention.

Mixtures containing lead fluoride
(60 mole % NaF, 23 mole % PbF,, 17
mole % UF,) were subjected to the
standard corrosion test. Materials
containing PbF, are unsatisfactory.
The mixture was found to be unstable
and the metallic lead which formed
alloyed with the container metal. No
further tests are planned with mixtures
containing lead fluoride.

Stabilization of capsules of stain-
less steel and inconel by pretreatment
with elemental fluorine was attempted
wlthout significant effect. No
difference was observed in corrosion

materials as compared with untreated

STATIC CORROSION BY HYDROXIDES

W. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division
F. Kertesz, Materials Chemistry Division

A number of corrosion tests have
been made at 800 and 816°C for 100 hr
in nonmetallic media which might find
possible application as reactor
moderators or coolants. These include
the molten hydroxides of barium,
sodium, strontium, lithium, and potas-
sium. JThe media were dehydrated
commercial products and especially
pure sodium, potassium, and barium
hydroxides. Purified sodium hydroxide
appeared somewhat less corrosive than
did the dehydrated commerical material;
similar benefits do not appear from
purification of potassium and barium
hydroxides.

Without reference to change in
mechanical properties it would appear
that potassium hydroxide 1s less
corrosive on inconel than is sodium
hydroxide. Changes 1in mechanical
properties of the test specimens have
not been examined. In these tests,
however, nickel and copper resisted
chemical reactionm with most of the
hydroxides. Stainless steels coated
with copper and nickel were therefore
a logical development to combine
strength with corrosion resistance.
It has been found, however, that thin
coatings are not effective 1n suppres-
sing corrosion whereas heavier coatings
do show promise. Tests are underway
to determine the minimum coating
thickness required and the factors
which influence the adherence of these
coatings.

The temperature dependence of the

attack was also investigated; at 500°C
potassium hydroxide showed only a very

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

slight penetration which increased
somewhat at 600°C and became much
stronger when temperatures of 700 and

was concerned, 1t appeared that most
of the attack occurred during the first
few hours of the exposure.

Corrosion of Uncoated Metals (A.
D. Brasunas, D. C. Vreeland, E. E.

inmolten hydroxides of sodium, lithium,
potassium, barium, and strontium for
100 hr and at temperatures up to 816°C.
These tests were conducted in evacuated

containers of the same composition as
the metal specimen., The results with
barium, strontium, sodium, and lithium
hydroxides are summarized in Tables

tively. Most metals and alloys are
susceptible to hydroxide corrosion 1in
varying degrees, the notable exceptions
being nickel, copper, and monel. :

These vresults were obtained with
especially purified sodium hydroxide,
while the potassium hydroxide was a
dehydrated commercially pure product.
There was evidence of decreased
corrosion i1n sodium hydroxide which

The depth of attack on the different

with the formation of a 20-mil oxide

layer (Fig., 11.3). The attack by
barium hydroxide on nickel Z was

Chromium, while suffering a uniform
surface solution to a depth of 3 mils

hydroxide. After 1 hr the penetration
is only 1 to 2 mils, and relatively
slight additional attack occurs during

Of equal importance is the effect of

to determine the temperature at which
only negligible attack occurs during
the usual period of 100 hr. Figure
11.10 shows the behavior of potassium
hydroxide in inconel at 500, 600, 700,
and 800°C. At 500°C there is no
visible attack. At 600°C there is
localized attack. In the sample shown
a penetration of 5 to 6 mils can be
observed. This is not found to be the
case 1n other portions of the test
specimen and 1s pictured here to
illustrate occasional erratic be-
havior of the hydroxide-metal systems.
At 700°C there is some pitting and
penetration which does not always
follow the grain boundaries. The
attack at 800°C is considerably worse.
Weight loss data (plotted in Fig.
11.11) indicate a strong increase with
increasing temperature.

A series of thermal standpipe tests
1s 1n progress using potassium hydrox-
ide at 538 to 815°C in an attempt to
determine the rate of reaction at these
temperatures and the effect of the
types of atmosphere above the hydroxide
on the rate. Vacuum, air, and hydrogen
are being used. Preliminary results
in air and vacuum indicate that both

316 stainless steel and inconel are
attacked. The depth of attack at
538°C is of the same order of magnitude
as that noted i1n a static corrosion
test at 816°C, i.e., around 0.006 in.
In hydrogen, however, no corrosion
product was noted on either 316 stain-
less steel or inconel at 538°C. At
704°C shallow corrosion had occurred.
Verification of the above preliminary
results is being sought.

Corrosion of Coated Metals. Nickel
and copper have been found to be among
the few metals which are resistant to
molten hydroxides. Therefore these
materials have been applied as protec-
tive coatings on stainless steels for
use 1n contact with the hydroxides.
Preliminary results indicate that
corrosion protection can be achieved
in this manner.

Type 304 stainless steel was found
to be severely attacked by sodium
hydroxide at 815°C in a 100-hr test.
The depth of metal showing oxidation
by the molten caustic was 25 mils.
Consequently, it was decided to evaluate
the protective coatings of nickel and
copper by depositing them on this
steel.

STATIC CORROSION BY SODIUM CYANIDE

A. D. Brasunas R. B. Day
E. E. Hoffman D. C. Vreeland
Metallurgy Division

Numerous molten salts have been
considered for use 1in a reactor, but
cyanides do not appear to have been
mentioned. This nonoxidizing salt
is quite stable at high temperatures
and has been used extensively in the
heat treating and carburization of
metals. Pure sodium cyanide melts at
564°C (1047°F); however, this tempera-
ture can be lowered by suitable addi-
tions. The specific heat of sodium
cyanide is reported as 0.25 Btu/lb
(solid) and 0.40 Btu/lb (liquid); the
heat of fusion is 135 Btu/lb. Uranium
is appreciably soluble in sodium
cyanide at 816°C. A number of static
corrosion tests on a variety of
metals and alloys were run at 816°C
for 100 hr using evacuated capsules.
The results are given in Table 11.7.

The cyanide reaction consists in
carbon and/or nitrogen absorption by
the metal. This frequently results
in embrittlement as determined by a
simple bend test at room temperature.
There is, of course, the possibilaity
that embrittlement does not occur at
high temperatures but is merely a
room- temperature phenomenon.

The superiority of nickel and high
nickel alloys (inconel and nichrome V)
in resistance to carburization is well
known. Iron also appeared to be quite
inert to the molten cyanide, while
stainless steels showed varying
tendencies for reaction. The results
obtained with iron were somewhat
surprising. The lack of carburization
and subsequent embrittlement could be
caused by the absence of oxygen which
is essential to this reaction.

 

(3)4.5.M. Handbook, p. 694, 1948.

Silicon additions are known to be
very potent in suppressing carburi-
zation of commerical alloys that are
ordinarily susceptible to carbon
adsorption.

STATIC CORROSION BY LIQUID METALS

A. D. Brasunas R. B. Day
E. E. Hoffman D. C. Vreeland
Metallurgy Division

Corrosion tests of up to 1000 hr
of sodium on 315 stainless steel and
lithium on coated 304 stainless steel
have been completed. The attack by
sodium was negligible even at tempera-
tures up to 1000°C and did not appear
to increase after the first 100 hr.
Molybdenum and chromium coatings on
stainless steel have somewhat, though
not yet sufficiently, reduced the
attack by lithium.

Sodium on Stainless Steel. Long-
time tests in liquid metals initiated
some time ago have recently been
evaluated. Tests have been run with
316 stainless steel in contact with
sodium up to a thousand hours at
816 and 1000°C. The attack was
negligible at both temperatures.
Static corrosion tests have also been
made on 347 and 316 stainless steel
and inconel in sodium at 650, 704,
and 816°C for 100 hr. Attack in these
tests was also negligible, although
some embrittlement was noted. The
results are summarized in Table 11.8.

Lithium on Coated Stainless Steel.
Type 304 stainless steel specimens
were thinly coated with molybdenum and
chromium by the Linde Air Products
Company. These specimens were tested
in lithium at 1000°C for 100 hr in the
usual manner. The attack of the under-
lying metal, although somewhat mini-
mized, was not eliminated as much as
had been hoped. It is believed that

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

W. D. Manly
Metallurgy Division
W. R. Grimes
Materials Chemistry Division

Reported failure of the empirical
approach to furnish a satisfactory
container material for molten hydrox-
ides has emphasized the need for
fundamental understanding of the
mechanism of corrosion and mass trans-
fer of metals by these liquids. At
present 1t 1s not possible to state
with certainty the nature of the chemi-
cal reactions taking place; attempts
to minimize or control the corrosive
action are difficult to plan system-
atically.

Efforts to understand the nature
of the reacting species are, at present,
directed along two parallel lines.
Electrochemical studies of two different
types are attempting to define the
ionic species involved in corrosion
and mass transfer and are intended as
useful tools for study of these com-
plex phenomena. In addition, a careful
study of mass transfer, as well as
other aspects of corrosion such as
diffusion of various atoms from liquid
phase into the solid phase, and the
effects of various atmospheres and
other environmental factors on corro-
sion has been undertaken. One of the

110

primary aims of this work will be
concerned with the development of a
suitable inhibitor for corrosion in
the chemical sense and for inhibition
of metal crystal (mass transfer)
formation. These programs have been
initiated only recently, and results
to date are tentative and incomplete.
Sufficient progress has been made,
however, to indicate that useful data
will result from these approaches.

Division). Apparatus and materials
are being assembled for the measurement
of electrode potentials i1n fused
hydroxides. The apparatus will permit
measurements involving a range of
temperatures (325 to 1000°C) of
solvents (fused hydroxides), of solutes
(NiO, Cr,0,, FeO, etc.), of electrode
materials (Ni, Fe, Cr, Ag, Pt, C,
alloys), and of atmospheres (H,, He,
vacuum). A nonmetallic cell container
and diaphragm will be used over as much
of the temperature range as possible.

An attempt will be made to develop
reversible electrodes which correspond
to reactions of the type involved 1in
the corrosion and mass transport
phenomena. If such electrodes can be
devised, it will be possible to deter-
mine free energies and temperature
dependencies. This may provide an
understanding of the mechanisms of
these processes and hence point the
direction for their prevention.

Measurements now in progress involve
the concentration cell

Ni, NiO (dissolved in NaOH at c,) ||
NiO (in NaOH at ¢,), Ni

to determine whether the Ni-dissolved-
NiO half-cell is reversible.

Polarographic Study of Sodium

FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

Chemistry Division). Techniques for
the study of polarographic curves to
_indicate the presence of contaminants
~in fused caustic are under investi-
gation. Because of the high conductivity
"of molten NaOH, a rather elaborate
_compensating circuit 1s required in
~order to distinguish the polarographic
waves. As presently operated, using
~a Brown recorder to trace the curves,
- the position of the waves is indicated
- by sharp peaks 1in an otherWISeascendlng
" current-voltage curve.

Sufficieﬁt reproducibility has not
not yet been achieved, but the results
~are encouraging. JIrials with a
- stationary platinum electrode showed
- two peaks with NaOH contained in =
platinum crucible under a nitrogen
~atmosphere. These peaks, at -1 and
-1.4 volts, may have been attributable
"to platinite and platinate ionmns.
. The instrument was modified and it was
~ found advisable to operate the polaro-
- graphic cell in a vacuum te avoid
~erratic behavior apparently due teo
convection currents caused by surface
cooling in the presence of a gas.
Hydrogen was an ountstanding offender
in this connection. It will be of
~interest to modify the apparatus so
that gaseous products from the mixture
~can be analyzed. So far it seems
~improbable that the peaks can be
assoclated thh Na* or NaH.

Experiments with NaOH contained in
~silver.give peaks occurring at different
~voltages than those encountered in
" platinum; however, the experiment is
~ being repeated under improved condi-
tions. The solidified NaOH contained
a mat of fine metallic needles which
appeared to have been freely suspended
in the upper part of the melt. These
are pictured in Fig. 11.17 but have

not yet been identified.

Snrveytlfthe Mzss-Transfer Pheneme;
non {W. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division;
F. F. Blankenship, and R. P. Metecalf,

Materials Chemistry Division). The
phenomenon of mass transfer of nickel
in systems comntaining caustic has
been reported from a number of 1nstalla-
tions which have experimented with
these materials under a variety of
conditions. The experiments which
have definitely shown this phenomenon
are descrlbed briefly helow. :

Summary of Experimental Observe-
tions. Experimental Engineering
thermal-convection loops have shown
adherent wall deposits in colder
regions and Spongy dendritic plugs in
hotter regions in three experlments
using loops of Y%-in. nickel pipe
approximately 90 in. in circumference.
Velocities of about 25 ft/min and a
temperature differential of 760 to
680°C prevailed in these experiments.

NACA. Temperature gradient loops
with centrifugal circulation utilizigng
a temperature differential of 815 to
800°C with velocities of 15 ft/sec gave
massive wall deposits in cooler regioas.
Mass transfer was accelerated by the
addition of sodium metal. '

BMI. Corrosion tests 1in a nick§1
pot having a thermocouple well, gas
inlet tube, and specimen support
immersed in the melt showed heavy
deposition of nickel at the liguid
level around metal walls and at culder
portions.

NACA. Corrosion tests 1in sealed
crucibles with a temperature differ-
ential of 815 to 730°C from top to
bottom gave rise to a crystalllne
deposit in the colder portion.

X-10. Asingle low-velocity thermal-~
convection loop locaded under hydrogen
utilizing a temperature differentizal
of 700 to 425°C developed a scattered
deposit on the cold wall with small
evidence of dendritic plugging in
in 300 hr of operat1on. ,

small amounts of deposited metal after

Instances in which directly observ-
able deposits of metal were not apparent
were as follows:

weight losses but no significant mass
transfer.

sion tests with hydrogen covering the

evidence of mass transfer and very
little oxidation product in 100 hr.

Chemical Examination of Plugged
Convection Loops. In view of the
failure of mass transfer to develop
in certain cases 1n which 1t was
expected, particular attention has
been paid to the contents of plugged
loops obtained from the Experimental
Engineering experiments mentioned
above and described in greater detail
elsewhere in this report.

A mapping of the extent and general
appearance of deposited metal was
carried out. No correlations were
achieved, largely because of the lack
of uniformity of the deposit on colder
walls. There rough sparse deposits
were blotched with dull surfaces and
with regions containing fine dense
crystals. Occasionally the line of
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10,

demarcation between sharp, bright
needlelike crystals and a dull surface
was surprisingly sharp. Such lines
occurred in both the upper and lower
arms, running longitudinally along
the tube as though tracing a liquid
level., Uniformly, the hotter sections
beyond the dendritic plugs were highly
polished. Surfaces in the immediate
vicinity of plugs were visibly pitted
but bright.

Hydroxide from various portions of
the loops was submitted for analysis
with the results shown in Table 11.11.
A careful study of the oxidation
products from sections of the KOH loop
is still in progress. On being
leached with water, the hotter portions
gave rise to a gelatinous black
precipitate which dried to a brownish
powder. Colder regions yielded brown

1951

powder, and the trap contained a
mixed green and black powder. Tiny
metallic crystals were also found in
each case. X-ray-diffraction methods
showed only NiO and nickel in varying
proportions in the residues obtained
from nine different regions in the

KOH loop.

An extensive black deposit from the
cold leg of the LiOH appeared to be
NiO from the standpoint of X-ray
diffraction, but the chemical analysis
showed only 49% Ni. There was much
less discoloration of the surface of
the hydroxide as found in the filling
chamber in the case of LiOH,

Spectrographic examination of the
pipe of which the nickel loop (con-
taining NaOH) was constructed showed

Mn, indicating that cobalt and copper
tend to be transported to a greater
extent than iron and manganese.

Conclusions. Regardless of differ-
ences in proposed mechanisms, the
oxidation of nickel 1s an essential
part of all plausible explanations of
mass transport., There 1s reason to
believe that, even with large tempera-
ture gradients, mass transfer would

114

not be a problem in nickel—-molten
hydroxide systems operated under
conditions such that the oxidation of
nickel does not occur.

A small step toward this end has
been the attempted development of
nickel vessels suitable for carrying
out the final stages of hydroxide
purification, and of such design that
the molten hydroxide could be trans-
ferred to experimental apparatus
without exposure to air or other
sources of contamination.

12. HEAT-TRANSFER RESEARCH AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

H. F. Poppendiek, Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Experimental temperature measure-
ments in a simulated liquid- fuel
element, using a brine solution as the
hcat-generation medium, indicated
significant reduction of fuel-element
center temperatures at high heat
fluxes as a result of free convection,
These results are in general agreement
with the theoretical work which has
been carried on.

The fused-salt heat-transfer
apparatus has been completed, and
test-section heat-loss calibrations
are currently being made. Upon com-
pletion of these calibrations heat-
transfer coefficient measurements for
the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic are to be
obtained. Progress has been made in
ligquid-metal heat-transfer work on
lithium and sodium systems. Analysis
of data on entrance-region heat
transfer in sodium is presented, along
with mathematical solutionms. Mathe-
matical solutions have also been
derived for forced-convection heat
transfer (laminar and turbulent flow)
in long smooth pipes containing fluids
with uniform-volume heat sources.

Data are being obtained on heat
capacity, density, and vapor pressure
of materials., Some data have been
obtained on viscosity and thermal
conductivity, but further measurements
awailt the completion and testing of
additional equipment, Heat-capacity
data have been determined for uranium
fluoride, a lead-bismuth alloy, a
fluoride-fuel mixture, nickel, and
sodium hydroxide. Measurements on
thermal conductivity of diatomaceocus
earth have been obtained by use of a
radial-flow apparatus, while other
equipment for measuring this property
in ligquids and in solids 1s nearaing

completion, Data on density and

vapor pressure of fluoride salt
mixtures have been obtained, from
which coefficients of expansion and
heat of vaporization have been calcu-
lated. Some values for the viscosity
of fluoride salt wixtures have been
obtained, while other viscosity
apparatus remains under construction.

NATURAL CONVECTION 1IN
LIGQUIB-FUEL ELEMENYS

M. Tobias, Reactor Experimental
Engineering Division

Preliminary data have been obtained
on a new simulated fuel-element system,
described in the previous guarterly
report.{!) A 25% solution of NaCl in
water was used as the heat-generation
medium, and cooling was effected by
natural convection from the wall of a
3-mm quartz tube to a stirred bath.
The results plotted in Fig. 12.1 are
for six series of tests at coolant
temperatures of 8, 12, 17, 29, 32, and
66.5°F, respectively. The ordinate
9/9c 1s the ratio of the measured
temperature difference between the
wall and the axis of the tube to the
temperature difference computed from
the conduction equation for the systen.
The data are in general agreement
with analytical (laminar flow) so-
lutions for values of the scource term
that are less than 110 watis/cm?;
at this point the ordinate decreases
sharply. This decrease is attributed

_ A coolant jacket is being added to
the quartz-tube system so that the
cooling will be accomplished by forced
flow parallel to the quartz tube. The
flow rate and the axial temperature
gradient of the coolant will be
measured.

Four analytical solutions which
relate radial temperature distributions
to several dimensionless moduli,
including such variables as pipe
diameter, volume heat source, physical
properties of the fuel and coolant,
and coolant fluid flow rates for
free-convection systems, have been
obtained for the laminar flow region.(®

 

(2)Three memorandums on this are to be
issued around January, 1952.

Similar solutions for the turbulent-
flow regime are being sought. A new
parallel-plate apparatus in which the
velocity distribution will be measured
is being constructed which will employ
an electrolyte as the heat-generating
mediuvm.

HEAT-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS

Heat Transfer in Fused Hydroxides
and Salts (H. W. Hoffman and J. Lones,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division). The apparatus for the
determination of the heat-transfer
coefficients of molten salts and

are being carried out. Heat-transfer
measurements using a fluoride mixture
will be made upon completion of these
calibrations,

FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 18, 1951

Since the last report the experi-
mental system has been fully instru-
mented, and all tanks and flow lines
have been cleaned with 2 nitric acid
solution and filled with approximately
200 1b of the NaF-EF-LiF cutectic.
During the filling operation several
cold spots were noted i1n the system,
and the auxiliary heating circuit was
altered to eliminate these regions.
The system has been further modified
to include mixing pots of a helical-
coil design immediately preceding and
following the test sectiom in order
to determine more accurately the
entering and leaving mixed-mean
temperature of the test fluad.

Heat Transfer in Moltem Lithiun
(H. C. Claiborne and G. M. Winn,
Heactor FExperimental Engineering
Division)., It was previously re-
ported¢?’ that the modified figure-
e1ght system for the determination of
lithium heat-transfer coefficients
had been successfully operated, and
that preliminary heat-transfer data
had been obtained. To facilitate
accurate separation of the individual
thermal resistances from the experi-
mental overall heat transfer coef-
ficients, a large pump (approximately
40 gpm at 100 psi) 1is required. Since
a pump of the required capacity
appeared to be unavailable 1n the
next few months, 1t was decided to
hold the figure-eight system in stand-
by status until the regquired capacity
pump is obtained and to build a smaller
system utilizing a heat-transfer
section that is resistance-heated by
an electrical current. The latter
method obviates fluid thermal-resistance
separation techniques and has the
additional advantage that it allows
the measurement of the actual heat
flux distribution along the tube
length,

Tra?§fer in Molten Lithium,’ OBRNL-1154, op. cit.,
p- 9.

Construction of the new system
is about 95% complete. Data are
expected to be obtained by Janunary,
1952, for Reynolds meoduli up to 40, 000.

The design gqualifications for the
test section are:

1. About 95% of the heatis generated
in the tube wall,

2. The average temperature differ-
ence betwsen the wall and the
fluid mean temperature is at

least 10°F.

3. The axial mean temperature rise
is at least 10°F,

4., At least 75% of the thermal

resistance 1s 1n the lithium.

5. There is a maximum of 3000 amp
to the test section.

6. The length-to-diameter ratio of
the test section is 100.

Qualifications 1 and 2 require a metal
having high thermal and electrical
conductivities. Copper was selected
as the material for the test section,
A 10-hr static corrosion test(*) at
450°F indicated that a polished copper
specimen lost only 0.02% in weight.
Therefore it appears that copper will
resist attack by lithium long encugh
(about 20r 3 hr) to take the necessary
data if the maximum operating tempera-
ture does not exceed 450°F.

A flow diagram of the system 1is
shown in Fig. 12.2. The dimensions of
the test section are: length, 11¥% in.;
1.d.,, 0.1175 1in.; and o.d., 0.1715 in.
Flow is produced by two electromagnetic
pumps 1in series (previous operational
data indicate that this arrangement
will give 1.7 gpm at 40 psi). Flow
measurements will be made with an

be calibrated in place. The bypass
is used for testing the circuit and
for obtaining approximate equilibrium.
This prevents unnecessary exposure of
the copper test section to lithium.
Before data on the test section are
obtained, the bypass will be frozen
and disconnected to prevent short-
circuiting of the heating current to
the test section. The tube can be
easily replaced in case of failure.

It 1is felt that the described
system will produce satisfactory

118

lithium heat-transfer data and, with
modification of the test section,
will allow the heat-transfer charac-
teristics of other liquid metals to be
determined in the same apparatus.

Entrance-Region Heat Transfer in a
Sodium System (W. B. Harrison, Reactor
Experimental Engineering Division).
The system built for obtaining entrance-
region heat-transfer coefficients to
molten sodium has been described in
previous guarterly reports (see p. 1v
for list of previous reports). Briefly,
the test section consists ofa circular
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

copper plate having a hole in the
center anda tube around the periphery.
Sodium flows through the center hole,
and a cooling or heating medium is
circulated through the tube at the
periphery., The plate is insulated to
promote radial conduction, and the
temperatures at different vadial
positions were measured in order to
determine the copper surface tempera-
ture at the copper-sodium interface
and the rate of heat flow through the
plate.

A total of 48 experimental runs
have been made to date. Plates of
1/16 and 1/8 in. thickness have been
used 1n conjunction with hole diameters
of 1/16, 5/64, and 3/32 in. Values of
P, D/L ranged from 140 to 585, where
P_is the Peclet modulus, D is hole
diameter, and L 1s the plate thick-
ness, All data were taken with the
sodium in turbulent flow at tempera-
tures between 250 and 310°F. The
data have been extremely erratic
and very low when compared with the
predictions based on the postulates of
slug flow (uniform velocity distri-
bution} with heat transfer by molecular
conduction only. In a number of
cases the data were low even when
compared with predictions based on the
postulate of laminar flow (parabolic
velocity distribution).

Following are several possible
explanations for the low data:

1. Peculiar velocity distribution,
This might be caused by creep of
the gasket upstream from the
plate. It was found that some
creep actually does take place.
However, the effect was practi-
cally eliminated by giving the
gaskets a preliminary compression
set at the operating temperature.

2. Nonwetting of the copper by the
sodium. There are few data
available on wetting of surfaces

4.

by sodium, but it appears that a
clean surface is wet by sodium
without difficulty, even at the
low operating temperature, The
surface in the test section was
degreased with a detergent and
electrochemically polished. No
significant changes resulted in
the data.

Precipitation of oxide on the
heat-exchange surface. This was
considered to be a possibility
during the runs in which the
sodium was being cooled. The
apparatus was equipped for heat-
ing the sodium without signifi-
cant improvement of the data.

Contamination of the sodium such
that its properties have been
altered; particularly, the
thermal conductivity has been
reduced, The chief contaminant
is the oxide, with some iron
particles also in suspension,
This appears to be the wmost
likely cause for the erratic and
low data. The system is presently
being cleaned and modified so as
to minimize contamination. There
has been a fairly consistent
decrease in the heat-transfer
coefficients with time, implying
that the condition is being
aggravated by a buildup of
contaminant., It is believed
that particles of oxide and 1iron
have been suspended in the
stream, such that the extent of
contamination exceeds the equi-
librium solubility of sodium
oxide in sodium. The oxygen
comes from three sources: (a)
residual oxygen in the system
prior to loading the sodium;
(b) residual oxygen in the form
of oxide on the surfaces of
sodium bricks which were loaded
into the system; and (c) oxygen
present in the argoun used in the

system., A filter is being in-

‘stalled in the sodium line so as

119
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

to remove oxide 1in excess of the
equilibrium solubility. In order
to eliminate the oxide introduced
during loading of bricks directly
into the system, a separate melt
tank will be used. From this
tank the sodium will be trans-
ferred into the system through a
filter,. In order to reduce
contamination from the gas,
helium will be passed through a
NaK scrubber befere it reaches
the system. These changes in
the system are being incorporated
at the present time. Jt 1s
hoped that the system may be
started up again by the middle
of December,

Heat Transfer in a Circualating rFuel
System (H. F. Poppendiek and .. Palmer,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division)., Mathematical solutions
have been derived for temperature
structure in the case of forced-
convection heat transfer (laminar and
turbulent flow) in long smooth pipes
containing fluids with uniform-volume
heat sources; heat i1s transferred to
or from the fluids at the pipe wall.
Some specific evaluations of the
radial temperature distributions for
the case of no heat transfer to or
from the fluid at the pipe wall have
been made for laminar and turbulent
flow. Diwmensionless temperature
profiles for the case of turbulent
flow are presented in terms of Reynolds
modulus, Prandtl modulus, the volume
heat source, and the boundary hesat
transfer.

of solids 1s 90% complete and will be

apparatus can be used in a vacuum or

original(®) apparatus.

Thermal Conductivity of Diatomaceous
Silica Powder (D. F. Salmon, ANP
Division). Research on the circu-
lating-fuel—water-moderated reactor
has led to a search for an insulating
material for the fuel containers. Thais
insulation would allow the water to be
maintained at a considerably lower
temperature than the fuel mixture,
thereby simplifying many of the
problems associated with high-tempera-
ture high-pressure systems, Diato-
maceous silica powder seemed feasible;
hence tests were made to determine
thermal conductivity and sintering
effect at reactor temperatures under
atmospheric and reduced pressures.
The material used was a Johns-Manville
product, Celite.

The apparatus consisted of two
annuli formed by concentric tubes
around a standard 750-watt 115-v
tubular heating element. The annulus
next to the heater element contained
diatomaceous silica while the outer
annulus was a water passage, Experi-
mental parameters included heater
power, sheath temperature, density to
which insulation was packed, water
flow rate, and water inlet and outlet
temperatures.

Progress Report for Period Ending March 10, 1951,

The first series of tests was made
at atmospherzc pressure. The heater
element sheath temperature was main-
tained at 1500°F for 75 hr at 1675°F
for 100 hr, and at 1800°F for 100 hr.
During this entire series the tempera-
ture rise of the water never exceeded
10°F., Figure 12.3 shows the variation
in thermal conductivity with tempera-
ture both from the literature values(®)
and from the experimental ones. In-
spection at the conclusion of these
tests showed that a thin layer of the
powder next to the heater element had
darkened considerably, probably as a
result of oxidation of the inconel
sheath., Apparently no significant
change in physical properties had
occurred, since the thermal con-
ductivity remained consistent through-
out the tests.

A second series of tests was begun
in which the powder annulus was evacu-
ated to determine the effect of the
presence of air on thermal conductivity
and sintering. The insulation annulus
was loaded to a packing densaity of
15.7 1b/ft? and evacuated to approxi-
mately 0.17 wm Hg. Other experimental
conditions were unchanged.

At a heater sheath temperature of
1800°F, an apparent conductivity of
0.025 Btu/hrft*°F was calculated,
representing a reduction of some 60%
over that at atmospheric pressure.
After 24 hr of operation, however, the
conductivity began to increase as
evidenced by a decrease in sheath
temperature, while the power on the
heater element remained essentially
constant; however, insufficient time
had elapsed to establish the extent of
this increase. Examination of the
powder after testing indicated that
a layer approximately 1/16 in. thick
around the heater had sintered and
darkened appreciably in color.

Zahn Type Viscometer (M. Tobias,

been designed to give rapid, approxi-
mate values for fuel and coolant-salt
mixtures. The viscometer will consist
of a stainless steel cup, at the base
of which 1s a hole 1 in. long and 1 mm
in diameter. The cup will be dipped
into the melt whose viscosity 1s
desired. The melt container will then
be dropped away from the cup and the
time of efflux of 5 cm?® of molten
material from the cup will be measured.
Since the apparatus will be inside a
furnace, the discharge time will be
obtained by weighing the cup erther
continuously with a dial-indicating
balance or by noting when the weight
of the cup plus its contents falls
below a predetermined amount., To
minimize corrosion, the apparatus will
be operated inan inert gas atmosphere.
The device will be calibrated using

Viscosity of Fluoride Mixtures
(F. A. Knox and F. Kertesz, Materials
Chemistry Division). Preliminary
viscosity determinations of the
various fluoride mixtures were con-
tinued. Although trials were made
with a Saybolt type apparatus, 1t was
found desirable to continue the use of
a modified Brookfield Synchro-Lectric
viscometer. In order to eliminate at
least some of the disadvantages of the
earlier techniques, the furnace was
enclosed in a metallic shell, covered
with a gas-tight cover which contained
the measuring instrument, a glass-
covered viewing hole, and an opening
for a rubber glove to permit certain
manipulations while the experiment
was in progress. The enclosed unit
was under slight argon pressure. In
this way oxidation of the material
during measurements should be reduced
very considerably, Details of the
apparatus can be seen in Fig. 12.4.

The need for such an essentially
gas-tight apparatus was apparent from
the results obtained with beryllium-
bearing fluoride mixtures. In a
poorly sealed system the mixture be-
came cloudy while the measurements
were 1n progress, indicating the
formation of insoluble beryllium oxide.
The viscosity values at a given temper-
ature continued to increase as repeated
measurements were made, resembling the
behavior of a suspension with rheopectic

126

properties rather than a Newtonian
liguid.

In order to establish the effect of
the uranium concentration on the
viscosity, the viscosity was determined
for fluoride salt mixtures contalning
various amounts of uranium fluoride.
The latest values for the viscosity of
the NaF-KF-LiF ternary eutectic range
around 3 centipoises at 800°C. Results
with 2 and 15 wt % UF, in the eutectic
show that these mixtures have es-
sentially the same viscosity as the
uranium-free composition.,

METALLURGY AND CERAMICS

Manly, Metallurgy Division

T. N. McVay, Consultant

Solid-fuel-element fabrication has
been studied in order that the effect
of several variables on the metal-
lurgical bond between the fuel-bearing
core and the protective cladding and
the distribution of the UO, in the
metallic carrier in the core may be
understood. Previous reports have
outlined this effect by such variables
as percentage hot reduction, per-
centage UO, present, composition of
cladding, particle size of the metallic
carrier 1n the core, and degrees of
cold-working of the flat plate after
rolling. In this report the following
variables have beemn investigated:
effect of UO, particle size range,
effect of rolling tempesraturs, and
elimination of the capsule used during
hot-rolling.

Preliminary experiments have shown
that fuel-plate lawminates may be spot-
welded together. Fuel-tube bundles
can be held together by spot-welding
bundle straps to the individual tubes.
A study of high-temperature brazing
indicates Nicrobraz to be guite useful
in joining two fuel-plate laminates
without floating the U0, to the sur-
face and for joining a fuel plate to a
stainless steel sheet in a T joint.
A new brazing alloy containing 60% Pd
and 40% Ni has been found which has a
favorable nuclear cross-sectionaswell
as good high-temperature brazing
properties.

The creep and stress-rupture labo-
ratory for the testing of materials 1in
an inert gas atmosphere has been
completed. Results are presented which
show the effect of grain size on the
creep strength of inconel and of heat
treatment on the creep strength of

Of the three basic approaches to
preparing a solid-fuel element out-
lined in earlier veports (see p. 1v
for list), the e¢mz upen which primary
emphasis has been placed to date makes
use of picture frames and cladding
plates, The objectives of these in-
vestigations are twaofold: (1) to
abtain a metallurgical bond between
a fuel-bzaring core and protective
cladding, and (2) to create a distri-
bution of the solid fuel 1n 2 metallic
carrier which will give acceptable
heat-transfer conditions. The results
of completed experiments indicate that
flat or curved fuel plates can be
fabricated with 300 series stainless
steel cladding on a UD, ceramel core,

Although the feasibility of tube-

demonstrated by these experiments,
results were somewhat inconsistent.
Apparatus has been completed which
incorporates a Selsyn stator as part
of the magnetic inert-arc welding
torch nozzle as described in a previous
report.¢?? Jt is felt that the proper
control of the additional welding
variables introduced by this method
will improve the consistency of
results.

An investigation of the effect of
these parameters on the type and
quality of welded tube-to-header
joints will be conducted concurrently
with fabrication of full-sized tube-

the Experimental Engineering Group.

have been conducted using available
equipment which has demonstrated the
feasibilaty of joining tube bundle
straps to fuel tubes by spot welding.

elements together. The fuel elements
consisted of a mixture of UD, and 302

BRAZING TECHNIQUES

P. Patriarca and G. M. Slaughter
Metallunrgy Division

An introductory study has been
directed to the subject of furnmace
brazing under a controlled hydrogen
atmosphere. The use of a commercial
high-temperature brazing alloy
(Nicrobraz) has been investigated, and
the effects of some of the brazing
From the
it appears that Nicro-
brazing 1s an entirely feasible
technique of fabricating reactor
components. However, since Nicrobraz
contains on the order of 4% boron, the
use of this brazing alloy for fabri-
cation of reactor components 1is some-
~what limited. Tests performed using
a modified Nicrobraz in which beryllium
- was substithted for boron have shown
- little promise. The wetting properties
of this modified alloy were poor.
Further research i1s necessary to
completely evaluate thls approach to
the problem.

~ variables have been studied.
work to date,

Effect of Brazimg Time. The in-
fluence of brazing time on Nicrobraz
" joints made in type 316 stainless
steel can be seen in Fig. 13.7. The
- joint held for 5 min at the brazing
temperature shows somewhat less
diffusion of the brazing alloy 2nto
the base metal than that held at the

brazing temperature for 30 min, indi-
cating that time at temperature is not
critical within these limits. A

similar Nicrobrazed joint on 304

stainless steel was struck by a sharp
hammer blow at 1500°F. The high-
temperature ductlllty of the joint
was excellent.

Brazing of Ctad Fuel Elements. A
preliminary investigation has been
conducted on the brazing of clad fuel
elements., From the rather limited
amount of work that has been done on
this subject, 1t seems. entirely
feasible that these elements can be
brazed either to a stainless steel
sheet or to anether clad fuel element,
Figure 13.8 shows a clad fuel element
Nlcrobrazed toa stainless steel sheet.
As can be seen, the brazing alloy wets
the stainless steel very well and
apparently has little tendency to
float any of the fuel powders to the
surface. A Nicrobrazed edge-to-edge
joint of two clad fuel elements was
formed, and, although stainless steel
in this case 1s also wet very well by
the brazing alloy, the powder appeared
to be recessed in each sheet, This
probably resulted from the preliminary
grinding operation, since no brazing
alloy was observed in the recessed
area and the powder did not appear to
be contaminated by the brazing alloy.

Nickel-Palladium Brazing Alloy. In
another attempt to find a brazing alloy
with a more favorable nuclear ecross-
section, consideration has been given
to the nickel-palladium system with
minor additions of silicon for melting
point control. Figure 13.9 is a
photomicrograph of an inconel tube-to-
header joint using 40% nickel —60%
palladium alloy brazed at 1270°C in
dry hydrogen for 20 min. As can be
seen, the flow characteristics and
wetting properties are apparently
good. Room temperature tube-to-header
tensile strengths were of the order of
80,000 psi. Further consideration will
be given this alloy system pending
results of corrosion tests being con-
ducted in molten coolants and fuels,

Operation of Creep and Stress-

placed in operation without having
been properly instrumented in order
to train technicians and to avoid the
delay associated with the development
of an extension-measuring system,
During the past quarter it was neces-
sary to revise the existing measuring
system as 1t showed the creep of the

The extension is now measured by
attaching a scribed platinum strip
extensometer across the gage length of
the speeimen. Marks are selected on
the center strip, and either of the
side strips and the distances between
the pairs of marks are measured with a
micrometer microscope having a least
scale division of 0.00005 in. The

Two tubes of type 316 stainless
stee]l lasted 1000 hr in 1500°F sodium
with hoop stresses of 1900 and 2600
psi, respectively.  Examination
revealed little or ne stress cor-
rosion or attack on either specimen.
On the other hand, two inconel samples
stressed at approximately 1500 psi
failed 1n less than 1000 hr, these
failures apparently resulting from
intergranular attack inside the tube
rather than from exterior sodium
attack. An inconel sample was later
prepared from a new lot of seamless
tubing and stressed to 1200 psi in
sodium; it failed in 465 hr through a
small area which seemed to be high in
impurities. Again, the rupture was
due to interior attack although
exterior attack up to 0.003 in., deep
was noted.

As a supplement to the above tests
a program for determining stress-
rupture values by applying a dead load
to flat thin (0.020-1in.) plates of
test materials immersed in sodium is
being carried out, Approximate values
obtained for inconel stressed at
13,000 and 10,000 psi and for type 316
stainless steel stressed at 7000 pSi
indicate that sodium at 1500°F has no
marked effect.

Studies have continued on the
effects of radiation on the physical
and chemical stability of the con-
stituents of the airplane reactor.
Considerable data have been obtained
from experiments in the X-10 graphite
pile, and emphasis has shifted to
preliminary experiments in the higher
flux LITR facility. 1In all phases of
the work preparations are being made
for further experimentation in the
LITR and tests in the MTR. Additional
radiation damage experiments have been
carried out with the Y-12 and Berkeley
cyclotrons.

The work has been concerned to a
large extent with the stability of the
fused fluoride salt mixture (NaF-KF-UF,,
46.5-26-27.5 mole %) proposed as fuel
for the sodium-cooled reactor. In the
X pile a series of runs was made in
which approximately 65 watts was
dissipated for 450 hr in each cubic
centimeter of U?3%_enriched fuel, With
the Y-12 cyclotron energy dissipations
up to 415 watts/cm® for 1 hr were
achieved with 20-Mev protons. In both
cases no evidence of radiation damage
was observed. Some radiation damage
appeared to take place in the single
preliminary experiment wade in the
LITR at about 1000 watts for 115 hr,
but a more exacting control run and
additional experiments are necessary
before a conclusion can be reached 1in
the matter.

The low uranium content of the
fused fluorides proposed for use 1n
the circulating-fuel reactor would
reduce the power production during
pile irradiation by a factor of 15 or
20. In this case only in the MTR and
cyclotron can power dissipations of
aircraft reactor intensity, about

sections of this report, Complete

IRRADIATION OF FUSED MATERIALS

G. W. Keilholtz, Materials

Chemistry Division

The effects of radiation on the
stability of the fused fluorides and on
fused KOH have been under investigation
using the X pile, the Y-12 cyclotron,
and the LITR. In experiments with fused
fluorides in inconel at 1470 to 1500°F
no evidence of radiation damage was
found in the X-pile or cyclotron run.
Some evidence of what appears to be
radiation damage was found in the
single preliminary LITR experiment,
which still requires control and check
runs, Data from the single experiment
on escape of xenon from the melt was
inconclusive, Pressure build-up
measurements on capsules of fused KOH
in the X pile and LITR indicated no
instability to radiation,

capsules (J. G. Morgan, H. E. Robertson,
C. C. Webster, P. R. Klein, and B.
Kinyon, Physics of Solids Tnstitute).
For reasons of safety, capsules con-
taining the fused materials were first
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

checked in the pile for pressure
evolution at low fluxes, and then at
higher fluxes. The capsules were
pressurized with helium and the
pressures were continuously measured
by means of a strain gage to an
accuracy of #0.5 psi. The standard
NaF-KF-UF, fuel and KOH were tested as
shown in Table 14.1 with no evidence
of pressure increases due to irradi-
ation.

When pressure tests on the fused
fluoride mixture were completed in the
X pile, 0.5 g samples of the material
enriched in U??® were subjected to a
thermal flux of 10'? at 1472°F wall
temperature in sealed inconel capsules.
After several preliminary tests, five
capsules of 0.223 1.d. were irradiated
for 300 to 450 hr at 1472°F and one at
pile ambient temperature., Chemical
and metallographic analyses, which are
mostly completed, have showed no in-
crease of iron, chromium, or nickel in
the fuel, decomposition of the fuel,
or observable effect on the inconel as
compared to bench tests. The capsule
in Table 14.1, which was used in the
LITR pressure test, with a power
dissipation of about 1000 watts/cm?,
showed increased damage in all three

respects. However, a control sample
prepared simultanecusly is yet to be

bench-tested and examined.

In order to determine 1f xenon is
evolved from the fluoride melt under
irradiation, the following experiment
was conducted. A sample of enriched
urenium metal was placed in a flux of
10'? neutrons/cm® and irradiated for
the same length of time as a sealed
microcapsule of melted salt. Both
were removed and the microcapsule was
opened., When they were counted, no
significant difference between the
twe was noted, which seemed to indi-
cate that the xenon formed did not
escape from the melt. This test is
not considered conclusive and a more
significant experiment is planned.

low beam currents were usually radi-

with high currents were attached to a

water-cooled pins there was probably a

SUMMARY AND

The survey of the supercritical-
water reactor by the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory’s subcontractor Nuclear
Develepments Associates, Inc., is
essentially complete and has confirmed
the feasibility of aircraft nuclear
propulsion using that reactor. Although
ORNL will not further pursue this
reactor cycle because of the prevailing
belief in the greater potentialities
of low-pressure liguid-coolant re-
actors, NDA will continue its work,
together with Pratt and Whitney, under
direct AEC contract. The new results
in the NDA survey of the cycle for
ORNL are outlined in Sec. 15, together
with a brief cycle analysis that was
undertaken at ORNL.

Alarge analytical chemistry program
is required to support the materials
research program now being undertaken
by the ANP project. This includes not
only routine service analysis ~~ 688
individual samples were analyzed during
the past quarter = but 1n many cases
the development of new analytical
procedures. This development, as
reported in Sec. 16, is largely con-
cerned with the determination of
oxygen in gases and fused mixtures and
similar studies of hydroxides and
fluorides. '

INTRODUCTION

The "List of Reports Issued,” Sec.
17, includes seven laboratory reports
and 39 informal documents on ‘all
phases of the ANP project.

A directory of the research preojects
of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion
Project of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory is given in Sec. 18. The
research projects of the Laboratory’s
subcontractors to its ANP project are
iisted, as well as the research now
in progress at the lLaboratory. In
additzon, such research as is being
performed by OBNL for the ANP programs
of other organizations 1is included
and marked as such.

A chart of the technical organi-
zation of the Aircraft Nuclear Propul-
sion Project at OBNL is included
(Sec. 19) to identify the personnel
and emphasis associated with the
various phases of the project. There
are now about 2ZB5 scientific and
technical people employed on the
project and about 26 active consultants,
Although contractural changes at the
start of this fiscal year shifted
several former Laboratory subcontrac-
tors to the AEC, there are, in all,
seven allied laboratories performing
research for the ANP project, where
ORNL has either the direct contract
or technical supervision.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

15.

For the past year (see p, 1v for
list of previous reports) Nuclear
Development Associates have been
studying the supercritical-water
reactor first proposed in Wash-24.,(1)
A first survey analysis by NDA 1s
essentially complete and a final
report is being written. This report,
when 1ssued, will complete the sub-
contract work by NDA for OBNL on the
supercritical-water reactor. NDA will,
however, continue i1ts work in this
field under subcontract with Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft Division,

In addition to the above-mentioned
survey of the supercritical-water
reactor, an analysis of the cycle was
undertaken at OBRNL. This analysis,
which will also soon be 1ssued as a

separate report, is summarized below.

ANALYSIS OF
WATER

SUPERCRITICAL
REACTOR BY NDA

The only new results since the last
quarterly report pertaining to the
supercritical-water reactor system are
in the control aspects. The reactor
has been shown to be stable for small
oscillations, and a start-up technique
has been outlined in which the control
mechanism is derived from change of
water density in the reactor.

Stability. A calculation has been
carried out¢?) on the stability of
the design point reactor (400,000 kw,
2.5-ft square cylinder core, flux flat
radially) connected between constant-
pressure reservoirs, The system was
studied with equilibrium xenon con-
centration, Under the assumptions
made, the stabilizing density effects

on reactivity were found to compensate
the unstabilizing effect of the xenon;
the reactor i1s stable for swmall
oscillations., The longest two decay
periods were calculated as 5.9 min and
22 sec.

The response to a sudden step-
function i1ncrease in reactivity 1is
such as to cause the power level to
overshoot 1ts equilibrium increase by
a factor of 10. When the reactivity
is raised linearly during an interval
of 2 sec, the overshoot is by a factor
of 2; when 10 sec is taken to accomplish
the linear reactivity increase, there
is no overshoot.

Start-up. The start-up problem has
been considered in a preliminary way
with the reactor connected to a simple
heat-exchanger external systemand with
no control mechanism other than that
afforded by changes of water density
in the machine.

The envisaged start-up procedure 1is
as follows: (1) Fill the system with
high-temperature high-pressure water
whose density i1s too low to make the
machine reactive; (2) keeping the
system at constant pressure, clrculate
and slowly cool the water; the cooling
rate is adjusted(3®) so as to bring the
reactor power safely up to some
fraction (say, 3%) of rated output,
the circulation rate being large enough
so that the water density is still
substantially uniform throughout the
reactor; (3) adjust the cooling rate
so as to hold the reactor power con-
stant at this 3% level, and slowly
reduce the circulation rates through
the moderator chamber and fuel tubes,
while the density variation along the
fuel tubes builds up to the normal
operating pattern,

Questions concerning the external
equipment called for and how and when
the reactor can be switched to connect
to the power plant system have not
been 1nvestigated.

ANALYSIS OF SUPERCRITICAL-WATER
REACTOR BY ORNL

One of the most widely advocated
methods ofutilizing the supercritical-
water reactor for aircraft nuclear
propulsion is to use the compressor-
jet propulsion cycle. A brief study
of this fundamental cycle to discover
the relations existing among the
various parameters involved 1s de-
scribed,

Compressor-Jet Cycle. In this
cycle energy is added to the airstream
in a low compression ratio blower and
then in a radiator. The supercritical
steam from the reactor expands through
a turbine which operates the air
blower and the water-return pump. The
turbine exhaust steam is then con-
densed, and 1t transfers its heat of
vaporization to the airstream flowing
through the radiator.

The particular parameters that
have been considered - condenser air-
inlet face area, condenser weight, and
were evaluated per
terms of the
temperature and pressure:of the steam
leaving the reactor and the condenser

airflow rate -—
pound of thrust 1in

pressure. This was accomplished for
flight at 45,000 ft altitude at Mach
numbers of 0.9 and 1.5.

Reasonable values were assumed for
component efficiencies and actual test
data used for the condenser perfor-
mance. The results should give
attainable performance of the funda-
mental cycle at the two design points
investigated. Somewhat better per-
formance can probably be obtained
through a program of optimization of
the cycle and equipment., However, the
data presented here should give per-

formance not far from the optimum, and
hence should be useful for preliminary
design studies of the system.

Results. The results of this in-
vestigation indicate that for reactor
outlet steam conditions ranging from
1000 to 1500°F and pressures from
5000 to 10,000 psi, the following

statements can be made:

1. The specific impulse is low 1in
all cases (from 15 to 20 1b per
pound of air per second at a
flight Mach No. of 0.9 and from
9 to 14 1b per pound of air per
second at a flight Mach No. of
1.5).

2. Increasing the reactor ocutlet
steam temperature or pressure or
condenser pressure effects some
improvement in all cases and in
all parameters considered, 1.e.,
specific impulse, specific heat
consumption, and specific
radiator weight and frontal
area.

3. Increasing steam condenser

pressures above 400 psi1 gives

relatively littlé improvement
in performance.

reactor steam
from 5000 to
relatively

4. Increasing the
outlet pressures

10,000 ps1 gives
litctle improvement in perfor-
mance.

5. Cycle performance is insensitive

to the relative amounts of energy
put into the air by the turbine-
compressor and by the condenser.

In general, the obvious advantages
of this cycle are the use of water, a
familiar and fairly noncorrosive
substance, for both coolant and
moderator., The disadvantages include
an inherently low specific impulse and
the necessity of developing an entirely
new type of aircraft engine.

ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY

C. D. Susano, Analytical Chemistry Division

Since the use of diatomaceous earth
as an insulating agent in the aircraft
reactor is being contemplated, studies
are presently being made of the compo-
sition of these materials with partic-
ular attention to elements of high
neutron-capture cross-section, of which
boron and the rare earths are the most
important. Preliminary results on two
samples of diatomaceous earth indicate
that these materials may contain
several hundred parts per million of
boron, which i1s higher than can be
tolerated.

It has been mecessary to develop or
adapt methods for the determination of
metallic nickel, nickel oxide (Ni0),
and available oxygen in alkali hydrox-
ide melts in connection with tests in
which these hydroxides are circulated
through nickel loops at 1400°F. These
methods appear to be satisfactory with
the exception that, if the nickel
occurs 1n a massive crystalline form,
difficulty is encountered in separating
it completely from the oxide.

As a part of the corrosion test
program for the evaluation of fluoride
eutectic coolants, methods are under
study for the determination of iron,
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and
copper in these materials. Methods for
the precise determination of the major
constituents are also under consider-
ation. A study of the pH values of
aqueous solutions of one of the alkali
fluoride cutectics and its components
is reported.

Tests were made to determine whether
or not alkali and alkaline earth
hydroxide melts could be removed from
metal tubes by dissolution in water
without appreciable corrosion of the
container material during the disso-
lution step. Monel, inconel, nickel,

152

and stainless steels 316 and 347 were
attacked to only a negligible degree
and copper was corroded only slightly
more.

The development of two methods for
the determination of uranium trifluo-
ride has been completed. It appears
that the method involving measurement
of the hydrogen evolved on reaction of
of the UF, with acid is more precise
than the method which depends upon the
total oxidizing power of the sample.
Although some additional work remains
to be done, 1t appears that oxygen can
be determined in sodium-potassium alloy
(NaK)} by a modification of the n-butyl
bromide method for the determination
of oxygen in sodium.

A survey of the results obtained 1in
the determination of oxygen in tanks
of Burcanof Mines helium 1s presented.
Approximately 85% of the cylinders
tested contained less than 25 ppm of
oxygen and were, therefore, acceptable
for use by the ANP Experimental
Engineering Group.

Tests are being made for the purpose
of producaing a borated water solution
(1% boron) at minimum cost which will
retain 1ts clarity 1n contact with
concrete, 1nconel, and 1iron.

Summaries of the service analysis
work, which indicate the distribution
with respect to sample type and groups
originating the samples, are presented.

STUDIES OF DIATOMACEOUS EARTH

J. C. White and W. J. Ross
Analytical Chemistry Division

The use of diatomaceocus earth as
an insulating agent in the aircraft
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

reactor 1s contemplated, and studies
are being made of the composition of
these materials with particular atten-
tion to elements of high cross-section
for thermal-neutron capture, chiefly
boron and the rare earths.

Diatomaceous earth, which consists
almost entirely of the siliceous
skeletons of minute marine animals,
is composed essentially of 5i0, but
may vary significantly in minor and
trace constituents. An effort is being
made to find an infusorial earth of
suitably low boron content (less than
10 ppm). '

Spectrographic analysis of two
types has been completed todate: one,
a type used primarily as a paint
pigment, showed 600 ppm of boron and
no detectable rare earths; the second,
a "fresh-water™ earth with the trade
name "Sil-o-cel,” showed 300 ppm of
boron and ne detectable rare earths.
Since these concentrations are higher
than can be tolerated, the possibility
of reducing the boron content of these
materials by washing with hydrochloric
acid and other solutions is under
investigation.

A new method for the determination
of boron is under study.(!’ This
method depends upon the color complex
between boron and 1,1°-dianthrimide
which is formed in sulfuric acid 1n
aqueous medium. Preliminary tests
indicate that the method is extremely
sensitive (0.0l ug of boron per milli-
liter).

DETERMINATION OF Ni, NiO, AND O
IN ALKALI HYDROXIDES
J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

A series of tests has been conducted
in which lithium, sodium, and potassium

1’-Dianthrimide,” Anal. Chem. 21, 1345 (1949).

hydroxides were circulated through
nickel loops at 1400°F. The loops
were operated for various periods,
ranging from 51 hr for KOH to roughly
300 hr for LiOH, before the runs were
terminated because of the formation of
plugs. The loops were X-rayed in order
to determine the locationof the plugs,
cut in sections, and submitted for both
chemical and metallographic exami-~
nation. Some development effort was
necessary to arrive at suitable methods
for the determinationof nickel, nickel
oxide, and available oxygen in these
plugs.

Available Oxygen. A method similar
to that employed for the determination
of available oxygen in lead peroxide
is used in this case. The amount of
iodine liberated from an acidic iodide
solution is titrated with standard
sodium thiosulfate. 1In only one case
was an appreciable amount of available
oxygen found in the samples submitted.

Metallic Nickel. Since the plugs
were formed from large, lustrous nickel
dendrites, metallic nickel was deter-
mined directly. Samples from other
sections of the loops were characterized
by the presence of much more finely
divided nickel, and i1n these cases the
displacement technique was applicable.
This method depends upon the displace-
ment from solution of a metal lower
than nickel in the electromotive
series. The excess of the added 5%
copper sulfate reagent can be deter-
mined and is a measure of the amount
of metallic nickel originally present.

Nickel Oxide. Work is underway to
separate nickel and nickel oxide when
the metal exists largely in a massive
crystalline form. The use of i1odine
to convert the metal to Nil, will be
investigated. In samples 1in which the
nickel 1s more finely divided, the
oxide is separated out by filtering
the inscluble nickel oxide and copper
metal from the solution used for the

153
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

determination of nickel by the dis-
pl acement method. The residue is
digested with acid, and the nickel 1is
determined by the dimethylglyoxime
precipitation.

Studies of the higher oxides of
nickel are being made in an attempt
to gain an understanding of the
reactions which are taking place 1n
the molten hydroxides under the
conditions of these tests.

STUDIES OF TERNARY ALKALI FLUORIDE
EUTECTIC

J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

A proposed coolant for the ARE
reactor is the ternary alkali fluoride
eutectic composed of 11.7% sodium
fluoride, 59.1% potassium fluoride,
and 29.2% lithium fluoride by weight.
This eutectic melts at 450°C. VWork
on this eutectic is confined at present
to study of the pH of aqueous solutions
of the eutectic and its components,
of the composition of the eutectic,
and analysis of the eutectic for
metallic impurities.

Fluorides. The alkali fluorides will
hydrolize completely at temperatures

around 1000°C but not significantly
at room temperature. Hence, a deter-
mination of the pH of an agueous
solution of the cooled fused salt at
room temperature will indicate the
degree of hydrolysis which has taken
place at the high temperature required
for fusion (pyrohydrolysis) and is a
me asure of the moisture present at
these temperatures. Table 16.1 shows
typical values for the higher pH of
the fused salts as compared to com-~
parable concentrations of unheated
c.p. reagent grade salts. The following
comments may be made:

1. The increase inbasicity on fusion
is very likely a consequence of
pyrohydrolysis, the water being
already present in the salt.
Potassium hydroxide, despite its
hygroscopic natuvre, appeared
more stable to pyrohydrolysais
than the other alkali metal
fluorides. Agueous solutions
of this fluoride are more basic,
however, than solutions of
either sodium or lithium fluoride.

2. The alkali fluorides may be
classified as salts of strong
bases and fairly weak acids (the
ionization constant of hydroflu-
ric acid is 7.7 x 10°*), so that
aqueous solutions of these salts
should be slightly basic. How-
ever, aqueous lithium fluoride
tested acidic and sodium fluo-
ride nearly neutral. This 1s
believed due to the presence of
some free hydrofluoric acid or
acid fluoride salt in the reagent.

3. pH is relatively independent of
concentration except possibly in
the case of unfused anhydrous
potassium fluoride, the reason
for this 1s under current investi-
gation.

The pH of a saturated solution of
the eutectic, determined from three
FOR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1951

lots prepared in various container
materials, was 9.8, roughly that of a
solution of fused potassium fluoride.
A fourth lot, prepared using hydrated
potassium salt dried overnight under
vacuum, had a pH of 6.9, which is
nearly neutral. Evidently some
basicity may be removed by this drying
process. '

Composition of the Eutectic. Pre-
liminary studies have been made to
compare gravimetric and flame-photo-
metric methods for the determination
of i1ndividual alkali metals in the
eutectic. It appears that flame-
photometric methods will not be suffi-
ciently accurate but that total alkali
and total fluoride determinations will
provide all the information required.
Total alkali can be determined gravi-
metrically and total flunoride will be
determined by pyrohydrolysis.

Metallic Impurities. As a part of
the corrosion test program, the trace
impurities iron, nickel, chromium,
molybdenum, and copper will be deter-
mined in the eutectic. Colorimetrac
methods are being developed for this
purpose.

CORROSION OF METAL CONTAINERS BRY
HYDROXIDE SOLUTIONS

J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

The present method for removing
alkali and alkaline earth metal
hydroxides from metal containers in
preparation for the determination of
metal constituents involves dissolution
of the hydroxide melt with water. This
procedure exposes the container to a
warm, saturated hydroxide solution
for as long as 2 to 3 hr in some cases;
hence, a study was made to determine the
extent of corrosion of the container
metal from this source. Results
indicated that this procedure has

little effect, and that the present
method 1s suitable for all containers
with the possible exception of copper.

DETERMINATION OF URANIUM TRIFLUORIDE

W. K. Miller and D. L. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

In a previous report{?’ two methods
for the determination of uranium tri-
fluoride were described. It was
reported that the ceric sulfatemethod
appeared more promising than the
hydrogen evolution method, although it
was believed that the precision of the
latter could be improved by reducing
the volume of the apparatus. This
modification has resulted in a marked
improvement in the results by the
hydrogen evolution method, which 1is
now considered more precise. Although
no standard sample 1s available for
a direct test of the two methods, the
agreement between the methods indicated
that sither can be satisfactorily used
to determine trivalent uranium.

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN Nak

J. C. White and W. J. Hoss
Analytical Chemistry Division

Efforts are currently being directed
toward the application of the n-butyl
bromide method(?? for the determination
¢f oxvygen in sodium to the determi-
nation of oxygen in sodium-potassium

significance in this particular study
are: (1) It is a free-flowing liquid
above 15°C, (2) it has a rather high
coefficient of expansion upon freezing,
and (3) it is extremely reactive
toward oxygen. Owing to the high
reactivity of NaK with n-butyl bromide,
the reagent must be added in small
increments rather thanmn in one single
portion. The reaction 1s complete
within 1 hr for 1- to 2-g samples of
NaK.

The results obtained on test samples
have shown somewhat higher oxygen
content (about 0.25%) than has usually
been the case for sodium samples.

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN HELIUHX

J. C. White and W. J. BRoss
Analytical Chemistry Division

Data for the determination of
oxygen 1in helium by the Brady method
have shown that about 85% of the United
States Bureau of Mines cylinders
tested have oxygen contents below
25 ppm, and hence, according to the
present standards, are acceptable for
use. No attempt was made to determine
the average oxygen content, as this
method 1s unreliable for concentrations
greater than 50 ppm.

Because of 1ts wider working range,
a modification of the Winkler method,
as modified by Pepkowitz,¢*’ has been
considered as a substitute for the
Brady method. It has been i1mpossible
to determine the precision of this
method since acceptable low- or zero-
oxygen standards have not been obtained.

PREPARATION OF OXYGEN-FREE
SODIUM SAMPLES

H. R. Bronstein, ANP Division

Widely varying results on sodium
samples taken from operating systems

156

pointed out the unreliability of
analytical methods for determining
quantitatively the oxygen in sodium.
Unreliability was felt to be largely
due to lack of suitable standards by
which analytical methods could be
evaluated. Consequently, a search was
begun to find suitable methods for
producing samples containing a known
amount of oxygen.

A literature search revealed a
method believed suitable for producing
standard samples. DBriefly, the method
consists in 1mmersing a highly evacuated
glass bulb containing a filament in a
bath of molten sodium nitrate. An
electrode (anode) is also immersed in
the bath external to the evacuated
bulb. The filament i1s heated by a
220-v alternating current; at the same
time, a 220-v direct current is placed
on the filament and anode. Sodium ions
are pulled out of the glass, neutralized
by electrons from the filament, and
replaced in the glass by sodium 1ons
from the bath. This method allows
pure sodium to be plated out on the
inner side of the bulb.
deposited may be determined by either
weighing the bulb before and after
electrolysis or calculated by Faraday’s
law of electrolysis. Standard samples
may be produced by adding known
amounts of oxygen to known amounts of
sodium by high-vacuum techniques.

Amounts

During the guarter equipment was
assembled, and preliminary experiments
were conducted to evaluate the equip-
ment and method. Both appear to be
adequate, and sufficient experience
has been gained to proceed with
preparing actual samples.(®’

CLARITY OF BORATED WATER IN
CONCRETE TANKS(6)

H. P. House
Analytical Chemistry Division

It has been proposed that the con-
taining concrete tank of the ARE be
filled with borated water (at least
1% boron by weight) after shutdown,
while subsequent disassembly operations
are performed remotely. Hence, several
solutions of boron salts have been
tested for prolonged clarity while in
contact with concrete. Saturated
borax solution met the requirement for
clarity, but contained only 0.8% boron
by weight. Potassium tetraborate met
both requirements, but its higher cost
discourages its use. Mixtures cf the
two salts in agueous solution form a
precipitate on contact with concrete.
Final studies are being made te
determine the optimum borated solution.
