MOLTEN SALT REACT(B DESCRIPTION

The Afrcraft Resctor Experiment, in vhich MaF-ZrF PR, fuel circulated
through inconel tubing in BeO moderator , demenstrated. ’bhe basie feasibllity of a

- high temperature molten salt reactor. Detailed calculetions for & power reactor

I-i7F--l6 mole % BeFp=-13 mole % ThF) as a blanket £81t2. The reactor design used
as reference in this paper has a uranium (U233 or 0235) inventory of 600-1000 kg
(verying with time) with en 8-ft-dis care snd & total fuel volume of 530 £t3 (334 f£t3
external to the core) The core salt weight is approximately 75 ,000 1b, the blanket
150,000 1b. | -

In the reference rea.ctor et 1east 90% of the power is produced. in the core, yield-
ing about 180 kg of fission products per year. After operation for one year without

~ processing (exce t inert gas removal), the fission products ebsorb sbout 3.8% of all

neutrons and UP3° and 1233 absorb sbout’ 3. 9%, If the reactor fuel is processed for
fission product removal et the rate of one -fuel volume Eer %r » 05 years, the
fission products would ebsorb 2. % of the neutrons; 23 uge 3% yould ab-
sorb 10.4% (mostly 1P: 36); ; end Np 37T about-0.9%. Without fuel processing neutron
absorption by fission products would continue. to increase elmost linearly with time,
exceeding 10% after 10 years; Np237 would build up at an accelerating rate, absorbing -

about 3% of -the neutrons after 10 yea.rs ; the amount of fissionable materisl required

to keep the reactor criticsl would. increa.se 'by a.‘bout 200 kg/yea.r 3 and the conversion

sub,jeét to'removal from the reacter es rare gases; these would contribute 26%

~of the fission product pdisoning for 100 ev neutrons. About 26 atom % of the

long-lived fission products are rare earths, which contribute 40% of the total

fission product poisoning. The rest of the fission products consist of a wide

variety of elements, no one of which is outstan from the nuclesr poisoning
point of view. After reasonably long operation Np 37 is the worst individual
poison other than the rare earths. -

FLU%IDE VOLATILITI PROCESS FOR MSR FUEL

- Fluoride volatilization processing for uranium recovery eppears feasible
for molten salt reactor (MSR) fuel on the basis of lsboratory studies. It is
based on direct fluorination,of the fuel salt to convert UF) to UFg with atten-
dant volatilization and recovery. Similar volatility processes have been pro-
posed and d.gve%oged for zirconium alloy reactor fuel elements after dissolution
in fused salt. One of these, the ORNL Volatility Process, was successfully
used for recovery and decontamination of uranium from the NaF-Zth-UFh salt
fuel of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.’ The MSR volatilization process would
differ, however; from other volatility processes in that complete decontamina~
tion of the product UF. would not be essential, since it could be remotely re-
duced to E’I*"l+ and reconstituted :l.nto reactor salt.

A series of smallsscale fluorinations was carried out with a 48 mole %
LiF--52 mole % BeF, eutectic mixture conta.ining about 0.8 mole % UF),. (MSR
fuel would contsin 0.25 to 1.0 mole % UF, , depending on the operating time. )
The eutectic salt was used instead of the fuel salt In order. to invsstigate
lower temperature operation. In fluorinations at 450, 500, and 550°C, the
rate of uranium removal increased with the -temperature ('l'able 1).

The thorimn-containing 'bla.nket salt cannot be processed for uranium re-
covery at as low a temperature as that used to process the fuel salt.

The uranium concentration in the blanket, however ’ 15 very low; it has been esti-
mated that with continuous processing at the rate of one blanket volume per year,
the blanket salt (IiF-BeF. ~ThF) , T1<16-13 mole %) will contain approximately
0.004 mole % UF, (140 ppm) after one year and 0.01k mole % UF) after 20 years.
Fluorinations o% +wo such mixtures at 600°C for 99 min -gave uranium concentra-

tions in the salt of 1-2 ppm, the lowest urentum concentrations ever obtained
“in fused salt laboratory fluorinstions. Over 90% of the uranium was removed

in 15 min. It is concluded, ‘therefore, that fluorination of uranium from blanket
salt can be accomplished. ,

The behavior -of protactinimn in the ‘bla.nke'b galt during rluorination is of

| interest, although the protactinium is not lost, in any case, since the salt is
returned “to the reactor. A IAF-BeF,-ThF %a 71-16~13 mole %) mixture containing

sufficient irradiated thorium to give # FaR33 concentration of 5.5 x 10-9 g per
gran of salt was fluorinated for 150 min at 600°C, there was no measurable de-
crease in protactinium activity in the salt. Protactinium volatilization in

the process-seems to be unlikely. ~ However, the protactinium concentration in
the blanket of the referenee d.es:lgn reactor is higher (~10 & per gram of salt).

14TF-BeF,, SALT RECOVERY WITH EF

Experimental work has démonstra'hed that the LiF-BeFa salt can be pro=-
cessed by dissolution in aphydrous or nearly anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride.

' Decomtemination of the IiF-BeF, salt from the major neutron poisons, rare earths
~ and neptunium, is schieved due“to the relative insolubility of the fluorides

of these elements In such solutlons. The LiF-BeF2 salt is recoverable from the
HF solution by evaporation.

It _is well krviown that BeF, is very scluble and IiF is rather inéoluble in

‘water in contrast to liquid HF where the reverse is true. In drous HF the

polyvalent element fluorides generally exhibit low solubilities.® Initial con-

sideration of the problem suggested thet use of aqueous HF (greater then 80% HF)
would give sufftcient solubility of both I4F and BeFo to meet process objectives.
The solubllity studies were-therefore carried out over the range of 70-100% HF.

However, in addition to the mixed solvent -effect there existed also the possi-
bility that enhydrous HF would be suiteble as a solvent for the LiF-BeF, salt
.complex in the shalogous,_sense that cryolite y Na.A1F., is quite soluble whereas
is insoluble in HF. 7 Some emphasis was thefefore pleced on using "anhydrous™ -

IAF vas more soluble at higher temperatures if water was present in the solvent,
‘but the effect of temperature on BeFp solubility was not definitely established.
The 14F solubility decreased rapidly as water was added to anhydrous HF, end
the BeFa solubility increased from near zero; the golubllities were roughly the
geme 1n°80 wt % HF, 25 to 30 g/kg. The BeFp was glassy in pature and digsolved
glowly. The solubility values reported for IiF in Taeble 2, except at 12°¢C, were

 obtained after refluxing HF over the salt for 3 hr. No further messurements

were made with I4F or BeF, alone, since the solubilities of the two -components
together were of primary ortence. - _ < T

The solubility of ‘BeF,, was also measured ot verious HF concentrations snd

. temperatures in the presence of IiF. The resulte generally confirmed that the

presence of IiF as well as water increases the BeF, solubility. ‘A plot of
solubility velues at one temperature (12°C) illustrates both effects (Fig. 1).
These end data at other temperatures are presented in Webles L4, 5, and 6. The
favoreble effect of water on BeF, solubility is shown particularly in 70 and

80% HF solutions (Teble L4). BeF, solubllity was cnhanced further when 70, 80,
and 90 wt % HF solutlons were safurated with IiF (Teble 5). Because of the
iicrease in BeF, solubility at higher HF concentrations vhen IiF is present,

the 90-100% BF range was studied further (Teble 6), The solubilities in epproxi-
mately 100% EF eppear sufficiently high for proeess purposes.

| The resulte presented here must be considered preliminary. Beryllium
golubilities, in particular, may be generally higher then indicated because

of analyticel problems. Difficulty wes also encountered in determining accu-
rately the water content in highly concentrated HF, This was partly e problem

‘ of sempling the volatile solutions end partly the result of determining the

emall emount of water by the differemp of the sample weight and the total
‘weight of I4F, BeFp, and HF. = | -

| 86lubility measurements were made also on 63-37 mple $ LiF-BeFo slt
(48-52 wt %) in the 80 to 98 wi & HF range {fable 7). This salt contained

“sbout 0.1 mole % ZrFly 0.2 mole % mixed yave earth fluorides (Lindsay Code 370),

end trace fission products (see following section). The salt was crushed but
not ground -to & powder; average particles were flakes about 10 mils thick and

50 to 100 mils across. The solutions were sampled 15 and 60 min after salt

addition to permit an estimste of the rate of dissolution. The results indi-

" cated that an apprecisble concentretion is reached repidly, ‘but that the solu-

tions ere not saturated, especielly with respect to BeFo, in less then several

 @ays. They slso demonmstrate that the fused salt behaves similarly to the two
~ components added individually. - | ‘ | o : .

 FISSION FPRODUCT DECONTAMINATION IN THE HF SOLUTION FROCESS

The sgueous HF solutions-:of'ﬁhe aai?b' from the preceding experiment were

f1ltered through sintered nickel, end rediochemical enalyses were made to de-

termine the fission product solubilities or decontamination effect. The resulte
(Teble 8) show that rere earths, as represented by cerium, were relatively in-
goluble in the HF solution and were therefore effectively separated from the salt.

The solubllity decreased as the .HF concentration was increased. The total rare
earth (TRE) and trivalent rare earth (except ceiium) analyses do not show this
separation because of the presence of the y'btrium daughter of strontium. No rare
earth activity other than cerium (and yttrium) was detected in the HF solutions.

The slight apparent decontamination from strontium is not understood; strontium

is expected to be fairly soluble in these solutions. Cesium is known to be soluble ’
end all cesium in the sa.lt added apparently dissolved.

Thus the rare earths y &5 represented. by cerium, ere removed from I.:!.‘r“-:BeF2
salts by dissolution of the salt in an aqueous HF golution, and strontium and
cesium are not. The rare earth solubtlity ih these HF solutions saturated with
IAF and BeF,, increased from about 107* mole % in 98 wt % HF to 0.003 mole % in

80 wt % HF,abaaed en the amount of IiF + BeF, diesolved. Reactor fuel with =

Keptunium is the most 'serigg qﬁclear poison other then the rare eartbs in
e molten salt reactor, burning U= ‘_

The neptunium solubility in 80 to 100% HF saturated with LiF and BeF, waes
found sufficiently low to permit its removal-along with the rare eﬂths (Teble 9).
For these determinations smell quantities of neptunium (equeous Fp™* nitrate solu-
tion) were added incrementally to HF solutions saturated with IiF end BeF,. The
concentration of nitrate so added was ~0.02% of the fluoride concentration. Solu-
bilities are reported in mg Np per g solution end in mole % of neptunium relative
to dissolved ]'..i‘ﬁ‘-BeF2 salt.

The neptunium was determined 'by alpha counting wi'bh pulse enalysis to dis-
tinguish neptunium from plutonium activity present as an impurity. The plutonium
appeered to be cerried with the neptunium to a considerable extent; the ratio of

the amount of plutonium in solution to the emount undissolved was within a fec-
_tor of 2 of the ratio for neptunium a.lthougb*the plutonium concentration was
' sma.ller by a factor of 500.

Addition of 1ron e.nd nickel metal to the HF solutions resulted in a signi-

: ficant rednction in the gross o ectivity, probably as the result of reduction

to Kp(III) “end Pu(III) ‘This has not yet been verified by pulse analysis.
The: trivalent state might be expected to behave in somewhat the seme way &s

‘the rare earths; the observed solubilities are in the same renge &s those re<

portéd previously for rare earths. It is expected that the rare earths, nep<

" tunium, plutonium, end possibly uranium will behave as a single group end

therefore exhibit lower solubilities when present toge'bher than the values

reported here for’ the separate componen'bs .

- Mea.surements of the solubilities of thoritm a.nd m.'a.nium fluorides in 90

and solubilities were generally in the range 0.005~0.010 mg of uranium per
gram of solution. In the presence of fresh iron or nickel metal solu-
bilities were somewhat lower, 0.002~0.005 mg/g, indiceting perhaps & higher
golubility for higher oxidation states. Relative to dissolved salt these
solubilities are the order of 0.001 mole %. |

SOLUBILITY OF CORROSION PRODUCT FLUGRIDES IN HF SOLVENT

Measurements were made of the solubilities of corrosion products
fluorides (iron, chromium, and nickel) in HF solutions saturated with

 1iF. Chromium fluoride was relatively soluble, with values of about 8,

12, and 18 mg of chramium per gram of solution in 100, 95, and 90 wt % HF,
respectively. Iron and nickel fluorides were less soluble. Measurements
of the iron fluoride golubility varied from 0.08 to 2 mg iron per grem of
solution; the average and average deviation neglecting extreme values:was
0.1% + 0.10. Measurements of the nickel fluoride solubility varied from.
0.01.to 1.3 mg of nickel per gram of solution, the everage being 0.15 +
0.06. The results were so incensistent that no trend with HF concentra-
tion could be established. When iron, nickel and chromium fluorides were

- present together, the solubilities of 2ll appeared to be somewhat lower.

' Similer measurements in90 and 100% EF (no dissolved salt) fell in
the same range, but in 80 wt % HF the iron end nickel solubilities appeared
to be significantly higher. - _ : _

RECOVERY OF SALT FROM SOLUTION

The IiF end BeF, salt can be recovered from the HF solutions by
evaporation. There gs some question of hydrolysis of the salt in re-
covery, the result particularly of the existence of a high-boiling
azeotrope at 38 wt % HF, which would be obtained if somé water was
present initielly end if flash evaporation was not used. A°90% HF
solution.satureted with IiF and BeF, was slowly eveporated to dryness
end heeted to 450°C. X-ray d1ffraction indicated thet the resulting
salt wvas about 90% 2IiFeBeF and 10% BeF,, and petrographic examination

- indicated Yess than 3% of-materisl other than these fluorides. A se=

. cond sample was eveporated after_eddition ef & little NELF (which would

 decompose and perhaps hydreflnorinste the selt at elevated tempéretures)

.and fused at T00°C. This s&lt_sappeared to be entirely the binary com-

- pound, and the x-ray pettern ¥as somevhat cleaner than in the first case,

* Howevery hydrolysis did not eppeer to be a significent factor in any
event. : e e - -

PROCESS FLOWSHEET FOR REACTCR PROCESSING

A tentative flowsheet for spplicetion of the fluoride volatility

-salt a8 UF, befpre mv d.issolution of the salt, although the reverse might

be feasible in some circunstences.. The liF«BeF, galt is then dissolved

in _concentrated EF (>90% HF) for separation prifisrily from the rare earth
and neptunium neutron poisons. - The sa.lt is re~formed in an evaporation ,
step, from which it would proceed to a final mekeup snd pm'if:l.cation step.

The latter would perbaps involve the H, end HF treatment now believed

necessery for all galt used in & reactor. The UFg prodnced in the vola-
t1lity procese would be converted to UF, for reuse in salt by hydrogen
reduction, or alternately it could possibly be reduced in situ in the

~ fused salt by essentially the same methiod. Although the volatility

process achieves high decontamination, and the dissolution process leads

‘to thec@limination of the rare earths and neptunium activities, the salt
recyecle would require shielding and xemote operation.

‘.me scale of the process vith a_l-year cycle, relative to the
reactor, is indicated in Fig. 3. The d=21ly core salt processing rate
would be about 125 kg containing ebout 4 kg of uranium., Assuming a
10% solubility for LiF-BeF, in the HF solution the solution processing
rate would be less than one-liter per te for the reference reactor
(260 Mir electric). The d=ily blanket proceseing rate would be about 250 kg
containing only about 0.1 kg of UP33 vhich would be recovered by the fluo-
ride volatility process. The blanket salt would then be returned to the
reactor, after treatment-to remove corrosion products, if necessary. In-

- frequent processing of the blenket salt to remove fission products would

be required since at most a2 few percent of the fissions occur in the
blanket, Although more develppment of some of the process chemistry is
certainly needed, the principal features of the procese sppear to be
sulted to the objectives for processing molten salt reactor fuel, Mich
more work will be needed for developing chemical flowsheets for s;pecific

 reactor sys'bems

The concentration factore were generslly less than 2 and elways less than 3. The
solubilities of these components are considersbly higher than their concentrations

i'id.es , 0.1 mole % ZrF), and trace fission products, resulted in.e decrease in rare
