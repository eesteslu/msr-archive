1.3 Surge Volume — The total gas volume in the fuel-pump bowl and
the gverflow tank shall be at least 5,0 ft° whenever the reactor
is critical. If this limit is reached, the reactor shall be
taken subcritical until the volumetric inventory of fuel is
reduced.,

1.4 Excess Reactivity — The reactivity shall be such that the con-
trol rods must be withdrawn at least 50 percent of their total
worth to make the reactor critical at 1210°F., If this limit is
reached, the reactor shall be held subcritical uwatil the ab-
normality is corrected,

1.5 Power — The reactor shall not be operated at a steady power in
excess of 8 Mw. If heat balances indicate nuclear power above
8.1 Mw for more than 1 hour, the heat-removal rate shall be re-
duced to a heat-balance power of 8.0 Mw or less.

1.6 Addition of Fissile Material*“— No more than 120 g of fissile
material shall be added to the fuel in the pump bowl in any

single addition,

 

1.7 Reactivity Anomaly — The reactivity anomaly shall not exceed
0.5% 3k/k while the reactor is critical. "Reactivity anomaly"

is defined as the difference between the observed reactivity and
the reactivity predicted on the basis of measured reactor physics
characteristics and calculated effects of changes in operating
conditions, burnup and fission product accumulation. If this
limit 1s reached, the reactor shall be taken subcritical.

*
1.8 System Test at Elevated Pressure — The fuel circulating system

 

and fuel drain-tank system shall be pressure-tested at least
once a year at a minimum pressure (measured in gas) of L5 psig,
a minimum temperature of 1150°F, and flush salt being circulated
by the fuel pump.

1.9 Corrosion — The chromium concentration in the fuel salt shall
not exceed 1000 ppm. If this limit is reached, steps shall be
taken to minimize the corrosion rate and to reduce the chromium

concentration in the fuel to less than 500 ppm.

 

*
This 1imit will not be reached by any spontaneous change of a pro-
cess varlable, so no operator response is specified.

5 percent as guickly as is practical.

Cell Pressure -—— The pressure in the reactor cell and drain-tank

the normal operating pressure of -2 psig and temperature of

'130°F. If a measurement indicates a leak rate in excess of this

1limit, the leak-rate data shall be analyzed without delay and

if the analysis does not indicate that the rate is actually
within limits, the fuel shall be drained.
