PREFACE

This report represents an effort to prepare a new type of reactor
catalog——one which cites the various concepts of reactors regardless of
whether or not the concepts ever have materialized or will materialize
as actual reactors. When the need for such a catalog confronted
officials in the Division of Reactor Development, U. S. Atomic Energy
Commission, they requested the Argonne National Laboratory to undertake
the cataloging task. Mr. Frank Kerze, now in the Division's Office of
Civilian Power, initiated the project when he was in the Evaluation
and Planning Branch and has coordinated the adminstrative matters to
date. He has also made significant contributions to selection and
compilation of data.

The task involves finding and collecting data on the various
concepts by every means possible. Except in the cases of the more
familiar reactors, the search generally leads to rather obscure
literature sources. Considerable correspondence is needed, but
distribution of questionnaires is being deliberately avoided.

Classified sources are also being searched, and the selected information
that can be declassified is included.

When sufficient information was collected, a scheme for categorizing
the concepts in a logical order had to be developed. The scheme finally
chosen (which is explained in the General Introduction) was developed
primarily by Dr. Charles E. Teeter of the AEC Chicago Operations Office.
Dr. Teeter also developed the coding system for indexing the concept
data on punched cards. Many other persons have assisted in compiling
and reviewing the information, and we are grateful toc all.

This report presents only the first segment of the catalog, i.e.,
Part I, Particulate-Fueled Reactors, of Section I, "Homogeneous and
Quasi-Homogeneous Reactors." Other segments will be issued as additional

reports as the cataloging work progresses.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION

This catalog is a compilation of information on nuclear reactor

concepts. '"'Concept,"

as used here, means any actual design, proposal,
plan, or idea that has been recorded in a manner suitable for study apropos
to further development and that includes all the fundamental features of a
nuclear reactor proper, i.e., fuel, coolant, moderator, control means, and
container. Unique configurations or modifications of standard components
are considered as separate concepts.

The concept descriptions are organized in chapters according to their
generic relationships. A dual method of presentation has been adopted.
Each chapter contains a narrative description of concepts described therein,
highlighting their main features and resemblances and differences. Next
a series of "Reactor Concept Sheets'" is presented, one for each concept in
a concise, standardized format, describing briefly the main features of
each concept. No attempt is made to give complete engineering data, for
which the reader is referred either to the references or to one of the
excellent reactor compilations that have been published by other organiza-
tions. A selected list of these compilations is given in Appendix A, At
the end of each chapter is a list of references for the concepts described
as well as additional selected references.

At the end of each concept sheet is a '

'coding" for the specific concept
in terms of a coding classification system. The explanation of this
classification system is given in Appendix B. From the codings a set of
Royal McBee Keysort or IBM cards can be prepared and used as a comprehensive
cross index for selecting reactors by moderator, coclant, fuel, or any

other coded characteristic. In this way the limitations due to any
arbitrariness in the cataloguing may be overcome. Some degree of
arbitrariness of arrangement is inevitable. Whatever method of arranging
the material is chosen, some concepts might belong equally well in one
chapter as another. When a concept could be included in either of two
places, the more novel feature of the concept is the basis for choice.

In this catalog, most reactor concepts are divided into two main parts:
homogeneocus and heterogeneous. A few concepts fall into a third,
miscellaneous, part. The first part is divided according to the fuel, and
the second part is divided according to the coolant. Purposes of reactors

are identified, but the reactors are catalogued according to their core
characteristics.

SECTION I PARTICULATE-FUELED REACTORS

Chapter 1 Introduction

In accordance with the plan outlined in the general introduction, the
compilation begins with the description of reactors with particulate fuel.
"Particulate" is defined as '"composed of particles," but it is here used in
the sense of '"subdivided" as opposed to '"'massive." 1Included in this
section, therefore, are reactors with fuel ranging from micron-size
particles to 3-inch pebbles, The concept classification system used is
summarized in Table L.

Chapter 2 covers pebble~bed reactors; Chapter 3, packed- or settled-
bed reactors; Chapter 4, fluidized-bed reactors; Chapter 5, fluidized
reactors and moving-bed reactorsj Chapter 6, paste~fuel reactors; and
Chapter 7, particulate~fuel-element reactors.

The pebble~bed reactor is defined most simply as a reactor in which
fuel and moderator are in the form of small clad or unclad spheres or
pebbles in a fixed bed contained or supported in the reactor vessel. Fuel
and moderator may be combined in the same pebbles or may be in separate
pebbles. The coolant flows through the bed; pebbles are loaded at the top

and removed at the bottom.?

Coolant flow may be either upward or downward
through the bed, but if the coolant flows upward the coolant velocity must
not be sufficient to raise the pebbles from their rest positions or there
must be a retaining structure. Thus the pebble bed is also a '"settled bed."”
The pebbles range from 0.4 to 3 inches in diameter., They are sometimes
described as '"marbles" or '"balls.,"

Most pebble-bed reactors are designed for very high temperatures and
gas cooling, but this criterion cannot be considered universal. On the
other hand, most of the reactors described in Chapter 2 have been
specifically named "pebble-bed reactors" by their originators. A few
additional closely related concepts have been included. Other settled-bed
reactors not specifically named '"pebble~bed reactors'" and with particles
smaller than "pebble" size are described in Chapter 3 as 'packed-bed
reactors."

The packed-bed (settled-bed) reactors (Chapter 3) are very similar to

pebble-bed reactors except for the size of the particles or pellets, which
are generally smaller in the packed-bed reactors than ''pebbles." 1In
addition, many packed-bed reactors are liquid-cooled, but a few are gas-
cooled. Some of the liquid-cooled reactors are operated as settled-bed
reactors while the nuclear chain reaction is occurring, but the particles
can be fluidized and removed for reprocessing when the reactor is shut
down. Some reactors can be operated as either fluidized- or settled-bed
reactors by making small changes of geometry or loading parameter.

The fluidized-bed reactor has a core composed of fuel pellets
suspended in a critical configuration in the reactor vessel by an upward-
moving stream of gas or liquid.? The fuel pellets do not circulate outside
the core; i.e., the bed is fixed, not moving. If the fluid flow stops,
the pellets settle by gravity into a subcritical configuration. The
distinction is explained in reference 3. The fluidized-bed reactor is
similar in principle to the pebble-bed reactor except that the fuel pellets
are sufficiently small and the fluid velocity is sufficiently high that
the particles become suspended in the coolant, and the mixture acquires
many of the properties of a liquid, like buoyancy. Sarbacher! states that
"fluidized-bed reactors are ones in which the fuel has the properties of a
quasi- or semi-fluid." Because the pellets must be readily suspended,
the fluidized-bed reactor generally has smaller fuel pellets than the
pebble-bed reactor; in most fluidized-bed reactors, pellets will be
measured in microns, whereas the pebbles range from 0.4 to 3 inches in
diameter. But, as large particles or pellets can be suspended by a
sufficiently rapid coolant flow, this distinction is not absolute.
Fluidized-bed reactors are described in Chapter 4.

Thus, fixed-bed reactors have been divided into three classes: (a)
pebble beds, (b) packed beds, and (c¢) fluidized beds, in accordance with
literature usage, and other secondary, but not universal, characteristics.,
The terms "powder bed" or '"pellet bed" might have been used instead of
"packed bed (settled bed)" to focus attention on the smaller particle size
as compared with "pebble bed." Such terms, however, are not found in the
literature. "Packed" or '"settled" bed is contrasted with "fluidized" bed,
as they developed together. ''Pebble-bed" concepts seem to have developed
separately.

Certain reactors have been described as "fluidized reactors,"
" "suspension reactors" or "moving-bed reactors."

"fluidized-solids reactors,
These have the common feature of a particulate, finely powdered, or fluid-
suspension fuel that flows, like a liquid, into a core vessel, where it
attains criticality, then out of the core, where it becomes subcritical.™
The fuel is then circulated by a pump or fluidized by a stream of gas or
liquid through a heat exchanger to a reservoir above the core. From the
reservoir the fuel flows downward by gravity into the core to complete

the cycle. Although these reactors could be described as ''slurry reactors,"”
they were not so characterized by their originators, and, because of the
distinctive fuel-circulation cycle, these concepts are described under
fluidized and moving-bed reactors. Reactors fueled with slurries will be
treated later in the catalog.

Paste-fueled reactors (Chapter 6) contain particulate fuel dispersed
as a two-phase mixture in a liquid cocolant--usually a liquid metal for
nuclear reactor coolants--at approximately the settled density of 60 percent
of solids. The paste is usually in tubes or interstices in the reactor core.
This density is constant regardless of paste movement. The paste does move,
though slowly, through the tubes, and the reactor may be thought of there-
fore as a slowly moving settled bed.

Other particulate-fueled reactors do not have the fuel disposed in a
"bed" more or less co—extensive with the reactor core. Instead, the fuel,
wvhich may or may not be fluidized, is disposed in tubes, annuli, slabs, or
regions, which may be described as "fuel elements." These reactors are

classed as '"particulate-fuel-element reactors'" in Chapter 7.

Chapter 2 Pebble-~Bed Reactors

Reactors fueled with "pebbles," "marbles," or "balls" having diameters
from 0.4 to 3 inches, represent an attempt to utilize in nuclear reactors
the known advantages of such particles in chemical reactors. Two obvious
advantages are higher surface areas than those of massive fuels and
simplicity of the core. By far, most pebble~bed reactors are gas-cooled,
and thus permit high temperatures. Some however, are cooled with such
liquids as liquid metals or boiling water. Some reactors that are not
strictly pebble bed but are closely related are included here, as are others
that have some other name than "pebble-bed reactor."

The fundamental engineering behavior of pebble beds has been investi-
gated. For example, the advantages of regular packing of pebbles were
studied by Zarié.l According to the author, regular packing of spheres and
small cylinders with hemispherical ends makes possible the investigation of
local conditions of heat transfer and fluid flow. Thus, the uncertainty
associated with random packing is reduced. The free flow area between the
fuel bed and moderator elements permits use of high turbulent mixing in the
bed for energy transfer to the undisturbed portion of the gas stream, with
a corresponding reduction in pressure drop throughout the core. The author
believes that the result is optimum power distribution in the core and

appropriate distribution of coolant flow.

Early History

In September 1944, Farrington Daniels described several pebble-~bed
reactor concepts ('"Pebble Piles").?~> He had been studying the fixation of
atmospheric nitrogen in gas-fired furnaces containing beds of quartz pebbles
heated to 2000°C.° The transition to a pebble-bed nuclear reactor was
obvious. He pointed out that the experience gained during operation of the
chemical furnace indicated that there should be no serious practical
difficulties in operating a similar nuclear pile at 2000°C.

Daniels described a pile charged with pebbles of uranium carbide and
graphite operating at 1500°-2000°C. The pile is cooled by circulating
helium passing uniformly through the whole cross section of the pile, which
is kept at a steady temperature by convection and radiation.? Bismuth
boiling within the pile is an alternate coolant.® In his patent filed in

1945, however, the fuel consists of roughly spherical units with a diameter
of 1 to 3 inches.? He includes spheres, cylinders, and other shapes in his
category of "pebbles," because he mentions a reactor in which moderator

and uranium are in "separate unconformable units in the form of chunks,
pebbles, approximate spheres, etc.'?

Two other Daniels piles are a uranium dioxide~beryllium oxide pile

cooled by air (open-cycle)?»3 and an enriched UO_,-BeO pebble pile cooled by

2
boiling water.

L.ater Concepts

Many pebble-bed concepts from various sources have been published.
Only one, the Brown~Boveri-Krupp, or AVR, reactor in Germany, however, has

reached the construction stage.
UKAEA

Three British patents filed in the name of the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority describe pebble-bed reactors.

The first of these, with an application date of May 8, 1947, refers in
one alternative to a gas-cooled reactor having a core and reflector of
half-inch "marbles."’ These marbles are composed of a moderator material,
or mixtures of such materials, containing dispersed fissile material in
the reactor core. Thorium or a thorium compound may be included in the
reflector. The vessel is built up of beryllium oxide blocks and is
suspended from the steel cover plate of the cylindrical steel reactor
vessel.

The other two patents, which have an application date of June 15, 1948,
describe pebble-bed reactors with essentially the same elements as the
previous one. In one the engineering design is carried much further.® The
other? is directed specifically to the hanging reactor core vessel built up
of blocks of solid moderator material, such as beryllium oxide.

Another British patent filed in the name of UKAEA, with an application
date of November 16, 1950,10 describes a pebble or marble fuel element and
a method for fabricating it. The fuel element has a core of moderator
material, an electrically conducting layer (copper, nickel, silver, or
graphite) on the outer face, and a fissile material electrodeposited or

coated on the layer.
Oak Ridge

The Oak Ridge studies on pebble-bed reactors include an ORSORT student
term paper,!! and two ORNL design studies,!?7!%

In the ORSORT reactor, unclad graphite balls one inch in diameter,
impregnated with uranium-233 and thorium-232, make up the fuel. The balls
are charged from a tank above the reactor and removed by rotating radial
grates at the bottom of the reactor, which is a cylinder 16 feet in
diameter and 24 feet high.l!

A Pebble Bed Reactor Experiment (PBRE) was proposed to the AEC to test
the feasibility of the concept as part of the Gas Cooled Reactor Project.lzs13
Fully enriched uranium is used in 1-1/2-inch balls containing graphite,
uranium dioxide, and thorium dioxide, with additional reflector moderation.
Control blades are placed circumferentially in the reflector so as not to
interfere with the fuel balls in the core. Preventing escape of fission
products by cladding the fuel was considered.

Design studies of a large pebble-bed converter were also made,)3s1%

This 800-Mw(t) power reactor was carried to the conceptual design stage

only, and the studies illustrated the problems involved and indicated

approaches to their solution.

Brown~-Boveri-Krupp

Only one design or proposal for pebble-bed reactors is known to have
resulted in construction. Under the sponsorship of a group of West German
utilities, a 15-Mw(e) power reactor is under construction at Jlllich, West
Germany. Completion is scheduled for about 1965. This reactor is usually
known as the Brown-Boveri-Krupp Reactor, or AVR.15719 It has also been
called the '"potato-bed reactor." The AVR pebble-bed design uses fuel balls
6 cm (2.36 in.) in diameter, with a central cylinder containing 20 percent
enriched uranium in uranium carbide dispersed in graphite, inserted into
graphite balls and closed by a stopper. Balls can be charged or discharged
readily, and the number of balls in the core is used as one method of
control. Cooling is by a mixture of neon and helium circulated by blowers,
and the entire primary system, including steam generators and blowers, is
contained in a large cylindrical steel vessel.

. In April 1963, it was announced that the USAEC had requested an added

authorization of $5.5 million for a program in which the AEC would cooperate
with the West German group.20 The AEC would both develop and have fabricated
a reactor core with coated particles, which would be irradiated in the AVR
reactor. Euratom may also participate in the program. The AEC would be

reimbursed for the power generated from the core it supplies.

Other Designs

A pebble-bed reactor with graphite spheres approximately three inches
in diameter has been described. Spheres this large are desired to reduce

pressure drop of coolant in the core.?!

These spheres are impregnated with
uranium and thorium and are suspended in liquid bismuth metal as coolant.
This reactor may be compared with the Brookhaven Liquid Metal Fueled Reactor,
in which the uranium fuel is dissolved in the bismuth coolant.2?

A High Operating Temperature Reactor (HOTR) was proposed in 1956,23
This reactor was to be based on the conventional MTR design with a central
high-temperature helium-cooled zone. In one alternative, the fuel is
uranium-impregnated graphite pebbles. The exit temperature of the helium
was to be 2500°F. It was hoped that from operation of this unit data

could be obtained for designing a full-scale chemical-processing (chemo-

nuclear or chemical-products) reactor.

Advanced Concept

A pebble-~bed reactor has been proposed for nuclear space propulsion

by Levoy and Newgard.?%*=27 The design uses a hydrogen-cooled, pebble-bed
reactor fueled with uranium dicarbide and graphite. The reactor is divided
axially into compartments by concentric graphite cylinders to channel the
flow for better distribution and better gas-temperature profile as well as
to support the core. Two or more sizes of fuel-moderator pebbles are
specified for the core to reduce the pressure drop, and two sizes of
beryllium oxide pebbles are specified for the reflector to lower the
porosity and fraction of the coolant flow through the reflector. Orificing
of the concentric core channels is obtained by the use of multiple pebble

diameters in the beryllium oxide reflectors.

Reactors Related to Pebble-Bed Reactors

The reactors thus far described have been fueled with '"pebbles"
generally spherical in shape. However, other shapes are not ruled out, for

the Daniels patent noted previously includes "cylinders and other shapes"

10
and "separate unconformable units in the form of chunks, pebbles...etc."
Fuel elements in the form of Raschig rings have been suggested.zg’29

These structures are often used in packed columns for distillation or
extraction. They are hollow cylinders having the outer diameter equal to
the height. They offer much less resistance to coolant flow than pebbles
do. Because the reactor in which this form of fuel is used corresponds in
other respects to a pebble-bed reactor, it is included in this chapter.

Investigations have been carried out by Alco Products, Inc., and by
Sanderson and Porter.39=38 There have been studies for a complete power
plant, and a considerable amount of experimental work on fuel development
by Battelle Memorial Institute.3°=%% Most other concepts have not included
cladding either the fuel particles or the pebbles to prevent emission of
fission products or possible chemical reaction with the coolant, but an
essential feature of the Sanderson and Porter concept of the pebble-bed
reactor is the improved coated-particle fuel element.3® A static bed of
graphite spheres is heated by the fission of contained uranium and the heat
generated is transferred to helium, which is circulated by forced convection
through the permeable bed. According to the authors, this concept differs
from other gas—-cooled concepts in the spherical shape of the fuel elements
and in the method of retarding the release of fission products. The fuel
elements consist of fuel particles, either as oxide or carbide, coated
with a ceramic such as aluminum oxide, beryllium oxide, or pyrolytically
deposited carbon, dispersed in a spherical graphite matrix, which acts as
the fuel carrier, moderator, and heat-transfer surface.

Various core arrangements are possible: (a) a one-region core with
both fissile and fertile material in the fuel elements; (b) a blanketed
core with fissile plus fertile material in the fuel elements and fertile
material only in the blanket, as in the Sanderson and Porter 125-Mw(e)
pebble bed;32 or (c¢) fissile material only in the core and fertile material
only in the blanket, which gives maximum conversion but less economical
power production. A breeder would require a two-region core, but the fuel
cost would be higher.

Three coolant-flow arrangements are also possible: (a) axial upflow,
which was used in the Oak Ridge reactors;l!ls»!% (b) radial outflow, which
was considered and rejected; and (¢) axial downflow, which was used in the

Sanderson and Porter 125-Mw(e) pebble bed,3? in which the coolant flows

11
downward through the reactor core and blanket in parallel. Helium coolant,
graphite moderator and reflector, and uranium dioxide~thorium dioxide fuel
in graphite matrix are used in the Sanderson and Porter reactor; the fuel

elements have a diameter of 1.5 inches.

Evaluation and Status

The pebble-bed reactor has several advantages. They include: (a) the
high temperature attainable, which presumably leads to high thermodynamic
efficiency; (b) a simple core with essentially no precise machining required;
(c) simple fuel~handling procedures, with fuel readily charged or discharged
during operation, if desired; and (d) a minimum of fuel held outside the
reactor core.?!

Disadvantages of the reactor include high pressure drop and high thermal
stresses in the fuel. Young has reviewed the data available in April 1945
on heat transfer and pressure drop in pebble piles.“? From work of Mawrer,
Bentley, and Johnson,®’ he concluded that pebble piles were likely to have
poor performance on account of high pressure drop. The use of Raschig
rings as fuel elements?8:29 yould reduce the pressure drop but would no
doubt introduce other problems.

Amorosi®! calculated the performance of a 250-Mw(t) pile moderated
with beryllium oxide and cooled by helium at 40 atmospheres. He concluded
that the high heat-transfer rate obtainable in a pebble bed is of little
value in a cylindrical pebble pile. "In order to capitalize on the high
design temperature difference available, the pebble size comes out 4.2
inches and the stresses therein are intolerable," he says.

The problems of creating suitable fuel elements and removing fission
products from the primary coolant stream, in fact, were still under
research and development in December 1961.°2

The continuance of construction on the Brown-Boveri-Krupp reactor,
with the new cooperation by the USAEC, indicates that the participants
believe problems with the pebble-bed reactor are solved sufficiently to

warrant large~scale development.

Chapter 3 Packed- (Settled-) Bed Reactors

A packed-bed reactor is a fixed-bed, particulate-fueled, settled-bed
reactor cooled by a fluid, either in direct contact with the fuel particles
or circulating through tubes immersed in the fuel-particle bed. The
moderator, if present, is incorporated in the fuel particles, or it is
included in or identical with the coolant: i.e., there are no moderator
blocks or slabs in the core structure. The fuel particles are small--less
than approximately 0.4 inch diameter--and they are usually much smaller.

Packed-bed reactors function in a manner similar to that of pebble-bed
reactors.

Other names not containing the words "packed bed" have been given to
reactors of this type: homogeneous reactor; sodium—cooled fast reactor
fast—-reactor concept; UC-H, fast-

2 2
reactor concept; directly-cooled reactor--sodium-cooled fast breeder,

with internal heat exchanger; He-UO

axial-flow type; amd directly-cooled reactor--sodium-cooled fast breeder,

radial-flow type.

Early Concepts

In 1953, W. G. Roman, C. M. Slack, et al, of Westinghouse,1 proposed
substituting fluidized or packed-bed cores for the rod, slug, or plate
cores of a pressurized-water reactor. See Chapter 4, in which typical
designs for fluidized-bed reactors they proposed are given. Fixed-bed
designs are similar, except for modification of design parameters to
compensate for greater flow resistance of the fixed beds, According to
the authors, the desired coolant flow with acceptable pumping powers
can be obtained by increasing the diameter of the bed. The increased
diameter and the high metal-to-water ratio of fixed pellet beds result in
a high fuel loading with the associated long life, reduced radiation
damage, and increased conversion of uranium-238 to plutonium=239.

Using fluidizing techniques for fuel loading and handling simplifies
the construction of the reactor and pressure vessel. The reactor becomes
a simple cylindrical container with axial channels for the control reods.
No large removable closure is needed in the pressure vessel because the
fuel can be loaded and unloaded through a small pipe. If some of the
fuel is removed periodically, the remaining fuel can be fluidized and

thus mixed to obtain uniform burnup.

35
An inexpensive automatic method for fabricating pellets must be developed,

and the choice of a suitable fuel also needs further study. Fuels suggested
are those compatible with PWR technology, based on an approximately spherical
fuel pellet (0.5 in. diameter for a typical fixed-bed PWR) with a concentric
Zircaloy cladding. Uranium, uranium alloy, UOZ’ and UOZ-cermet materials
have been proposed for the pellet cores.

Fixed-bed reactors that could be fluidized for chemical processing were
also described. The design closely resembles that of the fluidized-bed
reactors except that an upper grid plate is used to keep the bed in place
and such conditions as flow velocities and fuel-moderator ratios differ.

Other Westinghouse workers carried out further studies on substituting
clad pellets for rod or plate fuel. 1In particular, Jones made heat-transfer
calculations for pellet fuels in both fluidized and fixed beds.? For both
types of beds, pellets of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 inch diameter were considered.
The porosity for the fluidized bed was taken to be 60 percent, corresponding
to a metal-to-water ratio of 1.5; the porosity for the packed bed was taken
as 37 percent.

Another early proposal (1954) which, by our definition, is a packed-bed
reactor, is the "Quasi-Heterogeneous Reactor" described by de Bruyn.gg_gl.3
This reactor is fueled with a non-circulating suspension of UO2 incorporated
in 3-mm "compound grains'" of UOZ—BeO with an atomic ratio of Be/U of about
80. There is an internal heat exchanger or boiler, which consists of
1-1/2 inch graphite boiler tubes, 2-1/4 inches apart, containing DZOO From
the physics standpoint, however, the reactor may still be treated as a
homogeneous reactor. Helium under pressure is circulated through the
packed bed to improve heat transfer, and the hot helium (1200°C) is used

to superheat the D, O steam in an external superheater. The entire system

2
is pressurized to about 40 kg/cm2 (about 570 psi).
Rodin,“ at the Argonne National Laboratory, has described a reactor

that may be treated as homogeneous because of the small proportion of
structural elements in the core. The core of the reactor, which is chain-
reacting with fast neutrons, is made up of roughly hexagonal fuel assemblies.
Each assembly consists of a stack of packed-bed fuel elements, each of which
is a layer of fuel particles arranged in a holder to permit the coolant to
flow radially through the bed of particles. Thin plates of porous media or

wire screens may be used to support the beds. Gas coolant enters the packed

36
bed through inlet headers, formed by grooves in the exterior wall of each
hexagonal fuel element. After flowing radially through the bed the coolant
exits through a central gas—outlet header in each fuel subassembly. Two
fast reactors are described, a helium-cooled, UOZ-fueled reactor and a
hydrogen-cooled, UC-fueled reactor.

Another reactor that can be considered in this chapter, although the core
has structural features, is a fast reactor proposed by Heckman.® The fuel is
spheres of enriched uranium carbide, contained in subassemblies of square
tubes. The spheres are plated with an inner coating of tin, lead, or
aluminum and an outer coating of molybdenum. At each end of the tube are
blankets, spheres of fertile material. The tubes, of expanded sheet metal
or wire screen, are closed at each end with screening to permit coolant flow.
Liquid sodium enters the reactor at the top and flows over the core, where
it is vaporized by the heat of fission. The vapor leaves the reactor,
goes directly to a turbine, then to a helium-cooled condenser. The liquid
sodium returns to the reactor. Helium is also used in startup and shutdown
as coolant and as a gas pump to recirculate the sodium. The reactor can be
loaded and unloaded by moving subassembly tubes. Control is by circulating
spheres of boron carbide through a control loop in the reactor, and, for
shutdown, by lowering some fuel assemblies below the position normal for
criticality.

An early design by Grebe® was for a graphite-moderated chemonuclear
reactor in which the fuel is spheres of enriched uranium carbide or a
mixture of U235 and thorium double carbides. Hydrocarbon gases (coolant)
react at very high temperatures in the reactor to form acetylene and hydrogen,

Theoretical work pertaining to heat-transfer and fluid-flow character-
istics of the packed-bed fuel elements was reported by Viskanta.’/ He
concluded that the highest temperature of the bed is at the exit; that
instability of flow rate and bed temperature may arise from the temperature
dependency of the coolant viscosity; and coolants with the highest possible
heat-removal capacity should increase flow stability and power density of
the reactor. Hydrogen was suggested as a coolant.

Fluidized- and settled-bed reactors have been studied at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Attention has been especially directed to liquid-metal-
cooled, particulate~fueled reactors. Four settled-bed concepts have been

described.®10 They include a sodium-cooled fast reactor, with internal heat

37
exchanger, and three directly-cooled fast reactors: a carbide-fueled reactor
with axial flow, a carbide-fueled reactor with radial flow, and an oxide-
fueled reactor with radial flow. All three are cooled with sodium and

would be breeders in a U238/Pu239

cycle.

In the fast reactor with internal heat exchanger, the flow of sodium
coolant is independent of the characteristics of the packed bed, but internal
mechanical design is complicated.? A separate sodium flow is provided, when
needed, to fluidize the bed for discharge or for mixing.

In the axial-flow, directly-cooled fast reactor, the sodium coclant
flows downward, entering above the packed bed through a 24-inch pipe and
leaving below the bed through a similar pipe.®»? A packed-bed blanket
completely surrounds the core vessel. The core and blanket are charged with
pellets in the fluidized condition. Fuel or blanket pellets are also dis-
charged by fluidizing them. The coolant flow is reversed and the fluidized
pellets are discharged through separate unloading ports for fuel and blanket.

The radial-flow directly cooled reactor differs from the axial-flow
design in that the 24-inch coolant pipe runs vertically through the core
vessel on its central axis.®*? Thus the fuel region is annular. The
coolant pipe is perforated within the core vessel. The sodium coolant
enters the central pipe from both the top and bottom. It flows radially
outward through the core, then through perforations in the core vessel, out
through the pellet blanket, which completely surrounds the core. The

hydraulics of this design would need further investigation.

Evaluation and Status

Most work dealing with the advantages of packed-bed reactors has come
from the Brookhaven group, who emphasize their settled-bed reactor, the bed
of which can be fluidized.®s®

They peoint out that fluidization of particulate fuel in nuclear
reactors gives the fuel mobility, which permits long burnup periods and
simplifies the transfer of fuel to, from, and within the reactor. If
fluids of relatively low conductivity, such as water and organic liquids,
are the fluidizing media, fluidization greatly improves heat transfer.

In the BNL reactors, however, the fluidizing agent is a liquid metal,

sodium. Thus, high heat-transfer capacity is available regardless of

38
whether the fuel is fluidized or settled. Flexibility in fundamental

design studies is thus possible.

Specific advantages of the settled-bed fuel, and especially of the

"fluidizable" settled bed, have been given by the Brookhaven group. Some

are similar to those for pebble~bed reactors (Chapter 2) and fluidized-

bed reactors (Chapter 4):

d.

Distribution of the fuel-containing solids--and therefore the fuel

density-—is kept uniform throughout the entire core.

Mobility of the fuel allows the particle suspension to flow
freely in tubes connecting the reactor core region with an
outside vessel, for fuel makeup and reprocessing, in response to
pressure adjustment in the fluidizing-liquid stream. Fuel
makeup at frequent intervals is itself an important advantage
because only small amounts of excess reactivity would then

be required.

If fuel of small particle size is used, the high surface-to-mass
ratio of the particles minimizes the disadvantage of the low
thermal conductivity of UO2 and other ceramic fuels. In the one
design in which the larger particles are used, thermal
conductivity and the resulting thermally induced internal
stresses are very sensitive design considerationms.

The high costs of making solid fuel elements under close
tolerance requirements are eliminated. The cost of coating fuel
particles was not taken into account, because coating must at
present be considered an expensive process. Containing the
fission products within the fuel particles by coatings would
facilitate reactor design by minimizing problems associated with
separation of fuel and coolant. The economic aspects of
processes for coating particles and the over-all influence on
both fuel cycle (including reprocessing) and maintenance costs
are unknown., (Experience with the Martin critical experiment on
fluidized beds indicates that uncoated particles are unsuited
for fluidization because of erosion.)

The mobility of the fuel assures uniform burnup in the fuel.

The fuel is confined to the core of the reactor, but the other

advantages of a liquid fuel are retained.

39
g. Particulate solid fuel can be used without the need to recirculate
the fuel through pumps, valwves, etc., and without problems of
erosion or attrition of fuel particles. Even with fluidization
of the fuel, the authors claim, almost quiescent conditions exist
in the laminar flow state.

A notable advantage claimed in a later report for the Brookhaven fast
breeders with settled beds is the short doubling timel? That of the radial-
flow reactor with uranium carbide fuel is 4.1 years. Another advantage is
that comparatively little sodium is needed as coolant and fluidizing agent.

Possible disadvantages of packed bed reactors have apparently not yet
been evaluated completely., This situation seems to be related to the small
amount of experimental work that has been carried out thus far on this type
of reactor concept. However, this approach probably has few problems and is
worthy of favorable consideration. Referring to the listed disadvantages
of pebble-bed reactors—-high thermal stresses in the fuel and high pressure
drop in the bed--indicates that thermal stresses will be less for the
smaller packed-bed particles. Rodin“ has calculated that for UO2 at 1700°C
the thermal stress would be about 0.3 kg/cm2 as compared with the tensile
strength of 350 kg/cmz. The pressure drop may be a problem, especially in
gas—-cooled reactors. Stable bed porosities from 0.38 to 0.42 can be
achieved by normal handling, and much higher porosities are possible,
although methods for attaining these have not yet been developed.L+
Pressure drop may also be lowered by careful design.

The Brookhaven group, in their plans for future development, foresee
three possible difficulties that must be studied: stabilizing uranium
carbide to prevent formation of free carbon, determining whether a liquid
control system is possible, and preventing fuel pellets from fusing

together, 9

Chapter 4 Fluidized-Bed Reactors

Fluidized~beds, in which particles are suspended by an upward-flowing
stream of fluid, are well-known in chemical engineering, but their
applications to nuclear reactors have complications. Many engineering
problems have to be solved to utilize such advantages as the uniformity of
temperature in the bed and ease of handling.

Some fluidized-bed reactors have been given other names: fluidized
suspension reactor, fluidized thermal reactor, fluidized uranium hexa-
fluoride reactor, fluidized uranium oxide reactor, rabbit reactor,
vibrating-bed fluidized uranium oxide reactor, and clad-pellet reactor.

A fluidized-bed reactor, in its operating condition, consists of a
bed of particles (fuel, fuel~moderator, moderator, or inert material)
that are individually suspended by an upward moving stream of fluid and
free to move throughout the whole bed. Ideally, the bulk density is
constant throughout the bed, and the volume of the bed is also constant.
These criteria are important for the nuclear stability of the reactor,
because variations in bulk density or volume affect the reactivity.
However, if these characteristics can be purposefully changed, they offer
one means of controlling the reactor. The fluidized bed is supported in
a reactor tank or reactor core tank that is permeable to the fluid,
usually solely on the bottom, but it may be permeable on the sides as
well for better mixing and heat transfer. Sufficient volume must be
provided in the reactor tank for the fluidized bed in its expanded
condition, because this volume may be as much as twice the volume of the
particles in a settled state. A fluidized-bed reactor is ordinarily
considered fail-safe, for, if the fluidizing flow stops, the particles

settle into a sub-critical configuration.

Fluidization Applied to Nuclear Reactors

Fluidization seems to differ in gas-fluidized and liquid-fluidized
beds. Investigations by Rowe and Partridge! show that rapid mixing of
particles in a gas—-fluidized bed depends on passage of bubbles. Uniform
bubbling gives a rapid and complex, but non-random, particle motion. In
liquid-fluidized beds, on the other hand, mixing is induced by fluid
turbulence and approximates a random process.

The fluidization process as a function of fluid velocity has been

53
described by Leva.?

"When a fine granular material is dumped into a vessel, the .
resulting bed has a definite bulk density... When the wall of the
vessel is tapped during dumping the bed packs somewhat more densely
than under quiet conditions... If a fluid is admitted at a very
low rate into the bottom of this bed, a small pressure drop will
be indicated by a manometer. As the rate of flow is gradually
increased, the pressure drop rises to a point of equilibrium at
which the weight of the bed in the fluid stream is equal to the
fluid pressure drop across the column multiplied by the cross-
sectional area of the vessel...

"As the rate of fluid flow increases still further, the bed
begins to expand. This expansion increases the percentage of voids
in the bed sufficiently to keep the pressure drop essentially
constant despite the accelerated flow rate., At a certain velocity,
the bed will have expanded to such a density that the individual
particles have been disengaged from each other sufficiently to
permit internal motion of the particles in the bed. This internal
motion is induced by the fluid moving through the interstices of
the bed and indicates the beginning of fluidization...

"Additional increase in fluid rate expands the bed further
and intensifies the motion of the particles... For much higher
rates of fluid flow, the state of agitation increases still further,
and the position of the top of the bed fluctuates considerably.

For very high flow rates, large bubbles usually force their way

upward through the bed..."

The equilibrium fluidized bed with particles in motion but with
relatively constant bulk density and top level of bed constant is often
spoken of as a "'quiescent" fluidized bed. The highly agitated bed with
rapidly fluctuating bulk density and bed height is called a "boiling'" bed.
Fluid velocities must be intermediate between the velocity that will just
buoy the particle bed and the velocity that will sweep the bed out of the
container.,

Other excellent general references on the subject of fluidization and
fluidized beds are Zenz and Othmer3 and Leva.“ Definitions of fluidization .

or fluidized beds in general, or as applied to reactors, are also given by

54
Squires,5 Hatch,6 Lane,’ Carpenter8 and Thewlis.®
. Incentives for applying the fluidized-bed concept to nuclear reactors
have been summarized by Slack, Roman, et al, of Westinghouse, developers of
an early nuclear reactor of this type:10
""A1l of the major reactors which have been built to date are of
the type in which the fuel is contained in solid members which are
fixed in positicn. The disadvantages of this arrangement have been
recognized and this recognition has lead to serious consideration of
homogeneous reactors, in which the fuel is finely divided, held in
suspension or solution in the coolant-moderator, and thus can be
handled in bulk as a fuel should be. In this connection, it is
interesting to note an editorial by V. L. Parsegian in TID-2008,
'Reactor Science and Technology,' Vol. 3, No. 1, March 1953. Mr.
Parsegian writes:

'Fuel is ordinarily thought of as something that is shovelled
or piped into a boiler, from which it is largely exhausted

in the form of waste gases. The atomic reactor appears to
have introduced a rather different concept of fuel element,
leaning slightly in the direction of the bush which burned
with fire in the presence of Moses but which surprisingly

was not consumed... Our most popular reactor concepts appear
to treat these slugs more as structural material than as fuel
that is intended to be consumed... Under these circumstances,
it is not surprising that current reactors suffer heavy
compromise in low efficiency, very limited temperature, low
fuel burnup, high fuel cost, and tco frequent shutdowns

from slug failures... The merits of continuous flowing
chemical and fuel systems are too well established in modern
industry not to warrant adopting them in nuclear reactor
systems wherever feasible... It would be a good bet that in
such improved systems the fuel will once again be piped in
and once again be intended for consumption, and that there
will be less dependence on the principle of the burning bush.'

"The use of pellets offers a comparatively simple reactor fuel
which may be produced by high speed methods and which can be applied to
many types of reactors. It is subject to simple handling techniques
in loading, unloading and reprocessing. The term 'Pellet' as used in
this report means any unattached fuel element of small but not
microscopic size., Half-inch diameter spheres are a typical example,
although the spherical shape is not essential. Thus pellets represent

. a class of material which is intermediate between the carefully

machined, rigidly supported rods or plates used in most reactors, and

55
a completely unfinished bulk material, such as the uranium oxide which
might be used in a homogeneous slurry reactor.

"The pellets we are considering should be large enough so that
they can be manufactured individually and made uniform in size, but
simple enough in structure that the manufacturing processes can be
performed on high speed automatic machines. As will be shown later,
many other factors, some of them conflicting, govern the choice of
pellet size, One factor is the effect of fuel element failures on
radioactivity in the external loop. If too much fuel is contained
in a single element, the failure of an element produces an intolerable
high transient in the level of radioactivity. Fortunately, the pellet
sizes which we are led to by heat transfer and fluid flow considerations
are small enough so that individual failures do not cause high activity
transients."

A comprehensive survey of the methods of application of fluidization
techniques to nuclear reactors has been made by Morris g;_gloll Four types
of reactors were visualized, with different combinations of solid and fluid

moderator, fuel, and inert material (Table II),

Specific reactor systems of the various types were not listed. However,
from the information given in the text and tables, sample systems may be
theorized. For example, Reactor Type I might consist of finely divided

graphite fluidized with UF, gas (at high temperatures); Type II might employ

6
graphite pellets impregnated with uranium and fluidized with liquid sodium
or liquid bismuth--cladding for the pellets would be required; Type III

might have UO2

For Reactor Type IV the function of the inert solid is apparently to

pellets fluidized with molten sodium hydroxide.

improve heat transfer—-zirconium pellets fluidized by a solution of uranyl
sulfate in light or heavy water might be possible. A possible gaseous
combination has been suggested by Kerzelz—-Can particles fluidized by a
mixture of UF6 and CF4. This combination would be possible if the fluidizing
mixture has sufficient moderating properties.

Application to a power-producing system involved four methods of heat
removal with a gas-fluidized bed. One of these methods included circulation
of the suspended solids outside the core; thus it will not be considered in

this chapter. The other three differed as to whether (a) the heated gas

57
passed directly through a turbine; (b) the heated gas transferred heat
through an external heat exchanger to a second coolant, which passed through
the turbine; (c¢) a heat exchanger and second gas coolant were used, as in
(b), but the heat exchanger was located within the reactor core, i.e., within
the fluidized bed.

For a liquid fluidized bed the possible methods of heat removal were
limited to the double-coolant systems with internal or external heat
exchangers. Additional heat-removal systems for gas fluidized beds were
so-called mixed-phase systems, in which the gas was fully condensed at the
low-pressure end of the turbine (single coolant) or alternatively, in an
intermediate heat exchanger (double coolant). The liquid stream was then
returned to the reactor and injected directly into the fluidized bed.

The general conclusion was that fluidized-bed reactors were promising
but much research and development would be needed.

The nuclear stability of fluidized bed reactors as a function of
changes in bed height was explored by a group at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in a preliminary study, which employed calculational methods
onlya13 It was limited to reactors in which particles containing
uranium-233 and thorium-232 are fluidized by liquid water. Reactors
moderated with heavy water were found to be least sensitive to changes in
bed height at thorium concentrations of 80-120 g/1; those moderated with
light water were least sensitive in the range 1500-2400 g Th/1l; and mixed
HZO-D20 reactors at intermediate concentrations. A reactor operated at
the thorium concentration at which it was least sensitive to changes in
bed height was stable in response to cyclical variations of bed height.

One difficulty with fluidized-bed reactors results from the use of
the same fluid for cooling the reactor and fluidizing the bed. The
maximum velocity of the fluid flow may be limited because excessive rates
would result in excessive bed expansion, poor distribution of the solids,
attrition of the solids, and erosion of the container walls. Increasing
the flow of coolant without increasing the fluidization flow would increase
the power rating of a core for a given temperature rise in the coolant.
Two approaches to this problem have been suggested.

Hatch et_al, of Brookhaven, have proposed a fluidized-bed reactor in
which the sodium coolant circulates through a U-tube in the bed, and

another flow of sodium fluidizes the particles.!%»15 Thus the coolant flow

58
is separated from the fluidizing flow and the rates are independent.

This type of reactor design may offer the greatest promise for a
truly feasible nuclear reactor. According to Robba‘gg_gl,le the
separation of fluidized fuel from coolant results in high stability of the
fluidized bed as a whole and particularly of fuel density. In addition,
the almost quiescent conditions of such a fluidized bed almost eliminate
attrition of particles and erosion of container walls,

A second solution was advanced by Silverstein,l” at the Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, who propcsed substituting porous for solid reactor
walls. The lower portion of the porous walls is normally bounded by solid
walls, with an annular space between. The porous walls would permit
part of the fluidizing liquid to leave the bed through the walls, instead
of through the top surface of the bed. Thus, the average fluidizing
velocity would be less for the same entrant velocity of fluid than that
of a bed surrounded by solid walls. The consequent decrease in expansion
of the bed was demonstrated in experiments. For example, in a solid-wall
reactor, the height of a bed increased by a factor of 3 at an entrant
velocity, of fluidizing water, of 0.22 feet per second. In a porous-wall
reactor, at a greater entrant velocity--0.34 feet per second--the height
of the bed increased by a factor of only 1.09.

The experiments showed that the behavior of the porous-wall bed was
not affected appreciably by entry-velocity distribution or by restrictions
at the top of the bed but was affected by flow restrictions in the annular
flow passage between the porous walls and the solid walls, Fluidization
in a porous-wall bed, once it begins, may be more violent than that in a
solid-wall bed at the same fluid-bed fraction. The use of a porous-wall
container within an outer one was tested. When an inverted cone with
porous walls was placed within the outer porous container, the bed
expanded in height about 30 percent, compared with a maximum of 20 percent
for a cylindrical porous~wall bed.

A proposal to study the concept further was published,18 but the

status is not known.

Early Concept

Slack, Roman, et al, of Westinghouse, proposed the use of a packed or

fluidized bed in a pressurized-water reactor.10s19,20 Ip this converter,

59
slightly enriched uranium, as metal, alloy, or oxide, is in the form of
spherical pellets, preferably clad, about 1/4 inch in diameter. The coolant
and moderator may be pressurized water, which flows upward through a
perforated plate on which the pellets rest to fluidize them in a critical
configuration. The authors discuss the possible application of such a
reactor to a power plant. Fixed-bed reactors fluldizable for reprocessing,

are also described.

Later Concepts

An Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology (ORSORT) study by Halik, et al,
described briefly four reactor concepts utilizing fluidized beds.?! Detailed
engineering and nuclear calculations were made for a fifth concept--'"Fluidized-
Solids Power Breeder" which is described in Chapter 5, (Fluidized and Moving-
Bed Reactors). The study was chiefly directed at gas—solid systems, although
one liquid-solid system was considered.

In the first reactor system, gaseous UF, is both fuel and fluidizing gas.

6
There are three fluidized-bed regions~-core, blanket, and heat exchanger.

The core contains BeO particles suspended in UF, gas. Surrounding the core

6
is a fluidized-bed blanket of ThO, and graphite particles. Hot BeO

particles flow by gravity out of ihe core through a discharge pipe. A
stream of argon or helium carries them through a transfer leg and discharge
nozzle into the heat exchanger--the third fluidized bed. The cooled BeO
particles flow from the heat exchanger by gravity through a discharge pipe,

are transported by a stream of UF, through a transfer leg, and are charged

back into the core through a distiibutor nozzle. The gas flows are adjusted
to maintain constant-level fluidized beds in the core and heat-exchanger
vessels. The blanket material is fluidized in a separate circuit. Only
nuclear calculations were made for this concept, but they showed that the
reactor could readily be made critical by using BeO as the moderator.

The other two ORSORT concepts employ graphite particles impregnated
with uranium-233. One of the concepts (fluidized-moving-bed core and heat
exchanger) uses separate heat exchanger, core, and blanket vessels, as in
the UF6-f1uidized reactor. The authors, however, believe that the high
velocity and large quantity of gas needed to transfer the fuel-moderator
to and from the heat exchanger is likely to induce instability of the

fluidized beds because of boiling, bubbling, or even slugging. Thus, the

60
controllability of the reactor was questionable. Preliminary neutronics
calculations indicated that a 4-inch drop in bed height (3 percent)
increases the reactivity (8k) by 2.7 percent. There was no further
development of the system beyond preparation of a schematic drawing
representing the concept.

An alternative arrangement was that of a fluidized-fixed-bed core
with an internal heat exchanger located near the periphery. Little
consideration was given to this arrangement because of the lack of
evidence of positive flow distribution of solids in gases, and because
of the apparent control problem.

A liquid-solid fluidized system was examined briefly. The core is
a cylinder containing graphite pebbles fluidized by an upward flowing
stream of D20. This liquid system is more stable than the gas-solid
system—--reactivity changes more slowly with changes in bed height--but
the system must be pressurized to obtain acceptable steam conditions.

A few general calculations were made.

A second ORSORT study was carried out in 1957 by Teeter et al.??
They discarded fast fluidized-bed reactors on account cf high inventory
and gas fluidized beds on account of high pumping-power requirements.
Of the liquid fluidized-bed systems, both organic cooled and moderated
and light water cooled and moderated reactors were judged worthy of
further study. Reactors cooled and moderated with DZO were eliminated
because the moderator-to—-fuel ratio was so large that the fluidized
bed would be hydrodynamically unstable. The light-water system was
finally chosen—--although it involved high pressure-—and a preliminary
design calculation was made.

A review team from Foster-Wheeler Corporation and Pioneer Service
and Engineering Company concluded that a thermal uranium-233 breeder
with circulating fuel offered great potentialities for economic
central-station power.23 1In a subsequent report?“ a group from the
same two companies and the Diamond Alkali Company re-—-evaluated the
ORSORT concepts. They rejected the boiling gas~-fluidized-bed systems
(with internal or external heat exchangers) because of uncontrellability.
They did not consider liquid fluidized-bed reactors. They also rejected

the UF, -gas-fluidized reactor because of the corrosiveness of the gas,

6
the low concentration of uranium atoms—-which would necessitate

61
pressurization to attain criticality in a reasonable core size, and the
high pumping power required.

The system selected for further study was a uranium-233 breeder with
a quiescent fluidized-bed core. Internal and external breeders were
considered, as in the ORSORT study. The internal breeder is simpler, but
a sphere 20 ft in diameter with a 2-ft graphite reflector would be
required. This concept would call for a much larger inventory of
fissionable material than that for the external breeder. To test the
feasibility of a quiescent fluidized bed, preliminary experiments on
fluidization, flow rate, and flow pattern were made. The group concluded
that maintaining a truly quiescent gas-fluidized bed was impossible.

A group of Netherlands reactor engineers (FOM~KEMA* Reactor Development
Group) studied several liquid and gaseous suspension reactors, including
fluidized-bed reactors, but they, too, concluded that the fluidized-bed
concepts that they investigated were not promising.25 The authors
described and rejected the boiling fluidized bed for reactor application as
being uncontrollable because of density change. They described a mechanical
method of fluidization by means of a vibrating cone. They mentioned a
vibrating-bed reactor but did not consider it further. They stated that
because of limited core size, such a reactor would require highly enriched
uranium, which is undesirable for a civilian power reactor.

Astley carried out several studies at Hanford on a fluidized-bed reactor
moderated with pressurized light water (Rabbit Reactor), in which the fuel

26,27

is aluminum-clad uranium or uranium dioxide pellets. The original

28

concept was suggested by Anderson. Johanson carried out some experimental

studies on fluidization of 3/8-inch and 3/4-inch steel spheres in 6-inch
and 9-inch columns.?2?
A fluidized bed, clad-pellet reactor was examined in a preliminary

(uranium-233) fuel clad with nickel, molybdenum, zirconium, or stainless
steel, and a moderator-coolant of light water or terphenyl were considered.
Physics and heat-transfer calculations were made, and some hydraulic data

were obtained with 0.1-0.15~inch lead pellets and with water at room

temperature as the fluidizing medium.

Scheve, et al, of the Martin-Company--now Martin-Marietta--have
studied the fluidized-bed reactor concept.3!™35 These investigations
were an extension and expansion of the work begun in the second ORSORT
study.3! In the six-month feasibility study, a series of physics
calculations was given for pressurized, water-moderated, slightly
enriched, thorium—uranium oxide reactors. In addition, calculations
were given for diphenyl-moderated reactors with slightly enriched uranium
oxide as fuel. The latter gave highest keff at high moderator volume
fractions, at which the fluidized bed would be unstable. For this reason
a reactor with higher enrichment and lower moderator volume fraction
would have to be specified. To improve this behavior, adding BeO
moderator to the UO2 pellets was suggested. This addition would allow
operation at the highest possible moderator volume fraction and at
lower enrichments. Calculations involved particle sizes ranging from
0.075 to 0.275 inch. Control and hazard problems were studied, and
preliminary experimental work on fabrication and testing of pellets
was carried out.

The hazards report3? describes a critical-experiment facility
consisting of a fluidized-bed reactor fueled with fuel pellets of
slightly enriched uranium dioxide and cooled and moderated with light
water. The facility was built, but the reactor did not go critical.
(See "Evaluation and Status")

The Liquid Fluidized Bed Reactor Experiment study35 describes a
reactor with aluminum-clad uranium dioxide fuel pellets 230 mils in
diameter. Santowax OMP is moderator, coolant, and fluidizing medium.
The enrichment is 2.5 percent.

An "Organic Moderated Fluidized-Bed Reactor" concept was described
by Wright in 1958.3° This concept employs uranium fuel in the form of
spherical pellets and an organic coolant-moderator of the polyphenyl
type. The power output is made essentially self-controlling by feeding
back changes of average temperature to a flow-rate controller, which
automatically changes the bulk density of the bed and hence the
reactivity. If the coolant flow stops, the bed collapses to a sub-
critical condition and the reactor is therefore fail-safe. The organic

fluid is considered the best choice for the fluidizing medium because:

63
(a) it provides lubrication between the turbulent fuel pellets; (b) its low
vapor pressure allows the use of low-pressure equipment; and (c¢) it can be
used at higher temperatures than are practical for water. The organic
coolant is practically noncorrosive, and the conversion ratio attainable 1is
high, possibly approaching unity.

A review team at Brookhaven (L. P. Hatch gg_gi) evaluated reactors
using settled-bed fuels.l%s15 One of the concepts, a sodium-cooled fast
breeder reactor, has a particulate~fuel bed, with an internal heat
exchanger. It is intended that the fuel will be maintained in a settled
bed. As an alternative, however, if further investigation shows feasibility
and desirabil%ty, the fuel may be fluidized. The particulate~fuel is
composed of spherical UOZ-—PuO2 particles 75 to 100 p in diameter. The
sodium coelant circulates through stainless-steel U~tubes immersed in the
bed. Additional sodium flow is provided to fluidize the core particles.

Two other concepts studied are heterogeneous reactors, with the
settled or fluidized fuel occupying the space in the lattice ordinarily

occupied by the fuel elements of a solid-fueled reactor.l®

These concepts
will be described in the chapter on Particulate-Fuel-Element Reactors

(Chapter 7).

Advanced Concept

Hatch et al have proposed a fluidized-bed nuclear reactor for rocket

propulsion.®237

Here the designers propose to solve the problem of
maintaining a quiescent fluidized bed and still keep up the required high

coolant velocity by rotating the fluidized bed at high speed.

Evaluation and Status

Authorities who have evaluated concepts for fluidized-bed reactors have
considered the gas and liquid versions separately.

The advantages and disadvantages of the gas-fluidized bed reactor have
been summarized.?Z3»2"%

The advantages are: high neutron economy--~breeding may be possible;
operability at atmospheric pressure; a minimum of corrosion problems;
inexpensive structural materials; the possibility of generating high-
temperature steamj no preheating of ccoolant prior to startup required; high
specific power; negligible radiation damage to the fuel; and a simple,

continuous processing system.

64
There are, however, two disadvantages. The stability of a gas~
fluidized bed is questionable. Graphite particles averaging 60 p in
size agglomerate at about 1500°F. According to Kirkpatrick, graphite
also "plates out" in the system.3® The attrition rate of graphite in a
circulating fluidized system is estimated to be about 1-2 percent per day.
In a bed with circulation only in the core, the rate may be less but the
fines would still have to be removed to maintain proper particle size
for fluidization. Removal of fines would result in low burnup of fuel in a
processing cycle, as well as loss of fuel and graphite moderator. Control
is also a difficulty. The negative temperature coefficient is not adequate
to assure effective self-regulation. The power increases so rapidly with
increasing core density that proper control will be difficult.

The advantages of a liquid fluidized reactor have been given by

Manowitz and Zwickler3? and by Scheve.3l

a. The fuel burnup would be uniform and the ratio of maximum to
average would be essentially unity.

b. The conversion ratio should be higher and the neutron economy
better than in a fixed-fuel reactor because of the absence of
structural and cladding materials.

c. The fuel can be unclad pellets of uranium dioxide of simple shape,
which should be relatively inexpensive the fabricate and reprocess.
On the other hand, the experience of the Martin Co. with the
Liquid Fluidized Bed Reactor critical experiment shows that unclad
fuel pellets are not feasible, and that the erosion problem is
very real.

d. Fuel may be added and removed continuously; large amounts of
excess reactivity are not needed for burnup.

e. The continuous’processing, the negative temperature coefficient,
and variable flow and enrichment features, make it possible to
control the reactivity without the use of control rods.

f. Fuel may be handled remotely.

g. Activity is contained--failure of a single pellet exposes only
small fraction of total activity.

h. Construction of the reactor vessel is simple.

i. The coolant exit temperature is high and less coolant is required.

jo Down time is at a minimum.

65
The disadvantages are:3? restricted fluid velocity; probably low
conversion ratio; less-advanced technology; unknown factors: hydraulics,
control, and cladding technology (erosion and integrity of cladding); and
fouling of terphenyl at low velocities.

Apparently the Martin-Marietta Co. critical-experiment facility is the
only fluidized-bed reactor that has thus far reached the construction stage.
The facility was completed3® and loading fuel for criticality began in
February 1962.%% However, criticality was not attained even after 2200 lbs

of 1.6 percent enriched U0, pellets were loaded. Criticality had been

expected at a loading of 1200 lbs of pellets. Investigation showed that
abrasion of the unclad, pea-sized pellets had resulted in the loss of
several hundred pounds of enriched uranium oxide. This oxide had been
reduced to powder and was acting as a poison instead of as a fuel. "l

Martin proposed a new loading of uranium-molybdenum alloy pellets clad with
a suitable metal to overcome the abrasion problem, but to accomplish this
loading, new AEC funding was required.“? There has been no further news of

this project since October 1962.

remains in core in fixed bed, boiling and slugging would be minimized, i.e.,
quiescent bed. No further consideration of this design by originators
because of control problem and lack of evidence for positive flow distribu-

tion of solids and gases.

system, clad-pellet bed can tolerate a temperature drop greater by a factor
of four. Can therefore extract about 1.8 times more power. Alternatively,
it can transport same amount of heat using one fourth of coolant required
for a fixed fuel system. This advantage partly compensates for disadvantage

Chapter 5 Fluidized Reactors and Moving-Bed Reactors

In the particulate-fueled reactors thus far considered, the fuel
remains in the reactor during operation, although it may be discharged in
part or in toto for reprocessing. However, as mentioned in the introduction
to this part, some reactors employ a particulate, finely powdered, or fluid
suspension fuel that flows like a liquid into a core vessel, where it
attains criticality, then out of the core where it becomes subcritical.!l
These reactors have been variously described by their originators as

" "suspension reactors' or

"fluidized reactors," "fluidized-solids reactors,
"moving—-bed reactors." The fuel may be recirculated by a pump or

fluidized by a stream of gas or liquid to pass through a heat exchanger to
a reservoir above the core, thence downward by gravity into the core to
complete the cycle. We have not treated these as "slurry reactors"

because they were not so treated by their originators and because they have

a distinctive fuel-circulation cycle.

ORSORT Concept

In Chapter 4 three fluidized-bed reactor concepts were described.?

' is discussed

The fourth concept, '"Fluidized-Solids Power Breeder Reactor,'
in this chapter, for it has a moving-bed core and a fluidized heat
exchanger. In this reactor, graphite is a moderator in the core and
blanket, uranium-=233 is the fuel, and thorium carbide is the fertile
material. The core is operated as a moving bed, i.e., the solid particles
flow into and out of the core by gravity and at nearly their settled
density. The blanket is a fluidized bed of relatively low void content.
The uranium-impregnated graphite particles flow downward by gravity from
a reservoir into the graphite core tank and become heated by the fission
process. They discharge into a plenum chamber, where they are fluidized
by a stream of argon and circulated to the heat exchanger. After they
lose heat to the steam coils, the gas and solids are separated in a
battery of cyclones, The gas goes to a blower, and the solids discharge
to the cylindrical reservoir. To conserve heat, the heat exchanger is
mounted concentrically in the reservoir, so that any heat escaping serves

to preheat the fuel before it enters the core.

KEMA Reactors and Related Concepts

A similar reactor concept is mentioned by Went and de Bruyn,l but this
reference does not describe the concept further. An expanded description
has been given in a later paper by de Bruyn, v. d. Schee, and Went.3

The reactor vessel is filled with compound grains of beryllium oxide
and uranium dioxide having an atomic ratio of Be/U of about 120. The
distribution of grain size is chosen to ensure a close packing (70-757 by
volume). The mean grain size is about 200-250 pu. The cylindrical vessel
is surrounded by a beryllium oxide reflector 70 em thick. The grains
move by gravity downward through the reactor vessel. By choosing a
suitable geometric form of the bottom of the reactor vessel, a velocity
distribution in the flow of grains down the reactor can be established to
correspond to the buckling of the reactor.

The grains leaving the reactor vessel are transported pneumatically
to a heat exchanger, where the bed of grains is fluidized by a stream of
helium. The gas velocity is adjusted to ensure a moderately boiling
state of the grains. Intensive boiling must be avoided to prevent too
much attrition of the grains., In this boiling bed the degree of packing
will be about 35 percent by volume. After passing through the heat
exchanger, the grains return to the reactor vessel by overflow of the
boiling bed.

Inside the heat exchanger the heat is transferred to water circulating
in the boiler tubes. At 100 kg/cmz, steam at 310°C is produced. Part of
the heat exchanger may be used as a superheater to produce high-quality
steam at 550°C,

The dimensions of the reactor and heat exchanger for a 300-Muw(t)
power reactor were calculated, assuming a maximum temperature of 1200°C for
the grains inside the reactor and 700°C in the boiling bed. The reactor
vessel proper could be 1.85 meters in diameter and 1.85 meters in height
when the maximum flow velocity is limited by the number of delayed
neutrons necessary for smooth regulatioen of the reactivity. The weight of
compound grains (moderator and fuel) inside the reactor is 10.2 tons
beryllium oxide and 0.9 tomns uranium dioxide. The heldup in the heat

exchanger without superheater is 31.5 tons BeO and 2.9 tons UO With

2.

superheating, it is 50.8 tons BeO and 4.7 tons UO, (2-in.-diameter boiller

2
tubes, 1-1/2-in.~-diameter superheater tubes, and a tube spacing of 1-1/2

82
times the tube diameter).

The Netherlands group has noted that nuclear superheating would
probably be too expensive because of the holdup of expensive fuel.
Moderately enriched (about 67%) uranium dioxide must be used. The
conversion ratio is low. Attrition of the costly compound grains will
probably be fairly high, and, therefore, fuel economy will be rather
poor.

Another type of homogeneous reactor” fits the criteria for inclusion
in this chapter. It is a "Homogeneous Liquid Suspension Reactor," in
which the fuel is a suspension of uranium oxide in heavy water moderator.
According to the authors, Went and de Bruyn, a dilute suspension should
be used. Settling of the uranium oxide particles might disturb the homo-
geneous distribution of the uranium in the reactor. Rotating or vibrating
stirrers should not be inside the reactor for homogenizing the suspension,
because, inside the reactor, no moving parts that cannot be repaired
easily should be used.

In the most reliable methed of homogenization, the reactor is
divided into two regions: (a) a thin upper compartment, in which a
vibromixer or--still better--an injection system, produces a turbulent
complete mixing of the suspension; and (b) the reaction chamber proper,
which is separated from the upper compartment by a system of vertical
partitions, to suppress all horizontal movement. Thus, in the reactor,
vertical settling motion predominates. The downward movement of the
water coclant assists this downward flow of the suspension.

The temperature of the reactor contents is about 250° to 300°C; the
corresponding pressure is 35 to 80 atmospheres. These high pressures
require that the wall thickness of the pressure tank containing the
reactor be so great that neutron losses due to capture would become
inadmissibly high, unless a reflector is built into the reactor vessel.
To avoid contamination of the reflector by fission products, beryllium
oxide is used instead of graphite.

The authors claim that, because of the ideal heat contact between
the fuel and the heavy water, this type of reactor has automatic internal
reactivity adjustment. The absence of internal construction parts will
decrease the neutron loss; therefore the conversion factor will be high.,

Two important problems——the uranium concentration needed to make the

83
reactor relatively insensitive to small fluctuations in concentration,
and the dilution with thorium-232 when uranium-23;=is being gradually
replaced by plutonium-239--are only mentioned.

The heated suspension discharges into tubes at the bottom of the
reactor and feeds by gravity into a heat exchanger. From there it enters
a sump, from which it is lifted by a gas-lift pump to a gas separator above
the reactor. The solid and liquid may be either separated and stored or
fed back into the reactor.

A somewhat similar concept is described in a German patent application.5
This application is chiefly concerned with the composition of the fuel
particles, but the first claim suggests that the reactor operates in much
the same way as the ORSORT Fluidized Power Reactor or the Homogeneous Dry
Suspension Reactor.? 1In other words, the particles flow by gravity through
the reaction zone and are transported to and through the heat exchanger
by a gas stream (gas-1ift pump). The particles, granular and preferably
spherical, are between 50 and 300 p in diameter, preferably about 175 u.

In addition to fissionable material, they contain a "heat-carrier" of low
neutron-absorption cross section such as bismuth, magnesium, lead,
phosphorus, lithium, zirconium, aluminum, or their compounds, especially
oxides. In addition, for a homogeneous thermal reactor, the particles
will contain a moderator such as beryllium oxide. A fertile material,
such as uranium-238 or thorium, may alsc be included. Fast reactors

with no moderator in the particles are also possible. Besides metallic
systems, oxide or carbide systems may be used--e.g., uranium dioxide,
beryllium oxide, and thorium oxide and an oxide heat carrier with a
beryllium oxide reflector; or uranium carbide, beryllium carbide, thorium
carbide with a carbide heat carrier and a graphite reflector. The only
limitation is that the substances must not react chemically. The particles
may be spongy (prepared by partial sintering) to permit easy removal of

fission products.

BNL Chemonuclear Reactor

Steinberg et al have proposed several designs for nuclear reactors to
promote chemical reactions (chemonuclear reactors). They are intended to
utilize the large amounts of energy released in a reactor through fission

fragments. One such reactor, which is a fluidized reactor, is used to

*
Author's statement in reference. Presumably, it should be U233.

84
synthesize nitrogen tetroxide from nitrogen and oxygen.6’7 The fuel is
U308 as a dust, which is fluidized by the mixture of reactant gases. The
gases carry the dust into the spherical reactor, which is surrounded by

a reflector-moderator of graphite. After leaving the reactor the dust and
gases pass through cyclones to remove the bulk of the dust, which is
refluidized and returned to the reactor, and through heat exchangers.

The cooled gas is also recycled to the reactor. A fraction of the gas is
treated in cyclones to remove the remaining dust, and the product is
separated by condensation. Some of the features that need study are:
erosion by the dust, dynamic instability of circulating dust systems,
possible difficulties in control, and high costs. 700 Mw(t) of by-product

power is produced.

Chapter 6 Paste-~Fuel Reactors

"paste"

According to the Reactor Classification System (Appendix B), a
is a two-phase mixture of small, usually spherical, particles dispersed in
a liquid at approximately the settled value of 607 by volume of solids,
These two-phase fuel systems are thus distinguished from slurries, in
which particles are dispersed in a liquid by fluid-dynamic forces. Although
stiff and viscous, such a paste will flow slowly under gravitational forces.
Thus, if the solid particles are fuel or fuel-moderator material and the
liquid is a reactor ccolant, a paste-fuel reactor can be designed., A
paste~fuel reactor could also be termed a "moving-settled-bed reactor."

One reactor described in another chapter, fits this definitiom,
although it was not designated a paste-fuel reactor by its originators.
The "Heterogeneous Liquid Medium Suspension Reactor'" of the Netherlands
FOM-KEMA Reactor Development Group (see Chapter 7, Reference 25) uses a
fully settled suspension of uranium oxide in heavy water as a fuel. This
reactor, however, was treated as a reactor with particulate fuel elements
because of its core design--a plurality of tubes containing the settled

suspension fuel in a tank of heavy water, It will be compared with the

paste—fuel reactors described in this chapter.

APDA Concepts

Atomic Power Development Associates, Inc. (APDA) has been investigating
the paste-fuel concept since 1955.! The reactor design evolved from the
interest in "a liquid-metal-cooled, fast neutron, breeder reactor, employing
a high burnup fuel, with low inventory and minimum fuel and blanket
fabrication" to give low-cost nuclear power. The reactor should use mobile
fuels and blankets that would move continuocusly into and out of the reactor
during full-power operation and would be reprocessed and fabricated on the
site in an integrated facility. The core should be internally cooled by
a separate cooling system because transporting the mobile fuel through an
external heat exchanger to remove all of the reactor heat would result in
prohibitively large fuel inventories. Consideration of these wvarious
requirements led to the concept of using pastes for the fuel and blanket
material. Aside from the core itself, the major components of the paste-
fueled reactor power plant are almost identical with the corresponding

components of existing solid-fueled fast reactors, and they are arranged

95
similarly. Thus, the major problems in development concern the core and the
fuel and blanket material.

In one conceptual design of a paste-fuel reactor, the fuel and blanket
consist of small spherical particles, containing fissionable or fertile
material, settled in a liquid metal.! The concentration of solids in the
paste is maintained at the settled density of approximately 60 percent by
volume of solids, irrespective of paste movement. A dilute slurry of fuel
particles in liquid metal is fed to a cyclone separator at the top of the
core. Concentrated paste from the separator is introduced into the top of
each fuel subassembly and flows slowly down through the small passages
formed by the spacing between the coolant tubes. In an alternative
arrangement, paste is in the tubes and coolant is in the surrounding space.
The bottom portion of each subassembly is conical. Paste flows through
orifices in this portion into an eductor. Carrier liquid (sodium), which
is introduced into a central pipe in each subassembly connected to the
eductor, dilutes the paste and fluidizes the particles, which are then
carried out to the processing cell adjacent to the reactor vessel. A
portion of the fuel particles is reprocessed. Oversized particles, which
might result from the sintering of several particles or swelling under
irradiation, are screened out, The remaining fuel particles, together with
fresh particles, return in a slurry to the reactor vessel and to the
cyclone separator, completing the circuit. Sodium coolant is introduced at
the bottom of the core and flows upward through the coolant tubes.

This system is distinguished by several features, which, according to
the originators, appear to have overcome the principal technological
obstacles that have impeded the successful development of other mobile~fueled
reactors. Most notable are:

a. Fuel is not used to transport heat from the reactor. Thus, small
volumes of fuel can be moved external to the reactor--as well as
in the reactor--at very low velocities.

b. The use of a noncorrosive liquid metal, like sodium, to transport
the fuel and blanket particles largely eliminates problems of
container corrosion and mass transport.

c. The low velocities of the fuel minimize the erosion of containers
by the particles and breakdown of particles by attritionm.

d. Loss of pumping power does not affect fuel concentration in the

96
dynamically stable paste-fuel system, in which fuel particles are

at settled density in the reactor core,
The paste—-fuel system is claimed to have several advantages when compared
with static bed systems, in which no throughput of fuel is involved. A
paste-~fuel system allows homogenized burnup and breeding by the continuous
removal of fission gases. These features should allow higher mean burnups
and breeding ratios than other systems. Further, clogging of the bed by
fission gases should cause less difficulty in the paste-fuel system,
because only the gases released in a single pass through the core are of
concern.

According to the APDA workers, the paste-fuel concept retains all the
advantages expected of mobile-fueled reactors over conventional solid-fuel
systems. These advantages include: increased resistance of fuel to
irradiation damage and dimensional change; easier fabrication of fuel and
blanket; simplified loading and unloading of reactor, which can be a
continuous on-site operation; and simplification and improvement in
performance of some nonfuel portions of the reactor complex.

As the design of a core structure depends upon the flow characteristics
of pastes under various conditions, an analytical and research program
is under way.!*? The effect of evolution of fission gas on paste

circulation may be a problem.?3

Los Alamos Concept

The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory has also considered paste-~fuel
reactors in connection with studies of mobile-fuel fast plutonium breeders.*s2s°
The fuel-circulation cycle is very similar to that proposed by APDA,! but the

fuel is a paste of uranium dioxide and plutonium dioxide in sodium.

KEMA Reactor

The fuel-circulation cycle of the paste-fuel reactors is very much like
that of the "Heterogeneous Liquid Medium Suspension Reactor' of the
Netherlands FOM-KEMA Reactor Development Group (Chapter 7). In all of these
concepts a fully settled suspension of fuel particles in liquid moves
slowly down the fuel passages under the force of gravity, is diluted just
below the core by a stream of the pure liquid, and is raised--as a dilute
suspension or slurry--by a gas lift or slurry-circulating pump to the top of

the core., Here the suspension is concentrated to the fully settled condition

97
by a cyclone or hydroclone.

However, the reactor of the Netherlands Group and the paste-fuel reactors
differ significantly in two ways. First, the Netherlands reactor is a thermal
reactor and uses heavy water as a moderator between the fuel tubes and as a
suspension medium for the fuel, On the other hand, the paste-fuel reactors
are fast reactors, use no moderator, and employ sodium as the coolant and
suspension medium. Thus the reactors differ because of the difference in
hydrodynamic and heat-transfer properties between heavy water and sodium.
Secondly, in the Netherlands reactor the heavy water does not function as a
coolant—--the fuel tubes are thermally insulated from the moderator in the
tank. Heat is transferred by the settled suspension, which, after dilutionm,
flows through the heat exchanger. 1In the paste-fuel reactor the sodium
coolant flows upward through tubes spaced throughout the paste; because of
its excellent heat-transfer properties, and because of its use as the
suspension medium, the temperature difference between paste and coolant is
lowered. The sodium alone flows through the heat exchanger. Furthermore,
the sodium coolant can circulate at a high velocity, thus increasing the
rate of heat transfer, and the slow movement of the paste in the opposite

direction is no disadvantage.

Evaluation and Status

A study of cost and parameter optimization on a paste-~fueled reactor
was carried out by Zetterbaum and Kerlin of Atomics International.’ The
reference design was an unmoderated sodium-cooled reactor with a paste fuel
of uranium monocarbide in sodium. The core was surrounded by an 18-inch
radial breeding blanket containing uranium monocarbide and sodium, which
in turn was surrounded by an 18-inch-thick graphite reflector. The study
showed that a high fuel-volume fraction was desirable because of the cost.
The blanket composition affected the breeding ratio only; to increase this
ratio, a high volume fraction of fertile material was desirable. Metallic
fuel (uranium or uranium-plutonium) has better nuclear properties-—-higher
density-~but uranium carbide has better physical properties. Tin or lead
could replace sodium with only a very slight change in the nuclear
properties. A large reactor——704 Mw(t); 300 Mw(e)-~was visualized.

An agreement of association has been concluded between Italy's

National Committee on Nuclear Energy (CNEN) and Euratom for the preliminary
development of the RAPTUS (Fast Thorium~Uranium-Sodium) fast-reactor
concept. In this reactor, a paste fuel would be used. The agreement is
for 3-1/2 years.® The fuel for the sodium-cooled reactor would be a paste
of uranium-233 and thorium oxide in sodium, and the core is similar to
those of APDA. 1t would consist of several subassemblies resembling
tube-type heat exchangers. The sodium coolant flows through the tubes
and the paste fuel is held in the containing shell. CNEN believes that
this approach may ultimately lead to design of a practical power reactor
having such advantages as very high burnup and low costs of fuel
manufacture. The schedule includes solving basic questions of feasibility
by 1965 and experimental testing of the design by 1967. Financing
difficulties and the need for appreciable amounts of uranium-233, which is
not readily available, may hinder this development program.

The few paste-fuel concepts developed to date and the present early
stages of such developments show that considerably more work probably
will be required before the paste-fuel concept can be considered for

commercial development.

Chapter 7 Reactors with Particulate Fuel Elements

In the concepts described in the preceding chapters, the reactor cores
are relatively homogeneous toward neutrons, i.e., they do not contain well-
defined zones or regions characterized as fuel and moderator zones
respectively. The fuel or fuel-moderator is particulate, of fineness from
microns to more than one half an inch in diameter.

However, there are other reactors with particulate fuel disposed in a
well-defined moderator structure. The fuel may be in holes or tubes in
the moderator, the fuel and moderator may be in alternate slabs, or the
moderator may be in shaped bodies in the fuel. In order not to subdivide
our classification too far, we will include in this chapter reactors with
"fuel elements" composed of packed beds, fluidized beds, or pastes, as
well as those reactors, similar to fluidized or moving-bed reactors, with
solid particulate fuel that circulates through tubes or between slabs of
moderator material and carries the fission-generated heat to an external
heat exchanger. The concepts, except for the earliest, will be discussed
under these classifications. 1In addition, the concepts using granular

coolants will be described.

Early Concepts

In the very early days of the Manhattan Project (1942), Zinn suggested
cooling the pile by circulating continuous ''chains'" of uranium-graphite
or uranium dioxide-graphite cartridges linked together so that the chains
would be flexible. The units were to move at three feet per second and
would be cooled outside the pile.1

Later in the same year, Wheeler suggested a pile cooled by circulating
uranium shot (BB Shot Pile)., The pile was to be a large block of graphite
and the uranium shot was to be circulated by gravity, presumably from a
reservoir at the top of the pile to a container at the bottom. The shot
could be returned by an air blast or by buckets,2”?
There was some concern about erosion of the graphite by the uranium

4 carried out experiments in which No. 8 steel shot (about

balls. Simon
2 mm diameter) was fed from a hopper into a hole, 1-3/8 in. diameter, in
a 4 in. by 4 in. by 15 in. graphite block at a rate of about 3/4 cu ft/sq
ft/sec. The only effect on the graphite was a very slight polishing effect.

No further work, however, seems to have been done.

107
A related concept proposed by Wheeler resulted in a U. S. patent.® 1In
this concept the uranium shot does not circulate, although it can be charged
from above or discharged at the bottom of the piles for reprocessing. It
is contained in a plurality of pipes that extend through the graphite
blocks and serve to hold the blocks together. The reactor core is contained
in a gas-tight pressure vessel, and the reactor is cooled with helium.

Another concept in which the reactor is fueled and cooled by particulate
solid, is the UO

Powder Pile or Low Density UO, Pile proposed by Ibser in

1943.7 1In this ioncept, uranium dioxide powderzdispersed in helium is
circulated or blown through pipes in a graphite matrix., Criticality
calculations were made, but no further work was done on this concept.

A pile using a flowing stream of graphite balls as a coolant was
proposed by Daniels in 1947.8 Based on the description, a patent application
was filed November 15, 1950, and U. S. Patent No. 2,910,416 was issued.’

The reactor is a four~foot cube of graphite surrounded by a one-foot graphite
reflector and one foot of insulation. There are 36 channels per square

foot in the core and four per square foot in the reflector. Alternate core
channels are for heating and for cooling. In the heating channels, the balls
are impregnated with uranium and move very slowly, only fast enough for
reprocessing. As described in the patent, the fuel balls do not move
continuously but are charged and discharged individually. The cooling balls,
which are unimpregnated graphite, move more rapidly, being returned by an

air blast or elevator buckets. The hot balls transfer their heat to gas

for a gas turbine, or alternatively to a beiler and steam turbine. A

12- to 20-Mw device was visualized, with a temperature rise of 500°C across
the pile and a maximum temperature of 760-2000°C.

Two modifications of this concept are described in the patent. In one,
all of the refractory balls are unfueled, and the fissionable material is
contained in the graphite bricks. This modification does not qualify as
a particulate-fuel-element reactor and the data sheet is included in
another chapter. In another modification, the fissionable material is
contained in both the bricks and the fuel balls.

These concepts have a conversion zone between the reactor and the
reflector. In one modification described in the patent, the fertile material
is contained in balls in the conversion zone; a mechanism is provided for

transferring the fertile balls to the reactor core when conversion has

108
proceeded to a sufficient degree.

Packed-Bed Reactors

In 1953, students in the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology
described a Uranium Pellet Power Reactor, a sodium~cooled thermal reactor. 0
The reactor core is a cylinder (radius 5.7 ft, height 10 ft) surrounded by
a 9 in. reflector and a 3/4-in. steel core tank. The reactor core is
made up of high-density beryllium blocks of hexagonal cross section.

Each block 1s compound: an inner hexagonal block with a central hole is
disposed within an outer hexagonal block. The inner block is approximately
3-3/4 in. across flats, the outer, 5-3/4 in. The hole in the inner block
is approximately 2-3/8 in. in diameter and the inner surface has 24
narrow axial slots. In the center of this hole is a stainless-steel tube
made of screening wrapped around crossed ribs for stiffening. The tube is
approximately 0.8 in. in diameter, and the annulus between it and the
inner surface of the block is filled with 3/16-in. pellets of uranium
dioxide. Sodium flows upward through the tube, the pellet bed, and the
slots, but the flow is controlled in six regions by modifying the tube

and slots so as to decrease the flow rate from the center to the outside
of the core. The purpose is to make the temperature drop uniform across
the core. This concept was for a large reactor, 356 Mw(t), 120 Mw(e).

Glass fibers containing uranium or plutonium were suggested by
Harteck, Dondes, and Michener!! in 1956 as fuels or fertile material for
reactors. Some of the advantages they listed are: better heat transfer
than other fuels, stability under irradiation, greater efficiency of
utilization of recoil energies than with fine powders, high tensile
strength, resistance to corrosion, ease of manufacture, and simple re-
processing.

Glasses with softening points approaching 1000°C and with uranium
contents up to 30 percent of fissionable material are claimed to be
possible. The glass fuel can be also made into rods, tubes, batting, tape,
or cloth. The authors suggested making a plate fuel element by incorpora-
ting glass fibers of high melting point (1000°C) into the interior of
aluminum fuel elements. The glass fuels can be made with no special
difficulties. Tests made on glass containing about 10 percent U308
demonstrated that the fibers had good stability under irradiation, high

utilization of recoil energy, and good tensile strength under irradiatiom.

109
Among the general application suggested for glass fuels were reactors
for chemical conversion. Some such reactors have particulate fuel elements.
A chemonuclear reactor utilizing glass fibers as fuel has been

12

proposed by Lellouche and Steinberg at Brookhaven. The fibers containing

enriched U308 are held in cylindrical metal cages, which are set in
vertical channels within a graphite moderator. Each channel contains 56
fuel assemblies set one above another. An annular space allows the
coolant gas, air, to pass through. The process gas, also air, passes
through the fuel assemblies and out of the reactor. Most of it is
recycled, and the remainder is treated to remove fission products and to
separate the acids formed by the chemonuclear reaction. The coolant air,
after leaving the reactor, is used as a source of steam for power. The
reactor produces 147 Mw(t), 40 Mw(e).

A concept for a design for a settled-bed heterogeneous reactor in
which fuel pellets could be charged and discharged during operation was
proposed in 1960 by Barnard.!® Advantages of refueling under load include
less weight and volume because of lower inventory of idle fuel, ease and
speed of refueling, and reduction of excess reactivity. In the reactor
concept described, spheres of uranium metal, 0.25-0.75 in. diameter, are
held within vertically aligned tubes separated vertically into zones.

Two streams of organic coolant are used. One flows downward inside the
tubes in annuli between the pellets and the inner wall of the tubes,

The other flows outside the tubes acreoss the core radially from the core
periphery. The use of two streams should have such advantages as more
precise control and greater safety. Exhausted fuel particles are discharged
from the bottom of the reactor by removing stops to allow the lowest fuel
units to drop out. New pellets are added at the top. The process can be
more or less continuous,

A packed-bed fuel element for a gas-cooled reactor was described by
Ristié and Zarié.!" The fuel element consists of a packed-~bed core about
10 em in diameter in the center of a cylindrical tube. The core is made
up of individual ceramic spheres or pellets (of uranium oxide or carbide)
each about 1 cm in diameter. The cooling gas flows mainly through the
annular space between the packed-bed core and the wall and partly through

the core itself. There is no partition between the annular space and the

core; the stability of the central column is secured, for example, by axial

110
fins inside the tube.

Heat-transfer calculations show that the thermal conductivity of the
packed bed is several times greater than that of a solid ceramic because
of the high turbulence of the gas flowing in the core. Alsc the heat
generated in the core is transferred directly to the main body of gas in
the annulus, further improving the radial heat transfer coefficient.

No complete reactor based on this fuel element was designed.

We have classified two reactors, described by a group at Brookhaven,!>=17
as particulate fuel-element reactors, although the "elements" are really
regions of fuel between blocks or slabs of moderator.

The first of these is the UO,-Sodium~Graphite Thermal Reactor. 1In

this reactor there are hexagonal ioderator logs of graphite (7 in. across
flats) located in a 10 ft diameter by 10 ft high settled fuel bed of
uranium dioxide in sodium. The 217 graphite moderator logs are spaced
approximately 0.6 in. between flats, and have two sets of cladding, the
inner cladding flat and tight against the graphite, and the outer cladding
vertically corrugated. The outer cladding is spot welded to the inner
cladding on vertical centers. Sodium coolant flows in the corrugated
channels between the inner and outer cladding. The granular fuel,

75=100 p particles of uranium dioxide in sodium, is charged in the
fluidized condition and allowed to form a settled bed between the
moderator logs. The fuel is thus a single continuous region and the
structure may be described as moderator-coolant or moderator-heat-exchanger
elements, so that the ordinary relation of fuel and moderator is reversed.
This concept is designed as an 850 Mw(t) reactor.

The other reactor is the U233—Li7—BeO Thermal Breeder Reactor. This

reactor, operated on the U233—thorium cycle, is moderated by slabs of
beryllium oxide and cooled by lithium-7. The 10 ft by 10 ft reactor core
consists of 28 unclad beryllium oxide moderator blocks arranged to form
parallel slabs. Coolant U-tubes and fuel occupy the spaces between
moderator slabs. As lithium is compatible with beryllium oxide, no
cladding is needed. The 100 p granular fuel is a mixed oxide of
uranium-233 and thorium. It is fluidized in lithium-7 for charging and

discharging but allowed to form a settled bed during reactor operation.

This concept is also designed as a 850 Mw(t) reactor.

111
Fluidized-Bed and Fluidized Reactors

An early concept in which a fluidized reactor is used with an internal
moderator is a design by Murphree. The design was disclosed in a Canadian
patent dated 1962 with a U. S. priority date of 1944.18 The fuel, a 50-100
mesh powder, is preferably uranium metal, although UO2 or U308 are also
specified. The fuel is fluidized by helium or other gas within tubes
surrounded by packed beds of graphite moderator particles. In a
modification, heavy or light water surrounds the tube as moderator and is
circulated for heat removal. The gaseous suspension leaves the reactor,
goes to dust separator, to heat exchangers, and back to the reactor.

Workers at Brookhaven have performed studies on reactors with
fluidized or fluidizable fuel elements. In the Fluidized Solids Fueled
Reactor,ld l4~-ft-long blocks of zirconium-clad graphite moderator of
square cross section are installed vertically in the core 1 in. apart.

The fuel is uranium dioxide in particles (75 to 100 u) fluidized with
sodium in the space between the moderator blocks. Zirconium tubes for
sodium coclant, between the blocks, cool the fluidized fuel.

An economic study to compare the proposed fluidized-fuel-element
reactor with the Hallam Sodium Graphite Reactor was made by a group at
Brookhaven.?9221 According to the authors of the report:

"for purposes of the evaluation study the design is based on

the use of uranium dioxide as a fuel in the form of uniform, and

preferably spherical, particles of UO 75 to 100 microns in

s
diameter, fluidized in liquid sodium.2 The fuel suspension is
confined within the annular space between two concentric cylinders
suitably joined to form a fuel element of which there is a
multiplicity for a reactor core. The reactor is cooled with liquid
Na and moderated with graphite. The design power level is 200 Mwt
and 80 Mwe.

"The fuel element subassembly consists of a central canned
graphite moderator log within a stainless steel tube containing
flowing sodium coolant. A second stainless steel tube is disposed
outside the first tube, the annulus between being filled with the
fluidized fuel. A third stainless steel tube is disposed outside
the second tube, the annulus between containing flowing sodium

coolant. The fuel element subassemblies are arranged in a

112
triangular pitch lattice. Spaces between the outer tubes are

filled with canned triangular graphite blocks. The design core was

12 ft. diameter by 14 ft.-6 in. high, and contained 52 fuel element

subassemblies. Physics and engineering calculations were made

as well as technical and economic comparisons with the Hallam

Title I design."

A later development of this type is the laminar fluidized-bed reactor
of W. A. Robba gg_gl.zz In it also, the core is a continuous fluidized
bed of a suspension of uranium dioxide particles in liquid sodium that
fills the spaces between square moderator blocks of graphite. The coolant
sodium flows through U-tubes in spaces between the moderator blocks.

The laminar, or subturbulent, fluidizing flow is maintained with
relatively low rates of flow; in this reactor the nominal rate is 40 gpm.
The separate coolant flow permits this low rate of fluidizing flow. The
power produced is 300 Mw(e).

The Brookhaven workers have continued the studies on large power
reactor systems using particulate fuels. A preliminary evaluation report
was written in 1961,!° but it was not published. A status report was
published in 1962.1® One of the reactors described could be operated
either as a fluidized-bed reactor (see Chapter 4) or as a settled-bed
reactor (see Chapter 3).

A fluidized-bed reactor was proposed by Kim?3 for synthesizing
nitric acid. The reactor vessel resembles a shell-and-tube heat exchanger.
The fuel, slightly enriched uranium dioxide as 0.006 in. particles, is
fluidized by the reactant gases, nitrogen and oxygen, inside the tubes.
Boiling water, the coolant, is on the shell side. The gases enter the
tubes, fluidize the fuel, and leave through a manifold at the top. They
are processed to remove nitric acid and are recycled to the reactor.

A "Vapor-Slurry Reactor" was suggested by Crowther in 1955.2% In
this fluidized reactor, enriched particles of uranium dioxide are slurried
with steam and passed through tubes in the reactor core. The tubes are
surrounded by bricks of beryllium oxide moderator. The particles are
heated and the steam superheated in the core. Part of the hot slurry is
recycled to vaporize incoming water. The steam, after separation of
particles in a cyclone, goes to turbines and then to condensers. An

advantage of the reactor is that outlet temperatures of the coolant are

113
not limited by pressure, so that turbines designed for high throttle inlet
pressure and temperatures can be used.

Two related reactors suggested in the same article are the Cyclone
Slurry Reactor and a reactor consisting of a heterogeneous array of screw
conveyers that move fuel particles through a critical assembly. In the
cyclone reactor, solid fuel particles are whirled at high velocity through
the core by a tangential stream of secondary vapeor. The particles are
thrown to the outside of the core. There they form a rapidly moving dense
layer in which fission can occur. This concept would have the advantages
of simplicity and high power density. In the reactor with the screw
conveyers, the solids are carried to the reactor by gas or vapor and
removed from it by the gas to produce power. Thus large quantities of the
gas would not flow through the reactor.

In the Heterogeneous Fluidized Uranium Oxide Reactor,25 described by
workers of the Netherlands FOM-KEMA Reactor Development Group, the dry
uranium oxide particles

"move in a vertical direction through tubes placed in a reactor

tank containing heavy water. Their movement resembles that of

sand in a sandglass. In this way a moving bed or liquid-expanded

state is obtained...with the aid of a vibrating cone the oxide

particles leaving the reactor are fluidized, and a preheated gas

stream transports the particles through the heat exchanger to the

cyclones in which a separation of particles and gas is executed."
The reactor tubes are made of nonporous beryllium oxide, insulated with
porous BeO,

The Heterogeneous 'Dry" Suspension Reactor2® resembles the Heterogeneous
Fluidized Uranium Oxide Reactor, but the engineering design is carried
somewhat further, with various numerical values being given for system
parameters. The reactor vessel contains graphite fuel tubes in a heavy
water moderator and its core is surrounded by a graphite reflector. TFor a
300-Mw(t) reactor a vessel 3.4 meters by 2.5 meters high is used. The heat
exchanger, which is "built around" the reactor, contains boiler and super-
heater sections, and when filled with uranium oxide, acts as a gamma shield.
However, the holdup of uranium oxide is large.

The uranium oxide grains (250 p in diameter) move downward through the

tubes. As the heat conductivity is low, only about 2 percent of the heat is

114
lost to the heavy water. At the bottom of the reactor the hot uranium
grains are transferred to a stream of helium, which carries them to the
heat exchanger. Inside the heat exchanger the bed of grains is fluidized
as a boiling bed (average temperature 700°C). The steam is superheated

to 550°C. About 25 tons of uranium dioxide are required inside the reactor
and 150 tons in the heat exchanger and piping.

The Flowable Solids Reactor,?7:28 proposed by Oliver et al of the
Fluor Corporation, Ltd., resembles the reactors designed by the FOM-KEMA
group. However, this reactor uses a graphite moderator with 3-inch fuel
channels that have ceramic liners. The fuel, dry crushed fused uranium
dioxide in the form of a powder (average particle size 200 p), flows by
gravity down the fuel channels (orificed to control flow). It then cascades
over steam generator tubes located in a chamber directly below the reactor.
This heat exchanger has horizontal tubes on a triangular pitch with
superheater, boiler, and preheater sections. The fuel material is
recycled to the top of the reactor core by a mechanical conveyor.

A very different fuel is used in the "Armour Dust Fueled Reactor" of
Krukoff et al, but we have classified it as a particulate fuel element
reactor because of the core structure.?9 3% A "dust" is defined as a
dispersion in a gas of solid particles ranging in size from submicro-
scopic to macroscopic.36

The Armour Dust Fueled Reactor uses an aerosol-type gas suspension
of fissionable dust as a reactor fuel., There are two variants--a
uranium dioxide fuel dust in carbon dioxide gas with a beryllium oxide
moderator (oxide system), and a uranium carbide fuel dust in helium gas
with a graphite moderator (carbide system). In both variants the dust
particles are 8 to 10 p in diameter and are blown upward through the
Yeactor core.

In the carbide system the ducts and chambers in contact with the
fuel are lined with silicon carbide; in the oxide system the lining is
aluminum oxide. The gas suspension of dust circulates through a cyclone--
to remove the larger abrasive particles-—-and a heat exchanger, and it is
returned tc the system by a blower. A side stream circulates through a
system for fission-product cleanup.

An internally cooled core for this reactor has also been considered

because the primary loop would be non-radiocactive. This would give ease of

115
maintenance and reduced fuel inventory. The core resembles a shell-and-tube
heat exchanger, with the gas containing fuel on one side and pure gas on

the other. The fuel is circulated at low velocity through the core and the
system for fission-product cleanup. The pure gas, which serves as a
coolant, is circulated at high velocity through the core and the remainder
of the primary loop. The core tubes are constructed of moderator material
for high neutron economy. Power density is more limited than for the
externally cooled reactor, but, because of the high operating temperatures,
it compares very favorably with other gas—cooled reactors.

Reactor physics and engineering calculations have been carried out, and
loop experiments have been made, but the reactor concept has not been
carried further.

The major potential advantages of the ADFR are stated to be:

a. High temperatures. Temperatures of 2000°-3000°F are stated to be

obtainable.

b. Reduced corrosion. The carrier gas comprises more than 99.9

percent of the volume of the fuel. There is little of the dust
to cause corrosion or erosion.

c. Low-cost reprocessing. The carrier gas is easily separated from

the fuel. Fission gases are absorbed in a charcoal bed. Thus
only the fuel and solid fission fragments need to be chemically
processed.

d. High neutron economy. There are very few neutron poisons because

there are no control rods, no fuel-element matrix, and no cladding
or structural material. Breeding seems assured with the Th-~U233
cycle.
A dust-fueled chemonuclear reactor was proposed by Steinberg et al, 3738

The dust consists of highly enriched U The reactor is internally moderated

with graphite logs coated with silicon carbide. The dust is carried into the
reactor by a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, which react to form nitrogen dioxide.
The gaseous suspension leaves the reactor, where the bulk of the dust is
separated, the gases pass through heat exchangers, and a part of the gas is
treated to recover product. Both the dust, after being refluidized, and

the major portion of the gas, after heat exchange, are recycled to the reactor.

A proposal for an advanced concept was made by W. R. Corliss for a

Circulating Dust-Fueled, Radiation-Cooled Space Power Reactor.3? This

116
scheme 1is

"in reality a fusion of two well-known concepts, the Armour Dust-Fueled

Reactor (ADFR) and the radiation-cooled reactor allied with a shell of

direct conversion elements. The resulting synthesis is a circulating

dust-fueled system which radiates the energy generated in the
fissionable dust to a shell of thermionic converters, where conversion
to electricity takes place."

A fuel of U02 or PuC dust is proposed to replace the usual heat-transfer
liquids and gases with a flowing solid. Moderator and reflector material is
graphite, with the dust traveling in cavities or ducts in the graphite. A
shell of thermionic converters makes up the walls of the ducts.

The design is stated to be suitable for power plants between 100 kw(e)
and 10 Mw(e). Engineering parameters for a 1-Mw(e) design have been given.
Technology as of 1980 might be required. The core radius is 3 ft and core
length 10 ft. An electrostatic pump is used to circulate the dust, which
is electrically charged.

A particulate fuel, one stage finer than '"dust,'" might be called

' and a "Smoke Fueled Reactor" was proposed by Aerojet General

"smoke,'
Nucleonics in 1959.%40 The reactor was entitled the '"Nuclear Nitrogen
Fixation Reactor" by its originators, but we have renamed it as above to
describe the reactor in terms of its fuel. The reactor system is described
in the Appendix to the report. The "smoke' consists of 1-2 pu particles of
fully enriched oxides of uranium suspended in the process gas, a 4:1
nitrogen-oxygen mixture at 1000 psi and 200°C. Fission fragments are
liberated directly in the process gas as it passes through the reactor
core, causing a chemonuclear reaction, which results in the formation of
nitrogen dioxide. The core of the reactor is a tank of heavy water and the
gas and smoke enter a manifold from which 200 zirconium tubes exit. Each
tube makes 16 passes through the reactor and connects to an outlet
manifold. About 90 percent of the fuel is recovered unreacted in the
separation section outside the reactor. Most of the fission heat is

liberated in the heavy water moderator and dumped to a cooling tower.

Paste-Fueled Reactor

The "Heterogeneous' Suspension Reactors,*® described by members of the

Netherlands FOM-KEMA Reactor Development Group, fall within the scope of

117
this chapter, for they have particulate fuel elements.

The Heterogeneous Liquid Medium Suspension Reactor?® uses a fully settled
suspension of uranium oxide in a plurality of tubes in a reactor tank filled
with heavy water. Thus it is a type of paste-fueled reactor. The settled
suspension is very viscous and moves slowly down the tubes; as it leaves the
reactor, it is diluted with heavy water so that it can easily flow through
the external heat exchanger just below the reactor. The suspension is lifted
to the top of the reactor by a gas lift pump, and concentrated by a cyclone
before it again enters the reactor tubes. It 1is planned to make these tubes
of beryllium oxide, an inner nonporous tube surrounded by a porous outer tube

for insulation.

Granular Coolants

In 1942, Lewis gg_glﬁl discussed the use of a suspension of graphite
powder as a coolant. The suspension would be circulated upward through the
pile and then to a heat exchanger. The powder might be separated in a
cyclone, and the gas and powder recycled.

Later, Schluderberg and others at Babcock and Wilcox also advocated the
use of such suspensions as coolants.%2”%* A typical suspension consists of
fine particles of graphite in such gases as nitrogen, helium, or carbon
dioxide. Experiments were made in a heat-transfer loop at a fluid velocity
of up to 250 ft/sec, a fluid density of up to 10 1lb/cu ft, and a maximum
temperature and pressure of 1100°F and 140 psig. Adding the graphite
improved the heat-transfer properties of the gas. Heat-transfer coefficients
of 3000 Btu/(sq ft) (°F) (hr) were obtained with helium-graphite mixtures.
Turbulence promoters allowed optimum heat transfer. The increase in heat
transfer over that of gases and the possibility of collecting and removing
fission gases and other impurities‘froguthe coolant system are two of the
advantages the authors give for advocating further development of the concept.

Another method of using granular coolants has been suggested by

within a housing. They are both surrounded by a bed of granular coolant--
graphite, silicon carbide, aluminum, or zirconium—--and they are separated

only by the coolant. The heat exchanger is connected to an engine or turbine.
The housing is rotated on its vertical axis by an electric motor to move the
particles. The rotation transfers coolant material heated at the reactor to

the heat exchanger and moves cooled solids from the heat exchanger to the

reactor for cooling and moderating it.

References: CL-FD-42; U.S. Patent 2,910,416.

Originator: Farrington Daniels.

Status: Conceptual design, 1947; no further work.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, converter. Fuel: wuranium.
Moderator: graphite. Reactor is 4 ft cube of graphite, with 1 ft
graphite reflector and 1 ft insulation between reflector and shield.
There are 36 channels per sq ft In the core and 4 per sq ft in the
reflector, or as described in the patent, in a conversion zone between
the core and reflector. In the core, alternate channels contain uranium-
impregnated graphite balls and unfueled balls. 1In the conversion zone,
alternate channels contain balls impregnated with fertile material and
unimpregnated balls. The unloaded graphite balls circulate rapidly by
gravity and are returned by an air blast. Outside the reactor they
exchange heat with a working fluid to drive a gas or steam turbine

and produce power. The fueled balls are discharged one at a time for
reprocessing; the fertile balls, when sufficiently converted, are charged
one at a time into fuel channels.

BNL

References: BNL-574(T-157), pp. 12 ff.

Originators: G. Lellouche and Meyer Steinberg.

Status: Proposed design, 1962.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, converter. Fuel: U308
(partially enriched) in 1 p glass fibers containing 50 wt.Z uranium.
Moderator: graphite blocks. Coolant: air. Reactor contained in gas-
tight shell within a biological shield. Fuel assemblies consist of fiber
fuel inside cylindrical aluminum-alloy cages, 1 in. diameter, 6 in. long.
Fuel assemblies are in channels in graphite moderator. Each fuel channel,
which contains 56 fuel assemblies, is surrounded by an outer tube to

form an annulus, through which coolant flows. Each double-tube assembly
is set in a graphite block, 4 in., by 4 in. by 32 ft. Core contains 1000
such unit cells. Reflector: 2 ft of graphite surrounding core. Process
gas (dried air) goes to fuel channels by subheaders connected to four main
headers. Coolant gas likewise enters coolant channels from headers.
Coolant enters at 779°F and leaves at 800°F., Working pressure: 1000 psi.
About 90%Z of process gas is recycled. Remainder is treated to remove
fission products and to separate acid product. Glass-fiber fuel retains
many of the non-volatile fission products. Coolant air goes to heat
exchangers to produce steam for turbogenerators, and the cooled air is
recycled to the reactor coolant system. Steam produced at 650°F and

800 psi (design). Power: 147 Mw(t), 40 Mw(e).

No. 9 Reactor With Dropping Fuel Balls

Naval Research Establishment, Canada

Reference: NRE Report 60/4

Originator: K. N. Barnard

Status: Preliminary study, 1960.
Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, converter. Fuel: spheres,
0.25-0.75 in. diameter, of uranium metal of about 2% enrichment.
Spheres are held within vertically aligned tubes separated vertically
into zones. Smaller spheres, because of higher volume ratic of moderator
to fuel, permit use of lower enrichment. Coolant-moderator: Santowax R
or other organic liquid, in two streams. The main flow is downward,
inside tubes, in annuli between pellets and inner walls of the tubes.
The other flow is outside the tubes, across the core radially from the
core periphery. Two coolant streams should give more-precise temperature
control and greater safety. The external coolant could be a high-
viscosity material, such as a polymer, because less of it has to be
pumped. Such a polymer should have a high hydrogen content for improved
moderation. Average bulk temperature of coolant in core: 380°C. Spheres
were suggested as a method for refueling under load in a more or less
continuous stream, with such advantages as time savings, reduced inventory
of idle fuel, and decreased excess reactivity. Fuel particles are
discharged from the bottom as they become depleted, by removing stops to
allow the lowest fuel units to drop from the bottom. Reactor vessel:
probably spherical; base plate supports tubes containing fuel; upper
plate holds upper ends of tubes in place; three horizontal spacing plates;
thermal shield outside core reflector space. Control: rods or spherical
boron-steel units. Power: 80 Mw(t).

APPENDIX B

Coding Classification System

Reactors can be classified in many ways, including neutron-energy level
and type of coolant and moderator. A reactor catalog made up from ordinary
index cards would require a separate set for each type of classification.
This will be avoided if some sort of punched-card system is used, for it
automatically provides a multiple cross Index. The cards can be sorted,
manually or by machine, into groups by characteristics, provided they are
coded according to a properly designed system. Our purpose was to design
a coding classification system to prepare Royal-McBee Keysort or IBM cards.,
Of the different reactor characteristics, eleven were chosen to describe
the reactor and include neutron characteristics, ccolant, and moderator,
Each of the eleven main characteristics is represented, in the classification
system, by a four— or five-digit number. The digits represent the main
characteristic and the subcharacteristics under the main characteristic.
For example, Coolant, Fluid is described by the digit 3, which is the first
digit of the number describing the characteristics of the fluid coolant.
Succeeding digits describe: 1l--coolant mechanism, 2--coolant form, and
3~--coolant material (two digits). Thus the number 31715 means: (first
digit) Coolant, Fluid; (second digit) coolant mechanism, convective cooling;
(third digit) coolant form, gas; (last two digits) coolant material,
hydrogen. The number can then be represented by holes punched in five
successive columns of an IBM card or by notches in a particular location
in a Royal-McBee Keysort card.

The standard IBM card has 12 rows and 80 columns. The 10 bottom rows
are numbered from O to 9. A number is indicated by the machine punching
a rectangular hole in the row corresponding to the number, in a column
corresponding to the digit. Consequently, the code for such a system must
be based on digits containing numbers from O to 9. The system is based on
digits containing numbers starting with 1, going up to 9, and in some cases
up to 10 or 11. This numbering system is more readily adapted than the
U=-to=-9 system to the hand-punched and hand-sorted Royal-McBee Keysort
cards. The code must be renumbered with O to 9 in each digit to adapt it
to IBM cards. In addition to the 80-column machine-punched cards, IBM also
makes so-called Port A-Punch Cards with 40 columns and 12 rows, the lower

10 being numbered 0 to 9., These cards are scored for punching with a hand

147
punch, or even a pencil, and they can be sorted by hand if desired.

The Royal-McBee Keysort card has holes punched around the periphery
and uses a system of representing numbers between one and 14 by combinations
of notches in one, two, three, or four holes. On the "Coolant, Fluid" card,
an area is laid out with a sufficient number of holes to provide for the
items listed under each subcharacteristic (digit). Successive holes are
numbered 7, 4, 2, 1, so that by notching combinations of two holes (2, 1),
up to three items can be indicated; by notching combinations of three holes
(4, 2, 1), up to seven items can be indicated; and by notching combinations
of all four holes (7, 4, 2, 1), up to 14 items can be indicated. To cover
Coolant, Fluid, an area of the card is marked off with enough holes to
cover the anticipated number of items. The area and each of the subareas
corresponding to the subcharacteristics are labeled with an abbreviation,

and the required holes numbered according to the above system. In the

example:
Name Abbreviation Holes
Coolant, Fluid CF
Coolant mechanism Me 2, 1
Coolant form F 7, 4, 2, 1
Coolant material Ma1 7, 4y 2, 1
Ma2 7, 4, 2, 1

Since there are 19 items under "“Coolant material," two sets of four
holes each are used. If more items must be included under any sub-
characteristic than can be represented by the number of holes allowed, a
new layout of the master card must be made.

Details of the system, with definitions, are given in the following

pages.

equivalent to average moderator temperature. Intermediate neutrons——energy

between thermal and fast ranges. Mixed--different neutron energies in

different regions of reactor. Neutron-Chain-Reaction Type refers to the

character of the chain reaction (as defined by the reactivity, keff) and

its variation with time. 1In a steady-state chain reaction k equals 1 and

remains constant. In a pulsed chain reaction keff varies with time, from
less than 1 to greater than 1 and back to less than 1. We intend to

include so-called burst or excursion reactors like KEWB, BORAX, or Godiva
(single pulse reactors), as well as some reactors that have been designed

to give neutron bursts or pulses with a regular repetition rate. 1In a

converging chain reaction keff i1s less than one (exponential pile or Pickle

Barrel). In a diverging chain reaction,keff is greater than 1, and the

chain reaction is uncontrolled (not a reactor in the usual sense). Neutron

Utilization refers to production and consumption of neutrons (neutron

economy). A converter** is a reactor that produces less fissionable

material than it consumes: 1i.e., the conversion ratio is less than 1. A
breeder** is a reactor that produces more fissionable material than it
consumes: i.e., the conversion ratio is greater than 1. A burner is a
reactor in which conversion is negligible, usually because no fertile

material is present.

The solid coolant may be a finely dispersed moving solid (example, a

reactor cooled by blowing graphite powder through it) or it may be a system .
of rotating blades or vanes that are heated as they move through the
chain-reacting part of the system and are cooled as they pass through a

heat exchanger. The coolant may also be a fixed solid, for example, bars

of a good heat conductor. Another example is a completely solid reactor,
like CP-1, in which heat was conducted to the outside and radiated to the
environment. Such a reactor has to run at low power, as heat dissipation

is small.

Definitions Fluid coolants include liquids, boiling liquids, various fluid

solid-liquid and solid-gas mixtures, vapors (gases below critical temperature),

and gases. Liquid (one component) means a pure liquid (one chemical

substance). A liquid solution is a molecular dispersion, kept homogeneous

by diffusion, that can only be separated by changes of state (boiling off or
freezing out the solvent). A slurry is a two-phase, solid-liquid system, a
fine suspension. Although such a suspension can settle, a fine suspension
settles only slowly, and settling can be retarded by a moderate amount of
fluid flow or agitation. Ultrasonic vibration has been suggested as one method
of keeping slurries suspended. Another source* defines a slurry as a '"'two-
phase system in which the particles are dispersed in the liquid by fluid-
dynamic forces." To be useful as a reactor coolant, a slurry must be capable
of circulation through the core and the heat exchanger without settling

out or depositing in low-flow parts of the system. A paste is a two-phase

mixture of small spherical particles dispersed in a liquid (usually a liquid

Power Development Associates, Inc., APDA-143, April 1961, page 166.

metal for nuclear reactor coolants) at approximately the settled wvalue of
60 percent of solids. The density is constant irrespective of paste

movement. A fluidized bed is a two-phase system of solid particles

maintained in a dispersed or suspended state by an upward flow of fluid at
a velocity below the particle transport value. Fluidized beds are divided,

in the classification scheme, into fluidized solid (liquid carrier), 5, and

fluidized solid (gas carrier), 9. If the fluid flow stops, the particles

settle rapidly. Gases include vapors, which are gases below the critical
temperature. A fog is a dispersion of liquid droplets in a gas (a colloidal

dispersion, droplets electrically charged). A dust or smoke is a dispersion

of solid particles in a gas (a colloidal dispersion, particles electrically
charged). A plasma is an electrically neutral ionized gas, i.e., a gas

containing equal numbers of positive and negative ions.

Definitions Lumps (pebbles)--this form of fuel may vary from large,

irregular (though generally spherical) lumps, 3-5 inches in diameter down
to small pebbles or marbles. Generally pebbles are no smaller than 0.4 to
0.5 inch in diameter; we have called smaller particles pellets or powder.
Rods are generally considered solid cylinders of full core length; short
rods are called slugs. The term "rodlets" has alsc been used. Pins are
fine rods, usually of less than full core length. Wires are continuous
fine rods, in some sort of bent or woven structure. Powder refers to loose
powder only, not powder-metallurgy solid material. Pebbles, pellets and
powder are loosely defined terms for three degrees of subdivision.

Dispersion fuel is a particular type (cermet) with ceramic fuel particles,

such as UOZ’ surrounded by metal, such as stainless steel. Dispersion

fuel is usually made by powder-metallurgy methods.

Definitions The single—phase fuel, coclant, moderator refers to the

homogeneous solution reactor. The fine suspension fuel is the slurry reactor,

which is usually also termed homogeneous. The fuel solution or slurry has
been termed "soup'" by Oak Ridge National Laboratory reactor engineers.
(Coded as 1)

Because some liquids are mutually insoluble or nearly so (immiscible

liquids), several reactors have been proposed with two or more liquid layers
with some means of transferring heat between them. Thus in the rotating-
plate reactor a chain-reacting mass of molten moderator-fuel, such as a
molten salt containing beryllium and uranium fluorides, is surmounted by a
layer of molten sodium. Many refractory metal plates on a rotating shaft
transfer heat from the chain-reacting mass to the sodium, which is circulated
to an external heat exchanger. (Coding 2)

In a light-water-cooled and -moderated reactor, the coolant and moderator

are the same substance; in most such reactors the solid fuel elements are

suspended or supported in the coolant-moderator (example, Pressurized Water

Reactor). (Coding 3)

In some reactors the moderator is separate from the coolant, and the
fuel is dissolved or suspended in the coolant. A "heterogeneous" solution
or slurry reactor would have this core arrangement. For example, a reactor
might be made up of graphite blocks (moderator) with holes through which a
fuel-coolant solutien or slurry circulates. The fuel may also be fluidized
in the coolant, in which case the coolant alone circulates. (Coding 4)

In other reactors, the moderator and coolant are separated, as above,

but the fuel is suspended or dispersed in the moderator instead of the coolant.

Two quite different examples may be given. A chain-reacting heavy-water
solution or slurry contained in a tank may be cooled by light water contained
in tubes or pipes immersed in the solution or slurry. Another example is a
pebble-bed reactor. The pebbles contain fuel and moderator, and a gas coolant
circulates around the pebbles. (Coding 5)

In some reactors the coolant, moderator, and fuel are all separate. The
moderator is penetrated by fuel channels or tubes, in which the fuel is
suspended or supported, and the coolant flows around the fuel. The Chalk
River reactor has this arrangement-—the heavy-water moderator is contained
in a tank (calandria) penetrated by fuel tubes. The fuel rods are
suspended in the tubes; light-water coolant flows mwouna them. The X-10
Graphite Reactor also uses this arrangement although the materials are
different: clad uranium slugs are supported in fuel tubes in a graphite
moderator; air coolant circulates around fuel. (Coding 6)

Codings 7, 8, and 9 are believed to be clear without further explanation.
