Bubbles, Drops, and Entrainment in Molten Salts

To entreinl 1s defined as follows, "to carry along or over (especisal-

1yjmeohanica11y) es fine diops of liquid during distillation". One can

thus envision meny entrainment systems, some of which are pertinent to

‘ studiés*being:done here (viz. entrainment of process salt by 1iquid

bismuth) The iiscussion in this report however will be.confined to

studies of the entrainment of solid and of liquid particles by gases.,
Molten selt processes associated ‘with the MSRE usually use an

inert cover'gas. This gas is often moving along the surface and, in

some'processes, is even swept through the molten salt. Hence we can

‘expect some form of gasipartiole entrainment to play a part in most

molten salt experiments;' The situation is particulaerly aggravated in

- the MSRE pnmp bowl'where a considereble (L E/min. corresponding to a
: minimum L. S'V of 0.35 cm./min ) flow of helium is used to sparge xenon

- from the reactor fuel .

In order to have entrainment, some mechanism for the production of
.fine particles is also reqnired. Our literature search has shown thet :
bubbles and splashes are the principal sources of fine droplets end
spreys. -Again let us direct our attention to the MSRE pump bowi. This
boﬁl is a lentil shaped resefvoir containing about oﬁe_hundred'liters
ofumoiten salt. One inch gbove the surface of this salt pcol is &
sprey ring from vhich salt end helium_ere sprayed at a lively rate
(sixty-five gallons per minute). This lesds to entreirment of one to
two perceht of the helium bw'theifuel. It can give riee not oﬁly to
some directly formed asercsol, but alsorseconda:y droplets from spleshes.
jSince-the,fuel now also contains up to two percent by volume of helium
bubbles, on reaching the (pump bowl) surface, these may give rise to i
Jet droplets when they burst. d

These phenomena.may bear on the ultimate fate of the MSRE fission
products in the following way: there are reasons, derived from chem-

ical thermodynamics3 for believing that many of these fission products,

specifically Nb, Mo and Ru, are present in the fuel es metal. As metals;.

their vapor pressure would be vanishingly small, yet they appear to
favor the gas phase over the liquidh.' Since the MSRE fuel does not

wet the m.eta.l5 the spray from the sPray ring could be diSpersing a

metal fog directly, i.e., there is no reason to expect & droplet of salt

" plns'metal to adhere. :This non-wetting charscteristic also crestes a

possibility for flotation of the metal particles in the fuelﬁ. There

- is evidence, as discussed later, that such an interface scum would'be

preferentially removed (ejected into the gas phase) by Jjet droplets

| from bursting bubbles. .The'pump bowl liquid is quite agitated which

argues against this mechanism. Without a detailed study of flow
patterns, however, one cennot say for sure that areas amengble to the
existence of stable scum do not exist in the pump bowl. It is much
more iikely that a stable scum exists within the sampling ares since
this area is protected,from'the turbulence by & cylindricsl mist shield
wﬁich_extends_from the top of the'gas spece nearly to.the bottomrof the
1iquid. Therefore_consideration of the entrainment_process not only
points the way to an.explanatiOn of the peculiar disposition of-tne
fission products, it indicates that the samples, since they are taken

Most of the information is contained in Figs. 1 a.nd 2 of
this report and concerns bursting bubbles in sea water. One may convert
from mass of salt to .droplet size by remembering the sea water conta'ins |
from 3.15 to 3.5% salt. The other data has been added to the graph
using the 3.15% figure. The results of a bubble bursting at a surface

can be both spectacular end surprising. If we limit ourselves, as

per bubble 'burst, and that these drops mey be up to nearly 0.2 mm. in
.diameter, and all the drops might contain close to one milligram of
meterial. The topmost d.rop is flung nearly twenty centimeters into the
‘air; the others do not perfom.so spectacularly.

The high speed photographs shown in Refs. 12 and 15 delineate quite
'clearly and remarkably the history of the bursting bubble which is also
shown pictorially in Fig. 3. If the surface is clee.n,- the bubbles will
_burst almost immediately. .No agglomeration (growth of large bubbles at
the expense of small ones) was observed for sea water. .Liquid from the
film at the top of the bu'b'ble dra.ins until it ruptures ; & flow of
liq_uid down the side of the liquid ca.vity then ensues. This leads to
the formation of the Jet drop, (Fig. 3). A vortex ring is elso formed
and ejected downwa.rds, shown quite clea.rly by using India ink as a
tra.cerlG. However the foma.tion and beha.vior of this vortex ring is

- not at all clear. Recent studies” 20

have led to the conclusion that
it is formed by the Ra.yleigh_ jet and the drops which subsequently re-

enter the liquid. Jet d.roplets can also be formed by spla.shes in one

and cited two observations

of two manners. A'drop hitting the surface invariably punches a clear

cylindrical hole which may or'may not have a sheer cylindrical wall

14,17,18

rising from it This wall either closes over, or forms a crown

which breaks up into.a,fihe,spray. If the hole does close, it soon

reopens, and a long Jet vhich breaks into jet droplets appears.
Blencherd end associatés considéred'alsb the formation of bubbles
from splash drops and the equilibrium between small bubbles and dis-
solved gas. The splash drdps producé very tiny (fifty micron) bubbles.
A father discouraging feature of this mechanism for material franspprt
is that ﬁnlgss thefe-is aﬁequate supersaturamion most of these bubbles
will go back inﬁo solution. However, in sd doing they will raise the
supérsaturation until a point is reached where such bubbles will grow.
Blanchard also found that the Jet droplets from bursting bubbles

9,10, 1%

carry a positive charge A greater charge may be induced by

applying a local field;'by using a positive field the charge sign on

17

the drops can be reversed; Hobbs and.Kezwéény on the other hand

fbund that the droplets fbrmed from splashes carried a negative charge

differencezin'charge sign;seems7most,unusual since_thé mechanism of

- formation of the large drqplétsffrom,the Rayieigh_Jet seems identical
with its fbrmation from;ﬁubbies, 'Thé larger droplets,:those from the

 thus accéhtuating_thé difference. Hobbs has also observed a linear

An important consideration from our standpoint is that the jet
droplets cen also remove surface conteminants. This had been showm
experimentally by Blancha.rd25 (see also ref. 8, p. 107); the mechanism
of this removel and‘the- use of bubbles as e surfece micrqtome has also

| been discussed by MacIntyrelG.

- The oceanogrephers were interested primarily in bubbles less than
two millimeters in dismeter and this led them into a mild controversy

with e rival group of engineers (Imperial College, London) who were more

interested in the bursting of larger (2-5 mm.) bubbles. The 2-3 mm.
_size_range is eritical'sinee it is generally acceptedBl that in water,

-bﬁbbles greater than 3 mm. in diameter are inherently unstebleBl. The

Imperial College group has shown at least for large bubbles that in

“eddition to the Jet droplets that accompany bubble breaknp, there is =a

fine spray resulting from the breakup of the bubble dome33’3h. For

bubbles greater than 5 mm,'diameter,-all the droplets came from rupture

‘of the bubble dome. They also discovered that a temperature increase

caused & marked decrease in the number of jet droplets. The question

was pretty much resolved by another group of engineers (Birmingham)35

who showed that most of the_mess of the‘drqplets from bubbles 2 mm.
and less in size came from the jet droplets, whereass for large bubbles
most of the mess comes from-breakup of the bubble dome. They also

demonstrated thet entrainment_decreased repidly with bubble size.

Two groups of Japenese iﬁiestigatorslhawe also studied entréinment
due to jet.drops. One group studied-Jet drop formation in wster at
20°c, 2.1% n-butylic acid (a pronounciational misprint‘no doubt) and
in 50% glycerin éolﬁtion36. Contrary to the results of Garmer et al.
 31ycéro1 and n-butyric acid solutions gave curveé'similar.inform to
| those from water, but the maximum rise height of the droplet was lower
tban it was for water.- The second group investigsted tﬁe.felationshiﬁs
bet#een bubble size, drqplet‘sizes,_and physical properties of:the liquid,
particularly viscosity end surface tension37. These date are presented
as graphs and equations in their publication. As they point out, how- .
ever, it is nearly impossible to'vary only & éingle’parametér (e.g.
surface tension) without simultaneously changing enother (e.g. viscosity).
All these investigations havé followed thérformulation‘of Davie538
in equating the vertical force P.(27#r) with the force on thé'maSS of
‘liquid set in motion (mg). This_lea#es no roﬁm for the effect of vis-
cosity even though such an effect has been observed'repeatedlyjs’is.
(A viscosity effect might find its way'into the constant in the empiricel

16 that the impulse

equation in ref. 36.) It was recently pointed out
force arising from the rupture of the bubble-can be dividedinto-two
parts involving inertiel and viscous forces and for water those are
.approximétely equal. The equations involved, however, are not partic-

ularly smenable to direct solution, especially for s molten salt system.

This phenomenon appeared to be analogous to the volumetric evapor-

ation mentioned earlier « Ve undertook to repeat the experiment,

, this time using five beakers containing, respectively. no additive,

gold colloid, silwer, a surface coating of talc, and a surface coating

'of graphite._ The same sort of results were Obtained. The particles

were visible in.the'microscope, and were barely resolvable, thus

‘measuring about O.ky in diemeter. None of the added.materials seemed

-to interfere with the deposit vhich was easily visible after a day

The.deposit over the carbon,was not gray, chemical analysis showed no

entrainment of thersurface or colloidal materials. USing the Japanese

data as a guide, such droplets should arise from bubbles less than 51

in dismeter. Such bubbles,,however, should be subjected to an extremely

high pressure (7/r) 6 x 108 dynes/ 2) and should thus all go back

into the solution until_the,supersaturation becomes indeed very high.

The question was resolved by an analysis of themainmatrixmaterial

vhich proved to be almost exclusively NEgNOg. The very slow volatiliza-

,tion of this minor impurity should not be confused with the rapid

| volatilize.tion required for volumetric evaporation. ‘, o

- ‘Conclusions

The'production and behavior-of drops froﬁ splashes and bubbles has
beeﬁ reviewed_and deséribed.' Possible applicatidn of these phenomena
to the MSRE pump bowl has been considered. - |

There are thrée sorts 6f drops which can contribute to entrain-
ment.in fhe MSRE, Jjet drqps-fram splashes and from small récirculated
bubbles, film drops frbm.the;breakup of the film cap of larger bubbles
end crown-drops from the breaskup of the crown.from.splash drops. In
additioh, theré might be aéonsiderable diréct asrosol formation due
to spray from the spray ring, but we have, at present, no way of

evaluéting this. The smount of salt available for entraimment from

. these sources is much lerger than that actually lost from the reactor,

hence most of the droplets must be returned somehow to the liquid streem.

It bas also been shown that Jet drops can preferentiaslly remove a
surface film.ffdm a_molten_éaliﬁsﬁrface.. This surface ﬁicrotoﬁe efféct
may well be-cogtributingtd the apparent. loss of fission products to

the gas stream.
