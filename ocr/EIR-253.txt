Thorium-Uranium Fast/Thermal Breeding

System with Molten Salt Fuel

M. Taube

February 1974
The aims of this paper are as follows:

1.

To discuss the elimination of the need to transport pluto-
nium containing fuel (or pure plutonium) outside the confines

(1)

of the power station even for the construction of a new

reactor (doubling the power), thus reducing the risk of:

a) hi-jacking, and subsequent holding to ransom: or diver-
sion for undercover nuclear weapon production (or threat
of)

b) an accident, since the max permissible concentration of

plutonium in air is as low as 10712 uCi/cm3 that is

16 g Pu in 1000 m° of air.

To outline a possible method of utilising the whole amount of
fertile material commonly present in rocks and granites,
where the amounts of thorium are approx 3-U4 times greater

than those of uranium.

To discuss the optimisation of the burning of the 'synthetic!'
nuclides, that is the plutonium in the fast reactor and the
uranium 233 in a thermal reactor. The desirability of coup-

ling both reactor types is explained to

a) obtain a breeding system based on the fast reactor

b) obtain a 'burner' system for nuclear transformation of

fisslon products (9’10).

In order to realise these three characteristics the paper out-

lines a complex system of fuel cycles, reactors and reprocessing

plants (Fig. 1).

The only nuclide allowed to pass out of the power plant
complex is U=-233 always diluted by ~33 atom% of U-238. In
this case

a) hi-jacked U-23%3 cannot be used as weapon material with-

out the aid of a separation plant.

b) the accident risk is much reduced since both the spe-
cific activity of the U-233 is 6.8 times smaller than
that of Pu-239 and the permissible body burden some
250 times greater than for plutonium, making an overall

danger factor 1700 times smaller.

The plutonium re-cycling is contained entirely within the
bounds of the reprocessing plant which in this case is
directly coupled with a power reactor. Any 'milking' of
plutonium from the system unknown to the safeguards control
is prevented by having the plutonium always mixed with

amount of highly active fission products.

To utilise fully all the potential fertile materials present
in granites it is necessary to make use of both thorium and
plutonium. In the case considered here this is possible due
to the combined breeding system and the complex of two

reactors fast and thermal.

The problems (the Weinberg's idea of 'burning the Rocks') of
using both breeding cycles, Th-23%2/U-233 and U-238/Pu-239
in fast and/or thermal reactors have been discussed for a

long time. (4,6,11,12)
Here the power producing system is based on the molten salt
reactors for maximizing the breeding process and to achieve the
nuclear transformation of most of the radioactive wastes.

The system proposed here consists of the following parts. (Fig. 2)

1. Granite extraction: 110 ton granite per day with approx

50 ppM of thorium plus uranium.

Note 1. In the Swiss Alps the syenite contains approxi-

mately this amount of Th + U.

Here we postulate an extraction efficiency of only 50%.
This could fairly easily be increased if some of the other
valuable components of granite were also extracted for

industrial purposes.

The amount of electrical energy and chemical reagent re-

quired 1s not too high relatively speaking.

Note 2. 1In South Africa the commercially exploitable ura-

nium ores contain approx 300 ppM (plus other valuable com-

ponents).

The cost of extraction of thorium + uranium from granites is
estimated to be about 500 $/kg the present cost from 'rich'
ores is 20-30 $/kg. This difference in a fast breeder
reactor has little influence on the cost of electrical

energy production.

The problem of reducing the volume of wastes from granite ex-
traction can be overcome by using pyrochemical or electro-

chemical methods, instead of classical aqueous technology.

chloride, and part in the form of fluoride.

(fluoride)

The details of reprocessing, waste management and electrical

power production are not discussed here for the sake of

simplicity and brevity.

Conclusions

1. It is possible to conceive of a nuclear power system without

shipment of plutonium outside the power plant boundary.

2. A power system making 'full' use of the thorium and uranium
present in granites can be demonstrated taking the known mean

abundance of these elements in the rocks.
3. This system 'breeds' with a doubling time of approx 35 years.

4, The system permits a large amount of long lived fission
products to be burnt in situ (exceptions Cs-137 and T which

must be stored).

5. The system consists of two coupled reactors, the fast breeder

with chloride fuel, the thermal burner with fluoride fuel.

6. The fuel for a second (doubled) power system consists of only
U-233 (66%) and u-238 (33%).

7. The system retains the other advantages of molten salt reac-

tors such as

- very low concentration of I-131, Cs-137, Xe-135 in steady

state due to continuous gas extraction(lo)

- no fuel element fabrication
- 1internal fuel reprocessing plant

(8)

- stable against loss of cooling accidents

Am.Nuc.Soc. Winter meeting 1973 p.U410

E.Abrahamson (1973) gives a very useful
outline of the environmental and social
hazards associated with nuclear power
production. Among the most important to
be mentioned are those associated with
plutonium,

- environmental releases of plutonium
cannot be tolerated

- occupational exposure cannot be permitted

- unauthorised removal from the fuel cycle
cannot be permitted - and what item of
commerce has not been stolen?

- the diversion into weapons programmes by
countries must be prevented unless there
are compelling reasons to believe that
the proliferation of nuclear powers
enhances stability.
