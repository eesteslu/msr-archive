MSRE PROCEDURES FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN EXAMINATION
" AND ULTIMATE DISPOSAL
(Phase III of Decommissioning Program)

 

R. H. Guymon

ABSTRACT

This document describes the condition of the MSRE and specifies
procedures to be followed after the post-operation examinations and
before the ultimate disposal of the fissile and radioactive material in
the reactor. .The fuel salt will be kept frozen in the sealed drain tanks,
within secondary containment whose only opening is through filters to
a stack. OSurveillance will consist of remote monitoring and daily visits
by X-10 plant personnel. Personnel access will be controlled by the
security fence around the reactor building. The MSRE Procedures specify
remedial actions for abnormal conditions. Also specified are procedures
and responsibilities for maintensnce, modifications, and removal of

surplus equipment.

- Keywords: molten-salt reactors, MSRE; procedures, storage,
surveillance, administration, containment, flowsheets, maintenance,

operations, ORNL, plans, testing.

NOTICE This document contains information of preliminary nature
and was prepared primarily for internal use at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. it is subject to revision or correction and therefore does
not represent a final report.

A. INTRODUCTION .

The retirement or decommissioning of the MSRE involves several phases.
Phase I is the period between the end of power operation and the post-
operation exeminations, which is Phase II. Phase III is the interim period
between the completion of the examinations and the final disposal which
is Phase IV. | |

During Phese III, some_of‘the information given in the MSRE Design
and Opérations Reports (Refs. 1 through 9) and the facility drawings will
still be applicable. Much of the eqﬁipment will not be in service, however,
and most of the procedures which were followed during operastion will no
longer be‘applicable. This report describes the systems which will be
used and specifies the normal conditions and surveillance required dufing
Phase III. It also lists the more probablé_abnormal situations which
could dévelop and prescribes remedial actions. The system of access controi, 
apprbvals required for maintenance and changes, and respdnsibilities are
delineated. This document supersedes all previous operating procedures
for the MSRE. '

B. DESCRIPTION AND NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS

Most of the equipment and instrumentation involved during Phase III
is shown in Figure B-1. Pertinent information on the instruments in
service is given in Table B-1. Plan views of the building showing evacu-
ation routes are shown in Figure B-2. The most often used abbreviations
are given in Table B-2. Master, marked-up,  copies of the flowsheets
(D-AA-A-40880 to 40890), the instrument application drawings (D-AA-B-40500
to 40515) and the electrical power distribution drawing (E-2079L4-ED-153-D)
will be kept up to date and avaeilable in the MSRE control room in |
Building 7503. Another up~to-date set of drawings will be kept in the
outermost room of the office building (Room 17, Building 7509).

About one-half of the fuel selt (5,460 1bs) is stored in FD-1 and
the other half (L4784 1bs) in FD-2. All of the flush salt (9,460 1bs) is

stored in FFT. The salt is at ambient temperature and pressure with all
heaters turned off. The salt f£ill lines (104, 105, and 106) have been
severed and are blanked in the drain tank cell. Salt is frozen in the
transfer freeze valves (107, 108, and 109). The equalizer line (521)
between the tanks and the fuel circulating system has been blanked ih the
drain cell. The helium supply lines (572, 5T4, 576) are capped. The
vent valves (HCV-573, =575, -5TT, and -533) are open (since they are fail-
open valves) but HV's-5L2, -522A, -522B, -538B, -571B, and -561 in the
vent house are closed. Thus there normally is no purge or vent from the
tanks. The drain tanks and the flush tank gas spaces are interconnected
through the vent valves and the equalizer valves (HCV-5hk, -545, -5L46).
The pressure in the tank syspem is indicated and annunciated by PIA-5T2

-in the auxiliary control room. The drain tank and other temperatures

can be read on TR-SD-1. o

The fuel circulating system contains only residual amounts of flush
salt. The system was opened at the reactor, fuel pump, heat exchanger,
and line 103. These openings'were sealed in various ways and were shown
not to leak exceseively at 5.psig. Since some of the heat exchanger tubes
were cut out, the_main coolant salt lines (200 and 201) communicate with
the fuel system andwere.tﬁerefore welded shut Just outside the reactor
cell. The system is at embient temperature and pressure. The helium
supply lines (516, 592, 593, 596, 589, 599, and 600) are capped. The
main vent line (522) is closed by HV-522A and the upper offgas line (524)
is capped 1n ‘the Special Equlpment Roomn. 'The pressure is indicated and
annunC1ated by PIA—589 in the Auxlllary Control Room.

The coolant salt (3, 575 1bs) is in the coolant draln tank, at ambient
temperature and pressure. . Freeze valves 204 and 206 are frozen to separate
it from the coolant c1rculatingrsystem. The helium supply valve (HV-
511B) is closed and the vent line is blanked off to isolate the tank.

‘The coolant circulating eysfem]cbntains only residual_amounts of

- coolant salt. It has beeﬁ_opened in several places and is lightly sealed

(masking tape). There are ne,heliUm inputs to the system or vents from
it. T "
The main charcoal beds are isolated by valves 522B and 55TB. The
auxiliery charcoal bed is isolated by valves 561 and 562A.
 

 

 

The reactor and drain tank cell membranes are sealed and the blocks
are secured. The ventilation valves (930B and 955B) are closed and locked.
The cells are vented to the stack through line 565. (HCV-565 is kept open
by pressure from a cylinder of nitrogen.) Activify in the line is moni-
_tored by RIA-565 B and C. High activity indication on either detector
'will close HCV-565 and annunciate in the auxiliary control room. All other
lines and penetrations into the cells are mechanically sealed. _

Steck fan SF-1 is in service and SF-2 is in standby (damper 925 open
and 926 closed). All three stack filters are in service. IMOst of the
‘building ventilation flow is from the high bay with smaller amounts from
other areas including the chemical processing cell. (The relative distri-
bution is not critical.) The stack flow is indicated by FI-S1 at the stack.
The pressure at the inlet to the filters is indicated and annunciated by
PIA-92TA. The a, B-Y, and iodine activities in the stack are indicated
and annunciated in the auxiliary control room and at the ORNL Central Waste
‘Monitoring Facility (CWMF).

All water lines to the reactor and drain tank cells have been discon-
nected. The water levels in all cell sumps can be checked using the bub-
bler level indicators, dbut nd ennunciation is provided. The waste tank is
essentially empty and can also be checked using & bubbler level indicator.
The pump-room sump, which collects water from the filter pit, french drains,
etc., is automatically pumped to the drainage ditch by the sump pumps .

High level in this sump is annunciated. | |

The fire alarm and sprinkler system is in service and maintained by

the ORNL fire department.

C. SURVEILLANCE

| Surveillance of the MSRE shall be sdequate to prevent the development
of any condition that would threaten personnel safety or the continuity of
. other ORNL activities. |

Radiéactive and fissile materials are so contained and situated that

criticality is prevénted and the probability of any significant release to
9

n

the environment is extremely small. The potentials for increasing tempera-
ture and pressure in the'containment or the development of other potenti-
ally damaging conditions are limited'so that such conditions can arise only
slowly, if at all. Thus the continuous presence of personnel at the reac-
tor site is not required. Surveillance therefore consists of scheduled
visits for data-logging ahd'checking plus the.COntinuous'monitoring at the
ORNL Central Waste Monitoring Facility of key signals from the MSRE instru-
mentation. | |

Each day a member of the ORNL Central Waste Monitoring Group shall
enter the reactor building to mske observations as required on a Daily Log
Form. During the last week'bf each monthia qualified member of the Reactor
Division shall make an inspecﬁidnof the reactor building, record data, and
make checks as required on a quthly Log Fofm. Equipment and instrumenta-
tion shall be maintained on a regular”schedule ahd as requifed by personnel
of the ORNL Plaﬁt'and Equipment‘Division and Instruments and Controls
Division.

When any of a selected list of variables goes out of limits (prescribed
in Table B-1) alarms occurrboth‘in the reactor building and at the ORNL
Central Waste Monitoring Facility in Building 3105. When an alarm occurs,
one person from the group on duty at the CWMF shall go to the MSRE site,
enter the main control room.and take appropriate action to restore normal:
conditions. - o |

Corrective actions for foreseeable abnormal situations are prescribed

in Section E of these Procedures. In addition, experienced former members

of the MSRE opératiohs'staff shéll:be designated and availﬁble on call for

(See Fig. K-1.)

assistance in meéting”néedsithatlmay arise. |
~ The ORNL Plant Protection Division provides prdteétion against entry

by unauthorized personnel ($ée Section J) and against fire damage.
 

 

10
D. DATA

1. Control-Room Log | | |
Every significant event or action affecting the reactor shall be re-
corded in a Journal-type logbook that is kept in the control room. Some
items which shall be included in this log are:
| Equipment started or stopped.
Valves opened or closed.
~ Switches or breakers opened or closed.

Procedures or parts of procedures started, worked on, or com—
pleted.

Changes in setpoints df switches.
Annunciations, and action teken.
Abnormal conditionsror malfunctioning equipment found.

Maintenance and other non-operational jobs done.

The person who makes an observation, or takes action, or is in charge
Iof any Job shall be responsible for seeing that én entry is made. Log
entries shall be sufficiently descriptive for others to understand and
each shall include time, date, and the name of the person making the

| entry. | _
| Carbon copies of the logbook sheets will be removed when the monthly

log is taken end will be stored in a file cebinet in Room 17, Building 7509.

2. Periodiec Logs _ _ , -

The Daily Log includes recording various readings as indicated on
Form D-1. This form prescribes "Log Limits" and identifies therappropriate
corrective action if a variable is outside these limits. (Corrective
actions, identified on Form D-1 by a letter, are detailed in Section E of
these Procedures.) .

The Monthly Log, which shall be filled out during the monthly in-
spection, is Form D-2. This form requires reading the salt tank temperatures,
the waste tank level and T sump levels. It also has spaces for indicating:

that other routine moﬁthl&'taSks have been done.

F. POWER OUTAGES

A power outage at the MSRE should not cause much difficulty and
should not be hazardous. - An\alarm'will occur at the ORNL Control Waste
Monitoring Facility unless. they also lose powerj in that case no alarm
will océur'until their power trouble is corrected. .

When power is available, a stack fan should be started. HCV-565
should be opened by pushing the reset buttons on RE-565 B and C, and the
high-bey CAM and monitron should be checked. A log should be taken to
assure that everything is within limits and that nothing appears abnormal
in the area. Check that there is no water in the pump room (cbserve
from 852 level). Freeze protection should be considered in the winter,

The MSRE supervisor should be notified on the next regular work day.

G. ANNUAL TASKS

The fuel and flush salt in the drain tanks will be heated once a year

" t0 recombine fluorine.

An annusl check will be made to determine that all

valving and electrical switches are in the proper position, that standby

equipment will operate if needed and that the annunciator and control

switches have the proper setpoints. The following check lists are used

to accomplish this.

H. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

Operating equipment which fails should be repaired as soon as pos-
sible. The urgency depends upon the consequences. Table E-2 lists most
of the possible process repairs and delineates the importance of each.

Repairs will be done only with the approval of the ORNL Central Waste
Monitoring Group, the MSRE Maintenance Supervisor, or the MSRE Supervisor
(or his representative). The person initiating the request for repairs
will be responsible for the safety of personnel ahd the facility.

During regular working hours a Punch List form (FORM H-1) will be

filled out and given to the Maintenance Supervisor (Fig. K-1) who will

expedite the repairs. Any deviation from the punch list should be approved

by the requestor. When the work is complete, the punch list will be re-
turned to the Maintenance Supervisor who will be respoheible for entering
all details in the console log and filing the completed punch list in '
Room 1T, Building 7509. | | o |

On other shifts, the ORNL shift supervisor shall arrange to have the
repairs made and shall be responsible for getting the details recorded in
the console log. |

Most of the programmed maintenance will be done during the last week
of each month when the mpnthly leg is being teken. Permission must be |
obtained from the Maintenance Supervisor, the MSRE Supervisor, or his
representative before doing these.

No modification will be made to the facility without the approval of

the MSRE Supervisor or his supervisors.
I. REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT OR INSTRUMENTATION

Equipment and instrumentation needed for the interim storage of the |

fuel or for the future transfer or processing of the fuel will be'retained

intact. Other‘things may be removed if needed after obtaining the approval -

of the MSRE Surplus Property Custodian, the MSRE Supervisor, or Assistant
MSRE Supervisor. All ORNL procedures will be strictly adhered to (see
ORNI~-SPP-37). In addition an MSRE Property Transfer Form I-1, and Punch

open without a guard in attendance. | '

There will be radiation.and contamination outside of the containment
cells. Where required, Radiation and Contaminétioh Zénes will be identi-
fied and protection provided as presecribed by ORNL procedures. Monthly
radiation and safety surveys will be ﬁade td assure that no'inadequately
guarded hazards exist. Those persons hav1ng keys will be adv1sed of any
llmltatlons on use of the area, and 1t will be thelr responsiblllty to

so advise anyone that they admit to the area.
