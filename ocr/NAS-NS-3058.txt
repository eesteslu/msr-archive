FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radiochemistry is one of a number of
subcommittees working under the Commlittee on Nuclear Scilence
wlthln the Natlonsal Acedemy of Sciences - Nationael Research
Council. TIte members represent government, industrial, and
university laboratories in the areas of radiochemiptry and
nuclear chemipgtry. Support for the activities of this and
other subcormittees of the Committee on RNuclear Sclence is
provided by a grent from the Natiomal Scilence Foundation.

The Subcommittee has concerned 1tself with preparation of
publications, encouraging and supporting activitles in nuclear
education, spomsoring sympoeiz on selected current topics 1n
radiochemistry and nuclear chemlstry, and investigating special
problems as they ariese. A series of moncgraphs on the radio-
chemistry of essentielly all the elemente and on radiochemical
technlques is being published. Initiation end encouragement
of publicatlon of erticles on nuclear education in various
subjJect areas of chemistry bave occurred, and development and
improvement of certain educetional mctivities (e.g., laboratory
and demonstration experiments with radiocasctivity) have been
encouraeged and asgisted. Radloactive contaminatlon of reagents
end materinls has been lnvestigeted and epeclfic recommendatlons
made.

This serlies of monographs bas resulted from the need for
comprehensive compllations of radiochemical and nuclear chemical
information. Each monograph collects in one volume the pertinent
information required for radlochemical work with an individual
element or with a specialized technique, The U, S, Atomlc Energy
Commission hes sponsored the printing of the series.

Comments and suggestions for further publicatione and

activitles of value to persons working with radlcasctivity are
welcomed by the Subcommittee.

PREFACE

This report has been prepared as one of a series of monographs on the radio-
chemistry of the elements for the Subcommitte on Radiochemistry of the Committee
on Nuclear Science within the National Academy of Sciences. There is included a
review of the nuclear and chemical features of plutonium of particular interest to
the radiochemist, a discussion of sample dissolution and counting techniques, and
finally, a collection of radiochemical procedures for plutonium .

The literature search was completed epproximately through September 1964.
It is hoped that the bibliography is sufficiently extensive to serve the needs of the
radiochemipt, but it is to be expected that important references were omitted.
The author would appreciate being made aware of such omissions, that they might
be included in possible future editions of this monograph.

The author wishee to express thanks to Dr. Earl Hyde, for the loan of his
extensive card file on the radiochemistry of plutonium, to Carl Wenarich and the
staff of the LRL Library who greatly assisted in the literature search, to Mrs.
Shauna Ness who typed the first draft, and to Mrse. Vivian R. Mendenhall who
competently edited the final draft and prepared the bibliography.

Finally the author thanks his colleagues at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory,
especially Dr. R. W. Hoff, for reading and criticizing the manuscript, and Dr.

P. C. Stevenson for his continued interest and support during the writing of this
monogreaph,

IV. CHEMISTRY OF PLUTONIUM OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE RADIOCHEMIST
A, Metallic Plutonium

A.1 Preparation

Plutonium metal is most commonly prepared by the reduction of a halide by a more
electropositive metal such as calcium. Connor ~ has compared various combinations
of halide and reducing metal and found that the only satisfactory reactions were PuFB,
PuF , and PuCl3 reduced with Ca metal. Harmon and Reaslﬁ4 and 01:'1:h-3o6 have
discussed the conversion of Pu salts to metal on an industrial scale, while Anselin,

et 31.30 describe a method for the conversion on a gram scale.

A.2 Physical Properties

Pu is a typically silver-white appearing metal which has a number of peculiar
physical properties. The metal undergoes a total of five allotropic modifications
below the melting point, two of which have negative coefficients of thermal expansion.

Table IV-1 summarizes the more important physical properties.

A.3 Chemical Properties

Pu is a very reactive metal. The potential for the couple Pu = Pu Tt + e is
2.03 volts, which places it between acandium (Sc) and thorium (Th) in the EMF series
of elements. Pu oxidizes more readily than does U, and resembles cerium (Ce) in its
reactions in air. Superficial oxidation of a freshly prepared surface occurs in a few
hours in normal air. The oxide is more or less adherent, and in several days the
oxidation reaction accelerates until finally the oxidation to Pqu is complete. However,
the oxide coating protects the underlying metal in dry air, and the oxidation proceeds
more slowly. Pu metal is attacked at elevated temperatures by most gases; Hz, N2'
halogens, SOZ’ etc. Pumetal dissolves easily and rapidly in modérately concentrated
HCI1 and other halogen acids.

Pu forms intermetallic compounds with intermediate solid solutions with most

metallic elements. However, simple eutectic mixtures are usually made with the group '_

Va and VIa ‘metals, and very little solubility in either the liquid or solid state is ex-
hibited by alkali and alkaline earth metals. '
The behavior of Pu toward various solutions is given in Table IV-~2.

B. Compounds of Pu

Pu forms compounds with a large number of elements. Compounds of Pu in the

II through VI oxidation states are known, Cu.n.ningham,7 and Faugeras and Heuberger

128

describe the preparation and properties of those compounds which have been prepared.

Gel'man, et al.

emphasize the data on complex compounds and attempt to systematize

the data by relating the structures and coordination numbers of the complex compounds

to other actinide elements, as well as to other regions of the periodic table.

The compounds of the III, IV and VI oxidation states are the ones with which the

radiochemist deals, and the insoluble compounds are of primary interest. Of these

the insoluble hydroxides, fluorides, and oxalates, phosphates and peroxides of the

ITT and IV states are of major interest in precipitation and co-precipitation reactions

and are described in more detail in that section.

Omne of the great complicating

factors in Pu chemistry is the formation of a polymeric form by hydrolysis in dilute

acigd or neutral solutions. The polymeric form can be quite intractable in many reactions

2

and may be difficult to destroy. The section on hydrolytic reactions of Pu gives

details,

Table IV-3 lists solubility information for the more stable Pu compounds which

have been prepared.

Formal oxidation potentials for Pu couples in various 1 M sclutions are shown in
Table IV-4. The displacements of the potentials are due to the complex-forming
tendencies of the anions with Pu,

The lower oxidation states become more stable in the actinide series from U to
Am, and correspondingly the higher oxidation states become more difficult to attain. -
- This effect is illustrated in Table IV-5, which shows the free energies of formation

of various actinide ions,

enough in agueous solution to be useful in separation chemistry.

Pu is the first member of this series in which the tripositive state is stable

This fact is of supreme importance in the radiochemistiry of Pu, since Pu can be
selectively maintained in either the +3 or +4 oxidation states in separation schemes.
Advantage is taken of this ability in many of the collected procedures in section VI. -

The oxidation-reduction behavior of Pu is complicated by several factors:

(1) P&lOt disproportionates into Pu-l-4 and Puo-;'- and under certain conditions Pu+3,
put . Puo;' and Puo-;_ can all exist in equilibrium; Put? ig a small, highly

charged ion and therefore undergoes extensive hydrolysis at low acidity and forms
many stable complex ions. This tendency is a dominant feature of Pu(IV) chemistry.
Pu(IV) forms a long-chain compound or polymer by hydrolytic reactions, Pu(IV)
polymer is one of the more unpleasant aspects of Pu chemistry from the standpoint of
the radiochemist.

C.2 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

 

Table IV-6 lists reagents and conditions to effect changes in oxidation state for
Pu ions. It must be emphasized that a relatively small change in conditions may -
produce a large change in the equilibrium, and that some of the oxidation-reduction
reactions may proceed beyond those listed. Therefore, the listed reactions should
be taken as a guide only.

In general, the change in oxidation state between +3 and +4 is rapid, since only
one electron is invalved in this change. Similarly PuO+ and Pu0++ changes are rapid.

2 2
Changes in the oxidation state of Pu which involve the making or breaking of a Pu-O
bond are usually slower. However, Hj.ndmam,184 in a general review of the kinetics of

actinide oxidation-reduction reactions, gives examples of reactions involving M-O
bonds which proceed as rapidly as some involving only electron transfer, Newton and

R:a,bideamu302 have also reviewed the kinetics of actinide oxidation-reduction reactions.
C.3 Disproporticnation Reactions

 

The potentials of the various Pu couples are such that appreciable quantities of
several oxidation states may exist in equilibrium, Pu(IV) and Pu{V) are both unstable
with respect to disproportionation into higher and lower oxidation states in weakly
acid, uncomplexed media. There are several important equilibria which must be

considered for an understanding of Pu oxidation-reduction chemistry,

Appreciable quantities of Pu{Ill), Pu(IV),
and Pu(VI) cannot exist together in H2504
solutions.
These data show that strong influence of the anionic medium on the equilibrium.
The equilibrium is shified markedly to the left even at these low ionic strengths by the
strong complexes formed by Pu(IV). Conversely, the equilibrium is shifted to the right by
lowering the concentration of the acid and complex forming anion, atleast until the onset of
hydrolysis at pH 1-1.5. The hydrolytic reactions again stabilize Pu(IV).

The disproportionation reaction probably occurs as a series of bimolecular reactions.

According to Connick and McVey,lOO the reaction path may be
2Pu** = pu™ + Puo,’ (Slow)
Puog + Pu+4 = Pu02++ + Pu+3 (Fast)

The firet reaction is slow because Pu-0O bond formation is involved, while the second
reaction only requires electron transfer, The rate of the first reaction is second-
order in Pu(IV) concentration and inverse third-order in H+ concentration, The

fallowing reaction sequence is consistent with these discrepancies

Pu** + H,0 = PuoH™ + H
PuOH" + H,0 = Pu(OH), " + H'
PuOH" + Pu(om), " = Pu™® 4 Puoy + H0 + H
C1"ocker'106 determined the relative armount of c_eacﬁ oxidation state present over a

wide range of temperature and HNOg concentration, He found that the minimum
concentration of HNOg to prevent formation of Pu(VI) in a 4 X 1073 M Pu(IV) solution
is 1.5 M, while at 98°C the required concentration of acid is 8 M.

The gecond impartant equilibrium is the disproportionation of Pu(V), which is
unstable in moderately acid solution with respect to the reaction

2 Pu(V) = Pu(IV) + Pu(VI)

29

Connick™" describes this overall reaction as proceeding by either of the two slow

reactions
(a) 2 Puol + 4t = putt

++
9 + PuO2 + 2H20

(B) Puo, + Pu*® + 48" = 2Pu™ + 2H,0

14
followed by the fast reaction

(C) Puo;r + putd - Puo;‘* + put3

Reactions A and B involve the breaking of Pu-O bonds, while C does not., HReaction A
is probably only important until sufficient Pu*3 is formed for reaction B to occur,
since B is kinetically more probable than A.

These disproportionation reactions may be involved in oxidation-reduction
reactions by other reagents. Instead of direct oxidation or reduction, the
disproportionation reaction can occur first, followed by direct oxidation or reduction

of the appropriate product.

C.4 Radiolytic Reduction of Pu Solutions

 

The alpha particles emitted in the decay of Pu239

um to decompose solutions of Pu239 by radiolysis. The radiolysis products then oxidize

supply enough energy to the medi-

or reduce the Pu, depending on the nature of the solution and the oxidation state of -
the Pu, This effect was first described by Kasha and Shelin(-.-215 who noticed 0.6%
reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(IV) per day in perchloric acid salution which was independent
of acidity over a range 0.1 to 2 M. The rate of reduction in HCl was considerably
less. In both cases the reaction is slow enough to allow the equilibrium quantities
of the various oxidation states to be present. The reduction of Pu(VI) probably
proceeds first to Pu(V), and the lower states obtained by disproportionation of this
ion.
Rabideau
rates of HC1O4 and HCl reduction and found that the situation is complicated by the

21_3 26

confirmed the above qualitative results concerning the relative

production of Cl~ in HClO4 solutions and Clg in HC1 solutions, Also, if Br is added
to HC1O4 solutions, a net oxidation instead of reduction occurs if the mean oxidation
number is initially approximately 4,

~ 308

Pages 309

and PageE and Haissinsky found that the rate of reduction depended
very strongly on the nature of the anion in a study of external gamma-radiation
induced reduction of Pu(VI). The rates of reduction decreased in the order

ClOZl= ¥ SOZ >Cl > NOS—. These results presumably also apply to auto-reduction
by alpha particles,

Popov et 53.1.320

on the other hand found only oxidation by irradiation of HNOg
. solutions of Pu with external x-radiation, . The rate of oxidation decreased with an
increase of NO3_ and total acidity.

The lesson to the radiochemist is clear: The stated oxidation states of old Pu
salutions, particularly low acidity HClO,4 and H,50, solutions, should be viewed

with suspicion.

C.5 Hydrolytic Reactions of Plutonium

Pu in all of its oxidation states exists in aqueous solutions as highly charged ions

 

and therefore undergoes hydrolysis reactions in dilute acid solutions. The tendencies
for these ions to undergo hydrolysis is dependent on the charge and ionic radius. The
tendency thus increases with increasing atomic number for all the oxidation states

of the actinide series and in the case of Pu increases in the order PuOéH- < Pu+++<Pu+4.

15
Pu+4 has approximately the same tendency to hydrolyze as Ce-Hjr but legs than that of
Hf+4 and Zr+4.

The constant for the first displacement of a proton from the hydration sphere,
along with the solubility product for the hydroxide of the various Pu ions, is given in

Table IV-8. In the case of Pu_"-3 and Pu+4, the hydrolysis reaction may be writiten

radius, showing the effect of the highly charged central Pu ion.

C.6 Pu(IV) Polymer

By far the most important hydrolytic reaction from a radiochemical standpoint
is the formation of colloidal aggregates in Pu(IV) solutions by succesgive hydrolysis
reactions. The polymer presumably forms with oxygen or hydroxyl bridges and the
reaction is apparently irreversibie, Pu(OH)4 forms when the reaction proceeds to
completion. In intermediate stages, however, the colloid remains in solution and has
properties markedly different from those of the free ion. In macro concentrations the
color of a 0.3 M HNO,4 solution changes from brown to bright green when the solution
is heated. The adsorption spectra of polymer has an entirely differerit character than
monomeric Pu(lV) solutions.

The polymer can be formed from many solutions. The formation of Pu(IV)
polymer is favored by an increase in the Pu concentration and temperature or by 'a
decrease in the acidity, As the total nitrate concentration increases the polymer

- 104

precipitates, up {0 a maximum at 2-3 M NO3 . The presence of strong complexing

-anions inhibit the formation of polymer. Nevertheless, the presence of polymeric Pu

should be suspected whenever the acid concentration is below 0,5 M.SZ'?

Polymer is
formed when solutions are diluted with water because of the existence of transient
regions of high pH, even though the final acidity may be high enough to prevent formation

327, 64

of the polymer. The polymer is also formed by adding less than a stoichio-

metric quantity of acid in the dissolution of Pu(OH) 4 precipitate. Fortunately, Pu{OH) 4

16
can be precipitated from originally monomeric golutions and redissolved without

appreciable formation of polymer by using excess reagents. 239

Pu(IV) polymer may
be completely precipitated from solution by much less than stoichiometric amounts
(approximately 0.15 equivalents of anion) of oxalate, iodate, and phosphate, for
example. This phenomenon indicates that the complex contains few charges. This

form by means of cation exchange.

Depolymerization is very slow at room temperature in moderate acid concentra-
tions. The rate is Increased by heating, stronger acid concentration, and addition of
strong complexing agents such as fluoride and sulfate.

Care must be taken to prevent the formation of Pu(IV) polymer in radiochemical
separations because of the very different chemical properties of the polymer. The
example of non-adsorption on cation exchange resin has already been given, The
Pu(IV) polymer does not extract into tri- n-butyl phosphate, (TBP), for example, but
does extract into di-n-butyl phosphoric acid, (DBP).{"l The formation of polymer in

solutions of diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (butex) has been observed.qzo7

104

Costanzo and Biggers have determined the rate of polymerization and de-

polymerization as a function of acidity, temperature, Pu concentration, and salt con-
centration. Miner278 has summarized information concerning the formation of
polymer in nitrate solutions. Both the above references give suggestions for the
avoidance of polymer formation in handling and shipping macro amounts of Pu,
Polymeric Pu(lV) adsorbs strongly onto glass, paper, etc., indicating that it is
positively charged, 78 Saturation on glass occurs at approximately 1 ug/ cmg.

Samartseva345 found that the adsorption is greater on silica than on glass, that 5 to 8

hours was necessary te reach equilibrium with 10_8 to B X 10—10 M Pu(lV) solutions,
and that adsorbtion on glass was reversgible at pH < 4,
The adsorption of Pu(IV)399 and (VI)BqE6

399

on platinum (Pt) has been studied from

surface from organic extractants such as TBP, tri-n-octylamine, {TOA), etc.
Increasing the concentration of the extractant or the aqueous nitric acid phase in

edquilibrium with the organic phase decreased the adsorption.

C.7T Complex lon Formation

 

The formation of complex ionsg in aqueous solutions with anionic ligands is an
important feature of the aqueous chemistry of Pu. Complex formation and hydrolysis
are competing reactions and may be looked upon as the displacement of the HZO
molecules in the hydration sphere by the anionic ligand or by OH , respectively. The
ability of an ion to form complexes is dependent on the magnitude of the ionic potential

which may be defined by the equation
d=z/r.

z is the charge on the ion and r is the lonic radius. The values of the ionic potentialg

of Pu in different oxidation states are given in Table IV-8,

*After Gel'man et al. 3

The relative tendency of Pu ions to form complexes then is
Pu(IV) > Pu(l) > Pu(VI) > Pu(V)

Gel' man et al, 3 show that the anionic ligand has some effect on this series.
For example, the positions of Pu(IIl) and Pu(VI) are interchanged in the case of oxalate
complexes.

Singly charged anions form weaker complexes with actinides generally than do
multiply charged anions, The order of complex forming ability with some anions is

3>C1 >C104.

CO,; > C,0, > 5O, > F~ > NO
Tables IV-10, IV-11, and IV-12 list available gtability constants for complexes of
Pu(OI), Pu(fv), Pu(V), and Pu(VI), respectively, which are based on the review of
Gel' man et al. 3 The chemigtry of complex compounds and ions of the actinides was
also reviewed by Comyns.97 Table IV-13 lists stability constants for some complexes
of several actinides for comparison.

D. Separation Methods

D.1 Co-precipitation and Precipitation

 

Co-precipitation and precipitation present different problemes to the radiocchemist
because, in general, the insoluble compounds of Pu which have degirabie properties
in precipitation reactions are not those formed in co-precipitation reactions. Of the
and PuF, and co-precipitation of Pu(Il)

3 4
and Pu(IV) by LaF3 are analogous. Since the radiochemist is likely to have small or

common reactions, only precipitation of PuF

trace quantities of Pu in a relatively large volume, co-precipitation reactions are more

important to him, and will be considered first.

Co-precipitation
Co-precipitation reactions are extremely important in the radiochemistry
of Pu. Indeed, the first separation and isolation of the element was accomplished by
co-precipitation with LaF,. This method has become the "classic' radiochemical
method for Pu and is still widely used.

The co-precipitation behavior of Np and Pu toward a number of precipitants is
shown in Table IV-14, taken from the review of Hyde.16 The behavior of these elements
is represgentative -of the actinides in a given oxidation state, The posgsibility of separa-
tion arises when the elements can be maintained in separate oxidation states, and a
selective precipifant is used. The review of Bonner and Kahn49 gives a thorough
discussion of the mechanism of co-precipitation and a good review of co-precipitation
data for all the elements through 1949. The co-precipitation behavior of Pu has been
discussed by Leader.253

The separation of Pu by co-precipitation usually takes advantage of the afore-
mentioned oxidation and reduction cycles to effect purification. The procedure may be
illustrated with the carrying of Pu(III) and Pu(IV) and the non-carrying of Pu(VI) on
LaF

very similar to that of Pu interfere. The oxidation-reduction cycle may be repeated

3 Only those elements with co-precipitation and oxidation-reduction behavior

as many times as needed to get any desired degree of purity. The use of L‘En.F:3 pre-
cipitation ig also a valuable group gseparation and volume reduction step, since not
very many elements have acid-insoluble fluorides.

In many radiochemical procedures, LaF3 is mounted for alpha counting to

method because of absorption of the alpha particles in the LaF3. This bias is a
function of the thickness of the counting sample and must be determined for each pro-
cedure.

Calcium is one of the elements which interferes with LaF3 co-precipitation,
since the fluoride is moderately insoluble. One method of solving the problem of high
Ca concentrations (>200 mg/1) is reported by Scheidhauer and Messainguiral.351 The
Pu is oxidized to Pu(VI) and Can is precipitated away from the Pu. Following re-

duction, the Pu can either be co-precipitated or separated by other means.

Bismuth phosphate. The carrying of Pu on BiPO4 is another of the early,
widely used methods of separating Pu from U and fission products. The development

of the process is reported by Thompson and Seaborg.

peculiarity is the fact that Pu(IV) is more efficiently carried than Pu(IIl}. The optimum
conditions for the co-precipitation of Pu have been reported by Ada.mgon.z0 These are:
1) co-precipitation at the minimum BiPO4 solubility, 2)the absence of strong com-
plexing agents, 3) slow precipitation, and 4) minimum digestion after precipitation is
éomplete.

In addition to being very successful in the large scale processing Pu, BiPO4 pre-
341, 415

126

cipitations have been used in general radiochemical procedures to concentrate

237

Pu from large volumes of water and to determine Pu in urine. The procedure of

Rydberg341 uses the familiar oxidation-reduction cycle to effect purification. Plutonium

is first oxidized to Pu(VI) with sodium bismuthate, BiPO4 precipitated from 0.1 N
HNOS, then reduced with ferrous ion, and finally precipitated with BiPO4.

Zirconium phosphate. Zirconium phosphate is a specific co-precipitant for

Pu(IV), in contrast to BiPO, and LaFg, which carry both Pu(IIl) and Pu(IV). Hyde16

describes a Np-Pu separation based on the reduction to Pu(IIl) before precipitating

 

zirconium phosphate.

18

Other inorganic co-precipitants. Dupetit and Aten1 described the co-

 

precipitation of actinides with thorium peroxide and uranium peroxide. All the elements
were In the tetravalent oxidation state. They found, that in general, the crystal type
made little difference in the co-precipitation of these elements. For example, Pu carried
equally well with thorium peroxide, which has a similar crystal structure to plutonium
peroxide, and with uranium peroxide which has a different structure.

A mixture of Pu(Ill) and Pu(IV) has been carried on lanthanum iodate from dilute
HC1 solution.293

Plutonium can be separated directly from a urine sample by co-precipitation with
calciurn ammoniumm phosphate. 102,74 .

Pu(IV) and Am(IIT) have been quantitatively co-precipitated with K5La(SO4)4_,15

Organic co-precipitants. Zirconium phenylarsonate is a specific carrier

bromomandelic acid, and somewhat lower than this for mandelic acid.

422

Weiss and Shipman quantitatively recovered Fe, Pu, Ce, and Pr from solution

by the formation of oxine homogeneously in solution by the hydrolysis of 8-acetoxy-

quinoline. _
These workers determined Pu in urine by co-crystailization with potassium
rhodizonate.421‘ 374 Kuznetsov and Akimov3247 co-precipitated Pu(IV) from 3 M

HNQ3 golutions with butyl rhodamine. The method is quantitative and separates from
all elements except Th(IV) and U(VI). Repeated precipitations effect the separation.
Other dyes were succegsfully used to separate Pu by the same procedure.

26
Precipitation
Precipitation of macro quantities of Pu is necessary in many analytical
and radiochemical procedures. The precipitation reactions which have been found
useful in practice will be reviewed in this section. The use of various precipitates as
purification steps for Pu is illustrated by Table IV-15, which gives decontamination

431

factors for Pu from Fe, Co, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ce. As usual, Zr and Ru give the

mogt trouble.

Hydroxide. Both Pu(Ill) and Pu(IV) may be precipitated from mineral acid
solution by sodium, potassium or ammonium hydroxide as hydrated hydroxides or
hydrous oxides. Care must be taken in redissolving Pu(IV) hydroxide in acid to pre-
vent formation of Pu.(].'V) polymer, by maintaining a high acid concentration during the
dissolution. Once formed, the polymer dissolves very slowly in acid solutions. This

subject is treated more fully in the section on polymeric Pu(IV).

Fluoride. PuF, and PuFs may be precipitated from acid solution by
addition of excess HF. Prevot et al.329 found that PuF3 forms a more tractable,
crystalline precipitate than does PuF4. The compound is stable to oxidation if the

compounds dissolve readily in reagents which complex fluoride ion, such as H3BO3,
but if heated to 500° dissolve only with difficulty. Metathesis to the hydroxide with
éodium or potassium hydroxide is another method of solution. .Tones214 found that
Pu]Ei"3 was suitable for use as a gravimetric standard for Pu, at least for a period of
several months. This method has not been widely used, however. It is interesting to
note that PuO2 prepared by ignition of this Pu.'E‘3 at 500°C in oxygen was readily soluble
in nitric acid, in contrast to the findings of other workers. This solubility is attrib-

uted to the extremely fine particle size of PuO2 prepared in this work.

Peroxides. Pu(IV) peroxide is formed when hydrogen peroxide is added to
acid solutions of Pu(III), Pu(IV), Pu(V), and Pu(VI), because H202 can act as both an
oxidant and a reductant. Pu(IV) peroxide always incorporates some of the anion pres-
ent into the crystalline precipitate. It has been suggested7 that the presence of the

anion is due to a more or less random placement between sheets of Pu and peroxide

27
oxygen in the ratio 1:3. If an excess of peroxide is used in the precipitation, the
ratio may be lower. The extra peroxide also serves to hold the sheets together.

Precipifation of plutonium peroxide has been used as a purification step for Pu

Pu compounds and solutions. This precipitation has been used to separate Pu from

Dicesium plutonium (IV) hexachoride has also been proposed as a primary

279

gravimetric standard. The compound can be prepared by precipitation from an 8

M HCI solution of Pu(IV) by addition of CsCl in HCI.

D.2 Solvent Extraction Methods

 

The large-scale processing of reactor targets is largely done by liquid-liquid
exiraction. This is so because of a combination of desirable properties of this
method; for example, great specificity for U and Pu, easy adaptability to remote
handling facilities, etc. These advantages are easily carried over to laboratory
separations where specificity and ease of handling are equally important.

A very great deal of research on liquid-liquid extraction systems for Pu has
been carried out in the development of large-scale processes, and a large portion of
the solvent extraction data reported in this section was taken under the spur of the
seemingly never-ending quest for more specific extractants, better radiation stability,
and the like. The basic data on the extractive properties of a given solvent are, of
course, equally applicable in the laboratory or indﬁstrial situation.

The general principles of solvent extraction have been put forth in the book by
Morrison and Freiser,292 and in a comprehensive review by Mza.rcus.zs'ir The solvent

QOrgano Phogphorous Compounds

 

This large and important class of extractants includes the neutral and
acidic esters of ortho phosphoric acid and related compounds, the phosphonates,
phosphinates and phosphine oxides. The class divides naturally into neutral and
acidic compounds by the differences in extraction mechanism. The neutral compounds
extract by solvation of a neutral complex in the organic phase by the phosphoryl
oxygen, while the acidic compounds, in general, operate by an ion-exchange reaction
to form an extractable species. Further solvation may occur in the organic phase in

some extiraction systems of this type.

Neutral Compounds

Tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP), (C4H90)3PO, will serve as the typical
compound of thig type. A complete survey of the literature on TBP extraction of Pu
ig beyond the scope of this review. The more recent papers will be emphasized,
although earlier project work will necessarily be included. A summary of early work

on TBP has been given by Geary.m3

The physical and chemical properties of TBP

2
as an extracting agent have been summarized by McKay and Healy. 59 The TBP-nitrate
system will be discussed first, followed by other aqueous systems, and finally other

neutral organo-phosphorous compounds.

TBP-nitrate systems. Hesford and McK.':l.},.r”B have formulated the ex-

 

traction reaction of metal nitrates into TBP as

MP +p NO,

+q TBP,) = M (NOy) - q TBP,, (1)

where p is the charge on the metal ion and gq is the number of TBP molecules solvating
the nitrate molecule in the organic phagse. The subscript (o) refers to species in the
organic phase, and species withoit subscripts are in the agueous phase. The equilib-

rium constant, neglecting activity coefficients, is then

has calculated distribution coefficients for this

system on a gemi-empirical basis and obtained good agreement with experimental data.

passes through a maximum, and then falls at higher acid concentrations.

with atomic number, i.e., Th(IV) < Np(IV)} < Pu(IV), while that of the hexavalent
actinides decreases with atomic number, i.e., Pu(VI) < Np(VI) < U(VI).44

Moiseenko and Rozen281 measured the effect of temperature on the extraction of
Pu(IV) as a function of nitric acid concentration and uranyl nitrate concentration (Figs.
3,4, and 5). In the absence of uranyl nitrate the distribution coefficient decreases with
temperature below 5 M HNOB, while at higher acidities it increases. This effect is
explained by a decrease in the equilibrium constant for the distribution reaction with
temperature, with a compensating increase in the activity coefficient of Pu(IV) at higher
acidities. This increase is ascribed to a decreased association of Pu(IV) with nitrate
ions at higher temperatures. Shevchenko and Federov364 have studied the same system
at nitric acid concentrations below 4 M with similar results.

Best et_al.43 ' measured the distribution of several tripositive actinides and
lanthanides from nitric acid solutions into 100% TBP. Sorme of their data are shown
in Fig. 6 plotted as a function of atomic number, along with the lanthanide data of
Hesford Lal.l'?'7 for comparison. The curves for the two homologous series are
approximately superimposable if adjustment is made to compare ions of the same radius.
This illustrates the importance of ionic radius on the chemical behavior of these
elements. '

Applications of TBP-nitrate systems. Many papers have been written about

the application of TBP to the processging of irradiated U for
Pu195, 132, 93, 148, 325, 114, 202, 365,109, 133

and U(VI) away from fission products into TBP-kerosene from nitric acid solutions,

The process involvesg extracting Pu(IV)

stripping the Pu into a relatively concentrated nitric acid solution by reduction to Pu(III),
and finally stripping the U(VI) with water. Nitrous acid is added to the feed solution in
the first extraction to stabilize Pu(l'V).'76 Ferrous sulfamate was first used as a re-

ductant in the Pu stripping stage,335' 195, 132
209, 221, 67, 385, 353, 342, 38

although U(IV) as a reductant has been ex-

tensively gtudied. This reagent can be generated from

U(VI) and stabilized by volatile reductants, with the considerable advantage in large-
scale processing plants of not introducing non-volatile materials (e. g. irom) into the
waste streams, thus permitting a smaller waste volume. The behavicr of fission pro-

ducts and other elements in this process has received much attention, both in the primary

papers and others.BB‘ 161,431, 133, 367

A variant has been described in which the fission
products, Pu and U, are successively siripped from the TBP phase by stepwise lower-

TBP was used in the isolation of naturally occurring Pu.315

and Pu into 30% TBP in CCl, (Fig. 8),
and used this system as the basis of an

analytical precedure for these elements
(Procedure 15, Sect. VIII). Both Pu(IV)
and Pu(VI) extract better at all acidities
than U(IV) and U{VI). The quadrivalent

actinides have higher distribution co-

(g3

efficients than the hexavalent above 5-6

M HCI, while the reverse is true at
lower acidities. These authors report a
digtribution coefficient of about 10_3 for
Pu(IIT) and 10 for Am(III) in 8 M HCI1

under the gsame conditions. The wvalue

for Am is congidered more reliable be-
cauge of possible partial oxidation of
the Pu(III) to Pu(IV). HCIL is much less
extractable than HNO3 into TBP. Larsen

PuIV) and Pu(VI) extract well
intc TBP from trichloro- and trifluoroacetic acids.183 The distribution coefficients
decrease with increasing acidity, rather than the usual increase., The distribution co-
efficients for both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) are about 4 to 5 times as great for CClBCOOH as
for CF3COOH at low acid concentrations. For extraction of Pu(IV) into 30% TBP in
Amsco-125 (a kerosene type diluent) fr~m an initial concentration of 0.5 M CCIBCOOH,
D = 21; for Pu(VI), D = 4.

The effect of addition of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid to Pu(IV) or Pu(VI) —
nitric acid — TBP systems is invariably to lower the distribution Coefficient438’ 440, 437 _
sulfuric439 — phogphoric. This effect is presumably due to the formation of unextractable
sulfate and phosphate complexes of Pu. The effect is more pronounced in Pu(IV) than in
Pu(VI), and at lower nitric acid concentrations. For example, making the agueous phase
0.08 M in HZSO4 lowered D for Pu(IV) from 16 to 9.5 in 4 M HNOB; in 2 M I—INO3 the

corresponding decrease was from & to 1.4_437 On the other hand the lowering of D for

34
Pu(VI) by the addition of enough H,50, to 2 M HNO, to make the solution 0.1 M in
stO4 was only from 2.6 to 2.2. .
Sulfuric acid also decreases the extraction of Pu(IV) into TBP from HCl

441

solutions. A solution 1 M in HZSO4 lowered DPu approximately a factor of 10

throughout a2 change in HC1 concentration of 3-8 M.

Other neutral phogsphorous compounds. A wide variety of organo-phosphorous

 

compounds has been studied in an attempt tofind other extractants for Pu and U,
Higgins et al. 181 working with the butyl series found the order to be phosphate
((RO),;PO) < phosphonate (R(RO),PO) < phosphinate(Rz(RO)PO) < phosphine oxide
(RSPO). Thus the extracting power increases with the number of C-P bonds.

69,70

Burger confirmed this series and correlated the extracting power with the basisity

of the phosphoryl oxygen as measured by the P-O stretching frequency. Burger,sg’ 70

and Petrov et al:.318

found that electronegative substituents in the alkyl chain such as Cl and

phenyl strongly depressed the extraction. Sidda113

76 tound that increasing the length of
the alkyl chain in the phosphate series made little difference up to 8 carbon atoms for
quadrivalent and hexavalent actinides. The effect of branching the alkyl chain is to in-
crease the extraction of U, Np, and Pu, but to strongly depress that of Th. This effect
is atiributed to steric effects and possible tri-solvation of the Th complex at high ex-
tractant concentrations.

The extraction mechanism of these compounds is generally the same as that for

267 ppion-

TBP, but not necessarily with the same solvation number for all elements.

HC1 solutions. Pw(IV}) and U(VI) are both extracted well (D = 4-30) from 3 M H,SO,
by 0.3 M TOPO. 187 The extraction of Pu(IV) as a function of nitric acid concentration
is similar to that for TBP, but very much higher, while that for U{(VI) and Pu(VI) show

different acid dependencies. White and Rc-ss427 have written a general review of the

Trace quantitieg of U have been separated from large amounts of Pu by extracting
the .U with TOPO under reducing conditions from 2 M HN03.34

Table IV-16 is a compilation of data for the extraction of Pu{IV) by a large number
of compounds of this type. The extraction coefficients were converted to 1 M extract-
ant by using the ''square law,'" that is by assuming that the extracted complex is di-
golvated in every case. The distribution coefficients were taken at 1 M HNO3 where
possible, but cases in which other ions were present or the acidity was different are
noted. The extractive power relative to TBP was calculated by direct comparison in the
same gseries of experiments where possible, or by comparison to other TBP data taken
under the same stated conditions. The conversion of the phosphine oxide datato 1 M
extractant generally required large extrapolations, since the experiments were done at
low extractiant concentrations. For this reason the numerical values of the distribution

coefficients and the relative extractive power are only approximate.

Acidic Compounds

These compounds are the mono- and di-acidic esters of phosphoric
acid and related phosphonates and phosphinates. They have recieved considerable
attention in recent years during the search for more versatile or specific extractants.
In general, these compounds extract by an ion exchange type reaction anaslogous to
chelation. In many cases the chelate compound thus formed is further solvated in the
organic phase. For example the extracted complex in the extraction of Th(IV) with
bis-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid from several acids involves the anions such as NOs_,

Cl, and possibly 0104_ in extractions from the respective ar.:ids.312

Mono-acidic compounds. Di-n-butyl phosphoric acid (DBP) and bis-2-

 

ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (HDEHP) are the compounds that have received most
attention. They have been shown to be dimeric in the organic phase in a non-polar
golvent such as benzene?’.loThe dimerization is presumably due to hydrogen bonding to
the phosphoryl oxygen. 130 The extraction reaction can be formulated as

M+P + P(HA)Z(O) = M(HAZ)P(O) + PH', (1)

In this equation, HA represents any monoacidic ester of phogphoric acid.

This equation has been shown to be correct for di- and trivalent ions, but tetra-
valent ions in general show a more complex behavior. The extracted complex is some-
times further solvated in the organic phase and nitrate, chloride, and even perchlorate
complexes may be involved in the extraction reaction, depending on the specific aqueous
conditions employed. Thus, no general reaction can be proposed which will account
for all of the observed behavior.

nitric acid solutions by several dialkylphosphoric acids. Their results for Pu(IV) are

alkyl chain is increaged from butyl to decyl, but that for 2-ethylhexyl is greater than
any of these. The ndn—linearity of the slope of these extraction curves is ascribed to
nitrate complexing in the extracted species. The acid dependency was determined by
extraction into HDEHP from HC 104 solutions at a constant ionic strength of 1.0 and
found to be inverse first power in the region from approximately 0.05 to 1.0 M HT.
The Pu is probably exiracted as a hydrolyzed species at low acid concentrations. The
disgtribution coefficient wasg found to vary directly as the square of the HDEHP con- -
centration.

curve at high acid concentrations is due to disproportionation of Np(V) into Np(IV) and
Np(VI), both of which are more extractable than Np{V). The minimum in the Am(IT)
‘curve at high acid concentrations is probably due to nitrate complexing of the extracted
Am species.

Horner and Coleman187 get a different result for the extraction of Pu(IV) by
HDEHP. As shown in Fig. 13, the extraction curve is concave downward with increasing
HNO3 concentration using 0.01 M HDEHP in Amsco 125-82. The mazgéisitude of distribu-
tion coefficients are very much larger than those of Kosyakov et al., if the second
power dependence on the extractant concentration is taken into account. Another dif-
ference is the decreased distribution coefficient at 0.1 M acid. Horner and Coleman
ascribe this decrease to hydrolysis of the Pu(IV). Horner and Coleman prepared Pu(IV)
by reduction to Pu(Ill) with hydroxylamine nitrate, and reoxidation and stabilization
with sodium nitrite, while Kosyakov La'l.zsa did not state their method of preparation of
Pu(IV).

Dreze and Duyckaerts121 investigated the extraction of Pu(IV) by di-n-butyl
phosphoric acid (HDBP) from nitrate solutions as a function of nitric acid concentration,
nitrate concentration, HDBP concentration, and ionic strength. Representative results
are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. These experimenters were able to invoke the known
stability constants of Pu(IV) nitrate complexes to fit the various functional dependencies.
They consider the extraction reaction to be

Peppard et a.l.313’ 270 studied the extraction of several actinides by H2MEHP

from HCl solutions (Fig. 18). The distribution coefficient for Np(IV) at 12 M HCl is
over 103 and is a factor of 104 greater than the other non-tetravalent species studied.

be returned to the aqueous phase by the addition of TBP to the organic phase, resulting
in a great reduction in the distribution coefficient because of anti-synergistic (or

antagonistic) effect of these reagents, (cf Mixed Extractants, p. 71).

Applications of acidic compounds. Acidic compounds have been used in
several applications in Pu chemistry. Kosyakov et a]L.za8 used HDEHP to purify Am(III)

Amine Extractants

These compounds are long-chain alkyl or aryl primary, secondary, and
tertiary amines, and quaternary amine salts. Moore286 and Coleman Lz-:.l.g5 have
given general reviews of the extraction of inorganic species by these compounds. The
amines react with acids to form an ion-association complex which is soluble in the
organic phase, illustrated by a tertiary amine

Much work has been done on Pu and other actinides with these compounds, in
process and analytical applications. They have much higher distribution coefficients
than TBP for U and Pu{IV), and show much less deleterious effects on the distribution
due to high radiation fields because the radiolysis products do not interact with the
extractant to produce synergistic mixtures, (cf Mixed Extractants, p. 71).

The treatment here will be in the order ni_trate, chloride, sulfate, and other.

The structure and nature of the amine exert a great influence on the extractability of Pu,

and pentavalent actinides as a function of nitric acid concentration, with results shown
in Figs. 20 and 21. The maximum distribution coefficients for all these species is very
much less than for Pu{IV) and Np(IV), indicating an easy separation of these elements
from other actinide elements. For the hexavalent species, the amine concentration
dependencies of the distribution coefficients were between first and second power, per-
mitting no unambiguous assignment of the extracted complex. The slope of the Am(III)
curve was unity, while that for Pu(Ill) was approximately 1.5. No explanation of this

fact was given.

187 and Weaver and Horner"£20 have determined the dis-

Horner and Coleman
tribution coefficients of Pu(IV), Pw(IIl), and Pu(VI) for a number of amines from HNOg
solutions, with results shown in Figs. 22, 23, and 24. Their Pu(IV) results for unsalted
tri-n-octylamine (TOA) agree qualitatively with Keder Lal.219 and Baroncelli Lal.?’s but
reach the maximumn at a lower HNO3 concentration. The other classes of amines reach
a maximum at around 9 M HNOa. The effect of salting with l\TaNO3 at a constant nitrate
concentration is to increase the distribution coefficient at lower acidities. Pu(IIl) and
Pu(VI) show very much lower distribution coefficients with all classes of amines (Fig.

23) although Al(NO3)3 salting raises the DPu(III) to a relatively high value with tertiary
amines (Fig. 24).

Baroncelli 51:_3.1_.36 measured the distribution of Pu(IV) between HNO3 golutions and
"tricaprylamine' (TCA, sold as "Alamine 336," a mixture of n-octyl and n-decyl-amines),
with similar results. The amine was diluted in ""Solvesso 100," an aromatic naphtha.

The extraction reached a maximum of approximately D = 140 at 4 M HNOS, and was
strongly depressed by the presence of macro uranyl ion, which saturates the extractant.
In experiments varying the concentration of the TCA the formation of the hexanitrato
Pu(IV) complex is confirmed, but the slope of the log D Pu vs log TCA curve is 1.4 in the
presence of 1.5 M uranyl ion. The corresponding slope for U is 1, indicating the for- .

mation of a uranyl trinitrate complex.

amine," TLA) in an aromatic diluent (''Solvesso 100") and a paraffinic diluent (''Shellsol

5% nonanol to prevent formation of a third phase by increasi'ng the solubility of the com-
plex in the organic phase. Valentini ﬂil.‘mg achieve maximum separation from U by
extracting Pu from 2 M HNOs.

Other work with tertiary amine nitric acid systems with generally similar results
includes that of de Trentinian and Chesﬁellsand Chesfie B4 on TLA extraction of TL(IV), U.(VI),
Np(IV), Np(VI) and Pu(IV); I{nochZE’2 and Knoch and Lim:].ne1:'231 on tri-iso-octylamine
extraction of Pu(IV), U(VI), Zr, and Ru. Bertocci42 found that, with tri-isononyl amine
(TNA, tri-3,5, 5-trimethylhexylamine), the DPu(l'V)

Winchester and Maramr:m431 made a study of the decontamination of Pu in an ex-
perimental pyrometallurgical laboratory from Fe, Co, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ce by both
TBP and amine extraction. A summary of their results in terms of decontamination
factors for Pu is given in Table IV~17. They concluded that the best separation of Pu
from these metals was obtained in the secondary amine system and described a batch
equilibration process for recovery of Pu on a 300-gram scale in a metallurgical
laboratory. '

The Pu and U complexes have limited solubility in the organic phase, and
separate as a third phase at high metal conceniration. The addition of a small fraction
of polar constituent, e.g. octanol;, into the organic phase, increases the solubility of
the extracted complex. Baroncelli i‘a_l.35 have made a study of this effect, and also
of the effect of nitrous acid added to stabilize quadrivalent Pu. They found that nitrous
acid can have either an enhancing or depressing effect on the distribution coefficient,
depending on the nitric acid concentration, while the long chain alcohol always has a
depressing effect. At equal molar nitrous acid and alcohol concentration in the organic
phase, the distribution coefficient is at a maximum. Thig effect ig explained in terms

of the formation of an alcohol-nitrous acid complex in the organic phase.

NaOH, and HF. The results for HNO3 and HCI are given in Figs. 25 and 26 as percent
extractions from equal phase volurmnes as a function of aqueous acidity in the form of
periodic tables. Berkman and K:a.pla.n40 found that tetrabutylamrmmonium nitrate (TBAN)
added to Pu{IV) extracted into hexone caused the formation of a hexanitrate Pu(IV)
species, while in the absence of TBAN the tetranitrate appears to be stable. A pro-
cedure for radiochemical determination of Np and Pu based on this extraction system
using aluminum nitrate as a salting agent has been developed by Maeck e_til.261 They
report a better decontamination from fission products, particularly Zr, than is ob-
tainable in other amine systemas. '

Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) extract well from HCI solutions by amines, while

case, the slope of the log D vs log TOA concentration curve is near 2, indicating that
the extracted complex has two TOA molecules for both valence states. Pu(IV) is much
more extractable than is Np(IV) and U(IV) under the same conditions. The hexavalent

has been used to separate Pu(IV) before spectrographic analysis of other elernents.234

Sulfate Systems

Shevchenko and Zhdanova'73 investigated the extraction of Pu(IV) from
HZSO 4 solutions by TOA. They showed that the extracted complex contains 2 amine
molecules., The sulfuric acid dependence from 0.1 M TOA is shown in Table IV-18.
The decrease in the distribution coefficient at low acidity is ascribed to Pu(IV) poly-

merization. As the acid concentration is increased, the decrease in D is ascribed

Pu(IV)
to the formation of an amine bisulfate complex.

Extractions from mixtures of H2504 and HNO3 proceeded by the formation of the
gsame amine Pu sulfate complex above, but the distribution coefficient decreased with
increasing HNO3 concentration because of the formation of arnine nitrate complex. This

effect is illustrated by the data in Table TV-189.

Moore285 found that the hexavalent actinides U(VI) and Pu(VI) could

be quantitatively extracted from 1 M acetic acid solutions and 1 M acetic acid — 0.1

M nitric acid solutions by 5% TIOA-xylene. Of the fission products only Ru, Zr, and
Nb extracted appreciably, and these could be scrubbed with 5 M HCl. A preliminary
ferric (or uranyl) hydroxide precipitation in the presence of niocbium carrier improved
the decontamination from these elements. The U and Pu were leached from the insoluble
Nb205 with 1 M acetic acid. The uranium could be stripped with dilute I—l'J.'\TO3 or HCI,
NH4OH or ammonium bicarbonate. The Puw(VI) could be stripped by these reagents

or reductively stripped, since Pu(IV) and Pu(Ill) do not extract under these conditions.

Alcohols, Ketones, Etherg, and Amides

These compounds have in common the fact that they contain a basic oxygen
atom which can solvate a proton or metal atom. This type of extractant was once very
popular, but the newer organo phosphorous compounds and amines have received more
attention in recent years. Nevertheless, they are still important in laboratory and
process separations. Indeed, one of the large-scale processes for the processing of
irradiated U, the '"redox' process, uses methylisobutylketone (MIBK or "hexone'’)
as the primary extractant for U and Pu251 as do several laboratory procedures. The
extractive properties of the ethers for U, Fe, and other elements have been known for
many years.

Nitrate systems have received by far the most attention as extraction media for
Pu. Both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) are extractable at high nitric acid concentrations, or at
moderately high nitrate concentrations provided by a salt such as aluminum
nitrate. Pu(IIl) is practically inextractable at any nitrate concentration. The extracted
species depends on the aqueous phase composition. It has been shown that, for example,
the extraction of Pu(VI) from nitric acid solutions by dibutyl carbitol (DBC, the dibutyl
ether of diethylene glycol) the extracted species is the neutral plutonyl dinitrate at low
nitric acid ( < 0.8 N) is a mixture of dinitrate and trinitrate at intermediate acidities
(0.8-3N), is predominately trinitrate at higher acidities (3-6N), and finally is more
complex than irinitrate above 6N. 171 At these higher acidities the extraction must in-
volve the solvation of a proton to form the species H(DBC)2 Pu(NO3)3, rather ‘;}éa}rn
direct solvation of the Pu in the case of the extraction of the dinitrate sgpecies.

from 1.5 M HNOS and as HzPu(NOg)6
245, 246

Similarly, Pu(IV) extracts into hexone as Pu(N03)4
at 6 M HNO3, with intermediate composition of the organic phase in between.
The species extracted into triethyleneglycol dichloride at high nitrate concentration have
been found to be H2Pu(1\703)6 for Pu(IV) and H Pqu(NOB)3 for Pu(VI).7Ei Dibutyl ether
behaves similarly. 413 -
Pu extraction by hexone has received the most attention, undoubtedly because of
its use in processing. The extraction of Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) as a function of nitric acid
concentration and the concentration of various salts has been measured by several

groups.

MacKenzie?®? extended the distribu-
tion curves to higher aqueous acidities for
Puw(IV) and Pw(VI) as shown in Fig. 32.
This curve was replotted from MacKenzie's
original data by Smith388 because the
original was reported in terms of organic
phase acid concentration. The conversion
to aquéoﬁ"s'- phase original acid concentration
wag made by using data on nitric acid ex-

traction by hexone. Both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI)

pass through maxima and decrease above

approximately 7 M acid. A salting agent,
e. g ALNO,),, 271 193 ca(NO,),,343,
NH4NO3260 increases the distribution co-
efficient. A useful comparison of various
galting agents for Pu(IV) into hexone was
reported by Stewart3 23 (Fig. 33). The salts
increase in salting effectiveness at high
total nitrate concentration in this order:
ammeonium, lanthanum, nitric acid, mag-
nesium, aluminum, and mangaﬁese. A
similar comparison for Pu(VI) into diethyl
ether was made resulting in this order:

Other Extractants

Stewartag3 compiled a table of extraction data for a large number of
ethers, alcohols, ketones, etc. for Pu in the tri-, quadri- and hexavalant oxidation
states from ammonium nitrate-nitric acid mixtures. These data are reproduced in
their entirety as Tables IV-21, and IV-22, to show the variety of compounds
tried and to indicate the types of compounds which are efficient as Pu extractants. In
general, the ability of these compounds to extract correlates with the basicity of the
oxygen, nitrogen or other functional group. Thus, electronegative substituents in-
variably decrease the extractibility of Pu (see e. g. diethyl ether vs dichlorodiethyl-
ether).

245,246 investigated a series of aliphatic ketones as eﬁractants for Pu(IV).

Kuca
His results, shown in Table IV-23, show that the distribution of Pu(IV) into hexone is
decreased by (1) increasing the length of the side chain for the methyl—n—aikyl series,
(2) increasing the branching of the side chain for the methyl- (n-, sec-, and tert-)
butyl series, and (3) increasing the symmeitry for the seven carbon atom series. These
resultis can be Qualitatively explained by the effect of the decreased basicity of the
carbonyl oxygen as the alkyl side chain is lengthened, and by steric effects in branched
alpha carbon atoms. Khalkin M'224 found that the distribution coefficient for the ex-~
traction of Pu(IV) from 5.0 M HNO3 was 11.5 by diethyl ether, and this was the highest
among a number of oxygen containing compounds. Pu(IV) was extracted as HéPu(NO3)6
at this acidity. K00i23® found that for extraction of Pu(IV) from 8 M HNO, the ex-
traction decreased in the order dibutyl carbitol (DBC) > diethyl ether (DEE) > hexone,
while for Pu(VI) the order was DBC > hexone > DEE. Branica and Bona54 found that

U(VI) and Th extract at a lower HNO, concentration with several cyclic ethers (e. g.

TBP) in that the extracted complex involves two amide molecules. However, the

metal atom at high nitrate concentrations. Zr exhibits a maximum distribution co-
efficient at about 7 M HNO, and decreases at higher acidities. A large decrease in the
distribution coefficient of quadrivalent Pu and Th occurs as the branching of the alpha
carbon atom is increased, while that of U(VI) is only decreased moderately. N, N-
dihexyloctanamide was superior to TBP in decontamination of Pu from Zr-Nb, but
slightly inferior for Ru decontamination. The potential uses of these compounds are
(1) as selective extractants for quadrivalent actinides, or (2) as selective extractants
for U(VI) in the case of amides with highly branced alpha carbon atoms (e. g. N, N-
dihexyltrialkylacetamide).

Chelating Agents
A large number of bi-functional reagents which form strong coordination
complexes with metal ions have been investigated. These complexes are more soluble
in non-polar organic selvents such as benzene or carbon tetrachloride than in the

aqueous phase, and are therefore extractable. Of these compounds the fluorinated

/ B-diketone, 2-thenoyltrifluorc acetone (TTA) and

Equation (3) assumes that the activity coefficients of the TTA and the metal chelate

These authors determined the parameters of Eq. (3) for all available experimental
data on TTA extractiones and calculated pH50, the pH at which 50% of the ion
is extracted by equal volume phases into 0.2 M TTA in benzene. They displayed some
of these data in the form of a periodic table to show the trends in extractability of the
elements (gee Fig. 35). In cases in which the pH50 value is negative only HCI data are
given, while other data may be for a variety of acids and acid-salt combinations. The
reader is referred to the original paper for more detail. However, this figure shows

that the quadrivalent ions are much more extractable than others.

The extraction of Pu(IV) from nitric acid solutions was investigated by

Cunninghame and Milesllo' 111

using CCl4 and benzene as solvents primarily, al-
though other chlorinated hydrocarbons were used also. They find that, by neglecting

aqueous phase nitrate complexing of the Pu, the equilibrium can be expressed by the

They derive the f's from the TTA concentration dependence of.t.he distribution co-
efficient, and find that C is close to 1 X 10+5 over the range from 1 to 10 M HNO3 for
tracer Pu. Heisig and HiCkS,173 in a very extensive study of the kinetics of the ex-
traction of Pu(IV) from nitric acid solutions by TTA, in sec-butyl benzene, determined
that the rate of transfer of Pu chelate acrosa the organic aqueous boundary controls
the forward and reductive back extraction rates. They find that at low nitric acid
concentrations (0.5 M) the extracted species is PuT4, while at 4.9 M total nitrate con-
centration some partially nitrated complex such as PuNO, T, exists.

373
174 found that for Pu{VI) extractions into TTA-benzene from

Heisig and Hicks
nitric acid solutions the dependencies are direct second-power on the TTA concenira-
tion and inverse second-power on the hydrogen ion concentration, indicating that Eq.

(1) represents the reaction. These authors measured the distribution coefficients for

the Pu(IIl) obtained by reduction with 0.005 M ferrous perchlorate—-0.0l.l\_/I_ sulfuric acid as

a function of nitric acid and TTA concentrations. Theyobtaineda direct 2.3 power dependency
on T'TA concentrationand aninverse 2.6 power dependencyonhydrogenion. These solutions
were never stabilized in the presence of TTA, however. Since the distribution co-
efficient increased with time, extrapolations to time zero were made, and the extrap-
olated values were used. Plots of the distribution coefficients for Pu(IIl) and Pu(VI)
obtained by Heisig and Hicks are shown in Fig. 36.

Cunninghame and MJLleE'.111 determined the extraction properties of 2 number of
possible impurities in the development of a batch process for separating Pu from ir-
radiated U. Their results are shown in Fig. 37. Their procedure, which should be
easily adaptable to the laboratory scale, is to pre-extract the Zr from 0.5 M HNO3
while the Pu is reduced to Pu(Ill) with hydroxylamine, oxidize to Pu(IV) with NaNOz,
extract with 0.2 M TTA-benzene, scrub with dilute HNOB, and back-extract the Pu into
8 M [-INOB. They report a 99.4% Pu recovery on a 1-gram scale with decontamination
factors from Zr and U of 3000 and 667, respectively.

Other reporis on the use of TTA for processing irradiated uranium for Pu are
those of Crandall et al.'%® and cutler.1%?

such compounds as well as many other complexing agents. Extraction data for several

Mixed Extractants

Synergism

The term synergism is used to denote enhanced (or depressed) ex-
traction of metals by mixed extractants, as against the extraction by each extractant
taken separately. This subject has received considerable attention in recent years.

Pu has received its share {(perhaps more than its share) of the general research, and
while not many radiochemical applications have appeared for this phenocmenon, it is to
be expected that more will be found. Considered in this section are all cases of changed
extraction properties due to changes in the nature of the supposedly inert diluent, as well"’
as mixtures of different t{ypes of extractants such as TBP-TTA, TBP-DBP, etc. The
range of phenomena described under the term synergism is thus diverse, complex, and
in general not completely understood. The review of Marcus267 is excellent in this re-

gard, and the reader is referred to it for a more complete discussion.

Influence of Diluent

Taubeage' 397,398

polarity and polarizability of supposedly inert diluents on the extractability of tetra-

conducted extensive studies on the effect of the

and hexavalent actinides with verious extractants, including hexone, TBP, DBC, TTA,
TLA, and TBAN. Examples of diluents used are polar (P): chloroform, non-polar (L.):
carbon tetrachloride, non-polar but polarizable (H): benzene., He found that the nature
of the diluent exerted a large influence on the extractability, and proposed a theory
based on (1) the interaction between the dipole of the organic molecule and the diluent
dipoles, and (2) mutual interaction between permanent dipoles in the diluent mixture
giving rise to structure in the organic phase. The effects can be large; e. g., DPu(IV)
increases a factor of three in going from pure CHCl3 to pure benzene in TBP
extractions. In general, the extraction of a non-polar complex (Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) with
hexone, TBP, TTA, etc.) is favored by a non-polar diluent, In the case of the highly
polar Pu(IV)-TBAN complex, the extraction is favored by a polar diluent; however, the
presence of a polarizable diluent increases the extraction. The extraction as a function
of the mole fraction of H-type diluent thus exhibits & maximum. This is explained by
disruption of the agsociation of the dipoles in the P-type diluent, followed by participa-
tion of the induced dipoles in the H-type diluent in the extraction.

Shevchenko E’ﬂ.aﬁg' 371 found that the extractability of U(VI), Pu(IV), Zr(IV); and
Ce(IIT) decrease with increasing polarizability of the diluent by TBP solutions from 3
M HNO,.

Far greater effects are observed when two different classes of extractants are

mixed. The enhancement (or depression) of the distribution coefficients may be 10% or

71
more. Siekierski and Taube,381 and Taube400 have proposed a systern for synergistic

mixtures based on classification of extractors as anionic (A™), neutral (BO), or cationic
(C). Anionic extractants are acidic compounds such as TTA, DBP, HDEHP, etc. that
act as organic anions in the extracted complex; similarly neutral extractants (TBP,
TOPO, etc.) are neutral compounds that form complexes through a basgic oxygen atom,
and cationic extractants are strongly basic-compounds (TOA, TBAN, etc.) that act as
cations in the extracted complex. In general the synergistic effect is small in mixtures
of compounds of the same class, and may be small or large in mixtures of different
clasges. These authors define a synergistic coefficient as

D
g = log' 1,2, exp

(1)
D; 2. aad

Dl, 2, exp is the experimental distribution coefficient of a mixture of extractants 1 and 2,
and Dl, 2. add is the calculated distribution coefficient based on additivity of the individual
distribution coefficients. Additivity is based on the assumption that (1) no interaction be-
tween the extractants occurs, and (2) no mixed complex of the extracted metal ion with
the two extractants occurs. Both assumptions are commonly not true when extractants

of different types are mixed. A summary table of examples of synergistic mixtures

for U and Pu extraction is given in Table IV-26, based on this clagsification system.

Taube400 has made an extensive survey of mixed extraction systems.

Synergism in the system M-TTA-P, where M is an actinide and P is a neutral

phosphate compound has been studied by Irving and Edg‘lng‘ton,lgﬁ_zoo in nitric acid

and Healy169 in HCl. Healy found no evidence of participation of chloride in the ex-

traction. The extraction reaction is thus
X = +
M™ + x HT(o) +y P(o) =M (T)x (P)y(o) +x H . (2)

Values of y ranged from 1 to 3 for various di-~, tri-, and hexavelent ions. Th(IV) had
a y value of 1 as did U02++, except in the case of TOPO where a value of 3 was also
obtained at high P concentrations.

Irving and Edgington found that 1 or 2 nitrates could enter into the complex,
depending on the nitric acid concentration. With tributyl phosphine oxide (TBPO) the
species identified were M(IV) T3(N03)P1, M(IV) TZ(NO3)2 P,, and M(III) T, (NO3)P2,
whereas with P = TBP they were M(III) T3P2, M(IV) TB(N03)P1, and M(VI) T2P1,
where M is an actinide. Thus the complex is influenced by the basic strength of P.
These authors postulate that the reaction mechanism for hexavalent species ig the re-
placement of a water molecule in the complex by P, giving a coordinately unsaturated
product, thus

MOZTZ H20 + P = MOZTZP(O) + HZO‘ (3)
In the case of tetravalent species, one or more chelates are displaced by P molecules,
with nitrates added to preserve electrical neutrality, thus

MT4 + rnHNO3 + mP = MT4_m(NO3)um + mHT. (4)

Fused Salt Systems

Some research has been done on the solvent extraction properties of
actinide and other elements in relatively low-temperature eutectic mixtures of fused
salts because of their potential use in homogeneous power reactors. Gruen ia_l.154
give a general discussion of oxidation states and spectra of actinides in LiNOs—ICNO3
mixtures, and indicate that TBP extracts a number of elements efficiently from the
eutectic mixture. Isaac %-201 determined the distribution coefficients between
Co(II), M(III) (where M is a trivalent actinide or lanthanide), Np(V) and Np(VI), and
U(VI) in this eutectic mixture (MP 120°C) and dilute golutions of TBP in a mixture of
polyphenyls at 150°C. In general, the distribution coefficients were a factor of 102 or
103 higher than the corresponding concentrated aqueous nitrate solutions. The dis-
tribution coefficients all showed the same TBP concentration dependency a8 in acqueous
solutions, indicating that the extraction mechanism is the same, the higher distribution
being due to the increased salting-in effect. The effect of added chloride was to lower
the distribution coefficients. Quadrivalent actinides would be expected to behave
gimilarly, although none was determined.

Borkowska iai.m used a KC1-CuCl eutectic mixture at 180° to study the ex-
traction of Pu, U, and Am by solutions of TBP, TOA, and HDBP in diphenyl. For TOA

they find the extractability is in the order

<< D

Dpyam < Pamm < Puwn Uavy

In this system a maximum in the D vs concentration of TOA curve occurs at ~40%
TOA, where DU(IV) ~3. TBP shows similar behavior. The maximum in this case is
at §7% TBP,2 where DU(IV) ~50. For U(].'V)’ HDBP is similaer to TBP.

Moore measured the distribution of a number of ions between the immiscible
galt pair LiCl—A1C14_K+ at 650°C. [t is perhaps not proper to speak of this system as
extraction; however significant distributions (Kd > 1 on a mole fraction basis) in favor
of the LiCl phase were noted for UCl4 (for which SnCl2 was added as a reductant),
PuC14, and FeC13. The ratio of the distribution coefficients for tri- and tetravalent
actinides was > 40. Since the SnCl2 used fo stabilize the U(IV) also reduced Pu to
the trivalent state, an easy separation is possible in this system. Similar results were
cbtained by Moore and Lyon290 for the system KCl-AlClB-Al. In this case the
separation factor for U from Pu and Th is approximately 100, while that for Th from
Pa is up to 800,

Cafasso gt_a_l.73 determined the partition coefficient of a number of elements,
including U and Pu, between liquid lead and zinc at 703°C. The results (Zn/Pb) are
Pd:600, U:21.5, Pu:7.3, Ce:3.4, Sr:0.05,

D.3 Ion Exchange

The phenomenon of ion exchange is of great utility in the radiochemaical separa-
tion of Pu. Cationic Pu in dilute, non-complexing, acid solution will readily adsorb
on cation resin in the hydrogen or alkali metal form. On the other hand Pu(IV) and
Pu(V]) form anionic complexes in moderately concentrated nitric or hydrochloric acids
and s0 will adsorb on anion exchange resins. Anion and cation exchange methods are
thus both usable to separate Pu. The anion exchange separation is especially valuable
in the laboratory because of the simple equipment required, the ease of manipulation,
and the excellent decontamination from fission products by the use of redox cycles.

Recently synthetic inorganic cation exchangers such as zirconium phosphate have
been developed,

A good introduction to the subject of ion exchange in the actinides is contained in
Chapter 7 of Seaborg and Katz.l The review of Hyde 17 is valuable for ion exchange
separations of the actinides. The general gsubject of ion exchange has been reviewed
many times. The books of Helfferich175 and Samuelson348 are good references
to the theory and applications of ion exchangers. Samuelson has a good review of
recent work done on actinides. Helfferich gives a table of the names and properties
of commercially available J".on-exchange materials. Kraus and Nel.":zon241 reviewed
the general subject of ion-exchange separations in 1957, while [—Iard.y162 reviewed
the ion exchange data for actinides in 1858,

Cation Exchagge

The general cation exchange reaction for an exchanger in the hydrogen

form (acid solution) is

M'P + bHR = MR, + bH" . 1)
In this equation R is an exchanger site. The exchange reaction is favored by a low
acid concentration or conversely, high acid can be used to displace the metal from the
exchanger by mass action. Anocther way to remove metal ions from the exchanger is
to decrease the concentration of M+b by complexing. In general, the absorbability of
cations on ion exchangers increases with increasing charge and decreasing hydrated
radius. Thus, the order of absorbability on cation exchangers for Pu is Pu(IV)
> Pu(Ill) > PU(VI). For example, Schubert 358 found the following adsorption affinity
for the strong base cation resin Amberlite IR-1: Th(IV)> Pu(IV)> La(Ill) Rare
Earths > Y(III) Rare Earths > Ba(II)> Cs(I)> Sr(II) > U02++. All Pu species are
absorbed well at low acld concentration, and are desorbed at high acid concentrations,
However, many anions form neutral or anionic complexes with Pu in all of its oxida-
tion states, and therefore Pu may be desorbed by reaction with the anion of the acid,
as well as the massg action displacement.

The sulfonated cross-linked polystyrene resins have been by far the most
popular materials for the separation of inorganic species, including the actinides.
Typical of these is Dowex-50. This resin is usually specified ag "X 4" or "X 12,” ete.,
which means 4% or 12%, etc. divinylbenzene was added to the styrene in the

75
-

polymerization of the resin to provide the crogs linkage. In general, the low-cross-
linked resins have the advantage of faster kinetics, but also have the disadvantage of
greater volume change with changing ionic milieu,

As mentioned above, under non-complexing conditions, i.e., dilute acidic
solution, the absorption of Pu is esgentially independent of the anions present. How-
ever, many anions form Pu complexes at moderate concentrations, which makes the
elution behavior of Pu variable.

The elution behavior of Pu on cation resin is summarized in Fig. 39,
where the distribution coefficient for Pu(Il), Pu(lV), and Pu({VI) on Dowex-50 is plotted
ag a function of the acid molarity,

MOLARITY OF ACID

Fig, 39. Typical distribution coefficients of Pu on Dowex 50 in common acidic solu-
tions.

These data are intended to be only illustrative of the behavior of Pu. In
some caseg, the data of other actinides (e. g.-Am(II), U(VI)) were adjusted to corre-
pond to Pu in the same valance state. The data in every case were taken from litera-
ture mentioned later in this section.

' In general, the slopes of the curves are steeper for HNO3, H2504, and
HCI1O, than for HCl. A strong increase in the distribution coefficient in HC1O, at high
acidities is shown for Pu(Ill) and Pu(VI). This increase occurs in a great number of
elements,soo and probably also for Pu(IV).

The classic work on cation exchange of the actinide elements in HC1 solu-
tion was done by Diamond et al. 117

whose principal results are shown in Fig, 40 as
a plot of relative volumes required to elute tracer amounts of the ions from a Dowex-
50 column 10 cm long by 1 or 1.5 mm in diameter. These data are proportional to the
distribution coefficients, and illustrate the separations obtainable in this system.

The points for the. Pu species have been connected to make a crude elution pogiton vs
HCl concentration plot. The exireme decrease of the Pu(IV) elution position in going
from 3.2 to 9.3 M HCI is undoubtedly due to the formation of 'an anionic chloride
complex. The tetravalent actinides elute in this sequence: Pu, Np, U, Th; i.e., Th
has the highest distribution coefficient at any HCIl concentration. This order of elution

is in accord with the decreasing hydrated radii in going from Pu to Th. Th(IV) was not

the tetravalent actinides under slightly different conditions is shown in Fig. 41 to show
the relative elution position of Th(IV). The well-known separation of the trivalent
actinides and lanthanides is illustrated by the increase in the elution positions of the
lanthanides at high acidities,

Nelson _eiﬂ.So summarized the cation exchange behavior of most of
the elements in HC1l, The summary is in Fig. 42 as a periodic table of DV ve HCll

included, the curves for Th(IV), U(VI), and Am(OI) permit a normalization to the data
of Diamond et al. 117

Strelow 395 jnve stigated the cation exchange behavior of 43 elements on
Dowex-50 X B resin at HCl concentrations up to 4 M with results in general agreement
with those above. He arranged the elements in decreasing order of the equilibrium
distribution coefficients in 1 M HCl. The values ranged from 7250 for Zr{Iv) to 0.3
for Hg-H-. The distribution coefficient of Th(IV), the only actinide studied, wag 2049,

factor of 330 for Pu in this process. Decontamination factors of approximately 20 to
30 for Zr and Nb, and 2.4 tc 8 for most other ions were obtained.

During the entire process the Pu is kept trivalent for several reasons;
among these are (1) the Pu isg initially trivalent as it is stripped from TBP in the
Purex process, (2) oxidation during adsorption liberates gasses which may channel the
resin and (3) Pu(OI) is more eagily desorbed, permitting a higher concentration factor.

resin. The Pu(IV) is then eluted with 3 M HN03.

The preparation of cation exchange resin beads with scintillating properties
was reported by Heimbuch and Gee. 172 Polyvinyl toluene-divinylbenzene rnixtures
were polymerized with p-terphenyl and 1, 4-bis- 2-(5-phenyloxyazolyl) -benzene as
scintillators. The resin beads were then surface-gulfonated, to give capacities rang-
ing from 0.01 to 0.1 milliquivalents/gram, Srgo, Pu239, ﬁnd P0210 have been
adsorbed with this resin and counted with efficiencies from 30 to 50% of the adsorbed
activity. Several applications are suggested:

1. Easy sample preparation for adsorbable radionuclides.
2. A combination of concentration of ions from dilute solution and sample preparation.
3. Rapid qualitative analysis for radionuclides in dilute solutions.

Inorganic Ion Exchangers

 

Although inorganic ion exchangers have been long known, they have been
largely superseded by the synthetic resins, principally because of the higher
capacities and more tractable physical characteristics obtainable in the synthetic
exchangers. However experimentation has continued on natural and synthetic com-
pounds. In the actinide field this work has proceeded primarily toward the finding of
better geparations from fission products, The inorganic exchangers are also quite
resistant to radiation damage, which is an advantage in process applications.

A general discussion of the ion exchange properties of hydrous oxides has

been given by Kraus et al. 242 Inorganic phosphates as ion exchange materials have
been reported. 31, 1.3 The use of zirconium phosphate to separate Pu, U, and

fission products has been reported by Gal and Ruvarac. 140

Equilibrium distribution

column. After washing the column, the Pu and Cs are removed with 8 M HNOa. The
Zr and most.of the Nb stay on the column. Of the ions studied, only Cs follows the
Pu and must be separated by an additional step.

1to 10 M HCl. The Rf values reached a maximum around 6 M HCI and ranged from
0.27 for U(IV) to 0.50 for U(VI), the other ions falling in between. The ions of lower

valency tended to have lower Rf values,

 

Bildestein ‘_at;al.ﬂ geparated U and Pu by several paper chromatographic
methods, using different combinations of solvent and acid. The use of ion-exchange
paper to separate U and Pu was also reported by these workers. For example, with
Whatman ET-20 using 6 M HC1 as a developer, the R, values are 0.56 and 0.98 for U
and Pu, respectively. The oxidation states of the U and Pu were not specified.

‘F'ink and Fink 131 investigated many combinations of solvent and acid to
develop paper chromatograms of both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI). In most systems Pu(lV)
failed to move or streaked, but in a few cases moved quantitatively. The resgults
indicated Pu(VI) and U(VI} might be separated in a methyl ethyl ketone — dilute nitric

acid system.

Anion Exchange

The behavior of the actinide elements in various oxidation states on a
strong base anion exchange resin (typically Dowex 1 or 2) in HCl is shown in Table IV-
29. Strong adsorption of the actinides in the higher oxidation states (IV-VI) occurs at
HC1 concentrations above 6 M while desorption occurs below 2 M HCI,

A convenient way of separating Pu from other actinides and most other
elements is to adsorb Pu{IV) or Pu(VI) onto such a resin from> 6 M HCI solution,
wash with HCl, and desorb by reducing the Pu to the trivalent with a suitable reducing

agent. This method is so simple and effective that it has become one of the standard
laboratory methods for the separation of Pu, as well as in larger scale process plants.
Pu(IV) may be also adsorbed from 7 M HNO3 solutions and desorbed either
by dilute acid or by reduction. The distribution coefficients and separation factors
from fission products are higher than in the HCI system, but the room temperature
reactions are slower, resulting in some loss of convenience, 325

hag summarized equilibrium data for the actinides in HNO3 and
HC1 solutions for various strong base quaternary anion resins. These are shown in
Fig. 53. The Pu(IV) data in HNO4 show significant differences for different resins
and different workers. The species adsorbed from 7 M HNO3 has been shown to be

Data for the adsorption of other elements on Dowex 1 from HCI1 solutions 240

actinides in the higher valence states is shown by Fig. 55.

Many examples exist of the use of anion exchange resins for Pu separations,
both in HC1 and HNO, solutions. Adsorption in 8 to 12 M HCI and elution by reduction

of the somewhat greater selectivity and removal of iron of the nitrate system with the

methods have been incorporated in sequential separation schemes for Pu and many

108,432, 433,434

other elements. Np and Pu have been separated by reduction of the

Pu with NH4I before adsorption on the resin, 204
The removal of macro amounts of Pu before analysis of other elements is

280,405, 319, 55

commonly done by anion exchange either from HNO, or HCI1 solutions

for example . ’

The separation of Pu irom U by adsorption of U(VI) on anion exchange regin
in 60% ethanol which is 2 M in HCl has been reported. 298 Pu is reduced to Pu(Ill)
with hydroxylamine and is not adsorbed in this form. The advantage of this system
over a pure aqueous one is low shrinkage of the resin and rapid adsorption and de-
sorption of the U(VI).

In the nifrate system Pu is usually adsorbed from 6 to 8 M HNO3 because
the distribution coefficient decreases above this concentration and because resin de-
gradation becomes a problem at high acid concentrations. The applications are either
to separate Pu, or to separate other materials from Pu.

Roberts and Brauer 333 separate Am, Pu, and Np by adsorbing the Pu
and Np from 8 M HNOS, eluting the Pu with 0,02 M ferrous sulfamate, and finally
eluting Np by oxidation with Ce(IV) sulfate in 0.25 M HNOS. In another method, Th is
included in the separation scheme by adsorption of Th(IV), Pu(IV) and Np from 8 M
HNOS, elution of the Thby 12 M HCl, of Puby 12 M HCI - 0.1 M NH4I, and of Np by
4 M HCl. These authors report a clean separation with greater than 95% yields by
both methods.

anion exchange methods in analysis of Pu-"'fissium" binary alloys for these elements.

rapid separation of Pu from other ions. The 7 M I—INO3 solution of the ions ig slurried
with about half of the resin to adsorb the bulk of the Pu before placing in a column
containing the other half of the resin. The solution can then be run through the column
at a more rapid rate without Pu breakthrough, because most of the Pu is already
adsorbed. Thesge authors used a low cross-linked resin (Dowex 1 X 2) to speed the
kinetics of the adsorption reaction. They report greater than 99,9% recovery of the
Pu by this technique when mixed with substantial quantities of over 40 elements, The
Pu is desorbed with an HC1-HF mixture, again to speed the elution. |

Anion exchange from HNO, solutions is used ag a unit process in a number

3
of large scale processes of different types. Among these are: (1) the concentration

and purification of Pu following a solvent extraction separation; 338, 339, 340, 325, 255

(2) the recovery of Pu metal scrap; 336, 331

and (3) the main separation step from

fission products.

The separation of Pu and Th in HCI1 solutions has also been
described.

logical materials, The counting was done by a single-phase mixture of sample in

Electrolytic Separation Methods

 

Separation methods based on electrolysis have been used for radiochemical
applications, but are not common because of the relative complexity of the method.

In very early work, Cook 101 found that Pu could not be separated from Np and U by

electrodeposition from acetate solutions at pH 6-~7. However, Samartseva 344 found
that U, Pu, and Np could be separated by electrolysis from nitric acid 'solutions by
varying the pH. His results are shown in Fig. 56 as a plot of % yield vs pH for the
gtated conditions. Optimum conditions _f(_Jr the separation are stated as (1) current
density 750-1000 ma/ cmz, (2) plating time 2 to 3 hours, and (3) solution volume 20 to
40 ml.

Samartseva also found that electrolytic separation of Pu was successful against
many competing ions in concentrations up to 0.5 mg/ml. Among the ions tested were
Fe, Al, La, Ba, Cr, Mn, Ca, Mg, Bk, and Na, Of these only Fe interferred with the
separation to an appreciable extent. Oxalic acid at 0.002 M concentration was added

to complex the Fe.

On the other hand, Sinitsyna et al.384 found that the deposition of U and Pu

was strongly dependent on pH and current density, but that quantitative separations
could not be achieved at any pll from nitric acid solutions and acetate buffers.

Rein Qt_g_l_.azg separated Pu from Cr, Co, Ni, FFe, Pb, Mn, Sn, and Zn by
deposition of these elements on a Hg cathode [rom 1 N HCI. Por’l:ersz1 found that
Pu metal could be deposited on a mercury cathode from an organic solution, and
determined that dimethyl sulfoxide solution saturated with the metal chloride was the

best solvent among those investigated.322

V. DISSOLUTION OF PLUTONIUM SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS
A. Metallic Plutonium

Plutonium metal dissolves in HCl and other halogen acids, but not in H'NO3 or

concentrated H,SO,. Dilute H,SO, attacks Pu slowly.! The addition of HF to HNO,

274
renders Pu svr::luble.428 Sulfamic acid has been used to dissolve Pu metal.zlo

Pu-Al alloys can be dissolved in 6 M HNOS -0.056 M Hg‘(NO3)2 - 0.02 M HF,
as well as HCI1 and HC104. An alternative method is to dissolve the Al in a solution

of NaOH - NaNO,. The Pu and other actinide elements can then be dissolved in boiling

B. Other Compounds

Pqu, if ignited, dissolves only with great difficulty in the usual acids. Boiling
with concentrated nitric acid plus 0.005 M HF,445’328 with B5-100% H3P04 at 200° or
with 5-6 M HI451 have been recommended methods. Another method is fusion with

ammonium bifluoride, followed by treatment with aqueous aluminum nitrate or

107,62

acid. Ignited Pu oxalates and fluorides have been dissolved by fusion with

potassium bisulfate, dissolving the residuein water to precipitate Pu(OH)4, and finally

used to dissolve Pu-containing samples.

C. Biological and Environmental Samples

The Pu in thece samples ranges {rom readily soluble in the case of metabolized
plutonium in excreted samples, to extremely refractory in the case of fallout samples.
Nielsen and Beas‘.ley303 describe methods for dissolving various biological samples.
Most procedures for dissolving fallout or other environmental samples involve treat-

ment with HF or a basic fusion step which renders the Pu soluble in acids.

VI. SOURCE PREPARATION AND COUNTING METHODS
A. Source Preparation

A universal problem in Pu radiochemistry is the preparation of sources suitable
for counting. Owing to the short range of alpha particles in matter, the thickness of
foreign material on the counting sample is limited to approximately one mg/crn2 for
counting without serious loss. The requirements are much more severe if the ratios
of alpha-emitting isotopes are to be determined by energy analysis. This is so because
an alpha particle will be degraded in energy by interaction with the surrounding medium,
and the resulting pulse height distribution will be smeared out.

Most of the methods used for preparing alpha counting sources in use today were
developed in the Manhattan Project. Jaffey and Hufford and Scott189 summarize the
project experience. Source mounting techniques are, in general, a trade-off of
quantitativity on the one hand with thinness on the other. In assay work it is very

important to be quantitative but not so important to have a "thin'" sample. On ihe other

26
hand, for the separation of alpha particle energies by energy analysis the thinness of
the source is paramount, while guantitativity is not required, at least in the case of
isotopic dilution analytical methods.

Table VI-30 is a surnmary of the project method for alpha source preparation. The
reviews mentioned above are the primary source of this information and should be con-
sulted for more detail and literature references. Other general reviews may be con-
sulted for a discussion of the problem of mounting thin sou.r'ces.mz’a86’307

Two of the most widely used methods for preparation of alpha sources on a metal
backing for counting or spectroscopyare (1) direct evaporationof an aqueous or organic
solution and (2) electrodeposgition. Other methods, such as volatilization of the sample in
a vacuum, adsorption from an agqueous solution, are not so widely used. However, the
method of vacuum 'flashing' from a tungsten filament produces very satisfactory sources

and is in routine use in some laboratories. (See for example Procedure 4 in Sect. VIII.)

A.l Direct Evaporation

 

This method has the advantage of speed and simplicity and the disadvantage of
tending to concentrate any mass present in the solution to produce local thick areas. The

method for the determination of Pu utilizes direct evaporation of a slurry

446 (Procedure 1 in Sect.

3—Pu, followed by alpha counting to determine the Pu
However, in methods which depend on alpha energy analysis, direct evaporation of even
a ""carrier free' solution will not be completely satisfactory. The reason for this failure
lies in the above mentioned concentration effect to produce an effectively "thick' plate.
The great advantage of other methods in this regard ig that the Pu and impurities in the
solution to be plated are spread evenly over the entire area of the plate.

Tucl-:qt06 describes a method for evaporating organic solutions of alpha-emitting ma-
terials by heating only the edge of a circular plate, thus confining the liquid to the center.

The same principle was used by \a‘Vestru.m426 to evaporate sulfuric acid solutions.

A. 2 Electrodeposition

This method has the advantage of producing thin uniform plates suitable for energy
analysis of the alpha particles, and the disadvantage of requiring a relatively complex
apparatus and relatively greater effort. The time to produce one sample can be as much
as two hours.

K0233

Cm. He chose a buffered solution of formic, perchloric or sulfuric acid and ammonium

gives specific conditions for electrodeposition of the actinides from Th to

formate and achieved high yields for up to 100 ug of Pu at current densities of 100-300
rnA/crnz. The deposition of all these elements occurs as a precipitation reaction ai the
cathode. In the case of Pu, the compound precipitated is Pu(OH)4 (hydrated). Moore
and SmithzBB also used an acid solution of ammonium oxalate to electrodeposit Pu.
Mi’cchellﬂ""-:'2 gives a rapid method for electroplating trace quantities of actinides from
HCl-ammonium chloride solutions. He gets essentially queanlitative deposition in 15
minutes from a ¢.1-0.2 g/ml chloride solution at pH about 1 using a current density of
1 A/cmz.

give a detailed procedure for electrodepositon of Pu(VI) from
1-2 N KOH solution. The Pu was oxidized with ozone. This method has the disadvantage

that all elements which precipitate in basic solution interfere with the deposition.
A. 3 Other Methods

El Guebely and Silﬂ:kca-land]'22 report an interesting method for preparation of ex-
tremely thin Pu sources. The basis of the method is adsorption of Pu(IV) onto glass or
metal plates from dilute (~0.01 M) HCIl solutions, presumably as the polymeric form.
The method is not quantitative. Sa.I:".h..':n:'tseva347 reports that adsorption of Pu(IV) is 97-
! t0 1077 M HNO, solutions.

Carswell and MilﬁteadB1 made thin sources of U and Pu by electrostatically .

98% complete on Pt from 10~

focussing a jet of the material to be plated which was dissolved in a volatile solvent.

B. Counting

The subject of the determination of the amount of alpha radioactivity has been re-

viewed by JnsmffeyzoEi and recently by Johnson et a.l.,z13 169

and Hanna. These accounts
should be consulted for details of the various detection systems and literature references.
Table VI-31 lists the major types of counting systems with applications, advantages, and
disadvantages of each.

The ratios of the isotopes of Pu can be determined by making use of the difference
in the energies of the alpha particles in alpha pulse analysis.

The isotope Pu236 is very useful as a tracer in this method. This isotope is pre-

pared by the reaction

0?3 (4, n) Np236_E . 36
using highly enriched 1235 1o make the Pu23f 4g pure as possible. Since Pu236 is not
made by any neutron reaction on U, an unspiked sample need not be run if the Pu236 is

isotopically pure. Since the alpha energy Pu236

occurring isotopes (Pu239, Pu‘?40 238

is higher than that of the other commonly
), care must be taken that the added Pu236
activity is not very much greater than the activity of the other Pu isotopes. The reason

. and Pu

for this precaution is that imperfections in the sample and detecting instrument always
result in low-energy alpha particles which appear as a continuum or low energy ''tail" in
the spectrum. The subtraction of this tail becomes difficult if higher energy isotope pre-

dominates.

VI. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

Hazards to personnel who work with Pu in the leboratory arise primarily from two
causes. First, Pu is extremely poisonous becruse of its high specific alpha activity,
long biological half-life, and tendency to concentrate in the bone. Second, inadvertent
criticality may occur. A full discussion of these hazards is beyond the scope of this re-
view, but some general comments concerning precautions and techniques can be made.
The subject of personnel monitoring and radiation surveying has been treated by Mt:;rg‘an.291

Appleton and Dunster32 bave writien a manusl on the safe handling of Pu.

A. Radioactive Safety

The primary hazard is due to the posgibility of ingestion, since the alpha particles
are easilglr shielded and the gamma rediation associated with the common long-lived
lsotopes is slight. The hazard is better stated in terms of the activity level rather than
the mass, since the biological damuge is done by the alpha radioactivity and the isotopic
composition of Pu varies widely. Table VII-32 lists body burdens and maximum per-
missable concentrations (MPC) of Pu isotopes for continuous occupational exposure.
These data are taken from the National Bureau of Standards Handbook 69, which should
be consulted for details.

The most common control practice is total containment of high activities of
alpha-emitting isotopes by means of an enclosure which is maintained at a negative
air pressure with respect to the laboratory atmosphere. Operations are done either
with remote manipulators or with arm length gloves gealed to the enclosure,

In an intermediate or high-level alpha activity laboratory, a variety of
auxiliary equipment and practices in addition to the primary enclosure of the activity,
are necessary to insure personnel safety. Among these are:

1. Adequate monitoring of the accidental release or "spilling" of radioactivity.
This monitoring can be done by hand-held survey instruments, by continuous filtering
and monitoring of the laborat-ory air, and by persocnnel monitoring instfu.ments placed
at exits to the working area,

2. Protective devices and clothing. In most high-level radiochemical labora-
tories, special clothing is part of the laboratory practice. The availability of
respirators to prevent inhalation of airborne radioactivity in the event of a spill is
esgential.

3. Procedures for normal operation of the laboratory as well as emergency
procedures must be worked out in advance and understood by all personnel, ""Good
housekeeping," or the maintainance of a clean and orderly work space, should be
especially emphasized.

The kind, amount, and distribution of protective devices, as well as laboratory
practices for normal and emergency operation, vary considerably in detail from
laboratory to laboratory. This very brief introduction to the subject of the handling
and manipulation of large amounts of alpha activity iz intended to serve mainly as a
warning to the uninitiated. The subject of enclosures for radicactive materials is
treated fully in a review by Garden and Nielsen, 142

Low activity can, of course, be handled in an ordinary radiochemical laboratory.
The limit beyond which total containment becomes a necessity is not very well defined.
The concentration of the alpha-active material, as well as the nature of the operation
and the skill and care of the operator, are factors which must be considered. At
the level of one microcurie, ordinary laboratory procedures can be done if
reasonable care is taken, while at higher levels the operations become more and
more limited. At the millicurie level total containment becomes necessary for any

chemical operation. In any case, proper monitoring of the activity is essential.

B. Criticality Safety

This hazard is most generally met in the radiochemistry laboratory bjr only
permitting an "always safe'' amount of Pu in any room or area. This is an amount
which will not be a critical mass in any configuration or dispersed in any medium,
While the determination of the always-safe amount in a particular situation is beyond
the scope of this review, Table 32 gives basic data for Pu239, This table was ex-
tracted from the USAEC Publication "Nuclear Safety Guide" *4%

sulted for further information on this subject.

VIII. COLLECTION OF PROCEDURES
A. Introduction

The literature of Pu is replate with radiochemical and analytical separation
procedures. A survey disclosed 54 papers with procedures which were written in
enough detail to do justice to the name, and many more methods which could easily be
developed into procedures by making the directions quantitative or more complete.

Of the 54, 26 survived screening and are included in this collection. The basic

criteria for screening were fourfold: (1) distinctivenegs in chemistry, (2) completeness
in detailed instructions, (3) generality in application, and (4) utility. In some cases

a rather arbitrary choice had to be made between procedures which met these

criteria equally well,

The procedures are divided into (1) general radiochemical procedures, (2)
special purpose separation procedures, and (3) urinalysis procedures.

The procedures in the first group are concerned with purifying Pu from other
alpha emitiers and from fission products sufficiently for the purpose at hand, usually
for alpha counting or alpha pulse analysis. The starting materials range from reactor
target dissolver solutions of varying ages to fresh samples of nuclear explosion debris
to very dilute environmental samples. There are 13 of these procedures included.

The second group of procedures ig concerned with a specific separation involving
Pu. Two examples are the separation of Np and Pu and the removal of Pu before
analysis for impurities in Pu metal.

Urinalysis is a separate category, primarily because there are so many pro-
cedures in the literature, all purporting to do the same thing. The chemistry after
the initial separation step is, of course, similar to that in the other categories. The

urinalysis procedures included were chosen primarily for distinctiveness of chemistry.

Cr. G. A. Welch et al. (Ref. 446).

Qutline of Method

Hydroxylamine is added to the sample to reduce plutonium and chromium
to the trivalent state. The acidity of the solution is adjusted and lanthanum nitrate
carrier added. Lanthanum fluoride is precipitated by adding a limited amount of
ammonium fluoride and carries the plutonium with it, By strictly controlling the
amount of fluoride added the precipitation of iron and chromium is prevented. The
precipitate is separated by centrifuging, washed and mounted on a {lat stainless-steel
counting tray, and the a-activity measured with a scintillation counter calibrated
against standard sources.

Reagents

All reagents are analytical reagent quality where available.

1. Ammonium hydroxide, 9M

2. Nitric acid, 2M

3. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 5% w/v

4, Lanthanum nitrate solution, 5 mg La/mil.
Digsolve 7+ 8 g of lanthanum hyxahydrate in 500 ml of distilled water.

5. Ammonium fluoride solution, 12+ 5% w/v
Store in a polythene bottle,

6. Cellulose lacquer.
Dilute "ZAPON" lacquer with amyl acetate,

7. Standard Pu solution, 05 ug/ml.
Dilute a solution of known Pu concentration. The exact Pu concen-
tration of the diluted solution need not be known, but the isotopic
constitution should be eséentially the same as that of the samples

requiring analysis.

Procedure 2. Separation and determination of Pu by TTA extraction., F, L.. Moore
and J. E. Hudgens, Jr. (Ref. 287).

Outline of Methond

The_sample is pre-treated if necessary, with either I—_INO3 or by precipita-
ting LaF g and dissolving in Al{NO3)3-HNO,. The pre-treatment destroys any polymer
which may be present and assures the proper valence state (IV) for the TTA extraction.
Pu(lV) is extracted from 2 M HNOg and stripped into 10 M HNO,, evaporated onto a

plate, and counted. Yield is quantitative.

Reagents

Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 1 M, is prepared by dissolving 68.5 grams

of C.P. grade end diluting it to 1 liter.

Sodium nitrite, 1 M, is prepared by dissolving 69 grams of C. P. grade and
diluting it to 1 liter.

2-Thenoyltrifluoroacetone-xylene 0.5M, is prepared by dissolving 111 grams of
the ketone and diluting it to 1 liter with C. P. xylene. (2-Thenoyltrifluoro acetone
may be obtained from Graham, Crowley, and Associates, Inc., 5465 West Division
St., Chicago 51, Iil.)

Pretreatment

Nitric acid method. A suitable allquot of the sample solution is pipetted
into a 100-ml volumetric flask containing 13 ml of concentrated nitric acid. The solu-
tion is heated carefully to a low boil on a hot plate and the temperature is held just
under boiling for 5 min. The solution is then made to a known volume with distilled

water, The nitric acid concentration of this solution should be approximately 2M.

Fluoride method. A suitable aliquot (1 ml) of the sample solution is
pipetted into a 5-ml centrifuge cone, After addition of 0.4 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and 0.1 ml of lanthanum carrier (5 mg per ml) the solution is
mixed well. Then 0.3 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (5M) and 0.4 ml of hydro-
fluoric acid (27 M) are added and the solution is stirred with a platinum stirrer,
After a 5-min digestion at room temperature, the solution is centrifuged for 3 min.
Next, 0.1 ml of lanthanum carrier (5 mg per ml) is added and the supernatant is
stirred, care being taken not to disturb the precipitate.” After another 5-min digestion
at room temperature, the solution is centrifuged for 3 min and the supernatant is
removed with mild suction. The precipitate is washed twice with 0.5-ml portions of
1M nitric acid — 1 M hydrofluoric acid, centrifuging each time for 3 min. The
lanthanum fluoride precipitate containing the Pu is then dissolved in 0.3 ml of 2 M
aluminum nitrate and 1 ml of 2M nitric acid.

This treatment not only aids in depolymerizing Pu(IV) but offers a method of
removing the Pu from interferences, as sulfuric acid, before performing the extrac-
tion. The liquid-liquid extraction technique described in this paper has been applied

successfully for several years to the purification and isolation of Pu isotopes.

112
Procedure

The choice of the sample gize is governed by the magnitude of the con-
centration of Pu activity and of the beta and gamma ray emitters in the original
solution. The presence of high levels of radiocactivity must be congidered because of
the health hazard involved and because a beta ray counting rate of over 109 counts
per minute will interfere with the alpha counting on the Simpson proportional alpha
counter,

One ml of the sample solution (pretreated if necessary) is pipetted into
a 10-ml beaker., Three ml of 2 M nitric acid and 1 ml of 1M hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride solution are added. The solution is mixed thoroughly and heated at approxi-
mately 80°C. for 5 min, The volume of the solution is adjusted to approximately 4 ml
by the addition of several drops of 1 M nitric acid. The solution is transferred to a
30-ml separatory funnel using 2 ml of 1 M sodium nitrite, mixed thoroughly and
allowed to stand until gas evolution ceases. The aqueous phase at the time of extrac-
tion should be approximately 1 M in nitric acid.

The solution is extracted for 10 min with an equal volume of 0.5 M 2-thenoyltri-
fluoroacetone-xylene. When the two phases have disengaged, the aqueous phase is
drawn off and discarded. The organic phase is washed by mixing with an equal volume
of 1 M nitric acid for 3 min. After the phases have settled, the aqueous wash solution
is discarded, care being taken not to lose any of the organic phase. The Pu is then
stripped from the organic phase by mixing thoroughly for 2 min with an equal volume
of 10 M nitric acid. If the aqueous strip solution is too high in gamma radicactivity
for alpha measurement, the last traces of radiozirconium and protactinium may be
removed readily by a 5-min re-extraction of the 10 M nitric acid strip solution with
an equal volume of 0,5M 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone-xylene. Pu remains quantitatively
in the aqueous phase, The small percentage of iron extracted (produces a red color)
remains in the organic phase when the Pu is stripped into 10 M nitric acid. The
aqueous strip solution is drawn off into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 1 min,

A suitable aliquot is pipetted onto a platinum (or stainiess steel) plate and evaporated
to dryness under an infrared heat lamp, The plate containing the evaporated sample
aliquot is heated to a dull red heat over a Fisher burner to destroy organic matter
and counted in a suitable alpha counter. In this laboratory, the methane flow propor-

tional alpha counter is used almost exclusively,

deficient aluminum nitrate salting solution. Pu is stripped from the organic phase and
reduced to Pu(lll) with a hydroxylamine-iron(Il) mixture, oxidized to Pu(IV) with
nitrite, then quantitatively extracted into TTA.

ganate solution is stored in a dark bottle.

Unless otherwise stated, the Pu levels in ex-tractibns were approximately

Procedure 4. Plutonium R. J. Morrow (Ref. 293)

 

Outline of Method

The Pu is co-precipitated from acid solution with La{OH)3 with NH;OH.
The precipitate is washed with NaOH solution, dissolved and the co-precipitation
repeated using La(IOg)g as the carrier. The hydioxide precipitation is repeated and
the Pu adsorbed on an anion resin column from 8 M HNOg. The column is washed
successively with HNOj3 and 2 portions of 10 M HCl. Finally, the Pu is eluted with
a mixture of HCl and HI and mounted for counting,

Purification

This procedure is designed primarily for separation of Pu samples to be
alpha-counted; it does not yield samples highly purified from beta- and gamma-
emitters. Samples containing 1013 - 1014 atoms of Pu have been isolated from four-
day old solutions of 5 X 1013 figsions. No foreign alpha activities could be detected,
and the beta content was 107 dpm or less,

Yield

60% if an electroplating technique is used for the final step, and 35% if

vacuum volatilization is used.

Procedure

One operation can do 12 samples in 6 hours, exclusive of volatilization
or electroplating.
1. To an acid solution of mixed activities in a plastic centrifuge cone

add ~1 mg La*3

carrier and an appropriate amount of standardized
Pu alpha-emitting tracer, the isotope added and its level of activity
depending upon the isotope sought aﬁd its estimated level of activity.
Add 2-3 drops sat. NaNO2 solution and heat in a hot-waler bath for
five minutes.

2, Add enough conc. NH4OH to make the solution basic. Stir, and digest
at 60°C in a hot-water bath for five minutes. Centrifuge and discard
supernatant solution.

3. To the precipitate add 5 ml 25% NaOH solution, Siir and digest for 5
min at 60°C in a hot-water bath, Centrifuge and discard the supernatant
solution,

4. The hydroxide precipitate is then dissolved in a minimal volume of 3M
HCl and a volume of 0.5 M HIOj3 is added of the order of 4-5 times the
volume of HCI solution.

5. The precipitate is then digested for 10 min in a hot water bath.

§. The sample is centrifuged and the supernatant solution is decanted,
after which the precipitate is washed with 0,1 M HIOgq.

A minimal amount of concentrated HCl is used to dissolve the

precipitate with stirring.

After dissolution the sample is precipitated with sodium hydroxide

and centrifuged.

The supernatant solution is discarded and the precipitate is washed

with HyO and centrifuged after which the supernatant solution is again

discarded.

To precipitate, add enough 8 N HNOj saturated with HgBOg (usually

~5-10 drops) to dissolve. Heat in hot-water bath if necessary.

Pipet the solution onto a 3 mm i.d. X 6 em long Dowex A-1 (1 X 8)

Procedure 5, Plutoniurmn D. C. Hoffrnan (Ref. 185)

 

QOutline of Method

The essentially gpecific procedure for Pu utilizes the almost quantitative
carrying of Pu(IV) on lanthanum fluoride and also the great difference in ability of
Pu(Ill}) and Pu (IV) in 12 M HCl medium to be absorbed on a Dowex A-1 anion resin,
One cycle of the procedure serves to separate Pu from other o-emitters, and two
cycles usually gives complete decontamination from B-emitting fissian products.

The initial lanthanum fluoride precipitation, carried out in the presence
of hydroxylamine, is an excellent volume-reducing step and also eliminates many
elements (notably iron) which may interfere in the subsequent adsorption of Pu on
the resin column, After dissolution of the lanthanum fluoride precipitate in 12 M
HCI1, adsorption on the anion resin column of Np, Pu, and any traces of Fe and U
present is effected, while the rare-earths Am and Cm pass through the column. Pu
is eluted from the column after reduction to Pu(Ill) with hydriodic acid; Np is not
reduced to the +3 state and remains quantitatively behind. (A solution containing 15
ug of U235 was run through the procedure, and no fission counts above the usual
background of 0.1 - 0.2 smidgins (1 smidgin = 10-6 mg) could be detected.)

The Pu is collected directly from the resin column on 2-in. Pt plates
which are flamed, o-counted, and, if necessary, pulse-analyzed., The plates are
usually very clean and may be @-pulse-analyzed with a resolution of 1 - 1.5%.

Samples are usually run in quadruplicate and yields are determined in
one of two ways. Pu236 tracer to the extent of about one-fourth to one-half of the
total Pu @ -activity expected may be added to one or two of the original aliquote, On
completion of the analysis, the fraction of Pu236 in the sample is determine by pulse
analysis, thus permitting the calculation of yield. Yields may also be determined by
spiking two of the four samples with a standardized solution of Pu activity which is
at least five times as active as the aliquot to be analyzed. The average of the number
of cpm in the two unspiked samples is subtracted from the average in the two spiked
samples. The resulting value divided by the number of cpm in the spike gives the
yield. The chemical yield is usually about 97% and for a set of four aliquots analyzed
simultaneously is constant to within +1%. In analysis of solutions of very high ionic
strength the yields are somewhat lower (90-97%), probably because under these con-
ditions the lanthanum fluoride carrying step is less efficient, Quadruplicate analyses

can be performed in 3 h,

Dowex A-1 (10% cross-link, Nalcite SBR) anion resin slurry in H20.

Preparation

The 200-400 mesh moist solid is washed about three times with successive
poriions of water and conc. HCl, After each wash the resin is allowed to settle and
the liguid decanted by siphoning or by means of a vacuum pipet. The resin is then
stirred thoroughly with several times ita volume of water in a large gfaduated
cylinder, and the following fractions are withdrawn on the basis of sedimentation
rates: < (1 cm/min, <5 cm/min, <10 cm/min and > 10 cm/min, The <10 cm/min

fraction is employed in the procedure.

HI stock solution. Distill HI (Mallinckrodt analytical reagent grade,
5.5M in HI, 1.5% H3P02 preservative) under nitrogen. The HI cannot be used with-
out distillation, since the H‘.‘,‘PO2 preservative appears to cause the eluted drops to
attack the Pt coliection disks and make the samples unguitable for pulse analysis,
Commercial preparations of HI without preservative usually contain enough free
iodine to make them unsuitable. Even after storage under nitrogen, distilled HI is
slowly oxidized. Oxidation is inhibited by the addition of sufficient hydrazine (up to
20% by volume of 64-84% NyH, in H20) to decolorize the HI solution. The final
solution is about 4.4 M in HIL .

HI-HCI elutriant. 1 ml of HI stock solution is added to 9 ml of conc, HCI
to give a solution about 0.44M in HI. The precipitaté which resulté from the hydrazine
present is removed by centrifugation and the supernate is saturated with gaseous HCI.
The solution is permitted to come to equilibrium at room temperature before use and

since the solution is readily oxidized, fresh reagent is required every few days.

Equipment

Centrifuge

Block for holding centrifuge tubes

Fisher burner

Heat lamp

Pt digks: 2 in, diameter

Pt wire stirring rods

Transfer pipets and syringes

Vacuum trap for withdrawing supernates (optional)

10-cm glass ion exchange columns (see_* Note 4, Np procedure) (one per
sample) '

40-m]l conical centrifuges tubes: Pyrex 8140 (one per sample)

118
Procedure

Step 1. Pipet the samples (2 M in HCl or HNO,) into 40-ml long taper
conical centrifuge tubes. (1-ml aliquots are used if possible, although aliquots as
large as 25 ml can be taken if necessary). If tracer or spike is added to 1 or 2 of -
the samples, make the others up to the same volume with a solution of acid strength
identical to that of the tracer or spike. Stir,

Step 2. Add 1-2 drops of La carrier and then 2~4 drops of NH20H- HCl
per ml of solution. Make the solution at least 2.5M in HF by addition of conc.
reagent (Note 1). Agitate the solution and permit to stand for 5 min after the addi-
tion of each of the above reagents.

Step 3. Cén‘trifuge and digcard the supernate,

Step 4. Wash the precipitate with about 0.5 ml of 2M HF-2M HNO

solution. Stir, centrifuge and discard the supernate.

3

Step 5. Dissolve the LaF3 precipitate by adding 1 drop of saturated
H3BO3 gsolution, stirring, and then adding conc. HCI to a volume of 1.5-2.0 ml, The
solution may be warmed if necessary.

Step 6. Transfer the solution to a 5-cm Dowex A-1 regin column (see
Note 4 of Np procedure) which has been washed with 1-2 column volumes (Note 2) of
Solution I (Note 3). Wash the centrifuge tube with two l—m.'l' aliquots of Solution I.
The washes may be driven through the column with air pressure if so desired. The
effluent solutions from these washes may be used for the Am and Cm determinations;
if not to be so used the washes are discarded.

Step 7. Wash the sides of the centrifuge tube with 1.5 ml of conc. HC],
wash and remove the Pt stirring rods, centrifuge and pass the solution through the
column with the use of pressure.

Step 8. Add a few crystals of NH20H- HC] directly to the top of the resin
column. (This helps to prevent immediate oxidation of the HI solution by any traces
of HNO3 remaining on the column, ) Wash the centrifuge tube with 1.5 ml of cone.
HCI1, transfer the washings to the column, and permit them to pass through. The
column should not be permitted to run dry while air pressure is being applied to it,
since air bubbles will be forced into the column and channeling and erratic elution of
activity may occur,

Step 9. . 1-2 ml of the HI-HCI elutriant is put on the top of the column and
no pressure is applied during elution. The dark band of the elutriant may be seen
migrating down the column, The activity appears to be concentrated about the lower
edge of the elutriant band and most of it comes off in a 6- to 8-drop peak. However,
to obtain quantitative ylelds, drop collection is begun on a 2-in. Pt disk when the band
is about 0.8 cm from the end of the column, and collection is continued for 10-15
drops after the band has reached the end of the column. This allows for possible
irregularities in the band or misjudgements regarding its position. The drops taken
before the band reaches the end of the column are arranged on the periphery of the Pt
disk, and those which are expected to contain most of the activity are collected near

the center. The drops are not permitted to run together.

120
Step 10. Place the Pt disk under a heat lamp and allow the drops to
evaporate. Heat the plate to red heat in an open flame and cool; @-count if the
origiﬁal aliquot was spiked, and pulse analyze and e-count if Pu236 tracer was
employed (Notes 4 and 5). '

Notes

1. When an appreciable quantity of Fe is present, en'ou.gh HF must be
added not only to complex this element (thus decolorizing the solution) but also to
precipitate La carrier.

2. The column volume is defined as about one-half the volume calculated
from the actual dimensions of the column, The column volume may, of course, be
measured experimentally in each case if the interfaces can be clearly seen.

3. The presence of conc, HNO3 in Solution I is necessary to destroy the
reducing properties of the original resin and thus avoid premature reduction of Pu(IV)
to the tripositive state.

4, If it is desired to fisgsion count the Pu, plates may be prepared by
taking the activity directly from the column. However, if any drops are permitted
to run together giving an extreme ''bathtub effect," the figsion counting results are
invariably toc low. To avoid such effects atiributable to sample thickness, the
following procedure for plate preparation is employed.

The Pu activity is evaporated on a 1-mil W filament under a heat lamp,
but the filament is not flamed. It is then placed in a vacuum evaporating apparatus
constrﬁcted at this Laboratory. The chamber of the apparatus is evacudted to
5 X 10-4 mm or less of Hg pressure and the filament is heated rapidly several {imes
to about 1300°C to remove readily volatile material. A 1-in, diameter collector
plate is then placed in position directly above the sample (1/4 to 1/2-in, away) and
the filament is heated to 2000°C for a few seconds to violatilize Pu. The Pt disk is
then flamed and mounted for fission counting. The yields vary, depending upon the
size of the sample being evaporated and also upon the distance between the filament
and the disk, but are ugually about 40%. By careful control of the W filament tempera-
tures, plates having no visible deposit and checking to within 0,1% are ordinarily
obtained.

5. The Np activity whcih quantitatively remains on the column after
elution of Pu may be removed in the following manner:

Step 1: By means of pressure, run conc. HCI containing several
drops of HNO3 per ml through the column until the dark color has been removed,
Discard the effluent, (During this process the column may separate as a result of
bubbling, etc,, but can be resettled by means of pressure.)

Step 2. Wash the resin with conc, HCI and pressure, permitting the
column to rebed itself,

Step 3. Elute the Np with 0.1 N HCl, If the yield is very low after
only one elution with 0,1 M HC], about three cycles of elution alternately with ¢,1 M
HCI and conc. HCI usually give yields up to 85%. '

Irradiated Reactor Targets R. G. Hart, M. Lounsbury, C. B. Bigham, L. P. V. Corriveau,
F. Girardi (Ref. 167)

 

Qutline of Method

The Pu is adsorbed on anion exchange resion (Dowex 1) from 7-11 M
HNO3 , the U and most of the fission products passing through. The Pu is then
eluted by reduction with 1 M N'H20H- HNO3 and impu.rit_.ies are extracted into TBP
while the Pu remains as Pu(IlI). The Pu is then precipitated as the hydroxide, dis-
solved in HNO3 and extracted into TBP. Finally, the Pu is back-extracted by
NHZOH . I-I'NO3 ,

This procedure describes two specific types of analyses to be done on

by mass spectrograph analysis, and (2) isotopic dilution by PuZBB

pulse analysis. These analyses are described before the separation procedure is given,

Procedure

Total Pu, isotopic dilution with Pu240.

Two aliquots, one containing

~ 800 ug of Pu and the other containing ~ 400 ug of Pu, are removed from the dissolver
solution. Only the second aliquot need be measured accurately. To the second aliquot
is added ~ 400 ug of Pu containing a high percentage of the heavier isotopes. This
aliquot must be accurately measured and the Pu concentration and isotopic composi-
tion must be accurately known. The samples are allowed to stand for 4 or 5 days to
allow the spiked sample to reach isotopic equilibriurn:l and are then carried through

the Separation procedure. The purified Pu is then mass analysed. From the isotopic

 

compositions of the standard, the unknown and the mixture, and the total Pu content

of the standard, it is possible to calculate the total Pu concentration in the unknown.,

238

Total Pu, isotopic dilution with Pu Two aliquots, one containing

 

~ 100 pug of Pu and the other containing ~ 50 ug of Pu, are removed from the dissolver
solution. Only the second need be meeasured accurately. To the second aliquot is
added ~0.19 ug of Pu238, This aliquot must be accurately measured and the Pu238
digintegration rate of the solution must be accurately known. Both samples are
diluted to 15 ml with 7 M nitric acid, and are allowed to stand for 4 or 5 days to
allow the spiked sample to reach isotopic equilibr-iurn.2 The two samples are now
carried through the Separation method and ¢-counting discs are prepared from each
as described in the following section. From the ratios of Pu238 to Pu23? in the
spiked and unspiked samples, the total disintegration rate of the standard Py238
solution, and the isotopic composition of ungpiked sample, it is possible to make an

accurate calculation of the total Pu content of the solution.

 

1No detailed study has been made to determine the length of time required to
reach isotopic equilibrium, but it is known that some considerable time is necessary,

Preparation of @-counting plates. An aliquot containing about 50 ug of U

 

was transferred to a stainless steel source tray in the usual manner, The micropipette
used was then washed three times with a solution of tetraethylene glycol (TEG) in dilute
nitric acid (4 drops of TEG in 10 ml of 1 M nitric acid). The solution on the source
tray was then evaporated to dryness under an infrared lamp and the disc was ignited

to redness, The evaporation must take place very slowly to avoid decomposition of

TEG by hot nitric acid. Two to three hours are necessary for the drying.

Separation procedure

 

(1) The aliquot, in 7-11 M nitric acid, was passed through a 1-ml column
of 250-mesh Dowex 1 in the nitrate form to absorb the anionic Pu
nitrate complex.

(2) The uranium and fission products were washed through the column
with 20 ml of 7.5 M nitric acid. The strong acid was then displaced
with 1 ml of 1 M nitric acid.

(3) An aliquot of the effluent containing ~40 mg of U was retained for U
isotopic analysis and the remainder wasg discarded.

(4) The Pu was eluted from the column with 4 ml of 1,0 M hydroxylamine
nitrate.

(5) The Pu solution was extracted five times with 2 ml portions of 30%
TBP-solirol to remove any U left with the Pu,

(8) The Pu was precipitated from the aqueous phase with concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, dissolved in 100 A of concentrated nitric acid,
diluted to 0.5 ml and extracted with two 0.5-ml portions of 30% TBP-
soltrol,3

{7) The Pu was then backwashed from the organic phase with 3 half-volume
1 M hydroxylamine nitrate washes, precipitated with ammonium hydro-
xide, washed once with water, and dissolved in 20 A of concentrated
nitric acid. The solution was then diluted to 100 A with 1 M nitric

acid.

sition products.

Plutonjium Calculation

To determine the amount of Pu in the original sample, it is necessary to

measure in a Frisch chamber the ¢ spectrum of the plate prepared in step 8. The

239 and Pu240 activity to Pu236 activity is calculated. If the ratio is

236 239

ratio of. Pu

multiplied by the original activity of Pu
Pu240

obtained. The specific activity of the mixture is calculated from that of the individual

239 plus Pu240 activity can be converted to Pu239 plus Pu2.40

added, the original activity of Pu

can be obtained. From the mass analysis a Pu239 to Pu240 atom ratio is

plus

Outline of Method

The Pu, U and figsion products are adsorbed on a cation exchange column
from 0.3-0.5 M HNO3 and washed with 0.5 M HNOS. The U and fission products are
then eluted with 2.0 M HC], and the Pu is stripped with 8 M HCl. The Pu is then
adsorbed onto anion exchange resin, washed with 8 M HCl, and finally stripped with
2 M HCI.

Procedure

Separation of Plutonium from Uranium Metal, J. Rydberg (Ref. 341)

Qutline of Method

This procedure makes use of the co-precipitation properties of the different
oxidation states of Pu on BiPO4. The Pu is first oxidized to Pu({VI) which does not

carry on BiP04, and then reduced to Pu(IV) which carries, An additicnal purification

step is provided by extraction into TTA. Yield is greater than 60%.

Procedure

1.

The U sample is dissolved in hot conc, HNO3 and kept at 90°C for 30
min, giving a solution of U(VI) and Pu(IV).

The solution is diluted to 5 M in HNO, and solid NaBiO3 is added to
oxidize Pu to the +6 valency state.

The solution is made 0.1 M in HNO, (if it becomes turbid, HNO, is
added until the solution is clear) and 0.1 M in phosphate. The BiPO4

precipitate is centrifuged off. This precipitate carries most of the

3

fission products, and especially those with a chemistry similar to
Pu(IV).

The supernatant solution containing Pu(VI) ig made 1 M in HNO3 ,

0.05 M in NoH, and 0.005 M in Fe''. In this solution Pu is rapidly
reduced to Pu(III).

The solution is diluted to 0.1 M in HNO, and made 0.1 M in phosphate.
Bi™1 is then added (1 drop 0.1 M Bi' ' for each ml solution) to
precipitate BiPO4 , which carries all the Pu, The precipitate, which
ig usually contaminated with some U is centrifuged off and washed,
The phosphates in the precipitate are converted into hydroxides by
treating with warm ~10 M KOH. After centrifuging the solution is

Purification of Plutonium from Uranium and Fission Products

J. Rydberg (Ref, 341)

Oufline of Method

The method takes advantage of the fact that Zr and Nb are adsorbed very

well on silica gel from strong nitric acid solutions. Further decontamination from

fission products is achieved by precipitation of CuS from a 0.5 M HNO:3 solution.
Pu(IV) does not carry. Finally the Pu{lV) is extracted into TTA. Yield is greater

than 90%. Purification is approximately 106 from B—y radiation of fission products.

Procedure

1.

2.

The U03 sample is dissolved in hot conc. HNO3 and kept at 20°C for
30 min, giving a solution of U(VI) and Pu(IV),
The acidity of the cooled solution is adjustied to 6 M in HNO3 , and the

. solution is run through two columns of SiO2 gel. This removes most

of the Zr and Nb. The columns have a dimeter of 0.8 ¢cm and a

length of 10 cm.

Cu-H-, La*tt and ZrO-H- (1 drop 0.1 M carrier for each ml of solution)
are added to the solution, and it is then diluted to 0.5 M in HN03. On
the addition of HZS‘ CuS precipitates and carr’ies most of the fission
products with sulfides insoluble in 0.5 M HNOS. The precipitate

After a two-fold dilution of the organic phase with benzene, Pu(IV)
can be extracted back into an aqueous phase with 10 M HNO3 or

precipitate to settle for at least 2 hr, by preference overnight.

4, Filter through a fine-fritied funnel, the stem of which has been drawn
into a wide capillary. Use 25 ml of 8 N HCL in total to rinse the beaker
and the glass rod ahd to dissolve the precipitate on the funnel. Suck the
solution through the funnel directly into a 50-ml narrow-necked flask placed
in a filtering flask with cut-off bottom, resting on a ground-glass plate.

Alloys by TBP Extraction from Chloride Solutions R. P. Larsen and C. A. Seils, Jr.
(Ref. 249)

 

Qutline of Method
The U and Pu are reduced to U(IV) and Pu(Ill) by contact with Mg turnings
in 2 2 M HCI solution. The U is then extracted into TBP. The Pu is then oxidized to
Pu(IV) with NaNO3 and exiracted into TBP and back-extracted with 0.1 M HCl. The
Pu is then precipitated as the hydroxide and taken up in HNO:3 for spectrophotometric

determination.

Reagents

Unless otherwise stated, reagent grade materials are used.

1. Tributyl phosphate, 30-volume % in carbon tetrachloride.

2. Tributyl phosphate, 30 volume % in Amsco-140 {a kerosine distillate).

3. Dilute 300 ml of tributyl phosphate (Commercial Solvents Corp.) to 1
liter with carbon tetrachloride (or Amsco-140). Scrub once with 200 ml
of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide to remove traces of mono- and dibutyl phos-
phate. Scrub four times with distilled water and filer through a large dry

filter paper to remove cloudiness.

Procedure

Dissolve the alloy sample, using the procedure described by Larsen® for
this type of material, and dilute to volume.

Pipette an aliquot containing 10 to 20 mg of Pu into a 50-ml Erlenmeyer
flask. For 20% Pu alloys, there will be 35 to 70 mg of U, more than enough for its
determination. Convert to a chloride medium by evaporation to near dryness (3X)
with 12M hydrochloric acid. Adjust the volume to 10 ml and the hydrochloric acid
concentration to about 2M. Add approximately 0.1 g of Mg turnings over a period of
several minutes. Using a double layer of glass fiber filter paper in a filter chimney
assembly, separate the precipitated Group VIII elements by filtration, and catch the
filtrate in a 60-ml cylindrical separatory funnel. Rinse the flask and filtering assem-
bly with three 5-ml portions of 12M hydrochloric acid. Add 15 ml of 30% tributyl phos-
phate in carbon tetrachloride and shake for 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and
transfer the U-béaring organic phase to a second 80-ml separatory funnel.

Repeat the extraction with 10 ml of 30% tributyl phosphate in carbon
tetrachloride and combine the U-bearing organic phases in the second separatory
funnel. Treat the Pu—beafing aqueous phase by the procedure outlined in the next
paragraph. Add 15 ml of 0.5M hydrochloric acid to the combined organic extracts
and shake for 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and drain the stripped organic
phase into a 60-ml separatory funnel. Add 10 ml of 0.2M hydrochloric acid and repeat
the stripping operation. Discard the organic phase and combine the aqueous strip
solutions in the second separatory funnel, Add 5 ml of carbon tetrachloride and shake

of 2-ml portions of 16M nitric acid. Add 5.0 ml of 16M nitric acid to dissolve the U.
Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask with water and make up to volume. Determine
U x-ray spectrometrically. For samples containing less U, use proportionately
smaller volumes of nitric acid and volumetric flasks (down to 5 ml).

Add approximately 100 mg of sodium nitrite to the agueous raffinate from
the U separation to oxidize the Pu to the quadrivalent state. Add 20 ml of tributyl
phosphate-Amsco-140 and equilibrate 1 min. {(Amsco-140 is used as the inert diluent
to give a light organic phase.) Discard the lower aqueous raffinate., Add 15 ml of
0.2M hydrochloric acid and equilibrate 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and irans-
fer the aqueous phase to a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 10 ml of 0.2M HCL to the
organic phase and repeat the stripping operation. Combine the aqueous strip solutions,
add 2 ml of 12M hydrochloric acid, and evaporate on a sand bath to reduce the volume
to approximately 2 ml. Transfer the solution to a 15-ml glass centrifuge cone with a
transfer pipette and dilute to 7ml with water. Add 0.5 ml of 20% hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride and let stand 15 min with occasional mixing. While mixing with a Pt stirring
wire, add 10M sodium hydroxide dropwise until plutonium hydroxide precipitates. Add
10 drops of sodium hydroxide solution in excess and let stand for 5 min. (Evaporation
is not a satisfactory volume-reduction step, as it does noi remove chloride. With the
nitrate introduced in the next step, oxidation of the Pu to the sexivalent state would
occur.) Centrifuge for 5 min and discard the clear supernate, Wash the precipitate
with water, centrifuge for 3 min, and discard the wash solution. Add 2.0 ml of 16M
nitric acid and stir to dissolve the precipitate. Heat the nitric acid solution in a
boiling water bath for 20 min. (This treatment will destroy any polymeric Pu which
may be present and ensure complete oxidation of the Pu io the quadrivalent state, If
the precipitate were digsolved in hot 3M nitric acid, some oxidation to the sexivalent
state would occur.) Allow the solution to cool and dilute to volume in a 10-ml volu-
metric flask with water. HRead the absorbance vs a reagent blank in 1-cm cells at
475 mu and a slit width of 0.02 mm. Calculate the Pu present from a calibration
factor prepared from a series of standards carried through the hydroxide precipitation
step only.

Procedure 16. Separation of Plutonium Before Spectrographic Analysis of
Impurities. Extraction Chromatography Method Using TBP ¥. Trowell (Ref. 405)

QOutline of Method

Pu in 8 M HNO, solution is adsorbed on a KelF/ TBP chromatographic
c¢olurnn and the impurities eluted with 8 M HNO3. Sc is added as an internal standard
to the eluted scolution which is then concentrated by evaporation and analyzed by the
graphite spark technique for Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, Mn, Ni, and Ti.

Applicability. This method is intended for the analysis of high-purity Pu.
The concentration range covered is from 0.5 to 10 ppm. The lower limit of analysis
may be restricted by the reagent blank.

The activity of the solution is due almost entirely to the Am content
of the Pu metal. In general this is sufficiently low to allow a number
of solution to be evaporated to dryness at one time without exceeding
the tolerance limit allowed in a fume cupboard.

Each sample and reagent blank will thus have four exposures.
Transfer the solution to the appropriate residue bottle.

The column life is limited as some TBP is washed off with each run.
The effect of this is that the adsorbed Pu layer becomes longer with
each run and the column must be replaced when the danger of Pu

break-through becomes apparent.

Procedure 17. Separation of Np and Pu by Anion Exchange N. Jackson and J. F.
Short (Ref. 204)

 

QOutline of Method

This procedure is desgcribed for macro amounts of Pu and Np. Tt is based
on the fact that Pu(IIl) is not adsorbed on anion exchange resin, while Np(IV) is
strongly adsorbed at high HC1 concentrations. The valence adjustment is done before
adsorption on the column by dissolving the hydroxides in a concentrated HCI solution
which has been saturated with NH4I. The Np is removed from the column with 2 M
HCl. The separation is quantitative and complete.

Procedure

The purification of 2.3 g of Np237 from approximately50mg of Pu239 was

then undertaken. The Np and Pu were precipitated as hydroxides, cenirifuged, and
dissolved in 210 ml of conc. HCI1 sat. with NH4I. The solution was allowed to stand
for 30 min and poured onto a Deacidite FF anion column 20 ¢m long and

2.5 cm diameter while a flow rate of 1 ml/min was mainta.ined. The first 200 ml of
effluent were pale blue [Pu(IIl)]. The. column was then washed with 100 ml conc.
HCl and the wash collected separately. No activity was found in a drop collected at
the end of the washing.

The Np was finally eluted with 2M HCl. It was possible to follow the dark green
band of the Np down the column and the first 40 ml of eluate was included with the
conc. HC1 wash. The whole of the Np was collected in the next 50 ml of eluate, No
activity was found in any eluate after this stage. Some 8-y activity was detected on

the glass wool at the top of the resin column and was assumed to be Pa233, the

daughter of Np237.

148
Procedure 18. Separation of Np and Pu by Cation Exchange Chromatography V. D.
Zagrai and L. I, Sel'chenkov (Ref. 435).

 

Qutline of Method

Np(IV) and Pu(IlI) are adsorbed on the cation resin KUl or KU2 from 0.25
M HCI1 solution after reduction with SOZ at boiling water temperatures. Np is eluted
with 0.02 N HF and the Pu stripped with 0.5 N HF.

Procedure

1. To 6-8 ml of 0.25 N HCI containing ug amounts of Np and Pu, add
about half of the resin in the hydrogen form required to fill the plexi-
glass column (1 mm diameter X 90 mm high) and 1-2 ml of water.

2. Pass SO2 gas through the solution vigorously for 15-20 min while
heating on a boiling water bath.

3. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature and transfer the resin
to the column with a pipette. Plug the top of the column with cotton
and pass the remaining solution through the column.

Wash the resin with 10 ml of 0.25 N HCI, followed by 10 ml of H,O.

5. Elute the Np into a Pt dishor a Teflon beaker with 40-60 ml of 0.02 N
HF.

6. Elute the Pu with 4-5 ml of 0.5 N HF.

Procedure 19. Determination of Plutonium in Urine R. O. R. Brooks (Ref. 56)

 

QOutline of Method

A 24-hr gsample of urine is dried and ashed and the residue dissolved in
dil. HCl and adjusted to a pH of 1. The Pu is reduced to the trivalent state with
hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and co-precipitated on iron cupferride. This is
extracted with chloroform, the chloroform is distilled off, and the cupferrides residue
is wet oxidized. Thé iron carrying the Pu is finally mounted wi;ch conc. HCI, dried,
precipitated with ammonium hydrOxide, dried again, and flamed off to Fe203. This

233

procedure is based on that described by Smales et al. Differences in the two

procedures are given at the end of this procedure.

Reagents
Ferric chloride solution. 145 mg of FeC13/1iter (i.e. 50 mg Fe/liter).
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution. 50 g of NHZOH-HCI/liter.
Cupferron. 5% aqueous solution, renewed weekly.

 

 

Procedure

1. Evaporate a 24-hr sample of urine overnight in a 2-liter porcelain
basin under infrared lamps.

2. When dry, scrape out and quantitatively transfer the regidue to a
200-ml sgilica dish with washings of 4 N HCI, and re-dry it under
infrared lamps.

3. Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500°C, and hasten oxidation
by periodic additions of 3-ml lots of conc. HNO3 to the dish when it
is cool.

4. Dissolve the white residue in ~30 ml of 4 N HCI, transfer to a 250-ml
beaker and make up with alternate 4 N HCI and water washings to
about 100 ml to a final acidity of 2 N. Stir until only an insoluble
silica residue remains. Add 5 ml of FeCl3 sclution and 10 ml of
NHZOH' HC1 solution followed by a few drops of cresol-red indicator.

5. Adjust the pH of the solutionto 1 (with a pH meter until the operator
can correctly do it visually) with 2 N NH4OH added dropwise from a
burette with constant stirring. It is essential that no phosphate
precipitate forms, as this may reduce recoveries. Allow the solution
to stand for 1 hr to ensure reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(IIl).

6. Transfer the solution to a 500-ml separating funnel and add 2 ml of
5% cupferron solution, Shake the contents thoroughly and let stand
for 3/4 hr to allow complete formation of iron cupferride.

7. Add 30 ml of chloroform and shake the funnel thoroughly. Allow the
chloroform layer to settle and then run it off through a 7-cm Whatman
No. 41 filter paper into a 100~-ml scparating funnel. Wash the
chloroform by shaking with 20 ml of distilled water and run the

No. 41 filter paper as before. Return the water to the original aqueous
golution and add a further 5 ml of FeCla and 2 ml of 5% cupferron as

2 scavenge. After shaking, leave the solution to stand for another

3/4 hr.

Extract the cupferrides with three 15-ml lots of chloroform — or

until the chlorlform remains colorless — and filter each lot separately
into the 100-ml funnel. Wash the filter paper with chloroform from

a pipette to remove the ring of cupferrides which forms around the

top, and collect the washings in the 100-ml separating funnel.

Add 20 ml of distilled water to the chloroform extracts, and shake the
funnel. After they have settled out, filter the extracts into the 250-ml
round-bottomed flask and wash the filter papér with chloroform.
Evaporate off the excess chloroform in a fume cupboard using an
"Electro-Thermal'" mantle. Remove the final drops by blowing in air.

ness again.

Dissolve the residue in 3 ml of conc. HCI and transfer by means of a
pipette to a Pt tray previously counted for background. Use two
further 3-ml aliquots of conc. HCI to obtain a quantitative transfer.

Counting Procedure

Count the tray '"background'" and sample each for one period of 8 hr in an

a-scintillation counter.

Calculating Maximum Permissive Level in Urine

 

Maximum permigsive level in the body is 0.04 uc for Pu239 (solution),

Excretion rate assumed is 0.01% per day.

Corresponding Maximum Permissive Level in Urine is .. 4 puc

 

With a method recovery of 90% and a counter efficiency of (say) 35%, the

maximum permissive level in urine = 2.8 cpm above "background."

151
Reporting Results

Results are reported in puc/24-hr sample in the following ranges:

< 0.1 pyuc
<1l >0.1uuc
> 1 puc (exact figure reported with standard deviation).

NOTE:
Deviations from this report in steps 4, 7, and 8 above were made for reasons

of economy. The use of smaller quantities of reagents were found not to
affect the overall recovery. By using the amounts of HZSO4 and HNO3 quoted

in step 11 above, a more rapid oxidation was achieved.

Procedure 20. Determination of Pu239 in Urine (Small Area Electrodeposition

Procedure) R. W. Perkins (Ref. 316)

QOutline of Method

This procedure describes a method for the rapid separation of Pu239 from
200 ml (or smaller) urine samples, and the subsequent electrodeposition of the Pu239
on an E!—rnm2 area of a stainless steel disk. The yield for a set of five samples was

85.2 percent +3.6 percent standard deviation.

Procedure

1. Place the urine sample (200 ml or less) in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flagk,
add 50 ml of concentrated HNOB, 40 mg of Pr carrier (Note (a)} and
evaporate to about 20 ml. Add 20 ml of HZO and cool under running
water, then transfer the solution to a 100-ml Lusteroid test tube (using
about 20-30 ml of wash water) containing 5 ml concentrated HF and
stir.

2. Allow the sample to stand 30 min, centrifuge 2 min, discard the super-
nate and dissolve the precipitate in 50 ml of 2 N I-1'NO3. Add 5 ml of
concentrated HF and stir. Allow the sample to stand 5 min,
centrifuge 2 min, discard the supernate and digsolve the precipitate
in 5 ml of HZO and 20 ml of 2 MAI(NO3 3—0.5 N HN03.

3. Transfer the solution to 2 120-ml separatory funnel and shake 5 min
(or until clear). Add 0.25 mlof 2 M Na.NO2 and shake 15 min. Add
10 ml of 0.45 M TTA (100 g/liter) in benzene and shake for 20 min.
Discard the agueous phase and wash the organic phase with two 10-ml
portions of 0.5 N HNOs, 5 min each. .

4. Add 10 ml of 8 N HCI and shake 15 min. Collect the aqueous layer in

~a 50-ml beaker. Add 5 ml of 8 N HCI to the organic phase and shake
5 min. Collect the aqueous phase.

3. Combine the aqueous layers, add 5 ml of concentrated HNO3, 3 ml of
concentrated HC104, l1mlof 0.1 M KNO3 and evaporate to dryness.
(Use low heat for final evaporation.)

6. Dissolve the regidue in 7 ml of 0.5 EHNO3 (Note 2). Rub sides of
beaker with policeman to make sure all of the residue is in solution.
Wash policeman with water, adding washings to the sample, then
evaporate the solution to 3-4 ml.

7. Add 4 ml of electrolyte (0.26 M (NH4)2 C204), transferring the solution
to an electrodeposition cell with an 8-mm? stainless steel cathode area
(Note 3).

B. Electrodeposit overnight at 110 mA.

The electrodeposited sample may be counted directly on a low back-
ground o counter, or exposed to a nuclear track film and the o tracks

counted under a microscope* io provide a greater sensitivity.

Notes

The element praseodymium as purchased (from the Lindsey Chemical
Division of the American Potash and Chemical Corporation, West
Chicago, Illinois) could be used directly without causing 2 high back-
ground; whereas, the use of lanthanum' as a carrier resulted in a
high backgrbund.

At this point, the sample can be evaporated on a counting dish for
direct counting if small area deposition is not required.

The eléctroly'tic cells consist of lucite cylinders which are threaded
at one end for stainless steel caps which contact the stainless steel
cathode plating surfaces. A beveled lucite disk fits between the cap

Outline of Method

The Pu is co-precipitated with BiPO4 from acidified urine, the BiPO4
is wet-ashed with HNOB, and the Pu is co-precipitated with LaF3 from an HCl
solution. The LaF3 co-precipitation is repeated and the fluoride is metathesized with
KOH. Puis extracted into di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid from a 2 M HNO3 solution,
and the aqueous phase i8 mounted for counting.

This procedure is included to illusirate the extraction of Pu(IV} into acidic
phosphate extractants. The procedure could presumably be used for a simultaneous
determination of Pu and Am in urine, by back-extraction of the Pu either into strong

acid or a reducing solution.

Sample Pretireatment

 

The volume of a "24-hr equivalent' urine sample (two morning and two
evening voidings) is measured and the sample transferred to a 2-liter beaker. The
volurne and the liquid level are denoted on the beaker with a china-marking pencil
or marking pen. Several glass beads, 1 ml of octyl alcohol and 200 ml of concentrated
nitric acid are added. The beaker is covered with 2 Speede-Vap and placed over an
asbestos pad on a hot plate at high heat. The sample is digested by gentle boiling

until it attains a clear appearance.

BiPO 4 Coprecipitation

 

A stirring bar is added to the cooled solution and rapid stirring initiated
over a magnetic stirring motor. Approximately 130 ml of concentrated ammoniumn
hydroxide are added cautiously, followed by 1 ml of bromthymol blue indicator solution.
Neutralization is completed by addition of concentrated ammonium hydroxide to the
yellow-green endpoint. If necessary, the sample volume is readjusted to its oi'iginal
value with distilled water. Concentrated nitric acid is added to make the solution
0.15 M in HNO, (Table VIII-1). 500 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride are added to
the solution and the beaker placed in a steam bath heated to 80 +5°C. Concentrated
phosphoric acid is then added to a concentration of approximately 0.09 M (Table VI‘I_‘[-l)I.
An amount of bismuth nitrate solution, equivalent to 60 mg bismuth per 100 ml, is
"added dropwise to the heated, stirred solution. . |

The precipitate is digested by an

Wet-ashing of Bismuth Phosphate

 

Several drops of coctyl alcohol are added to the HC1 solution in the 90-ml
tube; it is placed in an aluminum block af approximately 100°C, and the solution taken
to dryness. The dried sample is then repeatedly wet-ashed with several drops of

159
concentrated nitric acid in a block heated to 350°C. After the sample has ashed to
whiteness, itis evaporated twice with 8 N HCI.

Lanthanum Fluoride Coprecipitation

 

The bismuth chloride ash is dissolved in 8 ml of 8 N HCI and the solution
is transferred to a 25-ml conical centrifuge tube. The walls of the 90-ml tube are
rinsed with an additional 2 ml of 4 N HCI and the ringe added to the centrifuge cone.
After addition of 0.1 ml of La(N'O3)3 solution, the tube contents are mixed thoroughly.
Two ml of concentrated hydrofluoric acid (27 M) are then added, and the solution
stirred with a Pt stirrer. The tube is allowed to stand for 5 min and then centrifuged
at 2000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant is carefully aspirated and the precipitate dis-
solved in 2 ml of concentrated HCI.

Following the addition of 2 ml of distilled water, L:-LF3 is reprecipitated by
addition of 2 ml of 27 M HF. The preceding digestion and centrifugation steps are
repeated. Five ml of 8 N potassium hydroxide are added to the precipitate and care-
fully heated to boiling. After cooling the mixture is centrifuged for three minutes and

the supernate carefully drawn off.

D2EHPA Extraction

Following solution of the precipitate in 6 ml of 2 N HNOS, one ml of 2 M
hydroxylamine hydrochloride is added, and the sample is heated in a water bath at
70°C for 5 min. The tube is then removed from the water bath and 2 ml of 2 M sodium
nitrite solution are added with swirling. When bubble evolution ceases, the solution is
transferred to a 30-ml separatory funnel. The centrifuge tube is rinsed once with 3 ml
of 2N nitric acid and the rinse added to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is
then extracted thrice with 5-ml portions of 0.1 M D2EHPA in chloroform for 5-min
periods. The chloroform extracts are removed and the aqueous layer is shaken for 3
min with a 5-ml portion of toluene. The aqueous portion is then withdrawn through
the funnel stem into another 25-ml conical centrifuge tube. Lanthanum fluoride is pre-
cipitated by addition of 2 ml of 27 M HF. The solution is allowed to stand 5 min
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant drawn off and discarded. Shake
the precipitate with 10-15 ml of 1:100 hydrofluoric acid wash solution and centrifuge
at 2000 rpm for 5 min.

Sample Planchetting

 

Aspirate the supernatant and invert the centrifuge cone quickly over ab-
sorbent tissue. Drain 15 min. Slurry the precipitate with distilled water and transfer
to a stainless steel planchet with a disposable capillary pipette. Dry the disk under
an infrared lamp and flame the dried planchet to red heat. The o activity is then counted
with a low-background proportional counter for 150 min.

Procedure 23. Determination of Plutonium in Urine by Anion Exchange E. D.
Campbell and W. D. Moss (Ref. 74)

Outline of Method

Pu is concentrated from urine by co-precipitation with alkaline earth
phosphates. The precipitate is dissolved in 7.5 N nitric acid and the Pu absorbed
from that solution onto Dowex 1 X 2 anion exchange resin. Interfering anions ab-
sorbed on the column are removed with 12 N HC1l. The Pu is eluted from the column
with specially prepared hydrochloric and hydriodic acids, and the o activity determined
by direct planchetting or by electrodeposition of the eluate, followed by standard a-

counting techniques.

Equipm ent

Ion exchange column. The ion exchange column container consists of a
glass reservoir, 2-5/8 in. long by 1-3/32 in, i.d., capacity 40 ml, on a chromato-
graphic column tube 3 in. long by 5/16 in. i.d., constricted at the tip.

Solutions

Hydriodic acid stock solution. Prepared by distilling hydriodic acid
(analytical reagent grade, 5.5 M in hydriodic acid, 1.5% hypophosphorous acid pre-
servative)under nitrogen. The hypophosphorous acid preservative interferes with the
electrodeposition step and also with the preparation of satisfactory planchetted samples.
Oxidation of the prepared hydriodic acid solution is inhibited by adding enough hydrazine
(up to 20% by volume of 64% to 84% hydrazine in water) to decolorize the hydriodic
acid solution.

Hydrochloric acid-hydriodic acid elutriant. Prepared by mixing 1 ml of
hydriodic acid stock solution with 9 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The pre-~
cipitate formed by hydrazine is removed by centrifuging; the supernatant then is
saturated with gaseous hydrogen chloride. The reagent must be prepared every few

days because it decomposes easily.

Reagents

All other reagents used in the procedure are prepared from analytical
grade chemicals.

Preparation of Ion Exchange Column

 

A glass wool pledget in the tube supports the resin. The tube is filled
with from 2-1/2 to 3 in. of a distilled water slurry of Dowex AG1-X2. chloride form,
50 to 80 mesh, anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 32nd and Griffin,
Richmond, Calif.). The resin in the column is converted to the nitrate form by
washing with at least two 5 ml portions of 7.5 N nitric acid before adding the sample

gsolution. The resulting column flow rate is 1 ml/min.

161
Preparation of Sample

 

The 24-hr or equivalent urine sample is transferred to a 2-liter graduated
cylinder with concentrated nitric acid (50 ml of acid per liter). The cylinder is heated
in a steam bath at 75 to 80°C, and stirred with a magnetic stirrer, for 30 min. One
ml of phosphoric acid is added to the sample, then enough concentrated ammonium
hydroxide to form a copious precipitate, and the sample is digested, with continuous
stirring, for 1 hr. After 30 min of digestion the stirrer is stopped, the precipitate is
allowed to settle for several minutes, and the clear supernatant is treated with several
ml of ammonium hydroxide to be sure precipitation is complete. Should more precipitate
form, an excess of ammonium hydroxide is added, and the stirring is continued for
the remaining 30 min. After the cylinder is removed from the wadter bath and the
stirring bar from the cylinder, the sample is allowed to remain undisturbed overnight
at room temperature,. .

The following morning the supernatant is aspirated from the precipitate and dis-
carded. The alkaline earth phosphate precipitate is transferfed to a 90-ml centrifuge
tube with distilled water and centrifuged. The supernatant is discarded, the cylinder
is washed with dilute (20%) nitric acid, and the'v;fashings are combined with the pre-
cipitate in the tube. The material in the tube then is evapprated to dryness in an
aluminum heating block at 85 to 90°C, and the residue finally. is -whitened with con-
centrated nitric acid at approxiinately 300°C,

Ion Exchange. Isolation of the Pu

 

The ashed residue from the alkaline earth phosphate precipitﬁte is dis-
solved in 25 ml of 7.5 N nitric acid. The residue may be t:iissolved with heat if
necessary, but will dissolve easily at room temperature ovérnight (preferred method).
.The acid solution is transferréd to the reservoir of a prépared ion exchange column
and allowed to drain completely. The centrifuge tube is rinséd with three 5-ml portions
of 7.5 N nitric acid,. each rinse being allowed to drain through the column before the
next is added. The column reservoir then is washed down with 5 ml of 7.5 N nitric
acid, which is allowed to drain'through the column completely.. Three ml of concen-
trated hydrochloric acid are added carefully to the top of the resin without disturbing
the resin, keeping dilution from the 7.5 N nitric acid to a minimum, and allowing the
hydrochloric acid to drain completely.” All effluents from the absorptlion and washing
steps are discarded.

One to twe ml of 0.5 N HCI are added to the top of the column, the first several
drops discarded, and the remaining eluate retained in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. The
column then is eluted with two 5 ml portions of 0.5 N HCI and allowed to drain completely
into the ceritrifuge tube.  Finally, several crystals of hydroxylamine hydrochloride are
added to the top of the resin and 2 ml of h'ydribdic—hydrochloric_acid solution drained
through the column and collected. | _ -

NOTE: The hydroxylamine hydrochl'oride is e_ldded to the column to prevent

immediate oxidation of the hydriodic acid. An excess of hydriodic-hydrochloric acid

162
golution should not be used because of possible interference in the electrodeposition
step. The eluate in the tube then is evaporated to approximately 1 ml in an aluminum
heating block at 75°C.

Electrodeposition
The residue from the vaporation is neutralized with 8 N potassium
hydroxide using phenolphthalein as indicator. When the solution is neutral, 2 ml of
sodiurmn hypochlorite and 5 ml of 2 N potassium hydroxide are added to the tube, and
the contents of the tube transferred to an electrodeposition cell with distilled water,
(The final concentration of the alkali is 1 N.) The Pu is electrodeposited on 1/2 in.
polished stainless steel disks at 200 mA for 5 hr. The apparatus and techniques for

K
the electrodeposition of Pu are described by Schwendiman et al.

Determination of Alpha Activity

 

The o activity on the stainless steel plates can be determined either by’
the NTA (Nuclear Track Alpha) emulsion method or by the standard electronic
counting method. The background of the NTA method is 0.007 dpm, with an accuracy
of 1.6 dpm. A method of choice for more rapid evaluation of results is the electronic
determination of the ¢ activity by the phosphor-coated mylar method described by
Hallden and Harley.** The phosphor method uses a 1-in. photomultiplier tube and an
all-transistorized amplifier and counter system designed by P-1 (the Electronics
Group of the Los Alamos Scientific Labhoratory's Physicg Division), similar to that
described by Graveson et al.”>  The background of this system is 0.015 cpm when
adjusted to an optimum efficiency of 45%. The precision of this counting is satis-

factory for 0.1 dpm.

Procedure 24. Determination of Plutonium in Urine by Co-crystallization with
Potassium Rhodizonate W. H. Shipman and H. V. Weiss (Ref. 374)

 

Qutline of Method

Pu is co-crystallized with potassium rhodizonate by adding an equal
volume of ethyl alcohol to a pH 9 solution of the reagent in urine. The Pu is further
purified by co-precipitation with LaF, and adsorption on an anion exchange resin.
The Pu is eluted with 6 N HCL - 0.2 N HF, electrodeposited and a-counted.

ferent volume, reagents are used in proportionate amounts.

Add 1 g of potassium rhodizonate to the sample. (If the urine is not fresh,
solubilization of the reagent may be difficult. Under such circumstances acidification
of the sample with HC1 to pH 2 to 3 effects rapid solution.) Adjust to pH 9 with 5§ N

Procedure 25. Determination of Plutonium in Urine and Bone Ash by Extraction with
Primary Amines F. W. Bruenger, B. J. Stover, and D. R. Atherton (Ref. 61)
Qutline of Method

Concentrated urine, or a solution of bone ash is made 1 M in H2504 and
Pu is extracted by a mixture of highly branched primary alkyl amines. The Pu is then
back-extracted with 8 M HCIl-and counted.

Reagents and Equipment

 

The o-detection instrument is a 27 proportional counter of conventional
design capable of accepting 2-in. stainless steel planchettes; counter performance is
checked with a U3OB standard supplied by the National Bureau of Standards.

Primene JM-T, a mixture of tert-alkyl primary amines, 5% by volume in xylene,
was purchased from Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, Pa. The Primene solution is

washed with half its volume of 1 M HZSO4 before use.

Procedure

Urine analysis. Urine is collected in polyethylene bottles over 10 ml of
concentrated formic acid to avoid excessive hydrolysgis of urea, which would render
the specimen basic and could result in loss of Pu by adsorption on the wall of the con-
tainer. An aliquot of urine is transferred to a Kjeldahl flagk containing enough 5 M
sto4 to attain an acid concentration of 2 M in the final sample. The solution is
boiled without charring for about 1 hr. Thus far, volumes up to 500 ml have been
extracted. For larger volumes, amounts of reagents are increased proportionally.
The following amounts of reagents are used for 100-ml aliquots. The sample is
filtered through borosilicate glass wool into a separatory funnel and is allowed to
cool to room temperature, Twenty ml of a 5% solution of Primene JM-T in xylene is
added to the sample and the mixture is8 shaken for 15 min. After separation of the two
phases, the aqueous phase is put aside for a second extraction. The organic phase is
waghed twice with 25 ml of 1 M H2804. Pu is removed from the organic phase with
two 20-ml portions of 8 M HCl. The aqueous phase is again extracted with 20 ml of
5% Primene, and Pu is back-extracted from the Primene with 20 ml of 8 M HCL. The
combined HCI fractions are dried under a heat lamp and then the organic contaminants
are destroyed by heating over an open flame or in a furnace at 500°C. The Pu residue
is dissolved in concentrated HNO, and transferred to a 2-in. -diameter stainless steel

3
planchette for ¢ counting.

Bone analysis. Bone is ashed for 4 hr at 600°C and, after cooling, is
dissolved in as little HNO3 as pogsible and diluted with H20 to a known volume, and a
suitable aliquot of this solution is taken for analysis. The amount of bone ash should
not exceed 250 mg for every 75-ml volume of the aqueous phase. The aliquots are
evaporated to dryness under a heat lamp to minimize the amount of HNO3 and then put
in solution with 4 ml of concentrated HCOOH, and a 60-ml portion of 2.5 M H,80, is
added. This solution is heated in a water bath until it. is clear, and then transferred
to a separatory funnel. Transfer is completed with a 10-ml rinse of distilled water.
Any (33504 that forms does not interfere. Pu is extracted as described above.
