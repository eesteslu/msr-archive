Summary

A fast breeder reactior of 2000 MW(t) oulput using molten chlorides
as fuel and coolant is discussed. Some of the most significant
characteristics are

- the fuel contains only Pu013fN301,

- the coolant is U013/N301 and also forms the fertile material
along with the blanket, again UCl3/N301

- the fuel circulates through the core by forced convection.

The thermal stability of the reactor is vary good. Power excursions
cf Tuel temperature transients are quickly damped by the phenomensa
of fuel expansion pushing part of the fissile material out of the
critjcal zone,

The balance of fission products including free chlorine seems to
be stabiliz=d when some of the semi-noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd and
some Mo) are present in ithe elementary form,

Corrcsion effects form the most difficult problem, Thermodynamic

atud_e2s8 suggest the use of molybdenum alloys as structural mate-
rials, Separation of the fuel éﬁﬂ;&@&%& from the fertile compo-

nent UCl3 helps to overcome some of the corrosion »roblems,

A reprocessing system btased on a salt-metal-transport process seems
to be atiractive from the point of view of the economics of thne
plant as a whole.

The possiblity of using a dissociating gas as a secondary working
agent in the turbine for example A12016 and N2q4is discussed.
Résumé

SURREGENERATE'R RAPIDE A SELS FONDUS (Chlorurss)

Problemes et possibilités

Un surrégénérateur r-pide de 2000 MW(t) utilisant des chlorures
fondus comme combustible et comme réfrigérant est décrit. Quel-
ques-unes de ses caractéristiques les plus intéressantes sont

les suivantes:

- le combustible liquide, contient seulement un mélange PuClB/NaCI

- le réfrigérant est un mélange UCl3/N301; i1 comporte donc le

matériau fertile tout comme les couvertures de méme composition

- le combustible demeure dans le coeur mais doit é&étre entrainé

suivant une boucle de convection forcée,

La stabilité thermique du réacteur est trés bonne; les excursions
de puissance et les transitoires concernant la température du
combustible sont fortement limitée par *'expansion du combustible
qui se trouve déplacé vers les régions périphériques qui con-
tribuent beaucoup moins & la réactivité.

L'équilibre des produits de fission incluant des atomes de chlore
semble &tre réalisé quand certains métaux semi-noble (Ru, Rh, Pd
et Mo) sont présents,

Les effets de corrosion constituent le probldme le plus difficile.
Des études de thermodynamique suggdrent l'utilisation d'alliages
de molybdéne comme matériau de structure.

Un systéme de régénération basé sur un procédé de "transport sel-
métal” parait intéressant du point de vue économique.

Enfin la possibilité d'utiliser les propriétés de dimérisation
de certains gaz, par exemple Alzcl6 et N204, dans le cycle thermc-
1, General Problems

The biggest attraction of breeder reactors is their ability to
utilize directly or indirectly, the non-fissile nuclides U-238 -
in fast breeder reactors, and Th-232 - in thermal reactors.

The relative advantages of the fast breeder over the thermal bree-
der are: higher breeding ratio, higher specific power which re-
sults in the shortening of the doubling time as well as in the

more intensive use of the reactor volume.

In addition it must be emphasized, that each breeder reactor, which
is built to last 25-30 years, must be considered not only as a
power producing device but also as a source of fissile material.
Therefore each breeder reactor should be considered as part of a
long term complex ' breeding system ' which includes both the
power reactor and the fuel reprocessing plant over this period.

From this point of view the reactors with molten fuel are better
adapted to the long term ' breeding system ' than are the solid
fuel reactors. (simpler reprocessing technology, minimal transpor-

tation problems, smaller environmental danger, better economics(?)).
(Fig. 1)

Such a coupled ’breeder system’ has additional advantages when the
reprocessing technology is based on high temperature processes,
such as pyrometallurgical or pyrochemical techniques instead of
low temperature processes in aqueous solutions. These high tempe-
rature reactorkeproceseing systems might be realised in the most
favorable manner when the fuel in the breeders is in a molten
liquid and not in a solid state.

Thus in the future, 'breeding systems’'using molten fuel fast
reactors seem to be of interest.
The molten fuel fast reactors can lLbe classified in the following

manner

1) Molten metallic fuel

2) Molten salt fuel

Past reactors with molten metallic plutonium fuels were constructed
in the sixties in Los Alamos under the name LAMPRE. The molten
alloy Pu-Co-Ce was the most promising fuel proposed. The results
were encouraging but further experimehts have not been realised.
These reactor types were not breeders.

Fast reactors with molten salt fuel exist only as paper studies at
the present time. Som: work has been done at QOak Ridge (1956),
Warsav (1960-68) Argonne (1965-68) and Harwell (1963-70), In addi-

tion some experimental work has also been carried out,

When nuclear, physical and chemical considerations are studied it
can be shown that the only possible fuel conatituent of these fasi
reactors are the molten chlorides. In the case of thermal reactors
the most suitable molten salt fuel proves to be a fluoride.
(Fluorides are moderators, and therefore could not be used in a
fast reactor, because of the dramatic softening of the neutron
spectrum).

The search for the best components of molten salt fuel for fast
reactors must take into account not only thermal and hydraulic
properties but also the following nuclear properties: elastic and
inelastic cross sections, cross sections for neutron absorbing
mechanisms, not only (n,y) but also (r,p), (n,x) and (n,2n). The
chlorides of uranium~238 and plutonium-239 diluted by sodium chlo-
ride are the selected components of the fused salt fuel. (Taube 1961)
Molten fuel reactors differ from the peint of view of thne cooling
system. ‘The following are three types of molten fuel reactors:

a) Externally cooled, where the molten fuel is pumped out of the
core to the external heat exchanger. In this type of reactor,
cnly fucl and fertile material are present in the core {no
coclant)., The large ruount of molten fuel ouvtside the core
does not of course contribute to the critical mass,

This type of reactor has been discussed for example by Nelison,
(Argonne 1967) and Lane (USA 1970) especially as a high flux
material testing fast reactor.

In externally cooled fast reactors the loss of a portion of the
delayed neutrons could adversly affect reactor control. Also
the biological shielding outside the core is very expensive.

b) Internally, direct cooled reactors: here the cooling agent is
pumped directly into the core where, after mixing the fuel in

the lower part of the core is separated and pumped out of the
core to the heat exchanger. The direct contact of molten fuel
with molten coolant has several particular advantages.,

Very good heat transfer, no coolant tubes {(or cladding), possi-
bility of transporting fission products.

The disadvantages are unfortunately, also numerous: problems of
mixing and separating the fuel and coolant, corrosion etc. This
type of reactor has also been studied eg. - cooled by molten
lead (Long, Harwell and Killingback, Winfrith), cooled by boiling
mercury (Taube, Warsaw) and cooled by boiling aluminium chloride
(Taube, Warsaw). This type of reactor must be considered ag sn
'extreme exotic type'.

¢) Internallv jndirectly cooled reactor: here the cooling agent
flows through tubes in the core. Heat is transferred from fuel

to c¢oolant across the tubes. No direct contact between molten
fuel and 1iquid or gaseous coolant is permitted. These types
have also been studied, in mos. cases using sodium as a coolant,
(Nelson, Argonne 1967).

In this paper an internally 3‘;{;;%5'@51, cooled molten salt fast
reactor is discussed. The unusual difference is in the use of
a molten chloride coolant, including uranium chloride in place
of sodium or gaseous coolant. The uraniunm chloride component
is in fact the fertile constituent which doubles as coolant.

Fig. 1 shows the flow diagrams o two types of reactors: with
solid fuel and separate reprocessing plant and the molten fuel
reactor with integral reprocessing system.

2, General description of the reactor

In this paper a molten chlorides fast breeder reactor is discussed.
The most important features of this reactor are: (Fig. 2 and Pig. 3)

- thermal power 2050 MW(th) - 1936 MW(t) in core + 114 MW(t) in
blanket giving
- electrical power 1000 MW(e) (in the inost optimistic case)
- molten fuel consisting of (in mol%)
15% PuCl; (of which Pu-239 + Pu-241 = 80% and Pu-240 = 20%)
8% NaCl

(no 238UCl in fuel)

3

and fission products in the form of chlorides or in elementary
state,
molten fertile material (in mol %)
65% “>uca,

365% NaCl

and newly bred PuCl3 and fission products.

coolant flowing in tubes: the same as fertile material

(no other coolant in core)
blanket material: the same as fertile material

the core is internally cooled, there is no circulating fuel

outside the core.

the fuel and the coolant are flowing in the same direction

(see fig. 3)

the reprocessing plant is in intimate proximity witn the

reactor (under the same roof)

for the sake of obtaining relatively high plant thermal effi-
ciency a rather exotic working agent is proposed: aluminium
trichloride. This agent removes the heat from the primary
coolant molen U013/N301) in an external heat exchanger,

for full use of the thermal energy a secondary working agent
is also proposed: nitrogen dioxide. The theoretical thermal
efficiency of such a power station may be significantly higher
than those of a 'classical' power stavion. Of course a more
conservative steam turbine system need not be excluded, but it
is possible 1o argue that one attraction of such system would

be to use for 'district' heating,

the fuel in the core and the coolant are pumped with the velo-
city of 2 and 9 m3™L respectively.

- the possible structural material: molybdenum alloy with small
amounts of other metals e.g. Ni, Fe +.uss

The advantages of the proposed reactor are the following:

- no separate coolant no 'foreign' cooling agent {(e.g. sodium,
helium ete.) in the core which results in a more satisfactory
sysliem with improved neutron balance.

~ the fuel inventory is very small due to lack of a separate
cooling system and because of the small ~ut-of-core inventory
on the basis of the direct coupled continous reprocessing plant.

- the fuel contains only plutonium and no uranium which simpli-
fies the processing technology and removes the danger of uranium
trichloride oxidation which also improves the corrosion proper—
ties of this medium.

-~ the corrosion problems are casier to solve when the aggressive
turbine working agent, aluminium chloride is situated outside
the core.

- the high velocities of both fuel and coolant significantly
reduces the temperature gradients at the equilibrium state and
reduces the mass transport mechanism, The mass transport mechanism
is very sensitive to temperature gradients and plays a large
part in corrosion mechanisms,

However the disadvantages are numerous:

-~ the first and most important disadvantage is of course corro-
sion. The molten cnloride medium, especially in neutron and
gamma fields, at high temperatures and velocities with chlorine
12

being virtually free in the fission process of plutonium
chloride presents a very serious problem which must, and pro-
bably could be solved,

- the most likely structural material seems to be molybdenum
alloy which among other things gives rise tc¢ parasytic absorp-
tion of neutrons,

- the fuel is circulated by a pump which must be located in or

close to the core which increases the corrosion problems.

- the high fuel and coolant velocities result in high pumping

costs and couwld cause severe erosion.

Reactor Physics

The neutronics calculations have been made in 3 steps:
- rough calculation with one group cross secticns taken from

sodium cooled oxide fuel fast reactor data.

- calculation with 15 group cross sections for given chloride
conposition.

- recalculation with newly calculated one group cross sections,
normalized from spectrum obtained in the previous 15 group
calculation, (see fig. 4)

The one group cross sections used in these calculations are
given in table 2,
The neutron balance is given in table 3,

There are references in the literature to the adverse effect of
neutron absorption by the chlorine isotopes.

For fast neutrons the two isotopes of chlorine have the following

cross—sections.

From the data obtained the adverse influence of chlorine-35 is
rather small and an isotopically enriched chlorine is not required.

To a similar extent the problem of the exact choice of construc-
tional mnatexrials for the coolant tubes will also affect the
neutronics calculations.

At least two criteria must be considered in the selection of tube
material:

- the absorption cross-section for fast neutrons (agD.l MeV)
because of its effect on the breeding ratio. (fig. 5)

- chemical stability against the attack of chlorine ions which

can be partly represented by the free enthalpy of chloride for-
1000 QK)

mation (Gform

Fig. 5 shows both properties of some selected materials. From this
it appears that one of the most suitable metals is molybdenum. Un-
fortunately this answer cannot be regarded as completely satisfac-
tory because of the lack of real experirmental data and because of
some thermodynamic questions which are discussed in sections 8 and

9.

4. Thermohydraulics

The calculations for this type of reactor have been based on the
following more or less arbitrary selected parameters:

- fuel in shell side, with tube pitch to diameter ratio equal
to 1.10 to 1.18,

- fuel velocity: 0.5 to 5 m.s'l

- core dia: 2 and 2.2 n

- core height: 2 m

- coolant in tube with tube internal diameter equal to: 1.0 to
1.5 cm

-~ velocity of coolant: 1 to 17 me T

- coolant inlet temperature ?500 and 800°C

The calculation of neutronics and thermo-hydraulics were made for

1 cm of the core height (see fig. 6 - flowsheet of program)

The data given in table 1 obtained from these caiculations are

for a steady state reactor.

The detailed representation for the temperature distribution in a
typical power reactor with a core output of 1936 MW(t) are given
in fig. 7 (for a position 43 cm above the bottom of the core where

the neutron flux is normalised to 1).

The bulk temperature of the fuel is here 99800, the temperature
of the tube walls 857 - 839°C and the bulk temperature of the
coolant 781°C.

For the total output of the core 1936 MW(t), the power distri-
bution is as shown in fig. 8.

Of course a flatter power distribution could be obtained by
ad justing tube diameters and pitch across the core.

(Note that in this calculation the radial neutron flux distribu-
tion has been taken as unperturbed).

A very encouraging indication of the good temperature distribution
with very small temperature gradients is skown in fig, 9 which
indicates the axial bulk temperature distribution in the fuel and

in the coolant in the core,

TEMPERATURE of FUEL and COOLANT

The fuel bulk temperature changes form 980°C at the bottom to 96500
at 1/4 core height and is 998°C at 3/4 of core height.

The coolant temperature lies betweaen 750°C inlet and 79300 outlet.
Both these small temperature gradients in the fuel and in the coo-
lant (fertile and blanket material) may prove beneficial in redu~-
cing corrosion processes due to the minimizing of mass transport

phenomena,

The stable behaviour of this type of reactor results from many
parameters. Two of them are the velocity of the coolant and its
bulk temperature. The mean power output of the core is strongly
dependant on the velocities of both fuel and coolant. (fig. 10)

For a fuel velocity of 2 m.s-l, when the coolant velocity falls
from 12 m.s-l to 1 m.s'l the coolant outlet temperature increases
from 784°C to 893°C for constant inlet temperature of 750°C. This
change of coolant velocity and its bulk temperature results in the
decrease of the mean core output from 2088 MW(t) to 598 MW(t) -

that is approcimatly a factor 3! It is clear since the lower coolant
velocity results in a higher coolant outlet temperature and lower
power outi.. .2 have definite negative temperature coefficient

(power output) varying with the given coolant velocity.

1

If the fuel velocity falls from 2 m.s - to 0.8 m.s-l we again get an

important decre se of power output (see fig. 11)

The decrease in both fuel and coolant velocity results in a sharp
decrease of reactor power (see fig. 12). This means that such a
reactor can be considered as a surprisingly stable and self regula-
ting device, In the case of a sudden fall in coolant and/or fuel
velocities the power output decreases to a safe level without inter-

vention.

The reference core with 1936 MW(t) coolant velocity 9 m.s-l, fuel
velocity 2 m.s'l, tube pitch/dia ratio 1.1%, has a plutonium in-
ventory of 2252 kg of Pu (Pu-239 + Pu-240) which gives a specific
power of 0,86 MW(t)/kg Pu.

The breeding ratio in the core for the reference case is calcula-

ted as

The blanket breeding ratio for a 1 m blanket is calculated as
approx 0.680 which gives a total breeding ratio 1.389.

The doubling time for this reactor is given the following defi-
nition (at 80 % load factor)

Doubling time =
Pu gain

2252 kg Pu

1936 MW(t) x 1.1 kg Pu/1000 Mwg ¥ 300 days/year x (1.389-1)

It must be stressed that this doubling time is a linear one.

5, Quasi-kinetic and pumping problems

The achievment of the required fuel velocity in the core seems
to require a forced circulation system since the rough estimate
using notural convection gives a heat transfer coefficient which

is too low.

Such a forced circulation system (core only) can be one of the

following types

- pump installed directly in core
- pump outside the core
- an external pump with injector

- a gas-1ift pump using inertgas (argon)

Intensive consideration of the factors involved, using criteria
such as ~ reduction of the out of core inventory, elimination of
additional heat exchangers, minimization of the fuel leakage, mini-
mization of the auxilliary opwer, optimisation of the fuel flow
regulation, points to an in-core pump solution, Of course this
gives rise to considerable technical problems (cooling of the
rotor, corrosion and erosion, maintenance, neutron activation ete.)

ible
The postulated fuel velocity makes it gsﬁaible to mal.e some calcu-
lation on the heat transfer problems and also gives a feel for the

kinetics of the reactor under discussion.

It must be stressed that these kinetics studies have no strong
physical sense and use an iﬂ%ﬁ%gEZhe approach but it is clear that
they give some useful information about the general reactor stabi-
lity. (see fig. 13 and fig. 14)

There is little information on the density of PuClB/N301 and
U013/Na01 in the temperature range of interest. For these caleunla-

6, Fission Products

The fission process of plutonium in a molten chloride medium may

be expressed as

PuCl:_.’ (n,f) ~— Fiss, products + 3 Cl

From the earlier published data of Taube 1965 and Chasanov 1965
and the more recent data of Lang 1970 it appears that the problem
of the pessible existence of fission product oxides states was not
sufficiently discussed.

On t'.e basis of the fission yields of Pu-239 in a fast reactor after
10 days irradiation and without cooling time the yield of the indi-
vidual elements are as shown in table 4

The most difficult problem is to predict the probable valency
(oxidation state) of some metallic elements and metalloids., In this
paper the oxidation states have been determined on the basis of the
free enthalpy of formation of the chlorides (according to Veryatin
et al. 1965) and are shown below,

The total amount of these metals equals approximately 50 atoms per
100 fissioned atoms of Pu-239 (see also fig. 17).

(Note that all these considerations have been made for standard
free enthalpy; but even a change in the thermodynamic activity
from Yy =1 to vy = 0,001 which means a change in free enthalpy of
14 kJ-mol-l, thus appears insignificant in these rough considera-

tions).

7. Rep ‘cessing

Breeder reactors as we already know form part of a 'breeder system'
which includes not only the power reactor but also the reprocessing
plant.

The advantages of molten salt breeder reactors become particularly
apparent when the reprocessing plant is under the same roof as the
power reactor and when chemical separation processes take place
in the high temperature molten salt media in a continuous cycle.

The separation of plutonium and/or uranium from the irradiated fuel
by means of pyrochemical techniques could be carried out, for
example, in the following way

Molten salt, primary phase Pu, FP (part of FP remains)
Transport of Pu and part of FP,

Metallic phase (part of FP remains)
Transport of Pu

Molten salt, secondary phase containing only FPu.

This is the so called 'metal transport’ process (fig. 18)

8. Aluminium trichloride as_ turbine working ageut

One of the most important features of the proposed reactor is the
relatively high total thermal efficiency of the power staiion,

Such a high thermal efficiency is poscible only under two condi-
tions:
- working agent at a higher temperature

- certain required thermodvnamic properties of the working agent

must be met.

Among several possibilities~ aluminium trichkloride, a rather exotic

working agent is proposed here.

Molybdenum forms four compounds with chlorine: MoClz, H0013,
MoCl4, M0015 (fig. 22). The stability of these chlorines is
strongly influenced by the concentration of free chlorine and also
by the temperature,

A more detailed calculation of metallic molybdenum corrosion in
the aluminium trichloride is needed, see fig. A7. These calcula-
tions are very sensitive to the vapour pressure of chlorides

(fig. 23). In connection with corrosion problems mention must also

be made of the problem of the reaction between metal chlorides
and oxygen and water,

These reactions (for oxidation state + 2) could be written in

simplified form:

MeCl

5 + H20 - MeO + 2HC1

H9012 + 02 - MeO + C1

2

The metal oxides are mostly insoluble in molten chlorides, which
results in a serious disturbance of the fuel system. From this
point of view the metallic elements could be divided into three
classes: (see fig. 24)

- those which are stable against H20 and 02, that is the chlorides
are more stable than the oxides (eg. Na, Cs, Ba) and partially
Ca.

- those which are not stable against H20 and 02 and the resulting
product is a mixture of chloride, oxychloride and oxide (eg. Pu,
U but also Zr, Ti, Al, PFe, Cr, Mn, Mg - this is the most numerous
group of metals).

- those in which chlorides are converted to the most stable oxide
in the presence of H,0 or O, (eg. Mo, W),
Metals of this class seem to be not so numerous as in the other

two classes.

This property causes the rapid elimination of traces of water or
oxygen in the molten salts of Pu and U chlorides. It is also well
known that traces of H20 and 02 have a very big influence on corro-

ajion rate,

The same property may be advantageous in establishing a thin coa-
ting of oxide on molybdenum surfaces., This suggestion must be
proved thermodynamically and experimentally.

It must be stressed that the problem of removal of oxygen and
water and other oxygen containing substances from the salts may

be crucial for the corrosion problem as well as for long term fuel
stability.

10, Safety Problems

The molten chlorides reactor seems to be a relatively safe system
because of the following reasons

- an extremely high negative temperature coefficient of reactivity,
because during a temperature rise part of the liquid fuel is
pushed out of the core into a non-critical geometry burfer tank.
The dumping of fuel in case of an incident is also possible in
an extremely short time. (fig. 25) Pig. 25 is on the page 38,

- in a more serious incident when the fuel temperature increases
to 1500-1700°C (depending on external pressure) the fuel begins
to boil. The vapour bubbles give rise to a new and unique, very
high negative 'fuel void effect'

- the leak of fuel to the conlant is probably not a serious problem

because the coolant is continuously reprocessed.

- the leak of coolant to the fuel for the same reason cannot cause

large problems (provided the leak remains small).

A rather adverse property of such a molten fuel reactor is the
necessity of initially heating the solidified fuel in a2 non criti-
cal geometry with external power. (eg. from the electrical grid).
54

11, BEconomics

It is not possible, when considering the econimics of this type of
reactor, at such an early stage to make realistic statements of

. costs and predictions of economic performance for a station in

full operation. Here we merely indicate the main areas in which
this type of reactor can be expected to have an economic advantage
including some comments on the possible attractions offered by a
molten fuel reactor in utilizing the abundant but low grade sources
of uranium which may become available when economic or national

requirements dictate the need.

The most important advantage ¢f the molten chloride breeder power
system (power reactor including reprocessing plant) is of course
due the part it could play in reducing the costs of power produc-
tion. The possible eccnomic advantages are caused by the following

features

-~ in relation to the 'classical’ solid fuel fast breeder reactor,
the molten chlorides fast breeder reactor system removes the
need for the following operations: cooling of the irradiated
fuel, transport, decladding, liquefaction, manufacture of solid
fuel, cladding, fuel pin assembly, transport ete.

- the amoun’t of fuel outside the core is, in the molten chloride
reactor only a few percent of the fuel core inventory. In the
solid fuel reactor the out ¢7 core amount equals the fuel core
inventory. The capital zosts for the out of core fuel are of
significance,

—~ the doubling time for these reactors _s shorter than those for
sodium cooled solid fuel reactors and, being equal to 7 years,
gives a good doubling time.

- the mean burn up in the molten fuel, continuously reprocessed
could be a factor 3-5 lower than that for the solid fuel system.
55

- in a 'closed' system of power station and reprocessing plant the
safeguards are much simpler and easier to apply.

In addition the molten chlorides reactor has further advantages:

- a higher mass specific power (MW(t)/kgPu) than the solid fuel
reactor which decreases the fuel inventory capital costs.

~ a high power density (M‘a’(t)/m3 of core) than the solid fuel
reactor, which may decrease the capital costs of core, blanket
and shielding, perhaps in the future an increasingly important
part of power production costs,

- more attractive, from the point of view of future conditions
when the costs of uranium recovery will probably increase and
when independance from a foreign market may become an important
factor.,

This last point is here developed further as of being of particular
relevance to the Swiss economy and national interests but which
may become more and more relevant to the world uranium market in
the future.

As with the classical fast breeder reactor, the molten chlorides
reactor can be used for 'burning the rocks' (according to

A.M, Weinberg), that is for utilization of the dispersed uranium
present in granites in amounts of the order of 10 ppm (the mean
value of uranium concentration in the entire earths crust is 4 ppm).

The continuous reprocessing of irradiated fuel and the relatively
simple preparation of fresh fuel and fresh fertile material as
suggested for the molten chlorides reactor seems to be ideally
suited for 'rocks burning'.
56

Let as make some simple calcuiations:

1 m3

content of 10 ppm we have 25 g of uranium per 1 m

of granite equals 2500 kg of minerals, and with a uranium

3 ¢f granite.

As is known in the Swiss Alps in Piz-Giuv {Aar-Massif) -ne uranium
content in the syenite equals 15 - 30 ppm {Prof. Higi 1971) so in
this case Tor 30 ppm.

1 m3 of syenite weighs: 2.5 x 103 kg

b 6

2.5 x 10° kg x 30 x 1070 = 75 x 10°° kg = 75 g Uranium.

In breeding

75 g U-239 -» 70 g Pu-239

for power production

70 g Pu x 1 MWa x 10° kw x 24 x 3.6 x 10° s = 6 x 107 KJ

in other words

5 6 TJ or 6 x 1012

Joules,

1l m” of syenite is equivalent to 6 x 109 KJ

It is interesting to compare this energy source with oil:

1 m3

and heat of combustion ~ 12000 kCal/kg gives:

of petroleum product, with a specific weight og 900 kg/m3

> 10

000 kg x 12 x 10° x 4.18 = 4,5 x 10° ¥J = 4.5 x 10

Joules

that is 6/0.045 = 130 times less than the energy content of 1 m
of granite (syenite),

5
57

3

In terms of volumes, 1 m” of petroleum product is equivalent to
7 dm} of granite (syenite) (or a cube 19 cm x 19 xm x 19 c¢m) and in
addition 1 m3 of 0il requires approx. 3000 kg of oxygen or 10'000 m3

air for combust*ion,

In the future output of the Swiss nuclear power industry will reach
10'000 MW(e).

Por this amount of electrical energy approx. 10'000 kg Pu must be
burnt annually. In a steady state nuclear povwer industry this
amount of plutonium could be obtained from 20'000 kg of natural
uranium (allowing for losses etc.). So for the Swiss nuclear indu-
stry it would be sufficient to recover the uranium from approxi-
mately 1 million cubic meters of granite annually - in other words
the volume of a tunnel 30 m x 10 m x 3000 m or an open mine

200 x 200 x 20 m,

The cost of this rocks burning may be estimated =s folloxa

The present price of natural uranium is 20 $/kg U for the case

where vranium is recovered from 0.1 % uranium ores,

In the future, when uranium is recovered from granites with
only 0,001 % {10 ppm) uranium the price of uranium may increase
to 500 g/kg that is 25 times.

Let use assume that the price of plutonium (currently and in the
future) equals 8000 #/kg.

At the present time the proportion of uranivm raw material costs

appearing in this plutonium price is only

20x2_ o,5% (2 kgU for 1 kg Pu)
58

In the future for the very expensive uranium from granites this
part will equal

Mz 12.5 %
800

Or in other words an increase in the ccst of recovery of natural
uranium by a factor of 2% will only raise the plutonium price from
80008/kg to 90003/kg.

The present cost of electrical energy with an optimistic figure
of 4 mills/kWh{e) gives 1,1 mills for Pu per kWh(e) which at the
higher price would give erergy (electrical} costs of 4,27 mills/

kWh(e) that is only 6,7 % more expensive than the current price,

Thus to summarize:

- The molten chlorides reactor is an attractive candidate for

utilization of low grade ores such as from granite.

- Even with the greatly increased cost of recovery of uranium

from granite, tlc influence on electrical energy costs is small.

- From a resource point of view, the energy content (per m3) of
granite is greatly superior to say fuel oil (130 times).

- The use of the abundant supplies of granit. is abviously an
attractive possibility from the point of view of the economy and
interests of countries such as Switzerland.

by following criteria:

- thermodynamic and kinetic stability of plutonium and uranium com—

pounds

- melting point not higher than 70000, in pure state or in dissol-
ved state (fig. Al, A2)

- boiling point not lower than 1500-160000 both for pure and dis-
solved states (low vapour pressure) (fig. A3)

- high solubity, at least 15 mol % of plutonium and 70 mol %
uranium compounds

- small neutron capture cross-section for fast neutrons

- small elastic scattering for fast neutrons
- small inelastic scattering

- good heat-transport properties; specific heat capacity, (low
viscosity, high conductivity etc.) (fig. A4)

- good corrosion properties (if possible) (fig. A5)
- sufficient technological or laboratory eéxperience

- relatively low price,

All these manifold criteria are sufficient wel) fuilfilled by
following compunds:

PuCl3, U013, NaCl and as coolert AlCl3.

Authors' Note

During the time in which this report was prepared and printed.
one of us (J.L.) has made more sophisticated neutronics calcula-
tions which result in the following

- for the ratio Pertile/Fissile material given in this paper
the critical buckling was overestimated.

- An improved figure for the core results when the ratio Fer-
tile/Fissile material is reduced from 6.60 to 5.65. This is
possible by a slight change in the tube/cell ratio and in-
crease in the coolant velocity.

CT0S5S
Recent data shows that the total euws section for chlorine used
here was overestimated by a factor 2,

The results of the revised neutronics calculations will be given
in a further paper.
