Preface

This monograph presents some procedures used in the
radiochemical isolation, purification and/or analysis of vranium,
neptunium, and plutonium. The original monographs were:

' The Radiochemistry of Uranium, J. E. Gindler, NAS-PS-3050
{1%862), 350 pp.., 18 procedures.

The Radiochemistry of Neptunium, G. A. Burney and |
R. M. Barbour, NAS-NS-3060 (1974}, 229 pp.., 25 prpcedures.

The Radiochemistry of Flutonium, G. B. Coleman, NAS-NS-3058 .
(1965), 184 pp., 25 procedures. |

in addition to the description cf the procedures, these
earlier monographs list the isotopes and their nuclear properties
for each element. They also discuss the chemistry of the
separation processes of these elements with primary emphasis an
precipitation, ion exchange and solvent extraction technigues. 1In
this update of the procedures, we have nct attempted to discuss
the developmentes in the chemistry of U, Np and Pu but have
restricted the monograph tc the newer procedures, most of which
have resulted from the increased emphasis in environmental concern
vhich requires analysis of extremely small amounts of the actinide
element in quite complex matrices. The final section of this
monograph describes several schemes for isolation of actinides by
oxidation state.

" The individual procedures fram the earlier monographs are
ligted by title to provide a more complete view of available
separation techniques. The new procedures in this monograph are
included for each element following the list from the earlier
publications. L

IV. New liranium Pracedures

INTRODUCTION

Since the publlcatlon of the orzgxnal monograph on the radio-
chemistry of uranium in 1962, much attention has been given to methods
of separation, isolation, and measurement of small amounts of
uranium in various types of samples. Such samples involve geological,
biological, and environmental matrices, frequently of high complexity
and lcw uranium content. The procedures for such samples collected
in this monograph are meant not to supplant, but rather to supple-
ment those in the original mcnograph by allowing applicability of
the procedures to & wider variety of sample types.

These new procedures were chosen to provide description of
a wide variety of techniques rather -than to fccus on any particular
method, such as neutron activation anaiysis or solvent extraction.
Some of the procedures emphasize the separatzon of uranium from
other elements, while for others, the main focus is the method of
measurement.

A complete procedure generally can be divided into three
operations: 1) ‘sample preparation, 2) separation of the element(s)
of interest, and 3) analytical measurement. In many cases a
specific operation from one procedure can be used in conjunction
with other operations from anothe~ procedure. This should
allow a broad spectrum of sample types. For each of the collected
procedures, sample types to which the procedure may be applied
are given. A more complete discussion of each procedure and
additional informaticn regarding applications can be obtained
from the original reference. In some cases, additional references -
are listed, as they ~ontain similar, related procedures and might
be of interest in the case of some particular sa=mple.

DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES -

The first twc procedures involve precipitation of uranium
from large quantities of water. In the first procedure, NaOH
is used to precipitate uranium from seawater. The efficiency
of recovery of uranium and other heavy radionuclides from 750
grams of seawater by this procedure is shown in Figure 1.
The dspendency of the recovéry efficiency on the volume of NaOH
added is evident, with maximum recovery occurring after addition
to tha 750 gram sample of at least 8 ml of 1.0 M NaOH, which |
corresponds to a final NeOH concentration of approximately 0.01 M.
For different volumes of samples, the amount of base to be added
should be modified so as to obtain a comparable NaOH concentration.
Figure 2 is an alpha spectrum of a uranium sample obtained from

the use of thigs method.

The second procedure involves the coprecipitation of
uranium with iron potessium ferrocyanophosphonates. - This procedure
can be used with larger volumes (several liters) of water and gives
-a slightly better recovery in scme cases. ' '

Procedures 3 ang 4 involve sclvent extraction to preconcen-
trate and isolate the uranium. Procedure 3 uses tri-n-octylamine
(TOA) as extractant; details on the chemistry of this extractant is
described in the original uranium monograph (NAS-NS-3050). This
procedure employs spectrophotometric analysis-.of the urenium by
<he use of arsenazo III reagent, which has come” into wide use
since the publication of the first amonozgraph and is an excellent
reagent for the spectrophotometric determination of uranium.

I+ forms & brightly colored complasx with uranium (VI) and can be
used to detect uranium in the part-per-million range (and, in socme
cases, in even lower concentrations). The original series of
articles on the use of this reagent!”? should be read for details.

Procedure L also uses trioctylamine in the solvent extraction
~ of uranium from acidic agqueous media. This procedure employs
‘the use of 239U tracer to correct for the low (2 - 10%) uranium
yield. This isotope is convenient to use as a tracer since its
alpha decay energies (and these of its daughters) are above
. 5.8 MeV and therefore do not interfexre in alpha spectroscopy with
the peaks cf the more commonly encountered uranium isotopes.
The preparation of the 2%y tracer by irradiation of thorium is
also described in the procedure®. The alpha spectrum of the puri-
fied 3%y (and its daughters) is shown in Figure 3, in which the
separation frcm the alpha spectra of 3%y, 3%y, and 2'% ig
easily seen. Quantitative analysis of samples is obtained by .
alpha spectroscopy and an appropriate yield correction obtained
from the #?°U. Although the yield is low, this procecdure is
a useful one for soil whose complexity causes the low yield.

_ Procedures 5, 6, 7 and 8 involve ion exchange chromato-
graphy. Procedure S used Dowex-21K resin in either the malonic or
ascorbic acid form for the separation c¢f uranium from other metal
ions. This procedure is capablie of separating uranium from a
host of other metals, and is therefore useful for purifying uran-
ium from highly contaminated samples such as fission products.
Uranium forms ‘a stronger anionic complex with both maiosnate and
ascorbate than most other metals and is retained on the column
while other metals are preferentizally eluted with a series of
increasingly stronger eluting agents. Reported recovery is
excellent, S9% + 1%. Additionally, the procedure allows purifi-
cation of thorium, if it is present in the sample.

. Procedure 6 uses Amberlite XAD-4 resin, convertad to the arsoaic
acid form, to separate uranium from natural waters in samples of
up to one liter in volume. Uranium recovery is dependent on pH,
as shown in Figure 4. Recovery and separations from other ametal
ions is reported to be very good, with chromium(III) deing the
only interference. When present in equal concentration with
the uranium (0.5 ppm), approximately l1l1% of the chromium was
eluted with the uranium fraction.

In Frocedure 7, an initial column geparation using RDEH?
(di=-2=-athylhexylphosphoric acid) supported on 0.1 - 0.2 mm Teflon
seads is used both to isolate the uraniuz fraction from a sample
and to separate the individual U(VI) &and U(IV) fractions. The
separate f{ractions are purified by passage-through anion-exchange
resin columns prior to alpha spectromeiry. Large amounts of Fe(IIIl)
in & sample are reported to interfere with the separation.

- Bowever, reduction to Fe(Il) with hydrazine hydrochloride eliminates

this interference. '

: Procedure 8 employs a tetrahydrofuran-methy! glycol-HCl
pixture with Dowex-l anion resin to separate ura .am from acidified
natural waters. Quantitative analysis is performed bv optical
spectroscopy with arsenazo III. B

An increasingly important anaiyticel tool for alpha emitters
is employed in Procedure 3 wherein liquid scintillation alpha
counting is used to “etermine uranium in biological samples.
Instructions are give+: for t.~ use of both extractive and dispersive
scintillation cocktails. The cttractive cocktail gives slightly
lower background counts, and wcald probably be the more desirable
method for samples with lower uranium content. o

Procedure 10 is a neutron activation analysis for use with
solid biological materials. After irradiation, the uranium is
isoclated by solvent extracticn using HDEHP. The separated uraniux
is analyzed with a Ge(Li) detector by measurement of the 75 keV
gazmma ray of 2°°U. Reported yiei.ds are in excess of 90%.
Procedure 1l also describes a procedure of activation analysis.

in 196%, a procedure (reference 5} was published which quickly
became a leboratory standard for uranium analysis. Although it is
not really applicable to trace quantities of uranium, ner for
highiy radicactive samples, and has been supplanted by newer pro-
cedures, it is worthy of mention since it is still in common
use in many analytical laboratories. In this procedure, uranium
(¥I) is reduced to uranium(IV) by an excess of iron(II) sulfate
in a phosphoric acid-sulfamic acid solution. The excess iron(II)
is oxidized to iron(III) By nitric acid with a molybdenum(VI)
catalyst. The uranium(iV) is finally titrated with standard
potassium dichromate soluticn using barium diphenylamine sulfonate

as the indicator.

This procedure is applicable to solutions of 0-300 mg of
uraniwe per aliquot, with aliquot size up to about 15 ml. Optimum
uraniuz content is around 200 mg. There are relatively few inter-
ferences as compared with other redox methods, but vanadium,
bromide, iodide, and silver interfere directly with the redox
titrations of the U({IV). Additionally, if more than 100 mg of
of chromium{iII) is present, the indicator end-point <¢olor change
will be masked by the intense color of the chremium solution for
determination of trace levels of uranium in sclid samples by
neutron activation analysis in which no chemical separation is used.

73-82 (1977).

Sample Type: Bone and tissue samples. (This procedure can
be adapted te other sample types; these modified
procedures are referenced).

Procedure:
Sample Preparation:

1. A. For small bone or tissue samples (<25 g), dissolve in
concentrated nitric ac*d with a smell amcount of 30%
H,0, added. |

B. Heat gently until a clear sclution is obtained. (In
samples with small amounts of residual salts, do not
allow to go dry). |

2. A. For large samples (>25 g), dissolve by repected treatment
‘with HNO, {(conc.) and 30% H,0,, evaporating to near dry-
ness between each treatment.

B. Heat the sample to 450°C in a furnace cvernight.

C. If the resulting ash is not white, repeat the acid
- digestion and heating until a white ash remains.

D. Dissolve the ash in a suffirnient volume of 2 M HHO, .

3. Depending on the cocunting method to be used, further treat-
ment at this point varies:

A. For samples to de treated by anion exchange separatiqn,
dilute or treat the sample solution accordingly to give
the desired nitric or hydrechloric acid concentration.

B. For high activity samples to be cocurted with an aqueous-
phase-accepting scintillator, dilute the sample to
a known volume and add an aliquot to the scintillator.

C. TFor samples to be counted with an extractive scintillator
containing HDEHP. addé sufficient perchloric acid to the
sample solution to give & final solution which is 0.1 -

0.2 M HC1l0, and in which all metal ions have been converted
to perchlorate salts. (Observe the usual precautions

for adding HC1lC, to 2 solution containing small amounts

of organic material). The nitric acid is evapoirated at
slightly higher heat (150-170°C} in order tc leave only

the perchloric acid and salts. Add 2 =zl of saturated
£1(KO,), per gram of sample to the hot scluticn and
adé witér to make 3 ml of volume per gram of sample.

8.1 g POPC> (2,2-p~phenylene-bis-S-phenyloxazole)
385 m1 =wylene |
385 ml dioxane
233 21 ethyl alcohol
180 m»l Triton X-100

Up to 1 ml of aqueous sample sclution mﬁy be taken up in
the scintillator (volume approximately 15 ml).

The alpha peak of interest must fall within the pulse-height
range observed. This can be determined two ways:

~A. The peak may be located by counting through a narrow-ra:; e

window and scanning across the entire available .range.

B. A smultichannel analyzer can be connected to the scintilli-
ation counter. (This technique has the additional benefit
of allowing visual differentiation of the alpha and
beta-gamma spectral.

Unless each sample has a very similar matrix, the alpha peak
position must be determined for each sample tc maintain
reproducible counting efficiency.

Typical background count rates run about 20-30 cpm with an
additional 10-20 cpm (from %0K) per each gram of tissue in
a sample. The practical lower limit for counting should
be 2 total count of at least twice the background.

Counting in an Extractive Scintilliator:

Extractive Scintillator:

1

161 g HDEHP (di{2- ethylhexyl)phosphorlc ac1d)
80 g naphthalene
b g PBBO (2-u'-biphenylyi- 5-phenylbenzoxazole) or
S g PPO (2,5- dlphenyloxazole) | _

Transfer the sample (prepared as described under part 3.C. of
the sample preparation section) to a standard 20-ml scxntlll-
ation vial.
o

Roberts/Cheppin/Wild
psge 39

Add 16 mi of the extractive scintillator and shake for L
o 1 minutes. - ' '

Allow zhe phaseé to separate (removal of the aqueous ph&se
is not necnssary, however) and place the vial in the counter.

A background count rate of 15-20 counts/ainute from external
sources is generally the lower limit for the extractive -
scintillator proceduve. _

Alpha energies differing by more than 1 HeV may be dzstinzuxsh-
able since typical full peak width at half maximum peak height

is typically 0.9 - 1.0 MeV.

Note: The author describes a high resolution alpha scintill-
ation counting system in this paper and the one refer-
enced below. With that system, increased resolution
of complex mixtures is possible. Reported peak half-
width is 0.2 - 0.3 MeV and an energy identification

2. A small aliquot (50-250 ul) of the vanadium standard is

diluted to an appropriate volume (corresponding to the
final volume of the samples to be counted). During this
dilution, several milligrams of dissolved inactive wranium
carrier should be added to the standard solution to prevent
loss of the radiocactive uranium.

Yield: 31 + 4%, Slightly higher yields =ay be obtained
by using separatory funnels for the extractions -
(for lower mechanical losses), bu* this method

V. New Keptunium Procedures

INTRODUCTION

Neptunium is usually encountered zs “*7MNp (t4 = 2.1% x 10%y)
in acid solutions of uranium reactor fuel elements. Neptu-ium-237
is of relatively little use commercially except, pessibiy, for
the production of pure sources of ?*°Pyu (by reactor neutron irrad-
iaticn) and of ?°*U (the a-decay granddaughterof 2!’Np). The
amount of #*’Np in the environment generally is so small as to be
unmeasurable as compared to ?!®Pu, and no procedures were found
for separation of Np from environmental samples.

~Neptunium-239 is a transient species in reactor fuel elements,
due to its short half-1life (2.35d). It completely disappears
shortly after the end of a neutron irradiation through decay to
23%Pu. Neptunium-239 is most frequently used as a tracer to study
the chemistry of Np; it can be obtained from the neutron irradia-
tion of ?*°U or by milking a sample of **’Am with which it is in
equlilibriur as the a-decay daughter. -

Two procedures are described for the separation of Kp. The
first involves separation of #?°Np from irradiated ?3°U, and the
second involves separation of 2?’Np from a solution representing
that from a dissolved fuel element. .

VI. - Nev Plutonium Procedures

INTRODUCTION

Since 1965, when the original sonograph on the radiochemistry
of plutonium was published (1), significant changes have occurred
in the radiochemical separation and determination of plutonium.
Since the advent of a worldwide interest in ecology in the early
. 1970's, much attention has been directed at deteraining plutonium

concentrations in the enviromment: human and animal tissue,
plants, the atnosphere, and natural waters. These neasurements
involve the detection of extremely small concentrations of Pu in
relatively large matrices; e.g., liters of water or kg of tissue
or soil and sediments. This requires the reduction of the sample
and the quantitative concentration of the Pu to attain measurable
levels of activity free from interfering activities often in
s;gnxfxcantly greater amounts (e.g., natural uranium and thorium
and their daughters). _ .

Separat;ons procedures have been improved since 1965 by an
increase in the number and quality of solvent extraction reagents
which are available commercially. Many of the procedures presented
in the original monograph employed a solvent extraction step for
the purification of the Pu activity; most of these used either
thenoyltrifluoracetone (TTA) or tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP).

. Now available are such reagents as di-(2-ethylhexyl)orthophos-
phoric acid (HDEHP), trilaurylamine (TLA), tri-n-octylphosphine
oxide (TOPO), and tricaprylmethyiamine (Aliquat-336). Counting
methods have similarly improved with the introduction of the
silicon surface-barrier detector for a pulse-height analysis,
replacing the more coaplicated and cons;derably more expensive
Frisch grid with essentially nec loss in counting efficiency or
peak resolution. _

The proliferation of nuclear power reactors throughout the
world since 1365 has also led to the development of a great many
procedures for the separation of Pu in macroscopic concentrations
from other actinides and fission products resulting from the
dissolution of vranium reactor fuel elements. These are rot
considered among "he procedures for this monograph since they
generally do not Jend themselves well to a laboratory-scale
separation, but rather are relevant to a processing-plant
. operation with all the attendant precautions against radiation
hazards and leakage of radicactivity into the environment.

DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES

The procedures presented herein reflect the interest in
messuring plutonium concentrations in the ecosphere arising prim-
erily from two sources: fallout from the large number of atmos-
pheric nuclear weapons tests conducted prior to 1363 by the Unzted
~Roberts/Choppin/wiid
: page 139

States, the United Xingdom, and the Soviet Union and, in

then, by the Chinesa and the French; and the int$odueti:=n::
szall amounts of Pu to the environmunt through the discharge

cf decontaminated low-level waste solutions by processing plants
and other laboratories employing radiochemical techniques.

With the exccgtion of Procedures 7 and 9 the fellowing
methods a2ll use solvent extraction, by either batch separation
or column chromatography, as the main purification-concentration
step. Procedures 1 - 7 use electrodeposition of the sample
followed by ¢ pulse-height analysis3 for the Pu deteraination;
procedure 8 uses absorption spectrophotometry and procedure

. 9 uses standard scintillation counting. Electrodeposition is
generally carried out from a solution of ammonium chloride or
ammonium sulfate; procedures 1-6 offer 'semi-detailed descriptions
of the process. See the Reference 1 for 2 more detailed des- '
cription of the electrodeposition cell and conditions affecting
the plating of Pu onto a metal disk. Occasionally, Pu in warm

or hot HNO, can be oxidized to the VI state which is no- retained,
subsequentiy, on an anion resin column. The use of NaNO, in -
.these procedures ensures that Pu is present in oxidation state

III.

A word of caution: at higher pH values (> &), Pu(IV) tends
to form a hydroxy-polymer which cannot be easlily destroyed and
which behaves differently from Pu species in higher acid con-
centrations. Methyl red indicator, used for adjusting the salt
and acid concentration in the electrc:lating solution, has a pH -
range of 4.4-6.0 for the equivalence point color change. If the
solution remains tco long at the yellow (basic) color, this
hydroxy-poiymer of Pu could form, thus severely reducing the
electroplating yield. Tne use of methyl orange (pH range 3.1-4.4)
as an indicator might serve to alleviate this potential danger.

Much recent research in plutonium chemistry is reviewed
in the papers in Refergnce 2.

INTRODUCTION

Thorium exists in oxidation 1V and the transplutonium
actinides are typically trivalent although some use is made of
other oxidation states in their separation schemes. Uranium is
most comweonly found a&s U(VI) in the form of the divalent U0 .
However, neptunium and plutonium exist rather readily in oxgdation
states III, IV, V and VI. Since the behavior in nature of these
latter two elemerts is dependent on the oxidaticn state or states
present in a particu.ear scil or water, a major problem has been
the separation of the neptunium and plutonium 3zpecies present
in a sample without changing the redox equilibria. The next
three procedures are schemes for such separations. :

In the first procedure, a combination of selective sorption
and solvert extraction is used to separate Np(IV), Np(V) and
Np(YiI}). The same procedure works for plutonium. The second
procedure uses solvent extraction by TTA with aqueous solutions
of different pH values to achieve separation of the IV, V and
VI states. Since many nagtural waters are about neutral, a similar
procedure has been developed using dibenzoylmethane (DBM) which
1s less scluble in neutral aqueous solutions than is TTA. This
is described in Procedure 3 for oxidation states III, IV, V and V¥I.
The An(IV) is sorbed on the vessel walls in the first extraction
but is pla ed in sclution by the dilute HCl and extracted sub-
sequently.

Separation of Kp(IV), Np(V) and Np(VI) by
Adsorption and Extraction

Source: Y. Inone and 0. Tochiyama, J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem.,

39, 1uu3 (1977).

Sample Type: Solutions

Procedure:

1.

(a)
(b)

Adjust an aliquot of the Np solution to pH6é with acetic acid
and/or ammoniuz hydroxide at a total volume of 5 ml. Add 100
mg silicic acid powder (100 mesh). Shake occasionally for

30 nig. iThe Np(IV) and Np(VI) are 100% sorbed, leaving Kp(V)
in solution.

After separation by centrifugation, adjust the pH to 10-ll and
add a fresh 100 mg sample of silicic acid. With 30 minutes
occasional shaking, the Np(V) sorbs coapletely.

To a fresh aliquot of the Np solutxon. add HC10, to cktain 5 ml
solution which is 1M in RC10,

Prepare a frtsh precipate of BaSO, by mixing 1 ml each of

.1 M Ba(NO and 0.2 M Na,SO, After 30 min, remove the
supernate aﬁd add the Np so utxon. Allow 310 min for cocmplete
sorption of the Np(IV) with no sorption of Kp(V) or Np(VI).

Cxidation state differentiation can alsoc be achieved with
40% (v/v) TBP in benzene. From 3 M HCl solution, after 5-10
min, 90V extraction of Np(VI) is obtained with <5% Np(IV)

and Np(V). From 6 M HCi solutlon, after 5-1C min, 80% Np(IV)
and 100% Np(VI) but no Np(V) is extracted.

Note: This method has >=en used Zor pluteonium also.
Pu(¥) sorbs on CaC0, (ref. a) and TiO, (ref. D) and can be
separated from Pu(Ui) by a modificatidén of the above procedure
since Pu(IV) sorbs at lower pH values.
