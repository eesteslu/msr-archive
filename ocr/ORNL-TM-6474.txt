ABSTRACT

A radiological environmental assessment was performed for
airborne releases from a thorium mining and milling facility
based on site-specific analyses for known vein-type U.S. thorium
ore deposits, using proximate meterological data for the geo-
graphical region where these deposits are located. The assess-
ment was done for a conceptual open-pit thorium mine plus a mill
having a throughput rate of 1.5 Gg (1600 metric tons/day). The
thorium ore was assumed to have an average ThO, equivalent content
of 0.5%4. The mill facility consisted of a mill and refinery
whose product was reactor—-grade thorium nitrate tetrahydrate.
Several assumptions were necessary in order to conduct this
analysis due to scarcity of data specific to erosion and dusting
of thorium ore storage piles and a thorium mill-derived tailings
beach.

Radiological dose commitments were calculated for airborne
effluents from the mine and mill facility, using the AIRDOS-II
code. The 50-year dose commitment to the maximally exposed
individual and to the population, as shown by the 1970 census,
living within 50 miles of the operation site was estimated for
both Lemhi Pass, Idaho, and Wet Mountains, Colorado, sites.
Principal airborne radionuclides which contribute to the popu-
lation dose commitment for either site are 228Ra and 220Rrn plus
the daughters of 2ZPRrp. Total-body dose commitments to the
maximally exposed individual for one year of facility operation
for the Lemhi Pass and Wet Mountains sites are V2.4 and 3.5
millirems respectively. Population dose commitments to total
body for the Lemhi Pasz and Wet Mountains sites are 0.05 and 0.3
man-rem respectively. Tor both sites and both types of dose
commitment, inhalation and ingestion are the largest pathway con-
tributors to the dose. Several operations for thorium ore mining
and milling were identified during this assessment for which the
data base required for radionuclide source term generation was

either small or nonexistent. For operations where the data
base was judged insufficient for generation of at least a
first-approximation source term, data appropriate to the
similar operation for uranium mining or milling were used as
the basis for the source term. Areas where data needs are
greatest include (1) quantitative wvalues of emanation factors
and diffusion coefficients for %20Rn for thorium ore materials,
(2) fugitive dust generation rates from mine activities and
thorium ore piles, (3) release rates of 220Rpn from thorium
ores under various storage conditions, (4) release rates of
220Rn from thorium ores for various milling process treat-
ments, (5) properties of soils in mountainous locations of
vein-type thorium deposits to determine their suitability for
construction of tailings ponds and retention of radioactive
species contained in the mill tailings, and (6) site-specific
meteorvlogy appropriate to prime candidate sites for thorium
mines and mills.

 

1. INTRODUCTION

The thorium-—uranium nuclear fuel cycle is being studied in several
programs in the United States in order to better identify the nuclear
weapons proliferation resistance of this cycle compared with that of
the uranium-plutonium cycle. Another important feature of any fuel
cycle considered for commercialization is the radiological impact of the
cycle on the population. The impact derives from several sources,
including contributions from ore mining and milling, fuel fabricatioua,
reactor operation, transportation, fuel reprocessing, and fuel refabri-
cation,

This report describes the results of a radiological analysis of the
impact of thorium ore mining and milling from vein deposits at two
specific sites, one in the Lemhi Pass district of Idaho and Montana and
the other in the Wet Mouantains of Colorado. Mining of vein-type deposits
was analyzed because they are of the highest grade, and it is estimated
that as much as 407 of United States thorium reserves reside in such
deposits.

Compositional data for the known vein-type thorium ore deposits plus

the local topography of the region were employed in establishing details
of a model mine capable of providing 1.6 Gg (1600 metric tons) of ore
per day plus a mill of equivalent throughput capacity. This plant is
considered to be of reasonable size for such a mining endeavor.

This analysis differs in certain respects from a related and recently
published study of thorium mining and milling reported in ERDA 1541 con~
cerning the Light-~Water Breeder Reactor Program. In the current work,
recently improved assessment codes were employed and two site-specific
cases were analyzed. The entire mining operation was considered to be
open-pit type based on the geology of the known ore deposits at the sites.
Source terms are included based on dust from the mining, movement of ore
at the mine and mill, and ore crushing, plus the release of 220y from
the mine, ore pile, mill, and tailings pond.

The appropriate source terms‘were used along with population
density and meteorological data for the sites to estimate the population
dose commitment associated with the extraction and processing of the

thorium ore.
2, FACTLITY SITING, METEOROLOGY, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
PERTAINING TO THORIUM ORE DEPOSITS

2,1 U.S. Thorium Deposits

For the purposes of this report, it is assumed that the sources of
thorium to be considered are within the continental United States.

Thorium is found in several types of deposits in this country, including
(1) veins, (2) stream and beach placer deposits or placer deposits
incorporated in sedimentary rock, and (3) concentrations in igneous or
metamorphic rocks. The largest recoverable thorium reserves are in the
form of vein or placer deposits. Thorium dioxide resources in the
United States available at a cost of $11 to $22 per kg ($4 to $10 per
pound, 1969 dollars) are placed at approximately 600 Gg (600,000 metric
tons).?!

Monazite sands, which are primarily phosphates of the rare-earth
elements, are formed as a result of the weathering of rocks such as
granites. Running water carries the sands to locations remote from the
original rock formations to places where conditions permit the heavier
minerals to settle; this may occur in a river, or the sands may be
carried to the ocean and coastal locations. Wave action has resulted in
placer deposits of heavy minerals, such as ilmenite and wmonazite, along
some beaches on the Atlantic Coast of the United States. A few of these
deposits have been worked commercially to recover titanium-bearing
minerals with monazite as a secondary product. Large-scale working of
beach deposits in the future is unlikely, however, because of the high
populdtion density of the coastal region.

Figure 2.1 and Tables 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) present available information
concerning significant thorium resource sites in the contiguous United
States., Table 2.1(a) gives the locations, extent of sampling and observed
thorium content, physical dimension, and nearby populations for vein-
type deposits of thorium in the United States.' 1?2 Table 2.1(b)
identifies deposits of other types but which are predominately monazite
ores.13717,31-3%  Ttrems A and B give the locations of placer deposits

was estimated at 14 Gg (15,600 tons). The Folkston deposit has been
reported more recently, however, to have been exhausted.3® Basnaesite
deposits are being mined at Mountain Pass, California (item C). Two
extensive deposits are identified as item D, The western belt extends

for 1 Mu (600 miles) from eastern Virginia southwest to Alabama. It
ranges from 0.02 to 0.8 Mm (10 to 50 miles) wide with an average width

of about 0.03 Mm (20 miles). The eastern belt originates near Fredericks-
burg, Virginia, and continues for about 200 miles into North Carolina

with an average width of about 0.01 Mm (5 miles).

2.2 Sites Selected for Analysis

The most promising thorium deposits for large—scale exploitation
are thorite-bearing veins such as those located in Colorado, Idaho,
and Montana. As much as 407 of U.S. thorium reserves occur as vein

deposits.18

Reserves equal to about 100 Gg (100,000 metric tons) of
ThO, at $22 per kg ($10 per pound) or less (1969 dollars) are estimated
to be available in the Lemhi Pass district of Idaho and Montana,1 which
lies astride the Continental Divide about 16 km (10 miles) east of Tendoy,
Idaho. The Lemhi Pass is shown on the relief map19 in Fig. 2.2 between
the vertical coordinates UEO~-UEl and the horizontal coordinates 8-9.
The thorium resources of the Lemhi Pass district could supply the
requirements of a very large number of FBRs fueled with (Th, U)C and
ThC, since calculations by Caspersson et al.?0 show a core blanket
requirement of 83 to 117 Mg (83 to 117 metric tons) of thorium carbide
equivalent per 1200-MW(e) core, depending on the core and blanket
configuration. Additional vein deposits have been found in the Powder-
horn and Wet Mountains districts of Colorado.

The winters in the Lemhi Pass district are described as moderate,
and some of the deposits at the lower elevations can be worked vyear
round. In severe winters, operations may, however, be shut down for

several months.

2.3 Characteristics of Deposits in the Lemhi Pass District

Information on the topography, general geology, and the nature
of the thorium-bearing deposits in the Lemhi Pass area is given in
Atomic Energy Commission reports by Sharp and Hetland and by Austin

issued in 1968,21,22

Over 200 samples were taken from about 100 pros-
pects along a 110-km (70-mile) trend paralleling the Idaho-Montana
border from Leadore, Idaho, to North Fork, Idaho. Elevations in this
region range from 1.5 km (5000 feet) above sea level along the Lemhi
River up to 2.7 km (9000 feet) at the Continental Divide. The ore
minerals include phosphatic thorite, monazite, and rare—earth concen-
trations. Rare-earth phosphates such as xenotime (YPO,) form an isomor-
phous series with thorite (ThSiO,) to yield the mineral aueralite. The
ratio of rare earth to thorium in these deposits varies from 10:1 to

23 on

1:5. Additional information was reported by Ross and George
metallurgical amenability tests and compositions of Idaho-Montana
thorium ores. Spectrographic analyses show that these ores contain
undetectable amounts of uranium (<0.0001 to 0.001%).

The thorium-bearing veins are, in general, not exposed but are
covered by a thick layer of soil. The presence of the veins can often
be detected by surveying the soil cover for radiocactivity with sensitive
instruments., Detection is possible due to a degree of mixing of minerals
from the veins with the soil. Bulldozing is necessary to expose the
veins. The vein deposits show a northwesterly trend paralleling the
Continental Divide from the vicinity of Leadore, Idaho, at the southern
end, and all are found in an area about 110 km (70 miles) long and 13 km
(8 miles) wide. The inclination of the veins varies, particularly near
major faults. It is estimated that 60% of the veins dip at angles of 45
to 60° and 40% dip at >60°. The flatter-dipping veins are from 0.9 to
4,6 m (3 to 15 ft) wide, while the steeper veins measure 0.15 to 1.5 m
(0.5 to 5 ft) wide. Flat-dipping veins paralleling canyon walls can be
mined by open-cut methods, possibly to 91 to 122 m (300 to 400 ft) below
the outcrop. Underground methods would eventually have to be used to
recover a major portion of the thorium. This study does not, however,

consider the radiological hazards of underground thorium mines.
11

Borrowman and Rosenbaum?" demonstrated the recovery of the thorium
content of thorite samples by acid dissolution. These samples were
taken from vein deposits in the Lemhi Pass district of Tdaho~Montana and
the Powderhorn and Wet Mountains districts of Colorado. The samples

ranged in content from 0.2 to 3.9 wt % thorium dioxide equivalent.

2.4 Population Distribution

Population data specific to the thorium resource sites under study
in this report were obtained via the "Reactor Site Population Analysis"
computer code available at ORNL. Output from this code is based on
U.S. 1970 census information. Approximation of future population data
was not deemed necessary for the purposes of this report, since thorium
mining and milling population doses were found to be low, and population
centers with the potential for significant growth are located at dis-
tances in excess of 32 km (20 miles) from either the Lemhi Pass or Wet
Mountains sites, a condition which renders the dose estimation procedure
relatively insensitive to moderate vpopulation increases., Tables 2.2 and
2.3 present population data breakdowns as input to the AIRDOS-~II dose

estimation code.

2.5 Meteorological Data

Since variations in meteorology have the potential for significantly
modifying both individual and population doses calculated via methodologies
using wind and stability category-dependent radionuclide dispersal models,
use of local rather than generic meteorological data was deemed necessary
in this study. Best available meteorological data for both the Lemhi
Pass and the Wet Mountains resource sites were obtalned from first-order
weather stations located near each site. Two sets of data were obtained
for each resource site, since no first-order weather station is located
in the immediate wvicinity of either Lemhi Pass or Wet Mountains. These
data were obtained through the courtesy of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration offices located at the National Climatic

Center (NCC) in Asheville, North Carolina, and were provided in the form

of monthly or seasonal summaries of wind speed and Pasquill stability
category data based on extended observation periods. The data were
condensed into AIRDOS-II format via ORNL IBM-360/91 computer manipulation
and are presented in this condensed format in Appendix 1 of this report.

As noted in Sect. 2.2, it is anticipated that severe weather in the
Lemhi Pass region may shut down mining (but not milling) operations for
the winter months, since temperature, wind, and snowfall hinder outdoor
operations. This report therefore assumes the establishment of an ore
pile adjacent to the mill of a size sufficient to continue milling
operations uninterrupted during the period December through February. It
is concurrently assumed that mine-generated source terms are reduced to
near zero during the winter season at the Lemhi Pass site. For this
reason the appended AIRDOS-II meteorological summaries (Butte and Mullan
Pass meteorologies) utilized in thorium mining AIRDOS-IT dose estimations
were composed from data excluding the winter season., Dose calculations
for the Lemhi mill, ore pile, and tailings beach utilize four—season
meteorological summaries, as do all calculations for the Wet Mountains
site, where the winter climate is less severe,

The original STAR program meteorological summaries are on file at

ORNL. and at NCC-Asheville and are accessible under NCC I1.D. as follows:

 

Thorium resource site  Best available meteorology  Station No. STAR run

Wet Mountains Alamosa, Colorado 23061 12/13/77
Wet Mountains Pueblo, Colorado 93058 1/23/75
Lemhi Pass Mullan Pass, Idaho 24154 11/21/77
Lemhi Pass Butte, Montana 24135 3/22/72

Because no reliable method is available to determine which of the
substitute meteorologies best represents exact conditions at the thorium
resource site under consideration, dose estimates in this study were
calculated for all four sets of meteorological data, and discussion
emphasizes those meteorologies found to maximize radiological dose, a

conservative procedure.
14

Detailed long-term study of wind speed and stability class wvaria-
tions at representative thorium resource sites is necessary before less
conservative radiological studies can be performed for these sites,

To assist the reader in visualization of climatological conditions
at the two resource sites, narrative climatological summaries have been
abstracted from the STAR program data as obtained from NCC, and from
25-27

other sources and are presented in the following pages.

NARRATIVE CLIMATOLOGICAIL SUMMARY

Lemhi Pass Area

The thorium deposits in the Lemhi Pass area are centered approxi-
mately 16 km (10 miles) east of Tendoy, Idaho, over an area of about
260 km? (100 square miles), astride the Continental Divide, which forms
the Idaho-Montana border. The area 1s mountainous but not rugged and is
characterized by rounded ridges rising steeply from the valley floors,
providing sharp relief of as much as 0.91 km (3000 ft). The altitiude
ranges from 1.5 km (4800 ft) above mean sea level in the Temhi Valley
to 2.4 km (9000 ft) at the Pass. North~facing slopes in the higher
elevations are well timbered with pine, fir, and hemlock. Nontimbered
areas are covered primarily with bunchgrass and sagebrush.

Predominant wind direction in the area is from the west with little
seasonal variation in direction. Wind velocities average between 3.1
and 4.0 m/sec (7 to 9 mph) throughout the year.Z5,26

January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of -12°C
(10°F). July and August both record approximately 16°C (60°F) mean
temperatures as the warmest months of the year. Mean temperatures in
spring through fall progress in an orderly fashion from cool to warm to
cool, without secondary maxima or minima. The period between the last
freeze of spring (late June) and the first freeze of fall (late August)
averages about 60 days. The mean annual number of days for which the
daily wminimum tewmperature is below freezing is 240, An average of two
days each year exceed a temperature of 32°C (90°F). The average daily
temperature range is 18 C° (32.5 F°), with the greatest range (22 C°,

40 ¥°) occurring in July, August, and September.
15

Total annual precipitation for the Lemhi area averages 0.6 m
(24 in.), evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual
number of days with measurable precipitation is 120. Mean annual snow-~

fall is 2.5 m (100 in.).28

NARRATIVE CLIMATOLOGICAL SUMMARY

Wet Mountains Area

The Wet Mountains are located about 80 km (50 miles) southwest of
Colorado Springs and about 60 km (35 miles) west-southwest of Pueblo on
the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the San Isabel
National TForest. These mountains are oriented northwest-southeast with
peak altitudes of about 4 km (13,000 ft), and the terrain slopes down-
ward to the east and northeast along the valley of the Arkansas River.

The vegetation around Pueblo is sparse, and the region is largely tree-
less. Along the skirts of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains the San Luis
Valley lies from northwest to southeast, with the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument located at the southwest extremity of the Sangre de
Cristos. The town of Alamosa is located about 40 km (25 miles) south-
west of the Great Sand Dunes National Monument within the San Luis Valley.

The wind directions in Alamosa are usually from south-~southwest,
southwest, and west-southwest with 8.5 te 11 m/sec (19 to 24 mph)
maximum and 5.4 to 5.8 m/sec (12 to 13 wph) mean velocities. 1In Pueblo
the wind is usually from the northwest or west, except in May and June,
when it blows from the west or southwest. Seasonal mean wind velocities
range from 3.1 to 5.4 m/sec (7 to 12 mph). Maximum wind velocities during
December through July occur during the afternoon hours and reach 8.5 to 11
m/sec (19 to 24 mph). Between August and November, maximum velocities
reach 5.8 to 8.0 m/sec (13 to 18'mph).29’30

The coldest month is normally December (-7°C, 20°F mean temperature),
but differences between the mean temperatures of December, January, and
February are small. August 1Is usually the warmest month, but differences
between the mean temperature of June, July, and August are also relatively
small. Mean temperatures of the spring and fall months progress in an

orderly fashion from cool to warm to cool without secondary maxima or
16

minima. The average period between the last freeze of spring (May 30) and
the first freeze of fall (August 15 to August 30) is 82 days. Annual
occurrence of daily minimum temperature 0°C (32°F) or below is 210 days.
Temperatures of 32°C (90°F) or above occur an average of 11 days annually.
The average daily temperature range is about 18 C° (32.5 F°).

Normal annual total precipitation is between 0.4 and 0.6 m (16 and
24 in.). Summer is the season of heaviest precipitation, with the
monthly maximum normally occurring in July (0.08 m, 3 in.) or August
(0.05 to 0.10 m, 2 to 4 in.). A mean of 92 days annually receives
measurable (0.25 mm, 0.01 in. or more) precipitation. Annual snowfall

is 1.5 to 2.5 m (60 to 100 in.).?%7

3. DESCRIPTION OF MODEL MINE AND MILL

3.1 Facility Description

The characteristics of the mine and mill considered here are similar
to those described in the environmental statement for the Light-Water

1 Mine and mill characteristics are listed in

Breeder Reactor Program.
Table 3.1. Actually, the ore may originate from concurrent mining of
several veins at different locations. In a study of possible mining
methods and costs applicable to the Lemhi Pass area, Peck and Birch
reported2 selection of a mill site where power, water, and an area
suitable for a tailings pond can be provided. This site wcould locate
the mill at an average distance of 7 miles from the majority of the
deposits. The distribution of Chese deposits in the viecinity of the
Lemhi Pass and the towns of Tendoy and Lemhi, Idaho, is shown in
Fig. 3.1. Location of the veins was identified from a reconnaissance
map obtained from the Grand Junction Office of the Department of Energy,3
Locations of the veins are indicated on the relief map copy, Fig. 2.2,

Flat or mildly dipping veins near the surface would be mined first
using open—cut methods since this is least costly. The radiological
effects on the environment of open pit vs underground mining should be
similar. Figure 3.2 shows the principal features of an open-pit mine,
which include overburden storage, surface-drainage diversion, and haul-
road access. The actual appearance of the mine would depend on the local
terrain and the characteristics of the particular vein being mined. The
location of some veins will allow natural drainage rather than pumping
from a sump. Not shown but required is a holding pond for mine drainage
water to provide for removal of suspended solids by settling. 1If close
enocugh to the mill, this water can be used as part of the mill-process
requirements. Otherwise, it will be disposed of by evaporation or
natural seepage to groundwater.

The mill complex will be composed of an ore storage area, a tailings
pond, and buildings to enclose ore processing and thorium nitrate tetra-

hydrate (ThNT) product refining equipment. While it is possible that

study are best served by analyzing the impact of a local refinery, as

well as mine and mill impacts. The thorium ore pile will contain a

3.2 Thorium Mining

The overburden is first removed by bulldozers or other earth-moving
equipment and transferred to a storage pile. The exposed vein(s) of
thorium-bearing ore is broken up by bulldozers, dozer-rippers, or
selective blasting as required. Spot analyses are made of the thorium
content of the ore, and the results are used to classify the ore for
subsequent blending. Front-end loaders of about 5.4 Mg (5.4 metric tons)
capacity transfer the ore to 35-Mg-capacity (35-metric ton) trucks to
haul the ore to the mill. Generation of dust at the mine will be mini-

mized by frequent sprinkling of the surface with water.

3.3 Thorium Milling and Refining

3.3.1 Introduction

The model plant chosen for identification of airborne effluents

produces reactor-grade ThNT. The ore processing rate was 1.6 Gg of
25

thorite ore per day containing 0.5% ThO; and 300-day annual operations.
A 91% recovery of thorium was assumed. This is the same processing rate
as reported in a previous study.1 The nitrate salt was chosen as the
end product since it is a convenient starting point for the denitration,
sol-gel, or coprecipitation routes to preparation of metal oxides.

Because there is at present no industry in the United States which
produces thorium as a primary product, the model plant for the milling
and refining of thorium ore was patterned after those reported for

uranium ore.”

The model plant selected for thorium ore consists of a
milling and a refining operation (Figs. 3.4 and 3.5). The conceptual
flowsheet for the mill was derived from chemical flowsheets reported

by the U.S. Bureau of Mines,”»® whereas the conceptual flowsheet for

the refinery was derived from a flowsheet developed for the reprocessing
of irradiated Th02.7 Mass and the volumetric flow rates are given for

key process streams in the conceptual flowsheets in Table 3.2.

The mill employs sulfuric acid leaching of the ground ore to solu-
bilize the thorium, which is then purified and concentrated by an amine
extraction process to produce a crude thorium product. The crude product
is subsequently refined by TBP (tributyl phosphate) solvent extraction
to yield reactor-grade ThNT.

It should be emphasized here that the chemical flowsheets utilized
are conceptual in nature and have not been demonstrated on a pilot scale
with all of the process steps operating in tandem. We assumed that the
mill and refinery would be colocated for the purposes of this study. It
is realized that the refinery could be geographically separated from the
mill if overall economics, availability of skilled labor, or material
resources dictate it. It was not the aim of this study to determine the

best overall process and equipment configurations.

3.3.2 The ore storage pile

 

An outdoor storage pile containing a 60-day supply (96 Gg) of ore
is assumed to be located about 60 m from the mill (Fig. IX.G.3-2, ref. 1).
The stockpile will have the form of a rectangular parallelepiped with a
base 100 x 32 m and a height of 15 m. The ore will be transported from
the stockpile to the ore crusher by front-end loaders. Due to thorium
decay, 220Rn will escape from the stockpile. Ore dusts will be generated

by the transportation associated with the stockpile.

3.3.3 Ore preparation

 

Ore conditioning consists of a series of dry crushing and wet grinding
operations preparatory to acid leaching. A gaseous radioactive effluent
(stream 3, Fig. 3.4) results from the release of all the 220Rp inventory

v and

in the ore, which is assumed to occur in the dry crushing operation
during its residence in the ore bins. Air from the dry crushing and the
ore storage bins is assumed to contain entrained radioactive particulate
matter which is removed by bag filters (stream 4, Fig. 3.4) before being

released to the stack.l»"

 

3.3.4 Sulfuric acid leaching

The wet ground ore is leached with sulfuric acid in order to solu-

bilize the thorium values.”»® Radon-220 is released from the leachers
28

as a consequence of the decay chain ??"Ra (3.14 x 10° sec) ~ 220gp

(55.6 sec). The leacher off-gases are scrubbed before being released
to the stack. Mechanical stirring rather than air sparging is assumed
to be employed in the leachers to minimize entrainment of liquid droplets

which contain soluble radionuclides.

3.3.5 Countercurrent decantation

The slurry from the leachers is passed through a liquid-solid
separation to recover the solubilized thorium values. The solubilized
thorium is transferred to the solvent extraction unit. The washed
residual solids are pumped to a tailings pond for storage. The tailings
pond, which contains 2327h daughters from the residual solids as well
as a small amount of unrecovered thorium, is a source of radicactive

effluents and is discussed in Sect. 3.3.11.

3.3.6 Amine solvent extraction

 

The leached thorium values are purified and concentrated by solvent
extraction, This is done utilizing a primary amine in a hydrocarbon
diluent with an alcohol additive to obtain desirable physical properties
for the extractant.%»2»6 Recycling the aqueous raffinate is employed
to reduce the process requirements for water and mitigate the problem
of disposing of a radioactive liquid effluent from the mill. About
5.7 x 1072 m3/sec (1.7 x 10° ft3/day) of aqueous raffinate is produced
by the amine extraction (Fig. 3.4). In our conceptual flowsheet, about
95% of the flow of this stream is assumed to be recycled to the counter-
current leaching and washing operations. Assumption of 95% recycle of
this stream may be optimistic and requires experimental verification.
There is not enough information available to determine whether recycle

is severely hampered by buildup of deleterious impurities.

3.3.7 Stripping
Thorium is stripped from the loaded organic extractant by an aqueous
(NHy )2 COg solution.® Other aqueous salt solutions may be used for

stripping;S’8 however, the potential advantages of (NH,),CO03 will become
29

apparent in the discussion of subsequent operations. The stripped

organic is recycled after washing.

3.3.8 Steam distillation

 

The aqueous strip solution is decomposed by steam distillation to
yield a crude thorium solid product, and NH3 and CO, are recovered and
recycled.® Experimental work is needed to determine the percentages

of the NH; and CO, that may be recycled and to demonstrate feasibility.

3.3.9 Filtration

The crude Th(CO3)> product of the milling operation is filtered and
washed to remove the (NHL)»S0y, which is treated with Ca(OH), and steam-
distilled to recover the NH3.6 Thorium carbonate undergoes further
purification in the refinery to produce reactor-grade Th(NOj3),*4H,0. Over-
all recovery of thorium through the milling process is estimated at
91%.°3

3.3.10 Thorium refining

 

The Th(CO3)2 mill product (stream 7, Fig. 3.4) is dissolved in HNOjg
and subjected to a solvent extraction cycle using 30%Z TBP in normal paraf-
fin hydrocarbon diluent as the extractant (Fig. 3.5). Thorium is obtained
from a stripping column as a dilute HNO3 solution which is concentrated
and crystallized to obtain reactor-grade Th(NO3),;*4H,0. The organic
extractant phase will be recycled in this operation. Packaging of the
ThNT would generate airborne radioactive particulate matter. Before air
from this operation is released to the stack, it 1s passed through a bag
filter and then through an HEPA filter. Thorium recovery for the refining
cycle is estimated to be 99.5%.7

Aqueous solutions of nitrate wastes (streams 2 and 3, Fig. 3.5)
are produced in the refinery and are impounded separately from the mill
tailings. The best method for impoundment has not yet been determined;
but an example ;f an acceptable method? may be a neutralization of the
combined waste streams to immobilize any soluble radionuclides and sub-
sequent impoundment of the wastes in a barrier-lined evaporation pond.

Although the present study does not deal with liquid wastes, those future
30

investigations which do should take cognizance that experimental infor-
mation is needed in regard to (1) the radionuclide and chemical composi-
tion of the aqueous nitrate wastes and (2) the possible process options
for recycle of nitric acid and water, and the percentages of recycle of
these waste components that are likely to be attained using these options.
In the conceptual flowsheet for the refinery (Fig. 3.4), it was assumed
that significant amounts of the nitric acid and water could be evaporated
or distilled and recycled. However, it is not known whether deleterious

impurities might be introduced into process streams by this recycle method.

3.3.11 The tailings pond

 

Large quantities of liquid and solid wastes are produced in the
milling of thorium ores. About 1 kg of solids and 1.5 kg of liquids will
be produced per 1 kg of thorium ore processed. This waste is impounded
in a tailings pond within the restricted mill area where the solids separate
out and are eventually allowed to dry. The residual dry solids are per-
manently impounded on this site. Since approximately 1.6 Gg/day of solids
contains about 0.23 TBq (6.3 Ci) of radicactivity from the decay of
232Th, at the time of discharge the amount of activity available over the
assumed 20-year life of the mill operation is appreciable. The tailings
pond is a potential source of airborne radiocactive effluents due to
(1) the release of 220Rn and (2) wind-generated radiocactive dusts from
the dry solids. There is also a possibility of other types of radio-
nuclide source terms because of the potential for seepage of liquids
containing soluble radionuclides from the tailings pond into the sur-
rounding terrain. Soluble radionuclides may also be present in the
liquid phase of the mill wastes. If the solubilities of 2327h, 226Ra,
and 210pp in liquid wastes from uranium mills" are assumed to be repre--
sentative of the solubilities of the corresponding radionuclides in the
thorium mill waste liquids, the appropriate values for this case are:

4.11 MBq/m3 for ?32Th, 41 Bq/m? for 2?28Th, 70 MBq/m® for 22"%Ra, 5.14

MBq/m3 for 228Ra, and 290 MBq/m3 for 212Pb. Experimental data are needed
to determine whether the analogy with the pond liquor for uranium mills

is correct. The absence of certain elements such as barium in thorium ores

could apptreciably increase the solubility of radium. Recommended practices
31

in the siting, construction, and management of tailings ponds to minimize
release of radiocactive effleunts have been described previously,1=”’9’10
and these have been utilized in designing the pond described here. It
was outside the scope of this study to determine radionuclide source terms
resulting from seepage of liquids.

The impoundment is formed by constructing a dam on terrain with
favorable topographical and geological features to minimize the potential
for seepage. At normal liquid discharge rates of mills in the early stages
of the operation, the tailings solids will be covered by liquid. The
combined effect of increasing tailings volume and water evaporation will
eventually expose the tailings solids. During mill life, measures are
taken to prevent the solids from completely drying and becoming subject
to wind erosion. During the time liquid waste is present in the tailings
pond, a potential exists for the seepage of soluble radionuclides into
the surrounding terrain. 1If this seepage reaches the local aquifers, it
becomes a radiocactive liquid effluent., Careful siting and construction
of the tailings pond will minimize seepage. Monitoring for radiocactive
seepage with provision for its collection and return to the tailings
pond is employed in the design and is used as a control measure. Again
it is emphasized that this study does not deal with the potential for
liquid waste releases and its site-specific aspects, particularly the
potential for seepage through the bottom of the tailings pile and for
horizontal movements that might reach surface streams.

At the end of the mill operation, the tailings pond is permitted to
dry in a controlled manner so that only a relatively small area of dry
tailings is exposed to the atmosphere at any time and is thus subject
to wind erosion. After drying is completed, the active residue is
covered with a layer of protective material sufficient to substantially
reduce the escape of 229Rn to the atmosphere and to immobilize the dry
tailings with respect to wind erosion. Because of the relatively short
half-1life of 220Rn (55.6 sec), only about 0.30 m (v1 ft) of earth cover
is required to reduce its emission by a factor of ~OE/. The stability
of the dry tailings pile and its covering with respect to geological

and climatological factors is beyond the scope of this study.

4, GENERATION OF SOURCE TERMS

4.1 Mining
4,1.1 Radon-220

Release of 220Rn from a thorium mine will depend on several physical
and chemical characteristics of the ore plus the amount of exposed ore
in the mine. It is assumed here, as in ERDA~1541,1 that 3 acres of
thorium-bearing ore containing the equivalent of 0.5% ThO;, are exposed
in one or more pits being worked to supply 1.6 Gg/day (1600 metric
tons/day) of ore to the mill. There appears to be no information in
the technical literature relating to the measurement of 220Rn release
from vein-type ore deposits. Radon-220 release as reported in ERDA-1541
was calculated by assuming that the characteristics which control the
release from thorium ore are the same as those of a sandstone uranium
ore from Ambrose Lake, New Mexico.! Radon-222 release from this sand-
stone was reported at 2.16 mBq/cm?+sec (0.0583 pCi/cm?+sec) by Schroeder
and Evans. Using an expression developed by Culot and Schaigerl’2
and correcting for differences of 2%22Rn and 229Rn half-lives and of the
concentration of their radium parents in the ores, a flux rate was cal-
culated for 220Rn of 1.32 kBq/m%-sec (3.56 x 10" pCi/m?-sec), or a
total of 16 MBg/sec (4.32 x 108 pCi/sec) from 3 acres of exposed ore in
the open-pit mine. Additional details of the calculation of 220pn flux

from the mine are shown in Appendixes 2 and 3.

4.1.2 Fugitive dust

A number of activities at the mine site will contribute to entrain-~
ment of dust in the air. In most envirommental statements, dust formation
and control is treated only in a qualitative manner by stating that
appropriate measures will be taken to meet federal and state air quality
standards with the expectation that the off-site effects will be negli-
gible. Information upon which to make a quantitative determination of
the amount of fugitive dust which will be generated is limited, and at
best a number of assumptions must be employed. However, in spite of

the required assumptions, a source term for fugitive dust generation at
34

the mine site is calculated as part of this analysis. Movement of heavy
equipment, drilling, and blasting will contribute to generation of
fugitive dust at the mine. A major portion of dust from vehicles will
come from movement of front—-end loaders and ore haulers. Front-end
loaders of 3 m® (4 yd3) capacity would make 296 "trips" per day, amounting
to about 18 km (11 miles) to move 1.6 Gg (1600 metric tons) of ore.
Concurrently, 35 Mg-capacity (35-metric ton) ore trucks would make 46
trips amounting to 27 km (17 miles). As shown in Appendix 4, the amount
of dust raised by vehicular traffic can be estimated from the speed and
distance traveled.® At an estimated average speed of 8.9 m/sec (20 mph),
about 450 g (1 1b) of dust will be injected into the air for each mile
traveled if the surface is dry, resulting in generation of about 13 kg
(29 1b) of dust per day. Other activities at the mine will double this
to about 26 kg/day (58 1lb/day). The expected dampness of the ore plus
routine sprinkling of the mine area with water should reduce the rate of
dust generation by about 50%.3 The concentration of thorium in the air-
borne dust will be further reduced to about half that of the ore by
dilution with rock containing no thorium. An estimate of the contribution
of the mine dust to airborne activity is given in Table 4.1. For lack
of the necessary information, no attempt was made to estimate wind-blown
loss of ore dust from trucks in tramsit to the mill.

4.2.1 Introduction

Methods of calculations and calculated values of the airborne radio-
active source terms from the model mill and refinery are presented in
this section. Because there were no experimental data available for
making source term calculations on thorium milling and refining, we
made the assumption that the distribution of radionuclides throughout
the liquid or solid process streams was essentially identical with
that of a uranium wmill and refinery.L+ In the case of the gaseous
radionuclide 22%Rn, we assumed it had the same escape potential from
the ore and tailings as does 22ZRn (after correcting for half-1life
difference) in the processing of sandstone ores of uranium. This assump-
tion regarding 220Rn emission may lead to an overly conservative estima-
tion of the source term, since the escape factors from different types of
minerals vary greatly.?> Clearly, experimental data are needed for many
of the operations in the thorium milling and refining flowsheet. Areas
requiring experimental data will be pointed out in the subsequent
discussions.

Even with the uncertainties of the assumptions used in estimating
source terms for thorium milling and mining, we believe our study shows
that the airborne radionuclide releases for a thorium mill and refinery
are comparable to that of a uranium mill and refinery of equivalent ore
capacity and design. In order to determine the values of source terms
with a reasonable degree of confidence, experimental data are needed
regarding the escape of 220Rn and the distribution of all members of the
thorium decay chain throughout the process streams.

Source terms estimated for the ore storage pile, the mill and
refinery, the tailings beach and pond during 20-year operation of the
mill, and the covering of the dry tailings at the end of mill life are
shown in Table 4.2. Concentration of the radionuclides in the ore and
tailings as used in source term estimations were calculated by the ORIGEN
code® and are given in Appendix 4. A summary of these concentrations is

given in Table 4. 3.

%pssumes nuclides are of a concentration that is 2.55 times
greater than the average in the bulk tailings (ref. 4).

P raximum 228Th concentration in aged tailings (10.5 kBq/k%)
occurs approximately three years after discharge because of 232Th
decay. In calculating source terms, a correction factor allowing
for the age of the tailings was utilized. Maximum concentration

4.,2.2 The ore stockpile

 

The ore stockpile is assumed to contain 96 Gg of ore, which is
equivalent to a 60-day supply for the model mill and is assumed to be
in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped with a base 100 x 32 m and
a height of 15 m. Its surface area is 7160 m?. The ore stockpile is
a source of airborne effluents due to radioactive ore dusts and the
emission of 22%Rn. WNo model was available for calculation of a source
term resulting from the action of winds on the ore pile. The only
source terms calculated were those of 2?0Rn emission and particulates

resulting from the movement of ore to and from the site.

4,2.2.1 Radon-220 emission. The 220Rn emission from the ore

 

stockpile was calculated in the following manner, using Eq. (5) developed
in Appendix 2. The 220Rn flux from the surface of the ore stockpile is
given by

3, = 4550 (kp~ 1y 1/2 | (1)
where

(xp~ 1) = 5E-6 m?/sec

(a term related to the diffusion of 42%Rn in the porous medium; we

assumed the wvalue for coarse sand“),

0 = bulk density of the ore stockpile, 2E3 kg/m?> .
Substitution of these values into Eq. (1) gives

Jo = 2.04 kBq/m?%ssec .
The emission of 229Rn from the 7160-m? surface is

220pn = 7160 x 2.04 = 14.6 MBq/sec (3.94E8 pCi/sec) .
38

4,2,2.2 Ore movements at the mill site. Ore is transported from

 

the stockpile to the mill by front-end loaders, and it is reasonable
to assume that some spillage will occur. The spilled ore will be further
pulverized by the road traffic and impacted into the unpaved road. Dust
subsequently raised by traffic on this road will constitute a source
of airborne radioactivity. The calculation of this source term is made
in a similar manner to that for movement of ore at the mine site.

A front-end loader transporting 5.4 Mg of ore per load will require
296 "trips" to move 1.6 Gg of ore per day from the stockpile to the mill,
an assumed distance of 60 m one way or a round trip of 120 m. This is
equivalent to an average speed of 0.41 m/sec. The road speed of the
transporter is assumed to be 8.9 m/sec.

The dust generated by this traffic3 as a function of vehicle speed

is given by expression (2):

76(1.158)° (2)

total distance traveled per day.

Substitution into (3) gives 115 mg/sec (22 1b/day) for a dry surface.
Wetting the unpaved road is assumed to reduce dusting by 50%, that is,
to 58 mg/sec. The rvoad dust generated in this manner is assumed to have

a thorium content approximately 507% of that of the ore. The source term
39

for 232Th is calculated to be 520 mBq/sec. Source terms for the release

of the other radionuclides from ore movements are shown in Table 4.2.

4.2.3 Dry crushing and sizing

 

All of the 22%Rn inventory is assumed to be released during the

crushing operation.l

Ore particulate releases were calculated assuming
that 0.008% of the ore was released as a dust! to bag filters which
operate at 99.3% efficiency.1 This assumption implies that 0.77% of the
dust entering the filters was released to the atmosphere; thus the
fraction of ore that is airborme is 5.6 x 10~7., The source term was

calculated to be

220g,

17.7 kBq/kg ore x 18.5 kg/sec

328 kBq/sec (8.9E6 pCi/sec) .

An example calculation of the particulate source terms is as follows:

232TH = 328 kBq/sec x 5.6E~7 = 0.18 Bq/sec (5.0 pCi/sec) .

The filter burden of ore dust for this operation is about 1.5 g/sec.

4.2.4 Acid leaching of ore

 

Radon~220 produced by the decay of 22%Ra during the 12~hr leaching
period is considered to be the only radiocactive emission from this opera-
tion. It requires only about 10 min for the %2%Rn (t1/2 = 55.6 sec)
to reattain secular equilibrium after it is released. Therefore, it was
assumed that process holdup in bin storage allowed sufficient time for
220Rn to reattain secular equilibrium. For purposes of contrast, <22Rn
present in uranium ore requires about 40 days to reattain secular
equilibrium.

The source term for 220Rn was calculated by the following equation:

220 = . . . .
Rn = Cp = Agpg = E = w - £, (4)
40

where

CRn = gecular equilibrium concentration of 220Rn, 17.7 kBq/kg ore,

Aosg = decay constant for 229Rm, 0.0125/sec,

t = leaching time, 4.32 x 10" sec,
w = mass of ore processed per day, 1.6 Gg, (18.5 kg/sec),
f =0.2.

The factor f corrects for the decay of 220Rn in the time period between
its generation and release.! Using Eq. (4), the calculated value of the
220Rn source term is 35.3 MBq/sec. Technology is available for increasing
the holdup (factor f) so that the 2?ORn release is negligible, provided
detailed cost~benefit analyses justify it. However, it was outside the

scope of the present study to make this assessment.

4.2.5 Other mill operations

 

The remaining mill operations, including amine solvent extraction,
stripping, steam distillation, and filtration are not regarded as sources

of airborne radioactive emissions.

4,2.6 Thorium refining

 

The fraction of Th(NO3),+4H,0 dispersed as dust is assumed to be
the same as the fraction of yellow cake dispersed as dust in a uranium
milling operation. This quantity, 1.25% of the product, becomes airborne
to the filters.'' The bag filters operate at 99.3% efficiency, which is
equivalent to a product loss of 0.7%Z. An efficiency of 99.95% was
assumed for the HEPA filter located downstream of the bag filter.
Thorium recovery through refining but not including packaging is assumed

to be 99.5%. The source term for 232Th was calculated using Eq. (5):

232Th = (W) (R) (D) (L) (?32Th) (w) , (5)

where

(232Th) = thorium activity = 4.03 MBq/kg.

The resulting source term for 232Th or 228Th 1g 13.0 mBq
(35.0E~2 pCi/sec).
Due to lack of data on dusting characteristics of Th(NOj3),*4H,0,
it was assumed that they are similar to those of uranium yvellow cake
powder. If this assumption is not supported by later experimental data,

the calculation of a more realistic source term can be made easily.

4,2.7 Source terms for the tailings impoundment

 

4,2.7.1 Introduction. The tailings impoundment is a source of
220Rn and airborne particulates during both mill operation and final
covering of the dry tailings after the mill operations have ceased.
A 220Rn source term results from a flux generated at the surface of
both the exposed dry tailings and the pond. Soluble 22%Ra in the pond
liquor is responsible for the flux at the surface of the pond. We
assumed there would be a negligible 220Rn flux resulting from wet tailings
underneath the pond. The relaxation length for diffusion of 220Rp
(tl/z = 55.6 sec) in water is about 300 ym. The flux resulting from
this source would be negligible in comparison to those from the dry
tailings beach and from the pond surface due to the “2%“Ra dissolved in
the pond liquid. The particulate source terms resulted from a flux term
generated by the prevailing winds at the specific site. The flux term
for 220Rn was calculated by the diffusion model previously described
(Sect. 4.1 and Appendix 2), wherecas the particulate flux term was cal-
culated from the saltation model.’ Since the source terms are a product
of a flux term and an area term, it was necessary to develop a model for
determination of the average surface area of the dry tailings beach and
of the pond during mill operations and during final covering of the

tailings pile.
42

The general features of the tailings impoundment basin were previously
described in Sect. 3.3.11. Details of the development of the calculational
models for the estimation of the average surface area of dry tailings
beach and the pond are given in Appendixes 6, 7, and 8. The rate of
exposure of dry tailings and the growth of the surface area of the pond

are a function of the evaporation rate and the geometric configuration

8 at the Montana and

of the tailings impoundment. Evaporation rates
Colorado sites were estimated to be 19 and 29 nm/sec respectively.

The combined effects of increasing tailings volume and water evaporation
eventually expose the tailings (Table 4.4) during mill operations. After
mill operations have ceased, natural evaporation is utilized to dry up

the pond so that covering of the residual tailings can be accomplished
(Table 4.5). Covering may begin before the end of mill life or after mill

operations have ceased. Note that the model tailings pond employed in

this study never reaches a ''steady-state' surface area during mill

During mill operating life, it was assumed that chemical sprays and/or
wetting were utilized to reduce the amount of airborne particulates and
that covering would commence near the end of mill life. This procedure
was assumed to reduce the average effective dry tailings area by about
90%. For the Montana and Colorado sites the reduced areas were 4.0E2 and
36E2 m? respectively. After the end of mill life, it was assumed that,
on the average, about 4.0E3 m? of dry beach surface was exposed per year
during the tailings covering process at each site. We assumed that
whenever 4.0E3 m? of dry beach (9 x 440 m) was exposed by evaporation,
covering of the tailings pile commenced and was carried out at a rate
commensurate with the rate of generation of an additional 4.0 x 103 m?

of fresh tailings surface.

4.2.7.2 Source terms for the emmission of 220Rn. The flux terms
for 220Rn for the surface of the dry tailings and the pond were calculated
using the diffusion equation previously described. The calculated flux

terms were

Jo (tailings) = 1.67 kBq/mz-sec .

J, (pond) = 19.3 Bq/mZ-sec .
Details of the flux calculations are given in Appendix 9. The calculated
source terms for the 20~year mill operation and covering of the tailings

pile at the end of mill life for the hypothetical Montana and Colorado

mills are given in Table 4.6,

A factor of 0.6 was used to correct for decay of 22%Ra parent.

It is possible to contour the surface of the tailings pile near the
end of mill 1life, so that the time required to dry out the pond is
decreased. However, this would not decrease the source terms significantly.
The equivalent area of dry tailings would have to be exposed during mill
life to accomplish it. There may be economic advantages to shortening
the on—-site activities as quickly as possible after mill operatiomns
cease. Again, it is pointed out that it was not the object of this study
to determine the optimum operational methods, processes, and equipment

for the thorium mill and vefinery.

4.2.7.3 Source terms for airborne particulate emissions. The

 

source terms for radiocactive emissions from the milling waste solids

are due to wind-borme dusts from the dry tailings beach. During mill
operations the tailings deposit is either kept wet or treated chemically
to prevent dusting. These procedures may not be completely effective,
and it may be expected that a small dry beach will be subject to wind
erosion. At the close of mill operations, the taillings impoundment

is permitted to dry in a controlled fashion and at this time wmay be
subject to wind erosion.

It was assumed that the principal mechanism for the generation of
dusts is saltation, a process whereby the larger wind-drivem particles
with diameters >80 um impact on the smaller particles and cause their
suspension in the air. The application of saltation theory permits the

calculation of the amount of wind-borne dust generated and consequently
45

the amount of wind-borne radioactivity.7 The working equations for

galtation calculations are

d_ = 36.22V2 (6)

v, = 0.166(ds)0-5 , (7)

q = 9.318 x 10“3(ds)0-5 (V’-V£)3; v>v), (8)

Q, = Kqg , (9)
where

dt = threshold diameter of the largest particle moved by the wind,

um,

V = wind velocity at 1 m above ground, m/sec,

dS = gverage diameter for saltation for wind velocity V, um,
Vt = threshold wind velocity for ds’ m/sec,

q = saltation rate (q = 0 for V < Vt)’ kg/m-sec,

QS = particulate suspension rate, kg/mz-sec,
K =

1 x 10>, m ',

The numerical values used in these equations result from various
experimental values and estimates. The calculations are based on
knowledge of the applicable wind velocities and the particle size dis-
tribution for the tailings (Table 4.7). Saltation cannot be caused by
particles <80 um in diameter, and since the tailings have a negligible
concentration of particles >600 um in diameter, the particle size range
leading to saltation of the tailings is established. First, the
threshold diameter, dt, for each wind velocity is determined [Eq. (6)],
and then the saltation diameter, dg, is calculated from the weighted
average of particle diameters between 80 um and d¢ (Table 4.8). The
threshold wind velocity, Vi, for each dg is then calculated by use of

Eq. (7). These values along with corresponding wind velocities are used

4.2.7.4 Long-term stabilization of the dry tailings pile. A

 

source term for the covered dry tailings pile after the mill operations
have ceased and the residual pond liquid has been evaporated was not
calculated. As pointed out in Sect. 3.3.11, in principle the 220Ryp
(172 = 55.6 sec) source term can be reduced by a factor of about 5E7
with the use of about 0.3 m (1 ft) of earth cover. Also, the covering
would reduce the airborne particulate source term to near zero. Such
source terms would be negligible in relation to those calculated for our
model plant during mill operation and final impoundment operations.

The stabilized thorium mill tailings would not present the potential
long-term radionuclide source terms as do the uranium mill tailings,
which contain 22°Ra (t1/p = 1622 years) and its secular equilibrium
daughter 222Rn (t1/2 = 3,82 days). The longest—-lived daughter in the
232y decay chain is 228Rg (t1/2 = 5.75 years). After a decay period
of about ten half-lives, the tailings pile will be equivalent to a thorium

ore body containing about 0.057% thorium oxide.

5. RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

The radiological impact to man resulting from the operation of the
model thorium mining and milling complex is assessed by calculating
the dose to the maximally exposed individual and the total dose to the
population living within a 50-mile radius. There are several potential
pathways of exposure to man from radioactive effluents released to the
environment. These are illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.1. Radio~
nuclides enter the environment from a facility via either liquid or
atmospheric transport modes. They reach man through one or more col-
lectors (air, soil, or water) with possible reconcentration by animals,
crops, or aquatic biota. Pathways of human exposure include inhalation,
ingestion, immersion, land surface contamination, and submersion. Ulti-
mately, energy is deposited in human tissue by the radionuclides via
internal or external exposure.

Radiological impact is calculated as the 50-~year dose commitment,
to individuals or populations, in units of millirems or man-rems per
year of facility operation. The dose commitment is calculated for a
specific intake of radionuclide and is defined as the total dose to
a reference organ, resulting from a one-year exposure, which will accrue
during the remaining lifetime of an individual. For radionuclides
that have short biological or physical half-lives, the 50-year dose
commitment would be approximately the same as the annual dose rate.

For example, all of the dose commitment for %29Rn exposure (including
radon daughters) is received during the first year.

On the other hand, 232Th is eliminated from the body very slowly
and has a long half~life (1.4 x 10!0 years), so that an individual will
continue to receive a dose from the ingested material for many years
after exposure., Under these conditions, the approximate dose received
in the year that the radionuclide enters the body is obtained by
dividing the dose commitment by 50. Thus the average annual dose rate
is only 1/50 of the dose commitment. Tf an individual is exposed to
mill effluents for the 20-year operating life of the plant, his annual
dose rate during the twentieth vear 1s about 20 times the annual dose

rate for one year of exposure, and his total dose commitment is the

a more precise value for the actual dose received in a given year.l

The exposed person is assumed to be an adult, 20 years of age,
having physiological parameters defined by the Intermational Commission
on Radiological Protection (ICRP).? In our report the terms "dose
commitment" and "dose'" are used interchangeably; each implies a 50-year
dose commitment. Doses to specific organs can vary comnsiderably for
internal exposure from ingested or inhaled radionuclides concentrated
in certain organs of the body. Estimates of radiation dose to the total
body and to major organs are, therefore, considered for all pathways
of internal exposure and are based on parameters applicable to the
average adult. Radiation dose to the intermal organs of children in
the population may vary from those received by an adult because of
differences in radionuclide metabolism, organ size, and diet.3

Population total~body dose estimates are the sums of the total-body
doses to individuals within 50 miles of the mine-mill complex. It is
assumed for the purposes of this report that radiation dose to the total
body is relatively independent of age;"“ therefore, man-rem estimates
are based on the total-body doses calculated for adults. Similarly, the
population dose estimates for the various organs are the sum of specific
adult organ doses for the individuals within 50 miles of the plant. The
man-organ—-rem estimates are also based on adult organ doses.

The AIRDOS-II computer code® was used to estimate 50-year dose
commitments from effluents released to the atmosphere. The AIRDOS-II
code is a FORTRAN-IV computer code that calculates the dose commitment
to individuals and populations for up to 36 radionuclides released from
one to six stacks. Site-specific annual average meteorological, popula-
tion, beef cattle, milk cattle, and crop data are supplied as input to
the computer code. OQutput data include ground-level radionuclide
concentrations in air and rate of deposition on ground and water surfaces
for each radionuclide at specified distances and directions from the
release point. From these values, doses to man at each distance and
direction specified are estimated for total body, GI tract, bone,
thyroid, lungs, muscle, kidneys, liver, spleen, testes, and ovaries,
via each of the five significant pathways illustrated in Fig. 5.1.

Dose calculations are made with the use of dose conversion factors

supplied as input data for each radionuclide and exposure mode. Dose
53

conversion factors for submersion in the gas-borne effluent, exposure

to contaminated ground surface, and intake of radionuclides through
inhalation and ingestion are calculated by the use of dosimetric criteria
of the TICRP and other recognized authorities. These factors are computed
and summarized in twe computer codes, one for external exposure,
EXREM~III,® and one for intermal exposure, INREM-II.’ Because recent
revisions have been made in the INREM-II data base, a number of dose
conversion factors used in this study are listed in Table 5.1 and
supercede those listed in ref. 7.

Radiocactive particulates are removed from the atmosphere and
deposited on the ground through mechanisms of dry deposition and
scavenging. Dry deposition, as used in this analyvsis, represents an
integrated deposition of radicactive materials by processes of gravi-
tational settling, adsorption, particle interception, diffusion, chemical,
and electrostatic effects. Deposition velocity values for particulates

range from 0.1 to 6.0 cm/sec.®

Based on an analysis of the effect of
deposition velocities on estimates of radiological impact, a value of

1 cm/sec is used for calculation of ground concentrations of radioactive
particles for this facility. Scavenging of radionuclides in a plume is
a process through which rain or snow washes out particles or dissolves
gases and deposits them on the ground or water surfaces. Methods for

estimating the scavenging coefficient can be found in Meteorology and

Atomic @nergz.B

5.1 Additional Assumptions

Many of the basic incremental parameters used in AIRDOS-II indi-
vidual and population dose estimates atre conservative; that is, values
are chosen to maximize hypothesized intake by man. Many factors that
would reduce the radiation dose, such as shielding provided by dwellings
and time spent away from the reference location, are not considered.

It is assumed that persons remain unghielded at the reference location
100% of the time. Moreover, in estimating the doses to maximally
exposed individuals via the ingestion of vegetables, beef, and milk,
all the food consumed by this individual is assumed Lo be produced at
the reference location specified. Thus the dose estimated for the
maximally exposed individual in this and other studies using AIRDOS-II
is likely to be higher than doses that would occur in a real-world
situation.

A special case exists in the methodology for the calculation of
dose from 22%Rn which deserves further elaboration. For purposes of
this report, 220gn gas is released from four locations within the
mine-mil]l complex: the mine proper, the ore storage pile, the mill-
refinery, and the tailings beach. It was further assumed that the
nearest residence is located no closer than 1 wile from these facilities,
in the direction of the prevailing wind. Given the short half-life of
220gn (55.6 sec), we conservatively assumed in this study that all
220gp decays to airborne 212py particulates prior to crossing the
l-mile facility boundary. Doses listed in the results as due to
"220pn + D" (?20Rn + daughters) are therefore actually the result of
ingestion and inhalation of 212pp, for both the maximally exposed
individuals and the general populations. As confirmation of the accu-
racy of this approximation, doses were independently calculated both
for 220Rn gas alone and for 2!2pp suspended as dust (rather than created
by decay of airborne 220Rn) from the four site operations. Doses calcu-
lated for these cases were insignificant in comparison to %1%PL doses
generated from airborne 220Rn and were excluded from the tabulated
results.

Additionally, dose commitment to the lung, as computed for this

report via the INREM-II code7, is calculated as dose to the entire
55

lung, commonly identified as the "smeared lung' dose. Dose to the

bronchial epithelium region of the lung from ?2ORn daughters may be

higher than that to the entire lung. A discussion of this relationship

is available in Dunning et al., Vol. II.?

6. ANALYSIS OF RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT

6.1 Maximum Individual Doses

The maximum individual doses at 1 one mile from the point of release
of radionuclides are shown in Table 6.1. Data are listed for both the
Lemhi Pass site and the Wet Mountains site; meteorologies for each site

are also indicated.

For lemhi Pass, the Butte, Montana, meteorology gives doses that are
slightly higher than those for the Mullan Pass meteorology. Therefore,
the Butte meteorology will be considered in greater depth in this
analysis. Lung is the critical organ, receiving a dose commitment of
35.3 millirems, while 9.5 and 2.4 millirems are delivered to bone and
total body respectively. At the Colorado site, the Pueblo meteorology
gives the highest doses. Again, lungs and bone are the organs receiving
the highest doses, 33.4 and 13.1 millirems respectively, while dose to
total body is 3.7 millirems.

A breakdown of the dose by radionuclides to various organs is shown
in Table 6.2. For the Lemhi Pass site, 229Rn and daughters are the
primary contributors to all organs. The second most important radio-
nuclide is 22BRa, delivering 367 of the dose to total body and thyroid.
The relative distribution of the dose from radionuclides at the Wet
Mountains site is similar to that for Lemhi Pass, with the exception

that 22B8Ra is the major contributor to total body (59%) and thyroid (59%).

Contribution of 220Rn and daughters of 220Rpp,

The contribution of various exposure pathways to the dose commit-
ment to the total body, bone, and lungs is shown in Table 6.3. For
Lemhi Pass, ingestion is the primary mode of exposure for total body
(47%) and bone (61%), while inhalation contributes 99% of the cose to
the lungs. A similar distribution exists for the Wet Mountains site.

Additional AIRDOS-1) computer runs were made to determine the
increase in dose commitment if the site boundary were located at 0.5
mile from the point of release of radionuclides, instead of 1.0 mile
as assumed in this assessment. It was determined that the maximum
individual dose would increase by a factor of approximately 2.3 when
the distance to the maximally exposed individual is reduced by one-half.
Maximally exposed individual dose commitments calculated in this report
could be reduced by imposing more stringent controls on the handling of
ore and tailings and/or more effective treatment of airborne radio-
nuclides prior to release at the mill site.

Maximum individual doses from thorium mining and milling appear to
be comparable to those reported in assessments on uranium mining and
1

milling operations. However, it is emphasized that many of the assump~

tions made in this study are based on extrapolations from current practices

in the uranium mining and milling industry. These assumptions may not

be exactly correct for thorium mining and milling. Therefore, as the
thorium industry expands to accommodate the demand for thorium as a fertile
material in nonproliferative fuel cycles, this assessment should be
extended to include on-~site measurements of source terms and meteorological

and environmental parameters.

6.2. Population Doses

Population dose commitments in man-rems for each site and meteorology
considered are listed in Table 6.4. Bone, lungs, and kidneys receive
the highest doses at each site. The dose commitments for the Wet
Mountains site (Alamosa meteorology) range from five to seven times higher
than those for the Lemhi Pass site (Butte meteorology). This difference
1s primarily due to the greater population of the Wet Mountains area.
Table 6.5 lists the contribution of radionuclides to the population-
organ-dose commitments. The most important radionuclides are 220Rrn
and its daughters, which deliver 64 to 987 of the dose to the organs
shown. Radium=-228 is the second most important contributor, with the

remainder of the dose being given by 2327h and 428Th,

%Contribution of 220Rn and daughters of 220Rn.

The contribution of various exposure pathways O the population
dose for each site (Butte and Alamosa meteorology) is shown in Table
6.6. The dose to total body is rather uniformly divided between inha-
lation (39%), surface exposure (36%), and ingestion (25%). Dose to
bone is primarily by inhalation (53%), while surface exposure and
ingestion contribute 18 and 247% respectively. Exposure to lungs is

almost entirely from inhalation of particulate matter (98%).

Population dose commitments appear to be acceptable in terms of risk
to the public when compared with those reported for mining and milling of

uranium ores.1

One factor leading to relatively low population exposures
from thorium mining and wmilling is the rapid decay of 220gn (55.6 sec)
compared with that of #?ZRn (3.8 days). This property implies that the
mean distance of 220Rn transport from the site will not be great before
decay to particulate daughters. Since the probability of deposition
through washout, rainout, or gravitational settling is greater for
particulates than gases, daughters of 220Rn are less likely to reach

populated areas.

Again, however, it must be emphasized that these calculations are

based on source terms that have primarily been developed {from assumptions

and extrapolations from mining and milling of uranium ore., Effort should
be made to incorporate actual data from a large-scale thorium operation

as it becomes available.

6.3 Dose Commitments Following Plant Shutdown

An analysis of maximum individual doses during the first year

following plant shutdown indicates that dose commitments are significantly
62

lower than during facility operation and would continue to decrease with
time. Typical postshutdown dose commitments are shown in Table 6.7.
The lungs receive the highest dose (6.8 millirems), bone second
(6.1 millirems), and total body and thyroid third (2.1 millirems).
Primary contributors to the dose {(Table 6.8) are 228Ra for bone, total
body, and thyroid; and 42%Rn + D for GI tract, lungs, liver, and kidneys.
The only other important contributors are 228Th, which delivers 12% of
the dose to liver and a smaller percentage to other organs, and 232rh,
which delivers 11% of the dose to liver and 5% of the dose to bone.

Table 6.9 shows postoperational exposure via the different path-
ways. Ingestion is the dominant pathway for all organs with the excep-
tion of luags, where inhalation contributes 97% of the dose due primarily

to airborne 212Pb, a daughter of 220Rpn.

Population dose commitments for the first year after shutdown are
shown in Table 6.10, It is evident from these data that population
dose commitments would drop significantly after the facility ceases
operation and would continue to drecp with the decay of 232Th daughters
present in the tailings. The highest postshutdown doses occur at the
Wet Mountains site (Alamosa meteorology). Radionuclide contributors
to the population dose commitment are listed in Table 6.11. As with
the postoperational individual doses, the primary contributors are 228Ra
for bone, total body, GI tract, thyroid, and liver; and 220pn + D for
Jungs and kidneys.

Figure 6.1 illustrates that 232Th-chain daughter activities are
controlled by the 1.39 X 101 0—year half-life of 232Th in fresh ore. Since

91% of this 2327h is assumed to be removed during the milling process,

the tailings beach radionuclide chain activity would then be controlled
largely by the 5.75-year half-life of 228Ra, Thorium-228, also removed
in the milling process, is assumed to again approach equilibrium with
228Ra activity in the tailings during the 20-year plant lifetime.
(Calculation of postshutdown radionuclide releases takes into account
the layering of material in the tailings beach, correcting for reduced
228Th activity in recently released tailings materials.) Extraction of
232Th from thorium ore therefore effectively reduces the long-term
toxicity of the tailings by approximately an order of magnitude and
causes the short-term toxicity of the tailings (controlled by 228Ra) to
be maximized during the period immediately following shutdown, decaying

with a 5.75-year half-life toward recontrol by the reduced 232Th content.

6.4 Impact of Mine-and Mill-Generated 220Rn on Populations
Qutside the 50~mile radius

To illustrate the relative radiological impact of mine- and mill-
generated 220Rn, calculation of the total U.S. population dose due to
crustal 232Th content follows. The average crustal abundance of 232Th
is estimated to be 10.33 ppm,% or 1.03 x 107> g Th/g crust. Using an
average soil density of 2 g/cm® and a decay rate A for 229Rn of
0.693/55.6 sec = 1.27 x 107%/sec, an exhalation rate from soil for 2?ORn
of 0.336 pCi/cm?-sec has been calculated.? Multiplying this rate times
the area of the contiguous U.S., 8 X 1016 cmz, gives the total 220Rp
exhalation rate for the contiguous U.S., 2.69 x 10'® pCi/sec. Eichholz"
has estimated that the human lung receives an annual alpha dose of
0.6 millirad from daughters of naturally emanating 220Rn; other organs
receive lesser doses.

The 229Rn activity leaving the 50-mile~radius circle surrounding
the hypothetical mine and mill site may be calculated as follows: The
average sum of the estimated 220Rn activities generated at the mine and
mill site (from Sect. 4.1) is 2.2 x 10° pCi/sec. Allow a l-sec increment
of 220rp gas (2.2 x 10° pCi) to travel downwind to the 50-mile radiums
boundary at 15 mph (an arbitrarily chosen wind speed). During the
3.33 hr required for transit to the boundary, the 220Rn activity (A)

At

is reduced to A = A e , where A = 2.2 x 109 pCi, A = 1.27 x 107?%/sec
66

and t = 1.2 x 10" sec. Therefore, the 220Rp activity per second leaving
the 50-mile diameter under these assumptions is 2.2 X 109 pCi x

(7.6 x 10787y = 1.7 x 107°7 pCi, an insignificant activity when compared
with the 2?9Rn exhalation rate calculated in the preceding paragraph.

To complete the analysis, it is necessary to consider the impact of
212ph, daughter of 220Rn. Since one atom of ?12Ph is created per decay
of an atom of 220Rn, 212py activity is calculated by multiplying the
activity of 220pn released by the ratio of the radionuclide half-lives
(see Fig. 6.1). Thus, release of 2.2 x 107 pCi/sec of 220Rn at the

facility results in the effective release of

- :212
g pCi _ 55 sec 1 hr _ g pCi“ " “Pb .
2.2 x 10 ec © 10.6 hr ~ 3.6 X 10° sec 3.2 x 10 sec

The AIRDOS~II computer code was used to estimate air concentrations
of this 212Pb particulate both at the l-mile facility boundary (locatiom
of the hypothetical maximally exposed individual) and at the 50-mile
study area boundary. Meteorology specific to Butte, Montana, was used
(see Appendix 1), and parameters including radionuclide decay, dilution
in the atmosphere, dry deposition, and scavenging (see Sect. 5) were
incorporated. Under these conditions, maximum air concentrations occur
in the northeasterly direction from the facility. The concentration in
air for “12Pb particulates at 50 miles vs 1 mile is reduced by a factor
of about 3 x 103.

Table 6.1 lists doses to the maximally exposed individual at 1 mile
under these conditions, and Table 6.2 lists the percent contribution
of 220Rn + D (essentially 212pp) to these doses. Doses from 2'?Pb to a
maximally exposed individual at 50 miles from the facility would be
roughly proportional to the 212ph air concentration (above) and would
therefore be reduced with respect to the tabulated doses by approxi-
mately 2.9 x 103, Under the conservative conditions used for maximal
exposure {(see Sect. 5), doses due to 220Rn + D (212pb) release would
approximate 5 x 107" millirem to total body, 2 x 1073 millirem to bone,
and 1 x 1072 millirem to lungs at 50 miles from the facility. Doses
to individuals residing outside this boundary, and not subject to maxi~
mal exposure conditions, would be further reduced and are judged insignif-

icant when compared with natural background 220gn + D exposures.

6.5 Discussion

Effect on estimated doses of variation in population size

One of the goals of this study was the radiological assessment of a
range of thorium resource sites to estimate a range for the radiological
hazards associated with the mining and milling of thorium. Analysis
of available literature indicated the likelihood that, in the event of
wide-spread implementation of a thorium~uranium~233 fuel cycle, extraction
of large quantities of thorium would occur primarily in the vein deposits
of the western United States. Iﬁspection of data estimating thorium
reserves at the various western resource sites led to identification
of the Lemhi Pass and the Wet Mountains areas as likely to be worked.
These sites were chosen for further analysis based on data indicating
nearly 20 times the population residing within a 50-mile radius of the
Wet Mountains site as compared with the Lemhi Pass site. This size
range in potentially impacted populations provides the primary basis for
the study's range of a factor of 4 to 5 (Tables 6.4 and 6.10} in

estimated radiological doses for the two populations.

Effect on estimated doses of substitution of meteorological data sets

As noted in Sect. 2.5, choices of meteorological assumptions have
the potential for significantly modifying doses calculated for fuel
cycle facilities. Table 6.1 indicates that, for the meteorological
data sets used in this study (and described in Sect. 2 and Appendix 1),
lung doses to maximally exposed individuals may vary by as much as 10%
in the case of the Lemhi Pass site and 16%Z in the Wet Mountains case,
depending upon choice of meteorological data. Presumably, choice of
less site-specific meteorological data, including generic or average
U.S. meteorological summaries, could lead to further uncertainty in
maximum individual dose estimates.

Population dose estimates (Table 6.4) are also found to be sensitive
to choice of meteorological data, with lung doses to the general popula-
tion varying by 147 in the Lemhi cases and by 32% in the Wet Mountains
results. _

In general, given the likelihood of complex local ajr flow patterns

over mountainous terrains such as are encountered at these study sites,
68

actual doses to individuals residing near operating facilities may be

greatly affected by local topography, orientation, and specific diurnal
wind regimes. Doses in this report are necessarily calculated without
access to such information and should be recalculated when data become

available.

Conclusions

This analysis of radiological impact suggests that maximum individual
dose commitmeats at 1 mile from the point of release should be similar
to those encountered in uranium operaiions. It was not possible to
make a direct comparison of this assessment of thorium mining and milling
with previous published assessments dealing with uranium ore. The
primary reason for this difficulty is that this analysis incorporated
different sets of meteorological data, site-specific population data,
and assumed a l-mile (vs 0.5 mile) distance to the facility boundary.
Also, no operational experience existed on which to base the development
of source terms. Therefore, use of conservative assumptions was required.

Doses to the maximally exposed individual at both sites were similar,
between 2 and 4 millirems to the total body, 9 to 13 millirems to bomne,
and 29 to 35 millirems to lungs. General population doses were estimated
to be highest for the Wet Mountains site, at 0.3 man-rem (total body),

0.9 man-rem (bone), and 3.7 man-rems (lungs). Doses calculated were
largely the result of ingestion and inhalation of 220Rn daughters for
both the maximum individual and general population cases. Significant
contributions to dose were also found for 228Ra, 232Th, and 228Th in order
of decreasing importance. Radon-220 and daughter doses to individuals
outside the 50-mile-radius study area were determined to be insignificant
when compared with natural background.

A distinct advantage of thorium mining and milling compared with
uranium mining and milling may be that the radiological hazard encountered
following plant shutdown is significantly lower and decreases rapidly
after shutdown. Because radioactivity residual in the thorium tailings
pile will be controlled primarily by the half-life of 2?8Ra (5.75 years),
the need for extensive maintenance (compared to uranium facilities) of mill

tailings for long periods after shutdown will be greatly reduced. In the
69

ALARA uranium mining and milling study,l it was concliuded that at the

New Mexico site, maximum doses to bone and total body at 0.5 mile from

an interim-treated (via chemical dust-reducing spray) tailings area

could be as high as 933 and 92 millirems respectively, using conservative
assumptions. The magnitude of these doses suggests that extensive final
treatment and long~term maintenance of a uranium tailings area might be
necessary. In comparison, in this study of thorium mining and milling,
the tailings pile (assumed treated by chemical spray) results in maximum
individual doses estimated at 6.8 millirems to lungs and 2.1 millirems

to total body for the Lemhi Pass site immediately after shutdown. Doses
are also estimated to be reduced with time fdllowing shutdown. Therefore,
it is concluded that postoperational handling of a thorium mine and mill
facility may be significantly less complex than for a uranium facility,
and that the radiological doses associated with the post-operational
thorium facility might be significantly less for a given level of tailings
pile treatment. It should be emphasized, however, that no difficulties
in meeting current or proposed radiological standards are anticipated |
for either type of facility, given application of appropriate, available

technologies.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

During the conduct of this analysis, it became apparent that some
of the technical data required for detailed radiological environmental
assessments of thorium wmining and milling were not available. In these
cases, appropriate data pertinent to uranium mining and milling were
often substituted and used in this work. 1In order for more refined
assessments of thorium mining and milling to be performed in the future,
data pertaining to the following areas are needed:

1. Quantitative measurement of emanation factors and diffusion
coefficients for 220Rn in thorium ore materials such as those found in
vein deposits.

2. Determination of fugitive dust generation rates and the dust
properties characteristic of mine activities and from exposed thorium
ore deposits and ore piles. The latter should include studies of wind~
blown dust from ore piles and involve quantitative descriptions of the
saltation behavior of the thorium ores, when appropriate.

3. Rates of release of 2?0Rn from thorium ore under various storage
conditions are required. Effects of water sprays and/or other treatments
in reducing dust and 220Rn releases from thorium ore storage piles should
also be determined.

4. Determination of the release rate of 220Rn from thorium ores is
required for such typical mill treatments as crushing, grinding, and
dissolution.

5. The concentrations and compositions of thorium decay products
in thorium mill waste liquors are required.

6. Specific properties of soils from the mountainous locations
where vein-type thorium ore deposits are located should be determined
to assess the soils' suitability for construction of tailings ponds,
controlling leakage of waste liquor from the pond, and reduction of

migration of radionuclides from the tailings waste liquor.

DIFFUSION EQUATION USED FOR THE ESTIMATION OF RADON-220 EMISSIONS
AZ-3

An equation developed by Culot and Schaiger (ref. 2, Sect. 4.3) was
used to estimate the “20Rn release from the open-pit mine, the ore pile,
and the tailings pile. This equation was also used in the ERDA-1541
(ref. 1, Sect. 4.3) study. This equation, which describes the steady-
state diffusion of radon from porous, uniform solids containing the

radium parent, is

- g fE _L
Jg = D tanh( - ) . (1)

where

Jo, = radon flux at the surface of the solids, Bq/m?-sec,

S = production rate of radon in a unit volume of the solid,
Bq/m3.sec,

k = effective diffusion coefficient of radon in the interparticle
void space, m?/sec,

p = void fraction: the fraction of total volume which is not
occupied by solid particles (this is often called porosity
and should not be confused with the porosity of an individual
particle),

A = radon decay constant, sec‘l,

L. = depth of the solids medium, m.

The term vk/Ap is called the relaxation length. If the depth, L, of the
so0lids is 22 or 3 relaxation legnths, then tanh L ') approaches 1,
i/ Ap

and radon flux from the solid surface is described by

J =8 vk/Ap . : (2)

O

In the present study the depth of the ore body, the ore storage pile, and
the tailings pile was sufficient to use Eq. (2).
A2-4

The production rate of radon, S, is calculated by the following

equation:

8§ = Cp Eo) , (3)
where

CRa = concentration of radium parent, Bq/kg,

E = emanation factor, dimensionless (this factor represents the
fraction of radon which escapes from the solids particles

and reaches interparticle void space),

o = bulk density of solids, kg/m3,

A = radon decay constant, sec” !l.

By combining Egqs. (2) and (3), Egq. (4) is obtained:

Jo = Cp Eor/2 (pmh)1/2 (4)

In all our estimates of “20Rrn release, we assumed that the emanation
factor, E, was the same for 220Rn (t1/2 = 55.6 sec) as it is for 222Rn
(3.30 x 10° sec). Values of E have not been measured for 220Rn. 1If the
release mechanism of 220Rn is primarily a vesult of recoil energy of
decay, this may be a good assumption. However, if the rate-controlling
process is governed by gaseous diffusion through the solid, along grain
boundaries, or from intraparticle porosity, the assumption would make our
estimates of 22URn release much too high. Reported values of E for *?ZRn
range from about 0.01 to 0.23. We used a value of 0.23 in all of our
calculations so that a conservative estimate was obtained. Clearly,
measurements of E values for 220Rn from thorium—-containing solids are
needed.

In calculating the radon flux from the mine, ore pile, and tailings,
the only wvalues which change for the different media are (kp"l)l/2 and p.

Therefore, we substituted £ = 0.23, Cry = 17.7 x 103 Bq/kg, and the value
AZ2-5

for A of 220Rn (0.0125/sec) in Eq. (4) and obtained Eq. (3), which was
utilized as the general equation for an estimation of 220Rn release from

thorium~containing solids:

3, = 4550 (k/p)1/2 (5)
Appendix 3

RADON-220 RELEASE FROM THE OPEN-PIT THORIUM MINE

A3-1
A3-3

The “?0Rn flux was estimated using Eq. (5) (Appendix 2) after
making the assumption that the in-place ore density was 2.25 x 103 kg/m3
and the value of k/p was identical with that of 2??Rn from the Ambrosia
Lake deposit (1.65 x 107°% m?/sec):

J, = 455 x 2,25 x 103+(1.65 x 1076)1/2 = 1,32 kBq/m?-sec .

Therefore, for the 1.21 x 10%m? (3-acre) mine surface the source

term ST is
ST = 1.32 x 1.21 x 10% = 16 MBq/sec .

The value of k/p of 222Rn from the Ambrosia Lake deposit was cal-
culated using Eq. (4) (Appendix 2) and the following values for the
constants in Eq. (5):

Observations made by PEDCO-Enviroomental Specialists, Inc.,* show the

where
E = dust emission in mg/vehicle-meter from dry rvoad,
s = vehicle speed, m/sec.

An equivalent vehicle speed of 8.9 m/sec (20 mph) was selected for the
mine vehicles, This is probably too high but is justified on the basis
that heavy equipment is operated at high engine speeds with an attendant

increase in dust from air blown by the engine cooling fan. Therefore,

E = 0.285 g/vehicle~meter (1.01 1b/vehicle-mile)

Dry Tailings

The radionculide concentrations of the tailings were computed from
ORIGEN code calculations of the quantity of thorium daughters remaining
after extraction of 1 g of thorium from an ore with a 91% extraction
efficiency (Table A.5.2). Removal of 1 g of thorium with an extraction
efficiency of 91% from the thorium ore (0.5% ThO,; 0.4397 Th) produces
about 250 g of tailings. This quantity is calculated as follows:

mass of tailings per g of Th = 1 + (0.91 X 4.39 x 1073) = 250 g .

The values for tailings listed in Table 4.3 (Sect. 4.2) were obtained by
multiplying the appropriate values listed in Table A.5.2 by the factor 4.
At discharge, of course, the daughter concentrations in the tailings are
equal to those of the original ore.

Note from Table A.5.2 that after about 100 years, the daughter
activity, originally associated with the separated thorium, has about
completely decayed. In comparison with uranium mill tailings, which
contain an 226Ra daughter (t1/p = 1622 years), this is a relatively short

time.
Appendix 6

MODEL TAILINGS IMPOUNDMENT

Ab-1
A6-3

The model used for impoundment of the tailings is a natural wedge-
shaped basin (Fig. A.6.1). The upstream face of the dam slopes 27°
(about 2:1) with the horizontal. The walls of the basin are assumed to
be perpendicular to triangle ABD in Fig. A.6.1. The tailings surface
slopes downward 1° with the horizontal along line AC, and the bottom of
the basin slopes upward 1° from the upstream face of the dam along line

BD. The length of dam, d_ , necessary to contain a given volume of

>
tailings at a fixed dam hiight, dy, can readily be calculated from the
triangular area of the tailings represented by triangle ACD. In this
study we choose to let the maximum value of dj be 30.5 m (100 ft). The
cross-sectional area of the tailings (triangle ACD) can easily be cal-
culated in terms of dj, using a Hewlett-Packard model HP-67 programmable
calculator and the Triangles Program Card (Standard Pac SD-07-07).
Relationships of the triangular areas to d, and the relationships of

dy, to the various sides of the triangles used to calculate the surface
areas of the tailings and the pond, are given in Table A.6.1. The
calculated value of dy required to contain the 20-year accumulation of
tailings (5.86E6 m?®; 207E8 ft3) is 441 m (1450 ft). 1In this study the

evaporation rates of water from the pond were sufficiently high to permit

the dy and dy values for containment of the tailings to also be sufficient
to contain all of the pond liquor. Since this calculation is only approx-
imate, no contingency was allowed for abnormal weather conditions.

Once the values of dj and d; have been determined for containment
of the 20-year accumulation of tailings, it is a relatively simple matter
to calculate the surface area of the tailings. The surface area, A,
presented by the rectangular top of the tailings pile is proportional to

the one-half power of the volume of tailings, V., in the impoundment

basin:

AL =k, V2 (1)
where

ky, = a constant that is calculated from the geometric constants

in Table A.6.1.

A sample calculation of k, is as follows:

V. = 14.306d,°dy , (2)
A= de - (AC) , (3)
AC = 29.631dy, . (&)
A6~5

Combining Eqs. (2), (3), and (4), Eq. (5) is obtained:

A_ = 1.645 x 102 v 1/2, (5)
Therefore, k, is equal to 1.645 X 102 m}/2., Since there is a fixed
addition rate of tailings (9.29 x 10-3 m3/sec), Eq. (5) is more useful

if time is substituted for Vt in Eq. (5):

A_ = 8.906 x 10* g1/2 (6)

where the units of A, are m? and those of t are years.

The calculated values of A, at yearly intervals of the 20~year mill
operation are given in Table A.6.2. The value of AC is also listed,
since it is used in Appendix 7 to calculate the area of tailings

covered by pond liquor.

CALCULATION OF AREAS FOR DRY TAILINGS BEACH AND POND DURING
THE 20-YEAR OPERATION OF THE MILL

A7-1
A7~3

Calculation of the volume of the pond and its surface area as a
function time is more complicated than is the same calculation for the
tailings, by virtue of the fact that the water is continuously lost by
evaporation at a variable rate until the volume becomes constant at
steady state. An equation for calculating the volume of the pond as a
function of time was derived with the assistance of H. W. Godbee of
ORNL. The calculated volume in tura could be used to calculate the
surface area of the pond. We assumed no loss from the pond by seepage.

The derivation is as follows:

Let
I = input of liquid to the pond,
0 = output of liquid from the pond by evaporation,
de = change in volume of pond:

then
1 -0 = de . (1)

Because there is a fixed rate of addition of liquid to the pond, R,

the increase of I with time is described by Eq. (2):
1 = Rdt . (2)

triangular wedge is given by

where

After combining the two constants, Eq. (5) is obtained:

0 = RV,? . (5)
By substituting for I and 0 in Eq. (1), Eq. (6) is obtained:

Rdt - KV,1/? dt = avy . (6)

Integration of Eq. (6) yielded Eq. (7), which was named the Bond-Godbee

equation:

_ 2R . R 2. 31/2 2R R Ko/ \
t 2 1n 5 % Vp 2 1n (2 > Vp . (7)

It is relatively easy to solve this equation by "trial and error,"
using a programmable caleculator such as the Hewlett-Packard model HP-67.
Programs were written to evaluate Vp at time t and for the value of R
necessary to yield a given value of Vp at time t. Note that the Bond-
GCodbee equation is only valid for volumes of VP less than that at steady

state. The steady-state volume is given by Eq. (8):
(Vp) steady state = K% K=? (8)

Values of k,, K, and the calculated value of Vp at steady state are given
in Table A.7.1 for the water addition rate (1.94 x 1072 m3/sec) to the

model tailings impoundments. The calculated rate of addition of water to
keep the tailings completely covered during the 20~year operation of the

mill is given in Table A.7.2. For the evaporation rate of 1.93 x 1078 m/sec

(2 ft/year), a 10% increase in the flow rate (obtained by adding water
to the mill discharge) would keep the tailings covered over the 20-year
operation. However, at an evaporation rate of 2.90 x 1078 m/sec

(3 ft/year) an increase in flow rate of about 407 would be required.

Calculated values of the pond volume at yearly intervals are shown in

Table A.7.3 for the model pond at the Montana and Colorado sites, where
the respective evaporation rates are 1.93 x 107% and 2.90 x 1078 m/sec.
At an evaporation rate of 1.93 x 10~% m/sec, the pond volume after

20 years reaches about 557 of its potential steady-state value; whereas

at 2.90 x 10~% m/sec, it reaches about 80%. From the geometric relation-

ships (Table A.6.1, Appendix 6) and the pond volumes (Table A.7.3), values

of the area of exposed tailings, the area of tailings covered by the
pond liquor, and the total surface area of the pond were calculated.

Results of these calculations are shown in Tables A.7.4 and A.7.5.

EVAPORATION OF THE TAILINGS POND AFTER MILL CLOSING AND EXPOSURE
OF DRY TAILINGS SURFACE

A8-1
A8-3

The equation used to calculate the evaporation area of the pond as
a function of time was obtained by integrating Eq. (6), Appendix 7, with

a water input rate of zero (i.e., R = (Q):

thl/2 = vpill2 - 2Kt , (1)

Vpi = volume of liquid in the pond at mill closing, m3,

Vpr = volume of liquid after evaporation time t, m3,

K = evaporation constant, m3/2/sec (values for Colorado and Montana

sites previously given in Table A.7.1, Appendix 7),

t = time, sec.

Volumes of the ponds at the two locations as a function of elapsed
time are given in Table A.8.1. From these volumes, values of the areas
of the dry beach and of the pond were calculated by the same method used

in Appendix 7. The values obtained were listed in Table 4.5 (Sect. 4.2).

RADON-220 FLUX FROM THE DRY TAILINGS AND FROM THE POND SURFACE

A9~1
A9-3
Dry Tailings Surface

The 220Rn flux from the dry tailings surface during mill operations

was calculated using Eq. (5) from Appendix 2 as follows:

Jo = 445p(kp—1)1/2 ,
Jo = 455 x 1.64 x 103 x 103 x (5 x 1078)1/2 |
Jo = 1.67 kBq/m? » sec (or 4.51 x 10" pCi/m? « sec) .

1

The following values of p and kp ' were utilized:

1.64 x 10° kg/m3 ,

P

kp~! = 5 x 107¢ m?/sec

These values were utilized by previous investigators (ref. 4, Sect. 4.2.8)
as being applicable to uranium mill tailings.

A factor of 0.6 was applied for decay of 224pa in calculating the
flux after shutdown of the mill. This factor was determined from a

graphical plot of the data listed in Table A.5.2, Appendix 5.
Surface of Pond

It was assumed that radium daughters of the thorium decay chain had
the same solubility as that observed in the pond liquor of a uranium mill.

Using Eq. (4), Appendix 2, the source term is as follows:

i

J 5.14 x 10% x 103 x (0.0125)1/2 (1.13 x 107%)1/2 |

O

Jo = 19.3 Bq/m? « sec (or 522 pCi/m? + sec)
The following values for Cgg of 224Ra, p, and kp~! were utilized:

Cra = 5-14 x 103 Bq/kg of 22%Ra ,

1 x 103 kg/m3 ,

This calculation probably yields a source term that is optimistically
low. The action of the prevailing wind on the surface of the pond would
cause mixing of the upper liquid layer and hence enhance diffusion of the
220Rn, However, we were unable to locate a model in the literature which

took such a mixing process into account.
