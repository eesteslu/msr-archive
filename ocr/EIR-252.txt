Thorium, Uranium, other Metals and
Materials from Earth’'s Crust Rocks

M. Taube

Wiirenlingen, April 1974
Abstract

The general use of the rocks of the earth's c¢rust as a source
of nuclear energy (from thorium-uranium extracted with 30%
efficiency), and a source of metals {aluminium, iron ete.),

a source of ceramics {cement, glass, quartz) and other ma-
terials is discussed. The proposal is to use their source

to meet the needs of a future stable civilization requiring a
unit power production of some 20 kw per capita and source
material supply of 1 tonne per capita per year (additional to
recycling). The impact of this on the philosophy a reactor

development is also discussed.

I. General Iemargs

The aim of thie paper is to cubline and discuss the poasible
future sources and flows of energy in the next 50 to 200
vears, in the world as a whole, and more especlially in
Switzerland. It iz a conbinustion of the well known ides

of &, Weinberg of rooks burningt,

It can be debated that any numerical or guantitative evalu~
ations on these toplcs have 1little value at the present {ime,
but the author iz of the firm opinion that such an evalu=
ation could have an impact on the philoesophy of reactor deve-

lopment especislly in the gqualitative cholice of reactor type.

Since it seems to take some 20 years from paper studies o
full reactor operations {of a new type} and a further 30-HQ
years of 1ife, then the minimur tinme scale we ghould congi-

der i3 of the ordey of 50 yvears.

II. ¥World energy development, and the csse of Switzerland

It is well known thabt the number of prognoses for the future
development of cur civilization is egual to the number of
papers on the subject. Here the following sssumptions have

been made,

1. The world population increases conbinuously to 9=-10 x 109

people after 200 yvears and then reducss bto a 5tabla level
of 8 x 109 pecple {(for Switzerland - today & x lﬂﬁ pecple,

in the next 50 years 8 x 106 and then stablilization},.
The

The abundance of available energy sources is the mogst

important factor in the development of any civilization.

The regeneration of the natural environment is one of
the most important factors in considering the transfor-

mation of matter into energy.

Qur civilization achieves a steady state level in approx
200-250 years and this level will have the following

characteristics

- production of fresh materials (from ores ete.) would

be a factor 2-3 times lower than at present.
- recycling will, therefore, be greatly increased.

- the spectrum of material use will be drastically
altered.

- the free energy available for these needs will be

increased per capita mean by approx 10 times.

OF course the development of other energy sources will change
and may dramatically after the assumptions given above, bub

fig. & makes the arbitrary assumptions clear.

Here the asswuption of fission energy covers approx 173 of
all ensrgy needs and thus the dateg given above are too big

onliy by & factor 3 in the worst case.

I1T. Uranium=-Thorium sources in ores, granites and the sarbth's

crust

The most ilmportant assumption made here is that the Pission
enargy is the main scurce of free energy not only in the nsxt
century but alsc in later periods. AL present uranium is pe~

covered from bthe following ores.,
USA ores 1800 ppM
Canada ores 1100 ppM
South Africa ores 250 ppM
Other West Hemisphere ores 1940 ppM
Mean for West Hemisphere 820 ppM

It must be stressed that at the present time the "uranium
ores™ have a commercial value of approx. 203% per kg of USOB

even if the uranium contents equals only 250 ppM!

But as is well known the mean distribution of uranium and
thorium in the earths crust is approximatly 12 ppM for hoth
elements. The proportion of these fissicnable elements is
higher in the granites (typical continental rocks) and
reaches 50 ppM. In the basalts (typical oceanic rocks) it
is lower at about 1 ppM (see fig. 3).

Of course in the continental rocks there are some signifi-
cant accumulations of uranium and to save extent thorium. The
probable amounts of high and low grade ores are given in fig.

Y (rough estimates).

IV. Resources of other elements

An underlying feature of the arguments developed in this paper
is that the extraction of the fissionable nuclides U and Th
from the rocks of the earth's erust must be coupled with the
extraction of all the utilizable elements from these cources,
which must decrease the cost of the recovery of all appro-

priate elements,

In table 1 are given the sbundance of chemical 2lements in
the sarthts crust. OFf course there is some disagreement aboutb
tnis data in different referencez bub for our purposes the

influence of these uyncertainties is not great.

Fig. % shows the distribution of the most sbundant elements
{in the earth’s crust) versus the slectronegativity accor-

dication conecerning the thermodynamie stability of the possib-

We abttempt here to discuss the technical and energetical
fegtures of the industrisgl extractions of these components

of £he rocks in the fubure.

We can make a very simplified caleulation based on the

following:

Take first 1 ton of each of the today's commercially impor-
tant ores larbitrarily chozen) providing the following eleven

matals
Fe, 41, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, 3o, Ag, 8&u, b
totalling 11 ftons of ores.

Commercial ores today contain approx the following amountis

of metal

The total amount of metals produced from the 11 tons of ores
is approx 1078 kg. The mean value of the commercial ores 1s

The earth’'s crust contains the elements listed 1n table 2
among others. The total amount of metal there is 130 kg in
1000 kg or 13 weight §. Thus the earth's crust taken as a
wheole has the same approximately total content of metals as
a mean mixture of commercial ores, if the ratios of metals

could be changed in an appropriate way.

From fig. 6 it can be seen that the ratio of metal concen-
tration in commercial ores varies from less than 10 (e.g.
Fe, A1) to more than 1000 {Pb, Mo, Ta, Sn, Ag, Au, Hg, Sh)

{Note: based on the very low, but still commercial uranium

ores from South Africa).

A rather important conclusion can be drawn from fig., 7. We
have arbitrarily assumed that the most metal ~ iron is
extracted from the earth in a "resonable"” way - that is pro-
protioned to its abundance in the earth crust by assuming
the ratio

Then we classify the other metals in the following classes:

- metals being extracted more or much more than the ‘*natural

ratio!' e.g. Pb, Sn, Ag, Au, Cd, Hg, W, Zn

~ metals being eXtracted in the right proportion
Fe (reference) Mn, Cr and U (when taken together with

Thorium)

- metals being extracted at a too low rate
Al (the most important!)
Mg, Ti, Zr, Mg, Co.

From this we might draw the following coneclusion: if we are
to operate a technology of metals use without waste or with
the minimum of waste than the ratio of the extracted metals
should be in accordance with the ratio existing in the earth's
crust. Of course such an alteration in the relative and ab-
solute amounts of extracted metals will have a vital impact

on the technology.

V. Energy Balance for element extraction from the earth's crust

The jump from using the classical ores to the use of the
earth's crust generally as a source of material clearly
means an increase of free energy needed for element (or

compound) extraction.
18

Questions to be answered

- are the potential energy sources large enough to meet

this increased demand?

-~ is the increase in energy consumption a fair price to
pay and a positive solution from the point of view of

environmental policy?

The first of these gquestions is discussed here. The second

ig discussed elsewhere,

As can be seen from table 3, from 1 ton of rock with a

mean elementary abundance for complete extraction and trans-
formation of all components to free elements requires, if a
electrolysis in molten salt media (e.g. chloride) is postu-
lated.

- theoretically (100% efficieney) = 11 Gigajoules (GJ)

)

- practically (20% efficiency) 55 @J

{Remark: part of this energy in form of electrical energy,

and part of heat)

For processing 1 ton of rock per capita per year the free

energy requirement almost equals

55 GJd/year
5'15x10? s/year

= 1700 watts/capita

Considering the contents of 1 ton of earth's crust from the
point of view of the possible free energy carried (see table

cussed here for the reasons given in chapter 1.)

We assume for the U + Th extraction efficiency a figure of
0.30 (but there no limitation for e.g. a two or three times

higher effieciency) which gives:

(1 ton earth's crust rocks per year and capita)

12 g/ton x 0.30 x 8.6 x 10°° J/g U,Th .

With these assumptions we arrive at the following coneclusions:

Processing of 1 ton per capita/per year of 'earth's crust
rock' regquires 1.7 kW (tot) even with only 30% extraction effi-
ciency of thorium, uranium produces power of 11 ky or 6.5

times more.
21

The zame calculation for granites {1 ton per year per caplital
gives an power of 41 kw per capita which is 24 times mors
than i3 needed for the extraction of the metals, or in other
words about H.1% of the energy avallable i3 used for mineral
extraction. In the URBA at the present time the raw matsrial
praduction requires 5.6% and electreolysis 1.1% making a total
of 6.7% of the total energy consumpbilon.

VI. Size of present and future material flows

One of the future aims of environmental protection among
others will be without doubt the reduction in the amount
of materials extracted from natural deposits per capita.

We include here the waste together with the main products.

The present state of material flows seems to be far from
the optimal (or rather far from a reasonable minimum). The
material flow per capita per year is approx 4 tons without
taking into account the large amounts of spoill {open cast
mining ete.) moved, loss of agricultural land and disposal

off wastes,.

VII. Earth's crust rocks as an energy material source

To some extent the achievement of using rocks as a source of
fissionable nuclides (or fissionable nuclides) depend on the
ability to produce metal and ceramic¢ materials as by-pro-

ducts of the process.

In table 5 is given a very simplified and approximate divi-
sion of the earth's crust material for the preoduction of some

materials.

VIII TImpact on the philosophy of reactor development

From all these developments we can suggest the following as

that which might result in the development of reactor technology.

- the breeder reactors, both with Unat/Pu-239 and Th/U-233
fuel ecycles could provide a total energy production of

approximately 10,000,000 TW years.

that is a 160 TW civilization (8 Gigapeople with 20 kw/capita)
for about one hundred thousand years even when one ten thoudandth

part of the rocks will be burned.
27

- the breeder must in the future use both uranium and
thorium and, therefore, probably both fast and thermal
breeders are of interest {(fig. 9, 10).

- the impact of the extraction of U + Th from the earth's crust

rocks is small (see table 7).

- the use of the rocks for U + Th extraction must be coupled

with the complex recovery of other materials, metals etc.

- the power production could be totally independant from the
suppliers of 'energy carriers' (no monopoly of energy

sources),

- the large amount of radicactive waste (fission)} need not be
stored but rather burned up in a high neutron flux reactor,

or an accelerator.

- the cost of all these additional processes will be signi-

ficant but not crucial.

If the so called ‘environmental taxes' (or entropy taxes) pro-
posed for the future come into effect then the penalty of these

new processes will be small and even negative (a profit).

The uranium cost for plutonium synthesis

1 kg U - ~1 kg Pu

If the cost of U production rises from 203% to 1000 $/kg the
contribution in the plutonium price will be approx 10%,
necause:

1Y U price: 20%/kg + 10.000 $/kg Pu

2y U price: 1000 $/kg + 11.000 $/kg Pu

The element of plutonium cost in the electrical energy cost
will change from 1 mills/KWhr to 1.1 mills/EWhr, so that

in the total electrical KWh cost will change from 12 mills
to 12,1 mills that is in the order of 0.84%.
