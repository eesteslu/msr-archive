TEMPERATURE AND REACTIVITY COEFFICIENT AVERAGING IN THE MSRE

B. E. Prince and J. R. Engel

MAST

ABSTRACT

Use is made of the concept of 'nuclear average temperature"” to re-
late the spatial temperature profiles in fuel and graphite attained during
‘ high power operation of the MSRE to the neutron multiplication constant.
Ty Based on two-group perturbation theory, temperature weighting functions
. for fuel and graphite are derived, from which the muclear aversge tempera-

tures may be calculated. Similarly, importance-averaged temperature co-
efficients of reactivity are defined. The values of the coefficients cal-
culated for the MSRE were -4.b x 10"2/°F for the fuel and -7.3 x 10=D for
the graphite. These values refer to & reactor fueled with salt which does
not contain thorium. They were sbout 5% larger than the values obtained
from a one-region, homogeneous reactor model, thus reflecting the varia-
tion in the fuel volume fraction throughout the reactor and the effect of
the control rod thimbles on the flux profiles.

INTRODUCTION

Prediction of the temperature kinetic behavior and the control rod
requirements in operating the MSRE at full power requires knowledge of
the reactivity effect of nonuniform temperature differences in fuel and
graphite throughout the core. Since detailed studies have recently been
made of the core physics characteristics at isothermal (1200°F) conditions,l
perturbation theory provides a convenient approach to this problem. Here,
the perturbation is the change in fael and graphite temperature profiles
from the iscthermal values. In the following section the ahalytical
method is presented. Specific calculations for the MSRE are discussed
in the final section of this report.

ANALYSIS

The mathematical problem considered in this section is that of
describing the temperature reactivity feedback associated with changes
in reactor power by use of average fuel and graphite temperatures rathe:
than the complete temperature distributions. The proper averages are
derived by considering spatially uniform temperatures which give the same
reactivity effect as the actual profiles. The reactivity is given by the

following first-order perturbation formula:3

o= o T ()

Equation 1 relates a small change in the effective multiplication con-
stant k.e to a perturbation 6M in the coefficient matrix of the two-group
equations. The formulation of the two-group equations which defines the

terms in (1) is:

Temperature Aversging

Starting with the critical, isothermal resactor (ke =1, T = TO),
consider the effects on the neutron multiplication constant of changing
the fuel and graphite temperatures to Tf(r,z) and. Té(r,z). These effects
may be treated as separate perturbations as long as 6k/k produced by each
change is small. Consider first the fuel. As the temperature shifts firom
v, to Tf(r,z), with the graphite temperature held constant, the reactivity

fo
chenge is:

*
ok _ [®, oM(T, ~T,) ] (s)
pf = Xk - 5

- *
Tpo = Tf(r,z) [, Fb]

 

If the nuclear coefficients comprising the matrix M do not vary rapidly
with temperature, OM can be adequately approximated by the first term

in an expsnsion about T, , i.e.,

6M(Tfo - Tf) - m(Tfo) (T:E‘ - Tfo) (6)

Tn equation (6), m is the coefficient matrix:

Thus:
*
ok ['1) ’ m(TfO ) (Tf - TfO ) (I’]
o - - . (8)
Now, consider a second situation in which the fuel temperature is changed

*
from Tfo to Tf uniformly over the core. The reactivity change is:

& oM(T,_ - Tf*) 5]

temperature which gives rise to the same reactivity change as the actual

temperature profile in the core, i.=.;

product in the left hand side of (1d):

In an analogous fashior, the naclear average temperature for the
graphite is defined by:

It may be seen from the preceding analysis that the problem of ob=- —
taining nuclear average temperstures is reducible to the calculation of
the weighting function contained in the scalar product:

where the derivatives are taken with respect to the fuel or graphite

temperatures in order to obtain Gf

venient for numericel evaluation to rewrite the derivatives in loga-

or Gg’ respectively. It is con-

+ B(5,) { z, ¢2* ¢2} (Thermal Abs. )

+ p(D,) {¢2* (-D?_v2 ¢2)} (Thermal Leakage) (21)

To evaluate the leakage terms in (21), a further simplification is ob-
tained by using the criticality relations for the unperturbed fluxes:

- D, 7" o= ~Zp Pt In g (22)
-Dlvzpjl: —ZRl¢l—2al¢l+vZﬂ¢l+vZf2¢2 (23)

Incerting the above relations into (21) end regrouping tems results in:

APPLICATION TO THE MSRE: RESULTS

Utilizing a calcuwlational model in which the reactor composition was
assumed uniform, Nestor obtained values for the fuel and graphite tempera-
ture coefficients.u The purpose of the present study was to account for
the spatial variations in temperature and composition in a more exact
fashion. In this connection, two-group, 19-region calculations of fluxes
and adjoint fluxes have recently been made for the MSRE,l using the
Equipoise-3A 253 program. These studies refer to fuel salt which con-
tains no thorium. The geometric model representing the reactor core
configuration is indicdted in Fig. 1. Average compositions of each
region in this figure are given in Table 1.

The resulting flux distributions, which are the basic data required
for calculation of the temperature weighting funetions, are given in
Figs. 2 and 3. These figures represent axial and radial traverses, along
lines which intersect in the regior J of Fig. 1. The intersection point
occurs close to the point R =7 in., Z = 35 in. of the grid of Fig. 1,
and corresponds to the position of maximum thermal flux in the reactor.

arithmic derivatives

In the above expression, the thermal cross section of the salt was sepa-
rated into components; one was U235 and the other was the remaining salt
constituents (labeled s). This was done because of the non-l/v behavior
of the U235 cross sectlon.

Evaluation of the temperature derivatives of the thermal cross sec=
tions gives rise to the question of the relationship between the neutron
temperature Tn and the fuel and graphite temperatures, Tf and Té. As
seen from Table 1, except for the oubter regions of the core, graphite
comprises about 75 to 77 per cent of the core volume. TFollowing Nestor's
calculations, it was assumed that within these regions the neutron tem-
perature was equal to the graphite temperature. These regions comprise
the major part of the core volume (Table 1). For those external regions
with fuel volume fractions greater than 50% (an arbitrarily chosen di-
viding point), the neutron temperatuvre was assumed equal to the bulk

temperature; i.e.,
17

reactor approximation, sin2 g-(z + zo) may be used to represent the weight
function.

Temperature coefficients of reactivity consistent with these weighting
functions were calculated from Eq. 17. These values are listed in Table 2,
along with the coefficients obtained from the uniform reactor model as used
for the calculations reported in reference (4). In the latter case, a uni-
form fuel volume fraction of 0.225 was used; i.e., that of the largest
region in the reactor. Also, the effective radius and height of the re-
actor were chosen as closely as possible to correspond to the points where
the Equipoise thermal fluxes extrapoclate to gero from the active core.

APPLICATION TO THE MSRE -~ DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The relative importance of temperature changes on the reactivity
varies from region to region in the reactor due to two effects. One is
the change in the nuclear importance, as measured by the adjoint fluxes.
The other is the variation in the local infinite multiplicetion constant
as the fuel~-graphite-Inor 8 composition varies. The latter effect leads
to the discontinuities in the temperature weighting function. For ex-
ample, region O of Fig. 1 contains a relatively large volume fraction of
Inor 8 (see Table 1). This results in net subecriticality of this region
in the absence of the net inleakage of neutrons from the surrounding
regions. Thus the reactivity effect of a temperature increment in this
region has the opposite sign from that of the surrocundings.

It should be understood that the validity of the perturbation caicu-
lations in representing the local temperature-reactivity effects depends
upon how accurately the original flux distributions and average region
compositions represent the nuclear behavior of the reactor. Also, it
was necessary to assume a specific relation between the local neutron
temperature and the local fuel and graphite temperatures. More exact
calculations would account for a continuous change in thermal spectrum
as the average fuel volume fraction changes. This would have the effect
of "rounding off" the discontinuities in the temperature weighting func-
tions., These effects, however should be relstively minor and the re-
sults presented herein should be a reasonably good approximation.

Nuclear aversge temperabures hsve been calculated from computed
MSRE temperature distributions, usirg the weighting functions given in
