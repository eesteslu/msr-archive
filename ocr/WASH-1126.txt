The widespread and mccntrat“’ efforts being devoted on a national
and international basis to do%dop a breedsr reactor clearly evidences
man's intense desire to free himself from limited and costly energy
sources. The introduction of the dreeder resctor into the utility
market will provide virtually unlimited energy which can bde used to
elevate the standard of livin:? and, with proper attention, improve

man's enviromment,

The basic importance of major sustained commitments of managerial and
financial resources by covornp;ont_. private irdustry and the utilities
to the overall success o!’th.;brtodor program cannot be over-emphasized.
Experience in the devclopuontémd application of civilian nuclear power
reactors has estadblished that such commitments are essential to bring
into being the technologies, t%'uunch and development facilities,
trained personnel, components, systems, and production facilittes
necessary to assure the ouccoéntul introduction of the bdreeder into

the commercial market. In vlﬁ of the sudstantial invastment of the
nation's resources that the é#volopntnt of the Dreeder entails, it
seems highly appropriste that in uhiu the decision to proceed with
this program, estimated costs b. unaaured asgainst the denefits expected

to derive from the investment.,

In recognition of the desirability of detter dafining the commitments
and benefits implicit {n the bdreeder development program, the 1. S.

model utilized in this iqainin is in an early stage of development

and {s deing continually tnrmd to better simulate the c!nuctoﬂotiu
of the nation's power oconoieny. |

The benefits considered in ftho calculations are those that are clearly
quantifiadle and take the %om of low-cost electrical energy, reductions
in uranium ore roqultmnu: and in uparnt.tn work demand, {ncrease in
plutonium production, and ufn of uranium tailings. Also, the report
makes veference to other benefits of msjor importance which are not
quantifiadle, at least not at the present time. Such benefits include
those associated with rodm;um of air pollution and with new uses for |
low cost electricity and M}t such as large scale desalting of sea water.
Weighed against the quantifiadle denefits are the costas expected to de
incurred by the Covermment in the d.viloput of the dreeder. This
spproach appears uumhlo_ in view of the fact that the coatinuing
progran of systems mlyal;. vhich provides input for studies of this
nature, has as {ts major objecttn the deternination of the GCovernmeat's

future role in advanced ru:ctor development.

Division of the Manhattan District Matallurgical Ladorstory. The program
has deen continuous since that time, and the momentum now has duilt up

to the point vhere the large-scale introduction and commercisl scceptance
of the dreeder will de hut}lo in the near future. Appendix A presents
some of the more significant reviews and statements that have been made
over ths years on the mtionéal importance and potential of the dreeder

progran,

Mach of the essential effort on the dreeder was conducted in the AIC
national ladoratories. The Clementine reactor was coastructed at

Los Alanos and used from lhrgb 1949 to December 1952 to demonstrate the

TR IR A PN St £t anens s o emeaen

feasidility of operating with fast neutrons, plutonium fuel and a liquid
metal coolant. The Expsrimental Breeder Reactor I (EER-1) was duilt
and cperated by Argonns National Laboratory from August 1951 through

spectrum Teactor, cuhiuuu {n the coanstruction of two fast resctors
in the mid 1930%s, the 62.} Mt EBR-11 snd the 200 Mit Permi reactor.

Several factors mitigated mmt fsmediate success in terme of the
commercisl exploitation o!;tho breeder resctor: the development effort was
focused largaly on technological goals: the industrial izvolvement wes ain-
imal; and the Dreeder dmlbp-nt participation was essentially coanfined

to the national laboratories, with the exception of the Permi developmeat
effort. The industrial m concentrated on the light water reactors

and the nuclear lcvy.vbou:m«n vas nearer at hand. The 'prom

uranium resources mur«llm!nctnt to meet predicted requirements.
Though a relatively large goehnologicn base, including test facilities,
vas being developed in the laboratories, the dreeder effort was diffuse

in terma of an engineering type of undertaking. In genersl, until the
nid-1960's, there appeared to be 00 urgent requirement to concentrate

the industrial resources on the breeder program.

In 1962, the AZC issued its h&port to the President on Civilisn Nuclear
Pover. This report clearly ;t-anphallsed that the use of dreeders
could solve the prodles of an adequate ind economic energy supply for
the future. The report coucindod that nuclear energy can and should
aske sn important and mntufally: 8 vital contridution toward uweseting
our long term energy rtquire;.uto. and that econocmic bdreeders were
essential to the long range major hao of nuclear energy. The report
included & detailed discussion of the place to de occupied by the

breeders in the ov.rill program.

Faced with the question of d;torndnins the future course to be taken

by the U, $. advanced roacto; development programs, the AEC, in early
1965, initiated » series of ?vnrnll technical reviews. These reviews

of the reactor program indicated a lack of important engineering
information, and an 1nadoquaci of facilities and other resources necessary
to obtain that information ithcrt vas clear evidence of the need to
build up the engineering cap;htllttos in the ladboratories and {n i{ndustry
and to aspemble necessary an@ adequate resources to develop and produce

safe, reliadle and ocononicnl dbreeder power plants for operation in the

vtility enviromment. These early overall reviews further indicated a
requirement for in-depth reviews of each of the technical elements of
the dreeder program. Concurrently, it was necessary to initiate detailed

plans for each of the elements of the dreeder prograa.
 

 

 

mrm:usm«l reusrkable advances were taking place in the
development o! n;m: water resctor power plants. As a result,
mlmnmmd tmﬁ.ﬁd«woﬁmmmuamm
of electricsl cwu The resultsnt unprecedented demand for light
vator power resctor plants, mauolod by grestly incressed uranium
demands snd Yy projected large-scale plutonium production, provided
sdditional incentives for a move direct and concentrated effort on &
vaified dreeder development progrea than hitherto schieved. It was
recognized that the plutonium produced in light water resctors

could de most efficiently used in the fast bdreeder reactors sand that
the breeder would measuredly reduce uranium ore requirements. The
breeder development pto&n wvas thus invested with a sense of urgency
which had deen lacking up to then.

In early 1967, the Ato_-ic Pnargy Comnisetion fssued the 1967 Supplement
to the 1962 Report to the President oa Civilisn Wuclesr Fower. The
Supplement set forth the changes that had occurred simce 1962, and
considered the ongoing AIC reactor programs im relation to the
recozmendations of the 1962 veport. The Supplement resffirmed the
promise of the dreesder for meeting our long term energy needs snd
sstadlished the LMFBR program as the highest priority civiliasn resctor
development effort vhich would lesd to full commercisl scceptance of
the Dreeder. Ths continuing AEC role of leadership was reviewed
relative to the development of nuclesr technology required to sssure

snd utility cspadility requisite to the succeasful introduction of
the LR and the timely development and commsercial utilisstiocn of the
fast breeders, in putfcularly the LMFER, vere discussed.

In view of the utobuqh«l'unt priority, tha level of activity cn
the LXFER wae cmtdou;bly increased in Fiscal Years 1967, 1968 and
1969. The duildup to bring together the required resocurces, including
msnpover, fscilities, and funds has continued within the AEC, the ARC
laboratories, snd in other sectors of the nuclesr community. New
major test facilities én under construction snd other existing
facilities are dDeing upgraded. Encoursged dy the increased attention
snd efforts of the Covernment, substantial commitments have been nsde
by the major reactor nénutacturor- and the utilities with & view to
naking large-scale c@ltmto to the first LMFBR demonstration plants
in the 1970%s. Thn?o tn§ootnaati are in addition to the heavy LWR

commitnents.

In recognition of the importance of the fast dreeder, the Edison
Electric Institute (ui). sn association of the private utilities,
conducted a detailed study of the status of fast dreeder reactor
development. Their report was pudlished in April 1969. In the
Foreword of this report, the situation was stated as follows:

“1he Subcommittee (EE1) on Fast Breeder Reactor Development

The LMFBR Program Office at the Argonne Mational Ladoratory has prepared
¥R Program Plans#, under the direction of the AXC, vhich have recently
been relesased. The Program Plans are national in scope and represent
the results of many mthni of discussions, reviews, and assessuents
withia the nuclear cmiiy. The Plans represent a major sdvance in
the LMFBR program by uttfu forth in a comprehensive manner those
courses of action w«ufy for achieving the o&}utim of the LYOFBR

Three major quantifisble conclusions from the snalysis are:

1. The breeder can produce not ocnly large direct mooey benafits from
the low cost of electrical energy, but also other tangible quantitative
beneiits, such as those a,oochtod vith reduced uranium requirements,
reduced uranium separative work requirements, and the large productiocn

of plutonium.

2. The benefit/cost ratio is significantly greater thsn cne for wmost of
the cases having & discount rate of 7% or less. The denefit to coat ratios

fall delow 1, for @ Mt of cases dased on discount rates adbove 7%.

3. Deferring the presently planned LMFER R&D progran with consequent
delays in the introduction date does uot substantially reduce the
present worth of the R&D expenditures. 1In all cases, deferring the

LMFBR R&D program incresses the undiscounted R&D costs.

&.

The increased dollar benefits from reduced costs of electrical energy
alone, resulting from the early introduction of the breeder, provide
a major incentive for a timely and strong research and development

progrem, and even make & strong point for its acceleraticn.

Although an incresse in uranium ore costs is highly prodable, even &
constant U40g cost ($8/1d), with constant fossil fuel costs, and with
an early introduction of the LMFBR, provides mbotandu benefits for
discount rates delow 7%, and sudbstantial danefits for a 1980 Introduction

at 7% discount rate.

Early introduction of the dreeder substantially reduces future uranium

The benefits nccrutns from tho introduction of the breeder are affected
by changes in fouil fuel costs. These benefits would be increased
significantly if increases in foaeil fuel costs are experienced.

Small changes in the cost of electrical energy from the breeder
cause significant changes in the benefits, with capital coets
being more important in this regard than fuel cycle costs.

In all cases considered vwith dreedsr introduction, thes nuclear
generating capacity by year 2020 represents an extremsly large
percentage of the total electrical generating capacity available

for competition between fossil fusled and nuclear fueled power plants.

Discount rates substantially above 7% seriously affect dollar benefits
because of low present worth in 1970 of large undiscounted gross
bdenefits for the latter part of the 50 year period as compared

vith the high present worth in 1970 of RSD sxpenditures in the

breeder progran. Dased eﬁn 7R discount rate, the discounted
weeder RED costs vary m-b.z di1lion to $2.2 billion.
Significantly, dimud R&D costs actually imxcrease for delays
to 1986 and 1990, Costs of $2.3 billion for the current progrem
mu to $2.6 dillion for 1988 and 1990 fatroductioa.

 

Dasic vesson for the increase or relatively small changs {n discounted
RED costs for delayed introduction of the breeder, is the sdditiomsl
R&D costs incurred in the stretchout of a program. The stretchout
involves expenditures {n pbniu-dcﬁ or phasing-out progreme; and
expenditures in re-starting a program, including those coets associated
vith the difficulc task of vreassemdling resources, replacing lost
personnel, retraining of persoanel, and the updating of deteriorated

facilitiea and equipment.

 

The results of the cost-denefit anmalysis which include costs,
benefits, denefit/cost ratics, uranium demsnd, separstive work
desand and nuclesr capacities are summarised in Tables I and 4.

Discounted present valuss are based oa a discount rats of 7X.

 

The undiscounted groes benefits (Madle I) directly resulting
from dollar savings in cost of electric energy associated with the
currently planned dreeder program (1984 introductioa) range from
$53 to $288 dillion (Case 8.2 to Case 5.3) in the 50 year period

1970-2020, depending on the assumptions assigned to uraniun costs,

013.3 ﬁlnm m Mgmt value is associated with rising foseil
M and miu costs (Case 35.3), while the lowest is associated
with constant fossil fuel and urenium costs and an intsrmediate
enazgy demand (Cace 8.2). Other major tangidle denefits are
veduction in air pollution, the production of & large supply of
energy producing plutonium, the large reduction in sepsrative
worh demand, and efficient and economic use of the depleted
uranium stockpile,

 

Of the cases studied, the most prodable case is asscoiated

with rising uranium costs, constant fcssil fuel costs,

a dase energy demand, and with the curreatly plamned fatrodustion of
the breeder in 1984 (Case 1.3, Tadles 3 and 4). The results of this
case show undiscounted gross densfits of $207 dillion, gross discounted
denefits of $9.1 dillion, net benefits sccruing to the breeder program
of $6.6 dillion, and a denefit/cost ratio of 3.6. This case would also
result in a reduction in U:,O; requirements of 1450 kilotons, and a
reduction in maximum separative work demand 02'85 kilotonnes per year.

3.3.4 Parallel Breeder Program
Based on assumptions delineated below, a tentative case can de

made to {mprove the industrial breeder base by establishing a parallel
breeder program. 7The bditita of the LMFBR program would de sufficient
to maintain benefit/cost ratios in excess of one for a 1984, or earlier
introduction of the LMFER and a 1992 introduction of the parallel breeder
for 8 of the 11 cases considered, and using discount rates of 7% or
less. Because of the technical status and other factors, the decision
ca whether to establish a parallel breeder program would have to swait
further analyses of alternative breeder concepts, such as the light
vater breeder reactor, the molten salt breeder resctor, or the gss-
cooled fast breeder. Such analyses would lead to eo#nidoutim for
possibly selecting one of these as a basis for initiating a full scale
parallel bdreeder dovelopment program.

If justified Dy further analysis, a parallel dreeder program could
strengthen the nuclear posture of the U. 8. by providing for increasing
industrial competition, by broadening the industrisl nuclear manufacturing

base, by broadening the base of other associated sectors, and by strengthening

the industrial dase of nuclear technology. The cost-benefit analysis has
assumed the possibility of such a parallel breeder program in each of

Dtscussion of Parallel Breeder Results

Table 2 indicates that a parallel fqll_scale development program will cost
$5.6 billion undiscounted, or an additional $1.6 billion ebove the current
breeder program, assuming 1ntroduction of the LHFBR 1n 1984 and the parallel

breeder in 1992, Discounted at 72 the additional Present worth {n 1970

will be $0,7 billion.

The benefit/cost ratios rarge from 4.8 to 0.6 for a parallel breeder program
for all 8 groups, assuming.a 1984 introductionof the LMFBR and a 1992 intro-
duction of the PBR as contrasted to a range from 6.1 to 0.7 for the current
breeder program for all 8 groups (Table 3). The results indicate that the
early introduction of the LMFBR provides tangible, quantifiable benefits
sufficiently large to adequately support the cost of a parallel breeder
program for most of the cases studies at discount rates of 7% or less, and
at discount rates up to 10% with both rising foassil and rising uranium

costs and with a base energy demand.

The '?“9?;‘“157!°f_benefif’-Fp}9h““333_19'¢}plgqmgggg provides an indication
of the extent tg}uhich uncertainty plays a part in the perturbations
associated with this change, The following summarizes the sensitivity

of the parameters noted.

1. Bfeedef Introduciion Date

Thoﬁgh, for moatMCases, benefits result from savings in
energy ¢ost§.regard1eaa of its date of introduction into the commercial
market, these benefits are substantially affected by the date of
breeder introduction, For ;xample, examination of'Tablea 3 and 4
shows, for Groups 1 and 2, that a ten year delay in the current
date of breeder 1ntroductioﬁ will result in an increased 50-year
energy cost of $131 billion ‘dollars (undiscounted) with rising
uranium costs (Group 1), and $54 billion (undiscounted) with constant
uranivm costs (Group 2). Figures 1 and 2 show IMFBR program un-
discounted and discounted benefits for different IMFBR introduction
dates assuming constant fossil fuel costs,and a base energy demand

for both rising and constant uranium costs (Groups 1 and 2). The

'Cases 1.3b, 2.3b, and.5.3b (R&D Plan B-3) involving a two year delay
in the introduction of the brcedcr were extrapolated from computer
results for Cases 1.3-1.4; 2.3-2:4§ ;Aa 5,3-5, 4; i.e., years 1984
and 1990. Discounted groas benefita for Group 1 Case 1.3b will be |
reduced to $7 4 billicn aa compared to $9 1 billion for 1984 1ntro-
” duct\!,on Case 1 3, or a net re\_dcction of 81.7 billion, net benefits are
reduced from $6.6 billion to '$4.8 billion and benefit/coat ratio is
reduced from 3.6 to 2.8. Of interest 1s-the fact tﬁct the preacnt
worth of the R&D costs is actually increased by-$6.1 billion, 1i.e.,
R&D costs are $2.6 billion for 1986 introducficn ve., $2.5 billion for

1984 introduction., Results of Cases 2.3b and 5.3b are shown in Table 3.

2, Uranium Cost
The effect of uranium cost is indicated by comparing

Cases 1.1 and 2.1 with Cases 1.3 and 2.3 in Table 3 for LMFBR
introduction in 1984. The only parameter changed from Group 1 to
Group 2wes the uranium cost. The discounted cumulative energy cost
-increases by $10,3 billion over 50 years forlan economy without an
LMFBR (Case 2.1 to Case 1.1) with an average increase of $12.60 per
pound of U30g, compared with a $3.5 billion increase for an economy
with an LMFBR (Case 2,3 to Case 1.3) and an average increase of

$2.50 per pound of U30g.

3. Fossil Fuel Costs
Increased discounted gross benefits for the breeder of
$6.1 billion ($15.2 billion less $9.1 billion) accrue with a 1984

LMFBR introduction, assuming rising fossil fuel and uranium costs

a lesser extent.

TOTAL 4.i

Figure 5 shows the diacount{; 'bgneﬁta for an economy with an IMFBR
with rising uranium costs and constant fossil fuel costs as a
function of the change in IMFBR energy cost, Over the range
investigated, ‘the benefits ?.ncréau about $1,6 billion for each

0.1 mill/kwhr decrease in energy cost. The sensitivity of capital
costs 1s such that a 17 decrease in capital cost will cause about
4% increase in discounted benefits, Because the fuel cycle cost

is a smaller absolute number, a 5% reduction in fuel cycle cost

is required to provide an equivalent 4% increase in discounted benefits.

6. Uranium Requirements

Table 4 provides an indication of the substantial savings
in uranium tojbejkaihcd from the early development of the breeder.
Assuning Gtoup 1 parameters of rising uranium costs, constant fosail
costs, and base electrical demands, the results shows a reduction
in 50-year U30g requivements of 1449 kilotons of U30g for an economy
‘with a 1984 breedexn as ¢omphfe& t&fan dconomy~w1thout an IMFBR
(0305_1.3 vs. Case 1.1). A 10-year delay or a 1994 introduction
of tﬂb breeder results in a reduction of only 750 kilotons of
0303, .aa compared to an economy with no LMFBR (Casé 1,5 vs, Case 1.1),
Assuming Group 2 constant uranium costs, constant fossil costs,
and base electrical demands, the results show a reduction in uranium
requirements of 3211 kilotons for the 1984 breeder introduction
date as compared to no LMFBR (Case 2,3 vs, Case 2.1), A 10«ear
delay or a 1994 introduction of the breeder in this situation
results in a reduction in uranium requirements of only 136 kilotons

of U30g as compared to no IMFBR (Case 2.5 vs. Case 2.1).

7. Separative Work Demand
The cost-benefit analysis provides no treatment of the
effect of the breeder on uranium separation capacity. Table 4 does
provide a quantitative set of numbers for the separative work demand
for each of the cases listed., Considerable reductions in separative
work demand can be effected by introducing the breeder. Separative

work demands are subject to changes in uranium cost as discussed

~ The: Inreroepartmental Energy Study report, prepared by the Energy

"”Study Group 1n 1964, "Energy R&D and National Progress," states that
”p_rtioulerf; 1n reference to R&D, 1e en unreeolved problem, involving
ﬁmeny<viewpointe, eubtle end controvereiel issues, and differing value
:judgmente. The report ‘adds that the determinetion (both qualitiative
end quentitetive) of the dieoount rate that the Government might usge
1e a matter of oontinuing oontroverey emong profeeeional economiete.

Testimony given in 1967 and 1968 at hearings before the Subcommittee

on Economy 1n Government of the Joint Economic Committee brought out

a wide range of judgmente eppliceble to this problem, and indicated that
much work lies ahead before reasonable objective criteria can be
established to serve as guidelines in the selection of discount rates
for application to Government progreme.' A common understanding and
agreement on the conceptual basis for discounting must be achieved,
following which agreement must be reached on the method or methods for
calculating discount retee to be ueed.‘

In the Cost-Benefit-Analysis, benefits were calculated after taxes, R&D
costs were enumerated without reference to taxes and a discount rate
repreoenting the after-tax return for utilities was used. If one

- were performing the enelyeie on a social account basis, as favored by
gome economists, one would calculate benefits and costs on a pre-tax
basis and use a discount rate representing the pre-tax rate of return
of the relevant portion of the private sector.

The LMFBR program can be identified with the utility sector of the

U. 8. economy, and the rate of return applicable to that sector has
been congsidered as the criterion rate for evaluation of public
investments in this area. The discount rates applicable to the electric
utility industry would most nearly comply with this criterion. While

it 18 doubtful, as stated, that the electric utility industry would
undertake a program of this magnitude, it is this sector of the economy
which will be in the money market to obtain funds with which to finance
capital investments, and it is in this sector in which benefits accruing
to the public good will be obtained,

The actual averege'rate-of return for all electric utilities privately

 

owned in the U. S. was 6.7% in 1964, 6,9% {n 1965, and was
estimated to be 6,9% for 1966, The actual average fraction of
capital in bonds for all electric utilities privately owned was
0.523 in 1966 and 0,515 in 1965 with fraction 1o equity - 0,477 and

0.485 respectively.

It 13 recognized that the coet of money has mcreased since 1967,

when the asaumptions noted above were made for a systemo analyo:ls )
study. Asouming a 10% return on equi.ty and an increeee to 6% on
corporate bonds, and meinte:ln:lng the seme equity- to-bond rat:lo,

the cost of money would 1nc1ieaee to 7 92% versus 7, 0% used in the
analysis. Since the essumptions for the lineer progreming analysis
were made in 1967 and, to maintain the time schedule for this analysis,

the 7% cost of money has been retained. Further, the 7% cost was

based on private investment, A mixture of private plus local, state,

 

 

 

regional, and Federal investments would more closely approximate the

7%, even today.

these tebles, it 1s worthwhile to consider the effect the choice

£

~:-of’discount\rste'cen have over the 50-yes:-period.considered in this
study. Figure 6, Present Worth of $100 Spent Tem and Fifty Years in the
Future Versus the Discount Rate, indicates that an increase from

5 to 12.5% in the discount rate results in a reduction of the present
worth by about a factor of 30 for expenditures 50 years in the future.
This large sensitivity of benefits from events in the distant future
as a fnnction of discount rate becomes resdily apparent in the results.
The effect of expenditures 10 years in the future on preeent*worth,es

3.3.7 Discussion of Assumptions

Fuel Cycle Costs

The fuel cycle costs annociated_with'the LMFBR are probably
conservative since theywere based on present technology modified
for an increase in scale of plants. Improvements in technology
in the next 50 years should markedly reduce these costs and

measurably increase benefits,

Energy Demand
Though the validity of any of the electrical demand projections may

be at issue, there is little question that electricity penetration of the
energy market is increasing at the expense of other forms of direct energy
use. The differential cost of producing energy which has been displaced
should appropriately be credited if the additional penetration is due

to decreased costs of a new form of energy such as that from an LMFBR.

This was not done in this analysis.

Termination of Analysis
The arbitrary termination of the analysis at the point of high

slope in kilowatt-hour additions has been too conservative. Further,
benefits from plante operating in year 2020 which lmve continuing
lives of up to 30 years are not adequately accounted for. A more

realistic model needs to be developed.

Advanced Converter
The assumption of advanced converter development program success,
followed by a large scale introduction of the advanced converter, leads

to large scale installations of the advanced converter, and substantially

uranium cost. One group included cases with constant fossil fuel
costs, a base energy demand, a non-breeder base case with LWR and -

HIGR, and cases with 1980, 1984, 1990 and 1994 IMFBR introduction,

4.0 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS -

Although the results of the cou-beneﬂt mlynu clurly support the
development of the breedcr in accordancc with l:ho currant plannins
schedule, it is cvidenl: that tho ruultl of qunnt:iﬂable cconon:lc
analysis are only one clmnt to bo conudorod :l.n doumining tho
values of mh devolomntal cfforn. An ducribed :I.n thc 1962 Raport
to the President and its 1967 Supplmnt, nuclur powor, in addition
to the benefits resulting from lower cost power; has a number of other
advantages of tremendous importance and potent:la_l from a near term
and long term standpoint, both here in the United Statq and throughout
the rest of the world, Numbers cannot be assigned to intangibles,
and judgment values in many cases have to predominate, Major benefits
in many cases are not readily susceptible to measurement, but
in terms of national objectives are of substantial consequence.
For example, the success of the breeder program would, in the not: too
distant future, provide:

(1) access to virtually limitless sources of electricity at a low

cost; |
(2) an emple supply of electricity to areas which have been denied
low cost power because of distance from fossil fuel sources or
hydro resources;

(3) virtual elimination of air pollution from nuclear fueled electrical

power plants;

The nuclear connnunity is actively involved in conducting the R&D

operation, be:l.ng built, or are in the planning etage. In edd:ltion
to the AEC sponsored work eubetential investments have been
committed to the LMFBR program by the nuclear industry and
utilities in terms of funds, manpower, and facilities. The.
determination of the AEC to ‘carcry the LMFBR forward on a national

basis, along with the strong economic incentives, have been key

factors in obtaining commitments and participation by industry

Fuel Cycle

Substantial private investments have been made and industrial
competence developed with respect to the fabrication of mixed
oxide plutonium bearing fuel elements in this country for
recycle of this fuel in the LWR, as well as for eventual

use in the LMFBR. This capability over the next ten years

can be increasgd by providing fuel for plutonium recycle in the
LWR, for the Fﬂ'F, and for LMFBR demonstration plants. Thus,
the required fuel cycle capabilities should be well established
when the LMFBR is introduced on a commercial basis in the 1980's.
There is little question that the industrial experience with the
1ight water reactor fuel cycle will be of great importance in

establishing an LMFBR fuel cycle industry.

58
 

| A number of countries, including France, Germany, ltaly,

o Japan, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, have established a high
| priority for the development of the fast breeder reactor as a
matter of national policy. Each of these countries has committed

substantial resources toward achieving this goal. It is

 

| estimated that these countries, excluding the USSR, are spending
i over $150 million per year on fast breeder R&D programs.
Appendix D summarizes the major foreign fast breeder reactor
programs and considers the implications of these programs on

the economy and technological posture of the U. S.

4.8 World Market
The development of a commercial LMFBR by United States industry can

have a beneficial impact on the United States balance of payments
position. Though the country which is first able to produce an
economic and reliable fast breeder reactor may occupy a strong

position from the standpoint of initially capitalizing on the

 

available worldwide market for breeder reactors, the domination

of a foreign market will depend on many other factors. These

include price structure, simplicity of plant operation and maintenance,
and reactor characteristics. Several West European countries

are planning to introduce a fast breeder reactor into the commercial
enviromment in the late 1970's and early 1980's. The U. S. is

planning to ocommence LMFBR operation in the early 1980's.
Substantial sales of both LWR's and breeders will be gained

by the U. S. - both for the near and far term - if the current

programs are successfully achieved. See Appendix D for further details.

energy to paaceful applications was firsl: emmc:l.ated by President

Truman and. has been reiterat:ed by each succeedins President., Strengthening
of the IMFBR program will enhance the pesture of the United States.

There is little question that the USSR would exploit any failure

on the part of the U, 8. to maintain its leadership in this field.

To appreciate this, one need only have witnessed the aggressive

program presented by the USSR at the World Power Conference held

in Moscow in August 1968 with regard to its position in the area

of peaceful application of the atom to nuclear power.

Electricity and Other Procesgses

Whereas the most readily quantifiable benefit from the breeder
program will be the reduction in cost of electricity in mills per
kilowatt hour and of heat in cents pexr million Btu, the indirect
benefits of cheaper energy are extremely far reaching. A small

incremental savings in the cost of energy will open up new horizons

5.0 MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

The following assumptions used in this analysis are based on presently,
available information. The results of the analysis are only as accurate
as the numbers associated with the aumpt:ions. However, as noted
elsevhere, the sensitivity of the benefits to changes in the parameters
associated with these assumptions are fairly valid and of direct

interest.

5.1 Discount Rates
Decisions on appropriate discount rates should be made on a case
by case basis. The application of high discount rat:en‘s could cause
the Government to ignore investments of great potential benefit
to the country which only the Government can undertake in favor
of continued investments by the private sector. For most of
the cases examined in this analysis a 7% discount rate has been
ugsed., The 7% discount rate was adopt:ed by the AEC Systems Analyses
Task Force in 1967 and used in the projection of the nuclear power
economy that served as a basis for this study. For purposes of
comparison and discussion, the model also discounted the objective
function, which has already been minimized with the 77 value, for
discount rates of 5, 10, and 12.5 percent. In no event was the

internal cost of money, 7%, changed in the analysis.

Mass Balance and Reactor Performance

The mass balance of each reactor was based on reactor performance
numbers shown in Table 11. Two sets of values were assumed for
the nmg, one for the initial introduction of the LMFBR and a
second for advanced ﬂE’BR's. The reactors inbtroduced in

thef first! 6 years woré assumed to maintain low specific power and
iggh spedific 1nventory for the 30 years of 1ife. 1In practice,

advanced cores would replace the earlier cores.

@;‘ep of the several types of 1light water reactors used in the
&alyaia are shown in Table 11, representing (1) LWR with only
enriched uranium feed, (2) LWR enriched with only plutonium
feed for first 4 years, then enriched with uranium-235, and

(3) LWR enriched with only plutonium feed for first 10 years,
uranium-235 thereafter, This simplified method was used in the

computer runs to represent non-recycle and recycle IWR's.

Fuel Cycle Costs

The systems analysis model utilized unit costs of fuel fabrication,
dhemical preparation, conversion, and chemicallreprocessing which
have been computed based on fuel mass flows for tﬁa entire 1ife of
each reactor considered. The code used is applicable to reactor
syatems'in which the number of reactors installed is changing

with time, and in which several different kinds of reactors are
used. Based on assumptions developed by the AEC Fuel Recycle

and Systems Analyses Task Forces, representative results are shown

in Table 12,

Uranium costs were assumed to be rising for 5 of the 8 groups
considered (see Table 1) in accordance with a schedplo shown in
Table 13.  This table was developed, for computer purposes,

from the AEC Uranium Reserve estimates shown in Table 14. For
Groups 2, 7, and 8 (Table 1), the uranius cost was assumed to

be constant at $8 per pound U30g. Future uranium discoveries
will probably result in an intermediate cost, more closely approxi-
mating the rising than the constant cost assumption. The analysis
did include some consideration of mtomdiato costs, as discussed
in this report. 7The analysis further gumd that there was no
import or export of fissile or fertile material.

In Plan B-1 through B-5, the alternate breeders (MSBR and alternate

FBR's) are phased out subsequent to IMFBR introduction. Plan B-7

supports a level of effort for alternate breeders through 1971-

1972, at which time it was assumed that a decision is made to

73

Additionel totel expenditureelfor the delayed programs, above and beyond
the total’ expenditures fbr the presently planned progrem*would be made
as a reeult of the pheee-down and phagse~-up during the delaying period.
In any case the plene assume that some benefits from R&D would result

during such delsaying period.

In Plan B-4, IMFBR R&D facilities are maintained to the extent necessary
for introducing the LMFBR in 1990, with the LMFBR technology effort

maintained at $40 million per year for Fiscal Years 1971-77.

Plan B-5 reduces the LMFBR technology effort to $15.0 million in the
FY 1971-77 time period, but maintains existing LMFBR R&D facilities in this

period in a manner which would allow the LMFBR to be introduced in 1994,

Supporting reactor technology programs include support of the industrial,
university and AEC laboratories. Light Water Breeder costs are not
included, since full scale designs of 1000 MWe LWBR's are not available

to date,

To establish the validity of safety criteria used in reactor design,
construction, operation and related accident analysis,

it is necessary for the AEC to continue to support safety R&D

APPENDIX A

Selected Statements and Reviews in Support of the Breeder Program

1,

1962 Report to the President on Civilian Nuclear Power, U, S.

Atomic Energy Commission,

"Clearly: The overall object 's

power program should be to foster and suggg the g;gggng use
of nuclear energy and, importantly, to guide the program in
such directions as to make possible the exploitation of the

vast energy regsources latent in the fertile materials,
uranium=238 and thorium,

"More specific objectives may be summarized as follows:

1.

2,

 

onstruction of plants incorporating ¢t egent gt
competitive reactor types;

The early establishment of a self-gsufficient and gfgging
nuclear power industry that will assume an increasing
gshare of the development costs;:

The development of improved converter and, later, breeder
et conver e fert t nab

 

The maintenance of U, S. technological leadership in the
world by means of a vigorous domestic nuclear power program
and appropriate cooperation with, and assistance to, our
friends abroad."

 

* % %

"Hence, it is essential that, within a reasonably short time, the
goal should be attained of making breeder reactors technologically
and economically attractive, The Government must take the lead

in this regard.'

* Kk k

"Thus, the future program should include the vigorous development
and timely introduction of improved converters and especially of
economic breeders; the latter are essential to long-range major
use of nuclear energy."

76
 

2,

1967 Supplement to the 1962 Report to the President on Civilian

Nuclear Power, U, S, Atomic Energy Commission.

"...Intensive development of the high gain breeder ovér the long te:
has been undertaken as recommended by the 1962 Report.

"The objectives expressed in the 1962 Report are still regarded as
valid, The Commission intends to continue to exercise positive
and vigorous leadership in achieving the technical goals and in
assuring growing participation by the nuclear industry as nuclear
power becomes economic, " - ' -
| L Rk ok | S

"The fast breeder, with a potential for a doubling time of 8 to 10
years, can most efficiently use the fertile uranium-238 in depleted

and natural uranium,

"The fast breeders of major interest are divided into three
categories - sodium cooled, gas cooled and steam cooled., The
sodium cooled fast breeder has been established as the priority
program on the basis of potential economy, reactor manufacturer
interest, and technological experience gained in the U, S. and
abroad. Worldwide interest is concentrated on the sodium cooled
breeder...." '

Energy R&D and National Progress: Findings and Conclusions, An
Interdepartmental Study, September 1966.

"While private industry will probably concentrate on improving
existing commercial reactors, the Government should play a key
role in developing more advanced reactors with better fuel
utilization. Present development schedules should be maintained
80 as to accomplish development and final commercial application
within the normally expected 15 year time period. Concurrently,
the Government should encourage development of more than one
breeder or near breeder concept as a hedge against possible
failure of any one approach.,”

Fast Breeder Reactor Report, Edison Electric Institute, April 1968,

"The long range benefits from the use of fast breeder reactors in
nucleer power generation have been recognized for two decades;
however only recently has widespread interest in the expeditious
development of breeders for commercial application become manifest.

"There are strong economic incentives for the electric utility

industry to participate in the development of the fast breeder
reactor."

Remarks by W. Kenneth Davis, Director, Division of Reactor
Development, U, S. Atomic Energy Commissioh, Fagt Reactor
Information Maeting, Chicago, Illinois, November 20, 1957,

"I1f we ask ourselves why there should be a substantial effort
on fast reactors, 1 think a major reason to be given is the
promise of nuclear breeding, Fast reactors offer a proven
means of utilizing to the maximum the energy stored in
uranium - not just that in the U-235 (0.71 percent of natural
uranium) or even that which can be obtained by a plutonium
recycle in thermal reactors which is only two or three times
the natural U-235 content,

"The fast reactor systems offer, in addition to the advantagrs
of high temperature and long fuel 1life, the attractive possi-
bili.y of breeding, and thus are probably the most important
systems which we have under study when looked at from the

long range viewpoint. The idea of conservation of nuclear
fuel, which can best be realized by development of breeder
concepts, 18 of such importance to our program that we have
made it the subject of a separate objective of our long range
progranm, "

Remarks by Dr, Frank K, Pittman, Director, Division of Reactor
Development, U, S, Atomic Energy Commission, Fast Breeder
Power Conference, Detroit, Michigan, December 3, 1963,

"To this end, the objective of the Commission's nuclear power
program for the long-range future is clearly identified: 1t
is to guide the program in such direction as to make possible
the exploitation of the vast energy resources latent in the
fertile materials, thorium and uranium-238. We are still
involved in some of the first steps toward the realization of
this long-term objective., Successfully attaining this
objective will assure that we can obtain maximum benefit from
our low cost uranium reserves and render relatively unimportant
the cogt of nuclear raw materials so that even very low-grade
sources will become economically acceptable,”

Remarks by AEC Coﬁmidcioner Dr. Cerald P, Tape, Third
Intérnational Confhrenéa on tﬁe Paaédful Uses of Atomic

Energy, Geneva, Switzerland, August 31, 1964.

YThe basic purpose of nuclear power research and development in

the United States is to provide an additional and alternate
energy source to meet present and future demands thereby providing
timely protection for the nation against rising power costs and
eventual fuel shortages. The long term objective will be met
through the development of commercial breeder reactors capable of
utilizing the vast potential of the world's nuclear resources."

Remarks by Dr. Glenn T, Seaborg, Chairman, U, S. Atomic Energy
Commission, American Power Conference, Chgcago, Illinois,
April 25, 1967.

"In speaking to the British Nuclear Energy Society last October,
1 outlined the reasons why I believe we must move ahead rapidly
to the development of more efficient means of using our basic
nuclear energy resources - the world's vast, but not unlimited,
supply of uranium and thorium, Projections of the world's
increasing population, its rising rate of consumption of energy,
and its evea proportionally greater increase in the use of
electricity, combine to show an urgent need for developing
economically competitive nuclear reactors which will burn,

79
“not ;1ess :than one:percent of .the uranium used in today's

in the/predecessor AEC program - namely, the 1light water
‘reactor program for electric power plants., Embarkation
into the breeder generation is another important indication
of the growing maturity of our nuclear power industry,"

'8 Remarks by‘Coﬁminoioner‘wilfrid E. Johnson, U. 8., Atomic
Energy Commission, ANS Topical Meeting, San Francisco, California,
April 10, 1967.

“The ultimate step in extending fuel supplies is in getting
many times the present 1 to 2% of energy latent in uranium
transformed into economically useable form., Our ability to
make more than a few percent of this latent energy available
at all, requires the breeder-type of reactor, and to get this
energy into the economy requires that nuclear breeding plants
be economic., To achieve this goal will require that Covernment
and industry each pursue complementary roles,"

h. Remarks by Congressman Chet Holifield, Chairman of JCAE,
American Public Power Association's 1965 Annual Convention
Los Angelea? California, May 4, 1965,
"1f we are successful in developing advanced converters and
near term breeders utilizing thorium we will succeed in
multiplying our energy resources as much as 50 times., If
we successfully tackle and accomplish the much more difficult

goal of high yield breeder reactors we will have achieved
unlimited supplies of energy."

Meeting of the American Nuclear sod:loty, Denver, Colorado,

finer bequest to succeeding generations than that,"
Remarks by Representative Craig Hosmer (R-Calif), ANS Meeting,
San Diego, California, June 13, 1967,

"Continued large reserch and development costs to round out
the national nuclear power capability in the form of advanced
converters and breeders makes continued substantisl government
part:lc'i'pation in these areas mandatory for another 1% years
or 80,

Statement by Philip Sporn, President of American Blectric
Power Service Corporation, before the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy, July 17, 1964.

"This program (reactor development program) should be aimed at
the development of advanced reactors which mske more efficient
use of nuclear fuels than do our present light water reactors,
Selection of specific concepts and the setting up of develop-
ment schedules in this program must be determined so as to be
consistent with the overall and developing energy needs and
policies of this country. 1In particular, it is my judgment
that we need to focus both on reactors vhich can utilize thorium
efficiently and on fast breeders. Moreover, I believe that the
potential economic performance of each of these reactors must
be considered every bit as seriously as their ability to

extend our nuclear fuel resources, for we can afford neither
the waste of our fuel resocurces nor our manpower and other

e;.'Expcnditurec in 1964 for tha developmcnt of ‘economic civilian
nuclear power are estimated at $244 million, 'an increase of
$34 million over 1963, In line with the Commission's recent
Report to the President on Civilian Nuclear Power, increasiag
emphasis will be placed on reactors which produce more fuel than:
they consume ("breeders"). Breeders will be necessary 1f
nuclear energy is to make a significant contribution to the
national powcr supply in the long run.’

b. FY 1965 B“dseto

"Increancd emphasis will be placed on reactors which produce more
fuel than they consume ("breeders") and efforts will be continued
to devclop certain other advanced reactors.

"In 1965 particular cmphasis*will be given to "breeder" power
reactors, which would produce more fissionable material than
they consume, and to the area of nuclear safety."

c. FY 1966 Budgﬂtc

"The Commission is also working toward the long-range objective
of high-gain breeder reactors which produce significantly more
fuel than they consume, These breeders would insure a tremendous
energy source for centuries to come,"

"Continued emphasis will be given to the development of reactors
which produce significantly more fuel than they consume ("high-
gain breeders') as the long-range objective for civilian power
reactors."

82

  
   
  
 
  

 
I'Y 1967 Budget.

"With the increasingly widespread acceptance and use of
nuclear power reactors, the efforts of the Federal
Government are focused upon development of improved

designs which will use nuclear fuels more efficiently and
produce electric power at lower cost, Work on the so-called
"fast breeder" reactors--which would produce more fuel than
they consume--will be intensified, with design in 1967 of a
special test reactor, expected to cost about $75 million."

FY 1969 Budget.

"The principal element of AEC's program in this area is the
effort to develop an economic fast breeder reactor, which
promiges to produce morxe fissionable nuclear material than
is consumed in the process of producing power. This long-
texm program will be intensified further in 1969."

CY 1958 AEC Annual Report.

"Fast reactors occupy an important place in nuclear power
programs because their ability to produce more fuel than
they consume is potentially important to conservation of
fissionable material resources,"

CY 1963 AEC Annual Report.

"The third implementing phase of the AEC's civilian nuclear
reactor power program is the conduct of an intensive, long-
range effort to develop breeder reactors which will make
possible the use of the full potential energy available in
nuclear fuels,"

"Good technical progress has been made on the breeder concept
which has been under study for a number of years. 1Its
technology, however, is extremely complex and much research
and development remains to be done before breeder reactors
approach an economically attractive stage of development,"

CY 1967 AEC Annual Report.
"With induastry’s acceptance of the light water reactors, the

AEC has now given the higheat priority to the development of
liquid metal-cooled fast breeder reactors (IMFBR)."

development of reactors which utilize nuclear fuel more
efficiently, As the AEC indicated in its November 1962
report to the President, it is only nuclear energy which
holds the promise of meeting the Nation's long-term
energy requirements and in this connection, only those
reactors which permit more efficient utilization of fuel,
or contribute to the ultimate goal of breeding, should

be pursued., In this report, the AEC indicated that the
fast reactor concept would be the main approach to
developing breeders. However, since that time, technolog-
ical developments have occurred which indicate that
breeding may also be feasible in certain types of thermal
reactors using the thorium fuel cycle. This would
represent a major advance in our reactor technology, since
it provides an alternate approach to the fast breeder
reactor., It would be an important milestone in the
national objective of conserving our fuel resources."

FY 1966 Budget.

"The AEC's civilian power reactor program represents a
planned research and development effort designed to intro-
duce a new energy source into the national economy. The
ultimate objective of this program is the development of
high-gain breeder reactors to meet the Nation's long-term
energy needs, The basic guidelines to be followed in this
development effort were stated in the AEC's November 1962
report to the President, the basic conclusions and
recommendations of which the committee continues to
endoree as a national policy for the development of civilian
nuclear power."

FY 1967 Budget.

"The civilian nuclear power program is presently proceeding
in accordance with guidelines expressed in the Atomic Energy
Commission's November 1962 report to the President, This
report has provided the program with sound objectives for
attainment of a virtually limitless supply of energy for
this country. However, the committee believes that
developments, particularly those in the past year,

84

 

 

 
d.

warrant a general updating of the program presented in this
report. The committee urges this review because of the
sharply increased rate of addition of nuclear generating
capacity, changes in estimates of future growth of nuclear
power, the more recent technical developments which have
taken place in certain of the advanced reactor fields,

and the latest information which has been developed
concerning our uranium resources," = -

FY 1968 Budget,

"A very significant point has been reached concerning test
facilities for the fast breeder program. The proposed

Fast Flux Test Facility (FFIF), for which the committee

has recommended authorization of $80 million in construction
funds beyond the previously authorized $7.5 million for
architect-engineering, is aimed at providing critically
needed test facilities for the sodium cooled fast breeder
program. In light of the complexity of this facility, test
results from it are not expected until about 1975. The
next major decision in the fast breeder program concerns the
plan for construction of demonstration fast breeder reactor
power-plants., The Commission in its testimony stated a
belief that such plants could be started as early as 1970,
The committee intends to follow the planning and scheduling
of this important phase of the program closely,"

FY 1969 Budget.

"As the Commission's highest priority civilian nuclear reactor
program, the liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) program
is rapidly becoming a model for coordinated, long-range
planning, The Commission is to be commended for its efforts
to obtain the maximum industrial contribution toward solving
the technical problems and in broadening the base of industrial
capability in both technical and management aspects."

Statements® Regarding Corporate Commitments
of Major Reactor Manufacturers to LMFBR

North American Rockwell Corporation

"North American Rockwell is committed as a matter of corporate
policy to becoming a supplier of fast breeder reactor power
plants to the utility industry. Beyond the integrated invest-
ment in facilities and equipment at Atomics International, the
corporation has invested to date $7 million in conceptual
design and $1.9 million in capital facilities and equipment

to support the design of a 500 Mie fast breeder plant intended
for construction on the Penelec system under the AEC demonstra-~
tion plant program. The demonstration plant is a key objective
in the corporation's plan to supply FBR's to the utility
industry. The company investment during this fiscal year
(October 1967 - September 1968) will be 4.3 million dollars

for design and development and $1.1 million for capital
facilities and equipment.”

The interest and commitment of North American Rockwell was also
stated by Mr., J. L. Atwood, President and Chief Executive Officer
of North American Rockwell, in remarks before the Commission on
January 8, 1968 during a presentation on the AI1/GPU program. A
portion of that statement i8 quoted here.

"North American Rockwell is prepared to commit the management
and financial resources required over the next ten years to
demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of the
1iquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor concept. Our
conmitment is predicated on anticipated progress in the AEC
Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Program, successful
development and test in the current NR-GPU program and
appropriate support from the AEC for our demonstration plant
program leading to commercial operation in 1976."

General Electric Company

"It is a matter of record that General Electric Company is
committed as a point of corporate policy to develop and
demongtrate the successful operation of the IMFBR in the
electric utility industry on a true scale, consistent with
‘the commercial availability of plutonium from the thermal
reactor systems, - Cera B e _ ._

"With the door thus effectively closed on early development
of a steam cooled fast reactor, General Electric has taken
the position that it will concentrate its technical resources
on meeting the date of 1980 with the liquid metal fast
breeder reactor. :

"On September 5, 1967 General Electric entered into a contract
with the Empire State Atomic Development Associates for a $5
million research and development program, whose stated
objective is to develop information which will significantly
strengthen the basis for a demonstration plant commitment in
1969-1970. General Electric has undertaken to submit to
ESADA not later than September 30, 1969, provided that it 1is
technically feasible and safe to proceed, an offer to supply a
sodium cooled fast breeder nuclear power plant with a design

- target output of approximately 300 MJ. Although it is c¢laar
that implementation of this agreement depends on the prior
successful operation of the SEF(R reactor, and on General
Electric's assessment of the state of development of the sodium
cooled fast breeder technology generally (which obviously
depends in large part on :he results from current AEC LMFBR
programs), it is also clear that such an undertaking with soma
of General Electric's major customers represents a serious
gstatement of intent," '

87
 

Westinghouse Electric Coxrporation

Weatinghouse "has committed $50 million for facilities and
development'” in the fast reactor area. ''In addition, more
than $10 million in facilities are 1n place and more under
construction." :

""We have also joined 22 utilities and one consultant engineer
- to participate in our work to lead toward a demonstration plant,

“To support this approach, Westinghouse has comuitted more of
its resources, including capital, to breeder development than
to any other single technological development. The Westinghouse
~ approach 18 a three-phase program leading to construction of
a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor. This demonstration
plant, with a rating of 200 to 400 megawatts, will be the
prototype design for a full-scale 1000-MW plant. The program's
first phase, which will continue until 1970, encompasses the
study and research needed to commit the demonstration plant to
detailed design; the second phase is plant construction,
expected to take about five years; in the final phase, the
plant will be operated to optimize the design and determine the
technological and economic feasibility of the full-scale fast
breeder plant,

"This development program can be successful only if it receives
the active support of both the utility industry and the Atomic
Energy Commission, The first phase of the program, already
underway, is receiving financial support from several utilities,
some of which may also provide manpower. A number of other
utility companies, along with the Atomic Energy Commission, have
been invited to join the first phase, Similar cooperation will
be required to complete the second and third phases.

"As a part of the Westinghouse commitment, the facilities of
the Advanced Reactors Division are undergoing a five million
dollar expansion program. The building expansion, due for
completion in early 1969, will provide administration and
engineering offices, high and low bay testing and analytical
laboratories, machine and instrument shops, and other
migcellaneous gsupport facilities for design, experimentation
and testing in the areas of:

Plant Systems and Components Development
Reactor Mechanical Development

Fuels and Materials Development

Sodium Technology"

Babcock & Wilcox Company

"A recent comprehensive evaluation by corporate management
confirmed that substantial amounts of money, personnel and
facilities will continue to be invested in the LMFBR and
other advanced R&D to secure a place in the breeder market
when it develops. The Company has spent millions of dollars
to date in nuclear R&D of which a large portion is directly
and indirectly related to breeder reactor development,
Planned expenditures approximate $36 million in the next

ten years on breeder reactors alone,

"At this time, the Company is pPreparing the groundwork for
a joint BSW-utility LMFBR engineering program., Over thirty
electrical utilities have been presented with background
information as to B&W performance and capability in the
fast breeder field., Discussions are now being held with
certain of these utilities for the purpose of laying the
foundation for the referenced joint venture.

"The proposed association with the utility industry will
provide for active and objective communication between B&W
and the electrical utilities. The information and analysis
developed by this joint venture will provide a sound basis
for the decisions required relative to the construction of
a demonstrator plant," -

Combustion Engineering, Inc.

"The ultimate importance of the fast breeder for the generation
of economic electrical power was recognized some years ago by
Combustion Engineering, and the Company has consistently
promoted this concept as a means to decrease dependence upon
the limited source of low cost uranium ore,

"We are, consequently, pursuing the development of a sodium-
cooled fast breeder with a core geometry optimized for economics
using sodium-bonded carbide fuel. We expect that this development
‘will take several years, that it will require substantial support
from the USAEC and from the utility industry and that it will
involve the construction of a demonstration plant at an
appropriate time,

"Combustion Engineering 18 actively engaged in obtaining utilit
support for its research and development program. .

"One utility has given us a letter of intent to support this program,
Several other utilities have expressed considerable interest in the
program, and we expect to receive several more favorable responses.
In addition, there are a number of other utilities we plan to contact
about this program which would ultimately place us in a position to
work on a firm design for a demonstration plant."

International Fast Breeder Programs and Implications

In this study the expenditures on the different foreign programs have
not been placed on a comparable basis with those of the U. S. since
accessibility to information on foreign expenditures and budgets is
limited. However, as the attached table. (Table D-1) from the EEI

Fast Breeder Reactor Report* shows, it is estimated that other countries,
excluding the USSR, are spending over $150 million per year on fast
breeder R&D programs, - :

The French have spent about $160 million through 1967 on their LMFBR
program,and expect to spend over $100 million more for the Phoenix
Reactor and critical experiments through 1972, Germany has spent $100
million on R&D and, in cooperation with Belgium and the Netherlands,
plans to spend $300 million additional on R&D and prototype design,
$100 million on prototype construction, and $500 million on development
and construction of commercial plant., Most of these expenditures are
on the LMFBR,

It is estimated that the Euratom members (German, Prance, Netherlands,
Belgium, Italy) will have spent at least $2 billion by 1978 on the
LMFBR, including two pPrototype-and two commercfal-scale LMFBR plants,
Attempts are being made by Euratom to consolidate R&D activities of
member countries, and to construct two pPrototype and only one commercial
Plant, thereby reducing their expenditures,

The United Kingdom has spent about $130 million over the last five
years specifically on the LMFBR,and another $55 million on general
reactor technology, a major share of which is oriented toward the

fast breeder. These expenditures represent about 457 of their reactor
R&D budget. Construction of the LMFBR Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR)

is underway, and the total cost is estimated to be $70 million,

The attached table (Table D-2) shows the operational dates of fast
reactors, past and future,in various interested countries. The U.S.
Program has been on an extended time scale when compared with other
countries. This approach has been taken for a number of reasons.
However, at this time, continued emphasis and strengthening of the
U. 8. efforts are required to permit this country to establish an
advantageous position in a competitive market,

 

*Fast Breeder Reactor Report, Edison Electric Institute, April 1968,

95
Substantial sales of light water and breeder reactors will be obtained,
both for the near and far term . with the successful achievement of
the objectives of the U. S. reactor programs. ' !

The development of a commercial LMFBR by United Stated industry can
have a beneficial impact on the United States balance of payments
position. Though the country which is first able to produce an
economic and reliable fast breeder reactor may occupy a strong
position from the standpoint of initially capitalizing on the
available worldwide market for breeder reactors, the domination of

a foreign market will depend on many other factors., These include
price structure, simplicity of plant operation and maintenance, and
reactor characteristics. Several West European countries are
planning to introduce a fast breeder reactor into the commercial
environment in the late 1970's and early 1980's, The U. S. is planning
to commence LMFBR operation in the early 1980's., Substantial sales
of both INR's and breeders will be gained by the U. 8., both for the
near and far term, if the current programs are successfully achieved.

 

 

The following simplified calculation provides an indication of the
financial implications of a worldwide free market for nuclear reactors.
Asstming a parallel introduction of the breeder by the various competing
free world countries in 1984 and electricity demands of the U. S.

equal to the rest of the free world, the total IMFBR demand for the
free world in the 1984-1995 period would equal 640,000 Mde, representing
about $100.billion dollars in investment.

On the basis of the above assumptions, the U, 8. industry has the potential
of competing not only for the $50 billion domestic market, but also 1is

in the position of competing in an overseas market of equal size. Each
percent of the overseas market represents about $500 million.
