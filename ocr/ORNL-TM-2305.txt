EXPERIMENTAL HEATS OF INCOLOY 800 AT 700 AND 760°C

 

D. G. Harman

ABSTRACT

Tensile and creep-rupture data have been obtained at
700 and 760°C for several experimental heats of Incoloy 8CO
that were irradiated in the ORR at elevated temperatures.
Effects of composition, grain size, and carbide morphology
were investigated.

Enhanced postirradiation ductility was achieved for
Tncoloy 800 containing about 0.1% Ti in creep-rupture tests.
The meximum ductility for this composition was obtained -
for the smaller grain sizes and at the lower creep stress
levels and appeared to be independent of carbon content.
Significant variations in properties {both control and
postirradiation tests) were noted for alloys within the
commercial Incoloy 800 composition specifications.

The ductility peak at about 0.1% Ti is not fully
understood; it might be best explained by two independent
mechanisms, one accounting for the increasing ductility
with increasing titanium at levels less than 0.1% and
the other explaining the decreasing ductility at higher
titanium levels, The grain size effect 1s thought to be
due to differences in either helium distribution or
stresses necessary for grain boundary fracture propagation.

 

INTRODUCTION

The elevated-temperature properties of Incoloy 800 make it an
attractive material for nuclear reactor application. The alloy has
been a backup material for fuel cladding for the BONUS (Boiling Nuclear
Superheat) Reactor® and is a prime candidate for various other reactor
systems. For example, Incoloy 800 is being considered for the LMFBR
(Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor) fuel cladding, and Sweden is

application.2

Incoloy 800 is nominally a 46% Fe—21% Cr—32% Ni ternary solid solution
alloy, but with important additions of carbon, aluminum, and titanium,
The commercial compositional specifications as listed in Table 1 allow
significant variations in the concentrations of these added elements.
Vendor recommendations for specific compositions depend upon the appli-

cation being considered.

Other investigators3:4 have studied effects of high-temperature
neutron irradiation on the properties of Incoloy 800. Various titanium,
aluminum, and carbon levels were studied, but no comprehensive study of
compositional effects was undertaken. Also, postirradiation studies
included only short-time tensile testing. Little or no creep-rupture

data have been formally reported for irradiated Incoloy 800. Limited
preliminary creep data are currently available, however, from studies at
Studsvik, Sweden.” The present report shows that obtaining postirradiation
creep-rupture properties is essential to the evaluation of the Incoloy &CO

alloy system.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

We tested several experimental 100-1b heats of Incoloy 800 as
listed in Table 2. Titanium contents range from less than 0.02 to 0.4%,
and two carbon levels are being studied — low carbon with 0.02 to 0.04%
and high carbon with 0.10 to 0.14%,

Control and irradiated specimens of the buttonhead design (See
Fig. 1.) used in previous ORNL experiments were tested at 700 and 760°C
under tensile and creep conditions. The tensile tests for both control
and irradiated specimens were conducted on a floor-model Instron testing
machine at crosshead speeds of 0.05 and 0.002 in./min. (Strain rates were
5 and 0.2%/min.) The creep-rupture tests for the control specimens were

conducted in air on dead-load and lever-arm creep frames., Irradiated

specimens were creep-rupture tested in air on lever-arm creep machines
specially designed for hot-cell coperation. The cell during operation is
shown in Fig. 2.

Specimens tested at 760°C were irradiated in a poolside facility of
the ORR for one cycle (approx 1100 hr) at 760°C to a total fluence of 2 to
3 x 10°0 neutron/cm2 thermal and 1 to 2 x 1029 neutrons/em?® fast. From
cach of six compositions, eight specimens were irradiated — four having
been annealed at 1150°C for 10 min and four annealed and then aged 100 hr
at 800°C. This aging treatment was designed to agglomerate the grain
boundary carbides. To study the effect of strain rate, two tensile tests
and two creep-rupture tests were conducted for each of these two metal-
lurgical conditions for each composition.

Specimens tested at 700°C were irradiated at 650 or 700°C for two
cycles in a core position of the ORR to an average thermal and fast
fluence of about & x 1020 neutrons/cmz. Various metallurgical conditions
were investigated at this temperature. Grain diameters of 15 and 30 p
for the low-carbon alloys and 10 and 40 u for the high-carbon alloys were
included. The effect of the "carbide agglomeration" aging treatment on
cold worked and annealed specimens and the irradiation of cold worked
material were studied for both carbon levels. This aging treatment
actually recrystallized the ccld worked material to a grain diameter of
about & . These specimens were primarily creep-rupture tested, but a
limited amount of tensile testing was also conducted. Tests on control

specimens for this experiment are in progress and will be reported later.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results of the tensile and creep tests at 760°C are listed in
Tables 3 and 4. The tensile test results showed the expected loss in
ductility due to irradiation for all titanium levels for both the high-
and low-carbon alloys. Total tensile elongations of 40 to 70% were
reduced to 5.5 to 13.5% by irradiation.

With one exception similar ductility losses were noted for the creep-

rupture tests. Total creep elongations of 22 to 75% for the control tests

were reduced to 9 to 20% by irradiation except for one heat of material
(heat 93H with 0.1% Ti), which showed only slight losses in creep
ductility.

Some loss in ultimate tensile strengths and an appreciable loss in
the rupture times-were observed; these were commensurate with the

ductility losses. Tensile yield strengths were relatively unaffected
10

by irradiation at this temperature. The results of both the control
tests and the postirradiation tests showed an insignificant effect of
the 100-hr aging treatment.

The results of tensile and creep tests at 700°C are listed in
Tables 5 and 6. Again, irradiation caused severe losses in ductility.
The control tests are still in progress and are expected to show

ductilities similar to those in the 760°C control tests.

alrradiated two c¢ycles in the ORR core.

Tables 5 and 6 show that the postirradiation ductility is signifi-
cantly influenced by the grain size and composition of the material.
Increased ductility was noted for decreasing grain size. Enhanced
postirradiation ductility was observed for those heats having 0.1% Ti
(low-carbon heat 22A and high-carbon heat 93H). For example, the high-
carbon material with the 10-p grain diameter showed 54% postirradiation
creep elongation for 0.1% Ti but only 12% for 0.38% Ti heat. Similar
behavior was noted for the low-carbon heats. The preirradiation aging
treatment increased ductility except for the 0.1% Ti heats.

The results obtained so far illustrate the wide range in elevated-
temperature mechanical properties that can be obtained for material
‘within the Incoloy 800 specification. Significant differences were
noted in strength and ductility as measured in both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions. Also the preirradiation metallurgical condition
and the testing procedures (tensile or creep rupture) used may be
important considerations.

Although only a limited number of materials and testing conditions
have been investigated, some of the more important test results are
appropriate for discussion. The postirradiation ductility will be

treated first with the more important variables being discussed separately
13

as much as possible. The strength observations will then be discussed,
but to limited extent because of the scope of the report and the present

lack of 700°C control data.

Effects on Ductility

Alloy Composition

 

The test data collected on these 100-1b heats should indicate
desirable compositions for commercial large-scale heats of Incoloy 800
for nuclear applications. A similar scale-up approach has been used
for type 304 stainless steel® and is under way for type 316 stainless
steel” and the nickel-base Hastelloy N,® all modified by titanium
additions.

As has been the case for the other alloy systems, the specific
level of titanium has a significant effect on postirradiation properties
at elevated temperatures. The most dramatic effect is seen in the
ductility as measured in the creep-rupture test. The total elongations
are plotted against the titanium content in Figs. 3 and 4 for test
temperatures of 700 and 760°C, respectively. A decisive peak in creep
ductility is noted for both test temperatures at around 0.1% Ti, and
the position of this peak is not affected by the carbon level over the
range of 0.03 to 0.13% at 700°C.

A similar ductility peak was found by Weir and Martin®

for experi-
mental heats of type 304 stainless steel alloyed with titanium,as is
shown in Fig. 5. Since the formation of TiC is thermodynamically

favorable (the free energy of formation is —41,000 cal/mole at 1000°K),

it has been arguedlo that the ductility maximum occurs at the 1:1 atom
ratio of titanium and carbon (4:1 weight ratio). The argument is that
the formation of TiC utilizes all of the available carbon and prevents
the formation of the grain boundary embrittling M»3Cg. However, carbides
other than titanium carbide (e.g., M33Cq) have been seen'? in the
structure for all titanium levels. Indeed, the present study shows that
for Incoloy 800 the position of the ductility peak is independent of
carbon content over the range studied.

The radiation embrittlement of high~temperature alloys has been
attributed to the generation of helium by the 1°B(n,a) reaction.®
Titanium is a strong boride former — the free energy of formation of TiB
is ~38,400 cal/mole at 1000°K — and therefore may distribute the boron
and subsequent helium throughout the matrix (and away from the grain
boundaries) by the formation of TiB. This may account for the rise in
ductility with increasing titanium content at the lower titanium levels
but does not readily explain the decreasing ductility as the titanium
exceeds 0.1%.

Many compounds appear in the microstructure of Incoloy 800, as is
the case for most engineering alloys. Two competing processes could be
taking place. On cne hand, the formation of TiB could result in increased
ductility with increasing titanium; on the other hand, at higher titanium
levels the formation of other compounds could enhance grain boundary
embrittlement and decrease ductility. These could be titanium compounds
or other compounds whose formation is enhanced by the presence of
titanium.

This argument might account for the absence of a ductility peak for
Hastelloy N modified with titanium. A continuous increase in ductility
was noted® up to about 1.2% Ti. The thermodynamics of the Hastelloy N

alloy system might be such that at low titanium levels the grain boundary

17

embrittling reaction described above would not occur. However, the post-
irradiation ductility of Hastelloy N seems to be insensitive to the
initial boron content up to 50 ppm, which questions the above effect of

TiB for this alloy.

Strain Rate

The enhanced postirradiation ductility at the 0.1% Ti level is shown
in the creep tests but not in the tensile tests, as can be seen in Figs. 3
and 4. Little or no compositional effect is shown for the tensile results,
whereas the creep-rupture data show a sizable effect on postirradiation
ductility.

Other studies'?s13 on the postirradiation ductility of both experi-
mental and commercial Incoloy 800, which used only tensile testing, did
not reveal any significant effects of composition. Our results show that
the reason for this was an unfortunate choice of postirradiation testing
conditions.

A model based on the stress-induced growth of helium bubbles that
are present in irradiated metals has been offered'” as an explanation
for the increasing postirradiation ductility at decreasing strain rates
(i.e., decreasing stress levels). A certain critical stress, given as
0.76 %, is required to cause the helium bubble present at a grain
boundary to grow and subsequently link with others to cause premature
intergranular fracture. 1In this expression r is the radius of the helium
bubble, which is assumed to be spherical, and y is the effective surface
energy. According to this model, the irradiated material would show the

same ductility as that unirradiated at sufficiently low stresses.

Figure 6 shows this to be the case Tor the 0.1% Ti material at 760°C

(data from Tables 3 and 4). However, this does not explain why the

other heats of Incoloy 800 included in the figure responded only weakly

to decreasing stress levels., It could be that the surface energy term

in the critical stress relationship is less for these alloys than for those
with 0.1% Ti. Some very complex grain boundary reactions have been

found for Incoloy 800 and may be indicative of surface energy variability.
Recent findings by Snyderl5 on some of the alloys included in this report
show that these reactions are sensitive to titanium content. However,
Gehlbach*® found no titanium present in the grain boundary precipitates

of the one experimental alloy that he analyzed using the microprobe.

Grain Size

Grain size has been reportedl7 to be important to the postirradiation
ductility of type 304 stainless steel, with the finer grained material
more ductile. Figure 3 verified this for the experimental Incoloy 800
at 700°C., The same data are plotted as a function of grain diameter in
Fig. 7 for titanium levels of 0.1 and 0.2%. Under these testing conditions
the postirradiation creep ductility of Incoloy 800 with a given titanium
level is governed almost entirely by the grain size and seems to be
independent of carbon level. This is particularly important for
Incoloy 800, as laboratory tests show that the grain size can be
controlled over a wide size range for all compositions. Figures 8 and 9
show resulting grain sizes for representative heats of both low and high
carbon content annealed at various temperatures.

Martin and Weirl7 suggested that the effect of grain size on post-

irradiation ductility might result from differences in helium concentration

on grain boundaries or from changes in grain boundary shear stresses that
cause fracture. ©OSince a given amount of helium is produced from boron
burnup and if this helium is present as bubbles in the grain boundaries,

a lower concentration at the boundaries would be expected if the total
available grain boundary area were increased (i.e., grain size decreased).
The lower helium bubble concentration would be expected to be less
embrittling to the grain boundary and thus improve overall ductility.
Even though not all of the helium may reach the grain boundaries the
overall conclusion of increasing ductility with decreasing grain size

would probably remain valid.

Preirradiation Aging

 

Some of the specimens received a heat treatment designed to
agglomerate the carbide that i1s present in these alloys. Carbide in
this form spaced along the grain boundary surface should be less detri-
mental to grain boundary ductility than the nearly continuous carbide
films that frequently result from conventional annealing treatments.
Figures 10 and 11 show the carbide agglomeration. Comparison of the
test results for aged and unaged specimens as listed in Tables 3 and 4
shows little difference in postirradiation properties for the 760°C
irradiation and test temperatures. EBEvidently the 1100 hr at 760°C during
the irradiation also provided sufficient carbide agglomeration. This
was also true for the control specimens, which also experienced the 1100 hr
at 760°C before testing.

Tables 5 and 6 list the 700°C test results, showing some effect of
preirradiation aging. The postirradiation ductility of the high-carbon
material was slightly lowered for the heat containing 0.1% Ti but was
increased for all other titanium levels., In effect this broadens the

ductility peak. The results were not conclusive for the low-carbon heats.

Strength Considerations

In general, the effects of irradiation on the strength of the

experimental Incoloy 800 were about those expected from date collected st

ORNL on similar materials and are in agreement with the Incoloy 800 findings

reported in the literature. That is, the strength properties were
affected only through a curtailment of total ductility. Tables 3 and 4
list data for both the irradiated and the control specimens at 760°C.
Examination of the tensile results in Table 3 shows that the 0.2%
yield strength, the ultimate tensile strength, and the uniform elongation
are unaffected by irradiation. The stress-strain curve is affected by the
irradiation only in that portion beyond the peak load, where nonuniform
deformation and grain boundary fracturing are occurring. These occur
with less overall elongation for the irradiated specimens. Typical
tensile curves comparing the unirradiated and irradiated material at

760°C are shown in Fig. 12.

Similarly, the initial stages of the creep curve are very nearly
the same for both irradiated and control specimens, as shown in Fig. 13,
Minimum creep rates were generally slightly higher for the irradiated
material. Bloom™® has attributed this to an early onset of third-stage
creep before a true minimum creep rate was established. However, the
second stage of creep lasted much longer for the unirradiated material

and more elongation occurred during third-stage creep.

The curtailment of creep ductility seriously affected the creep-
rupture life of Incoloy 800. Figure 14 illustrates the shorter rupture
times at 760°C for the irradiated material for the high-carbon heats
with 0.17 and 0.10% Ti. Included in these plots is the ultimate tensile
strength at two strain rates plotted against the total test time. The
higher titanium heat shows the nearly parallel rupture curves typical of
high-temperature alloys. However, the more ductile 0.1% Ti heat shows
the rupture curves converging at the lower stresses, This is expected
since the ductility curves for this heat also converge at these stresses
(see Fig. 6). It is also evident from the stress-rupture curves that
aging 100 hr at 800°C before irradiation had no effect on the 760°C
rupture life.

Any conclusions regarding rupture strength based on the 700°C data
must await the testing of the control specimens. However, we note that
the postirradiation rupture strength increases with grain size, as would
be expected at this temperature for unirradiated material. For example,
for the 0.1 and 0.2% Ti alloys stressed at 12,000 psi, increasing the
grain diameter from 10 to 40 u increased the rupture time from 100 to
500 hr, and this increase seemed to be independent of carbon content.
Aging the high-carbon alloys for 100 hr at 800°C before irradiation
reduced the rupture life at 700°C about in half. Also, the higher
titanium heats had longer rupture times, which could be due to an aging

effect.

CONCLUSIONS

The conclusions below are based on the test results contained in
this report and correlation with reported results on similar materials.
More meaningful conclusions regarding Incoloy 800 will undoubtedly be
forthcoming as additional material, irradiation, and testing variables
are investigated.

1. Enhanced postirradiation ductility can be achieved for
Incoloy 800. Maximum ductility is obtained for a concentration of
0.1% Ti, and this optimum titanium level is independent of carbon content

over the range of 0.03 to 0.12%.

2. The ratio of titanium to carbon content is unimportant to the
postirradiation ductility of Incoloy 8COC.

3. Grain size markedly affects the postirradiation strength and
ductility of Incoloy 800 at 700°C. Decreasing grain size improves
ductility and reduces strength. The increased ductility may be explained
by helium distribution or grain boundary fracture considerations.

4, Aging Incoloy 800 before irradiation to agglomerate grain
boundary carbide has no effect on the properties at 760°C but broadens
the ductility vs titanium concentration peak at 700°C. This might
allow a wider titanium specification for desired material behavior at
this temperature.

5. Creep-rupture testing after irradiation is essential to the
evaluation of Incoloy 800 for nuclear applications. Postirradiation
ductility of certain compositions increases with decreasing strain rates
(stress levels). All levels of titanium produce essentially the same
postirradiation tensile ductility.

6. Widely varying creep-rupture properties both before and after
irradiation are obtained for alloys within the Incoloy 800 composition
specification. A close control of titanium content and grain size is
imperative for elevated-temperature properties that are both desirable

and predictable.
