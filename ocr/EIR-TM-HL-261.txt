Introduction

In the recent time the discussion about the breeding efficiency of
fast breeders is dealing with the difficulties of obtaining a reaso-

nable doubling time for nuclear power.

In this paper the search for a significant improvement of both of
these parameters, and therefore of the doubling time, is aimed to a
design of a molten chloride fast breeder reactor, with as good

as possible doubling time characteristics.

This can be achieved by rather trivial improvements. But here it
must be stressed that most of these improvements can be realised
only in a fast reactor with liquid fuel and especially in molten

plutonium chlorides.

1) The breeding gain 1s very sensitive to the hardness of the
neutron spectrum in the core. Because in the molten fuel reactor
it is possible to use fissile material also with elimination of

fertile haterial, the spectrum can be rather hard.

The impact of elimination of tne fertile nuclide from the core

e.g. on the Doppler-effect will be discussed later.

2. Because of hard spectrum the bonus of fast fission in fertile

nuclides is high, wnich improves the breeding gain.

3. The elimination of structural material from the core in case

of out-of-core cooling improves the neutron balance,

L, Decrease of the fission products concentration because of

continous reprocessing, improves the neutron balance,

5. Doubling time, more than breeding gain characterises the effi=-
ciency of breeding process or for linear increasing power system

the conservation coefficient which equals
. . P S
Gain x (Specific Power)

The specific power in a liquid fuel reactor can be achieved on a
level lower than 1 kg Pu tot/MWther, for the whole system:

core + external heat exchanger + reprocessing plant.

This preliminary report gives some selected datas about such a type

of power reactor.

This datas are calculated on the following basis:

- ANISN reactor code
- 23 neutron groups taken from GGC-3
condensed from ENDF/B III

- 7 zones with 110 intervals

- fourth order of quadrature, Sq

- anisotropy by first order Legendre expansion, P1

- 1instead of F.,P, cross sections, here the datas for Cs-133,

have been used.

The neutron flux in the reference reactor is shown in fig. 3, 3'
and 4.

The thermal flux in all three zones, external breeding zone, fuel
and external breeding zone is only 10-8 of the total flux and only
in external blanket zone arrives 10-6.

The total flux is relatively smoth distributed and also in the fuel
zone the maximum to the mean value of the flux achieves approx

1,13 (fig. 3').

The neutron_flux is rather hard and the median energy of neutrons

(here estimated as that to the left and to the right of this value

the number of fission is equal) is approximately ~370 KeV (see fig. 4).
In a typical liquid metal fast breeder and in gas cooled fast breeder

this value equals: 120 KeV and 176 KeV respectively.

As a good illustration of the impact of the most important parameters
on the value of breeding ratio a simplified calculation is given
on the table 2., The discrepancy between this calculations and

the computer output is of 8%.

Impact of the plutonium contents in the fuel

One of the most important problems in achieving a high breeding
ratio seems to be the hardness of the neutron flux, this is strongly

influenced by the composition of the fuel,
In this case the fuel has been postulated to be a mixture of

a PuCl, * b NaCl » ¢ UC1

5 3

a = 0,1 - 0,2 b =0,7 - 0,8 c = 0,1 - 0,2
Unfortunately not all datas for this system are available (fig. 5).

The rough calculation of the changing concentration of PuCl3 in the
melt with NaCl (fig. 6) shows a rather sharp decrease of breeding
gain BG for decreasing plutonium concentration, especially when the

plutonium molar ratio to the sodium is lower than 0,25.

In spite of these uncertainties of the P‘uClB-NaCl—UCl3 system here
has been calculated the impact of uranium-238 in the fuel., For a
constant PuCl3 concentration, with simplified correction of NaCl

concentration, the results are given on the fig. 7.

For the increasing ratio of uranium to plutonium in fuel from 0 to 3
the total breeding gain increases from 0,65 to 0,95. It is a rather
clear situation; and therefore the reference reactor includes uranium

in fuel 1n a ratio of 2:1 to the plutonium.

Problem of geometry:

Central breeding zone versus central fuel zone

The reference reactor 1is a rather nonconventional one because of

three zones structure:

- internal blanket zone
- fuel zone

- external blanket zone

This type of reactor has been checked with the conventional type
(table 2). For all other more or less constant parameters, inclusive
total power, the obtained results for breeding gain are equal. But
the difference is to see in the specific power changes more than one
order of magnitude, being higher in the '"conventional" central fuel
zone reactor. It is trivial that also the mean neutron flux increases

from 1,2+10%% om %5~

17

for nonconventional central blanket zone to

approx 2+107'n cm_25-1 for the conventional central fuel zone.

Because the specific power and intensity of neutron flux is
doubtless a very serious problem from point of view of ingeneering
design of the reactor (cooling, radiation damage of structural
material and fuel) the both systems that is without internal
blanket zone and with radius up to 110 cm have been calculated,

The results are giVen on fig. 8 for fuel without uranium and with
uranium in fuel for both extrem cases; no internal blanket zone and

by internal blanket zone.

From all

o the simplified calculation of internal zone breeding ratio,

table 3.

increase of the internal breeding zone from zero up to 110 cm

ratio in fuel and external zone breeding ratio is shown

these datas the following conclusions can be obtained:

increases the breeding gain for given type of fuel, wall and

fertile material only unsignificant, less than 10% relative,

the specific power increases dramatically and makes the solution

of in the design very difficult.

the increase of U/Pu ratio from 2 up to 3,6 does not influence

the total breeding gain (see fig. 10).
