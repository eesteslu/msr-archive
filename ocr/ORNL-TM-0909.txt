PREFACE

The report on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has been
arranged into twelve major parts as shown below. Each of these covers

a particular phase of the project, such as the design, safety analysis,

- operating procedures, ete. An attempt has thus been made to avoid much

of the duplication of material that would result if separate and inde-
pendent reports were prepared on each of these major aspects.

Detailed references to supporting documents, working drawings, and
other information sources have been made throughout the report to make
it of maximum value to ORNL personnel. Fach of the major divisions of
the report contains the bibliographical and other appendix information
necessary for that part.

The final volumes of the report, Part XII, contain rather extensive
listings of working drawings, specifications, schedules, tabulations,
etc. These have been given a limited distribution.

Most of the reference material is available through the Division
of Technical Imformation Extension, Atomic Energy Commission, P.0O. Box
62, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. For material not available through this source,
such an inter-Laboratory correspondence, etc., special arrangements can
be made for those having a particular intereSt.,

None of the information contained in this report is of a classified
nature.

MSRE DESIGN AND OPERATIONS REPORT

Part IX
SAFETY PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY PLANS

A. N. Smith

1. Introduction

The operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is subject
to normal industrial hazards, such as fire, explosion, and airborne con-
tamination, as well as to hazards peculiar to the production of nuclear
energy. Emergencies may arise involving danger to personnel or damage
to property.

The purpose of this section of the Design and Operations Report is
to provide basic guidelines, procedures, and background information that
will assist MSRE and supporting personnel in the anticipation; prevention,

and handling of emergencies.

2. Basic Plan

The basic emergency plan for the MSRE is the Laboratory-wide ORNL
emergency plan set forth in the ORNL Emergency Manual. All the material

presented here either emphas1zes basic precepts of the Laboratory=W1de

| plan or covers 1tems SpGlelc to the MSRE The ORNL Emergency'anual is

cons1dered part of and the ba51c gulde for all MSRE emergency plans.

 

3. Emergency FPhilosophy

- The fundamental concepts of*the'ORNL emergeney plan_are:

Lo Effectlve planning and preparatlon |

(a) Antlclpation of foreseeable hazards,
“(b) Adoption of preventlve measures
5(e)- Preparat1on for emergen01es by adequate organization and

training of personnel

 
 

2.

of
l.
2.

Effective handling of emergencies

(a) Prompt local action

(b) Coordination of emergency efforts, both local and

Laboratory wide

(¢) Definite assignment of responsibilities

For all personnel involved in the discovery and subsequent handling
an emergency, the primary considerations shall be:

Protection of personnel.

Protection of property.

It is recognized that situations may arise wherein it will be diffi-

cult to evaluate the potential hazards. The policy shall he to handle
doubtful cases conservatively; that is, it will be better to risk am

occasional "false alarm” than to risk exposing personnel and property to

unnecessary danger. The incidence of such occasions will be minimized

by adequate preparation and training,

b

 

 

4.1 ILocal Emergency Supervisor

 

The Local Emergency Supervisor will be the MSRE Shift Supervisor on

duty. The first alternate will be the MSRE Assistant Shift Supervisor,
and the second alternate will be the MSRE Control Room Operator.

1.

- The responsibilities of the Local Emergency Supervisor are:

To become thoroughly familiar with local and Laboratory-wide emer-
gency procedures.

To organize and train Local Emergency Squad members who are under
his jurisdiction.

To direct the efforts of the Iocal Emergency Squad in the handling
of local emergencies.

To keep the Laboratory Emergency Director and MSRE Operations Chief
fully informed of the status of the emergency.

‘w
 

)

.’) ¥

4.2. Local Emergency Squad

The Local Emergency Squad will consist of the members of the operat-
ing crew on duty and the local Health Physics Division surveyor on duty.
The responsibility of the Local Emergency Squad is to carry out emergency
duties as assigned (or preassigned) by the Local Emergency Supervisor or
fhe Laboratory Emergency Director. Some or all of the operating crew
members will be assigned duties as wardens or searchers. (See ORNL Emer-
gency Manual.) The Health Physics Surveyor(s) will be responsible for

checking for personnel contamination and overexposure.

4.3. Emergency Service Units

 

Emergency service units (fire, ambulance, health physics, etc.) are
available to assist in handling emergencies (see Part III-F in ORNL Emer-
gency Manual). Some units will respond automatically upon receipt of a
given emergency signal. Any unit may be summoned by calling the Iabora-
tory Emergency Control Center (phone 3-6358) or the Laboratory Emergency
Director (phone 3-6606) .

4.4, Laboratory Emergency Director

During an emergency the ILaboratory Shift Supervisor on duty will
become the lLaboratory Emergency Director. The responsibilities of the

Iaboratory Emergency Director are outlined in Part III-B, ORNL Emergency

Manual.

 

4.5. Emergency Control Cenfer'a

As used hereln, the term Emergency Control Center refers to the
permanent communication, alarm, and, dlspatchlng facility at Building
2500, which is operated by the Guard Department. The emergency_command
post at the MSRE will be referred to as the Local Emergency Control Cen-

-ter, whlch will normally be the MSRE Control Room. If the MSRE Control

Room must be evacuated the Local Emergency Control Center ylll be set

up at the nearest suitable locatlon, normally on Nblton Valley Drive

~ directly to the north of Building 7503, and the Laboratory Emergency

 
 

4

Director or the Emergency Control Center will be requested to furnish a

radio-equipped vehicle for transmission of commumnications.

 

4,6. Local Administration

The administration of emergency plans and procedures at the MSRE
will be under the direction of the MSRE Operations Chief. His responsi-
bilities in this regard ﬁill be to coordinate and supervise the overall
planning-and training program, including
1. Anticipation o; potential emergenéies.

2. Adoption of preventive measures.
3. Training of personnel.
4. Review and updating of emergency procedures.

5. Inspection and maintenance of emergency equipment.

5. Emergency Procedures

 

Procedures for handling emergencies at the MSRE shall be as noted
in the General Emergency Plan (see ORNL Emergency Manual). The following
procedures are intended to incorporate the basic principles of the General

Emergency Plan as applied to the MSRE operation.

5.1. General

The person who discovers an emergency will
l. Evacuate personnel from the immediate danger area.
2. Take any possible action to control the emergency.
3. Notify the MSRE Control Room by the fastest method, normally
the intercom or telephone. |
The MSRE Control Room Operator will
1. Notify the Local Emergency Supervisor and the Local Emergency Sguad,
2. Maintain control of the reactor; make any changes in the operation
- of the reactor or the chemical processing plant required by the
emergency; and keep the MSRE Shift Supervisor informed, in advance,
if possible.
3. Take any other immediate action required by the emergency, such as

activation of fire or radiation alarms.

-

£)

)

The Local Emergency Supervisor will

1. Proceed to the local Emergency Control Center, which is normally the
MSRE Control Room. If the 7503 Building must be evacuated, the
ILocal Emergency Control Center will be set up on the road directly
to the north of Building 7503, and the Laboratory Emergency Director
will be'requeéted to furnish communications facilities (radio car).

2. Take additional action as required by the emergency, including
issuance of evacuation instructions over the public address (PA)
system and direction of the Local Emergency Squad.

3. Notify MSRE Operations Chief and the Laboratory Shift Supervisor as
soon as possible. ,

4. Meet and orient the Iaboratory Emergency Director and Emergency
Service Units (fire department, ambulance) when they arrive on the
scene.

The Local Emergency Squad Members, unless directly involved in com-
bating the emergency or in carrying out preassigned emergency duties,
will report at once to the ILocal Emergency Control Center for assignment
to emergency duty by the Local Emergency Supervisor.

A1l other day and shift personnel will
1. Observe the prescribed building evacuation procedure.

2. Assist in handling the emergency if and as requested by the Local

Emergency Supervisor.

5.2, Pbrsonnel Evacuation Procedures

 

 

'5.2;1._ Local Emergency.,_Axglven emergency may require the evacua-

'tion'of (1) all MSRE personnel'qr'(z) only nonoperating personnel. The

sigpal for local evacuationfofspersonnel may be given in one of three

o ways:

" 1. Fire alarm horn.

2;- Radiation alarm horn and - beacon 1ight

3. Bulldlng pdblic address system.'

Sounding of either alarm will normally be followed by approprlate

instructions over the PA system. “(Note: The s1gnal.for a Laboratory-

wide evacuation is a siren-like wail followed by instructions over the
PA system.)

 
 

The alarm and PA systems are described in Section 7.
Upon hearing the evacuation signal
1. All personnel, except Local Emergency Squad members, will leave the
building. .

2. Iocal Emergency Squad members, barring PA system instructions to the
contrary, will proceed at once, as noted above, to the LOCAI Emer-
gency Control Center for assignment to emergency duty by the Local
Emergency Supervisor. _

In general, the direction taken by evacuating personnel shall be
the shortest path away from the danger zone. Subject to this condition
and barring contrary instructions over the PA system, the normal evacua-
tion routes are as noted below and as illustrated on Fig. 5.1:

1. Personnel in Building 7509 will leave by the east door. |

2. Personnel in the office section of Building 7503 (852-ft level) will
leave by the door at the north end of the office section corridor.

‘3. Personnel in the high bay area of Building 7503 (852-ft level) will
leave by the nearest door (north or east). Those leaving by the
east door will proceed as in item 2 above.

4. Personmnel in the basement area of Building 7503 will leave by the
nearest door (exterior stairway) on east side or door at northwest
corner.

5. Personnel in outlying buildings (vent house, storeroom, diesel house)

will proceed to Melton Valley Drive through the west crash gate or %
through the north turnstile via the stairway at the northwest corner |
of Building 7503. - a

6. All personnel will assemble at the parking area outside the north
gate (Assembly Point No. 1) and await further instructions from the
Local Emergency Supervisor. If the evacuation was initiated by a
radiation alarm and if immediate instructions are not forthcoming
from the Local Emergency Supervisor, all personnel will proceed as

' rapidly as possible along Melton Valley Drive in the upwind or cross-
wind direction (east or west, whichever more closely agrees with the
direction pointed to by the weathervane 1ocatéd on top of the poie
approximately 50 ft north of east end of the office building, 7509). &5)

5.2.2. Nonlocal Emergency. Interarea or Laboratory-wide situations
may arise, for example, a radiation incident at the HFIR or an air alert,
vhich might require short-term or long-térm evacuation of personnel from
the MSRE area. The procedure in these cases will be as outlined in the
ORNL Emergency Manual, with emphasis on the following key points:

1. If time permits, the reactor and other operating equipment will be

shut down or otherwise secured.

2. Personnel will then proceed in accordance with the Laboratory Emer-

gency Director's instructions.
The Local Emergency Supervisor will be responsible for coordinating the
execution of these instructions. |

Instructions and emergency signals (see Part IV-B of ORNL Emergency

Manual) from the Laboratory Emergency Director will be transmitted over
| , _

the MSRE PA system (see Sect. 7.3).

6. Description of Possible Local Emergencies
and Plans of Action

 

It is assumed that the general emergency plan will be followed in
meeting any of the following possible emergencies; therefore only specilal
information and suggestions applying to each particular emergency are
given, |

6.1. Fire

 

The known fire hazards are the lube-oll packages in the service
tunnel, the diesel-generator oil-storage tank, and the hydrogen-storage
tanks and piping in the fuel processing system. Prompt action can keep
a small fire from growing into a large one. However, safety of the per-
sonnel must always come first. No one may enter an area alone where he
might be trapped or overcome; he must wait until assisting personnel
arrive to stand by with reserve extinguishers and other equipment as
required. The alerting of personnel will normelly be by means of the
fire alarm horn supplemented by an announcement over the PA system (see

Sect. 7 for description of fire protection and communications systems).
 

L}

wi

1)

")

2

The person who discovers a fire will take immediate action to pro-
tect personnel and property. Normal action will be as follows:

1. Pull the nearest auxiliary fire aiarm.box.

2. Remove personnel from the immediate danger zone. Depending on cir-
cumstances this step may supersede step 1.

3. Call the Local Emergency Supervisor (normally the fastest method
will be to éall the control room operator who will relay the message)
and give a brief description of the location and the nature of fire.

The Iocal Emergency Supervisor will

1. Call the fire department (if not already done) by actuating one of
the auxiliary fire alarm boxes.

2. Dispatch an operator to the road on the north side of Building 7503
to meet the firemen and direct them to the scene of the fire.

3. Alert all personnel via the PA system and, if necessary, issue in-
structions for evacuation.

Order any changes in reactor operation necessitated by the emergency.

5. Take any possible steps to control the fire until the fire depart-
ment arrives.

6. When the fire department arrives, coordinate efforts of the lLocal

Emergency Squad with those of the fire department.

6.2. Radiation Emergency

 

The amount of radiation absorbed will vary directly with the time
of exposure and inversely as the square of the distance from the source

(refer to the ORNL,Raaiation'Safety and Control Training Manual). There-

-fore, in a radiation émérgency, personnel must be moved to a safe dis-

tance as rapidly as possible. =

High radiation in the building mey come either from a confined

~ source or from airborne r&diéadtivgfmaterials. The former may be de-

‘tected by one or more of the Monitrons and the latter by one or more of

the constant air moﬁitors (caM). (Refer to Sect. 7 for a discussion. of

-' the:radiation instruments anqialarm*éystem.) ‘The circuits are arranged

so that coincident high-level signals to two Monitrons or two CAM's will

 
 

10

actuate the building evacuation alarm. In addition, switches for manual
activation of the building evacuation system are provided. (See Sect.
T b d)

The person who discovers high radiation (should such a situation
arise without automatic alarm response) will actuate the building evacua-
tion alarm manually or notify the Iocal Emergency Supervisor.

- The Local Emergency Supervisor will
1. Actuate the building evacuation alarm (if not already actuated).
2. Announce 'Radiation Emergency — All Nonoperating Personnel Evacuate'
three times over the PA system.

3. Dispatch two men to determine the sources and extent of the hazard.

| ol

These men should wear assault masks until they have determined that
there is no airborne activity. They will carry portable radiation
detection instruments and will check the air monitoring instruments
immediately.

4. Check to make sure that the Health Physics Surveyor has been notified
(normally, the building evacuation alarm will be relayed automatically
to the Emergency Control Center, which will notify the Health Physics
Department and the Laboratory Emergency Director).

5. Assign an Emergency Squad Member as a group leader for nonoperating
personnel. The group leader will check the fadiation level at the
assembly point, issue or interpret evacuation instructions, and

where necessary, render first aid or request additional help.

M

6. Dispatch Emergency Squad Members to check the area to make sure per-

sonnel have been evacuated. | 2
7. Make any operating changes, such as scramming the reactor or shutting

down ventilating fans, necessitated by the emergéncy.

Upon hearing the building evacuation alarm or the PA system announce-
ment, Emergency Squad Members, unless alrea&y engaged in combating the
emergency, will report immediately to the lLocal Emergency Control Center,
and all nonoperating personnel will leave the bullding immediately and
assemble at the roadside directly north of Building 7503.7 If immediate
‘instructions to the contrary are not received from an Emergency Squad

Member or over the PA system, the nonoperating personnel'will proceed as &ij

rapidly as possible away from the area in the upwind or crosswind di-
rection and keep going until advised by an Emergency Squad Member or a
Health Physics Surveyor that they are out of the danger zone. (Note: A
wind direction arrow that points in the upwind direction is located on
a pole near the northeast corner of the 7509 Office Building,)
The following rules will be observed regarding radiation exposure

levels:
1. Nonoperating personnel must evacuate any area when level is 27.5

mrem/hr on the Monitrons or 21000 counts/min on the CAM's.

2. All personnel must evacuate from any area where the total absorbed

 

dose is likely to exceed 300 mrem, except that the Local Emergency
Supervisor and the Control Room Operator may remain long enough to
shut down the reactor, provided their radiation dosage will not ex-
ceed 3000 mrem.
As soon as the level and extent of the radiation have been determined
by portable survey meters, the Local Emergency Supervisor will
1. Issue additional instructions regarding personnel evacuation.
2. Take any additional steps necessary to limit the radiation release
and to prevent overexposure to personnel.
3. See that health physics checks are provided for all persomnnel in-

volved in the incident.

6.3. High Stack Activity

 

A situation mlght occur (for example, a gross leak in the charcoal

bed piping) whereby hazardous quantities of radiocactivity would be re-

rloased to the off-gas stack..rThe'dangers involved may be_dlrect exposure

-to‘penetrating radiation'(as ffgm a cloud of activity), inhalation of

active particles from the contaminated atmosphere, or both. Immediate

“action must be taken to ;
1. Mlnlmlze the quantlty of act1v1ty released.

2. ‘Protect personnel from overexposure to external and 1nternal radia-

tlon L ,
High stack'&cti#ity will be detected by the stack monitorihg ine

strumentation (see Sect. 7.4.3) and indicated by an annunciator and re-

 
 

12

corders in the MSRE Control Room and an annunciator and recorders at the
Waste Monitoring Control Center at Building 3105 (see Sect. 7.4.3). For
the purpose of the following discussion, high stack activity will be

assumed to be due to the release of hazardous quantities of activity,

as reflected by instrument readings at Building 3105 and related evidence

at the MSRE.

Upon indication of high stack activity, the Local Emergency Super-
visor will
1. Reduce the reactor power level to zero. ,

2. Report the incident to the Emergency Control Center.

3. Ask the Emergency Control Center to send Health Physics Surveyors
(if surveyors are not already on hand).

4, Use PA system to announce the emergency and to request all personnel
(except those involved in combating the emergency) to assenble at
the northwest corner of the 7503 building basement (840-ft level) if
this action appears necessary.

5. Dispatch two Emergency Squad Members equipped with assault masks and
portable radiation meters to check outside the building and assess
the nature and extent of the hazard. \

Further action will depend on an assessment of the hazard that in-
corporates the combined judgment of the Local Emefgency Supervisor, the
Laboratory Emergency Director, the Health Physics Surveyors and the |
Laboratory Facilities Representative. Possible steps might be to
1. Switch to the standby charcoal bed. |
2. Drain the reactor.

3. Shut down the ventilating fans.

4. Evacuate all personnel from the site.

Coordination of emergency action for neighboring facilities, towns,
etc. that ﬁight be endangered by the release will be handled by the
Laboratory Emergency Director.

 

6.4. Beryllium Release

Beryllium is an extremely toxic material. Toxic effects may result

from inhalation or from contact with the skin. Current concentration

O

"
 

£}

)

13

limits for beryllium (see Sect. 7.5) for workers without respiratory
proteetion are as follows:
Continuous exposure (40-hr week) <2 pg/m?

Short-term exposure (<30 min) Not greater than 25 pg/m?
Situations might occur whereby hazardous quantities of beryllium
would be released; for exsmple, by rupture of a radiator tube with subse-
quent discharge of coolant salt from the radiator stack or rupture of the
coolant pump discharge line. Evidence of beryllium release may be given

by the radiator stack beryllium monitor or may be implied by responses
of various operatioﬁal instruments.

The person who discovers a real or apparent beryllium release will
immediately notify the Local Emergency Supervisor, who will

1. Announce the emergency over the PA system, instruct personnel who
muist remain in the danger zone to put on suitable respiratory pro-
tection and protective clothing, and ask all remaining persennel to
evacuate from the danger zone (see Sect. 5.2). Evacuees will be
asked to report to a convenient assembly point to be screened for
overexposure and clothing contamination.

2. Call the Emergency Control Center and ask the dispatcher to notify
the Industrial Hygiene Department and the Iaboratory Emergency Di-
rector.

3. Make any operating changes required by the emergency.

4. With the advice and assistance of the Industrial Hygiene Department,
‘take any additional Steﬁs”necessary‘to'define the level and extent

of theddanger zone and protect‘personnel from overexposure.

6.5. Gross Leak into Reactor'Cell

Rupture of a portlon of the fuel-01rculat1ng system mlght result in

5cond1tions approaching the so-called max1mum.credible aceident (see Part

_ V of this ‘report). Large quantities of activity might leak into the

hlgh bay area and thence to the atmosphere. An emergency of this type

would be eV1denced by

1. A sudden rise in secondary containment cell pressure to some point

above atmosphere.

 
 

 

 

o

14

2. A sudden rise in secondary containment cell temperature.

3. Sudden decrease in fuel pump bowl level and pressure.

4. Activation of building evacuation alarm system, This will be a de-
layed reaction dependent on the rate of escape of activity from the
cell, |

In view of the possible serious consequences to personnel, the simulta-

neous occurrence of symptoms 1, 2, and 3 should be treated as a maximum

credible accident unless absolute assurance to the contrary is available.

In the event of an accident of the maximum credible type, the Local

"

Emergency Supervisor will

1. Actuate the building evacuation alarm.

2. Announce 'ijor Release in Reactor Cell —~ All Nonoperating Personnel
Evécuate" three times over the PA system (see Sect. 5.2).

3. Dispatch two Emergency Squad Members wearing assault masks and carry-
ing radiation survey instruments to make a rapid check of all build-
ings and insure that all personnel have evacuated. |

4. Notify the Emergency Control Center of the nature of the emergency
and, if necessary, request additional help.

If radiation levels will permit (see Sect. 6.2), the Local Emergency

Supervisor will also take any operational steps possible to minimize the

extent of the release., If the radiation exceeds tolerable levels, he

will evacuate all remaining personnel to a safe distance from the site.

This section includes background information pertinent to the han-
dling of emergencies at the MSRE. Much of the necessary background
material is, or will be, covered in detail in other parts of the MSRE
Design and Operations Report, referred to hereunder as "this report"

(see Preface). Cross references will be used wherever practical.

7.2. Personnel Access Control

7.2.1. Purpose. During zero-power nuclear experiments, experimen-

tal operation at low power, and thereafter, access to the MSRE operations
area will be controlled in the interests of safety and security. The
specific purposes of access controls are |
1. To insure that any person in the area has at least a minimal acquainte :

ance with area regulations and conditions.

3

2. To avoid interference with operations or undue distraction of the
operators.
3. To prevent unauthorized removal of material or equipment.

(With regard to the last point, there will be no classified docu-
ments in the area and the SS material will be in either an inaccessible
form or locked in a safe.)

7.2.2. Bounds of MSRE Operations Area. Figure 7.5 shows the layout

of the MSRE area, with emphasis on the fences and the openings for ve-

 

hicles and personnel. The North Gate is & wide vehicular gate with a
pedestrian turnstile beside it. A wide paved area extends directly into
the crane bay of the reactor building for convenient delivery of heavy

" loads. The West and South Gates are vehicular gates. A crash gate in

o

the west fence provides an emergency exit in that direction.

The office building provides a route into and out of the area on

e

the east. For the purposes of personnel access control, the office
building is regarded as being outside the area. This makes the door be-
tween the 7509 office area and the vestibule the boundary of the MSRE
alrea.

7.2.3. ‘Categories of Personnel. The people vho may at one time or

 

another be in the area can be divided into three categories:
I. Persons Regularly Working in Area
These are people with full-time work assignments in the area

 

Af\ \1
and others who require regular or frequent access to the area. TFor - Q J -

a person to be in this category it is also a requirement that his
assignment be relatively long-térm (more than one month). Persons
in Category I must be acquainted with the layout of the area, the
nature of the hazards associated with MSRE operation, emergency
evacuation signals and procedures, and the procedures and restric-
tions that apply to his work in the area. These persons are also
expected to be informed on the status of operations, particularly
with regard to any special hazards that may exist or any special
restrictions that may be in effect.
IT. Persons Temporarily or Infrequently in Area

These are people who are assigned to work in the area for a
short time (one month or less) or Who may need to enter the area
only infrequently (once a week or less).

ITI. Visitors

These are people who enter the area and are not in Categories
I or IT.

7.2.4. Authorizations. Lists of Category I persons will be posted
at the guard post, in the reactor control room, and beside the door from
the office building into the area. These lists will be updated as nec-
essary by the head of the MSRE Operations Department.

Lists of Category II people will be kept at the same locations.
When changes are necessary, the lists will updated. Figure 7.6 shows
typical headings for the Category I and Category II lists.

7.2.5. - Procedure. ,Category I'and IT persons will be admitted at
sny time, and they can move freely about the area (within the limits im-
pdsed by radiation and'Contamihatioﬁ,,of course)., Category IIT ﬁersbns

will be admdftedgonly"when theirivisit is SPeéifically authorized at the

time by someone with the proper authority. The people who can authorize
‘entry of Category'III'perSOns are'certain Category I persons designated
- by the Operatlons Department HEad and 50 1ndicated on the Category I

Illsts. When one of- these people authorizes the entry of a Category III

-person, he is responsible for seeing that the visitor is properly es-

corted and that his movements are properly controlled..

The West and the South Gates will be kept locked except when a
vehicle must enter or leave. The North Gate will also be locked except
while attended by a guard. The Fast (outer) door of the office building
will be locked at night and on weekends when the normal staff is ﬁot
present. The doors between the office building and the reactor building
will not be locked.

While a guard is on duty, he will admit authorized personnel through
the North Gate or the West Gate. (Traffic through the West Gate will be
held to 2 minimum.) Persons on either Category I or Category II Lists
will be admitted at once. Wheﬁ others seek admittance, the guard will
use the phone to contact someone in the area who can authorize the visi-
tor's entrance.

Control of traffic through the office building at times when the
East door is unlocked will depend on signs posted in the office building.
A large sign, "CONTROLLED ACCESS AREA — DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION, "
will be on the door from the office building to the vestibule. Instruc-
tions for visitors, radiation meter requirements, and current lists of
authorized persons will be posted beside this door.

When the guard is not on duty, the MSRE Shift Supervisdr will be
responsible for controlling access to the area. Persons wishing to en-
ter during off hours must come to the East door of the office building,
where there is a switch that sounds a doorbell in the reactor control
room. One of the operating crew will admit the person and, if he is an
unlisted v1sitor, will escort him to the MSRE Shift Supervisor. If a

| vehlcle must enter or exit. through the North Gate or West Gate, the MSRE
- Shift Superv1sor will call_the_Guard Department (phone 3f6646),-and a

. guard will come and-ﬁnlock:thefgate.  ('The seeurity locks on these gates
 can be,opened only by a guefd,);“,' o

 

7.3, Communlcatlons Systems -

3_ Three systems are available at the MSRE for transmlttlng local com-
minications (see Dwg D-KK-C- 55114) |

- 7.3.1. Intercom Phones. . The intercommunlcatlon phones form an

 

essentially closed-circuit "hot line" (referred to as the "common line").

 
 

 

24

In other words, communication may be effected between any and all sta-
tions by merely lifting the respective receivers. One station may call
another by dialing the desired station number (the bell rings once each
time the number is dialed), but it is not necessary to dial to connect
to the line. ;

The normal power for the intercom phones comes from the TVA line
(panel 2, Auxiliary Control Room). Backup pover is available from the
250-v battery station and from the diesel-generator station.

A white signal 1ight is located at each phone station. The lights
at all stations are energized whenever therintercomlline is in service.

7.3.2. Public Address System. Loudspeakers are located so as. to
permit the transmission of messages to all parts of the MSRE area, both

 

indoors and outdoors. The system is normally used for paging and routine

announcements. In an emergency the system is used for transmitting emer-

gency information and instructions. Emergency announcements would nor-
mally be made from the MSRE Control Room, but they could be made from
any of the several phone sets equipped with the PA system switch. .All
PA system phones also serve as intercom phones (some units are three-

purpose, i.e., PA, intercom, and standard dial). In order to use a

phone for public address, it is necessary to turn (depress on some units)

the PA selector switch to the proper position and then hold a second

switch (or bar) in the depressed position while making the announcement.
A system is provided to permit the Laboratory Emergency Director,

Building 5000, or the Emergency Control Center, Building 2500, to make

‘announcements or to sound emergency signals (see Part IV-B of ORNL Emer-

gency Manual) over the MSRE PA system. This might be necessary, for
example, in the e%ent of a Laboratory-wide emergency. The circuit to
the MSRE also includes the other Melton Valley facilities (HFIR, Tower
Shielding, 7500, HPRR). Announcements from the Laboratory Emergency
Director or the Emergency Control Center will override local MSRE an-

nouncements, except those made from the MSRE Control Room PA station.

7.3.3. Standard Dial Phones. Standard Bell System dial telephones

are located in the MSRE Control Room and in all offices.

7.4. Radiation Monitoring Systems

 

Radiation detecting instruménts at the MSRE are of three types:
(1) health physics instrumentation for personnel protection; (2) process
monitoring instrumentation to provide information relative to the operat-
ing condition of various components and to indicate the validity of fhe
containment system, and (3) off-gas stack monitors to guard against the
discharge of excessive quantities of radioactivity to the atmosphere.
7.4.1. Health Physics Instrumentation. The purpose of the health

physics instrumentation is to protect MSRE personnel from overexposure

 

to radiation due to airborne and fixed-source activity. The Instruments
fall into two general classes. '

1. TFixed monitors, which require a 110-v ac power supply, are
stationed at specific, strategic locations. The models currently in
use at the MSRE are:?

Continuous air monitor (CAM), model Q-2240
Monitron, model Q-1154-B
Count rate meter, model Q-2091
Hand and foot counter, model Q-1939B
Locations of the various units are shown on Figs. 7.7 and 7.8.

The count rate meters are placed in contamination-free areas for
use in making clothing and.body surveys. However, when not used for
this purpose, they are left operating and serve as backup monitors for
the Monitrons. In two places, the water room and the vent house, their
primary purpose is area monitoring.  The CAM's and'Mbnitrohs are used
for aréa monitoring; the CAM'fégiSters airborne activity and the Monitron
. fixed-source activity._TheCAM's'and,Mbnitrons provide visible and audi-
- ble alarm[responée;:both'locallj_and in”the MSRE Control Room. The Con-
- trol Room'alaﬁm'Setuélinélﬁdés a system of lights to denote various
instrument conditions (see Table 7.1). In addition to the local and
Controerbom alarm syStems,:certain CAM's and certain Monitrons are con-
‘nected to the building_eVaCuation'alarm system {see Sect. 7.4.4). Each

CAM and each Monitron hasrtwb“alarm.settings, as follows:

7.4 2. Process Mbnitoring Instrumentation. The process radiation

 

monitoring system is designed to monitor certain key points in the re-
actor system to aid in the control and operation of the reactor. Detec-
tors are located on or near pipes and components to indicate radiation
levels and to'producelalarm‘or control signals when these levels exceed
a preset.value,“Fourteen G-M tubes and 12 ion chamber detectors are
used for process monitOring. For a detailed description of the process
monitoring system, refer to Part II of this report.

7.4 3 . Off-Gas Stack Monitoring System. A radiation detection
system.prov1des continuous monitoring of the gases passing out through
the off-gas stack (see Off-Gas Disposal System and Containment Ventila-

 

system.is handled entirely by the Laboratory Facilities Department - This .

'system is part of a Laboratory;wide system designed to control, w1thin

prescribed limits, the rate of discharge of radioactive contaminants to
the atmosphere. | |

| Three pumps‘serve to maintain three contlnuously recirculating gas |
sampling streams Each stream is w1thdrawn from the stack at a point |
about 40 £t above the. base, passes through the monitoring (or collecting)
device and the sam@le pump, and is then returned to the stack near the
base (see Fig. 7.9). One stream passes in series through a beta-gamma |
monitor and an'iodine monitor; one stream passes through an alpha moni-‘
tor; and the remalning stream passes through ‘a sample-collecting car-
tridge. '

_ The alpha and beta-gamma streams are passed through fllter-paper
tapes, and the particulate matter collected is monitored continuously by
count rate meters. The iodine is collected in a charcoal trap, which
is monitored by a count rate meter. The signals from the count rate
meters (displayed and recorded in the MSRE Auxiliary Control Room) are
tranSmitted.by telemetry to recorders in the Waste Monitoring Control
Center at Building 3105. The recorders are monitored visually on a
24-hr basis by Laboratory Facilities personnel.r

The Laboratory Facilities Department will notify MSRE Operations

whenever there is an indication of an abnormal increase in activity

The tape advance for the alpha and beta-gamma monitors is controlled

~ remotely (may also be done at the instrument) by the Laboratory Facilities
{'DePartménﬁ'(fram Bldg. 3105). The tapes are normslly advanced at the
. start of each shift. The iodine trap is of the cartridge type and may

- be easily replaced in case of saturation. The sample-collecting cartridge

1s changed once per day during reactor critical operation, and the used

- cartridge is scanned for activity.

7o e, Bulldlng Evacuatlon Alarm System. A system of audible and
visible alarms is prov1ded to alert personnel to the necessity for evac-
uation from the MSRE area (see Flg 7 10). The alarms may be actuated
manually or automatically.

There are three switches for manual actuation‘of the alarms: one

on the main console in the MSRE Control Room, one on the alarm module in

. the MSRE Auxiliary Control Room, and one in the Maintenance Control Room.

, If a manual switch has been used to actuate the alarm, the "reset” button

3

f on the control module must be depressed to restore the system to the

! normal conditions.

For automatic actuation, four of the CAM's and six of the Monitrons

(see Sect. 7.4.1) are connected to respective coincidence alarm modules

" in the MSRE Auxiliary Control Room. Coincident actuation of any two

high level alarms in one or the other of the two groups will cause auto-

matic actuation of the building evacuation alarm system (see Table 7.2).

®Coincidence of any two high-level alarms in the Monitron group or
the CAM group will cause automatic actuation of the building evacuation
alarm system.

A key-operated switch labeled "Normal-Disable" and located on the

"cbntro}fmodule_in therAuiiliary Controeroqm.may be used to disconnect
- the alarmsifromrthe'automatic”circuit. \This switch is for use during
-periods when high radiation levels would normally be anticipated (for

‘example, during removal of radiocactive equipment from the reactor cell)

and where personnel Safetyvmayrbe insured by'appliCatioﬁ.of:strict ad-

 ministrative control. _The,Emergency'COntrol Center receives an alarm

‘signal (and should receive ptior notification) when the switch is moved

to or from the disable position. The alarms'may be ‘sounded manually
regardless of the position of the Normal-Disable switch.

The audible alarm is given by four evacuation horns located as
shown on Figs. 7.7 and 7.8. The horns are activated by nitrogen gas,
and each horn has its own gas bottle supply and control box (see Fig.\
7.11). The control box contains a pressure valve, pressure switches
which monitor tank and regulated pressures, and a solenoid valve that
‘is opened by an electrical signal from the coincidénce module. A momen-
tary signai will open the sdlenoid valve, and the valve will remain open
until it is closed manually by depressing the mushroom head of the valve
stem. Normal gas pressures are:

| Tank pressure, psig 21500

Supply to solenoid, psig 80 to 120

Abnormal pressures are indicated by alarms in the Control Room. The gas

supply for each horn consists of two high-pressure nitrogen-gas bottles,

' o - )
The valve position on each

only one of which is normally valved "on. '
bottle is supervised by means of a lead-and-wire meter seal. One bottle
at 21500 psig contains sufficient gas to operate the horn for approxi-
mately 4 minutes.

The visible alarm is given by seven magenta-colored bgacon lights
located as shown on Figs. 7.7 and 7.8. They are automatically stopped
vhen the coincidence module has returned to a normal condition.

For a comprehensive discussion of the MSRE radiation and contamina-

tion detection and alarm system, see ref. 2.

7.5. Beryllium Control Program

 

A program for the control of beryllium hazards at the MSRE has been

7.6. Containment Ventilation System )

A schematic diagram of the contaimment ventilation system is shown
on Fig. 7.13. This system provides for the control of air flow and pres-
gsure in the secondary containment zone (the reactor and fuel drain tank
cells) and in the areas surrbundiﬁg the secondary containment zone (the
high bay area, special equipment room, ete.). _

During reactor operation, the primary air flow is through the high
bay area, which is maintained at s slight'negative pressure. The re-
actor cell is maintained at —2 psig by bleeding inleakage to the stack
from the component coolant pump discharge.

During reactor shutdowns, air may be exhausted from the reactor cell

or other areas by adjustment of valves or dampers. A minimum face veloc-

- 1ty of 100-ft/min is required through the opening into any contaminated

cell.

For a complete discussion of the contaimment ventilation system,
see Parts I and V of this report.

7.7. Reactor Off-Gas System

 

The reactor off-gas system includes piping, components, and instru-
mentation needed to handle the gas flow from the pumps, drain tanks, and
certain other points in the fuel and coolant systems (see Fig. 7.14).

For a complete discussion of the off-gas system, see Parts T and V
of this report.

 

7.8., Fire Protection System

A combination manual fire alarm and automatic fire detection system
is provided (see Fig. 7.15). Manual actuation of the fire alarm may be

Artomatic actuation of the fire alarm may be effected by either of
two detecting systems:. |
1. Combination rate of rise and fixed-temperature heat-actuated detector.
Three groups of these detectors are provided: a group of six over
the control room and data logger areas, a‘group of three over the
high bay area, and a group of four over the coolant drain pit area.
2. Flow-detector switch in the sprinkler system water supply line. The
switch is located on the 840-ft level near the north wall.
Actuation of e manual station or an automatic detector transmits a
signal to the fire alarm zone indicator and control cabinet (located at
the north end of the Building 7503 office corridor), which, in turn,
causes the following actlon: |
‘l. Actuation of the fire alarm horns. (If the alarm was initiated by
the sprinkler system, the sprinkler system alarm gongs will also
sound. )
2. Transmission of a signal to the Fire Station and to the Emergency
Control Center. ) o
3, TIllumination (on the control cabinet) of a light that indicates the
affected zone. o
In addition to zone lights, the control cabinet contains lights to
indicate normal, alarm, and test conditions and a switch to silence the
horns while the system is being tested.
A fusible-plug sutomatic sprinkler system serves the entire MSRE
area, with the following exceptions:
1. The Switch House.
2. The shielded cells (reactor, drain tank, etc.) under the high bay.
3. The Control Room and Data Logger Room (fusible plugs have been re-
moved). ‘
4. 'The 7509 (0ffice) Building (classed as fireproof).

The water supply lines to the sprinklers in the high bay area and
the special equipment room—coolant pit area are normally valved off.
These valves will be opened by Fire Department personnel only, normally
after consultation with the MSRE Local Emergency Supervisor or the MSRE
Operations Supervisor. The valves are supervised by valve position in-
dicators with a signal telemetered to the Fire Department.

In the Diesel House and Stores areas, the sprinkler piping is pro-
tected from cold weather damage by "dry" piping systems. A special con-
trol system keeps exposed portions filled with gas. If a fusible plug
melts, water is admitted, and the sprinklers operate in the normal fash-
ion.

Water supply for the sprinkler system comes from the potable water
main (840-ft level, north end of Building 7503). A connection is also
provided on the north side of Building 7503 (852-ft level, outside) for
a supplementary water supply (see Part I of this report).

Six hose cabinets (four on the 852-ft level and two on the 840-ft
level) plus strategically located portable extinguishers provide addi-
tional fire-fighting capacity. Each hose cabinet is equipped with 75 ft
of hose and a 15-1b COp extinguisher.

Operation and maintenance of the fire protection system is handled
entirely by the Fire'Department. (The hose cabinets and portable ex-
tinguishers may, if necessary, be operated by MSRE persomnnel.) The
pumper truck, the emergency truck, and available Fire Department per-

sonnel will normally respond to all fire alarms.
