ABSTRACT

Using a dilatometric method, densities were determined for the follow-
ing molten salts:

LiF-BeFy (66-34 mole %)

LiF-BeFy-ThF, (70.1-23.9-6.0, 70-18-12, 70-15-15 mole %)
LiF-BeFy-ZrF, (64.7-30.1-5.2 mole %)

LiF-BeFp-ZrF4-UF, (64.79-29.96~4.99-0.26 mole %)
NaBF;-NaF (92-8 mole %)

KNO3

The last salt was measured to assure the accuracy of the method; the densi-
ties measured for KNOj agreed within 0.15% with critically evaluated
densities obtained by Archimedean methods.

For the fluorides, molar volumes obtained from the density measure-
ments agreed within 27 with volumes calculated from additive contributions
of the components. The expansivities of three LiF-BeF)-ThF4 mixtures were
practically identical, 2.5 x 10~4/°c.

Density-temperature curves from 25-700°C for LiF-BeF2-ThFy (72-16-12
mole %) and for NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) were derived from room-temperature
pycnometric determinations and from estimated expamsivities of the solid
salts. The calculated expansion, upon melting, for the former is 7%, for
the latter 8Z.

Viscosities of three salt mixtures were determined by oscillating-cup
methods:

LiF—BeFZ—ThF4 (72,7-15.7-11.6, 70.1-23.9-6.0 mole %)
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %)

Viscosity measurements were conducted at Mound Laboratory, Miamisburg, Ohio,
using capsules and samples prepared at ORNL. The viscosities of the two
melts composed of LiF, BeFy, and ThF, were analogous to viscosities report-
ed for similar mixtures containing U#4 instead of ThF4.
DENSITY OF MOLTEN SALTS

The objectives of this investigation were: (a) to measure, with high
accuracy, densities and expansivities of several molten fluoride mixtures
that are significant to molten-salt reactors, (b) to derive additive molar
volume contributions which can serve to predict densities in
LiF-BeF)-(Th,U)F, molten solutions, (c) to estimate density changes upon
melting of the fuel-carrier and coolant salts of the molten-~salt breeder

reactor.
Experimental

Apparatus and Procedures: Densities were determined in a nickel dilato-
meter (Figure 1), the details of which have been previously described.l’2
In the apparatus a metal probe detects the changes in liquid level in the
neck of a volume-calibrated metal vessel. The escape of vapor is prevented
by a Teflon stopper, which also permits vertical displacement of the probe.
When the probe contacts the liquid surface, a vacuum-tube voltmeter changes
from an open circuit reading to a detectable resistance. The probe height
is measured to + 0.02 mm with a cathetometer. Through a side arm in the
neck of the vessel, an inert insoluble gas (argon) is introduced to sup-
press bubbles in the melt. By taking measurements at argon pressures of
approximately 5 atm, entrapped gas bubble volumes were reduced to less than

0.1% of the liquid sample.

After completing measurements at elevated tempefatures, the contents
of the vessel were removed and weighed to be certain that weight changes
had been negligible. For any sample measured, weight changes never exceed-
ed 0.05%Z. After each run, the dilatometric vessel was recalibrated at room
temperature with distilled water. The recalibrations indicated that the

nickel vessels sustained permanent expansions of about 0.2%.

Melt temperatures were controlled to + 0.2° by regulating the furnace
with a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax proportional controller. Temperatures
of the melt were determined with Pt-Rh thermocouples previously calibrated
by the National Bureau of Standards; these thermocouples are stated to be

accurate within 0.5° in the temperature range (400-820°C) of measurement.

Materials

The salt mixtures, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and LiF-BeFy-ZrF, (64.7-
30.1-5.2 mole %), were supplied by J. H. Shaffer, ORNL, from batches that
had beenASparged Ey Ho-HF gaseous treatment.3 By adding purified, crystal-
line LiF and UF,4 to the latter, we prepared LiF-BeFy-ZrF,-UF, (64.79-
29.96-4.99-0.26 mole 7). In the order given above, the three compositions

corresponded to the MSRE coolant, carrier salt, and fuel salt mixtures.

Mixtures of LiF-BeF)-ThF, (used in both density and viscosity measure-
ments) were constituted from LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), crystalline LiF, and
LiF-ThF, mixtures. The LiF-ThF,, retained from a previous density study,4
had been stored in a vacuum desiccator. The mixture, NaBF;-NaF (92-8 mole %),

. e 2
was constituted from the purified components. 0

Analytical-grade KNO3 (J. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, N.J.)
was used as received. Measurements of the salt were carried out primarily
for checking the accuracy of the dilatometric method used in the present

investigation.

Argon gas, used for suppressing bubbles in the melts (see above), was
obtained from Airco, Chester, W. Va. The gas was shown by mass spectro-
graphic analysis to exceed 99.9% in purity. Prior to entry into the
vessel, the gas was passed through molecular sieve to remove traces of

moisture.

All salt loadings were carried out in a glovebox filled with helium.
To insure that the liquid level reached into the neck of the vessel (see
Figure 1), two loadings were usually required; after melting the initial
charge of the salt, the vessel was returned to the glovebox for further

loading.
Results

The densities of seven fluoride mixtures were measured over about
a 200°C temperature range. The data are listed in Tables 1A - 1G; also
included are the least-squares equation and the densities calculated from
the equation. For each melt the plot of density versus temperature was

linear. Data for KNO,'l are given in Table 2,

The standard error in density was approximately 0.001 g/cm3, corres-
ponding to about 0.05%. Other sources of error (creep sustained by the
vessel, bubble volume, small amounts of salt condensed on the upper neck
of the vessel) increase the total error to + 0.3%Z. This percentage error
was determined by comparing our results with those of Bloom et §i47
Janz,8 in his critical review, judges the uncertainty in Bloom's results
to be about 0.27%; our results differ from those of Bloom by 0.15%. The

density-temperature equations for KNOg are:

Discussion

Additive Molar Volumes

 

The simplest, and often quite successful, way for estimating the
density of solutions is to assume that the volume of a mixture is the sum
of additive contributions of the component compounds. The additive con-
tributions are usually available from density measurements of the com-

ponents; the density - and hence the molar volumes, of LiF,4 ThF ? and

4?
BeF2lO have been reported by the author. At 550 and 700°C, the molar

volumes obtained from these investigations are:

Volume (cm3)

 

 

550°C 700°C
LiF 13.24 13.77
BeF 9 24.0 24.2
ThF, 46.15 47.00

Molar volumes of the three LiF-BeF)-ThF, mixtures and the LiF-BeF)
mixture were calculated from the values above; the calculated and experi-
mental molar volumes are compared in Table 3. Calculated volumes are ap-
proximately one percent greater than experimental values. The good agree-
ment is probably due to the small sizes and low polarizabilities of the

ions which comprise these mixtures,

The concentrations of ZrF4 and UF, in the two mixtures studied were

not large enough to test whether or not their molar volume contributions

mixtures containing these components were calculated using, in addition to

the LiF and BeFy molar volume given above, the following:

- ZYFy: 46 cm3 at 550°C; 48 cm3 at 700°C
UF,: 45.1 cm3 at 550°C; 46.1 cm> at 700°C

The ZrF, volumes were derived (not measured directly) from the densities
of alkali fluorides - ZrF, melts studied by Mellors and Senderoff.ll Molar
volumes for UF4 are extrapolated from densities measured by Kirshenbaum

and Cahill.12

For NaBFAvNaF (92-8 mole %), the observed molar volume would not be
expected to deviate from the additive value, Table 3 shows that volumes

NaBFA: 59.35 cm3 at 550°C; 63.20 cm3 at 700°C

NaF : 18.82 cm° at 550°C: 19.62 cm° at 700°C

Exgansivitz

An interesting result, derived from the three mixtures containing
ThFa, is that the expansivity (fractional change of volume with tempera-
ture) did not seem to change with the concentrations of BeF2 and ThFa.
Given that any fuel mixture for a molten~salt breeder reactor will contain
about 70 mole % LiF, then the results suggest that the expansivity will be
very close to 2.5 x 10—4/°C. The actual results were:

Room-Temperature Density and Estimated Density Change, Upon Melting, of

 

MSBR Fuel and Coolant Salts

 

This short investigation was conducted in order to provide reactor
designers with a reasonable estimate of the density change, upon melting,

of MSBR fuel and coolant salts.
16

Densities, at room temperature, were determined pycnometrically in a
25—cm3 Kimax '"specific gravity bottle'". The precise volume of the bottle
was determined with distilled water. Cottonseed oil was used as the dis-
placement liquid for the salts; the latter had been prefused and only
relatively large (> 2 mm) crystalline fragments were used in the pycno-

meter. The results obtained were:

LiF—Ber—ThF4 (72-16-12 mole 7%); 3.7887 g/cm3
NaBF, (100 mole %): 2.435. g/cm’

The pycnometric density of NaBF, was 3% less than the x-ray density of

16
2.5075 reported by Brunton.

A density-temperature curve (Fig. 2) for LiF-BeF --ThF4 (72-16~12 mole

%) was constructed on the basis of the following assuiptions: a) the
pycnometrically determined density at 25°C is representative of the bulk
density of the solid salt; b) the volume expansivity of the solid is

1l x 10-4 /°C, an estimate based on the value of this property in other
salts;15 c) the density above the liquidus is reliably predicted from the

additive molar volumes for LiF, BeF,, and ThF4 listed in the first part of

2’
this report. The calculations result in a predicted 7% decrease in dens-
ity over the temperature range of melting (or freezing). Equations and

other details are noted in Figure 2.

Two curves depicting the density—-temperature behavior of MSBR coolant

(92-8 mole % NaBF,-NaF) are given in Figure 3. The solid lines refer to

“"theoretical" or i-ray densities. At 243°C and at 385°C, the dashed and
solid lines coincide over a range of densities. The curves were generated
with the assumptions: (i) at room temperature the molar volumes are addi-
tive, (ii) the density of this solid mixture is 3% less than the x-ray
density (as was observed pycnometrically for pure NaBFA); (iii) the tem-
perature coefficient of density for the solid is a constant, 2.5 x 10_4/°C;
this coefficient corresponds to an expansivity of 1 x 10'—4 /°C; (iv) the

is

x-ray density of the high-temperature form of crystalline NaBF4

2,17 g/cm3 at 243°C (the same as Bredig16 obtained at 265°C).

On the basis of these four assumptions and experimental data for the

liquid, a density decrease of 8% upon melting is possible; however, a

undergoes a rather large density change in the solid at 243°C. The pre-

VISCOSITY

Introduction and Experimental

 

Viscosity is an important physical property in assessing the heat
transfer performance and fluid dynamics of reactor liquids. In these
regards, information on fluoroborates was of special interest. Viscosity
measurements on molten fluoroborates are relatively difficult because of

their high volatility.

For volatile liquids at elevated temperatures, accurate measurement
of low viscosities (<10 centipoises) are conveniently determined by oscil-
lating-cup viscometry. In this method, a cylindrical vessel, which
encapsulates the sample, is caused to execute torsional oscillations.

The rate at which the amplitude of the oscillations is damped depends on
the viscous drag of the liquid upon the walls of the container. The vis-
cosity is determined through the basic equations of fluid dynamics from:
the damping rate, the period of oscillation, the dimensions of the appara-

tus, and the mass and density of the liquid.

Over a period of several years, L. J. Wittenberg and his co-workers at
Mound Laboratory, Miamisburg, Ohio (an AEC-owned facility), have gained
much experience in measuring molten materials, mainly liquid metals,17 via
oscillating-cup viscometry. Because it was both faster and less expensive
for Mound rather than ORNL to obtain accurate viscosities of fluoroborates
and other fluorides of reactor interest, a purchase order for Mound's
services was obtained. Viscometric measurements and treatment of the data
were performed by L. J. Wittenberg and R. Dewitt of Mound Laboratory.
Preparation of samples, fabrication of capsules and supplementary inter-
pretation of the data were done at ORNL under the supervision of the

author.
20

The viscosities of five salt melts were determined. Two of these,

single-component melts of NaBF4 and KBF,, have been reported and discussed

4?
in another publication.18 The other three, the subjects of this report,
are: NaBF4—NaF: 92-8 mole %
LiF—Ber—ThFé: 72.7-15.7-11.6 mole % and 70.1-23.9-6.0 mole %).
Wittenberg has published details of the general techniqile17 and
methods for treating the data.19 The specific apparatus used for this in-

vestigation is described elsewhere.

Capsules, machined out of nickel stock, consisted of a cap and a
cylindrical cup, the latter with approximate dimensions: 1.75 cm I.D.,
1.85 cm 0.D., and 7.5 cm long. After the dimensions were accurately
measured, the capsules were charged with salt equivalent to about 15 cm3
in the expected temperature range of measurements. Weighing and charging
of samples were carried out in a glovebox. After these operations, the
glovebox was evacuated at V30 Y for 20 hours. After flushing the box
twice with helium (purified by passing through a charcoal trap maintained
at liquid nitrogen temperature), the cap was fuse-welded to the cup by
means of an argon arc torch. During welding, the capsule was kept in a
copper block whose purpose was to absorb most of the heat generated at the
weld. The efficiency of heat removal was indicated by a small piece of
masking tape attached to the cup about 2.5 cm below the weld-work; the
tape did not appear charred or altered by the welding operations. Success
in the heat removal was confirmed by the negligible losses in capsule

weights taken after welding.

Results and Discussion

 

The viscosities of the three salt mixtures are listed and compared
with least-squares values in Tables 4, 5, and 6. The temperature of the
viscosity determination was measured with a chromel-alumel thermocouple
positioned near the capsule but not touching it. At each temperature, at
least two, and usually three sets of amplitude and period measurements
were taken; hence, there is more than one experimental viscosity entry for
each temperature in Tables 4, 5, and 6. The data and least-squares fit

are plotted in Figure 4.

NaBF4.18 Evidently the presence of 8 mole % NaF leads to a somewhat lesser

-NaF (92-8 mole %) is very much like that of

viscosity (see Fig. 4).

The data for the two ternary melts show that the mixture with the
greater viscosity contains the lesser concentration of BeF2 and the greater
concentration of ThFa. Qualitatively, this beggvior was predicted from the
viscosity measured in mixtures of LiF-BeF,-UF, =~ : “"for LiF concentrations
of 60 mole % or greater, substitution of UF4 (or ThF4) for BeF, (at const.
temperature) causes an increase in viscosity."21 Indeed, as Table 7

reveals, the UF4—containing mixtures serve as an excellent basis for quan-

titatively predicting viscosities in analogous ThFa-containing melts.
