PROPERTIES OF HASTELLOY N WELDS

ABSTRACT

Welds were made by the TIG process in several heats
of Hastelloy N. The mechanical properties of transverse
weld samples and the base metal were compared in tensile
tests over the range of 75 to 1600°F and in creep tests at
1200°F. The as-fabricated welds exhibited lower fracture
strains than the base metal under all test conditions, but
the properties of the welds were improved markedly by post-
weld heat treatments. The postirradiation tensile and
creep properties of the welds and base metal at elevated
temperatures were about the same, although the properties

were widely different before irradiation.

 

INTRODUCTION

Hastelloy N is a trade name given the solid-solution-strengthened

nickel-base alloy developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory specif-

ically for use in molten fluoride salts up to 1500°F (ref. 1). The

alloy was originally designated INOR-8 and has a nominal composition of

Ni—17% Mo—7% Cr—5% Fe. This material is the primary metallic structural

material in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) which achieved

criticality on June 1, 1965, at Oak Ridge, Tennesse.? This alloy has
been used for numerous other applications, and we anticipate that a
slightly modified composition will be used in a future molten salt
breeder reactor experiment.

The weldability of this material has received considerable atten-

3,4

tion in our program. We found it necessary to establish a weldability

test to determine whether specific heats of material could be joined

satisfactorily. Through this screening process, it was possible to
select heats for use in fabricating the MSRE components.

During the past few years we have found that Hastelloy N as well
as other nickel- and iron-base alloys are subject to a type of neutron
irradiation damage that decreases the creep-rupture strength and fracture

strain at elevated temperatures.
all austenitic iron- and nickel-base alloys and is attributed to the
production of helium within the material due to the interaction of a
neutron of thermal energy with '“B to produce “Li and “He (refs. 7-14).
The property changes due to the helium must be evaluated for base metal
and welds.

In the present paper, we shall show how the mechanical properties
of transverse welds differ from those of the base metal and what types
of annealing treatments can be used to improve the properties of welds.
We shall also show how neutron irradiation alters the mechanical proper-
ties of the welds and the base metal. The mechanical properties measured

in this study were tensile properties over the temperature range of 75

to 1600°F and creep properties at 1200°F.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Several heats of Hastelloy N were used in this study and their
chemical compositions and other pertinent details are given in Table 1.
Heats 65-552 and 2477 were wvacuum melted; all others were air melted.

All base metal was annealed for 1 hr at 2150°F prior to testing unless
otherwise specified.

Seven weldments were involved in this study and the details are
given in Table 2. The welds were all highly restrained and made by the
manual tungsten-arc welding process. A standard welding procedure was
used on all the welds, although some deviation was necessary in welds 7
and & because of the type of filler metal being used. The joint configu-
ration and pass sequence are shown in Fig. 1. The primary working
direction in the plates was perpendicular to the weld axis.

We used small mechanical property samples throughout the study,
since this geometry was required for the irradiation experiments (Fig. 1).
The samples were cut perpendicular to the weld axis and parallel to the
stringers. Three layers of specimens were cut from all the welds except
No. 3; we could find no systematic variation in properties from top to
bottom. However, the gage portions of the transverse weld specimens did
contain different amounts of weld metal since the joint tapered (Fig. 1).

The tensile tests were run in an Instron Universal testing machine
1

(10,000-1b capacity) at strain rates of 0.05 or 0.002 min~ The strain

measurements were taken from the crosshead travel. A similar machine
was located in a hot cell for testing the irradiated samples. The labo-
ratory creep-rupture tests were run in standard lever-arm creep machines.

The strain measurements were taken from the pull-rod displacement after

the load was applied. The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run
in 1ever-arm creep machines located in the ORNL hot cells. The strain
was measured by an extensometer with rods attached to the upper and lower
specimen grips. The relative movement of these two rods was measured by
a linear differential transformer. All tests were run in an air environ-
ment. We used a standard equilibrating time of 1/2 hr for each test
prior to loading.

The irradiations were conducted in two facilities: the ETR,
Idaho Falls, Idaho, and the ORR, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A core facility
was used in the ETR where the thermal and fast (> 1 Mev) fluxes were
each 3.2 X 10%* neutrons em™? sec™!. The fluence obtained there was
5 x 10°° neutrons/cmz. The ETR experiments were uninstrumented and the

design temperatures were either less than 300°F or 1112 + 180°F. A

core facility was also used in the ORR where the thermal flux was

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Tensile Properties¥
The variation of the fracture strain in a tensile test with test
temperature is shown in Fig. 2 for both transverse welds and base metal.
The behavior of this particular heat of base metal is typical for
Hastelloy N. The decrease in fracture strain above 1100°F is due to

the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture. The
recovery above 1400°F is associated with increasing grain boundary
mobility. The fracture strain of the welds is much lower. Most of the
welds fractured in the weld metal, but several samples tested at 75 and
392°F did fail in the base metal.

The fracture strain after irradiation is also shown in Fig. 2.
Since these samples were irradiated at less than 300°F, there is some
displacement damage in the base metal and the fracture strain is lower
at test temperatures of 75 and 392°F. At test temperatures of 1200 and
1600°F, where intergranular fracture predominates, the fracture strain
of the base metal is reduced dramatically. The postirradiation fracture
ductility of the irradiated welds is also shown in Fig. 2. The strain
at fracture of the welds is reduced slightly by irradiation, but the
changes are much less than those observed for the base metal. Thus,
although the ductility of the welds is much lower than that of the base
metal before irradiation, the ductilities of welds and base metal at
elevated temperatures are quite similar after irradiation.

The yield strengths of typical welds and base metal are compared
in Fig. 3. The yieldlstrengths of the transverse weld samples are con-
sistently higher than those of the base metal. This same observation
was also made by Gilliland and Venard.’ After a postweld anneal of & hr
at 1600°F, the welded and base metal samples have very similar yield
strengths.

Irradiation increases the yield strength of the base metal and
welded samples at low temperatures. This damage anneals out as the test

temperature is increased, and the welds and base metal show similar

recovery. Thus, above 1200°F the yield strengths of base metal and
welds annealed for & hr at 1600°F are equivalent and are unaffected by
irradiation.

Figure 4 shows that the ultimate tensile strength is about the same
for welded samples and for base metal. This property is not affected
significantly by postweld heat treatment at 1600°F. Irradiation causes
a slight (approx 10%) increase in the ultimate tensile strength at the
iower test temperatures and a decrease at test temperatures of 1200°F
and greater. This reduction at higher temperatures is due to the reduced
ability of the material to deform plastically after irradiation (i.e.,
fracture occurs before the stress increases to the higher wvalues noted
for unirradiated materials).

Thus, the effects of welding on the strength parameters measured by
standard tensile tests are relatively small and the most significant
factor is the reduction in the fracture strain. The fracture strains

observed for the welds involved in this study are summarized in Fig. 5.

Welds 1, 4, and 5 involve air-melted materials with relatively high
boron levels. Heat 2477, a vacuum-melted heat containing & ppm B, was
used as the base and filler metal in weld 3. Weld 6 utilized filler
metal from heat ©65-552, a vacuum-melted heat containing 1 ppm B, and
base metal from heat 5065, an air-melted heat. Welds 7 and 8 utilized
air-melted base and filler materials. The filler rod for weld 7 was
plasma-spray-coated with Al,03 in an effort to reduce the interdendritic
spacing in the cast weld metal and to provide additional sites for helium
collection. However, most of the Al,03 floated on the weld and had to
be removed mechanically before making the next pass; the aluminum content
of the deposited weld metal was only 0.06% compared with 0.84% for a
typical cross section from the filler metal before deposition. Weld 8
involved a filler material coated with WC. The deposited weld metal
contained 2% W and 0.1% C, so the WC coating dissolved in the melt
altered the properties of the weld appreciably.

The fracture strains shown in Fig. 5 are compared for
1. base metal given a standard solution anneal of 1 hr at 2150°F,
2. base metal given the 1 hr at 2150°F treatment followed by an anneal

of 8 hr at 1600°F,
3. transverse weld samples in the as-welded condition, and
4. transverse weld samples annealed for & hr at 1600°F.
These properties are considered for unirradiated and irradiated condi-
tions where data are available.

At a test temperature of 75°F the following points are illustrated

in Fig. 5.
12

1. The fracture strains of all welds are lower than those of the
base metal.

2. Welds 1, 4, and 5 all involved air-melted alloys and exhibited
the lowest fracture strains.

3. Welds 3 and 6 involved vacuum-melted weld metal and have the
best properties.

4. Welds 7 and 8, which involved air-melted alloys with the filler
metal modified with Al,05; and WC, exhibited intermediate properties.

5. Postweld heat treatments generally improved the properties.

6. Irradiation decreased the fracture strain of all welds and
base metal. The welds had lower postirradiation ductilities than the
base metals, but the welds were affected less by irradiation.

7. The postirradiation ductilities of welds did not depend
appreciably on whether they had received a postweld heat treatment prior
to irradiation.

8. The postirradiation properties of all welds except No. 8 were
equivalent.

Figure 5 also illustrates several important points at a tensile
test temperature of 1200°F.

1. The fracture strains of all welds were lower than those of the
base metal.

2. The as-welded ductilities of all welds except No. 8 were about
equivalent, ranging from 12 to 18%. Weld & had 25% strain at fracture

under these conditions.
i3

3. A postweld heat treatment of 8 hr at 1600°F markedly improved
the fracture strain, with values of 22 to 30% being observed. Weld &
again was better.

4. After irradiation, all welds were less ductile than the base
metal. There were some differences in the ductilities of the welds, but
no consistent trends are apparent.

5. Postweld annealing for 8 hr at 1600°F had little effect on the
postirradiation properties.

At 1600°F, Fig. 5 shows the following trends.

1. The fracture strains were drastically lower for welds than for
base metal. Welds 3 and 8 had properties superior to those of the other
welds. DPostweld heat treating had a beneficial effect on the ductility.

2. Irradiation reduced the fracture strain to about 2% independent
of whether the test sample was base metal or a transverse weld.

All of the postirradiation results presented thus far have been
for materials irradiated at less than 300°F. We have irradiated several
samples of these heats and others at 1200 to 1400°F and find that there
are at least two significant differences in the results obtained. The
displacement damage anneals at these irradiation temperatures and the
tensile properties up to about 1000°F are the same for irradiated and
unirradiated materials. At higher test temperatures the fracture strain
is reduced even Turther if the irradiation temperature is in the range
of 1200 to 1400°F. For example, heat 5065 was found to have a fracture
strain of 11.3% (irradiated at 1200°F) at 1200°F compared with the
value of 22.2% (irradiated at less than 300°F) shown in Fig. 5. Weld 7

was observed to have fracture strains at 1200°F of 7.2 and 10.8% after
14

irradiation at 1200°F and less than 300°F, respectively. Thus, the
trends shown in Fig. 5 for samples irradiated at 300°F seem to hold for
irradiation temperatures in the 1200 to 1400°F range, although the actual

fracture strains may be lower for the higher irradiation temperature.

Creep-Rupture Properties*

The stress-rupture properties at 1200°F of several heats of base
metal are shown in Fig. 6. The data are described reasonably well by
a single line, although both air- and vacuum-melted materials are
involved. The line for the base materials is shown in Fig. 7 where a
comparison is made between the stress-rupture properties of the base
metal and the various welds involved in this study. All of the welds
had lower creep-rupture strength in the as-welded condition than the
base metal. Weld 3, which involved only vacuum-melted materials, had
significantly higher strength than the other welds. Welds 7 and 8, which
involved A1,0; and WC additions, also showed notably better performance
than welds 1, 4, and 6. The rupture lives of the welds approached those
of the base metal as the stress level was reduced; this is likely due to
thermal recovery of the weld metal during the long time at 1200°F. The
strength was improved greatly by a postweld anneal of 8 hr at 1600°F.

The fracture strains of the welds and several heats of base metal
are compared in Fig. 8. The fracture strain of the base metal was about
25% for short rupture lives of a few hours and decreased to values of
10 to 15% when the rupture life was 1000 hr. There is no appreciable

difference between air- and vacuum-melted alloys. The welds had fracture

strains of only about 3% for rupture lives up to a few hundred hours.
Samples having rupture lives over 1000 hr showed some improvement with
strains in the range of 3 to 5%. Weld 3 had much superior fracture
straing of about 6% for all test conditions. All welds and even the
base metal exhibited much higher fracture strains after an anneal of

8 hr at 16C0°F.

As shown in Fig. 9, irradiation produces some rather dramatic
changes in the stress-rupture properties. The lines shown in Fig. 9
were obtained from Fig. 6 for the unirradiated base metal, Fig. & for
the minimum strength of unirradiated welds, and from Ref. 6 for the
strength of irradiated base metal. Several points are included for
base metals irradiated under exactly the same conditions as the welds.
The properties of heat 2477 (low boron, vacuum-melted) are superior to

those of heat 5065 for the low irradiation temperature of less than
300°F, but further work has shown that these materials have comparable

properties when irradiated at 1200°F or higher.®

The rupture lives of
the welds seem quite comparable with those of the base metals and all
welds seem to have about the same properties. A single specimen was
given a postweld heat treatment of 8 hr at 1600°F and had superior post-
irradiation strength, but this observation should be repeated before con-
cluding that this anneal is effective. Moteff and Smith!® also found
that the postirradiation creep properties of Hastelloy N base metal and
welds were equivalent at 1200°F. They also found that a postweld anneal
of 4 hr at 1600°F did not improve the postirradiation properties of
welds.

The fracture strain is shown in Fig. 10 as a function of rupture
life. The fracture strain of the base metal had a low value of about
0.5% for rupture lives of only a few hours and increased to aboutVB% for
rupture lives of 1000 hr. The welds fall into this same pattern, but
the strains were consistently slightly lower. Again the single test on
a sample having a postweld anneal exhibited better properties.

We also compared the minimum creep rates for these same materials
to obtain a measure of strength. The creep properties of several heats
of base metal in the irradiated and unirradiated conditions are shown in
Fig. 11. Most of the data are contained within the band in Fig. 11,
with heat 5065 favoring the right side and heat 2477 the left side.

This same band is transferred to Fig. 12, where the data for the welds
are shown for comparison. The data do not deviate significantly from
the band obtained for the base metal. Thus, the creep rate of Hastelloy N

is not affected appreciably by welding or by irradiation.

Postweld Heat Treatments*

We have mentioned previously the improvement of the properties of
welds by a postweld heat treatment of 8 hr at 1600°F. We chose this
treatment on the basis of our work with weld 1 in which we tested samples
at 40,000 psi and 1200°F after annealing samples for various periods of
time at temperatures of 1200, 1400, and 1600°F. The influence of these
treatments on the rupture life is shown in Fig. 13. The as-welded sample
had a rupture life of only 19 hr compared with a rupture life of about
350 hr for the base metal (Fig. 6). Long annealing times at 1200°F were

required to produce much improvement, and the rupture life was only 60 hr

 

*See Table A-5, Appendix, for the tabulated results for creep-
rupture tests.

after a 1000-hr postweld heat treatment at 1200°F. Annealing at 1400°F
brought about more rapid recovery with the rupture life of the weld being
comparable with that of the base metal after a 50-hr anneal. Only about
8 hr at 1600°F was required to restore the rupture life. We have no
explanation for the apparent reduction in the rupture life due to a post-
weld anneal at 1600°F of 50 hr compared with anneals of 8- and 100-hr
duration.

The change in the fracture strain with postweld heat treatment is
shown in Fig. 14. The fracture strain is about 12% for the base metal
(Fig. 8) and the welds can be annealed to obtain equivalent or even
better fracture strains. There is an apparent inversion in the recovery
curve at 1600°F; this corresponds to the conditions producing short
rupture lives in Fig. 13.

The reduction in area for these same samples is shown in Fig. 15.

Values for the welds as high as the 15% obtained for base metal can be

obtained by postweld anneals at 1400 and 16CO°F. The unusual behavior
due to annealing for 50 hr at 1600°F again appears for two of the
samples. The reduction in area is not affected appreciably by annealing
st 1200°F, indicating that the improved elongation at fracture (Fig. 14)
is due primarily to the formation of cracks during testing.

We examined the influence of whether the postweld annealing environ-
ment was argon or hydrogen at 16C0°F, since Gilliland and Venard® had
reported better properties for samples annealed in hydrogen than for
those annealed in argon. Comparative points are shown in Figs. 13, 14,
and 15 for these annealing environments, and no appreciable differences

are apparent.

Metallography

Many of the samples were examined metallographically and a few
typical microstructures will be presented. Figure 16 shows the fusion
zone of weld 4. The structure of the base metal is characterized by
stringers of Mg(C~type precipitates and a relatively fine grain size.

The weld metal contains a fine cellular structure within coarse grains.
The fusion line is quite sharp and the transition of some of the large
M¢C precipitates to a lamellar phase is apparent. The exact identifica-
tion of the lamellar phase has eluded us for some time, but our evidence
indicates that it is a Mo-Ni-Si compound.!® Microprobe studies have
shown that the precipitates are enriched in silicon and that the dark
etching portions of the dendritic cast structure are also higher in

silicon.

Etchant: glyceria regia.
This same general description applies to the fusion zones of the
other welds except 3 and 8. The base metals used in weld 3 were vacuum-
melted and the stringers are minimal. The bulk silicon content was low

(0.015%) and the precipitates were primarily of the MosC type and were

found to dissolve easily. Thus, not much of the lamellar transformation

 
25

product was present at the fusion line. Weld 8 involved the filler mate-
rial that was coated with WC, and the structure of the deposited weld
metal is much finer (Fig. 17).

A typical microstructure of a creep-rupture fracture in Hastelloy N
base metal is shown in Fig. 18. This sample was tested at 40,000 psi and
1200°F and failed after 312 hr with 16.6% strain. There is considerable
grain boundary cracking and the fracture is predominantly intergranular.

Typical microstructures of a tested sample from weld 1 are shown
in Fig. 19. This sample was tested at 40,000 psi and 1200°F in the as-
welded condition; failure occurred in 18.7 hr with 3.1% strain and only
0.77% reduction in area. The fracture occurred in the weld metal and
followed the grain boundaries; however, little grain boundary cracking
adjacent to the fracture is evident.

Postweld heat treatments generally improved the tensile and creep
properties. Figure 20 shows the fracture of a sample from weld 1 that
was annealed for 2 hr at 1600°F and tested at 40,000 psi and 1200°F.

This sample failed in 200 hr with 9.4% strain and 6.4% reduction in area.
The failure still occurred in the weld metal; however, intergranular
cracks did form throughout the weld zone, indicating that deformation

occurred generally throughout this zone.

SUMMARY

This study has shown that the mechanical properties of welds in
Hastelloy N are generally inferior to those of the base metal. The
strain at fracture is the property affected most severely, although

appreciable reductions in the high-temperature creep-rupture strength

also occurred. The properties of welds can be improved by suitable post-
weld heat treatments to almost equal those of the base metal.

Several welds were studied which involved air- and vacuum-melted
materials. The weld involving vacuum-melted base and filler metal
(weld 3) had superior creep-rupture properties in the as-welded condition.
Weld 8 involved air-melted materials and the filler metal was coated with
WC. The properties of this weld were generally superior to those of the
other welds, but the fracture strain under creep conditions was not
improved.

Neutron irradiation caused a decrease in the fracture strain of
both welds and base metal. The postirradiation fracture strains in
tensile tests of the welds and the base metal became closer as the test
temperature was increased; they were identical at 1600°F. Although post-
weld heat treatments improved the fracture strain in preirradiation
tensile tests, the postirradiation fracture strains of welds seemed
independent of postweld anneal. The postirradiation creep-rupture proper-
ties at 1200°F were about the same for welds and base metal, even though
the preirradiation properties differed greatly. Although some of the
irradiated welds showed improved performance in tensile tests, they all

had about the same creep-rupture properties.
