- DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF A SALT-SUPERCRITICAL
WATER HEAT EXCHANGER AND THROTTLE USED WITH MSBR
Froncrs H. Clark O. W. Burke

 

ABSTRACT

A linearized, coarse space mesh model of a salt-supercritical water
heat exchanger and the downstream throttle was simulated on analog
computers. The effects on certain output quantities of changes in

~ certain input quantities were noted. The output quantities were heat-
exchanger water outlet temperature and pressure, salt outlet temperature,
and enthalpy output. The input quantities were heat-exchanger water
inlet temperature and pressure, salt inlet temperature, salt velocity, and
throttle setfing. Chonges were studied only around design steody state.

Sufﬁcuent lnput-outpui' data were acquired to permit a greatly sim-
plified representation of these componentis for further system studies in
~ the neighborhood of design steady state. A tentative scheme of heat
exchanger=-throttle conirol was devised to hold water outlet temperature
within a 1°F range, and water outlet pressure wnthm a few pounds of
design while enthalpy output follows demand.

~ INTRODUCTION

To design a control system suitable for an electrical power generation system

with a Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor as a thermal source or simply to determine the

control requirements of the reactor alone in such a system, it is essential to under-

‘sfond fhe d*mmic responses ‘ro.F; I'h'e ”moior_ 'system.components. It is economicol and

to be near constant,and the heat rate to follow the load. The steam generafor*

and turbine are the components at which these vqriab.es are sensed and where the
control loops make their actioﬁ felt. The dynamic behavior of the steam generatof-
throttle complex is therefore crucial to determining control requirer.nents-in'.more
remote parts of the system. We have, consequently, simulated and studied these
components. The study was carried out on thé Oak Ridge National Luborﬁtory
analog computing equipment, consisﬁng of one EAl 221R and two EAIl 16-31R

computers.

STEAM GENERAfOR DESIGN AND .MODEL.
The steam generator design which was studied may be described roughly as’
follows. It is a vertical U-shaped heat exchanger, total Iéngth about 70 feet.
It is a one shell pass (salt) and one tube pass (water) unit. There are 349 parallel
water tubes. The tubes are of Hastelloy N, OD 0.50 in., thickness 0.077 in. The
shell ID is 18.25 in. The mass flow rate of water is 6;33 x 10° Ib/hr, énd of salt is
3.66 x 10° Ib/hr. The entrance and exit temperatures of the salt were, respectively,

1125°F and 850°F, and of the water, 700°F and 1000°F. The inlet and outlet

 

*Although this is a supercritical system which, strictly, does not have a liqufd,
a boiling, and a steam section, we shall nonetheless use such terminology to describe
the high density, the rapidly changing density, and the low density regions and shall

refer to the component as a steam generator.

related to the design of this eomponent are given inref 1, p. 46 ff, case A,

The system modeled has been _v’astly simplified from the design system. 1t is |

believed, however, that the properties essential to the study of steady sllal'e control

have been presew_ed.
 The model is a single, water tubular channel surrounded by a salt annular

channel. ' The cross-sectional area of each channel is taken equal to the total

crosssectional areas of flow of water and salt, respectively, in the design system.
 Heat transfer coefficients were computed to be consistent with the steady state, local

heat fransfer and temperature profiles. The water-film heat transfer coefficient was

taken to vary as lh_e 0.6 power of the water velocity,and the corresponding salt-
film coefficient as :the 0.8 powef of the salt veloeity

' There are a few optional connections in Fig. 2 beyond those indicated by the
above équaﬁons. These optional connections are feedback control loops which
were developed in the study and which will be dealt with in the section entitled

Boundaries and Conirols, p. 22.

PARAMETERS OF THE PROBLEM
Initially, the system was cut into eight spatial nodes whose location in ‘thé
laboratory reference frame was held fixed. With so few nodes it would have been |
better to permit at least some of them, those associated‘with the "boiling" region,
to float. The problem was already of such complexity, however, that we could

not possibly meet the equipment demands of such an approach,and the nodes were

| assigned fixed coordinates.

Steady state design values of the system variables are given in Table 1.
Table 2 giv.es the derived paramefers and constants at various nodes. Table 3 gives
the sets of parameters used to represent the equation of state of water. Other
parameters used in the study include

We will assume both a positive and b non-negative (as they are in any reason-

able rule that occurs to us). Further, for definiteness, let us assume that

Xn > Xn_l,and that V>0; that is, that motion is from low to high values of X.

Let us also assume that the boundary condition on f is applied at high values of X,
so that, in @ marching numerical integration, the value at Xn will be known and the .

value at Xn-l will be solved for..- Let us now integrate Eq. (135) over X to yield

If either (19a) or (19b) is satisfied, it implie‘s, of course, that G(t) contains
implicitly some.negaﬁve feedback that compensates for the explicit positive feed-
back AF(Y) in (17) and (18).

Note that the positive feedback in (17) and (18) was due entirely to two
circumstances:

1. That a in (15) was taken positive.

2. That the direction of integration was upsfream.;. that is, tht the
boundary condition was applied at the high-value end of X,while the velocity V
was positive.

It is clear that when these two conditions for positive feedback are met,an.d if
' there is an overall implicit negative feedback contained in G by reason of fhé
satisfaction of (19a) or (19b), one must be careful in what one does with G not to
desfroy the sometimes delicate balance. This problem and these considerations

will be found to be \}ery relevant to the problem at hand.

LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL
In checking out fhe problem on the analog computer. it was fouﬁd that there
were instabilities generated in the first two nodes. We have not made a complete
analysis of these instabilities, but we did arrive at a partial understundihg of them,

at least.
i

.

19

'First, we note that the explicit poSifive feedback of (17) and (18) is present.

- [Boundary condition (10b) is epplied at high X,and V is positive; hence, both

conditions for this kind of feedback are met. ] There is a negative feedback due

to friction which, in all nodes except one and two, overcomes the positive feed-

back. Other terms which contribute to the implicit negative feedback are less .

tightly coupled to the flow integrato;sf" It is believed that the spatial nodes form

such a coarse mesh that this implicit feedback does not arrive with the gain and

phase necessary to insure sfabil'irf)} o

The f:rst two nodes, as can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, comprise about 10‘% of

the length and heat tronsfer capcblhty of the system. They further are confined

to fhe 'water" section, that is; the'region where 'the ‘water density is high _and is

changmg reasonably slowly. The 'bo:lmg region: Iaes beyond them.

~ In order to nd the sysfem of the msfabllll'y, the first two nodes were arbl‘l'rarlly

action was taken only with great reluctance. In extenuation it is argued

which imply far more computing equipment than the amount available.
| . )
 

 

20

-In any event, the first important limiiuﬁon of the model is the truncation
of the water section. |

As indicated in earlier secﬁoﬁs, the actual system is a bundle of 349 parallel
water tubes. The system as modeled is a single .water tube. Parallél channel systems,
by reason of interactions and -oscillations possible between channels, are almost
always subject to certain kinds of instabilities which simply do not exist in a one-
?:hannel system. The restriction to one channel was dictated by the limited amount
of computing machinery available. The second important limitation is, therefore,
the single water channel. |

Reference to Table 1 will show that from node 3 to node 7 the water density
changed by a factor of about 6. Clearly, that indicates too broad a range of
physical variation to be treated at all adequcfely.with only five nodes. Agdin |
equipment limitations dictated the restriction.. A faithful spatial representation
would have demanded many additional nodes. The third important limitation is
the coarseness of the spatial mesh. |

.We have already described the procedures by which the problem was linearized

‘example. . Essentially all instabilities which will be of interest in a real system

are non-linear. So are olrl accident events. The linearized model fs of little help
in the study of such n'on:-li-rieqr'_ evenfs..

I.t would have been poss.ible'wii'h' available equipmeﬁf to have simulated some
of the non-linear aspects of fhe's‘ystém. This was not done for the following
reasonss |

1. It was believed, and subsequent experience showed it to be so, that the
problem would place véry_ s-e_vjé:r.e.démar.zds upon mdchiﬁé performance. Linear com~
ponents are génerally less fréuslesbme' in operation than non-l#néa’r. 'Hence, lineari-
zé-ﬁon iﬁcreases the sﬁcc'ess pr§babi|ity of the problem. |

2, ‘The very coarse spoce mesh demcnded that dync:mlc chﬁnges be restricted

to fcurly small changes from steady state. For any large amphtude spahal effecfs

would be badly dlstorted on fhe coarse space mesh This ampllfude llmltcmon, in

', eFfect conflnes the problem to the regnon of lmearlty in time.

3. Not all non-linear effects could be handled with the __equiprhent available.
- The fourth major limifation of the model is, therefore, the neglect of non-
line’ar effects.

Such sysfems have been successfully studled on hybr:d compufers, buf not on

machines of lesser capcblllty, digital or analog. Hence, to al'fempt the study

on an analog machine, or on anything less than a hybrid, was to insure that
something less then a full study be made.

As has been previously indicafed this abbreviated mode! should answer some
important questions about control in the neighborhood of design steady state.
It should not be adequate to handle questions of control following large load

changes, of non-linear stability, or of accidents.

BOUNDARIES AND CONTROLS
We have already indicai‘ed that l'h»e specification of the water pr'es;ure‘and
temperdfure at boundary 0, in Fig. ],v and the salt ‘i'emperali'ure at Boundory M
are left available to the user as boundary conditions. We have notéd fHat R, P, and

T are connected by Equation (10b) at the eighth node, and this relation serves as

 

a boundary condition on vR. In this relation( AT ), the %hroﬂle setfipg, can
be varied as an additional control at the di#posal of the user. The final available
control is "W", the change in the salt velocity. |

All of the above controls canat the user's option, be set to a vulué selected
by the user. (With a linearized modzl, of course, change of any system variqble by
more than 10% from design steady state would probably be unjustified.) Provision
has also been made to operate some of these controls, at fhey user's option, with a
feedback error signal. After some experimenfation with thé system it was déterrriined

that the following feedback signals should be optionally incorporated for investigation.

trol ére outlet water temperature Ty (18,), outlet water pressure .F"y' (40;), heat
output -AH/H (48), salt velocity W (003), and water mass flow rate (75).

A séf of eight diagnostic runs was performed. Each run started from design
steady state, and in each run a single variable was changed in a first-order qu or
a step. Table 5 summarizes what was done in each of these runs. Figures 3 through
10 are time fraces of fhesé runs showing the effects on important variables. From
these results rough gain-lag information can be estimated by examining steady states
before and after excitation. This information is summarized in Table 6. Use of
such information will permit a much abbrevicted- description of- the steam genéquor
for incorporation in a system analysis.

Attension is next fixed on feedback control schemes. No attempt was made to find
anything like optimum control. There would be no point to such an attempt at this

stage of design. Accordingly, only simple integrating feedbacks were used.

The system was excited from design steady state in each of fﬁese runs with |
5% increase in heat demand (see Fig. 13) ins;arted at a ramp rate of 5%/min.

Figures 19 and 20 are the time traces of Runs 38A and 38B respecﬁvély.-
Figure 19 shows an 8°F vafiation in water outlet temperature, comple'tlellg.( |
 unacceptable. Figure 20 shows a variation a shade over 1°F. This would .be very
nearly acceptable. However, the feedback circuitry does not reflect the very con-
sideréble time delay to the salt inlet temperature 6; that would be calusved by the
'pre;se-nce of the reactor and the p;'imry héat exchanger. (The pressufe and fhrofﬂe |
controls were present in these runs.) |

Run 39A was like 38B except thdt the inlet salt temperature 07 was inserted
through a 10-sec first-order lag. Figufe 21, which is the time frace; is t';scillctory
and diverging. Run 39B is like 39A but with feedback gain reduced to 1/10 its
~value in 39A, Further, the ex&ifaﬁo_n was limited to a 3% heat demand increase.
Figure 22 shows the sysfem now convergent but with an unacceptdble_ oscilloﬁ.;an.

" In order to avoid the oscillation introduced by the tfme lag on 87, it was

determined to control the water outlet terﬁperdture by Qorying s<;.1|f velocii'y. This

makes possible a much quiéker response. The salt velocity could then be returned to
