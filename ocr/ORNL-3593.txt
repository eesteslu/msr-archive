ABSTRACT

A critical evaluation hag been made of the available
mechanical property data for Nb-, Mo-, Ta-, and W-base
alloys. TIL was found that insufficient data are available
to allow the design and construction of complex engineering
systems involving these materials. A general evaluation
of the potential service temperatures for Nb-, Mo-, Ta-,
and W-base alloys was made on the basis that conventional
alloys have been uged up to two thirds of their absgolute
melting point. Strengthening mechanisms that have been
used to achieve high operating temperaturecs for conventional
alloys and that could be applied to refractory alloys are
disgcussed.

A review of the literature on the effects of irradi-
ation on the mechanical properties of nicbium, molybdenum,
tantalum, and tungsten has been made. Tt has been found
that the existing data on this topic are rather scant,

The data in general show that the ductility of molybdenum,
tantalum, and tungsten is reduced after irradiation at ambient
temperatures. The yield and ultimate strengbths are increased
slightly by dirradiation. High-temperature tube-burst tests
show that the rupture life of the Nb—1% Zr alloy is not

drastically influenced by irradiation.
INTRODUCTION

Cenventional high-temperature alloys, such &g the stainless steels
and nickel-base alloys, have constantly been improved. These materials
have and will continue to be invaluable structural materials in the nu-
clear Field. However, proposed future nuclear cystems require materials
that will operate gatisfactorily at temperatures in excess of the melting
points of the nickel~ and iron-base alloys. A scan of the periodic chart,
melting points of the elements, and availability and suvsequent costs
reveals only four candidate materials: niocbium, molybdenum, tantalum, and
tungasten. In considering the potential of these metale and their alloys,
the physzical property data 1in Tsble 1 are useful. The daba on nickel and
iron are tabulated for comparison. '"The values Tor one half and two thirds
of the absolute melting point are significant because they indicate, re-
spectively, the temperature for which creep begins to be a problem and the
maximum service temperature to which éengineering alloys are commonly
Subjected.l

The values of the microsecopic thermal neubron aboorption cross
section for these metals are of interecst for nuclear applications. With
other parameters remaining constant, the use of nlobium or molybdenum as
a fuel element cladding material would resull in better neutron economy
than would the use of tantalum or tungsten.

In considering a material for engineering application, 1t 1o nec-
esgary that the requirements of the particular aspplication be carefully
evaluated and contrasted with the properties of the material. Consider
in particular the problem of choosing the structural and fuel cladding
materials for & nuclear reactor using a liguid-metal heat-transfer medium.
The material must have sufficient strength at the operating ltemperature,
must be capable of fabrication into the desired shapes, and must withstand
the corrogive influences of its enviropment.

Although the fabricability and corrosion resistance are of the
utmost importance, it is the purpose of this digcussion to deal specif-

ically with the mechanical property regquirements of these materials. The

gspecific properties that must be evaluated include: (1) engineering
design data; (2) data concerning the long-time chemical stability of
the alloy; (3) the ductility between the minimum and maximum service
temperatures; (4) éffect of atmosphere on the strength and ductility;
(5) the influence of ircadiation; and (6) thermal Tatigue properties.

The components of a rezsctor system require materials having con-
siderably different properties in these six areas. For example,
materials used for fuel element cladding or radiators must be consider-
ably more ductile than turbine blade or nozzle materials. Likewise,
resistance to damage by irradiation is of importance for core structural
materials but not for radiator materials.

Although considerable information is available on the high-
temperature mechanical properties of Nb-, Mo-, Ta-, and W-base alloys,
no single alloy haé been gufficiently evaluated in these six aress to
make 1t ready for service in a nuclear sgystem. In this discussion an
attempt will be made to assess the state of affairs relative to these
Tour refractory metals. The available data will be reviewed critically.
Recommendations as to the cholce of alloys for service over specific
temperature ranges will be made, Areas in which data are lacking will

be pointed out.

STRENGTHENTNG MECHANISMS IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE MATERIALS

The following discussion of strengthening mechanisms is not in-
tended Lo be a complete "textbook” treatment of the subject, but rather
a means of bringing to the reader's attention the many possibilities
that must be considered. For exemple, when 1% Zr is added to nicbium,
it does not necesssrlily follow that the strengthening observed is due
to solid-solution strengthening. The entire chemistry of the metal is
changed and it is quite likely that the major portion of the strength-
ening is due to the formation of zirconium-interstitial complexes
(clusters or compounds).

Specific data are presented in this discussion only where it
iliustrates a particular point, Dalta on the mechanical behavior of

4

refractory metals will be given in the next gection.
Solid-Solution Strengthening

 

Solid-solution strengthening may be defined as the increase 1n
registance to deformation of a material brought about by dissolving in
it ancther element. The introductlion of atoms having a diameter dif-
ferent from those of the parent lattice introduces ztrains. Thece
distorted regions in the Iattice interfere with the motion of disloca-
tion and increasec the resistance of the material o deformation. The
amount of strengthening obtained by this mechanism is proportional to
the amount of solute up Lo the solubility limit. The strengthening is
likewise proportional to the size difference in the solute and solvent
atoms. However, this is not an independent factor since the degree of
solubility decreascs as the atomic misiit increaces. This picture of
strengthening bhased on a size factor, as was originally propoced by
Mott and Nabarro,z is somewnat an cversimplification and recent
workers>?* have shown the valency or electronic effects to be important.

Another effect of solid-solutlon alloying is that of lowering
the stacking fault energy. This causes the dislocations to split into
partliales with a faulted region in between. For cross slip to oceur,
these partials must be forced together. This effect, however, 1s
confined to face-centered cubic materials and has been observed in
copper and sftainlessg steels.

Some of the most interesting effects arise from the tendency of
impurity atoms to migrate to dislocations and to grain boundaries. This
tends to anchor the diglocations and to lock the scurces. The segrega-
tion of impurities in the grain boundaries is largely responsible for
the large effects that impurity atoms have on the recrystallization
temperature of metals. Vandermeer et g;.5 have shown that alloy addi-
tions to high-purity aluminum alter the rate of grain boundary migration

in proportion to the diffusion rate of the solute in the solvent.

However, recrystallization in the transition metals may bte more complex.
Abrahamson® hag shown that the effect of alloying elements on the recrys-
tallization temperature of niobium can be correlated with the atom per-
cent solute and the free atom electron configuration of the solute
element. The elements Mn, Fe, Cd, Ni, W, Re, and Os lower the recrys-
tallization temperature and Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, Ir,
and Pt raise the recrystallization temperature.

Darken7

polints out that the effect of substitutional alloy
additions per se cannot account for the strength realized in materials.
Substitutional alloying may be of more importance in conjunctlon with
other strengthening mechanismg. The studies by’Darken7 of the oxidation
of a gilver-aluminum alloy illustrate this point. Al The temperatures
studied, aluminum has a high affinity for oxygen whereas sillver oxide is
unstable. Tt was felt that at low temperatures the oxygen would diffuse
to the aluninum atoms and in the limiting case the aluminum atoms would
remain stationary. If the aluminum atoms were completely surrounded by
oxygen atoms the oxygen-to-aluminum ratio would be 6. Ag the aluminum
atoms migrate, the cluster size would increase and the oxygen-to-aluminum
ratic would decrease. Observations by Wriedt® on the oxidation of a
Ag~0.1% Al and a Ag~0.48% Al alloy support the proposed model. The oxygen-
to~-aluminum ratio decreased with increasing btemperature and increazing
aluminum content., It was also Tound that when an alloy wag oxidized at
ope temperature and. subsequently exposed bo an oxidizing atmozphere at
a higher temperature the oxygen-to-~aluminum ratio dild not change. This
indicates the very high stability of the aluminum-oxygen clusters. Theze
are considerably nmore effective in strengthening the alloy than would be
the gtrain fields due Lo the aluminum atoms alone.

The effect that a gubstltutional alloying addition has on the
strength of a metal would be lost 1T the solute element weres removed;

therefore, the alloy addition must be compatible with the service

enviromment. Two of the processes whereby the solute may be lost are
by evaporation at high temperatures in vacuum and by selective leaching

in a corrosive environment.
Interstitial and Dispersion Strengthening

Although the interstitial atoms are smaller and diffuse more
rapidly than substitufional alloying elements, they can effectively alter
the motion of dislocations. They are believed to be responsible for the
ductile-to-brittle transition that is characteristic of body-centered
cubic metals. The interstitial atoms become quite Immobile at low
temperatures and prevent the dislocations from moving.

Strain aging is another phenomenon attributed to interstitial
impurity atoms. This process 1s brought about by interactions between
moving dislocations and moblle interstitial solute atoms. Strain aging
may be manifested in a "return of the yield point” in a tensile
specimen after interrupting a tensile test and aging the specimen or by
stréengthening during a conbtiauous tenslle test with accompanying reduction
in ductility and discontinuous yielding. The empirical relationghip that

has been determined for the occurrence of discontinuous yielding is

¢ = 10° D,
wrere

¢ ig the strain rate, and
D is the diffusion rate of the Interstitial responsible for the
strain aging.

Thiz describes the condition for which the velocities of moving disloca-
tions and impurity atoms are comparable. Straln aging 1s a relatively
low-temperature phenomenon. For example, in niobium at strain rates of
1072 to 1074 sec”l, strain aging due to oxygen and the combined effects
of nitrogen and carbon is observed over the temperature range of 200 to

450°C.°

The precipitation of a second phase has been used as a strengthen-
ing mechanism in metals for some time. The general concept of strength-
ening by this mechanism i1s that the second phase particles introduce
gstrain fields that interfere with the motion of dislocations. In light
of this mechanism, the concept of a critical particle size {or spacing)

was proposed by Orowan. 10

Particles of sizes greater cr smaller than

this critical size are relatively ineffective. However, many complica-
tiong may arige that make this picture a gross oversimplification. The
particles formed may or may not produce a strain ield; they may or may
not be coherent; they may have various shapes; and they may or may not
deform plastically under stress. In fact, the critical particle size
concept predicted.by Orowan has never been obgerved. The closest approach

has been the observation of Meikléjohn and Skodall

on the yield strength
of solid mercury containing iron particles. However, a parbticle size
effect was noted that canceled out the influence of particle spacing and
gave the net regsult that the yield strength was a function bnly of the
volume fraction of the precipitate. The silver-aluminum slloys referred
to in the previous section likewlise showed only a slight dependence of
strength upon aluminum-oxygen clugter gize bub exhibited a marked depend-

2

ence upon the volume fraction of the precipitate.l Recent transmission

elechron microscope studlies by Hornbogenlz

on iron-gold alloys and by
Teslie et al.?? on iron-bismuth alloys show that the second-phase par-
ticles can act as copious sources of dislocations. The cell structure
of dislocations originating from the particle offers more strengthening
than would be predicted by the Orowan concept of gtrengthening. Anothe

interesting effect is produced by cold working. Garofalo® pretreated

type 316 stainless steel specimens by solution annealing, cold working,
and aging. It was found that the strength was greatly improved by pre-
treatments which resulted in fine randomly dispersed carbide formation.
The resulting dislocation networks were studied and corrclated with the
mechanical properties of the steel. The degirable disloecation structure
congisted of tangles that had apparently been trapped by the precipitate
particles and the most undesirable structure was the stabilized cross
grids of dislocations which offered 1little back force on dislocation
motion.

One particularly important factor concerning the mechanical prop-
erties of refracteory metals Is the influence of substitutional alloying
clement on The strength attainable through the formation of a dispersed
pnase. The case of the aluminum alloy addition to silver and the forma-
tion of aluminum-oxygen clusters has already been dlscussed. One further
example is the influence of carbon on the properties of niobium. McCoyl5
and Cortes and Felld'® have independently shown that carbon additions up
to 0.21% do not result in measurable strengthening nor embrittlement of
niobium. The niobium-base alloys F-44 (No—15% Mo-1% Zr-C) and F-48
(lb—15% W—5% Mo—1% Zr—(C) are, however, strengthened by carbide dispersions
as illustrated by the data of Changl7 given 1n Table 2. The formation of
NboC in the latter alloy is due to the zirconlum content being 0.6% instead
of the nominal 1%. This illustrates the importance of the precise control
of the zirconium-to-carbon ratio in thege alloys. Begides being instru-
mental in the Initial formstion of a strengthening dispersion, a solid-

solution alloying element can affect the eoclubility of the precipitated

element. Both of theze factors increase the high-temperature stability

of the precipitate. The work of Hobsoni8

on the solubility of oxygen in
the Nb—1% Zr alloy illustrates the marked influence of zirconium content
on the oxygen solublility.

Some important factors and observations relative to dispersions
nhave heen discussed, but nothing has been said of ways of introducing
dispersions. The btwo major ways have acquired the names of artificial
and natural. The artificial technique involves the mixing and forming
of two powders by powder-metallurgy techniques. The material is then
hot worked to the desired shapes. The main disadvantage of this tech-
nique 1is that the dispersed phase is not fine enough to obtain maximum
strengthening. Some current effort is directed toward developing tech-
niques for producing fine powders. Du Pont has also announced the com-
mercial avallability of TD-Nickel, which iz a nickel-base material

in diameter, which Du Pont says is introduced by a "special chemical
process, now patented, of a colloidal nature, to achieve extremely fine,

uniform dispersion of hard parbicles in metals.” The natural technique

ormally involves internal oxidation; however, nitriding and carburizing
could be ubtilized equally as well. Zwilsky and Grant®? have used the
internal-oxidation technique to form Al,05 particles in copper-zluminun
alloys. Stress-rupture properties of the dispersion-strengthened alloy
at 850°C are superior to those of vpure copper at 450°C. These examples

serve to illustrate the potential of this area of materials strengthening.

THE MECHANTCAL PROPERTIES OF Nb, Mo, Ta, AND W

Although the authors have reviewed in detail the known available
literature on the mechanical propertles of these metals, an attempt will
not be made to recavitulate this Informmation in detail in this report.
The length of such a recaplitulation coupled with its lack of meaning has
led to this decision. Several factors tend to discount much of the
available data.

(1) The interstitial content of the test material is seldom
specified.

(2) Much of the work has been done on 25-g buttons that have
properties difficult to reproduce in 50-1Ib ingots.

(3) The condition of the material (e.g., solution annealed,
wrought, etc.) at the time of testing is frequently nol specified.
Conditions such as "annealed" arc of‘ten given which are not very helpful.

(4) The test atmosphere is often not designated. The term
"vacuum” is often used with no further qualifying statements. Whether
the vacuum is 1072 or 107% torr can make considerable differences in the
test results. The question of when the wvacuum was measured is important.
The vacuum may have been 107¢ torr at the end of a 100-hr creep test, but
may have been 1072 during the first 24 hr of the test.

(5) A lJarge portion of the research effort has been spent in
determining tensile data. For most applications such information is not
even useful as a screening criterion, since completely different deforma-
tion mechanisms can be operative at lower strain rates. The possible plit-

falls of extrapolating data from 0.1 to 10,000 hr need no amplifications.

 

20k, M. Zwilsky and N. J. Crant, Mebal Progr., 80: 108 (1.961).
The melting point data in Table 1 give some idea of The potential
applications of these four refractory metals. Basged on the criterion of
two thirds of the absolute melting point being the maximum service temper-
ature, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W can be used up to 1554, 1648, 1906, and 2183°C,
respectively. This criterion ignores the prospect of dispersion strength-
ening, since the SAP alloys are used at three fourths of their melting
points. It is also possible to raise the useful temperature slightly by
alloying to raise the melting point.

The available mechanical property data on several Nb-, Mo-, Ta-,
and W-base alloys are sumarized in Table 3. As is quite evident, stress-
rupture data are nol available on many of the alloys. Values of the
tensile-rupture ductility are not given because all of the alloys listed
have sufficient ductility at elevated temperatures. It is the ductility
at temperatures approaching room temperature that is a problem. The
ductile-to-brittle transition temperature for many of these alloys is
above room temperature. This is illustrated by the data®l in Fig. 1,
in which the reduction in area is the ductility parameter. It is empha-
sized that the temperature of this transition is not a fixed property of
the material but is raised by increasing the rate of straining or tri-
axiality of loading and is also.affected by composition as governed by
alloy additions and the presence of impurities, as well as by the heat
treatment and faebrication hilstory. Some assessment of the fabricability
of these alloys is also indicated. The strength-to-weight ratio is

included because of its interest for space application of these metals.

Nicbium-Base Alloys

 

Apprecieble strengthening of niobium has resulted from alloy
additions of Zr, Y, W, Hf, Ta, and Mo. It is quite difficult to say
what fraction of the strength improvement occurs as a result of solution

strengthening and what is a result of interactions of the alloying element

with interstitial impurities. The F~48 and F-50 alloys have been studied

by‘Chang.22

Both alloys were found to be age hardensble and the aging was
attributed to carbide precipitation. Studies?? of the Nb—1% Zr alloy have
alao shown it to be age hardenable under specific circumstances.

The tencile properties of anicbium are improved appreciably by the
addition of wvanadium. However, the creecp properties are not improvedd24’25
This illustrates the fact that a tensile test is not a valuable screening
test for engineering materials. The range of values found in the litera-

ture for the tensile strength of pure nicbium at 282°C indicates the un-

reliabllity of much of the mechanical property data on refractory metals.

Molybdenum-Base Alloys

 

Additiong of titanium and zirconium appreciably improve the mechan-
ical properties of molybdenum. Although this effect is often attributed
to solution gtrengthening, 1t seems more reasonsble that the strengthening
ie due to clustering or dispersion strengthening caused by substitutional-
interstitial atom interactions. Chang22 has studied the aging response of
the Mo-TZC alloy and has clearly established the precipitaticon-hardenable
nature of the alloy. Three dispersed phases were identifiled, consisting
of TiC, MooC, and ZrC. The formation of TiC was primarily responsible for
the aging, and ZrC was felt to have little influence on the strength.
Chang suggested that another Important role of the titanium was that of
enhancing the high-temperature solubility of carbon. Molybdenum, Mo-TZ,
and Mo—0.5% Ti were found not to be age hardenzble.

The Mo—~50 wt % Re (35 at. %) alloy has some very unigue properties.

twinning in the molybdenum-rhenium alloy at low temperatures. This alloy
ig also more resistant to oxygen embrittlement than pure molybdenum. 1In
pure molybdenum the oxide phase accunulates in the grain boundaries, thus
forming brittle grain boundary layers. The rhenium additlion influences
the surface energy of the oxide, and the oxide occurs as globules in the
grains as well as at the boundaries rather than as a continuous grain
houndary layer. The availabllity and ccst of rhenium make the widespread
use of the Mo—-50% Re alloy doubtful.

In addition to the composition variable that influences the proper-
ties of molybdenumn, fabricatlon is also an Important variable.?? This is
illustrated in ¥ig. 3. Note the very large differences 1ln room tempera-
ture ductility depending on whether the final rolling temperature is 1204

or 1648°C. BSignificant strength differences also result.

Tantalum-Base Alloys

 

Pure tantalum is relatively weak at elevated temperatures. Acditions
of W, Hf, MNb, and V to tantalum result in significant strengthening. The
influence of relatively low concentratlions of oxygen and nitrogen on the
elevated temperature behavior of tantalum has been investigated by
Schmidt et gl.zg Additions of 560 ppm O and 225 ppm N were not effective
strengtheners above 1100°C. However, carbon was an effective strengthener
up to 1200°C. No systematic study has been made of strengthening due to
interstitials when a substitutional alloying element is present.

Chang®® has worked with a complex tantalum-base alloy of the
nominal composition Ta—20% No—10% W—5% V-1% Zr-0.08% C. This alloy was
found 1o have a recrystallization temperature of 1704°C. Preliminary
studies have ghown that severe intergranular cracking occurred when

annealcd above 1648°C. Studies are continuing on this alloy.

Tungsten-Base Alloys

 

The data available on tungshben-base alloys are quite limited. The
pernefit of the molybdenum addition is questionable 1In light of the avall-
zble data glven in Teble 3. Since the atomic radii of tungsten and mclyb-
denum are 1.37 and 1.36 A, respectively, since they are in the same valence
group, and since the melting point of molybdenum 1e considerably leszs than
that of tungsten, this iz not contrary to expectations. The W—-30% Re alloy
has alttractive mechanical properties both with respect to strength and
ductility. Thecge benefits are believed to be derived by processes gimilar
to thoge described for the molybdenum-rheniuwm alloy. The availlability ana
cost of rhnenium are Tactors against this alloy.

An interesting piece of work has been done by Steigerwald.gﬁ_g&.Bo
on the influence of surface conditions on the ductile-te-brittle transi-
ticon of tungsten. The primary points of thie study are illustrated in
Fig. 4. The translition temperaturc was increased as the depth of surface
imperfection was increased. Fither surface oxidation or electropcliching
was effective in decreasing the transgition lemperature. It is of cconsid-
erahle practical importance that the transition temperature of a material

can be increased 204°C by fabrication variables.

INTERNATL FRICTTION STUDIES OF REFRACTORY-METAL SYSTEMS

Internal friction is a very useful tool for studying the vehavior
of interstitial aftoms in body-centered cubic metals. When the metal is
unstreceed, each of the three types of tetrahedral sites is equally
favorable for interstitlal atons. However, the application of a stress
distorts the lattice and causes certain sites to become more favorable
than others. This ordering of interstitial atoms upcen the application
of a stregs dissipates energy and recsults in the material having a high-
damping capacity. The measurement of this damping, which is commonly
called internal friction, glvesc a measure of the number of interstitial
atoms that are moving. A study of internal friction at various fre-

gquenciles can also give information about the kinetics of the process.

Since the internal friction 1s dependent upon the quantity of
interstitial atoms in scolution, measurements of intermal Triction offer
a very atiractive way of following a precipitation process. The prac-
tical aspects of such a technique are illustrated by studies of DijkstraBl
on the precipitation of nitrogen in Fe-Mn, Fe-Cr, Fe-Mo, and Fe-V alloys.
Tt was found that the presence of the binary substitutional alloy addition
grectly influenced the behavior of nitrogen from that observed in pure
iron. Additions!l peaks were observed that were attributed to the stress-
induced motion of nitrogen atoms in the vicinity of the alloy atoms.
Studies by Stephenson and McCoy32 have shown that similar behavior is
obgserved when zirconium is added to niobium. When either nitrogen or
oxygen is added to a niobium-zirconium alloy, peaks are observed that
are nol present in pure niobium. As the interstitial content is Increased,
the normal interstitial-niobium interaction peaks are obsgerved. This has
been interpreted ¢ mean that the interstitlial stoms are clustered about

the zirconium atoms.

EFFECTS OF IRRADIATION ON REFRACTORY METALS

The proposed use of niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and
alloys of Lhese metals as structural components in nuclear resclors
reguires that some knowledge be gained as to the effects of irradiation
upon the properties of theze materials. The purpose of the following
section is to critically enalyze the work which has been done Lo date

concerning this oroblem.
Niobium

A limited number of tube-burst tests have been run at 982 and
1093°C to evaluste the properties of the Nb—1% Zr alloy. Tt was origi-

nally reported Lthat the rupture life was less in an irradiation Tield

than out of the reactor. Recent hot-cell examinstions have led the

authors to retract their original conclusion, since all failures occurred

34 However, these

in the brazed joints rather than in the specimens.
results show that the rupture life of niobium is not drastically reduced
by irradiation, since the rupture lives of the in-pile specimens which

failed in the brazed joints were only slightly less than the out-of-pile

control specimens.
Molybdenum

Bruch, McHugh, and Hockenbury?® studied the mechanical properties
of commercially pure molybdenum irradisted in the MIR for an estimated
exposure of 1.9 to 5.9 X 10209 thermal nvt. The specimen temperature was
maintained et 90°C. The material used in this investigation was arc
melted by the Climax MOlybdenum;Company. Two heats of material were
used having carbon contents of 0.061 and 0.066 wt %. No other analytical
detalls were given. The material was hot worked to 5/8-in. diam,
annealed at 1100°C in hydrogen, and swaged to l/2~in. diam. The impli-
cation is that this lagt fabrication step was carried oulb ab room
temperature and represents a reduction in area of 36%. The test material
had an average hardness of 264 VPN (99.2 RB) and an average of
5000 grain/mmg.

The tensile specimens were rods having a gage section 1.00 in.
long and 0.182 in. in diameter. The strain rate used in the tensile
tests was 1.3 X 107% per second.

The results of tensile tests performed in this program are
summarized in Teble 4. The unirradiated material was ductile st —20°C
but was completely brittle at —40 and —60°C. The irradiated material
was completely brittle in tests conducted at room temperature and 60°C

but was ductile at 80°C. Hence, the ductile-to-brittle transition

temperature increased from sboult =30 to +70°C., Unirradisted and
irradiated specimens were not tested at comparable temperstures at
which each deformed plasﬁically s0 that a meaningful comparison of the
strength could be made. Bruch EE.E1-35 do not meke any comments con-
cerning the relaltive values of the elongation and reduction in ares.
However, 1t seems that an important trend exists. In the unirradiated
zpecimens, the uniform elongation is over one helf the value of the
reduction in srea. In the irradiated specimens, the elongation is only
one Tifth to one gixth the value of the reduction in area. A possible
explanation of this observation is that the irradiagtion-induced defects
pin the dislocations in the metal so that the gtress to cause plastile
deformation i1s gquite high. When this stress is exceeded, the dig-
locationg break away From tLheir pinning defects with such driving Torce
that the normal processes of work hardening are ineffective. Hence,
failure occurs with very high local deformation and very small uniform
elongation.

Several metallographic specimens were included in the tests of

Bruch EE al.35

———

They were polished and photographed at points marked
with hardness impressions before insertlon into the experiment. Photo-
graphs were made of the same Tlelds after irradiation withoul further
polishing. It was concluded that no visgible mefallographic changes
occurred.

The results of hardneszs tests performed before and after irradi-
ation are given in Table 5. The hardness increased by approximately
35 BHN as a result of the irradiation. In the last paragraph of their
paper, the authors inserted some azdditional data concerning Irradiation
hardening. Few experimental details are given. OSpecimens were irradi-
ated at 400°C for an estimated 3 X 100 thermal nvt (3 X 10%7 rast nvi)
and found to increase in hardness from 169 to 216 BHN (converted from
RB velues). These results indicabte that the defects are introduced by
the irradiztion abt a rate greater than they can be annealed out at

Mekin end Gillies?® fnvesti lgabed the affects of neutron irradi-
aticn on the mechanical properties of molybdenum. The tesgt meterial
wag obtained from the Johnson, Matthey and Company, ILtd., in the form
of 0.040-1in.~diam wire. A complete spectrographic analysis of the
maberial was given, but no mention was made of interstitial impurities.
The wires were given a stresg-relief annesl at 1030°C for 30 min. The
specimens were lrradiated Tor six months in a Windscale pile at approxi-
mately 100°C. The flux was 6 X 10%2 thermal nv and the integrated
thermal flux was 5 X 10'% nvt. The ratio of fast to thermal neutrons
wag estimeted to be unity. Tensile tegts were run on a HoungTield
Tensometer at a strain rate of 8.2 X 1072 ver second. The ductile-to-
brittle transitlon temperature was debermined by bend tests on the
0.040-1n. ~-diam wires. OSpecimensg were defined ss ductile when they could
be bent 90° around a pin of 6-mm diam without fracture. The strain rate
in the bend tests was designabted zs "slow." Eight specimens were used
to determine each transitlion temperature to a reported accuracy of *2°C.

The results of postirradiation tensile tests over the temperature
range of 20 to 200°C are given in Table &. TFour specimens were tegted
at each condition. The yield stress wag increased by irradiation over
the enbire range of test temperatures, the effect becoming more pro-
nounced with increasing tempersture. The ultimate strength changed in
a similar manner. Yield points were obzerved in the irradiated and
unirradiated specimens tested gt 20°C. However, the drop in stress
asgociated with the yield point of the irradiated material was the
greatest and, at 83°C, only the irradiafed material showed a yield
point. Neither material exhibited a yield point at the 200°C test
temperature. The elongation at rupture was, in general, decrsased
slightly by the irradiation. The 200°C test condition wag an exception
with slightly greater elongation occurring in the irradiated specimen.

However, the elongation of both materizls was gquite low.

Bend tests showed that the irradiation dose of 5 X 10%° nvt
raised the ductile~to-brittle transition temperature from —136 & 1°C
to =73 * 1°C, a rise of about 63°C. Attempts were made to study the
recovery characteristics of the radiation effect by annealing treat-
ments, but the complexity of the process coupled with the small number
of specimens prevented conclusive results from being obtained. Makin
and Gillieg>® explained their results in terms of both ilmpurity atoms
and irradiation-produced defects. It was postulated that the influence
of the defects produced by irradiation was not fully observed until the
test temperature was increased to about 200°C. Since quite large yield
points could be produced by postirradiation annealing at 200°C, it was
concluded that the defects were mobile at this temperature.

Studies of recovery in cold-worked molybdenum in a radiation
field by Kinchin and Thompson37 revealed a reCUvery stage at 150°C.

From the activation energy of 1.3 ev, the procegs wag felt to be vacancy
migration. This obsgervation led Makin and Gillies to conclude that
vacancies were the important defects in their specimens.

Makin and Gillies discuss thelr results in light of those obtained
by Bruch et §£.35 The former authors observed the transition tempera-
ture to increase from =136 to —73°C (+63°C) after a dose of 5 X 10%% uvt.
The latter authors reported an increase from =30 to +70°C (+100°C) after
a dose of 1.9 to 5.9 X 10%°° nvt. It was concluded by Makin and Gillies
that the magnitude of the increase in the transition temperature was not
proportional to the neubron dose. This seems a rather dangerous con-
clusion in light of the different metallurgical histories of the test
material, possible chemical differences, use of 0.040-in.~-diam wires vs
0.182-in.-diam rods as specimens, and uncertainties in flux measurements.

tr

Another concluzion based upon this comparison was that ~...it 1s possible

that the greatesgt effect is produced in materials pogsessing initially

t

the lowest tranzition temperature. In light of the uncertainties just
mentioned, this conclusion is not supported by fthe available data.
Althougn Mekin and Gillies gseemed to realize thisg, this has been passed

on through the literaiure as a general rule.

Recovery in Molybdenum and Tungsten,"” J. Nucl. Energy, 6: 27584 (1958).

 
3C

Bruch g§‘§£.38 discuss the general problem of irradiation damage
in a later paper. In this paper, an attempt was made to assess the
relative efTects of irradiation on high-purity copper, nickel, zirconium,
end iron, commercial grade 75A titanium, commerical-purity molybdenum,
and cold-worked and anneasled type 347 stainless steel. The data on
molybdenun presented in this paper are the zame as presented esrlier.
However, some general statements were made which have bearing upon the
properties of molybdenum. Although it is nol possible to czlculate the
nurber of vacancy interstitial psairs which exist in a metal in a radia-
tion field at a given time due to complex annealing and other inter-
aclions, reasonable models exist Tor calculating the total number of
such pairs that have been produced by a given flux. 8Such caleculastions
for the metals mentioned above showed that only minor differences
existed In the number of pairs produced in the metals. Hence, 1t was
concluded that the very large differences in the effect of comparable
doges on the properties of these metals were due to factors such as
the annealing of defects or variations among metals in the property

change produced by & given defect.
Tantalum

Franklin et §£.39 have run a limited number of postirradiation
tests on tantslum and two tantalum-tungsten 21loys to evaluate the
effect of irradiastion on the mechanical properties. Besides the lattice
defects normally produced by irradistion, tantalum ig 2lso convertsd to
tungsten by the thermal neutron reaction Tal®l(n,y)Tal®2(—£) W82, The
intrinsic effects of the two processes were evalusted by comparing the
properties of the irradiated specimens with those of control specimens
containing comparsble amounts of tungsten. The analysis of the test

material is given in Table 7. Sheetl zpecimens were used which had =

The yield strength of the irradiszted specimens incresged nearly three
times over that of the unirrsdiated tantaelum. The properties of the
arc-melted =2lloys showed that the Increase in strength could not be
accounted for in terms of the tungsten content since only minor strangth
changes resulted from the addition of up te 3 wbt ¢ W. Hence, the change
in strength was attributed to some mechanism of defect production by
neutrons., Table & slso illustratez the nmarked reduction in ductility
which occurred as a result of irrsdiation. However, the data indicate
that a large portion of the ductility effect can be attributed to the
tungesten content of the specimens.

Tantalum showed a large increase in hardness aflter irradiation.
The hardness changed from 103 to 309 KHN after an integrated thermal
dose of 1.8 X 10%* nvt. The hardnesses of the tantalum elloys containing
1.5 and 3.0 wt % W were 151 aud 170 KHN, respectively.

Sutton and Leeser4o

reported the results of a limited number of
room-temperature postirradiation tensile Lests on tantalum. WNo experi-
wental detalls other than neutron dose were glven. The results of these
tests are given in Table 2, Irradiation appears to ralse the ultimate
strength and decresse the rupture ductility.

The effects of bombardment by 13.7-Mev deuterons on the internal

by Muss and Townsend. **  Trradistions were carried cub at 200°% using

the nature of the bombarding particles, the number of defects produced
by deuterons is approximately 1000 times greater than the number pro-
duced by a comparable dose of neutrons. The test material was
0.0015~in.-diam tungsten wire supplied by the Sylvania Company. The
wire was designated as type NS-50, but no composition was given. The
modulils and internal friction measurements were made using a mechanical
resonance system consisting of the tungsten wire mounted as a cantilever.

Preirradiation internal Triction measurements as a function of
tenmperature showed that a reproducible peak occurred at 14C°K. This
pezk was Tound to occur at higher temperatures as the frequency of
vibration was increased. This is a characteristic of z relaxation
phenomenon and 1t was postulated that this peak was due to the thermal
activation of dislocationsg. The data of this study and those of
Chanbers and Schultz*? were combined to obtain an activation energy for
the process of 0.21 * 0.05 ev,

The effectsg of integrated dose rate on tungslten were evaluated
at an irradiation temperature of 295°%K. The internal Triction decreased

and Young's modulus increased. Both of these effects were found to fit

the model of a dislocation pinning mechanism that was proposed by

43

Dieckamp and Sosin. The pinning in this case was concluded to be

due to interstitials. This conclusion was based on the work of Kinchin

4“4 yhich showed that radiation-induced interstitials begin

and Thompson
to anneal out at 80K whereas vsacanciles become mobile at 650°K. The
internal Triction effect began to saturate at an integrated flux of
sbout 2 X 1019 deuter@ns/cma. The elastic modulus went through an
inflection at approximately the same dose and decreasged linearly with
increasing dose. This decrease wag explained in terms of the bulk
effect of vacasncies being frozen into the lattice. Thig effect amounted
quantitatively to a 0.44% decrease in Young's modulus per atomic percent
vacancies. The amplibude of the internal Ffriction pesk at 140%K and
bhe vackground internal friction were found to. decrease ag a result of
irradistion. This was attributed to dislocation pioning. However,
after irradiation geveral small peaks appeared in the iaternal friction
spectrum that were not satisfactorily explained.

Medcin and Gillies®® studied the effects of neutron irradiation
orni the mechanical properties of tungsten. The material used in this
investigation was obtained from the Johnson, Matthey and Company, Ltd.,
in the form of 0.040-in.~dism wire. A complete spectrographic analysis
of the material wes given, bubl no menticn wag made of interstitial
impurities. The specimEHS'were.fully recrystallized by avnealing 30 min
at 1600°C. The gpecimens were irradiated for six months in a Windscale
pite at approximately 100°C. The flux was 6 X 10%° thermal nv and the
total integrated thermal flux was 5 X 10Y7 nvt. The ratio of fast to
thermal neutrons was not known accurately but was estimated to be unity.

Control specimens were annealed at an egquivalent temperature and time.

Tensile tests were run on a Hounsfield Tensometer at a strain rate of
8.2 % 1077 per secoand. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature
was determined by bend tests on the 0.040-in.-diam wires. Specimens
were defined as ductile when they could be bent 907 around a pin of
60-mm diam without fracture. The strain rate was given as 'slow."
Bight specimens were used to determine each transition termperature
and the reported accuracy is *2°C,

The results of tensile postirradiation tests at 100 and 200°C
are compared with the results obtained from control specimens in Table 10.
Although no statement is made of the exact nuwber of specimens tested,
the implication is that these are average values. Both the irradialed
and unirradiated specimens were brittle at 100°C. However, the fracture
stress was raised by the irradiation. At 200°C the yield strength was
increased by irradiation but the vltimate strength was unaffected. The
elongation at rupture and reduction in area at 200°C were increased by
irradiation. Smooth stress-gstrain curves were obtained with no yield
points being observed. The ductile-to-brittle Transition temperature

was increased Tfrom 118 +£ 2°C to 126 * 2°C by the irradiation.

SUMMARY

The available data on the mechanical behavior of nicbium, molyb-
denum, tantalum, and tungsten have been reviewed critically. BSeveral
important conclusions have been reached as s result of this study — the

A
¥
w

most important one being that insufficient engineering data are available
for the design of complex systems using refractory metals and structural
materials. It was also Tound that esch of the four metals reviewed has
certain unique properties That mske it degirable for specific application.
Molybdenum and tungsten have low coefficients of thermal expansion
which may more nesrily match those of cermets and ceramic components.

Thege materials also have high moduli of elasticity which are desirable
38

from a design standpoint. However, both of these materials present
problems with respect to fabricstility. Niobium has a very low modulus
of elasticity — an undesirable feature. Niobium and tantalum are
relatively easy to Tabricate and have good duetility. Nicobium and
molybdenum have low neutron absorption cross sectlons, whereas tantalum
and tungsten are an order of magnitude higher.

Because of the complexity of high-temperature nuclear systems,
materials are needed that have & variety of properties. Hence, al this
stage of refractory-metal technology it is important not to limit our
studies to Lhose metals that can be fabricated into tubing or those
metals thatl can be welded, since there may be gpplications for which
such materisls can be used in different parts of the reactor. Also,
service conditions such as stress, temperature, temperature cycle, and
desgired nuclear propertics must be known.

In order to expedite the development of the technology necessary
for the use of refractory metals in engineering systems, 1t i1s felt that
persong involved in evaluzating the mechanicsal behavior of these metals
should consider the following factors.

1. A lot of deception is being injected into this field by the
production of small melfs of alloys and by the evaluation of thes
z1lloys by short-time tensile tests. These small melts often are made
under nonreproducible conditions and are fabricated by unknown pro-
cedures. Unlegs the application 1s one requiving a short life, the
use of short-time tensile tests for screcning purposes can be very
deceiving. Short creep teszsts of 10 to 100 hr duraticn are better
screening tests for materials to be used in long-time aspplications.

2. More attention needs to be given to deformation mechanisms
in refractory metals. Just as the strength of many superalloys fear
exceeds that of pure iron and nickel, so can the properties of refrac-
tory superalloys excel tLhose of the pure refracltory metals 1T one
learns more sbout the ceformation mechanisms in refractory metals.
Fabrication procedure and impurity content can be used to an advantage
if understood. Dispersed phases may possibly be found important in

these alloys. It may be found that these dispersions Improve the
39

strength by impeding dislocation motion as well as serving as sources
for dislocations in normelly brittle materials. Hence, the production
of ultra-pure alloys by electron-beam melting may not be the most
practlical approach to ductile molybdenum and tungsten.

3. The more promising alloys need to be evaluated with respect
to their strength and metallurgical stability over long periods of time.

4, BExperiments should be carried out to evaluate the behsvior
of refractory metals under neutron irradiation at ambient and elevated
temperatures. These studies should be directed toward defining mecha-
nisms regponsible for the different mechanical behavior under irradia-
tion and hence would make it possible to design alloys which are not

greatly altered by irradiation.
