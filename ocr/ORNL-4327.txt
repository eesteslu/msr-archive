GRAPHITES — A SURVEY REPORT

W. L. Greenstreet

Abstract

A review of published mechanical properties data for
artificial graphites is given in this report; high-tempera-
ture as well as room-temperature data are included. The
intent is to provide a unified description of the complex
mechanical behavior associated with these materials. The
report also contains a brief history on graphite and discus-
sions of crystalline structure and of manufacturing methods.

Introduction

This report was written to provide a survey of mechanical properties
data for artificial graphites, or electrographites. Although brief re-
views of these data are to be found in the literature, there is a need
for an overall description which unifies the many aspects of the complex
mechanical behavior associated with these materials. This report was
written with such unification as a major objective. We have chosen to
limit our consideration, in the main, to so-called "nuclear-grade, or
equivalent," electrographites, that is, either molded.or extruded graph-
ites made from petroleum coke and coal-tar pitch. Included in this se-
lected group are premium quality and-specialty graphites.

As a.prelude to the discussion of mechanical properties, a brief his-
tory on graphite is given. This is followed by descriptions of crystal-
line structure and of the manufacture of artifiéial graphite. The history
section traces developments leading to the manufacture of graphite With-
brief mention of the use of this material in the nuclear industry.

Although the data considered are of a phenomenological nature on the
macroscopic scale, a knowledge of crystalline structure and manufacturing

methods is necessary to the understanding of graphite behavior. Hence,
rudimentary discussions of these aspects are included as essential parts
of this report.

Both room- and high-temperature data are reviewed with the greatest
emphasis being placed on the former. 1In the case of room-temperature be-
havior, simple tensile and compressive stress-strain curves for monotonic
and for cyclic loading are considered. Lateral as well as longitudinal
strain data are reviewed. The discussion of behavior under combined
stresses is necessarily brief due to the paucity of reported data on this

subject.

Carbon and the History of Graphite

 

Aside from its use as a fuel, carbon plays a very important part in
our everyday existence. Its great importance  in industry is emphasized
by the volume and dollar amounts of carbon and graphite products produced.
Liggett [196L4] tells us that the estimated world production in 1962 was
in excess of 1.4 billion pounds with a domestic value of about $400 mil-
lion. The United States, France, Japan, West Germany, and England are
the major producers and exporters of carbon and graphite. These five
countries account for approximately T75% of the world production. Of
these, the United States is the leader, producing in 1962 an estimated
410.2 million pounds with a value of about $151.7 million.

It would be superfluous to enter into a lengthy discussion of car-
bon and its uses here since our interest centers only on artificial graph-
ites. Uses of carbon in its elemental or allotropic and mahufactured or
fabricated forms are given by Mantell [1946].. The introduction in this
book contains an interesting summary showing the scope of applications.

A recent account of the uses is given in the Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia

of Chemical Technology, Vol. 4, 196L.

 

 

Diamond and graphite are allotropic crystalline forms of carbon.
Nightingale [1962c] describes "amorphous carbons," the third form of car-
bon found in nature, as those carbons in whioh the graphite structure is
not completely developed or in which the graphitic structure is limited
to volumes on the order of a few thousand angstroms. Examples of "amor-

phous carbons” are coal and lignite. Hence we see that all natural forms

 
of carbon are crystaliine. Both graphite and diamond can be synthesized.
Diamond is completely converted to graphite when heated to 2000°C (Black-
‘man [1960b]) .

At atmospheric bréssure, graphite sublimes directly into the gaseous
state. Blackman [1960b] reports the sublimation temperature as around
3500 to 3700°C, while Walker [1962] quotes a value of around 3%350°C.
These figures indicate the potential of graphite as a refractory. Graph-
ite is characterized by high thermal conductivities, low coefficients of
thermal expansion, low elastic moduli, and strengths which increase with
temperature to about 2500°C. Hence, it is an excellent high temperature
material.

While diamond is one of the hardest substances known, graphite is
one of the softest. The firsf discoveries of graphite are lost in antig-
uity. Mantell [1946] tells us that it was known in early times since it
was used for decorative purposes in prehistoric burial places in Europe
and in ancient graves. It was long confused with other minerals includ-
ing ores of lead, molybdenum, antimony, and manganese. These were be-
lieved to be one and the same substance, or at least members of the same
family. Acheson [1899] attributes this confusion to their outward resem-
blance and to the fact that they produce mérks on paper. Because of this
graphite was called molybdaena, plumbago, graphite, and black-lead.

The true identify of graphite, or plumbago, was not recognized until
late in the 18th century when the Swedish apothecary, Carl Wilhelm Scheele,
demonstrated its carbon content (Thorpe [1894]).. Mantell credits the
German mineralogist (Abraham Gottldb) Werner with givinglthe mineral the
name graphite (from the Greek word graphein, "to write") in 1789. Aikin
and Aikin [1814] concluded from the results of three independent experi-
ments on combustion, which at that time were recently completed, that no
decided chemical difference can be detected between diamond, pure plum-
bégo, and charcoal.

The earliest use of graphite was undoubtedly as an instrument for
drawing and writing. The first mention of it is found in the Middle Ages .
where it is described as a substance used.for this purpose (Mantell

[1946]) . In 1564 the Barrowdale graphite deposit in Cumberland, England,
was diécovered with the result that the manufacture of lead pencils on
a commercial scale was originated. Accbrding to Seeley and Emendorfer
[1949], authentic records show the use of clay-graphite crucibles in
Bavaria in 1400. Thus, Nicholson [1795] gives the use of plumbago as a
material for making pencils and crucibles. He stated that powder of
plumbago, with three times its weight in clay and some hair, makes an
excellent coating for retorts, and, fﬁrther, that the Hessian crucibles
were composed of the same materials.

Aikin and Aikin [1807] list, in addition to the above uses, the use
of graphite as a lubricant for machining instead of o0il and as a sub-
stance for the protection of iron from rust. ¥Finally, natural graphite
is still used today in the manufacture of crucibles, certain molds and
other equipment for foundry work and metal smelting, and for pencils.

It is a major constituent in lubricéting mixtures and in the rubber tire
industry for hardening and improving wear resistance. These are a few
of the many uses; for more information, see Seeley [1964].

Manufactured; or artificial, graphite is used in many applications
made possible by the existence of this product, and it can now be sub-
stituted for natural graphite in almost all uses of the latter material.
Artificial graphite products can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes,
and the properties can be adjusted during manufacture to tailor the ma-
terial to the specific requirements of a given application. Artificial
graphite is actually a crystalline graphite, with the only artificial
attribute being the method of production. While natural graphite practi-
cally always contains admixtured impurities, artificial graphites with
purities that may exceed 99.999% carbon (Eatherly and Piper [1962]) can
e manufactured.

The history of the artificial graphite industry is closely related
to the development of carbon electrodes. It is generally believed that
Sir Humphry Davy was the first to use carbon electrodes with the electric
arc. In a letter to Nicholson, which was written in 1800 (Davy, J.
[1839]), Davy tells of finding that well-burned charcoal produces shock
and sparks when connected to the ends of a voltaic pile, or battery. He

also tells of the use of two long, thin sli@s of dry charcoal (carbon

 
electrodes), connected to a voltaic pile, in the decomposition of water.
Later, in 1802, Davy described a spark "of vivid whiteness" which was ob-
tained when pieces of well-burned charcoal were connected to a battery
(Davy, J. [1839]).

During succeeding years, batteries with increased power were made,
and in his writings published in 1812 (Davy, J. [1840]) Davy talks of
points of charcoal connected to a battery producing "a light so vivid,
that even the sunshine compared with it seemed feeble." In this same
reference, we find that Davy used a powerful 2000 double-plate battery
of the Royal Institution (sometimes referred to as the "great battery"
of the Royal Institution) with two pieces of charcocal, each about 1l-in.
long and 1/6 in. in diameter, to produce a constant discharge of at least
4 in. in length ﬁhich produced a brilliant arch of lightﬂ In addition, -
he was able to producé a discharge 6 or 7 in. in length in a partial vac-
uum. This was the forerunner of great developments.

During most of the 19th century, the majority of the development
work in the carbon industry was directed toward giving improved electrodes.
Hinckley [1921] points out that impetus for this was provided by the in-
vention of the dynamo and the development of great quantities of hydro- |
electric power at Niagara Falls. _(Details of the carbon electrode devel-
opments during this period are given by Mantell [1928, 1946].) The
Frenchman, M. F. Carré, 1s called the founder of the arc-carbon industry.
His electrodes were made of pulverized pure coke, calcined lampblack,
and sugar syrup; the mixture was patented in 1876. He pounded these in-
gredients together and.kneaded them into a hard paste, then pressed the
paste hydraulically and baked it at high temperature. The superiority
of his product was described by him in Carré [1877]. '

Carré therefore established the crude beginnings of the industrial
operations of célcining, grinding, mixing, shaping, and baking. These
general operations in the manufacture of electrodes are largely followed
today, although improvements have been made in every one of these steps.

Carré's mixture also indicates the raw materials used in making manu-
factured carbons. These are (1) the carbonaceous particles making up the

bulk of the product, termed "body" materials, and (2) "binders," which
serve to hold together the finely ground particles of the "body" materi-
als. Miscellaneous substances_are added to the mixture to give certain
specific physical or mechanical properties.

Hinckley [1921] reports that before 1850 small quantities of graph-
ite were made in an-electric furnace and the tips of carbon'electrodes
after use for some time were found to be converted to graphite. However,
the comercial production of artificial graphite did not begin until near
the end of the 19th century. Castner was granted a United Statés patent
for electrical baking of carbon electrodes in 1896 (Castner [1896]), and
in the same Year, Acheson, then of the Carborundum Company, obtained a
patent (Acheson [1896]) for the manufacture of graphite in an electric
furnace.

Acheson discovered that graphite can be produced in an electric fur-
nace while studying the effect of very high temperature on carborundum,
‘or silicon carbide. He found that the material decomposed with the sili-
con being vaporized and carbon being left behind not in the amorphous but
in a graphitic form. Fitzgerald [1897] in describing the manufacture of
carborundum referred to the formation of pure gréphite next to the core
of the furnace. He told of Acheson's conclusion that graphite is not
formed simply by the process of subjecting amorphous carbon to very high
temperature. Instead, the carbon enters into chemical combination with
some oOther element and this compound then decomposes, leaving carbon in
graphitic form. Additional discussion about the formation of graphite in
the electric furnace is given by Acheson [1899]. Concerning his method
for the production of graphite he states:

"This method of manufacturing graphite, I would define, as con-
sisting in heating carbon, in association with one or more oxides,
to a temperature sufficiently high to cause a chemical reaction
between the constituents, and then continuing the heating until
the combined carbon separates in the free state. It is not,

- however, limited to the use of oxides, as pure metals, their
sulfides, and other salts may be used; but for various reasons
the oxides are to be preferred.”

Although many metal carbides do decompose to yield well crystallized
graphite, Acheson's conclusion is fallacious. During the 1920's and
1930's, investigators at the National Carbon Company disproved his con-

clusion in many controlled experiments. It is, for example, possible to

 
show that a pure petroleum coke undergoes at least as high a degree of
graphitization as one with added iron, iron oxide, or other similar im-
purities (MacPherson [19681).

The stages of manufacture of carbon and of graphite electrodes are
very similar. True electrographites, or artificial graphites, are made
up as "amorphous" carbons or graphite carbons, but are given a final very
high heat treatment to transform microecrystalline carbon into crystailine
graphite (Kingswood [1953c]). This last step is called the graphitization
process. The differences between carbon and graphite and the temperatures
involved in graphite production will be discussed presently.

Mantell reports that in June 1897, Acheson produced the first graphite
electrodes. These were made at the reguest of Castner for use in electro-
chemical processes. Three years after the patent for graphite manufacture
was granted, the Acheson Graphite Company was incorporated and began to
build a plant at Niagara Falls, which became the center of the industry.
By that time [1899] Acheson had used the furnaces of the Carborundum Com-
pany for a year or more and had produced over 200,000 carbon electrodes
15-in. long and having a cross-sectional area of 1 in.® for use in the
Castner alkali process, both in the United States and in Furope (Acheson
[1899]) . The life of these electrodes was many times that of the same
electrodes ungraphitized.

Electric resistance furnaces of the type invented by Achescn [1895]
are used today for the graphitization process. His was the first electric
furnace in which temperatures approaching 3000°C, as needed for graphit-
ization, could be attained. |

As stated by Walker [1962]:

"This marked the beginning of a new era in which the carbon in-
dustry expanded and developed improved baked and graphitized
carbon for use primarily in (1) electrolytic manufacture — e.g.,
of alkalies, chlorine, aluminum, and manganese; (2) electro-
thermic production — e.g., of calcium carbide and silicon car-
bide; and (5) electric furnaces — e.g., for steel, copper, ferro-
alloys, and phosphorous. Then in 1942, when Fermi and a group of
scientists produced a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction,
they used graphite as a moderator in their reactor. This opened
up a whole new outlet for graphite and at the same time produced
materials problems on which much research and development studies
are still in progress."
We must add to this by saying that nuclear reactor applications and the
more recent uses in.the aerospace fields have demanded a thorough exami-
nation of the mechanical properties of artificial graphites. These prop-
erties received little attention, as evidenced by published works, prior
to their use in these advanced technological applications.

Currie, Hamister, and MacPherson [1956] point out that graphite was
selected as a neutron moderating material in the first nuclear reactors
because it was the most readily available material that had reasonably
good moderating properties and a low neutron capture cross section. In
addition, its use was made widespread due to its low cost and the ease
with which it can be precisely machined. Smyth [1948] gives a historical
account of the first uses of graphite in the nuclear industry. Night-
ingale [1962b] lists 75 graphite-moderated reactors which were in opera-
tion, under construction, or definitely planned at the time of writing.
The number aiso includes reactors which were taken oﬁt of operation but
omits a few low-power training and educatiohal reactors. Gwinn [1949]
states that the use of graphite as a moderator in the- plutonium piles in
the atomic energy plants at the University of Chicago and Hanford, Wash-
. ington, is perhaps the most dramatic and widely publicized application of
this material. This application was announced in 1945.

In addition to the appellation "artificial graphite," the terms "syn-

mn f1 n 1

thetic graphite,'" "graphitized products," "electrographite,' or "graphite"
réfer to those products in which "baked carbon" is further heat treated,
generally in an electric furnace, at temperatures of 2200°C or higher
(Liggett [1964]). Artificial grarvhite can be made from almost any or-
gariic material that leaves a high carbon residue on heating. However,
since the beginniﬁg of the industry, the principal material_used for
making up the bulk of the finished article (called "pody material" or
"filler material") was probably petroleum ccke (MacPherson'[l968]). The
growth of the petroleum industry resulted in increased availability of
petroleum coke, which was found to be the purest form of carbon available
in large quantities. Thus, petroleum coke has remained the principal ma-
terial for graphite manufacture, and this preeminence is held throughout

the world today.
In the first edition of his book on the carbon industries, Mantell
[1928] lamented the paucity of information by writing:

"While most industries have a more or less abundant literature,
with numerous books, pamphlets, and articles, the manufacture
of carbon electrodes is a notable exception. Were it not to be
considered sarcasm, the industry might even be referred to as a
'black art!, first because of the secrecy usually surrounding
its processes, and second, because of the absolute physical
dirtiness of the usual electrode plant. Carbon works have
generally been regarded as fortifications, through whose gates
only the initiated might enter. Most of the manufacturers have
been of the opinion that the less said on the subject the better
for them. One reason for this, perhaps, is that in Europe, the
art of manufacturing high-grade electrodes was always regarded
as a secret, of which only a few had definite knowledge."

An echo to this state of affairs is perhaps represented by the choice of
title, "Black Magic," by Speer Carbon Company [1949], for their booklet
issued on the occasion of the 50th énniversary celebratioh of the company.
However, the situation changed drastically after that time, particu-
larly since 1950, and dearth has been réplaced by deluge. The literature
now abounds with published works on carbons and graphites, with a notable
exception being the subject of mechanical behavior of graphite under com-
bined stress states. Survey articles have been written by Kingswood
[195%a, 1953b, 1953%c, 1953d], by Currie, Hamister, and MacPherson [1956],
by Blackman [1960a, 196Cb, 1960c], by Walker [1962], and by Shobert [1964L].
The article by Currie et al. details the influences of raw materials and
processing methods upon variations in properties of artificial graphites.
Books on this subject, in addition to those by Mantell [1928, 1946],
are Ubbelohode and Lewis [1960], Nightingale [1962a], and Union Carbide
Corporation.[l96h]. The book by Simmons [1965] is of less general inter-

est since it is devoted to nuclear-irradiation effects on graphite.

Structure

The hexagonal lattice structure proposed by Bernal [192k] is now
accepted as the ideal structure for graphite. This is a layered struc-
ture and is composed of a syétem of infinite layers of fused hexagons,
that is, the atoms of‘carbon in graphite lie in planes in which they form

sets of hexagons. The nets are in successive parallel planes superposed
10

so that half the atoms in one net lie normally above half the atoms in

the net beneath, while the other half lie normally above the centers of
the hexagons of this net; see Fig. 1. Since alternate nets lie atom forr
atom normally above each other, the stacking sequence is ABAB .... .

‘ The carbon atom spacing within a plane is 1.415 3, while the separa-
tion between parallel layers is 3.3538 E (15°C) (Walker [1962]). The theo-
retical density for this structure is 2.267 g/cm® (Blackmen [1960a]). The
carbon atoms in the layer planes are held by strong valence forces, where-
as the interplanar binding forces are very weak. Joined atoms between
layers are pinned by weak forces allowing adjacent planés to be easily
displaced parallel to each other or rotated around an axis perpehdicular
to the planes. In addition, this feature probably accounts for the aniso-
tropic properties of graphite crystals such as shown by electrical con-
ductivity, thermal conductivity, and linear expansion measurements. The
electrical and thermal conductivities are greater in directions parallel
to the layer pilanes than normal to them, while the thermal expansion is
greater in the direction normal to the layer planes.

Although the most common stacking in graphite is hexdgonal; in some
cases a small percentage has a lattice in which the carbon hexagons have
shared edges, but the stacking of hexagonal plates in layers 1is such that
every fou:th layer is in juxtaposition with respect to the c-axis (the

axis normal to the planes). Thus, the stacking sequence is ABC ABC ...;

see Pig. 2. This modified lattice, called rhombohedral, was proposed by
Lipson and Stokes [1942]. It is not usually present in artificial graph-
ite, but is found in natural graphite. This form is metastable with re-
speét to the hexagonal form from which it may be produced by mechanical
deformation, as in fine grinding (Bacon [1952]). It reverts to the hex-
agonal form on heating to 1300°C.

Deviations from the ideal graphite structure among most carbons of
cormercial interest are prevalent (Walker [1962]). The most important
deviation is the presence of stacking disorders between layer planes in
carbon. Since it allows us to bring out an important distinction between
carbon and graphite, this deviation will be described here.*

The simple analogy of Seeley [1964] in terms of a deck of playing
cards provides a clear illustration. Suppose each card represents a sin-
gle plane of hexagons in which the carbon atoms are ordered in two dimen-

sions with the proper spacings. When the deck is evened at the sides and

 

*Chemically, there is a ready means for differentiating between amor-
phous carbon and graphite. One part of the substance to be tested is
treated with three parts of potassium chlorate and sufficient concentrated
nitric acid to render the mass liquid. The mixture is then heated on a
water bath for several days. GCraphite is converted into golden yellow
flakes of graphitic acid, while amorphous carbon is altered to a brown
substance soluble in water (Mantell [1946]).

at the ends, ready for dealing, it has three-dimensional ordering and may
be considered as representing graphite structure. After the cards are
dealt, played, and bunched without evening the ends and sides nor rotating
the cards for redealing, the deck represents turbostratic structure.

This is the structure of so-called amorphous carbon, that is, the cards,
though parallel, are without order in the third dimension.®

Refinements are required to complete the analogy. Hexagonal graph-
itic structure requires that every other card in the ordered deck be moved
laterally the same distance and that the cards be the equivalent of 3.3538
R apart. The vertical distance between cards represents the interlayer,
or d, spacing in the crystalline structure.

Franklin [1951] concluded from an analysis of many nongraphitic and
graphitic carbons that two distinct and well-defined interlayer spacings
exist for a system of parallel carbon macromolecules. These are 3.4L4 A
between adjacent misoriented layers and 3%.354 K.between correctly oriented
layers. Hence, the turbostratic structure of carbon requires that each
card in the bunched deck be separated by a minimum of 3.4LL A.

Through the work of Franklin [1951] and Bacon [1951] the d spacing
has been related to the proportion of diéoriented layers, p. With in-
creagsed disorder of the layer stacking from ideal graphite, p varies from
O to 1. Thus, using X-ray diffraction patterns to determine p, the ratio
of graphitic carbon to nongraphitic carbon in a specimen can be estimated

from its mean d spacing.

Manufacture

To complete the general description of artificial graphite, we will
give a brief-summary of the manufacturing sequence. This will aid in
understanding the bulk behavior of the material and help to relate micro-
scopic to macroscopic aspects. Since we are interested in nuclear-grade,
or equivalent, graphites, the primary sources of information used are

Eatherly and Piper [1962] and Union Carbide Corporation [1964].

 

%
The term "turbostratic" was coined by Biscoe and Warren [1942] to
describe this unordered material.

 
13

As'élready mentioned, in most cases, artificial graphites are pro-
duced from petroleum-coke filler material, which is true of nuclear
graphites. The binder is coal-tar pitch. The petroleum coke is a by-
product in the refining of petroleum crude, and today it is largely ob-
tained by the cracking of a heavy refinery oil. When heated to a tem-
perature of 2800 to 3000°C, the carbon from petroleum coke achieves a
high degree of crystallinity (or-degree of graphitization), that is, the
crystalline properties (lattice dimensions) approach those of a perfect
erystal. A highly crystalline graphite has high thermal and electrical
conductivities and a large crystallite size.

The raw cokes from the refineries have textured, partially aligned
structures. The crystallites show no three-dimensional order, but the
lamellar order is sufficient to cause alignment of adjacent crystals to
varying degrees. The fixed carbon (the carbon remaining after heating
to 1000°C) in practically all of the petroleum cokes used ranges from
85 to 90%. The volatile content ranges from 7 to 16%, with a typical
value of 11%. Other constituents are ash and various impurities.

Ccal-tar pitch is the heavy residue derived from the distillation
of coal-tar from by-product coke ovens used in preparing metallurgical
coke. This coke is derived from the destructive distillation of bitumi-
nous coal, and it is the chief reducing agent employed by the steel in-
dustries in the blast-furnace reduction of iron ore. Coal-tar pitch is
an excellent material for graphite manufacture because it is solid at
room temperature and fluid at higher temperatures; in addition, it has a
high carbon content. The thermoplastic property alloﬁs for thorough mix-
ing of the filler with the binder, facilitates the forming of the filler-
binder mixtures, and permits storage and handling of the formed articles
at room temperature without adversely affecting the shape of the product.
The carbon content of coai-tar pitch is approximately 93%, and after
heating to 1000°C about 55% of the pitch remains as binder carbon. Be-
~cause of its high carbon content it has been described as a form of "lig-

1

~ uid carbon,"” which, through the addition of 7% alloying constituent, has
a softening point at 100°C.
The processing steps in the manufacture of a conventional, extruded,

nuclear graphite are summarized in Fig. 3. The raw petroleum ccke is

first calcined at temperatures up to 1400°C, usually in a large rotary
gas- or oil-fired kiln. The purpose is to remove volatile hydfocarbons
and to affect a shrinkage of the filler material before it is incorpo-
rated in the formed article. About 25% of the weight of the raw coke is |
lost during this process. During calcination the aligned structure of

the raw coke is preserved, but the layer planes of carbon atoms increase

 
15

in dimension over that present in the raw coke. The calcined petroleum
coke is, as yet, a turbostratic carbon.

After calcination, the material is broken down by crushers and mills
and sized, through screens, into a series of carefully controlled frac-
tions. The finest fraction, termed coke "flour," has a maximum particle
size of 0.015 in. for most electrode and specialty graphites, while the
coarsest fraction has particles as large as 0.5 in. Selected size frac-
tions are recombined to produce a dry aggregate wherein the proportion
of fractions and fraction size are varied, within limits, to control the
properties of the end product. The maximum particle size for a coarsé—
grained nuclear graphite is 1/32 in.

When the calcined coke is crushed or milled, the individual parti-
cles, although irregular in shape, tend to have one dimension longer than
the other two; - The shapes of the particles and the alignment of the
rudimentary crystallites in these particles depend on the éoke source,
that is, they depend on the refinefy practice and the charge stocks em-
ployed. However, the predominant orientation of crystallite layer planes
is paréllel to the longer particle dimension.

The next step in the manufacturing sequence is that of mixing the
dry coke aggregafe.with the coal-tar pitch to make a formable plastic
mix. The mix is heated to a temperature normally in the range from 165
to lTO°C, where the binder is quite fluid. This allows for a good dis-
tribution of the pitch in the petroleum-coke filler materials. In the
ideal situation, each coke particle is coated with a film of pitch. When
forming is done by extrusion, about 30 parts by weight of binder are
added to 100 parts of filler. The proportions may differ from these when
the product is to be molded. »

Furnace blacks or extremely fine (<10u) coke particles may be added
t0o the coke mixture to increase the bulk density of the artificial graph-
ite. These additives fill voids that would otherwise exist between the
large particles. Also, when extrusion is the forming method to be em-
ployed, the addition of lubricating oil to the mix is common practice.
The oil serves to reduce the friction between the surface of the die and

the mix. Thus, the quantity of pitbh otherwise necessary for reasonable
16

rates of extrusion is reduced, which is desirable because the evolution
of additional volatiles during the baking operation gives rise to a struc-
turally poor product w1th inferior properties.

As noted above, the coke-pitch le is formed either by extru51on or
by molding. In forming, the long axis of the coke particles take a pre-
Aferred oriéntation either in the direction of extrusion or perpendicular
to the direction of molding. The final graphite product retainé the same
pattern of .grain orientation. The with-the-grain direction is parallel
to the extruéion axis in extruded graphite and perpéndicular to the di-
rection of molding pressure in a molded piece. The against-the-grain di-
rection is perpendicular to this. Hence, there are marked differences
in properties between the two directions with.the anisotropy in molded
graphites being generally less than that found in extruded materials.

Mrozowski [1956] points out that the anisotropy of physical prop-
erties is due to two causes. One is the crystaliite alignment.in the
particles, as discussed above, and the other is purely geometrical in
nature. In the latter, the particle alignment creates an anisotropy due
to the relative frequency of binder-bridges per unit path in different
‘directions. The rélativé contributions of the two sources of anisotropy
depend on the type of physical property 1nvest1gated |

‘The artlcle, after forming, is called a "green'" carbon body and con-
sists of calcined petroleum-coke filler bonded by coal-tar pitch. This
.body.is then baked in a gas-fired furnace to convert the pitch from a
thermoplastic material to an infusible solid while at the same time main-
taining the shape imparted.by forming. This operation is critical‘and
must be carefully controlled. |

The green carbon loses its strength during the first part of the
cycle, and the volatiles in the pitch, which yield a sizeable volume of
gases, must escape through a relatively impermeable mass without disrupt-
ing the structure. Polymerizétibn and cross linking proceed within the |
binder and between binder and filler materials so that the platelets of
the pitch increase in size from their original’dimensions of a few ang-
.stroms. When the tempefature reaches 800 to 1000°C (the final baking
temperature), the cross-linking process causes the carbon to become ex-

tremely hard and brittle. At the same time, the binder shrinks about

 
17

5% by volume, creating high stresses that can crack the carbon body.
Mrozowski [1956] states that because of the calcining operation in which
the filler has been preshrunk, the only way in which the shrinking binder
surrounding a coke particle can decrease its volume is by way of bpening
crackslperpendicular to the particle surface. The entire baking cycle
may take from a few weeks to two months, depending on the furnace size
and the méthods used. |

The baked carbon has a porosity of about 25%. 1In drder to reduce
the porosity and thus increase the bulk density, an impregnation opera.-
tion in which coal-tar pitch is forced into the pores or voids in the
body is used. The ﬁmpregnating pitch differs somewhat from' the binder
.pitch in that some of the heavier fractions normally present in the binder
pitch are missing. The impregnation is performed by preheating the car-
bon to a temperature above 200°C, immérsing it in molten pitch, and pres-
surizing it in an autoclave to a pressure of the order of 100 psi for
several hours. |

The ultimate crystal orientation and size are inherent in the raw
materials, but, even after the gas—baking process, the carbon possesses
little true crystal structure. Both-long-range order and internal per-
fection,'aithough latent, are not yet developed. It i1s the purpose of
the last step in the manufacture of graphite stock to affect crystal |
growth and to ?erfect the internal order; that is, to convert carbon to
graphite. This is the graphitization procesé mentioned earlier, and re-
gquires a temperature in the 2600 to 3000°C range.

Upon heating the material during graphitization the dominant pfocess
between lSOO°C and about 2500°C is crystal growth with internal crystal
structure still imperfect. Above'2500°C, continued minor crystal growth
occurs, but the major éffects are diffusion and annealing. The stacks
of parallel planes are ordered according to the layered stacking of graph-
itic structure in this last stage of heating. The graphitization opera-
tion takes about two weeks. | |

Tests have shown that the properties of any piéce of graphite are.
directly dependent upon the highest temperature reached in graphitization.
However, very little chahge occurs in the room-temperature mechanical

properties on heating above 2500°C.
18

Although the theoretical density for a graphite crystal is 2.26 g/cm?,
a typical value of the bulk density for artificial graphite is 1.70 g/cm?
at room temperature. This is due to0 porosity between filler particles
and between crystallites within both the filler and binder carbon. New
methods in fabrication such as forming and baking a carbon article under
pressure and the use of a hot-working process, which produces a reorien-
" tation and recrystallization of the carbon, have led to graphites with
bulk densities in excess of 2.1 g/cm® (Eatherly and Piper [1962]). These
materials have higher tensile strength than the more conventional lower
density graphites.
| From the preceding discussion it is seen that the anisotropy associ-
ated with artificial graphite should have an axis of symmetry with prop-
erties in a plane normal to this axis being independent of direction,
that is, the material may be classified as transversely isotropic. The
axis of symmetry is in the direction of molding pressure (against—the—
grain) or in the direction of the extrusion axis (with-the-grain), de-
pending on the forming method used in the manufacture. This hypothesis
is supported by stress-strain measurements made by Kennedy [1961], who
examined the stress-strain behavior of an extruded graphite in the di-
rection parallel to the extrusion axis -and in two orthogonal directions
normal to this axis. The material exhibited deformatioﬁ resistance in-
dicative of rotational symmetry, but the data also show that the ultimate

strengths and elongations do not necessarily follow this pattern.

Mechanical Properties

 

Artificiallgraphites are brittle materials with low strengths at
ordinary tenmperatures in comparison with metals. ThéSe graphites have
large variations in properties, as might be inferred from the descrip-
tion of their manufacture. A piece of this material may be described as
a mixture of graphite and poorly graphitized binder carbon. The varia-
tions in properties stem not only from the raw materials used but also
fram the size and shape of the finished article. Differences are found
from piece to piece in a given lot and grade, with some variation in

properties within each piece. Indications of variations in density,

 
19
electrical resistivity, modulus of elasticity, and flexural strength to
be expected within formed pieces, molded and extruded, are given by
Wright [1956]. These data show that differences of 15 to 30% across the
diameter of a large piece may be expected. In general, both the modulus
and strength decrease with distance from the outer edge of a transverse
section. Despite these variations, which the manufacturers are striving
to reduce, definite characteristics are associated with the'prOPertieé
of graphite as a class of materials, and it is the purpose here to focus
attention upon these. The discussion will be limited to mechanical prop-
erties. The review articles and bocks already cited contain summaries

on electrical and physical properties.

Room-Temperature Properties

 

Typical room-temperature properties for a nucléar graphite are given
in Table 1. The values are for a fine-grained extruded pilece about
4L in. by 4 in. in cross section. TFrom this table, it may be seen that
the strengths and elasticlmodulus are greater in the with-the-grain (par-
allel) direction, which is generally true for artificial graphiteé as
| would be expected from the discussions on crystal structure and manu-
facture. Complete stress-strain diagrams for simple tension and compres-
sion are plotted together in Fig. 4. The material is a nuclear-grade
graphite and the data are for the'with-the-grain direction. As indicated
in Fig. L4, the stress-strain curves for graphite are nonlinear even at
low stress levels, and there are pronounced differences between both
stress and strain at fracture in tension and in compression. Typically,
fracture strains on the order of 0.1 to 0.2% and 1.0 to 2.0% are found
in tension and in compression, respectively.

Arragon and Berthier [1958] performed compression test studies on
216 specimens made from extruded, petroleum-coke, industrial graphite.v
Three types of test were used: (1) simple compression, (2) cyclic tests
(loading-unloading-reloading) in which the cycles were made from in-
creasing stress levels spaced at equal intervals, and (5) cyclic tests
between zero stress and a fixed maximum. The simple compression test
curves did not show any abrupt changes ih slope corresponding to the

incipience of plasticity. This lack of observable breaks in the curves

is in accordance with concomitant occurrence of both elastic, or revers-
ible, and plastic straining throughout the stress range. The slopes of
the stress-straiﬁ curves at the origins were of the same order of magni-
tude as given by sonic measurements. Seldin [1966a] alsoc found good
comparisons between sonic moduli and the slopes at zero stress as mea-
sured from tensile and compressive stress-strain curves for several -
grades of molded graphite. | |

Arragon and Berthier'demonstrated.that hysteresis loops are pro-
duced on unloéding and reloading. For illustration; a stress-strain dia-
gram for test type b is shown in Fig. 5. The curves are concave toward
the load axis on unloading and slight concavities toward this axis are
found on reloading. But, in first approximation, the reloading curves -
~are straight lines. A "compression limit" (~700 psi) was also reported.
Above this 1limit, there is residual permanent deformation upon unloading
which increases with unloading stress up to rupture. The authors report
. that below this limit, cyclic ldading curves reclose at the origih,
leaving no permanent deformation.

Tt is interesting to note that neither concavity toward the load
axis for reloading curves nor a limit corresponding to the'compression
limit.deséribed above have been reported by Andrew, Okada, and Wobschall
[1960], Losty and Orchard [1962], and Seldin [1966a]. The first authors

investigated hysteresis effects in bending and torsion, while the others .

performed cyclic loading tests in simple tension and compression. The
residual strains on unloading were observed to increase always with in-
creasing maximum stress. Jenkins [1962a] speculated that curious fea-
tures of the curves obtained by Arragon and Berthier may be explained by
end effects in the Specimens. _ .

Arragon and Berthier found that cyclic compressive tests of type b
cause the apparent density to increase. The hysteresis lobps increase
in size with increased maximum stress, and the slopes of straight lines
connecting the unloading and reloading points decrease with increased
stress. (The sldpe of a line connecting the two points of one cycle is
termed the "paraelastic modulus.") The envelope curve corresponds to
that for simple compression. | |

The results from tensile and compressive tests which were conducted
by Losty and Orchard [1962] and Seldin [1966a] corroborate these find-
ings concerning the hysteresis loops and the character of the envelope
curve. The studies made by these investigators will be discussed shortly.

In the case of test type ¢, each specimen was subjected to 12 cycles.
During the first cycles the total deformations at the unloading and re-
loading points increased with increased cycle number, but after the sixth
cycle these deformations were essentially constant. The form of the hys-
teresis loop remained constant as did the paraelastic modulus. There was

a slight increase in the apparent density during cycling.

 
23

Using a stress-strain diagram corresponding to test type b, Arragon
and Berthier discovered that straight lines drawn through the unloading
point and the point at zero stress for each cycle converge at a single
point. (Using the curves from compression tests given by Losty and
Orchard* and by Seldin, one finds additional support for this finding.)
The coordinates of this point are both negative (taking compressioﬁ as
positive), and it was reasoned that the existence of this point is a
manifestation of the history of the virgin specimen. ( During manufac-
ture, differential thermal expansion causes internal stresses that aré
probably quite high, as explained later.} The envelope stress-strain
curve was identified as a segment of a hyperbola with asymptotes paral-
lel to the stress and strain axes. ,

For the tests-of type b, conducted by Losty and Orchard, the speci-
mens were machined from extruded graphite stock material. The curves
obtained are all convex toward the stress axis on loading and concave
toward this axis on unloading. The relocading curves in both tension and
compression asymptotically approach the envelope stress-stfain curve
after each cycle of loading, unloading, and reloading in the same manner
as shown by Arragon and Berthier (see Figs. 6 and T7).T Seldin [1966b]
found from his tests on molded graphites [1966a] that, in general, the
reloading curve passed through the unloading point. At stresses greater
than those at unloading, the reloading curves were coincident with ex-
trapolations of the corresponding initial loading curves. Thus, in com-
parison, the point of tangency to the envelope curve 1is shifted more
toward.the stress axis for these molded graphites than for the extruded
graphites tested by the other investigators. '

Losty and-Orchard found the slopes of the curves at low stresses in

extruded graphites to be about the same in tension and compression, that:

 

* .
Additional discussion will be given shortly.

TThe slopes of the straight lines drawn through the hysteresis loops
in Fig. T correspond to the paraelastic moduli mentioned above. The '
slopes of the three shorter lines in the loop obtained after prestressing
to about 3000 psi and reloading indicate the paraelastic moduli corre-
sponding to the stresses of 700, 1500, and 2250 psi on reloading. By
extending the straight lines for the four loops, one finds that they es-
sentially converge at a single point.

is, Young's modulus was approximateiy_the same'for the two loadings.

This was true for both with-the-grain and against-the-grain directions.
These authors also measured lateral strains during testing. The strain
ratios reported are of the order of 0.10, and the ratio of strain in-
duced in the paraliel direction for a perpendiculér (against~the—grain)
speciﬁen is a little less than one-half that induced in the perpendiculér
direction for all stress levels. The strain ratios for compressive
specimens loaded both with-the-grain and against-the-grain were essen-
tially independent of stress.

Seldin [1966a] conducted a definitive study using eight different
grades of molded graphites and employing various uniaxial tests. These
include cyclic tests in tension and in compression and cycling between
given tensile and compressive stresses. In each case, lateral as well -
as longitudinal strains were measured. The transverse, or lateral,
stress-strain diagrams obtained have different shapes in tension and
compreséion; the diagrams for tension are concave tdward the stress
axis while those for campression are‘convex. The transverse-to-longi-
tudinal strain ratios are independent of stress, yielding constant vélues,
in compression. However, the ratioé in tension are functions of stress,
decreasing as the stress is increased. These results for compression are

in good agreement with those of Losty and Orchard. Greenstreet et al.

[1965] also found from tests on an extruded graphite that ‘the ratios in

compression are approximately constant, and the ratios tend to decrease
continually with increasing stress in tension.

Snyder [1966] also studied the stress-styain behaviors of molded
graphites. He used compression and flexure tests, and, in each case,"
the.program was that of loading to a given stress level, ﬁnloading, and

reloading to failure, giving a two-cycle test. He obtained elastic mod-

"uli, Poisson's ratios, and failure data; his elastic data for ATJI* (the

bon Products Division. It is similar to nuclear-grade graphites and is
often used as a "standard" in making property measurements and compari-
sons. '

graphite grade commoﬁ to both studies) are in good agreement with those
of Seldin [1966a]. |

The transverse, residual strain was positive for all graphites
studied by Seldin regardless of whether the load was a tensile or a com-
pressive one. This residual strain was slightly greater for a given
tensile stress than an equal and opposite compressive stress. Thus, the
volume of a specimen pulled in tension and released 1is increased since
all linear dimensions are increased. In addition; the longitudinal re-
sidual strain was greater in tension than compression.

These results were borne out by cyclic tests as well as tests where-
in the specimen was subjected to either simple tension or compression.
Cyclic tests between equal stresses in tension and compression produced
strains in the against-the-grain direction that increased slightly Wifh
each . cycle regardless of whether therlongitudinal axis of the specimen
was in the with-the-grain or against-the-grain direction. Thus, fatigue
failure is possibly associated with this slight increase in strain. The
occurrence of cumulative damage with repeated reversed loadings was dem-
onstrated by Dally and Hjelm [1965].

Seldin further shows that a test specimen can be made to reproduce
its original stress-strain responses in the longitudinal and transverse
directions by amnealing it at its graphitization temperature. Provided
it is generally true, this is a revolutionary discovery in graphite test-
ing, especially in the potential it provides for removing uncertainties
in data analyses and interpretations that arise because of the ineﬁitable
variations in graphite properties.

- In first approximation, the stress-strain curves are identical in
tension and compression. Exceptions to this may be found by comparing‘
the against-the-grain data for some graphites. Seldin found through
close inspection of the results from his tests that in each case there
is a tendency toward gréater deformation reéistance in compression than
in tension.

It is often stated that prestressing a graphite specimen in compres-
sion reduces the elastic modulus, E, in tension, and, likewise, pre-
stressing in tension reduces the modulus in campression. ©See Losty and

Orchard [1962] and Seldin [1966a], for example. TIn the case of these

 
27

writers, the modulus referred to is found from the stress-strain dia-
gram, and the changes observed may be explained, in part, as foliows.
In view of the demonstrated nonlinearity of the diagram, the slope of
the curve obviously depends upon the position along the curve. Considef
the schematic stress-strain diagram in Fig. 8 which corresponds to pre-
stressing a specimen in tension to the point A, unloading to pcint B,
and loading in compression. The slope at point O is fhe same as that
at the instant of unloading from A and represents the elastic modulus.
Now, the curve from A to B is an unloading curve, and the segment from
B to C is clearly a continuation of this nonlinear curve. Therefore,
strictly speaking, the only slope along the unloading curve which can
be expected to have meaning in terms of an elastic modulus is that at
the unloading point, A, and not the one at B. Comparisons for deter-
mining changes in modulus due to prestreséing are probably best made by
using dynamic modﬁlus measurements at low strain amplitudes.

In regard to dynamic moduli, Jenkins [1962b] has shown through res-
onant frequency measurements that prestressing in compression does de-
crease the apparent elastic modulus. This investigation was concelved
as a result of his fracture studies in which he observed isclated crack-

ing at stresses below those required for major fractures. He feasoned

that beéause of such isolated cracking the bulk physical and mechanical
-properties of the material should change. In particular, the dynamic ‘
modulus of elasticity for very low strains should change.

To test this hypothesis, dynamic modulus measurements were made on
extruded nuclear graphite specimens after prestressing in compression to
progressively higher levels. It is reported that the best fit to the

data up to fracture is given by

£ = expl-¥0/(0_ ~ o)1 , (1)

where
EO = agpparent modulus at zero stress,
E = apparent modulus after prestressing to a given stress,
k = nondimensional constant,
o = stress,
o_ = a critical stress.

c
The data do not exhibit any significant directional dependence for the

directions normal and parallel to the extrusion axis.

From the data given, E/EO'E 0.70 near fracture, and the fracture
strengths ranged from ~3700 to ~L4LT700 psi. It is reported that k was
found to have a constant value of about 0.08, and g, varied from 4500
to 5000 psi. .

Because of the nature of graphite, that is, the material consists
of discrete filler particles embedded in the graphitized binder which
forms a more or less continuous matrix with random structure, relation-
ships between specimen size and mechanical properties appear likely.
Thus, strength versus specimen diameter studies have been made. -Losty
and Orchard [1962] investigated specimené ranging in diameter from 0.282
to 0.798 in. Their material was extruded nuclear-grade graphite, and
both directions with respect.to-the extrusion axis were examined. The
strengths were independent of diameter for the three larger sizes with
those for the smaller diameter being Jjust significantly lower. In a
similar study using flexural specimens ranging in cross section from a
square, 1/4 in. on a side, to a 3/L4 in. squaré, no significant effect

of specimen size on flexural strength was found.

 
29

Digesu and Pears [1965] used ATJ graphite specimens of four dif-
ferent diameters ranging from 0.063 to 1.0 in. The ultimate tensile
strengths for the three smaller sizes were about the same, but the
strength fbr the 1.0-in.-diam specimen was about ll% less. These in-
vestigators also found small decreases in strength for a given speéimen
with increase in strain rate and with increase in surface réughness}
Greenstreet et al. [1965] found that for specimen diameters ranging from
0.128 to 0.750 in. size effects in terms of fracture stresg and strain‘
and elastic modulus were small or nonexistent. The maximum pérticler
size for their material was 1/32 in.

Flexural fests are commonly used for control purposes in manufac- |
ture {Currie, Hamister, and MacPherson [1956]) . Two types are employed.
The most widely used 1s that of applying the locad at the center of the
beam supported near its ends. The second is that of applying the load
at two points so a greatef length of beam is under maximum stress. This
is the recommended test (Currie et al.) and is designated as the "third-
point loading" testrby ASTM [1964]. 1In either case, thé.strengths are
calculated using simple beam theory based on linear elasticity. Accord-
ing to the above authors, the second test gives strength values 20 to
35% lower than the single-point loading test. In addition, they report
the ratio of tensile strength to flexural strength from single-point
loading as about 0.53% with a range of 0.47 to 0.68.

Through tests and data analysis in which nonlinear behavior as well
as differences in stress-strain properties in tension and compression
were accounted for in bend specimens, Greenstreet et al. [1965] made
comparisons of bend and uniaxial test results. As expected, the results
from bend tests were shown to agree with those from uniaxial tests in
regard to stress-strain diagrams and to fracture stress and strain.

'Andrew, Okada, and Woschall [1960] observed creep in end-loaded
graphité cantilever beams at room temperature. The creep strain had a
logarithmic time dependence indicating the absence of viscous creep,
and, over the range of time observed (~1200 min), the creep deformation
was small in comparison to the total. Kennedy [1961] conducted uniaxial
creep tests on nuclear-grade graphite specimens at temperatures of 78,

750, and 1100°F. At each temperature, there was slight initial creep

f
30

which saturated in a few hours and no creep occurred after that for to-
tal time durations up to 2000 hours. Similar results were found using

flexural tests. However, using more sensitive measuring techniques,
.Kennedy [1963] later found that low level creep does persist over time

intervals of 2000 hours.

Kennedy [1960, 1961] also examined the influence of rate of loading
on tensile specimens at temperatures of 78, 750, and 1100°F. He used
short-time and incremental loading tests in which the loading rates were
approximately 600,000 psi/hr and 2 psi/hr, respectively. There appeared
to be no significant differences between the stress-strain curves from
the short-time tests at 78°F and those from incremental ldading tests at
78 and T750°F. 1In addition, the results indicated that the fracture

stresses and strains are essentially time and temperature independent.

Derived Stress-Strain Relationships

 

Starting from microstructural considerations and relating micro-
structural aspécts to bulk material behavior, Jenkins [1962a] deduced a
méchanical analogy for use in predicting stress-strain behavior in ten-
sion and compression; This mechanical analog is a series of equal fric-
tion blocks connected by springs with equal stiffnesses. On the basis

of this model, initial loading is described by
e = Ao + Bo® » (2)

where

total strain,

1/E = elastic compliance,

W = Q
1l

a material constant which characterizes the plastic
deformation.

Thus, the first term on the right of Eq. (2) represents the elastic
strain, and the second gives the plastic strain. The equation for un-
loading from a maximum stress, Gm, is

e —e=Alo -0 + 280 ~0)?, (5

 
31

where € is the strain at S Finally,* for relocading from G with

g = Gm, the equation is

c—¢c =Mo-0) +3Blo-0)% . ()

Calculated results were compared with loading-unloading-reloading
‘curves in compression, and the relationships wefe found to hold for
stresses to 1200 psi. The calculated results were found to duplicate
the envelope curve, the residual strain on unloading, and the hysteresis
loops to a good degree of accuracy within the range of\applicability
established. ' | |

Other stress-strain relationships were derived by Hesketh [196L4]
and by Woolley [1965]. The equation due to Hesketh is

o gs(-ggy), (5

where E is the elastic modulus for a single crystal and ey is the yield

strain for a éingle crystal. In inverted form, the expression is

In this form it is evident that the equation of Jenkins, Egq. (2), corre-

sponds to the first two terms.
Woolley based his derivation on a model for dislocation movement
and reasoned that‘subgrains become plastic progressively. His relation-

ship is exponential in form and is given by

 

*In his paper, Jenkins took the specific case o, = O. In the paper
of Jenkins and Williamson [1963], illustrations of stress-strain curves
deduced from the model are given for stresses both in tension and com-
pression. '
32

| —¢/ |
o = Ee (1 — e eo) . | (7

where E is the elastic modulus of bulk material and €5 is a constant.
This equatibn, with appropriately determined eohstants, was shown to fit
all points of both tensile and compressive curves for a nuclear-grade
graphite. ' _ :

Because all three equations, Egs. (2), (5), and (7), give good fits
to stress-strain data at low strains, Jenkins [1965] compared them on
the basis of slope, dc/de, versus stress. Equation (2) gives a curve
convex toward the origin which agrees well witﬁ the experimental data
up to a compressive stress of 2000 psi. On the other hand, the equation
of Hesketh gives a cufve éoncave toward the origin, while that of
Woolley gives a'straight line, neither of which fit the data.

Seldin [1966a] examined the model of Jenkins by comparing-predicted
and experimental results for several molded graphites. The lower and
intermediate stress level data were used, and the conc¢lusions are as
follows. Equation (2) usually gives a good fit to the entire tensile
stress-strain curve and to fhe compressive curve up to approximately 60%
of the breaking strength. Equations (2) and (3) predict a residual
strain of %-Boi for loading to the stress, Gm’ followed by unloading to
zero stress. The experimental results show that for tensile tests these
strains are proportional to 02, but théy are greater than predicted. In
compression; they are proportional to Gn, where n ranges from 1.6 to
1.9, and they are less than predicted. The shapes of the stress-strain
curves and widths of the hysteresis loops on release and reapplication

of stress as given by the model agree well with observations.

 

Temperature Effects -

Pioneering work regarding the influence of témperature upon mechan-
‘ical properties was done by'Malﬁstrom, Keen, and Green [1951], who sys-
tematically studied changes in short-time tensile strength and elastic
modulus. They also studied tensile creep behavior at temperatures in
the approximate range of 2100 to 2900°C. Subsequently, the temperature
dependence of strength has been investigated by Green [1953%], by Wagner,

 
33

Driesner, and Kmetko [1958], by Martens, Jaffe, and Jepson [1959], by
Lund and Bortz [1960], by Martens, Button, Fischbach, and Jaffe [19603,
by Digesu and Pears [1963], and by Smith [196ka]. In these tests, com-
mercial as well as laboratory-made graphites were used. The résults for
the various types are somewhat different, but there are general trends
as follows:

1. The short-time strength increases from room temperature tb ap-
proximatély 2500°C where the value may range to twice that at room tem-
perature. Above this tempéfature the strength decreases rapidly.

| 2. The strength increases with bulk density.

3. The elongatioﬁ at fracture is small at room temperature (on the
order of 0.1 to 0.2%) and remains so up to about 2000°C, above which it
begins to increasé with a large-increase ocecurring between 2500 and
2750°C. Elongations at rup£ure up to about 4LO% at the higher teﬁpera-
ture were reported by Martens et al. [1960], although the values are
usually much less than this. | |

4. The ductility decreases with increasé in strain rate.

5. Graphites are stronger and less ductile when 1baded in tension
" in the with-the-grain direction than when loaded in the against-the-
grain direction. |
| 6. The denéity decreases during tensile testing and increases
during comﬁresSion testing. | ' |

'Aé an illustration of strain-rate effects, we will summarize the
work of Smith [1964a], who made a careful investigation of these effects
in terms of tensile strength and rupture elongation on a molded, nuc-
lear-grade graphite.‘ The elongations measured by Smith are low in com-
parison to values.for other graphites. His tests were made iﬁ'a helium
vatmosphere and in vacuum at strain rates of 0.005, 0.5, and 2.0 (min) 7%,
The influence of ameSphere was small, so this factor will be ignored
in summarizing the results. At the lowest strain rate, the strength
increased by a factor of almost three between room temperature and |
2500°C. The intermediate stréin'rate gave results which differed signi-
‘ficahtly from those at 0.005 (min)~' only at temperatures above 2000°C,
where the slope of the strength versus temperature curve was reduced.

At 2.0 (min)'l,'the increase in strength over the range from room
34

temperatufe to 2500°C was about 50%. The elongations at rupture were
independent of stirain fate up to about 2200°C. There was a distinct in-
crease in elongation at 2500°C (1% elongation at 2500°C) at the lower
strain rate, but the elongation remained at the 0.1 to 0.2% level for
the higher rates.

Dynamic elastic modulus measurements (using vibrating beams) were
made by Malmstrom, Keen, and Green [1951], by Faris, Green, ahd Smith
[1952], by Davidson, Losty, and Ross [1958], and by Lund and Bortz
[1960]. Moduli were obtained from the low stress portions of stress-
strain curves by Digesu and Pears [1965].- These studies also covered
a range of graphite grades. . Although differences exist between various
graphites and betﬁeen dynamic values and those obtained from stress-
strain curves, there is again general agreement between the results.

The overall trend is an increase with increasing temperature to about
2000°C followed by a decrease. As an example, Faris et al. [1952] found
an increase over the-rénge from 25 to 2000°C of about 50% in the with-
'the-grain direction and about.90% in the against-the-grain direction for
one grade of extruded material. -The moduli also increase with increase
in density.

Mrozowski [1956] pointed out that "frozen-in" stresses are respon-
sible for changes in short-time strength with temperature. These
stresses arise from the highly anisotropic nature of the graphite crys-
tal for which he took thermal exXpansion cbefficients of 1 x 107® and
S35 X 107® (°¢c) L as average values over the range from O to 2500°C in
the direction of the basal plane and perpendicular to this direction,
respectively. This anisotropy leads to differential shrinkages as graph-
ite cools from thé graphitization to room temperature. He reasoned that
on cooling from the graphitization temperature to 2300-2500°C the
stresses induced are relieved by creep, and he did not expect any appre-
ciable plasticity below 2000°C. (These views are supported by tests
conducted by Smith [196Lb]). Thus, large stresses build up on cooling
Ato room temperature. The increase in short-time strength with tempera-
ture according to this hypothesis is then due to the gradual release of
"frozen-in" stresses on reheating. The drop in strength above 2500°C

is due to the onset of rapid creep.

 
35

A commbn'explanation for the increase in elastic modulus with tem-
perature is expansion of the crystallites into voids between them and a
consequent tighténing of the structure. However, Davidson and Losty
[1958a] suggest. instead that an increase in crystal shear fesistance

with increased temperature is the important factor. .

Creep

The creep of graphite in flexure and torsion was studied by David-
son and Losty [1958a, 1958b]. Measurements were made over the tempera-
ture range 1000 to 2000°C. The typical behafior was an initial defor-
mation followed by a slow, time-dependent éreep.deformation and over

the range 1200 to 2000°C was best described by an equation of the form

A, =A+k4nt+Bt, (8)
where
At = total deformation at time t,
A = initial deformation,
B,k = temperature and stress-dependent parameters.

Thus, both transient and steady creep are exhibited in this range. The
parameters B and k were found to be linear functions of stress. When
the load is removed, the transient component of the creep is recovered
according to ' |

\At =mddn t . ' (9)

Short-time tensile creep was measured in the range 2000 to 3000°C
on a number of different commercial graphites by Malmstrom, Keén, and
Green [1951] (as mentioned above), by Wagner; Driesner, and Kmetko
[1958], by Martens, Button, Fischbach, and Jaffe [1960], and by Seldin
[1964]. Wagner et al. also studied compressive creep; creep in flexure
was measﬁred by Seldin and Draper [1961] and by Seldin [1962]. There
is not general agreement on the form of the expression for describing
the transient creep. The "steady, or secondary, creep rate depends on
Gn, whefe values of n ranging from ~2 to ~4 have been reported. The

difference ih,reported values may be attributable to differences in
36

materials. The exponent appears to be independent of direction with re- .
spect. to grain crientation.

For a given stress, the sﬁeady creep rate increases with increased
temperature, and there does not appear to be a minimum corresponding to
the peak in short-fime strength. 1In concert with the general tendency
- for greater short-time strength in the with-the-grain direction, the
resistance to creep is greater in this direction than against-the-grain.
Recovery occurs when the load is remcved, but it amouhts to only a frac-
tion of the transient creep deformation. | |

The creep tests were mainly of fixed-time duration, with the lon-
gest time being about 2 hours. Thus, rupture-elongation data usually
were not obtained. For those specimens which did fracture, maximum rup-
ture elongations of roughly 20 to 50% at the higher temperatufes were
observed. Wagner et al. found two types of behavior in compression. In
the first, failure occurs during the secondary creep stage, as is the
case in tensile creep tests, while in the second there is accelerated

creep followed by fracture.

Combined Stress Behavior

 

Although a great deal of information is available concerning uni-
axial behavior, the literature contains very iittle concerning_combined
" stresses. Theoretical analyses haVe been made treating the material as
linearly elastic but taking transverse isotropy into account. Two such
analyses are given by Weng [1965) and by Witt and Greenstreet [1966].

Ely [1965] tested tubular specimens of graphite under combined in-
ternal pressure and axial loads. The specimens were machined from two
grades of extruded tube stock to give uniform gage sections 3 1/2-in.
leng, 1.0 in. in inside diameter, and 0.060 in. in wall thickhess.‘ Only
strengths are reported; these correspond to ten biaxial stress condi-
tions. |

The biaxial fracture stresses were best correlated by a combination
of failure theories. In the tension-tension quadrant for the two-dimen-
sional stress space, failure appears to be governed by the maximum nor-
mal stress, while in the hoop-tension, axial-compréssion quadrant the

- results seem to correlate with an expression due to Stassi-D'Alia [1959].
