ABSTRACT

The discovery of a process that uses liquid bismuth at 500 to 700°C to remove protactinium and
fission products from the molten salt fuel of a breeder reactor led to a search for suitable containment
materials. Although several other refractory metals or graphite may be suitable, molybdenum appears
most promising. Therefore low-carbon, low-oxygen molybdenum prepared by arc casting was chosen
as the structural material for a reductive-extraction test stand that would be representative of typical
equipment. We recognized that the use of molybdenum as a structural material would require
unorthodox assembly procedures and impose stringent limitations on the system design. However, this
material apparently possesses the bést combination of properties such as fabricability, and oxidation
and corrosion resistance. Final design was determined after the development of appropriate fabrication
and joining techniques. - ‘

Procedures were developed for the productlon of closed-end moiybdenum half sections by back
extrusion. Parts that were generally free from cracks and had high-quality surfaces were produced by
the use of ZrOp-coated plungers and dies and extrusion blank preheat temperatures of 1600 to
1700°C. In cooperation with a commercial vendor, we found that molybdenum tubing with improved
ductility could be produced by careful removal of contamination introduced. during tubing
fabrication. ‘

" Complex components were fabricated by welding, using either the gas tungsten-arc or

electron-beam process. Welding studies centered on three major types of joint: tube-to-tube, tube-to
header, and header-to-header. Two of the most important factors found to minimize weld hot cracking
were stress relieving and preheating of components prior to welding. Mechanical bonding techniques
were developed to join small-diameter tubing to back-extruded end sections. Experiments carried out
at 250°C in an argon atmosphere produced helium leak-tight joints. Brazing filler metals were
developed that are reasonably corrosion resistant to bismuth and molten salt up to 700°C. Techniques
involving induction or resistance heating were developed to braze the several types of joints used in the
test stand.
- The Molten-Salt Reactor Program was terminated before construction of the test stand was
completed, but an unjoined mockup using molybdenum components was assembled, and detailed
assembly procedures were worked out. All of the techniques required for final assembly were
demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION

A key feature in the conceptual design of the single-fluid molten-salt breeder reactor is the connecting
chemical processing plant to continuously remove protactinium and fission products from the fuel salt (Fig.
1). Protactinium, the intermediate element in the breeding chain between thorium and 232U, has a

significant neutron capture cross section and must be kept out of the core to obtain a good breeding ratio.

Rare-earth fission products are also neutron poisons and must likewise be removed for good breeding. In

1968 the chemical feasibility of a process thzit uses liquid bismuth containing dissolved lithium and thorium

as reductants to extract protactinium and rare earths from fuel salt containing both uranium and thorium
was demonstrated.? A simplified flowsheet based on this process is shown in Fig. 2.

One of the requirements for the development of the reductive-extraction process is identifying materials
that are compatible with both molten fluoride salts and bismuth containing reductants. Hastelloy N

(Ni—7% Cr—16% Mo—5% Fe) is a likely material of construction for the reactor because it has excellent
compatibility with molten salts at 500 to 700°C. However, nickel has appreciable solubility in bismuth at
these temperatures and, therefore, is unsuitable for those portions of a processing plant that have to contain
liquid bismuth. Other commonly used construction materials such as iron- or cobalt-base alloys have lower

~ solubilities in bismuth but rapidly mass-transfer under conditions involving a temperature gradient. Several

refractory metals (tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium)?2:3 and graphite* appear promising, but each
has limitations with respect to either fabricability, oxidation resistance, or compatibility with bismuth and
salt. | '

When it was proposed to bu1ld a reductive-extraction column that would be representative of typical
equipment and in which distribution coefficients for various elements could be checked and engineering
performance data determined, molybdenum was chosen as the material of construction. We felt that it
possessed the best combination of properties required for the processing application, namely, corrosion and
oxidation resistance, availability, and fabricability. However, no system this complex had ever been
constructed of molybdenum, and we foresaw many difficult fabrication problems that would have to be
solved.

Molybdenum is a particularly structure-sensitive material; that is, its mechanical properties are known
to vary widely, depending upon how it has been metallurgitally processed. The ductile-brittle transition
temperature of molybdenum varies from below room temperature to 200—300°C, depending both up‘on
strain rate and the microstructure of the metal. Maximum ductility is provided in the stress-relieved
fine-grained condition, and recrystallization and grain growth are known to reduce fracture stress and
ductility. Interstitial impurities such as dxygén and carbon often segregate at grain boundaries, and this can
result in a decrease in grain-boundary mobility which also favors premature fracture and low ductility.’
However, recent advances in vacuum-melting practices have led to the production of material with
improved and more reproducible metallurgical properties. The arc-melted low-carbon, low-oxygen grade of
molybdenum, available commercially, affords relatively good control of grain size and interstitial impurity
level. Nevertheless, the use of molybdenum as a structural material requires highly unorthodox assembly
procedures and imposes stringent limitations on system design from the standpoint of geometry and
rigidity.

DESIGN OF TEST STAND

The principal molybdenum components of the test stand are the column, disengaging pots, bismuth and
salt feed pots, and connectirig piping (Fig. 3). The column consists of a 1%-in.-OD Raschig-ring-packed
central column for contacting countercurrent streams of bismuth-lithium and molten fluoride salt. Enlarged
end sections (3%-in.-OD pots) are provided for deentrainment and separation of the exit stream from the
entering stream. The fluids flow countercurrently through the column because of their difference in
density, and they are returned to their respective feed pots by an argon gas-lift system. Flow rates of the
fluids are controlled by orifices located in the bottom of the 37/8 -in.-OD feed pots (Fig. 4). The orifices are
removable, and different sizes may be used to allow a range of flow rates compatible with the limited head
available in the feed pots. The feed pots contain internal baffles and Raschig rings (Fig. 4) to deentrain

stand have been reported elsewhere.%:7
One major problem in the fabrication of complex molybdenum equipment is its lack of ductility after

recrystallization. For optimum fabricability, it should be subjected to at least a 50% reduction in area after

recrystallization and then given a stress-relief treatment. Although we felt that the 3%-in.-OD pots could be
produced by machining from bar stock, material in this size range would have poor as-machined properties

because it would have received only a limited amount of working. The capacity of available metal-working

equipment was limited to using starting or blank material only slightly larger than the required finished
pots. We chose instead to fabricate these components by back extrusion, a proce'ss in which a cylinder with
a closed end can be produced by hot working in the range 1200 to 1700°C.

Although molybdenum can be welded, the process generally results in very large grains in both the

fusion and heat-affected zones. Molybdenum welds are very brittle at room temperature and have a

tendency to hot-crack. We thought that our best chances for successfully welding molybdenum would be

with the electron-beam prOces_s, which minirnize_s' contamination effects, heat-affected-zone problems, and
abnormal grain growth. However, electron-beam welding is not applicable for joining lengths of tubing
together or for joining the tubing to a pot where the tube passes completely thfough the end section. A
technique using the gas tungsten-arc welding process with an orbiting electrode was developed to make the
tube-to-tube -butt welds, and a mechanical joining technique (roll bonding) was developed to make the
latter joints. In addition, reinforcement of all welded or roll-bonded joints by brazing served to strengthen
the joint as well as to add a barrier to fluid leakage if a crack developed. To utilize brazing, however,
required the develoPment of a filler metal that would both be corrosion resistant to bismuth and salt and
have a melting temperature below 1200°C, the maximum temperature that we felt could be tolerated
before the molybdenum would become overly embrlttled as a result of recrystalllzatlon and gram growth

 The development work undertaken was concomitant with design of the test ‘stand, and there was a
definite interrelation between the two functions. The final loop design represented a compromlse between
engineering requirements and progress made in the development of fabrication and joining procedures for
molybdenum.

 
 

 

FABRICATION DEVELOPMENT

- Primary Fabrication of Molybdenum Components
R. E. McDonald

The choice of molybdenum as the construction material for the test stand presented several fabrication
problems. It was originally suggested that the pots and the large-diameter heavy-wall tubing be machined
from bar stock. However, our experience was that bar stock more than 1% to 2 in. in diameter had poor
mechanical properties. Most available mechanical properties data comes from thin sheet or small-diameter
rod which has been heavily worked, and we felt that an end cap machined from 4-in.-diam bar would be
weak and crack-prone.

Fabrication development started before the test-stand design was completed One method considered in
making the pots was by forging heavy plate to form end caps and then welding them to heavy-wall extruded
pipe. We had previously developed techhiques to fabricate heavy-wall timgsten pipe, and 4-in.-diam by %
in. wall by S0-in.-long sections had been made.8 Molybdenum pipe could readily be produced using the
same techniques. The forged end caps would then be welded or brazed to the large pipe body, producing
the pot, and pots made by this technique would have good mechanical properties because of the mechanical
working necessary to shape them. Available equipment aided us in the choice of back extrusion for
producing the end caps and forward extrusion for producing heavy-wall tubing, The Metals and Ceramics
Division at ORNL has available a horizontal extrusion press with an extensive tooling inventory. Three-, 4-,
5.6-, and 7-in.-diam containers ‘with stems were on hand. The water-nitrogen accumulator system was
capable of 1300 tons on the 4-in. stem, and an induction billet heater, 50 kW at 3000 cycles, was capable of
heating 4-in.-diam, 10-in.-long billets to 2200°C in 45 min. '

The first attempt to produce an end cap by back extrusion’ was made using a 4-1n -ID container with a
Zr0,-coated split die having provisions for integral bosses, a solid die backer, and a 3- in.-diam stem with a
3-in.-diam Zr0,-coated tool-steel plunger attached. This is shown schematically in Fig. 5. A 3.950-in.-diam
molybdenum blank was heated to 1300°C in the induction heater under an argon atmosphere, transferred
to the container, and quickly pushed with the plunger. The blank neatly filled the die and flowed back over
the coated plunger, producing a 4-in.-OD product. The tooling was conventionally cleared from the
container, the die parted, and the plunger extracted. Several back extrusions were made to determine the
optimum temperature, boss configuration, and skirt lengths. Back extrusions were successfully made at
1200, 1300, 1400, and 1500°C, and the maximum skirt length we obtained was 4 in. at 1500°C.

During this phase of development, however, cracks were noted in the hemispherical portion and the
skirt ends. Although it was first suspected that they occurred 'dufing back extrusion, we noted that fine
cracks had been generated on the faces of the blank during machmmg, and we felt they could have been
transferred to the product.

In an effort to understand and eliminate this cracking problem, a blank was cut lengthwise into two
sections, and a '%-in. square grid network of grooves was machined into each half. The grid of one half was
filled with small-diameter tantalum wires, and the two halves were pinned together. The blank was heated
to 1650°C and back-extruded. The halves of the extrusion were easily parted, and Fig. 6 shows the flow
pattern of the molybdenum during extrusion. The flow pattern shows that the cylindrical extrusion blank
was first pushed forward, filling the die cavities to form the bosses. After it bottomed out against the solid
die backer, it flowed backward over the coated plunger to form the skirt. As the free surface of the skirt
flows backward between the plunger and the die body, it is essentially undeformed. Therefore, if fine

cracks exist on the back edge of the starting blank, then cracks in the skirt edge will occur. To minimize
this type of cracking, the back edge of the starting blank was radiused and highly polished. At this point,
our machining procedure was modified to require that all blanks be chemically etched and dye-penetrant-
inspected after machining. Molybdenum, like tungsten, has a tendency of smearing over cracks during
machining or grinding, and unless etched, it is difficult if not impossible to detect fine cracks. If cracks were
detected, very fine grinding removed them prior to acceptance. This change in procedure noticeably
reduced cracking in the back-extruded product

While demonstrating that end caps could be made reliably, we noted that fairly long lengths of skirt
were extruded back over the plunger.lWe then decided it would be feasible to back-extrude two halves to
make a pot. This approach would require one girth weld instead of the two required to attach the end caps
to an intermediate section of pipe, and it would also eliminate the need to extrude 3%-in.-OD, %-in.-wall
pipe. :
~ In order to back-extrude the end cap with a long cylindrical section, we thought that it would be
necessary either to do it in several steps or to raise the preheat temperature of the blank. However, this led
to further complications. We found that the ZrO, coating on the plunger stayed intact for only one or two
pushes before it had to be recoated because the inner surface of the product was adversely affected. Also,
the increase in the preheat temperature to 1650°C caused galling and tearing of the outer surface of the
extrusion because of a reaction of the molybdenum with the steel container liner (Fig. 6). The lubricant
used by ORNL for all extrusions of molybdenum, molybdenum alloys, tungsten, and tungsten alloys is
what we term a base-metal oxide lubricant. At the hot working temperature of these metals and alloys a
liquid oxide forms which is an excellent lubricant (covered by USAEC patent 3,350,907). However, the
residence time of the back extrusion in the container is long when compared with that of a conventional

* forward extrusion, and the liquid oxide breaks down as a lubricant as the temperature of the steel

approaches its melting point. We had observed that the surfaces of the extrusion that were insulated from
the steel by the plasma-sprayed ZrO, were not tearing (Fig. 6); therefore the tooling was changed so that

- molybdenum was in contact only with ZrO,-coated surfaces during extrusion. To do this the 5.6-in.-ID

container was used, in which a 5.6-in.-OD, 4-in.-ID, 9-in.-long split die was inserted. The entire inner surface
of the split die was plasma-sprayed with ZrO:.'At this point, the end design of the pot was also changed
from a multiple-bossed hemispherical head to a large single-boss flat head as shown in Fig. 7. Three
8-in.-long back extrusions were made at preheat temperatures of 1600 to 1700°C with a stem load of up to

- 800 tons. When the length requirement of the half sections for the lower disengaging pot was increased to

9% in., 2 new 12-in.-long die was made. Three long blanks were then back-extruded at 1600 to 1700°C
with stem loads up to 800 tons. These extrusions exhibited good outer and inner surfaces, and skirt
cracking did not exceed an inch in length. A typical back extrusion after machining is shown in Fig. 8.

We thus showed that by using existing equipment — the horizontal extrusion press — half sections for

. the bismuth, salt, and the upper and lower disengaging pots could be made by back extrusion. A total of 12

back extrusions were produced for use in constructmg the molybdenum test stand and data concerning
these products are summarized in Table 1. :

The second problem, the production of the large-diameter heavy-wall tubing for the packed column,
was solved using techniques developed under the High Temperature Materials and Tungsten Programs at
ORNL. About 6 ft of 1.16-in.-OD, 0.080-in.-wall tubing was required. For this, we used a 4-in.-OD,
l-in-ID, 7-in-long billet, which was heated to 1600°C and extruded over a ZrQ,-coated mandrel at a
reduction ratio of 29:1. A second extrusion produced a tube 11% ft in length that was concentric within
0.007 in. tolerance in radius and with excellent outer and inner surfaces. The process used was the ORNL

molybdenum oxide.

Even though a scale-up of the test stand would be required in construction of an actual chemical
processing facility, we feel that we have demonstrated primary fabrication techniques for molybdenum that

would be applicable to containers up to 12 in. in diameter and 36 in. long. Fabrication of larger-sized
components would require the adaptation of other fabrication techniques, such as ring rolling or power
spinning, or the development of new techniques.

Tubing Development

Four sizes of molybdenum tubing were required, and these were obtained commercially, as listed m
Table 2. All of the material was purchased according to the following specifications:

Initial investigation of three heats of this tubing revealed differences in mjcrostructure, hardness, and
response to heat treatment, but little difference in interstitial concentration (Table 3). Inspection of the
inside of the tubes revealed surfaces which were rough or pitted. Metallographic examination of the
as-received ¥%-in.-OD tubing showed it was partially recrystallized. Heating to 925°C for 1 hr resulted in
complete recrystallization. However, both the Y-in.- and 1,-in.-OD tubing were received in a cold-worked
condition. Heat treating to 925°C did not alter the hardness or microstructure of the %-in. tubing, but the
!%-in. tubing softened and was almost completely recrystallized. Since the interstitial element concentra-
tions in the different heats were essentially the same, we can assume that the surprisingly low

recrystallization temperatures for the %-in.- and %-in.-OD tubing were the result of working prior to
heat treating. ‘ o ) o

To evaluate the ductility of the tubing, we devised a somewhat qualitative test in which a 0.5-in.-long
sample was impact-flattened a predetermined amount at different temperatures using the equipment shown
in Fig. 9. The load was applied by a 2300-g weight dropped a distance of 6 cm. To obtain a quantitative
measure of deformation, we divided the displacement (original fing diameter minus the minor axis diameter
of the tested specimen) by the original diameter of the ring. The results of some of these tests are given in
Table 4. The as-received %-in.-OD tubing was “ductile” (no cracks) at room temperature, while we had to
heat samples of the ¥%-in.-OD tubing to 150—250°C and the ¥%-in.-OD tubing to 300°C before they became
ductile. - | .
The behavior of the Y-in.-OD tubing was traced to a brittle layer on its inside surface, as indicated in
Table 5. Removal of 0.004 in. from the inside diameter (0.002 in. from the wall thickness) resulted in
lowering the temperature at which acceptable ductility was observed from 300 to 125°C; when 0.006 in.

irdicated that material from near the inside surface contained higher oxygen and carbon concentrations
cr)mpared with the bulk sample analyses (140 and 120 ppm, respectively, compared with 69 and 80 ppm).
We suspectéd that contamination of the tubing océurred during fabrication and that it was not removed
during subsequent cleaning or heat treating operations. | | | | |

Removing material from the inside of the %-in. 0D tubmg also 1mproved its room—temperature
ductility, but its as-received microstructure (partially recrystalhzed as compared with the cold-worked
fine-grained %-in.-OD tubmg) led us to believe that the fabrication schedule used in its production mlght
also be responsible for its lack of ductrhty Consultation with the manufacturer!© Ied to the following

changes in our specifications:
1. Starting tube shell shall have an average grain size of ASTM No 6. No grain shall be larger than

ASTM No. 3.
2. Starting size of tube shell to- ‘produce 3/8-111 OD X 0.025-in. wall product shall be 1.125-in. OD by
0.250-in. wall or 1.125-in. OD X 0.187 in. wall. In either case, no more than two intermediate anneals shall

be used and the temperature shall be no higher than 815°C.

3. Prior to the final stress relief, material shall be cleaned in an alkaline solution. The inside surface
shall then be mechanically cleaned by wire brushing and then plckled to remove 0.001 to 0.002 in. from

A quantity of %-in.-OD tubing was purchased according to these modified specifications and was found -

to be ductile at room temperature as measured by our flattening test. The ¥;-in.-OD tubing that was already

on hand was acid etched to remove approximately 0.005 in. from its inside diameter, and selected samples |

were found to. be ductile. It should be noted that, although the as-received “contaminated” tubing was not
ductile in the impact flattening test, it could be bent at room temperature without fracturing. Some
samples were bent up to 90° without evidence of cracks. The rate of bending was found to be important,
but the data were not quantitated.

Welding studies indicated that a preweld stress-relief heat treatment for 1 hr at 875 to 900°C was
desirable to minimize weld cracking; however, samples of %-in.-OD material (CPM-3) became embrittled
when heated to 925°C, and one heat (CPM-6) became embrittled when heated to 860°C. Tubing selected
for loop construction was heat treated for 1 hr at 900°C in vacuum after all bends had been made. In this
way, we took advantage of the as-received ductility of the material for bending and still satisfied the
requirements for a preweld heat treatment. ' '

JOINING DEVELOPMENT

Material selection and preparation. Molybdenum has several characteristics that make it difficult to

fabricate into complex structures by welding. It has a tendency to (l) undergo hot-cracking, (2) develop

porosity in the weld fusion zone, and (3) undergo abnormal grain growth. In addition, it has a
ductile-to-brittle transition temperature in large-grained microstructures (such as occur in the heat-affected
or fusion zones of a weld) well above room temperature, which can easily cause fracture at ambient
tempefature. This latter characteristic makes handling of welded components, such as during subsequent
assembly steps, quite difficult. Consideration was given in the selection of the base material and in the
design and fabrication phases of the program to ways to overcome or at least minimize these characteristics.
The selection of arc-cast molybdenum with low impurity element levels was significant to the welding
development portion of the program. Low impurity levels are very desirable for this metal (especially O,N, and
C) since small amounts of these elements have been shown to have adverse effects on the ductile-brittle tran-
sition temperature and weldability of arc-cast molybdenum 11—-13 Oxygen is especially detrimental, as it

forms low-melting eutectic films with molybdenum, and the presence of these films at grain boundaries can

cause hot-cracking in welds. Molybdenum produced by powder metallurgy techniques was not considered for
the test stand because welds in'commercially available materials of this type have repeatedly been found to
‘contain large amounts of porosity.!4 Therefore, the selection of low-carbon, low-oxygen arc-cast base
material helped to minimize two of the detrimental factors in welding molybdenum, namely, hot-cracking
and porosity formation. Great care was also taken in all subsequent operations to ensure that these

elements were not mtroduced into weldments by surface contamination or by an impure weldmg
atmosphere. - . -
~In order to ensure that the weIds were not adversely affected by surface contamination, all components
were cleaned using the portion shown below of a complex cleaning procedure attributed to Ryan by
Thompson:15 :

1. Degrease with acetone.

2. Immerse for 5 min in a 65—80°C solution of 10 wt % sodium hydroxide, 5 wt % potassium
permanganate, and 85 wt % distilled water.

3. Rinse in flowing tap water, brushing to remove smut.

4. Immerse for 5—10 min in a room-temperature solution of 15 vol % sulfuric acid (95--97 % H,50,), 15
vol % hydrochloric acid (37—38% HCI), 70 vol % distilled water, plus 6—10 wt % chromium trioxide
(Cr03). '

5. Rinse in tap water.
6. Rinse in distilled water.
7. Dry with hot air.

Although we did not find any correlation (as far as leak-tight welds were concerned) with the time
between cleaning and welding, when parts had been excessively handled after the initial cleaning, we did
take the precaution of repeating steps 1and 4—7 of the procedure just prior to welding.

After chemical cleaning, all parts used were given a vacuum stress-relief treatment for 60 min at 875 to
900°C at a pressure of 5 X 1075 mm Hg or less. In our preliminary work, we found that a stress-relief heat
treatment had a major effect on the weldability of the various forms of mol'yb'denum. For example, one
half of a length of %-in.-OD, 0.025-in.-wall tubing was cleaned as previously described and then stress
relieved in vacuum for 60 min at 875°C. The other half of the tube was chemically cleaned only. In a series
of bead-on-tube “ficld” welds on these two pieces by the orbiting gas tungsten-arc process, we found that
the welds on the cleaned and stress-relieved tube were crack-free, while those on the “cleaned only” tube
had extensive center-line cracking. Similar results occurred on other sizes of tubing and on back-extruded
half sections. We tried several other stress-relief temperatures to determine the lowest temperature that -

-would produce the desired improvement in weldability and at the same time have the least effect on

base-metal ductility due to recrystallization. A temperature of 875 to 900°C was apparently optimum from
a weldability standpoint for these components, and it had little effect on the base-metal microstructure, as
shown by Fig. 10. The combination of the chemical-and thermal treatments left the componehts with
surfaces that were lighter gray in color than in the as-received condition, and there was no notlceable
grain-boundary attack by the etchant.

Welding procedure development. Procedures were developed for welding three major joint types for the
test stand, two of which are illustrated in Fig. 4. A “tube-to-header” type of joint was required in seven
locations in which a line terminated in the end of a back-extruded half section. A joint which we refer to as
a “cylindrical girth” joint was welded to attach pairs of half sections together to form the four vessels or
pots. Many welds of the “tube-to-tube” type were required to attach various lines to stubs projecting from
the pots or to one of the six tees. Each of these joint types will be discussed separately below. -

Tube-to-header joint. There are seven major tube-to-header joints in the test stand. Four join
0.875-in.-OD, 0.080-in.-wall tubing (which is machined to 0.050-in. wall in the joint area) to the feed pots;
two attach 1.125-in.-OD, 0.060-in.-wall, 7.25-in.-long stubs of the packed column to the disengaging pots;
and the seventh attaches a 5.25-in.-long machined tube (with a %, -in.-diam section at the weld) to the upper
disengaging pot. There are also other miscellaneous joints of this type in the stand; for example, it was used
in attaching the weirs to the horizontal baffle plates shown in Fig. 11.

To facilitate making this type of weld between the massive bosses on the extruded half sections and the
relatively thin-walled tube, a grqQove or trepan was machined inside the pot around the hole to produce a
corner-flange joint, as previously illustrated in Fig. 4. This design provides a good heat balance between the
two components and excellent mechanical suppoft for the weld. Its major drawbacks are that it is relatively
inaccessible for welding or nondestructive examination. The use of the electron-beam process overcomes
the accessibility problem for welding, and has the added benefit that it minimizes abnormal grain growth in
the fusion zone because it is a process with a high energy density and a low total energy input. Because this
type of joint is difficult to inspect by radiography or ultrasound, we relied on close parameter control,
fluorescent dye penetrant inspection, and/or helium leak detection as our quality assurance techniques
for these welds. , - '

Procedures were developed for electron-beam welding tube-to-header joints in tube sizes of Ve, Y, Yo,
%, and 1% in. outside diameter. The parameters for weldmg all of these sizes of tubing are given in
Appendix B, and an example of these two welds is shown in Fig. 12. The electron-beam welder used is of
the high-voltage, low-current type (150 KV, 0.040 A max) with a chamber 36 in. wide, 23 in. deep, and 24
in. high. In our prehm_mary welds, in which flat plates simulated the vessel ends, we made welds both by the
conventional method of rotating the work under the beam and by using a simple system for manually
rotating the beam in a circle (up to % in. in diameter) on the workpiece. Although we made acceptable
welds using both techniques, we had greater. difficulties in making reproducible welds with the
rotating-beam techmque, 50 all subsequent prototype welds were made by rotating the joint rather than the
beam. This latter technique was somewhat complicated for the two vent tube joints, which were located
away from the center line of the pot, as seen in Fig. 13. However, this was compensated for by a simple
fixture with cross slides for centering the weld under the beam. A close-up of a 0.375-in.-diam
tube-to-header weld is shown in Fig. 14, and a photomicrograph of a helium leak-tight weld joining a
1.125-in.-OD, 0.060-in.-wall tube to a back-extruded molybdenum header is shown in Fig. 15.

Cylindrical girth joint. Both the gas tungsten-arc and electron-beam welding processes were investigated
for the welds required to join two half sections to form each of the four vessels. The joint design used for
the gas tungsten-arc welds is shown in Fig. 16. The tungsten-arc welds were made manually in a
vacuum-purged, . argon-backfilled glove box. This chamber has the basic dimensions of 36 in. in inside
diameter and 56 in. in length, but with available extensions the length can be increased to over 12 ft. The
chamber was evacuated to a pressure of 5 X 107 mm Hg or less prior to backfilling with argon of 99.997%
minimum purity by volume. Filler metal was 0.060-in.-diam low-carbon, low-oxygen molybdenum wire
prepared commercially from cast stock. The electrode was 2% thoriated tungsten, % in. in diameter. No
auxiliary preheating was required for the gas tungsten-arc welds. Evidently the high conductivity of the
molybdenum promotes a rapid distribution of heat throughout the parts (i.e., preheat) before the fusion
temperature is reached at the joint. A photograph of one of the gas tungsten-arc cylindrical girth welds
(which had a helium leak rate less than 1 X 10°% atm cm® sec™") and a cross section through it are shown
in Fig. 17. Note that although this weldment has undergone abnormal grain growth, radiographically there
was no evidence of porosity, and only two small cracks (on the inner surface in the heat-affected zone)
were detected by fluorescent penetrant inspection.

Electron beam girth welds were made using the rotary fixture shown in Fig. 18. A general requirement
for welding with the process, if filler metal is not added, is that the joint must be held tightly together so
that coalescence will occur and so that the resulting weld bead will not be underfilled. The harmful effects
of an underfilled, concave weld bead are especially pronounced in crack-sensitive materials such as

molybdenum. Unfortunately, the complex geometry of the vessel half sections, with their protruding tubes
and internal baffle plates, made the application of end loading by conventional means (such as external pots
or internal rods) quite difficult. To overcome this problem, a technique was develc)ped in which three
0.032-in.-diam molybdenum pins through the step joint were used to hold the halves in intimate contact
during welding. These pins were subsequently fused into the weld.

Parameters for joining molybdenum vessel half sections using the electron-beam process are listed
below. The welds were made using a self-acceleratmg triode design electron gun (S-32). Manual beam
current downslope was used at the end of the weld to prevent crater formation.

1. Joint type — step (illustrated in Fig. 4).

2.Joint thickness — 0.094 in. B |

3. Accelerating potential — 150 lg\-/

4. Beam current — 12 mA preheat and 25 mA weld.
5

. Number of revolutions — 6 for preheat (2 preheat pas§es on either side of and 1 in. away from the joint,
~ and then 2 passes on the joint itself) and 1% for weld.

6. Travel speed — 32 in./min.

7. Focus — 0.015 A defocus.

8. Work distance — 4 in.

Note that in this procedure, extensive preheating was carried out with the defocused beam prior to welding.
A photomicrograph of a cross section through a preliminary electron-beam girth weld in which penetration
through the step was not achieved is shown in Fig. 19. ’

Tube-to-Tube Butt Joint. Tube-to-tube welds joining five sizes of molybdenum tubes were successfully
made in an argon-filled glove box by the gas 'tungsten-arc process both manually and using an automatic
orbiting-arc technique. Using either technique, we were readily able to produce welds that were helium
Jeak-tight and that had little or no porosity as shown by radiographic and metallographic examination.

| However, the orbiting-arc technique was of particular interest after we found that our welders had
considerable difficulty in making manual butt welds in thin-walled molybdenum tubmg without excessive
root reinforcement and without misalignment. These problems were compounded by the necessity of
making the welds in a glove box, which reduces the senses of sight and touch. Several commercial
orbiting-arc weld heads were evaluated, including the head shown in Fig. 20. In this unit the tungsten
electrode is carried around the tube (which remains stationary) by a.copper ring, which also holds a set of
boron nitride gas cups. Inert gas is fed through the handle to provide an atmosphere suitable for welding in
the cavity formed by ‘the cups and body housing. The electrode carrier is rotated by a small dc motor (with
tachometer feedback) in the handle. The tubes are held together and in alignment by a pair of clamshell 4

- clamps, which have removable inserts to adapt.to the various tubing sizes. In order to further reduce any

stresses applied to the weld (such as by tube misalignment), we used several sizes of auxiliary yoke-type

- fixtures outside the weld head clamps, such as the one shown in Fig. 21. Devices of this type are invaluable,

as molybdenum weldments are highly susceptible to cracking under the influence of even small stresses. The
Y-, %-, and Y%-in.-diam tube-to-tube welds were made using a magnetic amplifier power supply with
capabilities for programming both variations in the weldmg current and in the rotational speed of the
orbiting electrode carrier. The %- and 1%-in.-diam tube-to-tube welds were made with _another
programmable power supply, but we did not have a power supply available for varying the speed of the

stepping motor in the orbiting-arc head used for the larger sizes of tubing.

Figure 21 also shows a feature v&hich we added to the orbiting-arc head to permit us to make
molybdenum welds outside the confinement of a glove box: molded rubber sleeves which seal tightly
- around the head and the tubes. Without these sleeves we were unable to make crack-free welds outside the
g inert gas chamber (i.e., in the “field”), whereas with the sleeves we were able to make helium leak-tight
welds in the %-, ¥%-, and ' -in.-diam tubes. However, the results were not as reproducible with the field

procedure and sequence so that a minimum of field welds would be required in construction of the test
stand, as explained later in this report. '

Weld inserts (such as the one shown in Fig. 22 between two tees) were used in the orbiting-arc welds to
aid in controlling root reinforcement and joint misalignment. Because it protrudes slightly above the tube

- surface, it has the additional function of providing a small amount of filler metal for the joint, thus

producing convex weld beads, which we have found to be less prone to cracking than concave beads.

The parameters for butt welding the tubing are given in Appendix C. The important features of the
welding cycles are the relatively long portion at a lower “initial current,” which provides preheating
without fusion of the joint; and the gradual increase in rotatlonal speed (in the cycles for the Y-, %- , and
/2-1n -diam tubes) which minimizes “weld-bead-widening” that occurs in tube welds as the overlap portlon

Filler metal development. In building "cemplex structures from molybdenum, brazing is attractive from
two standpoints: (1) as a replacement for brittle welds and (2) as a reinforcement for welds. But to avord
severe loss of ductility to the base metal, the filler metal must flow below 1200°C.

Several commercial brazing filler metals will braze molybdenum, but they are rich in such metals as
nickel, copper, silver, or gold, which are not corrosion resistant to molten bismuth at 700°C. In addition,
silver is not resistant to corrosion by molten ﬂuorrde salts. Unfortunately, few materials adequately resist
attack by bismuth. The refractory metals, such as molybdenum, tantalum, rhenium, and tungsten, possess
the best resistance; however, it is difficult to depress the melting point of a refractory-metal-based alloy
below 1200°C without completely sacrificing its corrosion resistance by the addition of large amounts of
alloying elements. ‘ . o '_

Under certain conditions, iron anﬂd some of its alloys are reasonably compatible with bismuth. By
alloying iron with small amounts of selected elements, we were able to_depress the melting point of
iron-based filler metals to below 1200°C. Figure 24a shows portions of the binary diagrams!®-17 of
Fe-C, Fe-B, and B-C. The diagrams show that 1 to 4% B or C added to Fe depresses its melting point
significantly. By adding small percentages_of both boron and carbon to iron, we were able to depress the
melting point below 1150°C. We also felt that the addition of molybdenum to the filler metal would
enhance its corrosion resistance to bismuth and minimize dissolution of the molybdenum base metal during
brazing. Even with the addition of molybdenum, we found we could still keep the melting point of the
alloy below 1200°C. Figure 24b shows the binary phase diagrams!6 of Fe- Mo Fe-B, and Mo-B. Since the
temperatures of the liquidus and sohdus of the Fe-Mo diagram decrease as the molybdenum content
increases from 0 to 35%, we were able. to add as much as 25% Mo to the Fe-C-B ternary alloy without
raising the melting temperature above 1175° C. From various wettability and ﬂowablhty tests we found that
additions of 15% Mo, 4% C, and 1% B gave the optimum composition ln an attempt to further depress the
melting temperature, we added small amounts of germamum Adding 5% Ge depressed the melting point to

1050°C and, as a bonus, also improved ﬂowabrhty

To determine mechanical properties of brazed joints made with these expenmental filler metals, we
shear-tested two of the most promising composrtlons Miller-Peaslee shear- test spec1mensl 8,19 were brazed
with alloys Fe—15% Mo—5% Ge—4% C— I% B and Fe—-lS% Mo—4% C—l% B. They were pulled with a tensile
machine ‘at a strain rate of 0.002 in /mln at both room temperature and 650°C. Average test results are
shown in Table 6. Room—temperature shear strengths of these alloys were greater than 30,000 psi, and these
compare favorably with base-metal shear strengths of about 45 ;000 psi. At 650° C the shear strengths of the
joint brazed with Fe-Mo-Ge-C-B averaged 29,000 psi, whereas those with Fe-Mo-C B were 18,000 psi. This
lower strength is, however, more than adequate for most appllcatrons The ductrhtles of joints brazed with
both brazing alloys were outstandmg at 650°C  (elongations of 42 and 50%); and even at room temperature,
where welded molybdenum is brittle, the elq_ngatrons of the brazed ]o_mts were at least 10%.

The experimental bfazing ﬁlle; metals listed iﬁ Table 7 were tested in bismuth and fluoride salts at
700°C. All brazes survived the fluoride salt thermal convection loop tests with no metallographically
detectable corrosion after 1032 hr. A typical example of the after-test appearance of these alloys is shown
in Fig. 25.

For chemical processing applications, compatibility of the braze specimens with bismuth was
considered the most stringent requirement, since the solubility of pure iron in bismuth is 50 ppm at 600°C
and it is known to undergo temperature gradient mass transfer in liquid bismuth.29:21 Molybdenum
tee-joint samples brazed with four of the iron-based filler metals (Table 7) were exposed to static bismuth
for 671 hr at 600°C. The most extensive dissolutive attack occurred in the fillet area of the sample brazed
with the Fe—4% C—1% B alloy. The area between the vertical and horizontal areas of the tee was more
resistant to attack, and electron beam microprobe analysis showed that this area contained 15% Mo, no
doubt as a result of alloying during brazing. Furthermore, the specimens brazed with filler metals
containing molybdenﬁm were considerably more resistant to dissolution in the fillet areas. .

Seven lap-joint specimens brazed with the four brazing filler metals were also exposed to flowing
bismuth in a quartz thermal convection loop at 600 to 700°C for 2000 hr. All seven specimens were intact
after testing. Three had been placed in the hot leg and four in the cold leg of the loop. (The Fe-C-B braze
was placed only in the cold leg.) Weight-changé data were not obtained, since some bismuth adhered to the
specimens after test. Chemical analyses of the bismuth drained from the loop indicated that the amounts of
iron and molybdenum, if present, were below the limit of detection, 3 ppm. Metallographic examination
indicated the presence of one or more layers on the surface of each of the braze fillets. Microprobe analyses
showed that the outer layer was rich in iron and the layer immediately under it was rich ih_mol'ybdenum.

Phases within the braze and along the interface between braze and base metal were also rich in
molybdenum. Also, certain areas were enriched in bismuth, and it is interesting to note that those areas
were associated with the regions of high molybdenum concentration. It appears that a complex
intermetallic compound formed containing molybdenum, bismuth, and other unidentified élements.
Because of limitations of the microprobe equipment, we were unable to analyze for the presence of boron
and carbon, the other elements alloyed in the brazing filler metal.

The results for each specimen were much the same except that a larger amount of bismuth was found in
the fillet of the Fe—4% C—1% B brazement. However, the fillet was still intact, contrary to the results
obtairied in the static capsule test reported above, where dissolution occurred. We feel that the layers rich in
iron and molybdenum near the surface may have passivated the underlying material in this test.

After reviewing all filler metal requirements and the data generated on each of the alloys, we selected
the composition Fe—15% Mo—5% Ge—4% C—1% B as the filler metal for brazing those sections of the
chemical processing test stand that would contain bismuth.

Development of techniques for brazing. Brazing techniques were developed for two purposes to
prov1de reinforcement of the weld zone, which is brittle at room temperature, and to serve as a backup seal
should a leak develop through a cracked joint. In building a Acorriplex system of material that has the impact
sensitivity and reactivity (with oxygen) of molybdenum, many unique techmques had to be developed to
ensure reliable brazed joints. Since specific brazing techniques were needed for the variety of joints
required, much of our work was necessarily devoted to basic joint design and process development and
improvement. We developed several methods of brazing using both resistance furnaces and high- frequency
induction as the heat sources.

Furnace brazing — large pots. The four vessels with attached tubes were brazed in a resistance-heated
vacuum furnace with a hot zone of 7 X 7 X 30 in. In each end of the pots, two or more short lengths of
tubing which were joined to the pots by roll bond or welding were back-brazed. At the same time, a split
ring was brazed around the girth welds joining the two half sections. These subassemblies were brazed at
1075 torr by heating ai a rate of 5°C/min until flow of the brazing alloy was achieved. The temperature was
monitored by several thermocouples placed at various locations throughout the furnace. The parts were

‘positioned in the furnace so the flow of the filler metal could be observed. Figure 26 shows an example of a

3%-in.-diam molybdenum pot in which tubing ]omed by roll bondmg or welding was back-brazed, and a
split ring covering the girth-weld was brazed into place

In our preliminary work, we learned that a joint gap of at least 0.001 in. was necessary to ensure proper
flow of the brazing filler metal into the joint. However, the joint preparation for roll bonding and welding
required a tighter fit. Therefore, the portioh of the joint to be back-brazed was counterbored an extra
0.001 to 0.002 in. on the radius to a depth of % in. Filler metal feeder holes were drilled into the bosses of
the vessels to serve as reservoirs for the brazing ailoy powder and to ensure that the filler metal did not
prematurely flow away from the joint until the thick-walled boss reached the melting temperature. We were
concerned that if the filler metal were placed in the fillet area and the thin-walled tubing reached the
brazing temperature faster than the heavy pot, the filler metal might flow along the hotter tube (and away
from the joint) rather than into the joint. Although the procedure generally was satisféctory, cracking of
the braze metal in the feeder holes proved to be a significant problem. Cracking was detected by a helium
leak-check on the brazed joint and probably was the result of shrinkage stresses as the braze alloy solidified.
To avoid this problem a wire was inserted into the small-diameter portion of the feeder hole before the
filler metal was added, and a molybdenum cap was brazed over the outer end of the reservoir.

Furnace brazing of nozzle bodies. Several nozzle bodies extended through the stainless steel flange of-
the test stand. The bodies were made of nickel or stainless steel and were brazed to at least one
molybdenum line. The joint design included a combination of trepans and feeder holes to obtain proper
flow of brazing filler metal into the joint. We successfully brazed several mockups of these dissimilar metal
joints (Fig. 27). |

“Since a small amount of bismuth vapor could reach the stainless steel nozzle body in the area of the
body-to-molybdenum-tube braze, it was to be brazed with the iron-based filler metal. None of the nickel

" nozzle bodies were to be exposed to bismuth, so they could be brazed with a commercial brazing filler

metal. Several filler metals were evaluated for the latter use, and Au-18% Ni was selected because it flowed
adequately. Each of the nozzle brazes was to be made vertically in a vacuum furnace by resistance heating
in the area of the nozzle only. To avoid several additional welded and brazed joints in the molybdenum
tubing, an extension was added to the furnace to accommodate tubing up to 6 ft long.

" Glove box brazing. For brazing of sections of the 17-ft-long test stand that would not fit into any

available furnace, it was necessary to design and build portable furnaces for localized heating in a glove box.
The controlled atmosphere of the glove box was utilized to prevent oxidation of all portions of the
assembly that were heated durihg the brazing operation. We investig'ated two types of localized heating
sources: resistance and induction. Each has merit for different braze joints, dependmg on the size and
location. : | _
Two types of resistance-heated furnaces were built, both utilizing tantalum heating elements. One had a
helical heating element for brazing those joints over which it could be slipped on and off. The other had a
split tantalum-sheet heater which could be opened and placed over the welded joint in situ and then
removed after brazing. This feature was necessary on sections where the furnace could not be slipped overa
large or complex section to reach the braze region.

We investigated induction heating for use both inside and outside an atmosphere chamber. We
experienced problems with arcing in the glove box under afgon or helium atmospheres as well as in vacuum
when the brazing alloy binder (used for preplaéing the filler metal) volatilized. We overcame this difficulty
by installing an auxiliary transformer to reduce the high voltage from the power supply to low voltage and
high amperage at the coil. With this new attachment, we were able to braze inside the glove box in argon or
helium without arcing problems. By changing the geometry of the copper leads from thin-walled tubing to

closely spaced bus bars, we were able to easily achieve brazing temperature on even the largest size of tubing
with attached heat sinks. Figure 28 shows a spIit sleeve brazed around a weld joining a length of 1'%4-in. -diam
tubing to a stub attached to a prototype vessel. A helical induction coil was slipped over the sleeve, and
brazing was completed in 35 min by heatlng only the immediate area of the part. The heating rate was
closely controlled, and the brazmg temperature was monitored by a thermocouple placed under the edge of
the split sleeve. Alternatively, we brazed this same 1%-in. diam configuration by heating locally with a
portable resistance furnace. The portable resistance furnace is also capable of brazing all of the smaller
tube-to-tube joints, prowded that there is enough space around the tubing for the 3-in.-diam, 5-in.-long

 insulated heater and that the assembly will fit into a vacuum chamber.-

Field brazing. Seven tubes have to be joined in the field to connect the subassembhes Tubing of the

size Y-, %-, %;-, and possibly Yg-in. outside diameter will first be welded and the split sleeves back-brazed

on site. In this regard we field-brazed (by induction) sleeves on mockups of all of these sizes of tubing. We
surrounded the part to be brazed with a quartz tube placed inside the induction coil. Helium gas flowed
over the heated area to protect the braze from air. However, the 1nduct10n coil was still operated in air.
When the induction unit was activated,” the 2-in.-long section of tubing with the split sleeve was quickly
brought to brazing temperature. Because of the small mass of material being heated, adjacent areas
remained relatively cool, and the entire brazing cycle took less than 5 min.

Ge—4% C—1% B over a tungsten-arc weld.

We have also investigated the use of split induction coils. Split coils have an advantage in removability,
as described for the split resistance heater. With a 1-in. split coil, we reached brazing temperature on a
',-in.-diam tube and matching split-sleeve assembly. Unfortunately, the 1-in. split coil did not couple well
enough electrically with other sizes. As a result, we obtained additional split coils for the other sizes of
tubing, both smaller and larger, but this phase of our investigation was not completed.

Mechanical Couplings
J. R. DiStefano

Although little was known relative to mechanical couplings of molybdenum, we felt that such joints
would be desirable because they would (1) allow relatively easy replacement of components in case of a
failure and (2) allow us to avoid making a difficult tube-to-header weld in locations where a tube passed
through the end section of a feed pot.

To investigate resealable joints, experimental metal seal couplings for Y-in.-OD tubing were obtained
from Gamah Corporation?2? and Aeroquip Corporation.?3 Both of these couplings used molybdenum seal
tings, but a threaded nut applied the force that sealed the Gamah joint, while an external compressive force
was required to seal the Aeroquip joint and then a gate or pin used to maintain the compressive force on
the metal seal ring. This latter design is aimed at remote applications and is attractive because molybdenum
components easily gall and a threaded nut is particularly susceptible to this problem. However, probiems
encountered in sealing the Aeroquip joint resulted in our cracking one of the molybdenum components,
and further evaluation was discontinued. |

An additional experimental coupling was built at ORNL with the design shown in Fig. 29. The
components of this coupling were all made of molybdenum, but the seal gasket was made of a laminated
carbon product called Grafoil.24 Grafoil is a low-density graphite foil {70 1b/ft*) that is useful as a gasket
material; its compressive modulus increases from 7000 to 50,000 psi as load is applied. Both this coupling
and the Gamah coupling were tested for tightness by measuring their helium leak rates before and after
thermally cycling from room temperature to 650°C. Each was leak-tight (<5 X 1078 atm cm® sec ™) prior
to being thermally cycled ten times to 650°C. After thermal cycling, the ORNL-designed joint remained
leak-tight, but the Gamah joint had a helium leak rate of 5 X 107 atm cm? sec™!. It was disassembled and
returned to the company, and no further evaluation of this joint was made. We disassembled the Grafoil

seal ring coupling, resealed it, and then thermally cycled it several more times. It continued to be helium
leak-tight (<5 X 1073 atm cm? sec™!) as before. This coupling was more easily disassembled than previous
joints because of its modified rounded thread design. Although resealable couplings of this type were
demonstrated to be experimentally feasible, they were not included in the final design of the test stand
because of space and cost limitations.

In addition to joints that can be dlsassembled mechanical tube-to-header connections were developed
for attachmg certain lines, as indicated in Fig. 4. Two techniques, magneforming and roll bonding, were
investigated. In magneforming, magnetic pressures of up to 50,000 psi resultihg from current discharged
through a coil from a capacitor bank are applied in pulses of 10 to 20 X 107 sec duration. No direct
mechanical contact between the machine that applies the force and the work is involved. Four tube-to-tube
joints in which one tu'be‘ fitted inside the other were fabricated, but the lowest helium leak rate for these
joints was 2 X 107% atm cm® sec™ at room temperature.

In roll bonding, a tool containing expandable rollers mechanically forces the two surfaces together.
Tube expanders were obtained commercially, and some of them are shown in Fig. 30. These tube expanders
were specially made to meet the length requirements for joining %-, %-, and %-in.-OD tubes to the
back-extruded half sections. The long lengths were required because some of the tubes to be bonded
extended into the pots for some distance, and bends on the exit end prevented access from that direction.
The tool expands inside the tube to force the tube wall partially onto the lands formed by grooves
machined inside the boss, as shown in the upper left-hand portion of Fig. 4. -

In order to lessen the chances of splitting the tube during bonding, joints were made at approximately
250°C. Although roll bonding was first done successfully in air at this temperature, an inert atmosphere is

) required to prevent contamination of areas that must be subsequently welded or brazed. Therefore, further

roll-bonding development was carried out in an inert- atmoéphere chamber, as shown in Fig. 31. Leak-tight

~joints (<1 X 1077 atm cm?® sec™) were made at 250°C using Necrolene25 plus molybdenum disilicide as a

The torques listed are approximately the highest values that could be achieved. Attempts to increase the
torque were generally unsuccessful, as the tube expanders began'to slip and the molybdenum tubing began
to flake on the inside surface. These joints were also leak-tight after being thermally cycled ten times from
room temperature to 650°C. |

Brazing was to be used to strengthen the roll-bonded joints, but since the filler metals developed were
not completely resistant to attack by bismuth, we also investigated the application of a tungsten or
molybdenum coating around the joint on the inside of the vessel. The coatings were applied by chemical
vapor deposition techniques using hydrogen reduction of WF¢ and MoF, at about 600 and 900°C
respectively.26:27 Several mockups of a roll-bonded tungsten-coated and brazed joint were made, and a
section through a typical joint is shown in Fig. 32. Higher-magnification enlargements indicate the extent of

bonding that has been effected between the tube and boss by the three methods of sealing. Note that the
molybdenum tube has sealed against the boss along the land between the grooves, but there is no evidence
of material flowing into the groove. This would indicate that the depth of the groove (0.020 in. in this case)
is relatively unimportant in making this type of joint. Some material flows into the tube-boss crevice in
both CVD tungsten coating and back-brazing. However, the brazing filler metal genefally penetrated
considerably further than the CVD tungsten coating did.

CONSTRUCTION

The construction portion of this project can be divided into four stages. These are: (1) construction of a

full-size mockup of the test stand, (2) fabrication and prefit of components, (3) joining of components into
subassemblies, and (4) interconnection of subassemblies to complete the test stand. Stage 4, however, has

not been completed.

Mockup Construction

A full-scale mockup of the test stand was constructed of wood and stainless steel tubing. It was an
invaluable tool in m‘émy different areas, including des_ign,‘fabrication, and assembly. The mockup was
initially built from a set of preliminary piping drawings. Final piping drawings were prepared after studying
the mockup and making various changes to optimize locations of lines and components.

" The mockup was also used to ensure that lines were accessible for welding and brazing and to determine
the speciﬁc locations of all of the weld joints. Problems encountered in constructing the mockup (such as
difficulties in making complex tube bends) were worked out in this phase, thus making fabrication of the
molybdenum tubes much easier. The experience gained by the pipe fitter on the mockup also proved
valuable when actual test-stand construction was started.

| Fig. 33. Wood and steel mockup of the molybdenum test stand installed on the assembly jig.

After desigh of the system was essentially ﬁhal_ized, an assembly jig was built that was also to be used
for transporting the completed stand to the experiment cell for installation. The major design criterion for
this jig was that it had to be very rigid to minimize flexing of the loop during moving. The resulting
structure (as seen in Fig. 33 with the mockup installed) was a long central spine consisting of an 8-in.-wide
flange 1 beam for axial stiffness', with two 8-in, channels welded on for additional resistance to torsional
loads. Cross members were used to support the stainless steel flange from which the loop would be
suspended, for attachment of casters, and for attachment: of trunnions to be used for pivoting during
erection. | E o

A detailed procedure was written for transportation of the completed test stand from the assembly area
in the Metals and Ceramics Division to the experimental cell on the third floor of the Chemical Technology
Division building, where the test stand was to be operated. Because of the expected fragility of the
completed system and the time delay arid added expense if. the loop were damaged, a full run-through of
the entire transportation procedure was carried out using the mockup. The assembly jig was instrumented
with strain gages to measure deflections and with accelerometers to record load magnitudes. These factors
were monitored during the entire move except for a brief period while the test stand was on a truck
between buildings. In addition to these quantitative measurements, several pieces of molybdenum tubing,

which contained both bare welds and welds protected by brazed sleeves, were attached to the mockup at

strategic locations. The niockup and assembly jig are shown in Fig. 34. The practice move was a complete
success in that it was carried out very smoothly, the loads and deflections recorded were well below
acceptable values, and on remspectxon we found that the welded specimens had not been damaged

Fabrication and Prefit of Components

The next stage involved the substitution of molybdenum components for the wood and steel
components of the mockup on the assembly jig. The lengths of the various lines were matched with the
available lengths of molybdenum tubing, and selection was made to aifoid, whenever possible, any
unnecessary weld joints.

All tubes were bent at room temperature with standard hand or bench-mounted tubing benders.
Mandrels or other supports were not used inside the tubing, so that, in some cases, there was a slight
flattening in the bend. Flattening occurred predominantly in some early bends (on Y- and %-OD tubing)
made with a hand bender with a single fixed die. We subsequently minimized this condition by switching to
a bench-mounted bender which had both a fixed and a sliding die. Examples of some of the bends made on
the test stand are shown in Fig. 36. o :

After bending, the tubes were cut at the required weld-joint locations using a specially designed abrasive
cutoff device. It was necessary to cut the lines at positions about 6 in, from the pots under the constraint of
the size limitations of the vacuum chamber of the electron-beam welder used for making the
header-to-header welds. The relatively small size of this chamber (36 in. wide, 23 in. deep, and 24 in. high)
limited the total length of a vessel half section and its protruding tubes to about 17 in. The cutoff device,
which was designed and built at ORNL, features a 4-in.-diam thin abrasive wheel powered by a small dc
motor mounted on a machinist’s cross slide for precise movement. A slit V-block was used to support both
ends of the tube being cut. With this equipment, we were able to make cuts in molybdenum tubing that
required no subsequent preparation prior to joining by welding.

After all of the various lines were bent and installed, along with the unjoined pots, on the field-assembly
jig, the tubing was removed, degreased with acetone, and stress-relieved in vacuum for 60 min at 900°C. We

decided not to attempt to chemically clean the entire lengths of tubing using the procedure described above
under “Material Selection and Preparation™ but to locally clean the ends of the tubes just prior to welding.
We were concerned that we would be unable to remove the smut left by cleaning from inside the bent
tubing. After stress-relieving, all components were once again installed on the assembly jig for a final fit-up
check prior to construction.

Fabrication of Subassemblies

Four sections of the loop were fabricated as separate subassemblies. These were the bismuth and salt
feed pots and the upper and lower disengaging sections. Although each of these subassemblies was different,
the basic steps taken in their fabrication were the same, and these are as follows:

ot

. Join tubes to half section (header) with electron-beam weld

. Attach remaining tubes to half section with roli bond

. Helium leak check half section |
. Apply tungsten by chemical vapor deposition to inside of half section
. Helium leak check

. Install internal components such as baffle plates

. Assemble two half sections and pin with molybdenum pins

Interconnection of Subassemblies

The completed subassemblies will be reinstalled on the assembly jig for a final check of the fit-up
of the various tube-to-tube weld joints. Qur basic philosophy with regard to final assembly of the test stand
is that wherever possible, all welds and brazes will be made in the protective atmosphere of a welding
chamber. However, even with an extension that increases the length of our chamber to over 12 ft, we will
be unable to-accommodate the entire test stand, so that some welds will have to be made outside the glove
box. However, by careful planning, we have developed an assembly sequence in which only the final 7 of 43
tube-to-tube welds will have to be made in the field. The test stand will be welded in three major sections,
with each section being alternately transferred to a rigid beam for installation in the welding chamber.
After all the joints on a given section have been welded and the remforcmg sleeves brazed, the completed

- section will be reinstalled on the assembly jig for final field welding.

Specification MET-NDT-3

Tentative Specification for the Ultrasonic Inspection
of Metal Pipe and Tubing

Introduction

This standard includes requirements of ASTM E213-68, "Ultrasonic

Inspection of Metal Pipe and Tubing for Longitudinal Discontinuities,”

with modifications and additional requirements. Sections and paragraphs

of ASTM E213-68 not specifically mentioned in this standard remain as

written in the ASTM Standard. Modified sections are arranged under the
same headings and paragraph numbers as employed in ASTM E213-68 with the
modified portions of the sections underlined. This specification covers

both (a) longitudinal and (b) transverse flaw detection techniques.

However, only the longitudinal test is applied if a specific request

 

for the transverse test is not specified by the service request. Require-

 

ments are mandatory unless specifically excepted by the service request
which also shall specify the applicable examination level.

A,

Longitudinal Flaw Detection
Scope

1. This method covers a procedure for detecting longitudinal dis-
continuities in metal pipe and tubing using pulse-reflection
ultrasonic contact or immersion techniques. It is intended to
be used for tubular products having outside diameters from
approximately 1/8 to 6 in. These techniques have been used
for smaller and larger sizes, however, and may be specified
upon contractural agreement by the purchaser and the producer.

Calibration Standards

(d) The notch dimensions shall be as given below for the specified
examination level. The applicable examination 1evel shall
be as specified by the service request.

Calibration of Apparatus

(¢) A strip chart recording of each successful calibration shall
be made and labeled with the appropriate identification (i.e.
date, time, notch size, notch location and identification of
the calibration standard).

Procedure

(h) During the inspection, strip chart recordings of the ultra-
sonic response for each tube shall be made and labeled with
the appropriate identification (i.e. date, time, tube number,
numbered end of the tube, tube length, the starting and
stopping positions on the trace, and identification of the
calibration standard).

(a) A calibration standard of a convenient length shall be
prepared from a length of pipe or tube of the same diameter
and wall thickness, material, surface finish, and nominal
heat treatment as the material to be-inspected. The cali-
bration pipe or tube shall be free of discontinuities or
other conditions producing "noise" indications which can
cause constructive or destructive interference with the
detection of the reference notches. A transverse reference
notch shall be introduced on the outer and inner surfaces
of the standard. If both reference notches are to be
generated on the same end of the standard, they shall be
at least 120 deg apart. All upset metal burrs, etec.,

Develogigg

Repeat drying operation as outlined in Section 5. The temperature
of air used for drying shall not exceed 150°F for materisl of less
than 1/4-in. thickness and a maximum of 200°F for thicker material.
A minimum drying time shall be used so as to just dry the part but
not permit evaporation of the penetrant. Dry developing powder
shall be applied thinly and uniformly to the entire surface of the
part. Excess powder shall be knocked off by gently shaking or
tapping the part or by use of low-pressure clean compressed air.
The developing time shall be as specified in Table 1.

Inspection

10.(a) After the development of indications, inspect the parts with a

high-intensity "black light" in a darkened area or booth. The
black light for inspection shall be attained by using no less
than a 100-w mercury vapor bulb of the sealed reflector type
with a visible-light filter. The maximum distance between the
black light and the piece being inspected shall be 15 in.

(b) The operator shall allow his eyes to become accustomed to the:

darkness of the inspection booth before inspecting the parts.

VISIBLE DYE-PENETRANT PROCEDURE

Penetrant Application

11.(a) The application of dye penetrant shal% not be attempted until

12,

the precleaning and drying operations ‘required in Sections L

and 5 have been completed.

(v) Penetration time begins at the time of immersion or other

application of the penetrant. The minimum penetration time is
set forth in Table 1. All surfaces of the part shall be wetted
for the entire time.

(c) The tempersture of parts during penetrant application shall not

exceed 100°F or be less than 60°F. '

Penetrant Removal

The penetrant shall be removed by wiping with a clean cloth dampened

with solvent, followed by wiping with a clean, dry cloth. Use of

solvent-saturated cloths or flushing'with solvents fbr'penetrant
removal is prohibited. - -

Develoging

13.(a) After excess penetrant has been removed and parts are dried, a

thin, uniform coating of developer shall be applied to the area
being inspected. The developer shall be thoroughly agitated
both before using and periodically during application.

(b) The developer shall be applied so that there are no laps or runs

that may obscure fine indications.

 
 

-(c)

 

 

56

If the requirements of (a) or (b) are not met or if the part
displays an excessive pink hue after the developer has been
applied, the part shall then be thoroughly cleaned so as to

‘meet the cleanliness requirements of Section 4(a). The entire

inspection procedure shall then be repeated.
