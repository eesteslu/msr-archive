MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTEREY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY
PART 1. REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES
1.1. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STUDIES AND NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

A design study is being made of a 30-Mw, one=-region, experimental,
molten-salt reactor. A power plant arrangement has been developed that
1s baged on fabrice‘biiity and maintenance considerations. Designs have
been prepared of a fuel sampling and enriching mechanism, system pre-
hesating devices, and off=-gas system valves,

A preliminary design and cost-estimate study has been completed on
a 315-Mw (e) graphite-moderated molten~-salt power reactor. In this
resctor the molten~salt fuel flows through holes in the ecylindrical,
unclad, graphite moderator, which is contained in en INOR-8 vessel.

The low-enrichment (1.30% U=S7, initielly) fuel mixture is L:LF-BeFa-
UF), (T70-10-20 mole %). | '

Nuclear calculations relative to the experimental resctor have been
completed in which the reactivity effects of various modificetions were
evaluated. It was estimated that the experimental reactor would have an
over-ell temperature coefficient of reactivity of ~6.75 x 107 =2
(6k/k) /oF, o o |

The effect of neutron and @.mmauray activi’by in. 'hhe secandary

: _'-_'-heat exchanger ef the interim deeign reactor of using the salt mixture

G ':.;_L:I.F-BeF (63-37 mole %) es the coela.nt., 1in place of sodium, has been

Y 'ﬂetudied. "It vas found that ’che gamm—ray dose would be enly one~half
;ithat expected from sedium, a.nd that no appreciable neu‘bron activity

would 'be present.

 
 

 

—iVm

The nuclear effects of processing molten-salt fuels to remove the
rare~-earth fission products by ion exchange with CeF3 heve been investie
gated. A comparison with performance of the system utilizing the

'flﬁoride-volatilityjprocessing method showed that the ion-exchange

mgthbd gives 50% lover aversge critical inventory and a 30% lower

cumulative net;burnup. | |
Modifications have been made to the Oracle programs.Cdrnpohe and

Sorghum_tc permit evaluations of heterogeneous reactorg, and Oracle

pfogram GHIMSR bas been written to expedite heating calculations. Follow-
ing test calculations with the modified programs, initial and long-term .

nuclear performance calculations were made for two-low-enrichment, one-
region, graphite-moderated, unreflected, molten-salt reactors. The
results indicate the effect of adding thorium to the fuel mixture. The
fuel used in one calculation was LiF-BeF,-UF) (70<10-20 mole %), as
described above, and in the other the fuel was LiF-BeF,-ThF) (67~16-13
mole %) plus sufficient U235Fh-U238Fh to make the system criticsl. For
a cumulative power generation of 7200 Mwy, the critical inventory with-
out thorium was 4386 kg and, with thorium, was 1416 kg. The cumulative
net burnup without thorium was 1400 kg, and, with thorium, was 1083 kg.
Calculations of the performance of a thoriume-containing graphite-
moderated and -reflected system were initiated. '

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Investigations have been continued of salt-lubricated bearings
for molten-salt pumps. Bearing and Journal parts fabricated of INOR-8
are being subjected to numerous tests to determine optimum design and
operating conditions. Equipment for testing salt-lubricated thrust
bearings was designed and construction is nearly complete. A PK type
of centrifugal pump is being prepared for service tests of molten-salt
lubricated bearings. The favorable results being obteined with these

bearings have resulted in the postpdnément of tests of'the moie complicated.
hydrostatic type of bearing. | |

The modified Fulton-Sylphon belloWSdmounted seal being subJected to
an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has continued to
seal satisfectorily for more than 10,000 hr of operation. . Operation of
an MF type of centrifugel pump with fuel 30 as the circulated fluid has
continued to be satisfactory through more than 13,500 hr, with the past
11,500 hr of operation being under cavitation damage conditions.

A small frozen-lead pump seal on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft has operated
since the first 100 hr of almost 5000 hr of operation with no lead
leakage. Test operation of & similar seal on & 3 1/4~in.~dia shaft has
been initiated. |

Techniques for remote maintenanée of the reactor system have been
investigated further. 'Specificaliy;'improvementé-wEre‘maae'in~the_
freeze-flange Joints being developed for remote connection of molten=-
selt and sodium lines. Construction work continued on the remote-mainte-
nance demonstration facility.

Equipment for salt-to-salt heat transfer tests has been completed.
Date are being obtained with which to determine heat trensfer coefficients.
A heat exchanger has been designed with which to evaluate triplex
tubing for use in molten-salt or liquid metal-to-gteam superheater appli-
ations. A small heat exchanger test stand will be modified for testing

of the heat exchanger.., __':". f o e o ;
| Further tests of commercial expansion Joints in molten~sa1t 1ines
have demnnstrated conclusively that such Joints are not suiteble. Typical

Operation of forcedacirculation corrosionwtesting loops has been

__“'\continued, and.mnst of the 15 1oops have been modified to prevent freeze-
,'?ups of the salts being circulated.,- ' '

 
 

 

 

 

 

- Vi -
Operation of the first in-pile loop. was started at the MTR on |
- December 3, 1958 and had continued satisfactorily through 860 hr when
it wa.s shut down because of the leakage of fission gases. The radiation
release has been traced to a partially plugged pump-=sump purge-outlet

line which caused fiesion gases to back-diffuee up the pump-sumpvpurge—
inlet line to a point outside the cubicle, where they escaped through

”'y)

a leak.
The assembly of an improved in-pile loop is approximately 60%

complete.
1.3, ENGINEERING RESEARCH

Modifications in the design of the capillary efflux viscometers
and in the method of calibration have led to more precise data on the
viscosiﬁies of the salt mixtures LiF-BeFE-UFh (62-37-1 mole %)'and-

LiF -BeF,-UF) -ThF), (62-36.5-0.5-1 mole %). At the lower temperatures .
the viscosities are significantly lower than those previously reported.
The solidephase enthalpies and heats of fusion have been obtained for
three LiCl-KCl mixtures.

Fabrication, assembly, and initial calibrations are continuing on
compoﬁents for the forcedscirculation loop designed to ascertain the
presence and effect of interfacial thefmal registances in systems :¢irs
culating BeFa-containing salts. Heat-transfer coefficient measurements

will be made as a means of studying surface film formation.

for 1000 hr have been completed. Anomalous results were obtained that-
gre largely attributeble to impurities in the circulated salt mixtures.
No forced-circulation loop tests were completed during the quarter. .
Mechanicel property tests bave been made on Inconel and INOR-8 speci-
mens that were carburized by exposure for 4000 hr at 1200°F in & system
containing sodium and graphite. Carburization was found to decrease the
tensile strength and'elongation of INOR-8. On the other hand, carburi-
zation increaged the tensile and yleld strengths of Inconel and decreased
the elongation. The results of chemical analyses of the specimens were used
to establish relationships of carbon content vs distance from specimen
surface for various time intervals. |
Similer specimens exposed for 40O hr to sodium conteining graphite

shoved no evidence of carburization., Specimens of Inconel and INOR-8

were also exposed at 1300°F to fuel 130 containing graphite for 2000
and 4000 hr. The Inconel specimens were attacked and showed reductions
in mechanical strength.' The INOR-8 specimens showed no carburization
and only slight attack after 4000 hr.

Further-tests have been made in the study of the compatibility of
graphite and molten-galt mixtures. Uranium oxide precipitation has
occurred in all tests with fuel 130. The quantity of uranium precipitated
appears to be en indirect function of the purity of the graphite. Attempts
are being made to eliminate the precipitation by using purer graphite.
Tests are ‘also under way'to investigate the penetration of graphite by

fuel mixtures as & funotion of time, temperature, anﬂ.pressure.

The strength proPerties of INOR-B at high temperatures are being
investigated in tensile, creep, relaxation, and fatigue tests. Prelimi-
nary data indieate that the ereep properties in molten salte at 1200°F

are the same as “those in eir.; Tests of. notch sensitivity have indicated
,”:that INOR-B is notoh strengthened at room—temperature and et 15009F
't‘Rotatingdbeam fatigue studies ere being conducted under subcontract at
-Battelle Memoriel Institute. | o ' | |

Fabricétion'and'welding-and brazing studies are béing made of triplex-
tube heat,exéhangers. The'tubing'consists of two concentric tubes with
a'porous-metél-filled annulus. Means are being sohght for_obtaining good
conductivity:across the annulus and adequate permeability of helium through
the pofous métai for leak detection. Prefabricated porous materlals are
being obtained from commercial sources for evaluation, o

Studies .of composites of INOR-8 and type 316 stainless steel have
shown the alioys to be compatible ét temperatures up to 18009F Such
composites therefore appear to be pramising for use in fused. salt-to-
sodium heat exchangers. '

, Verious ‘means for deoxidizing and purifying ingots of INQR-B weld
metal have been studied as means for improving the ductility of INOR-B ,
weldments. The ductility at 1500°F has been increased from an average
of 7% to 13 to 15%, and further improvements are thought to be possible.
No increase in high-temperature ductility'was obtained by decreasing
the carbon content.

A niobium-containing coated electrode, designated Inco Weld "A"
electrode, w%s investigated for use in joining dissimilar metals. The

| studies showed that where the metallicearc welding process could be

used, such weld deposits would be satisfactory for Joining dissimilar

metals for high-temperature service. o |
Molyhdenum-to Inconel joints were brazed with several materials

in connection with the fabrication of a pump-ghaft gxtension. A1l Joints

showed a tendency to crack because of stresses built up by the different

thermel expansion properties of the bése materials.

2.2. CHEMISTRY;AND RADIATION DAMAGE

- Phasge stndies are being conducted to determine_whether the NaF-
BeFE-UFh system has any advantages over the LiF-BeFé-ThFh-UFh system.

"“fncoefficients of chromium in chromium-nickel alloys with Cr
'rradiotracer. The results of recent experiments have shewn that the

systems will restrict the ThF, concentration to the range 10 to 15 mole %.
The substitution of UFh for part of the ThFh would-be,expected to lower
the liquidus temperature. ‘

Plutonium trifiuoride has been found to be sufficiently soluble in
LiF-BeF, end NaF-BeF, melts to form a fuel mixture for a high-temperature
plutonium-burning reactor. An apparatus was developed in which l-g
samples can ‘be used for phase-relationship studies.

The system KF-LiF-BeF2 is being investigated ag a possible reactor
coolant., Such mixtures would have 1ower gamma, activity than similar
NaF-base mixtures after irradietion. The mixture LiCl-RbCl is also
being examined as a possible coolant. Experimental studies of the com-
patibility of the chloride mixture with fuel mixtures have shown that
no urenium compound‘would deposit as the primary phase at reactor temper-
atures.

- In studies.of fission-product behavior, it was found that additions
of UF) had no effect on the solubility of CeF; in LiF-BeF, (62-38
mole %). In another experiment it was demonstrated that the addition
of CeF3 to remove SmF3 from LiF-BeFa-UFh nixtures was effective even
vhen the SmF3 was present in trace ameunts. The behavior of oxides in
molten fluorides is being studied as part of an effort to explore
chemical reactions which can be adapted to the reprocessing of molten-
fluoride-salt reactor fuels._ | |

‘In the study of the chemistry cf the corrosion process, the

"activity coefficients of the fluorides of structural metels in dilute
':fsolutions of molten fluorides have been measured.. The data are useful

in understandlng and predicting ‘the corrosion reactions which take

;'fgplace in systems in whlch.molten fluorides are in contact with alleys
"’Vof these metels.;_ ' Tl . "

chromium in Inconel. Grain size é.ppears to be & contfolliné factdr.
Hydrogen firing and annea.ling in helium he.d the same effects on the
over-all diffusion rate.

‘Salt samples taken from operating forced-circulation corrosion=-
testing loops with decreasing frequency were ana.lyzed. Samples taken
from an INOR-B loop. during the first 1000 hr showed a slow but pteady
inerease of chromium from ebout l|20 to 530 ppm, Sampleg from an Inconel
loop showed an increase in chromium content from about 350 to 450 in
500 hr. The chromium content of neither salt has reached a gteady-
state value. |

Vapor pressures af CsF-BeF are being measured to obtain values
~on which to bage estimates of the vapor pressures of LiF-BeF, mixtures..
" Activities in the LiF-BeF system cennot be obtained from vapor-pressure
measurements because of complex essociation in the vapor phage. The
vepor pressure of liquid UFL; ves measured between L and 180 mm Hg
(1030 to 1300°C).

Further studies have been made of gaseous aluminum chloride as
& heat transfer medium. Calculations indicate that very low pumping
power would be required and that it .would be useful as a turbine
working fluid. Experimental investigations of the compatibility of
gluminum chloride and structural metals have ghown very little attack,

Reactor-grade graphite impregnated with LiF-MgF, has been' tested
in LiF-BeF,-UF, at 1250°F for 800 hr and examined for uranium pene-
tration. Complete penetration of beryllium and uranium was found in
decreasing amounts with distence from the surface.

A serles of tests was run to determine the effect of thermal cycling |
on salt stability. It was found to be important in the handling of
beryllium-based fuels to ensure complete melting of & batch before any
portion isg tré.nsferred to enother 4eontainer or test rig. Thermal
cyciing under static conditions must be avoided,

The in-pile thermal convection loop that was being readied for
insertion into the LITR vas found to have & deposit at the bottom of
the lower bend. Examination of the fuel from which it was filled
revealed the presence of UO2 on solid pleces. A second loop is being
assembled. ' .

- Methods have been developed for synthesizing simple fluorides by
reactions with stannous fluoride. The following fluorides have been
prepared: Cer, MnF AlFB’ FeF 3, and UFh

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

The solubilities of fluorides of neptunium, corrosion products,
uranium, and thorium were investigated to evaluate their behavior in
the proposed HF dissolution process for recovering'LiF-BeF2 salt. On
the basis of this work, the recovered LiF-BeF, salt after processing
by the HF dissolution method would contain, at most, 0.001 mole %
neptunium. The golubility data indicate that the fluorides of neptunium
and possibly plutonium behave similarly to the rare earth fluorides.
Separation of the recovered LiF-BeF2 from corrogion~product fluorides
would probably be less effective., However, the solubility of any
particular contaminant fluoride is usually less in the presence of

others.

1.1. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STUDIES AND
NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

DESIGN OF A 30-Mw, ONE-REGION, EXPERIMENTAL, MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR

Conceptual designs of an experimental molten-salt reactor and power
plant arrangement have been prepared. In these designs, consideration
has been given to fabricability and to the elimination of avkward design
situations. An attempt has been made to take into account all features
of a finished power plant. Improvements in plant layouts and equipment
design will, of course, result frdm further study.

Reactor'Szﬁtém. The proposed reactor consists of a 6-ft-dia
spheribal core, a heat exchanger abdve.the core, and & sump~-type fuel
pump offset from the main vertical axis and located slightly above the
heat exchanger, as shown in Fig. l.l.l. Liquid fuel leaving the pump
discharge is directed to the top of the heat exchanger, where it passes
downward. Flow through the heat exchanger 1s parallel and countercurrent,
with the fuel outside helical tubes containing an inert molten~-salt heat
transfer fluid. The fuel leaves the heat exchanger through a pipe that
communicates with the top of the spherical core; pesses downward through
the center of the sphere, and reverses its direction of flow at the
bottom. It 1eaves the core through an. annulus at the top. ‘This annulus
feeds the fuel directly to the Sump bowl of the fuel pump. . |

A small portion (about 10%) of the total fuel flow is bypassed
through a8 gas-stripping system.; Directly'above the heat exnhanger, at the

‘end of thé pump-discharge diffuser, there is- a plate perforated‘with small
' nozzles which spray the bypassed fuel above the plate and cause it to be
--intermixed'with helium flowing to an off-gas system.' This helium

' originates as & purge gas in the seal region of the fuel pump. The

reactor fuel system may be filled‘with or drained of fuel through a dip
line that cammunicates with two. valves in series end a storagn tank

(not shown). A fuel enriching and sampling system, which is described in
& following section, 1s appended to the'pump bowl.

There 1s an insulated gas passage surrcunding the core vessel
which constitutes one leg of & heating or cooling loop. This gas loop

18 provided to maintain the fuel above its melting point and below a fixed

maximum temperature during all off-design conditions. The remainder of
the gas loop consists of & blower, a heater, a cooler, and two dampers,
vhich operate to direct the flow through either the heater or the cooler.
The heater ié_desefibed in & following section.

The reactor system is surrounded by & double-walled steel cell. The
space between the two walls is monitored for lesks, Space coolers within
the cell keep the cell walls below 150°F.
| The design of the reactor system provides for semiremote maintenance.
Those components which have the higheSt probability of requiring _
maintenance or replacement are located so that replecement involves &
ninimum of remote operations.

Power Plant Arrangement. Preliminary layouts of the power plant are
presented in Figs. 1.1.2 and 1.l. 3. It may be noted that the reactor is
at a higher elevation than the main condenser in the steam plant. This
arrangement avolds any possibility of flood water entering the reactor
cell. vaiously thie design feature will raise the building cost, and
it may be more econcmical to lower the reactor in relation to the condenser
and at the same time raise the whole plant t0 above the levels of the

'-{coolingswater source. In this case the price to be paid'woﬁld be extra

.pumping costs.r A detailsd study of a partieular site would be required

Fuel Sampling and_Enriching‘Mechanisms The fuel semyiing and
enriching‘mechanism, shown schematieally in Figs. l.1.5 and 1.1.6,
consists of & sampling-pot elevator; a horizontal conveyor; a samplen.
depositing elevator; an enriching-capsule elevator; four, identical,
motorized worm-gear drives; sevéral enriching~capsule magerzines; several
shielded sample carriers; an enricher-magezine press; arsaﬁple-carrier
press; & solenold-operated stop; a eenned remotely controlled gate valve;
a number of canned remotely controlied ball valves; & supply of sampling
capsules; and a supply of enriching capsules. All parts of the system
are enclosed in vacuum-tight piping that is insulated end shielded where
reéuired. Every operation is remotely controlled'ahdfelectrically
interlocked so that accidental improper sequences of operation cannot
damage the equipment.

The sampling-pot elevator carries ‘capsules from the horizontal
conveyor down into the sampling pot of the reacter, either to obtain |
samples or to add enriching capsules. It is actuated by a motor-driven
bronze worm-gear. Between the horizontal conveyer and the reactor are
a ball valve and gate valve. On the down stroke of the elevator plunger,
these must‘be'opened in turn aS'the plunger approaches them, On the up
stroke, they must be closed immediately behind it.

The capsules are propelled along the horizontal conveyor by a transfer

plate suspended from & track. There are ‘breaks in the track where the

three elevators cross it. These breaks are filled‘by the plungers of the
elevators when they'are in the up position. The transfer plate has a
hole in it through which the elevator plungers operate to obtain or deposit

'capsules. T%ere is a solenoid—operated stop provided to center the

transfer plate hole over the sample-depositing elevator. End-ofetravel
stops eenter the ‘hole over the other two elevators.” A boltaon blind
flange ie provided for access at the reactor end of the conveyor, and a

.bolteon_flssge-matching thst‘of_the‘drive unit is welded_to the other end.

At the bottom of the sample~depositing elevator plunger is a pair
of remotely controlled tongs that_érip end release capsules as desired.
In their up position, the tongs bridge the gap in the horizontal
conveyor track. The tongs cannot open until the capsule is within the
shielded sample carrier. At the bottom of the elevator, the shielded
sample carrier rests upon a hydraulic press which forces it against &
seal 1n'the elevator pipe flange to eliminate the necessity of bolting
it. The enriching capsule elevator is similar to the sample-depositing
elevatot. | .
| System Preheating Device. Two designs of the heater bank for
heating the gas used to preheat the reactor system are being considered.
Tdbular heaters with an Ihconel sheath are included in one design and
flat ceramic heaters with an Inconel enclosure are utilized in the other
| design. The main features of the units being studied are listed in
Table 1.1.1l. The chief advantages of the flat ceramic heaters are: (1) the
wattage per unit surface area is less, (2) any number of heater dimensions
can be obtained, (3) the support for the ceramic plate is provided by
the enclosure, (4) fins can be added to the enclosure to provide
additional heat transfer surface if required, and the (5) vertical air
flov may gimplify duct work. ,

A diagram of a heater unit with two, flat, ceramic heaters is shown
in Fig. 1.1.7. A group of these units would provide a héater bank :
with a capacity of 6 to 50 kw in a 2-ft by 2-ft duct.

Off-Gas System Valves. Frozen-bismuth valves are béing considered
for use in the off-gas system, because (1) conventional metal-to-metal
seated valves are not consistently tight in the contaimment of fission-
product gases, (2) valves employing elastomer closures are of limited
life because radiation destroys the elastomer, and (3) dev;ces such as
bellows to replace stem glands tie the life of the valve.to that
of the fatigue limit of the bellows. The use of frozen bismuth in a -
trap to create a perfectly tight valve both processwise and envi:onmeht-

wise has been demonstrated.l_ Valves of this type have been considered
in the past only for limited operation (once open and once closed), but
two schemes for repeat action valves, shown in Figs. 1.1.8 and 1.l1.9,
are now being studied.

The valve shown in Fig. 1.1.8 is gravity and temperature operated.
In the valve open position the bismuth in the lower trap is in the frozen
state. Likewlse, in the valve closed position, all the bismuth shown is
in the frozen state. Heating zones 2 and 3 are operated together only
wvhen thé valve is to be opened; the bismuth is melted for a sufficient
time to allow complete drainage of the trident-shaped upper:trap.
Heating zones 1A or 1B are 0perated.1n conjunction with heating zone 2
when it ig desired to close the vaelve. In this operation bismuth flows
from one of the charge containers to the trident section and is
subsequently-frozen in plaée.' There is enough heat capacity in the
lower trap to prevent melting during the closure operation.

New charges of bismuth may be placed in either charge container
whenever the valve is in the closed position. If the valve is to have
& limited applica%ion, enough charge containers are built in plaée to
c&ver the number of operations expected, and ho attempt is made to add
charges after the original installation.

A gas-pressure and temperature-operated valve is shown in Fig. 1.1.9.
Although it is simpler in’ construetion than the gravityuoperated device, |
it may be argued that it is not foolproof.- Strict control of the maximum

.operating Sas pressure while the sealant 1s in the molten state Would'be
highly'necessary in this device.; : S

PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A 315-Mw (e) GRAPHITE-MODERATED MOLTEN-SALT POWER
REACTOR — '

A preliminary stud32’3 was made of a one-region molten-salt power

reactor in which the fuel is in contact with.thg unclad graphite moderator.

The molten-salt fuel flows through holes in the -graphite, which is
contained in a cylindrical INOR-8 vessel. -The graphite core is 12.25 ft
in diameter and 12.25 £t high, with 3.6-in.-dia holes én 8-in. centers.
The fuel, LiF-BeF,-UF, (70-10-20 mole %), contains low-enrichment (1.30%)
uranium, and it occupies 16% of the core volume. A diagram of the:reasctor

- gystem 1s shown in Fig. 1.1.10.

- The choice of the power level for this design study was arbitrary,
since the core is capable of operation at 1500 Mw (th) without: exceeding
safe poﬁer densities. An electrical generator of 333-Mw (e) capacity
was chosen, which would give a station output of 315 Mw (e). The reactor
power rating would thus Be:760.Mw {th).

A plan view of the reactor plant layout is presented in Fig. l.l.ll,
end an elevation view is shown in Fig. 1.1.12. The reactor and the
primary heat exchangers are contdined in a large rectangular reactor cell,
which is sealed to provide double containment for any léakage of fission
gases. The rectangular configuration of the plant permits the grouping
of'similar equipment with a minimnm‘of_floor gspace and,piping; The
plant includes, in addition to the réactor'and heat exchangar systems

'The off=gas system provides for the continuous removel of fissione
product gases and serves several purposes. Theﬂsafety of the system in
the event of a fnel spill is'considerably enhanced if the radioective
gas concenfration in the fuel is reduced by stripping the gas as 1t is
formed. Further, the nuclear stability of the reactor under changes of
power level is Improved by keeping the high—crosw-section,Xel35
continuously at a low level. Finally, many of the fission-product poisons
are, in their decay chains, either noble gases for a period of time or
end their decay chains as stable noble gases, and therefore the buildup
of poisons is considerebly reduced'by as. removal. -

Details of the nuclear calculations pertinent to this design gstudy

are presented in & subsequent section of this chapter.

Another reactivity calculation was performed to estimate the effect of

This resulted in & gain in reactivity, §k/k, of 0.39%. The Cornpone

Neutron and Gemma-Ray Activity in the Secondary Hee.t Exchanger of the
Interim Design Reactor. The present specifications for the Interim
Design Reactor call for the use of sodium es the heat transfer fluld in
the first intermediate heat exchenge loop that links the reactor to the
steam system, There are several disadvantages in the use of sodium,
among which are its flammability, incompatibility with the fuel salt
(uranium is reduced and may precipitete), end e 15<hr halfelife, high-
level, beta-and-gamms activity that is induced by exposure of the sodium
to delayed neutrons in the pr:lmarj heat exchanger.

The ugse of the non-uranixm—bearing salt mixture LiF-BeF, (63-37
mole %) in the first intermediate logp as an alternative to the sodium
has accordingly been studied. This salt is an excellent heat transfer
medium; it is compatible with the fuel; and it is nonflammeble. The
nature and smount of the induced radiocactivity comld therefore be the
decisive factor in the choice between the ealt and the sodium.

A Cornpone calculation wag made in which the neutron capture and
leakage parameters for the primary heat exchanger treated as a subcritical
reactor were estimeted, This calculation vas followed by a Sorghum

 

hliiolten-Sa.lt Reactor Program Status Report s P 179, ORNL-263L

(Yov. 12, 1958).

calculstion in which the spectra of the four main*sroups of delayed
neutrons were used separately to estimate the distrfbution of the captures
of these neutrons in fuel, metal, and coolant. With these data, an MIT
Practice School group estimated the neutron and gamma-ray activity to be
expected in the secondary heat exchang:er.5 Their results are summarized
in Tsble 1.1.2. It may be seen that the gamma-ray dose from the molten-
selt coolant is only one~half that expected from the sodium. Further,
the decay rate in the salt is orders of magnitude greater. It was
estimated that following cessation of circulation of the coolant it would
reguire about two weeks for the activity of the sodium system to reach

g level of 7.5 mr/hr, whereas the salt system would reach this level in

5 to 10 min. ' :

The possibility that neutrons might be generated in the secondary
heat exchanger by 7y-n reactions was investigated by the MIT group. The
sodium would not produce any neutrons, but the possibility that the 1.63-
Mev'gamma ray from F20 might lie sufficiently close to the threshold of
the 7-n reaction in Be9 to produce a significant neutron activity was
studied carefuliy. It was concluded that, on the basis of presontly
available data, no appreciable neutron activity need be expected.

Effect of Ion~Exchange Processing of Rare-Earth Fission Products on
Performance of Tnterim Design Reactor. The present specifications of the
interim design reactor call for processing of the fuel salt {600 ft3) at
the rate of 1.6 ft3/day (600 ft3/yr) by the fluorlde-volatility process

resonance parameters, and the polsoning from 0.15 mole % CeF3 was
determined by means of a Cornpone calculation. The polsoning was
found to be negligible.

The long-term nuclear performance of_the,interim design reactor
with CeF3 processing was then gtudied by means of a Sorghum calculation.
A processing rate of 18 ft3/day'(600 fts/month) vas selected, and it
vas assumed that the fuel stream returning to the reactor system
contained negligible concentrations of high-cross-section fission
products. The'results of thercalculationware shown in Fig. 1.1.13,
where regeneration ratio, critical inventory, ahd:cumulative net burnup
are plotted vs time of operation-in years, and are compered with the
corresponding performaence of the same system utilizing the fluoride=-
volatility processing method.

It may be seen that the ion~exchange processing method gives
gubstantial improvements in performance. The average critical inventory
is sbout 50% less, and the cumulative net burnup is about 30% less.

The calculation did not take into account the poisoning from samarium
isotopes and non-rare-earth fission products that would not be
removed by this process. '

Multigroup Oracle Programs for Eeterogeneous-Reactor Computations.
The 31-group_0rac1e program Cornpone was modifiedito pernit evaluations
of heterogeneous reactors on & routine bagis. A pew boundsary option
providing for a zero net current of neutrons was»added, which penmits
the calculation: of an infinitely 1ong unit cell in an infinite lattice
| in cylindrical geometry.- A subprogram was‘added,to compute, for each
',neutron group, the ratio of the average flux in the fuel region to
'the average flux in the cell, and the ratio of the average flux in the
moderator to the average flux in the cell. These ratios were designated ,
- "group disadvantage factors" for fuel and.moderator regions, respeotively.

The disadxantage factors were then applied in a calculation of
"finite, homogeneized" resctors. Fuel and moderator materials were

The diameter of the equivelent spherical core and the thickneéses of
core vessel, blanket, reflector, etc., were specified, as usual. A |
subprogram was added by‘moans of which the cross sections of the fuel
and moderator materiasls were then multiplied groupwise by the appropriate
disadvantage factors. From that point the calculation proceeds in

-the usual manner.

The modified program was tested by computing the multiplication
constant for the ORNL Graphite Reactor. ‘Croés sections for U238 metel
were estimated by taking into account resonance saturation and Doppler
broadening. Neutron eﬂérgies’ranged'down to 0.079 ev, the thermal energy
(1180°F) in the molten-salt reactors. Cross sections for alumimum were
alsO'added. With the use of specifications given by Ramsey and Cagle,7
k wvas estimated to be 0.967 for the reactor at 1180°F. This value appears
to be reasonably correct. Fufther calculations to permit estimation
of the multiplication at the operating “temperature (350°F) are planned. .
Cross sections for U23 in e mixture containing 70 mole ¢ IiF, 10 mole %
BeF,, and 20 mole % UF, wvere computed and added to the cross-section
library.

With the use of the new code and the previously calculated cross
sectlons for various ThFh melts;-severél uranium dnd thorium cycle
reactors were computed, as described in subsequent sections of this

chapteér.

In order to ‘study the long~term behavior of heterogeneous reactors,

 the Oracle program Sorghum'was modified¢ Provisien for absorption of
'['neutrons by graphite wasg made, and group disadvantage factors derived
| from the modified Cornpone program were applied separately to fuel and

graphite. The fission product Sm.hg was treated separately from the

.other fission products. For evaluating plutonium converters, the

exlsting program was modified to compute ingrowth of Puako, Puahl, and

Puahe, in place of Pa233, U233, and U231+. |

The modified program works well with bare and blanketed reactors,
but the critieal calculation was found to be unstable in the case. of
graphite-reflected reactors. In the reactor model embodied in Sorghum,
the net 1eakage- in each group is assumed to be proportional to the
space-avera.ged flux in the' corresponding group. This is & reasonadly
good approiimation in bare and blanketed reactors in which the slowing
dowvn in the second region is small, and the net leakage ln any given
group is nearly independent of the leaskage in groups of higher energy.
In graphite-reflected reactors, however, this approximation is not
good. Two cases- of graphite»modera'bed reactors have been studied for
periods of up to ten years by means of the modified program described
in subsequent sections of this chapter. '

Oracle Program GHIMSR for Gamme-Heating Calculations. A code was
written fo expedite gamma-heating calculations, in which an integral-
spectrum method is used to calculate the heating in a spherical reactor
system. GCamma-energy absorption coefficients for 12 groups are stored
and used to obtain average absorption coefficients for the reactor and

 

core vessel.

The necessary inputs:for the calculations include the radius of
the reactor, the care and core vessel compositions, and gamms sOurcé
distributions in space and energy. The time of computation for one
gsource is approximately 3 min. The program was checked against hand
computations and was found to be performing satisfactorily.

to estimate the initial nuclear performance of the graphite-—modgrate"d,

thick. Fuel channels 3.6 in. in diemeter penetrate the core and
are arranged in a square array measuring 8 in. between centers. The
fuel solution is LiF-BeFQ-UF (70-10-20 mole %), and the calculation
indicated that a fuel enrichment of 1.3 mole % is required to make
the system critical. | |

The slowing-down, leakage, and disadvantage parameters obtained
from the Cornpone calculation were used in a Sorghum calculation to
study the long-term nuclear performance of the system without fuel
processing. An extract from the results is given in Table l.l.3,
and key parameters are graphed in Fig. l.l.lk. : |

The accumulation of fission products progressively poisons the
reactor. The regeneration ratio, initially 0.79, falls steadily to
0.5 after T200 megawatt years (Mwy) of cumulative pcwer gencration.
The critical inventory falls, at first, because of the ingrowth of
plutonium isotopes, but it then rises steadily from an initial value

_ of about 1000 kg to about 4500 kg. The cumulative net burnup amounts

to about 1500 kg in T200 Mwy; the enrichment of the fuel added varies,
but avereges 60% during the first five years.

The cost figures given in ref 2 were calculated on the basis of
& one~group nuclear calculation3 in which progressive hardening of

x'the neutrcn spectrum'was ignored. Revised cost estimates based on

of the system was étudied by means of the Oracle program Sorghum.
An extract from the calculations is given in Table l.l.k.

For a cumulative power generation of 7200 Mwy, the critical
inventory rose to 1416 kg, and the cumulative net burnup amounted to
1683 kg. This performance is substantislly better than that exhibited
by the corresponding low=-enrichment éystem, which required an inventory
of 14386 kg and had & cumulative net burnup of 1400 kg. The disparity
betweéh the two systems is expected to increase with time.

Initisl Nuclear Performance of One-Region, GraphiteeModerated,
Graphite-Reflected, Th?aE-Conwersion, Molten-Salt Reactor. The initial
nuclear characteristics of a heterogeneous, graphite-moderated
and -reflected, one-region, molten-éalt reactor were studied.  The
redctor considered in the calculations consists of a cylindrieal core,
15 £t in diameter and 15 £t high, surrounded by & 2.5-ftethick graphite

" reflector contained in a l-in.-thick INOR-8 pressure shell. The core

is penetrated by cylindrical fuel passages arranged on an 8-in.
triangular lattice parallel to the core axis. The resulting unit cells
are hexagonal and 15 ft long. This system has not been optimized,

- and & much better design might conceivably be evolved. The initial

nuclear characteristics of the system are compared in Tables l.1l.5 and
1.1.6 with the characteristics of the interim design reactor.

The modified Oracle program Cornpone vas used to calculate k and
group disadvantage factors for the fuel and graphiteQ These results
were then used for complete reactor calculations in spherical geometry
of & core having the same volume as the actual cylindrical core. Mean
"homogeneized" deﬁsities'(atdms/cm3) were used for each element.

It may be seen that the regeneration ratip of the heterogeneous
reactor is more favorable than that of the interinr design reactor. The
initial critical inventory of U-”, on the other hand, is 60% higher than
in the interim design reactor. It is estimated that a power level of
760 Mw (th) can be attained in the heterogeneous system compared with
600 Mv (th) in the homogeneous reactor. | . Q_J

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOFMENT AND TESTING
'SALT-LUBRICATED BEARINGS FOR FUEL PUMPS

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings. The fourth test of a salt-lubricated
hydrodynamic bearing was completed and terminated on schedule after 1000
‘br of operation. The test was performed with salt No. 130-- (I.iF-BeFa-tI}?-‘h
62-37-1 mole %) under steady-state conditions. temperature ’ 1200 F 3 '
Journal speed, 1200 rpm; bearing redial. load, 200 1lb. Postrun exemination
reveeled that slight rubbing had occurred between the bearing end journal.
Since this test bearing was started and stopped only a very few times
as compared with the bearing which was tested previously and started and
stopped 87 times (rather than 94 times, as reported erronecously in the
previous report ) during a total operating time of 784 hr, it appears
that the rubbing marks may not be attributed entirely to starting and
stopping operations. Wear on the journal bearing used in the fourth test
appears to be slightly less than on the Journal bearing which was
subJected to 87 starts and stops. ‘

A £ifth test of 360 hr duration, for which new bearing and Jjournal
parts fabricated of INOR-8 were used, was also completed. Salt No. 130
wvas used as the lubricant and the system wag maintained at lQObOF. The
| ,journsl speed and bearing radisl load were varied over wide ranges (600
to 2700 rpm and 0 to 500 1b, respectively) Thirty combinations of speed
and load were applied for periods of 2 hr each. There were no difficulties
observed during these tests. Postrun exs.mination of the bearing revealed |
that slight ru'bbing occurred between the bearing and joursel.

A sixth test with the bearing and Journal used in the fifth test
is uﬁder way to investigate bearing performance at;steady-stete conditions
of journal speed and bearing radial load (1200 rpm and 200 1b) and at
temperatures varying in 50°F intervals from 1200 to lBOO?F. Bearing
performance is being observed for 4 hr at each temperature level.

All these tests have been performed with a radial cleeﬁance of 0.005
in; between the bearing and Jourhal surfaces, as measured at rcom tempera-
ture. The continuing analytical studies and surveys cf recent literatcre
Indicate that it may be possible to improve the performance of this
bearing by increasing the clearance to, 0.007 in. |

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings. Construction of a thrust-bearing
tester is approximately-BO% complete. The tester shown schematically
in Fig. 1;2.1, utilizes & PK type of centrifugal pump (without impeller)
that was modified in the impeller region to permit installation of the
test thrust bearing. The tester includes provisions for varying bearing
load, Jjournal speed, and test temperature. The thrust ruhner is mounted
on the lower end of the pump shaft and the stationafy member of the thrust
bearing is supported by a load actuator. The load actuator consists of
two concentric bellows_with common end flanges. Preesure applied
internally to the bellows assembly results in an axisl force (design
maximum, 500 1b at 1200°F) applied to the thrust bearing. The first
bearing 1o be investigated'will.be of the etep type S .

Tbst Pump Eguipped.with a Saltdebricated Journal Bearing. A PK
type of centrifugal pump is being modified to include a mclten-salt-

,lubricated Journal bearing near the impeller, an upper bearing (both

rfradial.and thrust) lubricated either with oil or grease, and an’ overhnng
B ’drive motor. The molten«saltulubricated'bearing will be tested through
I lthe full scope of loadings and clearance problems existing in a pump

operating at high temperatures.'_'}"

Hydrostatic Bearings. The previously described? water tests of
hydrostatic bearings were completed and a report describing the tests
and giving the results is being preparéd.3 The final test, for which
the bearing radial clearance was 0.005 in., was made at various speeds
with various system flow resistances. Postrun examination revealed that
slight rubbing occurred between the bearing and Journal. Further work
with this type of bearing (and also with rotating-pocket hydrostatic
bearings) has been deferred because of ‘the favorable results being
dbtained'with the less complicated hydrodynamic type of Jjournal bearings
and the increased emphasis on thrust~bearing testing. -

Bearing Mountings. Investigations of bearing mounts to accommodate
dimensional changes resulting from differences in coefficients of
expansion of the bearing and mounting materials have been de-~emphasized
because of the favorable results being obtained with the use of INOR-8
for joqrnal, sleeve, and mount. Promising technigues have not yet been
found.: The "Thermoflex" Journal bearing mounts designed by Westinghouse
Electric Manufacturing Company are not yet available in the sizes of

interest.

for 5 min to replace the tachometer generator on the drive motor., The
third stop was of 8 min duration to replace drive-motor brushes.

 

 

The small frozen-lead pump sesl being tested on & 3/16-in.-dia shaft,
es described previously;g has operated continuously since it started
operation on June 13, 1958. As of January 1, 1959 the accumulated
operating time was 4BLO hr. Following slight leakage of lead during the
first 100 hr of operation, there has been no further leakage.

A large frozen-lead seal on a 3 1/h-in.-dia rotating shaft has been

placed in operation. The frozen-lead seal retains molten lead at a

temperature of approximately 1000°F in a tank. The test equipment is
shown in Figs. 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. The three separate cooling coils used to
maintein the lead below its melting point in the bottom of the sealing
gland are shown in Fig. 1l.2.k. Thermocouples, located between the cooling
coils, may also be seen in Fig. 1.2.k.

The shaft is mounted in two self-aligning, pillow-block bearings
ettached to the gupport frame. A 10-hp Louis Allis motor and magnetic
clutch are connected to the bottom end of the shaft through an adjustable
coupling. |

As may'be seen in Fig._1.2.2, the sealing gland incorporates a long,
tapered annulus, which narrows to provide a clearance between the shaft

-_and the eealing gland of a few thousandths of an inch. The upper end of
| :_ethe ghaft rotates 1n the lead tank. ‘An inert atmosphere of argon at

in each of the three cooling coils can be oontrolled separately. The
supply pressures of watef and air are maintained at constant levels.,

In preparation for filling with lead, the equipment was heated to
operating temperature. With the shaft rotating-at 100 rpm, the tank was
filled with 120 1b of lead at 1600°F. At the present time, the shaft
is being run at 1300 rpm. The corresponding peripheral speed of the shaft’
is 1100 fpm, which is about 10 times the peripheral speed of the 3/16-in,=
dis shaft operating in the small frozen-lead seal test. Water at a flow
rate of approximately 2 gpm is being used as the coolant for the seal
gland. Smzll amounts of lead have leaked sporadically from the sealing
gland. | - |

TRIPEEX-TUBING HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

A eeveh-tubetest heat exchanger was designed (Fig, 1.2.8) with
which to evaluate the triplex heat exchanger tubing being developed-'
by the Metallurgy Division for molten-salt or liquid metai-to¥steem |
superheater applications. The triplex tubing conslsts of inner and
outer tubes with sintered metal powder or wire mesh in the ennulus between
them. This tubing was designed to provide positive separation of fluids»
witﬁ‘minimum thermel resistance between the inner and outer tubes and to
provide a means of leak detection in that the pressure‘of a gﬁs oceupying
the voids in the sintered metal in the annulus could be monitered.
Details of the tube development progrem are included in Chsp, 2.1 of
this report. |

DESIGN, CONSTRUC?IOE} AND OPERATION OF MATERJALS TESTING LOOPS

Forced=Circulation Loops. The operation of forced-circulation
corrosion-testing loops was continued. Three new loops were gtarted and
one loop was terminated, on schedule, during the qusrter. By the end
of October, the 15 forcedecirculation loop test stands were operating
at full capacity. Eleven of the facilities occupying five column bays
of Bldg. 9201-3 may be seen in Fig. 1.2.11. The remaining four loops
are located t0 the right and across the aisle from the area shown.

Two of the three new loops started during the guarter were constructed
of INOR-8 and the other was constructed of Inconel. One INOR-8 loop and
one Inconel loop (designated MSRP-lE and 9377-5, respectively, in the
operatidns summary, Table 1.2,3) were equipped with 2 molten-galt
sampling device,l7-which makes possible the removal of samples during
.operation. The results of analyses of the 57 samples that have been
removed from thgée two lobﬁs are presented in ChapQ'E.a of this report.

provided with the necessary equipment assumed isothermal operation
automatically, and steps were taken to prevent freeze-ups of the
remaining semiprotected loops. All loops were retnrned to test
conditions with no adverse effects and with a minimum of lost time.

The preventive maintenance program on the corrosion-testing
facilities requires that the loops be operated isothermally when it is
necegsary to repair or replacé>worn'or defective equipment. Such events
are listed in Table 1.2. 3 under comments only if it was necessary to
drain the operating fluid into the system sump.or to change the operating
fluid when a system was opened.

In-Pile Loops. Operation of the first in-pile loop was started in
the MIR December 3,31958. The loop operated satisfactorily at design
conditions until January 8, 1959 (nearly two MTR cycles) when a high
radiationvfield accompanied by fission-gas release developed in the
vieinity of the cubicle containing the loop. Loop operation was.
tenminated. The radiation releasefhas been traced to a partially
plugged pump=-sump purge-outlet line which caused fission gases to back-
diffuse up the pump-sump purge-inlet line to a point outside the cubicle,
where they escaped through a leak. The loop had=accumulated a total of
860 hr of operation, of which epproximately TOO hr were with the reactor
at power.

- The operation of the second ptototype in-pile pump was terminated
after 2500 hr of satisfac*co-rjopefaﬁon at the design conditions of the
first loop. Examination showed the pump to be in the as-installed -
condition, except for an accumulation of salt in the intermediate region
between the pump sump and bearing-housing region. The accumulation had
been Observed'by x~ray examination during operation of the pump, but it

: was considered to be of insufficient quantity to cause difficulty.

The third prototype in-pile pump, which is stilil being tested, has

_accumulated over 2000 hr of satisfactory operation. This pump is identical
‘o that installed in the second inepile loop and incorporates means to |

eliminate salt accumulation in the intermediate region. X-ray

exeminations of the operating pump have verified the effectiveness of
the modification. | ! S

The assembly of the second inepile loop is approximately 60%
complete. This loop will incorporate modifications to the purge system
which should prevent a recurrence of the diffj.culty encountered with
the first loop. " |

Viscosity. Viscometers of the gravity-flow capillary-efflux type,
which have been employed almost routinely in determinastions of the

'viscosities of molten-salt.mixtures,l have recently given unexpectedly

irregular results2 for beryllium~-containing fluoride mixtures. Efforts
to increase the experimental precision of the data have led to'modification;
both in the efflux-cup design and in the cup calibration technique.

The design of the modified efflux-cup viscometer is illustrated in
Fig. l.3.1. It differs from previous designs in tﬁo significant respects:
(1) the length of the cup was increaéed to provide either 120 or 240%
more fluid volume, and (2) a serrated "skirt" was added to the lower
outside portion of the cup; The first of these changes allowed longer
flow times and diminished the effect of initial surface "humping," and the
second change assured that drainage along the outside surface did not
interfere with the discharge from the capillary tube.

The new cups were calibrated with a NaNOQ-NaN03AKNO (40=T7=53 wt %)
mixture of known viscosity.S In the temperature range 150 to 400°C,
this salt basg & kinematic viscosity that is in the same range as’

the kinematic viscosities of the fluoride salts at 500 to 800°c.

Thermal-Convection Loop Tests. Examinations of two Inconel. thefmal-
convection loops that operated.with fused fluoride mixtures for one year .
at 1350°F were completed during the quarter. One of the 1oops (1181) vhich
circulated a blanket salt of the composition LiF-ThF (71-29 mole %),
showed attack in‘the form of subsurface voids to a depth of 6.5 mils along
hot-leg sections. No attack or deposits were observed in cold-leg sections.
The other loop (1184) which eirculated the fuel mixture NaF-Zth-UFh
(55.3-40.7-k mole %), was similarly attacked to a depth of 7 mils and
showed no attack or dep031ts_in.coldnleg,sections.

A third Inconel loop (1223) was examined after completing 1000 hr
of operatiop at1350°F with the fuel mixture LiFfBeFé-UFL. Attack in
this loop occurred as light intergranular void formation to a maximum
depth of 1 mil. The fuel mixture circulated in this loop was obtained
from the same batch as a mixture circulated in loop 1222, described
previously. However, prior to operation in loop 1223, an analysis of the
fuel was made to detect sulfur contamination. In the course of this
analysig, the fuel,gﬁhile molten, was purged extensively with HF and
hydrogen es. No measurable sulfur contamination was found, and, in
general, the impurity conoentrations appeared to be unaffected.by this
treatment.. However,*the as-received fuel oaused heavy attack to a depth ,
of 3 mils in loop 1222 under conditions otherwise identical to those of

lpop~1223. An effect of the purging treatment on the corrosiveness of

the fuel is therefore evident, but the mechanism th.rough which this effect
occurred has not been ldentified.,

Operation of an Inconel thermal-convection loop with the salt
mixture NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46.5-42 mole %) was terminated after 4673 hr in
order to provide additional test space for salts of currently greater
program interest. The maximum operating temperature of the loop was
1250°F. Examinetion of this loop (121h) revealed extensive attack along
hot-leg sections to a depth of 13 mils, but the cold-leg sections showed
no evidence of mass transfer. Chemical analysis of the salt after the
test showed a significant increase in the chromium content compared'ﬁith
that found by analysis prior to the test. | |

The occurrence of such gross attack in the absence of observable
mags 'l".-i‘ansfer strongly indicated that the fuel became con'i_:amimteﬂ. either
pr:lor to or subseguent to introduction into the loop. The high chromium
concentration was unexpected because there was no UFh in the salt. A
,subsequent check of the salt by petrographic and x-ray analyses revealed
the presence of approximately 15% KF-ZHEO. The presence of this
constituent suggests that water, a highly oxidizing impurity in the
fluoride systems, was introduced into the salt at some point before or
during the test and was responsible for the extensive attack.

Forced-Circulation Loop Tests. The status of the forced-circulation
loops now in operation with fluoride salts is presented in Chap. 1.2; no
tests were completed during the quarter. |

carburize Inconel and INOR-B by exposure for 4000 hr at 1200 °F. The

test procedures and apparatus were described previously. Roome
temperature mechanical tests show that the tensile strength and elongation
of the carburized INOR-8 decreased (~6.5% and 59%, respectively) in
comparison with the tensile strength and elongation of the control
specimens., The control specimens were subjected to an argon atmosphere
fof the same time and at the same temperature thét the carburized
specimens were exposed to the sodium-graphite system. The tensile and
yield strengths of the carburized Inconel specimens increased (~24% and
9%, respectively), while the elongation decreased, in coﬁpariSon with thé

~same properties of Inconel control specimens. Carburization was found

metallographically .to a depth of about 7 mils on both metals. Chemical
analyses of the carburized specimens of both Inconel and INOR-B showed
decreasing carbon content with depth as indicated in Teble 2.1. 1. _The

Ura.nium Precipita.tion From Fused eFluorid.e Salts in Contact with
f phite. - Tests were continued in the study of the’ compatibility of
| graphite and molten-salt fuel mixtures. As described previously,
the test systems are radiographed periodically to check for U0,
precipitstion from the fuel mixture and penetration of the fuel into the
sraphite. S . ..

Uranium oxide precipitation has been :f'ound in all tests in which
the fuel mixture 130 has been used in contact with gr.'aphite et 1300 F.h
In these tests the ratio of the calculated projected surface area of the
gra.ph.ite to the volume of the fuel was 9.6:1. The fraction of the
uranium that precipitates from fuel 130 appears to be finite and.
cOmplete within & 5=hr exposure to graphite at 1300°F under a vacuum of
1ess tha.n 0.1 /u The basis for the conclusion that the precipitation is
finite is that no detectable changes in the initial quantities of
precipitate heve been seen radiographically in any of the test systems,
even after exposures as long as 3000 hr.

The quantity of uranilm precipitated appears to 'be an indirect
- function of the purity of the graphite; that is, the grea.t,e;st_ quantities
of pre‘cipi'tsted uranium are found in the test systems containing the
most impure 'grephite. The impurities in the graphite are traces of
metals, and since the- s.dsorptive qualities of graphite are increased and
degassing is ms.de more difficult by metallic contamins.nts, it is believed
that the o:xygen source for the uranium precipitation Was a.dsorbed to a
greater extent on the 1ess pure graphite . :

The graphites used in the test systems in which ura.nimn precipitetion
has ‘been i’ound were degassed e.t 2350 Op for 5 hr under & vecuum of less
than h/-l § ,fJ_.ood.ed with argon, and then exposed- to air for 3 min while they

for the graphite to pick up enough contamination to cause the uranium
precipitation. In contrast to the results being obtained for fuel 130,
no segregation or precipitation has been found radiographically'when‘fuei

under a vacuum of less than 0 1/1 for 3000 hr or. longer.

In the tests under way, steps are being taken to determine definitely
whether graphite'is directly or indirectly responsible for uraniun
precipitation from fuel 130 under'these,conditions. Since, on the basis
of the preltminary:results,{graphite does-eppear to be responsible,
attempts are being msde to-determine whether the precipitetion can be _
eliminated by using purer graphite and/or by purging the graphite with gas
or liquid prior to exposure to fuel 130. :

'*mcmmc;\:t. PROPERTIES OF “INOR-8

Fabricability and corrosion\resistance to fused salts are perhaps

the most importent requirements for a structural material for the ,
molten-salt reactor, but the high~temperature strength of the material
:is also important from a des1gn-standpoint. The INOR-8 alloy presently

being considered as the structural material for the molten-salt reactor

system'was developed principally to possess corrosion resistance, it -

is presently'being studied from the standpoint of its strength properties.
Tests are under way in which tensile strength, Creep, relaxation, and
fatigue effeots are being evaluated.~ This testing program has two

-objectives.‘ first to obtein reliable data sultaeble for use in design
:engineering, and, second, to explore many of the factors, other than

stress and temperature, which may affect the strength prOperties. S

Tensile and creep data obtained in air were presented previously§’7r
which indicated that the strength of INOR-8 approaches that’of the
strongest stainless steels. Tests to determine the creep strength of
INOR+8 in molten salts are under way. Times to 1% strain as a function
of temperature and stress in short-time tests were presented previously,,
and long~time tests are in progress at 1100 and 1200 °F, Specimens
stressed at 25,000 psi at 1100°F have not yet reached 1% creep strain
even after 6000 hr. |

The results obtained'by ORNL in molten galts were compared'with
results dbtained by the Haynes Stellite Company in air in the previous
report,7 but differences in the heat treatment of the specimens prevented

'any‘conolusions.from_being dresm with respect to the relative effects

Tensilé data available for INOR-8 show that the ductility decreases
rapidly'witp increasing temperature between 1000 and 1500 F. ‘For example,
'elongations ranging from 15 to 30% have: been found at 1h00°F whereas,
at 10009F,:therductility may'be as high as 60%. Since 1ow ductilities
‘are sométimes associated with notch sensitivity, several tensile tests
vere conducted in order to establish the notched~to-unnotched strength
ratio. A ratio greater than unlty is considered to indicate notch
strengthening,‘while e ratio 1ess then hnity signlfies notch sensitivity.-

18 in. lohg, were prepared by temping and vibrating Inconel powder into
‘the 0.125-in. annulus between two Inconel tubes and sintering for 2 hr
at 2250°F in a hydrogen atmospheres. A density of about 50% of theoretical
was achieved in the sintered material in the annuli of the tubes, and
x=-ray examination showed the bonding to be unsatisfactory. One sémple
was subsequently drawn from 1.000 in. OD to 0.875 in. OD and resintered.
This tube was found by x-ray and metellographic inspections to have
agooa bondiﬁg; & density of 75% was achieved in the siptered.material |
in the annulus. Evaluation tests of these tubes by the Reactor Projects
Division have shown the tube with 50% dense sintered material in the
annulus to have & low permeability for helium and the permesbility of
the T5% dense material to be a factor of 100 less.

In order to obtain good thermal conductivity'across the annulus,
attempts have been made to fabricate tubes with porous nickel rather
than Inconel in the annulus. Preliminary studies of the sintering
characteristics of -325 mesh and -100 +200 mesh nickel powder after
tamping and sintering over the temperature range of 1800 to 2300°F showed
the latter particle-size powder to be the more promising for use in the
core. The'finer.powder, =325 mesh, was subject to gross shrinkage when
sintered'within the indicated‘temperature range. The first triplex
tube assembled with -100 +200 mesh nickel powder in the annulus was
sintered‘l‘hr at 2100°F, drawn from 1.000 in. OD to 0.875 in« OD, and
resintered 1 hr at 2100°F. In order to maintain reducing conditions
within the annulus, the tube was continually purged with hydrogen'during
sintering. Upon metallographic examination of the tube, however, -oxide
layers were found at the interfaces between the sintered material and
tubing. A second triplex tube assembled in the same manner as the first
was evacuated to 0.1 #, sintered for 1 hr at 2100°F, drawn from 1.000
in. OD to 0.938 in. OD, and resintered for 1 hr at 2100°F. Again it
was found +that poor bonds were formed between the tubing and +the sintered
_material and that oxides were present at the interfaces. The difficulties

oxygen contamination of the nickel powder.
Prefabricated porous materials available from opmmercisl vendors
are to be used-ih.future attempts to prepare triplex tubing.
High«Temperature Stability of INOR-8, Embrittlement studies of

- INOR-8 in the ﬁemperature range 1000 and 1400°F are in progress. In

these studies the changes in the tensile properties of annealed sheet
are being determined at various aging times and temperatures. In the
tensile tests completed thus far, specimens aged for 5000 hr have shown
no significant differences from the annealed specimens. épecimsns being
aged for 10,000 hr have completed 9000 br of the heat treatment. |
Commercial Production of INOR-8. The fabrication qualities of
INOR-8 melted by the arc-cast method are being evaluated. The starting

‘metal was & standard air-melted heat which was forged into electrodes,

subsequently vacuum arc-me}ted, and again forged into extrusion billets.
The billets are scheduled to be pierced, extruded, end redrawn into
tubing. INOR~8 prepared by vacuum-induction melting produced extrusion
billets which were unsuitable for further processing because of large
center defects. Upon completion of the present study, INOR-8 will
have been produced by three processes, and a basis will have been established
for placing future orders.

Evaluations of Composites of INOR-B and Type 316 Stainless Steel.
The compatibility of INOR-B snd ty'_pe 316 stainless steel at high
temperatures is. being investigated. ‘The evaluation msthods include
measurements of the dlffusion penetratlon of the alloys into each other,
the idsntification of reaction 1syers, and measurements of the mechani-

p'csl properties. ‘The data accumulated thns far indicate that the alloys
'_are compatible at temperatures up to 1800 F. Composites of INOR~8 and

type 316 stainless steel therefore appear to be promislng for use in

WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES

'Heat Exchanger Fabrication. The welding and brazing problems
encountered in constructing a triplex-~tube heat exnhanger are being

.studied, and sultable fabrication procedures are being developed. The

basic design of such a heat exchanger consists of two tube sheets at
each end, with the outer tube wall of each tube welded to one tube

'sheet and the inner tube wall of each tube welded to the other tube

sheet. The space between the two tube’ sheets can thus be used for.
leak detection. A difficult access problem is encountered . in the
welding of'the outer tube walls to the first heeder, since conventional
welding torches are too bulky to fit between adjacent tubes.

For experimental velds, an extension was attached to & small
welding torch and a shielding-gas nozzle and a treiler shield were
msnnfectnred from pyrex glass. The tungsten electrode was bent at
an angle of 10 deg to permit placement of the eledtrode tip and, hence,
the cathode spot, over the tube-to-tube sheet interface.

These torch modifications required that the torch move around its
owvn axis, as well as around the tube axis, with identical periods of
rotation. A sketch showing the rotationsl movements required to make
the welds is presented in Fig. 2.1. 3 A mechanlsm was designed and
fabricated to permlt this complex rotational motion and a rotatlng
shielding-gas seal and current contact were enclosed in a suitable
assembly.

. A mockup heat exchanger was constructed to agsist in the develop-
ment of a welding procedure and to provide information and .experience
applicable to the construction of an actual unit. Simulated tubes

were eonstructed by separating individwal stainless steel and Inconel

tdbes'withrwlre spacers., The assemhly, vhich was welded and back

- brazed successfully, is shown in Fig. 2.1,4.

at elevated temperatures was substantially increased. A metallographic
examination indicated that considerable carbide spheroidization occurred
as & result of heat treating at 1500°F and above. The carbide spheroi-
dization may be seen in Fig. 2.1.5. The carbides io the as~welded INOR-8
wveld metal appeared to have pre,cipitated extensively along the grain
boundaries, as shown in Fig. 2.1.6. This spheroidization is thought to
be at least pertially responsible for the improvement in ductility_ at
1500°F after aging at 1500°F. The 1800°F treatment resulted in slightly
more spheroidizetion than is shown in Fig. 2.1.5. The microstructural
changﬁs rosulting from aging at 1200 and lSOOOF will be studied further
with the aid of the electron microscope.

Theee results indicated that the marginal elevated-temperature
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal in the as-welded condition might result
from an unfavorable carbide distribution, as well as from the influence
of trace elements in the 0.009 to 0.001 wt % renge, which are known to
cause "hot shortness" in nickel-base alloys. Special heats of INOR-8
wvere therefore prepared, as described below, in order to study each of

the above conditions.

Four different methods have been utilized thus far to deoxidize
and purify the weld filler metal during the casting of the origimal
ingot. These are: (1) use of Inconel weld wire (Inco. No. 62) as the
source of most of the nickel, chromium, and iron, (2) use of nickel
weld wire (Inco. No. 61) as the source of 81l the nickel, (3) addition
of an aluminmn-titanium-manganese master alloy to purify the melt
(process recommended by‘Electro Mstallurgioal Company), and (4) additions

, Eof aluminnm, titanium, manganese, silicon, boron, and magnesium to
f:purify ths mslt (as recommended'by International Nickel company) The
results obtained to date on as-deposited INOR~8 are shown in Table 2.1. 6.

As may be seen in Table 2.1.6, all the methods described above for
deoxidizing and purifying the ingot have shown promising reSuits. The
ductility at 1500°F has been increased from an average valué'of 7%'t9
13 to ;5%. Other modifications in melting practice will be investigated
in an effort to obtain a ductility at 1500°F of 20%.

In order to determine the influence of carbon content on the duc-
tiiity, vacuum-induction melts containing 0.00+%, 0.03%, and 0.06%
carbon were made, fabricated into weld wire, and deposited as weld
metal. The_results of the all-weld-metal tensile tests of these SPecif
‘nens are summarized in Table 2.1.7. The date show that no increase in

high—temperature ductility was attained by decreasing the carbon'cOntent
of the INOR-8 veld deposit. Also, when mo carbon addition to the ingot
was made, the ductillty values at room temperature and at 1200°F were
seriously diminished. These poor ductilities are assumed to result
from & preponderance of grain-boundary films (probably oxides) These
films were of such a magnitude that graianoundary fissures were numerw
ous. The properties of lower~-carbon-content melts should'also be
investigated'when melted with improved practices of the type discussed

Welding of Dissimilar Metals. The problem of selecting a suitable filler
material for welding dissimilar metals has of‘ten been an obstacle in the
fabrication of various components. A dissimilar metal weld is composed
not only of filler metal, but substantial quantities of both of the base
materials being joined. The filler metal should thus have the following
properties: (1) high tolerance for dilution by elements such as iron,
nickel, chromium, and copper without forming brittle or crack-sensitive
alloys, (2) a moderate coefficient of thermal expansion, (3) sbility to
withstand high service temperatures over long periods of time without
suffering from harmful effects such as sigma-phase formation and carbon
migration, (4) good oxidation and corrosion resistance, and (5) godd
strength and ductility over the temperature ranges of interest.

The International Nickel Company has developed such a filler wire
for inertuarc welding of dissimilar metals, and the mechanical properties
have been studied and reported;9 The high titanium content of the wire
mekes it highly susceptible to age hardening at the molten-salt reactor
service temperature of 1200°F, and its application may, therefore, be .
limited. ,

A niobium-containing coated electrode, designated Inco Weld "A" |
electrode, wes also developed for the metallic-arc welding of dissimilar'
metals, and the mechanical properties were determined in both the as-
welded'and.as-aged conditions. ‘The'results of this study are shown

in Teble 2.1.8. As would be expected from the composition, the metallic-
arc weld deposits are not subject-to appreciable aging. The tensile
strength at room and elevated tempérétures is not appreciably altered,
and the ductility isnot7decreas§d. ItAthuS appears that this elecprodeA
might be useful for joining diseimilar metals for high-temperature

Joints brazed with copper exhibited no cracks after brazing, but’
numerous transverse and longitudinal cracks in the Jjoint were noted;on

all specimens which were cycled 15 times from 1206°F td room temper-

ature. It appears that the copper lacks adequate strength and ductility

at the elevated temperatures to accommodate the stresses built up in
thermal cycling.

The stronger, less ductile alléy, Au-Ni, was characterized by
longitudinal cracks along the Jjoint. In many cases, the molybdenum
base metal near the Joint was also cracked.

 Joints brazed with Coast Metals No. 52 alloy,-a strong, brittle
material, showed varied properties. In mbst sampies, only slight
cracking was observed after thermal cycling, while severe cracking
was noted in one sample. The fillets were subject toicracking in most
cases. |

Since Coast Metals Nc. 52 alloy appeared to be the most promising
of the three brazing alloys tested for this application, a prototype
punp shaft eand extension were constructed. The cqnditions of the
test unit will be limited, however, since some of the molybdenum fingers

the system NaF-BeF,-UF, by the Mound Laboratory.> The choice of NaP-BeF-
ThFh'mixtures for use in nuclear regctor-systems is limited to compositions

the effect of UF) substitution for ThF) in solid solutions (LiF--Th‘Fh

UFh’ LiF-BeFe-ThFh-UFh, NaF-‘I'hFh-UFh) have indicated that UFh substi-

to be lowered. It would appear, therefore, that the liquid temperatures
encountered in the system l\Ia.F--B»a}i'e--ThFr‘]+ represent maximum temperatureé

The System KF-LiF-BeF,. The possibility of using low-melting

reactors was studied. Such mixtures would be attractive because of
the lower gamma activity they'would have in camparison with similar
NaF-base mixtures after irradistion in a reactor.

Examinations of 12 melts from thermal analysis experiments by
the use of optical and x-ray techniques showed that the system KF-LiF~-

of molten-fluoride-salt reactor fuels. Attempts to precipitate UO,
Prom so_lu‘ticns of UF) (6.5 wt % U) in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) by
treatment with excess BeO have shown that the UFM content of the melt
decreases rapidly at first but that the precipitation rate becomes
very slow after about 30 min;lless than 40% of the UF) precipitates
in 3 hr. It is likely that the BeO becomes coated with UO2 and that
the reaction is effectively prevented. The surface area of the BeO
should, accordingly, prove to be an important varisble. '
Sparging such an incompletely reacted system with HF in an
attempt to redissolve the precipitated UO2 appeared to accelerate
the precipitation of UOE. In a typical experiment the UFh content
of the melt was reduced from 6.5% to L.L% U by 3 hr of contact with
excess BeO at 600°C and was further reduced to 2.9% U by 3 hr of
sparging with HF at this temperature. A possible explanation for
this behavior is that the HF is capable of exposing additional surface
area of the BeO pellets previously coated with insoluble UO2 and
thereby accelerating the reaction. An alternate and equally likely
explanation is that HF serves as an intermediate reactant which
reacts with BeO to produce Hzo and bring about preeipitation‘of_U02¢

CHEMISTRY OF THE CORROSION PROCESS

 

Activity Coefficients of CrF, in NaF~Zth. The activity coef-
ficients of the fluorides of structural metals such as chromium,
nickel, and iron dissolved in dilute solutions of molten fluoridés
are of interest to the understanding and prediction of corrosion
reactions taking place in systems in which molten fluorides are in
contact with alloys of these metals. The activity coefficients of

FeF,, and NiF, dissolved in molten NaF-ZrF) (53-47 mole %) were determined

and the activity coefficients determined at 8QO°C are reported here,
The study of the activity coefficients of CrF, in this solvent, as
originally planned, was concluded with these measurements.

The average equilibrium quotients and activity coefficients for

in Table 2.2.2 represent simply the arithmetic averages of the

the equilibria of possible mechanisms for the corrosion of metals by

The calculations indicate that aluminum chloride is probably
an attractive gaseous heat transfer medium and that it would require
very low pumping power. As & working fluid for a turbine, the relé,-
tively large difference of the specific volume of the gas at the

to & depth'of about 1 mil. No subsurface voids were observed. '

Further examination of the capsule after completion of the experi=
ment indicated that a cold spot was present on the capsule near the

on this cold spot could have resulted in increased corrosion of the

PERMEABILITY OF GRAPHITE BY MOLTEN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

Previous reports in this serieslh have described tests in which
reactor-grade graphite was impregnated by'exposing out-gessed specimens
to molten LiF-MgF2 or NaFa=LiF=KF mixtures at 1700°F for several hours
under inert gas at a pressure of about 20 psig. In order to ascertain
whether such treatment protects the graphite from penetration by reactor
fuel mixtures, 0.5~ and 1l.0~in.-dia specimens impregnated with the
salt mixture I_QiF.--.Mg'F2 (67.5-32.5 mole %; mp, 1350°F) were exposed at
1250°F for 800 hr to a typical fuel mixture, LiF-BeF,~UF), (62-37-1
mole %). |

No evidence of gains or 1osses in weight of the graphite specimens
resulted from exposure to the fuel mixture. However, chemical analyses
of successive 1/32-in. layers machined from the specimens indicete

that penetration of the fuel mixture had occurred. The beryllium concen-

tration of the successive layers decreased from 5000 ppm in the outer

layer to 2000 ppm in the center of the rod; the uranium concentration
similarly decreased from 3500 to 1000 ppm. These figures indicate that
nearly two-thirds of the LiF-MgF, in the outer layer of the specimen

was replaced by the fuel. The ratio of beryllium to uranium was eub-
stentially lower in the center of the graphite than in the fuel mixtures,
but 1t is evident that impregnating graphite with LiFémng will not
satisfactorily prevent the subsequent penetration by LiF-BeF -UFh mixtures.

EFFECTS OF THERMAL CYCLING ON SALT STABILITY

 

A series of tests was run with sealed nickel capsules to determine

 the effects on beryllium-containing salt mixtures of freezing and

remelting, without agitation. The mixtures LiF-BeF,-UF) (62-37-1 mole %),
Lir-BeFa-ThFh (71-16-13 mole %), and LiF-BeF,~ThF, -UF) (62+3645-1=0.5
mole %) were tested. In one set of experiments, the salts were held

at 1250°F under static conditions for 25, 100, and 500 hr. In another
set, the salts were’thermélly cycled five times from LOO to 850, 1000,
1200, and 1hOO°F, respectively. The maximum temperature of the cjcle

was held for 30 min before cooling was started. All tests were run in

duplicate.

Analyses of sectlons from the salts held at 1250°F for varying
periods of time ehowed no detectable change in composition. The salts
vhich were subjected to thermal cycllng showed however, definite
increases in uranium and/or thorium content in the bottom sections of

'the capsules, with a corresponding decrease in 1ithimm and beryllium

content. The degree of concentration of UFh or ThFh in the bottom sections

was greater at the 1ower maximum cycle temperatures. The semples taken

from the reaction of molten stannous fluoride with chromium metal.15
The container material needed for the reaction is "graphitite," an
expensive, low-porosity grade of graphite; stannous fluoride melts
leak through containers of ordinary graphite., If cadmium fluoride or

bismuth trifluoride is substituted for the stannous fluoride in the

reaction, comparable yields (over 90%) of chromous fluoride are obtained
in crucibles of ordinary graphite, Molten cupric fluoride and lead
fluoride also react with chromium metal to form chromous fluoride, but
the yields are lower, probably as a result of loss of material by leak-
age through graphite. Cadmium metal volatilizes from the charge when
CdF2 is used as the oxidant. When the other oxidants are used, the
salt and metal separate into well-defined layers.

Batches of less than 4O g of chromous fluoride are conveniently
prepared by maintsining chromic fluoride at 1100°C in a platinum or
graphite container for 4 hr. The yield of chromous fluoride is con-

sistent with the equation
3CﬁF3———>-2CrF2 + CrF5 .

Attempts to prepare large batches of CrF2 by the disproportionation
of CriF3 at 1100°C for a limited time, however, yield a product whose
composition is interm@diate betwggn CrF2 and CrFs.- This intermediate
fluoride'has_also'resu;ted fram'(l)partial reduction of ch3 by H,
and (2) partial oxidation of CrFafby'HF. It can epparently be prepared

in nearly pure form by treatment of CrF, with 8nF, or by reaction of

~Cr, CrCly, or CrCl, with an excess of SuF,. The yellowish green crystals

of this compound are biaxial negative and show a distinctive x-ray

Synthegis of Simple Fluorides by Reactions with Stennous Fluoride.
Stennous fluoride is also useful for synthésizing‘flquides of othe?'j |
metals in a low valence state. Molten stannous fluoride was reacted
with manganese, zinc, aluminum, iron, vansdium, and uranium to yield,
respectively, MhF ZnF,., AlF_, FeFa, VF3, and UFh“ The equation for

The manganous and zine fluorides prepared by this procedure were pure,
since the molten salt and the tin resulting in the reaction formed
well«defined layers which were easily separated. The reaction of the

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

A process for the recovery of the fuel and blanket éalts of a molten~
salt reactor 1s being developed that is based on the volatilization of
uranium as UF6 and on the appreciable solubility of LiF-BeF2 salts in
nearly anhydrous HF. Previously reported work indicated this procedure
to be generally applicable to molten~salt reactor systems employing
LiF-Q-BeFe-UFh or LiF-BeF,-UF) -ThF, salts. The process is particularly
promising in the degree of separation of the recovered LiF-BeF2 salt
from important rare-earth neutron poisons as a result of the general
insolubility of polyvalent-element fluorides in anhydrous HF. A |
tentative process flowsheet wag présen'bed previously.l

Studies of the behavior of neptunium, uranium, thorium, and
corrosion=product fluorides have heen made in further development work on
the HF salt~-dissolution process. The results appear to be consistent
with the proposed process flowsheet in that the recovered LiF-BeF2 salt

~would effectively be decontaminated from neptunium. Much further investi-

gation of some of the variables involved will be necessary, however,
before specific flowsheets for specific reactor designs can be _prepared.

contributed by all fission fragments. at that time.e

The solubility of neptunium in 80 to 100% HF solvents saturated

:with LiF and_BeF2 was found experimentally to be sufficiently low to

‘permit its removal along with the rare earths. In the experiments,
small quantities of neptunium (aqueous nitrate solution) were added

incrementally to HF splutions saturated with LiF and BeF2. The concen-
tration of nitrate added was approximately 0.02% of the fluoride salt
concentration. The obserﬁed solubilities of neptunium are reported

in Table 2.3.1 as milligrams of neptunium per gram of solution and s

with the neptunium to a considerable extent; the ratio of the amount of
plutonium in solution to the amount undissolved was within a factor of
2 of the ratio for neptunium although the plutonium concentration was
500 times smaller. | |
Additions of iron and nickel metal to the HF solutions resulted
in a significant reduction in the gross alpha activily, probably as the
result of reduction to neptunium (III) and to plutonium (III). The
reduction has not &et_been verified by neptunium pulse~helght analyses.
In the trivalent state, behavior somewhat similar to that of the rare
earths might be expected; the observed solubilities are in the same
range as those reported previously for rare earths. It is expected
that the rare earths, neptunium, plutonium, and, possibly, ura.nium will
behave eg a single group and will therefore exhibit lower solubilities
when present together than the values reported here for the separate

components.
SOLUBILITY OF CORROSION~PRODUCT FLUORIDES IN HF SOLVENT

Measurements were made of the solubilities of corrosion-product
fluorides (iron, chromium, and nickel) in HF solutions saturated with
LiF. Chromium fluoride was found to be relatively s0luble, with the
solubilities being about 8, 12 and. 18. mg of chromium per gram of
solution in 100, 95, and 90 W* % HF- solvenos, respectively. Iron end
nickel fluorides were found to be less solnble. The iron fluoride

8imilar messurements in 90 and 100 wt % HF solvents with no dissolved
salt gave values in the same range, but in the 80 wt % HF solvent the
iron and nickel solubilities appeared to be significantly higher.

'SOLUBILITIES OF URANIUM ARD THORIUM TETRAFLUORIDE IN EF SOLVENT

Measurements of the solubilities of thorium and uranium fluorides
in the HF solvents indicated that these fluorides are relatively insolu-
ble. All ThF) determinations gave less than 0.03 mg of thorium per
gram of solution, which is the limit of detection. Better analytical
methods gre'évailable for UFh’ and the solubility values were, in general,
in the range 0.005 to 0.010 mg of uranium per gram of solution. 1In the
presence of fresh iron or nickel metal, somewhat lower solubilities
(0.002 to 0.005) were observed, indicating, perhaps, a higher solubility
for higher oxidation states. | |
