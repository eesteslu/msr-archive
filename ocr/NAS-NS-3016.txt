FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radlochemistry is one of a number of
subcommittees working under the Committee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sciences - Natlonal Research
Council. Its members represent government, industrial, and
‘university laboratories in the areas of nuclear chemistry
and analytical chemistry.

The Subcommittee has concerned itself with those areas of
nuclear science which involve the chemist, such as the col-
lection and distribution of radiochemical procedures, the
egtablishment of specificatlons for radiochemically pure
reagents, the problems of stockpiling uncontaminated
materials, the availability of cyclotron time for service
irradiations, the place of radiochemistry in the undergraduate
college program, etc.

This serles of monographs has grown out of the need for up-
to-date compilatlons of radiochemical information and pro-
cedures.. e Subcommittee has endeavored to present a
series which will be of maximum use to the working sclentist
and which contains the latest avallable information. Each
monograph collects in one volume the pertinent information
required for radiochemlcal work with an individual element
or a group of closely related elements.

An expert in the radiochemlstry of the particular element
has written the monograph, following a standard format
developed by the Subcommittee. The Atomlc Energy Commis-
sion has sponsored the printing of the seriles.

The Subcommittee is confident these publications will be
useful not only to the radiochemist but also to the research
worker in other fields such as physics, biochemlstry or
medicine who wlshes to use radiochemical techniques to solve
a specific problem.

INTRODUCTION

This volume which deals with the radiochemistry of grot-
actinium is one of a series of monographs on radiochemistry
of the elements. There is included a review of the nuclear
and chemical features of particular interest to the radio-
chemist; a dlscussion of problems of dissolution of a sample
and counting techniques, and finally, a collectlon of radio-
chemical procedures for the element as found in the literature.

The series of monographs will cover all elements for which
radiochemical procedures are pertinent. Plans include
revislon of the monograph perlodically as new techniques and
procedures warrant. The reader is therefore encouraged to
call to the attention of the author any published or unpub-
lished material on the radiochemistry of protactinium which
might be included in a revised version of the monograph.

Any new review on protactinium at this time has been rendered
largely superfluous by the recent§publication of the critical
article by Haissinsky and Bouissieres!. This excellent
comprehensive monograph covers the published (and much of the
unpublished)literature through November 1, 1957. Except for
translation from the French, 1t can hardly be ilmproved upon.
Such a translation has been made;, and it is hoped that per-
mission for its general distribution will be granted by the
publisher in the near future. : '

The present regort has the limited objective of acquainting
the reader with the brecad outllines of protactinium chemistry,
especially in relation to methods of preparation, separation,
and analysis. The literature survey gas been limiteg to
materlal reported since about 1950; for the older literature,
the author ﬁas relled heavily on the Hailssinsky-Boulissieres
review. Critical comments, however, are those of this
writer. Patents, as such,; have been largely ignored, as in
the oplnion of the author, thelr significance is more legal
than sclentific. .

III. CHEMISTRY OF PROTACTINIUM

1. General

The only naturally occurring protactinium isotopes are prot-

actinium-231 and protactinium-234.

Because of their short
half-11ives, 1.2-minute protactinium-234 (UXp) and its 6.7-hour
isomer (UZ) ﬁre of relatively little interest to radiochemists.
The 27-day protactinium-233 is readily produced by neutron |
irradiation of thorium and is of considerable value both as

a tracer and as the parent of fissile uranium-233. Signifi-
cantly, the v-p branching ratio of UXp was determined with the

aid of protactinium-233 as a tracer.9

Al though the natural sbundance of protactinium is almost as
great as that of radium, the known world supply of the iso-
lated element and its compounds did not exceed one or two

grams until the late 1950's.

Interest in thorium breeder reactors gave necessary lmpetus
to the recovery of gram quantities of protactinium for study

of its macrochemistry. .

Abundant source material was avallable as a result of the
accelerated prodﬁction of uranium for nuclear reactors.
Chemical technology (solvent extraction) and Instrumentation
(scintillation spectrometers) had advanced to a point where
éeparations and analyses which were previously difficult or

impossible could be made with relative ease and rapidity.

Almost 100 grams of protactinium-231 was recently isolated
from uranium fefinery wastes In Great Britain, and groups at
Cambridge, Harwell, and elsewhere are actively engaged'in
studying the chemistry (as distinct from the radiochemistry)

of protactinium.
Dr. A. G. Maddock has kindly supplied this reviewer with an
unpublished report on the 1958 activities of the Cambridge
protaétinium grouplo, in which he describes the preparation,
in centigram quantities, of the penta- and tetrahalides of
protactinium and polarographlc studies of its oxalate,
chloride, fluoride, and sulfate solutions. These data will

be published shortly.

It is safe to predict that the 1960's will see much of the
mystery and wlitchcraft elimingted from protactinium chemistry.
Nevertheless, the greatest amount of information published to
date has come from work done with protactinium-233 on tracer

levels.

These data have not been consistently applicable to the
macrochemlstry of protactinium-231. To some extent, the
discrepancles are due to the origins of the isotopes. Prot-
actinium-233 1s likely to be contaminated 6n1y by thorlium.
Protactinium-231, on the other hand, may be contaminated
with any or all of the elements in groups IVa and Va of
the Period;c Table, as well as with phOSphate ion, which
tends to make its chemistry somewhat erratic. Furthermore,
radiochemical analysls of protactinium-231 is complicated

by thé presence of its own a-, B-, and y-active descendants

(Table I1) and those of uranium-238.

Protactinium-231 can also be produced by the neutron irradia-
tion of thorium-230 (ionium), in which case it will usually

also be dontaminated by thorium-232 and protactinium-233.

Too much has been made of the apparently capricious chemlcal

behavior of protactinium, In the pentévalent state, its

chemletry is similar to that of its homologues in graup'Va
of the Periodic Table. Like niobium and tantalum, prot-
actinium is almost completely insoluble in all the common
aqueous media except sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids. I*
18 readily precipitated by hydroxides and phosphates; and,
1n.trace quantities,.ia carried more or less quantitatively

by precipitates of a wide varlety of elements.

The well-publiclzed tendency of protactinium to deposlt on
the walls of glass vessels 1s primarily due to its insolubility;
this tendency 1s not apparent in appropriate concentrations of

gulfuric and hydrofluoric acids.

2, Metallic Protactinium

Metallic protactinium has been prepared by thermal decom-
position of 1ts halldes on a tungsten fllament and by
electron bombardment of the oxidell, by reduction of.the
tetrafluoride with barlum at 1400012. and by electrodeposi-.
tion on various metal cathodes from very dilute, slighflv
acid, fluoride solutionulB.

The metal is grey in color, malleable, and approximately as
hard as uranium. On exposure to air, it acquires a thin
pkin of PaO,

3. 8Soluble Salts of Protactinium

Nowhere 1s the literature of protactinium more confused or
ambiguous than in the refsrences to its solubility in common

mineral acids. The only asystematic study in this area is the
L4 with solution volumes of the

preliminary work of Thompson
order of 0,05 ml;_(Table I11). The avallablility of gram
quantities of protactinium makes this a potentially fertile

field for investlgation.

'The bast solvent for protactinium is hydrofluoric acid, which
rdndtly digsolves the ignited pentoxide and nearly all pre-
cipitates, forming the stable complex ion PaF7’.
Protactinium pentoxide disaolves slowly in hot concentrated
sulfuric acld, but the solubllity 1s low. Prolonged diges-
tion convarts the oxide to a sulfate, which dissolves on
dilution of the acid. |

A solution containing 17 mg./ml. of protactinium-231 in
approximately 7.7 N stou has been stable for over a year15,
and one contalning 36 mg./ml. in approximately 3 N D,S0, has
been stable for six monthslﬁ.

In the author's experience, only hydrofluoric and sulfurilec
acids permanently dissolve ‘appreciable quantities of prot-
actintuq. With all other mineral acilds, solutions are
unstable, resulting in precipitates or colloidal suspensions’

after periods ranging from a few hours to several weeks.

Solutiena containing 10~3 to 10'4 M protactinium in 6 M I-NOJ
(0.2 - 0.02 mg./ml.) hydrolyzed slowly, but, at concentra-
tions between 10-% and 10-7 M protactinium, the solutions
were sufficiently stable for 24 hours to ylald reproducible

extraction and ion exchange datal?.

solvent extraction and ion exchange of protactinium from

recent experlence, however, the values, which were
based on volumes of the order of 0.05 ml., are highly
questionable.

This table is included because it is
In the light of

HC1 solutions, no data other than Thompson's are given to

indicate the limits of solubllity.

The insoiubility of prot-

actinium in 6-8ﬂ HCl is useful as a method of separation from

decay products:

When the lodate preclpitate of protactinium

1s digested with concentrated HCl, the protactinium dissolves

temporarily, then reprecipitates quantitatively. After
digestion on a hot water bath and'centrifugation,;the'Suﬁer-
nate contains no detectable protactinium15°

Where an occaglonal reference occurs to solubllities of the
order of 1 mg./ﬁl. of profactinium in 6 N HCllB, it must be
regarded as questionable. When elaborate precautions are
taken to eliminate organic complexlng agents and fluoride
ion, the subsequeﬁt HC1l solutlons are unstable. A solution
containing 2 mg./ml. of protactinium, in 8 M HCLl was prepared
from a peroxlde precipitate, but, over a period of three

weeks, about 80 per cent of the protactinlum precipitﬁtedl9.

4. Insoluble Salts Useful in Separation and Analysis

The normal oxldation state of protactinlum is + 5, but prot-
actinium (V) probably does not exist in solution as a simple
cation. On reduction to protactinium (IV) [e.g., with zinc
amalgaml, the fluoride can be preclpitated and is insoluble
1n water and most acids. Tetravalent protactinium is slowly
oxidized 1n air to the pentavalent state, and the fluoride

redissolveszo.

Protactinium (V) can be precipitated from fluoride solution
by the addition of a stoichiometric amount of KF, which forms
an lnscluble double fluoride, KzPaF7. A double fluoride with

barium has also been reportele.

Alkall hydroxides and carbonates precipitate ﬁrotactinium in
both oxlidatlon states, and the precipltate 1ls not soluble in
excess 6f the reagent. Depending on the concentrations,
NH,0H mav fall to precipitate protactinium quantitatively

from fluoride solutionzz.

10
The phoéph#ﬁe'and hypophosphate of proﬁactinium cant be pre-
cipitated from acid solutions. It has been reported that the
preclpitate will not redissclve even in strong mineral aclds.
However,:the author has regularly redissolved protactinium
precipitated by phosphate, whether in trace amounts carried

by titanium or niobium, or in carrier-free milligram quantities,
The precipitate, upon dilgestion with a sufficlent quantity of
warm 18 N H;504 either dissolves or becomes soluble on dilu-

tion with HCl to which some H,0, has been added.

The phosphate can alsc be precipitated from fluoride solution,
depending upon the relative concentratione of the anions. If
excess phosphate is separated by f£iltration or centrifugation,

the protactinium is soluble in dilute HF.

Iodates precipitate both protactinium (IV) and protactinium
(V) from moderately acid solution {e.g., 5 N H,S0y). The precip-

ltate 1is gelatinous and velumlnous, but becomes more dense on

standing, especially if it is warmed on a water bath. Iodate
precipitation from acid solution provides excellent separation

from phosphate.

Sodium phenylarsenate precipitates protectinium in either
oxldation state; the gelatinous precipitate 1s readlly soluble
in dilute HFZO.

Dilution of a sulfuric acid solution of protactinium(V)
produces a preclpitate which redissolves in ammonium sul-
fate. Potasslum sulfate, however, ylelds a crystalline pre-

clpitate, probably a double sulfate.

Tartaric and citric aclds dissolye the hydroxides of both

protactinium(V) and protactinium(IV), and the solution 1s

11
stable on the addition of NHuoH. Sodium hydroxide precipl-
tates protactinium from a citrate, but not from a tartrate

_solution.

With Hy,0, in large excess, protactinium(V) fo:ms a precip}tate

which is insoluble in NH OH and NaOH. The precipitate is

Iy
soluble in dilute stou only after decomposition of the per-

oxide on a water bath.

Freshly precipitated protactinium hydroxide dissolved rdpidly
in warm aqueous oxallc acidza. Addition of NHQOH to 3 M H2C204
containing 0.15 mg./ml. of protactinlum resulted in peféistent
turbldity at pH 5-6, but precipitation ﬁas not éomplete until
pH 8-9 was reached. Addition of an equal volume of 1 N HC1

to the original oxalate solution had no effect in the cold,

but a white crystalline precipitate contalning approximately

90 per cent of the protactinium was formed in warm solutions.

This precipitate dissolved completely in 8 N HCl.

In general, protactinium(V) follows the chemistry of niobium,

while protactinium(IV) follows that of thorium.

5. Coprecipitation and Carrying of Protactinlum

Most methods for the recoverf of either protactinium-231 or
protactinium-233 rely, for an initial concentration step, on
the entrainment of protactinium by an insoluble carrier of
another element. From the foregoing discussion of insoluble
compounds of protacfinium, it follows that hydroxidé, carbon-
ate, or phosphate precipitateé of tantalum, zirconium, niobium,

hafnium, and titanium will carry protactinium quantitatively,
or nearly so. In addition, protactinlium is carried by most
other flocculent hydroxides (e.g., calcium and iron), probably

by adsorption rather than by isomorphous replacement.

Protactinium is carried by.MnOZ produced by the additlon of

KMnO, to a dilute HNO, solution containing Mn(NOB) In

3 2°
solutions of high lonlc strength the entrainment is not com-
pletely quantitative, but it becomes more so as the precipi-

tate 1s repeatedly redissolved and fractlionally precipitated.

Since titanium and zirconium are also carried, these
impurities, 1f present, can serve as carriers for the sep-

aration from manganeaezu.

6. Solvent Extractlon of Protactinium

At tracer levels (10'5 - 10'10

M) protactinium 1s extracted,
to some extent, from hydrochloric, nltric, sulfuric and even
perchloric acid solutions by a wide variety of unrelated
organic solvents. At the macro level (ca. 1 mg./ml.) the

roater of effective extractants is more exclusive.

In geﬂeral, protactinium is extracted readily by long-chain
alcohols and certain ketones, but poorly by the lower ethers.
Extractions from aqueous chloride media give better ylelds
and more reproducible results than those made from nitrate
solutions?®?. This would follow from the relative rates of

hydrolysis previously noted.

Maddock and his co-workers (18: 19, 21,.26, 27, 28) p,,e

studied the extraction of protactinium from hydrochloric acid
by various organic solvents (Figure 1l). For extraction of

macro amounts, they found diisopropyl ketone most satisfactory,

available.

Regardless of the organic solvent used, protactinium (V)
exhibits its highest distribution coefficients from strongly
acid aqueous media, consistent with its existence in aqueous
golution as a complex anion. In this respect, it resembles
most of the elements of groups IVa and Va of the Periodic
Table. Thorium and uranium, which can be extracted from
solutions of low acidity with the ald of s&lting agents,

can, therefore, be easily separafed.

In this laboratory, solvent extraction of protactinium has
been largely confined to diisobutyi carbinol diluted with
kerosene or benzene, primarily hecause of the extremely
high distribution coefflcients, capacity, and decontamina-
tion attainable wlth this solvent.

The author does not subscribe to the hypothesls of a soluble
but inéxtractable specles of protactiniung. In numerous
extractions of solutions containing both traces and milli-
grams of protactinium per milliliter, no such phenomenon

has been observed so long as the protacfiniuﬁ was in true
solution and fluoride ion was absent. A transient specles,

preliminary to hydrolysis, remains a possibility.

The following conditions have ylelded apparently inextract-
able protactinium: (a) the "protactinium™ was actually
actinium-227 and its decay products; (b) £luoride ion was
present; (c) the solution was colloidal; (d) interfering
elements (e.g., nlobium and iron),were present in large

amounts and were preferentially extracted; (e) the organic

15
solvent was excesslvely soluble in the aqueous phase (usua-
lly due to insufficient diluent); and (f) there was insuf-
ficlent sulfuric acid or hydrochlorlc acid to ccmplex both

protactinium and the impurities.

It has been suggested that a polymer of protactinium alone

26,30 renders the protactinium

or of protactinium with niobium
inextractable or :educes the distribution coefficlent. Such
a suggestion is unténable unless the polymer is regarded as
the precursor of a colloid or a preclpitate. As has been
stated previously, aqueous solutions (other than sulfate or
fluoride solutions) contalning macro amounts of protactinium

invariably yleld precipltates after a period of time varying

from a few hours to several weeksl7! 19.-

It 1s significant to note that, whenever protactinium 1s
extracted from an acid phase containing only hydrochloric
or nitric acid, investlgators report that the exﬁractions
are carried out soon after dissolution of the protactinium
[or after addition of fluoride-complexing catlons such as
aluminum (III) or boron (III)]. Aging of these solutions
increases the percentage of the "inextractable species", a
behavior consistent with slow hydrolysis and formation of

a colloid.

The addition of sulfuric ﬁcid, originally recommeénded by
Moore30 to break a "nonextractable complex of niobium-
protactinium oxalate"”, has been found to be necessary for
the complete extraction of protactinium by dlisobutyl
carbinol even in the abserce of niobium!?, The precise

conditions required have not yet been fully determined,

16
but an aqueous phase containing 9 N #5530, - 6 N HC1 has
been useful for all protactinium concentrations and degrees
of purity. Solutions containing up to 20 mg./ml. of prot-

actinium in dilsobutyl carbiﬁol have been prepared.

The extraction of protactinium-233 from niltric acid by
dilsobutyl carbinol has been examinéd, and high decon-
tamination factors for uranium, thorium, zirconium, nio-

bium, and rare earths are reported33.

actinium(V) in trace amounts can, therefore, be purified
to a considerable extent by this method. The protactinium
eluted in solutions containing HF can be resorbed if HBO'3'

Hardy and c.:a-v»;vt:u'.'l~7.e1.'|3]'7 have studied the ion exchange of
10'5 M protactinium from HNOB solutions in batch experi-
ments with ZeoKarb 225 cation resin and DeAcidi_te'FF anion

resin in the H' and NO,- forms, respectively (Figures 7

22
and 8). Equilibrium between the cation resin and 6 M HNO4
was reachea within 15 minutes, about ?3'per cent of the
protactinium being adsorbed. About 95 per cent of the
protactiniﬁm was adsorbed on the anion resin after one to
two hours. The samé investigators found that, from a 105 M
protactinium solution in 0.0l M HF-6 M HNO3 16 per cent of
the protactinium was adsorbed on ZeoKarb 225 cation resin

and 75 per cent on DeAcidite FF anion resin.

On the other hand, the au_thor15 has found tﬁat 10'5 M

more than 99.5 per cent of thé protactinium-231 appears

and disappearance of the solvent extractability of prot-

with its maximum at 260 mu. (Figure 9}. In 2.4 - 11.8 M

displaced to 217.5 mu, and, in 9 - 18 M acid, it was
resclved into two components at about 212.5 and 220 mu.

1V. DISSOLUTION OF PROTACTINIUM SAMPLES

Protactinium-233 or protactinium-231 made by neutron irrad-
iation of Th-232 or Th-230 offers no special problem other
than that of dissclving the thorium. Concentrated HNO3
containing 0.01 M HF will dissolve thorium without render-
ing it passive520 The HF also insures the solubllity of

protactinium.

28
In the case of'Pa231 from natural sources; the.variety of

these sburces defies any attempt to offer a general dissolu-
tion procedure. Typically, residues from processes for
recovering uranium and/or radium contain oxldes of Si, Fe,
Pb, Al, Mn, Ca, Mg, TL, and Zr, aﬁd a random selgction of
trace elements which are usually more abundant than prot-
actinium. Virgln pitchblende or other uranium ores will

contain other elements as well, usually in a refractory

condition.

Hahn and Meitner53 mixed a siliceous residue with Ta205
and fused the mixture with NaHS30, . After washing the

cooled melt with water, they dissolved the Pa and Ta in HF.

Pitchblende was digested with a mixture of HNO, and H,S0,,

- and the digestion liquor was treated with Nazcgjsun The
protactinium in the carbonate precipitate'remained lnsoluble
when the carbonates were dissolved in excess HNO3° When

the washed residue from the HNOj ;reatment was digested
with a mixture of HF and H,50, at an elevated temperature,
over 90% of the protactinium went into solution, while tne

bulk of the residue remalned insoluble.

A slliceous material consistingimainly of lead, barium, and
calcium sulfatea was digested wi;h 60% oleum, and the sul-
fates dissolved. The siliceous fesidue, containing the
protactinlum, was separated and dissolved in HF. Alterna-
tively, the original materlial was attacked with 404 HF,
dissolving the Pa and leaving the heavy-metal sulfates as

residueZI.

Depending upon the amount of material to be processed,
alkaline fusions are sometimes useful in separating large

amounts of silica, etc., while leaving the Pa insoluble.

29
In géneral, the followlng treatments can be recommended, in

the order given:
1. Digest the materlal wlth strong HCl to remove
- Fe.
2. Digest the residue from the HCl treatment with

hot, concentrated stou.

3. Digest the residue from the H,S0, treatment
with 25-48% HF or a mixture of HF and H,S50,.

4. Digest the residue with a hot mixture of HNO3
5. Digest the residue with hot 40-50% NaOH.
6. Fuse the residue with NaZCOJ, NaOH, XOH,

or KHSO4.

Throughout the dissolution, the fragtipns should be examined
by gamma-ray spectrometry, as the 27 kev peak of protactinium-
231 is unique and diastinctive (Figure 11).

While Pa233 has sometimes beén used as a tracer to follow
' the course of the Pa23l dissolutionZI, it is doubtful that
isotopic exchange takes place to a great extent between a

reffactory solid and a tracer-contalning doluﬁion.

life of 1.62 x 107 yearsu7. The princlpal beta energies
in mev are: 0.15 (37 per cent), 0.257 (58 per cent), and
0.568 (five per cent)®5, The gamma spectrum is shown in

Figure_1256.

In most work, only relativé values of protactinium-233 are
needed, hence the counting problems are essentially'the
game as with other relatively weak beta-emitters; sélf-
absorption, geometry, an& backscattering must be carefully
controlled:. For the absolute determination of pure prot-
actinium-233, a method based on 1ﬁs growth from neptunium-
23? has been suggested57. Here, é highly purified sample
of néptunium-ZB? 1s .electrodeposited and allowed to decay.
The beta-counting rate of protactinium-233 is compared with
the alpha-counting rate of neptunium—Zj?Iand the counting
efficiency calculated from the tﬁeoretical growth curve.
Altefnatively, the neptunium-237 may be permitted to decay
to secular equilibrium, when the disintegration rateé of

the two lsotopes are equal.

A simpler and more versatile method58 consists of standard-

1zing a scintillation gamma counter with-é solution of
purified protactinium-233 whose disintegration rate has been
determined in a 4T beta counter. A scintillation spectro-
meter is useful for identifying and determining protactinium-
233 in the presence of other activities. Correction for
interference by Compton conversion electrons must be made

if more energetic gamma rays are present.-

2. Protactinium-231

Protactinium-231 decays by alpha emlssion to actinium-227,
also an alpha emitter (Table 1I). The half-life has been

32
reported fo be 34,300 years59, and 32,000 yeafszz. A Tecent
calorimetric measurement on approximately 0.5 gram of prot-

actinium pentoxide15 yielded a value of 32,480 * 260 years.

Protactinium-231 has ten groups of élphﬁ particles, of which
43 per cent have energles below 5.0 mev. Thié_fact, combined
"with its low specific activity (about 56 mc/g);.makes prot-
actinium-231 alpha counting especially susceptlble to self-
absorptidn. Care must-be taken to keep the radioactive
deposit as thin as possible. A higher degree of counting
precision is attainable with a proportional alpha counter
than with either a parallel-plate alr-ionization counter or

a zinc sulfide scintillation counter. .

Ideally, the alpha plateau should be determined 1ndividually
for each samplé, but this is a tedious and time-consuming
procedure. The following mounting and counting techniqge
has been found to give high alpha-counting'precision15:

Trﬁnsfer one ml. or less of a fluoride solution
of protactinium-231 to a platiﬁum or gold plate,
or to a stainless steel disk coated-with a thin
plastic film (a clear plaétic spray coatlng or a
~ dilute collodion solution is convenient for this
lpurpose). Evaporate the solution to dryness
under an infrared lamp, tilting the plate as
necessary to retain the solution in the center
of the plate. Cool the plﬁte and cover the resi-
due with one ml. of 0,1 N HNOB. Add one drop of
concentrated NHuoH and again gvaporate;the solu-

tion to dryness. Lower the lamp sufficiently to
drive off all the NHuNOB, and-ignite the plate

33
over a flame until the organic coating has burned
off (or, 1f gold or platinum was used, ignite to

just below red heat). .

Determine the alpha platéau-of the proportional
counter by counting a standard alpha source
(Pu239, radium D-E-F, or Po210) at 50-volt inter-
vals. At the high-voltage end of the alpha
plateau, count a sample of Sr90/Y90 at 25-volt
iniervals,-and find the voltage below which only

0.01 per cent of the betas are counted. The
protactinium-231 sample can be counted at this

point with goo& precision and no significent

interference from beta emitters.

A gamm#-ray scintillation spectrometer is virtually a
necegssity in modern work with protactinium-zjl. The 27,

| 95, and 300 kev photopeaks (Figure 11) are characteristic,
and the 27 kev peak in particular is unique in the gamma
spectra of the naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Compare

Figures 13 through 16.)

The sensitivity of this method of detectlon 1s shown in
Figure 17, where 0.2 ppm of protactinium-231 is positively
.1dentified in a uranium refinery residue by the presence

of the distinctlve pho;opeak at 27-kev.

The high susceptibility of the 27 kev peék to absorption
precludes its use for the quantitative determination of
protactinium-231, but it 1s particularly valuable in the
preliminary dissolutién of a raw materlal. The 300 kev peak
js useful for quantitative work if cofrgétion i1s made for
the contribution of decay products and other gamma-active

materials.

VI. DETAILED RADIOCHEMICAL PROCEDURES FOR PRDTACIINIUﬁ

Procedure 1

"Preparation of carrler-free protactinium-233", according to
J. Golden and A. G. Maddock, J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 46 (1956)

Protactinium-233 was prepared by the neutron irradiation of
samples of acid-insoluble thorlum carbonate. Thls material,
of uncertain composltion, ls reasonably thermally stable, but
completely soluble in dilute HND, and HCl. After irradiationm
the material was dissolved in 8 N HCl and extracted wlth diiso-
propyl ketone (DIPK), The extract was treated with 2  HCL

when the Pa passed back to the aquecus layer. The aqueous

37T
Procedure 1 (Continued)
extract was then made 8 N again and the extraction repeatéd.
The protactinium was kept in solution in 8 N HCL in a poly-
ethylene vessel, It was observed that losses by adsorption
quickly took place on the walls of glass containers even with

golutions of the chloride complex in DIPK.

Better recoveries were obtained if the irradiated carbonate

was dissolved in 8 N HF, Thié solution was nearly saturated
with A1C13 before the first solvent extraction. -The subsequent
separation followed the first procedure. Neither product con-

tained detectable amounts of thorium.

(Reviewer's Note: - Irradiation of one gram of Th232 at

1013n/cm2-sec. for one day willl produce 0,25 curie of P3233.)

Procedure 2

Preparation of carrier-free protactinium-233, accerding to
F. Hagemann, M., H. Studier, and A. Ghiorso,
U. S. Atomic Energy Comm. Report CF-3796 (1947),
as quoted by Hyde (&)

The bombarded Th metal was dissolved in concentrated HNOg,
using a small amount of F~ as a catalyst. The aqueous solu-
tion was salted with Ca(NO3), to give solutions of 2.5 M

Ca(NO

1 M HNO The bulk of the U233

3)2’ 3 4°
was removed by ether extraction, following which Pa233 yas iso-

» and 0.42 M Th(NO,)

lated by dilsopropyl ketone extraction. Further purification
wag obtained by three Mn0, cycles in which 1 mg/ml of MnO, was
successively precipitated from HNO3 solution and redissolved

in HNO5 in the presence of NaNOz. After the third cycle the

38
Procedure 2 (Continued})
solution was made 3.5 M Ca(NO3), and 1 M HNO; and was extracted

with ethyl ether again to effect complete removal of uranium.
The protactinium was again coprecipitated on MnO;, dissolved
in concentrated HCl, and diluted to an acidity of 0.05 M; the
protactinium was extracted into é 0.15 M solution of thenoyl-

trifluorocacetone in benzene.

Procedure 3
-Prepafation of carrier-free protactinium-233, according to
W. W. Meinke, U. S. Atomic Energy Comm. Reports
AECD-2738 and AECD-2750 (1949) as quoted by Hyde (6)
The bombarded thorium-metal target is dissolved in concentrated
HNO;, using 0.01 M (NH4)231F6 as a catalyst. The solution is
diluted to approximstely 4 N HNO; and a thorium concentration
less than 0.65 M. Then Mo'' in excess and KMnO; are added to
precipitate 1.5 mg/ml MnO, to carry the protactinium. The Mn02
is dissolved in a small amount of 4 M NH,OH, The MnO, is
reprecipltated and redissolved three times to reduce the final
solution volume to a few milliliters. After it is made 6 M
HC1 or HNO,, it 1s extracted with two to three volumes of diiso-
propyl ketone. The ketone phase is washed three times with 1 M
HNOy and 3 M NH,NO; wash solution. The protaétinium is finally
stripped out into 0.1 M HNOj. The protactinium left behind is
recovered by using fresh ketome to repeat the extraction cycle,
All 0.1 M HNOj re-extraction solutions are combined, made 6 M
HNO3, and contacted with an equal volume of 0.4 M thenoyltri-
fluoroacetone (TTA) in benzene. The benzene solution of prot-

actinium-TTA complex is washed with 6 M HNO4 once.

Procedure 4
Preparation of carrier-free protactinium-233, according to
Max. W. Hill (Thesis), U. S. Atomic Energy Comm. Report
UCRL-8423 (August, 1958)
The targets were either Th metal or ThCl, powder, some of

which was converted to ThO, during the bombardments.

Concentrated HC1-0.01 M HF was used for dissolving relatively
small amounts of powder. Thorium metal was dissolved in con-
centrated HC1 - 0.2 M HF., The flﬁoride was complexed by the
addition of borax (Na,B,07-10 H,0) or AlCly béfore the solu-

tion was passed through the columm.

The colum was 3 mm. in diameter and was filled to a.height
of 55 mm. with Dowex-1 anion-exchange resin. The colum
volume, defined as the number of drops required for a band to

traverse the length of the resin column, was 5-6 drops.

In 10 M HC1l solutions, Pa(V), Zr(IV), and Nb(V) stick to the
resin, while Th(IV) passes through with the other alpha

emltters below Pa in the periodic table.

With 6 M HCl as the eluting agent, Zr(IV) is rapidly stripped
off in a few column volumes, without loss of Pa(V) or Nb(V).
The Pa is then eluted in 9.0 M HC1-0.1 M HF. The Nb(V) is

eluted in 1-4 M HCL.

The 9.0 M HC1 - 0.1 M HF solution containing the Pa was con-
tacted with an equal volume of diisopropyl ketone (DIPK).
Under these conditions, such species as Fe(1II) and Po(1V)

extract quantitatively into the DIPK along with appreclable

40
Procedure 4 (Continued)

amounts of Sn(IV), Nb(V), and others. Protactinium(V) ex-

tracts to the extent of less than 0.4%.

The solvent phase was discarded, and borax or anhydrous AlCl3
was added to the aqueous phase. (Although AlCl, seemed-to have
. 6lightly better complexing characteristics, it appeared to be
appreciably soluble in DIPK, and excess quantities in solution

gave voluminous precipitates.)

The aqueous phase was then contacted with an equal volume of
fresh DIPK, Under these conditions, Pa(V) is extracted
quantitatively by the solvent phase, seﬁarating it from Th(IV),
Ti(1v), v(V), Zr(IV), U(VI), and other species. The Pa was
then re-extracted from the solvent phase into an equal volume

of 2.0 M HCI.

To remove all extraneous mass and reduce the volume to a very
few drops, the golution containing the Pa was then made apprpxi-
mately 10 M in HCl1l and p&ssed through a small anion resin
colum (3 mm. in diameter, 12 mm. in height). After being
washed with 10 M HCl, the Pa was eluted with 2.7 M HCl. The
third through sixth drops contained more than 90 ﬁer cent of

the protactinium,

Procedure 5

F. L. Moore and S. A. Reynolds
Anal. Chem. 29, 1956 (1957)

be adjusted to 6 M HCl or greater. Add an aliquot of suitable

Adjust the aqueous phase to 6 M HCl-47% HpCp04. (If the original
sample contains Th, omit the H,C,0, in the original aqueous
phase and perform.tﬁe extraction from 6 M HCl. Wash the di=-
isobutyl carbinol (DIBC) phase (see next step) for 1 to 2
minutes with an equal volume of 6 I{ HC1l before beginning the
three scrubé of 6 M HCl-4% H,C,0,).

2. Extract for 5 minutes with an equal volume of DIBC
(previously treated for 5 minutes with an equal volume of
6 M HC1). | |

3. After the phases havé disengaged, draw off and
discard the aqueous phase. Scrub the organic phase for
5 minutes with- an equal volume of wash solution (6 Y HCl -
4% HoC90s). Repeat with two additional scrubs of

samples, an aiiquot of the organic phase may be taken at this
stage for counting. Only if a substantial activity of Nb, Sb,
or free I, is present is it necessary to-strip the organic
phasé.)

4. Strip the organic éhase by extracting for 3 minutes
with an equal volume of 6 M H,S0, -6 If HF. Allow the phases
to disengage, centrifuge for 1l minute, and draw off most of

the organic phase, being careful not to lose any of the aqueous

5. Pipet suitable aliquots of the aqueous phase for

* Oxallc acid omitted from original aqueous phase, values

(Reviewer's Comment: - The procedure is basically sound; but

the degree of separation is affected by the concentrations of
Pa and Nb, A DIBC solution containing 2.5 mg. Pa23l and 20
mg. Nb per ml. plus a stoichiometric amount of phosphate was
scrubbed with an equal volume of 6 M HC1-5% H,C,0,. The
aqueous phase contained 1.5% of the Pa and 75.3% of the Nb,

When the organic phaee was scrubbed a second time with fresh

L3
Procedure 5 (Continued)

aqueous, the aqueous phase contained 92.1% of the residual

Nb and 2.3% of the Pa.

The presence of iron also interferes significantly, presumably

because of the formation of a strong oxalate complex. .The

concentration of oxalic acid is probably less important than
the total amount relative to the amount of nicbium and other

oxalate-complexing cations.)

Procedure 6
Determination of protactinium in uranium residues,
according to J. Golden and A. G. Maddock,
J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 48-59 (1956)

The siliceous material consisted mainly of the sulfates of

Pb, Ba, and Ca.

Two methods of opening up were used. In the first, one-gram
samples were treated with 10 ml. of 60% 6leum, and a known

233 ,dded to the mixture. The Pb, Ba, and €a

amount of Pa
sulfates were dissolved, and the siliceous residue, containing

the Pa, was separated and dissclved in 5 ml, of 40% HF,

| Alternatively, it was found that the original material could
be attacked with 40% HF containing the pa233 tracer, leaving

the heavy-metal sulfates as residue and dissolving both Pa231

and Pa233. (Reviewer's Comment: - It is highly questionable

that isotopic exchange was complete.)

Either solution was diluted to 100 ml., and an excess of

BaCi2 was added. The Ban precipitéte was washed until no

bl
Procedure 6 (Continued)

obvious decrease in bulk took place. The remaining precipitate

consisted presumably of fluosilicates and was dissolved in
1M AL(NO4)4-6 N Hﬂ03.. The Pa was then carried down on a
MnO, precipitate, sufficient MnCl, and KMnO, solutions being
added to produce about 10 mg. of precipitate per ml. of
original solution. The mixtﬁre was digested at 100°C. for

half an hour.

The resulting precipitate was separated, washed, and dissolved
in 20 ml. of 7 N HCl with a trace of NaNOz. Alternatively,

the precipitate was leached with 10 ml. of 1 N HF,

In some analyses, the MnO2 stage was omitted entirely, and
the fluosilicate precipitate was dissolved in 7 N HCl-1 M
AlCly. The HCl solution from either of these three variations

was extracted with an equal volume of diisopropyl ketone.

Separation from most of the polonium can be effected by re-

extraction from the solvent into 7-8 N HCl-0.5 N HF.-

Procedure 7
Determination of protactinium in uranyl solutiom,
according to J. Golden and A. G. Maddock,
J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 46-59 {(1956)
The solution was made 8 N in HCl and 0.5 N in HF and the

tracer protactinium=-233 added.

Direct extraction with diisopropyl ketone removed many impuri-
ties, e.g., iron and polonium. Extraction after adding AlCl3

to complex the fluoride present brought the protactinium into

L5
Procedure 7 (Continued)

the solvent layer. Washing this layer with 8 N HCl removed
those elements whose extraction had been enhanced by the

presence of AlCl;, e.g., uranium and zirconium.

Finally, the protactinium was back-extracted with 6-8 N HCI -

0.5 N HF,

The next solvent cycle avoided the use of AlCl,, repeated
NH,OH precipitation and HCl solution, or continued evaporation

with HCl, being used to remove fluoride.

ln either case, the efficiency of a cycle was 98% or more,
without repetition of any step. At the most two of these

cycles were found to be sufficient to achleve radiochemical

purity.

Procedure 8
Determination of protactinium by gamma spectrometry,
according to M. L. Salutsky, M. L. Curtis, K. Shaver,
A, Elmlinger, and R, A. Miller,
Anal, Chem. 29, 373 (1957)
l. Welgh about 5 g. of uranium residue into a vial
suitable for counting in a well-type gamma scintillation

spectrometer. Determine the counting rate at 300 kev.

2. Transfer the sample to # beaker with a small amount
of HZO’ add 100 ml. of 9 N HCl and 1-2 ml. of 48% HF. Heat
until the sample dilissolves. Add more HF, if ﬁecessary.

3. Cool to room temperature. Add slowly, with stirring,

10 ml. 1 N HCl containing 10 mg. Th. Allow the mixture to

46
Procedure 8 (Continued)

stand 5 minutes. Add a second 10 mg. of Th, stir, and allow
the mixture to stand 5 minutes. Filter the ThF,.

4. Traﬁsfer the filter baper and precipitate to the vilal
used for the original sample. Determine-the gamma counting
rate at 300 kev. Make a blank determinatlion for the activity-
of the Th carrier used.

5. Obtain the fa gamna counting rate by difference.
Compare this counting rate wlth that of a standard profactinium
gample at 300 kev, and calculate the concentration of Fa in the

uranium residue.

(Reviewer's Comment: - This procedure contains a number of
fundamental errors, but, with appropriate modifications, may
be useful for obtalining a rough estimate of the Pa concentra-

tlon in certain types of samples.

The basic assumption of this procedure is that, under the
conditions given, all of the protactinium will remain in
solution, while all other radioisotopes which contribute to
the 300 kev gamma-counting rate will be carried on ThF,.

The first part of this assumption is subject to considerablé
doubt; Moore and Reynolds (cited in Procedure 1) found wide
variations in the behavior of protéctinium in the presénce of
fluoride precipitates. The second part of the assumption
lgnores the substantial contribution of radium-223 and other
radium isotopes to the 300 kev counting rate. It 1s unlikely
that a large percentage of the radium would be carried on ThF,

under the conditions recommended.

47
Procedure 8 (Continued)

Finally, no correction was made for the contribution to the

300 kev gamma-counting'rate by.decay products in the "“standard

-gample",

The following modifications seem indicated:.

1. Determine the yield by adding protactinium-233 to
a separate sample at Step 2. (The yield determination must
be:ﬁade separately because of the 310 ke§ gamma ray of
protactinium-233.)

2. Add barium carrier after Step 4,.and precipiltate
barium chloride by the addition of diethyl ether. (Moore
and Reynolds found that both BaCl2 and BaS0, carried sub-
stantial aﬁounts of protéctinium-233 in the absence of fluoride,
bgt did not test them in fluoride solutions. The yield
correction allows for_thé-possibility that some protactinium
is carried by the barium precipitate.)

3. Correct the gamma-count rate of the standard sample
for growth of decay products, or prepare a fresh standard

sample free of decay products (See Procedure 9). )

Procedure 9

Determination of protactinium by differential gamma spectrometry,
according to H. W, Kirby and P. E. Figgins. Unpublished.

(Reviewer's Note: - This procedure is limited to analysis of

chain.)

Prepare a radibchemically pure Pa standard by

one of two methods.

8.

If the protactinium is in a dry state; dissolve
it in hot concentrated H2504 and dilute the
solution to 18 N H,50,. Add an equal volume of
12 N HC1 to the cooled solution and one or two
drops of 30% Hy0,. (If the prétactinium is in
aqueous solution, adjust the concentration to

9 N H,S0, -6 N HCl. Fluoride must be absent or
complexed with Al+3 or HSBO3. It may also be

removed by evaporation to fumes with H SDA.)

Extract the aqueous solution with 2 ml. of
diisobutyl carbinol (DIBC) diluted to 50% with
benzene, Amsco'kerosene, or other inert diluent,
Scrub the organic phase with fresh 9 N HZSO4’

6 N HCl. The organic phase will contain radio-

chemically pure Pa231.

" 1f the PaZ3l ig in DIBC or other organic solution,

scrub the organic solution with two or three
volumes of 9 N H2504-6 N HC1 to remove decay
products. The Pa should be repurified at least

once a week.

3. Determine the location of the peaks of the unknown
sample in the regilons of 90 and 300 kev. Count the AEM, the
unknown, and standard Pa in that order at the peak of the
unknown in the 90 kev ‘region. Repeat the procedure in the
300 kev region. (Background in each region should be de-
termined before and after each series of three counts, and
weighted if there is significaﬁt variation with time.)

4, Calculate the ratio of the 90 kev count to the 300
kev count in each sample.

6. Determine the alpha counting rates of Fhe Pa and
AEM standard samples either by transferring them to alpha-
counting plates or by counting aliquots of the same solutions.

6. Bj simultaneous equations, calculate the contribu-
tion of protactinium and.of AEM to the gamma-counting rate
of the unknown at its peak in the 300 kev region. Correlate

these gamma counts of AEM and protactinium.

'The procedure needs to be evaluated with synthetic mixtures

Procedure 1l
Preparatlion of tetravalent protactinium, according to
M. Halssinsky and G. Bouissiéres, Bull. Soc. Chim. France
1931, 146-8, No, 37, (From the translation
_ by Mae Sitney, AEC-tr-1878) '
A 1-3 E,HZSO4_or'Hc1 golution of pure protactinium or prot-
actinium mixed with its carriers 1s placed in contact with

The column is joine& to a Buchner funnel, also of plexiglas.
The latter 1s closed at the bottom by clamped rubber tubing,

it can be washed with Hy0 which is passed over the amalgam,

'The reduction can also be carried out in the Buchner, in
‘which the amalgam is placéd in contact with the HF solution

in this case is proportional to the reduction. The procedure
may be advantageous for separating protactinium from tantalum,

It seems that during evaporation with 6 N HCl some radio-
colloid is formed which does not - react readily with NaOH,
When evaporated repeatedly with concentrated HCl this seems
to he inhibited and presumably the protactinium(v) is left
in the beaker as a very thin layer'on ‘the surface, which then

reacts readily.with fused NaOH.

When solutione which have been evaporated three timeg with
concentrated HGCl are created wlth aqueous 6 N KOH, some
transformation into a soluble form was also noted. without

this pretreatment no soluble fraction is obtained.

Preparation of solutions of protactinium in nitric acid,
according to C. J. Hardy, D. Scargill, and J. M. Fletcher,
J. Imorg. Nucl. Chem. 7, 257 75 (1958)

Milligram amounts of protectinium-23i were available in a

- HC1-HF solution at a concentration of 0.3 mg./ml. Stock solu-
tions (of the order of 10-3 to 10“4_ﬂ_Pa in 6,&-HN03)were‘_
prepared from this by evaporating almost to dryness with HNO, .-
several times, followed by three precipitations by NH40H; to
assist in_the decontamination from fluoride, with re-solution

each time in cold 6 M HN03.

It was found necessary to dissolve the hydroxide precipitate
shortly (<5 minutes) after its formation to prevent aging to.

 VIL. ' APPENDIX

Summary of the Protactinium Project at Mound Laboratory

The production of approximately one gram of protactinium-231

at Mound Laboratory is dwarfed in significance by the fact,

65
noted elsewhere in this report, that approximately 100 grams

~of this nuclide'waé_recently isolated in Great Britain.

Nevertheiess,_it seems worthwhile to describe the operatipn at
this LabdratOry for its historical value as well as for the
.additional chemical insight aff&rded by the various steps in
'tbe process. It 1ls especially nO;eworthy that.at no point in
the.proceas was it found necesséry, or even desirable, tb use

fluoride for the solubilization of the protactinium.

The protactinium project waé initiated in-1954 at the ;eqﬁest
of Oak Ridge National Laboratory for tﬁe.pu:pOSe,of obtaining.
a supply of pfétactiniﬁm which could be used to study its
macrochemical properties. |

The best afgilable source was a resiﬁué which could be filtered
from the aqueous raffinate resulting from the diethyl ether
extraction of uranium,. The residue, whose_mdjqr constituents
were iron.'aluminum, caicium? magnesium, cbbélt, and copper,
‘contained approximately 0.1 to 0.2 ppm of protactinium. A
process was developed and réported6o which gave good recoveries
“and purity on a microgram scale, The process consisted of
dissolution in 1 N HCl, saturation with NaCl, and boiling to
coagulate a small precipitate, which'consisted principally of
calcium and silica, and which carried protactinium quantita-
tively. The precipitate was digested with NaOH, to remové
silica, and the hydroxide reaidﬁe was dissolved in 9 [ HCIL,

The solution was passed through an anion exchanger, leaving
protactinium on the resin. The protaétinium was eluted with

a mixture of HC1 and HF.
On the basis of the apparently simple and inexpensive process,
20 tons of raw material was obtalned from the uranium refineryw
Inasmuch as the filtratlon of the precipitate from the aqueous
waste stream was not a normal part of the treatment of the.
aqueous waste, no stockpile was available, and the raw material

was obtained from the then-current refinery operations.

When received at this Laboratory (in 80 steel drums) it was
obvliously inhomogeneous; the color of the material ranged

from a light tan to the dark reddish-brown of ferric hydroxide.
Spectrographic analysis confirmed that the material was sig-
nificantly different in composiﬁion from the samples previously
received for analysis and process development. Typically,

iron was a major constituent, and the aluminum and calcium
previously found were either abseﬁt or reduced to minor con-
stituents. No two drums contained raw material of identical

composition.

A single drum was selected which appeared to be intermediate
in composition, and optimum conditions for the dissolution and
precipitétion of the protactinium were deve10ped61. Plant

operations were then begun.

The material in the selected drum behaved exactly as predicted,
as did one or two other batches. However, the inhomogeneity
of the raw material quickly became evident wﬁen the protac-
tinium either failed to dissolve quantitatively in the
selected acid (2 N HCl) or, after dissolving, failed to pre-

cipitate when NaCl was added and the solution boiled.

67
Since of the 20 tons of raw matefial available, only about
half would Be needed to fulfill the commitment for one gram

of protactinium, batches were selected on the basié of the
solubility of protactinium in 2 H HCl. Simultaneous analyti-
cal and process development fSée Procedure 10) showed that

the precipiltate which carried protactinium from the NaCl
solutlon was nét, as préviously thought, a calcium silicate,
but T10,+xPO;, and that the coprecipitation could be made
quantitative by addition of TiClj to the HCl solution.

(The raw material contained sufficient nitrate ion to oxidize
the Ti*3, Precipitatioﬁ of Ti'3 is incomplete and excessively
slow in the presence of ferric ion.) Therefore, failure of
the protactinium to coprecipitate quantitatively was corrected
by the expedient of adding TiCl; to the process solution.

(It was subsequently found that those batches in which prot-
actinium failed to dissolve easily were phosphate-deficient
and probably required much higher acidities to solubilize the
iron. In addition, the protactinium was prbbably held in an

insoluble condition by the more refractory Ti0, and Nb,0s.)

The NaOH metathesis of the protactiniferous precipitate, which
was called for by the original process, produced a residue
which was only partially soluble in 9 § HCl, and the protac-
tinium which did dissolve.hydrolyied-élowly and reprec¢lpitated.
1t was,_therefqre, not suitable for use as an anion exchange
feed solution. Dissolution in HF and separatioh of the iron
on an anion exchangérso was found to be impractical because of

the excessively large quantities of iron which had to be removed.

68
However, a slurry of the hydroxide residue in 6 N BC1l could
be extracted with diisobutyl carbinol (DIBC) diluted to 50
per cent with Amsco kerosené° If the dissolution and extrac-
tlon were carried out shortly after the NaOH treatment, about
80 per cent of the protactinium could be extracted before
hydrolysis produced "inextractable" protactinium. It is note-
worthy that the presence of large amounts of iron decreases

the rate of hydrolysis of protactinium in HCI.

After extraction by DIBC, the aqueous raffinate was allowed
to settle, and the supernate was discarded. The insoluble
residue was retained for further processing with H,80,-HC1

(Procedure 10, Step 3).

The crganlc phase was strippéd with two successlve portions

of one-tenth its volume of water.

Although considerable iron was separated by the coprecipita-
tion.of protactinium on Tl from HCl solution, the iron which
remained was extracted by DIBC and stripped along with the
protactinium. When attempts were made to concentrate the
protactinlum by recycling through DIBC, it was found that, in
high concentration, iron was extracted preferentially and
limited tﬁe degree of protactinium-concentration which could

be achieved.

The strip solution was made 5-6 N in HCl and extracted with
isopropyl ether, which removed a large, but undetermined,

percentage of the iron with a loss of oniy about one per cent

€9
of the protactinium. Higher HCl concentrations drove more
iron into the organic phase, but the loss of protactinium
became prohibitive. The aqueous phase was adjusted with H,50,

and HCl, and the protactinium was extracted in pIBCO2,

The organic phase was stripped with one-tenth its volume of
30% Hy0,. The strip solution was adjusted to 9 N HZSO4 -

6 N HCl, and the protactinium was re-extracted in DIBC, After
four cycles of extraction and stripping, appro#tmately one
gram of protactinium was concentrated in fractions totaling

less than one gallon of aqueous and organic solutions.

The work was interrupted at this point and was not resumed
for more than a year. By that time, all of the protactinium
had hydrolyzed, affording further separation from iron. Dis-
solution in H580, and extraction in DIBC yielded 660 ml. of
organic solution containing approximately 900 milligrams of
protactinium. A spectrographic analysis of the first concen-

trate is glven in Table IV¥*,

It was apparent that the principal impurities were irom,
phosphate; and niobium. The presence of bismuth was highly
questlonable, and no specific effort was made to separate

it or any of the other reported impurities. Analysis of the

final product confirmed fhe validity of the decision.

Development of purification methods proceeded concurrently

wlth the purification itself, so that, by the time a method

had been developed which could be used routinely, nearly the

entire batch had been partially purified.

It was found that
methods which were effectlve at one level of purity were
elther partially or totally ineffective at thé next higher
level, so that no one method was ever developed which could,
with cdmpleté confidence, be used at all stages of the

purification.

For example, in a typical series of experiments, 25 ml, of
DIBC containing Fe, Nb, and about 35 mg. of Pa was stripped
with an aqueous 501ution which was 4 N HCl and 10% Hy05.

The volume ratio of the phases was varied, and the course of
the iron separation was followed with the aid of Fe’? added
as a tracer. The percentage of Pa stripped rose sharply with
increasing aqueous volume and reached a plateau of 98% at an
aqueoug-organic ratio of about 0.15, The amount of Fe stripped
also increased, but less sharply, so that, at a volume ratio
of 0.14, 95.67% of the Pa was stripped with 2.0% of the Fe.
However, when the organic phase was stripped a second time
with fresh strip solution in the same ratio, the aqueous

phase contained almost 20% of the Fe.

1t is evident that, in solutions of relatively high concentra-
tions, the degree of separation by solvent extraction is
governed by the relative solubilities of the metal ilon com-
plexes in the aqueous and organic solutionms, ratﬁer than by
their individual distribution coefficients. This contrasts

with their behavior in more nearly ideal solutions.

The HCl-H,0, strip gave no separation from Nb. However, after

addition of HZSO4 to the strip solution, the Pa was re-

T2
extracted with DIBC, and apprqximatelj half of the Nb remained

in the aqueous phase with less than 6% of the Pa.

Spectrographi¢ analysis showed that 75% of the phosphorus had |
been removed. The intermediate product consisted of 835 mg.
of protactinium in 150 ml. of DIBC. The iron-laden organic
and the niobium-laden aquebus raffinates were retained, and

the protactinium was subsequently recovered and purified.

A second, ‘and far more effective, Fe separation was discovered
at a later stage in the purification: When 10 ml. of DIBC
containing Pa, Fe, and Nb was stripped with a mixture of 4.5
ml. of 18 N H,80, and 0.5 ml. of 30% H,0,, the organic phase
retailned 627% of the Nb and 1007 of the Fe, whlle 1007 of the
Pa passed into the aqueous phase., The Pa was reextracted

into DIBC after addition of HCl to the aqueous phase.

Attempts to separate Nb from Pa by stripping the organic solu-

tion with an HCl/H20204 mix'ture63

were unsuccessful so long

as both elements were present in relatively high concentrations.
With the bulk of the Nb removed, the efficlency of separation
was lmproved, but was still not completely satisfactory: 1In

a single pass with equal volumes of organic and aqueous phases,
a mixture of 5% H,C,0, and 6 N HCl stripped out about 70% of
the Nb and about 57 of the Pa. When Fe(III) was present to a
eignificant degree, the H2C204/HCI strip was almost totally

ineffective.

A batch countercurrent method was developed which stripped

the Nb from each batch of organic solution with three separate

T3
portions of the HyCp04/HCl mixture. About 957% of the Nb was

removed in the aqueous phases, with about 5% of the Pa.

The aqueous phase was diluted with an equal volume of H,0

and heated for 10 minutes at 90°C. Protactinium precipitated,
leéving Nb and Fe quantitatively in the supernmatant solution
(ef. Ref, 23). The preclpitate was centrifuged, and the Pa

was redissolved in H,S0, and extracted with DIBC.

Another separation of Nb from Pa, based on the hydrolytic
precipitation of Pa from acid oxalate solution, comnsisted of
stripping the DIBC solution with 10% H20204 which was 1L N in
HCl, A precipiﬁate irmediately appeared in the aqueous phase,
and was found to contain all of the Pa and 207% of the Nb.

The precipitate, on being heated with fresh strip solutionm,
dissolved almost completely, but a new precipitate formed in
a few minutes. The new precipitate contained all of the Pa,
while Nb remained quantitatively in solution. The precipita-
tion of Pa was somewhat erfatic under these conditions, but
could be made quantitative by the addition of one drop of 857%

H3P04 to 10 ml, of the oxalate solution.

Eliminatioq of phosphate ion was achleved by precipitation

of protactinium iodate from dilute H2504. The Pa was stripped
from DIBC with 5 N H2504, and the solution was diluted with
H,0. The solution, containing 120 mg. of Pa in 35 ml. of 1.4
N HyS0,, was warmed on a water bath. Protactinium lodate was
precipifated by the dropwise addition of 15% HIO3. The pre-

cipitate was cooled, centrifuged, and separated from the

Th
supernatant solution. The solution was gamma-counted and
contained the equivalent éf between 0.1 and Q.S mg. of Pa,
However, gamma-ray spectrometry showed that the gamma activity
came almost entirely from actinium~227 and its decay products;
the 27-kev gamma peak of protactinium-231 was completely

absent.

The protactinium iodate was digested with concéntrated HC1
and wafmed gently until gas evolution ceased. The Pa dis-
solved initially, but reappeared shortly as a flocculent
precipitate, which was centrifuged, washed, and dried at-110°C.
A spectrographic analysis of the hydrous oxide is given in

Table 1V.

Approximately 0.5 g. of Pa was ignited to the pentoxide at
675°C. An x-ray powder pattern showed that the crystal struc-

ture corresponded to that of cuble Pa205'12*°

The heat output of the Pa205 was measured 1ln an isothermal
calorimeter**, and the half-lite of Pa23l yas found to be
32,4801260 years, after correction fﬁr chemical impurities
and decay products. Details of the half-life measurement

will be reported in the near future.

As a result of chemical operations at Mound Laboratory thus

far, approximately 700 milligrams of chemically and radio-
