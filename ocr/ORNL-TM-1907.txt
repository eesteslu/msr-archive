CORROSION OF THE VOLATILITY PILOT PLANT INOR-8
DISSOLVER AFTER SEVEN COLD DISSOLUTION RUNS

E. C. Moncrief
A. P. Litman

ABSTRACT

The Volatility Pilot Plant dissolver vessel, based on ultrasonic thickness measurements,
seems to be sustaining low corrosion losses.

Wall thickness changes were measured for the Volatility Pilot Plant INOR-8 dissolver

a fter 204 hours of exposure to anhydrous HF and equimolar NaF-LiF fused salt contain-
ing 22-52 mole per cent ZrF at 495-655°C while Zircaloy-2 dummy fuel elements
were being dissolved. Measurements were taken using the "Vidigage, " an ultrasonic
thickness measuring device, first after an ammonium oxalate solution wash to dis-
solve residual salt, and later after an HNO3-AI(NO3)5 rinse to remove any metallic
deposits that might have formed.

For the dissolver, maximum wall thickness losses were nofed in the vapor region where
a maximum loss of 11 mils was found. This loss corresponds to 0.054 mils/hour, based
on HF exposure time, or 17.0 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time. Lower
losses occurred in the vapor-salt interface region, and still less in the salt region of
the vessel. Bulk metal losses due to the use of the oxalate and nitric acid-aluminum
nitrate solutions were considered negligible. OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY

The Volatility Pilot Plant has.curréntiy completed a series of seven

cold dissolution runs using Zircaloy-2 dummy fuel elements according to

the head-end procedure of the fused salt Volatility Process.

- .These runs
were designed to evaluate the HF dissolution step of the Volatility Proc-
€sS. - N

A necessary part of that evaluation was the determination of the

corrosion losses occurring on INOR-8, the material of construction for
the dissolvef vessel

and Mo: 16 wt %.

Although a restricted number of readings were taken on the top

cylindrical section of the dissolver because of thé presence of insulation,

sufficient data were collected to indicate that the vessel had lost an

average of 9.3 mils on the inside diameter of that section (see Fig. 2)

- This loss cbrresponds to 0.045 mils/hr, based on HF exposure time. The

top section was exposed only to the process vapors except for occasional
salt splash. However, for comparative purposes, an average rate loss
figure of 14.4 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time was also
calculated, The maximum wall thickness loss in the vapor region of the
dissolver, 1l mils, did not deviate greatly from the average quoted.

The conical section of the hydrofluorination vessel was exposed to -

" both process vapors and fluoride salts during the runs described. In

run T-7 the salt level was in the conical section; in all other runs salt
contact was from splash. The average wall thickness loss found for this

section was 4.2 mils, less than the 1% accuracy of the "Vidigage" instru-
ment, although a maximum of 10 mils loss was noted at one point (see

Fig. 3). Maximum rate losses were 0.0M9 mils/hr, based on HF exposure

4time or 15.4 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time,

The bottom section of the dissolver consists of five cylinders of

5-1/2 inches inside diameter and varying length joined by circumferential

welds'to form a right cylinder 9 feet in height. Thickness measurements
of this section did not disclose significant bulk metal loss (see Fig. 4).

However, two areas in the west quadrant did register unusual hlgh and low

- thickness changes. These 1rregular1t1es may be due to inaccuracies in the

' base~line data collected on the dissolver vessel. Excludlng the high and

low data -mentioned, a maximum loss of 6 mils was found for the bottom
section,

Comparison of the thickness Jata before and after the nitric acid-
aluminum nitrate rinse (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) ihdicated that negligible
changes occurred outside the accuracy of the "Vidigage" instrument.

The Volatility Pilot Plant dissolver vessel, based on ultrasonic

thickness measurements, seems to be sustaining low corrosion losses.
