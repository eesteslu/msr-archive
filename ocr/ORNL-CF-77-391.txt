ABSTRACT

Job descriptions and cost estimates have been pre-
pared for two methods of decommissioning the shutdown
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). Dismantling of all
process equipment for disposal in a solid-waste storage
area is estimated to cost $11,600,000. Transferring all
contaminated external equipment to the reactor containment
cell followed by filling the cell with concrete for in-
place entombment is estimated to cost $4,770,000. Also
included are a history of the reactor, a description of
the components, and a list of references.

1. INTRODUCTION

Research and development programs dealing with nuclear reactors and
their radioactive products have been carried out at ORNL since its
beginning in 1943. An increasing number of radioactive and radioactively.
contaminated facilities have been shut down due to completion of programs

or to being supplanted by more up~to-date facilities. Since these shut-

: down facilities contain hazardous amounts of both fixed and removable

radioactive materials, they must be kept under constant surveillance and
structurally maintained to preclude unauthorized entry by personnel and
to ensure against the release of radioactive contaminants to the environ-

ment. A portion of the financing and all personnel attention required

. for surveillance and maintenance of these facilities must be supplied by

on-going programs not related to the original programs which produced

the facilities. Although some advantage is gained in delaying final dis-
position of such shutdown facilities to await decay of relatively short-—
lived nuclides, further delay not only penalizes other programs but also
increases the risk of violation of containments due to deterioration or
accident.

The shutdown facilities include four reactors: the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE), shut down in 1969; the Homogeneous Reactor
Experiment No. 2 (HRE-2), shut down in 1961; fhe Low-Intensity Testing
Reactor (LITR); shut down in 1966; and the Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor
(OGR), shut down in 1963. This report considefs the final disposal of
the MSRE.

The two methods of disposal considered are: (1) removal and burial
of all radioactive and contaminated systems components in a solid-waste |
disposal area; and (2) entombment of the more radioactive items in con-
crete within the existing below-grade concrete-shielded cells. Both
approaches assume that the 233U now stored in drain tanks in a shielded
cell adjacent to the reactor cell will have been removed prior to begin-
ning the decommissioning.

- This Feport contains a brief history of the project and sufficiently

detailed descriptions of the radioactive and auxiliary systems to expiain
12

the work that will be required to accomplish the decommissioning. More
detailed descriptions of the systems and components can be found in the
references. -

The MSRE was a 10-MW reactor built to investigate the practicality
of_the molten-salt concept for central power station applications. The
reactor and its accessory components are located in a group of mostly
below-grade shielded concrete cells within a mill-type building remote
from the main ORNL area. The last charging of fuel salt containing 233y
as the fissionable species remains stored in two drain tanks in a cell
adjacent to the reactor cell. This salt must be heated to above
300°F annually to recombine radiolytically produced fluorine gas. Due
to.the presence of the fuel and the residual radiocactive fission and
corrosion products within it and distributed throughout the reactor pri-
mary system and fuel-processing system, a filtered ventilation system
must be maintained in operation. Additionally, varying degrees of sur-
veillance and maintenance efforts must be exercised on a daily, a monthly,
and an annual basis to guarantee that the reactor remains environmentally

safe.

2. GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1 General Description

The MSRE was a single-region, unclad—graphite—modérated, homogeneous -
fuel type reactor with a design heat generation of 10 MW. The cir-
culating fuel solution was a mixture of lithium, beryllium, and zirconium
fluoride salts containing uranium fluoride as the fuel. The mixture had
an euctectoid liquidus point of 840°F and operated normally at 1200°F core

outlet temperature. Reactor heat was transferred from the fuel salt to

a similar coolant salt and then dissipated to the atmosphere.

2.2 History

The MSRE was constructed during the years 1961-1964 in a building

originally built for molten-salt reactor experiments for the Aircraft

t 0 9

vre
¢« v ¥
it

13

Nuclear Propulsion Program (ANP). The purpose of the‘MSRE was to dem-
onstrate that such a reactor could be constructed and maintained without
undue difficulty and could be operated safely and reliably. Additional
objectives were to provide the first large-scale; long-term, high-
temperature tests in a reactor environment of the fuel sélt, graphite
moderator,-and high-nickel-base alloy (INOR~-8) construction material.

The reactor first reached criticality on June 1, 1965, and concluded
operation on December 12, 1969. During this time the reactor accumulated
72,441 MW-hrs using ‘23%U fuel and 33,296 MW;hrs.using 233y fuel for a
total of 105,737 MW~hrs which is equivalent to 13,217 equivalent full-power
hours at 8.0 MW full power.

2.3 Reactor Site and Building

The MSRE 1is located in Melton Valley about one~half mile southeast of

.the main ORNL area (Figure 1) near the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR)

and the Homogeneous Reactor Test (HRT) sites. A plot plan of the reactor
building complex is shown in Figure 2. Figures 3 and 4 ére views of the
front and rear of the building.

The building is constructed of steel framing and.asbestos cement
type corrugated siding with a sheet steel interior finish. Essentially
all portions of the building below grade are constructed of reinforced
concrete. Figure 5 is a plan of the reactor building at grade level, and
Figure 6 1s a plan 12 ft below grade showing the shielded cells and adja-
cent working areas. Figure 7 is an elevation through the cells. The |
west half of the building at grade level is about 42 ft wide,'157 ft long,
and 33 ft high. This high-bay or "crane-bay" area houses the reactor cell
drain-tank cell, coolant-salt '"penthouse'", and most of the auxiliary cells.
It is serviced by two bridge cranes, one equipped with a 30-ton hoist and

the other with both a 3-ton and a 10-ton hoist. The east half is 38 ft

‘wide, 157 ft long, about 12 ft high. This section contains the control

rooms, maintenance shops, change rooms, and some offices. (As explained in

Section 3.5, some of these areas are now in use by groups not related to

the MSRE program.)
Most of the west half of the below-grade level is occupied by the
reactor cell, drain~tank cell, and auxiliary cells. The east half con-

tained an office, a maintenance shop, and a chemical_laboratory.

2.4 Shielded Containment Cells

As shown in Figures 5 and 6 the reactor and its accessory components
are located in a group of shielded cells rather than in a single contain-
ment. This arrangement enhanced accessibility for maintenance and greatly
reduced the number of components incurring induced radioactivity due td
neutron irradiation. Only those components and structures within the
reactor_shield tank were subjected to neutron irradiation and must be
partially or totally removed to reduce the radiation level. All other cells
will require only decontamination following either the removal or decon-
tamination of the items within them. Access to fhe cells is gained by
the removal of concrete roof plugs. The reactor cell and the adjacent
interconnected fuel-drain-tank cell have an ll-gage stainless steel mem-
brane between the two layers of concrete roof plugs as a containment |
seal. Access to the cells is gained by cutting an opening in the membrane..
When the cell is to be resealed, a patch is welded over the opening. The
top shielding arrangements for the reactor cell and drain-tank cell are
shown in Figures 8 and 9.

The reactor cell is a cylindrical carbon steel vessel 24 ft in
diameter and 33 ft in overall height with a hemispherical bottom and a
flat top. The bottom is 1 to 1 1/4 in. thick and the cylindrical portion
is 2 in. thick except for the section containing the large penetrations
where it is 4 in. thick. The reactor cell vessel is installed within
another cylindrical steel tank refefred to as the "shield tank". This
outer tank is 30 ft in diameter by 35 1/2 ft high. The flat bottom is
3/4 in. thick and the cylindrical section is 3/8 in. thick. The tank is
supported on a reinforced concrete base within an enclosure formed by con-
crete soil—retaining walls and the concrete walls of adjacent cells. The
reactor céll vessel rests upon a cylindrical steel skirt supported from
the bottom of the shield tank. The annulus between the two tanks is
filled with magnetite sand and water; the cavity encompassed by the sup-
port skirt is filled only with water. |

fenetrations into the reactor cell for pipes and conduits were pro-
vided by installing a bellows-equipped sleeve between openings in the two

vessels (Figure 10). The purpose of the bellows was to accommodate

dimensional changes due to temperature and pressure. Pipes and conduits
pass through stepped shielding plugs which fit into the penetration
sleeves. 'Thg pipes and conduits are seal-welded to the two faces of the
plugs aqd_aré curved or coffset within the plug to prevent radiation
streaming.' The'outer rim of the shield plug is seal-welded to the sleeve.

Since the reactor celllatmosphere extended to this seal weld, the sleeves

- and shield piugs are contaminated up to that region.

2.5 Reactor Primary System

The major components of the reactor primary system are the reactor
vessel, the fuel-salt pump, the heat exéhanger, and the interconnecting.
pipes and flanges. All of these components are located inside the reactor
cell, Figure 11 is the fuel system process flow sheet showing both the
primary system itself and the various_subsystems. |

Except for the graphite moderator, all the materials of the primary
system that were in contact with the fuel salt are Hastelloy-N (INOR-8),

a nickel-molybdenum-iron-chromium alloy which is highly resistant to cor-
rosion by molten fluoride salts and has high strength at eievated tempera-
tures. The properties of this material are lisﬁed in Table 1. Figﬁre 12
is a simplified flow diagram of the reactor primary and secondary systems
and Figure 13 is a layout of these systems, Figure 14 is a photograph of

the reactor cell with the components partially installed.

2.5.1 Reactor Vessel and Core

 

Physical characteristics of the reactor vessel and its contents are
listed in Table 2. | |

The feactor vessel is 58 in. I.D. and about 94 in. high (Figures 15
and 16). The wall thickness of the cylindrical portion is 9/16 in. except
for the top 16 in., which is 1 in. thick. An 8-in.-I.D. half-round

welded circumferentially to the tank over the l-in.-thick section served

'as the fuel-salt inlet flow distributor. The salt delivered by the dis-

tributor entered the tank through 3/4-in.-diameter holes drilled through

'the l-iﬁ.—thick section. The salt flow from the flow distfibutor entered

the annular space between the vessel and core container and flowed down-

ward providing efficient cooling for the core can and reactor vessel walls

by flowing countercurrent to the upflow of heated salt in the core. The
top and bottom of the vessel are 58-in.-I.D. flanged and dished heads.
The vessel is supported by 12 suspension rods from the top of the thermal
shield (to be described later). The suspension rods (Figure 17) are con-
nected to support lugs welded to the reactor vessel above the flow dis-
tributor.

The core can, or shell, is 55 1/2 in. I.D. and 67 15/16 in. high with
a wall thickness of 1/4 in. The can is supported by a ring at the top of
the can which is bolted to 36 lugs welded to the inside of the reactor
vessel wall. The can supports the graphite used as the moderator material

for the core.

The graphite moderator is formed of 513 blocks, each of which is 2 in.

x 2 in. x v67 in. These are stacked in a vertical close-packed array as
shown in Figure 18. In addition, there are 104 fractionai-sized blocks at
the periphery. Fuel passages were provided by milling a rectangular ver-
tical groove down each block face. When assembled, these grooves formed
0.4 in. x 1.2 in. vertical channels through which the fuel salt moved from
the bottom to the top of the core.

The vertical graphite blocks rest on a lattice of horizontal graphite
blocks, about 1 by 1 5/8 in. in cross section, laid in two 1ayérs at right
angles to each other. Holes in the lattice blocks accept the l-in.-
diameter doweled section at the lower end of each vertical block. The
upper horizontal surfaces of both the vertical blocks are tapered to pre-
vent salt from being retained on them when the vessel was drained. The
lattice blocks rest on a grid of 1/2-in.-thick INOR-8 plates set on edge
and varying in height from 1 5/8 in. at the core periphery to about
5 9/16 in. at the center. This support grid is fastened to the bottom of
the core can. Each of the vertical blocks is locked to the grid by 5/16-
in.-diameter rods which pass through holes in the grid and holes in the
doweled sections of the blocks. Forty-eight vertical fins located around
the periphery of the reactor vessel below the core support grid prevented
spiraling flow of the fuel salt in the region below the core.
| At the center of the bottom of the reactor vessel is a 1 1/2-in.

is covered with a protective hood to prevent debris from entering the
pipe. A 1/2-in.-diameter tube within the drain line opens into the vessel
just above the bottom surface to allow complete draihing.

The top head of the reactor vessel is equipped with a 10-in.-diameter,
40-in.-tall nozzle. A 5-in. nozzle emerging from the side of the exten-
sion is the fuel-salt exit line from the vessel. The 10-in. nozzle served
also as an entry port for the three control rods (Figures 15 and 19) and
as an access for inserting and removing replaceable core blocks and

materials—-testing specimens.

 

2.5.2 Thermal Shield

The primary functions of the thermal shield (Figures 6, 7, and 20)
were to reduce the radiation damage to the reactor containment vessel and
to cell equipment, to serve as part of the biological shielding, and to
provide the support for the reactor vessel which is suspended within it.

The shield is a water-cooled, steel ball and water filled container
which compietely surrounds the reactor vessel. It is about 10.4 ft 0.D.
by 7.8 ft I.D. and 12.5 ft tall. The l4-in.~wide annular space is filied
with l-in.-diameter carbon steel balls. The shiéld coolant circulated
through the interstitial spaces. The shield walls are made of 1-in.-
thick 304 stainless steel plate.

Six separate parts make up the thermal shield assembly: the flat

>semirectangu1ar base, the main cylindrical section, three removable seg-

ments of the cylindrical section, and the removable top cover. The
rémoﬁable segments fill slots in the cylindrical sections through which
the reactor fill and drain line and the fuel-salt inlet and outlet lines
to.the reactor passed as the reactor vessel was lowered into position.
The base and main cylindrical sections have many equipment support struc-

tures attached to them.

2.5.3 Primary System Pump

 

From the top of the reactor vessel the fuel flowed directly to the
primary system pump bowl through a 13.8 ft length of 5-in, Schedule 40
pipe which enlarges to 6 in. below the pump to adapt to the pump suction

nozzle size. The components and appearance of the centrifugal sump-type

pump and pump bowl are shown in Figures 21 and 22. The pump bowl is about
36 in. in diameter and contains the pump casing, gas stripping manifold,
sampler—enricher cage, and off-gas connections. It served as a surge tank
for the loop with a cover-gas pressure maintained above the operating salt
level. The removable pump and 75-hp motor assembly is about 8 ft tall and
consists of all the rotary elements and bearings of the pump. The assembly
is mounted on a 2 1/2-in.-thick plate that can move horizontally and ver-
tically to accommodate thermal expansion of the system. This was necessary
since the reactor position is fixed. The mounting plate is, in turn,

supported by two 8-in. horizontal I-beams attached to the cell structure.

2.5.4 Primary System Heat Exchanger

 

From the pump discharge the fuel salt passed directly through a 6.0 ft
length of 5-in. Schedule 40 pipe to the primary system heat exchanger
(Figures 23 and 24) which is a horizontal, shell and U-tube type, in which
the fuel salt circulated through the shell side and the coolant salt
through the tubes. It is of all-welded construction and made entirely of
INOR-8 except for the brazing material that sealed the tubes to the sheet.

The shell is about 16 in. 0.D. by about 8 ft 3 in. long and is 1/2 in.
thick including both the cylindrical portion and the heads. The fuel salt
entered at the U-bend end through a 5-in. Schedule 40 nozzle and emerged
through a 7 in. by 5 in. reducing nozzle at the bottom of the shell at the
tube-sheet end and flowed to the reactor inlet through a 17.2 ft length
of 5~in. Schedule 40 INOR-8 pipe. The coolant salt entered the top mani-
fold at the tube-sheet end and exited from the bottom manifold. Both the
inlet and exit nozzles are 5 in. diameter Schedule 40.

The heat exchanger contains 159 U-tubes which are 1/2 in. 0.D. with
a wall thickness of 0.042 in. The tube sheet is 1 1/2 in. thick. The
tubes are spaced and supported by three baffle plates and one barrier
plate (near the tube sheet) and in addition are laced with 1/4 in. x
0,017 in. INOR-8 straps to suppress vibrationms.

Due to the short lengths of interconnecting pipes and the immov-
ability of the reactor vessel, the heat exchanger, like the fuel pump, had

to be supported in a manner that allowed horizontal and vertical movement

rests upon an assembly of 8-in. I-beams fixed to the cell structure.

2.5.5 Fuel Pu@p,OVérflow Tank

 

The primary system pump bowl has an overflow pipe and catch tank
(Figure 25) which was provided to avoid problems from inadvertent over-
filling of the system or unexpected volume expansion. The catch tank is
torus-shaped and fits around the pump intake line immediately below the
pump bowl. The tank is 30 in. 0.D. x 18 in. I.D. x 27 3/4 in. tall. The
wall thickness is 1/2 in. and the annulus between the inner and outer walls
is 5 in. wide. The 1 1/2-in. pump bowl overflow pipe extends from the top
of the catch tank through the bottom of the pump bowl to 1 1/2 in. above
the normal fuel-salt level. The tank is supported from the pump support
with a system of movable plates that allow horizontal motion to accommodaté}

thermal effects.

2.5.6 Fuel-Salt and Flush-Salt Drain and Storage Tanks

 

The primary system is provided with two fuel-salt drain tanks and a
flush-salt drain tank located in a shielded cell adjacent to the reactor B
containment vessel. Figure 26 is a process flow sheet for the drain tanks;:
and their auxiliary systems. In addition, a fuel storage and reprocessing?
tank is located in the fuel-processing cell. It is described in Section.
2.7.

Each of the two fuel drain tanks (Figure 27) is 50 in. in diameter
and about 86 in. tall, not including the steam dome and has a fuel-salt
capacity of about 80 ft3. Each is equipped with thirty-two 1 1/2-in.
cooling thimbles. The steam dome which is mounted atop the tank (Figure
28) contains l-in.-diameter cooling fingers extending into each of the
thimbles. Water boiling in the inner l-in.-diameter fingers in the thim-
bles reﬁoved both residual and fission-product decay heat from fuel salt
store& in the tank. The steam was routed to an external condenser and the
condensate returned to the fingers in a closed loop. _

The flush-salt drain tank is also located in the drain-tank cell and

contained the flush salt used to cleanse the primary system prior to

charging it with fuel salt. This tank has the same dimensions as the - .
fuel drain tanks except for being 2 in. shorter. Since it has no cooling
thimbles, its salt storage capacity is about 2 fe3 greater than that of a
fuel drain tank.

Each of the three drain tanks is supported by two columns resting on
the cell floor. The columns are attached to support skirts welded to
tanks just above the upper head circumferential weld. An intermediate
supporting arrangement between the columns and skirts allowed the tanks
to be weighed by a pneumatically-operated weighing cell. The tare weight
of each of the fuel drain tanks is about 7,000 lbs; the fully loaded
weight is about 17,000 1bs.

The drain connection between the reactor vessel and the drain tanks
consists of a 1 1/2-in. Schedule 40 INOR-8 pipe which extends from the
bottom of the reactor vessel through the shield wall between the reactor
cell and the drain-tank cell where it connects to the l1-in. pipes leading
from the tops of the drain tanks. During operation of the reactor, the

drain tanks were sealed from it by freeze valves. -

2.6 Reactor Secondary System

The reactor secondary system consists of the tube side of the pri-
mary heat exchanger, the coolant circulating pump, the salt-to-air radiator,
the drain and fill system, and the interconnecting piping. The coolant

salt is similar to the fuel salt except that it contains no fissionable

materials. Figure 29 is the process flow diagram of the coolant system

and its auxiliary systems.

 

2.6.1 Heat Exchanger
The heat exchanger is described in Section 2.5.4.
2.6,2 Coolant Circulating Pump

The coolant-salt pump is of the same type and overall size as the
fuel-salt pump described in Section 2.5.3. It does not, however, have
an overflow tank. The pump is rigidly mounted in its own shielded cell i:

which is above the level of the other cells (Figures 7 and 13). .

2.6.3 Radiator

 

The radiator coil is an assembly of one-hundred twenty 30-ft-long -
"S"-shaped 3/4-in.-0.D. INOR-8 tubes (Figure 30) connected to vertical ) o
manifolds which, in turn, are connected to the 9-in.-0.D. inlet and outlet "
headers. The 5-in. Schedule 40 inlet line connects to the outlet from
the heat exchanger, and the 5~in. Schedule 40 outlet line goes directly
to the suction side of the pump.

The coil is enclosed in a housing (Figure 31) which is equipped with
vertically operated doors which regulated the air flow passing through
the coil and thereby the coolant-salt temperature. The total assembly is
mounted at the entrance of a double-walled steel duct leading to the 10 ft
diameter x 75 ft high steel heat-dump stack. Two 250-hp blowers supplied
the 200,000 cfm of air used to remove heat from the coil at the maximum
reactor power level of 10 MW. A separate cooling system used two 10-hp,
10,000-cfm blowers to supply air to the annulus around the duct. This was
necessary to prevent buckling and damage to adjacent concrete when the
coil exhaust air reached temperatures up to 1000°F under low-flow con-

ditions.
2.6.4 Secondary System Piping | .

Like that of the primary system, the secondary system piping is 5-in.
Schedule 40 INOR-8 pipe. The sections of inlet and outlet lines to
the heat exchanger which are within the reactor cell are about 36.3 ft and
32.4 ft long, respectively. The lengths and arrangement of the piping
both within and outside the reactor cell allowed it to accommodate thermal

expansion so that the pump and the radiator could be rigidly mounted.
2.6.5 Coolant Drain Tank

The coolant-salt drain tank is located in a shielded cell almost
directly below the radiator. The coolant~salt piping has low points on
each side of the radiator; a 1 1/2-in. drain line runs from each of these
to the drain tank.

The drain tank is 40 in. 0.D. and about 78 in. tall with a wall
thickness of 3/8 in. in the cylindrical portion. The dished heads are
5/8 in. thick. The tank and all its attachments are made of INOR-S8.

2.7 Fuel-Processing System

Other than the reactor primary system and its associated drain
tanks, the only other system that contained large quantities of both unir-
radiated and irradiated fuel salt at any time is the fuel-processing
system. The components of this system which contained fuel salt and/or
fission products are located in a below-grade-level concrete-shielded
cell just north of the drain-tank cell (Figures 6, 7, and 32). The two
purposes of the processing were to clean both new and used fuel salt of
oxides and water by sparging with hydrogen fluoride and to recover uranium
from used fuel salt by sparging with fluorine. A simplified flow diagram
of the system is shown in Figure 33. Figure 34 is a complete flow diagram
showing both the main system and its auxiliary systems.

The sparging tank, generally called the "fuel storage tank', is the
only component of the system that contained fuel salt. A 1/2-in. Schedule .
40 pipe from this tank to the fuel-salt and flush-salt storage tanks |
was used to transfer salt to and from the primary system. The tank
(Figure 35) is 50 in. 0.D. and 116 in. tall. 1Its cylindrical section is
1/2 in, thick and the dished heads are 3/4 in. thick. All parts are made
of INOR-8. It is mounted on a pneumatically-operated weighing cell sup-
ported from the cell floor.

Other large items in the fuel-processing cell include the NaF-filled
impurity trap (Figure 36) used to strip undesirable fluorides from UFg
during fluorination and the 42 in. diameter by 84 in. tall caustic scrub-
ber tank used for HF neutralization. The remaining items are small com-

ponents, piping, heaters, and insulation.

2.8 Freeze Flanges

Mechanical-type joints were provided in the 5-in. piping of
the fuel~ and coolant-salt system to permit the major components to be
disconnected remotely and removed for maintenance or replacement.. The
locations of the five flanged joints are shown in Figure 12.

As shown in Figure 37, the design of the flange utilized a large
diameter face as a heat sink to maintain a barrier of frozen salt to pro-

tect the gasket from contact with molten salt. Each flanged connection

also contains a leak detecting-buffer gas connection to the ring groove
area. The semicircular flange clamps are made of spring steel so that
they remain in place when forced around the flange with no bolting being
required. Figure 38 shows the installed guide arrangement for the clamps

and the simple type of tool required for their removal and installation.

2.9 Freeze Valves

The flow of molten salt in the drain, fill, and processing systems

was controlled by freezing or thawing a short plug of salt in a flattened

section of 1 1/2-in. pipe, called a "freeze valve". This method of valving

was necessary because no mechanical-type valve had been developed for
molten-salt service. These valves were closed (frozen) by a regulated
cooling-air flow through a shroud around the flattened section of pipe and
opened (thawed) by shutting off the air and applying electrical heat to
the valve. All valves, except the reactor drain valve, also contain a
volume tank located vertically nearby to always provide enough residual
salt in the line to form the salt plug.

There are twelve freeie valves in the reactor systems, all of which
are fabricated of 1 1/2-in. INOR~8 pipe. Six are installed in 1 1/2-in.
lines and six in 1/2-in. lines. One valve, which is in the reactor drain
gnd fill line is inside the reactor thermal shield, six are in the drain-
‘tank cell, three are in the fuel-processing cell, and two are in the

coolant cell. Figures 39, 40, 41, and 42 show the various arrangements

and details of the twelve valves. The locations of the valves with respect

to other equipment are shown in the process flow diagrams (Figures 11, 26,
29, and 34). |

2.10 Ssalt Syétems Heaters and Thermal Insulation

All salt-cohtaining components and pipes in the MSRE are thermally
insulated and equipped with electrical heaters capable of maintaining the

salt above the liquidus temperature of 850°F. Because of the diversity

of sizes, shapes, orientation, and accessibility of the items to be heated,

a variety of both heater types and insulating methods and materials were

used.

tems. Consequently, flexible leads and remotely operable disconnects were
required for each heater unit. This power feed system, the bulky heater and
insulation units along with their respective support structures constitute a

very large portion of the total contaminated material within these cells.
2.10.1 Reactor Furnace

The inside of the thermal shield which encloses the reactor vessel is
insulated to a builtup thickness of 6 in. with ceramic insulation covered
with 16-gage 304 stainless steel sheet. The ll-in.-wide annulus between
this insulation and the reactor contains electrical resistance-type heaters
to form a furnace surrounding the reactor.. The heaters are 126 vertical
lengths of 3/8-in.—0;D., 0.035-in.-thick-walled Inconel tubing, each
8 ft 7 1/2 in. to 9 ft 11 in. in length, through which electrical current
- was passed. The heater tubing is in the form of 63 U-tubes which are
'arranged in nine removable sections of seven U-tubes each. Each U-tube is
contained in a 2-in.-0.D., 0.06 —in.-thick wall 304 stainless steel thimble

which is suspended from the top cover of the thermal shield.

 

2.10.2 Fuel-Salt-Pump Furnace

The lower half of the pump bowl, a 3-ft-long section of the pump suction
line, and the overflow tank were a;l heated in a common furnace which is
51 1/2 in. 0.D. by 66 in. tall. The heaters are 3/4-in.-diameter straight
tubes of 304 stainless steel containing ceramic~positioned resistance heat-
‘ing elements at the lower ends. Five of the heaters are about 8 ft long and
nine are 7 ft long. These 3/4-in.-0.D. heaters are contained in 1-in.-0.D.
304 stainless steel tubes. All the heaters were installed in assemblies
with lifting bails to simplify replacement.

The outer walls and bottom of the furnace are 5-in.-thick ceramic
block insulation covered with 20-gage 304 stainless steel sheet. The fur-
nace is suspended from the fuel-pump support plates and moved with the pump
in response to thermal effects. The heater elements have collars which also

rest on the support plate.

2.10.3 Coolant-Salt-Pump Heaters and Insulation

Heat was applied to the coolant-salt pump bowl by fourteen 6 in. x
8 in. x 5/8 in. thick flat-plate ceramic heater units. Six of the heaters
are equally spaced at the bottom of the pump bowl and eight are arranged
vertically around the sides. The heaters are mounted in brackets in a 304
stainless steel basket which is hung by fourlhooks from the pump structure.
The outside of the heater basket is insulated ﬁith 4 in. of asbestos-

based insulation covered with asbestos finishing cement and glass cloth.

2.10.4 Fuel- and Flush-Salt-Drain-Tank Heaters and Insulation

 

The three drain tanks were heated by cylindrical furnaces made up of

insulated tanks with removable lids and removable heater units. The heaters
are located within the annuli between the drain tanks and furnace tanks.

Each furnace contains seven removable heater units spaced around its respec-

tive drain tank.

The outsides and bottoms of the furnaces are insulated by two 2-in.-
thick layers of asbestos-based insulation enclosed in l6-gage 347 stainless
steel. The removable furnace lids contain ceramic fibers as the insulating

material.
2.10.5 Fuel-Storage-Tank Heaters and Insulation

The fuel storage tank in the fuel-processing cell was heated by four
sets of heaters at the bottom, the lower half, the upper half, and the top.

Each heater had an installed spare and was not replaceable. The top and

side heaters are tubular, and the bottom heater is made up of flat ceramic-

plate units. The heaters are enclosed in 6 in. of asbestos-based insulation

finished with fiber glass cloth and insulating cement.

2.10.6 Coolant-Salt-Drain-Tank Heaters and Insulation

 

The coolant-salt drain tank was heated on the sides by thirty-two
0.315 in. 0.D. x 74 in. long tubular heating units and on the bottom by

sixteen flat ceramic heater plates.
70

The tank is insulated by a 5-in.~thick layer of ceramic-block insu-
lation applied over a 20-gage 304L stainless steel shell which séparates-
~ the insulation from the heaters. The insulation is. finished with fiber

glass cloth and insulating cement.
2.10.7 Heat-Dump Radiator Heaters and Insulation

The radiator coil is mounted in an insulated steel enclosure equipped
with large (8 ft tall by 11 ft wide) insulated vertically operated doors
- on the inlet and outlet sides of the coil. Heating was provided by 60
tubular heaters mounted vertically 3 1/2 in. apart across both faces of
the coil. These range in length from 48 in. to 102 in. The top and
bottom of the coil were heated by sixty 18 in. long by 7 1/2 in., wide flat
ceramic heater plates attached to steel baffle plates. The inlet and out-
let salt headers were heated by a total of forty-~two 4 in. by 12 in. flat
ceramic heater plates enclosed with 20-gage 304 stainless steel cans.

All the inside surfaces of the enclosure including the doors are
covered with’insulating ceramic block or insulating board and protected
with a sheath of 1l6-gage stainless steel where air erosion could be a

problem.
+2.10.8 Piping Heaters and Insulation

The heater types and insulating methods for the salt-bearing piping
depended primarily upon location and accessibility. All horizontal sections
of the fuel-salt and coolant~salt 5-in. pipes within the reactor cell
and‘the 1l 1/2-1in. drain lines in the drain-tank cell are equipped with
removable combined heater and reflective insulation modules as shown in
Figure 43. These contain molded ceramic heater plates arranged to heat
the top and sides of the pipe and rest upon permanently installed insu-
lated bases. The reflective metal insulation consists of nine layers of
0.006-in.-thick stainless steel and one 0.002-in.-thick layer of pure
silver encased in a stainless steel shell. The vertical leg of the fuel-
salt pipe jdst below the heat exchanger has permanently installed tubular
heaters covered with reflective insulation.

was heated by passing an electric current through the line itself. This por-

tion is insulated with permanently installed asbestos-based insulation.

Most of the 1 1/2-in.-diameter piping in the drain-tank cell was
heated and reflective insulated with the removable modular units. The
remainder, including the line to the fuel-processing cell, were heated
with tubular heaters and insulated with permanently installed asbestos-
based insulation.

All salt-bearing pipes in the fuel-processing cell were heated with
permanently installed tubular heaters and insulated with asbestos.

All the coolant-salt-bearing piping in the coolant and radiator
enclosures were heated by tubular heaters strapped to the pipes under

asbestos-based insulation.
2.10.9 Heat-Exchanger Heaters and Insulation

The heat exchanger was heated and insulated with removable modular

heating and reflective insulating units of the same type used for the 5-in.-

diameter pipes except that they were made to fit the 16-in.-0.D. shell.

2.10.10 Heater and Thermocouple Leads

 

The heater electrical supply leads within the reactor cell and drain-
tank cell are 1/2- and 3/8-in.-0.D., copper sheathed, mineral-insulated
multiconductor cables having flexible sections between the cable terminus
and the heater connector. The flexible length is made with ceramic-beaded
nickel alloy wire sheathed in 3/4-in.-0.D. flexible stainless steel hose.
The reactor cell contains 79 cables ranging in length from 5 to &15 ft
long, and the drain-tank cell contains 88 cables of about the same length
range. The flexible power leads terminate at junction boxes or disconnect
boxes that are conveniently located throughout the cells. A transition
from the flexible leads to the copper-sheathed cables is made at these
boxes. The cables then are routed via cable trays to the containment cell
penetratioﬁslﬂ‘Tﬁéfhéater power cable system constitutes a large volume
of material dispersed throughout the entire volume of the cells.

There are ovér 1,050 thermocouples installed in the MSRE. A prepon-
derance of these are installed on the salt-containing components and

piping. In all cases, except as noted below, the thermocouples are duplex,

I

mineral-insulated chromel-alumel wires in a 1/8-in.-0.D. Inconel sheath.
The thermocouples are attached to lugs on the surface of the pipe and com-

ponents by means of a small welded tab. The leads are strapped to the

 pipe or component and are routed in bundles to exit points from the insu-

lation and on to disconnect locations. The number, routing, and manner

of attachment of the thermocouples will present problems to be dealt with
when considering methods of removal. A few 1/16-in.-0.D. mineral-insulated,
Inconel-sheathed singie-conductor leads were used in special power moni-
toring and safety temperature measuring thermocouples. These are located
only on the réactor outlet nozzle and on the radiator inlet and outlet
headers.

Transition from the Inconel-sheathed couple leads to multiconductor,
mineral-insulated, copper-sheathed cables was made at conveniently located
disconnect boxes within the cells. The copper-sheathed cables were routed
via cable trays to cell penetration points. ' The total_system including
leads; cables, disconnects, support structures, trays, and junction boxes
constitutes a large volume of material that is dispersed over the entire

cell areas.

2.11 Sampler-Enricher

The fuel-salt and coolant-salt pump bowls and the fuel storage tank
in the fuel-processing cell are equipped with 1 1/2-in. Schedulé 40 access
pipes extending to shielded enclosures above the respective cells (Figure
44). These were used for taking samples of the salts as required for
analyses and for adding fuel, or other salt constituents, to the salts
during operation. The samples wére taken simply by loweriﬁg open capsules

attached to cables through the access pipes into the salt contained in the

}pump bowls and raising them through appropriate containment seals into

shielded transfer casks. Enrichment was accomplished by lowering a cap-
sule filled with concentrated fuel salt into the fuel pump bowl and
allowing the salt to melt out. _

The access pipes are about 14 ft long and have a bellows-sealed
expansion joint at about mid-length. The portion of the pipes below the

expansion joint is INOR-8 and the portion above it is 304 stainless steel.

The fuel-salt sampler-enricher is a complex mechanical, electrical,
and pneumatic system, heavily shielded and contained, and is equipped
for remote loading into and unloading the capsules from the sampler mecha-
nism and for transferring the capsules between the sampler containment

and shielded transport carriers. Since the sampler mechanism was alter-

‘nately exposed to the pump bowl atmosphere and to the sampler containment

enclosure as well és to the exposed salt in the capsules, all equipment
inside the enclosure is highly contaminated with fission products.

The coolant-salt sampler is a far simpler manually-actuated
system with appropriate interlocking buffer zones which did not reqﬁi;e
heavy shielding.

The fuel storage tank in the fuel-processing cell is equipped with a
shielded sampler system similar to that for the fuel pump bowl but less
complex. Since it wés used infrequently and was not subject to deposition
of daughter products of short-lived fission-product géses, it is far less

contaminated than the brimary system sampler-enricher.

_2.12 Nuclear Instrumeﬁtation

Nuclear instrumentation ionization chambers were accommodated by a
single 3-ft-diameter slanted thimble shown in Figures 45 and 46. The lower
end of the thimble is welded to the reactor cell containment shell and the

upper end is embedded in earth fill and concrete. A bellows-type expansion

. joint between these regions accommodates thermal expansion and contraction.

The thimble contains four 5-in.-I.D. and six 4;in.-I.D; guide tubes
for ionizatibn chambers. These tubes are supported by four bulkheads
appropriately spaced aiong the length of the thimble.

For shielding and cooling purposes the thimble was kept full of water.
The water contained dissolved lithium nitrite and lithium borate which
served as a corrosion inhibitor and enhanced the neutron-shielding prop-
erties of the water. A dip tube terminating at the bottom of the thimble
allowed a small pump to circulate the water to minimize thermal gradients

and keep the corrosion inhibitor evenly dispersed.

2.13 Accessory Systems

In addition to the salt-containing systems, eleven accessory systems
required the use of piping or ducts either within the containment cells
or connected to them. These were: (1) the cover-gas system; (2) the leak-
detector system; (3) two component-cooling systems; (4) the cooling-water
system; (5) two lubricating-oil systems; (6) the off-gas disposal system;
(7) the containment ventilation system; (8) the liquid-waste system; and

(9) the instrument air system.
2.13.1 Cover-Gas System

The cover-gas system supplied purified helium for use as an inert
gas above the fuel and coolant salts in the pump bowls and drain tanks,
as a carrier for removing fission-product gases from the system, as a
‘pressure source for transferring salt froﬁ one vessel to anbther, as a
means of pressure control in the salt systems, and as a cover gas for oil
storage tanks in the fuel and coolant-salt pump lubricating systems. In
addition, a part of the helium purge through the pump bowls and the fuel-
pump overflow tank was introduced through bubbler lines to measure the
salt depths. All helium was discharged from the various systems to the
off-gas disposal system; none was recycled.

Pressure monitoring and flow controi instruments for the fuel-salt-
pump cover-gas connections were located within containment enclosures
located outside the reactor containment cell with individual 1/4-in.-0.D.
stainless steel lines encased with 1/2-in. Schedule 40 pipe penetrating
the cell wall and connection to the pump. One line introduced the main
purge flow at the labrynth seal on the pump shaft. Two lines entering
the top of the pump bowl and terminating at the bottom of the bowl served
as salt-level-monitor bubblers. One line entering the top of the bowl was
used as the reference pressure tap for the bubbler system. Three similar
lines to the overflow tank were used to measure its salt level in the same
manner. The coolant-salt pump bowl is also equipped with two bubbler
tubes, a reference tube, and a purge supply tube.

Helium is also supplied to each of the three tanks in the drain-tank

celllby 1/4-in. stainless steel tubes in 1/2-in. stainless steel pipe and
79 .

in a similar manner to the fuel-processing system. The gas was used as
the cover atmosphere for stored salt and to pressurize the tanks to trans-
fer molten salt out of the tanks.

The cover-gas system supplies helium for the gas volume in the oil
storage tanks in the salt-pump 1ubricéting systems and provides purge

gas for the fuel and coolant samplers and the graphite sampling equipment.

2.13.2 Leak-Detector System

 

A leak-detector system using pressurized helium was used to monitor
all pipe flanges where leaks could have caused the escape of radioactive
materials or could have caused leakage of coolants or lubricants important
to operation and safety. Another use of the system was to show when
remotely coupled flanges were properly sealed. Figure~47 illustrates the
use of the pressurized gas to check the leak-tightness of gasket seals.
The helium was supplied from the cover-gas system through 1/4-in.-0.D.
stainless steel tubing having a wall thickness of 0.083 in. All important

‘pipe flanges in the reactor and drain-tank cells have one to two lines of

the leak-detector system connected to them, depending upon whether they
were individually monitored or were a part of a monitored group. Through-
out the reactor system and its accessory systems, V100 flanges were gas-

monitored.

 

2.13.3 Lubricating-0il Systems

Both the fuel-salt and coolant-salt pump bearing assemblies were
lubricated and cooled with forced-flow oil systems. The oil reservoir
tanks and the pumps are located in the shielded east tunnel. All oil
piping to the pumps is Schedule 40 stainless steel. A 3/4-in. pipe
delivered oil to the fuel-pump bearings, and a second 3/4-in. pipe supplied
0il to cool a shield block located between the pump bowl and motor. A
1/2-in. pipe connecting the gas space in the o0il reservoir to the pump
bearing assembly equalized the pressure between the two regions. The oil
supplied to the bearing and shield block combined to return to the reservoir
through a single 1l-in. pipe. The small amount of o0il that leaked downward
past the labrynth seal below the bearing was swept by helium from the cover-

gas supply into a 1/2-in. line that carried it to a shielded catch tank

in the special equipment room. Because of the low flow rate through this
pipe, it is shielded with 1 1/2 in. of lead to reduce radiation damage

to the oil. The éoolant salt pumps have the same arrangement of piping
from their lubricating oil supply except that the 1/2-in. line to the catch

tank is not lead-shielded.

2.13.4 Component—-Cooling Systems

The reactor-cell and drain~tank-cell atmosphere gas was circulated
through an external cooling system and returned to the cells through a

distribution system to cool freeze valves, the upper part of the fuel pump

bowl, the control-rod drives, the graphite sampler nozzle, the ipéide and

outside of the reactor access nozzle, and the off-gas exhaust line. The
external equipment consists of two 75-hp positive;diSplacement blowers
sealed in 6-ft~diameter, 8-ft-tall steel containment tanks located in the
adjoining special equipment room. The containment tanks are connected by
10-in.~-diameter pipes to a 30-in.~diameter containment ventilation pipe
which, in turn, is connected to the reactor cell containment vessel., Supply
gas for the blowers was taken from inside the containment tanks. The dis-
charge from the blowers passed through a vertical 8-in.-diameter, 9-ft-long,
shell-and-tube, water-cooled heat exchanger also located in the special
equipment rooﬁ. The gas then flowed to a 6-in.-diameter header in the
reaétor cell from which it was distributed to the components to be cooled.
The lines to the pump bowl and the off-gas exhaust line are 3-in.-diameter
pipe; the line to the reactor drain freeze valve is 1 1/4 in. in diameter;
the line to the control-rod drives i1s 1 in. in diameter; and the lines to
the reactor access nozile, the graphite samplér nozzle, and the freeze
valves in the drain-tank cell are all 3/4 in. in diameter. After cooling
the several components, the gas discharged directly back to the cell atmo-
sphere and then returned to the blower suction via the cell containment
ventilation line.

The freeze valves in the coolant and fuel-processing cells were cooled
by atmospheric air supplied by a 5-hp positive displacement blower located
in the blower house at the southwest cbrner of the reactor building. The
supply header from this blower 1s 3-in.-diameter pipe. The distribution

lines to the two freeze valves in the coolant cell are l-in.-diameter carbon
82

steel, and those to the three freeze valves .in the fuel-processing cell are
3/4-in.-diameter carbon steel. After passing over the surfaces to be
cooled, the air discharged directly to the cell atmosphere was then

exhausted through the cell containment ventilation system.

2.13.5 Cooling-Water System

 

The cooling-water system is made up of two parts: the cooling-tower
water system and a closed treated-water system cooled by the cooling-tower
water. | . |

The cooling-tower water system was cooled by a forced-draft cooling
tower located southwest of the reactor building. From the cooling-tower
basin, water was circulated by either of two 547-gpm pumps to the treated-
water heat exchanger, the fuel-salt and coolant-salt pump lubricating-oil
reservoirs, the two fuel-drain-tank steam condensers, the coolant cell
coolers, the fuel—prdcessing caustic scrubber and hydrogen-fluoride trap
cooling coils, the charcoal beds in the off-gas dispersal system, and the
steam condenser that supplie& makeup condensate for the treated-water system.
It was also used to cool other items not directly related to the reactor
system. All the piping in this system is carbon steel.

The treated-water system is a closed cooling system filled with steam
condensate to which a corrosion inhibitor was added. This system was used
to cool equipment in which it was possible for the water to become radio-
actively contaminated. The water was circulated by either of two 320-gpm
pumps located in the blower house at the sduthwest corner of the reactor
building. The water passed through the tubé side of a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger located in the diesel house to a header from where it was piped
to the items to be cooled. The return lines terminate in a common header
leading to the pump suction side. A surge tank connected to the system was
used for volume control, makeup, and for a&ding the chemical corrosion
inhibitor. |

Treated water was use& to cool the reactor thermal shield, the fuel-
salt and coolant-salt pump motors, the two reactor cell air coolers, the
draiﬁ-tank—cell air coolers, the nuclear instrumentatiQﬁ access thimble,

and the component-cooling systems gas heat exchanger and blower lubricating
.
@

83

oil system. The in-cell piping for this system is stainless steel ranging
from 1 in. to 3 in. depending upon the flow requirements.

All water lines penetrating the containment cells contained check
valves on thg inlet leg and a pneumatic safety block valve on the exit
leg with a rﬁpture disc relief to the vapor condensing system attached to
the trapped volume. The thermal shield cooiant return line contained a

degassing system for the removal of radiolytic gases.

2.13.6 O0Off-Gas Disposal System

 

The off-gas disposal system handled three types of gas flow: (1) a
continuous ‘discharge of helium and gaseous fission products“from the fuel-
salt pump'bowl; (2) intermittent discharges of contaminated helium during
s&lt-transfer operations; and (3) flows of up to 100 cfm of cell atmosphere.
The first two of these off-gas flows passed through a complex system of ‘
holdups, filters, and absorbers and were extensively monitored for activit&zr
prior to being discharged into the containment ventilation system effluent"

upstream of the final filters and stack discharge. The ejected cell gas

. was routed, after monitoring, directly to the containment ventilation

connection.

Helium sweep gas and gaseous fission products were drawn from the fuel
pump bowl and overflow tank through 1/2-in. stainless steel pipes which
merge and connect to a 4-in. pipe a short distance from the pump. This
4-in. pipe with a serpentine section is routed around the inside surface
of the reactor cell with a total length of 68 ft providing a holdup volume
of about 6 ft3 and a gas residence time of about one hour. The line con-
tinues then as 1/2-in. pipe through the cell wall penetration and then as
1/4-in. stainless steel pipe through the coolant drain-tank cell to a
sealed instrument box in the ventilation house. After passing through
pressure-control and monitoring systems, the line is joined by the 1/2-in.
Schedule 40 line from the fuél-pump seal and continues as 1/4-in. stainless
steel pipe to a second holdup volume in the charcoal-trap cell.

The charcoal-trap cell is a 10 ft diameter by 22.7 ft deep pit made of
reinforced concrete with a 3-ft-thick removable concrete cover. The cell
was kept filled with ﬁater, supplied by the cooling-tower water system, to

remove the decay heat from fission products trapped by the charcoal.
84

The second holdup volume consists of éix 19.8-ft lengths of 3-in.
pipe arranged as close-packed vertical "U" bends connected in séfies.

From the holdup volume, a 1/2-in. stainless steel pipe leads to the main
charcoal-trap ménifold., The main charcoal trap consiéts of four parallel
charcoal-filter sections each of which is made up of 80 ft of 1 1/2-in.
stainless steel pipe, 80 ft of 3;in. stainless steel pipe, and 80 ft of
6-in. stainless steel pipe arranged as compact vertical "U'" bends con-
nected in series. The weight of charcoal in each section is 725 1bs.

From the charcoal traps, a 1/2-in. stainless steel pipe'connects to a
1 1/2-in. pipe in the ventilation house. This line leads to the
containment ventilation system particulate filter enclosure where the gas
was filtered and diluted by flows from otﬁér areas before being dischgrged
to the atmosphere through a 100-ft-tall steel stack by one of two 21,000-
scfm fans. _

One-quarter-inch or 1/2-in.-diameter stainless steel off-gas pipes
connected to each of the fuel-salt drain tanks, the graphite sampler, the
sampler-enricher, the coolant pump bowl and shaft seal, the lubricating-
0oil reservoirs, the coolant-salt drain tank, and the reactor and drain-
tank cells allowed these items to be continuously or intermittently purged
to the off-gas system. Those items which did not normally contain radio-
active gases but could under abnormal conditions were vented, past monitors,
directly to the particulate-filter enclosure. The fuel drain tanks and
flush-salt tank were normally vented through the auxiliary charcoal trap
located in the charcoal-trap cell but could be valved to discharge through
the reactor cell holdup volume and thence to the main charcoal traps.

The auxiliary charcoal trap consists of two vertical ~19-ft-tall "U"
bends, made of 6-in. stainless steel pipe, which are connected in series.
The trap contains 530 1bs of charcoal. The discharge from the trap merges
with the discharge line from the main charcoal traps ahead of the

particulate-filter enclosure.

2.13.7 Containment Ventilation System.

 

In addition to receiving and diluting-the reactor off-gas discharge,
as previously discussed, the containment véntilation system provided a

continuous flow of air or maintained a negative pressure through all areas

 
85

where radiocactive or beryllium contamination was likely to occur other
than the reactor and drain-tank cells. During maintenance operations,
however, this system was used to provide 100 linear feet per minute in-
flow through openings in the reactor and drain-tank cells made by removing
séctions of the top shields.

A system of steel ducts from the stack area draws air from the reac-
tor building through the six smaller shielded cells, the electric ser-
vice areas, transmitter room, service tunnel, special equipment room, and
coolant cell and from the main high-bay area. Air is also exhausted from
the ventilation house and charcoal-bed cell by this system. Many'small
containment enclosures were either exhausted or maintained at negative
pressures by this system.

Alr flow through the system is induced by either of two 21,000-cfm
centrifugal fans located at the base of the 100-ft-tall steel discharge
stack. Before discharge up the stack, the air passes through roughing andﬂl;
high-efficiency filters. ;

The connection to the combined reactor and drain-tank cells is a
30-in.-diameter duct leading from the bottom of the southwestern sector of
the reactor cell containment vessel. This duct was normally kept closed By
two motor-operated butterfly valves installed in series. Negative pressufe.
in the sealed cells was maintained by discharging a small portion of the )
recirculating component-cooling-system flow to the off-gas system.

Figure 48 is a schematic flow diagram of the containment ventilation

system.
2.13.8 Liquid-Waste System

Not including the sanitary sewer system, the MSRE building énd its
auxiliary structures have three waste water accumulation containers
(Figure 49) equipped with appropriate volume and radiation monitors and
with discharge pumps which route the waste water either‘to the ORNL radio-
active liquid-waste treatment system or to a drainage ditch.

Water discharged by steam- or air-operated jet-type ejectors from
the reactdr cell, the drain—tank cell, and the auxiliary cells and water
from decontamination sinks flowed directly to an ll-ft~diameter, 16-ft-
tall, 11,000-gallon stainless steel waste storage tank located in the

liquid-waste cell. A 140-gpm pump located in the remote maintenance
practice cell is used to dischargé accumulated water from the tank to the
ORNL liquid-waste treatment system.

A 42 in., diameter by 50 in. tall stainless steel filter tank is also
located in the liquid-waste cell. The filter is a 34-in.-deep bed con-
sisting of graded sand and gravel. The intended purpose of this filter
was to clarify water circulated through a decontamination tank proposed
for the decontamination cell. The decontamination tank, however, was
never installed due to lack of need.

A3 ft by 3 ft by 8 ft deep sump in the below-grade 8 ft by 16 ft by
-7 ft high sump room located at the northeast corner of the special equip-
ment room (Figure 6) is the lowest point of the MSRE complex and is used
to collect normally uncontaminated waste water from all areas of the MSRE
complex. These include the radiator air-duct floor, the blower house,
blower-house ramp, west tunnel, service room, service tunnel, coolant cell,
ventilation house valve pit, and French drains from the building founda-
tions and charcoal-trap cell. Water from this sump is discharged by either
of two 75-gpm pumps, located in the sump room, to a 2 ft by 3 ft by 6 ft
deep concrete catch basin located just west of the charcoal-trap cell. From
the catch basin, the water drains through a 150-ft-long, l2-in.-diameter
reinforced concrete pipe to a drainage ditch.

A 55-gallon stainless steel ‘drum located in the sump room was used to
collect drainage from the ventilation stack base and from the filter pit
since water from these sources could be contaminated. The drum was equipped
with a continuous radiation detector alarm as well as a high liquid level
alarm. Each batch of accumulated liquid was sampled prior to being trans-
ferred via a 200-gpm pump, also located in the sump room, from the drum to
either the liquid-waste storage tank or directly to the catch basin,

depehding upon whether the water was contaminated or not.

2.14 Vapor Condensing System

As illustrated in Figure 50, the MSRE is equipped with a vapor con-
densing system to accommodate overpressurization of the reactor containment

cell in the event of a catastrophic accident that caused mixing of hot fuel

salt and the water used in the cell for cooling and shielding. This
equipment, consisting primarily of a vertical underground water tank and
a shielded horizontal gas storage tank, is located about 60 ft from the
southeast corner of the MSRE building. A 12-in.-diameter carbon ‘steel
line from the system ties into the 30-in. reactor cell ventilation pipe
just upstream from the normally closed butterfly val§es. Rupture discs
in the main 12-in. line and the 4-in. bypass- line are designed to rupture
at 20 psi and 15 psi, respectively, to cause the system to respond auto-
matically to overpressurization of the reaétor cell and to require that
the smaller-diameter path be opened first to reduce the dynamic impact on

the condensing tank.

3. MSRE PRESENT CONDITIONS

From shutdown of the MSRE in 1969 until now, portions of the reactor
system have undergone considerable change from the original operating
conditions. These changes will not, however, significantly affect the
effort required for decommissioning. Beginning at shutdown: (1) all
systems were secured or modified for safe standby; (2) a post-operation
examination program was initiated; (3) the system was placed under a con-

tinuing surveillance program; (4) excess material and equipment removal

began; and (5) nonhazardous building space was made available for offices,

shops, and laboratories for research and maintenance groups.

3.1 Securing the Process Systems

In general, preparing for safe standby involved deactivation of

process systeﬁs so as to minimize surveillance and to prevent mishaps due

to freezing, fire, or rain in-leakage; securing the primary system to safe-

guard the salt solutions, including the 233y fuel; and protecting against
radiation and contamination hazards. The salts were all stored in their
respective drain tanks; the cooling water systems were drained, and lines
penetrating the containment cells were disconnected and blanked at the
cell walls; the cbvér—gas system and other service lines were disconnected
and blanked at penetrations; process electrical systems were deactivated

and circuits locked open; the instrument and service air systems were shut

down and temporary gas supplies (nitrogen cylinders) were installed at
necessary locations; selected radiation monitors with local indicator
alarms were retained and remote alarms installed at the ORNL Waste Moni-
toring Center; selected temperature sensors from the stored salt and cell
atmosphere were tied into a local recorder-indicator; and the off-gas and
containment ventilation systems were retained complete with the radia-
tion and flow monitoring of the stack flow with remote alarms to the Waste

Monitoring Center added.

3.2 Post-Operation Examination

The post-operation examination program was for inspection of the pri-
mary system and for obtaining material specimens for technical evaluation.

The sampler-enricher capsule cage was excised from the fuel pump bowl
for examination. This operation required the cutting loose or displacing
of auxiliary lines and equipment for access. All the loose items, as well
as many of the contaminated tools used fbr the excisions, remain at the
pump bowi area or were dropped to the cell floor. A patch was fabricated
and installed to.seal the pump opening. | |

Specimens were removed from the heat exchanger shell and from the tube
bundle. An oval-shaped patch of about 10 in. x 12 in. was cut out near
the top center of the shell. Sections of tubing were removed through this
opening. The hole through the shell was sealed by remotely welding a
patch over the opening. Since this cutting provided communication between
the fission-product-laden fuel-salt loop to the coolant-salt loop, the
5-1in. cooiant-salt lines were cut and seal-welded immediately outside the

cell wall. All the loose material, heaters, etc., along with many of the

. tools used for this job remain in the vicinity of the heat éxchénger.

Control-rod poison elements, 7/8-in. graphite sampler holder and
specimens, and a 2-in. graphite bar were removed from the reactor core.
This job required taking loose and displacing the graphite sampler con-
tainment tank, the control-rod drives, control-rod-drive shielding and
supports, the control-rod and reactor nozzle cooling air lines and thermo-
couple and heater disconnects and supports to gain access to the 10-in.
reactor access nozzle flange. The core access plug, containing the graphite

sampler flange, its holddown mechanism, and the control-rod thimbles, was
92

removed and suspended alongside the thermal shield. Other items are atop
the thermal shield or were dropped to the cell floor. The reactor was
sealed by placing a plain 10-in. blind stainiess steel flange on the
access nozzle. | _' '

In the drain-tank cell, two freeze valves were removed and heaters,
leads, and service lines were again moved for access. The open lines were
'sealed using mechanical plugs. |

The post-operation examination was performed in the fall of 1970,
approximately one year after shutdown of tﬁe reactor. The radiation level
had decreased tremendously from that encountered during maintenance while
the reactor wés still operable. All jobs were performed in the reactor
cell using the dry maintenance shield without the need for tool shielding
bushings in the access holes. The maximum radiation level above the shield
through a 6-in.-diameter hole was 125 mr/hf at the hole 0peﬁing at the
beginning of the work. The maintenance shield was not required in the
drain-tank cell. The work there was performed through a 2 ft x 10 ft
lower roof plug opening. |

A heavy accumulation of dust (v1/2 in. deep on flat surféces) inside
both containment cells was easily handled by flushing the dust to the cell
floor using an ordinary water hose. By keeping the work areas wetted, no
contaminated dust was allowed to escape the containment cells.

At the completion of the post-dperatiﬁn work, the primary system was
leak-tested to ensure that the patches were secure. The cell shielding
blocks and seal membrane were replaced and the containment ce;ls leak-

tested.

3.3 Surveillance

After futher instrument modification ;nd final shutdown of auxiliaries,
the MSRE was placed under a surveillance pfog:am as described in ORNL-TM-
3253, MSRE Procedures for the Period Betwéen Examination and Ultimate
Disposal, dated February 10, 1971. Thislaocument describes the condition
of the MSRE and specifies procedures to be followed after the post-
operation examinations and before the ultimate disposal of the fissile and
radioactive material in the reactor. The fuel salt has been kept frozen

in the sealed drain tanks, within the sealed containment cell. Surveillance
93

has been by remote monitoring and daily visits by ORNL personnel, with
monthly and annual checks by technical personnel. Remedial actions are
prescribed for any abnormal condition. Personnel access is controlled by
security fencing around the area as well as specific areas locked to pre-
vent unauthorized entry. Procedures and responsibilities for maintenance,

modification, and removal of surplus equipment are also specified.

3.4 Surplus Equipment Removal

All MSRE equipment except the items required‘for’surveillance of the
stored fuel and the fuel removal chemical-processing plant were placed on
a published list and made available to other projects. Surplus mechanical
supplies were all moved out, and the process computer was transferred to
the Tennessee Valley Authority's Bull Run Steam Plant.

A large portion of the process instrumentation was removed and used
by other ORNL projects. The coolant-salt pump and piping were removed and
used by research groups in continuing molten-salt development work. All
the remaining noncontaminated process equipment has been declared 'excess in
place'" and is available to others through the ORNL Operations Division.

The coolant-salt piping and pump was the only surplus equipment removal
that has affected the decommissioning study. The pump, pump support plate,
and the 5-in. piping outside the reactor cell were removed. Thé radiator,
sampler and drain-tank systems, including the coolant salt, remain in
place along with all the auxiliary systems. Other items removed, such as
process instrumehtation, were primarily from clear areas and have no

significant effect on the decommissioning effort.

3.5 Site Utilization

Peripheral areas at the site have been and are now being utilized by
other Léboratory groups. The office wing (Bldg. 7509) is occupied by a
research group; the shop building (Bldg. 7515) is used as an area mainte-
nance shop; the reactor building (Bldg. 7503) offices, high bay, and spare
experiment cells have been used by research groups; the stores building
(Bldg. 7507) is used for equipment storage; and the reactor building change

house and sanitary facilities are used by all personnel at the site.
94

3.6 Current Radiation and Contamination Levels

Periodic radiation and contamination surveys are conducted within
the site area, and all movement of personnel or eduipment into or out of
the controlled access areas 1is monifored by the Health Physics Division.
No spread of contamination or radiation exposure has occurred since the
reactor was shut down.

The results of radiation surveys made in January and February of
1977 with an lonization chamber are shown iﬁ Table 3.

Measurements made in the reactor vessel at the top of the graphite
with a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) indicate a radiation level of
2,200 R/hr. A measurement made at the top of the access flange with a
TLD indicates a radiation level of 264 R/hr. Measurements made at the
top of the graphite with bare and lead-covered TLD's indicate that the
effective ténth—value layer for radiation in that area is 1.4 in. of lead.
Measurements made at a port over the reactor vessel at working level with a
Cutie-Pie indicate that the effective tenth-value layer for the radiation
beam through that port is also 1.4 in. of iead. Measurements made with |
a Cutie-Pie at the top of the opening in the top shield above the reactor
vessel indicate that the effective tenth-value layer for the radiation

through the opening is also 1.4 in. of lead.

4. DECOMMISSIONING ALTERNATIVES

Two alternatives have been considered for decommissioning the MSRE,
These are: (1) removal of all radioactive material except the containment
cell walls; and (2) entombment, in concrete, of all radioactive materials
at the site within the reactor containment cell.

For both decommissioning alternatives, it is assumed that the fuel
and flush salts have been removed from the drain tanks prior to starting
the decommissioning. A study and cost estimate for disposal of the salts
have been reported by P. N. Haubenreich aﬁ& R. B. Lindauver in ORNL CF-72-1-1,
"Consideration of Possible Methods of Disposal of MSRE Salts", dated
January 28, 1972. At present, a total of 4,650 kg of solidified fuel salt

is stored in the two fuel drain tanks in the drain-tank cell. Also,

4,290 kg of solidified flush salt is stored in a third tank in the same
cell. The fuel salt contains 30.8 kg of 233U and the flush salt 0.49 kg.

The cost estimates for both of the decomﬁissioning methods studied
include the assumption that an operating solid-waste disposal area exists
in the immediate vicinity. If the radioactive and contaminate& materials
must be packaged for shipment to a disposal site outside the ORNL area,
the packaging and shipping costs will be greatly increased, requiring a
new methods study and cost estimate.

It is also assumed that knowledgeable, experienced personnel will be
availablé to supervise and participate in the decommissioning activities.
If this is not true, the man-hours expended can increase significantly.
due to lack of familiarity with the reactor components and methods of

working with them.

4.1 Removal and Disposal of All Radioactive Material
Except the Containment Cell Structure
The first alternative involves cutting out, packaging, and trans-
porting to a solid-waste storage area all contaminated and radioactive
materials in the reactor cell, drain-tank cell, fuel-processing cell,
and portions of the gaseous-waste disposal system. The cell structures,

including the lower tier of shielding blocks over the reactor cell and

~ drain-tank cells, may be left intact for future use. Induced radio-

activity in the carbon steel walls of the reactor cell are expected to be
very low due to the neutron shielding provided by the thermal shield
which completely surrounds the reactor except for the instrumentation
thimble. Any areas of the cell wall found to have objectionable levels of
induced fadioactivity can be overlaid with fixed shielding after final

"decontamination.

A summary of work required and a cost estimate for this alternative

are given in Section 5. A detailed job listing is given in Appendik A.

4,2 Entombment in Place

The second alternative is to entomb, in concrete, all radioactive
and contaminated items within the reactor containment cell. The site and

the remaining containment cells could then be put to other uses with
98

esséntially no restrictions. This method of decommissioning is far less
expensive than dismantling and will provide complete containment indefi-
nitely. Entombment of 233y-contaminated méterials in solid;concrete,
however, violates the present requirement that such materials be stored in
a retrievable manner and will require a special permit as implied by ERDA'
Manual Chapter 0511.

This method will invqlve a minimal amount of remote cutting. Alli
pipes and conduits entering the cell through penetrations will be sevefed
inside the cell and cut back about 1 ft. Penetrations will be removed
where radioactive contamination is present and the openings sealed and
filled with concrete. Some cutting and collapsing of in-cell piping will
be necessary to ﬁermit the emptied drain tanks and the fuel—processing_
équipment to be added before entombing. The cell will then be filled with
concrete to the building floor level to prbvide a ﬁinimum thickness of
14 ft of concrete over the highest part of the reactor vessel.

A summary of work required and a cost estimate of this alternative

are given in Section 6. A detailed job liéting is given in Appendix B.

4.3 Arguments Favoring Dismantling and Disposal
of Radioactive and Contaminated Items

1. The MSRE is remote from populated areas and near a solid-waste storage
site so that transport of radioactive items to the storage site can
be accomplished with minimal shielding and with little risk to non-
involved personnel even in the event of a transport accident. The
233y-contaminated material will be packaged within‘%1,500 drums of
55-gallon capacity (v13,000 ft3) and 31 spécial containers of various
sizes (13,000 ft3).

2. Removal of the ?33U-contaminated items to retrievable storage will
meet the requirements for disposal of this type material.

3. Emptying the containment cells of all MSRE-related items will release

the facility for future usages requiring such cells.

 
99

4.4 Arguments Favoring Entombing the Reactor and
Associated Radiocactive and Contaminated Items
and Materials in the Reactor Cell

1. Entombment in concrete is far more economical than dismantling and
storage.
2. The transport of radioactive and contaminated items would be avoided.

3. A major portion of the building and cells would be released for other

usages.

5. WORK. INVOLVED IN DISMANTLING AND DISPOSING
OF RADIOACTIVE AND CONTAMINATED ITEMS IN A
SOLID-WASTE STORAGE AREA

5.1 Preparatory Work

Preparatory work required for dismantling and disposal in a solid-
waste storage area includes: (1) provision of a water flushing system for
the reactor primary system, the salt drain tanks, and the fuel-processing
equipment; (2) provision of a flooding system for the reactor cell;

(3) provision of working shielding, transport shields, and disposable waste
containers; and (4) tooling for cutting up the reactor tank and thermal
shield and for cutting up and handling of pipes, conduits, etc., located

within the containment cells.

5.1.1 Flushing System for the Reactor Tank and Other Primary System
Components

Although the reactor primary system was flushed out with a nonfuel-
bearing molten salt after it was drained of fuel, the systém is known to
contain large solidified globules of the flush salt which failed to com-
pletely drain to the storage tanks. In order to minimize the release of
this contaminated salt into the reactor cell during the dismantling opera-
tion, the primary system will be flushed with water and decontaminating
solutions prior to segmenting. The contaminated solutions can be dis-

charged directly into the existing buillding liquid-waste system and then

to the ORNL liquid-waste disposal system. Based upon a cell volume of

200,000 gallons, a flush rate of 5 gpm, and ‘a project time of one year, the

liquid waste generated would be about 3,000,000 gallons.

The equipment required for flushing will include a pump, mixing tanks
for decontaminating solutions, piping, and valves. The system will require
shielding. Multiple connections will have to be made into different
regions of the primary system to ensure solution circulation in all portions.
(The'connections can be made simply by trespanning holes into the: primary

system and connecting pipes with clamp-on compression fittings.)

5.1.2 Reactor Cell Flooding System

 

The interconnected reactor and drain-tank cells are capable of being
flooded with water if necessary; however, due to differences in elevation
it will be best to avoid flooding the drain-tank cell beyond its seal
membrane elevation since the water would be in contact with bare concrete.
Following flushing of the reactor primary system and the drain tanks, the
opening between the cells can be sealed at the drain-tank-cell side to con-
fine flooding to the reactor cell.

The flooding system will consist of a pump capable of delivering a
minimum of 1,000 gpm, a strainer, bypass or in-line filter, and necessary
piping, valves, and instrumentation. All components containing circulating
water will require shielding. The filter will be cleaned periodically by
backflushing to the existing liquid-waste disposal system. The concentra-
tion of dissolved contaminants can be controlled by continuously or
- periodically discharging a portion of the circulating water to the liquid-

waste disposal system.

5.1.3 Work Shielding

 

The dismantling work will require the erection of temporary shielding
structures around the flushing}and cell-flooding systems and elsewhere on
an as-needed basis. These shields should be made of material forms that
allow éome diversity of size, shape, and thickness and which can be readily
dismantled and the materials reused as required. The estiﬁated require-
‘ments for the dismantling of the reactor system are two-thousand 6 in. x
6 in. x 12 in. solid concrete blocks, six-hundred 2 in. x 4 in. x 8 in.
lead bricks, and one-hundred 1/8 in. x 2 ft x 4 ft lead sheets (21,000 1lbs
of lead total).
105

5.1.4 Transport Shields and Waste Storage Provisions

Present regulations require that all waste items contaminated with
233y be stored in a retrievable manner. This will apply to all. items
removed from the reactor cell, drain-tank cell, and fuel-processing cell.
Although it is planned to minimize further contamination by flushing the
primary system prior to dismantling it, some external contamination already
exists due to past maintenance and post-mortem work.
| Because of the large amount involved, special provisions will have
to be made for storing the material in the solid-waste storage area. For
estimating purposes, it is assumed that the present storage method for
such materials will be used. This requires that the waste items be placed
in specially designed storage shields or be segmented to fit within’
standard stainless steel 55-gallon drums for storage in 30—in.-diaméter
stainless steel lined wells which have a concrete bottom and are capped
with removable concrete top plugs. In 1976 dollars the cost per drum was
$750. Transport shields for 55-gallon drums must be bottom unloading and
have a shielding thickness equivalent to 6 in. of lead. At least three -
such shields should be provided to expedite transfer.

Special sealable storage casks will be provided for large items that
are difficult to segment. These include the reactor assembly, the primary
heat exchanger, the fuel-salt pump, and the pump motor. Except for the
reéctor assembly, the radiation level_from these items is expected to
require only 3 to 4 in. of lead for shielding. The reactor assembly will
require 6 to 7 in. of lead. | ' |

5.1.5 Disposable Waste Containers

All éolid waste contaminated with 233y will be segmented to fit within
55-gallon steel drums. Approximately 1,500 drums will be required.

5.1.6, Miscellaneous Cutting and Handling Tools

A large variety of long-handled tools will be required for unbolting
flanges and structures, for severing pipes and conduits, for tearing

insulation, and for handling loosened items. For the most part, this type

 

 
106

of tooling will consist of equipping standdrd items such as abrasive cutting
tools and hydraulically operated shears with long handles so that they can

be operated remotely.

 

5.1.7 Retrievable Storage Requirements

The packaging of the 233U-contaminated material from the MSRE will
generate a total volume of ~16,000 ft3 of packaged material and will require
0.2 acres of solid-waste storage area for retrievable storage. The major
portion of this volume (v13,000 ft3) will be in the form of 55-gallon
stainless steel drums (~1,500) without any-attached shielding. The remain-
der (03,000 ft3) will be packaged within 31 special containers of various
sizes and with various thicknesses of attached shielding material.

Current cost for preparatory work ana burial at the solid-waste disposal

area averages about $25 per ft3 for retriévable storage.

5.2 Remote Dismantling Work

The first stage of the dismantling work will be to flush out the
emptied fuel-salt and flush-salt drain tanks and the fuel-cell processing
equipment to reduce the radioactivity level in the dfain-tank cell. Piping
connections to the flushing system will be made remotely at various loca-
tions so that the flushing solutions will reach all portions of salt piping
and tanks. Prior to connecting the flushing piping, a gas éupplyAwill be.
connected across each freeze valve. The salt in the valve will then be
heated to molten by existing heaters. A gas flow will be maintained
-through the salt until it has cooled to establish a flow path for water
during the flushing operation.

After the flushing is complete and the flushing system removed, the
drain-tank-cell equipment and the piping and conduits through the penetra-
tion between the drain-tank and reactor cells will be removed and the
opening sealed to allow flooding of the feactor cell. The advantages of
clearing the drain-tank cell first are tﬁat this: (1) allows direct access
to the reactor cell penetration for sealing; and (2) allows use of the
cell ventilation system while it is still operable.

After all_othef pipes and conduits:leadihg from the reactor cell have

been cut externally and sealed, the cell will be flooded to about 6 in.

.f,t- L%

 
107

below the bottom of the lower roof shield blocks. The top shield blocks
will be removed and set aside for possible usage as bridges during dis-
mantling operations. The stainless steel seal pan will be cut up and dis-
posed of in the solid-waste storage area. The lower shield blocks will
then be removed, wrapped in plastic, and disposed of in the solid-waste
storage area. The water level in the cell will then be raised to within

a foot of the cell liner top and the piping for water circulation installed
and shielded. After water circulation has been established, working
bridges will be installed and the dismantling of the reactor cell compo-

nents will begin.
5.2.1 Clearing the Cell Around the Reactor

The initial dismantling activity will be to segment and dispose of all
items in the cell that are external to the thermal shield. These include

the fuel-salt pump, the heat exchanger, the 5-in.-diameter primary and

| secondary piping, electrical heaters, insulation, off-gas piping, thermo-

couples, and support structures. The primary heat exchanger, the fuel-

salt pump motor, and the pump bowl will be separated from interconnecting
structures and placed in specially designed storage casks for disposal in
the solid-waste storage area. All other items will be segmented for dis-

posal in 55-gallon drums.

5.2.2 Segmenting and Disposal of the Thermal Shield and the Reactor Vessel

 

Since the reactor vessel is supported from the thermal shield 1id, it
will haﬁe to be cut loose and lowered to the bottom of the éhield‘prior to
removing the 1id. Following removal and disposal of the reactor vessel
heaters and the removable side sections of the thermal shield, a suspension
arrangement will be connected to the reactor vessel access flange and then
attached to a bridge.across the cell opening to allow the vessel support
hangers to be severed. The reactor vessel will then be lowered to the
bottom of the thermal.shield and the thermal shield 1lid moved aside to an
underwater support frame for segmenting.

Following disposal of the thermal shield lid, the reactor vessel and

. 1ts contents will be lifted over the side of the thermal shield and lowered

to a special support frame for segmenting. When the vessel is in place, a
108

circumferential cut will be made near the vessel base to allow the vessel
sides, top, and the attached core shell to bevlifted aside as a unit to
.expose the graphite core block assembly. After the graphite has been’
broken out and disposed of, the reactor vessel and core shell will be seg-
mented and disposed of in 55-gallon steel drums. The remainder of the
thermal shield will then be segmented and transferred to storage. In
addition to the segmented pieces of the thermal shield, there are 35 tons
of 7/8-in.-diameter carbon steel balls filling the annular space of the

cylindrical portion of the shield. These will also be packaged and stored.
5.2.2.a Alternative to Segmenting the Reactor Vessel

An attractive alternative to segmenting the reactor vessel is
removing it intact into a large, portable, sealed lead cask for indefi-
nite above-ground storage in the solid-waste storage area. The cask
(Figure 51) would be of simple cylindrical construction with a flat
base and top and made with a stainless steel liner. It would be top-
loading with the top seal-welded to the body following loading. A
small filtered vent would be provided to prevent internal pressuré
buildup due to radiolysis of residual moisture. To shield the
present radiation level to the acceptable storage level of <200 mr/hr,
a 6-in. thickness of lead would be required. The combined weight 6f
the cask and the intact reactor vessel would be 60 tons.

The cost of the cask and the associated handling equipment would
be considerably less than the cost of tooling for and segmenting the

vessel.
5.2.3 Drain-Tank Cell

The shielding thickness required for storing the emptied and flushed
drain tanks cannot be estimated without assuming a higher upper limit for
the radiation and prefabricating shields that may be excessively thick.

If the4decbntamiﬁation of the tanks 1s reasonably successful, little or no

shielding will be required for transporting the tanks to storage.

Because of the massiveness of the tanks and the material and complexity .

of theilr construction, remote segmenting for storage would be comparable in

expense to segmenting the reactor vessel even though the radiation levels

are much lower. If shielding is required for transport and storage, the
tanks will be lifted out of their furnaces'qnd moved to a temporary shield
where trénSport shields will be built around them. To do this, the tanks
will each be surrounded with a stainless steel form into which an annulus
of concrete of the required thickness will be poured. The shielded tanks
will be disposed of in the solid-waste storage area. All other items in
the cell will be segmented for disﬁosal in 55-gallon drums. The cell walls
will be decontaminated and the top shield blocks reinstalled.

 

5.2.4 Fuel-Processing Cell

The fuel storage tank and other items in the fuel-processing cell
will be disposed of using the same techniques outlined for the drain-tank
cell. | |

5.2.5 Cell Ventilation System

 

The 30-in.-diameter carbon steel cell ventilation line from the south-

west side of the bottom of the reactor cell was used to maintain a negative

pressure in the cell during maintenance operations and is contaminated with

radioactive particles and fission producté released during these activities.

This line, the main 36-in.-diameter duct it joins, the filter pit, and the
discharge stack will be decontaminated and left in place. Smaller con-
taminated ducts from the auxiliary cells will be cut up and disposed of in

the solid-waste storage area.

5.2.6 Off-Gas System

 

Because of the gas holdup volumes in the off-gas line ahead of the
charcoal trap, essentially all the residual long-lived fission products in
the system will be plated out on the walls of the holdup volume pipes
rather than collected in the charcoal trabs. The holdup volume which

encircles the inside of the reactor cell will be segmented and disposed of
.along with the other contents of the cell, The remainder of the system up
to its juncture with the containment ventilation system particulate filter
enclosure will be segmented and disposed Af in the solid-waste storage area
unless there is a need for retaining the system for future projects using
the shielded cells.

 
111

5.2.7 Liquid-Waste Disposal System

 

The portion of the liquid-waste disposal system contaminated with 233y
will be removed, éegmen;ed, and disposed of'up to but not including the
waste storage tank in the liquid-waste cell. The storage tank and its con-
nections to the ORNL liquid-waste disposal system will be decontaminated

to the extent possible and retained for future programs.

5.2.8 Coolant-Salt System

 

The coolant salt was drained from the system to the storage tank in
the coolant drain cell when reactor operation was terminated. The salt
pump, pump support, and the 5-in. piping outside the reactor cell have
been removed for use in a development project; but the radiator, sampler,
and drain-tank system (including the coolant salt) remain in place along
with all the auxiliary systems. |

The system has only trace amounts of radioactive contamination and.
beryllium salt contamination. All the system components will be disposed

of by burial in the solid-waste storage area.

5.2.9 Miscellaneous Contaminated Items

 

Contamination outside the primary and secondary salt systems is con-
fined mainly to the component-cooling system, sampler-enricher, and the

treated-water system.

5.2.9.a Component-Cooling Air System

 

The component—cooling air blowers, heat exchanger, filter,
enclosures, and piping are located in the special equipment room
immediately south of the reactor containment cell. This system is
contaminated internally with cell atmospheric contaminants pulled in
from the reactor and drain-tank cells. _

The piping, valves, and strainer could be segmented and packaged
in 55-gallon drums for storage. The heat exchanger, blowers, and
motors will require special containers. The containment enclosures
could be decontaminated enough to allow direct burial more economically
than segmenting and storing. The radiation level from the components

of this systeﬁ will be very low.
¥y
it

112

5.2.9.b Sampler-Enricher

 

Radiation readings taken February 25, 1977, at the 1/2-in.-thick
quartz periscope window and at the removal valve opening of the pri-
mary system sampler-enricher were 150 ﬁr/hr and 1 R/hr, r¢Spective1y.
Temporary work shielding will be required after the existing shielding
is removed in order to discoﬁnect and éemove the assembly.

Secondary containment of the asséﬁbly is provided by the upper
sample transfer box and the lower operational and maintenance valve
box. These boxes are joined together with seals at penetrations to’
prevent the 6ontamination due to sampling from entering the lower box.
Removal will require opening of thevvalve box in order to disconnect
the transfer tube as well as to discoﬁnect the box from a floor flange.
Making these disconnections plus severing and sealing a multitude of
electrical, pneumatic, cover-gas, and off~gas connections will allow the
complete assembly to be removed to a éﬁecial storage container.

Removal of the fuel~processing-system sampler will be done in a

similar manner.

5.2.9.c Treated-Water System

 

The treated-water system is a closed loop syétem that was used to
cool components within the cells. Ali the in~cell portions will be
removed with the cell equipment. The portions outside the cells are
located within a pipe chase along the south face of the reactor cell,
in the water room and in the diesel Shed. Contamination within this
system consists of activated oxides and chromates induced by exposure
to the reactor system. The contamination level is very low; so these
components will not require shielding, bnly simple containment with
plastic wraps, etc., and may be disposed of by burying in a trench in
the disposal area. _‘ |

The equipment in the pipe chasefconsists of piping and radiation
safety block valves. These may be removed by unbolting existing
flanges and by simple cutting procedﬁres with direct access available

for the work.
113

The water room contains two pumps, a surge tank, makeup tank, and all
valving, flow monitors, and piping for the distribution of the cooling
water. Direct access existgifor the removal of these items.

The diesel shed contaiﬁs a heat exchanger and a particle filter.

The highest level of contamination within the system is concentrated in
the filter. The heat exchaﬂger and filter are connected to the wafer
room piping via underground iines which cross the west yard (v100 ft of
4-in. carbon steel pipe). Direct access exists for removal of the com-
ponents in the shed, and there are no obstacles in the way of excavating

g
the underground pipes. '

6. WORK INVOLVED IN ENTOMBING ALL RADIOACTIVE
AND CONTAMINATED ITEMS IN THE REACTOR CELL

6.1 Preparatory Work

Preparatory work for entombing all radiocactive and contaminated items
in the reactor cell in concrete includes: (1) provision of a water
flushing system for the fuel and flush-salt drain tanks and the fuel-
processing equipment; (2) provision of a 5,000 cfm (minimum) air exhaust
duct into the top of the reactor cell; and (3) tooling for cutting pipes
and structural materials in the reactor cell and for cutting loose and
transferring tanks, pipes, and structural materials from the drain-tank
and fuel-processing cells to the reactor cell.

6.1.1 Flushing System for the Primary Salt Drain Tanks and the Fuel-
Processing Equipment

This.system is the same as that described in Section 5.1.1; however,
it will not be necessary to flush out the reactor vessel nor the primary
system in the reactor cell. The drain tanks and their associated piping
as well as the equipment and piping in the fuel-processing cell are to be
flushed to reduce radiation levels and the probability of contamination

spread during their being cut out and transferred to the reactor cell for

entombment.

6.1.2 Air Exhaust System for the Reactor Cell

The existing 30-in.-diameter cell ventilation duct is connected to the
cell near the bottom; therefore, it cannot be used to vent the cell while -
concrete is being poured into it. Also, before concrete can be poured, it
must be severed.and sealed at the point of emergence from the cell structure
. and should not be further contaminated by the preparations for entombment.
To provide necessary ventilation for particle control, a temporary shielded
30 in. by 30 in. ventilation duct will Be provided to exhaust air from the
cell at the top near the south edge. This duct will be tied into the
existing 30 in. by 30 in. duct located at the east side of the cell that
normally exhausts the high-bay area. The existing particulate filters,

blowers, and exhaust stack can be used.

6.1.3 Tooling

Required tooling will include remotgiy operated saws, abrasive cutting
tools, hydraulic shears, cutting torches, lifting hooks, and tongs to be
used in the reactor cell to make space for other items. The same tools
will be used for cutting loose and transferring items from the drain-tank
and fuel-processing cells to the reactor cell. Most of these tools can
be made by adapting standard tools with long handles to allow remote opera-

tion.

6.2 Preparing Reactor Cell to Accommodate Contaminated
Items from Other Cells and Areas

6.2.1 Clearing Top of Cell and Installing Temporary Ventilation Duct

To allow access to all areas of the reactor cell, the upper tier of
shielding blocks will be set aside and the entire seal pan cut out in
easily'handled sections and temporarily stored for later disposal in the
reactor cell. During this work, a negative pressure will be maintained in
the cell using the existing 30-in.-diameter ventilation duct. One of the
smaller lower shield blocks on the south side will be removed and replaced
with a new shielded cover containing the temporary véntilation duct. When
‘the new duct has been installed, shielded, and opened to the ventilation

system, the existing duct will be closed.
117

6.2.2 Sealing the Existing 30-In. Cell Ventilation Duct at the Cell Wall

 

The existing cell ventilation duct will be severed and a short section
removed in the coolant cell where the duct exits the reactor cell outer
tank. The cell side of the opening will be blanked with a flange éontaining
a nozzle for pumping the penetration full of grout. The duct opening to

the filters will be temporarily sealed as the remainder of the duct will be

removed later.

The duct penetration extends %8 ft through the sand-filled annulus to
the reactér containment tank. The duct is horizontal for about 5 ft and
then turns upward at a 31° slope to intersect the hemispherical bottom
head of the reactor tank. The open and inside the cell is shielded by a
9—in.;thick carbon steel shadow shield. The grout should be pumped inward
until it extrudes from behind the shadow shield (40 ft3).

6.2.3 Closure of the Opening Between the Reactor and Drain-Tank Cells

 

Before concfete can be poured into the reactor cell, fhe opening
from there into the drain-tank cell must be cleared of pipes and conduits
and sealed. Since later work will further obscure the opening on the
reactor cell side, it will be necessary to clear and seal the opéning first.

To provide ventilation from the drain-tank cell after sealing the
opening, the upper layer of shielding blocks and the seal pan will be ’
removed and a lower shield block replaced with one containing an opening
for a ventilation duct as will be done for the reactor cell. This duct
will tie in to the temporary duct provided for the reactor cell.

When ventilation has been estéblished for both cells, the pipes and
conduits passing through the intercell opening will be severed in both
cells and drawn into the reactor cell. The opening will then be closed on

the reactor cell side with a large prefabricated plug or cap.

6.2.4 Enlarging Space in the Reactor Cell

 

There are two purposes for cufting loose and rearranging items in the
reactor cell, One purpose is to remove, on the inside of the cell, short
sections of all pipes and conduits that penetrate the cell walls to ensure
that all internal systems will be sealed from external communication fol-

lowing entombment. Prior to doing the internal cutting, the pipes and
118

.conduits will be cut and capped where theyiemerge externally from the cell.
After the cell has been filled with concrete, the caps will be removed to
allow backfilling with concrete prior to final sealing. The second purpose
is to rearrange some of the existing compénents to provide space for placing
other items in the cell for entombment.

The major items to be disconnected or cut loose and repositioned are
the fuel-salt pump and its associated conduits and piping, the heat
- exchanger, the primary and secondary salt piping and heaters, and the vari-
ous structures that support these items. ‘

This phase of the work will be relatively slow due both to limited
access and the type of work to be done. Since there will Be a dust and
particle control probleﬁ during this ﬁork, only one working opening into
the cell will be used. The inflow of air through this opening to the ven-
tilation system will prevent the dust and particles from emerging.
Additional limited control will be exercised by drenching with water as
applicable. The water will collect in the sump at the low point of the
‘containment vessel and will be jetted to thelliquid—waste system. The
water ejection system will be the last piping cut loose in the cell.

Although preparation of the drain~-tank cell components, fuel-processing
cell components, and other items for transfer may be done simultaneously
with the space preparation in the reactor cell, no transfer of items to the
reactor cell will be done until all cutting and rearranging there is com-

plete.

6.3 Transfer of Disposable Items to the Reactor Cell
6.3.1 Drain-Tank and Fuel-Processing Cell Components

While the reactor cell is being prepéred to receive them, the emptied
and flushed tanks, piping, etc., in the drain-tank cell and the fuel-
processing equipment, piping, etc., will be prepared for transfer. Tanks
will be transferred as units, Smaller.iéems, such as pipe sections, will
be loaded into reusable steel drums or similar containers for tranmsfer.

Prior to the transfer, an opening large enough to receive the items
to be transferred can be provided through the reactor cell top by first

stacking temporary shielding to a height of about 6 ft above floor level
w2

"y
+

l"‘

119

to form a shielded chimney around the cell top shield blocks to be removed
and then removing the shield blocks. The vertical shielding will protect
pefsonnel from direct radiation from the cell and allow the access to remain
open while transferred items are being positioned in the cell by personnel
working through a smaller opening. Between transfers, the top of the

chimney will be closed with a light-weight cover. During transfers, the
shielded remote maintenance control room will be used by the hoist operator--
other personnel will remain at a safe distance while the items being trans-
ferred are unshielded.

As an altérnative-to using the shielded chimney as an access to the
cell, appropriate shielding blocks can be removed and replaced as required
by operating the hoist from the shielded remote maintenance control room.

As each tank is put into place in the reactor cell, grout will be
pumped into it through a pipe opening or a trespanned hole to prevent

floating during the filling of the cell with concrete.
6.3.2 Disposal of Existing Reactor Cell Ventilation Duct and Off-Gas Lines

The entire 30-in.-diameter reactor cell ventilation duct between the

. reactor cell and the 36-in. main ventilation duct will be cut into sections

and disposed of in the reactor cell. To do this, sectioning will begin at
the point of emergence from the reactor cell (already sealed from the reac-

tor cell) and proceed toward the main duct. This will allow an inward

 draft of air to be maintained for dust control. Prior to cutting each

section, the inner wall will be coated with a sealant to prevent particle:
release during subsequent handling. Removal of the duct outside the
building will involve excavation. |

Sectioning of off-gas lines will also be done while maintainiﬁg an
inward draft; however, due to their small size, coating the sections

internally will not be required.
6.3.3  Secondary Decay Volume and Charcoal Traps

Due to only low-level contamination with long-lived fission products,
the secondary decay volume and charcoal traps (all located in the charcoal-
trap pit) will be sealed and transferred as intact units to the solid-waste

storage area for disposal in trenches.
120

6.4 Filling the Reactor Cell with Concrete

The filling of the reactor cell with concrete and grout will be done
in stages as the various items to be disposed of there are added. This
procedure will reduce the radiation level through openings in the top of
the cell as quickly as.possible. One of the first regions to be filled
with grout will be.the annulus beﬁween the reactor vessel and thermal shield
to reduce the radiation from the vessel into the cell.

When the reactor cell has been filled with concrete up to the bottoms
of the lower shield blocks, the temporary ventilation duct will be removed
and all the lower shield blocks will be reinstalled. A final grouting in
of the blocks ﬁill be made at the building floor level and the surface
finished to building floor specifications. The upper shield beams may be

checked for contamination and either retained for other uses or disposed of.

6.5 Decontamination 6f Area

6.5.1 Drain-Tank Cell

 

When the equipment removed from the drain-tank cell is complete, decon-
tamination of the interior surfaces and cell penetrations will be done. The
cell is stainless steel lined and will aliow strong solutions to be used
for cleaning. The solutions can be jetted to the existing liquid-waste
system., The transferrable contamination should be low enough to allow
unrestricted use of the cell.

The upper and lower shield plugs will be cleaned and reinstalled over

the cell for future use.
6.5.2 Fuel-Processing Cell

After removal of the fuel-processing-cell equipment, the cell will be
decontaminated in the same manner as the drain—tank cell except that the
cell surfaces are concrete. Chipping may be uséd where solution cleaning
is unsuccessful. |

The roof plugs will be cleaned and replaced for future use.

.

T
121

6.5.3 Liquid-Waste Storage Cell

The liquid-waste system will be retained for future use. Contamination
in the storage tank, filter, pipes, and pump will be flushed out to the
Laboratory ILW system to allow the system to remain for future use with

restricted entry only into the waste-tank storage cell.
6.5.4 Containment Ventilation Systenm

After removal of the reactor cell exhaust duct and decontamination of
the stack filter bay, very little, if any, contamination will remain in the
ventilation system. Repairs to the duct where the cell exhaust line is

removed will be made, and the system will remain ready for use.

- 6.5.5 Special Equipment Room - Coolant Cell Area

A small amount of contamination exists in the special equipment room
as a result of maintenance on the component-cooling air blowers. Care
must be used to avoid further contamination during the removal of the cell

exhaust duct and the component-cooling air system. A simple mopping of the

cell area should remove the existing contamination.
