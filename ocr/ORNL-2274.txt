FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at QRNL
records the technical progress of the research on circuloting-fuel reactors and other ANP
research ot the Loboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into
five mojor parts: ). Aircraft Reactor Engineering, 2. Chemistry, 3. Metallurgy, 4. Redia-
tion Domage and Fuel Recovery and Reprocessing, ond 5. Critical Experiments and
Reactor Shielding.

The ANP Project personnel are engaged in many phases of reseorch directed toward
the achievement of nuclecr propulsion of circraft. A considercble portion of this research
is performed in support of the work of other organizations participating in the national
ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is directed toward the
development of o circuleating-fuel type of reactoer.

The design, construction, and eperation of the Aircraft Reactor Test {ART), are the
current objectives of the project. The ART is to be a power plant system that wiil in-
clude o 60-Mw circuloting-fuel reflector-moderator reoctor ond adequate means for heat
disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose of determining feasibility and
for studying the problems associated with the design, construction, and operation of a

high-power circulating-fuel reflector-moderated aircroft reactor system.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART 1. AIRCRAFT REACTOR ENGINEERING

1.1, Aircraft Reactor Test Design

Tests ore under way or have been proposed
with which to evaluate the ART structural design
criteria, since experience in the design of
structures for operation af temperatures in excess
of 1000°F is limited and in general not directly
applicable. The high operating temperature will
greatly affect the creep ond relaxation of the
structure, and temperature cycling will cause strain
cycling.  The only test completed in this study
thus far was the initial core-shell low-frequency
thermol-cycling experiment. The results of this
one test indicate that the strain-cycling criterion
used tor the core shells is conservative. In-
formatien on strain-cycling and creep character-
istics of lnconel, as well as on the effects of
“‘cumulative damage,'’ is to be obtained in heat
exchanger tests that ore now wunder woy., An
attempt to predict the life of the heat exchanger
revealed the need for creep measurements of
Inconel in fused sclts at the corrosion rates
expected in the reactor,

The distribution of stresses in the various shells
that will resuvlt from design-point temperature and
pressure profiles is being analyzed. Shells V
and V| (shell ¥V separates the boron-tile curtain
around the heot exchanger from the fuel, and shell
V| is the pressure shell liner) have been studied,
and final designs for the junctions of these shells
have becna prepared on the basis of the onolyses.

Efforts are being made to predict the stress-
rupture life of tubes subjected to a bending stress
on o short section., The results of this stdy
indicate that the calculoted maximum stress is
quickly reduced to about B0% of the predicted
elostic value and remains essentially constont for
the life of the member. The study alse indicoted
that constant-sttess data are required for calcu-
lations of this type, rather than constent-load data.
An experimental attempt to verify the “reduced-
stress effect’’ is being made.

Detailed stress analyses of the ART fin-type
NaX-to-air rodiators are under way. Several critical
areas in the design hove been identified, and

alterotions required by stress considerations have
Studies were made of weight ond air
drag loads, relative thermal expansion between
fins ond header, and relotive thermal expansion
between adjacent tubes in the event of flow
stoppage as a result of oxide plugging.

Series of tests ond experiments are under waoy
in order to determine the fatigue life of Inconel
under simulated ART conditions, since the core
shells might be subjected to surface temperature
oscillations os large as BPF ot frequencies of
from l,;; to 4 cps. It it is found that lncenel does
not possess adequate fatigue strength, design
modifications moy be required to alleviate the
temperature oscillations.  One proposal being
studied provides for mounting o pair of thin Inconel
shells in the core to serve as '‘thermal shields™
for the structural core shells,

been made.

Flow studies of the full-scale 21-in. plastic
model of the ART core were continved in order
to investigate woll temperoture fluctuotions, which
may be analogous to the fluid temperature fluctu-
ctions observed in the one-half-scale volume-heot-
Varicus types of probes and
thermocouple arrangements are being invesfigufed
for use in these studies. The fiow-guidance ex-
periments continued with tests of the core entrance
region alone, the core entrance and equatorial

region within the center volute of the cxial-flow
type of header.

obtained with an inlet guide vane, a cenical baffle
plate, and o slotted disk, which wos loceted & in.

Some improvements in flow distri-

1.2, Reactor Physics

The gamma-ray dose rate at the outer surface of
the ART neutron shield was computed as o first
step in a re-evoluation of the shielding of the ART
ond auxiliary equipment, Gamma-roy  source
strengths were obtained through the use of two-
dimensional neutron-diffusion calculations. Sec-
ondary gamma rays from the lead shield were

neglected, since Lid Tank Shielding Fecility

‘- 3
XV
 

(LTSF) experimenis showed that the dose varied
exponentially with lead fthickness up to cbout
4.5 in.; the ART lecd is 4.3 in. thick. The LTSF
data ore interpreted ta meen that the intensity of
gamma rays penetrating the 4.3-in.-thick leod
shield of the ART will be much greater than the
intensity of gomme rays preduced in the lead,
The colculated dose rate at the surface of the
shield was found to be 1840 r/hr. The relotive
importance of each source is indicoted by the
percentfage contribution teo the total dose rate:
core, 22%; outer core shell, 9%; reflector, 12%;
reflector shell, 35%; heat exchanger, 22%.

The fast-neutron dose rote at the shield surface
was computed from LTSF data. It was found thar
ot a distence of 50 ft from the center of the ART
operating at 60 Mw with o 4.3-in.-lead and 31.5-in.-
water shield, the calculated gamma-ray dose is
22.8 rem/hv and the fast-neutron dose rate is
0.05 rem/hr.

1.3. ART Instrumenis and Controls

The ART NaK circuit flow-decay characteristics
were investigated as an initial step in evaluating
the significance of a pump power failure in terms
of temperoture and pressure transients in the ART
heat-dump system. Experimente] data were ob-
tained for o loop in which an ARTY prototype NoK
pump was being tested ot high temperatures.
Curing shutdown tests, complete tabulations of
pump shaft revolutions as a function of time were
obtained from which speed vs time dota could ke
obtained through numerical differentiation. The
data thus obtained were correlated with computed
velumes of segments of the ART primary NoK
heat-dump circuit.

Tests of commercially availoble resistance-type
liquid-metal-level tronsducers were continued, and
when the tests were terminated at 3732 hr, during
which time the NgK level of the system was cycled
65,000 times, oaly one of the four instruments was
in operating condition. The other three units failed
because NeK seeped into the insulation threugh
cracks at the U-bends. The reaction of the Nal
with the insulotion caused visible deformation.
ORML-designed units, which will be clemped into
place rather than welded, ore being prepared for
further tests. The ORNL units will hove improved
temperature compensation, and the weld design has
been modified.

xviii

All-welded resistance-type on-off level probes
are being developed as replecements for con-
ventional spark-plug probes, which are not suitable
for pressurized systems and temperatures above
450°F. An especially fabricated spark plug with
a beryllivm oxide insulator was tested in NaK as
an on-off level probe, but it failed in 20 hr of
operation because of short circyiting of the in-
sulator. Several special plugs with insulators high
in olumino ond mognesium conient were received
for testing.

Tests of the helium-bubbler-type tuel-level in-
dicetors were continued, and tests to determine
the cause of bubbler plugging were initiated. It
is thought that the wmateriol which plugs the
bubbler tubes is Zr0,. Special static-level tests
are to be run therefore in which the oxygen content
will be carefully contrelled. It is hoped that the
present average life of 1100 hr in a static-level
system can be increased to the specified 3000 hr.

Evaluation tests of commercial pressure trans-
mitters for use at high temperatures were continued.
Units that employ differential transformers were
found to be difficult to use becavse the field of
the Calrod heaters used to maintain the operating
temperature has on effect on the output readings.
A unit that employs @ varioble-permeance type of
pressure transducer was unsolisfactory because
of lack of svitable aligning guides. Additional
tests of the promising four-legged strain-goge
transmitters are being maode. Also o second set
of pneumatic-output fransmitters completed a suc-
cessful 3000-hr life test in o NaK-filled test loop.

Six of the SIé-in. magnetic flowmeters purchased
for the ETU and the ART were installed in the
flowmeter test loop for calibration. Preliminary
indications are that ot least four of these flow-
meters will be ccceptoble for ETU installation,
Six 2-in. magnetic flowmeters are aveilable for
calibration, and the 3%-in. models designed for
plug indicotors and cold trops are being fobricated.

Two prototype models of remotely adjustable
pressure regulators were tested. These units were
found to be stable under line-voltage, supply-

pressure, and normal ambient-temperature vari-
ations. Life tests are to be run on these
instruments,

A 1-in. turbine flowmeter ceased to operate after
340 hr of an endurance test scheduled for 3000 hr

in a circulating fused salt. X-roy exomination
showed that the unit was not broken, and it is
thought that oxidation resulting from previous
operaticn in NaK systems may have caused the
unit to bind. The unit will be removed for ex-
aminaticn when the loop is drained. A 31,5-En.
turbine flowmeter operating in a NaK system failed
some time during the first 40 hr of operation.
Disassembly of the loop showed eight of the ten
blades 10 be missing; the remaining two blades
were bent; and both shafts were broken. The
cause of this failure is being investigated.

Tests of closure welds of Inconel-sheathed
thermocouples in sodium and in fused salts are
under way, The Heliorc welding process has been
found to yield 30 to 50% acceptable welds. Bend
tests were made, ond single U-bends on a 3,:’1—ir:.
radius were found to have little effect on accuracy,
Repeated bending caused a 2 to 3°F shift. The
drift of data obteined with sheathed and with
beaded Chromel-alumel thermocouples as a function
of time and temperature is being studied.

1.4, Component Development and Testing

Yrradiation tests of a full-scale ART fuel pump
rotary assembly are to be run in a gamma-irradiation
facility in the MTR cenal. The final selection of
a lubricant-coolant for the reactor pumps will be
based on the results of these tests.

On the basis of further satisfactory test per-
formance, modified Durametollic seals have been
specified for use in the ART NaK pumps. Hf the
irradiation tests show either UCON LB-140-X or
Gultcrest 34 lubricants fo be satisfactory, buna-N-
base O-rings will be specified for the reactor pump
¥ the MTR tests prove these lubricants
to be uvasatisfactory, the seal material mey ogain
become o problem.

The development 1tests with water of an ac-
ceptable impeller configuration (designated model
32) for the ART fuel pump were completed., The
tests showed that flow rate, head, and pumping
power remained fairly constant when the liquid
level in the expansion tank was reduced from 3 to
g.g in. Further reductions in the level resuited in
definite decreases in flow rote, head, ond pumping
power, Tests for determining degassing times
were alse conducted with the liquid level in the
expansion tank ot 3 in. and the pump eperating of
the design speed of 2700 rpm. Degassing of an
injected air sample was complete in less thon

seals.

1 min. Tests of the pump at high temperatures

with NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-45-4 mole %, fuel 30) as
the circuloted fluid were started, The pump head
is 1 to 2 ft lower than that cbtained with water,
ond this discrepancy is beiny investigated. Pers-
formance and cavitation dota are being obtained.

A similar pump that operated with fuel 30 tn an
endurance test was shut down after a total of
2587 hr of operating time and 120 thermal cycles
in the temperotuee range of 1400 to 1100°F, Ex-
ominaticn showed the pump to be in good condition,
ond it has been clecned, reassembled with new
seals, ond put back into operation., There was
no trouble with the hydroulic drive during the lost
1240 hr of operation because a back pressure was
mointained on the discharge side of the motor to
ensure that the piston shoes were seated on the
wobble plate af oll times.

The ART sodium pump is now being subjected
to development testing with water on the same
basis as that used for the fue! pump. Tests to
date hove been hampered by ingassing of the loop
in which the pump is instalied. Since free move-
ment between the sodium pump barrel and volute
will be required in the ART to ollow for radial
movement, a seal is being developed for this
region to minimize leakoge of sodium between
the heat exchanger inlet and the pump centrifuge
outlet. Two types of multiple-ring seals are being
considered, as well 0s a simpler seal with o single
Fing.

An ART sodium pump is also being fested in an
endurance test with sodium ond has accumulated
1584 nr of operating time with 300 thermal cycles
in the temperature range of 1250 te 1050°F. The
oump priming difficulties encountered previously
were solved by stopping the pump when transferring
sodium to the pot, The off-ges line plugging
problem was resclved by lowering the liguid level
in the pump poft.

High-temperature testing of an ART primary
NoK pump was continued, and performance and
efficiency curves were obtoined ot o NaK temper-
ature of 1200°F. The data are in good agreement
with the daofa obtained with water, An ART
auxiliary NaK pump is being tested with water
and an Inconel impeller in ploce of the brass
impeller used previously. Cavitation performance
of the Inconel impeller has been found to be
entirely satisfoctory. After a vent was provided
for gos trapped during filling, the pump primed
satisfactorily, A specific technique for starting
and siopping the pump was developed.
Fuel-toNaK  heot and NaK-to-air
radiator test operations were continued. One test
was terminated by a MNoK leck in the circulating
cold-trap economizer after ¢ total of 1845 hr of
operation. The heat exchanger and the radiotor

exchonger

in this system hod been operated noniscthermally
for 1456 hr, including 552 hr ot o fuel inlet temper-
afure of 1600°F and 29 thermal cycles. Dato
obtained in this test are being analyzed as part
of a study of mass transfer in a NaK circuit,

A 20-tube semicircular heat exchaonger was de-
signed ond is being fabricated thot simulates the
tube geometries of the ART main heat exchangers.
This heat exchonger will be subjected to o thermal
cycling progrom in order te wverify the stress
analysis of the ART heot exchongers,

The ART twin fuel pump system was tested
further as part of the water flow tests of the
aluminum north-head mockup. With the improved
model 32 impellers in the pumps, the liquid
spraying and sloshing noted previously in the
expansion tank and the resultant wetting of the
tank ceiling were greatly reduced. The madel 32
impeller olso resolved the problem of liquid rising
in the shoft annulus of o stopped pump if the other
pump was stilt running.

Tests of ART prototype dump valves were con-
tinued. VYalves which have rigidly mounted plugs
are now considered to be essenticl for satisfactory
aoperation. The seat and plug materials which have
been found to be the most saotisfactory are the
Kentanium cermets K 151A vs K-152B and KM vs
K-162B8. All tests to date have been made with
fuel 30, but a test stand is now being modified
for tests with NaK,

The second of the two proposed thermal-stability
tests of the outer core shell was started under
conditions similar to those used previously. Di-
mensions were carefully taken for later comparison
with dimensions to be taken after the test,

Orifice plugs were tested for controlling sodium
flow through the cooling holes in the ART be-
reflector in order to obtain o uniform
temperature throughout the beryllium. A full-scale
wooden mockup of one-half of the symmetrical
sodium circuit in the reflector entrance region was
The head and flow distribution
measurements obtained in these tests are being
used in design anclyses, A water test was also
conducted on a proposed byposs slot to be cut
between the sodium-to-NaK heat exchanger shell

and the external pressure shell of the reactor.
This slot will allow some sodium to byposs the
present s5lots between the pressure shell and the
upper-deck outer shell and will provide a more
direct entrance for flow into the heat exchanger
inlet.

The high-frequency thermal-cycling test loop
designed for studying the effect of thermal cycling
The loop has
operated satisfoctorily ot design specitications in
water tests, and data are being taken on temper-
ature amplitudes at the test section as a function

of freqguency ond flow rate. The water tests will
be continued wuntil thoraugh fomiliarization with
the operotion is achieved.

The plugging indicaters that are to be provided

in sach of the eight NeX cold-trap circvits of the

ART to monitor the sodium oxide level were
calibrated against chemical onalyses. The coli-
bration curves obtoined include most of the

praciical range of plugging-indicater application,

Tests were made on modified liquid-metal-vopor
condensers. A satisfactory NaK cendenser is now
ovailable, but further developmental effort is
required to obtain o satisfactory sodium condenser,

The design of an experimental prototype of the
ART zirconium flucride thermal-condensation vopor
trap was completed, and a unit is being fobricated.
Traps poucked with A|203 have operated satis-
factorily in several tests.

Tests were run on three bronds of insulation
being considered for use on piping corrying high-
tempergture NaK, The thermal conductivifies and
heat losses were obtained.

1.5. Reactor and Facility Construction

The detailed design of the reactor is essentially
complete, with some work remaining to be done
on the design of sodium annuli surrounding the
fuel overflow, off-gas, and fill-and-drain lines,
MNumerous design changes haove been made based
on further design studies, development
component  fabricatien difficulties, ond
shrinkage tests.

The schedule for ossembly of the ETU end ART
reactors was revised on the basis of delayed
delivery of compenents being produced by outside
vendors. Work on the north-head assembly is
awaiting delivery of the sodium-to-NaK heat ex-
changers.  The components for two reflector-

tests,
weld

moderator assemblies are now available, ond the

xx
u
 

 

assembly for the ETU is progressing satisfactorily.
Work is clso progressing on the strut-load ring
assembly. Most of the beron carbide tiles required
for two reactors are ovailable, aad no difficulty
is anticipated in obtairing the remainder. Some
difficulties are being experienced by the fabricator
of the stoinless-steel-clod boron-copper shielding
material thot may be resoived by a relaxetion in
tolerances.

The fobricotion of the Inconel shells by the
spinning process remains o major problem, but
progress is being made. An alternate effort is
being made tc fabricate the thin core shells by
hot forming oversized ports and then finish
machining them to final thickness. It is doubtful,
however, that shells produced in this manner will
have satisfactory metallurgical structure,

One set of beryllivm island parts is complete,
and work is under way on the pressure shell liner.
The dual effort on fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger
fabrication was evaluated, and Black, Sivalls &
Bryson was selected as the fabricator.

Extensive tests of reactor assembly methods
have been performed, and the assembly procedures
have been developed. The assembly area aond
fixtures are olmost completed.

Much installetion work on the ETU assembly has
been done, and prelimincry estimotes show an
expected ETU focility completion date, exclusive
of the reactor and its associated equipment, of
September 1, 1958. A further study of the items
fo be ploced within the ETU cell that simuleotes
the ART cell brought about several changes,
including the elimination of the equatorial and
south-head lead shielding, Design of the cell
compenents {other thon the reactor) is well under
way, and fabrication of many items has been
initiated.

Much of the outside contract work on the ART
focitity has been completed. The work to be done
by ORNL forces on the installation of process
piping ond equipment remains, and design work
on this phase of the project is well under way.
Procurement was initiated on o few items,

Plans for removing ond sectioning the ART after
operation were studied further. A Ix‘iz-scale modef
of a proposed hot cell is now avsoilable as an aid
in visualizing the complex techniques that will
be involved and in designing the tools and tixtures
that will be required.

1.6. ART, ETU, and In-Pile Operations

A critical review of the reactor system operability
is being made, ond conflicts among the design,
construction, and instrumentation phases of the
project are being resolved. A study of manpower
required for various phases of the program in-
dicated thot the peok work foad during operation
of the ART will require 40 engineers ond 18
technicians.

As the result of o design review, additional
provisions have been made for the ceontainment
of octivity at the ART focility in the event of
concurrent heat exchanger and radiater lecks; @
number of design and instrument changes have
been incorporated into the system; ond addisional
component development tests have been schedufed
to demonstrate the odequacy of the system for the
prescribed test program. Procedures for filling
the various systems were prepared.

The planning for ETU operation is paralleling
that for ART operation, with the maintenance of
ETU flow sheets, instrument lists, and valve
tabulations being emphasized, A preliminary study
of ART emergency conditions to be simulated with
the ETU is under way.

Procedures for disassembling the ART were
studied further, Possible methods for performing
the remote cutting operations that will be required
within the cell were studied, and several dis-
odvantoges of a proposed underwater operation
have developed.

Developmental work is under woy on the higher
performance pump and heat exchanger that will
be required for in-pile loop experiments with the
new nickel-molybdenum alloys and lithium-base
fuels, A pump is now availoble that will be
suitable for a loop with maximum temperatures in
the range of 1600 to 1650°F, which correspond to
o pump temperature of 1500°F. |In on effort to
increase the copacity of the heat exchonger, a
vnit with machined nickel fins has been designed
and is being fabricoted for testing.

In-pile tests of moderctor materials continued
with the preporation for insertion in the MTR of
copsules conteining beryllium oxide, graphite, and
zirconium hydride specimens.

1.7. Heat Tronster and Physical Properties

Heat transfer studies with the delta-array heot
exchanger were continved. Flow in the laminar
region wos investigated to establish the effect
of natural convection on the total heat tronsfer,
No effect could be observed over the Reynolds
modulus range exomined. The fluid friction choroc-
teristics on the fuel side of a straighi-tube model
of the ART fuel-10-NaK heat exchanger were tested
further, with measurements being token down to
a Reynolds modulus of 1530. The early transirion
in the data indicates the effect of the turbulent
spacer wokes on the system pressure drop. FPre-
liminary designs have been made for an apparatus
to study the heat transfer and velocity struciures
in a single fuel-side channel of an ART type of
heat exchanger.

Additional data on the
screens in reactor cores ore to be obtoined with
the use of the swirl entronce system. A mathe-
matical analysis indicated that even under fuel
conditions reactor core screens will not
reach dangerously high temperatures. FPhotogrophic

Quantitative data on the turbulent velocity strycture

obtained by superimposing the velocity profile

A volume-heot-source experiment is plonned with
which to establish the effect of screens on the
thermal structure in the ART core. A series of
vortex tube heat transfer and hydrodynomic ex-
been outlined for determining
quantitatively the characteristics of this system.
Therma)-cycling studies of the strength and cor-
resion characteristics of Inconel in a fluoride salt
mixture envircnment were continued. The sig-
nificonce and limits of some of the experimentol
variables have been determined, There is some

The enthalpy and heat capacity for the mixture
NaF.ZrF,-UF, (50-25-25 mole %) were determined
in both the solid ond liquid states. Data on the
pure compound U‘F‘t have been obtained for the
solid stete only. Viscosity measurements hove
been made with three mixtures in the NaF-RbF-
ZrF,-UF, system. The viscosities ronged from
7.5 to 9.5 centipoises ot O00°C down to 3.3 to

3.5 centipoises at 800°C,
studies have concentrated on the problems of
eliminoting from the experimentol data the effects
of variable heat flows. An experimental study
has been initiated to determine the electrical con-
ductivity of {iquid soedium and of sodium-potassium
alloys.

2.2, Chemical Reactions in Molten Salts

The investigation of the equilibrium reduction
of NiF2 by H2 in Naf-Zrf ot 550°C was con-
cluded, ond the dato were combined with these
previously obtained. The doto indicate that the
equilibrium constant, K, is independent of the
NiF, concentration over the concentration range
studied, which included values not for from the
concentration of NiF2 in the soturated solution at
this temparoture.

In o carefu! determinction of the solubility of
nickel as NiF, in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mele %) of
55(G°C, a volye of 352 + 11 ppm was obtoined.
The dota indicoted that the solubility remcined
constant when the omount of saturating phase
changed from a trace to a total of 1310 ppm Ni T
Further, the value of 352 is in substantial agree-
ment with o value of 400 ppm previously reported
for the solubility obtained with an oddition of
1760 ppm Ni**,

Additionul experiments on the reduction of UF
by Fe® in the reaction medivm RbF-ZrF  (60-40

mole %) showed that equilibrium wos established

in 5 hr and that the equilibrium concentration of
Fe** is significantly higher at 400 than of 800°C.
The concentration values obtained fell in the ronge
of those obtained in other alkali Hluoride-binary
mixtures, satisfoctory explanation is
ovailable for the lack of elfect of the recction
medium. In controst, the studies of the Cro-UF4
reaction showed that the chromium concentration
increases in the order of use of RbF, KF, NaF,
LiF, which is the order of decreasing ion size.
Additionel data on the reaction of UFA with Cr®
in the RbF-Zrf, reaction medium ot 600 ond at
800°C indicate that the fluoride

increases only slightly when the RbF concentration

ond no

ion activity

is increased from 50 to 58 mole %.

Rare-earth fluorides labeled with Ce 141, [La 140,
ond Sm133 were used to study the solubilities of
CeF3 angd Lu:II:3 ¢lone and in combination and
SmfF, clone and in combinaticn with CeF3 in
NcF-Zer-UFd {50-46-4 mele %) at varicus tem-
peratures.  The odditien of both LaF; and SmF,
decreased the solubility of CeF,. Similorly addi-
tions of BoF, and 5rF, reduced the solubility of
CeF,. The data indicate that the solubilities of
the rare earth flyorides are sufficiently high to
permit quite long-time operotion of o reactor before
precipitation of these materials becomes a problem.

The determination of the solubility of xenon gas
in molten NoF-Zer-UFd {50-46-4 mole %) os a
function of pressure and temperoture was suc-
cessfully completed. As in the cose of helium,
the solubility wos found to increase with in-
creosing temperature.

A direct equilibrotion method was used for
determining the solubility of HF in NoF-ZrF
(53-47 mole %) at 600°C. The dato obtained,
which will be extended to higher temperatures
ond pressures, indicate that the solubility is
1.25 x 10~ moles of HF per cubic centimeter of
melt af 1 atm. The data of the solubility of HF
will be valuable in studies of methods of salt
purification, some aspects of corrosion problems,
and processes for dissclution of solid fuel
elements for uranivm recovery.

Preliminory measurements of concentrotion celfs
with l[‘»li':’/'l*lilz2 electrodes and the solvent KF-LiF
(50-50 mole %) indicote the sclubility of Nin
in this sclvent to be obout 10 times that in the
solvent MaF-ZrF  (53-47 mole %), This difference

4
can probably be oftributed to the basic noture of
the KF-LiF solvent in which the weokly acid NiF,
would be more soluble thon in the more acid
NaF-Zer mixture. In order to obtain more infor-
mation regording the chonge of solute activity
coefficients with solvent composition, efforts are
under way to develop more reliable types of Danieil
cells and to measure a series of these cells in
different media with vorying but dilute concen-
trations of the metal fluorides, NEFz, FeFE,
Cer, and possibly ather solutes.

The possibility ef obtaining activities from emf
measurements of melten and solid sclutions of
salts was studied further with meosurements of the
LiCl-AgCl system. The main deterrent to the
application of similor techniques to fluoride fuels
is the lack of o suitable substitute for a fluorine
electrode.

Electromigration in molten salts has been shown
to be a successful means for separoting isotopes,
ond therefore it is of interest to determine the
usefulness of this technique for the presyumably
easier problem of seporating i1ons of different
elements in fuel Some preliminary
experiments with LiT and Ni ** ions in a chloride
melt showed that if the chloride lattice is con-
sidered to be stationary, the Li ¥ ions moved about
20 times faster than the Ni** jsas.
electromigration should be a very efficient means
of recovering Li' from o spent fuel, but the
engineering arrangements for working in fluorides

2.3. Theory of Molten Fluaride Behaviar

An attempt hos been made to correlate the
behavior of molten Hluorides on the basis of chorge-
to-ion radius (Z/ R) ratios. If the Z/ R ratios of
the salts in o mixture differ considerobly ond
especially if the salts are of widely different
valence states, the extra stobility of the mixture
will be large, and the structure will be considerably
distorted in comparison with the structures of the
component salts, that is, the larger the difference
in Z/R rotios, the more stable the mixture relative
to its compenents. For components which mix
without o change in coordination number and with
little distortion, the negative deviation from ideal
solution behavior is accounted for, in general, by
o dacrease in cation repulsive energy upon mixing.

It is alse convenient to correlate the behavior of
the complex melten fluoride mixtures in terms of
the attraction between the fluoride
nelghboring cations. The ions in a selution tend

determines the positien of the fluoride ions with
respect to oltarnative cations, and fluoride ions
will prefer as necrest neighbors those cations
which yield the largest Z/R ratios.
in the difference in the Z/R raties of the cations

An increase

of a fluoride solution will resvit in an increase
in the negative deviations from ideal solutien
behavior shown by the mixture.

A useful qualitative model for describing the
liguid structure of fuel mixtures based on the
NaF.ZrF, system was devised in which liquid
ZeF , is considered to be a somewhat disorganized
lottice of flucride bridges cornecting zirconium
ions. The addition of NaF to ZrF4 results in the
breaking of the bridges to give zirconium ions
which are surrounded partially by bridging fluorides
and partially by nonbridging fluorides. Since the
complexing potentialities of o fluoride melt depend
on the fluoride ion activity, it is very important to
know how this activity, which cannot be measured,
varies with composition.

The fluoride ion activity con be correlated in «
qualitative manner by an acid-base scheme in
which catiens are rated according to their tendency
to behave os fluoride donors or acceptors. If
fluoride denors ore defined as bases and fluoride
acceptors as acids, the cations fall into the same
general pottern as thot used for the classification
of oxides as acidic or basic. The NaF compound
is an exomple of o sirong base and ZrF4 of a
strong acid,

In order to map the relative acidity of o fuel
solvent, Z/R ratios are plotted vs solvent compo-
sition. Such a plot permits estimates of the
reletive negative deviations of solutes, and, hence,
also relative solubilities in case the pure solute
is the saturoting phase. An important use is the
selection of which will
reduce corrosion by complexing the corrosive
agents rather thon the corrosion products.

2.4, Physical Properties of Molten Materials

The wvapor pressures of the less volatile

compenents in fuel mixtures are being studied.

XXlv
 

In order to determine the vopor species, the
absolute vapor pressures of molten alkali fluorides
were measured by a quasi-static method. A suf-
ficiently wide temperature range was covered to
give curvature on a log p vs 1/T plot. Equations
were estoblished ond constants evaluated for the
compounds LiF, NaF, KF, RbF, ond CsF. Tento-
tive estimates were olso moade of the percentage
of monomeric molecules in the saturated vapor of
the various molten olkoli fluorides.

A preliminary value for the density of mohen
UF . was obtained for use in o determination of the
sur‘f‘oce tension, At 1075°C, a density of
6.80 t 0.09 g/cm® was found by using graphite
pycnometers. The density of the molten material
being greater than that of solid UF, (6.63 g/cm?®
based on x-ray data) and the behavier of the salt
surface level upon freezing in the pycnometer
indicate that UI:‘1 either contracts or expands
only very slightly upon melting.

2,5. Production of Puritied Fluoride Mixtures

The hydride of yttrium is being studied for use
as a moderator in high-temperature reactors.
Considerable quantities of YF, (™~1400 g} were
therefore prepared for use in manufacturing the
metallic yttrium from which the hydride is prepared.

The product of the reduction of MoF with FeF
was collected in o condenser and redlshiled uné
the yellow product was found to melt at 78°C
rather than the 60°C previously reported for the
moterial before distilletion. |t has not yet been
determined conclusively that the material is MoF ..

In the pilot-scale equipment, 42 hatches were
processed that totaled 1575 lb of various fluoride
compositions, with o mojor portion of the material
being NuF-KF-LiF-UF4 (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %).
Nickel storage receivers are unsatisfactory for
the lithium-bose mixture becavuse of the large
exponsion of the material upon melting. Incenel
cans are now being used for 50-lb batches, but
when inadvertent exposure of the mixture to air or
water occurs in Inconel cans, extensive contami-
nation of the melt with CrF, and FeF, results.
Since these contominants cannot be removed
economically by retreatment of the batch, the
material must be discarded.,

In the production-scale facility 446 batches
totaling approximately 11,500 Ib were processed.
Some 18,000 of the 30,000 Ib of NaZrF_ ordered

from a vendor was received and found to ie satis-

factory. A total of 15,700 Ib of processed fluorides
was dispensed in botch sizes ronging from 1 to
25¢ lb.  Approximotely 4000 |b of processed
fluorides and 2500 Ib of ligquid metals were charged
into test units.

2.6. Compatibility of Materials ot High
Temperature

The study of the penetration of grophite by
molten tluerides was continved. An experiment
was performed in which commercial APC graphite
was impregnated with NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %)
and then subjected fo a sublimotion step in order
to raise the melting temperature of the residual
mixtyre to above that of the uronium-bearing
mixture. The sublimation procedure increased
the NnF-to-ZrF4 ratio in the graphite, with the
final rotic being obout 16:1. This material will
be tested in o molten uranium-bearing mixture to
determine whether a sclid impregnating material
will resist penetrotion.

Two types of graphite (code Nos, R-28 and M-80)
obtained from the National Carbon Compony were
immersed in NaF- ZrF -UF | (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)
ofter impregnation with Nulé ZrF (53-47 mole %).
Examinations revealed that these specimens were
not penetrated to ony consideroble degree by either
of the salt mixtures.

it hos been established through electrolytic
studies of the NoOH-Ni system that in o non-
isothermal system the hot nickel electrode is
usvally enodic and the cold electrode is cathedic.
This situation can, however, be reversed by the
use of a hydrogen atmosphere. Since NeOH is o
potential moderator-coolant material, ottempts are
being made to balance the current in an effort to
find @ way to eliminate the moss-transfer effects
observed in NaOH circuloted under a temperoture
grodient.

In service tests of valve seat materials exposed
to helium scturated with NaK vopor, G-E SE-550
and SE-450, Dow-Corning Silastic-80, and Dy Pont
5570 withstoed NaK fairly well, with SE-550
possibly being superior to the other materiols.

2.7. Analytical Chemistry

The apparctys for the detection of submicrogram
omounts of sodium in oir wos assembled and tested.
In preliminary tests 100 ppb of sodium could be
easily detected. By means of appropriate re-
finements in the Iinstrument it appears that the

amounts of zirconium in

desired limit of detection of 10 ppb is feasible
with the present apparatus. Zirconium was found
to be a suitable moterial from which to fobricote
orifices for the injection of NaK inte air. These
orifices will be used in the testing of the NoK
leck detectors.

The methancl-dissolution method for the deter-
mination of oxygen in lithium was investigated.
In this method the lithium oxide torms an equivalent
amount of water upon dissolution in methanol.
The then titrated with Korl Fischer
reagent. The reliahbility of the method is dependent
on the degree to which the methanol can be dried.
Methano! was produced with ¢ concentration of

Methods for the determination

vanadium are removed by extracting them with
This particular ex-

traction essentially isolotes the aluminum in the

the interfering ions, including nickel, iron, chro-
mium, eond molybdenum, among other ions, were
removed by deposition at the mercury cathode
prior to determination of the vanadium os the
benzohydroxamote complex. Titanium was separated
from molybdenum by a basic carbonate precipitation
and from niebivm by extraction of the thiocyonate
salts with diethyl ether,

A sensitive, spectrophotometric method for the
determination of nickel with 4-isopropyl-1, 2-
cyclohexaredionedioxime was developed. When the
nickel-dioxime complex is extracted with xylene,
the ultimate sensitivity is less than 0.5 ppm of
nickel in a 5-g somple of alkali metal. The inter-
ference of iron is masked by use of the fluoride
ion, This method is also applicobie to the deter-
mination of nickel in solutions of zirconium- or
lithium-bose fused salt fuels.

that form relatively strong complexes with zir-
conium, were found to interfere seriously.

The methylene-blue method for the determination
of sulfur in fluoride salts was improved by the
substitution of a reducing mixture of stannous
chloride and dehydrated phosphoric acid for the
standard mixture of red phosphorys, hydriedic
acid, and formic acid. As much as 1 g of the
fluoride salt con be dissolved in 20 ml of the
new mixture, whereas the fluoride salts are only
slightly soluble in the red phosphorus mixture,
The improved method is thus much more relioble,

The extraction of melybdenum from acidic solu-
tions with tri-n-octylphosphine oxide was investi-
goted.  Under fovorable conditiens as much as

A satisfactory effusion cell was developed for
use in mass-spectrometer investigations of the
compositions of the wvapor phases of fused-solt
fuel mixtures. Preliminary measurements were
made on alkali-halide salts.

PART 3. METALLURGY

3.1. Dynamic Corrosion Studies

Three forced-circulation leops fabricated of
Hastelloy B were examined that had circulated
NuF-KF-LiF-UFd {11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, {fuel
107} at a meximum fluid temperature of 1850°F.
Two of the loops operated with maximum wall
temperotures of obout 1750°F oand showed no
svidence of mass transfer after 407 and 1000 hr,
respectively. A third loep, which operated with o
maximum  wail temperature of 1710°F and at @
relatively low flow rate, showed slight evidence of
deposits near the pump. The hot legs of all loops
were found to be badly pitted after the tests, but
 

much of the surfoce roughness could be attributed
to the condition of the inner surfaces of the tubing
before the tests,

An Inconel forced-circulation loop was operated
with NaF-ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) at
@ maximum f?md temperature of abowt 1700°F
and a maximum wall tempercture of 1840°F. After
1000 hr of operation the loop wos found to have
been attacked to a depth of 9 mils, and there were
some deposits in cold-leg sections, The fuel
mixture No. 70, NaF-ZrF -UF (56-39-5 mole %),
wos tested in another |ncone1 forcad-circulation
foop operated at o fluid temperature of about
1500°F Loop operotion wos terminated after
716 hr, and ettack to a depth of S mils was found
in the hot leg. A thin metallic layer wos aiso
noted in the cold leg. An examination of another
Inconel forced-circulation loop that operated
500 hr with fuel mixture No. 30 also revecled hot-
leg attack to a depth of 5 mils, but no cold-leg
deposits were found.

An evalustion was made of the effectiveness
of cold traps in the removal of oxide impurities
from circutating NaK and the resultant effect on
mass transfer in Inconel-NeK forced-circulation
loops. Cold traps maintoined ot temperatures of
100, 300, 600, and 800°F, respectively, were
utilized in cenjunction with loops operoting at o
maximum NoK temperature of T1500°F and a fluid
temperoture drop through the loop of 300°F. A
definite increase in the amount of depasit ma-
terial was noted in the loep which contained the
cold trap operated ot 800°F os compared with
the lcop having the cold trap operated at 600°F
The change in the amount of deposited material
accompanying a decrease in the cold-trap temper-
ature below 600°F was less than the change from
800 to 600°C. The average sizes of the porticles
comprising the deposits clso varied with the
cold-trop temperature, becoming coarser as the
cold-trap temperature increased. The deposits
found in these NaK systems were [ess thon one-
half the weight of deposit found in sodivm systems
operated under similar temperature and time con-
ditions.

Two lnconel-sodium forced-circulation loops
which operated at flow rates of 1.5 and 3.0 gpm
were also examined. The maximum sodium temper-
oture in these tests was 1500°F, ond the temper-
ature gradient was 300°F. Operation of the loops
for 1000 hr ot the higher flow rate produced

1'-
"

deposited material that weighed 14 g compared
with 10.4 g for the loop operated with the lower
flow rate. The average thickness of the deposit
was alse higher in the loop operated with the
higher flow rate.

A type 304 stainless steel foreed-circulation
loop after operation with sodium at 1500°F showed
only slight traces of mass-transfer deposits. This
loop was operated for 1000 hr with a thermal
gradient of 300°F.

Long duration tests of Inconel forced-circufation
loops were made with both NaK and sedium circu-
lated at @ maximum Ffluid temperature of 1500°F.
The test with NoK, for which a temperature
grodient of §00°F was used, waos terminated ofter
2760 hr.  The coocled section of this loop was
found to contoin extensive crystclline deposits
that ronged te 14 mils in thickress. The loop
operated with sodium for 4000 hr with o temper-
oture gradient of BQ0°F showed considerably larger
deposits that reached a thickness of 50 mils in
some areos.

Thermol-convection loops fobricoted from various
experimental nickel-melybdenum alloys were tested
with sedium ond with NeF-KF-LiF-UF , (11.2-41-
45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107), for 1000 and 5CG0 hr,
respectively, at maximum fluid temperatures of
1500°F. There was attack by the fuel mixture to
on average depth of 1.5 mils in all loops except
those construcied of alloys containing aluminum
additions. For the alloys containing oluminum a
maximum depth of attack of 3 mils was found.
Correspondingly the pickup of aluminum by the
fuel was high in the loops fabricated from alloys
Similarly
picked up by fuel circuloted in alloys centaining
tungsten; no cppreciable increase in
ottack accompanied the buildup of tungsten in the
fuel, Vaonadism, titanium, and niobium additions
to the alloys had no apgarent effect on corrosion;
but the fuel picked up slight amounts of titanium
and niobium.

An average hot-leg attack of 1 mil was found in
several nickel-molybdenum alloy leops operated
with sodium, ond deposits were visible in the cold
legs. These deposits did not adhere tightly to the
loop woll, and consequently difficulty hos been
encountered in examining them metallogrophically.

A series of standard Inconel thermal-convection
loops was operated with l‘~~!t:1|‘:-Zt'F4-UF_4 (50-46-4
mole %, fuel 30) at 1500°F to determine whether

the teaching of chromium during the corrosion
process would continve if o loop were left at test
temperature ofter the fuel was dreined. The
results showed that the migration of voids into
Inconel did not proceed when the leoching of the
chromium was stopped.

Three stoinless-steel-clad niebium loops showed
onfy slight hotleg cottack in tests with NoF-KF-
LiF-UF‘$ (191.2-43-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) at
1500°F; however, some cold-leg deposits were
observed in niobium loops which operoted 1000 hr
or longer. A nicbivm loop wos also operoted
1000 hr with sodium ot 1500°F. The attock wos
negligible, but cold-leg deposits were observed.
Chemical analysis of the deposited material
indicated that the sodium probably teoked into the
cladding Joop during operation.

3.2. General Corrosion Studies

Additional tube-to-header (oints with
receystallized welds were corrosion tested in NaK

(56-44 wt %) and in Na F-ZrF ,-UF, {50.45.4 mole %)

for 100 kr in seesaw-furnace apparctus with a hot-

Inconel

zone temperature of 1500°F, These samples were
fabricated by using a prechamfered header plate
which results in decreased material deformation
The tests showed
no greater attack along the tube-header interface
than on the tube and on the header,

Haynes No. 8244 brazing clicy (9.4% Cr—4.4%
Fe-3.7% S5i~2.2% B8--0.3% Mn-0.06% C-bo! Ni) on
Incone! tube-to-header joints showed good cor-
rosion resistance o NaK (56-44 wt %) in a Y00-hr
seesaw-furnace test at o hot-zone temperciure of
1500°F. Subsurfoce voids fo a depth of 3 mils
were observed on the alloy when tested in NaF-
ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) under similor con-
ditions, '

A seesaw-fumace test of 500 ht at a hot-zone
temperature of 16050°F wos run to defermine the
compatibility of a 15% Mo—6% Cr—bat Ni alloy and
molybdenum when exposed to NoF.KF-LiF-UF,
{11.2.41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107). The presence
of nickel on the surface of the molybdeaum
specimen ofter the test indicated dissimilar metol

similar conditions,

1000 hr. The ottock ond mass transfer in this
loop were quite similar to the resuits obtoined
with sodium in Inconel thermal-convection Joops.

A third sodium-beryllivm-Inconel competibility
test has shown that chromium plating of lnconei
reduces the amount of intermetallic compound
formation to approximafely one-third thot found
when Inconel and beryllium are placed in direct
contact. Thermal cyeling did not result ia spalling
of the Be Cr phase.

A zirconium specimen exposed to sodium for
400 br of 1600°F in an Inconel standpipe capsule
was found to have absorbed oxygen from the
sodivm. This removal of oxygen from the sedium
appecred, however, to have no effect on the eamount
of mass transfer os compared with that found in a
stondard Inconel stondpipe copsule containing neo
zirconism and tested under similar conditions.

Molybdenum and beryilium were tested for com-
patibility when exposed to sodium. Exposures of
100 and 500 he at 1500°F resulted in the formation
of two extremely hard intermetallic compounds,
MoBe., and MoBe, ,, ot the interfoce,

Four titanium carbide—nickel cermets, three with
10, 20, and 30% nicke! and one with 25% Ni plus
5% Mo, were attacked to a depth of approximately
0.5 mil during a 100-hr expesure to sodium at
1500°F in o seesaw-furnace. In previous similar
tests these cermets were not ottocked by Naf-
ZrF4-UFd.

Boron carbide specimens with theoreticol densi-
ties of 85 ond 90% were found to have fair
resistance 1o attack by static sodium in lnconel
containers at 1500°F. A dense (2.15 g/em3)
boron nitride specimen was severely ottacked in a
100-hr exposure to sodium at 1500°F in o seesaw
furnoce. Exposyre of an SiC-St specimen for 100 hr
fo sodium ot 1500°F in o seesow furnoce resuited
in complete removal of the silicon.

Lead-fithium alloys contoining 0.65 wt % Li
showed weight and dimensional increoses when
tested in water af vorioys temperotures. The
weight gains increased with the temperature and
time of the test.

In the lithium corcosion reseorch being cearried
out atNuclear Development Corporation of America,
base-line deta for plugging of type 316 stoinless
steel-lithium thermal-convection loops hos been
obtained. The addition ¢f titanivm and zirconiuvm
as getters has led to increosed loop life but has
 

not prevented mass transfer. The use of cold traps
for impurities hos also led to improved loop
performance.

3,3. Fabrication Research

The nickel-molybdenum alloys fobricated ond
tested thus far have, in general, significantly

better corrosion resistance and strength than
Inconel without sacrifice of fabricability and
weldability,  These alloys now appeor to offer

definite possibilifies of use as structural materials
of reactors that utilize more efficient fuels at
higher temperatures. The corrosion resistance of
most of the alloys is equivalent to that of Hastel-
loy B, and the stress-rupture data for oll olloys
tested show on average life of 40G hr at 1500°F at
a stress of BOOO psi. The fabricability depends
largely uvpen the kinds ond quantities of elements
added to the basic nickel-molybdenum alloy, and
with proper control reascnable yields of moterial
are obtained from taboratory heats,

At present an alloy designated INDR-8, which is
baosed on the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe system, seems to best
fulfill all the requirements, In arder to investigate
the ronge of mechanicel properties developed in
alloys of this system, the tensile and stress-rupture
properties are being determined for a series of
compositions, with the maximum content of the
major components, other than nickel, being 20% Mo,
10% Cr, and 10% Fe. The alloys tested to date
with {ow and intermediate contents of Mo, Cr, and
Fe are oll stronger than lnconel and approach the
strength of type 316 stainless steel. There is
evidence that olloys with higher Me, Cr, ond Fe
content will respond to aging and show even
higher strengths.

A series of alloys designated INOR-9 are being
investigated, in which the elements Cr, Al, Ti,
ond W have been eliminated becouse of their poor
corrosion resistance in fuel 107. Alloys with o
maximum of 15% Mo and with significant additions
of niohium and iron were prepared, and the limits
of solubility and oxidation behavior were de-
termined.

Six tube blanks of ecch of three nickel-molybdenum
base olloys prepared at ORNL have been extruded
and submitted to Superior Tube Co. for redrawing
to tubing, These alloys were designed for studies
of the effect of 10% Cr and 7% Fe, singly and to-
gether, on the corrosion resistance of a 17% Mo—bal
Ni base alloy.

Sheet, plote, wire, and bar products fabricated
from the six 4800-1b heats designated INOR alloys
1 through & have been received. Alloys INOR-4
and INOR-& became virtually 100% scrap because
of fabrication ditficulties, while alloys INOR-2
and INOR-5 were processed with considerable
success, The tube shells of the INOR alloys, two
each of INOR alloys 1, 2, and 5 and one each of
INOR alloys 3 and 6, are presently being tube
reduced for conversion to small-diometer seamless
tubing at Superior Tube Co.,

The contract with the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation covering the fabrication of large pilot
heats of nickel-molybdenum base afloys has been
signed, and work will begin immediately. Initially,
one 3600-ib heat of alloy INOR-8 will be cast and
fabricated inte sheet, plate, wire, bor, and tube
products for eveluation,

Yarious techniques are being utilized in studying
the phose relationships of the Ni-Mo ond Ni-Mo-Cr
alloy systems under @ subcontroct at the University
of Tennessee, Resulis show that the beto and
gammo phoses fransform ot somewhot higher tem-
peratures than those previously reported.

A totat of 16 tube blanks of four Ni-Mo base
alloys which were extruded for Battelle Memorial
Institute last quarter failed during tube reduction
at Superior Tube Co. These processing failures
substantiate earlier evidence that these alloys
with 0.12% C are not amenable to tube-drawing
operations. Batielle has prepdred new olloys with
o lower corbon content and has submitted twelve
billets of each of two of the alloys to ORNL for
tube-blank fabrication, The tubing processed from
these blanks is scheduled for forced-circulation
loop tests at Bettelle,

Laorge amounts of composite tubing may be re-
quired to circumvent moss tronsfer in nickel-base
alloy systems., To demonstrate the feasibility of
producing the material, several composite tube
shells of Inconel over type 316 stainless steel
were processed on a production schedule. Ex-
cellent yields of souad tubing were obtained from
the coextruded material,

Two full-sized gomma-ray shielding pfugs com-
posed of tungsten carbide and Hastelloy C were
prepared for the ART fuel pumps. However, a die
failure produced loteral expansion of the plugs,
with the result that the parts are considerably over-
size ond will be used only for brazing tests, A
redesigned die has been obtained,

Continved difficulty in producing the stainless-
steel-clad Cu-B,C shield material at Allegheny-
Ludlum has required considerable coordination and
evoluotion of moterials, Recent work based on
recommendotions made by ORNL has resulted in
good yields of sound material,

In attempts to eliminate lack of ductility resulting
from stringering of fine dispersions of Lindsay
Oxide, a technique was developed for producing
dense, hard porticles of the desired size, Three
cores for extrusion billets were prepared with this
material dispersed in electrolytic nickel powder.

The recovery and recrystollization of arc-cast
and powder-metallurgy niobium are being studied
prior to comparing their mechanical properties,
Nearly ideaticel microstructures were finally pre-
pared from the two materials by an initial anneal
at 1450°C followed by severe cold reduction and a
leng annecl ot 1250°C, This material will be used
in determining the recrystallization kinetics of the
two types of niobium,

An in-pile test capsule of hydrided zirconium
clad with molybdenum was fabricated, Equipment
for the production of yttrium metal wos designed
ond built., Studies on the cladding of molybdenum
with nickel-molybdenum alloys were started,

3.4. Welding and Brazing Investigations

An invesfigation wos conducted to determine
optimum brazing procedures for fabrication of the
ART sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers. The mos?
influential variable was found t¢ be the rate-of-rise
to brazing temperature, A similar investigation is
being conducted to determine the minimum rate-of-
rise to lxazing temperature required to effect a
satisfactory back braze of the tube-tfo-tube sheet
joints of heat exchangers.

The techniques developed previousty for the
fabrication of valve components were used in the
preparation of various valve materials for testing
under simulated service conditions,

A study of the problems ossociated with the
fabrication of the ART fill-and-drain tank is under
way. lests are being run to establish welding and
brezing procedures and joint designs thot will re-
sult in crock-free fusion welds. A promising joint
design now being investigated is a trepanned type,

Additional results were obtoined in the investi-
gation of the mechanicol properties of Hastelioy B
and W welds on ]/’z-in. plate, and the results of aoll
the tensile test data have been anclyzed. The

‘fz-in.plqte required for welding and brazing studies
of some of the nickel-molybdenum experimental
alloys wos received ond tests were initiated, No
cracking tendencies were found in tests of INOR-7
and -8,

Results of Polytechnic
Institute on experimental ond commercial nickel-
base alloys indicate thet it is usualiy sufficient
ta evaluate the hot ductility s measured ot 2300°F
during cooling from some higher temperature and to
compere these data with the hot ductility measurad
at 2300°F during heating. The test results show
that none of the INOR alloys behave in as ductile
o manner os Inconel and thay they behave more
like Inconel X than like Hastelloy B,

equipment,
niques were made,

The initial result of a study of the effect of
brazing ond hect-treating operations on the grain
growth of Inconel tubing indicates that stress
relief treatments at 1500°F do not result in grain
growth. Significant grain growth resulted, however,
from }é-hr brazing cycles at approximately 1922°F.
It was also noted that groin growth proceeded more
rapidly in the grains locoted along the ocuter wall
of the tube than in those located along the inner
wall, Straightening and polishing operations had
only minor effects on the grain growth, The in-
fluence of prior cold work is being studied.

In the molybdenum welding studies under sub-
contract at Battefle Memorial Institute the effect of
atmosphere purity, vorious types of shields, and
several cleoning technigues were investigated,
Acid etched specimens were somewhat better than
samples prepared by other methods, Also, the use
of a trailing shield in open air welding was found
to  yield weldments with significantly greater
ductility,

1.5. Mechanical Properties Studies

The behavior of Inconel when subjected to re-
peated thermal cycles is being investigated by
means of relaxotion tests and mechanically induced
cyclic strain tests at ORNL; the University of
Alabama is contributing to this study by conducting
thermally and the

induced strain cycle tests;
 

Battelle Memorial Institute is evaluating the effect
of dynamic loads superimposed on static loads,

Reloxation data were obtained for coarse-grained
Inconet at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F, Prier tensile
strains at temperature were shown o have little
effect on the relaxation behavior. Evidence that
coarse-grained Inconegl has poorer resistance than
fine-grained material to repeated strain cycles has
been obtained.

The evoluation studies of creep properties of the
varicus new olloys heing developed for reactor
use were continued. The results of the alloy de-
velopment program thus far indicate that consider-
able progress hos been mode toward achieving the
objective of developing a material that is as fab-
ricable as required for reactor
possesses adequate strength, and is corrosion
resistant in high-temperatyre fuel mixtures, liquid
metals, ond air. [t has been possible to improve
the creep characteristics by odditions of carbide-
forming elements, such as niobium and tungsten,

construction,

without seriously cffecting the other good charac-
teristics,  Several alloys of this type hove ex-
hibited a stress-rupture life of 1000 hr when
tested in fuel 107 at 8000 psi and 1500°F,

Studies were made of the elevated-temperature
properties of the beryllium blocks being fabricated
for the ART by the Brush Beryllium Co. The tests
indicate that the strength properties do not vary
appreciably from those predicted on the basis of
tests of smaller pressings.

3,6. Mondestructive Testing and Inspection of
Materials and Components

The recently developed Impedograph, which
measures both the a-c resistonce and the reactance
of its testing coil over a wide range of freguencies,
was applied successfully in eddy-current inspec-
tions.  This instrument simultaneously presents
inspection information from both the inner ond
outer surface of tubing, regordless of the materiol
or size of the tube,

Equipment and techniques were developed for
using an eddy-current proche coil to measure the
thicknesses of coatings or cladding., Measurements
made of the cladding thickness on Mark X MTR fue)
plates demonsirated the feasibility of the inspec-
tion techniques. With further experience it should
be possible to measure cladding thicknesses of
most olloys on o cermet core, of any of the oxida-
tion-resistant alloys over molybdenum or niobium

cores, of on austenitic stainless steel over a
nickel-molybdenum core, of o nickel-molybdenum
alloy over an austenitic stainless steel core, or of
the outer layer of duplex tubing. The ability to
measvre Inconel on austenitic stainless steel or
austenitic stainless steel on Inconel is currently
considered to be marginal.

Exposure dota are being compiled for the radi-
ography of various thicknesses of Inconel, stainless
steel, nickel-melybdenum, and similar alloys, Also,
test weldments in L{a*in. Inconel sheet are being
radiographed through 8 in. of beryllium to explore
techniques for the inspeciion of the closure welds
of the ART fuel-onnulus core shells,

A b-in.-dia cap, for use as a cotch basin, which
had been welded 1o the bottom of the sump tank of
the Pratt & Whitmey high-temperature eritical
assembly, was removed when leckage was detected
and was found to be severely cracked, It wos
learned that the cap had been machined from bar
stack rather than being a forged fitting, as speci-
fied.

[nspections construction of
reactor and test components resulted in rejection
rates for Inconel that voried from 0 to 63%, de-

of materials for

pending on type and lot of material, All the Hastel-
loy B inspected was found to be completely intferior
to requirements,

One of the six, lorge, beryilium hot pressings
fabricated for the ETU and ART reflector-moderators
was inspected under laboratory conditions to evalu-
afe the fechniques used for the field inspection.
The *‘squirter’’ technique being used in the field
was demonstrated to be satisfactory, if used with
care,

Welding inspections indicated a performance
record of B3% acceptance of critical welds and
over 95% acceptance of other standard welds.

PART 4. RADIATION DAMAGE AND FUEL
RECOVERY AND REPROCESSING

4,7. Radiation Damcge

Metallographic specimens were cut from in-piie
loop No. 4 which circulated o fluoride fuel mixture
in the MTR., MNone of the specimens examined thus
far have shown attack greater than L5 mils in
depth, and no signs of mass transfer hove been
found, Colored omorphous deposits were found on
the pump slinger and on the forward bellows that

were similar to deposits found in in-pile loop No. 3.

The MTR-irradiated Inconel capsvle containing
beryllium oxide slugs was disassembled and ex-
omined, There was no evidence of BeO powder in
the caopsule, and ne significant changes wete ob-
served in either the lengths or diameters of the
slugs.

An opparatus for stress-rupture tests of Inconel
tubing under irradiation in the MTR was essentially
completed, Eight separote specimens will be
tested simultaneously. Duplicate specimens will
be tested out-of-pile at stresses of 2000, 3000, and
4000 psi ot 1500°F,

Rupture times of 1050 and 1650 hr were obtained
for two specimens of Inconel tubing tested at 2000
psi ond 1300°F while being exposed te a thermal-
and fast-neutron flux of 6 x 10'? neutrons/cm?: sec
in hole HB-3 of the LITR. These rupture times for
this 0.010-in.-wall tubing were in good ogreement
with out-of-pile data, A third in-pile specimen,
stressed to 1000 psi at 1500°F, did not rupture ia
1670 hr, ond the total creep deformation will be
measured uvpon disassembly of the apparatus.

Examination was completed on o tubular Inconel
specimen that was stressed in bending at o moxi-
mum stress of 1000 psi ond irradiated for 1120 hr
ot 1500°F while exposed to NmF-ZrF_‘-UF4 (63-25-
12 mole %, tuel 41) on the inside and sodium on
the outside. Corrosion on the fuel side was negli-
gible and did not oppear to depend on the sign or
magnitude of the stress, On the sodivm side there
was attack to a depth of cbout 3 mils,

Two MTR-irradiated and twe control copsules
fabricated of Inconel ond filled with fuel mixtures
of the NaF-ZrF -UF, system conteining 2 mole %
UF, were opened ond examined. The capsule
exposed to a flux of 1.5 kw/ecm?® for 676 hr ot
1500°F and its control capsule showed corrosion
penetration so negligible as to be confused with
surface faults, The copsule containing 4 mole %
UF ,, which was exposed to a flux of 3.7 kw/em®,
wos attacked at the mid-point to a depth of 5 mils
in 235 hr at 1500°F, The distribution of the attack
was that anticipated on the basis of the tempera-
ture profile. The contribution of irradiation to the
attack connot be judged until control date ond
chemical analyses of the fuel are available.
Hastelloy B capsules were tested out-of-pile, and
stmilor copsules have been inserted in the MTR,
Means for applying oxidatien resistent cootings
to the Hastelloy B capsules cre still being investi-
gated.

Qut-of-pile tests of the pump designed for circu-
lating fused-salt fuel in the LITR vertical in-pile
loop have demonstrated that the newly designed
ZrF ~vopor control features are satisfactory. An
in-pile loop incorporating a similar pump is being
prepored for insertion in the LITR. Facilities are
being plonned for the operation of similar foops in
the Oak Ridge Research Reactor.

During preparotions for filling the LITR wertical
in-pile loop, it was discovered that the interior of
the dry bux wus contominuted by on unknown
gaseous sulfur compound, Sulfur in the Necprene
rubber gloves was found 1o be the source of the
contamination,

dating the high electrical conductivity of the fused

A survey was made of the relative variation of

nevtron flux with distence in hole 51N of the ORNL
graphile reactor by using sulfur ond cadmivm-
covered gold detectors. A plot is presented of the
relative activities of the detectors as a fuaction of

A safe was designed for the removal of samples

at the reactor loading face, or, by transferring it to
another dolly, at holes 50, 51, and 52,

An exposure device has been designed for use
in hole 30N of the Graphite Recctor with which o

4.2. Fuel Recovery and Reprocessing

Construction of the fused salt—fluoride volatility
pilot plant is essenticlly complete, except for the
faciliies for handling the ARE fuel, which will
not be installed until runs with nonirradiated
material are completed, Shokedown tests have
been storted,

The embrittiement of nickel and nickel alloys
with sulfur was studied to determine the allowable
sulfur contamination in the volatility process. A
nicke! foil fest wos devised which will detect
3 ppm of sulfur in o fused salt. Underordinary con-
ditions, however, in equipment with heavy nickel
walls, o sulfur contamination of 200 to 500 ppm is
necessary 1o produce any effect in ane exposure,
but the sulfur effect is cumulative, It appeors that
the scavenging of sulfur by nickel means mat if
the salt is once exposed in the fused state to
nickel equipment it becomes relatively free of
sulfur, The sulfur embrittlement of Inconel was
found fo be much iess than that of nickel.

The gas-phase oxidation resistance of types 316
and 347 stainless steel was found to be quite un-
satisfactory in tests of their use
as containers for fused fluoride salts., This sub-
stanticted pilot plant experience with the charge
melt vessel,

An over-all porosity of 65% was found for the
type of NoF to be used in the absorption-desorption
step of the decontamination process. The porticle

There was little difference between different lots

PART 3. CRITICAL EXFERIMENTS AND
REACTOR SHIELDING

5.1, Critical Experiments

A critical assembly mocking up the circulating
fuel reflector-moderoted reactor under study by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was operated at tempera-
tures near 1250°F, The fuel consisted of ¢ molten
mixture of sodium, zirconium, and uranium fluorides,
and the control rod contained a mixture of 30% rare
earth oxides and 70% nickel. With the control rod
out, the critical concentration was 10,97 wt % U
(5.1 mole % UF,) at 1258°F; with the rod inserted
to the midplane, the critical concentration was
12,20 wt % U, The temperature coefficient of
reactivity over the range of 1200 to 1350°F was
=3,6 x 10~ {Ak/k)/°F,

5.2. Shielding Theory

Several Monte Carlo calculations have been per-
formed on the Oracle to determine the dose rats,
energy flux, energy deposition, and in some cases
the energy spectra in laminated shields as a func-
tion cf the energy of the gamma-ray source and the
angle of incidence of the gamma rays on the shield.
Since it is impracticol to publish ali the results
from these calculations in o progress report, a
summary of the problems is presented along with
references to the published data,

5.3. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

A new instrument positioner has been installed
of the Lid Tonk Shielding Facility (LTS5F) which
will indicate the absolute position of any radiatien
detector in the tank water to within £0.5 mm, This
is o considerable improvement over the old posi-
tioner with which absolute pesitions could not be
determined to an accuracy greater than 15 mm.

temperatures ranging from 0 to 80°C, The gmmo-
nolysis reaction, which was found to occur to a

100°C, The densities of liquid lithium borchydride
ammonicates were also determined,

A survey of shielding materials, which was per-
formed by the Technical Research Group under
Subcontract No. 931, confirmed that lithium hy-
dride and polyethylene are the most effective neu-
tron shields known to dote. Lithium hydride is
the only lightweight neutron shield material that
can be used in the temperoture ronge of 700 to
1200°F, which is the range thot may be expected
in some parts of the direct-cycle reactor shield.
The high-density materials required for gamma-ray
shields still center around lead, bismuth, tungsten,

Tests of ART Structural Design Criteria

Experience in the design of structures for opera-
tion ot high temperatures, that is, temperotures
in excess of 1000°F, is limited. Some experience
has been gained throughout the technology from
the design of jet and rocket engine components
and wvery high-performance steam power plants,
but little of this experience is directly opplicable
to the design of a system such as the Aircraft
Reactor Test {ART). Therefore considerable
effort has been devoted to establishing suitable
design criteria for this reactor.

The high-temperature phenomeno that will be
encountered in the ART are creep, reloxation,
and strain-cycling. The design problems associoted
with creep were discussed previcusly in connection
with the stress analysis of the north-head structure,
and the design criterio used for this onalysis
were given in a previous report.! The design
criteria for strain-cycling and relaxotion onalyses
were discussed in connection with the core shell
tests.’ The only test to date which could yield
any information on the volidity of the design
criteria selected for the ART was the core-shell
low-frequency thermal-cycling experiment.?  Only
one such test has, as yet, been completed, but
the resulss indicote thet the strain-cycling criterion
used for the core shells is conservative. It was
not possible from this single test to deduce the
degree of conservotism of the criterion.

Further tests ore under way or have been pro-
posed with which to evaluate the odequacy of
the selected design criteria. In the heat exchaonger
test progrom presently under way it should be
possible by suitable control of test procedures

Nevertheless, it is ex

estimates of the strains induced in the structure.
The strains thus obtoined are being used to de-

This procedure was applied in a study of shelis
V and V1.3 The analysis of shell V was completed®
ond is summorized here,

The function of sheli ¥ is to separate the boror-
tile curtain around the outer surfoce of the heat
exchanger from the fuel, and thus it serves pri-
marily @s @ container, lts importance as a
structural member stems from the foct that a rupture
in this shell would expose the tiles to the fused
salt, and it is possible that such exposure might
cause @ significant change in reactivity because
of the high boron content of the tiles.

Shell ¥V consists of three ports, as shown pre-
viously,® and each part is ottached separately to
shell W1 {the pressure shell liner), The boron
tiles are contained between these conceniric
shells, The inner surface of shell V is bathed
with fuel from the core, ond the outer surface of
shell V| is bathed with sodium from the island
circuit, At full power’ these fluids operate ot
markedly different temperatures, and this situation
gives rise to differential expansion be-
tween the two shells, Because of the apprecioble
difference in thickness of these shells (f in.

produce free radiol expansions at the equator of

By trecting this discrete set of forces os a con-
tinuous force distributed along the tube, it is
possible to write a differential equation for the

equation for the bending stress in the fins as a
function of the position along the tube. This

failure of the tubes under the cyclic conditions
of the test or of plugging. Metallurgical experience
indicates that the resistonce of Inconel to plastic
strain cycling is seriously impaired by embritile-
ment in oreas wetted by the brozing olley. Since
two radiotors failed under conditions which in-
dicated tube plugging, the embristling effects of

the brazing alloy on Inconel are being studied,

Core-Shell Thermal Shield
D. H. Platus

Measurements obtained from the one-halfscale
ART-core-model volume-heat-source experiment!?
indicated that the core shells might be subjected
to surfoce temperature oscillations os large as
80°F at frequencies of from ]{" to 4 cps. Series
of tests ond experiments are therefore under way
in order to determine the fotigue life of laconel
tubing under simuloted ART conditions. If these
tests demonstrate that Inconel does not possess
fatigue strengths adequate to meet the opersting
conditions onticipated for the ART, it moy be
necessary to introduce design modifications to
olleviate the temperature oscillations in the core.

Several possible modifications have been sug-

gested. One proposal is to mount a pair of thin
Inconel shells in the core to serve as '‘thermal
shields'’ for the structurol core shells. '3 These
sheils would be similor in appearance to the

actual core shells and would define two reiotively
thin flow channels, as shown in Fig. 1.1,12, The
resulting hydrodynamic structure should be con-
siderably more stable than thot in the present

ART SHIELDING
C. M. Copenhaver A. M. Perry

A program of calculations hos been undertaken
to re-evaluate the shielding of the ART ond such
auxiliary equipment os the fuel fill-and-drain
tank, fuel-recovery tank, etc. The first step was
to compute the gamma-ray dose rate at the outer
surfoace of the ART neutron shield, without taking
inte account the effects of the several penetrations
for MoK lines, fuel lines, etc. The effects of
such penetrations must be considered separately.

Gamma-ray source strengths in the ART *Z were
obtained through the use of two-dimensional
neutron-diffusion calculations. [n computing the
dose at the surface of the neutron shield (the outer
loyer of the water region), on infinite-slab model
was used thet waes based on the geometry ond
scurce strengths in the equatorial plane of the
ART. The plane-to-sphere transformation® was
then oapplied to each portien of the source.
Secondory gomma rays from the lead shield were
neglected. The justification for this is that in the
Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) tests of the
gamma-ray dose rates in reflector-moderated
reactor mockups with various lead thicknesses,?
the dose varied exponentiolly with lead thickness
up to about 4.5 in.; the ART lead is 4.3 in. thick.
These dota ore interpreted to mean that the
intensity of gaomme rays penetrating the 4.3-in.-
thick lead shield of the ART wiil be much greater
than the intensity of gamma roys produced in the
lead.

The heat exchanger wos regorded as a distributed
source of gamma rays, the reflector as a fomily of
five plane surfoce sources, and the core as a set
ot six plane surface sources. The shells were
treated as plone surface sources. The energy

spectro? were divided into energy groups with
upper limits at 0.75, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 9 Mev.

The buildug factors used were those for water,
since the outer layer of the shield is 31.5 in. of
water. The buildup factor was uvsed in the form

Blur) = a + bur ,

with the constants & aond & evolvated fo fit the
buildup-factor curves® for ur between 5 and 15
mean free paths.

The calculoted dose rote ot the surface of the
water bag {r = 170 cm) is 1840 r/hr. The relative
importance of each source is indicated by the
percentage coniributions to the total dose rate:
core, 22%; outer core shell, 9%; reflector, 12%;
reflector shell, 35%; heat exchanger, 22%.

In such a calculation the gquestion arises of
whether the buildup-factor method can yield volid
results for the reflector-moderatedreactor geometry.
The gomma rays penetrate @ substantial thickness
of lead, and, since the lead absorption cross
section has a minimum for gammea-roy energies
from 3 to 5 Mev, it might be supposed thot most
gomma rays entering the water would have energies
in this range, For the higher energy sources, use
of water buildup foctors might then lead to appreci-
oble errors.  In order to check this point, on
attempt was mode to determine the energy spectrum
of the gamma rays entering ond leaving each
component of the shield. Use was made of the
energy spectra from monoenergetic point sources in
infinite homogeneous media, as computed by
Goldstein and Wilkins.?> The sources were divided
into a set of point sources, ond the dose rate at
the inner surface of the lead shield was computed
for each source energy group. Attenvotion and
degradation of the rodiation in the lead were then
computed® as if the flux incident on the inner
surface of the lead were duve to a set of point
monoenergetic sources at the center of ¢ hollow
covity inside the lead, The same procedure wos
applied to the water with a new set of effective

energy spectrum emerging from the |ead.

This method of calculatien yields a gamma-ray

ray energy group are listed below:

The fast-neutron dose rote ot the shield surfoce

the transformation from finite-disk surface source
to spherical surfoce source and the factors thot

Otis.® For an LTSF equivalent surface source
strength of 0.428 x 10~? w/em?, the calculated

was 3.86 rem/hr, Thus ot o distance of 50 ft from
the center of the ART operating at 60 Mw with

The data were analyzed in detoil for two shut-

downs from the following initial steady-state
operating conditions:
Condition Rua 1 Run 2
Shatt speed, rpm 3506 24678
Fluid flow, gpm 1220 1216
Dischorge head, ft 394 212
Fower supplied, ha 119.3 68.8

Partial checks of data from several other tests
indicated almost identical results for the con-
ditions invelved, All the analyzed test dota
closely motched the computed decay characteristic
shown on Fig. 1.3.1 for on initial kinetic energy-
to-power ratio of 2, that is, KE /HP; = 2, and
speed decay down to about 30%. Below the 30%
speed-decay region, the system mechanicol friction
becomes increasingly more significant, since the

system kinetic-energy driving force has dropped
to less than 10% of the original value.

The operating decay characteristics were sub-
stantially the same for both sets of conditions,
and therefore only the test data for the shutdown
frem a shaft speed of 3506 rpm were fully reduced
to completed plots, as shown in Figs. 1.3.2 ond
1.3.3. The pressure characteristic curve shown
on Fig. 1.3.2 was obtained by using the premise
that pressure varies as the square of the speed
and the flow rate, With other conditions constant,
the flow rote is considered te be proportional to
the pump-shaft speed, as previously indicated.

The analytical expressions for the two test
conditions would be identical if the initiol kinetic
energy-to-power ratios were the same. The power
ratio for the two conditions is 119.3/68.8 = 1,735,
and the experimental data indicated that the decay
characteristics for the two sefs of conditions were
identical; therefore, the kinetic energy ratic must
he neorly the same as the power ratic, An investi-

two conditions reveoled that

Thus it can be seen that the rotating kinetic
energy-to-power ratios were about the same for
the two test conditions.

The fluid kinetic energy cannot be included in
the analytical expressions, since the flow was
substantiolly constont, In view of this, it would
seem that the flow inertia is negligible, as com-
pared with the rotating inertia, in its contribution
to the system kinetic energy. If the foregoing
deductions are considered to be the case, the
major contributors to continuing system operation
after o power loss are the rotating elements of
the pump ond the electric drive motor. This also
means that the only appreciable contribution to
any extended continving fluid circulotion during
the decay period is received from the stored
kinetic energy in the mechanically rotating parts,
end that the pump is stili the driving force and
is inducing ftuid displacement in a manner sub-
stantially the same as during the previous steady-
state operation,

Since the flyid flow is dependent upon the pump
driving force, fluid travel around the circulating
loop should be substantially proportional to the
pump ongular displacement. The information pre-
sented on Fig. 1.3.3 was determined by opplying

18

this principle to the test data described above in
combination with the computed volumes of seg-
ments of the ART primory MaK heat-dump circuit,
The volumes used in the preparation of Fig. 1.3.3
were those designated circuit 1 in Table 1.3.1.

confrol and a better safety margin in operation.

The on-off level probe being tested consists of
a /ﬁ in. -dlq copper wire contained in ond insulated
from a f -in.-0D, 0.025-in.-wall lnconel tube at
ali points, except the bottom, where if is welded.
A current of B to 10 amp, 60 cps, is supplied to
the probe. A relay across the probe is energized
when the NaK level is below the probe ond de-
energized when NoK touches the probe, A similar
on-off probe with an Inconel center wire and a
bridge amplifier for the control circuit is being
studied. The probe would con5|51 of a .-'"]6-”1 -dia
Inconel wire insulated in a fﬁ-m -00, 0.025-in.-
wall Inconel tube. The bridge circuit would be
balonced when the NaK touched the probe and
unbalanced when the NaK level was below the
probe. Since the tempercture coefficient of resis-
tivity of Inconel is low, the zero shift resulting
from a temperature change would not be so lorge as
in the present probe. A specification has been
prepared and submitted to manufacturers for o
packaged amplifier to be used in this bridge
circuit.

An especially fabricated spark plug with a
bery Hium oxide insuvlator wos tested in NaK as
on on-off level probe, The plug failed after 20 he
of operation becouse of short circuiting of the
insulator. The plug was removed ond reworked,
and it is to be retested when the NaK-level test
facility (referred to in previous section) is back
in ¢peration.

Several special plugs with insulators high in
alumina and magnesium content were received from
the Champion Spark Plug Co. for testing ond
evceluating. These plugs will also he tested in
the NaK-level test focility or other test rigs as
soon as possible.

The usefulness of the conventienal type of spark
plug as o reliable on-off probe is very doubtful
ot this time, The plug life is very short when the
probe is operated at temperctures above 450 1o
500°F, and there is always the danger of gas
leakoge through the insulator, This leokoge
problem could be very sericus if the plug were
used with radicoctive fluids, and it would be
necessory to completely con or seal the plug.
Therefore the use of the spark plug as a reactor
type of level element is not recommended, ond
the development and testing of the resistance type

of on-off probe is continuing. It is expected that

22

this unit will replace the spark plug except in
systems which can be operated safely ond reliably
within the spark-plug limitations, or in systems
in which the process fluid electrical conductivity
is too low for use with the resistive type of on-off
level probe.

FUEL-EXPANSION-TANK LEYEL INDICATOR

Dynamic-Level Tests

Four helium-bubbler-type fuel-level indicators
completed 1000.hr tests at 1500°F in the dynamic-
level test rig, described previously,” without
plugging of the bubbler tubes, Two of the bubblers
were fabricated of 31’ -in.-0D, 0, 065-m.-wu|1 Inconel
tubing, ond the olher two were / -in,-QOD, 0.035-
in.-wall Inconel tubing. The hellum used for these
tests was passed through a Drierite filter and
through copper turnings maintained ot 1000°F in
order to getter the oxygen and remove the moisture.

After completion of these tests, the focility was
modified in an attempt to cbtain a better series
of level calibrations. The medifications included
a means for accurately vorying the fuel level
continugusly in the two vessels by using gos
pressure; a new bubbler design with a shallow V
in the bottom of the tube woas used; and the
bubblers were positicned within 0.010 in, of the
correct level while the vessel was at the operating
temperature.  An improved type of voriable coli-
brating probe was designed, installed, and cali-
brated ot the operating temperature. Also, the fuel
was thoroughly mixed prier to calibration to
preciude density errors due fo thermal gradients.
As a result of these modificotions, the firss
accurate, repreducible series of static level cali-
brations was obtained. The maximum level error
was 0.08 in, in 5 in., or 1.6%.
reproducible within 1.5%.

A dynamic-level test scheduled to operate for
3000 hr at 1500°F has completed 750 hr without
bubbler plugging. Prior to startup, however, with
the bubblers operating in static fuel ot 1350PF,
otl four bubblers plugged in a period of 24 hr, for
reasons unknown, Two bubblers were removed and
the contents sent for onalysis. The other two
were unplugged by roising the fluid temperature

to 15300°F, The bubbler plugging problem hos
become so serious that a separate series of tests,
described below, is to be made to determine the
cause,

Static-Level Tests

The average life of a helium-bubbler type of
level indicater hos been found to be about 1100 hr
in g static-level system in which a NaK scrubber
is used to reduce the moisture content of the
helium ard in which copper turnings mcintcined
at 1000°F are vsed to reduce the oxygen content,
Since the average life falls far short of the 3000-hr
life specified, ottempts are being made to de-
termine the cause of plugging of the bubbler tubes.
Although the technigques for onalyzing fuel mixtures
for oxygen compounds are not precise, it is thought
that the moterial which plugs the bubbler tubes
is ZrO,. Therefore o special batch of oxyfluoride-
free fuel will be used in the next series of tests.,

It has been suggested that @ cold trap be used
in place of the NaK scrubbers for removing
moisture from the helium, since NaK sntrginment
might contribute to the plugging. Methods for
checking the oxygen content of the helium and
for reducing the oxygen content ore being studied,
Further, the vessels used for future tests are to
be hydrogen fired.

These recommendations are to be incorporated
into a simple series of bubbler tests in static
fuel, without level instrumentation, and the ad-
ditional precoutions described below will be taken,

1. An all-silver-soldered spectrometer-leak-tight
system, with bellows valves, will be employed.

2. The system will be flushed thoroughly by
alternately pressurizing with helium ond evacu-
ating.

3. The dewpoint and oxygen content of the
supply helivm will be continuously monitored.

4. The purge helium will be preheated to the
temperature of the fuel,

As a further check on the role of oxygen impurity
in the helium as a cause of piugging, one test
series will be run with heflium of known oxygen
content, as furnished in commercial gas, and
onother test series will be run with helium passed
over uraniym furmnings held at 600°C to reduce the
oxygen confent to as low a value os possible.

FRESSURE TRANSMITTERS FOR USE AT HIGH
TEMPERATURES

W. R. Miller

Evaluation tests of commercial transmitters for
use at high temperatures were continued. Two of
the six units mentioned previously® that employ
differential tronsformers were tested, The firs?
unit tested was not satisfactory in that the over-all
occuracy was only 3,3% full scale at 1200°F. The
other unit was somewhat better, with an over-all
accuracy of 2.1% full scale ot 1200°F. The
differential-transformer method of detection has
proved to be vausually difficult to use in that the
tield of the Calrod heaters used to maintain the
aperating temperature has on effect on the output
readings. shielding is
helpful but does not relieve the situation com-
pletely. At present two more units of the type
shown in Fig. 1.3.5 are undergoing tests.

The unit mentioned previously® that employs a
variable-permeance type of pressure transducer
was tested, but no datc were obtained. Lack of
suitable aligning guides allowed the core of the
transducer to rub the coil housing. This wunit

Redesigned madels of the four-legged strain-
gage type of transmitters (Fig. 1.3.7) were also
tested. Armor was added to protect the capillary,
ond o shock-mounted sub-base was added within
the _ase for vibration isolation. The redesigned
caose eliminates zero shift when the cover is
tightened. Because of a poorly designed shipping
clamp the strain goges were domaged during
shipment, and therefore the test results for these
models were not up to the standord set by the
results obtained with the original six prototype
medels,  The shipping clamp hos now been
modified by the manufacturer.

The next lot of four-legged strain-gage trans-
mitters will feature a sensor housing with improved
stress choracteristics for use with more corrosive
process fluids. The details of this design change
have been satisfactorily resolved with the manu-
facturer.

MAGMNETIC FLOWMETERS
G. H. Burger C. L. Pearce’

Six of the 3)-in. magnetic flowmeters purchased
for the ETU and the ART were installed in the
tlowmeter test loop filled with NaK for calibration
agoinst a water-calibrated {(0,25% accurate) venturi.
As stated previously® the units will be calibrated
over the widest temperature and flow-rate ranges
possible with the test loop. These ranges will
cover, in general, the design ranges of the ETU
and the ART,

Operation of the loop began on February 12,
1957, and it had operated a totel of 40 hr when it
became necessory to drain the NaK for repairs
ond medifications of the loop. During the 40-hr
operating period, fluid flow rates of up to 1600 gpm
and fluid temperatures of up to 1350°F were
achieved.

The dota obtoined with the mognetic flowmsters,
while not ¢t all conclusive becouse of the short
operating time, did give general indications of
the operating choracteristics to be expected. [t
appears that ot least four of the six flowmeters
now installed in the loop will be acceptable for
the ETU if the accuracy specifications ore met
in subsequent tests.

Six of the ART-ETU 2-in. magnetic flowmeters
are being installed in another test loop for cali-
bratien against o water-calibrated {0.25% occurate)
venturi. Operotion of this loop will probably start
in May 1957,

The :’}é-in. magnetic flowmeters designed for plug
indicater and cold-trap flow rate meosurements
are being fobricated. Several of the units will
be tested for temperature effects on the magnets.
These units will not be calibrated because the
accuracy requirement is +15%.

TURBINE FLOWMETERS FOR USE AT HIGH
TEMPERATURES

G. H. Burger

The 1-in. turbine flowmeter, designoted unit No.
2-Rev. 3, described previously,? was installed in
a forced-circulation gos-fired Inconel leop con-
taining NuF-ZrF4—UF4 (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30)
for calibration egainst an orifice by using Taylor
transducers as pressure sensors and for an en-
durance test of 3000 hr. Operation of the loop
was storted on January 8, 1957, and the turbine
operated satisfactorily for approximately 340 hr,
|+ was then noted that the turbine output frequency
was Considertu different from what it should
have been bosed upon the orifice-measured fiow
rate, and an investigotion showed that the unit
was not operating., An x-rgy examination of the
unit showed, as for as could be determined, that
the unit was not breken, |t was therefore believed
thot, since the unit hod been operoted in NakK
systems three times previously, the bearing had
been oxidized to some extent and that operation
in the salt mixture caused it to bind after a short
operating time,
the loop is drained ond exomined in order to
determine the cause of failure.

The unit will be removed when

A 3 .ia, turbine flowmeter was installed in a
forced-circulation loop filled with NaK in order
to test the unit under actual operating conditions.

Prior to installation in the lcop the unit hod been
tested ond calibrated at a high flow rate in a loep
containing water, The unit performed satisfoctorily
during the calibration tests. The calibration data
are shown in Fig. 1.3.8, The only unusual
operating characteristic wos noted at a flow rote
of 600 gpm, at which point the tyrbine ‘'chattered’’;
at flow rates other than this no vunusual chatter
of vibrotion was noted. The total test time with
water was approximately 6 to 8 hr, and flow rates
of up to 1100 gpm were recorded. |t wos felt on
the bosis of the results of the water tests that
the unit wos satisfactory for calibration under
aperating conditions in a NaK system and that
any possible failure of the uait could not damage
the test loop.

Operafion of the loop wos started on February 12,
1957, ond the turbine flowmeter operated os
expected for approximately 12 min. The loop flow
was started at 420 gpm and was rapidly increased
te 1220 gpm, as indicated by the turbine flowmeter,
At some point between the flow rates of 970 and
1220 gpm, however, the unit failed in some manner.
At the approximate time of failure and possibly
during all or part of the operating time, the loop
opetators could hear chaitering of the unit., The
tempergture of the circulating NaK qt the time of
tailure was 155°F, The loop continued to aperate
ofter the turbine fallure and eventuclly reached
o flow rate of 1680 gpm and o maximum fluid
temperature of 1350°F, which wos held for only
a short time and then lowered. The loop operated
a total time of approximately 40 hr before pump
surges necessitated shutdown. The surges may
have resulted from ingassing brought about by

improper operation of the surge tank level system

while measuring venturi pressures.

On  Februery 14, 1957, before disassembly of
the loop, @ radicgraph wos made of the turbine
flowmeter which showed that the bearings were
broken and thas o number of blades were missing.
Cn February 18 the flowmeter was removed from
the loop, and the indications of the rodiograph
were confirmed, as shown in Fig. 1.3.9. Eight
of the ten blades were missing; the two remaining
blodes were bent opposite to the direction of
rotation; and both bearing shafts were broken.
The main throttling valve waos removed from the
system, and six of the blades were found therein,
A seventh blade was found under the volve housing

in the drain line. The eighth blade has not yet

The dynomic tests of lubriconts under irradiation
thot were to be run in the LITR3 are, rather, to be
run in o gommo-irradiation facility in the MTR
canal. With the MTR facility it will be possible to
use o slightly modified fuli-scale pump rotary
assembly ond to examine the unit for damage
immediately upon removal from the gamma-irradi-
otion field. The present schedule colls for fest
operations to begin next gquarter,

The final selection of a lubricant-cootont for
the reactor pumps will be based on the results of
the gamma-irradiation tests in the MTR, Since both
orgonic liquids ond highly refined paraffin-base
mineral oils ore being considered at this time, all
parts of the pumps and the external lubricant-
pumping system are designed to be compatible
with either liquid., For exomple, copper is incom-
patible with organic liquids, and therefore copper
parts in the seals and journcal beorings ere being
reploced.  All-stainless-steel bellows-seal test
assemblies were ordered ond will be incorporoted
into the MTR test units. Journal bearings fabri-
coted from Alcoa alloy 750-T5 were selected to
replace the original bronze bearings. The small
percentage of copper (0.7 to 1.3%) in this alloy is
probebly insignificont with respect to the organic
liquids of interest, but a somple of the alloy will
be tested in UCON LB-140-X, an orgonic liquid,
before the MTR test is made. There are no copper
parts in the external lubricant-pumping system.

Two 1000-hr tests were conducted to determine
the suitobility of the aluminum olloy, Alcoo 750-T5,
for this particulor bearing application in which
the effective journal beoring arec is 2.4 in.%
Gulfcrest 34 was used os the lubricant in both
tests. Thetest conditions are given in Table 1.4.1,

Neither test gave any evidence of bearing mal-
function, and both the bearings were equally as

Continued tests of the modified Durametallic

seals? being developed for use as seals in NaK
pumps have produced further encouraging results,
More than 5000 hr of operating time was logged for
such seols, including 2500 hr in a rotary element
pumping NoK ot 1400°F and 2500 hr in a me-
chanical shakedown stand with the seals subjected
to a wide range of diHferential pressures from
20 psig, which simulates a vacuum filling operation,

to 275 psig, which is more than a maximum
catastrophe pressure, and to rubbing speeds from
0 to 60 fps.

It wos found thot for the very high differential
pressures, obove 200 psig, a slight design modifi-
cation will be necessary to prevent relative motion
berween the positioning collor for the lower seal
aond the shaft, On the bosis of these gocd test
results, the Durametallic seals hove been specified
for use in the ART MNaK pumps.
Tests have shown the buno-N-base O-rings

recommended by outside venders for use with
UCON LB-140-X lubricant tc be quite satisfactory,
Similar tests showed the bunag-N-bose O-rings to
be satisfactory for use with Gulfcrest 34 lubricant,
and therefore this elastomeric secl can be used
for the reactor pumps if either of these lubriconts
is acceptable. [f, however, the MTR tests prove
these lubricants to be wnsatisfactory, the seal
material may ogain become a problem. For the
NaK  pumps, commercially aovailable
elastomer seals will be satistactory, since Gulf-
crest 34 will be the lubricant used.

during the change from zero power to full power
operation of the ART. In general, operction is not
affected by a liquid-ievel change when the liquid
level is 2 in. or more above the floor of the

showad a slight decrease, the expansion-tank
fHlow rates decreased, the power required to drive

Test operatien of an ART fuel pump with a
meodel 32 impeller and NﬂF-Zer-UF (50-46-4
mole %, fuel 30) as the circulated tlyid was started
in December 1956. At the cperating conditions of
645 gpm, 2700 rpm, and a fuel temperature of
1200°F, the head is 1 to 2 ft lower thon that
obtained for water with the some impeller, vofute,

pressure-measuringdevices inthat the zero position
shifts from doy to day, and in order to obtain
relioble pressure data it is necessary to calibrote
these instruments before each test run by pressur-
izing the loop with helium to as high as 100 psig.

The off-gos riser connecting the pump pot to the
ZrF ,-vopor trap has been replaced twice during
the course of operation. The first time the riser
had to be replaced because a ZrfF, plug formed
when the fuel temperatures were
reach 1500°F. The

Zer to deposit and plug the riser. The line
was replaced without terminoting the test. The
off-gas riser hod to be reploced ¢ second time
when a leak developed. This time the test oper-
ation had to be shut down. Partial plugs of ZrF
have also occurred in the gas passage through the
pump barrel, possibly as the result of reverse flow
or back diffusion of gas through the pump borrel,
Performance and cavitation dota are being ob-
tained, and endurance tests are planned.

Fuel Pump Endurance Tests
P. G. Smith

The ART fuel pump being tested for endurance
wos shut down on November 29, 1956, with a total
of 2587 tir of Uperuﬁng time and 120 thermal cycles
over the temperature ronge of 1400 to 1100°F.
The fluid circulated during these tests was
NoF-ZiF -UF | (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30).

Examination of the pump impeller ofter this test
revealed that it wos in good cendition, and it
showed only very slight domage, if ony, as a result
of high-temperature operation.  Examination of
other parts showed that the upper metal O-ring seal
allowed fuel to leak into the annular space between
the pump barrel and the thermc! barrier can. This
cavsed the formaticn of o ZrF, plug in the riser
connecting the pump pot to the vapor trap, which,
in turn, caused the sluggish and errotic off-gos
flow noted during operation.

There was no evidence of lube oil legkage from
the pump seals during the tests, but upon disas-
sembly the lower seo! was found to be worn to
such an extent that it should have permitted o
small amount of leakage. There was evidence of
this leakage inside the thermal barrier con, which
was not filled with barrier material for this test
and which contained o small amount of carben
deposit.

The pump wos cleaned and reassembled with
new seals ond placed bock in operation for further
testing. It hos accumulated o total of 550 hr more
of continuous operation and 35 thermal cycles
over the tempercture range of 1400 to 1100°F.
The lube oil leakage rates are 5 cm3/day from
the lower seal and zero from the upper seal.

There had been no trouble with the hydraulic
drive for the past 1240 hr of pump operation. This
may be attributed to a back pressure of 100 to
120 psig being mointained on the discharge side
of the motor, os recommended by the manufacturer,
to ensure that the piston shoes are seated on the
wobble plate at all times.

Sodium Pump Development Water Tests
J. J. W. Simen

The hydroulic problems to be solved in the ART
sodium pump are not yet fully delineated. An
initial oppraisal ond the results of development
work tc dote indicote similarities between this
pump and the fuel pump, for which five major points
were investigated,’ nomely, system pressure
tluctuations, gas pressure grodient down the sheoft
annulus in the direction of purge gas flow, flow
through the centrifuge before ingassing occurs,
pressure levels based on ART stress limitations,
and cavitation. In considering eoch of these
oroblems in relation to the sodium pump, it is
apporent that, based on tests mode to dote, the
pressure fluctuations are small, the flow required
into the expansion tank is smell enough {5 gpm
maximum, per pump) not to cause ingassing through
the centrifuge, and the ART stress limitations do
not impose stringent requirements on the pressure
levels. The sodium pump will require a decreosing
gas-pressure gradient in the direction of gas How

A new pump barrel was designed and is being
fabricated that more closely mocks up the ART
sodium pump barrel ond the exponsion tank configu-
ation. The differences between the present con-
figuration and the new pump barrel, which mocks

The volute in the new configuration is now fully
instrumenied for measuring the radicl unbolance
force ot the centrifuge discharge area. Also, the
effect on pump performance ol fluid leakage be-
tween the heat exchanger inlet and the volute con

The tests hampered by
ingossing of the system, which becomes more
pronounced whea the flow rate in the main loop is
reduced. Several runs were made fo obtain
performance data, however, and data obtained in a
low-speed run correfated reasoncbly well with
dato obtained in the eariier development tests.®
The data obtained in runs at speeds sufficiently
high to bracket the design head are shown in
Fig. 1.4.8.

No work has been done, as yet, toward the
solution of the gas-pressure grodient problem.

Sodium Pump Barrel Seal Test

J. W. Cooke?

Free movement between the sodium pump barrel
and volute will be required in the ART to allow
for radial movement to accommodate thermol ex-
pansion and axiol misalignment resulting from
accumulative assembly tolerances. A seal must he
provided in this region to minimize leckage of
sodium between the heat exchanger inlet and the
pump centrifuge outiet regions. Two designs of
multiple-ring seols, Fig. 1.4.9, have been tested
with water.

The maximum leckage rote for seal design No. |
was 2.1 gpm at a pressure differential of 50 psi
and on axiol spacing of 0.015 in, The moximum
leckage rate for seal design No. 7 wos | gpm at a
pressure differential of 80 psi ond an axial spacing
of 0.0135 in. Both the pressure differential and
spacing at which these maximum leckage rates
occurred are more severe thon the estimoted ART
values. It is onticipated that the moximum leakoge
rotes given above will not seriously interfere

and flow rotes at a NaK temperature of 1200°F
are presented in Fig. 1.4.11. The cavitation
data hod to be taken ot different speeds for each
of several censtont flow rates, 1000, 1220, and
1400 gpm, since it was not possible to maintain a
constant speed with the wound-rotor motor which
has o step-type resistance speed control. The

plot, the suction pressure
suppress cavitation over the normal pump cperating
range was plotted, as shown in Fig. 1.4.12, for
two NgK temperatures, 1200 ond 1400°F. The
vapor pressure of NoK increases by 5.33 psi from
1200 to 1400°F, ond the constant spread between o
given constant speed line for eoch of the two
temperatures is very necrly 5.33 psi. The gos
pressure on the pump surge tank is 0.5 psi less
than the static suction pressure and therefore con

be determined from Fig. 1.4.12,

In order to further show the effect of vapor
pressure on cavitation, dota were token at o given
head and flow rate for NaK temperotures from
720°F, where the vapor pressure is essentially
zere, to 1400°F, where the vepor pressure is
approximately 7.5 psia.  The results of these
tests in terms of the cavitation parameter, o, are
indicoted by Fig. 1.4.13. If covitation voried only
with wvapor pressure at a given pump operatiag
point, it would be expected that ¢ would remain
constant over the temperature range. As may be
seen in Fig. 1.4.13, there wos essentially o
constant ¢ at temperatures from 1180 to 1400°F,
and o slightly higher but constont ¢ ot 720 and
914°F. It is believed thot the results would
be more significant if speed and flow rote were
held constant instead of head ond flow rate in
order to hold constant impeller inlet conditions,
ond therefore additional cavitation data are to be
obtained.

This pump and its associated loop have now
been operated approximately 2100 hr ot temper-
atures from 1100 to 1400°F. The rotory element
of the pump was removed and inspected affer
1700 hr operction, ond it was confirmed that, as
suspected, some NaK had entered the oil caotch
basin when the NaK level rose in the pump tank
cs the result of ingassing after approximately
800 hr of operation. The pump hod, however,
continued to operate satisfactorily for the next
900 hr. A consideroble amount of carben from the
oil was deposited on the pump shoft and on the
radictor baffles in the pump tank, and thus it was
apparent that the oil seol leokage had run down
the pump shaft, even though there was a 50-liter/day
helium purge from the oil catch basin and «
500-liter/day helium purge down the pump shaft
annulus and out the pump tank reflux condenser.

I+ is believed that a cylindrical riser around the
shaft to obove the seal interface will direct the
leakage oil inte the catch basin ond prevent
leakage down the shoft into the NaK. On the
pump being tested the riser was below the seal
interface. Further examination showed that there
were no signs of rubbing of the impeller against
labyrinth seals, even though the pump wos oper-
ated cccosionally at conditions well off the volute-
balonce line.'3 The impeller ond volute appeared
to be in excellent condition.

not affected the oil seal leakage purge system.
The impeller surfaces had an etched appearonce,
but approval for further operation was given by the

rotary assembly were measured before and after
this test run, ond it was found that all dimensions
had remained constant, except the volute mouth,
which had opened up from 0.003 to 0.010 in.,
probably because of stress relief and pressure
stresses, An additional test is plonned to provide
further data on operation without a heliuvm bleed

Heat removal from the pump bearrel by the lubri-
cation and cocling oil was measured at several

from 1.8 kw at 1200°F, the normal operating level,
to 2.3 kw at 1400°F, the maximum operating level.

Bosed on earlier experience with the primary
NoK pumps, 1*a % _-in.-dia hole was drilled through
the top of the discharge pipe inside the pump tank
to permit gas trapped in the discharge line during
filling to be vented. This vent permitted satis-
foctory pump priming. In order to further determine
the effectiveness of this vent, a section of piping
was instalied in the discharge Jeg of the test loop
to deliberately trop any quontity of gos up to o
valve of 0.45 t3. A series of pump priming tests
was conducted wherein the loop was filled ot
0 psig with 0.45 #13 of gas tropped in the loop.
The pump tank gas pressure was then raised to
15 psig before ottempting to stur‘tlfhe pump, A
foter series of tests was alse conducted wherein
the gas pressure was raised to 15 psig before
the loop was filled so thot twice the previous
amount of gas was trapped. In ofl coses, it was
possible to start and fully prime the pump by
following the starting and stopping technique
described below. The pump is brought to an
operating speed of 1800 rpm (this speed represents
the first control step speed on the wound-rotor
drive motor) ond operated ot thot speed until the
discharge pressure drops slightly, which indicates
that gas has entered the pump, and then the pump
is stopped. This procedure is repeated until the
dischorge pressure no longer drops. The average
number of startup attempts required ranged from a
minimum of seven for the first series of tests to
17 for the later series of tests with twice os much
trrapped gos. |t appears that with this technique
the pump can be started with troepped gas in the
system, ond it will not be necessary to vecuoum-fill
the loop.

type SHE-7. When test operations were storted,
proper NaK flow could not be established. The
loop was drained, ond examination revecled that
the cold-trap economizer inlet and all but four of
the radiator tubes were plugged with oxide. The
oxide had apparenily been deposited in the main
NaK piping at the end of the preceding test,'8
which, as described above, was terminated because
of a failure of the cold-trap economizer. When

with NaF-ZrF ~UF, (56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70).
York radiotor ldc:-. 15 has been thoroughly cleaned
and will be installed in SHE test stand B as the

The first part '8 of the endurance test of Black,
Sivalls & Brysen heat exchangers Nos. 1 and 2
{type |HE-8) was completed in IHE test stand
B. The test included 503 hr of operation of heat
exchonger No. 1 with a NaK inlet temperature of
1700°F and the other conditions of temperoture,
pressure, and flow rate shown in Fig. 1.4,18.
The NaK pressure drop through heat exchanger
No. 1, calculated on the basis of constant flow,
increosed to approximately 5.4 times the initial
level, and the NaK pressure drop through the
radiator increased to approximately 1.3 times
the initial level. These pressure drop increases
in the NaK circuit ore attributed, as before, ¥
to the byuildup of mass-tronsferred materigl in
the small-diometer tubing of the test units. Black,

described previously.?!  With the improved im-
pellers the liquid spraying and sloshing noted
previously in the expansion tank and the resuliont
weting of the tank ceiling were greatly reduced
because of the reduction in the gross inflow to the
tank. Ingassing of the main circuits with one pump
stopped and the other still ruaning was not
appreciably different with the improved impeller,
and flow-rote fluctuation and pump suction pres-
sures remoined essentially unchanged. With the
bypass loop connecting the pump suction pipes
wide open, stopping one pump with the other stil]
running cauysed the total flow through the external
main loops to be reduced by a factor of . How-
ever, the flow continued in the normal direction in

each external main loop with no reversal, and the
Hlow rote in the external main loop of the stopped
pump was 7'.:"]0 that in the external main loop of
the operating pump. One significance of this
result with regard to reactor operation is that any
tendency for local overheating in an inrermediate
heat exchanger tube bundle wouyld be minimized
following stoppage of one-half the fuel, sodium,
and NakK pumps.

The model 32 impeller has greatly reduced the
problem of liquid rising in the shoft eanulus.
With the criginal impelier, liquid rose inte the
shoft annulus of a pump which was stopped if the
other pump was still running. In tests of the new
impeller over o wide range of pump speeds and
gos flow rates down the shoft annulus, the only
instance of liquid rising up the shaft annulus
upon stoppage of one pump occurred when the

more thon 30 sec elopsed following pump stoppage
belore water wos detected 0.4 in. wp the annulus,
the lowest sensing point. In operation of the
reactor, the reactor dump cycle would be under way
within this period if o pump stopped.

During the quoster the entire moin loop circuit
was sant fo the Hydroulics Laboratory of the
University of Tennessee for calibration of the
external moin loop orifices. This calibration
showed arifice coefficients 2 to 3% less than the
accepted values, and also showed no variation of
the cosfficients with external main loop valve
settings in the range of interest, A special test
was colso performed in which water was pumped
inte the common purp discharge pipe at o rate of
1300 gpm, and ony Huctuctions of mein loog erilice
differentiol pressures were observed.  Sewvercl
repetitions of this test yielded ditferent reswlts,

In abaut hall the runs no  fluctuctions were
ohserved. In the other runs fluctustions of on
orifice diffarentiol pressure, similar to those

observed with the complete oluminum test rig,
ware observed. In these University of Tennessee

tosts, woter was supphied by two dissimilor pumps

The purap wvolutes in the twin pumps ware
carefully exomined while thaloop wos disassemblad
for the colibrotions described ahove. Differences
in the design of the volutes in comparison with
the voiute design specified for the reacior were
noted, ond the cluminum volutes were modified to

valve was received during the latter part ol the
quarter from Block, Sivalls & Bryson, designated
valve No. 6, which incorporates a swiveled piug.
Since the swiveled plug design is now considered
to be unsatisfoctory, leakage rote tests will be
made on this volve with water only. The two
available test stands will be used to test only
valves which have rigidly mounted plugs ond
which incorporate other refinements now con-
sidered to be essential for the suvccessful oper-
ation of this volve design.

Valve 5B, which had @ rigidly mounted, spherical
molybdenum plug and a conical copper seuat,
exhibited negligible leakoge during the first 23
operoting cycles. The test of this valve wos
terminated after 430 hr because the bellows
ruptured while the valve was closed. The bellows
is composed of stamped Inconel disks welded
together at their inner and outer peripheries, and
foilure occurred at an peripneral
Preliminary metallographic inspection showed that
the failure was located at the point of fusion
between the weld bead and the disk. Some
scattered impurities were observed in this orea
which may have contributed to the failure. The
pressure differential
approximately 3 psi and therefore not high enough

inner weld.,

across the bellows was
to couse direct stress failure,

Valve 5C was assembled by using refinished
parts from valve 5B. The conical surface of the
seat was remachined and the spherical surface of
the plug was polished, The high initial leokage
rates that occurred when tests of volve 5C were
started made it necessary to use ¢ stem closing
force of 1000 Ib. The average leakage rate was
0.5 em3/hr during the first 25 operating cycles
with this stem force., No measurable leckage
occurced during the 500-hr closure test, and teakage
rates during eleven oaperating cycles since the
E00-hr closure test hove been erratic, with on
average of 2.5 e¢m3/hr. The leakage rate has
increased raopidly since the thirty-third operating
cycle. This valve hos now been operated for
1100 hr, and the test will continue until an oper-
ating time of 1500 hr has been reached.

Valve 4C, which had a rigidly mounted, spherical
Kentanium cermet {K-131A) plug and @ conical
Kentanium cermet {K-151A) seat, was tested for
1500 hr ot 1300°F. The average leckage rate
during the first 25 operoting cycles wos 1.4
em3/he, 1.2 em=/hr during the 500-hr closure
test, and 2.4 cm3/hr during the last 25 operoting
cycles. Relatively low stem forces, 500 to 864 Ib,

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 37, 1957

were required for opening this valve. This valve
is to be tested again with the diametrical ¢clearance
of the inner stem guide increcsed from 0.008 to
0.080 in. This valve has given the best over-all
performance of any valve tested to date.

A valve of o modified design is being fabricated
for testing. The new design incorporates o backup
bellows to supplement the seal bellows and im-
proved stem-alignment control. Also, a valve that
will have o spider guide mounted in the end con-
directly obove the seor ring is being
assembled to determine whether volve alignment

nection

can be improved by guiding the plug at a point as
close to the seot as prociical. Kentonium 162B
inserts are being used for the bearing surfaces of
the guide.

"“InsLine” Valve Operaters — A simple rig has
been set up for tests of the Philadelphia Gear
Works “‘in-line’’ actuater that is to be used on the
ART NaK valves. The test assembly consists of
a stmuloted valve on which the actuator is mounted
and on opposing actuator that is vsed to determine
the “'in-line’" stem thrust. Provisions are made for
heating of the simuloted valve body to determine
the effect of temperature on the actuator operating
characteristics,

tested in mockups?? in order to determine the
pressure drops.  Three of these regions were
tested this quarter. Since the heot loads, lengths,
ond entrance conditions of the five rows of cooling
holes through the beryllium reflector are different,
the sodium flow through these cooling holes must
be controlled to achieve a uniform temperature
pattern throughout the beryllium. A conveniens
method of contrel is to erifice individual holes ot
the beryllium equator joint with ¥-in.-thick orifice
plugs. Such plugs with orifice holes of 0.0595
to 0.1875 in. in inside diometer were tested,

The results of the tests are shown on Fig. 1.4.2]
as pressure loss coefficients, which include the
total loss for the entronce orifice and 4.56 in. of
hole length, vs the orifice diameter. A range of
orifice sizes was tested, with the smallest orifice
in the reflector cooling hele reducing the flow to
obout 20% of the flow with the lorgest orifice.
As the result of an error in machining the first
sovthern hemisphere of the beryllium reflector,

ment. This misalignment will introduce an extra
heod loss ot the equotor joint, but it can be
compensated by proper selection of the orifice
size. A second series of orifice tests was run to
determine the effect of this misalignment on the
less coetiicient. The results of these tests are
also shown on Fig, 1.4.21.

Another test involved a full-scole mockup of
one-half of the symmetrical sodium circuit in the
reflector entrance regicon where the sodium supply
to the retlector flows down frem the two pump
tees, impinges on the c¢ircular boron cons, and
spreads out over the top of the reflector and the
core shell. The wooden test model of the top of
the beryllium reflector with the circular boron-
containing can in place and the spacer bars

north-head shells just obove the reflector,

The head loss in this reflector entrance region
at the design flow rate of 1.28 fi3/sec was found
to be 3.0 ft compared with an estimated 7.5 i1
The relotive tlow distribution through the beryllium
cooling holes was obicined by measuvring the
height of the water jet from each hole with the
complete test assembly turpned upside down, and
loss coefficients (Fig. 1.4.24) were calculoted for
each hole based on the jet height ond the hole
orientation shown in Figs. 1.4,22 ond 1.4.23. The
measurements showed that the cooling holes on
the shoulder around the pis-shaped depression in
the reflector carry much less flow (2 to 3 times)
than the rest of the holes.

Cold Traps ond Plugging Indicators
R. D. Peak D. A. Gardiner

Plugging indicators are required in each of the
eight NaK cold-trap circuits of the ART to monitor
the sodium oxide level. The plugging indicater
proposed for this serviced? is essentially the
same as the type which has been used successfully
on all the heat exchanger test stonds during the
past two years. Since the plugging indicators
used in the heat exchonger tests were never
calibrated, calibration tests of an ART prototype
plugging indicotor were conducted. A cold-trap
test stand®? was used for these calibration tests
with the ART plugging indicetor mounted vertically
in the stond,

The results of o typical test with the ART
plugging indicator are shown in Fig. 1.4.29. The
test is started by turning the Calrod hearer off ond
the cooling air on so that the NaK flowing through
the plugging plete gradually cools. At a certain
tempercture the NaK flow rate storts decreasing
abruptly because precipitated oxide has begun to
plug holes in the plugging plate. This temperoture,
called the bregk temperature becaouse of the change
in tlow rate, is on indication of the oxide content
of the NaK. After the breck temperature is de-
termined, the air is turned off and the Calrod is
turned on in order to disselve the precipitated
oxide,

All plugging indicator tests were made at o
nominal NoK flow rate of 0.5 gom. Experience on
the heat exchanger test stands has shown that the
breok temperoture is insensitive to this flow rate.
Since the flow rates in ART applicotion may vary,
dafa on pressure drop vs flow rate were obtained
and are shown in Fig. 1.4.30. Air flow rates were
also veoried, and it was found that the break temper-
atuwre was duplicated to within 5°F at o 400°F
breck temperature with air flow rates varying from
30 to B0 scfm, and to within 20°F at a 800°F breok
temperature with air flow rates varying from 8 to 40
scfm, The air pressure drop is shown in Fig.
1.4.31.

The plugging indicator was colibrated ageinst
chemical onolyses for sodium oxide obtained by
the Argonne sampler distillation methed.?4 The
chemical onolyses showed much greater inherent
variations thon did the breck temperatures. In an
ottempt to determine the causes for these vari-
ations, the Argonne sampler data were subjected
to the standord technigques of anclysis of veriance,
There appeared te be no significont differences
in instrumentation or sampler units from test to
test, but somples taken hy one technician were
significantly higher in sodium oxide then thase
obtained by the other nine technicians. The
standard deviction of the analyses was very large
and increosed as the number of the analyses
increased. Although 86 somples were taken, only
46 were analyzed successfully and used for the
calibration. The resulis of these analyses are
shown in Fig. 1.4.32 along with the corresponding

however, and the above phenomenon maoy not occur

ART-ETU REACTOR COMNSTRUCTION
AND ASSEMBLY

G. D. Whitman
H. M. Abele C. K. McGlothlan
G. W, Peach

The schedule for ossembly of the ETU ond ART
reactors was revised on the basis of delayed
delivery of components being produced by outside
vendors. |t is planned to increase the local shop
load by transferring the fabricotion of all pres-
sure shells, additional strut-load ring ossemblies
and filter plates from outside vendors’ plonts to
the shops at the Y-12 plant, The lecal shop is
fabricating the ETU north head and will assemble
the reactors.

The detailed design of the recctor is essentially
complete, with some work remaining to be done on
the design of the sodium annuli surrounding the
fuel overflow, off-gas, and fill-ond-droin lines.
Mumerous design changes have been made bosed
on further design studies, development tests,
component fabrication difficulties, and weld shrink-
age tests. The status of the major reactor sub-
assemblies and components is described befow.

North-Head Assembly

Work has been stopped on assembly of the north
head pending the arrival of the sodium-fo-NaK
heat exchangers. The lower deck assembly has
been fabricated; the lower deck skirt has been hot
formed and rough mochined; and numerous other
small subassemblies have been completed. Ap-
proximately 30% of the assembly werk is completed,

The work on the sodium-to-NaK heat exchengers
is now progressing at a more satisfactory rate
than previously. All 30 of the offset-bend-ferming
dies hove been completed, The Griscom-Russell
Co. has completed assembling the tubes for the
first unif, and assembly of the tubes to the headers
of the second unit hos been storted. Successful
brozes are now being made, and it is felt that no
further brazing development work will be needed.

Reflector-Moderater Assembly

A lower beryllium hemisphere for the reflector-
moderator assembty hos been fobricoted, and the
spacer ferrules have been installed in the inner

M. Bender

surfoce. An upper beryllium hemisphere is com-
plete, except for contouring the top surface im-
mediately below the two sodium coolant inlet
pipes. This beryllium component is shown in
Fig. 1.5.1 during the machining operations on the
top surfoce. A second setof beryllium hemispheres
for the ART has been received, ond hole-driltling
operations are nearly complete in the lower half,

Work is progressing on o strut-load ring as-
sembly, ond the struts have been welded 1o the
upper ring. The load ring forging has been re-
ceived from the outside fabricator, and machining
operations have sforted on this piece.

The majority of the boron carbide tiles, and
spares, required for two reactors have been re-
ceived, and no difficulty is onticipated in obtaining
the remainder. The fabricatorof the stoinless-steel-
clad boren-copper shielding has hod difficulty in
rofling the material to desired tolerances, and o
relaxation in the toleronce on ratic of cladding to
cermet in the matrix has been authorized. Dit-
ficulty hos been encountered in rolling e product
thot is consistently acceptable metollurgically,
and more development work remains to be done on
this aperation.

The fabrication of Inconel shells, notably the
islond ond outer fuel core shells, continues to be
a major problem. The effort has been concentrated
on the shear spinning process, ond to dote no
completely satisfactory component has been pro-
duvced. The development problem has turned out
to be more difficult then originally estimoted,
Raw material quality requirements have had to be
improved in that the surface finish must be befter
than thot normolly obtained in the stock sizes
used. The physical properties of the material,
particulerly hardness and grain size, must be
carefully controlled throughout the forming process
to prevent cracking. The tool forces on the stock
during final forming of the inner and outer fuel
coce shells produce resuitant forces that tend 1o
pull the shells away from the mondrel. This
occurs because of the reverse curve in these
shells, and several light sizing passes have had
to be employed to acquire satisfactory dimensional
control.

Despite these problems a dimensionally ae-
ceptable outer shell has been produced, but over-

pickling after sne of the heot-treating operotions
has resulted in excessive intergranular attack. |t
is possible thot the surface of the shell moy be
cleaned without going below the tolerance on wall
thickness.

A small parailel progrom has been initiated in an
effort to fabricate the thin core shells by hot
forming oversized parts and then finish machining
them to final thickness. This seems to be o more
positive approach to the problem; however, the
metallurgical risks are theoretically greater since
thicker stock, in which there is greater chance for
flows, must be vsed, and there is none of the cold
working of the row material which is beneficiol to
the metallyrgical structure if properly controlled,

Island and Pressure Shell Liner

One set of beryllium islond parts is complete,
including the insteliation of the spacer ferrules.

66

Ne acceptable Inconel shell parts have been
produced, however, as discussed above.

The lower section of the pressure shell liner is
now to he fabricated by hot pressing and machining
inlieu of combination cold forming, shear spinning,
and machining. It is felt that the present plon is
o safer approach, since there were so meny un-
knowns in the celd forming and shear spinning
aspects of the original plon. Bids for the fabrice-
tion of this component are being evaluated.

No fabrication work has been done 10 date on the
]flé-in.-rhick shells to cover the shielding in the
reactor. It is planned to fobricate the spherical
sections of these poarts by spinning and to fabri-
cote the other sections by cold pressing.

Fuel-to-NaoK Heat Exchangers

The dual effort on fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger
fabrication was evoluated, and Black, Sivells &
Bryson was selected as the fobricator, All jigs,
tools, and fixtures ordered and made by York Corp.
are being transferred to Black, Sivalls & Bryson,

In the course of machining the first channel at
Black, Sivalls & Brysen an error was discovered
in the |IBM doto which wos used to construct the
cam.  Corrections were mode ond the second
channel machined showed the mochining method to
be satisfactory but demonstrated the need for
changes in the method of forming the rough chon-
nel. The third chonnel is now being mochined,
and the second chennel will be incorporated into
rough prototype assembly. The resistonce-heating
method of setting the tubes appears to be satis-
factory, and enough tubes for the prototype have
been formed.,

Assembly Methods Development

Weld shrinkage tests have continued, with a
total of 24 tests being completed for the welds
required for the '/{3-, ]’fi'f and 1-in.-thick reactor
shells. These tests have been performed in order
to determine the magnitude of transverse and
rodial shell shrinkage as a result of the welding
and to develop welding fixtures and procedures
that will enoble reasonably accurate prediction of
shrinkage, distortion, and quality of the reactor
core shell welds.

Test results have indicated that transverse
shrinkage can be predicted to within £0.010 in.
for 'fé-in.-fhick shells. Insufficient tests have
been run with the heavier shell sectiens to esti-
mate shrinkage voriation. Very litile success hos
been obtained in controlling the radial shrinkage.
The concentricity of the parts has been held to
within 0.010 in. totol indicoted reading, but the
amount of radial shrinkage has varied from negligi-
ble values to 0.050 in. in the Y%-in.-thick shells.
Many of the tests have been performed on very
poor quality rejected spun shells which have been
very difficult to weld. The tests on shells that
were closer to the required metallurgical and
dimensional specifications hove given much more
uscble welding data. An inner fuel-annulus core
shell and welding fixture are shown in Fig. 1.5.2,
This fixtute is used in a lathe fo align and support
the shell during the welding operations.

The first test on the l-in.-thick, 54-in.-dia hoops
that simulated the reactor pressure shells showed
the necessity of changing the reactor design to
accommadate the radial shrinkage. These hoops

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31,1957

pulled in almost ]}:’ in. on the radius. The pressure
shelt design was changed from 1- to !'5_-in. thick-
ness at the weld by topering the cross section
above the equator on the inner surface so that
radial shrinkage would not restrict the flow pos-
sage or interfere with the shell liner. Additional
tests must be performed on the thicker shelils, and
preparctions are under way now to perform these
tests,

Tests hove been completed on spot welding
0.100-in.-thick stainless-steel-cled Cu-B,C cermet
shielding material to 0.250-in.~thick lnconel, and
satisfactory results were obtoined. Satisfactory
results have also been obtoined in spot welding
the 0,005-in.-thick stainless steel cons of the
copper-coated B, C tiles to the stoinless steel
cladding of the Cv-B,C cermets.

The reactor assembly procedures are being re-
viewed continually, and revisions are being in-
corporated as design changes and better assembly
techniques are conceived. The reactor assembly
area is complete except for one main section of
floor reinforcement. The security enclosure around
the assembly, inspection, cleaning, and sterage
areos is complete, ond isolefien from the remainder
of the building will be effected when major reocter
assembly operatiens begin.

Mu|-::-r efforts will be expended on these items
since they offect the faocility completion date.
Some of these items are still in the development
aond testing stage, ond therefore delivery dates
connot be quoted. Flowmeters are being coli-
brated in NoK pump component development tests.
The delivery of these flowmeters is contingent

upon the calibration test resuits, which are, in
turn, contingent upon the success of the NaK
pump tests.

The NaK-to-air radiators are being fabricated by
the York Corp., ond several development problems
in brazing techniques must be resolved before a
delivery date can be estoblished. Acceptable
brazed fin sections hove been produced, but a
recent design chunge mokes the fin bank more
flexible, and sagging may occur during the brazing
cycles.,

The lube oil systems are nearly completed, but
the units have not been tested. Delivery dates
for these items are scheduled early encugh to fit
in with other piping work; however, leak testing
and operational testing resvits may indicate un-
foreseen difficulties.

Major difficulties hove been encountered in
testing hydraulic drive units similar to the drives
originally specified for use in the ETU. These
difficulties have made it secessory to hold the
purchase order for ETU wunits in cbeyance until
revised units can be proved. The specifications
are being rewritten.

Detailed design of the NaK systems piping ond
supports is approximately 75% complete, and the
detoiled electrical distribution design is approxi-
mately 75% complete. The design of the auxiliary
service piping external to the test cell is approxi-
mately 25% complete. Preliminary estimotes show
an expected ETU facility completion dote, ex-

A re-evaluation of the ETU progrom has brought
about several chonges in connection with items to
be placed within the test cell thot simulates the
ART cell. The equatorial ond south-heod lead
shielding on the ETU has been eliminated, and
this port of the shield contract with Knapp Mills
was canceled. Design ond fobrication of the
equotorial section of the ART lead shielding was
stopped until a review of the shielding require-
ments can be completed. This review and neces-
sary engineering work is to be completed by
June 1, 1957. The design of the south-head shield
is being continued by the vendor.

Contracts for detoil design and fabrication of
the ART fuel {fill-and-droin tank and reacter sup-
port structures were canceled. The detailed lay-

outs necessary for fabrication are now being made
by the locol design group. Fabrication of both
components is scheduled to be done in the local
shops when the necessary design is complete,

Preliminary design of the ART fill-and-drain
tank lead shield was completed, but the final de-
sign myst await establishment of a firm design for
the tank.

Detail design of the nuclear instrument pod,
which was scheduled os port of the design work
to be done by outside sources, has beenreassigned
to the ORNL Instrument and Controls Deportment.

The ETU fuel fill-and-drain tank supports that
haove been fobricated will hove to be reworked
because design changes hove increcsed the length
of these supports.

The present statys of procurement and fubrica-
tion of other components is given below:

1. The ETU fuel fill-and-drain tank has been
received,

2. Prototype fuel dump volves have been re-
ceived and are being tested and evaluoted.

3. Design of the sodium expansion tonk was
approved, and an order was placed for the neces-
sary Inconel. Fabrication of the tanks for the
ETU and ART will be done by the local shaps.

4, A contract for fabricotica of the ETU and
ART NaK manifolds has been let to the Midwest
Fiping Company, and they are now in the process
of doing development work on bends and nozzle-
to-header welds and of qualifying welders.

5. Design of the hydraulic oil piping inside the
cell has been completed, and purchose orders were
issued for procurement of the materials required
for both the ETU and the ART cells.

6. The sodium system plugging indicator for use
en the ETYU and the two ART auxiliary piping
junction panels were completed.

7. Fabrication of the ART enricher and enricher
line assembly has continued without appreciable
difficulty.

8. Welding procedures and designs for the joints
between the bellows and nipple on the twelve
junction ponel expansion joints have been ap-
proved and the vendor is preceeding with fobrico-

Conceptual designs based on the interlocking

the greatest flexibility in the cut location with the
minimum spread of activity. it is planned currently
that the two main hot-cell tools will be a turntable
mounted on a hydroulic lift, which will support
the recctor, and o Bridgeport type of universal

which will drive the cutting tool.

control

As a consequence of an extensive design review,
supplementory provisions have been mode for the
containment of activity at the facility in the event
of concurrent heat exchanger ond radiator leaks, a
number of design and instrument changes have
been incorporated into the system, ond additional
component development tests have been scheduled
to demenstrote the adequacy of the system for the
prescribed test program. The final specifications
of the test progrom will be based on the results of
detailed onalysis work and the component de-
velopment test program (see Chaps. 1.1 ond 1.4,
“Ajrcraft Reactor Test Design’' and ‘"Component
Development and Testing,'' respectively). In order
to provide for the contsinment of octivity in the
event of concurrent heot exchanger and rodiatoer
leaks, the NaK system pressure will be maintained
above that of the fuel ot all points where o leak
between the two systems could occur. In the
event of a leak or leoks, this pressure will be
maintained until either the activity has decayed 1o
below seriously hazordous levels, or the NaK
lines hove been pinched off with remotely operated

clamps in order to seol the activity in the reactor
away from the radiator leaks.

Further studies of the off-gos system have indi-
cated the advisability of directing the reactor off-
gos through the ZrF,-vapor trap on the reactor
without the option of using the vapor trap on the
fill-and-drcin tank if the reactor trap became re-
stricted.  Thus, the vaopor trop on the fill-ond-
drain tank will never receive vapor from the reac-
tor and should be in good condition when needed
during o dump. Thys, it is expected thafi normel
operation could continve without increased hazard
even though the reactor vapor trap became re-
stricted. Provisions are being made to bypass
both traps. The equalizer line around the reactor
vapor trap will be used during every dump, but the
byposs around the wvapor trap of the fill-ond-drain
tank will be for one-time emergency use only.
Appropriate development tests that will simulate
the different conditions to which the two traps will
be subjected are to be performed. Unfortunately,
it wifl not be possible to include fission gas heat-
ing, 20 w/cma, in these tests. The postpower
fuel-sompling system and the helium supply vent
and bypass provisions to the fuel expansion tank
are to be tested also.

The effect of xenon solubility in the ART fuel
on the ability of the helium purge system toremove
the xenon hos been studied,z and recent meas-
urements have established o value for the solu-
bility of xenon in the proposed reactor fuel (see
Chap. 2.2, ""Chemical Reactiens in Molten Salts''},
Therefore it was possible to predict the amount of
xenon that will remain in the fuel for any given
purge condition.® Measurements will be taken in
the ART of the xenon poisoning, which when com-
pared with the calculated xenon poison effects
should give a measure of the purging efficiency of
the ART xenon removel system.

Procedures were prepared for filling the various
systems with helium by pressurization and venting

and for filling the NaK system with NaK. Although

bEleed lines will have to be installed in the special
NeK systems in order to fill the fill-and-drain tank
tubes and annulus with NaK, recent pump tests
indicate that the trapped gos in the cuxiliary NaK
system may be removed by the pump. [f this is not
so, bleed lines will have to be added to both
auxiliory NaK systems. A drain line will be in-
stalled in each of the two special NaK systems in
order to remove the NaK from the fili-and-drain
tank. There will be some holdup of NaK in all
NaK systems, but they will be flushed with
kerosene and alcohol prior to disassembly.

be analyzed with o 256-chonnel analyzer. For the
second analysis o suitable gas chromatography
method will be used.

As a result of the various design studies, sev-
eral significent changes hove been made in the
ART instrumentation and contrels. The pressure
regulator bypass around the fill-and-drain tank
vent valves has been removed, and a pressure
regulator hos been added to the helium supply to
provide bhetter control and to limit the maximum
pressure available for the filling operation. As
stated aboVe, an equalizer line has been provided
from a peoint downstream of the vaper trap on the
fill-and-drain tank to cuach of the fuel pump helium
inlets o permit o fuel dump ir the preseribed time
even in the event that the reactor vapor trap is
plugged. The equalizer line contains two solenaid
valves in parallel, and check valves are located
both in these bypass lines ond in the helium supply
tines where the two join ¢head of both fuel pumps.
The solenocid volves will be interlocked to open
when the fuel drain valves are opened, ond they
will be manually operable from the contral room at
other times.

A line from the helium supply will be provided
to admit gas into the fill-and-drain tonk to periodi-
cally test the vepor trap for plugs. This line will
have o fixed arifice and will include o solenoid
valve, a pressure transmitter, and a check vclve.
The solencid valves will be operated from the
control room where the pressure will be continu-
cusly recorded.

74

The frangible-disk-operated valve for bypassing
the vapor trap on the fill-and-droin tank will be en-
ergized on an emergency basis in the event of a
plug in this vopor trap, A separate nitrogen supply
has been provided for enecgizing the valve. The
downstream taps of the two fuel expansion tonk
level indicators were moved to improve the reli-
ability of the instruments in the event of a plug of
the recctor vapor trop.

Praovisions were made for venting the gas from
the NaK pumps and dump tanks through @ common
vent header to the cell off-gas line. Two vacuum
pumps in parallel with a bypass line and an isola-
tion volve were provided in the cell off-gas line
upstream of the charcoal bed and sample station.
With these provisions it will be possible to main-
tain the cell at o pressure of 5 psia se that in the
event of concurrent radictor ond heat exchanger
leaks, the cell may act as o sink for activity by
venting the reactor fuel system to the cell. A vent
connection was provided from the reactor off-gas
line to the cell atmosphere that consists of a
frangible-disk volve e¢nd o solencid valve in a tee
in the off-gos line downstream from the pressure
control valve which maintains the resctor expan-
sion tank pressure.

In-Pile Loops

A shift of emphasis in ART supporting research
has resulted in the cancellation of further in-pile
loop tests of zirconium-fluoride-base fuels in
lnconel systems. The informotion thus far ob-
tained from the in-pile loop program has wverified
the results obtoined through irradiation of capsules
ond through out-of-pite corrosion tests. The
irradiation tests indicate that no substantiol
change in fuel properties or corrosion rate is to
be expected because of radiation. Further in-pile
loop tests will be initiated when suitable nickel-
molybdenum alloys and lithium-base fuels are
available.

In-pile Yoop No. 6, the operation of which was
described previously,? was cut up at NRTS ond
returned to the ORNL hot-cell facilities where it
is owaiting disassembly and metollogrophic ex-
amination.

Prototype In-Pile Pump

Futere in-pile loop work will require o pump
capable of operoting for longer times and at higher
temperatures than those used thus for., Therefore
a development program hos been initiated to ex-
tend the established operating range of the in-pile
pump.® To provide a margin of safety for future
loop operotion, the pump should be capable of
operating ot 1500°F at about 150% of the present
salt flow requirement and for 2000 hr. The shofts
of eoch of the first two test pumps seized after
approximately 1000 hr of operation as a result of
zirconiuvm fluoride accumulation around the shaft
slinger. A third test, previously described,® was
set up for which a zirconium fluoride vapor trap of
cluming was used ond the circulated fuel mixture
was NaF-ZrF -UF, (56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70).
This pump satisfactorily met the required c¢ondi-
tions by completing the 2000-hr test ot 1500°F and

on the pump housing surrounding the slinger but
not enough to contact the shaft. The alumina in
the vapor trap, which had cperated for its design
life, appeared to be fused and the trap was almost
plugged; no difficulty had been ex-
perienced with the purge flow through the trop.

The results of the test justify the use of this

in the range of 1600 to 1650°F, which correspond

In-Pile Loop Heat Exchanger Tests
C. C. Bolta

Future in-pile loops are expected to be operated
ot higher power densities for which the capacity,
30 kw, of the present in-pile lcop heat exchanger
is insufficient. A program wos therefore initiated
to develop o heat exchonger with a capocity of
45 kw or more. A test unit similor to o forced-
convection loop with a resistonce-heated section
and a 5-gpm centrifugal pump was set up to ac-
commodate varioys heat exchangers. The first
series of tests were run on the standard in-pile
loop heot exchonger to obtein dote for comparison
and io verify loop power generation data. Curves
of heat removal vs air flow were obtained, ond
the results verified that with inlet oir ot a pres-
sure of 90 psic o maximum of about 30 kw of heat
can be removed.

In order to increase the capacity of the heat ex-
changer, o water injection system was devised and

tested. This consisted of @ small, high-pressure
pump for injecting 0.12 gpm of water into the inlet
air stream through a small shower-head nozzle.
Preliminary calculations indicated that about 15kw
of heat should be absorbed by the heat of vaporiza-
tion of the water alone. The test results showed

In-Pile Test of Moderator Material
C. C. Bolta

The first in-pile test of moderator materials for
use at high temperatures was completed. In this
test four samples of beryllium oxide were irradiated
in the HB-3 beam hole during two MTR cycles with
gamma heat estimated ot between 2 and 5 w/g and
o fast neutron flux of about 1073 neutrons/cm?.sec.
The high-temperature end of the capsule was
normeily ot cbout 1500°F. The capsule was
thermally cycled 32 times as a result of reactor
power fluctuations, with temperature differentials
ranging from 200 to 1400°F. The results of ex-
amination of the irradiated specimens are pre-
sented in Chap. 4.1, “‘Radiation Damage."

A second test assembly hos been prepared for

low Reynolds moduli, the effects of natural con-
vection ossume grecter importonce in the totol
heat transfer. In order to evaluate the natural-
convection contribution, the system was operated
with flow in both directions through the heat
exchanger. If the natural-convection mechanism
s involved, the heat transfer for flow in the
reverse direction (downward through the exchanger)
should be less than that for flow in the normal
direction. The date presented in Fig. 1.7.1 show
no effect of natural convection over the Reynelds

modulus range examined. From considerations of

the geometry ond orientation of the heat exchanger,
this result was to be expected.

that the screens would be essentially ot the fluid

HEAT TRANSFER IN REFLECTOR-MODERATED
REACTOR CORES
N. D. Greene W. R, Gombill

ART Core Heat Transfer

The hydrodynomic experiments in which screens
were used in the 10/44-scole plostic core model
indicoted the need for further volume-heot-source
studies of a similar geometry. A heat-generation
analysis hes shown thot @ number of fine-mesh
plastic screens can be placed in the northern
hemisphere of the core without drastic disturbance
of the flux field. In the pores of the screens (the
region in which the flux density is highest) the
heat generated will be 2]’2 times that in the free
fluid. The effect of these regions of high tem-
percture on the over-cll temperature field is made
negligible by two factors: (1) the volume of fluid
affected is only a very small percentage of the
totel fiuid volume, ond (2) the stringers of high-
temperature fluid issuing from the screen pores
are rapidly dissipoted in the highly turbulent
wokes behind the screen wires. Such local in-
creases in heat generotion would be limited to
resistance-heated systems, and thus similar screens
in the ART core would not be subjected to the
higher temperatures. Wall-temperature meas-
urements will be made in the regions between the
screens, as well as in the undisturbed scuthern
hemisphere of the core. Fluid temperatures will
be obtained with the odjusteble thermocouple
probes located ot the core outlet. These probes
will be used both to survey the fluid radially in
a fixed oxial plane and to investigate temperature-
time correlations befween the four thermocouple
probes. These latter studies will be made for
beth the swirl entrance system with the core
screens and for the swirl entrance alone. |t is
hoped that the results of these experiments will
shed odditional light on the origins of the tem-
perature fluctuations which hove been observed
in the ART type of core geometry.

Vortex Tube Heat Transfer

A volume-heot-source experiment was designed
that utilizes the vortex flow principle.® For these
measurements @ uniform volume heat source will
be generated electrically within a sulfuric acid
solution flowing through on insulated cylindrical
pipe. The desired fluid velocity profile will ke
created by vanes in the entrance section of the
tube. Both steady-stote and iransient temperature
measurements will be obtained by using surfoce,
as well os fluid, thermocouples. The fluid ther-
mocouples will be located at the tube exit and
will provide a radial traverse of the tube.

A similar experiment will involve the measurement
of heat transfer coefficients in o heated-tube
system contoining a fiquid vortex. It is estimated
that the heat transfer in this system will be
greater than that for cenventional flow of flyid
throygh a tube. In such a system it may be
possible to maintain satisfactorily Sow tube-woll
temperatures without secondary cooling.  The
effect of centrifugol forces on the temperatyre
structure will also be investigated. Hydrodynamic
studies of the stobility of the fluid vortex ond
other phenomena at the interface between the
vortex and the main fluid flow are currently in
progress.

THERMAL-CYCLING EXPERIMENTS
H. W. Hoffman D. P. Gregory®

Studies with the system for thermally eycling
Incenel tubing were continued in order to determine
the effects of fluctuating temperatures and stresses
on Inconel exposed to flowing i"'hﬂF-ZrF“--UFJ1
(50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30). The results obfained
to date are summorized in Tobles 1.7.1, 1.7.2,
and 1.7.3. Figures 1.7.7 through 1.7.14 show the
maximum penetration observed in the test sections
used for the experiments described in Tables
1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.7.3.

In order to investigate the pessible effect on
the depth of attack in Inconel of the interaction
between the heoter section ond the test section
and of the heater length, an experiment was per-
formed (ET-S) in which the entire 12-in. test unit
served as a heoter. The heater wos subjected to

temperature cycling under the some wall-temper-
ature-difference conditions as existed in the test
sections used in runs ET-H ond ET-0. The test
unit for run ET-H was divided into a 4-in. heoter
and on B8-in. test section, while the test unit for
run ET-0 weos on 8-in. heater and ¢ 4-in. test
section. Frem the dota in Tcble 1.7.1, it may be
seen that the general subsurfoce-void formation
was approximately the same in oll three test
sections. However, the ET-H test section showed
deeper intergranular stringers than the ET-0 test
section. The specimen taken from the test unit
for run ET-S showed a tendency toward inter-
granular attack in the regions of deepest pen-
etrotion, The exposure times for runs ET-H and
ET-O were approximotely the same, while run
ET-S lested 16 hr less thon ET-H. Although it
is difficult to draw specific conclusions on the
basis of these three runs alone, it appears thot
the heoter-test section interaction and the heater
length may not have significant effects on attack
in this thermal-cycling system.  This result
possibly could have been predicted on the basis
of the surface area-to-velume ratios in the system.

The resulss of run ET-5 probebly connot be
caompared directly with those from runs ET-H and
ET-0 from the stress stondpoint. The temperature
difference across the velume-heated metal wall
of the ET-S test section was less thon that of
the test sections used for runs ET-H ond ET-0O.
Since the thermally induced stress is a function
of the temperoture grodient in the wall, it is to
be expected thot the stresses in run ET-5 were
lower than those in runs ET-H ond ET-0. There-
fore, run ET-T was made under temperature ond
geometry conditions identical to those of run ET-S
with, however, continuous thermal cycling. Since
run ET-T lasted for 97 hr, while run ET-S lasted
for only 50 hr, the test unit vsed for run ET-T
was ot the system maximum temperature opproxi-
motely four times as long s was the test unit
used for run ET-5. A comparison of Figs. 1.7.12
and 1.7.13 shows thot somewhot deeper attack
occurred in run ET-T than in run ET-S. Further,
while the aumber of voids in the specimen from
run ET-T is less than in the specimen from run
ET-S, the ET-T voids are much larger. Additionat
dato must be obtained before hypotheses can be
based on these results.

The series of runs ET-O, ET-P, and ET-Q was
designed to obtain a comparison of the effects of

low-frequency, high-frequency, and isothermal

Enthalpy and Heat Cupacity

The enthalpy and heot copacity for the mixture
NaoF-Z:F -UF (50-25-25 mole %) were redeter-
mined with the use of the copper-block calorimeter.
In the previous measurements made with the use
of Bunsen ice calorimeters, the heat capacity of
this mixture wos found to be 10.90 cal/g-atom,
which wos considerobly higher than the averoge of
8.11 cal/g-atom found for all the other zirconium
fluoride ~containing salts studied.® It wos felt
that this difference resulted in part from the high
melting temperature of the salt mixiure ond the
subsquent small iemperature range over which
the liquid was tested. The more precise measure-
ment capable in the copper-block colorimeter
resulted in a new value of 9.16 col/g-atom for the
NaF-ZrF -UF {50-25-25 mole %) mixture. The
results ore listed below:

Thermal Conductivity

The wvariable-gap device for the measurement of

the effects of varying the heating rate. Erratic
results were obtained from measurements with two
samples of the mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (56-39-5

first modification of the system involved provisions
for the measurement of the heat flow above ond
below the sample, and the modified system is
currently being tested with liquids of known thermal
conductivity., The design of o second device that
incorporates o mejor modificotion of the varichle-

Provisions were also mode for many times the
present number of thermocouples. With the many
more heating circvits ond thermocouples, it should
be possible to ensure that one-dimensional heat
flow will exist in the salt somple regardless of
the rate of heat input.

Electrical Conductivity

An Inconel conductivity cell for use in determining
the specific efectrical conductivity of liquid sodium
and sodium-potassium alloy was designed and
fabricated. The purpose of this investigation is
to obtain reliable, absolute values of the con-
ductivities of these metals in the temperature
ronge of 200 to 1400PF for use in calibrating the
ART electromagnetic fHlowmeters. The measure-

MODIFICATICN OF APPARATUS FOR
THERMAL ANALYSIS

H, A, Friedman

Thermal analysis has been the most important
exploratory technique used in phase-equilibrium
studies at ORNL., For such analyses relatively
large charges of melt {50 to 200 g) are maintained
under a flowing cotmosphere of helium and ore
stired to assure homogeneity and to minimize
temperature gradients in the liquid. Since several
thermal excursions through the solidus ond liquidus
are used in each experiment, mixtures containing
high <concentrations of a volatile constituent
chonge appreciobly in composition during the ex-
periment.

In order to minimize the losses by vaporization,
a simple modificofion was mode to the apparatus.
The thermal anolysis crucible is fitted with a disk
of grophite that is drilled to gccommodate the
stirrer shaft omd the thermocouple well. The
diameter of the graphite disk is 0.1 in, less then
the inside diameter of the crucible. When the
charge of salt is melted, the graphite disk floats
on the molten mixture, whose free surface is thus
reduced nearly to zero. By using this technique
it has been possible to subject samples contaoining
80 mole % ZrF , to thermal analysis with negligible
loss in weight of the sample.

YISUAL OBSERYATION AND DIFFERENTIAL
THERMAL AMALYSIS OF SMALL
QUANTITIES OF FUSED SALTS

R. J. Sheil

The Leitz vacuum hot-stage microscope, which
it was hoped could be vsed for visuval observation
of small gquantities of fused salts in an inert
atmosphere ot high temperatures, was found to be
unsatisfactory for this purpose. The design of
the equipment permitted lorge thermal gradients

and made measurements of melt temperotures ex-
tremely unrelioble, Since equipment that permits
thermal dato to be obtained with less than 1 g
quantities of fused salts would be highly desirable
for work with radicactive or toxic materials, the
experience obtained with the commercial equipment
was utilized in designing a new vacuum fumace
that is adaptable to microscopic observation. This
appdratus centains two concentric tubes of Alundum
or other syitable insulating material. The inner
tube is wound with a spiral of platinum-rhodium
wire to provide resistance heating. A cylindricol
nickel block 1 in. in diometer and 1 in, in
thickness haos ¢ ]x_i-in.-dia tube drilled in it to
provide ¢ sample compartment which can be lined
with thin metal foil to facilitote removal of fused-
salt samples. The furnace is enclesed in «
vacuum-fight container equipped with a glass
window through which the samples con be observed
by means of o low-power microscope. Melt temper-
atvres are measured with a thermocouple junction
immersed directly in the meft,

This apparotus wos tested initially for visual
observation of liquidus and solidus temperatures
by using approximately 0,15 g of the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic as the test material. When the sample
was heated at a rate of obout 17°C/min, volues
ranging from 444 to 457°C were obtoined for the
first appearance of liquid and from 464 te 475°C
for complete melting. More consistent results were
obtained upon cooling at approximotely the same
rate. Values ronging from 435 to 460°C for the
first appearance of ¢rystals and from 451 to 460°C
for the solidus temperature were observed. A
value of 459.5 £ 1.5°C for the freezing point of
this mixture was obtaired by a different method
by another ORNL investigator.? The use of sfower
heating and cooling rates would uadoubtedly
improve the reproducibility of the data, but these
preliminary visual observations indicated that
reasonably accurate melt temperatures <¢an be
meosured with oaly 150 mg of material.

Liquidus determinations by visuval observation

ore strongly colored, and therefore it seemed
desiroble 1o adopt this apparctus to the use of
the differential thermal anglysis technique. Only
simple modifications to the apparatus were re.
guired. Two holes were drilled in the nickel
block, symmetrically arranged, and two opposed
thermocouple junctions, one for the sample and
the other for the reference moterial (alumina),
were iniroduced. The instrumentation is the same
as that previously used for similar determinations.
A Leeds & Northrup d-¢ amplifier is used to
amplify the difference in emf between the opposed
junciions before it is fed into an X-Y recorder.
The temperature of the sample is recorded on the
Y.axis of the recorder. Sharp breaks in the differ-
ential troce were obtained with the NaF-KF-LiF
eufectic in both the heoting ond the cooling cycles.
The heating breaks in three experiments varied
from 457 to 459°C, and the cooling breaks occurred
at 461 and 459°C,

The principal difficulty observed with this oppo-
ratus has been foilure to keep NaF-ZrF, mixtures
in the somple compartment regardless of the
composition of the liner material. Similar behavior
was observed with an N::II:-LH:4 mixture, in which
case the liquid was seen to be leaving the com-
partment by way of the thermocouple wires. It is
expected thot wider spacing of the thermocouple
wires and the use of taller containers will help
to minimize and possibly eliminate the creep
probfem.

THE SYSTEM LiF-UF4
H, A. Friedman R. E. Moore

Recent quenching work with mixtures in the
LiF-UF, systems that contain 20 10 32 mole % UF
has confirmed the liquidus and solidus relation-
ships previously reported.? It was found, however,
that the compound 4LiF.UF, undergoes very slow
subsolidus decomposition to LiF and 7LiF.6UF,
at about 470°C., A series of samples of o mixture
containing 28 mole % UF,, which originally con-
tained no free LiF, was heated overnight and
quenched from temperatures both above and below
470°C. Just below 470°C, LiF and ?LiF--ﬁUFd
were found, but, at still lower temperatures,
4LiF.UF, was found in addition to the other two

phases. Complete decomposition was apparently
not achieved at the lower temperatures.

Thermal analysis studies showed that liquids
containing 20 to 32 mole % UF, undercool readily
if the melt is first heated to over 800°C. Two
undercooling halts occur in the cooling curves ot
cbout 460 to 480°C, and the resulting mixtures
contain 4Lif.UF,, LiF, and 7LiF.6UF,. If the
liquid is first heoted eonly to 600°C, the under-
cooling effect is absent, and a eutectic type of
halt is obtained at ohout 490°C. The soclidified
mixtures from this type of experiment contain only
LiF ond 7LiF-6UF,, which are the phases to be
expected if 4LiF.UF, decomposes during the
cooling; in this event the cooling curve should
indicate o thermal effect at 470°C, as well as
the eutectic halt at obout 490°C. Becouse of
the absence of the 470°C effect and the sluggish
nature of the decomposition of 4Lif.UF,, it did
not seem 1o be likely that the absence of 4LiF.UF,
could be explained by its decomposition., These
mixtures therefore had apparently cooled to o
metastable eutectic between LiF and 7LiF.SUF ,
which must freeze only o few degrees below the
freezing point ot 490°C of the stable eutectic
between 4LiF.UF  and 7L; F.6UF,.

In view of the existence of the peculiar thermal
effects in the range 20 to 372 mcle % UFA, a
seeding experiment on a mixture containing 24
mole % UF, was conducted to be sure that the
quenching results previously obtained truly charac-
terize equilibrium conditions. The mixture was
heated to over 800°C and seeded upon cooling
with small omounts of a mixture of the same
composition that contained oll the phases found
in that region [LiF, ﬂLiF-UF4, ?LiF-éUF4, and
VSLIF-UF," (ret 4)]. The seed material was
odded at intervals of about 10°C ofter the mixture
had cooled to about 560°C. The cooling curve
hod halts ot 485 and 480°C, with nc evidence of
undercooling.  Petrographic examination of the
mixture after it hod cooled to room temperature
showed that it consisted of 4LiF.UF,, 7LiF.6UF,,
and a small amount of LiF. These results are in
accordance with the results of gquenching studies,
except that the temperatures of the thermal effects
are about 10°C lower.

The Hf** cation radius {0.86 3\) is so nearly

THE SYSTEM LiFwCEFj
K. J, Sheil L.. M, Bratcher

The high-temperature furnace previcusly used in
the study of the RbF-CaF, system® woas used for
visual observations of liquidus temperatures of
mixtures in the LiF-CeF, system. A eutectic
containing 19 mole % CeF, and melting ot
755 + 5°C was previously reported® to exist in
this system. The eoarlier efforts to complete the
diogram were unsuccessful becouse no reliable
liquidus values could be obtained with mixtures
containing more than 19 mole % CeFa,

It appears that the thermel anslysis apparatus
in use at that time was not sufficiently sensitive
to detect the small heat effect associaoted with
the separation of CeF, frem the melt, Thig
difficulty was probably associated with heat con-
duction by the thermocauple well used to protect
the thermocouples, With ¢ Pt—Pt + 10% Rh thermo-
couple immersed directly in the melt, it was
possible to detect thermally the crystallization
of CeF, at the some time the crystals were
observed visually to be forming in the melt. The
diagram shown in Fig. 2.1.1 is o composite of
the thermal analysis data obtcined earlier {solid
circles}) and the recent data {cpen circles). The
melting point of CeF, used in Fig. 2.1.1 (1460°C)
is the literature value.” Examination of several
slowly cooled melts showed only LiF and Cef,
to be present, and this confirmed the thermal
indications of the absence of complex compounds
in this system.

H. A, Friedman B. S. Landav

A lorge number of thermal-gradient quenching
experimenis completed during the quorter have
shown the tentative phase-equilibriuvm diagram
previcusly reported!® for the system NaF-LiF-UF,
to be in error in several respects, A revised
diagram is presented os Fig. 2.1.3. The un-
identified moterial reported previously to be a
ternary compound was found'! to be the compound
NaF.-2UF,, which has been shown to have o
primary phase field in the ternary system. This
compound thus became an apex of the compatibility
triangle NuF-?UF4-?LiF-éUF‘{-muF-{SUFd.

The <compound 3NoF.UF, is unstable below
497°C, ond it is accordingly impossible for the
primary phose field of LiF to contact that of
3NaF-UF,. The latter compound is not therefore
an opex of a compatibility triangle. The compound
4LiF-UF4 is unstable below 470°C, and the

primary phase field of this material does not
contact that of o sodium compound. Therefore
4LiF-UF, is not an apex of a compatibility
triangle.

The compound 5NaF.3UF, was shown to exist
ot the liquidus in the ferary system, and the
extent of its primary phase field was established.
Boundary paths separating the phase fields of
LiF-4UF, ond NaF.2UF,, LiF.-4UF, and 7LiF.UF,,
and 7NaF.6UF, and 7LiF.6UF, were also es-
tablished. The boundary paths between the
7NaF.6UF, ond 7LiF.6UF, phase fields were
difficult to establish because of the extensive
solid solution which occurs between these two
compounds.

H. A. Friedman 8. 5. Landau

Phase equilibrium studies of the systems NaF-
CrF,-ZiF, NaF-FeF,-ZrF,, ond NaF-NiFE-ZrF4
were made during the quarter in order to determine
the formulo and phase relationships of the ternary
compound in each of these systems. Only one
ternary compound was observed in each system,
The phases identified in several slowly cooled
melts [50-g quantities) indicote, as shown in
Table 2.1.3, that the NOF-GFE-ZrF4 ternary
compound probably has one of the formulas
NaF.CrF,-ZrF,, 3NoF.3CtF,-dZrF,, NoF.CrF,.
2ZrF,, or NaF.CrF,.3ZtF,. The compound is
isomorphous with its analeg in each of the three
systems, ond therefore it is likely to have the
some stoichiometric formula in the three cases.

Thermal analysis ond thermal-gradient quenching
experiments were made along the join NeF-CiF,-
ZrF,, which includes all the possible ternary
compound formulas mentioned above., Egquilibrium
conditions were not opproached closely enough for
a determination of the formulo by the use of phase-
equilibrivm experimentel techniques. The compo-
sition that produced the most nearly single-phase
material was NuF-CrFI-EZer. Single crystals
of the NGF-FEFE-Zer ternary compound were
obtained from a portion of a slowly cocled melt
containing 33]6 mole % of each component of the
mixture. Chemical analysis of the sample showed
that the composition of the compound is NaF-FeF,-
QZer. The isomorphism displayed by the analegs
of this compound ia the NaF-CrF,-ZrF, ond

SOLUBILITY OF NIF2 IN NoF-ZrF4
C. M. Bloed

Considerable attention has been given to
determining the solubility of Nif, in NaF-Z:F,
{53-47 mole %). |t was shown |:.~r45t".-'i~'.:pusI';.r2 that
the solubility of NiF, in this solvent wos o
function of the total amount of NiF, odded in the
range 0.5 to 10 wt %, but no determinations were
made with only traces of the soturating (nickel-
containing) phase present. The results obtained
electrochemically? were of considerable interest
in this regard, but unfortunately these results

2-4

appear to be high by cpproximately o factor of 2.
Consequently, on accurate determination of the
solubility ot 550°C was undertaken with only
troces of the saturating phusa present,

In order to approach the saturation concentration
gradually, o mixture of HF, hydrogen, and helivm
was bubbled through NaF-ZrF , contained in aickel
apparatus at 550°C. The apparatus was the same
as that used for equilibrium studies (see preceding
section on "'Equilibrium Reduction of NiF, by
H2 in NaF-ZrF, "), The HF-H, ratio of the
gaseous mixture was set at appropriate values so
that nickel metal from the cantainer was converted
slowly to NiF,. The changes in NiF, concen-
tration of the molten NaF-ZcF, were followed by
chemically analyzing liquid somples drown through
filtering tubes. The filtrates were token in pairs —
one at 550°C ond another from the apporatus
tempororily heated to 700°C. For the unsaturated
solution the concentrations of NiF, were identical,
within the analyticol precision, in both filtrates.
As the solution became saturated, the 550°C
filtrate indicated the solubility of Nif,, ond the
700°C filtrate gave a measure of the total amount
of NiF, in contact with the liquid. The results
of these meosurements are presented in Fig. 2.2.2.

The data obtained for o saturated solution gave
o solubility of 352 £ 11 ppm Ni as NiF, in moiten
NcF—Zer (53-47 male %) at 5350°C. The data olso
indicate thot the solubility remains constant when
the amount of soturating phose is chonged from o
trace to a total of 1210 ppin Ni*T. The volue of

The stability of CrF, and CrF3 in two THF"-

of the equilibration-filtration technique described
in previous reports in this series.® (This work,
while of interest to the ANP project, is more
directly applicable to the Fused-Salt Power Re-
actor Project.) These experiments were performed
by charging pure LiF-ThF, (72-28 mole %) or
LiF-BeF,-ThF , (67-23-10 mole %) along with pure
CrF, or CrF 4 to hydrogen-tired nickel apparatus,
equilibrating for 5 hr at 800°C under helium,
filtering ot the equilibrium temperoture, and anp-
alyzing the cooled filtrate for Cr'' and total

The dota obtained, os given in Table 2.2.2,
indicate that Cer is stable in both these solvents.
The dispreportionation regoction

3CrF, == 2CF, + Cr°

seems to occur to a very limited extent, if at all.
It appears, however, that CiF, reacts with the
nickel contoiner, when added 1o either solvent,
presumably by the reaction

2CF, + Ni° == Nif, + 20/F,

The reaction is manifestly incomplete under the
conditions used. [t is likely that the heating
period was teoo short and that the surfoce areo
of the nickel container wos too small for the
heterogeneous equilibrium to be attained.

that the equilibrium concentration of Fe'' is
significantly higher at 600 than at BO0°C. The
concentrations obtained in this reaction medium
fell in the range thot has been found in the other
alkali fluoride—ZrF, binory mixtures. No sotis-
factory explenation can be given for the fact thot
the Fe®-UF, system is not morkedly offected when
different alkali fluoride=ZrF, mixtures are used
os the reoction medium. In contrast the studies
of the Cr°-UF , reaction showed thot the chromium
concentration increases in the order of use of
RbF, KF, NaF, eor LiF, in the reaction medium,
which is the order of decreasing ion size.

Data for the reaction of UF, with Cr® at 600
and 800°C when RbF-ZrF4 (52-48 mole %) is used
as the recction medivm are given in Table 2.2.4.
Approximately 2 g of Cr® wos reacted with UF,
(8.9 wt % UF,, 4.0 mole % UF,) dissolved in
approximately 40 g of the RbF-ZrF, mixture ina
nickel container.

The chromiom values given in Table 2.2.4 show
that the UF -Cr® reaction has a very small tem-
perature coefficient over the temperature rtonge
studied. These equilibrium chromium concentrations
are slightly higher than those found® in RbF-ZrF
(60-40 mole %) ot both temperatures. The small
differences indicate that the fluoride ion activity,
as measured by the Cr®-UF  reaction, increases
only slightly when the RbF concentration is in-
creased from 50 to 58 mole %, the RbBF con-

Data for the reaction of UF , with Cr® a1 650 and
800°C in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-23-10 mole %) are
given in Toble 2.2.5. Approximately 2 g of Cr°

wt % U) dissclved in approximately 40 g of the
LiF-BeF ,-ThF , mixture confained innickel. Similor
dato obtained with LiF-ThF4 (72-28 mole %) os
the reaction medivm and ¢ UF, concentration of
0.21 mole % {0.5 wt % U) are presented in Table
2.2.6.

The equilibrium chromium values presented in
Tables 2.2.5 end 2.2.6 approximate the blank ob-
tained for chromium. Therefore, the reduction of
UF, by Ct® in these reaction media when low UF,
concentrations are used is negligible, as wos
the cose when LiF-BeF, (48-52 mole %} wos
used as the reaction medium.” While the method
is not sufficiently sensitive to determine slight
chonges in chromium concentrations thot occurred
in this series of experiments, the data do indicate
that no extensive attack of Cr® by UF, occurs
vader these conditions.

SOLUBILITY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG
RARE-EARTH FLUORIDES IN
MOLTEN NaF-ZrF,-UF

R. A. Strehlow W. T. Ward
Solubility of Individual Rare Eorths

As shown in the preceding sections, the solubility
of LGFS, CeF3, and Sn'-.F3 in the molten solvent
NaF-Z¢F ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) has been carefully
examined os a function of temperature. The dato
reveal considerable differences in selubility for
materials whose chemicol properties are so similar.
The c¢ompound SmF, is, as indicated in Table
2.2.14, nearly 25% more soluble than LaF, ot
each temperature stydied, and the solubility of
CeF, is intermediate in each case.

The product of the solubility of sach compound
multiplied by the third power of the cotion rodius
is the some within 2% for each of the three
rare-garth tluorides studied (Table 2.2.14). Mo
explanation for the success of this correlation
has been offered, and it is possible that the
agreement is fortuitous. Subsequent studies of
solubility of these materials as a function of
NaF-ZrF, composition need to be completed before
a discussion s fo the generol validity of this
correlation can be made. In any event it is evident
that the solubility of the rare-earth fluorides is
sufficiently high to permit quite long-time operation
of o reactor before precipitation of these materials
becomes ¢ problem.

Solubility of Binary Rare-Earth Mixtures

solubility of CeF, ond LaF, in combination is
intermediate between that of pure L{:F3 and that
of pure Cef,. The binary solubility data are
plotted in Fig. 2.2.5, along with the solubility
data for pure 'i:ne,-F3 and pure LcFa, as a three-
component sytsem, with the pure solvent (NaF-
ZrF,-UF,, 50-46-4 mole %) as one component.
The liquidus lines established by the four ex-
perimentel points are nearly straight.

In a preceding repor?q equilibrium quotients were
defined for the partition of the rare earths between
the liquid and their solid solution:

where N is the concentration (in moie fraction)
of the designated material in the designated phase.
It was also established® that if Henry’s law were

cbeyed by both the liquid ond the solid solution,

K should be the ratio of the solubilities of the
pure component trifluorides. The foct that the
experimental points for the mixtures of Lc:F3 and
CeF, foll on the straight lines connecting the
original composition and the pure solvent, as
shown in Fig. 2.2.5, is equivelent to the statement
that K, as defined above, is unity rather than the
rofic of solubilities (obout 1.1). The ohserved

cate some deviotion from Henry's law in the liquid
or in the solid solution or in both,

The preliminary studies mode to date for the
CrF,-SmF,-solvent system have yielded the X
values shown in Table 2.2.16. These values,
which were obtained with the use of a single-tracer
technique and with the assumption that the liquidus
lines are similar to those of the LaF;-CrF,-

SOLUBILITY OF XENON GAS IN NaoF-ZrF ,-UF
N. V. Smith

The determination of the solubility of xenon
gas in molten NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as
a function of pressure and temperoture was suc-
cessfully completed. As o conseguence of the
high cost of xenon, a recovery system for the xenon
used in the determination was added to the apparotus
previously described? for the determination of the
solubility of heliuvm in NaF-ZrF, -UF . In this gas-
dispensing and recovery system three xenon cylin-
ders were connected through their conventional
pressure-regulating valves to a manifold which served
to introduce the gos at the desired pressure into
the solubility equipment. Between each cylinder and

its pressure regqulator an odditional connection,
which could be closed with o needle valve, was
made to a second manifold which received the
xenon gos emerging from the sclubility apparatus.
With the use of a liquid-nitrogen cooling bath the
xenon could be recovered in one of the cylinders
while the experiment was fed from a second
cylinder.  The third cylinder wos maintained as
a standby in cose the source cylinder become
depleted during an experimeni. This assembly is
shown as Figs. 2.2.6 and 2.2.7.

The xenon was obtained in c¢ylinders from Linde
Air Products Co. Mass spectrometic analysis
showed its purity to be better than 99.99%, as
received. The high purity grodually decrecsed to
§5.9% after eight complete experiments.

The limited supply of xenon ovailable necessitated
@ constant wotch during the experiment in order
to aveid exhausting the soyrce cylinder below
o sofe preset pressure. Accordingly, the soturating
time wos lowered to approximaotely 5 hr. The
results appeared to correlate satisfuctorily re-
gardless of whether the time was 4 or 5 hr. In a
single experiment in which the saturotion was
attempted in 1 hr, the amouat of xenon found in
solution was only about one-half as much as that
obtained with 4- or 5-br saturation times. From
the previous experience with helium, it appeared
that 3 hr of saturation time was sufficient.

The results shown in Table 2.2.17 and Fig.
2.2.8 appear to be consistent to within approxi-
mately +10%.  All the experimental wariables
appear to have been controlled to within con-
siderably closer vuriations than £ 10%. The mass
spectrometer ancalyses agree, on an acverage, with
the synthetic compositions of the stondard gas
mixtures to within approximately 10%.  As o
consequence, it does not appeor unregsonoble to
assume thot the resulfs presented are correct to
within t20%, if it is assumed that the saturating
time used was sufficiently long.  Appropriate
experiments are under way fo demonstrate quan-
titatively the time required for saturction.

It may be seen that, as in the case of helium,
the solubility of xenon in NeF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-
4 mole %) increases with increasing temperature.
This effect is discussed in more detail in the
following section,

SOLUBILITY OF HF IN NnF-ZrF‘

Knowledge of the solubility of HF in molten

of methods of solt purification, some aspects of cor-
rosion problems, ond processes for disselution of
solid fuel elements for uranium recovery, No record
of direct measurement of the solubility of HF in

of studies of salt purification, attempts'® have
been made ot times during the past severol veors
to estimate the sclubility of HF in molten salis

carriers. The results obtained have not, however,
been conclusive.

In recent months it has been possible to measure,
by a direct equilibration method, the sclubility of

The effects of composition on activities in the

Some of the stability of pure AgCl can be atiributed
to the partially covalent nature of the bonds be-

polorizability of these ions. The effect of neigh-

ELECTROMIGRATION IN MOLTEM SALTS AS A

M. B. Panish

Electromigration in molten salts has been

shown to be a successful means for separating
is.cmc:;:utaesa,M and therefore it is of interest to de-

termine the usefulness of this technique for the

presumably eosier problem of seporating ions
of different elements in fuel mixtures. Electro-
migration accomplishes separation by taking

advantage of the differences in mobility of the
ions. The electrochemical cell used is contrived
so that the electrolytic product at one electrode
is consumed ot the other, and ne net chemical
transformation is accomplished. After operation

can be occomplished if remixing s prevented.
Remixing can be suppressed by the use of a smoll
cross-section cell and packing and by the avoidance
of temperature grodients which would result in
convection ¢urrents.

allow the use of & quartz-glass container ond

both becouse it is of practical interest and because
it has high mobility. The Ni*" ion was chosen
becouse its blue color served as @ good indicator
and allowed the movement of the ion tc be fellowed
visuolly, even for Ni** concentrations as low as
0.001 mole fraction. A diagram of the cell is
shown in Fig. 2.2.15. Substitution of HCI| for
Cl, os the gas supply to the electrodes eliminated
much of tne difficuity from bubble formation in

a smaller temperature coefficient of solubility

peratures in the pocking because of the higher
resistance.

The experimental results obtained at 650 te
750PC  showed that the boundary between the
colorless solution and the solution colored blue
by the Ni*" ions moved toward the anode, and
thus the Li* ions moved faster than the Ni'’
ions. If Li" ions had corried all the current, the
boundary would have moved at a calculated rafe
of 22 mm/hr under the conditions of the experiment.
The measured rate was 20 2 mm/hr, If the experi-
mentally observed value of 20 mm/hr is assumed to
be correct, and if the chleride lattice is considered
to be stationary, the Li* ions moved about 20
times as fast as the Ni'* jons. As a result of
the uncertainties in the assumptions, however,
this conclusion must be considered as repre-
sentotive aond qualitative rather than quantitative.
Within the ogccuracy of the measurements, no
temperature effect was found between 650 and
750°C.  |n principle, electromigration should be
a very efficient means of recovering Li* from a
spent fuel, but the engineering arrangements for

some extremely formidable problems. Even the

2.3. THEORY OF MOLTEN FLUORIDE BEHAYIOR

F. F. Blankenship

CORRELATIONS OF MOLTEN FLUORIDE
BEHAVIOR BASED ON CHARGE-TO-10ON
RADIUS RATIOS
M. Blander

An attempt has been made to correlate the be-
havior of molten fluorides from the standpoint of
cation-gnion attroction. Emphosis on cation-onion
offinity has, however, largely obscured the effects
of repulsion of like charges in the melt, which
ore  probobly more important than cation-anion
attraction effects in causing negative deviations
from ideal solution behavier in liquids in which
the components mix with little or ne structural
change. To the extent that emphasis on cation-
anion attraction implies the existence of discrete
complex iens in all fueride melts, the concept is
misleading.

A mixture of solts with slightly ditferent Z/R
(charge-to-ion radius) ratios, in which no structural
change from that of the melten components results,
will be energetically more stable than the unmixed
salts, olthough the anion-cation attroctive forces
are not aitered by the mixing. An example of this
is shown in Fig. 2.3.1. Configuretion A for the
mixture 15 more stoble than the average of config-
vrations 8 aond C, which represent the pure com-
ponents, in thai the larger the difference in 1/r for
Li* and K* or in Z/r at equol r for the twocations,
the more negative becomes the energy of mixing,
AE {mixing}. f the Z/R ratios of the two salts
differ only slightly, the siructure of the mixture
will differ only slightly from the structures of
the <¢omponents, and the extra stobility of the
mixture will be small.

I the Z/R rotios differ considerobly ond es-
pecially if the salts are of widely different valence
states, the extra stability of the mixture will be
large, ond the structure will be considerably dis-
torted in comparison with the structures of the
component salts, that is, the larger the difference
in Z/R ratios, the more stable the mixture relative
fo its components. For components which mix
without o change in coordinotion number and with
little distortion, the negative deviation from ideal
solution behavior is occounted for, in the main,
by a decrease in cation repulsive energy upon
mixing.

SOME ASPECTS OF SOLUTION BEHAVIOR
OF FLUORIDE MELTS
R. F. Newton F. F. Blankenship

The polarizability of ions, which can be inter-
preted in terms of portially covalent bonds between
ions, is a factor in the solution behavior of molten
Huoride melts thot is usuvoily secondary but which
moy be important in many melten electrolytes.
Fortunaiely, the fluoride melts of interest as
reactor fuels cepresent a rather extreme cose in
which the effects of polarization of the ions appear
to be of little consequence.

Foremost among the factors controlling the
solution behavior of molten electrolytes is the
effect of ion charge ond size on the coulombic
force between neighboring fons. Progressively

configuration result from electrostatic inferoctions
between next nearest neighbors, and so on, until
the effect becomes negligible with distence. This
electrostatic behovior has long been recognized
as a controtling factor in the lattice energy of
ioni¢c crystals.

All the moiten fluorides which have been con-
sidered as possible fuels in the large develepment
program contain cationic componenis of widely
different valence state (U'”, Zrt', Be?", Na™h
which may be expected, from apy standpoint, to
show large negative deviations from ideal solution
behavior and large distortions from the structures
of the pure molien components. Accordingly, it
)5 convenient 10 correlate the observed behavior
of these complex liquid systems in terms of the
attraction between the fluoride ions and the neigh-
boring cations.

The attractive force is given, for the case in
which the ions are in direct contact by the relation

Zez
F = —— .

{ry + ?’_)2

where F is the attractive force, Z is the charge
on the cation, e is the charge on theoeleciron, T,
is the cation radivs, and r_ is 1.33 A, the radius
of an F~ ion. It is convenient to vse r in ang-
stroms, the charge of the electron as the unit of
chorge, ond Z as the volence of the cation. In
these wunits the attractive energy (E) between ¢

flouride ion and a cation it is touching is

which is numerically equal teo —-Z/R where R
=7, br_ .

The ions in ¢ selution tend to arronge them-
selves in positions of lowest energy. Accordingly,
the mutual energy velue -Z/R determines the
position of the fluoride ions with respect to alter-
native cations, and fluoride ifons will prefer as
nearest neighbors those cations which yield the
lorgest Z/R rotios.! The Z/R values derived

 

]This viewpoint ossumes that altermotive positions
exist. Such an assumption can be avoided and the some
gualitative correlation can be reached by cttributing the
negotive deviotions to the decreose in cation-cotlon
repul sien that cecurs when salts of different Z/R volues
are mixed.

from estimates of ionic radii in crystals are given
in Table 2.3.1.

An increase in the difference in the Z/R ratios
of the cations of a flueride solutien will result in
an increase in the negative devistions from ideal
solution behavior shown by the mixture. Exomples
of conformity with this Z/R rule were given
previously.?

In order to predict the behavior of selutes in
binary solvents it is necessary to know the effective
Z2/R for the binary solvent.  Presumcply the
effective Z/R for the solvent (as for ony mixture)
varies with composition between the volues for
the pure components; however, the precise shape
of the curve (or surface) for Z/R vs composition
If the Z/R ratio for a
simple solute is identical with the effective Z2/R
ratio for the complex selvent, the solution com-

is not readily ascertained.

composition. The activity coefficient of the solute
15 ot a maximum ot the neutrol composition, and
the further the composition of the solvent from
this composition the smaller will be the activity
coefficient of the solute. This principle provides
a basis for evoluotion of effective Z/R ratios for
the NaF-ZrF, system, for exomple, as a function
of composition,
coefficients of soiutes as a function of solvent
composition, neutral compositions ond effective
Z/R ratios for the salvents can be established.
This process will be relatively labericus, and
completely quentitetive data will be unovailable
for some time. An attempt is moade in the next

section of this chapter to extend this concept
with the available data. The principle is gquite
useful, however, even in qualitotive form, in that
it can be used to exploir the opparently anomalous
differences in vapor pressures of the NaF-ZrfF,
system when UF, is added or substituted.

Mixtures of NaF (Z/R = 0.43) and ZrF, (Z/R
= 1.82) corresponding to Na,ZrF, show large
negative devictions from ideality, and the vaopor
pressure of Zer from such a mixture is much less
than would be expected. The addition of UF,
(Z/R = 1.68) to such a melt serves to increase
the average Z/R for the mixture and thus to lower
the activity eoefficient of NeF ond to raise the

activity coefficient of ZrF,.  Accordingly, the

A STRUCTURE MODEL AND AN AC|D-BASE
SYSTEM FOR FUEL MIXTURES

0. G, Hill F. F. Blonkenship

A useful qualitative model for describing the
liquid structure of fuel mixtures based on the
NaF-ZrF, system was devised in which liguid
Zrf , is considered to be ¢ somewhat disorganized
lattice of flyoride bridges connecting zirconium
ions.”> At the other end of the system, molten
NaF contains sodium ions and fluoride ions. The
addition of NeF to ZrF4 results in the breaking
of the bridges to give zirconium ions which cre
surrounded partially by bridging fluorides and
partially by nonbridging flucrides.

According to the proposed model, the addition
of ZrF, to a large excess of NaF results in the
formation of ZrF,~77 iens, and thus for the com-
position range of up to 25 mole % Zrf the liquid
is composed of Nu+, F=, and ZrF,” ™" ions. At
25 mole % ZrF | most of the free fluoride ions have
been incorporated in ZrF,” 77, since the stoi-
chiometry of the meit conforms to Nu3ZrF? (ref &).
The fluorides attoched to the ZrF =77 ions are
examples of nonkridging fluorides, as distinguished
from free fluorides and bridging fluorides. If
more ZrF, is odded, it connot form additional
ZrF,=~~ lons but can only share some of the
olready complexed fluorides. The shared fluorides
are referred to as bridging fluorides.

With increased Zer concentrations, there is
a further decrease in the numbar of nonbridging
fluorides and an increase in the number of bridging
fluorides to eight per zirconium in pure ZrF

(ref 7).

time, |f seven, which is near the upper limit,
is used as the coordingtion number for the 50

there is an interlocking network of Zr*' ions
joined by an average of four bridges to other
ions. The U4" ions substitute for Zr*" ions
without altering the picture very much, and Na”*
ions, also present, maintain electroneutrality in
the vicinity of nonbridging fluorides. The situation
is not static, since there is on extremely mobhile
equilibrium between the kinds of fluorides, and
the bridges are easily broken ond reformed.

For simplicity the model has been described
as though free fluoride ions did not exist at higher
concentrations than 25 mole % Zer. Actuolly

YAPOR PRESSURES OF MOLTEN FLUCRIDES
5. Cantor

The importance of detailed knowledge of solt
vapor behovior in both engineering considerations
and in the solution theory of fuels hos focysed
attention on the need for determinations of the
vapor pressures of the less volotile components
For a theoretical understanding
of solutions of molten electrolytes, vapor pressures
provide in principle a direct means of obtaining
the thermodynamic activities of the constituents.
In practice, the presence of associated molecules
in the vapor phase greatly complicates this method
of arriving at activities. It was formerly thought

in fue! mixtures.

that temperatures high enough to melt the olkali
halides should prevent the existence of all but
the simplest, or monomeric, in the
vapor; however, this is not the cose. As was
recently shown convincingly by Miller and Kusch,'

molecules

there are appreciable quantities of dimeric and
trimeric molecules in the vapor of alkali holides.

In order to proceed with a determination of
vapor species, the absolute vopor pressures of
molten olkali fluorides were meosured by the quasi-
static methed? used in this laboratory for obteining
vapor A sufficiently wide
temperature range was covered to give curvature

SURFACE TENSION AND DENSITY
OF MOLTEN UF,

S. l.anger

A preliminory value for the density of molten
UF, was obtained for use with previously reported
sessile-drop dota ' to give the surface tension of
molten UF,. At 1075°C, a density of 6.80 + 0.09
g/cn® was found by using grophite pycnometers.
There were some difficulties in calibration of the
pycnometer which prevent this velue from being
regorded as final. |t leods to o surface tension
of UF, of about 180 dynes compared with the
value of chout 140 dynes found from the pre-
liminory estimotes given in the previcus repon.w
Further experiments are currently being made in
order to obtain a firm value for the density.

The tentotive experimental velue given obove
for the density of liquid UF, is, surprisingly,
greater than the density of solid UF, {6.63 q:.],»"'t:m3
based on x-ray dato).!! The greater density of
the molten material and the behavior of the salt
surfoce leve! upon freezing in the pycnometer
appear to indicate that UF, either controcts or
expands only very slightly upon melting.

2,5. PRODUCTION OF PURIFIED FLUQRIDE MIXTURES
G, J. Nessle

PREPARATION OF VARIOUS PURE FLUODRIDES
B. J, Sturm L. G, Overholser

Preparation of YF3

The continving interest in moderators for use at
high temperotures encouraged considerable study
of the hydride of yttrium. Since the hydride is
prepared from metallic yttrium, which is made by
reduction of YFS, it has been necessary to prepare
considerable quantities of YF, for eveluation in
the metal manufacturing step.

The method of preparation used ta date has been
to dissolve Y,0, in the minimum quantity of
aoqueous HC! solution and to precipitate the
fluoride by the oddition of aqueows HF sclution.
The solid product is washed by decantation,
recovered by centrifugation, and given a pre-
liminary drying at 150°C in air.

The c¢rystalline product is dried for 4 to & hr
at 250°C under flowing helium in nicke! equipment
end then treated, in this equipment, with anhydrous
HF at 700 to 750°C for 12 hr. About 1400 ¢ of

YF, has been prepared in this fashion,

Preparation of Fluorides of Molybdenum

A previous report in this series! described the
preparation of what appeared to be a lower fluoride
of molybdenum by reduction of MoF, with FeF,.
tn odditional experiments this reduction product
has been collected in a condenser maintained at
110°C and subsequently redistilled in glass appa-
ratus. The yellow product, which is very unsiable
toward traces of moisture, melts at 78°C. This
is considerably higher than the 60°C previously
reported! as the melting point of the material
before distillation,

mokes it ditficult to obtain a clear x-ray pattern.

identify the compound or compounds in this yellow
material.

Preparation of Other Materials

The method of preparation of FeF, from
FeCl,-4H,0 has been improved considerably by
partial dehydration of the commercial materici
before the hydroflucrination step. The substitution
of anhydrous CrCl, for bydrated CrF, as the raow
materiol for CrFa preparation results in a pure
product; this improvement is entirely due to the
higher purity of the commercial chleride,

Hydrofluorination of CrCl, ot 700°C yields a
product coniaining o smali quantity of Cng. Most
of this contominant can be removed by treatment
with H, at 700°C. When this reduction is per-
formed in silver vessels, less Cr% contaminates
the product than when nicke! vessels are used.

FILOT-SCALE PURIFICATION OPERATIONS
C. R. Croft J. Truitt

During the quarter the pilot-scale equipment (5-,
10-, and 50-1b capacity) processed 42 batches
totaling 1575 |b ot the wvarious fluoride compo-
sitions needed in phase equilibrium studies,
physical property measurement, small-scale cor-
rosion tfests, and other experiments. A large
fraction of this material was MNaF-KF.-LiF-UF,
{11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %). Usage of this material
seems to be fairly constant at about 500 Ib pes
month,

Nickel storage receivers have been shown to be
inadequate for the NoF-KF-LiF-UF, material. The
lorge expansion of the moterial upon melting
results in failure of 75% of the 50-Ib storage
containers upon melting of the charge. Inconel
cans have, however, been shown to be satisfactory
for the 50-Ib botches. No failures have occurred
in the ten tests made to date; it is not certfoin,
however, that Inconel cans will be satisfactery
for 250-1% or lorger charges. When inadverteny
exposure of the molten salt mixture to air or water
securs in Inconel cons, extensive contamination
of the melt with Crf, ond Fef, results. Since
these contaminants cannoi be removed economi-
cally by retreatment of the batch, the material must
be discarded.
PRODUCTION-SCALE OPERATIONS
J. E. Eorgan

During the quarter 46 batches totaling approxi-
mately 11,500 |b were processed in the production-
scole focility. The transition to a seven-day
continuvous production schedule was begun on
November 5, 1956 ond full capocity of 4000 Ib per
month was attained in December 1956, No failures
of the cepper-lined stainless-steel reactor cans
occurred during the quarter. The reactors now in
service have each processed neorly 10,000 b of
material since their installation. If the supply
of storage cons can be maintained and no major
breckdowns occur, the present rate of production
con apparently he maintained indefinitely.

This acceleroted program was adopted ot the
request of the AEC to meet the estimated re-
quirements for processed fluorides to be used in
the ANP program by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft and
by ORNL. During the last month of this quarter,
however, the Pratt & Whitney requirements were
greatly reduced. The projected total requirements
for the last half of fiscal year 1957 dropped from
37,000 1o opproximately 12,000 |b. Because of
the firm commitments made for the large omounts
of row materials, the personnel, and the operating
equipment oaeeded for the highly accelerated
program initiated in MNMovember 1956 and becouse
of the economies achieved by continuous operation,
it was deemed advisoble to maintain the high
oroduction rate until the end of this fiscal year.
However, the main objective has changed from
meeting immediate requirements to stockpiling
sufficient quantities of processed fluorides for
maintaining the ORNL effort in the ANP program
in fiscal year 1958. If this objective is attained,
the production focility will not be operated during
fiscal yeor 1958, except on a limited basis as
dictated by speciol large-scale demands of nen-
standard fluoride compositions, At present the
estimated ORNL-ANP requirements are foreseen
as some 14,000 |b of processed fluorides for fiscal
year 1958,

Sore 18,000 of the 30,000 Ib of NaZrF, ordered

the vendor in eliminating oxide contamination and
adjusting the NoF-to-ZrF, rotios have been re-
solved by a visit to the vendor's plant. Subsequent
shipments have had the proper ratios, and the
previous high purity levels have been meintained.

PFPENETRATION OF GRAPHITE BY MOLTEN
FLUORIDES

H. J. Buttrom

The study of the behovior of graphite exposed
to molten fluorides was continued.! Tests were
conducted to evaluate a commercial graphite
specimen that was impregnated with NoF-ZrF,
(53-47 mole %) before being exposed to a fluoride
mixture containing uranium. The impregnation of
commercial APC graphite specimens was ac-
complished by immersing them for 24 hr in the
fluoride mixture melt kept ot BOOPC. After this
treatment, the impregnated specimen was heated
in vacuum for 24 hr at S00PC in order to remove
part of the ZrF, and thus to obtain a residual
mixture with o higher melting temperature. [t
would be expected thot on impregnating material
that was solid when exposed to the uronium-
bearing melt would resist penetration more suc-
cessfully than one thot was liquid and could thus
diffuse from the pores.
and a control sample that had not been heated in
vacuum wete submitted for analysis. The results
of the analyses are presented in Table 2.6.1, along
with the calculated Naf-to-ZrF | rotios.

The analytical results indicote that the NaF
penetrated the graphite to o greater extent than
the ZrF, did, by a facter of 12 (4.16/0.34). The
sublimation step effected a further separation of
the ZrF,, as wos expected, and ofter sublimation

about 16:1,

Two other types of graphite, code Nos. R-28
and M-80, obtained from the National Carbon
Company were also tested by impregnation, os
described above. The samples impregnoted with
NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %} were subsequently im-
mersed into NaF-ZrF,.UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %).
The olpha counts obtained from these specimens
were compared with the counts obtained with
specimens immersed directly into the uranium-
bearing mixture without preliminary impregnation.
The data obtained are presented in Table 2.6.2.
The results indicate that the grophite specimens
were not penetrated to any consideraoble degree by
either of the salt mixtures, and thus these speci-
mens compare favorably in this respect with the
sample obtoined from the Degussa Company of
Germany and, in oddition, appecr to have greater
strength.

eliminate the mass-transfer effects observed in
sodium hydroxide circylated under a temperature
gradient.

The experimental arrangement being used con-
sists of three closed concentric nickel crucibles,
which serve os electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2.6.1.
The outer vessel is 6 in. long and 21{1 in. in
diemeter. The middle container is ]]é in, in di-
ameter and 8 in. long, and a small hole was drilled
in the bottom to atiow the molten sodium hydroxide
to rise to the same level as in the outer container,
The inner electrode consists of a ]é-in.-dio nickel
tube, The bottem of the tube was c¢losed ond o
thermocouple was welded inside. For tests, the
three electrodes were placed concentrically in
the furnace in o controiled atmosphere. About
150 g of sodium hydroxide was used as the charge.
in this orrangement the outer electrode had hy-
drogen gas on one side and molten sodium
hydroxide on the other side. The middle electrode
had melten sodium hydroxide on both sides. The
ettect of voricus arrangements could be studied
by connecting the electrodes to the positive or
negative poles of batteries,

In one experiment a relatively low test temper-
ature (550°C} was used; the middle electrode was

134

connected to the negative peole; and the inner
electrode was connected fo the positive pole of
the outside bottery. Current and voltage measure-
ments were made by slowly raising the applied
voltage and meesuring the corresponding current.
Two sets of measurements were made with the
system under o hydrogen otmosphere ond also with
the system under vacuum.

The results, plotted in Fig. 2.6.2, show that
under a hydrogen atmosphere the current increosed
much foster than it did under wvacuum, which
indicates that hydrogen participated in the current-
carrying mechenism,

Measurements were aiso made at 800°C, with o
hydrogen atmosphere, for which the curment flowed
either from the inner electrode to the outer elec-
trode or in the reverse direction. |t may be seen
in Fig. 2.6.3 thot, when the current was flowing
from the inner electrode toward the middle elec-
trode, the current increased continuously with the
voltage. In the reverse case o definite ploteau
was reached, that is, as the voltoge was increased,
the current remained constant up to a value some-
what below 2 v. A theoreticol interpretation of
these results will require ¢ more systematic study
of the effect of current density, The polarization
of hydrogen electrodes is probably invelved.

In the tests which were carried out, a 5-in.-1D fube
furnace was placed between the two optical com-
ponents of the instrument. Absorption celis, con-
structed of 24-in. lengths of :}:‘-in.-diu Inconel
tubing and fitted with end windows of optical
quartz, were ploced in the furnace so that each
light beam traoversed an chsorption cell, After the
furnocce was heated, the optical components were
aligned and the instrument was balanced by rotating
the spertures until a minimum signal wos abserved
A sample of
sodium-containing air, which wos prepaored by
admitting meosured quantities of helium thot had
been saturcted with sodium vapor to a stream of air,
was introduced into one of the absorption tubes, and
the deflection of the cutput meter wos observed.

When o sample calculated to contain 25¢ ppb of
sodium was introduced into the absorption tube,
the observed signal produced o deflection equal to
twice that of the original balance of the meter. On
the basis ofthe observed stability of the instrument,
it was found that 100 ppb of sodium could be easily
detected. As was reported,? however, the technique

on the ocutput meter of the amplifier,

used for the preparation of somples of sodium-
containing air did not yield quantitative fransfer of
sodium to the air, ond thus these preliminary
measurements may not truly reflect the sensitivity
of this instrument, It wos found that no evidence of
sodium could be observed when the effluent gases
containing the sodium from the ocbsorption tube were
pessed through an air-propane flame, It oppears
that the stipulated limit of detection of 10 ppb of
sodium can be achieved by oppropriate sampling
techniques and refinements in the alignment of the
instrument.

Tests were carried out for selecting o suitable
material tc use in the fabrication of orifices with
which to inject small quantities of NaK into air,
Zirconivm was the only satisfactory material found
among the materials tested. A 0,003-in, orifice in
crystal-bar zirconium was entarged less than 20% by
the ejection of NaK for o period of 30 min at o

Surface oxide is removed by transferring three 20-ml

ANALYSESOF LITHIUM-BASE FLUORIDE 3ALTS
FOR METALLIC IMPURITIES

The development program on the application of
nickel-molybdenum atloys as container materials for
fused lithium-base flyoride salts has necessitated
o number of modifications in existing methods for
the analysis of metallic impurities in the fluoride
salts. In additien to the usuval determinations fer
iron, chromium, and nickel, the sclts are presently
being onalyzed for molybdenum, niobium, titanium,
tungsten, vonadiuvm, and aluminum, Methods for
determining all these metals were developed previ-
ously, but some modifications were necessory in
the methods used for the aluminum, vanodium, and
titanium analyses in order to eliminate interferences
introduced by the presence of other metals. The
status af the work on the modifications is given
in the following sections.

The method of Wise and Brandt® for the determi-

nation of microgram quontities of pentavalent

based on standards, is 2%.

Most of the interfering ions, including nickel,
iron, chromium, ond molybdenum, are removed by
deposition at the mercury cathode. Although the
vanadium is reduced to the quadrivalent oxidetion
state by the mercury cothode, it remains in solution
and is accompanied by the uronium, alumiaum, and
titanium.  Argentic oxide, AgQO, is then used to
oxidize the vanadium to the pentavalent state. As

final determination, When the ratio of either alumi-

hydrogen sulfide,'® and therefore experiments were
carried out to test the efficiency of this solution
for reducing microgram quontities of sulfote and to
test its applicability to the determination of sulfur
in fluoride salts.

Difficulty wos experienced with the red phospho-
rus reducing mixture when the sample size was
increased beyond 200 mg, and therefore the phos-
phoric acid mixture, which can conveniently handle
l-g samples, has en important advantage in that a
fivetold increose in sensitivity is achieved., A
second advantage of the phosphoric acid reducing
mixture is that the fluoride sclts are decomposed.
Uronium tetrafluoride is brought into selution, and
zirconivm  fluoride is converted to zirconium
phosphate,

The determination is carried out by adding about
20 ml of a solution of snCl, and phospheric acid
to o 1-g sample of fluoride salt. Boric anhydride
is then added to complex the fluoride and to mini-
mize etching of the gloss apparatus. The phos-
phoric acid solution is heated to 300 to 310°C to
reduce the sulfates to hydrogen sulfide, which is
passed into a solution of zinc acetate by means of
a stream of orgon. The quontity of hydrogen sulfide
is then determined by the methylene blue procedure.
The coefficient of variation of the method was found
to be approximately 10% for 5- to 20-pg quantities
of sulfur,

YAPOR-PHASE POLYMERS IN
ALKALI-HALIDE SALTS

L. Q. Gilpatrick

A knowledge of the composition of the vapor phase
of the fused-salt fuel mixture is important to the
investigation of the vapor-deposition problem in
circutating-fuel reactors, It is alsc indispensable
for the measurement of activities of components of
salt mixtures when vopor-pressure methods of
Therefore o study of the
vapor phase of alkoli-halide sclts was initiated.
It has been reported??=22 that the equilibrium
vapor phase of mony simple moterials, such as
copper chloride, carbon, and petassium chloride,
contain simple polymeric species that are most
frequently dimers and trimers. When the olkali-
halide salts ore heated in on effusion cell, it is
possible to meosure the change in the vopor com-
position as o function of cell temperature. The
mass spectrometer is well suited for application
te this proeblem, since with it the species which are
derived from polymers in the vapor con be measured

measurement ore used.

independently, Onlyrelative values can be measured
with the use of this technique; however, energies or
heats of vaporization and the heats of palymerization
can be determined from the retative values, The
mass spectrometer is also o sensitive tool for the
qualitative examiration of the vapor phase of halide
salts and other moterials,

A satisfactory effusion cetl wos developed, and
potassium chloride is currentlty being examined at
temperatures from 550 to 750°C. Preliminary values
for the energy of vaporization of KCi monomer and
dimer were found to be 49.3 and 58.3 kecol/mole,
respectively, No higher polymers were detected.
The next salts to be exomined will be the olkali
fluorides, since they are of interest in the investi-
gotion of fused-salt fuel systems.

DYNAMIC CORROSION STUDIES

FORCED-CIRCULATION LOOP TESTS
J. H. DeVon R. 5. Crouse

Fuel Mixtures in Inconel and in Hastelloy B

Three forced-circulation loops fobricated of
Hastelloy B were examined that had circulated
NaF-KF-LiF-UF , (11.2-41-45.3-2,5 mole %, fuel
107) at a maximum flyid temperotyre of about
1650°F, The loops were heated by direct elec-
trical resistonce and were constructed from !’Q-in.-
0D, 0.060-in,-wail tubing, The operating con-
ditions for these three loops are given in Table
311,

Two of the loops completed 1000 hr of operation,
although interruptions that required temporary
shutdowns occurred during both tests. Loop
7641-18 developed o leak while fuel was being
admitted to the loop for o test run, The loop was
successfully repaired, and it then operated for
the scheduled 1000-hr period without further diffi-
culties. Loop 7641-2B developed a leak after
65 hr of operation and was likewise repaired and
operated for the remainder of the scheduled 1000-hr
period, Operation of the third loop, 7641-3, was
terminated by a pump tfailure ofter 407 hr of opera-
tion,

The hot legs of all three loops were found to be
badly pitted after the tests, with the pits in the
most heovily attacked areas reaching to o depth
of 4 mils, Unfortunctetly, the surfaces of the as-

received Hastefloy B tybing were rough, as shown
by the sample in Fig. 3.1.1, and thus o large part
of the pitting was probably present before the
test. The cold-leg sectiens of loops 7641-18 and
7641-3 were entirely free of metal deposits, but
they had deeper surface imperfections thaan those
found in the hot-leg sections, In some areas of
the cold legs the pits reached a depth of 7 mils;
however, as may be seen in Fig. 3.1,2, which
shows a cold-leg section of loop 7641-1B, the
surface imperfections appear to be the result of
corrosion deepening of the pits present before the
test,

The examination of loop 7641-2B likewise re-
vealed deeper pits in the cold leg than in the hot
leg. In contrast to the other two foops, joop
7641.2B, however, was found to have o few small
metal crystals in the cold leq. These crystalline
depesits occurred in clumps, opproximately 2 mils
thick, that were confined to g short section of the
loop near the cold-leg outlet, As shown in Fig.
3.1.3 the crystals were completely detached from
the loop wall., The quentity of deposited material
was insufficient for ¢ chemical analysis, ond it
s not known whether the crystals resulted from
groins becoming detached from the extremely rough
as-received surfaces or from a mass-transfer
mechanism, Loop 7641-2B operated with the
lowest Reynolds number used in the three tests,
and it is doubtiui that mass transfer would take

An investigotion of the design of the cold trap

The maximum tluid temperature of each

used in these loops was made prior to beginning
these studies to determine the effectiveness of
such a trap in controlling the oxide level. In a
spectal test loop containing a bypass cold trap
and a device known as a "'plugging meter,’’ NaK
was circuloted isothermally ot 1500°F, and meas-
vrements were made of the oxide concentration of
the NaK under vorious conditions of cold-trap
temperatures ond flow rates, The plugging meter
was wsed to indicate the soturation temperature of
sodium oxide in the NaK under each of the cold-
trap opercting conditions, The scturation tempera-

ture, together with published information on the
solubility limits of sodium oxide in NaK as a
function of temperature, was used to establish

the oxide concentration, These tests demonstrated
that the cold-trap operating temperature in the
range from 100 to 1200°F accurately reflected the
oxide concentration; that is, the oxide concentra-
tion which existed in the NaK corresponded to the
limit of solubility for sodium oxide in MaK at the
cold-trap temperature,

trap operating temperotures

The weights of the deposits in these loops show
that a noticeoble increose in the quantity of ma-
terial deposited was brought about by an increase
in the cold-trap temperature from 600 to BOO°F,
This increase is also reflected in the deposit
thickness. A smaller difference in deposit thick-
ness is apparent in comparing the results for the
test with o cold-trap temperature of 600°F with
those for the two tests with lower cold-trap tems
peratures, Metallographic examinations of cold-
ieg sections from these loops also indicate that
the change in the amount of deposited material
accompanying a decrease in cold-trap temperature
below 600°F is less than the chonge from 800 to
500 P

As mentioned above, the size of the particles
comprising the deposits is opparently affected by
the cold-trap temperature and the oxide concentra-
tion. Deposits taken from similor sections of the
toops operated with cold-trap temperatures of 100
and 800°F are comparad in Figs. 3.1.6 and 3.1.7.
As con be seen, the average particle size of the
crystals found in the loop which included o cold
trap operated at BOO°F was considerably larger
than that of the crystals from the loop operated
with a cold-trap temperature of 100°F, The compe-
sitions af the deposits did not vary with cold-trap
temperafure; in all the loops, the deposits were
found to contain approximately 90% Ni and 10% Cr.

oxides in Inconel-NaK systems show trends quite

sodium systems, which were discussed previously®
were carried out by making oxide additions directly
to the sodium. The effects on mass transfer were
small for oxide additions of 0.05 wt % and less but
became significant at higher concentrations, Addi-
tiona! data {not presented previcusly) showed that
the deposit porticle size alsc increcsed as the
oxide level increosed,

A difference in the guantity of mass-transferred
material in sedium-lnconel systems compared with
thet in NaK-lnconel systems has now become
apparent, The weighis of the deposits in the two
recently tested NeK-Incenel systems are somewhat
less thon one-half the weights of deposits found
in sodium-inconel systems tested under similar
temperature conditions, The thicknesses of the
deposits found in both systems are comparable,
although as discussed in conjunction with the first
NaK ha-s.nr.,:3 thickness measurements do not cccu-
rately reflect the weights of the deposits because
the crystals comprising the deposits build up quite
randomty and in discontinuous patches.

The composition ond manner of deposition of the
crystals in the two systems oppear to be identical,
The average size of the crystals comprising the
deposits in both systems is also similer, Thus it
appears that the same mechanism for mass transfer
exists in both systems but that the process pro-
ceeds slower in NaK-lnconel systems than in
sodivm-lnconel systems.

Sodium in lnconel ond in Stainless Steel

Two Inconel forced-circulation loops of a design
similar 1o that shown in Fig. 3.1.4 were operated
with sodium at ditferent velocities to evaluate
the effect of flow rate on mass transfer. The
sodium temperatures ranged from a maximum of
1500°F in the hof leg to a minimum of 1200°F in
the ¢old leg. The pumps were operated at different
power levels to establish sodium flow rotes of
Both loops con-
tained bypass cold traps fo maintain low oxide
levels.

Examinations of the toops following 1000 hr of
operation revealed a substantial difference in the
quantities of deposited material recovered from

flow rate of 1.5 gpm (loop 7426-22), the deposit
weighed 10.4 g, A doubled flow rate of 3.0 gpm
(loop 7426-23) resulted in an increase in the weight
of the deposit to 14.0 g. Hot-leg attack in both
toops was in the form of intergrenular penetration
and reached maximum depths of 2 mils in each
case. [he average thickness of the deposit alsc
varied with the flow rate, The thickness at the
lower flow rote was 12 mils, while at the higher
flow rate the thickness increased to 22 mils.

Several other sodium loops have been operated
at flow rates of 2.5 gpm, and the results can be
compared with the results of tests described above,
While the mojority of the loops operoted with o
sodium flow rote of 2.5 gpm, each loop test in-
corporated some variable which introduced o slight
difference from the condifions described above,
An averoge value of deposit weight for the tests
which most closely simulated the conditions given
above is 13 g. A plot of the data given above and
the 13-g volue is presented in Fig. 3.1.8 to show
the effect of flow rate,

A type 304 stainless steel forced-circulation
loop completed 1000 hr of operation with sodium at
o maximum temperafure of 1500°F ond a tempero-
ture drop of 300°F, The loop contained an oxide

1500°F, Fluid flow was meintained ot 1,28 gpm.
After 2480 hr of operation, a [eak developed in the
heater coil of the loop, ond the NaK had to be
dumped, The heater coil was replaced, ond the
loop was again put inte operation. Afrer an addi-
tional 280 hr, operation was terminated when a
similar leck developed in the new heater coil,

Metallographic examination of the hot leg which
wos removed from the loop after 2480 hr revealed
light-to-heavy intergranular attack to o depth of
1.5 mils, A needlelike deposit, 7 mils in depth,
was also observed in the section just beyond the
heater coil where the loop first experienced a
thermal gradient, The cooled coil, which was in
operation an cdditional 280 hr, showed only light-
to-moderate pifs, along with intergranular attack to
a depth of 1 mil. Metal deposits reached a maxi-
mum thickness of 14 mils in the section at the
entrance to the cooled coil.

A similar {oop was operated with sodium as the
circulated fluid. Operation of this loop {7426-51)
was terminated after 4000 hr, when a leak developed
near the pump. The operating conditions, with the
exception of the temperoture gradient, were similar
to those for loop 7439-51, Because of the better
heat tronsfer properties of sodium, a thermal
gradient of BDO®F was achieved., Sodivm attack in
the hot-leg section of the loop reached a maximum
depth of 5 mils. A heavy deposit of metal crystals
that reached o moximum thickness of 50 mils was
found in the section at the entronce to the cooling
coil. The depesit is shown in Fig, 3.1.11.

Carbide precipitates were found at the surfaces
of the inner walls of the tubing which hed been
exposed to sodium and, to a lesser extent that
varied with depth, in the wall of the tubing. The
diffusion of carbon therefore appears to have pro-
ceeded from the inner wall of the tubing into the
tubing, ond thus the source of the carbon must have
been the sadium, This loop contaired ¢ mechanical
pump, and ¢ slight leak through the pump seal of
the oil for lubricating the pump could have been
responsible for the carburization found,

The loops for these long-duration tests were of
a unique design, and therefore the results cannot
be compored directly with the results of other
tests of shorter duration,
observed in the loop which circulated sodium indi-
cafe that moss transfer proceeds at a rate which

THERMAL-CONYECTION LOOP TESTS

NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and Sedium in Nickel-
Melybdenum Alloys

Fuel 107, — Corrosion tests of the experimental
nickel-molybdenum alloys exposed to scdium and
to NoF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45,3-2.5 mole %, fuel
107) in thermal-convection loops were completed.
The compositions of the alloys tested, the test
conditions, and the results of metcllographic ex-
aminations of as-tested specimens are given in
Table 3.1,5.

The daota show that a maximum hot-leg attack of
3 mils occurred in loops 1105 (16% Mo=-2% Al-—
1.5% Ti—bal Ni) and 1108 (17% Mo-2% Al-bal Ni).
These results are in good agreement with the data
regorted previously for materials with relotively
high oluminum content. The attack wos accom-
panied by high aluminum pickup in the fuel, as
shown in Table 3.1,6.

Loop 1093 {17/% Mo—7% Cr~bal Ni} showed hot-
leg attack which wos somewhaot higher than that
found previously in loops fabricated from material
containing comporable amounts of chromium.® Also
the attack changed from the moderate general sub-
surface-void formation in the loops operated pre-
viously to heavy general subsurface-void formation.
Loop 1094 (20% Mo-7% Cr-2% Nb—1% Fe~bal Ni)
revealed hot-leg attack similar to that for loop 1093,
The addition of niobium and iren thus appecrs to
have little effect on the corrosion of o nickel-
molybdenum atloy centaining 7 wt % chromium.,
Hot-leg specimens from loops 1093 ond 1094 are
pictured in Figs. 3.1.12 and 3.1.13. As may be
seen in Toble 3.1.%, the concentration of chromium
in the fuel of loop 1094 is also comparable to thot
found in the fyel in other nickel-
molybdenum alloys containing 7 wt % chromium,

circulated

Comparisons showed similor maximum depths of
attack in loops 1094 and 1099, which were fabri-
cated of alloys of similar composition except that
the otloy used for loop 1099 contained 1 wt %

of 2 mils in this loop (1101) is comparable to the
attacks in the above loops containing 7 wt %
chromium, However, the chromium content in the
fuel after test was noticeably lower in the case of
loop 1101 (5 wt % chromium) than in the loops
with 7 wt % chromium,

Additions of 2 1o 4 wt % tungsten to the nickel-
molybdenum alloy did not affect the depth of attock.
The hot-feg attack to a depth of 1.5 mils found in
loop 1113 (17% Mo-2% W-bal Ni) is shown in
Fig., 3.1.14. As may be seen the attack was pre-
dominontly intergranular, which is uncommoen for
nickel-molybdenum alloys exposed to fuel 107,
Another loop fabricated of material from the scme
heat alse showed intergronuler ottack after opera-
tion with sodium. The atteck by fuel 107 in loop
1120 (17% Mo~4% W-bal Ni}, fabricated from a
different heat containing 4 wt % tungsten, was of
the usual general subsurface-void-formation type
and there were surface pits to a depth of 1 mil,
The differences in the ottack of the alloys con-
taining 2 and 4 wt % tungsten moy result from
differences in the groin-boundary constituents of
the two alloys. The chemical onalyses of the fuel
mixtures circulated in the two loops show sizable
amounts of tungsten, as high as 1465 ppm,

fuel mixtures circulated in these loops, There was
no appreciable vanadium buildup in the fuel from
loop 1100, There was, however, as indicated in
Table 3.1.6, a buildup of niobium in the fuel from
loops 1126 and 1131, with the niobium content of
the fuel from the loop containing 5 wt % niobium
being greater than that of the fuel from the loop
containing 3 wt % nicbium, A slight buildup of
titanium was evident in the fuel from the loop con-
taining 2 wt % titanium (lcop 1098), although the
level of titanium in the fuel after the test was
much less than the level of aluminum in fuel from
loops Loops containing
titanium along with other alloying elements (1087,
1101, 1103, 1105} showed similar titanium con-
centrations in the fuel aofter the tests, with emounts

Sadium, — Date on the nickel-molybdenum alloy
loops operated with sodium are presented in Table
3.1.5. Mass-tronster depasits were visible in
nickel-molybdenum alloy loops 1023 {11% Mo~2%
Al=bal Ni), 1088 {20% Mo=1% Nb=2% Ti=0.8% Mn-
bal Ni), 1089 (15% Mo-3% Nb-0.5% Al-3% W-baol
Ni), 1102 (16% Mo~5% Cr—1.5% Ti-1% Al-bal Ni),
and 1117 {17% Mo-2% W-bal Ni}, whick eperated
for 1000 hr with sedium at a maximum temperature
of 1500°F; however, deposits were found metallo-
graphically only in loop 1102, These deposits
differed from deposits in Inconel-sodium systems
in that they did not adhere tightly to the locp wall.
Consequently, the deposits could be mechanically
removed, and thus they were lost during preporation
of metallographic samples, The quantity of de-
posited material visible in these foops was com-
parable to the quantities found in Inconel ioops
operated with sodium under similar conditions.
Chemical cnalyses of the deposited material found
in loop 1102 showed 6350 ppm Mo, 3400 ppm Al,
94% Ni, and 3.57% Cr.

The moximum hot-leg attack in atl these loops
averaged slightly more than 1 mil. The attack
aoppeared es subsurface voids and pits, ond thus
was similar to that found in the hot legs of loops
thot circulated fuel 107, With the exception of the
otloy that contained 2 wt % tungsten, the grain
boundaries were not preferentially attacked. This
result is in confrast to the results for Inconel loops
inwhich attack by sedium is normally intergranulor,
Yoid Migration in Inconel Exposed
to Na F-ZrF‘-UF4

Three standard Inconel thermai-convection loops
were operated with NoF-ZrF -UF , {50-46-4 mole %,
fuel 30) at o bulk fluid temperature of 1500°F,
One foop {1085) was terminated ofter 277 hr of
operation; the fuel in the second loop (1086) was
repiaced with helium after 280 hr, and the loop
was held at test temperature for the remoining
scheduled operating period of 1000 hr; the third
leop (1010), included as a control locp, operated
the scheduled 1000 hr with fuel.

An analysis of the corrosion process in Inconel
systems containing fluorides indicates thot the
rate of attack (that is, void formation) becomes
constant when the test period exceeds 250 hr,
This linear relationship of ertack with time is
reached following an initial period of rapid attack
resulting from the equilibration of the fluorides
with |nconel, It was first assumed thai the linear
migration of voids into Inconel with time repre-
sented a constant rote of chromium removal with
time. However, questions were posed as to whether
even in the absence of further chromium removal
some void formation might continue as a result of
the rapid stage of atteck represented by the equili-
bration of flucrides. The purpose of these tests
was therefore to determine whether the migration
of voids into the Incenel, instituted by the leaching
of chromium during the corrosion process, would
continue if a loop were left at test temperature
without fuel,

Me tallegraphic examination of loop 1085 revecled
heavy surface roughening and heavy general sub-
sutface-void formation to o depth of 1 mil in the
hot leg, accompanied by heavy intergranuiar
subsurioce-void formation to a maximum depth of
8 mils., The cold leg showed only heavy surface
roughening, Comparison of the hot legs of loops
1085, 1086, and 1010, shown in Fig, 3.1.15, indi-
cated the attack in loops 1085 and 1086 to be
identicol in depth, extent, and type of void forma-
tion, Further metallographic exaemination through-
out both loops revealed similar corrosion of re-
spective metaliographic somples. 1n control leop
1010, which operated with a different batch of fuel,
the maximum hot-leg attack was 12 mils, which
raprasents the normal depth of corresion of Inconel
vnder these conditions,

The results of these tests provide evidence that
the migration of voids into Inconel, instituted by

the leaching of c¢hromium during the corrosion
process, does not continue if the loop is left at

coalescence of vacancies in the metal to form
visible veoids must proceed at a rate of least
commensurate with the rote at which vacancies

NaF-KF-LiF-U F“ and Sodium in Micbium

The compatibility of nicbium with NaF-KF-Lif-
UF, (11.,2-41.45,3-2,5 mole %, fuel 107} and with
sodium was studied in thermal-convection loops
operated at @ maximum fluid temperature of 1500°F,
The loops, which were fabricated by Battelle
Memorial
the standard loops employed for corrosion studies
of more common materials, The niobium tubing
used in the loops was fabricated from welded
sheet and had on inside diometer of 0.53 in. ond
a wall thickness of 0.020 in. In order to eliminate

Institute, were slightly smaller than

the niobium oxidation problem which would exist
at the test temperature, the niobium was encosed
in an outer sheath of type 321 stainless steel.
This sheath completely surrounded the nicbium
loop but wos not integrally bonded to if, Fabri-
cation of a sound loop of this design was difficult
in that cracks often developed in the niobium
tubing while the sheath was being assembled,
Three niobium loops (1072, 1073, ond 1022) were
operated 1664, 1000, ond 775 hr, respectively,
with fuel 107 ot a hot-leg temperature of 1500°F,
Termination of operation of loops 1072 ond 1022
was caused by o power failure and loss of flow,
respectively. An onelysis of the fuel circulated in
foop 1022 revealed a high buildup of chromium,
715 ppm, and pointed to the probability of a teak
that allowed the fuel to contact the cludding. The
examination of this foop showed an absence of
cold-leg deposits and only slight hot-leg attack in
the form of shallow pitting. Loops 1072 and 1073,
on the other hond, apparently remained sound
during operation, since no elements other thon
niobium were found in the fuel after the tests.
However, macroscopic examination of the loops
revealed metallic crystals in the fuel layer close
to the cold-leg wall. These crystols were evident
metallograghically, and are shown in Fig. 3,1.16.
Hot-leg attock in these loops occurred as shallow
pitting to a depth of less thon 1 mil. A typical

a comparison of the moss tronster and corrosion
resistance eof Hastelloy B and Inconel in sodium
systems, The loop operoted for 1008 hr at a
hot-zone temperature of 1600PF and a cold-zone
temperoture of 990°F. No significent differences
were found belween the amount of attack and
mass transfer found in this loop and in two lnconel
loops operated under similor conditions.? In all
three tests an air blast thot impinged on the

both nickel and chromium have not vet been
identified. It appears that nickel plating of the
Inconel prior to chromium plating is unnecessary
and pessibly undesirable for this application.
The results found at the chromium-plcted Inconel
vs  berytlium interfaces confirm the previous
findings which indicated that a minimuym of 5
mils of chromium plate is required to ensure that
all the chromium is not consuvmed by reaction with
the beryllium vnder the conditions of this ex-
periment. No serious spalling of the brittle
compounds Be, NI, ond Be,Cr was detected in

EFFECT OF ZIRCONIUM ON CORROSION IN
AN INCONEL-SODIUM SYSTEM

R. Carlander?

An lnconel-sodium thermal-convection loop with
a zirconium sleeve in its hot leg was operated
for 1000 hr with the hot teg at 1500°F and the
cold leg ot 1230°F in order to determine whether
the zirconium would remove oxygen from the
sodium and thus affect the corrosion of the Inconel.
Since no mass transfer and little attack occurred,
the test indicoted that the presence of zirconium
had a beneficial effect.” In an effort to sub-
stantiote these results, two Inconel standpipe
test copsules, one containing a zirconium speci-
men, the other an |nconel specimen, were 50%
filled with sedium and tested for 400 hr with the
tep and bottom of the sodium bath at 100G and
1600°F, respectively,

Mass transfer occurred in both copsules, and,
although the weight of the crystsls found in each
capsule was opproximately the same, the com-
position of the erystals (75.5% Ni—10.4% Cr-14.1%
Fe) from the copsule containing the Inconel speci-
men differed markedly from that of the crystals
(95.6% Ni=3.5% Cie~0.9% Fe) from the capsule
which contained the zirconium specimen. The
effect of zirconium on the moss-transfer ¢rystal
composition is net understood.

Visual examingtion of the =zirconium specimen
following the test indicated that no oxide scale
had formed. Metollographic exomination revealed

that o transition from alpha to beta zirconium
occurred in the center of the specimen, as was
expected as a result of heating the zirconium
from room temperature fo 1600°F. The outer
surfaces of the specimen, however, retained the
alpha structure to a depth of 40 mils, as shown
in Fig. 3.2.8. The retention of the alpho-structure
on the outer surfaces was thought to bhe due to
oxygen absorption which raised the alpha to beta
transition temperature, which is normally 1548°F,
to above the test temperature of 1600°F and thus
stabilized the olpha phase. In order to test this
hypothesis, two sets of millings from the surface
of the tested specimen, cne to o depth of 40 mils
(alpha region) and the other from a depth of 40
to 80 mils (beta region), and two sets of similar
millings from an as-received specimen were
chemically analyzed. The onolyses, reported in
Table 3.2.2, revealed that the alpha region did
absorb oxygen during the test.
ubilities of iron, nickel, ond chromium are higher

Since the sol-

in beta zirconium than in alpho zirconium, these
metais diffused from the alpha region to the beta
region during the test, as shown by the onolytical
results, The data obtained from these tests thus
indicate that the zirconium did remove oxygen
from the sodium; however, there wos no observable
reduction in the corrosion of Inconel as a result
of the oxygen removal by the zirconium.

MOLYBDENUM-BERYLLIUM COMPATIBILITY
IN SODIUM

R. Carlander

Two tests of the compatibility of molybdenum
ond beryllium in contact in static sodium were
conducted in the apparotus illystrated schema-
tically in Fig. 3,2.9. The temperoture of the
test system was maintained at 1500°F for each
of the tests, one of which was for a period of
100 hr and the other for 500 hr. Metallographic
examination of the specimens after the test re-
vealed thot o two-phase diffusion zone hed formed
between the specimens in the 100-hr test, whereas
a three-phase diffusion zone formed in the 500-hr
fest.

The examination of the specimens from the
100-hr test showed that the diffusion layer adjacent
to the beryllium specimen was the intermetallic
compound MoBe ;. This layer, which was 1 mil

K162B:  64% TiC—6% NbTaTiC,~25% Ni-5% Mo.

The specimens were retained in the hot zenes of
the capsuvles during the test, The surfoces of oll
four cermets were roughened to depth of 0.5 mil,
but the K1528 and K162B specimens appeared
tc be the most severely attacked. The ottack
in each case may have been on on Ni-TiC solid
solution along the TiC-binder interface, since
it appeared that the metal binder had been removed
and that the TiC grains were slightly reduced
in size. The typical appearance of the attack
is shown in Fig. 3.2.11. Chemical onalyses of
the sodium baths after the tests showed erratic
scatter of the results from less than 15 te approxi-
mately 60 ppm of fitanium or nickel in 20-g

BORON CARBIDE AND BORON NITRIDE IN
MOLTEN S50DIUM

W. H. Cook

The ceramics baron carbide ond boron nifride
are of interest as refroctory materiels for use
in reactors as thermal-neutron obsorbers, In
recent stondard screening fests of ceramics in
liquid metals, two boron corbide specimens,
with theoreticol densities of 85 and 90%, re-
spectively, had better corrosion resistance to
molten sodium than that previously observed.®

Each of the B,C specimens was exposed to
static  sodium for 100 % at 1500°F in Inconel
containers. 1he results of these tests are com-
pared with o result of an earlier test in Table
3,23, Since it is difficult to completely remove
sodium and sodivm compounds from a porous
ceramic body, 1t is surprising that the calculated

and measured specimen weight losses given in
Table 3.2.3 agree so well. The results calculated
from the chemical onalyses are considered to
be the most important in determining the extent
of corrosion. The only visible changes in the
tested specimens were that they both had duller
surfaces than they had before the tests. The
8,C of 100% theoretical density, which was
tested previously,g cracked and fell aport after
exposure to sodium.

A specimen of boron nitride {nominally, ]{1 % ]a:'

(theoretical density of BN = 2.20 g/cm® was
severely attacked in o 100-hr exposure to malten
sodium in a seesaw furnace operating ot | cpm
with hot- ond cold-zone temperatures of 1500
ond 115(PF, respectively. The specimen container
was [nconel.

The measured weight loss of the specimen was
10.8%, ond the weight loss based on chemical
analyses of the sodium after the test wos 8.2%
if all the boron found was in the form of BN before
the test. Since the BN was extremely soft even
in the dense state, some of the weight loss could
have been due to atirition between the specimen
and its container. However, metallographic exomi-
nation with reflected light showed thot the as-
tested specimen hod develoeped crocks below
and paralle!l to its surfoces. Under polarized
light, the specimen appeared to have cltered
throughout.  There was o dense, shell-like ma-
terial approximately 0.003 in. thick surrounding
the core of the specimen. This ““shell’’ contained
the cracks observed with the reflected light. The
core of the specimen oppeared to be less dense
than it was before the test and to be covered
with black spots.

The resuvlts of this test were consistent with
previous resulis obtoined in o static test of o
different type of SiC-Si matericl!? ond in similar
tests of pure silicon ond silicon-containing alloys.
The nature and rapid rgte of the silicon removal
in these tests indicate thot the silicon was
ottacked ond that perhaps the ottack was assisted
by concentration-gradient moss tronsfer. These
data appear to disagree with reporfsw that sodium
does not react with silicon.

The lead-lithium spectrometer housing proposed
for use in the BSF is to be poured at approximately
400°PC ond ollowed 1o solidify slowly. Therefore
a test was conducted to determine whether gross
segregation would occur in the alloy if the housing
were fabricated in this manner. The test was
conducted by filling a !ﬁ-in.-OD, 30-in.-long Armco
iron capsule with lead-lithium alloy to o height
of 24 in. The copsule was held in o verticol
position, heated for 4 hr ot 400°C, and allowed
to cool in the furnace. Samples of the alloy were
taken from various locations in the copsule
and analyzed for lithium content. The analyses
showed the lithium contents at the top and bottom
of the column to be about the some, 0.73 and
0.70 wt %, but a sample from the center showed
an abnormally high lithium content, 0.94%. An-
other fest is planned in which the capsule will
be ciimped ot varicus places along its length
in order fo isolate one section from another while
In this monner it can

Considerable work on the development and
improvement of onalytical techniques for deter-
mining the nitrogen, oxygen, and corbon contents
of lithium wos performed ot NDA in fiscal year
1956 and has been continued into fiscal vyear
1957. The thermoi-convection loop design was
standardized so that ORNL and NDA test results
covld be correlated. A lithium still has been in
operation at NDA for several months, ond oll
tests are performed with the high-purity material
{less than 20 ppm of N,) produced in this still,

Among the most significant results obtained
to date are indications that titanium end zi¢conium
are benefical in increasing the time required for
type 316 stuainless steel Joops (hot leg, 1600°F;
cold leg, T1100°F) to plug with moss-transfer
crystals. Loops containing titaniuvm and zirconium
operated for approximately 500 hr, whereas standard

loops with no additions plugged in roughly 100 he.

Cold tropping of the lithium by means of g
positive-flow cold trap to reduce the impurity
content shows promise of incregsing the time
required for stainless steel loops to plug. Three
recently operated loops of type 316 stainless
steel, fabricated from an ORNMNL design {hot and
cold legs 30 in. long, horizontal connecting legs
18 in. long), plugged with mass-transfer crystals in
95 £ 25 hr. The results of the tests will be used
as base-line data for future tests in which attempts
will be made to study the effect on mass transfer
aof nitrogen, oxygen, titonium, zirconium, and
sositive-flow cold traps. No solution rate data
have been obtained to date, but tests have been

NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM ALLOY DEYELOPMENT

H. Inouye T. K. Roche

General $tatus of Development Program

The progrom for developing nickel-molybdenum
alloy container materials for fluoride fuels that
have better heat transfer properties than those of
lnconel was continued during this quorter, The
mosi favorable characteristics of the new alioys in
comparison with [nconel are their superior corrosion
resistonce and strength. The corrosion resistance
of nearly every one of the new alloys tested in
NoF -KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel
107) was equivalent to that of Hastelloy B, and the
average stress-rupture life at 1500°F and a stress
of 8000 psi was about 400 hr, which is better than
that of Inconel by a factor of 4. These properties
were attained without seriously offecting the
fabricability, ond the new alloys do not become
brittle during aging or welding.

In terms of reactor performance, it appears that
the nickel-motybdenum alioys will permit the use
of o more efficient fuel than that planned for use in
the ART and probably an increase of 150°F over
tie ART operating temperature.  Consequently,
every effort is being made to translate laboratory
dato into commercial practice. With this objective,
the effort is being concentrated on one or two
promising compositions that are to be made in
ptlot-plont quantities at the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation plant ot Blairsville,

The properties of the alloys that have been

Pennsylvenia.

prepared in the faboratery are summorized below:

Fabricability., — The fabricability of the nickel-
molybdenum alloy depends on the guantities of
other elements that must be added to provide the
necessary strength, The indications are that the
fabricability will be between that of Inconel and
that of Hastelloy B.

Corrosion Resistance, — The corrosion resistance
of the new atloys in fuel 107 and in sodium at
metal temperatures of 1650°F is equivalent to that
of Hastelloy B when the criterion is the depth of
corrosion. A more sensitive indication of corrosion
susceptibility is the chenge in the chemical compo-
sition of the fuel as a result of contact with the
indicaoted that

alloy. The corresion tests hove

chromium, aluminum, ond tungsten should be held
to a minimum in the new alloys.

Stress-Rupture Properties, — The stress-rupture
data show that, in most coses, the new alloys fall
short of the goal of o rupture life of 1000 hr at
8000 psi and o temperature of 1500°F; however,
the considerable scotter of the data prevents
accurate strength estimates, The average creep
and stress-rupture properties of the various compo-
sitions tested to date are plotted in Fig. 3.3.1.
Since dota from atl the alloys tested were gveraged,
it is expected that the composition selected for
further development will have properties somewhat
better than those shown in Fig. 3.1.1.

Joining Characteristics. — The weldability of
these olloys has not been determined as fully as
desired. Hot ductility tests on some of the olloys
indicate that titanium and oluminum are undesirable,
as ore nicbivm and fungsten when used in con-
junction with a high carbon content. Similerly, for
dry-hydrogen brazing the alloys should contain o
minimum of aluminum and titanium,

Oxidation Resistance, — The oxidation rote of
nearly every composition has been determined to be
tolerable in that over 60 thermal-convection loops
have been operated in air without failures of-
tributable to oxidation. The metal temperature
attained in these tests was approximately 1850°F
for periods of up to 1000 hr. The alloys that showed
the most oxidation contained tungsten ond niobium,

Aging Characteristics. — The stability of each
alloy wos determined by observing the changes in
tensile strength, stress-rupture properties, and
hardngss after agingat 1300°F, The agingresponse
was significant in compositions that contained 0.25%
Be or 2.0% Al + 1.5% Ti. Aslightresponse to aging
was observed for olloys containing 1.0% Al + 1.5%
Ti.

Praperties of Alloy INOR-8

It appears at this time that the alloy INOR-8,
which has as its basis the Ni-Me-Cr-Fe system,
will offer the best compromise for meeting the
requirements of a container material for fused
fluorides, In order to investigate the mechanical
properties developed in alloys in this system, as
well as the mechanical property trends that resuit
from changes in the total alley content, the tensile
and stress-rupture properties of a series of alloys,
included within the composition limits described
below, are being determined:

Cighteen compositions, approximotely 315 ib
eoch, were melted vunder vacvum and cast in
graphite, Aluminum, mangonese, ond carbon were
odded to eoch chorge, primarily for deoxidation of
the melt. Each ingot was rolled to 0.065-in.-thick
strip from which twe 1l-in,-long creep specimens
were prepared. The remainder of the material was
rolled to 0.040-in.-thick strip from which die-cut
tensile specimens will be blanked.

Stress-rupture data were obtained for six of the
alloys in the solution-anneoled condition ot a

182

stress of 10,000 psi and a temperature of 1500°F
in argon. The results are presented in Tabte 3.3.9.
Although the stress-rupture properties do not follow
the anticipated trends, the alloys are stronger than
lnconel ot this stress level and approach the
strength of type 316 stainless steel,

A Torced-circulation loop is to be fabricoted from
an INOR-8 alioy centaining 17% Mo-10% Cr-7%
Fe-0.06% C-bol Ni in which NeF-KF-LiF-UF,
{(11.2-41.45.3-2,.5 mole %, fuel 107) will be circu-
lated, Therefore two 3.5-ib ingots with the same
nominal compoesition, alloys VT-51 and VT-52, were
cast for preparing stress-rupture specimens for
testing in fuel 107, One melt, VT-51, was prepared
from elemental stock, and the other, VT-52, from
Inconel diluted with Ni, Me, and Fe., Actual
onalyses of these two aloys showed the molybde-
num content to be approximately 19.5%; however,
the composition is still brocketed by the limits
described for the study of the INOR-8 alloy system,
Both these olloys had 1000-hr rupture strengths of
8000 psi ot 1500°F in fuel 107. Metollogrophic
studies of alloys VT-51, VT-43 (10% Mo-5% Cr~4%
Fe-0.06% C-bal Ni), ond VT-49 (15% Mo-7%
Cr—4% Fe-0.06% C-~bal Ni) indicated that ¥T-5]
responded to aging ot 1300 end 1500°F and thus
nad higher strength than alloys VT-43 and V7-49,
which did not show this gross aging response. It
therefore appears that higher sirengths can be
achieved in the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe system by raising the
quantities of the elements added to the nickel.

Properties of Alloy INOR-9

Compositions designated INOR-9 are prepared by
adding Nb, V, or Fe plus C to the besic Ni-Mo
compos ition. Certain elements, namely, Cr, Al, Ti,
and ¥, are excluded because of their corrosion
tendencies in fuel 107. Previous studies of the
oxidation choracteristics of nickel-molybdenum
clloys showed that stable oxide scales were formed
when the molybdenum content was lower than 15%.
The strengths of the solid-solution alloys of nickel
ond molybdeaum show strong dependence on the
molybdenum content, and thus support is given to
the theory that solid-solution strengthening is
dependent upon the extent of alloying.! {n order to
maintain the molybdenum level as low as possible
for oxidation resistance and yet to have the highly
olloyed composition needed for strength, niobium
additions are being made to the nickel-molybdenum
base alloy, The compositions which exhibit mexi-
mum solid solubility ore being determined, and their
oxidation characteristics in the tamperature range
of interest are being studied. For practical reasons
the alleys contain iren, which is derived from the
ferroniobium melting stock, The compesitiens and
the properties of the alloys being studied ore given

in Table 3.3.10.

Fabrication of ORNL Experimental Alays

Three experimental compositions were extruded
to tube blanks which are presently being processed
into seamless tubing at the Superior Tube Co. for
fobrication of ferced-circulation loops which will
be operated with fuvel 107. Six tube blonks of each
composition were fobricoted, without difficulty,
at o temperature of 2150°F and an extrusion rotio
of 7:1. The compositions which have been ex-
truded are described in Taohle 3.3.11. la view of
the time delay anticipated in the fabrication of
tubing frem the INOR-8 alloys, two laboratory heats
of the composition 15% Mo-6% Cr-5% Fe-0.5%
Mn=0.5% Al-0.06% C-=hal Ni were cast, and suf-

The present status of the phase diagram studies
being performed ot the University of Tennessee
Subcontract 582 is summorized here. A
previous report® described the studies of nickel-
base alloys containing 20 to 30% molybdenum, In
this work, metallogrophic and x-ray examinations,
hardness tests, ond other techniques are being
used to establish phase relationships and charac-
teristic phase transformations which relate to the
mechanical properties of nickel-rich alioys con-

under

tairing molybdenum ond molybdenum plus chromium,

[n the binary system, Ni-Mo, the three secondary
phases previously reported in the literature were
identified, although only the crystal structure of
the beta phase was confirmed. The temperctures
ot which the beta and goamma phases decompose on
heating were found to be higher than those reported
in recent literature and ore at present being con-
sidered to be 868 and opproximotely 925°C, re-
spectively. A simple ordering mechanism for the
formation of the beta phase from the alpho phase
wos worked out that yielded o structure from which
the observed x-roy dota could be derived., Pre-
cipitation of beta ond gamme material from the
alpha phase increased the hardness of the alloy to
450 DPH, with little if ony decreose in hardness
ofter aging for periods of up to 2000 hr.

Nickel-rich nickel-molybdenur alfloys with ad-
ditiens of chromium in the range of 4 to 14% were

of chromium seem to permit an increase in the total
solubility. Additions ot chromium quickly restrict
the formation of beta material, and systems that
precipitate gomma ond then delto phases develop.
There is evidence of an additional phase in the
higher-chromium-content alleys which has not vyet
been identifiad.

Alloy Development at Battelle Memoriel Institute

Work on the nickel-molybdenum alloy development
program being conducted by Battelle Memorial
Institute under Subcontract 979 continued along the
lines described previously.*® ORNL has assisted
Battelle in their program by determining the stress-
rupture properties of selected olloys in the fuel
mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, {11,2-41.45,3-2.5 mole
%, fuel 107) and by extruding numerous tube blonks
of their alloys for corrosion evaluation, From the
tubing successfully fabricated to dote, ORNL has
operated thermal-convection loops with both fuel
107 and sodium. Emphosis is now being ploced on
the fabricotion of tube blanks of alloys selected
for forced-circulation loop tests with fuel 107 to be
performed at Battelle,

Four tube blanks of each of the Rattelle olloys
B-3404, B-3407, B-3412, and B-3418, described
previously,® were extruded and sent to the Superior
Tube Co. for redrawing to small-diameter tubing.
However, all the blanks failed on the tube reducer
and thus substantiated eorlier evidence that atloys
with 0.12% carbon are not amenable to tube-reducing
operations. At the recommendotion of Superior Tube
Co., Battelle hos discorded the high-corbon heats
and has melted alloys with a lower carbon level,
The compositions of the new olloys are listed in
Table 3.3.14. Bottelie has prepared o sufficient
number of extrusion billets of these alloys for
fabricating the necessory tubing to operate a total
of 16 forced-circulotion loops with fuel 107, but

FABRICATION OF COMPOSITE TUBING AT
SUPERIOR TUBE co.’

T. K. Roche

The corrosion resistance of the nickel-molybde-
num alloys to attack by sodium is about equal to
that of Inconel. Thus it appears that temperoture-
gradient mass transfer is an inherent characteristic

H. Inouye

of nickel-base alloys and thot it increcses in
severity with increasing temperatures. Since the
nickel-molybdenum olloys cre being developed for
use at higher temperatures than those contemplated
for luconel, the use of composite tubing may be
desirable or even mandatory.

The fabrication of composite tubing by coextrusion
has been shown experimentally to be entirely
feasible.® On the bosis of this experimentol work
a considerable quantity of duplex tubing was pre-
pared by commercial practice ot the Internctional
Nickel Compony ond the Superior Tube Co. without
apparent difficulty, In this production run, 9-in.-dia
compos ite billets were coextruded 1o produce 3-in.-
0D tuke sheils having o wall thickness composed
of 60% Inconel over 40% type 316 stainless steel,
The tube shells were tube-reduced to 2-in.-QD,
0.187-in.-wall tubing by the Intemational Nickel
Company and then tube-reduced again ond redrawn
to small-diameter tubing by the Superior Tube Co.
An evalustion of tuhing thus produced is presented
in Tables 3.3.16 ond 3.3.17. The results clearly
indicate that layer thicknesses can be held to
within 2% of those intended, and that, in general,

SHIELD PLUGS FOR ART PUMPS
J. P. Page

Two full-sized gamma-ray shielding plugs for
ART f{uel pumps were prepared. The plugs are
composed of 75 wt % tungsten carbide and 25 wt %
Hastelloy C. The first plug was hot pressed in o
large horizontal press, and the die material was
CS-312 graphite rather than the AGHT-grade previ-
ously used, The die fractured ot about 1800 psi
and coused loteral expansion of the pressed plug
and the die parts.

A verticel hot-pressing facility was adapted for
pressing the second plug, and o die identical to
the first one wos used. Even though the pressure
was limited to 1600 psi, this die olso failed at the
end of the pressing cycle, and some lateral ex-
pansion occurred. However, the pressed plug had @
vniform density of 12,1 g/cm®,

These plugs will be surface ground on one end
face and used for brazing and thermal-shock tests.
A new graphite die has been designed and ordered
for which the dimensions ore such thot the hot-
pressed plugwill require lirtle or no grinding on the
inner or outer surfaces. This die was made some-
whot stronger by increasing the outside diameter
and eliminating the sight hole.

The realization of the great potential improve-

has shown that certain metals, notably zirconium
and yttrium, are able to abserb and retain large
quantities of hydrogen at high temperatures ond yet
retain their metallic characteristics, However, at
the temperature of interest for advanced reactors,
over 2000°F, yttrium is the only material known at

this time which offers promise of being satisfactery.

Capsule for In-Pile Tests

An octive research and development program on
hydrided metals was initiated, with one of the
first projects being fabrication of the capsule
shown in Fig. 3.3.8 for in-pile tests. The speci-
men consists of hydrided zirconium (NH = 3.5)

HEAT EXCHANGER FABRICATION
ART Sodiumsto-NaK Heat Exchangers
G, M, Slaughter

Brazing procedures are being developed for use
in the fobrication of ART sodium-to-NeK heat
exchangers by the Griscom-Ryssell Co. Ex-
amination of a variety of tube-to-header samples
from several brazing experiments performed at the
Griscom-Russell Co. has revealed inconsisient
fiow and fitleting. A typical example of this
condition on o tube-to-heoder joint is shown in
Fig., 3.4.1.

Attempts have been mode ot ORNL to duplicate
the difficulties experienced by the vendor and then
to alleviate them by suitable variotions in brazing
procedure.  For the initial tests, the vendor's
heating rate of approximately 100°F/hr was used.
Samples taken from a typicol test assembly before
and ofter brazing ot this rote of temperature rise
are shown in Figs. 3.4.2 ond 3.4.3, The influence
of the following variobles was studied in these
tests: (1) type of Coast Metals brazing alloy
Ne., 52 ring (ORNL cast ring vs York Corp. sintered
ring), {2) differences in Inconel base material
(ORNL headers vs Griscom-Russell headers),
(3) angle of countersink in headers, and (4) direct
impingement of hydrogen on samples vs slight
baffling. Mo significant differences in braozing
were noted os o result of these vorionces.

An analysis of all the experimental results

complished ot 1920°F if oll variables such as
hydrogen purificotion, hydrogen flow rate, material
cleanliness, etc, are corefully controlled. How-
ever, only minor deviations from the optimum
conditions may result in inconsistent brazing at o
100°F /hr rate of temperature rise,

Additional experiments were then conducted at
200°F/hr and ot J00°F/hr rates of tempercture
rise, As con be seen in Figs. 3.4.4 ond 3.4.5,
samples brazed at 300°F/hr had satisfactory
fillets on all joints. With the faster heating rates,
it appeared that brozing could be conducted under
slightly reloxed conditions with a reasonable
assuronce of success. The 300°F/he heating rate,
which should be readily atteinable with most
industrial equipment, provides a high degree of
assurance of successful brazing,

Investigation of Rapid Heating Cycles

E. A. Franco-Ferreira

Tests were run to investigate the feasibility of
vsing very short heating cycles (of the order of
5 min) for the back brozing of heat-exchanger
tube-to-tube sheet joints, The experimental
procedure consisted essentially in heating the
welded side of a small Inconel tube sheet whiie
providing a vocuum or an inert atmosphere for
protection on the opposite side, which was to be
brazed. The heat source used in the experiments
was a salt-bath furnace.

It is felt that certoin advantages might occrue
from this method of brazing, such as minimization
of grain growth in the tubes and reduction of
fube-wall dilution, while avoiding distortion and
the jigging problems associated with conventionol
furnoce brazing of entire ossemblies. One of the
experimental configurations is shown in Figs.
3.4.6 and 3.4.7. A section through a typical jeint
brazed by this method is shown in Fig. 3.4.8.

This method of brazing is not limited fo the use
of g salt-bath furnace as a heat source. It is felt
thot high-energy radiant heat sources based on
surface combustion units could also be used to
advantoge. Although the experiments described
above were prelimincry, the resulis do indicate the
feasibility of using rapid heating cycles for some
high-temperature heat exchanger brazing operations.

ART FILL-AND-DRAIN TANK FABRICATION
G. M, Slayghter

A study of the problems associoted with the
fabrication of the ART fill-and-drain tank is under
way. Specifically, tests are being run to establish
welding and brazing procedures for the tube-to-tube
sheet joints in the tank heads. As a result of the
high degree of restraint exerted by the 1 lé-in.-fhick
tube sheet, tube-to-tube sheet welds made with the
standard fusion procedure used for thin fube sheets
consistently exhibited root cracking of the type
illustrated in Fig, 2.4.2. The direct oim of the
welding investigations has been to arrive at o

E. A. France-Ferreira

welding procedure which "will produce joints free
of such root cracks. A promising joint design
currently being investigated is o trepanned type,
an example of which is shown in Fig. 3.4.1C.

Brozing experiments ore also under way to
determine the proper amount of preplaced brazing
alloy, the type of preplacement procedures, and a
suitable brazing cycle. In the initiel experiments,
the Coost Metals brozing alley Ne. 52 was preplaced
in the form of rings, two per tube, as shown in
Fig. 3.4.11. A photogroph of a typical as-brozed
test sample is shown in Fig. 3.4.12.

The optimum procedures for welding ond brazing
have not yet been determined. Varicus modifi-
cations in technique are to be studied in subse-
quent experiments.

WELDING AND BRAZING
OF NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM ALLQYS

R. E. Cleusing
Studies of Hostelloy B and W Welds

Preliminary results of an investigation of the
mechanical properties of Hostelloy B and W welds
on '{,!-in. plate were reported previously.d Further
tests were conducted, and the results of all the
0.252-in.-dia tensile-specimen test data obtcined
are presented in Tables 3.4.2 through 3.4.7.

An onalysis of the tensile test data indicotes
that the following generol conclusions moy be
drawn:

1. Hastelloy B welds have good ductility in the
as-welded condition when tested at room temper-
ature  but poor ductility ot 1500°F. In the
transverse weld tests, the specimens tested at
room temperature failed in the weld, while those
tested at 1500°F failed in the base metal. In
aged specimens lested at 1450°F, the failure wos
again in the weld material.

Rep. Dec. 31, 1956, ORNL-2221, p 22).

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 1957

2. Hastelloy B welds oged 200 hr at 1300°F ol!
failed, with poor ductility, in both the all-weld-
metol and tronsverse-weld specimens. |In the
latter, the failure occurred in the weld metal ot
room temperature and in the fusion line ot 1300°F.
The transverse specimens showed lower ductility
than the all-weld-metal specimens tested ynder the
some conditions.

3. Hastelloy B welds aged 200 hr ot 1500°F
showed a slight increase in strength and decrease
in ductility compared with the as-welded condition
specimens tested at room temperature. However,
at 1500°F the ductility of the aged specimens was
better than that of the as-welded specimens ot
1500°F,

4. Hastelloy W oll-weld-metal specimens show
strengths about the same as those of similar
Bostelloy B specimens and acceptable ductilities
(greater then 10% elongation} in all but two speci-
mens. Aging for 200 hr ot 1300 and 1500°F re-
sulted in considerable loss of ductility,

5. Hastelloy W is notch-sensitive at 1300°F.

6. Failures in Hastelloy W weldments exhibit a
tendency to occur ot the interface between the
weld and the base metel,

7. Hostelloy W weld metal appears to be stronger
and less ductile than the base metal.

8. Weldments of Hestelloy B plate with Hastelioy
W welding wire showed a morked tendency to fail
ot gage morks in the bose meial or ot weld defects,
No opparent advantage is gained by using this
filler wire instead of Hastelloy B filler metal.

?. Vocuum-melted Hastelloy B welding wire has
essenfiolly the some characteristics as those of
commercially availoble Hastelloy 8 wire.

Welding and Braxing Studies of Experimental
Nickel-Molybdenum Allays

The lé-in. plate required for welding studies of
some of the nickel-molybdenum experimental
alloys was received and tests were initiated to
determing the welding ond brazing choracteristics
of these moteriols. The test specimens were
prepored by the methods described previously.3
The observations made in the tests thus faor are
presented in Table 3.4.8. Since alloys INOR-7
and -8 are currently of maximum interest, it is
encoyraging to note that ne cracking tendencies
were found in these tests. Tensile data for other
promising clloys will be reported as they become
ovailable,

cedures described in the literature?+ on experi-
mental ond commerciol nickel-base alloys. The
results ore presented in Figs. 3.4.13, 3.4.14, and

The results of the tests indicate that it is
vsually sufficient to evaluate the hot ductility os

in terms of the percentage reduction in

measured at 2300°F during cooling from some
elevated temperoture ond to compore these dato
with the hot ductility measured at 2300°F during
heating. The experience thus far indicates that
testing at 2300°F during cooling from a peak
temperature corresponding to the point where the
ductility during heating closely approximates
zero provides the best method of testing, The
level of impairment of ductility during cooling
which can be tolerated is probably dependent on
the conditions of restraint ossociated with the
actual welding operotion. However, materiels of
known propensity for cracking have all exhibited
ductility during cooling of less than 40% of the
ductility during heating under the test conditions.
Comgporisons of the test results indicate that

Assistance to Yendors

Assistance was given to the York Corp. in the
solution of difficulties in the fabrication of the
high-conductivity-fin NaK-to-air radiators, It wos
recommended thot the retort be boffled to obtain
more positive circulation of hydrogen, porticularly
through the fin bank, during the brozing operations.
The size of the retoct should be held to a minimum
1o lessen channeling of the gos flow and to reduce
the total mass. Very siringent cleaning ard
storage procedures should be followed throughout
the fabrication process. It was suggested thoi the
ossembled fin banks be ploced in airtight con-
tainers before brozing. The fins should be de-
greased immediately prior to assembly. A rate of
temperature rise of greater than 300°F/hr (prefer-
ably 400 to 800°F/hr) should be used through
the temperature range of 1700 to 1900°F. Further
experimentation should be corried cut with sintered
brazing alloy rings in order to study the influence
of processing voriables on the brazing character-
istics, ond experiments with rings produced by
other methods, including ORNL cast rings, should
be continved, The use of mico as a nonwetting
support material wos discouraged. It wos sug-
gested that alumina be used becaouse of its known
inertness.,

STUDIES QF GRAIN GROWTH IN

E. J, Wilsen G. M. Slaughter

The interest in maintaining @ fine-groined
strycture in the |nconel tubing used for reactor heat
exchanger ond radiotor components has led to a
preliminory study of the groin growth that results
from various brazing and heat-treating operations.
The initicl results of this study indicated thot
stress-relief treatments at 1500°F did not result in
grein growth, while significant grain growth re-
suvited from I,i-'nr brazing cycles at approximately
1922°F. It was also noted that growth proceeded
more ropidly in the graing locoted olong the outer
wall of the tube than in those located along the
inner wall,

Since high-temperature back-brazing is required
in the fabricotion of meny components, a more
detailed study was undertaken to defermine the
influence of the different variables on the grain
growth choracteristics of the tubing. The infor-
mation obtoined from an onolysis and evaluation of
growth behavior will be useful in determining the
optimum procedures for fobricating the warious
components,
Influence of Brazing Temperature

Two different lots of CX-900 Inconel tubing were
used for an investigation of the effect of the
brazing temperoture on groin growth, These lots
of tubing were identified as heat 5759 {0.187 in. OD,
0,025 in. woll) and heot 5789 (0.229 in, OD, 0.025
in. wall). One-inch segments from ecch lot were
cleaned with ocetone and subjecied to various
brazing temperatures for 30 min in dry hydrogen,
After the heat treatment the samples were sectioned
and examined in both the transverse and the
longitudinal direction.
structures of the heat-treoted specimens of 0.187-
in.-0D tubing are presented in Fig. 3.4.16 in the
order of increasing brozing temperatures., Although
wide warigtions in grain size occurred along the

Photomicrographs of the

outer peripheries of the tubes, the photomicrographs
shown are typical of the oreos thot experienced
extensive radial grain growth. After the 30-min
hect treatment ot temperctures os low as 1814°F
oend up to and including 1904°F, the grain growth
wos found predominantly in the grains along the
outer surface of the tube. The fine-grained
structure ¢long the inner surfoce appeared to be
relatively stable. After heating at 1922°F and
above, general grain growth wos evident, that is,
grains along both the inner and outer surfaces
had grown to significont proportions and many of
those which originated on the outer surface had
grown completely across the tube wall. As would
be expected, the frequency of large grains in-
creased with increasing tempercture,

The trends observed in these tests are illustrated
in Fig. 3.4.17, in which the grain size is plotied
as a function of temperature for both the outer and
the imner tube surfaces. The grain dimensions
selected for plotting were representative of the
grain sizes in areas that exhibited definite grain-
coarsening tendencies., At the higher temperatures
the curves reflect the coexistence of lorge and
small grains in the tube wall, For exomple, the
tube heated ot 1922°F for 30 min had grains that
penetrated radially from the outside surfoce com-
pletaly through the tube wall, but there were
adjacent arecs thot contcined smaller grains.

Infiuence of Time at Temperature

It was felt that the time at temperature might
also be an important facter in grain growth, and

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 1957

therefore a study was initiated in which both time
and temperature were varied. For these experi-
ments, 0.187-in.-0D, 0.025-in.-wall CX-900 Inconel
tubing from heat 5759 was cleoned with acetone
and sectioned into 1-in. segments, which were then
heat treated at various temperotures for vorious

times. The heat-reated segments were then
sectioned in the transverse and longitudinal
directions for grain-size determinations. Photo-

micrographs of the structures of the heat-treated
specimens are shown in Fig. 3.4.18. As may be
seen the lowest temperature employed (1848°F)
and the 5- and 10-min time intervals produced no
appreciable grain growth along the outer periphery,
The specimens held at 1868°F for 30 min, however,
showed sporadic grain coarsening ot the outer
periphery. More extensive grain coorsening oc-
in the specimen held at temperature for
1 hr, as was expected. After 5 and 10 min ot
1904°F, no grain growth was observed, but ofter
30 min at this temperoture, some growth was

curred

evident. After 1 hr, groins occasionally penetrated
completely through the tube wall, and the inner
surface grains also had grown.

In the tests at 1922°F outer periphery groin
growth bhecame quite noticeable after 5 min at
temperature. Since it hod been estoblished previ-
ously thot excessive grain growth would occur in
30 min at 1922°F, no further experiments were
conducted.

Influence of Tube-Straightening and
Tube-Polishing Operations

A group of experiments was conducted to study
tube-straightening and tube-
polishing operations on grain growth in CX-900
lnconel tubing. Since these operations impose a
smoll degree of cold deformation on the tubing, it
was desirable to determine whether this cold work
was o major confributor tfo the ocuter-surface grain
growth noted upon hecting ot high temperatures,
Samples of 0.187-in.-0D and 0.229-in.-0OD tubing
were obtained in the following conditions: {1) an-
nealed, (2) anneoled and straightened, and (3} an-
nealed, straightened, and polished. The somples
were then examined os-received, of subjected fo @
brazing cycle of 30 min at 1868°F and examined,
or subjected to a brazing cycle of 2 hr at 1922°F
and examined. The specimens were cut transversely
and mounted for microscopic examination,

The objective of this program is the development
of techniques for producing ductile weldments.
Carbon-deoxidized arc-cast material was used.
Welds were made with a shielded tungsten electrode
both in o dry box end in the open otmoesphere ond
were tested by o single-point-loaded bend test ot
room temperature and at 75°C. In oddition to
studying the effect of ctmosphere purity, vorious
etching and abrasion techniques were employed
in preporing the surfaces, and several types of
shields were used in welding the samples in the
open otmosphere.

The series of samples prepored by wvorious
cleaning techniques were welded in o dry box,
They showed that acid etching resulted in welds
with somewhat better ductility than those prepared
by other metheds. They exhibited bend angles at
fracture of 40 deg at room temperoture and 76 deg
ot 75°C compared with average bend angles of
28 and 62 deg, respectively, for other samples.
For weldments prepared in air, the samples welded
with a trailing shield showed significantly better
ductility than all other samples,

DYMAMIC STRAIN PROPERTIES OF INCONEL
C. R. Kennedy'

The study of the effect of thermally induced
strain cycles on the rupture life of Inconel was
continued, Two types of tests are being made,
including relaxotion tests and mechanically in-
duced strain-cycling tests. Stress relaxation data
are necessary for determining the octual amounts
of plastic strain that occur under operating con-
ditions; whereas, strain-cycling data can be utilized
in determining the life expectancy of structural
members subjected to strain reversals, Although
the majority of the strain-cycling problems are
cavsed by thermal fluctuations, tests in which the
specimen is mechonically strained under isothermal
conditions give a definite insight to the effects of
thermally induced strain cycles.

Relaxation tests of Inconel onnealed ot 2050°F
for 2 hr were completed at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F,
and the results are presented in Figs. 3.5.1, 3.5.2,
and 3.5.3. The tests were run at total strains of
0.05, 0.1, and 0.2% at 1300°F and of 0.05 and 0.1%
ot 1500 and 1650°F, One specimen was used af
each temperoture to determine the relaxation rates
for all strains, The procedure was to run four
successive 100-hr tests with 0,05% total strain and
then run the tests with higher total strains. This
was done to determine the effect on the relaxation
rates of prior strain at the test temperature. It was
tound that the prior strain only slightly offected the
relexation properties of annealed Inconel tested ot
1300°F, as shown in Fig. 3.5.1. It may also be
seen that, ot ¢ll temperotures, when the total strain
is greater than 0.05%, which is the strain of the
proportional limit for coarse-grained Inconel at
these test temperatures, the relaxation rate is the
same as that of the 0.05% total strain test. Since

at these test temperatures strein hardening is
small and recovery occurs rapidly, it follows that
the plastic strain given the specimen on loading to
totel strains greater than the elastic limit has neo
effect on the relaxction rate of the material.
However, at temperatures less than 1300°F, this
may not be the case, ond the motericl may reflect
the effects of strain hardening in its relaxation
rate.

The strain-cycling equipment described pre-
viou5|y2 was in operation during the quarter ond
preliminary results were obtained ot a test tempera-
ture of 1500°F. The greatest number of tests were
run with red specimens in two conditions, os-
received ond annealed at 2050°F for 2 hr, The
test results are shown in Fig. 3.5.4, in which the
log of the plastic strein (€.) per cycle is plotted
vs the log of the number ofpcycles to failure. The
procedure of operation hos been to apply o load
which is of a magnitude that will cause the specimen

to experience ¢ specified plastic strain in 1 min
and then to reverse the load to produce the same
plastic strain in the opposite direction. The
plastic strain vs time wave has the shope shown
on Fig. 3.5.4. It moy be seen thot the coorse-
grained specimens (annealed at 2050°F for 2 hr)
exhibit fewer cycles to failure for all values of
€ . Metallographic examination of the specimens
showed that the failures were intergranular and
that they initiated at the surface of both the
coarse- and fhe fine-grained materiol,

Tests were also run at 1500°F on 0.75in.-0OD,
0.C6-in.-wall Inconel pipe both in the as-received
and the annealed (1950°F for 2 hr) conditions. As
may be seen in Fig. 3.5.5 there is some scatter of
the deto; however, all but three points fall within
the band brocketed by the coarse- and fine-grained
rad data,

Tests of Inconel pipe in the fused solt NaF-

temperature levels. Thus an odditional delay will
be incurred before dota of sufficient accuracy
become ovailable to attempt o correlation with the

A program wos initioted ot Battelle Memorial
Institute on July 1, 1956 1o fully explore the
slevated-temperature properties of Inconel under
dynomic-stress conditions. The progrom entails
complete reverse stress fatigue tests and fatigue
tests with various constant load stresses applied
in the tensile direction. Such information, together

with stress-rupture dato, con be used to form

“Goodman’’® diagrams.  From these plots the
stress conditions that will result in failure by
¢creep can be estoblished, ond the stress conditions
that will result in failure from fatigue con be
determined. Since the primary interest is in low-
frequency stress reversals, the tests be
conducted at 1 and 10 cps, Preliminary results
show that, ot o temperature of 1400°F, opplication
of constant load stresses up to 4000 psi will not
significantly alter the stress to produce a fatigue
failure in 1000 hr. Data arg to be obtained for

diagroms for 1200 ond 1600°F.

ALLOY DEVELOPMENT
J. W. Woods

Evaluation studies were mode of the creep and
creep-rupture characteristics under a constant load
of two experimental nickel-molybdenum alloys
being developed for reactor use. The environment
used in these tests was the fused salt NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, {11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107). The
two olloys tested were vacuum melted ot ORNL.
Heat ¥T-5) had the nominal composition {(in wt %)

and heat YT-52 contoined (in wt %) 17 Mo-10
Cr-0.08 C-7 Fe—bal Ni. The results of the tests
are presented in Table 3.5.1. The corrosion of the
unstressed surfaces of the specimens from both

220

heats thot were solution annealed at 2000°F for |
hr and aged at 1300°F for 50 hr was 0.5 to 1 mil.

The compositions of the two alloys were virtuclly
identical, but the methods of preporation were
different. Heot VT-51 was prepared from elemental
melting stock, and heat YT-52 was prepared from
Inconel diluted with Ni, Mo, and Fe. Alloy VT-5I
demonstrated an aging response, while alloy VT-52
did net, Becouse the alloys were prepared in
small heats, veriations in mechanical properties of
of the two alloys were to be expected. Both alloys
exhibited good ductility.

carbide precipitote in the grain boundories has a
more random arrangement which could account for
the lower strength exhibited by clloy VT-52, In
general the precipitates were well dispersed in
both specimens.

Hostelloy B hos received considerable attention
in the olloy development program because it is
commerciclly ovailable and it has excellent high-
temperature strength and corrosion resistance.
However, the absence of chromium in Hastelloy B
results in characteristically poor oxidation re
sistonce. One aim of the development program,
therefore, is to introduce sufficient chromium to
provide good oxidation resistonce but not encugh
to result in severe corrosion. Hastelloy C, which
is also o commercially availeble nickel-molybdenum
alloy, centains 15 wt % chromium. |t was recognized
that this amount of chromium would lead to con-
siderable corrosive attock, but, since the composi-
tion of this alioy represents an upper limit of

222

chromium, it was decided that o certain amouynt of
data on its strength properties in fused salts would
be pertinent to the problem., Therefore, stress-
rupture data were obtoined ot 1300, 1500, and
1650°F in fuel 107 for comparison with dota for
other alloys being investigated.

The results of the tests are shown in Fig. 3.5.8.
The dato show quite good stress-rupture properties,
and it oappears that for 1G,000 psi ot 1500°F
Hostelloy C witl have a rupture life of over 1000
hr. The two specimens tested at 1500°F in
Hostelloy B creep test chambers had poorer stress-
rupture properties thon those tested in a Hastelley
C test chamber. This may be explained by the
fact that the creep test chamber made of Hastelloy
B contained no chromium and thus provided,
through alloying and diffusion, a strong ""sink”’ for
chromium and accelerated the removal of chromium
from the specimen.
- The results of the alloy development program
thus far indicote that considerable progress has
been mode toward ochieving the objective of de-
veloping a material that is as fabricable as required
reactor  constryuction, possesses adequate
strength, oand is corrosion resistant in high-
temperature fuel mixtures, liquid metals, and air.
Commercial alloys such as Hastelloys B ond W,
which have excellent corrosion resistonce and

for

PERICD ENDING MARCH 31, 1957

strength, will have to be avcided, since, ot the
temperotures of interest, they precipitate a brittle
phase that causes poor fabricability and low
ductility. Experimentol nickel-maolybdenum alloys
of the single-phase or solid-solution type have the
desired fabricability and corrosion resistance, but
they lack adequate creep strength. In spite of the
poorer creep strength, however, these alloys are

stronger than Inconel.

Attempts have been made to increase the strength
of the nickel-molybdenum alloys by the addition of
elements that form complex precipitotes and by the
addition of elements that are simple corbide
formers. Additions of very small amounts (< 1%)
of aluminum and titenium do not seem to increase
the strength, but they do increase the final elonga-

such a5 niobium and tungsten, os wes done in the
case of Hastelloy C, without seriously compromising
the other good characteristics. Several clloys of
this type have exhibited a stress-rupture life of
1000 hr when tested in fuel 107 ot 8000 psi and
1500°F. A considercble amount of odditionol
work is needed to achieve the optimum bolance of
strength, fabricobility, and corrosion resistance,
but the success te date encourages optimism.

TESTING OF BERYLLIUM
D. A. Douglas

The Brush Beryllium Co., under a subcontract,
has for several years been conducting an ex-
tensive program of mechanicol testing of beryllium

224

to explore the effects of variables such as tempera-
ture, surface finish, strain rote, and oxide content
on the mechanical properties. Most of the work
was summarized in o report issued in August 1956.4
In the current contractuol year the work has heen
concerned with measuring the elevated-temperoture
tensile and stress-rupture propeities of samples
trepanned from the blocks being hot-pressed for
the ART. It wos felt desirable to determine
whether the lineor relationship between oxide
content and strength revealed by the past work
would be evidenced in the larger pressings. Also,
some evaluation of the blocks is required to ensure
that the strength does not fall significantly below
the strength on which design calculations were
based. The results of the tests, as reported in
The Brush Beryllium Co. quarterly progress re-
ports,>*® indicate that the strength properties do
not vary appreciably from those predicted,

The application of the recently developed Im-

the a-c resistance and the reactance of its testing
coil over a wide range of frequencies, was in-
vestigated further. A prototype of this instrument,
described by the block diagram in Fig. 3.6.1, was
constructed. It is composed primerily of ean
oscillator in which the bifilar-wound center-topped
testing coil is the frequency-determining element.
Both the a-c resistance of the coil and its in-
ductance cre influenced by the tubing under in-
spection. The amplitude of the clternating voltage
generated by the oscillator varies inversely with
the resistance of the testing coil, and the frequency
of the voltage vories inversely with the square
root of the inductance of the testing coil. The

centage of the outside diometes) for (/] ratios
of 9, 16, 25, ond 100, The long-dashed curves
indicate the effect of varying the outside diameter.

It is important to note that if the proper f/fc
ratio is selected for o particular tube, angular
separation of approximately 90 deg can be obtained
between the effects of wvorying diameter and
varying wall thickness. An example of this sit-
vation occurs at an f/f_ ratio of 25 for a tube
hoving o wall thickness which is 10% of its
outside diameter.

Both the R and X components of any excursion
from the operating point are measured by the
Impedograph. These 1wo components moy be
resclved into any other set of two orthagonal
components by the use of resolving bridges, as
indicated in Fig. 3.6.). Thus the controls may
be odjusted until one channel of the instrument
responds primarily to voriations in diometer and
the other to voriations in wall thickness. Small
defects on the inner wall of the tubing cause
impedance excursions thot are nearly in phase
with those from wall thickness variations, and
small defects on the outer surface cause excursions
that are neorly in phase with those from diameter
variations. Therefere, small inside defects will
appear on the some channel with the woll thickness
variations, and small outside defects will appear

226

on the same channel| with the diameter variations.
Gross defects cause very large impedance ex-
cursions which ore ot some angle between the
effects of diameter and woll thickness; thus the
large resultant signal is present on both channels.

Iflustrotions of the instrument's obility fo dis-
tinguish between diameter and wall thickness
variations are given in Figs. 3.6.3 and 3.6.4.

Cladding Thickness Measurements
J. W. Allen R. A. Nonce

The feasibility of determining the thickness of
the cladding on Mark X MTR fuel plates with ¢n
eddy-current probe coil was investigoted. Although
this study hos no immediate application to ANF
work, many of the problems involved are very
similor to problems associated with inspections
of contrel rods ond other clad or shrouded os-
semblies.

The Mark X MTR fuel plates ore composed of
g 0.022-in. nominal thickness core of 52 wt % Al-
48 wt % U alloy cled with o 0.020-in. nominal
thickness of type 8061 aluminum alloy. The defor-
mation choracteristics of the core and the cladding

PERICD ENDING MARCH 21, 1957

alloy are not the same; hence, during the rolling of
the plate to a wniform thickness, the deformation of
the core is frequently nonuniform. The result
is a thick section at eoch end of the core, the
longitudinal cross section of which resembles a
Ydog bone.”” Since the plote is of uniform thick-
ness, the cladding over the thick sections at the
extremities of the core is of course much thinner
than the 0.020-in. nomingl thickness. The pos-
sibility of a 0.003- to 0.005-in. depth of corrosion
attack necessitates the location and rejection of
fuel plates which have excessive ‘‘dog boning.”

To facilitate the investigation of this problem
and to determine the best operating parameters
for the eddy-current test, the prototype instrument
described in the block diagram of Fig. 3.6.5 was
constructed. Since the original purpose of this
instrument was to determine the best coil design
ond the optimum operating frequency, it is more
complex and contains more controls than would
be required on a production inspection instrument.

The instrument consists of o voriable-frequency
oscillator which supplies alternating current to
the probe coil through an isolating network and
to a bolancing network. The isclating network
prevents the presence of the probe coil from
affecting the voltage supplied to the balancing
circuitry, and supplies the probe coil with current
of constant amplitude. Since the probe coil current
is constant in amplitude, the voltage at the
terminals of the probe is directly related to iis
impedoace, which in turn is influenced by the
metal specimen in proximity with it. The baloncing
network is adjusted monually until the voltage
at the netwerk output terminal is equel to the
voltage across the coil, ot the initial test con-
dition, in both amplitude and phase. Any chonge
of the test condition chonges the voltage ot the
coil in phuse or amplitude or both. The difference
in the voltage of the ccil and of the belancing
network is amplified, and hence any change in
coil voltage causes o meter deflection.

After some experimenting, the probe design
shown in Fig. 3.6.5 was established. The coil
consists of approximately 540 turns of No. 40
enameled copper wire in a small, cup-shaped
Ferrocube core (Ferrocube Corp. Type 3C Ferro-
cube).  The coil, ofter conncction with the in-
strument coble, is potted with en epoxy resin into
the end of a short length of micarta tubing. This
coil ossembly is contcined in o heavy brass

the frequency was to be sufficiently high to
sensitively detect the difference between the
type 6061 aluminum alloy cladding {conductivity =
45% IACS?) and the uranivm-aluminum alloy core
(conductivity = 22.8% |ACS). Second, it was to
be sufficiently low to penetrate the nominal 0.020-

in its thickness. Also, it was to be sufficiently
high that the 0,022-in.-thick core underneath the
0.020-in.-thick cladding would appear infinitely
thick (that is, no eddy-current penetration through
the core). This is necessory to prevent the clad
thickness on the ‘'back side' of the plate from
influencing the thickness determinaticns made
on the side under surveillonce. The optimum
frequency determined experimentally to satisfy
these conditions was 20 ke.

Correlation of the meter deflection with the
cladding thickness was experimentally determined
by first adjusting the instrument to read nearly

of bare uwronium-aluminum core, and to reod zero
with the probe coil placed on an apparent *infinite"’
thickness of the 6061 oluminum alloy. Shims of
the clodding alloy, which varied from 0.003 to
0.020 in. in thickness, were then used to obtain
the information for the colibrotion curve shown
i Fig. 3.6.6.

Three Mark X fuel plates were examined, and
only one showed sufficient variation in cladding
thickness to warrant a more detailed inspection.
This plote was scanned on both sides, with gach
pass of the probe coil overlapping the previcus
pass 1o ensure complate coverage of the surfoce.
The greater portion of the cladding was indicated
to be from 0.017 to 0.020 in. thick. AIl deviations
from this range were marked for loter destructive

mentioned.  Section | was taken through the
the thickest portion of cladding, while section 2
was tcken through the thinnest portion of ¢ladding,
excluding the very thin clodding over the ends of
the core.

The results of the metcllographic measurements
are summarized in Table 3.6.1 and shown in Fig.

one side of the plate only. The meosurements
for section | were made on the side of the plate
with the thickest cladding, while the remoining
sections were meosured on the side with the
thinnest cladding. It should be noted that in aoll
cases where the metallograghic measurement differs
from the eddy-current measuremens, the difference
is 0,001 in. below the value obtained by the eddy-
current technique. It is therefore concluded that
upon choosing the optimum operating porameters,
the cladding thickness on Mark X MTR fuel plates
can be determined to within £0.001 in.with the
use of an eddy-current probe coil.

There is no comprehensive theory for the ap-
plication of eddy-current probe coils on metal
surfaces such as the theory which exists for
the use of coils encircling rods or tubes. This
lack of theoretical background requires that eoch
problem be considered separately ond that general
statements regarding the capabilities of the probe-
coil technique be corefully qualified. The ex-
perience gained in the measurement of the cladding

230

thickness of the Mark X fuel plates indicates
that if the two metals, forming a system, have a
ratioc of conductivities in the order of 2:1 or
the thickness of the accessible layer
can be accurately measured. As the conductivities
of the two materials approach the same value,
this system of measurement becomes useless.
Continved experience with the eddy-current
probe-coil technique should resuit in the satis-
factory measurement of cladding thickness of
most alloys on o cermet core, of any of the oxi-
dation-resistant alloys over malybdenum or nichium
cores, of an oustenitic stainless steel over o
nickel-molybdenum alloy core, or of a nickel-
molykdenum alloy over an austenitic stainless
sieel core. The obility of this method to measure

Incenel on austenetic stainless steel or austenetic
stainless steel on Inconel is currently considered
to be marginal,

The eddy-current probe-coil method of meosuring
independent of the existence or
condition of the bond between the two layers,
and it is best suvited to the measurement of thin
layers. This method cppears to be well adopted
to measuring clodding thicknesses on solid-fuel-
element ossemblies or on moderater assemblies.
It is wiso well adapted to measuring the thickness

be used in future heat exchangers and radigtors,
provided the conductivities of the two layers are

ness of the duplex tubing and condition of the
bond bketween the two loyers can be evaluated
by vlirasonic techniques.

RADIOGRAPHIC INSPECTION TECHNIQUES
R. B. Oliver W. J. Mason

The voltage ond current settings required for
rodiographic inspection of various thicknesses of
Inconel, stainless steel, nickel-molybdenum, and
similar alloys are not available, and therefore o
program of compilotion of such doto hos been
initiated. Test weldments in ]'é-in. Inconel sheet
are being radiographed through 8-in. of beryllium
to explore technigues for the inspection of the
closure welds of the ART fuel-arnuius core shells.
Beryllium, an element of low atomic number,
causes excessive scatter of the incident x-ray.
The scotter reduces image contrast and shorpness
so excessively thet the rodiograph is not capoble

of revealing any but gross defects. Higher x-ray
energies are being explored, but the reduction of
image contrast with increasing energy appears
to nearly offset any reduction of scattered photons
that might be expected.

Shortly after the Pratt & Whitney high-temperature
critical assembly was looded with barren fuel-
carrier salt, o leak wos detected in the sump tank.
The insulation was removed and the source of
the jeckoge was found to be severe cracks in the
&-in.-dia cap which had been welded to the botfom
of the tank as o catch basin. Since such cracking
is wunusval for lnconel forged fittings, it was
surmised that the cap hod been machined from
bar stock. A ceall to Prott & Whitney confirmed

that forged pipe caps were not immediately avail-
able and that o cap machined from bar stock had
been used. The cop was removed ond ¢ forged
cop was welded to the tank.

Examination of Caolrods attoched to the tank
revealed thot they were glazed with salt-vaper
deposits, and therefore all bottom and side Calrods

and new Calrods were installed.

Visual examination of the faulty cap showed
nine separate cracks which penetrated through
the cop. Examples of the cracks are shown in
Figs. 3.6.8 and 3.6.9, which cre outer and inner

respectively, of the same crocks.
As moy be seen the cracks run to the weld and

less time was required to realign the incident
beam. Another aid in increesing the inspection
rate is the use of the B-scan, which displays the
signal received as on instantaneous cross section
through the plate being inspected. This permits
an increase in linear speed of the transducer from
approximately 10 to 25 fpm.

In general, it appears that for plate of overage
quality, inspected from either face, the inspection
rate will be about 10 2 per shift., This of course
allows for all the downtime necessary for sefup
and may increase or decrease with plate quality;
also, an increase in the inspection rote might be
expected with larger areas.

The rate of rejection increased slightly during
the quorter, ond three prime criteric for rejection
were established: (1) the detection of a dis-
continuity which produces @ signal comparable
to or greater than that from a stondard 4{‘_4-{:1.
flot-bottem hole; (2) the presence of smaller dis-
continuities with their centers nearer than 1 ia.
to each other; and (3) excessive ulfrasonic atten-
uation, which may be due fo porosiiy or precipitates
within the plate.

Beryllium Hot Pressings

R. W. McClung R. B. Oliver J. W. Allen

One of the six, large, beryllium hot-pressings
fobricated by The Brush Beryllium Co., Clevelund,
Ohie, was vultrasonically inspected at ORNL,
Previcusly, three of these items had been in-
spected at the producer’s plant. However, it was
felt that ¢ more methodical, complete ultrasonic
examination under laboratory coaditions by several
different techniques (some of which could not be
used at the Brush facility} was needed as o check
on techniques which were previously used tn the
field.

The instrument used for the inspection at ORNL
was a Curtiss-Wright 424A Immerscope with o
%—in.-diu Li 50, high-resolution trensducer. An
attenuation curve was plotted which demonstrates
the comparotive signal strength os received from
a constant-gsize discontinuity when seen through
varying thicknesses of beryllium, Fig. 3.6.14,
The instrument was calibrated for all the in-
spections by using a ]zé—in. flot-bottom hole and

relative size of any defect could be approximoted
by comporing its signal with that of the standard
ond by using the atienvotion curve. The general
shape of a hot-pressed beryllium piece is shown
in Fig. 3.6.15; however, the contours aond di-
mensions varied from piece to piece.

The section denoted A was inspected completely
by three different pulse-echo ultrasonic techniques.
The first was a simple immersed method in which
the hot pressing wos completely immersed in o
tank of water and the surface was scanned in o
linear fashion with o E*é-in. index between suc-
cessive scans. Three small discontinuities were
located which were estimated to be less than the
rejectable size. For the second inspection the
column-coupled, gimbal-mounted mechanism? illus-
trated in Fig. 3.6.16 wos used. Section A wos
sconned in o series of overlapping circulor scans;
however, the part wos still completely immersed
and this technique merely gave comparative in-
formation. The inspection results were identical
with those obtained by the conventional immersed
technique. For the third inspection the gimbel
mounting, the circuler sean, and also the column-

coupled ‘‘squirter’’ principle were used. More

The sloping section, B, wos inspected with the

so that the refrocted uliresound beom was per-

shown in Fig. 4.1.6. Unfortunately the high-flux end
of the capsule {the end closest to the reactor during
irradiafion}) was bent slightly while it was being
removed from the bracket surrounding it, but the
BeO slugs were not domaged. Dicmeter measure-
ments were mode on the con before the BeO slugs
were removed, and the results of these measure-
ments ore listed in Toble 4.1.1, The meosurements

Apparotus for Stress-Rupture Tests of Tubing
in the MTR

Effort has been concentrated recently on com-
pleting apparatus for MTR in-pile tests of the
stress-rupture properties of Inconei tubing, Diffi-

culty was encountered in the ossembly of the

apporatus in that the pure helium atmosphere be-
came c¢ontaminated by insulating and constructional
materials, and the assembly work during the final
stages was necessarily slow because the size
and complexity of the apporatus limited the number
of people who could work at one time,

The general design of the apporatus was described
previously,? and the nearly assembled specimen
chamber, a sample specimen, and a specimen fur-
nace are shown in Fig. 4.1.15. An end plate and a
water jacket will be welded on in order to complete
the specimen chamber. Water and boral will be
used as shielding in the plug. Each specimen is
a section of 3.8-in, sched-40 Inconel pipe machined
down to o wall thickness of 0.030 to 0.030 in,
over the gage length, and each specimen is pro-
vided with three thermocouples for temperature
A Hﬁ—in.-OD capillary
will supply gas pressure (to supply the stress) to
each specimen,.

Each of the eight specimen furnaces has three
windings. A rheostat in series with each of

measurement or control.

the 24 seperate furnace windings permits separate
control, Three recorder-controllers {Speedomax
“G" air controilers with pneumatically driven
Variacs) control the temperature in three zones
corresponding to the front end (the end closest to
the reoctor), the middle, and the back end of the
specimen, This system is necessary becouse of
the gamma-ray heoting gradient ia the MTR. The
only alternative would have been the use of 24
controilers or 8 controllers and a system of furnace
shunts thot would be contrelled by recctor power.
The leod $ime on procurement of the exira con-
trollers that would hove been needed was too long,
and it appears now that the present system moy be
the most suitable,

Extensive tests to determine why the Inconel wos
heavily cxidized in out-of-pile stress-rupture tests
in similar apparatus, despite the use of a high-
purity helium atmosphere, showed that some of the
materials of comrstruction were contributing oxygen
or other contominants to the atmosphere. Lavite,
a machinoble ceramic, was eliminated from the
ossembly as the worst offender. The fused quartz
sleeving was found to require special thermal
treatment to rid it of disturbing impurities, Therme-
couple wires with glass insulation were also
suspect, and accardingly all electrical leads and

thermocouples were provided with ceramic insula-
tion. Approximately 50 thermocouples and 35 power
leads (copper} were insulated with a total length
of 12 # of ceramic insulation,

Four racks of power and thermocouple instrumen-
tation and the connecting cables were completed,
and an ovailoble safety circuit was adapted for
use with this apparatus, A rack of helium pressure
control circuits, including 8 pressure recorders to
monitor specimen pressures (ond thus stresses),
was designed, built, and leak tested.

Duplicate specimens are to be tested out-of-pile
at stresses of 2000, 3000, ond 4000 psi ot 1500°F,
The in-pile apparotus will probably be installed

Tube-Burst Tests in the LITR

Two tube-burst stress-rupture tests of Inconel
tubing in a helium atmosphere were completed in

the L_ITR. The thermal and fast > 1 Mev) neutron
Huxes in hole HB-3 where these tests were con-
ducted are both on the order of 6 x 10'% q/cm2.5ec,
Rupture times for the 0.010-in.-wall lnconel tubing
(ART stock) ot 2000 psi and 1500°F were 1050 and
1650 hr ond thus were in good agreement with out-
of-pile data obtained in on argon atmosphers,”
The specimens in corresponding out-of-pile tests
in @ helium atmosphere have passed 1770 hr with-
out rupture, A third in-pile specimen, stressed to
1000 psi ot 1500°F, did not rupture ia 1670 hr,
and the total creep deformation will be measured
upon disassembly of the apparotus,

An unstressed Inconel tube was exposed in the
LITR (HB-3} with nitrogen inside to determine
whether radiction-induced nitriding would occur,
This specimen was also in a temperature gradient

stressed in bending at o maximum stress of 1000 psi
ot 1500°F for 1120 hr so0 that a range of tension

Corrosion on the fuel side was negligible and did
not appear to depend on the sign or magnitude of
the stress; only scottered subsurtace voids to a
depth of 1 to 2 mils were observed. On the sodium
side, attack to a depth of about 3 mils was found.
There were voids at and immediately below the
surface, but deeper intfo the wall there were holes
in the metal that appeared to be filled with a new
constituent, as yet unidentified,

A tube-burst rig is being built for LITR tests of

Inconel Capsules

Irradiation tests in the MTR of Inconel capsules
filled with NaF-Z¢F -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %,
fuel 44) were continued. Further difficulties of
the type described previously® were encountered
becovse of damage te facilities by the turbulent
cooling woter of the MTR. Some improvement of
the conditien was obtained through the use of
better installation techniques. No design changes
of the capsules or the focilities were made, but it
ts expected that a change to all-stainless-steel
construction of the irradiation facility may be
necessary,

Two irradioted and two contral capsules were
opened and analyzed metcllograghically, and fuel
samples were submitted for chemical analysis.
The operational histaries and the results of metallo-
graphic analyses’ of the capsules are given in
Table 4.1.3. In this series of tests only two
copsules, Nos, 247 and 248, constituted a matched
pair, that is, an irrodiated capsuvle end an identical
heat treated but not irradioted capsule. As may be
seen in Figs. 4.1.16 ond 4.1.17, the attack was
of about the same intensiry in both capsules, The
depth of penetration was so minute, however, in
both coses, that it may be confused with surface
foults and perhops can be considered to be negli-
gible.

Capsule 276 showed (Fig. 4.1.18) corrosive
attack and subsurface voids to a depth of 5 mils.
The area of maximum penetration was near the
mid-point of the capsule, and the distribution of
the atteck tapered slightly toward the ends. This
distribution of the attack wos anticipated on the
basis of the temperature profile of the capsule.
The appearance of the affected areas in this cap-
sule indicates that the corrosion attack is real
ond considerable; however, the contribution by
irradiation control

cannet be ascertained until

data and chemical analyses of the fuel are avail-
able., Copsule 264 (Fig. 4.1.19) will be compared
with its irradiated counterpart in a latter report,

The excellent temperature conirol achieved with
the capsule control system at the MTR is indicated
in Table 4.1.3. Capsule 247 experienced only one
temperature excursion, which was 32°F above the
set point for less than 1 min in an operating pericd
of 676 hr through 16 reactor shutdowns, Capsule
276 was operated for 235 hr with ne excursions
greater than 10°F above the set point,

Other methods of apelying nickel and chromium
coatings are being studied in an attempt to improve
the yield of successful coatings. Depositian of
nickel coatings by the 'electroless’’ method
oppedars to be promising, A nickel salt is reduced
by sodium hypophosphite and deposited on the
surface of the metcl to be cocted. The metal
surfece does not enter into the reaction. Nickel
deposited by this method is uniform in thickness
on all surfaces, and the plate is reported to be
relatively nonporaus.'® This method is superior
to electrodeposition in that articles of irregular
shape receive uniform deposits,

plated,'! It is difficult to plate artizles of irregulor

is anticipated that vacuum metelizing will over-
come this difficulty. Vacuum metclized coatings
are also expected to have no entrapped liquids,
as might be the cose with an electroplate, and
thus a large percentage of the coated specimens
should survive high-temperature exposure to air,

Tests specimens of Hastelloy B have been nickel
olated by electrodeposition and then chromium
plated by wacvum metalizing, Other specimens
have been nickel plated by the "‘electrofess’
method ond then
metalizing. These specimens were then heated to
815°C in a muffle furnace and coocled to room
temperature daily to study the characteristics of
the oxide film, The preliminory results are promis-
ing, and work is continuing.

culating fused-salt fuel in the vertical in-pile loop,
which was started in an out-of-pile test loap during

pairs to the cooling coils which had been over-
heated when o water main broke and interrupted
the water supply. The pump could not be restorted,
presumably because the overheating had demaged
the bearings,

The pump wos therefore cut open for examination
and is shown in Figs. 4.1.22, 4.1.23, and 4.1.24.

INVESTIGATION OF SULFUR CONTAMINATION
OF A DRY BOX BY NECPRENE RUBBER

W. E. Browning
F‘Ei E. AdGmS Ho Lt Hemphi”

During preparations for filling the vertical in-pile
loop, it wos discovered that, while under vocuum,
the interior of the dry box was contaminated by an
unknown gaseous sulfur compound., The presence
of the contaminant was monifested by the appear-
ance of a Cu,5 film on the copper-cooling coils of
the loop ossembly. The Cu,5 film wos identified
by chemtcal analysis ond x-ray diffraction.

The wvaricus lubricants and oils vsed in the
vacyum system and loop assembly were therefore
analyzed for sulfur, and the concentrations of the
sulfur found renged from less than 10 to 92 ppm.
These quantities are to be expected in pump oils
and lubricants, Tests of the foop assembly elimi-
nated it as ¢ source of the sulfur contaminant,
The helium supply was also investigated for sulfur
contamination by bubbling the helium through o
silver nitrate solution, Mo evidence of a silver
sulfide precipitote was noted,

Access to the interior of the dry box is provided
by Meaprene rubber gloves. A glove and a copper

specimen were enclosed in a vacuum system inde-
pendent of the dry box, and after several hours
under vacuum Cu,5 wos found on the copper
surfaces, This indicated thot the sulfur contami-
nant was present in the Neoprene rubber and was
Sulfur is not used in
Neoprene as the wvulconizing ogent, but orgonic
sulfides are used as a plasticizing agent.

nated dry-box atmosphere, Simifar semples were
removed from another moter assembly which had an
identical history except for exposure in the dry
box, These surface samples were removed by the
lacquer-stripping technique used in preparing rep-
licas for electron microscopy. The samples were
found to be identical, and crystalline sulfides of
nickel, iron, and chromium that were sought were
nat found.

A small sample of fluoride fuel was exposed over-
night to the contaminated dry-box atmosphere and
then analyzed for sutfur ciong with o control sample
of unexposed fuel,
tent was found to be below the limit of medsure-
ment {20 ppm S5) of the onalytical method being
used., Since the loop surfoces and the fluoride
fuel revealed no sulfur contamination, the filling
operation was completed and the loop was removed
from the dry box,

In the case described the quantity of sulfur com-
pounds present was not considered to be harmful,
but elimination of contominents would be desirable,
and various methods cre being studied. The ovail-
able sulfur content of the gloves might be removed
by chemical treatment without changing the physical
characteristics of the gloves, and, although difi-
cult, the Neoprene gloves might be replaced with
gloves of another suitable material.

FUSED SALT POLAROGRAFPHY

R. J, Carter

The applicability of polarographic technigues to
the study of the fission-product chemistry of fused
salts is being investigated, The polarogroph which
is being vused is similar to that used in aquecus

260

poforography; however, the hich electrical con-
ductivity of the fused salts as compared with
aquecus sclutions mokes it impractical fo wvary
the potential applied to the polarogrophic cell
linearly with time, For this reason, current-veltage
curves are recorded with on X-Y recorder rather
then with a conventional strip-chart recorder,

Both silver and platinum microelectrodes of
various sizes and shapes ore being tested for use
as cathodes. The platinum crucible which contains
the fused salf is used as the anode. The platinum
crucible is mounted in an Inconel contoiner which
can be filled with helium in order to maintain a dry,
inert atmosphere around the fused salt, The neces-
sary electrical connections are made by using
Kovar seols which are soldered into the lnconel
can, VYertical movement of the microelectrode is
accomplished by mounting the electrode support
on o fexible bellows,

In order to test the equipment, current-voltage
curves were obtained at 350°C for severol solu-
tions containing from 6.4 to 1,0 parts per thousand
of cadmium chloride dissolved in potessivm nitrate.
Five or six current-voltage curves were obtained
for each scolution, The reproducibility of the
curves was good in the initial portions but poor in
the diffusion-current region, where large fluctua-
tions in current were cbserved., The fluctuction of
the diffusion current has since been found to be
caused by vibration of the laboratory floor, and a
suitable meons for shock mounting of the furnace
used to heat the fused salt is presently being
sought,

This sample, which had on original corrier con-
centration of 3 x 104 carriers/cm?, was irradiated
until it became intrinsic,

Initially, very slight irrodiation produced large
changes in the hole lifetime. Since the initial
lifetime was 1010 psec, it can be seen from Fig,
4.1,35 thot the hole lifatime changed by about a
factor of 5 for a dose of 101! fast neutrons/cm?,
which produced a change in carrier concenfration
of only 0.1%, The plot of hole lifetime vs fast-
neutron dose in Fig., 4.1.35 shows a simple power
dependency, but the stroight line produced does
not have o slope of unity, but rather 0.7,

indication of the initial carrier concentration or the
initial mobility. Thus there is no reason to expect
that the moximum observed previously?® would
occur of the same integroted exposure for a different
type of unit,

Upon removal from the gamma-ray source, the
change in I, indicated that an annealing process
was taking place in the barrier. As con be seen
from Fig. 4.1.38, recovery of the unit was not
complete, ond the onnealing was not o simple

to be the leakage conductance. The chonge in i,

increase of about one order of magnitude. This

ray source, shown in Fig, 4.1.40, is complicated,
as it was in the case of /. A definite minimum
can be seen at cbout 40 hr, The fact that annealing

sary for reliable interpretation of the effects will

A Safe for Removal of Samples from the Reactor

The removal of samples from the ORNL Graphite
Reactor subjects the personnel engaged in the work
to beta ond gomma irradiation from the octivated
material being removed and to contamination by
the radicactive dust associated with the decay of
insulation.  This problem is particularly acute
when samples must be removed from the reoctor
loading face, As a first step in solution of this
problem, o sample removal sofe was designed,
Fig. 4.1.43, The sofe can be handled by two men,
and vyet it is thick enough to provide odequote
shielding for the levels of activity normally en-
countered. All access facilities can be operated
by one men., The device can be used either at the
reactor loading face, or, by transterring to another
dolly, at holes 50, 51, and 52. Provision hos been
made Sor vacuum removal of rudicociive dust ond
particles through numerous access ports.

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 1937

Modifications to Hole 30 of the ORNL
Graphite Reactor

In order for measurements fo be made con semi-
conductor components under irradiation, the ex-
posures must be conducted at flux levels one to
two orders of magnitude lower than those found in
the central region of the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
Unless such low flux levels are used, the measure-
ments cannot be made in o time interval that is
short compored with the fime interval which pro-
duces @ significant chonge in the parameters being
measured.

If exposures are conducted in hole 51, where q
fission spectrum, o removal focility, and provisions
for instrumentation are available, the reactor must
be operated at power levels between 50 and 400 kw,
The time available for such operation is limited
and the reproducibility of flux levels s difficult.
Exposure near the periphery of the reactor couses
a positioning problem and provides an undesiroble
ratia of thermal to fast flux,

In order to eliminate these disadvantages and to
supply several advantageous features, an exposure
device has been designed for use in hole 30N of
the Graphite Reactor, as shown in Fig, 4.1.44, The
device consists of a cart which may be moved from
a loading shield at the reactor shield foce to a
fission chamber locoted inside hole 30N, The sam-
ple can be moved from the external shield to the
irradiation position in about 10 sec.

The fission chamber position may be adjusted to
give a range of flux levels. The external shield is
designed to facilitate removal of the fission
chamber should such action become necessary.
The sample moy be instelled ond removed without
breaking the electricel connections. This will
make possible continuous readings from the pre-
exposure to the postexposure periods.

greatest change occurred at 800 mc, There was
evidence of this frequency dependency in the
teactor-irradiated specimens discussed above. On
the basis of the change in attenuation observed??
in polyethylene cable measured ar 4 mc and the
results shown in Fig. 4.1.45, it seems ciear that
the loss tangent of irradiated polyethylene has o
maximum in the frequency range between 4 and
800 mc. Such a maximum probably exists also for
Teflon. Measurements in this frequency range are
needed to substantiate these conclusions.

Any chonges in the dielectric constants of the
five materials studied are less than the error of
measurement, Since the limit of accuracy of the
present mecsurements of dielectric constants is
5%, changes smaller than this volue would not be
observed, In the cose of Teflon there is a con-
sistent trend in the data which suggests that o
change in dielectric constant may occur,

The molten-sait handling equipment was tested,
and the stainless steel vessel for melting the

melts were prepared, the salt outlet of the vessel
plugged. The stainless steel vessel will be
replaced with a nickel vesset. The remainder
of the molten-salt system {fluorinator, waste can
and carrier, avtoresistance heated lines, and
freeze valves) handled the molten salt in a manner
which will be acceptable for operations.

Heating- ond cocling-cycle studies were started
on the MNaF cbsorbers and on the cold traps.
Resuits of the first tests indicate that the heating
time for the absorbers as designed may be ex-
cessive and that neither the 5-in. K-25 cold trap
nor the &-in. ORNL.designed cold trap will reach
design temperature. Further studies are in progress
in order to determine the modificotions and op-
erating techniques necessary for satisfactory
operation.

SULFUR EMBRITTLEMENT OF NICKEL

The embrittlement of nickel and of high-nickel-
content alloys by sulfur was investigated chem-
ically and metallurgically to determine the
importance of the effect in volotility processing.
Experiments with fused salts to which known
amounts of sulfur were added showed that nickel
foil is sensitive to sulfur concentrations as low
at 5 ppm.  Under ordinary conditions, however,
in equipment with heavy nickel walls, a sulfur
concentration of 200 1o 500 ppm is necessary
to produce severe embrittlement. The sulfur effect
is cumulotive, as indicated in o -consultation
with an Internationsl Nickel Company repre-
sentotive, | ond there is danger of sulfur buildup

in fused-salt treatment vessels os a result of
processing many batches with small sulfur contents.
Evidence has been obtained, however, that the
sulfur content of the fused salt can be reduced
to a harmless level by one exposure to nickel
equipment. The mechanical effect of sulfur em-
brittlement wos found to be much less on lnconel
than on nickel.

Metallurgical examinations were mode of spec-

RUTHENIUM DECONTAMINATION

M. R. Bennett . |. Cathers

An experiment was conducted to fest whether
the plating out of ruthenium on metal surfaces
could be used to achieve odditional decontam-
ination in the wolatility process. The column
used for the experiment consisted of a 12-in.
length of 1-in.-0OD nickel tubing fitled with 192 g
of %z-in.«OD 30-gage nickel Fenske packing
with o total area of 0.36 m?. This column was

celd trap and was held at 120°C. It was vused

not particularly effective in removing activity
from the UF, product coliected. The decontam-
inaticn factor, calculated on the basis of the
activities found in the nicke! column ond in the
final product, was only 1.6. The activity in the
nickel packing was removed with an alkaline-
tartrate-péroxide solution, and the effectiveness
of this method has not been fully evaluated. About
0.025% of the processed uronivm was found in
the nickel trap.

The low ruthenium decontamination in the nickel
trap is perhaps not too surprising in view of the
small amount of activity involved and the small
surface area used. The product contoined only
28 ruthenium gamma counts per minute per mil-
ligram of vrantum. The activity removed by the
nickel was calculated to be 200 counts per minute
per square centimeter of nickel surface. It is
anticipated that the removal of ruthenium with
a nickel ¢olumn moy be made more effective by
using a greafer surface area or by operating at
a higher temperature.

The measurements of some of the nuclear charac-

were completed. The ossembly consisted of o
cylindrical beryllium central section or ‘‘island"”
surrounded by an anaular fuel region, which was
enclosed in o reflector of beryllium. Shells of
Hastelloy X separated the fuel from the beryllium,
Control and safety of the experiment were effected
by a rod which could be positioned along the axis
of the island. The neuvtron-acbsorbing section of
the rod c¢ontoined a mixture of 30% rare-earth
oxides (somarium ond gadolinium) and 70% nickel.
The reoctor section of the assembly, which was
described in detail in an earlier report,? was
mounted, with its oxis vertical, above o sank in
which the molten mixture of sodium, zirconium,
and uranium flyorides was stored. The liquid
could be roised into the reactor by pressurized
helium. The equipment was operated ot tempera-

tures neor 1250°F.

ln  the experimental procedure followed, the
system was first filled with NaoF-ZrF, (50-50
mele %) to which increments of NGF‘UF“ {66.7-
33.3 mole %, contoining uranium enriched to
93.2% U23%) were added until the system became
criticol. The concentration was further increased
stepwise as the control rod was inserted to the
midplane. The value of the rod over the upper hal
of its travel (Fig. 5.1.1} was determined from
period measurements and the inhour equation. The
temperature coefficient of reactivity over the range
1200 te 1350°F was linear, within the precision of
the medasurements.

S, Auslender! A. T, Futterer'

Some of the calculations of gamma-ray shield
penetration thot were performed with the use of an
Oracle cede based on Monte Corle techniques have
been published at intervals? during the past year.
A topicel report is now being prepored which will
describe the Oracle code used for these calcula-
tions.2 In addition, the results of all the colcula-
tions are being collected in o separate repert con-
sisting of several volumes.? Since the results are
especially opplicoble to the ANP program, o
summary of the various types of problems is pre-
sented here, along with corresponding references
to the data.

The summary {(Table 5.2.1} designates the ma-
terials, thicknesses, gamma-ray energies, and
ongles of incidence investigated. For oll the
problems the information obrained directly fram the
machine calculetions includes dose rate, energy
flux, and energy deposition; for some problems it
olso includes energy spectra. Dose- oand energy-

Ancther calculation, designated the FAB series,
was performed to determine the effect of the extent
of lamination in a shield consisting of a total of
16 ¢m of water and 4 cm of lead. The materials
were subdivided and alternated {2 to 16 regions) to
mock up the progression toward a homogenecus

In another group of problems, the DO2C5S series,
the effect of chonging the relotive amounts of lead
ond water in a two-region shield that had o con-
stant mean free path thickness was investigated.
In this case no transmitted or reflected energy

a doubling technique was used which tends to
maintain an even populotion throughout the shield.
In this way statistics were obtained near the finol
boundory for which excessively lorge
histories would have been required if this tech-
nique had not been used. The trensmitted and
reflacted energy spectra from this study have been
stored in o systematic order on magnetic tope and
are available for calculations. The energy spectra
give the fraction of the incident energy which may
be expected within each of 120 energy—solid angle

vals) for both the reflected and the transmitted

5.3. LID TANK SHIELDING FACILITY

NEW INSTRUMENT CARRIAGE AT THE LTSF
W, Zobel

The necessity of toking progressively more pre-
cise data ot the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF)
made it obvious thot one of the uncertainties which
had to be eliminated was that associated with the
location of the detectors, While the position of a
detector in the tank could be reproduced to within
about £2 mm, the absolute position was open to
doubt within about +5 mm, It was therefore de-
cided to replace the detector holder and positioner.

The new equipment was required to be more
rigid than the old so that the absolute position and
the indicated position would always coincide, and
it had to hove an inherent accuracy of about £0.5 mm.
The system (Fig. 5.3.1} which wos adopted is very
similar te that in use at the Tower Shielding
Focility (TSF). This system provides for remote
contrel of the carriage from the control room and
thereby greotly increases the ease of operation,
The new instrument carriage has been installed
and is now in use. |t appears to give very satis-
factory service, and it is expected that the con-
fidence level of future data taken at the LTSF will
be increased.

The detector carriage is driven in the y-direction
by two ball-bearing lead screws which, however,
do not support the carriage. Thus greater accuracy
and longer life can be obtained. The use of the
ball-bearing nut eliminstes backlash. The load
is carried on the channet base, which con be made
as strong as required, A guide rail ¢n one side
assures that the carriage will run true,

In the z-direction the load is supported by two
large shafts, which also serve as guides. The
drive is ogain provided by a ball-bearing lead
screw.

The drive in the x-direction is of the rack-and-
pinion type, with the rack cut info the vertical
drive shoft, This is o large tube ond was chosen
to provide sutficient rigidity for the holder.

Contrel of the drive motors in the three directions
is manual at present. The position of the detector
suppert, located at the end of the vertical shaft,
is indicated at three panels in the control room,
Two indicators are provided for each direction.
One is a dial for coarse control, driven by a torque
transmitter system geared to the drive motor; the
other is a fine control, indicated by an Amerac

290

dial, which uses a selsyn system to drive the dial
by the usuel null technique., The indication of
the fine control is to the necrest millimeter, with
interpolation on the dial to 0.5 mm eosily possible.
Provision has been made to permit later conversion
of the conirols to a closed-loop system by which
the desired position on the detector con be selected
and the corrioge will then “‘hunt’’ until it reaches
that location. Provision is also made for future
installation of ¢ readout system for use with an
isodose plotter,

Preliminory tests showed that the instrument
carrioge, as finally constructed does not deviate
from a given plane by more than 0.006 in. over the
full range of the water tank at the LTSF. This
indicates that the aobsolute position of an instru-
ment can be determined to at least +5.5 mm and is,
at present, limited by the accuracy with which the
indicators can be read. It is {elt, however, that
+0.5 mm is sufficiently accurate for the purpose,
and therefore no changes are contemploted,

E. A, Sullivan S. Johnson
Metal Hydrides, Inc.

One of the materiats which has been suggested
as a neutron shield for a mobile reactor is lithium
borohydride,  This relatively new compound is
particularly attractive because it contains 18.5wt %
hydrogen, which is the most efficient lightweight
neutron abseorber known, as well as lithivm and
boron, both of which suppress secondary gommo
radiation arising from neutron capture by the shield
material, in oddition to being good neutron ab-
sorbers, Lithium borohydride is a white crystalline
selid which is stable to its melting point of 275°C
and has essenticlly no vapor pressure even of this
elevated temperature, In on attempt to achieve a
liquid shield which could be cooled externally and
would avoid difficult fabrication problems, empha-
sis has been cltered to consider shield components
utilizing this compound in combination with an
ingxpensive diluent that would not change fhe
Ammonia, which

Pressure-Temperature-Compos ition Relationships

The ammonia vapor pressure in eqguilibrium with
mixtures of lithium berchydride and ammonia was
determined os ¢ function of concentration ond of
temperature, The lithium borohydride mole frac-
tions used ranged from 1.0 to slightly less than
0.2 in the temperature range O to B0°C. Lithium
borohydride forms four stable adducts with gmmenia:
lithium borohydride monoammonicte, LiBHd-NHB,
which has a melting point of 56.5°C; lithivm boro-
hydride diammoniate, LiBH .2NH,, which melts
ot  17.0°C; lithium borchydride trismmoniate,
LiBH ,-3NH,, which displays an incongruent
melting point ot 32.5°C; and lithium borohydride

Where necessary {0t temperatures >40°C), small
corrections were made in the equilibrium data to
account for the effect of cmmoneolysis on the com-
position of the somples. When precautions were
taken, this reaction did not interfere with equilib-
rivm measurements,

Density Relationships

The densities of liquid lithivm borohydride
ammoniates were determined as a function of both
composition and femperature. Five ceonditions
between LiBH ,+1.06NH,; and LiBH .2.74NH , were
studied. The temperature range in which each
compaosition wos studied depended on the liguidus
temperature at the given composition and on the
vapor pressure encounterad, Two of the composi-
tiens studied, Li|:.‘>H4~'f.7"3NH3 and LiBH4-2.36NH3,
correspond to the ewtectics on either side of the
diemmonigte of lithium borohydride. These com-
positions hove the lowest liquidus temperatures
in the entire phase diagram, both ot 15°C, and
therefore have the longest temperature ronges for
the liquid state. la generol, the study encompassed
temperature ranges between 15 and 85°C.

The density for o given composition was found to
be a linear function of temperature, os expected,
and the experimentally determined equeotions are,
where ¢ is in °C:

(1) LiBH +1.06NH,:
(2) LiBH - 1.73NH,:
(3) LiBH,+2.04NH:

With the exception of L]BH4-2.04NH3, a simple
relationship was found to exist between the com-
poesition and both the slope and intercept of the
density equations. The following empirical equa-
tions were found to relate these foctors:

which cover the entire liquid range.

SURVEY OF SHIELDING MATERIALS UNDER

Technical Research Group

A recent survey of shielding moterials confirms
that lithium hydride and polyethylene are the mast
effective neutron shields known to dote. Lithium
hydride is by for the best solid shield material in
curved geometries. The use of Li®H is expected
to lead to a further weight savings of approximately
12%. Lithium hydride is the only lightweight neu-
tron shield material which can be used in the range
of 700 to 1200°F without developing high pressure
or decomposing. This is the range of temperafure
which may be expected in some parts of the direct-
cycle recctor shield. Neutron shield moterials for
use at temperatures above 2000°F may be required

severe that the problem is one of obtaining ma-
terials that will withstand the high temperature,
rather than a minimum weight problem. M a liquid

tation or some other reason, cne of the substituted

Polyethylene of high density (>0.95 g/cm?) and
of high strength is now available. Some analyses

5.4. TOWER SHIELDING REACTOR Il

C. E. Clifford

As was stated previously,! a reoctor which will
have a higher and mere uniform fast-neutron and
gamma-ray leakage flux than that ovailoble with
the present Tower Shielding Reccter is needed for
future aircraft shielding experimentation. To fill
these requirements a 5-Mw solid-fuel Tower
Shielding Reactor |l {TSR-11} has been propesed
which will be spherical in shape. The TSR-Il will
be controlled by umbrella-shaped beoron-looded
plates located in an interna!l water reflector, in
which position they will give a minimum perturba-
tion to the reactor leckage flux,

In order to establish the dimensions of a core
configuration that would fit the requirements of
the reactor, the following calculational procedures
were followed. A nuclear parometer study was
carried out first to determine the critical moss
and control available for various core sizes,
internal woter reflector thicknesses, and aluminum-
to-woter volume ratios. From this study o configu-
ration was selected which appeared to be the
optimum configuration from the viewpoint of critical
mass ond small reactor diameter. This configuration
was then examined to ensure thot the surface
density of the U239 in the fuel plates would be
betow 0.0283 g/cm?, a density which was estab-
lished during operating experience with the MTR.?
Finally the configuration was exomined to deter-
mine whether the waoter flow available fo remove
the heot from the core was sufficient to prevent
local boiling. The results of these tests are
presented below,

40, and 50 cm and core thicknesses of 18, 20, ond
25 cm. The oluminum-to-water volume ratios in
the cores ranged from 0,250 1o 2.000. All possible
reflector-core combinations were investigated for
eoch oluminum-to-water ratio. For the calculations
the external water reflector was considered to be
20 cm of woter rather than the lead-water combi-
nation that is proposed for the actual reactor. A
sketch of the geometry used in the calculation is
shown in Fig. 5.4.1, ond socme of the constants
are presented in Toble 5.4.1,

Calculations were made first to determine the
effective multiplication factor for severcl concen-
trations of U233 in the fuel plates. Typical results
for one geometry ond all aluminum-to-woter volume
ratios are shown in Fig. 5.4.2, Earlier calculetions
for this reacter showed that 4% excess reactivity
would be necessary to compensate for temperature
rise, xenon poisoning, and burnup ond to provide
1% for control. The concentration that gave an
excess reactivity of 4% in a perticulor configuration
was used to compute the mass of U233 that would
be required for thot canfiguration.

In Figs. 5.4.3 through 5.4.5 the critical mass is
shown as o function of internal reflector radius for

As expected, the

core geometries considered.

The omount of excess reactivity that it is pos-
sible to control for the various gecmetries was
determined next. This calculction was performed
in o stroightforward manner (os provided in the
3GIR Orocle code) by the insertion of a boron-
loaded sheil between the internal reflector and the
core region. The results shown in Fig. 5.4.6 are
for a very light loading of boron in the shell
(0.0022 gz”cmE). Unfortunately, time did not permit
o more involved calculation for o heavier boron
shell; nowever, volyes for heavier boron concen-
trotions will be obtained in later calculations ond
experiments, Although it is possible to obtain a
larger amount of control by using higher aluminum-
to-water velume rotios ond larger internal reflector
regions, the greatest ingrease in control is reclized

aluminum-to-water volume rotio produces less than
1.5% chenge in the fast-neutron leckage. Over the
porobable operating ronge of the contrel plates
(3 to 5 cm), the variation in fast-neutron leckage
will be less than 1,5%. '

The spoce required to house the proposed controf

from the core will necessitote that the internal
water reflector be no smaller than 17.5 in. in
diameter. With this parameter fixed it was then
necessary fo carry out o study to determine the
corresponding core parameters which would give
a minimum fuel loading. This was done by plotting
the critical mass as a function of core thickness
for various cluminum-to-water volume rotios (Fig.
5.4.9). As would be expected, the moss decreased
with a decrease in the aluminum-to-water volume
ratio; however, it does not seem practicoble to go

below the ratio of 0.7 used in the BSF reactor.?

Also, if this ratic is used the standard arrangement
of 60-mil-thick fuel plotes separcted by 120 mils
of water can be used. Since the amount of control
availoble increases with a decrease in core thick-
ness, an approximately 1d4-cm core thickness
{5.5 in.) appecrs to be the optimum. This thin
core, which requires less thon 6.5 kg of U3 for
criticality, will alsc be an advantage with respect
to the heat removal preblem (see below).

The configuration having a 17.5-in.-dia internal
woter reflector and 5.5-in.-thick core region wos
then examined to ensure that the U233 fyel plate
loading would not exceed the 0.0283 g/cm? surface
density previously designoted. It wos found thot
the maximum loading pessible for this surface
density wos 9.5 kg. This allows for an error in
the critical mass obtained from the two-group
Oracle calculotions to be as high as 45%. The

HEAT REMOVAL STUDY

The heat flux from the fuel plates will be approxi-
mately 5 x 104 Btu/ft2.hr, To remove this heot o
two-pass cooling system hos been proposed. |t
wos previously determined® that a 1000-gom flow
rate with a 40°F temperature rise of the water over
the inlet water temperature would provide sufficient
cooling to prevent beiling or excessive fuel plote
temperatures in d reactor core with higher alumi-
num-to-water volume ratics. It was clso stated
that o larger internal reflector ond thinner core
region would make conditions even better. The

17.5-in.-dia reflector and 5.5-in.-thick

core meet these conditions, but the larger water
volume dictated by the lower oluminum-to-water
ratio i5 somewhat detrimental. It is felt that if
turbulent water How could be maintained in each
channel, odequate cooling could still be achieved
with the 1000-gpm flow rate. Using o log meon
flow aoreo ond ossuming equel flow per channel,
the Reynolds number was calculated ond found to
vary from 11,000 in the inner chennels to 8500 in
the outer channel. It appears, therefore, thot
sufficient lotitude will exist over which to adjust
flow rates to obtain uniform outlet temperatures
and still maintain turbuient flow.

FUTURE STUDIES

Preparations are being made for several develep-
ment experiments to further estoblish the TSR-II
design. Several control system mockups consisting
of sclid stainless steel plotes, perforated stoinless
steel plates, or boron-loaded cluminum plates will
be tested in a é-in.-square water-filled hole in the
center of the BSF reactor. A prototype of the
actual control design is olso being constructed
for other dynamic tests. In addition, the fuel
element drawings are now complete, and a model
will be fobricated to establish a heoder arrange-
ment tor the cooling system,
