this objective is to gain public acceptance'of a nev.form'of power

generating electrical power in the future and to consider making the |
heavy, long-term commitments of resources in funds, facilities and
personnel needed to provide the transition from the early experimental

facilities and demonstration plants to full scale commercial reactor

power plant systems.

Consistent with the policy established for all power reactor development
programs, the MSBR would require the successful accomplishment of three

basic research and development phases'

. An initial research and development phase in which the basic
.technical aspects of the MSBR concept are confirmed involving-’
exploratory development, laboratory experiment, and conceptual
engineering. 7 - |
. A second phase in which the engineering and manufacturing
capabilities are developed. This includes the conduct of
. in-depth engineering and prooftesting of.first-offafkind:dﬁ
~components, equipment and systems. . These would then be

incorporated'into experimental installations and supporting

. With regard to the MSBR, preliminary reactor designs were evaluated in |

WASH-1097 ("The Use of Thorium in Nuclear Power Reactors") based upon

 
e _75_

'the information supplied by ORNL Two reactor design concepts were

' _,1fconsidered --'a two fluid reactor in which the fissile and fertile i

- salta were separated by graphite and a single fluid concept in which

: the fissile and fertile salts were completely mixed This evaluation
, identified problem areas requiring resolution through conduct of anj_
intensive research and development program.% Since the publication of
'IHTWASH-1097 all efforts related to the two fluid system have been__

, fdiscontinued because of mechanical design problems and the development

-fof processes which would, 1f- developed into engineering systems,

. permit the - on-line reprocessing of fuel from single fluid reactors. -

ij At present,-the MSBR concept is essentially in the initial research

V'Vand development phase, with emphasis on the development of basic MSBR
technology. The technology program is centered at ORNL'where L
-”essentiallyall research and deve10pment on molten salt reactors has )

been performed to date. The program is currently funded at a level |

of $5 million per year.r Expenditures to date on molten salt reactor
technology both for military and civilian power applications have

;amounted to approximately $150 million of which approximately $70 million_

has been in support of central station power plants.‘ These efforts date

lﬁ!{In considering the MSBR for central station power plant application, it

'5"ffis noted that this concept has several unique and desirable features.,rl

';«lf 1at the ‘same time, it is characterized by both complex technological and

 
 

-6-

practical engineering problems which are specific to fluid fueled
reactors and for which solutions have not been developed. Thus,r;
this concept introduced major concerns that are different in kind and
magnitude from those coumonly associated with solid fuel breeder
reéétsfs.“ The'development'of satisfactory experimental units and

' further consideration ofrthis concept for use as a commercial power.
plant uill require‘resolution of these as well as other problems which

are common to all reactor concepts.

As part of the AEC" s Systems Analysis Task Force (AEC report |
_WASH-1098) and the "Cost-Benefit Analysis of the v.s. Breeder |
H'Reactor Program" (AEC reports WASH-llZG and WASH-1184), studies
were conducted on the cost and benefit of developing another |
breeder system, parallel" to the LMFBR. The consistent conclu-
sion reached in these studies is that sufficient information is |
available to indicate that the projected benefits from the LMFBR
program can support a parallel breeder program.' However, these
results are highly sensitive to the assumptions on plant capital
costs'uith the recognition;evenyamong concepts in uhich.amplef -
experience exists, that capital costs and especiallygsnall estimated
differences in costs are highly speculative for plants to be built '
i15 or 20 years from now.- Therefore, it is questionable whether
analyses based upon such costs should constitute a major basis for
making decisions relative to the desirability of a parallel breeder -

effort.

The technical effort accomplished since the publication of WASH-1097

‘however, this work has not advenced the program beyond the initial

phase of research and development. Although progress has been made
in several areas (e.g., reprocessing and improved graphite), new

problems not addressed in WASH-1097 have arisen vhich could affect :

- the precticality of designing and operating a MSBR. Exsmples of

major uncertainties relate to materiels of construction, merhods fori -

control of tritium, and the design of components and systems along

with their special handling, inspection and maintenance equipment.

Considerable research and development efforts are required in order

to obtain the data necessary to resolve the uncertainties.'F; |

III. RESOURCE UTILIZATION
It has long beenvrecognizedrthat the imporﬁanée-of nuclear fuels for
power production depends initially on the utilization of thefnaturally
occurring fissile U-235; but it is the mpfe abundaﬁt fertile materials,
‘ﬁ;238 and Th-232, which will be the majﬁr source of nuclear power
genérated in the future.  The basic physica characteristics of fiséile
plutoniﬁm ﬁroduced from U-238 offer the potential for high breeding
gains in fast reactors;vandthe.potential.tO'expand greatly the
utilization of uranium resources by making feasible the utilization éf‘
additional vast quantities of otherwise uneconomic low grade ore. In
a similar manner, the basic-physics characteristics of the thorium .
,cycle will permit full utiliz;tion of-the nation's thorium resources
while at the same time offering the potential for breeding in thermal

reactors.

The estimated thofium reserves ﬁre sufficient to supply the world's
. electric énergy needs for many hundreds of years 1if the thorium is
uéed in a high gain breeder reactor. It is projected thaﬁ if this
quantity of thorium vere used in a breeder reactor, approxiﬁatelv

1000 Q (1 q = 1018

Btu) would be realized from this fertile material.
It is estimated that the uranium reserves would also supply 1000 Q*

of energj if the uranium were used in LMFBRs. In contrast, only 20 Q

would be available 1f thorium were used as the fertile material in

~an advanced converter reactor because the reactor would be dependent

In 1956, ORNL began to study mplten salt reactors for application as
centr@l station converters and breeders. These studies cgncludéd that.

on the technology'at that timé;-it was thought that a two—fluid_:eactof -
inQthch the fertile and fissiie salts were kept sebarate was tequired

in order to have a breeder system. The single fluid reactor, while not

a breeder, appeared simpler in design and also seemed to have the

potential for low power costs.

.Oye: the next few years, ORNL continued to study both the twd,fluid'énd_
‘'single fluid concepts, and in 1960 theidesignrof the'singléfiuid /

1969. The MSRE experience is treated in more detail in a later section.

V. MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The breeding reactions of the thorium cycle are:

232 233 B 233 B8 233,
e e —( ——————
Th + Th 57 5in. Pa 55 ra U

Because of the nuhber of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed and the
small fast fission bonus associated with U-233 and Th-232 in the |
thermal spectrum. a breeding ratio only slightly greater than unitv is
achieveble. In order to realize breeding with the thorium cvcle it is
necessary to remove the bred Pa-233 and the various nucleat poisons
produced by the fission process from the high flux region as quickly as
pdesible, The Molten Salt Breeder Reectof concept permits rapid removal
of Pa-233 and the nuclear poisons (e.g. Xe-135 and the rare earth
elements). The reactor is a fluid fueled;syseem containing UFA and
'l‘hF4 dissolyed in LiF -'Berg The molten fuel salt flows through a
graphite moderator where the nuclear reactions take place. A side
strean is cpntinuously processed to remove the FPa and rare earth

elements, thereby permitting the achievement of a caICulated breeding

ratio of about 1.06.
The MSBR is attractive because of the following:

1. Use of a fluid fuel and on—-site processing would eliminate the

problems of solid fuel fabrication and the handling, and

 
2,

3.

15-

_ shipping and reprocessing of spent fuel elements which are = °

associated with all other reactor types under active

consideration.

MSBR operation on the thorium-uranium fuel cycle would help = -
- conserve uranium and~;herium_resources_by utilizing thorium-

“reserves with high efficlency. -

The MSER is projeeted tb'have-attractive fﬁel'eycle coets.,

_The major uncertainty in the fuel cycle eost is associated ‘

| with the continuous fuel processing plant which has not been

developed. ;

The safety issues associated with the MSBR are generallv )

- different from those of solid fuel reactors. Thus. here T

might be safety advantages for the MSBR when considering-'
major accidents. An aceuretefassesement of MSBR gsafety 1is

not possible today because ef the early state of deveIOpment.

.-Like other advanced reactor systems such as the LHFBR and
HTCR the MSBR.would employ modern steam technologv for power
e7ageneration with high thermal efficiencies. This would reduce

'the amount of waste heat to be discharged to the environment.’

VI. STATUS,OFLMSBR{TECHNOLOGY

MSRE - The Reference Point for Current Technolqu

'The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was begun in 1960 at

~ ORNL as part of the Civilian Nuclear Power Program. The purpose'

of the experiment was to demonstrate the basic feasibility of

- molten salt power reactors. A11 objectives of the experiment

vere achieved'duringfits'succesanl'operation”from Jnnefl955'to |

December 1969. ‘These included the distinction of becoming the

first reactor in the world to operateqaolely'onlU4233.;’Some'of'
the more significant dates and statistics pertinent to the MSRE

are given in Table II.

In spite of the success of the 'MSRE, there are many areas of ‘molten

salt technology which must be expanded and developed in order to.'

iproceed from this small non-breeding experiment to a safe, reliable,

and economic 1000 MW(e) MSBR with a 30—year life. To illustrate

this point, some of the most important differences in basic design

'and performance characteristics between the MSRE and a conceptual

1000 MW(e) MSBR are given in Table III.V Scale-up would logicallv

be accomplished through development of reactor plants of increasing

. size. Examination of Table III provides an appreciation of the

- Continuous Fuel Processi;g The Kgy to Breeding>””'

In order to achieve nuclear breeding in the single fluid MSBR it |

is necessary to have an qn—line continuous fuel processing'svstem;

This

would accomplish the foilowing:

Isolate protactinium-233 from the reactor enviromment so it

- can}decay"into the»fissiie fuel isotope uranidm-233'beforé

‘being transmuted into other isotopes by neutron irradiatien.

, Remove‘undesirable neutron poisons from the:fuei salt and

thus improve the neutron economy and breedinngerforﬁance'
of the system.
Control the fuel chemistry and remove excess uranium—233

which is to be exported‘from the breeder system.

Chemical Process Development
The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has propoéed_a-fuel .
processing scheme to accomplish breeding in the MSBR, and

the flowéheet pfocgsses involve:

a. Fluorination of the fuel salt to remove uranium gs"Ufs.‘

 
 

 

| vhich would require injecting helium bubbles into the fuel

-23-

b. Reductiverextraction'of protsctinium by contacting the

salt with a mixture of 1lithfum and bismuth.

c.,Metal-trsnsfer nrocessing to preferentially remove_the
rare earth;fiséion”product‘poisons vhich would otherwise
hinder breeding performance..
The fuei“p£5&éésiﬁg systen shown’ianig.VZ 1s in an esrlv stage
of development at present and this tvpe of svstem has not been

demonstrated on an operating reactor. By comparison, the MSRE

'required only off~11ne batch fluorination to recover uranium

from fuel sslt.

At this time, the basic chemistry involved in the HSBR

i ‘processing scheme has been demonstrated in leborstorv scele
-experiments.- Current efforts at Oak Ridge are being directed

. toward development of subsystems incorporeting many of the

required processing steps. Ultimately a complete breeder

Vprocessing experiment would be required to demonstrate the

system with sll the chemicel conditions and operstionsl

requirements which would be encountered with any HSBR

Molten Salt Reactor Design - Materials Requirements

In concept, the molten salt reactor core is a comparatively
uncomplicated type of heat source. The MSRE_re&ctorcore;7for
example, consisted of a prismatic'atfdcturé of unclad graphite
moderator through which fuel salt flowed to be heated by the
self-gustaining chain reaction which took place as long as the
Balt was in the graphite. The entire reactor internals and fuel
salt were contained in vessels and hiping'made of Haétéllbv-u, a
high strength nickel base glloy which was developed under the
Aircraft'Nucleér'Propulsion‘Program. Over thé fouréfearrlifetime
of the MSRE, the reactor structural materials performed satis-
factorily for the purposes of the experiments although operation

for two reasons: - (1) larger vo;umea;of coolant salt will be

iuaea to generate steam in the MSBR, and (2) salt,températures
_in the steam generator should be low enough, if poasible, to

‘utilize conventional steam system technology with feedwater

temperatures up to gbout 550°F. The operation of MSRE was
less affected by the coolant salt melting temperature since

it dumped_the,BVMW(tﬁ) of heat via an air-cooled radiator.

The high melting temperaturés of potential coolant salts

remain a problem. The current choice is a eutectic mixture

composition of 8% NaF-%2% NaBF4; this saIt melts at 725°F.

However, the effects of heat exchaﬁger'ieaké'between the

fluoroborate salt is currently being studied with respect

E. Reaétdr Equipment énd Systems Development

While the MSBREwould utilize some existing engineering technology from

~ other reactor types, there-ﬁte spéciiic components and systems for which
additional development work is required. Such work would have to take
into acéount the induced activity that those components would accumulate
in the MSBR system; i.e., special handling‘and maintenance equipment would
algo need to be developed. The previous discussion has already dealt'f

with a number of these, such as fuel processing components and systems,

but additional discussion is appropriate.

1. Components
As indicated in the Table III, a number of components must be

scaled up substantially from the MSRE sizes before a large MSBR
is possible. The development of these larger components along
with their specialihandling and maintenance equipment is proB-
ably one of the most difficult aﬁd costly phases of MSBR
development, However,nreliable, safe, and,maintaihable
compbnénts would need to be developed in order fqt aﬁy,reactor

system to be a success,

The MSBR pumps would likely be similar in basic design to those

for the‘MSRE, nanely, vertical shaft, dverhung impeller pumps.

systems would be required, each with its own system for

tank would have to be equipped with an auxiliary cooling system

F. " Maintemsnce - A Difficult Problem for_the MSER
Unlike solid fueled resctorsrin which the primary-system contsins
isctivstion products and only those fission products which msy leak from
defective fuel pins, the MSBR would hsve the bulk of the fission products

"dispersed throughout the reactor system.r Because of this dispersal of

'i'fradioactivitys remote techniques VO“ld be required f°r many maintenance

 

functions if the reactor were to—have an acceptable plant svailsbility in

the utility environment.p"'

B The HSRE’was designed for remote msintenance of highly radioactive.éw
rcomponents, however, no najor‘naintenance problems (removal or repair of

ilarge components) were encountered after nuclear operation was initiated

 

 

 
 

-44-
Thus, the degree to which the MSRE experience on maintenance is

| applicsble to large commercial breeder reactors is open to question.

Ashssheen evident.in plsnt layoutwork_on nuclenriggcilitiesto date._‘
_this requirement for remote maintenance will significantly affect the
ultimate design and performance of the plant system. IhemHSBR would
require remote techniques snd tools for inspection, weldiug and cutting
of pipes, mechanical sssembly and dissssembly of components and systens,
- andrremoving, transportiug endqhendling.large;component items after they
become’highlyvradioactive,;lhe_removsl and replacement of'core
internels,‘such as grsphite,'might pose difficult msintenance.problems
because of the high radiation levels involved snd the contamination

protection which would be required whenever the primary system is opened.

_mAnother potential problem is-the sfterheat.generation'hy"fissionproducts

Safety=- Different Issues fot ‘the MSBR

| The MSBR concept has certain characteriatics which might provide
'_advantages relating to- safety, particularly with resoect to poetulated
major types of . accidenta cutrently considered in licensing activities.
- Since the fuel would be in a molten form, consideration of the core

'meltdown accident is not applicable to the ﬁSBR. Also,—in the event

--1of a fuel spill secondary criticality is not a problem since this is

 

a8 thermal reactor system requiring moderator for nuclear criticality. o

tLOther safety features include the fact that the primary system*would

-T,Operate at low preasure with fuel salt that is’ more than IOOO'F below

 
 

-46-

its boiling éoint, that fission product iodine and strontium form

stable compounds in the fluoride salts, and tﬁat the salts do not react
rapidly with air or water. Because of the éontiﬁuous_fuel_prpcessing,-
-the need for excess reactiviéy would be decreased and some of the fission
products would be continuously removed from the primary system. A prompt.
ﬁegativé temperature coefficient of reéctivity;is_also a characteristic |

of the fuel salt.

Safety disadvantages, on the other hand, include the very high radio-
active contamination which would be ptgsent,throughout_:hg primary .
system, fuel processing plant, and all agxiliéry;primafysystems_such

as the fuel drain and off-gas systems. Thus, coﬁtainment.of*these'q
é&stems would have to be assﬁred. Also, removal of>decay‘heat from fuel
storage systems would have to be provided by always_ready'and:re;iable_
‘_éooliug-systems, particularly for the fuel drain tank and the Pa+233 decay
tank in the reprocessing plant where megawatt éuantities of'decay.heat,r
must be removed. The tritium problem, already discussed, would have to

be controlled to assure safety.

Bgsed_on the present state of MSBR technology, it is not possible. to
provide a complete assessment of:MSBR'safety;:elgtive to other reactors.
It can be stated, however, that the saféty issues for the MSEBR aré
generally different ffomﬂghose for solid fuel reactors, and that more
detailed design work must,bé;donerbefore the aaf?ty éd#antageg and -

diséﬂvantagestof the MSBR could be fully evaluated.

H. Codes, Standsrds wandHigh.Tempersture Design Methods |
Codes and standards for MSBR equipment snd systems must be developed in
'conjunction with other research snd development before large MSBR 8 can
be built. In particular, the materials of construction which are
'currently being deve10ped and tested would have to be certified foruse

rfThe need for high temperature.design technology is a problem for the HSBR
_-as well as for other high temperature systems._ The AEC currently hss
| under way a program in support of the LMFBR which is providing msterials
'_'dats and strnctural analysis methods for design of systems employing
;various steel alloys at temperatures up to 1200°F. This progrsm would

. VII. INDUSTRIAL PAR"ricIPA'rIoN "IN THE MSER PROGRAM

 

- Privately funded conceptual design studies and evaluations of HSBR _

technology were performed in 1970 by the Molten Selt Breeder Reactor
Associates (HSBRA), a study group headed by the engineering firm of
' Black & Veatch and including five midwest utilities. The HSBRA con-
cluded that the economic potential of the MSER is attrsctive:reletire
to 1ight water reactors, but they recognized a number of problems‘which
must be resolved in order to realize this potentiel. Sincethat‘time

the HSBRA has been relatively inactive. .

A second privately funded organization, the Molten Salt Group, ie headed
Tby Ebasco Services Incorporated and includes five other industrial firms
and fifteen utilities. In 1971 the Group completed an evsluation of the
HSBR concept and technology and concluded that existing technology is
sufficient to justify construction ‘of an MSBR demonstretion plent
althOngh the performance characteristics-could;not'beunredictedynith

: confidence. Additional support for further studies hes“recentlﬁ been

committed by the members of this group.

In addition to these studies, manufacturers of graphite and Hastelloy-N

" have been cooperating with ORNL to develop improved materials.

There has been little other industrial participstion in the HSBR

Progrsn aside from ORNL snbcontractors. At the present time, there are

rfindustrial firms who ero participante in the Hblten Salt Group is
performing a design and evalnation etudy. Foster Wheeler Corporation is
,ourrently performing design studies on steam generatore for HSBR

vapplication.

A number of factors can.beidentified thch tend to. limit further

{ndustrial involvement at this time, namely:

1. The existing major industrial and utility commitmehte,to_the

‘LWR, HIGR, and LMFBR.

2. The lack of incentive for industrial investment in supplying
fuel cycle services, such as those required for solid fuel

reactors.

+ 3. The overwhelming'manufacturing and opereting experience with
eolid fuel reactors in contrest with the very limited involve—

'_1ment with fluid‘fueled¥reeetors.

It'dhOﬁld be noted that these factors are also relevant considerations
 in establishing the level of governmental support for the MSBR program
vhich in turn, to some extent, affects the interest of the manufacturing

and utility industries.

l;:vtii;' CONCLUSIONS -
The Holten Salt Breeder Reactor, Af successfully developed and marketed
could provide a useful supplement to tbe currently developing uranium-
plutonium reactor economy. This concept offers the potential for°
. Breeding in a thermal spectrum reactor; o
. Efficient use of thorium as a fertile material
!: Elimination of fuel fabrication and spent fuel ehipping,

. High thermal efficiencies.

Notwithstanding these attractive features, this assessment has

reconfirmed the existence of major technological and engineering

problems affecting feasibility of the concept as a reliable and ‘

Je

economic breeder for the utility industrv. The principal concerns

include uncertainties with materials, with methods of controlling

tritium, and with the design of components and systems along with

their special handling inspection snd maintenance equipment._ Many

of these problems are compounded by the ‘use of a fluid fuel in which

. fission products and delayed neutrons are distributed throughout the v

primary reactor snd reprocessing systems.

The resolution of the problems of the MSBR will require the conduct 7'

: of an intensive research and development program._ Included among ef,s:.

the major efforts that would have to be a°°°mplished are-'"r"'

-f:;. Proof testing °f an 1nteﬂrated reprocessing system,'T:J -

. Conceptual definition of the engineering features of themany

. 'Development of adequate methods nnd equipment for remote

The major problems ascociated with the MSBR are rather difficult in nature
and many are unique to thia concept.ﬁ Continuing support of the research

~ and development effort will be required to obtain satiafactorv solutions
to the problems. When significant evidence is available that demonstrates.
'realistic solutions are practical a further assessment could then be made
as to the advisability of advanciny into the detailed design and | |
engineering phase of the development process including that of industrial
involvement. Proceeding with this next step would also be contingent |
upon obtaining a firm demonstration of interest and commitment to the
concept hyhthepower industry and the utilities and reasonahle assurances
that large scalegovernment andindustrialresources can{he,madeavailahle-l
