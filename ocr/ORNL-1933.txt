INTRODUCTION

Laminar and turbulent forced-convection solutions were derived in
references 1 and 2 for the case where fluids with uniform volume heat sources
were flowing through circular pipes and between parallel plates respectively,
heat was being added to or subtracted from the fluids in a uniform manner at
the duct walls These duct systems were postulated to be long so that the
thermal and hydrodynamic patterns were established and the physical properties
were stipulated to be invariant with temperature The turbulent flow solution
for each system was accomplished by separating the general boundary value
problem into two simpler ones whose solutions were superposed yielding the
solution to the original boundary value problem One boundery value problem
defined a flow system with a volume heat source but with no wall heat flux and
the second one defined a flow system without a volume heat source but with a
uniform wall heat flux In the superposition process, temperatures above datum
temperatures are added, for example, the radial temperature distribution ebove
the centerline temperature for the general boundary value problem is obtained
by adding the radial temperature distributions above the centerline tempera-
tures for the two specific boundary value problems

The present report gives 1) detailed tsbulations of the turbulent tempera-
ture profilesl for volume-heat-source and wall-heat-flux pipe and parallel
plates systemsfor a series of Reynolds and Prandtl moduli and 2) applications
of these temperature solutions to two types of convection systems, namely,
uniformly and nonuniformly cooled ducts containing flowing fluids with volume

heat sources

 

1 Although the detailed radial temperature profiles for turbulent flow had
been evaluated at the writing of the earlier reports they were not included
at that time, only the dimensionless differences between the wall and mixed
mean fluild temperatures were presented because they are generally of more
interest

GENERALIZED RADIAL TEMPERATURE PROFILES

The dimensionless radial temperature profiles within fluids having uniform
volume heat sources and that are flowing in circular pipes and between parsllel
plates under turbulent conditions with no wall heat transfer have been evaluated
from the solutions given in references 1 and 2 and are tabulated in Tables I
and II The corresponding temperature profiles for the case where there are
uniform wall heat fluxes but no volume heat sources have been evaluated from
Martinelli's solutions (reference 3) and are tesbulated in Tables III and IV

Some typical normalized radial temperature profiles for turbulent flow
in a pipe for both the volume heat source and wall heat flux cases for Pr = 1
and Pr = Ol are shown plotted in Figures 1, 2, 3, and % Note how the
shapes of these profiles vary with Reynolds and Prandtl moduli as well as the
manner in which heat is added to the fluids The radial temperature distri-
butions are dependent upon the radial heat flow and eddy diffusivaty distri-
butions in eddition to the boundary layer thicknesses and Prandtl moduli
The dimensionless radisl heat flow distribution for the wall heat flux case
varies linearly from a maximum value at the wall to zero at the duct center,
its shape is essentially not a function of Reynolds modulus However, the
dimensionless radial heat flow distributions for the volume-heat-source case
vary from zero at the wall to a maximum value between the wall and duct
center to zero at the duct center, their shapes vary significantly with
Reynolds modulus The dimensionless eddy diffusivity profiles vary waith radial
distance from the wall asnd Reynolds modulus, and the dimensionless boundary
layer thicknesses are dependent on Reynolds modulus The Prandtl modulus

significantly influences the thermal resistances in the various flow layers
- 10 -

For example, 1n Figure 1 (where several temperature profiles are plotted
for Pr = 1 for the volume-heat-source case) 1t can be seen that the fraction
of the total temperature drop across the laminar sublayer and buffer layer in-
creases as Reynolds modulus decreases, this occurs because the radial heat flow
is proportionately larger in the boundary layers at the lower Reynolds modula
as well as because these layers are thicker under such circumstances Fagure 2
reveals several temperature profiles for Pr = Ol for the volume-heat-source
case, the thermal resistences are much lower in the boundary layers for low
Prandtl moduli fluids and hence the temperature differences across these
layers are relatively smaller The temperature profiles ain Figure 2
asymptoticelly approach the laminar flow temperature profile as the Reynolds

moduli decrease

RADIAI TEMPERATURE PROFILES FOR A PIPE SYSTEM WHOSE
WALL IS UNIFORMLY COOLED (AN EXAMPLE)

The temperature profiles tabulated in Tables I, II, III and IV can be used
to determine the detailed radial temperature structure in composite convection
systems Consider the case where a fluid with a uniform volume hest source s
flowing turbulently in a long pipe whose wall is being cooled uniformly along

its length The specific conditions of the problem follow

W=05x 100 Btu/hr £t
ry = 0 15 £t
(%%)o = 30,000 Btu/hr £t
k = 10 Btu/hr £t OF/ft
Re = 10,000

ANALYSIS OF THE THERMAL STRUCTURE IN A PIPE SYSTEM
WHOSE WALL IS NONUNIFORMLY COOLED
Consider the case where a fluid with a uniform volume heat source 1is

flowing turbulently in a pipe whose wall is being cooled, nonuniformly along
its length, by a coolant which i1s flowing in an annular space around the pipe
(see Figure 8a) The heat transferred from the wall to the coolant through
the differential heat transfer area 2nrodx 1s (see Figure 8b),

dg = he 2mrgdx (to - tg) (1)
The heat transferred through the pipe wall is

(t1 - t2)
&
The heat transferred from the fluid with the heat source to the wall 153

dq = ky 2nrydx (2)
dq = by 2wro dx[atygg + (te - t)] (3)

From equstions (1), (2) and (3) one can obtain

2nr dx[(tf - to) + AtVHS]

dq =

Uty - to + Atygg) 2nrg dx (4)

Two additional equations arise when making a heat rate balance on the two
fluid streams in a length dx (see Figure 8¢ ) The heat gained by the coolant

in a parallel flow system is
dq = m, cy, db, (5)

 

5 The term Atygg represents the wall temperature rise above the mixed mean
fluid temperature that exasts for the fluid with the volume heat source
with no wall heat flux In order to cool the wall temperature to t; (see
Figure 8b) it 1s necessary to superpose a wall cooling flux equal to that
given in equation (3)

CLOSING REMARKS

The forced-flow volumetric-heat-source solutions which were previously

developed were applied to two specific heat exchange systems They may also

be applied to other types of convection systems, several of which are suggested

below

1)

2)

3)

Parallel plates system whose wall is nonuniformly cooled  The
analysis presented for the nonuniformly cooled pipe system msy

be modified to obtain a solution for a parallel plates system by
replacing the pipe heat transfer area, 2nrydx, by a corresponding
one for the parallel plates system

Pipe and parallel plates systems whose walls are being cooled by
fluids having volumetric heat sources The analysis presented
for the nonuniformly cooled pipe system may be modified to obtain
the temperature solutions for general convection systems in which
the coolants also contain volumetric heat sources  Under these
circumstances a AtVHS term for the coolant is included in equetion (1),
and a volumetric heat source 1s included in equation (5), the
analysis is accomplished as before The new equation for T now
contains a modified form of the parameter M and also a'AtVHS

for the coolant has been added The same modifications occur

in the equation for the heat transfer rate, q

Pipe and parallel plates systems which are being nonuniformly
cooled by counter flow In this case it is merely necessary to
insert a minus sign in equation (5) and carry it through the

remaining analysis
This report has stressed only the turbulent flow regime although both
laminar and turbulent flow analyses were presented in references 1 and 2
Applications for laminar-flow volume-heat-source systems parallel those pre-
sented here for turbulent flow It 1s interesting to note, however, that the
heat extraction or cooling rates necessary to reduce wall temperatures to
mixed mean fluid or centerline temperatures in the case of lsminar flow are
much greater than those for turbulent flow For exsmple, 1t 1s necessary to
extract 33 1/5 percent of the heat generated within a laminarly flowaing fluad
in a pipe system to bring its wall temperature down to the centerline tempera-
ture, whereas for turbulently flowing ordinary fluids the corresponding heat

extraction rate 1s only several percent
