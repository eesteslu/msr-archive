CATASTROPHIC CORROSION OF TYPE 304 STAINLESS STEEL IN A
SYSTEM CIRCUILATING FUSED SODIUM FLUOROBORATE

J. W. Koger and A. P. Litman

ABSTRACT

A type 304 stainless steel liquid level probe contacted
fluoroborate salt (NaBF,~8 mole % NaF) in an Inconel 600 pump
loop at constant temperatures in the range 540 to 690°C for
192 hr. The probe exhibited heavy attack, evidenced by severe
leaching of Cr, Fe, Mn, and Si from the alloy. Equivalent
wniform attack was about 4 mils/day. Corrosion of the stain-
less steel, which 1s inferior to nickel-base alloys in fused
fluorides, became catastrophic in this system duvue to dissimilar-
metal effects.

 

INTRODUCTION

The PKP-1 loop, constructed of Inconel 600, is a forced-circulation
loop and part of the Fuel Pump High Temperature Endurance Test Facility.
The locop is used for performance testing centrifugal pumps of the type
developed for the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The loop was
altered to accept NaBF;—8 mole % NaF as the circulating medium as part
of the program to qualify the salt for use as a coolant in molten-salt
reactors. The experimental program currently involves the measurement
of the cavitation pressure of the pump as a function of temperature of
the molten salt. For these experiments the loop is operated under
nearly isothermal conditions in the range 540 to 690°C.

A liquid-level probe (Fig. 1) was installed in the pump bowl of
PKP-1 on June 20, 1968, to indicate changes in the liquid level that
occurred independently of changes in salt density. The probe was ini-
tially thought to be constructed with an Inconel 600 outer sheath, but
later examination showed it was type 304 stainless steel. The instru-
ment used a 1000-Hz electrical signal across a conductance probe

immersed in the salt and had an output signal that was a linear function

RESULTS

Visual and Metallographic

The portion of the probe that was immersed in salt was 0.25 in. in
diameter X 0.030 in. wall thickness. As shown in Fig. 2, heavy attack
occurred over the lower 2 in. of this section. The level of the salt
on the probe during operation is not known and appears to have varied.
For analysis, the tubing was cut into eight 3/4-in.-long samples, num~-
bered such that sample 1 was furthest from the exposed end.

Figure 3 shows two magnified views of the end of the probe
(sample 8). Severe distortion and very large pits are seen. In some
places the wall was completely penetrated. We calculated that the cor-

rosion in this region was equivalent to a uniform attack of 3.75 mils/day

(1.4 in./year). Damage decreased with increasing distance from the probe

tip. Pitting was less severe on sample 7 (about 1 in. from the tip),
but the photomicrographs (Fig. 4) show that this area was also heavily
attacked, The attack in this region extended for about 2ijils through
the tubing (about 3 mils/day). Figure 5, a photomicrograph of the upper
end of sample 7,.sh0ws-a preferential attack in the grain boundaries,
with the voids linking to form holes. Here the attack only extends for
about 10 mils through the tubing, thus, demonstrating the varying level

of the salt, as indicated by corrosion, on the probe.

Chemical

The salt was chemically analyzed just before the probe was placed
in the system and just after it was removed. The results are given in
Table 2. The Li, Be, U, and Th are frbm an earlier fuel salt used in
this lobp. As expected, no significant changes in the amounts of the‘
corrosion products iﬁ the salt resulted from corrosion of the probe
because (1) the surface area of the probe was small compafed to that of
the loop, and (2) the volume of salt was large ccmpared to the quantity
of corrosion products removed. The reported changes in the iron and
oxygen concentrations are attributed to sampling and analytical
procedures. o

Each probe sample was analyzed, and the results are given in
Table 3. We removed the attacked area from the base metal on sample 8
and determined the composition of each region. We found that the base
material of the probe was type 304 stainless steel and not Inconel 600
as originally thought by project personnel. The analysis of the
attacked area disclosed that mainly Cr,'Fe, Mn; and Si had been leached
from the base metél by the salt. This removal resultéd in an apparent
enrichment in Ni, Mo, and Cu, although in the areas of complete dissolu-
tion, of course, all the alloying elemehfs were removed. Also, about

20% unidentified material was associated with the attacked area.

Physical Property Changes

Initial examination disclosed that some parts of the probe were
highly ferromagnétic. Each of the eight-Samples was tésted with a Radio
Ffequency Laboratory gaussmeter No. 1890 to determine its magnetic field
strength (Table 4). This is a rapid nondestructive test suitable for
many engineering systems. This device is quite useful on iron- or
nickel-base alloys that are selectively attacked enough to change their
magnetic properties. The magnetic field stfength of the samples

increased as the end of the probe was approached.

Another testing device utilized in this study was a metal compari-

son meter.? This instrument,nondestructively identifies metals by

- measuring the Seebeck effect® of the unknown metal and comparing the

value to that Obtained'from‘a'piece of known metal. The standards

built into the device are nickel, type 304 stainless steel, Monel,
Inconel 600, and Hastelloy N. Table 4 gives the relative Seebeck effect
readings for the various samples and the standards. No attempt was

made to determine absolute values; The examination results were that
the Seebeck effect increased as the end of the probe was approached in
agreement with the gaussmeter tests. '

‘The metallurglcal evaluation showed that ‘the attack by the fluoro-
borate salt drastically changed the composition and properties of the
type 304 stainless steel_probe during service. The highly attacked
region had a final composition near that of 78 Permalloy (Ni—22% Fe), a
highly ferromegnetic material. The changes of the magnetic field
strength and the Seebeckueffect'as a function of attack were‘also indic-
ative of comp051tion changes and are often more sens1t1ve to small com-
p051t10n changes than chemlcal analys1s. The gradatlonrln these .
properties along the probe, as opposed to'an abrapt change, indicates
that the salt level varied during exposure. . |

DISCUSSION

To account for the heavy attack Observed we cons1dered several

ipotentlal corrosion mechanlsms._

two. metal junctions held at: dlfferent temperatures, when no other source

~~ of emf is present. The actual measuring unit consists of two copper
probes, one of which is heated, and a millivoltmeter. The probes are
placed on the metal to be tested, and the induced emf is read.

Impurity Effects

Salt analyses were obtained to decide if the salt itself was exces-
sively corrosive. Past work” has shown that fluorcborates that contain
at least 2000 ppm water and oxygen grefhighly corrosive to iron- and
nickel-base alloys. These impurities react with the salt to form HF,
which attacks almost all the constituents of the container materiéls.‘
The most common evidence of this is detection of an increase in the con-
centration of the more noble elements, such as nickel, in the salt.
This ﬁas not found for the system here, so we conclude, even,éonSidering
the surface area and volume mismatch of probe to salt and container system,

that the impurity effects on the probe corrosion were small.

Effect of Imposed Electromotive Force .

We also believe that the passage of current through the probe and
the associated emf had no effect on the corrosion rate, since other
probes containing essentially the same elements in different combina-
tions have shown no deleterious effects under an imposed emf in prior

exposures to fused fluorides.’

Stainless Steel Corrosion

have been conducted to determine the compatibility of stainless steel
with fluoroborate salts,'although both stainless steels and fluoro-
borate salt have been separately tested with other materials.

Table 5 summarizes recent data®:10 obtained from natural-circulation

~of this magnitude would be severe, equivalent to about 13 mils/year :
(0.035 mil/day) attack, more than can be tolerated in a;molteu-salt
reactor. However, this rate is only 1% of the maximum corrosibn_rate,

1.4 in./year (1370 mils/year) experienced by the probe.

Dissimilar-Metal Corrosion

It should be noted thatrthe above comparison of corrosion rates of
stainless steel and Hastelloy N is really valid only in systems where
all the container material exposed to the salt is of the same composi-
tion. In the PKP-1 system described in this work, the iron-base
type 304 stainless steel was surrounded by the more noble and more cor-
rosion resistant nickel-base Inconel 600 which can be assumed to set
the oxidizing potential of the system. Thus, it is not surprising that
the less noble and more active stainless steel underwent much more corro-
sion (1370 vs 13 mils/year) than it would had the entire System been
stainless steel. This well-knoun effect is termed dissimilar-metal cor-

rosion and has been noted in both salt and liquid m.t-z'ta.l-syste_ms,-lo»'11

Corrosion Mechanism and Mode

Our interpretation of the catsstrOPhic corrosion that occurred
selectively on austenitic stainless steel in this dissimilar-metal test
system is consistent with related thermodynamic and electrochemical |
phenomena., Examination of Table 6 shows that the elements removed from
the stainless steel are those whose fluorides are more stable than-NiFg,
This is in agreement with Bakish and Kern'? who found almost all the
chromium and most of the iron removed from Inconel 600 exposed to
20% K,TaF,; in equimolar KCl-NaCl at 800°C. Measuring galvanic cells
with a molten KC1l-NaCl-KF electrolyte, they found the nickel electrode

surementsl3 of electrode potéhtials'in molten fluorides agree qualitaQ
tively with Bakish and Kern's data and our corrosion results.

Thus, it is clear that the corrosive action of a fluoride salt on

an alloy with or without dissimilar-metal mass transfer is fundamentally

an electrochemlcal process whereln some or all of the alloy constltuents

are oxidlzed to thelr 1onic state with the formatlon of fluorlde com-
pounds. The rate may ‘be controlled by elther solld-state ‘diffusion or
boundary-layer dlffus1on, w1th the attack concentrated at reglons of

highest energy,_such as graln boundaries,'subgraln boundarles, certain

: crystallographlc planes, and dislocatlons.

Summary

The severe corrosion of type 304-staiﬁ1ess steel exposed to a
fluoroborate salt in an Inconel 600 system was interpreted. Drawing
analogies from similar systems we conclude that the mainICause_of the
catastrophic corrosion was dissimilar-metal corrosion. The stainless
steel was the least noble part of the test system and thus suffered the
brunt of the attack. However,'we believe that the corrosion of stain-
1ess_steel in en 8ll-stainless-steel system by fused fiuoroborate salt
of the impurity level that existed in this case would still be exces-
sive. We showed that from cemparison of free energies and electrode
potentials one can predict the relative stability of the constituents
of an alloy in qued.fluorides;'

 CONCLUSIONS

1. Type 304 stainless steel in an Inconel 600 system in the tem-
perature range 540 to 690° C was severely corroded by NaBF4—8 mole % NaF.

2. The fact that the type 304 stainless steel.was the least noble
part of an Inconel 600 system increased the amount of corrosion.

3. 'The mode of ettack invelves leaching large quantities of Cr, Fe,
Mg, and Si from the stainless steel leaving a highly ferromagnetic

nickel alloy. _
4. The order of element removal in type 304 stainless steel by

the fused sodium fluoroborate salt is in agreement with electrode poten-
tial measurements and free energy data .in other halide salt systems and
also is in agreement with other corrosion studies. B
5. Type 304 stainless steel in an all-stainless-steel system -
exposed to fluordborate salt of the impurlty level used in these
experiments would corrode too much to be useful in engineering systems.

- ' . RECOMMENDATTONS

1. 'This experience emphasizes the necessity for more careful con-
trol over materials being placed in & system containing a relatively

uncharacterized fused fluoride salt.

"

2. In our judgment, low corrosion in nickel- and iron-containing
alloys is favored by decreasing chromium and iron éoncentrations; that
is, in order of decreﬁsiﬁg corrosion resisfance, we find modified
Hastelloy N (containing no iron), Hastelloy N, Inconel 600, and stain-
less steel. While the general use of Hastelloy N alloys in the
Inconel PKP-1l loop service is recommended, dissimilar-metal corrosion

effects prohibit the use of any alloy less noble than Inconel 600.
