ABSTRACT

Heat-transfer coefficients were determined experimentally for
a proposed MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,;67.5-20.0-12.0-0.5
mole %) flowing by forced convection through a 0.18-in.-ID hori-
zontal, circular tube for the following range of variables:

Reynolds modulus 400 — 30,600
Prandtl modulus L — 14

Average fluid temperature (°F) 1050 — 1550

Heat flux (Btu/hr.ft?) 22,000 — 560, 000

Within these ranges, the heat- transfer coefficient was found
to vary from 320 up to 6900 Btu/hr-£t®.°F (Nusselt modulus of 6.5
to 138). Correlations of the experimental data resulted in the
equations:

INTRODUCTION

The de51gn of molten salt reactors requlres detailed information

about the tranSport properties of the proposed fuel coolant and'blanket
mlxtures. Although the molten salts generally_behave as normal fluids

with respect to heat transfer,l'2 the possibility of unexpected effects,
 

 

 

 

such as nonwetting of metallic surfaces or the formation of low-conductance
surface films, indicates that heat-transfer measurements for specific re-
actor salts are needed.® This report describes heat-transfer experiments
with a proposed reactor fuel of mixed fluoride salts (LiF-BeFpThF,-UF,;
67.5-20.0-12.0-0.5 mole %). The technique employs forced convection of
the liquid salts through a smooth thin-walled Hastelloy N tube. Resist-
ance heating supplies the tube with a uniform heat flux. This method is
particularly well suited to the molten salt system because the electrical
,resiStapce of the molten salt is very large”compared with that of the
metal tube. Furthermore, the resistance of Hastelloy N remains nearly
constant over the entire temperature range of the measurements, which
simplifies the achievement of an axially uniform heat flux. In additionm,
a conétant heat capacity of the molten salt in the observed temperature
range makes possible several convenient assumptions in the calculation of

local fluid bulk temperatures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS

- The apparatus for studying heat transfer with the molten'salt system
is shown schematically in Fig. 1 and in the photograph, Fig. 2. Molten
salt flows by means of gas pressure through a small diameter, electrically
heated test section. The floﬁ of molten salt alternates in direction as
pressure from an inert gas supply is added to either of two storage ves-
sels located at each end of the test channel. Each 6-gal salt reservoir
is suspended from a weigh cell whose recorded signal indicates the flow
rate. The flow of salt reverses automatically by the action of solenoid
valves that control the flow of inert gas to the reservoirs. The rate of
flow of the salt may.be varied from 0.25 to 1.7 gal/min, emptying a
reservoir in from 3 to 20 minutes. )

| The weigh cell circuit shown in Fig. 3 illustrates the electrical
and mechanical systems that control the flow of gas and thereby the flow
‘of molten salt. A second suspension system maintains tension on the test
section, to prevent it from sagging, by means of counter weights connected
by‘flexible cables. The test section consists of a smooth Hastelloy N
_tube, 24.5 in. long, 0.25-in. outside diameter, and 0.035~in.-wa114 |

thickness and is resistance heated with a 60 Hz ac power supply. A

detail of the mixing chambers located at each end of the test section is
shown in Fig. A-1l, Appendix A. The electrodes connecting the test section
with the power circuit serve also as end plates of the disk-and-donut
mixing chambers. The power circuit to the test section is shown in Fig. &4,
The electrical power to the test section is supplied by a hh0/25 v, 25 kva
transformer and is measured with a General Electric watt transducer, also
‘shown in Fig. 4. The test section is insulated with a 3-in.-thick 1ayer
of vermiculite powder containedrin’afsheet metal tray. The salt reservoirs
and connecting tubes are heated by auxiliary clamsheil and Calrod heaters
placed in positions indicated in Fig. 1. A typicaljheater circuit for an
auxiliary heater is depicted in Fig. 5. h , |

The inlet and outlet salt temperatures are measured by four, 4hQ-mil-
diam, Chromel-Alumel sheathed thermocouples inserted into two wells in
each mixing chamber (Fig. A-1). The temperature distribution along the
test section is measured by a series of 24 Chromel-Alumel thermocouples
(0.005-in.~diam wire) spot welded at 1-in. intervals to the outside tube
wall. The scheme for attaching these thermocouples is shown in Fig. A-2.

Details of a salt reservoir can be seen in Fig. A-3. The interior
of these tanks as well as the test section and the mixing chambers are
stress relieved and hydrogen fired before they are assembled.

A data acquisition system provides for the automatic monitoring of
the temperatures; record is made by a papef printout-and a paper tape
punch. In this system a multichannel Vidar data recorder reads emf
signals from each thermocouple, from the weigh cells, and from the power
circuit in a sequential switching arrangement known as a "crossbar
scanner." The manufacturer claims an accuracy of better than +0.5°F
for the Vidar system. The data recording equipment is shown schematically
in Fig. 6 and in a photograph in Fig. 7.

The weigh cell and wattmeter calibration curves and a list of per-
tinent experimental equipment may berfound in Appendix A as Fig. A-l,

Fig. A-5, and Table A-1, respectively.

OPERATING PROCEDURES

In preparation for the addition of the molten salt mixtures, the
system including the test section is heated to the desired temperature
level above the melting point of the salt mixture. Approximately 165 1b
of the molten salt is then introduced into one of the reservoirs by the
force of argon gas pressure. Salt is forced back and forth through the
test section as the operation of the apparatus is tested - for leaks,
blockages, thermocouple and data recording functioning, etc. After the
initial checkout procedure, the system is put on a standby mode by vent-

ing the gas pressure to the atmosphere and allowing the salt to siphon to

*
equal levels in both reservoirs. The standby mode is used to protect the

test-section thermocouples by minimizing the heating of the test section.

Before each run, temperatures in the test section are raised to about

1000°F over a period of 45 minutes and the salt flow is reestablished. A

fixed flow rate is established and power to the test-section heater is in-

creased to the desired heat flux. When the temperatures indicate steady-
state conditions, all parameters — power input, flow rate, and tempera-

tures — are continuously recorded. The flow of salt is reversed when one

'reservoir is nearly empty, and the heat flux is momentarily reduced to

about half the operating value to prevent a temperature excursion in the
test section at the time of zero flow. The upper range of flow rates is
limited by the time requiréd to empty one of the reservoirs. Whenever
the temperature exceeds the desired level, the system is allowed to cool
by reducing the power to the test section and other appropriate heaters.
Periodic calibrations of radial heat losses were made by measuring
the power. required to maintain an empty test section in an isothermal
condition as a function of temperature level. The information furnished
by thisd calibration is used in each run, when an isothermal check of the

test-section thermocouples is obtained at the desired temperature level

 

This procedure resulted in several salt leaks when a number of power

failures occurred during the standby condition. Melting of the confined
salt was invariably accompanied by rupture of the thin-walled tubing due
to the expansion of the salt upon partial melting. A better standby pro-

cedure would be to drain the salt into one reservoir, allowing unrestrained
expansion of the salt during melting if an unexpected freeze should occur.
 

 

12

with the hot salt flowing aﬁd‘only enough heat added‘to the test section
to equal the radial heat loss. In Fig. 8, typical test-section thermo-
couple readings from an isothermal run show a scatter band of +4°F about
the average outside wall temperature. The sheathed thermocouples in the
‘mixing chambers read;slightly higher during isothermal runs and are be-
lieved to be more accurate. Their readings, therefore, provide the basis
for standardization and the tube wall readings are corrected to this
standard. " | ‘

Extensive tests were condﬁcted to insure the reliability of the
'apparatus and experimental procedures. The first test-section tube pro-
duced erratic axial temperature patterns which did not improve with more
thermal insulation of the test section. Subsequently, the anomalous axial
temperature profiles were traced to the test section, in which a hole had
burned through the wall and had been repaired by welding. IExcessive weld
material protruding into the tube was thought to have disturbed the tem--
perature and velocity profiles. Replacement of the test section eliminated
the difficulty. , '

- Other possible sources of error were investigated during the search -
for the cause of the temperature irregularities. Electrical conduction
through the molten salt would result in additional heating of the salt,
but the ratio of the resistivity of the salt to that of the test section
is greater than 2500, indicating very little heat generated in the salt in
this manner Additional calculations of the radial temperature distri-
bution®* confirmed that not more than O. 2% of the power was expended by
electrical conduction in the salt.

Temperature variations due to free convection are believed to be
larger than those attributable to internal heating; but according to the
criterion of Shannon and DePew,® free convection in the horizontal test-
section p081t10n is insignificant compared with forced convection in the
range of Reynolds numbers described in this work.

As an additional check of nmatural-convection effects, the reactor
fuel salt experiments were repeated with the test section anchored in a
vertical position while other equipment arrangements'and operational pro-
cedures remained unchanged. The object of the change was to compare the

effects of free convection in the vertical and horizontal positions. A

crack developed in one of the piping connections to the test section
after 8 runs and repairs were not attempted. However, the results of

- the vertical runs did not show any difference.in the effect of free con-
vection as related to the orientatlon of the test sectlon The data are
presented later in the report and 1n‘Appendlx B. _ :

The possibility of heat conductlon losses to the electrodes at the
ends of the test section prompted calculatlons to be made based on the
conservative assumptions of max imum héat'flux and a minimum Reynolds'
numbér The results of these calculatlons show that the net heat con-
duction in the axial direction is less than 0.1% of the total heat gen-
erated in the test section at a dlstance of 0. 25 1n - from the entrance.

The electrical resistivity of the,Hastelloy N test-section tube
varies less than 1% in the temperéttre‘range-of;lbOO to 1500°F and the
heat capacity of the salt varies less than 5% ovér;fhersame temperature
raenge. The variation of the radial heat loss along 1éhgth of tube is
less than 10% and the'heat loss itself is less than 5%. A constant axial
voltage drop measured aldng the test section verified the uniformify of
the heat flux generated in the test-section ﬁalf,and-provided a check of
~the wall thickness and tube radius variation‘as-a?fﬁnction of its length.'

Experiments conducted with a well-known heat-transfer salt (HTS)”
provided a final test in the new test section of the experimentél pro-
cedure. Earlier experiments® showed that HTS data are well correlated
by standard heat-transfer'equations. The experiments with HTS in the
present system demonstrated that the outside wall temperatures remained
parallel to the mean salt temperature over half of the tést;éection length,
indicating fully developed flow and a constant heat-~transfer coefficient.

In 11 runs with HIS, the experimentally determined values of the heat-
transfer coefficient were compared with those predicted by standard cor-
relations. Ten of the values of the heat-transfer coefficient were |
within’l3% of that predicted by the Sieder-Tate correlation® and the other
value was within 25%. Before the system wﬁs.charged with reactor salts,
the HTS was removed by extensively flushing with water and drying in

heated vacuum for 10 days.

The only variable on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is the thermal con-
ductivity of the metal wall, Kk , which remains nearly constant. over small
temperature rises along the tube.  Thus, when the temperature profiles
tw and tm are parallel, the fluid flow in the tube 1s essentlally fully
developed.

For most of the measurements, the heat gained by the fluid in

traversing the test section was calculated by the equation

~For the later messurements (Runs 210 through 220), the heat gained by the
fluid was determihed‘from the eiectrical heat generation in the‘test
section corrected for the calibrated heat loss. By calculating the heat
input in this manner, the influence of the uncertainties in measuring the
fluid mixed-mean inlet and outlet temperatures can be reduced.

The computer  program used for reducing the experimental data is given

~in Appendix C.

RESULTS

Heat-transfer coefficients were determined experimentally in 7O runs
covering the laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes. Ten rﬁns
with HTS to test the eéuipment are included with data shown in Appendix B.
The physical properties and chemical analyses of the molten salt are listed
in Appendix D, Tables D-1 and D-2, respectively.

between the mean inlet and mean outlet fluid temperatures by assuming con-
stant phys1cal pr0perties of the molten salt and uniform heat transfer
over the inner surface of the test-seetlon wall. These assumptions are
supported by the constant heat capacity of the molten salt in the observed

Three regions of N are shown in Fig. 9 — the laminar, transition,
and turbulent at NRe-= 597, 4277, and 28,10k, respectively. The co-
efficient of heat transfer hx assumes its limiting value rapidly for
turbulent flow; but in laminar and transition flows, a significant
entrance region is evident. This entrance region is seen more clearly
 when h_is plotted versus the distance along the test section x as in
Fig. 10 for the transition flow run. After the thermal and hydrodynamic
boundary layers become fully developed, h.x decreases to a limiting value.
The test section is not long enough for hx to reach the limiting value
in laminar flow. Therefore, integrated values of hx over the entire tube
length, coupled with the parameter D/L, are used in developing the lam-
inar flow correlations; whereas, the limiting constant h values are used
for the transition and turbulent heat-transfer correiations.

Standard heat-transfer correlations for the three flow regimes are
given in the following discussion of Egs. (4) through (8). Heat-transfer
data from the 70 runs are then presented in the dimensionless forms of
standard correlations for comparison using the data listed in Appendix B
and the physical properties in Table D-1.

1. For laminar, forced flow in the absence of natural convection,

the equations of Sieder and Tate® and Martinelli and Boelter® are,

respectively:

N = 1.86 [N, N (D/L)1 2 (p/u )0t (4)
and

Ny, = 1.62 [N N, (D/1)}° . (5)

2. For transition region flow beyond the entrance region, a modified

form of Hausen equatior® is:

Equations (%), (6), and (8) are compared with the eiperimental data
in Fig. 11. The experiﬁental results are in good agreement in the laminar
region but are slightly below the equations representing the transition
and turbulent regions. For example, in the range 3500 < NRe <_30,000, the
data lie about 13% below Egs. (6) and (8). The heat-transfer data could
not be correlated in the transition range 2000 < Nﬁe < 4000 because of
entrance effects that persisted over the length of the test section. The
laminar date do not fit Eq. (5) as well as Eq. (4), as shown by comparing
Figs. 12 and 11. Similarly, Eq. (7)'provides'no significant improvement
in the correlation of the data for Np > 10,000 over that of Eq. (8)
[compare Figs. 13 and 11]. . |

where K and n are dimensionless constants having different values for
laminar and turbulent flows and the "ordinate™ is the ordinate used in
Fig. 11. Least-squares fits of the data to the form of Eq. (9) were
carried out assuming a constant value (1/3) for the Prandtl modulus
exponent. These fits werertriéd with and without a viscosify ratio cor-

was included, the values for the Reynolds modulus exponent, n, came
closer to the commonly accepted values of 1/3 for laminar fiow and 0.8

for turbulent flow. The resulting equations fitting the experimental

Because the data in the transition region did not follow the form

of Eq. (9), the equation for the experlmental data in this range of Ny

was obtained by adjusting the coefficient 1n Eq (6), giving the following

relation: . |

Re

The heat-transfer measurements made with the test section oriented in
a vertical position to test for the possible effects of free convection
are in good agreement with the standard correlations, except for four
higher points (see Figs. 11 and 13). These higher points were obtained
with downflow in contradiction to the predicted enhancement of heat trans-
fer with upflow. Thus, a systematic thermocouple error in one of the
mixing chambers is the most probable cause of the higher results with
downflow. |

DISCUSSION

The results indicate that the proposed reactor fuel salt behaves as
a normal fluid in the range 0.5 < N?r < 100 with regard to heat transfer.
It should be noted that uncertainties in the physical properties of the
salts reflect as great an effect on the correlations as does the un-
certainty in the heat-transfer coefficient.

Our data lie below the standard correlations in the turbulent and
transition regions but not in the laminar region. If the deviations in
our data were caused by low-conductance surface films or entrained gas,
one would expect the effect to be apparent in all three regions. An un-

certainty in the viscosity of the salt might explain the discrepancies in

the turbulent and the transition regions since the heat-transfer function

in the laminar region i1s almost independent of the viscosity. 1In addition,

the lower values in the transition regime could be the result of the failure

of the thermal boundary layer to fully develop over the length of the test

section. '
The problem of boundary-layer development is most pronounced in the

range of Reynolds number 2000 < NRe < 4000, where entrance effects

persisted for the entire length of the test section. The same effect

could be produced up to No_ = 5000 at higher wall heat fluxes. Figure 14

illustrates the apparent effect of heat flux on the entrance region length.

At N = 3762 and a wall heat flux of 2.55 X 10° Btu/hr.ft®, there is no

region of constant heat-transfer coefficient. In contrast, temperature

profiles at a similar Reynolds number, Nﬁe = 3565 and the lower wall heat

flux of 0.74 X 10° Btu/hr-ft® show a constant heat-transfer coefficient

over most of the test-section length. Since the viscosity of the fluid

decreases with increasing temperature, heat transfer from the tube wall

may be exerting a stabilizing effect on the laminar boundary 1ayer,9'1°

thus delaying transition.

Future experiments with the fuel salt should include system modi-

fications so that the entrance region effects in transition flow can be

better evaluated. Possible modifications would be the insertion of an

‘unheated calming section prior to heat addition to permit establishment

of the hydrodynamic boundary layer before changing the temperature pro-
file., This would separate the two effects that now occur simultaneously.
Another possibility would be to increase the length of the test section
while maintaining a constant heat flux élong theAléngth. A sufficiently
long tube might allow fully developed flow pattefns-to be‘reached before

the test-section exit.

CONCLUSIONS

We have found molten fluoride salt mixtures to behave, for the most
part, as normal fluids with respect to forced-convection heating in a
smooth tube. Although the present results average ~13% below the standard
literature heat-transfer correlations, one must realize that some un-
certainties exist in the physical properties of the salt and that the
standard correlations themselves are based on heat-transfer data using
fluids such as air, steam, water, petroleum, etc., which exhibit a +20%
scatter band around the standard curves.

No evidence of the existence or influence of low-conductance surface
films, such as corrosion products, gases, or oxides, was found in the
present studies. In the Reynolds modulus range from 2000 to 5000, we did
find the heat-transfer coefficient to vary along the length of the tube
in a manner which appeared related to a delay in the transition to tur-
bulent flow. We believe this delay inrtransition is abetted by the
stabilizing influence of heating a fluid whose viscosity has a large
negative temperature coefficient. We intend to make further studies of

this phenomenon.
