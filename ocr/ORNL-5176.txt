RARE-EARTH FISSION PRODUCTS FROM A MOLTEN-SALT
BREEDER REACTOR FUEL SALT

~ ABSTRACT

In the metal transfer process for removal of rare-earth_
fission products from the fuel salt of a molten-salt breeder
-reactor - (MSBR), the rare earths are extracted from the molten
fuel salt into a molten bismuth solution containing lithium and
thorium metal reductants, transferred from the bismuth into
molten lithium chloride and, finally, recovered from the
lithium chloride by extraction into molten bismuth containing
lithium,reductant. '

 

Engineering experiments using mechanically agitated, non-
dispersing contactors with salt and bismuth flow rates [V 1% of
‘those required for processing the fuel salt from a 1000-MW(e)

MSBR] have been conducted (1) to study this process, (2) to measure
the removal rate of a representative rare-earth fission product
(neodymium) from MSBR fuel salt, and (3) to evaluate the mechanically
agitated contactor for use in a plant processing fuel salt from

a 10004MW(e) MSBR.

_ The experimental equipment and procedures are described
Results obtained during five experiments in which the rare earth
neodymium was extracted from MSBR fuel salt are presented. '
Removal rates and mass-transfer coefficients between the salt and
bismuth phases were determined for neodymium and are discussed in
terms of the processing requirements for a 1000-MW{e) MSBR.

1. 'INT'ROI)UCTION |

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has ‘been engaged in developing

a molten-salt breeder reactor that would operate on the 232 233

fuel cycle to produce low-cost power while producing more fissile

material than is consumed The reactor ‘would use a molten fluoride
salt mixture as the ‘fuel and graphite as the moderator. "In order for
the reactor to be operated as a breeder it would be necessary to |
remove the rare-earth fission products on a 25- to 100-day cycle and

233Pa from the region of high neutron flux during its decay
 

 

-2~

to 233U. Thus = an on-31te processing plant that continuously removes k‘,f
the protactinium and rare earths is required for the reactor to

perform as a breeder. o .

The fuel salt for a single-fluid MSBR! |

71.67-16-12-0.33 mole 7 LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, and contains ?23paF, and

rare~earth fluoride fission products. In the reference flowsheet

has the composition

for the processing plant, fuel salt is removed from the reactor at
a rate of about 0.9 gpm. The salt is firstlfed to a fluorinator
where "about 99/ of the.uranium is removed as UF6 The salt stream
leaving the fluorinator is contacted with bismuth that contains
lithium and thorium reductants in order to extract protactinium and
the remaining uranium. The salt‘stream, essentially free of uranium
and protactinium but containing the rare-earth fission products, is
then fed to avrare—earth:remOVallsystem where the rare-earth fission
products are extracted before returningﬂthe fuel salt to the reactor.
The equilibrium concentration of the rare earths in the salt from
the reactor is about 100 ppn for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR; rare-earth
removal times range from 25 to 100 days.

Engineering experiments to study a recently developed rare-earth

2,3 called the metal transfer process, have been_

removal system,
conducted over the past several years. In this method, the rare earths
are extracted from the fuel'salt.into bismuth containing lithium and
thorium reductants, transferred from the .bismuth into molten lithium
chloride and, finally, recovered from the lithium chloride by
extraction into molten bismuth containing lithjum reductant.
Mechanically agitated salt-metal contactors bave been investigatedl"5
for use in the MSBR processing systems based on reductive extraction.
This typepof contactor is of particular interest for the metal transfer
process since adequate mass—transfer rates may be possible without
dispersal of the salt and bismuth phases. Eliminating phase dispersal
considerably reduces the problem of entrainment of bismuth in the
processed fuel carrier salt and subsequent transfer to the reactor,
which is constructed of a nickel-base alloy that is subJect to damage
by metallic bismuth. The bismuth in this type of contactor would be
a near—isothermal internally circulated captive phase that- Would ‘ts)

minimize the occurrence of mass—transfer corrosion. Also, it is believed

 
 

 

 

3=

that a processing system employing this type of contactor can be more
easily fabricated of graphite, which is required for bismuth containment,
than one using packed columns. -

Operation and test results of engineering—scale experiments,
utilizing the metal transfer process and mechanically agitated contactors,
are described in this report. These experiments incorporated all the
steps in the metal tranSfer process using salt flow rates that were
about 1% of those required for processing'the fuel salt from a 1000-

MW(e) MSBR. The goals of the experiments were (1) to study the various
steps of the process, (2) to measure the rate of removal of representative
rare-earth fission products from the molten-salt reactor fuel, and (3)

to determine the suitability of mechanically agitated contactors for

this process. For this evaluation, mass-transfer coefficients between

the salt and metal phases in the system were determined using representative

rare~earth fission products.

2. METAL TRANSFER PROCESS

In the metal transfer process, fluoride fuel salt that is free
of uranium and protactinium is first contacted with molten bismuth
containing lithium and thorium_as-reductants at concentrations of
about 0.002 and 0.0025 m.f., respectively. ‘The rare earths are
extracted into the bismuth. The bismuth that contains the rare earths
and thorium is then contacted with molten lithium chloride; and,
because of highly favorable distribution coefficients, the rare
earths distribute selectively, relative to thorium, into the LiCl.
The final step of the process consistsxof extraeting'tne_rare earths
from the LiCl by contact.with molten bisnuth conteining lithium
reductant at concentratlons of 5 to 50 at. . |
. The chemical reactions that represent each step of the process o
are given below, using a trivalent rare earth_as an example:

The equilibria for these reactions have been measured and expressed

_as distribution coefficients for the rare earths between the fuel

carrier salt and bismuth containing lithium as a reductant and as

distribution coefficients of thorium and rare earths between 1ithium

chloride and bismuth containing lithium. 6,7 The distribution

coeffic1ent is defined as

D, - (4)

M

é’"‘”

where .
'DM = distribution coefficient,

Xy = mole fraction of metal M in the bismuth phase,

XMXn = mole fraction of the metal halide in the salt phase.

Under conditions of interest, the distribution coefficients have

been found to be dependent on the lithium concentrations as follows:
. . * .
log Dy = n log gLi + log Ky | (5)
where

n = valence of metal Mn+ in the salt phase,
XLi = mole fraction of lithium in the bismuth phase,

Kﬁ = constant at a given temperature.

Calculated values of rare earth~-thorium separation factors
between the bismuth and LiCl salt range from about 104 to 10% for
divalent and trivalent rare earths based on the measured distribution
coefficients.

One version of a flowsheet for removing rare earths from MSBR
fuel salt using the metal transfer process is shown in Fig. 1. Using
this method, uranium- and protactinium—free'fuel salt from the
protactinium removal step is fed to a series of contactor stages

through which bismuth'containing dissolved reductant is circulated.

The bismuth in each of these fuel-salt contactor stages also circulates

through a corresponding lithium chloride contactor stage within a

series of contactors through which a lithium chloride stream flows. ( ;
This lithium chloride stream, in turn, circulates through a single

lithium stripper solution.

An advantage of this arraﬁgement is that the fuel salt--bismuth
contactors and the lithium chlBride-—bismuth'contactors can be
constructed contiguous to one another, and the bismuth can be made
to flow between the two by'fhe pumping actioﬂ'Of the agitators (described
in experiments MTE-3 and MTE-3B in Seét. 3). Thus in this method, the
need for external bismuth pumbs is eliminated. Another advantage is
that the bismuth is this type of contactor w@ﬁld be a near-isothermal,
captive phase that would minimizg the occurrence of mass-transfer
corrosion. |

Although other variations can be gynthesiZed, the removal rates
of neodymium measured in experiment MTE-3B are discussed in terms of
processing requirements for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR using tﬁe flowsheet
shown”in Fig. 1.

3. DESCRIPTION OF METAL TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS MTE-3 AND MTE-3B

3.1 Process Vessels and Equipﬁent

The basic equipment used in the experiments (shown diagrammatically
in Fig. 2), consisted of three carbon steel vessels: (1) a 1l4-in.
(0.36-m)-diam fluoride salt reservoir containing the fuel carrier
salt (72-16-12 mole 7 LiF'BEFZ"ThFA)’"a 10-in. (0.25-m)~diam salt-
metal contactor, and a 6-in. (0.15-m)-diam rare-earth stripper. A
photograph ﬁf the process equipment is shown in Fig. 3. The salt-
metal contactor is divided into two equal compartments by a carbon
steel partition that separates the fluoride and LiCl §alts. A 1/2-in.
(13~mm)-high slot at the bottom of the partition interconnects
the captive pool of bismuth-lithium-thorium solution in the contactor.
Mechanical agitators in both compartments of the contactor and in the
stripper were used to improve contact between the salt and bismuth
phases. Four-bladed turbines, 2-7/8-in. (73 mm) in:diameter and having
a pitch of 45°, were located in each phase. A photograph of the
agitators is shown in Fig. 4., The blade mounting and shaft rotation
were such that the salt and bismuth flows were directed toward the (asj
interface. The engineering drawings used in the construction of the

metal transfer experiments are listed in Table 1.

The outside surfaces of the carbon steel vessels were coated with
" 0.015-in. (0.4~mm)-~thick chromium--nickel--6% aluminum oxidation-
resistant material (METCO* No. P443;10) using a plasma spray gun. This
prevented air oxidation of the'carbon steel vessels at the operating
temperature of Vv 923 K.

Fuel salt was circulated between the fluoride salt reservoir and
one side of the contactor by means of a specially designed gas-operated
pump utilizing molten bismuth check valves. Lithium chloride was
circulated between the stripper and the other side of the contactor by
alternately pressurizing and venting the stripper vessel. The bismuth
phase in the contactor was circulated between the two compartments in
the contactor by the action of the agitators, and no direct measurement of
this flow rate was made during experiments. However, measurements made in
a mockup using a mercury-water system indicated that the bismuth flow
rate between the two compartments would be high enough to cause the rare-
earth concentrations in the compartments to be essentially equal.8
The salt flow rates used were about 1% of those required for processing the
fuel salt from a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

Approximate quantities of salt and bismuth used in the experiment
were the following: (1) 110 kg of fluoride salt and 64 kg of bismuth-
lithium~-thorium (containing about 0.0018 atom fraction lithium and
0.0014 atom fraction thorium) in the contactor, and (2) 10 kg of lithium
chloride and 44 kg of bismuth-lithium (containing 0.05 atom fraction
lithium) in the stripper.

3. 2"ExperimentalfProcedures;-

Procedures for the makeup, purification, and addition of the
salt and bismuth phases to the process vessels were designed to minimize
contamination of these materials With oxide (air water and any oxides

present in the carbon steel process vessels). Prior to the addition of

_ the salts and bismuth the internal surfaces of all vessels were treated

with hydrogen at 923 K to reduce residual iron oxides. (Mbst of these

oxides had been removed by sandblasting during fabrication.) After
this treatment, a purified_argon'atmosphere (v 0.1 ppm of'ﬁzo)'was
maintained in the vessels to preclude further oxidation.

*METCO, Incf, 1101 Prospect Avenue, Westburg,‘Long Island, N.Y.

 
 

-12-

The salt and bismuth solutions'were made up in auxiliary vessels (also \~ﬁj
treated with hydrogen) at v 923 K to remove oxides). The bismuth was
hygrogen treated at n 923 K, while the fluoride salt and LiCl salt
were contacted with bismuth containing thorium for oxide removal. After
makeup and purification, all solutions were filtered by passing through a
sintered molybdenum filter (Vv 30-u pore-diameter) during transfer
from the auxiliary vessels into the process vessels. After the process
vessels had been charged with the salt and bismuth solutioms, the entire
system was maintained at temperatures above the liquidus temperature
¢ 890'K) of the solutions.
The experimental procedure was essentially the same for each run.
The rare earth for which the mass transfer rate and overall mass transfer
coefficients were to be measured was added to the fluoride salt, the .
agitators were started and adjusted to the desired speed, circulation
of the fluoride salt and LiCl was started, and the salt and bismuth phases
were periodically sampled during the run period and analyzed for rare-
earth content. In each run, trace quantities of a radioactive isotope
wete included in the rare-earth addition, and counting of the radio-
activity of the samples was used to follow the transfer rate.
Samples of the salt and bismuth phases were taken using a small
(v O.4-cm3) stainless steel sampling capsule with a sintered metal
filter (v 20-u pore-diameter). ‘A 1/16-in. (0.16-mm)-diam capillary
tube attached to the capsule was used for inserting it into the solution
to be sampled (see Fig. 5). During insertiod, the capsule was
continuously purged with purified argon gas until it was positioned in
the solution. The flow of purge gas was then stopped, and a sample was
taken by applying a vacuum to the capsule. When the molten salt or
bismuth solution reached the dpper, cool section of the capillary tube, it
sblidified The'sample was then withdrawn into the sample pott and
allowed to cool under an argon atmosphere before removal.
All runs in the second experiment MTE—3B were made using the rare
earth neodymium. In these runs, trace amounts (50 to 150 mCi) of 147
were included in the neodymium added to the experiment. 'Nedemium
concentration 1n each phase was determined by counting the O. 53—MeV
47Nd in the sample. In addition, the total &ﬁ?)

neodymium contents of selected samples were determlned by an isotopic

gamma emitted by the |

dilution mass spectrometry technique. This proved to be a valuable means

of checking on the tracer counting results and was especially useful khwj
for those samples with very low neodymiqm concentrations (< 1 ppm),
- where counting techniques were inadequate. ,

For runs in the initial experiment MTE-3, in which the rare earths
europium, lanthanum, and neodymium were used, counting of the 1.28-MeV
gamma emitted from the 154Eu tracer was used‘to follow the transfer
rate, and the lanthanum concentration was determined by neutron activation
and subsequent counting of the.laoLa produced. 7

This report primarily describes the resuifs obtéinéd_using the rare
earth neodymium in the second metal transfer experiment,‘MTE—BB. The
first experiment, MTE-3, was conducted by others and reported

9,10

previously; results are summarized for comparison with MTE-3B

results.

4. ANALYSIS OF DATA

Experiment MTE-3B involved the successive transfer of rare earth
from a fluoride salt to a bismuth~lithium-thorium pool,‘to:a lithium
chloride salt, and, ultimately, to a bismuth-lithium pool. The rate at
- which the rare earth was tfansferred through the several contactor stages
was governed by the equilibrium distribution coefficient of the rare
earth, the salt and bismuth flow rates, and the mass-~transfer
coefficients. The determination of these mass~transfer coefficients was
one of the major requirements for meeting the objectives of the experiment.
An idealized sketch of the contactor arrangement for the experiment is
shown in Fig. 6.
From a rare-earth material balance in each of the seven regions
indicated in Fig. 6, the following equations governing the movement of

rare earth through the regions were derived:

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS | . ;

Four runs (Nd-1, -2, -3;-and -4) using the rare earth neodymium as
a representative fission product were completed in metal transfer
experiment MTE-3B. 'Neodymium was chosen as the representative rare-
earth fission product for the studies in MTE-3B for several reasons:
1. Neodymium is one of the more important trivalent fission
products to be removed frbm a molten-salt breeder reactor:
fuel salt.

2. The use of 147

Nd tracer with its relatively short half-life (11
days) would prevent excessive levels of radiocactivity in the

147Nd tracer; was

experiment (additional neodymium, containing
added during the studies).

" 3. Results could be compared with those obtained using neodymium
in the first experiment, MTE-3.

Data from Nd-1, -3, and -4, were analyzed, and overall mass—-transfer
coefficients at the three salt-metal interfaces were determined. Mass-—
transfer Coeffidients were not determined in experiment Nd-2 due to
unexpected entrainment of fluoride salt into the LiCl in the contactor.
Entrainment of fluoride salt into the LiCl affects the equilibrium
distribution coefficients of the rare earths and thorium between the
LiCl and bismuth phases such that thorium is transferred into the LiCl.11
Entrainment also occurred during run Nd-1; however, the amount of fluoride
salt entrained was relatively small (v 1.3 wt Z F in the LiCl), and the
distribution coefficients measufed at the end of run Nd-1 were near the
expected values. During run Nd-2, the cumulative amount
of fluoride salt entrained (v 3 wt 7%) became significant. The
distribution coefficients (particularly for thorium at the LiCl-bismuth
interface in the contactor) were reduced, and a significant quantity of
thorium was transferred into the LiCl and was subsequently circulated into
the stripper, where it reacted with the lithium reductant in the Bi-Li
solution. This reaction continued until most of the lithium reductant
was lost from the stripper and the neodymium was no longer extracted
into the Li~Bi in the stripper, Extraction of neodymium stopped after |
about 50 hr of operation of run Nd-2; thus no determination of mass-

transfer coefficients could be made. y ' ' K )

 
 

 

 

-19-

Because of the entrainment of fluoride salt into the LiCl during runs
Nd-1 and Nd-2, it became necessary to remove both the LiCl from the
contactor and stripper and the bismuth--5 at. % Li from the stripper
after run Nd-2, Fresh LiCl and bismuth-lithium solution were charged to
the system before starting run Nd-3. |

5.1 Overall Mass-Transfer Coefficients and Equilibrium
Distribution Coefficients for Neodymium

Operating conditions and system parameters for runs Nd-1 through Nd-4
in metal transfer experiment MTE-3B are shown in Table 2. Results of
the determinations of overall mass-transfer coefficients for the rare earth
neodymium for‘runs Nd~1, -3, and -4 in metal transfer experiment MTE-3B
are given in Table 3. Values for the equilibrium distribution
coefficients for neodymium measured at the completion of each run,
during periods of no salt circulation, are shown in Table 4.

Previously reported values for overall mass-transfer coefficients for
europium, lanthanium, and neodymium obtained in the experiment, MIE-3,
are shown in Table 5 for reference.

Values for overall mass~transfer coefficients for neodymium at the
three salt-bismuth interfaces in metal transfer experiment MTE-3B (Table 3)
were obtained by selecting values for the mass-~transfer coefficients which
resulted in a "best fit" between the experimentally obtained concentrations
during each run and the calculated concentrations as discussed in Sect. 4.
The experimentally measured values for the equilibrium distribution coefficients
for neodymium between the salt and bismuth solutions were used in calculating
the "best fit" case. | a

- Results are shown in Figs. 8-18. In these figures, the experimental
data points are indicated for each solution, and the line shown represents
the "best fit" for the calculated concentrations during each run. Excellent
agreement was obtained for the fluoride salt solution and the bismuth--5
at. 7 lithium solution in the stripper for each run. For these solutions,
the data obtained by counting the O. 534MeV gamma emitted by the 147 d
tracer (with results expressed in disintegrations per minute per gram)

were used. Equally good agreement was obtained for the data obtained by
analysis for total neodymium in these two phases. The results obtained

by total neodymium analysis (ug/g) are shown for the bismuth—thorium—
lithium solution in the contactor and the LiCl in the contactor and stripper.

More scatter and fewer points appear in these data. However, it is felt &h,f
that the figures for the total neodymium content more nearly represent the

true concentration in these solutions since the results obtained by the

counting of samples from these solutions were unrealistically high (by a

factor of 3). The difficulty seemed to be a bias in the counting data

at these very low neodymium concentrations (< 1 ppm).

147

Tabulations of the concentrations of Nd tracer and the total

neodymium for all samples removed during runs Nd-1 through Nd-4 are included

in the Appendix.

5.2 Entraimment Studies in Experiment MTE-3B

Based on previous studies in-awater-mercury system,l5 it was

concluded that entraimment of fluoride salt intO'the‘bismuth'aﬁd LiCl phases
in the mechanically agitated contactor would occur if the agitators were
operafed at speeds of 5.0 rps or higher. However, in the first metal
transfer experiment, MTE-3, entrainment was not observed at 5.0 rps but
was seen at 6.7 rps.16
Since fluoride salt entrainment occurred at an agitator speed of 5.0
rps in experiment MTE-3B, a series of tests were made to determine the
maximum allowable agitator speed that could be used in experiment MTE-3B
without entrainment. The tests were conducted by operating the agitators
in the contactor at several different speeds (3.3, 4.6, and 5.0 rps) for
time periods ranging from v 50 to v 140 hr. During each test at
constant agitator speeds, samplgs of the LiCl salt were removed from the
contactor and analyzed for fluoride content. An increase in fluoride ion
concentration would indicate entrainment of fluoride salt into the LiCl.
Figure 19 shows the fluoride ion concentration in the LiCl as a function
of time for each agitator speed. The initial concentration of fluoride
ion of v 4 wt Z represents the amount of entrainment that occurred over
a period of Vv 250 hr during runs Nd-1 and Nd-2. The sequence of agitator
speeds shown in Fig. 19 represents the order in which the tests were run.
An increase in the fluoride ion concentration is clearly indicated in the
v 50-hr test at 5.0 rps. At agitator speeds of 3.3 and 4.6 rps, no
entrainment (within experimental limits) appears to have occurred over the

v 200-hr combined test periods'at these two speeds. . ; {

These results indicated that experiments could be carried out-at
agitator speeds up to about 4.5 rps without entrainment and experiments \__j
Nd-3 and Nd-4 were conducted using agitator speeds of 4.2 and 1.67 rps.
It was also concluded that rapid determinations of fluoride ion concentration
in the LiCl during experiments were needed to vérify that no entrainment was
occurring. For this purpose, an Orion Model 801A pH/mV meter* equipped with

specific ioh'(fluqride) electrodes was obtained for rapid analyses of LiCl
samples. The mV meter could also be used to continuously measure and

record the emf between the two bismuth phases in the contactor and
stripper vessels that contaiﬁed different concentrations of lithium
reductant (0.0015 and 0.050 atom fraction lithium). A change in emf would
indicate a change in the lithium concentratibn ratio injthese phases
(Sect. 5.3) with a resultant change in the equilibrium distribution
coefficient for neodymium and thorium between the salt and bismuth phases.

5.3 'Neodymium,and 147N& Inventory in Experiment MTE-3B

47

Weighed amounts of neodymium, as NdFB, containing 1 Nd tracer were
added to the fluoride fuel salt in the fuel salt reservoir on three
occasions during operation of metal transfer experiment MTE-3B. The NdF3

nd 147Nd tracer were prepared by the Isotopes Division of ORNL. The

a
NdF3 containing the tracer was placed in a specially designed charging
capsule used to add the neodymium to the fuel salt (Fig. 20). The
capsule was sealed by a spring-loaded disc which was soldered to the
capsule. When inserted into the molten fuel salt (923 K), the solder
melted and opened the capsule, allowing the-NdF3 to disperse into the
fuel salt. Capsules were inspected after each addition to ensure that
all of the neodymium had beeﬁ transferred into the fuel salt.

147Nd and total neodymium inventory during each run in metal
transfer experiment MTE-3B was followed by both counting and chemical
analyses of samples of the salt and bismuth phases. The concentration of
147Nd was determined by counting the 0.53-MeV gamma emitted, while the |
concentration of the total neodymium was determined by an isotopic dilution

mass-spectrometry technique,

Table 6 compares the neodymium and 147Nd inventory in metal '
transfer experiment MTE-3B based on the amounts added to the system and k"j
those calculated from the concentrations in all phases determined by
sampling. As seen in Table 6, the inventory of neodymium and 147Nd tracer
determined by sampling was “in good agreement with the amounts added,
varying between 84 and 100%Z for each of the four rums,

These results indicate thét (1) the losses of neodymium were
insignificant, (2)-the neodymium remained dispersed in the salt and bismuth
solutions, and (3) the sampling procedures provided samples that adequately
represented the concentrations of neodymium in the salt and_bismﬁth
solutions.

5.4 Lithium Reductant in the Bismuth Solutions in the
Contactor and Stripper

The equilibrium distribution coefficients for neodymium (and other
rare earths) between the salt and bismuth solutions in the metal transfer
process are dependent on the lithium reductant concentrations in the
bismuth solutions (Sect. 2). Therefore, mass-transfer coefficients for
the rare earths are dependent on these equilibrium distribution
coefficients.

During the runs in experiment MTE-3B, the concentrations of lithium
reductant in the bismuth solutions were known initially. The relative
concentrations of lithium in the bismuth in the contactor (v 0.0015 m.f.)
and in the stripper (v 0.05 m.f.) were determined during the experiments
by measuring the emf between these two bismuth solutions. The contactor
and stripper vessels are electrically isolated from each other by an |
electrically insulated "isolation flange,”" and the bismuth solutions
are connected by the molten LiCl that circulates between the contactor
and stripper. The relative concentrations of lithium in the bismuth

solutions can be calculated from the emf measurement by the following

equation:17

For the concentrations of lithium reductant in the bismuth phases
in experiments conducted in MTE-3B, the expeéted emf was v 275 mV.

Measurements of emf taken intermittently during runs Nd-1 and Nd-2
gradually decreased from v 360 mV to v 25 mV near the end of run Nd-2,
indicating loss of lithium reductant in the stripper (see Table 7).
(This loss of lithium in the stripper was Caused.by the entrainment Qf
fluoride fuel salt into the LiCl and by subsequent reaction of the
thorium in the fuel salt with the lithium. It resulted in no further
- extraction of neodymium as was observed.) |

In the final two experiments, Nd-3 and Nd-4, the—emf between the
contactor and stripper was followed continuously by using a recording
millivolt-meter. No entrainmént'of fluoride fuel salt occurred during
these runs,and the emf between the bismuth solutiohs remained essentially
constant at v 250 mV, indicating no significant change in the

concentrations of lithium reductant.
5.5 System Performance

Installation of metal transfer experiment MTE-3B was essentially
complete in February 1975. During March 1975, the process vessels were
pressure tested (both at room temperature and at an operating temperature
of v 923 K); and the internal surfaces of the process vessels and
charging vessels were-hydrogen treated at v 923 K to remove residual
oxides. After the hydrogen treatment, all vessels were maintained under
purified argon (v 0.1 ppm of Hy0) to prevent oxidation. The addition of
all salt and bismuth solutions to theprocess vessels was completed during
May 1975 with the_system at the operating temperature of ~ 923 K.

The initial experiments (Nd~-1 and Nd-Z) were carried out in June
1975, and, after removal of the LiCl from the contactor and stripper
and the removal of the bismuth--5 at. %Z lithium from the stripper, fresh
LiCl and bismuth--5 at. % lithium were added to the system. The final
two experiments (Nd-3 and Nd-4) were conducted during January 1976.

The system was not cooled to room temperature until the first week of
April 1976; thus the system was maintained at the operating temperature
~of v 923 K for about 11 months. The three agitatofs in the contactor (tij

and stripper vessels were operated for about 700 hr at speeds ranging-

between 100 and 300 rpm (1.67 to 5.0 rps) during this period. The thj
fluoride salt pump was in'dperation for v 295 hr, and LiCl circulation was
maintained for "~ 475 hr. With the exception of one of the agitator seals
which developed a leak and allowed inleakage of argon buffer gas into the
system shortly after terminationof the last run (Nd-4), all equipment
functioned withoﬁt incident throughout the life of the experiment.
Specifically, no heater, thermocouple, or Control.system malfunctions
occurred. Also, no leakage of salt or bismuth from the system was
observed. The outside surfaces of the carbon steel process vessels were
inspected after shutdown to determine the effectiveness of the oxidation-
resistant spray coating (METCO No. P443-10) in pfotecting these surfaces
against oxidation at the operating temperature. The outside surfaces
were found to be in excellent condition, with only a small amount of
oxide present.’

During the four runs conducted in metal transfer experiment MTE-3B,
807 samples of the salt and bismuth solutions were taken for analyses.
As discussed above, the sampling procedures adequately obtained

representative samples of the process solutions.
6. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The objectives of metal transfer process experiments MTE-3 and
MTE-3B were to measure the rate of removal of representative rare-earth
fission products from a molten-salt breeder reactor fuel salt and to.
evaluate the suitability of mechanically agitated contactors for the
metal transfer process. Thus it was nécessary to determiné the overall
mass—-transfer éoéfficients for rare earths at the three salt-bismuth
interfaces in the system and to study the effect of agitation'on the
transfer coefficients in stirred contactors.

In metal transfer process experiments MTE-3 and MTE-3B, only the
overall mass~-transfer coefficients were measured, as discussed in Sect. 4.
Results of individual mass-transfer coefficients in stirred contactors in
which the phases are not dispersed have been reported.s’ 18-20 .
these studies, mass~transfer coefficients in organic-water, mercury-water,
and LIF—BeFZ--ThF4 salt-bismuth systems were determined, and correlations Q‘P,

were developed which relate the individual mass-transfer coefficients for

 
 

 

 

~45-.

each phase to the properties of the solutions and system parameters such
as the size and speed of the stirrer. The reported dependence of the
mass-transfer coefficient on the agitator speed varied widely.

The overall mass-transfer coefficients obtained for neodymium
at the three ‘salt-bismuth interfaces in the five runs in experiments
MTE-3 and MTE-3B at agltator (stirrer) speeds ranging from 1.67 rps to 5.0
rps are shown in log-log plots in Figs. 21-23. Direct correlation of the
effect of agitator speed on mass-transfer coefficients cannot be made
because other system parameters — particularly the equilibriun
distribution coefficients for neodymium — were not the same for all runs.
Also, since the overall mass-transfer coefficients were determined by
simultaneous solution of seven differential equations to determine mass
balance, precise values for the three coefficients calculated for each
run are not possible.

Although there 1s a great deal of scatter in the data shown in Figs.
21 23, the overall mass-transfer coefficients generally increase with
increasing agitator speed as predicted. Direct comparison of selected
values from those runs in which only the agitator speed was changed
(e.g., runs 3 and 4) clearly shows an increase in the overall mass-.
transfer coefficients when the agitator speed was elevated from 1.67 to
4.17 rps. Similarly, a comparison of runs 6 and 7 (conducted in a
previous experiment MTE—S) shows an increase when the agitator speed was
elevated from 3.33 to 5,0 rps. A dashed line of slope 1 is included on
these figures for reference purposes only. Various cOrrelations developed
in the cited references indicate that mass-transfer coefficients are
proportional to agitator speed raised to a power between 0.9 and 1.65.

The overall mass-transfer.coefficients for rare earths across the
salt and blsmuth phases determined in experiments MTE-3 and MTE~3B were
only about 1 to 50% of those that would be predicted by currently
available correlations, with the largest discrepancy occurring at the
‘lithium chloride--bismuth interfaces. Further studies are required in
order to obtain correlations that would reliably,predict the overall mass—
transfer coefficients for stirred contactors if this type of contactor is
to be used in a full-scale processing plant to remove the rare-earth
fission products. In addition to the influence of agitator speed and
physical properties of the several solutions, the effect of scale-up

to larger processing equipment requires further investigation.

An important feature of the metal transfer process is the selective
separation of thorium from the rare earths at the bismuth——lithium

chloride interface. Rare earth-thorium separation factors, defined as

S /DRE’ - 7

RE-Th - Dth
have been determined to be in the range of 10% to 108 for the trivalent and
divalent rare earths.? Thus negligible loss of thorium from the fuel

salt occurs'in the process. Because of entrainment of the fluoride salt
into the LICl in experimenthTE+3B, it was not'possible to determine the
separation faCtor. However, during studies in the first experiment

MTE-3, in which-the rare earths europium, lanthanum, and neodymium were
used, the separation'factOrs were estimated based on the total amount of
thorium (< 10 wt ppm) found in the bismuth--5 at. % lithium alloy in the
stripper after about 400 hr of operation. Separation factors

4

DTh/D for these rare earths in the order of 10" to 106 were indicated

Preliminary calculations, us1ng a computer code developed by W. L.
Carter21 at ORNL, have been made to estimate the contactor size and
operating conditions that would be required in order to remove the
_rare-earth'fission products at the design rate22 from the reference MSBR.
For thesercalculations, the rare earth neodymium was chosen as a
representative example, The design removal rate of neodymium is v 1.2 g-
moles (v 174 g) per day for a breeding ratio of 1.06. (Note: Reducing
the rare-earth removal rate would not have a prohibitive'deleterious effect
on the breeding ratio —-a threefold reduction would lower the breeding
ratio by about 0.01. ) In these calculations, the effects of several
parameters (mass—transfer coefficients, interfacial area, salt and
bismuth flow rates, and number of extraction stages) on the removal rate
of neodymium were evaluated and a combination of parameters that would
be requ1red to meet the design removal rate was determined.

Results of these calculations are summarized in Table 8. The

cases shown were selected to indicate the effect of several variations on .7

~5

-neodymium removal rates.. The fuel-salt flow rate of 0. 9 gpm (5 7 X 10 pz"

3/sec) was held constant for all cases ‘since it is the de31gn fuel—salt Hﬂ}ﬂr_;

flow rate for the reference processing plant.‘ Three contactor stages

were used for a11 but one case since this seemed to be a reasonable compromise

based on~preliminary calculations. For case 1, the values of overall mass-

 
 

 -50-

transfer coerficients at the three salt-bismuth interfaces (K;» Ky, Ky) , u
are representative of those obtained in our experimental studies. The

area of 1 ft2 (0.093 m?) per stage, the bismuth flow rate of 3 gpm

(1.9 x 10-4 3/sec), and the LiCl flow rate of 30 gpm (1.9 x 10'"3

3/sec) were chosen as a basis for further extrapolation. As seen in

.Case 1, the neodymium removal rate of 0.003 g—mole/day is about a

factor of 400 below the design value of 1.2 g—moles/day., Increasing
overall mass-transfer coefficients at the LiCl—bismuth interfaces .

in the contactor and stripper by a factor of 5 (case 2) increased the _
removal rate by about a factor of 4 The effect of increasing the
interfacial contact areas to 10 and 20 ft2 (0 94 and 1.9 mz) is seen in
cases 3 and 4, and the effect of increasing the number of stages

from 3 to 6 is seen by comparing 4 and 5. The results from increasing
the bismuth and LlCl flow rates to 6 gpm (3.8 x 10 =4 3/sec) and

60 gpm (3 8 X 10 -3 m /sec) is seen in cases 7 and 9. In case 8 -

the overall mass—transfer coefficient, K, at the fluoride salt--bismuth,
interface is increased by a factor of 10.

Finally, the desired removal rate is reached by use of the parameters
shown in case 11. For the choices made, a neodymium removal rate of 1 37
gvmoles/day.is indicated for the following system:

saltrand bismuth-interfacial areas/stage‘= 20 fr2 (l.86 mz),

fluoride salt flow rate = 0.9 gpm (5.7 x 107> m%/sec),

bismuth flow rate = 18 gpm (1.1 X'10_37 2/sec),

 LiCl flow rate = 60 gpm (3.8 x 10 2/sec), ‘

Kl = 0;16 mm/sec, K

The values for K, and K, at the fluoride fuel salt--bismuth and LiCl--

1 2
bismuth interfaces in the contactor (case ll) are about a factor of

9 = 1.0 mm/sec, and K, = 4.0 mm/sec.

10 higher than those observed in metal transfer experiments, Results
from studies in the water-mercury contactors indicate that an increase
of about a factor of 10 in the mass—transfer coefficient might be
expected with increased agitator turbine diameter over those used in the
metal transfer experiments (1 4mvs Q. 073 m) 24 The value for K3 at

the_interface between the LiCl—-bismuth and_the 5 at. % lithium in the

stripper (case 11) is about a factor of 100 higher than that observed in

metal transfer_experiments.- This large increase would likely require ‘ }

 
 

 

-51-

increased agitation to the point of some degree of dispersion of the
salt and bismuth in the stripper; however, this would probably be
acceptable since the likelihood of bismuth entrainment back into the
fuel salt is minimal in the stripper vessel.

Other combinations of the various parameters could be used to achieve
the required removal rate of neodymium. Calculated results, shown in
Table 8, are intended to indicate'the effect of several parameters on
the removal rate in a full-sized multistage metal transfer process for the
removal of rare-earth fission products (using neodymium as an example)

from a 10004MW(e) MSER.

7. CONCLUSIONS

The objectives of themetal transfer procesS'experiments-were (1)
to study the various steps in the process, (2) to measure the rate of
removal of rare-earth fission products from the molten-salt reactor fuel,
and (3) to evaluate the euitability'of-a mechanically agitated contactor
for use in the process. - 7 ' |

Conclusions reiating to these objectives are as follows:

1. During 15.experimehts'in'engineering+scale process
equipment, representative rare-earth fission products
(europlum, 1anthanum, and neodymium) were. extracted from
'molten-salt breeder reactor fuel salt (72-16-12 mole Z
LiF-Ber—ThF4) and transferred into bismuth—llthium.alloy in
the stripper vessel.

2, Inm thoseexperiments1n which entrainment of fluoride salt into
the LiCl salt did not occur, the rare earths were selectively
transferred (with respect to thorium) into the bismuth~lithium
alloy. Separation factors of about 10% to 106 estimated in
these experiments compare favorably with predicted values of
about 104_to 108 7 '
negligible“loss-of'thdrium from the fuel salt would occur in the

for trivalent and divaient rare earths. Thus

process.
3. Overall mass-transfer coefficients measured at the three salt-

bismuth interfaces (fuel salt-bismuth, Bismuth—LiCl, and LiCl--

Bismuth-lithium) in the process were lower than would be required

for full-scale metal transfer process equipment of reasonable size.

APPENDIX A: SAMPLE ANALYSES FOR EXPERIMENT MTE-3B B \‘-’

147,

The concentrations of Nd tracer and total neodymium in each of

the seven salt and bismuth phéses in metal transfer experiment MTE-3B
during runs Nd-1 through Nd-4 are tabulated in Tables A-1 through A-8.
The 147Nd tracer concentrations were determined by counting the 0.53~-MeV
gamma emitted by the 147Nd tracer. Values are corrected for decay during
the run (t1/2 = 11 d). Results for total neodymium ﬁere obtained by
chemical analyses using an isotopic dilution mass ‘spectrometry procedure.
All samples were counted for 147Nd.contents. Analyses for total
neodymium were done on alimited number of representative samples (1) to
establish that the 147Nd-tracer data representéd the total neodymium
'concentration, (2) to verify the adequacy of the sampling procedure, and
(3) to check on the accuracy of the inventofy of the neodymium ih the

system.
