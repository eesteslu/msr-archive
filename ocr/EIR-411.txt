Abstract.

A fast converter with one zone and an infernal breeding
ratio of 1.00, with liquid fuel in the form of molten plutonium -
- uranium - and sodium chloride, with a thermal power of 3 GW (th)
allows continuous extraction of the veolatile fission products
(Br, I, Kr, Xe, Te) by means of helium purging in the core. The
non-volatile fission products e.g. Sr and Cs can continuously
be extracted in a chemical reprocessing plant at the reactor
site. The impact on an accidental release of fission products
is rather significant; the amounts released are 50-100 times
smaller than those in a reference reactor (LWR with oxide fuel).
Because the heat sink 1s relatively large and after heat reduced,
the temperature of the fuel does not exceed BOOOC after an

accident, which greatly reduces the consequences of an accident.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Present position

The llight water reactor, the most common power reactor today
and for the next two decades 1s safe enough to be the basic

energy source for society.

This however does not mean that the search for improved
safety 1s a waste of time. The continued search for still
safer systems 1is common in all the technologlies making up our
civilization (transportation, chemical technology, domestic

fire harzards etc.).

Fach type of nuclear reactor also has potential for increasing
its safe operation. It must however be remembered that the most
important safety aspect of the current reactor sysfems 1is in

the real practical experience bullt up over many years. Here
the light water reactor is in a privileged position being able

to demonstrate an excellent safety record.

Tn spite of this crucial fact the search nust continue for reac-
types which promise improved inherent safety on the baslis of
their different system design. Such a search seems to be gene-

rally desirable.

The best reason for such a reactor type has been given by

Alvin Weinberg (1979, 1980).

"For the 15 billion curies contained in a 1000
megawatt reactor we could never say that the

chance of a serious accidental releasec was zero.

Thus a most important technical fix for
nuclear energy would be a means of minimising the
amount of land that conceivably could be

contaminated in the worst possible accident.
For nuclear energy to survive we must
reduce the probability of any serious malfunction
much below the 1 in 20 000 per reactor-year
estimated in the Rasmussen report as well as

reducing any possible consequences."

"But 1f the world energy system involved as many

as 5000 reactors - that 1s, 10 times as many

as are now either in operation or under
construction - one might expect an accident that
released sizeable amounts of radiocactivity every
four years. Considering that a nuclear accident
anywhere 1s a nuclear accident everywhere I belileve
this accident probability is unacceptable. If a
man is to live with fission over the long term he

must reduce the a priori probability of accident

by a large factor - say 100."

(The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.
March 1980)

The aim of this paper 1s to try and present a concept for a
fission power reactor being approximately 100 times less
hazardous than existing reactor types, and with much less than

15 billion curies activity.

Tt must be stressed that this study 1s concerned with a

'paper reactor' (which is of course the safest type of alll)

a concept only. The route from the concept to reallsing an
actual power reactor in service, and contributing to our
energy problems 1s a long and tortuous road and with financial
commitments of tens of billions of dollars. Even this should
not prevent the search for such a reactor. The search 1tself
is of benefit even for a better understanding and possible

improvement to the existing power reactor systems.
How is 1t possible to meet the regquirement for a 100-fold

improvement in reactfor safety?

The following proposals are made below:

a) the amount of fission products in the core during
a normal operation must be reduced by a factor 100
which significantly reduces the effects of a large
accident where the fission products would be
released into the environment,

b) the decay heat level must be reduced and the
internal inherent heat sink, such as the total heat
capacity of the fuel and other components must be
significantly increased. Additionally the maximum
temperature reached by the fuel 1n the case of
failure of all emergency ccoling systems must be
low enough to allow the fuel to be trapped in a

core catcher,

Both of fthese criteria seem to be possible in a reactor having
a molten fuel with continuous extraction of fission products

in the fuel during normal operation. (Ref . 19).

In this paper one sclution to this problem 1s discussed in
detail: the molten salt reactor. It must be said that such
reactor types have been consldered for many years having molten

salt as a fuel and with continuous extraction of fission products.

Some examples of molten salt reactors: (Ref. 5, 14, 16, 17, 18).

a) thermal breeder with molten fluorides developed decades
ago by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, existing as an
experimental reactor with a power of 8 MW(th), (Ref. 13)

b} fast breeder reactor with molten chlorides discussed
for tens of years, but still a "paper reactor”.

A reactor of the second type is discussed here.

1.2 Safety of a Fission Reactor: state ot the art.

Of course the hazard of a fission reactor is not only connected
with 1ts fission product inventory. There are other important

safety aspects. Table 1.1 shows the 1mpact of other reactor

parameters on its safety and ways of resolving these. The
question arising out of these criteria 1s can all the necessary
improvements be made in a single reactor type? The answer

assumed here 1s yes.

1.4 The present State of Reactor Development and the

Criteria for a Safer Reactor

The present state of reactor technology results from a 1long
and complicated development and marked by not always the most

logical decisions.

If the following are the four main targets of reactor

development:

2) an economically and technically feaslible source of
electrical energy,

b) economically and technically feasible source of
high temperature heat for chemical processes,

¢) high grade utilisation of uranium resources (and
even thorium resources),

d) satisfactory level of safety,

then it may be possible to show with the aid of a diagram

(Fig. 1.1) the present state of reactor development.

Of course there are other ways of eliminating the characteristics
presenting the greatest hazards - high pressure and high F.P.

inventory. Figure 2 shows some possibilities. It seems

however that only molten salts can solve both these problems.

In this paper the accent is on the safety problem 1.e. the
effort to reduce the consequences of the worst credible accident -
core melting. Paradoxically as this might sound the solutlion to

this problem is the use of a reactor with a molten fuel core.

Tn this reactor:

a) the most important parameter to be optimised is the
reduction in the inventory of volatile fission
products (which will control the consequences of an
accident during the first hours) and fission products
such as Sr-90 and Cs-137 (which determine the
accessibility of the contaminated area for tens of

years) ,

b) decay heat resulting from the spontaneous radioc-
active decay of fission products and actinides but
alsoc of the structural material is significantly

lower, even 1f it 1is not enough,

¢) the breeding ratio has been set at 1 in order to
minimise the need to transport fissionable material.
this makes the reactor a net zero consumer and zero
producer of fissionable material,

d) the entire system fuel, primary and secondary
cooling systems have been desligned to operate at
amblent pressure,

e) no highly reactive compounds, (e.g. metallic sodium)
are present In the system,

f) no hydrogen containing compounds (e.g. water), which

can evolve free hvdrogen., are present. (see Ref. 14, 15

16, 17, 18).
2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF FISSTON PRODUCTS AND DECAY HEAT
REMOVAL

2.1 The Rasmussen Scenario (Ref. 12, 2L4),

The scenario of an accident used here is taken from the reporst
WASH-1400 as the most fatal case: the PWR-1 which can be
characterised by a steam explosion on contact of molten fuel
with water in the reactor vessel. This accident category
includes the following fraction of fission product core

inventory release:
16

Rasmussen German risk study
(maximum)
Xe - Kr 0.9 1.0
1 0.7 6.8
Cs=Rb 0.5 0.5
Te-5b 0.4 0.35
Ba-Sr 0.05 0.052
Ru (Rh,Co,Mo,Te) 0.4 0.38
La (Y,Zr,Nb,Ce,Pr,
Nd, Np, Pu, Am, Cm) 3%10"° 2. 6x107°

The release of fission products and actinides to the
environment results in two different scenarios (simplified
here):
a) the impact of volatile short lived fission products
from the passing cloud in the direct neighbourhood
of' the reactor - some hours after the accident,

b) the impact of non-volatile long lived fission products.

2.2 The Problenm

From consideration of this scenario of the worst reactor
accident 1t 1s clear that to improve the safety significantly
the proposed reactor must allow the continuous extraction of
both classes of fission products - the short lived volatile F.P.
and the long lived non-volatile F.P. This 1s the most

important aspect. (Table 2.1)

For the accident described above to occur in its entirety it
1t 1s necessary that the last barrier, the containment building

becomes breached.

This can occur in the following ways:

a) steam explosion,
b) leakage of pipes,
¢) hydrogen burning,
d) overpressure due to heating,
e) melting of the core systems,

f) loss of fluid giving overpower (for fast reactors).

It seems that In the reactor system propesed here almost all
of these failure mechanisms (excluding the leakage of pipes)
could be fully eliminated. The safety is thus significantly

improved.

3. PRINCIPLES OF THE 'SOFT'" REACTOR

3.1 A Schematic View

Of course there is no possible way to bulld a fission reactor
in which the dangerous fission products are not produced at all,
or in which they could be fully destroyed (by transformation)
in situ. Therefore the only possibility 1s to shift in time
and space:

a) fissionable fuel as a critical source and generator

of power - both being controllable,
b) fission products as a source of radioactivity and

source of decay heat, both of which cannot be controlled.

Figure 3.1 shows this principle.

4.2 System Descriptilon

FFor the sake of simplicity, and by no means as an optimised
system the reactor characteristics can be summarised as follows:

L. NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

4,1 The Method

The calculations were based on the British 2240 group nuclear
data library FGL5. Twenty group cross-sections for cach
reactor zone were derived from FGL5 using the associated cell

code MURALE.

The reactor geometry was represented by a spherical model

with one core zone and a reflector zone. Transport calculations
were performed in the discrete ordinate (SM) approximation by
the ANISN code to obtain the physical properties of the critical
reactor. The effective delayed neutron fraction was derived
from basic ENDF-B-IV data using proper flux and adjoint flux
welghting and an appropriate reduction of the delayed neutron

yields due to precursor losses.

The main results of the physics calculations can be

summarised as:

critical radius 2.616 m
average neutron flux 5X1015n/cm25
temperature criticality

coef ficient 0.018% /K
(see also Table 4.1 and Table 4.2)

bh.2 Nuclear Properties of SOFT

The loss of neutrons due to the use of natural chlorine are
10% which i1s significantly high but far from being
prohibitive. (Ref. 8, 10, 16, 20, 21).

5. CONTINUOUS EXTRACTTION OF FISSION PRCDUCTS

5.1 General Scheme

The general idea of this reactor type 1s the differentiation
of the chemlcal properties of the fission products in the
molten chloride medium. (Ref. 10, 16).

The rough scheme is given in Fig. 5.1.

5.2 Chemical State of Fission Products in Molten Chlorides

It 1s important to know the chemical state of the fission

products. The fission reaction of PuCl, can be written as

%
follows (E1 = fission product element) (index O for elementary state)
1 PuCl, LRIy E1-C1, + V2 E1_

Cumulated Cl-demand is calculated from individual fission

239

product yields (Y ) for fast fission of Pu irradiated for
10 days and product stoichiometry starting with the most
stable chloride product being formed. Where necessary (i.e.
where one fission product will form several chlorides of
comparable stability) a weighted mean was calculated based on

the Gibbs free energies at 1000 K. (see also Ref. 6, 17, 22)

Table 5.1 fives the cumulated chlorine demand of the fission
products forming stable chlorides at 1000 X(100% is set equal
to the number of fission events - total C1l supply therefore

equals 300%). Because of the apparent lack of free chlorine

5.% Fission Product Volatility and Gaseous Extraction

Table 5.2 gives the melting and boilling points of the fission

product chlorides and the fuel components. (Ref. 22)

The chemical species in the system discussed here can be
divided into % groups

- those that have melting points of 1000K are 1likely
to solidify under normal operating conditlions
(e.g. semi-noble metals),

- those which have a boiling point 10600 X{(or 1500 K)
will evaporate under normal operating conditions (in
case of accidental use in temperature) and will have
to be removed from the reactor altogether with other
gaseous products (i.e. Xe, Kr, I2 and He as an 1nert
carrier gas). This will necessitate the installation
of appropriate equipment to extract these compounds
from the purge gas before 1t is recleased to the
environment,

- all other chemical species.

The volatlle fission products Xe, Kr, I, Te and Sb are of
primary concern because they would be almost completely
released in a core accident. The ten radionuclides that
contribute the most ( 392% of the total) of the external dose

to the bone marrow from a passing cloud (see Fig. 5.3 ) were

chosen to study the effectiveness of gaseous extraction.

The extraction rate will be characterised by a rate constant
K <t which will depend on the physical and chemical
properties of the volatile, the salt melt and design
parameters such as gas throughput. For simplicities sake
the same rate constant 1s used in the calculations for all

the radionuclides that are studied.

As an example the following simplified scheme 1s used to

calculate the 88Kr and lngb inventory:

The halflives of 88Br and 88

Se are so short that they will

The rate of production of BgKr 1s therefore equal toc the sum

of the direct yields of Kr Br and Se. These dilrect

yields were calculated as the product of the values given in

ref. 4 and represent the number of nucleii formed by fast

fission of 100 atoms of Pu directly before any radiocactive

decay has taken place.

Similarly the rate at which ggKr 1s dlsappearing is
characterised by the sum of the respective rate constants for

radiocactive g decay and extraction, where the half-1ife is

Thus the change in ggKr inventory (88Kr) 1s given by :

Similar calculations were made for other extractable nuclides.

The extraction rate cannot be very high not only because of
the physical and chemical constraints and the prohibitive
amount of helium bubbles in the fuel (effecting the
criticality due to changes in total and local bubble volumes)
but also because of the problem of the precursors of the

delayed neutrons.

5.4 Problem of Delayed Neutron Emitters

A significant proportion of the delayed neufron precursors
are the volatile fission products. Delayed neutron emitters
will be removed along with other volatile fission products by
means of gas purging. The nuclides of Interest and theilr

respective half lives are approximately as follows : (see Ref.9)

The effect of gasecus extraction upon delayed neutron emitters
inventory can be calculated roughly by fthe same method used in
section 5.4 to calculate the degree of extraction of the other
volatile F.P. The results of these calculations are presented

in Fig. 5.4 and FTig. 5.5. (Ref.17)

Delayed neutrons will also be lost in the heat exchanger as

the salt melt i1s pumped through this loop. The salt melt will
remalin an average of 11.3 s in the core and 4.8 s in the external
heat exchanger circuit. During these & s the number of radlo-

nuclides is reduced by a factor of 2 exp (-58/t,.) thus total

In a % GW(th) recactor 9.3 x 1019

fission/s occur producing
3.09 x lO_u mol/s of fission products, 1 x lO_L’L mol/s of
which are volatile. The total volume of helium bubbles in
fthe core should not exceed O.lmﬁB(less than 0.2% of the total
core volume) that is 5 moles of helium in order to minimise

the rise Iin criticality due to loss of helium throughput.

If we assume the extraction process is limited only by diffusion
(i.e. the volatiles are completely immiscible in the molten salt
which is likely to be the case for Kr and Xe but hardly for I

2

TeCl3 and SbClB) the extraction rate can be approximated from
film theory. The model assumes that the gas in the bubble

undergoes toroidal circulation.

As the gas circulates 1t encounters fresh liquid at the top of
the bubble. As the bubble rises the liquid moves downward in
relation to the bubble and leaves when 1t reaches the bottom of
the bubble. The liquid near the 1interface is usually in laminar
flow and the contact time 1s certainly short, thus the ligquid
behaves much like the ligquid at the surface of a falling film.

This investigation shows that:

- gaseous extractlion of volatile fission products would
be an effective means of reducing the risk to the
environment due to an accidental release of part of the
reactor inventory in a MSFBR,

- the extraction rates which would be necessary to achleve
this should be attainable with a reasoconably small through-
put that should minimise any criticallty change and allow
a reasonable design of a gas purification system,

- delayed neutron emitters are removed less than the
volatiles that cause concern in the case of a core
accident because they have few (or no) volatlle precursors
and are short-lived compared to the time constant of

extractiorn.

5.4 Reprocessing of Non Volatile Fission Products.

The fisslion products experience the conditions in the molten
chloride core of fthe recactor and are at“J6BOOC and in the non-
volatile form,e.g:

- dispersions of metallic particles (colleids?) Rh, Ru,

R .

- solutions of molten chlorides:CsCl, SrCl
They must be extracted from the irradlated fuel by means ofl
chemical reprocessing, 1f possible continuously. A rough list

5.7 Some Technological Problems

Apart from the fission products and corrosion products an
important problem in this molten chlorides reactor is the
removal of sulphur. In a flux of fast neutrons the following
reaction takes place: (Ref. 8, 18, 20}
35
C £
17 Ve

This sulphur is obviously undesirable and makes the corrosion

55 (

1 (n,p) 168 = 88 4)

problems worse. The continuous chemical reprocessing can be
used to remove the sulphur. Nevertheless a consliderable problem

remains regarding the resulting corrosion.

5.8 Possible Reprocessing Technologies

Tt is possible to separate the fisslon products from the

molten fuel 1in various ways:

- extraction from molten chlorides by imiscible liquid
metals. This is a well known technology developed
especially for the molten salt breeder (Ref. 13)

- electrochemical dissolution of metallic uranium. The
continuous feed of uranium (depleted or natural) 1in
amounts of some gram/secpermits the removal of fission
products which have a free energy of formation of
chlorides of ~1000K which is smaller than that of UClg.

This applies to a good proportion of the semi-noble F.P.
(see Fig.5.1 )

- the most attractive method is electrolysis in the molten
chloride system. The following very simplified calcula-
tion explains this: The total amount of plutonium In the
fuel is 96 000 moles. (see Table 3.1). The total amount
of chlorides is 1.82 x 106 moles (PuCl,, UClB’ NaCl).

For a five day reprocessing cycle (4.3?X105 s)the flow to

the reprocessing plant is 4.21 mol/s.

Taking into account the electrolysis 1s at a voltage of

3 volts (see Fig. 5.5) and the efficiency is 0.5 then

the power needed for the electrolysis 1s:

Continuous electrolysis seems to be feasable both from the

The Problem of External Storage of the Fission Products

For the reactor type proposed a special problem has to be
solved: that of the interim storage of the fission products
from the tfime of extraction from the fuel fo the time of
transportation away from the reactor building approximately

50 days later.

The criteria giving the form of chemical and physical form best

suited for interim storage is shown 1in Table 5.4,

6. HEAT REMOVAL

6.1 Primary Circuit: Core and Heat Exchangers

Molten fuel reactors have been proposed having differing
methods of cocoling the primary fuel : a) internal cooling in
which the coolant is pumped into the core in for example tubes,
b) external cooling systems in which the fuel is pumped out of

the core through heat exchangers.

The reactor proposed here has the following characteristics:

- the heat removal is based on the pumping of the molten
fuel out of the core. The dwell time in the core is

~v11.3% 5,and outside the core ~ 4.8 s,
48

- the outlet temperature of the fuel is 65000 the inlet
temperature 470YC. The temperature difference of
180°C with a volume flow rate of 6.65 mB/s permits the
removal of 3000 MW{th) (see Fig.6.1)

- the secondary coolant is also a molten salt containing
chemically inert chlorides of Na, Ca, Ba, Mg. No pressure
is needed and no hydrogen containing a volatile compound

are present.

6.2 Secondary Cilrcuit

The followlng are the requirements for a cooling medium for
this reactor:
- generating at the proposed 6OOOC, pressureless and
stable for long periods of irradiation.
- non reactive to molten fuel (no exothermic or endo-
thermic chemical reactions, no precipitation or gas

evolutilion.

Some media which fulfill the above reguirements are:

The c¢criteria for selection are as follows:

- the highest possible thermodynamic efficiency,

- the full use of the high temperature of the molten
fuel reactor,

- minimising of the risk of chemical reactions between
secondary and tertiary working agent,

- minimising the pressure in the working agent,

- use of the same circult materials as for the secondary

circulit if possible.

A1l these reguirements can be met by using aluminium trichloride

as the working fluid. This has been discussed earlier

(Ref. 14, 15)

6.4 Heat Removal from the Stored Fission Products

An additional problem for this reactor arises from the continuous
extraction of the fission products from the molten fuel and
transfer out of the reactor containment. For this a second (small)

containment must be bulilt to house the stored 'hot' fission products.

The power produced will be of the order of some tens of megawatts
(th) depending on how quickly the fission products are removed for

further treatment elsewhere.

This system therefore requires a special cooling system which

can be bullt with some simple redundancy relatively inexpensively.

The problem of the possible processing of the {ission products

and transportation methods have not been discussed here.

7. ACCIDENTS - PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

7.1 Decay Heat: Power and Energy

The crucial problem of each fission reactor is the problem of
52

the decay heat removal during a worst core accident.

It 1s known that the fission product inventory is:

- for short lived F.P. proportional f£o the specific power
(that is to the neutron flux),
- for long lived F.P. proportional to the energy produced

(that is to the neutron flux times length of operation)

To carry out a rough estimate the following simplified
calculations have been made:

a) the decay heat power from a fission reactor has been

taken from ANS guides (Ref. 1) (see Fig. 7.1).

As a reference the decay heat from the thermal fission
2

of BgPu has been taken,

b) for the sake of simplification the decay heat power

curve has been presented as an overlapping series of

six curves having half-1ife value of 108, 107, 106, 105

104, 103 and 102 seconds.

239 2359

c¢) the decay heat of and Np has been taken into

account

d) the build-up curve has been constructed for an irradiation

time of 500 days and 5 days (Fig. 7.2),

e) the effect of gas extraction on the volatile fission
products has been assume to be as follows:
- for the F.P. with t]/2 = 1025 only a quarter of the
total can be extracted by gas pumping,
- for the F.P. with tyg > 1@35 approximately one-third

can be extracted by gas pumping.

) the effect of chemical extraction on all the long lived

fission products with t ;31055 has been estimated to

Vo
be approximately 99 percent (rather optimistic),

7.2 Worst Accident Scenarios

A number of simplified scenarios for the worst core accident

for this reactor is shown in Fig. 7.5.

The calculation of the heat and power for each stage of the

calculation is given 1n Table 7.1.

The following three points have been taken into account

a) the scram I1s perfect (in this reactor type not only the
engineered fast shut down system, buft also the Inherent
negative reactivity (coefficient).

A1l the cooling possibilities fail. The fuel in the core and

in the external loop begin f£o heat up as a result of the decay

heat.

A temperature of 9BOOC is reached after a time of 0.7 hours
after the scram. This temperature has been postulated as the
maxlimum 'allowable' temperature of the fuel because of':
- partial pressure of volatile components in the
irradiated fuel,
- structural material properties (e.g. molybdenum alloys
for the core vessel),

- management of molten fuel.

The end of this step i1s shown in Fig.7.4 and Table 7.1 as point A.

b) an interim mechanism has been postulated in that the reflector

material belng composed of chlorides of e.g. NaCl, CaCl., MgCl etc.

and as a result of the temperature increase from M?OOC Lo
700°C and then 950°C, also heat up and melts.

(Note the problem of heat transfer from the core to the
reflector has not been discussed). Point B on Fig. 7.4 and

Table 7.1,
c) the drainage to the dump tank 1is negligible,

d) the fuel at 95000 drains to the core catcher filled with
2000 tons of solid chlorides with a melting point of
approximately 600°¢. (Point C: Fig. 7.4 and Table 7.1)

7.3 Spontanecus Cooling Processes in the Containment

In this scenario it has been assumed that all cooling systems
(including all redundancy) and all emergency cooling systems
of the core of the dump-tank of the core catcher and of the

internal contalinment fail.

Figure 7.6 shows the principle layout of the reactor after
drainage of the fuel to the core catcher. The transport of heat
from the molten fuel and the core catcher mixture 1s as foilows:
a) the molten mass ofw2350 tons reaches the permissible
temperature of 6OOOC after 42 hours from the start of
the accident (and scram). At this moment the decay heat

is approximately 6.5 MW(th).

b) the core catcher has the following characteristics
- the upper part free molten salt and a temperature
of 600°C (873 X).
- the lower part of steel at a temperature of H5OOC
(723 K
The heat losses due to infra-red emisslon are:

The total heat emission due to infra-red radiation

allows the removal of all the decay heat once this
has dropped below 10 Mw.
¢) this heat has to be removed from the alir and the

7.4 The Prompt Critical Scenario

Since in this study only steady state calculations have been
made the problem of the prompt critical excursion is not

discussed seriously.

However a rather naive attempt is made toc obtain a rough idea
of the magnitude of events under such a scenario as follows:
a) the best known data for a prompt critical accident
for the liquid metal cooled fast breeder SNR-300 has
been taken as the reference (Ref. 11)
b) where the SOFT reactor has significantly different
characteristics such as:

temperature of fuel during normal operation:

SNR - 11547

SOFT - 550°¢

a heat capacity of total fuel inventory for o T = 1OOOOC;
SNE - 0.21 GJ/100 K

SOF'T - 28.2 GJ/100 K

- fthen the values for the SOFT reactor have been taken.

Table 7.2 shows the calculations.

The reactor proposed here has therefore the following
characteristics:

a) the continuous removal of fission products and the
adjustment of the fissile/fertile inventory continuously
during operation. This minimises the amount of excess
reactivity which must be compensated for by the control
rods, which reduces the risk of rapid control rod with-

drawal causing an uncontrclled excession,

the temperature reactivity coefficient 3K 1is
dependant on two effects: Kol
The removal of the fuel out of the critical zone due to
density decrease (temperature coefficient of expansion
equals mlxlOS/K) and secondly the increased leakage

of neutrons,

the inflow of cooler fuel occurs with time constants of
at least several seconds and does not strongly affect

the control characteristics,

under normal operation the core contains ~0.2% of helium
bubbles. Changes 1n gas flow changes fthe average density
of the molten fuel. A depressurization of the fuel system
which would expand the bubbles by a factor 2 to 3% would
cause a reactlivity decreasey

the wvoliding by local boiling in this type of homogeneous
core 1s not credible even without pumping,

the fissile material in the on-line processing plant
amounts to less than 1% of the reactor inventory. If all
this amount could be returned to the reactor within one
minute the excess reactivity would be increased by

0.007% per second (by rough estimation),

The worst credible event occurs probably due to a breach

of the primary sytem boundary. This results in a release
of large amounts of irradiated fuel - even the total
amount into the containment building. The rather simple

core catcher in the form of ~2000 tons of salt (see
Fig. 5.2) 1g sufficient to control this accident,

a peculiar property of this reactor is the possibility
of inhomogeneity in the fissile material (PuClB) for
example due to hydrolysis and/or reaction with oxygen
resulting in the formation of insoluble Pu02 . The
probabllity of such an event is very small since no

water 1s used in the entire system,

8. CONCLUSIONS.

The reactor concept has the following strong polints:

- the steady state operating inventory of pofentially
harmful fission products is significantly reduced,

- high thermal stability against excusion,

- removal of the decay heat 1s guaranteed even in case
of a fallure of all emergency ccoling systems provided
the outside containment spraying system works, for a
power of less than 0.5 MW.

however;

~ the technology of molten salt reactors 1s not yet
sufficiently developed,

- the corrosion problems will probably be difficult
to solve,

- the amount of Pu present in the reactor 1s very high,

(but not optimized)
