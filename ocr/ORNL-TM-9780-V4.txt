1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY

The Nuclear Power Options Viability Study (NPOVS) was initiated at the beginning
of calendar year 1984 by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The objective of
NPOVS was to explore the viabilities of several nuclear electric power generation options
for commercial deployment within the United States beginning in the 2000-2010 time
frame. Important efforts included the identification and development of criteria and
characteristics for evaluating new reactor concepts. Innovative concepts were identified
that may be marketable at the time when the demand for new electrical energy capacity is
expected to increase significantly. These concepts were considered and evaluated, with
respect to the criteria and with emphasis on cost, safety features, operability,
constructibility, regulation, research needs, and market acceptance. Nuclear reactors are
recognized as a vital resource to meet future energy demands.

The NPOVS proceeded in steps: (1) a literature search and development of a
bibliography; (2) development of criteria for evaluation of nuclear plant designs and plans;
(3) evaluation of selected design concepts using these criteria as a guide; and (4)
recommendations for areas of research and development (R&D) needed to reduce
uncertainties in the viabilities of options. The approach used in evaluation was to compile
detailed information on the various reactor concepts of interest, synthesize that information
in accordance with specific technical areas, develop an understanding of how design
features influence the overall cost of generating power, and consider how changes in the
design might accomplish improved economic performance and acceptance by regulators
and the public. In addition to technical evaluations, assessments were made of the various
nontechnical factors that influence commercial use such as regulatory requirements,
industry perspectives on future technologies, market acceptance, electric power growth
needs, and economic conditions.

The report of the NPOVS is organized into four volumes, as follows:

« Volume I, Executive Summary!
* Volume 1I, Reactor Concepts, Descriptions, and Assessments?
»  Volume III, Nuclear Discipline Topics3

» Volume IV, Bibliography.
The evaluative criteria established in this study are as follows:

1.  The calculated risk to the public due to accidents is less than or equal to the
calculated risk associated with the best modern LWRs.

2.  The probability of events leading to loss of investment is less than or equal to 104
per year (based on plant costs).

3.  The economic performance of the nuclear plant is at least equivalent to that for coal-
fired plants. (Financial goals for the utility are met, and busbar costs are acceptable
to the public utility commissions.)
4.  The design of each plant is complete enough for analysis to show that the
probability of significant cost/schedule overruns is acceptably low.

5.  Official approval of a plant design must be given by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) to assure the investor and the public of a high probability that
the plant will be licensed on a timely basis if constructed in accordance with the
approved design.

6.  For a new concept to become attractive in the marketplace, demonstration of its
readiness to be designed, built, and licensed and to begin operations on time and at
projected cost 1s necessary.

7.  The design should include only those nuclear technologies for which the
prospective owner/operator has demonstrated competence or can acquire competent
managers and operators.

These criteria obviously are not independent since items 1 and 2 deal with the
probabilities for successful operation or failure, items 3 to 6 are primarily economic, and
item 7 relates to demonstrated operational experience. However, we deem each criterion to
have sufficient stand-alone merits to justify separate consideration.

The criteria are augmented by a list of characteristics that provide further guidance
for properties judged to be of importance to nuclear power viability. The characteristics
chosen are not as quantifiable or demonstrable as are the criteria and have been chosen to
include features that complement and amplify the criteria.

In selecting the concepts to be studied, three ground rules were used:

1.  The nuclear plant design option should be developed sufficiently that an order could
be placed in the 2000-2010 time period.

2.  The design option should be economically competitive with environmentally
acceptable coal-fired plants.

3.  The design option should possess a high degree of passive safety to protect the
public health and property and the owner's investment. ("Passive safety" refers to
the reliance on natural physical laws and properties of materials to effect shutdown
and radioactive decay heat removal.)

The concepts selected are considered advanced and have various degrees of
innovation as compared to current concepts. For convenience, the selected concepts were
classified in the traditional way by their coolants and respective generic names. The
concepts selected are
1. Light-Water Reactors (LWRSs)

» PIUS (Process Inherent Ultimate Safety) - promoted by ASEA-ATOM of Sweden

« Small BWR (Boiling Water Reactor) - promoted by General Electric (GE)
2. Liquid Metal Reactors (LMRs)

e PRISM (Power Reactor Intrinsically Safe Module) - The GE advanced concept
supported by DOE

» SAFR (Sodium Advanced Fast Reactor) - The Rockwell International (RI)
advanced concept supported by DOE

« LSPB (Large-Scale Prototype Breeder) - The Electric Power Research Institute-
Consolidated Management Office (EPRI-CoMO) concept supported by EPRI and

DOE

3. High-Temperature Reactors (HTR)

» Side-by-Side Modular - The core and steam generator in separate steel vessels in a
side-by-side configuration. The concept is supported by DOE and promoted by
Gas-Cooled Reactor Associates (GCRA) and industrial firms.

1.2 SELECTION AND UTILIZATION OF APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS

Information pertinent to the study was gathered by participants through discussions
with organizations in the nuclear field and by collecting appropriate documents from the
open literature. Discussions were held with 31 companies including reactor vendors,
architect-engineers, utility companies and utility associations, laboratories, institutions, and
universities. From the approximately 2,000 documents collected, some 550 were selected
for inclusion in the bibliography. The collection consists of journal articles, reports,
papers, presentations, and books covering Nuclear Options, Light Water Reactors, Liquid
Metal Reactors, and High Temperature Reactors.

The selected documents were assigned keywords, categorized, and cataloged
utilizing a computer. Current listings were distributed periodically to the NPOVS staff with
additions to the collection flagged for their attention. New documents with particular
relevance to the study or providing timely input were also routed to the concept leaders and
other appropriate members of the staff. In addition, staff members visited the physical
collection to access material pertinent to their area of the study. In these ways, the
document collection has been utilized extensively in the course of the study.

1.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLECTION

The types of documents in the collection range from newspaper clippings to books,
and their length varies from one to several hundred pages. Approximately 30% of the
documents are reprints of articles from journals such as Nuclear Engineering International,
Power Engineering, Electrical World, Energy Policy, Science and Public Policy, and
Technology Review. Reports and presentations produced by the 31 companies and
laboratories in the nuclear field and which were contacted by NPOVS staff comprise
another 20% of the collection. A wide spectrum of topics from broad overviews to
specific assessments are covered in the collection.
2.  ORGANIZATION AND RETRIEVAL

2.1  PHYSICAL COLLECTION

The physical collection is arranged by NPOVS access number and is housed in the
NPOVS office at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. There are four major divisions:

» Nuclear Options,

* Light Water Reactors,

e Liquid Metal Reactors, and
¢ High Temperature Reactors.

Within these divisions, entries are listed by first author or corporate author. Each entry
includes in order: name(s) of author or corporate author; title; publication description;
corporate author(s); address of corporate author(s); publication date; NPOVS access code
(in parentheses); and keywords assigned (in parentheses at the end of the entry).

The documents are filed in a series of notebooks and file boxes numbered sequentially
under each major heading. The notebooks are divided into sections, and sections are
divided with a tab for each document.

Subjects of interest may be found by using the keyword index (Chapter 4) or referring
to the alphabetical listings by author presented in the four major classifications: Nuclear
Options (Chapter 5); Light Water Reactors (Chapter 6); Liquid Metal Reactors (Chapter 7);
and High Temperature Reactors (Chapter 8).

The NPOVS access code is an alphanumeric key to the physical location of the
document. The code consists of two or three letters followed by three sets of two-digit
numbers such as NO-03-02-05. The letters refer to the heading (NO = Nuclear
Options, LWR = Light Water Reactors, LMR = Liquid Metal Reactors, and HTR = High
Temperature Reactors). The first set of digits refers to the notebook number within the
heading, the second set of digits to the section within the notebook (when these digits are
preceded by the letter "B," the document is found in the appropriate file box rather than in a
notebook), and the third set of digits to the item number within the section. The
coding is illustrated below for NO-03-02-05.

NO = Nuclear Options
03 = Notebook No. 3 (or File Box No. 3 if coded "B03")
02 = Section No. 2 of the notebook

05 = Item No. 5 in the section.

2.2 KEYWORDS

The keywords selected and used in this collection are shown in Chapter 3,
Table 3.1.
To facilitate locating citations or documents by subject, a keyword index 1is
provided as Chapter 4. Please refer to Chapter 4 for details and instructions for utilizing
the keyword index.

2.3 COMPUTER SEARCHES

The bibliographic data base resides in the ORNL IBM 3033 mainframe computer
(System 2 on ORNL'S System Select Network) and is accessible to ORNL staff via a
search program called ORLLOOK. After log on and initialization of ORLOOK, the user
makes the following selections: “private” data base, named "NPOVS,"” and file
number "1."

Searches may be made of the fields <AUTHOR>, <TITLE>, <PUB DES>
(publication description), <CORPAUTH> (corporate author), and <KEYWORDS> or a
blanket search (covering all fields) might be made. A blanket search for, as an example,
"ASEA-ATOM" would produce citations where ASEA-ATOM is the author or corporate
author as well as citations where ASEA-ATOM is a part of the title.

Combination searches for a maximum of 4 words are also possible, thereby tailoring
the search to fit the needs of the user. For example, a search might be made for ‘costs’,
'international’, 'construction’. Combination searches limit the area searched and produce a
shorter list of citations.

For information on other search combinations and detailed information about
ORLOOK searches, please refer to ORNL-4951 (Rev. 1) by V. A. Singletary 4

Results of computer searches may be transmitted rapidly via the ITT DIALCOM
electronic mail network to ITT DIALCOM subscribers at DOE Headquarters.

4. KEYWORD INDEX

In the index beginning on the following page, each keyword is listed alphabetically,
followed by an alphabetical list of the first author of document(s) assigned that keyword.
The NPOVS access code, an alphanumeric code for the physical location of the document
(see Section 2.1), follows the author’'s name. Multiple NPOVS access codes will appear
when there is more than one document with the same first author.

Once the NPOVS access code and the first author are determined, the complete
citation can be located by referring to the appropriate chapter indicated by the code, locating
the author, and then locating the specific code:

NO (Nuclear Options) = Chapter 5
LWR (Light Water Reactors) = Chapter 6
LMR (Liquid Metal Reactors) = Chapter 7
HTR (High Temperature Reactors) = Chapter 8

For retrieval of the document itself from the physical collection, the NPOVS access
code (as explained in Section 2.1) serves as an alphanumeric location guide.
