THEORETICAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF THE MSRE WITH 233U FUEL

R. C. Steffy, Jr. and P. J. Wood*

‘Abstract

A study undertaken to characterize the dynamics of the
233y.fueled MSRE prior to operation revealed that the system
is inHerently asymptotically stable at all power levels above
zero. The motivation for these studies was the expected dif-
ference between the MSRE dynamic response with 232U fuel and
‘with 23 U fuel because of the smaller delayed-neutron frac-
tion of 233y, An existing system model, previously verified
for 2357 fuel, was modified for use in this work. The reac-
tor system response_to reactivity perturbations is rapid and
nonoscillatory at high power, and it becomes sluggish and
oseillatory at lower powers. These characteristics were de-
termined by three methods: (1) transient-response analyses,
~including a check of the validity of the linear model, (2) a
frequency-response and sensitivity study, (3) stability analy-
ses, both by inspection of the system eigenvalues and by ap-
plication of the recently developed modified Mikhailov cri-
terion. .

Keywords: MSRE, 233U fuel, stablllty, elgenvalues,
modified Mikhailov crlterla, frequency response, sens1t1v1ty,
time response, Padé approximations.

1.  Introduction

As a preliminary step in the development of a molten-salt-fueled

-breeder reactor, the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was fueled with
_233U to perform the necessary physlcs and chemistry experlments on thls

:flrst 233U-fueled nuclear power reactor. Before nuclear operatlon, it was

1mportant to antlclpate the dynamlc behavior and the. 1nherent stability of

the system in order to insure safe, orderly operatlon and to plan safe,

,deflnltlve experlments.,

The principal motivation. for evaluatlng the operatlng characterlstlcs

of the 233U fueled MSRE after more than 70 000 Mwhr of power operatlon

wuth 235y fuel is that. 233y has & much smaller delayed-neutron fraction

~ (B) than that of 23°u. fhe.?33U'fue1 was expected to have operating char-
acteristics somewhet different from those of 233y and, in particular, a
faster response to feadtivity perturbations{ Table 1 lists the predicted
basic nuclear-kinetics properties of the MSRE with 233y fuel and compares
‘them with those of the reactor with %2°U fuel.

Several different technigues were used in analyzing the dynamiés of
the 23%U-fueled MSRE, primarily because .each technique either gave infor-
‘mation unavailable from the others or used different _approx:i.mate :ﬁreat- _
ments to describe the system. In performing'the-dynamics analyses a model
developed by Ball and Kerlin' was modified slightly and used to -describe
the MSRE with ?32U fuel. (This model did not include the effect of ‘the
réaétor control system.) The tiﬁe'response of the reactorfsystem to a
reactivity perturbatlon at several power levels was calculated first. The
‘computer code.NmEEXP which calculates the time response of a multivari-
able nonlinear system with pure time delays, was used in this study. Next
~the syStem frequency response was determined by using the computér code
'SFR-3 (Ref. 3). This code was also used to .determine amplitude ratio (or
‘gain) sensitivity'to‘changes in the system variables (i.e., the ratio.of

‘the change in amplitude ratio to the correspbnding change-inra'éystem_varif

-able was determined as a function of‘fréquency). Finally, the absolute
stability of the system was investigated by two techniques. The_system
eigenvalues were calculated at several powers to determine whether oscil-
latiqns.in&uced in the system would increase or decrease in amplitude,
and the Mikhailov stability criterion, as modified by Wright ‘and Kerlin,*
wag used to obtain this same information with fewer approxnmatlons in the
mathematlcal model.

Linearized system equations were- used in the frequency-response and
sensitivity calculations and in both types of stability analysis. This
was-ngcessary'because-general calculational methods do not presently exist
.that would permit ‘these types of analysis'with 8 set of nonlinear system
‘equations. The;time-response calculations utilized the nonlinear equa~
tions. This was possible because they involved an iterative procegdure
that provided for -updating the nonlinear terms after each itefation.

2. Model Description and Verification

A mgthematical model was reguired-to:describe the dynamic behavior
of the ???U-fueled MSRE. The model chosen for ‘this study was essentially
that called the "complete model" in Ref. 1, which was developed to analyze
the dynamics of the 235y. fueled MBRE. The'justification for using this
model was its good agreement with experlmental results when applled to
the 23°y-fueled system.’ -

Some changes were made in the model of Ref. 1, howéver, before it
was applied to the *32U-fueled system. The experimental results of the
previous testing program did not verify the dip in the calculated frequency
response cﬁrve at approximately 0.25 radian/sec, .which. corresponds to a
fuel circulation time of approximately 25 sec. This was attributed to .in-
sufficient'mixing of fuel salt in the .external loop of the .theoretical
model. To provide the model with more mixing, an additiopai 2-sec first-
order time lag (mixing pot) was incorporated at the core outlet. This is
a reasonsble approximation for the mixing in the upper and lower reactor-
vessel plenums. - ;

The chief features of the 44th-order model shown in Fig. 1, are the
fbllow1ng.

B 1. The reactor core was divided into nine regions, each of which
was split into two fuel lumps and one graphite lump. Consideration was
given to the nuclear importance of thermal disturbances in each of the
lumps. (The term "lump" as used in mathematical modeling refers to a seg-
ment'of a physical system that is considered.to have constant\prdperties
throughout and which interacts with its surroundings through only those
properties. ) : |

‘2. A five-lump representatipn of the fuel-to-coolant heat exchanger
was used, with heat being exchanged to a single metal lump at the tempera-
ture of the fuel leaving the first of two fuel lumps and heat being ex-
-changed from the metal lump to the coolant at:fhe‘outlet;temperature of
“the flrst of two coolant lumps.

3, A three-lump coolant-to-air radiator. was used in which the coolant
-transferred heat to a single metal lump at the temperature of the coolant
leaving the first of two  coolant lumps.

4. A linear model of the reactor kinetics equations was used in all
studies, except the time-response calculations,‘in.which.nonlinear'kinetics
effects were taken into account. . |

5. The neutron kinetics equatiohs were represented by a mathematical
~expression that accounted for the dynamic effect of circulating precursors
(except for the eigenvalue calculatlon, which required the use of effec-
tive delayed-neutron fractlons)
6. Xenon poisoning was assumed to be at steady state and not influ-

‘enced by small perturbations.

3. Transient-Respbnse Analysis

Time responses were obtained at several power levels to provide a -
-physical picture of the reactor response to réactivity perturbations such
as control rod motions. The computer code MATEXP? applied in this analy-
sis makes use of the matrix exponentiation technique of solving a.syStem'
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (with pure time delays) of
the form | |

= Ax + MA(x) x + £(t) , (1)

?f-|§‘|

where

x = the solution vector (system state variables), =
A = system matrix (constant square metrix with real coefficients),

AM(X) = a matrix whose elements are deviations from the values in A,
[thus AA(%) x includes ‘a1l nonlinear effects and time delay
terms],

f(t) = foreing function.

The predicted response of the reactor power to a step reactivity in-

erease of 0.02% 8k/k is shown in Fig., 2 for various initial powers. These

response curves point out several important characteristics of the MSRE.
At 8 Mw the maximum power level is reached during the first second after
-tﬁe step reactivity input. The rapid increase in reactor power is accom-
-panied by a rapid increase in fuel température in the coré, which, coupled
with the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, more than

counterbalances the step reactivity input, so the power lével_begins'to . kﬁ’
decrease. The temperature of the salt entering the core is constant -dur- |
‘ing this interval, and when the power has decreased enough for the reac- *
-‘tivity associated with the increased nuclear average temperature to just
cancel the step reactivity input, the power levels for a brief time (from
~6 to ~17 sec after the reactivity input). About 17 sec after the reac-
tivity increase, the hot fluid generated in the ihitial'power\increase
has completed its circuit of the loop external to the core, and the nega-
tive temperature coefficient of the salt again reduces the reactivity so
that the power level starts down again. At large times the reactor power
‘has returned to its initial level, and the step reactivity input has been
-:counterbalanced»by an increase in the nuclear average temperature in the
core. The short plateau observed in the time-response .curve at.8 My was
also noted in the 5-Mw case. - At lower powers, however, the élower system
response-prevents the reactor from reaching the peak of its first oscilla-
tion before the fuel has completed one circuit of the external fuel loop.
The plateau therefore does not appear in the lower pdwer cases.

-An important characteristic of the MSRE dynamic response is that as

-the power is decreased the reactor becomes both sluggish .(slower respond-

)

~ ing) and oscillatory; that is, at low powers the time required for oscil-
lations to die out is much larger than at higher powers, and the fractional
amplitude of the oscillations (A‘power/power) is larger.

As part of the time-response analysis, the validity of the linear ap-
proximation for reactivity perturbations roughly equivalent:to 1/2.in. of
‘control rod movement (0.04% 8k/k) was checked. The results of this analy-
sis are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for 8- and 0.1-Mw operation. At 8 Mw the
linear approximation is fairly good, but at 0.1 Mw it is;pocr. This re-
sult can be understood by considering the general form of the neutron-

kinetics equations:

where

on = deviation of power from its initial value (ng),

po = reactivity necessary to overcome effect of'fuel circulation,
ﬁT = total delayed-neutron fraction,

! = neutron generation time in system,

Op = deviation of reactivity from its initial value,

A\; = decay constant for ith delayed-neutron precursor,
Sci = concentration of ith delayed-neutron precursor.

The last term in Eq. (2), 5p8n/I, is the nonlinear term. In the
8-Mw case the maximum deviation of the power from the initial power is
only about 30% of the initial power, whereas in the 0.1-Mw case the maxi-
mum deviation is 560% of the initial power and is still increasing after
50 sec. When the dn term is this iarge-with respect to:the'no'term, the
nonlinear terms in the kinetics equation play a much larger fole.than-the
linear terms. Thus, neglecting the nonlinear terms may lead to signifi-
cant ‘error if the power -deviates from its initial level by more than a
few percent. For the time-response analysis, it was neceséary'to include
the nonlinear terms to obtain realistic resﬁlts; however, use of the lin-
earized equations in the frequency-domain analysis (Section 4 of this re-
port) is acceptable because the analysis is based on small reactivity and

power perturbations that oscillate around their initial values.

4. Frequency-Response Analysis

Because ‘a closed-loop frequency-response analysis provides informa-
tion about relative system behavior, the linear MSRE model was studied at
different power levels from this point of view. The linear system equa-
tions were first Laplace transformed and then solved for the ratio of an
output variable (such as power or temperature) to an input varisble (such

as reactivity). This ratio, called a transfer function, is

where
G(S) = transfer function,
0(S) = the output variable,
I(S) = input variable,
S = Laplace.transformeariable.

For & stable system, S may be replaced by jw, where J = V-1 and w is the

ifrequency of an input sine wave.  With this substitution, G(jw) is a com-
plex number; the magnitude of G(jw) is called the gain or the magnitude

ratio and is the ratio of ‘the amplitude of an input sinusoid to that of

an output sinusoid. The phase of G{jw) is the phase difference between

the input and the output sinusoids. A plot of G(jw) and the phase of

G(Jw) versus .w is referred to as a Bode diagram or a frequency-response

plot. A Bode plot provides qualitative stability information in the peaks -

of the magnitude ratio curves. - High, narrow peaks indicate lower stability.

“than flatter, broader peaks.

There are two basic reasons for calculating the frequency response

of a system. First, the frequency-response curves are good 1ndlcators-of

system performance, and seeohd,:the frequency response of a system may be

~experimentally determined. The latter consideration is important because

it provides a means for checking the validity of a model. - When the ex-

- perimentally determined frequency response of the system is in agreement

with that of the theoretical model, confidence is gained in the conclusions

‘drawn from the stability analysis applied to the model.

of power over the range from zero to 8 Mw. The primery reason for the
change in curve shape as the power level is changed is the_change in mag-
nitude of the temperature-feedback effect. At higher power levels a
smaller percentage change in,power71evgl causes & larger absolute tempera-
~ture change which, in tﬁrn, affects reactivity through the negative tem-
- perature coefficient. | '
| At higher power levels, the maximum peaks of the magnitude-ratio
plots decrease, and these maximums are reached at higher frequencies.
This implies that after a reactivity perturbation, the relative power re-
- sponse Sn/no will be of smaller magnitude and will tend to return to zero
faster at high power levels than it will at lower power levels. (This
observation was also made in the time-response calculationé of the pre-
ceding section.) '

The dip in the higher power curves at approximately 0.25 radian/sec
(corresponding to the fuel loop transit time of ~25 sec) results from tem-
perature feedback from the external loop. During a periodic reactivity
perturbation at a frequency of about 0.25 radian/éeq;'the-fuel in the
core during one cycle would return to the core one period later and pro-
‘duce a reactivity feedback effect that would partially cancel the exter-
nal perturbation. With the 22°U fuel the amplitude ratio of'the_frequenCy-
response curves was relatively low at this frequency, and the,dip‘ﬁas not
as pronounced. However, the amplitude ratio of the frequency-response
curves for the 233U‘fuel loading are relatively high out to greater than
1 radian/sec, so the loop feedback is emphasized. The more negative tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity for the 233y fuel also tends to -empha-
size the effect of loop feedback.

4,2 Effect of Mixing in the Fuel Loop

i-The curves in Fig. 6 were calculated with the model discussed in
Section 2 of this report. The choice of a 2-sec mixing pot at the core
outlet was based on the estimated mixing that occurs in the reactor ves-
sel plenums but was scmewhat arbitrary, and it was therefore desirable to
explore the effect of different mixing approximations on the frequency-

response curves. Figure 7 shows the effect on the 8-Mw frequency-response

curve of varying the lag time of the mixing pot from O to 5 sec. (Note
that mixing was still assumed to occur in each "lump” of the reactor and
heat exchanger and that in_thié—analysis theveffect of additional mixing
was considered.) The use of pure time delays (i.e., no mixing) to describe
flow in lines external to the core gives a plot with sharp curves. As the
time in the mixing pot increases, the curve becomes smoother. At low fre-
quencies (<0.06 radian/sec)'and at high frequencies (>1.0 radian/sec)‘ﬁhe
effect of mixing is negligible. At 10w-fréquencies the fuel temperature
changes slowly enough for the effects of additional mixing in the lines
to become insignificant, and at high.freéuencieSgthe neutron-kinetics ef-,.
fects déminate and temperature feedback from the external loop is unimpor-
tant. | |

The amount of mixing in a circulating fuel, such as in the MSRE, is
not easily determined analytically. The quantity of'interest'is not réally
the amount of salt "mixed" with other salt but, rather, the extent to which
the temperature of a slug of salt is affected by its surroundings during
its journey around the loop. Physical mixing of the salt, conduétive’heét
transfer with adjoining slugs of salt, convective heat transfer to the
pipe wall, and heat transfer in the heat exchanger all result in "mixing"
the salt temperature. The experimental results of the 33U testing pro-
‘gram may permit a determination of the size of the mixing pot that best
describes the actual physical situation in the MSRE. '

4.3 Sensitivity of 5n/ng* 8k to Parameter Changes

, The equations used to model the MSRE contain many independent parame-r
ters. Most of these are well known, but.conditionS‘may’be postulated un-
:der which their values might change. The effects on the magniﬁude ratio
of changes in each individual parameter'were determined by performingna
sensitivity analysis.3 The results of this analysis for selected vari-
ables are shown in Fig. 8. | | .

The frequency range in which each variagble is most important is &
parent from-the curves. In principle the theoretical frequency response
could be compared with the response determined experimentally and the pa-
rameter that might be changing could be selected, or it could be determined

thatlthe value of a certain parameter was estimated incorrectly in the
theoretical model. In practice, it is more likely that an actual change
in system performance would affect more than one parameter. For example,
& change in fuel-salt flow rate would affect the temperature feedback,
effective delayed-neutron concentration, prompt temperature effects in the
core, and heat transfer in the heat exchanger. The frequency response .
would be expected to change-in-the region where each of these variables
was important. Certainly any appreciable change in fuel-salt flow rate
| could be detected by an:experiméntal.freqﬁency-responée determination,
but to pinpoint the exact cause might be difficult. There are changes
other than fuel-salt flow rate that might have an effect on only cne or
two parameters. For these changes, it might be possible to determine the
exact cause of the anomalous behavior. Under any conditibns,.the sensi-
tivity analysis giVes valuable informatioﬁ as to the frequency range in -
which each parameter affects the system response and the relafive impor-'

tance of each parameter.

4.4 Frequency Response of Outlet Temperature to Power

Analyses of experimental datdvtaken.at'the end of operation with,235U

fuel showed that temperature perturbations were being introduced into the
core as a result of heat transfer fluctuations at the radiator. These
. were significant enough in some cases to appreciably affect the experimen-
 -tal frequency-response determination. This, together with the mixing
problem, led to a calculation of the frequency response of the reactor
outlet temperature with respect to power (8T/®n) to provide a means of
determining the effect of extraneous temperature disturbances.

From a theoretical standpoint, manytempefature-to-power'frequency
responses may be calculated. However, only those that may be experimen- '
tally verified are oﬁ’use,in,comparihg a theoretical model with a physi-
cal system or in determining the effect of outside influences (such as
wind velocity affecting the radiator heat transfer) during an actual test.
The model discussed previously was modified to include a term that rep-
-resented the fuel-salt temperature, as recorded by a thermocouple, 2.5
sec downstream of the outlet of the 2-sec mixing pot. This,positioﬁ‘was

chosen because it corresponds to the location of a particular thermocouple.

with a convenient output. The fésponsé of & thermocouple located on the

outside of a fuel-salt pipé to a Change in fuel-salt temperature was found®

to be adeQuately approximated by a l-sec pure time delay plus & 5-sec
first-order lag. A schematic diagram of the model that incorporates these
changes is shown in Fig.. 9. |

‘=Figure'10 gives the frequency reSponse,of'the salt temperature to
power changes and the thermocouple response to power changes. At low fre-

quencies these are the same, but at high frequencies there is an increas-

ing difference between the frequency response of salt temperature to power

changes and that of the indicated temperature to power changes because of
the finite time required to transfer heat through the pipe wall.
The effect of fuel mixing on the 6T/6n frequency response may also

- be seen in Fig., 10. In addition to the 2-sec mixing pot at the reactor

outlet, a 5-sec mixing pot was-included between the heat exchanger and the
core., -This'caused‘the.frequency-response plot to be smoothed between 0.1
and 0.3 radians/sec buﬁ'had'h9 noticeablé:effect at other frequencies.
Therdifferences in magnitude of theAST/Sn curves at low frequencies
for different power levels is caused by heat transfer changes at the ra-

diator. The:tube—to-airiheaf-transfer ¢oefficient was assumed to vary

with the air flow rate to the 0.6 power; The air flow rate was assumed

~ to vary linearly with the power level.

polynomial) in:the.Laplace.transform‘variable,s. The roots of this poly-
nomial are the poles of'thé,system-transfér function. These-roots-are
equal to .the eigenvalues of the system coefficient matrix,. A. . A necessary
and sufficient condition for linear asymptotic stablllty is that the sys—
tem poles (and therefore the. elgenvalues of A) have negative real parts.
This criterion gives a definite answer to the question of linear stability.
If the physical system has an N X N coefficient matrix (N'linear equations

location inthe complex'piane of the dominant eigenvalues. First, after

a stable system has been pertufbed,.the amplitude of the oscillstions in
a system variable decreases exponentially with a time constant equal to
the inverse of the distance of the dominant eigenvalue from.the imaginary
axis. Second, the transient overshoot of the system:is determined by the

~ 5.1.2 Eigenvalue Calculation Results. Figure 12 shows several of
the-doménantfeigenvalues plotted,for'various-power'levels. The ‘real part
of each calculated eigenvalue is'negative,,with,the general trgnd being -

 

toward smaller absolute valueS‘with decreasing power level. The negative
real parts insure linear asymptotic stabillty, and the trend toward smaller
‘absolute values with decreasing power level again points to a higher -de-
gree of stability at higher power levels. The eigenvalues that lie rela-
tively far removed from the real axis (those with positive imaginary com-
ponents between 0.20 and 0.30) are a result of the coupled energy-balance
feéuatibns and are relatively independent of‘nuclear power. - They do, how-
ever, exhibit some power dependence, primarily because of the variation
in heat transfer coefficient at the radistor with power level. The phys1-
cal implication of these eigenvalues is that any temperature disturbance
in the system would tend to cause slight-temperature oscillations around
the system, even if the nuclear power were zero. The eigenvalues for the
-nuclear'kinetics‘equationS‘were all on the real axis for the zero-power
condition.

The calculation for zero power resulted in a dominant eigenvalue-ﬁith
" a real part equal to —0.36 X 1077 sec”! and an-imaginary'part-equal to
0. O:, By proper manipulation of one coefficient in the system equations in
the fifth significant digit (the coefficients are generally not known to
better than four places) the value of the real part of the dominant eigen-
value could be changed from.a-small negative value to & small positive ;
value. . While from a mathematical standpoint .the positive sign would imply
“instebility, it must be realized that within the accuracy of the calcula-
tion, both these values are zero. A calculated value of identically zero

(the expected value at zero power) would have resﬁlted only if absolute
precision had been maintained throughout the calculation. |

As a point of general interest, a set of system equations with an
eigenvalue with real part equal to =1 X 10-6 sec~?! implies fhat a perturbed
system, after the inpﬁt perturbations has vanished, spontaneously returns
to its original state with a time constant of 10° sec (11.5 daYs); simi-
larly, an eigenvalue with real part equal to +1 X 10°% sec”?! would spon-
taneously deviate away from its original state with an-11.5-day'time con-
stant. While the difference in stability between these two cases is ob-
vious, neither would represent a difficult problem to;thercontrol system
designer, and either case would represent acceptable system behavier; or,
conversely, for a particular application, if one of these was unacceptable,
both would probably be unacceptable. _ | |

The eigenvalues that form the curve which goes to the ofigin at zero
power (see Fig. 12) were used to calculate the damping ratio, £. Results
of this calculation are listed below: |

Power ¢, Damping

 

(Mw) Ratio
0.1 0.16
5.0 0.96
8.0 0.99

Since there are eigenvalues on the real axis that have real parts of about
the same magnitude as those used in the calculation, the system damping
ratio cannot alone be used to determine the system oscillatory behavior;
however, it is useful as a relative indicator. The damping ratio again
emphasizes the MSRE characteristic of being less oscillatory at high power

‘levels than at low power.

5.2 Modified Mikhailov Method

5.2.1 Theoretical Discussion. An alternate technique for determin-
-ing absolute stability of a linear system was recently developed by Wright
and Kerlin® along the lines of the method of Mikhailov. The chief advan-

‘tage of this method over the eigenvalue technique is that no approximations
 

_27

are necessary to treat pure time delays. The technique of Wright and
Kerlin is based on a linear constant-parameter system of order N, which
can be written as a set of coupled, first-order differential equations
with constant coefficients: |
ax(t) _ ., =, Sy = - |
= = A x(t) +R(t,7) + B £(E), | (5)

where

x(t) = column vector of syétem state variables,

‘A = constent N X N coefflclent matrix,
£(t) = forcing functlon,
B = column vector of coefficients of £(t),
R(t,r) = matrix of time delay terms, each of the form
r x. t - .
JJ( i:i)

A Taplace transform of Eq. (5) yields
s x(S) = A x(8) + R(S,T) + B £(8) , | (6)
where S is the Laplace transform variable. The transform of one of the

time-lagged elements,

rijxj(t —_ 'rid) s
is
'ri;} , (S)e._sm ,
80 'R(s-,-'r') mey be written B |
R(s,7) = ws) ®s), (7)

where L(S) is & matrix composed of the ri4 e~STY terms. Substitution
’into Eq. (5) and manipulation yields

.x(S) |
—_— —[A - ST +1]°' B, - (8)

where I is the identity matrix, énd super —1 indicates the inverse matrix.

 
 

28

The absolute stability of the system is determined by the location of the

roots of ‘the equation
det (A—SI+1L)=0.

The ‘values of S for which the above equation is satisfied are the system
eigenvalues or characteristic roots.

In their development of the modified Mikhailov stability crit'ericn,
.Wright and Kerlin defined a quantity M(S) as | ‘

D(s) | _
M(S) = —— , (9)
-~ P(8) | | -
where
D(S) = det . (A— SI + L) , (10)
"P(8) = det (T — 8I), (11) .

and T is an N X N disgonal matrix, each element of which is the negative
of the absolute value of the corresponding elements of 'the A matrix. The
quantity P(8) can be considered to be a factor that normalizes D(S) in
both magnitude and phase. The stability criterion associated with M(S)
~is that "the number of zeros of the system determinant det (A — SI + L)

in the right half plane cquals the negative of the mumber of counterclock-
‘wise encirclements of the origin by the vector M(jw) as w goes from —o to
400, "4 yhile hot explicitly stated in this quotationthe important parame-
ter is the net number of encirclements of the origin, with clockwise .en=
circlements counting negative and counterclockwise encirclements counting
positive. Because of symmetry about the real axis it .is necessary only
to plot M(jw) for w running from O to 4. It can also be shown -that M(jw)
approaches 1.0 as.w becomes large, so -é, finite number of w values can com--
pletely describe the motion of M(jw).

5.2.2 Results of Applying the Mikhailov Sta.bility(Criterion. By
using a computer program developed by Wright and Kerlin, plots were gen-
-erated of ‘M(;jw) for w running from O to 4. Figures 13 through 17 show
these plots for several power levels. As shown, at significa.rrb power lev-

els there are no .encirclements of the origin as w goes from —© to « .As

Modified Mikhailov Plot for MSRE Operating with *33U Fuel

in the eigenvalue calculation, the results of zero-power calculations
were highly sensitive to small changes in coefficients in the system ma-
trix. While the zero-power plots actually show an encirclement of the
origin when the total plot from —o to +» is considered, the intercept at
—6.5 x 1078 should, of course, be interpreted as passing through the ori-
gin. This is typical for a zero-power reactor. ' |

Application of the modified Mikhailov stability criterion to the set
of system equations that describe the MSRE verlfles that the MBRE is in-
herently stable at all power levels.

6. Concluding Discussion

The overall result of this study is a determination that the MSRE
fueled with 233U is an inherently stable system at all pcwer levels of
interest. The response of the uncontrolled system at powers. above zero
power, as seen in the transient analysis and corroborated by the eigen-
values, is rapid and nonoscillatory at high powers and becomes sluggish
and oscillatory at low powers. It -is recommended that the 233{3_'—fue1ed
MSRE be subjected to a testing program at powers from zero to full power
to experimentally verify the predictéd response. These experiments should
be performed in such a way that both the 5n/k and 6T/6n transfer functions
can be determined, since both can now be compared with theoretical predic-

tions.

PADE APPROXIMATIONS

'In the analysis of phySical,systemS'it:frequentlyfbecomeS'necessary ’

‘instance, would be necessary to relate the outlet temperature to the in--

let temperature of a fluid flowing in plug flow through an adiabatic pipe

- if ‘the axial heat conductibn*were-negligible. If the inlet temperature
is x(t) and the delay time is ‘T, the outlet temperature will be x(t - T).
- The Laplace transform of a delayed variable x(t-— T) is x(8) e ', and if

a system containing time delays is to be analyzed simply, a linear approxi-

 

mation must be substituted for:e'TS. 'Oné3technique for approximating

The order of this approximation is 2n.  Stubbs and Singlel! have suggested

that ‘the criterion for selection of I, and 7, be such that the actual phase -
shift,

is as close as possible-to,theAideal phase shift for a pure time delay,

To meet this criterion,.they have suggested (for an- elghth-order Padé
approxlmatlon) that the follow1ng*values be used: '

, .rl = \f57—

T2 = 0.40

T3 = 1.0

'r4 = 0.5
11f12 = 1.68
1314 = 1.14

For ‘this choice of constants the phase error (¢ — do) in the Pad€ approxi-
mation is less than one degree at wl = 13.5 radians. A# higher frEQuen-
cies this error ‘increases, and at lower frequencies it decreases.

The followiﬁg linear equations have been developed for the eighth-
order Padf approximation, where x; is the variable input to the time de-
lay, xo is the delayed variasble output of the time delay, T is the delay
’time,.and'yi'throﬁgh yg are Padé varisbles: ‘
