FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radiochemistry is one of a number of
Subcommittees working under the Commjttee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sclences-Rationzl Research Council.
Its members represent government, industrial, and university
laboretories in the areas of nuclear chemistry and analyticael
chemistry.

The Subcommittee has concerned itself with those areas
of nuclear science which involve the chemist, such as the
collection and distribution of radiochemical procedures, the
establishment of speclifications for radiochemically pure reagents,
the problems of stockpiling uncontaminated materials, the avalla-
bllity of cyclotron time for service irradiations, the place of
radiochemistry in the undergraduate college program, etc.

This series of monographs has grown out of the need for
up~-to-date compilations of radiochemical information and pro-
cedures. The Subcommittee has endeavored to present a series
which will be of maximum use to the working scientist and which
contelns the latest available information. Each monograph
collects in one volume the pertinent information required for
radiochemical work with an individual element or a group of
closely related elements,

An expert in the radiochemistry of the particular element
has written the monograph, following e standard format developed
by the Subcommittee., The Atomic Energy Commission has sponsored
the printing of the series.

The Subcommittee 1s confident these publications will be
useful not only to the radiochemist but alsc to the research
worker in other fields such as physics, biochemistry or medicine
who wishes to use radicchemical techniques to solve a specific
problem.

. ISOTOPES OF BERYLLIUM

Only four isotopes of beryllium are known to exist, those having
mass numbers 7, 8, 9 and 10. One of these, BeB, ise completely
unstable, breaking up into two alpha parﬁcles in a time less than
10_15 sec. A short-lived isotope of mass 6 has been repor‘l:ed:l but
ite existence is doubtful. Of the remaining three, Be’ is the only
one which is stable, and constitutes the element. Beryllium is not
an abundant element, although its principal mineral, beryl, 3 BeO-
Ale 3" 6 SiOZ, is rather wide spread in occurrence. T_l}e average
befy]lium content of rocksz is only about 3 ppm, and sea water3
contains only about 5 x 10713 g/ml of the element.

. The isotopes of masses 7 and 410 are of interest in that they are

both relatively long-lived nuclides. B37 has a half-life of close to
54 day4, decaying by K-electron capture to stable LiT. Of these
decays, 12% go to a 0.477 Mev excited state of Li7 and the remainder
go to the ground state. 2 The only detectable radiation therefore is
the 0.477 Mev y ray, the x-rays of Li being much too soff to be
detectable by present techniques. The branching ratio of 12% to the
excited state of L17 is uncertain by 5 - 10 per cent,

Because of its rather low mass and convenient half-life, Be7 is
a nuclide of some interest in the study of nuclear reactions produced
artificially in the laboratory. It arises as a spallation producte'“‘10
in the nﬁclear reactions induced at high energies, and its production
11, 12 Pro-
duction of B_e7 by cosmic ray bombardment of the atmosphere has also

been observed. 13-15

at lower energies in light elements is of some interest.

The heaviest isotope of beryllium, Beio, ie quite long lived, with

a half-life of 2.5 x 108y. ‘n decays by p~ emission to the ground

state of stable Bio, and in keeping with the long half-life and
consequent slow build-up to detectable intensities, the production

of Be:10 in nuclear reactions in the laboratory is not likely to be
-gtudied radio —chemica_'l.ly; ' Howevef, Bei('J is produced as a spéllation

6,17
- product of cosmic ray action on the atmosphere:l ! 17 and on meteorites, 18
so that its occurrence in nature is of considerable interest to the

geochemist.
II. REVIEW OF BERYLLIUM CHEMISTRY OF INTEREST TO
RADIOCHEMISTS

1. General Considerations

In any radiochemical separation of a particular element the chemical
procedures which are used are governed in part by the amount of the
element which is present in the sample which is being analyzed. Iso-
topic carrier, in amounts of the order of milligrama, are often added
to the sample to facilitate the separations and to determine the chem-
ical recovery of the radioactive species. In the case of beryllium the
amount of beryllium carrier which. is to be added to the sample is
governed by which of the two radioisotopes is of interest: Be7 can
tolerate relatively large amounts of carrier without interfering with
the subsequent counting efficiency, whereas samples for counting Be10
should be as weéightless as possible. Fortunately radiochemical
procedures for beryllium are available which efficiently will isolate
amounts of beryllium r'angi.ng from sub-microgram up to macro -
amounts. '

In performing chemical separations with sensible quantities of
beryllium present it must be born in mind that beryllium is a very
toxic element. Care should be exercised to avoid ingestion of beryllium
through the mouth via pipettes or by inhalation of dust or volaetile

 

 

beryllium compounds. If beryllium —coﬁta.i.ning solutions are spilled
on the skin they should be rinsed off at once.

Beryllium is the lightest member of the group II elements. In
keeping with its position in the periodic chart it has only one oxidation
number, + 2. It is a very good example of the rule that the first member
of a group shows a strong chemical resemblance to the second member
of the next higher group: in its chemical behavior beryllium more
closely resembles aluminum than it does othef members of the group II
elements. |

Because of the electropositive nature of beryllium, and the existence
of only one oxidation number for the ion, exchange between carrier and
tracer species presents no problem so long as the Sample cbnta.inin.g them
is complefeiy homogeneous. The strong tenciency of bery]lium to o
hydrolyse and form colloidal aggrég'atgls. above pH 5 requires El:hat

carrier-tracer exchange be carried out in fairly acid solution.
- Many of the chemical proper‘l:iéé of beryllium which are important
in its radiochemical separations are associated with its ability to
form complex ions. These complexes will be treated first,

2. Complex Ions of Beryllium

Because of its _s:ﬁall size and its double charge, the beryllium ion
has a strong tendency toward the formation of complexes. Thus the
simple salte uniformly have 4 molecules of water of crystallization
per beryllium atom, and the hydration of the Be'™ ion forms a basis
for understanding the strong tendency toward hydrolysis and the
amphoteric properties of this species. Stability constants for several
beryllium complexes are given in Table 1.

The strong tendency of Be'™ ion toward complex formation shows
up in a rather peculiar way by its power to dissolve beryllium oxide.
The aqueous solution of any soluble salt of beryllium can dissolve up
to several molecular proportions of béry_llium oxide or hydroxide.
The reason for this is apparently the tendency to form the complex ion

Be(OBe)f , Where BeO molecules have replaced HZO molecules in

the aquo complex.

The complex formed between Be++ and CZO 4 = , i8 of some interest
inasmuch as it is the only oxalate of a divalent metal which is freely
soluble in water. It is a good illustration of the difference in chemical

behavior of beryllium from that of the remainder of the group II
elements. The low degree of ionization of the compound is evidence
that it exists as a chelate complex.

The complex formed between beryllium and fluoride ion is worth
noting. Excess fluoride ion forms the complex anion BeF =, which
resembles very closely the sulfate anion. Thus BaBeF4 forms an
insoluble precipitate and finds a use in the final precipitation of beryllium
in radiochemical analyses. The soluble nature of sodium ﬂuorobgryllate
can be used to advantage where mineral specimens are fused with
fluorides to render them soluble. 19 The complex is a fairly sirong
one, but may be completely destroyed by the addition of excess H3BO3.

Beryllium ion is soluble in 10% (N’H4)ZCO3 solution at pH 8. 5-9,
presumnably because of the formation of a complex carbonate anion.

This property of beryllium has been used in an ion exchange technique
for the separation of beryllium from copper and nickel. 20

The f_orma.tion of a BeHZPO 4 complex which limits the phosphatg

content of solutions which are to be used in certain cation exchange

2
separations has been reported.

3. Chelate Complexes of Beryllium

Bery]liurﬁ forms nurnerous chelate complexes with a variety of
complexing agents. These complexes may be divided into two groups
according to whether they are neutral or negatively charged.

Neutral complexes are derived either from hydroxy-keto compounds,
i.e. p-keto-enois, B-keto-esters and hydroxyquinones, or are a special
clags of covalent derivatives of carboxylic acids. A large number
of hydroxy -keto compounds have been studied as chelating agents in
the colorimetric determination of trace amounts of beryllium. 21 For
details of these procedures the original literature should be consulted.

There are four chelating agents which deserve special mention
because of the important roles which they play in radiochemical separa-
tions of beryllium. The first of these which will be mentioned is
ethylenediamminetetraacetic acid (abbreviated EDTA), and for the reason
that it forms a much stronger complex with many metals than it does
with beryllium. Table I lisfs stability constants for a number of metal
ions with EDTA. The value of ~ 3.8 for beryllium is sufficiently

smaller than those of other common metal ions that _sever_al useful
separations may be carried out using EDTA: to prevent interference from
other metal species. For example, beryliium hydroxide may be precipitated
with ammonia in the presence of aluminum, without the latter precipitating,
if excess EDTA is present. Other examples of similar applications will
be cited later.

A second very useful chelating agent for berylium is acetylacetone.
The chelate compound beryllium acetylacetonate, Be(C 5H7OZ)2
melting (108°) volatile (b.p. 270°) golid, ineoluble in water but soluble"

is a low
in organic solvents. This chelate compound forms the basis for a

solvent extraction procedure for amounts of beryllium as small as the
carrier-free tracer (see part III-6), Owing to the volatility of the
chelate compound, care must be exercised in reducing solutions of
tracer beryllium to dryness .wher'e acetylacetone has been used, in
order to avoid lose of the tracer. 23

A third chelating agent which is useful for the isolation of beryllium
is the compound thenoyltrifluoroacetone (T'TA). The complex with
beryllium is slow to form and to decompose, a property which makes
possgible a solvent-extraction separation of beryllium from a number
of other cations. 24 The non-volatility of this complex is an advantage
over acetylacetone where tracer amounts of beryllium are concerned.

The fourth chelating agent of significance to beryllium separations
is acetic acid. Beryllium is almost unique in form.:inlg a series of
complex compounds with carboxylic acids, of the general formula
Be ,O (O-CO-R),. These compounds are non-ionized, soluble in organic
solvents, and volatile. The best known of these ig the acetate, 'basic'
beryllium acetate, which is formed by treating beryllium hydroxide
with acetic acid or acetic anhydride. It is generally employed for
solvent extraction of beryllium in radiochemical analyses, although the
stability and volatility of the complex (b.p. 330°) permits its isola-
tlon by distillation.

The second group of chelate complexes of beryllium are those
which possess a negative charge. Complexes of this type have been
prepared with a number of complexing anions including oxalate, malonate,
citrate, Salicylate and sulfate. The complex formed with oxalate has
been used in the back-extraction of beryllium acetylacetone from the
organic phase in a solvent extraction procedure for beryllium. 23
Complex formation with citrate has been demonstrated and used in the
ion exchange separation of the group II metals. 24 The salicylate
analogues sulfosalicylate and gentisic acid (2, 5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid)
have been used as complexing agents in an ion exchange procedure for
separation of berylliumzs and for the spectrophotometric determination
of beryllium. 26

Details of the solvent extractiion and ion exchange procedures
involving chelate complexes of beryllium will be outlined in parts II1-6
and -7. '
4. Soluble Compounds of Beryllium-

Beryllium hydroxide is a weak base and therefore solutions of its
salts are exiensively hydrolysed, forming ions like Be(OH)+ and
probably also colloids of the form (BeO)x Be++. Salts of such weak
acids as HCN, HZS and HZCO3 are almost completely hydrolysed in
water.. The hydrolysis of beryllium solutions leads to the absorption of
beryllium onto the walls of the containing vessel. Figure 1 shows the
percentage adsorption of Be7 from carrier-free solutions in
0.1 M NaCl buffered with 0. 004 M NaAc as a function of pH. e The pH
was varied by addition of HCl or NaOH. Absorptions as high as 20%

on glass containers were observed at the higher pH's.

and glass vessels as a function of the pH of the

solution.- Data of reference 2.

Beryllium salts of strong mineral acids such as HNOB, HC1, HBr,
HZSO & HCI10O 4 €ic are all quite soluble in water and the salts themselves
are usually hygroscopic. The strong tendency of beryllium to form
complex ions is shown by the fact that these salts always cry'stallize
from aqueous solution with at least 4 molecules of water per atom of
beryllium, corresponding to the tetraaquo complex.

Soluble complex ions with F_, oxalate, citrate, etc. have already
been mentioned (parts III-2 and -3).

The action of strong bases such as NaOH or KOH first precipitate
insoluble Be(OH)Z-aq, but addition of excess base causes the precipitate
to redissolve. At room temperature the solubility of freshly precipi-
tated beryllium hydroxide in 0. 39 N, 0.65 N and 1.99 N NaOH is
reported to be 0, 06, 0.144 and 0. 66 moles of BE(OH)Z per liter, 21
The solution, however, is unstable. On long standing, or on boiling,
beryllium is reprecipitated as a dense crystalline precipitate corres-
ponding to the formula 'Be(OH)Z. The amphoteric nature of beryllium
hydroxide is a very useful property in radiochemical separations, but
whenever a strong base is used to dissolve beryllium from a mixture
of insoluble, non-amphoteric hydroxides the mixture should not be
subjected to prolonged boiling to effect solution of the beryllium lest

the opposite of the desired result be obtained.

5. Insoluble Compounds of Beryllium

The most important insoluble compound of beryllium, so far as
radiochemical separations is concerned, is the hydroxide. It is
precipitéted from aqueous solution by dilute base. Because of the
amphoteric nature of the freshly precipitated hydroxide, the best
precipitant for beryllium is ammonium hydroxide buffered with NH 4+ ion.
The precipitate of beryllium, which begins to appear at around pH 5,
is essentially insoluble in an excess of this reagent. Precipitation
of beryllium at the methyl red end point (pH ~6) has been recommended. 28

Precipitation of dense, unhydrated Be(OH)Z from boiling alkaline
solution has been mentioned above in connection with the amphoteric
properties of beryllium. A somewhat similar result is obtained if the
complex carbonate of beryllium in ammonium carbonate solution is
‘boiled. In this case there is obtained a white, granular pre-c-ipitate of
basic beryllium carbonate of somewhat indefinite composiﬁon.

Addition of sodiuni bicarbonate solution to a solution of beryllium also
precipitates basic beryllium carbonate. Ignition of the hydroxides or
the basic beryllium carbonate results in beryllium oxide.

Because of the weakneas of the acid, and the consequent strong
tendency to hydrolysis of the resulting compounds, the phosphates of
beryllium have a rather complicated chemistry. At lower pH's soluble
compounds may be obtained, while at higher pH's Ingoluble precipitates
of gelatinous nature, and therefore difficult to identify, are formed.
However, an insoluble crystalline precipitate approximating NH 4BePO 4
may be obtained by adding (NH 4:)Z]EIPO 4 to beryllium solutions at pH 5. 5?9

Ignition of the precipitate results in Be ZPZOT This plrocedure is
therefore useful in obtaining beryllium in a dense form of known
composition.

Another method for precipitating beryllium which has some
advantages over the others involves formation of the BeF 4= complex
anion by addition of excess F ion, followed by the addition of excess
Ba++ ion. The solution should be aci-dj_t‘-ied and only a slight excess
of Ba++ ion should be used in order to prevent the precipitation of
BaFZ. The resultant precipitate of insoluble BaBeF 4 is fine-grained
and very difficult to filter through the usual types of dense filter
paper. Digestion of the precipitate for 10 minutes prior to filtra-
tion helps somewhat, but the filtration problem can be overcome
completely through the use of RA -type Mﬂliporg filters. The compact,
dense, and anhydrous precipitate does not require ig’nitidn as do the
others mentioned above. This is a distinct advantage in eliminating
the health hazard associated with the transfer of ignited beryllium
precipitates, which tend to "dust'. The BaBeF 4 Precipitate is much
more readily redissolved than ignited BeO, being easily dissolved in
a mixture of H3BO3 and HNO3. This is a useful property where
further chemical processing is needed to remove unwanted radioactive
contaminants from a beryllium sample.

Ber:yllium's strong tendency toward hydrolysis, and the insolubility
of its hydroxide in near neutral solutions, means that beryllium will
tend to co-separate on precipitates when the solution is not at least
moderately acid. 29 Almost any precipitate which is forn%ed in a solution
containing beryllium at pH~7 will co-precipitate the beryllium to some
extent. Particularly useful in this respect _:ﬁ-e gelatinous hydroxides
such as those of aluminum and iron. Using Fe(OH), as the co- '
precipitant for beryllium allows the beryllium to be recovered from the
precipitate by treatment with cold NaOH solution, or by other means.

6. Solvent Extraction. of Beryllium Compounds
The chelate complexes of beryllium with acetylacetone, TTA, and

acetic acid, which were mentioned in part III-3 above, lend themselves

to very useful solvent extraction procedures for beryllium. These will
be given in detail below,

Ac e1_:zla.cetone .

By shaking or stirring aqueous solutions containing beryllium at
pH 4.5 - 8 with acetylacetone a chelate complex is formed which is
soluble in organic solvents. Either pure acetylacetone, a solution
of acetylacetone in benzene or CCl4 may be used. The use of a small
quantity of pure acetylacetone hastens the formation of the chelate
complex, after which the complex may be extracted into benzene or
other suitable solvent. By stirring a solution at pH 4.5, containing
about 1 microgram of beryllium with 4 ml of acetylacetone for
5 minutes, and then adding 20 ml of benzene and stirring for 20 minutes
longer, Toribara and Chen found that essentially 100% of the

29 Bolomey and Broido?'3

beryllium is transferred to the 6rga.nic phase.
shook 25 ml of 10% acetylacetone in benzene with 25 m] of a solution
containing carrier-free beryllium tracer at pH 6 for 2 hours and

. found that all but a trace of the activity was exiracted into the

organic phase.

A great many other metal ione likewige form chelates with acetyl-
acetone, and under the conditions described above many of them would
also be extracted. The use of EDTA makes the extraction more specific
for beryllium. Alimarin and G:lba.lo30 studied the extraction of beryllium
acetylacetonate into CCl 47 CHC1 3 butyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol
containing acetylacetone from aqueous solutions containing EDTA
and Al, Fe, and Cr, and the divalent ions of Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cd,
Pb, Cu, Ca and Mg. When excess EDTA was present only beryllium was
extracted into the organic phase. CCl-4 proved to be the best of the
solvents which were studied. In strongly ammoniacal solution aluminum
and iron acetylacetonates could also be extracted,

The organic phase containing beryllium acetylacetonate may be
washed with acidified water to remove unwanted impurities without
the loss of appreciable amounts of bery].lium23. About 2 drops of
0.1 N HC1 to 25 ml of water makes a satisfactory wash solution for
this purpose.

The beryllium acetylacetonate complex may be decomposed and
the beryllium back extracted into water by shaking the organic phase

11
coritaining the chelate complex with equal volumes of either 10%
oxalic acid or 6 N HCl. Bolomey and Broido23 report that 96% of
tracer beryllium is back extracted in 2 hours under these conditions.
Toribara and Chen29 report that 15 minutes stirring of the organic
phase with 5 N HCI] is sufficient to transfer the beryllium to the
aqueous phase. Because of the volatility of carrier-free beryllium

acetylacetonate, acetylacetone which dissolves in the acid used to

a number of other metal cations using this reagent. The complex
is rather slow to form and to decompose. In Figure 2 is shown the
rate of extraction of beryllium by 0.04 M TTA in benzene at different
pH's. The optimum pH for the extraction seems to be about 7, with
extraction of beryllium being essentially complete in about 3 hours.
The extraction of iron (III), aluminum and copper by 0.01 M TTA
in benzene at different pH values is shown in Figure 3. Evidently
aluminum is also extracted quite favorably at pH 7, but the extraction
of iron is relatively much less favorable at the higher pH.

hydrochloric acid is shown in Figure 4. Back extraction of Ca, Fe,
Zn, Sr and Y is complete in 15 minutes. Aluminum requires é hours,
and beryllium at least 80 hours, for ''complete' back-extraction.
However, the use of 2 parts concentrated formic acid to 1 part
concentrated HC1 accomplishes the back-extraction of beryllium in

a matter of a few minutes (cf. Section VI, Procedure 12).

The solvent extraction method using TTA works equally well for
tracer or micro amounts of beryllium. For tracer concentrations of
beryllium T'TA has the advantage over acetylacetone that there is no
loss of beryllium through volatilization of the beryllium - TTA complex.

Acetic acid.

When freshly precipitated beryllium hydroxide is evaporated slowly
to dryness several times with glacial acetic acid3z, or wﬁen beryllium
acetate is heated to 200° 014, there is formed the chelate compound
Be4O(O-CO-CH3)6, '"bagic'' beryllium acetate. It is a crystalline

substance ihsoluble in cold water, but readily soluble in most common

14
organic solvents except alcohol and ether. Chlorofarm ig the solvent
most commonly employed. The solution of ''basic' beryllium acetate
in chloroform is remarkably stable and may be washed free of other
cations by extracting with water acidified with HC1 or with water alone.
Recovery of beryllium from the chloroform solution may be accomplished
by extraction with reagent II‘:[NO3 or by evaporation of the chloroform
followed by decomposition of the basic beryllium acetate by heating with
concentrated HN03.

The preparation of basic beryllium acetate i85 somewhat time-
consuming., This disadvantage is offset somewhat by the specificity of '
the procedure for beryllium.

7. Ion Exchange Behavior of Beryllium

The strong tendency of beryllium toward complex formation makes
possible ite separation by a variety of ion exchange techniques. These

are summarized in Table III and discussed in detail below.

Cation Exchange Re sins:

 

Separation of beryllium from other cation species by cation exchange
may be accomplished in Beveral ways. Beryllium is strongly absorbed
on the cation exchange resin Dowex 50 at pH 6 - 8, presumably owing to
colloid formationz. At lower pH's beryllium will pass slowly through
a cation exchange resin solumn>>. Ehmann and I«.’.ohr:r:ua'a.n28 passed a
1.1 M HCI1 solution containing Be and Al through a Dowex 50 column, a.nd
followed it with 1.4 M HCl. At a flow rate of 1 resin volume of eluent
per 25 minutes the beryllium was completely eluted with é or 7 resin
volumes of 1.4 M HCl. Under these conditions aluminum begins to elute
only after 12 to 15 resin volumes of 1.1 M HC! have been passed through
the column.

Milton and Gru.mmi’cl:34 have used 1.5 M HC1 as eluting agent and
Dowex 50 resin to effect a separation of beryllium from the cther
members of the alkaline earth family. Their results are shown in
Figure 5. |

Hond:s:.35 and Kald.ha.na36 have linvestiga.ted the elution of beryllium
from Dowex 50 reain by the usge of dilute Ca or Mg solutions. These

cations -displace Le from the column, which therefore passes through,

16
but cations such as Al which are more strongly held than the alkaline
earths are retained by the resin. | |
Complexfi.ng agents, for either unwanted cations or beryllium, have
' been used in the sepa_ration.of beryllium by cation exchange resins.

Merrill,Honda and .A.I'J:Lold2 have studied the effect of various complexing

separation of beryllium from iron and aluminum. Table IV showe the
small uptake of aluminum by Dowex 50 when excess EDTA is present. 2
Using Amberlite IR-120 resin in the sodium form Nadkarni, Varde and
Athavale 38 found that from solutions containing excess NaZHZ EDTA

at pH 3.5 beryllium was absorbed by the resin while aluminum, calcium
and iron passed through the column. If HZOZ was present titanium also
passed through the column unabsorbed by the resin.

Oxalic acid is useful for the separation of beryllium from such ions
as Fe+3, A1+3, U02+2, and Th+4. Oxalic acid, 0.4 M solution, may be
used to elute these ions while beryllium is retained on the column. 2

earths by means of ammonium lactate hag been deacribed by Milton and
Grummitt. 34 Using 0.55 M ammonium lactate at pH 5 as the eluant, a
flow rate of 1 ml/min., and a Dowex 50 column maintained at a temper-
ature of 78° C, beryllium was eluted from a 1.1 x 8 cm column in less
than 2 interstitial column volumes. This was considerably in advance

of magnesium, which began to elute at around 2.5 interstitial column

volumes,

19
The use of palicylate analogs for selective elution of beryllium
adsorbed on a Dowex 50 reain column has been reported by Schubert,
Lindenbaum and Westfall. ?'_2' Using 0.02 - 0,410 M sulfosalicylic acid at

pH 3.5 - 4.5 beryllium is selectively eluted while Cu.H-,l uo t and Ca++

2
iong remain firmly on the column. If iron is also adsorbed on the

column it can be eluted before the beryllium with 0.4 M sulfosalicylic -
acid at pH 2. 1,

When 0.1 M gentisic acid at pH 6, 0 is used to elute a Dowex 50
column (H - form) containing adsorbed Ca++ and Be++ ions the beryllium
- comes off in a sharp band, beginning when the pH of the effluent reaches
1.9, reaching a maximum at pH 2.-74 and complete when the effluent
reaches pH 5. 60. 25 Under these conditions calcium is still retained on
the column.

Starting with 150 ml of solution containing 1.1 g of Ca.Clz, 5 pg of
Be, and 0.1 M in sulfosalicylic acid at pH 4.5, these authors passed the
solution through a column containing 15 g of air —dried Dowex 50 resin
which had been equilibrated with 0.4 M sulfosalicylic acid at pH 4. 5.
Beryllium pasaed completely through the column with the aid of 70 ml
of wash solution (0.1 M sulfosalicylic acid at pH 4. 5) while calcium was
completely adsorbed. | '

Rapid elution of beryllium adsorbed on a cation exchange resin
which has been washed free of unwanted cations may be accomplished
by sirong (> 3 M) HCI, 33, 38, 44 or by a solution of 0.5 M NaAc and
1M H.Acz. In the latter case 0.5 - 1,5 column volumes of effluent
contain all the beryllium, which may be recovered as Be(OH)2 by
adding NH 4OH'?'.

Anjon Exchange Resing:

The use of anion exchange resins in the separation of metal cations

 

implies the formation of negatively charged complex ions, either of the
depired element to be separated, or of unwanted impurities. As an
example of the latter, in hydrochloric acid solution beryllium does nof
form a complex with chloride ion of sufficient strength to be absorbed
on Dowex I resin. 45 A great many other metal ions do, however,

form chloride complexes which are absorbedl by Dowex I resin, 40-42.
Beryllium :ﬁay therefore be separated from these elements by simply

passing the solution in hydrochloric acid of appropriate strength

20
through a Dowex I resin column. Unwanted ions will be adsorbed while
beryllium will pass through unadsorbed.

Even though beryllium shows negligible adsorption onto Dowex I resin
from 12 M HCI solutions, it is interesting that there is adsorption of
beryllium from 13 M LiCl -soluti'on. 43 With a distribution coefficient of
8 in this solution (Be adsorbed per Kg resin/Be remaining per liter
of solution) beryllium could be separated by anion exchange from non-
adsorbable elements such as alkali metals and magnesium by this technique.

Anion exchange separations of beryllium based on the formation of
negative complexes of beryllium do not appear to have been extensively
used. Ehmann and Koh::nzmz'8 have used the oxalate complex of
beryllium to effect radiochemical purification of beryllium. Beryllium
chloride solution, after evaporation to dryness was taken up in 0.1 M
HZ.CZ.O4 - 0.15 M HC1 (pH = 0. 9) solution and passed through a 4" x 1/2"
column of Dowex I resin at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was by
the same solution, which effected the eleution of beryllium in 5 resin
volumes.

Nelson and Kraus’® studied the peparation of the alkaline earth
elements by anion exchange using citrate solutions and Dowex I resin.
Beryllium is more sirongly absorbed than the other Imembers of the
family at low citrate concentrations, although at citrate concentrations
greater than about 0.1 M magnesium is more strongly absorbed than
beryllium. Effective separation of beryllium from Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra
may be accomplished by this technique, but the sepax.-at'ion from magnesgium
is less satisfactory. Using 1 M (NH 4) 3Cit at pH 8 beryllium comes off
first, but the last portion of beryllium will be contaminated with magnesium.
Alternatively, using 0.2 M (NH 4)3Ci‘l: at pH 4. 3 magnesium comes off
first but tdils badly and contaminates the beryllium as it is eluted from

the column.

IV. PROCEDURES FOR DISSOLVING SAMPLES CONTAINING
COMPOUNDS OF BERYLLIUM

Inasmuch as the common salts of beryllium, the chloride, fluoride,

nitrate, sulfate etc., are freely soluble in water, the problem of

21
dissolving the sample is that of rendéring soluble the matrix material
in which the beryllium is imbedded. For the gpecial case of beryllium

. metal itself the best solvents are hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The
metal also dissolves in alkali hydroxide soluticns owing to the amphoteric
character of the element. Nitric acid, either concentrated or dilute,
is not a suitable solvent for it renders the metal passive.

The radioberyllium content of meteorites and of varicus sediments
and rocks is of considerable interest to the geochemist. F¥or iron meteorite
material aqua regia is the solvent commonly employed. For siliceous
materials HF is the appropriate solvent; the silica is volatilized,
eliminating a bulky and otherwise troublesome component from the
sample. At the same time the beryllium forms a complex with fluoride
which should ensure good carrier-tracer exchange. However, care
should be taken to decompose the fluorides, and the beryllium
complex, before proceeding with the separation. The BeF 4= complex
ion is similar in behavior to the SO, anion. The best method for
destroying the BeF 4 complex is to trgat the sample with HBO 3 after the
bulk of the fluorides have been decomposed by treatment with HZI\TO3 or
HZSO 4 . |

Because of the formation of BeF 4_ complex ion with fluorides, the
use of a NaF fusion to render soluble the beryllium in siliceous samples
has been reported by Ru.mlig.

V. COUNTING TECHNIQUES FOR USE WITH ISOTOPES OF BERYLLIUM

Counting of Be7
The only ohservable radiation from BeT is a y ray of 0. 477 Mev

energy emitted in ~ 42% of the decays (see Part II). Scintillation
counting is the obvious choice for detection of these y rays. Because
of the possibility that other y-emitting species, or |3+—emi1:ting 'species
which would give rise io 0.54 Mev annihilation quanta, might be
present in the sample the counting of Be7 can be done with assurance
only if a y ray spectrometer 1s available for exemining the y ray
spectrum from the sample.

In addition to the criterion of radiochemical purity, i.e. the
beryllium sample for counting must show only a 0. 477 Mev ¥ ray,

22
one may also require that the sample emit no particle radiations,
since Be7 emits none. In particular; this is a requirement when Be7
is produced in nuclear reactions in the laboratory. As discussed in
Part 1I, production of §~emitting Beio in significant intensities in
these instances is negligible. For the study of Be7 produced in nature
by cosmic ray action, Beio is also known to be 1:>roc1uLceciié)—ﬁ'8 S0
that a low intensity of § emission from Bei0 is to be expected.

A third criterion of the radiochemical purity of a beryllium sample
is the half-life for decay of the sample, which should be 54 day.
Because of the long time lapse required to egtablish a half-life of
this magnitude, particularly for samples of low activity, it is generally
desirable to establish the radiochemical purity of the sample by other
means.

Where other means of establishing the identity of a radioactive
species are lacking, the constancy of the specific activity {counting
rate per mg of sample) of the sample when put through a number of
radiochemical purification steps is usually sufficient to demonsirate
that the activity is isotopic with the element of the sample.

The most difficult situation for extablishing the presence of
Be7 in a radiochemically pure condition in a counting sample arises when
the intensity is very low, of the order of 30 ¢/m or less, in which case
it may be very difficult to obtain an accurate 7 ray spectrum or to
detect low intensities or particle-emitting impurities. One must then
fall back on the constancy of the specific activity as a criterion for
establishing the identity of the activity which is being counted. One
must therefore have a very reliable and specific radiocchemical procedure
for beryllium in order to minimize the possibility of having a radioactive
contaminant in the counting sample. In this regard it is worth drawing

attention tc the nuclide "1‘12029 which decays by K and L capture to

HgZGZ with the emission of 0. 44 Mev y rays. Is y ray energy is so

close io that of Be7 that the chance of producing this species by

nuclear reactions on mercury and lead isofopes should not be ocverlooked.
. The clogeness in energy of the ¢ ray of Be7 to 0. 51 Mev annihilation

quantz makes rather easy the determination of absolute disintegration

rates of Be7 samples. Solutions of the §5+—emitting species Naz

which have been accurately standardized for their sbsolute specific

23
activities are commercially available for calibration purposes.
Provided the source is sufficiently thick to stop all positrons, the
rate of emission of 0.51 Mev annihilation quanta will be just twice the
positron emission rate of the source. The éource may then be used to
determine the detection efficiency of the scintillation detector for
0. 51 Mev quanta, which will be very close to the detection efficiency
for 0.477 Mev quanta.

N’a22 ‘has also a 1. 28 Mev y ray which complicates matters somewhat,
since this y ray will also give rise to some pulses equivalent in
energy to those arising from 0. 51 Mev quanta. In 6rder to get around
this difficulfy it is necessary to determine the detection efficiency of
the scintillator in the neighborhood of the 0. 51 Mev photo peak. This
is best done using a ecintillation spectrometer with a window which can
be opened to straddle the photopeak. Cdntributions to the observed
counting rate within this window from the 1,28 Mev y ray of a Na>?
source may be estimated in the following way. The counting rates
in the energy region a little above and a little below the 0.5%1 Mev
photopeak is first measured using a rather small window to obtain the
counting rate per unit window width in these two regions. These
counting rates will be aJinost entirely due to 1. 28 Mev quanta, and can
be used to estimate the contribution to the counting rate in the region
of the 0. 51 Mev photopeak by ihterpolation between them. In a typical
2 inch well-type scintillation detector the contribution from 1.28 Mev
quanta to the counting rate in the 0. 54 Mev photopeak amounts to about
17% of the total. '

Having established the counting rate, R, of annihilation quanta which
fall within the window of the spectrometer, the detection efficienty, E,
of the spectrometer with the window straddling the 0. 54 Mev photopeak
is given by

' R
E—ﬁf&

D is the positron emiasion rate of the source and fa is a factor
to correct for absorption of 0. 51 Mev quanta within the source. Provided
the source is not too thick, fa is not a very significant factor, and can
be made to cancel a similar correction factor for beryllium if the

Naz'2 sample is about the same thickness as the beryllium samples.

24
Having determined the counting efficiency of the scintillator for
0.54 Mev quanta, the base line of the spectrometer is shifted downward
an appropriate amount so that the window of the spectrometer straddles
the 0.477 Mev photopeak of Be7. The same window width should be used
as for the 0.54 Mev annihilation photopeak, in which case the detection
efficiency of the spectrometer is very close to E. For a typical 2 inch
Weil—type scintillation detector E has a value of about 6 percent for
0.5 Mev quanta.

Restricting the energy interval in which pulses wili be counted o
the photopeak resulis in an appreciable loss in counting rate of the
source over that which could be obtained if a window were not used, With
strong Be? source the disintegration rate of the source could be
determined as outlined above and the sample used to determine the
counting eificiency of a scinfillation counter which counts all pulses above
a minimum threshold. This is satisfactory for sources with counting
rates in excess of a few hundred counts per minute. With very weak
sources, however, counting with a2 window is usually to be preferred
because it resulis in a more favorable sample-to~-background counting
ratio. |
Counting of Be10

Because of the long half life of Beio, and the fact that this nuclide is
likely to be of importance only in nuclear reactions produced through the
action of cosmic rays, the disintegration rate of any sample containing
Béio will be very small indeed. When the low B decay energy of
0.555 Mev is congidered also, the counting of Beio becomes a formidable
task. Evidently Geiger or proportional counting of thin samples in
some type of low level counter is called for.

Since procedures are available for isolating beryllium in carrier-
free amounts, counting samples which are very thin can be prepared.
Presumably the thickness of the final sample is limited by the
beryllium content of the starting material which is analysed. If
such a carrier-free separation were attempted, the recovery efficiency
of Beio could be obtained by measuring the recovery of a Be7 "spike"
which was added at the beginning of the analysis. Of course the amount
of B(—:f7 spike to be added should be chosen so that its counting rate does

not overwhelm that due to Beio., The much lower counting efficiency

25
of Be'? v radiation in a Geiger or proportional counter means that
roughly 100 times the disintegration rate of Be7 coﬁ:pared with Be10
may be present in the sample before the accuracy of counting of
Be10 is impaired.

The identity of Be10 in a sample from the carrier-free separation

of beryllium could be determined in a manner similar io that which is
10

used when carrier is present. The constancy of the ratio of the Be
counting rate to that of Be7 tracer, when repeated chemical separations
are performed on the sample, should suffice to demonstrate that any

p activity is due to Beio.

Because of the complexity of the chemical separation which may
be required in some instances for isolating beryllium in a pure
condition, or in high yield, it may be necessary to add beryllium
carrier. In this case tﬁe final sample for counting will have an
appreciable thickness, and the counting efficiency will be somewhat
impaired. |

Two systems for counting moderately thick Beio samples have
been described. The earlier of theseib uses a thin wall cylindrical
counter of the type described by Sugihara, Wolfgang and Libby. 46
The beryllium counting sample is mounted on the inside walls of two
hemi-cylinders by deposition from a slurry of the sample in alcohol.

The hemicylinders are then placed In close contact with the
thin wall counter. Under these conditions the geometry of the counter
is about 40%. To reduce background the coumter is surrounded by a
ring of anti-coincidence counters. Because the sample area can be
quite large under these conditions the sample can be made quite thin.
However, correction for gself-absorption of the radiations is necessary,
and may be determined by the method of Suttle and Libby. 47

Figure 7 shows an absorption curve in polyethylene of the radiations
from Be‘10 using such a counter. 16 The measurement of the absorption
curve of the radiations from a beryllium sample serves as é check
on the radioactive purity of the sample, and the data may be used'
to calculate the self absorption of the radiations by the sample,

Ehmann and Kohmanza have recenily described a counting procedure
for measuring very low levels of Beio and other naturally-occurring

' radioactive species. They use a side-window counter having a window

much as the initia.l.radioacti'vity usually decreases on recyéling. _
The initial chemical yield someﬂmes exceeds 100 percent, indicating
_incoi:nplete separat'ion from bulk consfituents, although a given -
specimen of stoney meteorite might contain appreciable amounts of
beryllium, It éppeara that at least three recyéles may be necessary -
to get rid of all contaminating activities and inert impurifies. The
introduction of an extractioﬁ step using acetylacetone, following thé

. directions given in Section IIIJ:', would probably brove of value in
eliminating these difficulties. Such an extraction step could be
introduced after step 13, using an excess of EDTA to hold back Al,
or the extraction could be carfied out following Step 17 after
precipitating Be with NH 4OH.

separation of beryllium from cyclotron targets of copper, silver and gold.
Two cycles of the procedure have resulted in a decontamination factor
of 3 x 10° and a chemical yleld of 90%.

Procedure;

Step 1. Dissolve the sample in an appropriate acid and add
beryllium (about 15 mg) to the sample contained in a
centrifuge tube (50 ml). Stir well, then precipitate Be(OH)2

with a slight excess of NH 4OH. Centrifuge and discard the
supernatant solution.

Step 2. Dissolve the Be(OH)Z precipitate in 10 ml conc. HCl. Pass
through a short column of Dowex 1X-10 resin which has been
washed with conc. HC1 (Note 1). Wash the resin with 5 ml
conc. HC1l. Collect the effluent in a centrifuge tube.

Step 3. Reprecipitate Be(OH)Z with a slight excess of NH 4OH. Cen-
trifuge and discard the supernatant solution. Wash the
precipitate with 15 ml of water and discard the wash.

Step 4. Dissolve the Be(OI-I)Z precipitate in min. of conc. HC1l. Add
3 mg Fe III carrier, dilute to 15 ml and heat on a water
bath. Add 40 ml 8 N NaOH with stirring, and heat until
Il?‘e(O]EI)3 coagulates. Centrifuge and decant the supernatant
solution to a clean centrifuge tube,

Step 5. Acidify the solution with HC1 and then precipitate Be(OH)Z
with a slight excess of NH 4OH. Centrifuge and discard the
supernatant solution,

Step 6. Dissolve the precipitate in 3 ml glacial acetic acid and
dilute the solution to 15 ml with water. Add 2 ml of 10%
EDTA solution and then adjust the pH to 5 with NH 4C)H
using indicator paper.

Step 7. Add 2 ml of acetylacetone and stir the solution vigorously

for a minute with a mechanical stirrer. Add 7 ml of benzene

and extract berylliumm by stirring vigorously for a minute
with the mechanical stirrer. Allow the two phases to sep-
arate and transfer the benzene phase to a clean centrifuge
tube by means of a transfer pipette. Check the pH

of the aqueous phase and readjust to pH 5 if necessary.
Repeat step 7 twice more, combining the benzene éxtracts
with that from step 7. '

Back extract beryllium by adding 10 ml of 6 N HCI1 to the
benzene solution and stirring vigorously for 4 min.

Allow the phases to separate and transfer the HCl solutidn
to a 150 ml beaker using a transfer pipette.

Repeat step 9 once, combining the HCI extract with the first
in the 150 ml beaker. Discard the benzene layer, |
Evaporate the HCI solution just to drynese (do not bake).
Add 5 ml of conc. H1§03 and evaporate just to dryness.

(Note 2). '
Dissolve the residue from step 14 in 2 mi of conc. I-I.N'O3 and
10 ml of water. Add a slight excess of NH 4OH to precipitate
Be(OH)Z. . Filter with suction on Whatman No. 42 paper.
Transfer the paper and precipitate to a crucible and dry under

' a heat lamp or in a 100° oven. Ignite the precipitate to BeO

at 1000°C for 1 hr or until precipitate is snow white.

With the crucible inside a hood to avoid inhaling BeO dusit,
grind the BeO to a powder with a stirring rod. Transfer

the BeO to a tared filter paper by slurrying with alcohol.
Wash with ethanol and dry at 90-400° for 10 min. Weigh

the sample as quickly as possible as BeO 18 somewhat hj'gro-
scopic. Mount BeO for counting. '

NOTES

1. The ion exchange column is made by sealing a tip 5 mm long by 2 mm

diameter to the bottom of a 15 x 85 mm pyrex test tube, plugging the

tip with glass wool, and filling the tube with resin to a height
of about i inch.
PROCEDURE 9 (CONTINUED)

2, If a higher degree of decontamination is needed, dissolve the

residue in 10 ml conc. HCI1 and repeat the procedure from step 2.

PROCEDURE 10

Separation of berylllum from cyclotron targets
Source - J. B. Ball, G. H. Bouchard, Jr., A. W. Fairhall, and
G. Mitra (unpublished).

The following procedure is used where the target meterial is
sandwiched between silver foils and bombarded with up to 44 Mev helium
ions. Be7-which escapes from the target is caught in the silver foil.

No Be7 is produced under these conditions in the silver foil iteelf. Because
of activation of impurities in the silver foil several hold-back carriers

are usgsed to improve the decontamination of the beryllium. The procedure
is sufficiently general that a large number of target elements could be
handled without much modification. The over-all chemical yield is

in excess of 80%. |

Procedure:

Step 1. Diagolve the target and silver catcher foils in conc. HNO3.
Evaporate most of the excess acid end add Be carrier
(10 mg). Add hold-back carriers of Cu, Zn, Cd, In, Au,
Hg and T1, where poseible as nitrates (Note 1).

Step 2. Dﬂute the mixture to about 20 rﬁl with water and pass in

' HZS until the precipitated sulfides are well coagulated.
Centrifuge the mixture and decant the supernatant solution
1o a clean centrifuge tube. Discard the precipitate.

Step 3. Add conc. NH OH to the solution until the solution is
faintly ammoniacal. Centrifuge the mixed precipitate of
Be(O]E[)a and sulfides and discard the aqueous phase.

Step 4. Add 6 N NaOH in sufficlent amount (about 1 ml) to dissolve
the Be(OH) 2 from the precipitate. Dilute the mixture to
about 20 ml with water. Centrifuge and discard any
precipitate which may be present.

Add a drop or two of methyl red indicator and barely acidify
the solution. Then add sufficient NH 4OH to turn the indicator
yellow. Centrifuge the precipitate of Be(OH)Z.

Dissolve the Be(OH)2 precipitate in a small amount of

conc. HCl. Dilute the solution to 20 ml with water and

add 2 ml of a saturated solution of the disodium salt of
EDTA. Precipitate beryllium with NH 4OH. Centrifuge and
discard the supernatant solution. Repeat the precipitation
of Be(OH)z in the presence of EDTA twice more.

Dissolve the Be{OH) 2 precipitate in a minimum of conec.
HCl. Dilute to 20 ml with water, transfer the solution

to a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube and add 30 drops conc.
HF. Heat the solution in a boiling water bath and

slowly precipitate BaBeF, by dropwise addition of 5 ml

of a saturated solution of Ba(NO Continue heating

),
for 10 minutes and then centrifu;ezthe precipitate,
Before discarding the supernatant solution check for
completeness of precipitation by adding 1 drop more each
of Ba solution and conc. HF.
Take the precipitate up in a small amount of digtilled
water and filter the suspension through a weighed RA -type
millipore filter (Note 2). Wash with distilled water

and dry in an oven. Weigh as BaBeF4. Mount for counting.

NOTES

1. Gold carrier necessarily contains chloride ion which precipitates

AgCl.

A small amount of AgCl precipitate in the mixture makes

no difference to the recovery of beryllium.

2. The precipitate is very fine-grained and next to imposasible to

filter through ordinary filter paper.

Radiochemical gseparation of beryllium

Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Report Lia-41724, 2nd ed. {1958)

4. Imtroduction

The determination of radicberyllium (BeT) is based upon the formation,
after the appropriate decontamination steps, of basic beryllium scetate,
Be 40 {OCOCH 3} 63 which is extractable by chloroform. The first
decontamination step carried out on a solution of the sample is a ferric
hydroxide precipitation by meang of an excess of sodium hydroxide
solution. Beryllium, as a result of its amphoteric nature, remains in
golution ag a beryllate, NaHBeOZ or NaZBeOZ‘ The beryllate is then
converted fo beryllium ion and beryllium hydroxide precipitated with
ammonia water. The hydroxide is purified by a series of acid gulfide
precipitations in the presence of molybdenum, antimony, and tellurium
carriers, respectively. Beryliium hydroxide is then changed to the
basic acetate by acetic acid treatment. The basic acetate is extracied
into chlorcoform, the chloroform is evaporated, and the basic acetate is
dissolved in nitric acid solution. BRBeryllium is finally converted to the
oxide, Be(Q, in which form it is weighed and counted. The procedure as
outlined below requires approximately 18 hours and gives chemical
yvields in the neighborhood of 35%. Although decontamination factors
have not been determined, it appears that decontamination from gamms-

emitting impurities is of a very high order.

Heat the filtrate to expel HZS and then make ammoniacal with
conc., NH 4OH. Centrifuge and discard the supernate. Acidify
the Be(OH)Z precipitate with 5 m} of glacial HC2H302 and
evaporate the solution nearly to dryness, with constant
gtirring over a low flame. Add 5 ml of glacial HCZH302

and evaporate to dryness over a flame, being careful not to
let the temperature exceed 330°, the boiling point of basié
beryllium acetate. Let the tube cool to room ternperature and
extract the basic beryllium acetate with CHC13, using one

10- and three 5-ml portions of CHCl3 and centrifuging each
time before decanting the supernate into a 125-ml separatory

containing the material which was not extracted by CHCls.
Filter the CHGI3 golution through dry No. 42 Whatman filter
paper into a clean, dry 50-ml beaker, using a 2", 60° filter
funnel. Evaporate the CHCl3 on a steam bath. While the
CHCl3 is being evaporated, proceed with Step 11.

Acidify the wash liquor and the CH_ClS-insoluble material
from Step 10 with cone. HC1. Precipitate Be(OH)2 by

the addition of conc. NH 4OI-I. Centrifuge. If an appreciable
quantity of Be(OH)z is formed, convert it to the basic acetate
as in Step 10 and repeat the CHC13 extraction, adding the
bagic acetate extracted to that obtained in Step 10.

Dissolve the basic acetate from the evaporated CHC1 3 extract
by heating with a minimum of conc. HNO,. JIf 1t is felt that
sufficient decontamination has been obtained, proceed
immediately to Step 14. However, it is necessary ordinarily
to proceed as in Step 13. ,

Transfer the solution to a clean centrifuge tube. Dilute
the I-I'NO-3 solution to 15 ml with HZO and precipitate Bv.e(OH)2
by the addition of conc. NH 4OH. Centrifuge and discard the
supernate. Repeat Steps 7-12,

. Evaporate the I:INO3 golution to 1 to 2 ml and transfer to a

10-ml beaker. Carefully continue heating (on a hot plate)

to dryness. Ignite for 1 hour at .250° in a muffle furnace.
Cool, slurry the BeO with 3 to 5 ml of absolute ethanol, and
pour onto a tared No. 42 Whatman filter circle in a filter
chimney -ground-off Hirach funnel set up which contains

10 ml of absolute ethanol. Permit the solid to settle evenly
on the filter circle (this requires about 10 min) before
applying suction. Dry the precipitate by pulling air through
the funnel for 2 to 5 min; then dry at 105° for 15 min. Cool
and weigh. Mount and gamma ~count in gcintillation counter
{Note 4). Be7 has only a 476-kev gamma ray.

51
PROCEDURE 11 (CONTINUED)

NOTES
An additional recovery of Be from the Fe(OH)'3 precipitated in Step 4
increases the chemical yield by about only 1 to 2%.
The supernates from the Be(OH)2 precipitations in Steps 3 and 4
are saved as a precautionary measure. If much Be(OH)Z appears
to have been lost at this stage, these supernates can be evaporated to
a small volume and made ammoniacal for further recovery of Be. A
small quantity of Be(OH) 2 is always formed by this treatment.
Steps 8 and 9 probably could be combined with Step 7, i.e., all
three carriers, Mo, Sb, and Te, could be added at the same time and
precipitated as sulfides.
Counting is begun immediately and is continued at intervals for a
period of at-lea'.st 53 days (one half-life of Be7). It is well to check
immediately for the presence of beta activity to determine whether
any impurity which is both a beta and a gamma emitter is contaminating

the Be7 and must be corrected far.

Addendum to Beryllium Procedure

 

If an appreciable amount of iron remains with the beryllium, i.e.,
enough to impart a yellow color to the Be(OH) 2 precipitate, just p.rior
to the basic acetate step, it is advisable to make an ether extraction
from 6 M HCI before proceeding. |
The solids from the acetic acid evaporation are heated to a temperature
of approximately 220° C to complete the formation of basic beryllium
acetate. About 30% of the Be is converted to the basic acetate at

118 to 120°; however, 95 to 97% is converted at 220° C. Care must
be exerdised to prevent the temperature from exceeding 330° and
thus decomposing the basic acetate alfeady formed. The final heating
is best accomplished in a constant temperature oil bath or under a
heat lamp." '

The final, BeO, aftér ignition at 500° is transferred directly to an
‘aluminum éou.ﬁting plate rather than beiﬁg slurried with alcohol and

filtered. More reproducible results are obtained in this manner.

PROCEDURE 12 (CONTINUED)
NOTES

Té+4 is slowly reduced to Te metal by the sulfite, and it is carried
along at the interface of the benzene-aqueous mixture. A 5-minute
wash with 8 N HNO, will oxidize finely divided Te metal to Tet?,
placing it in the acid layer. The paddle stirrer is necessary to
churn the two phases together very fapidly.

10 or 42 N HC1 will bring Np'* from 0.4 M TTA into the aqueous
phase. 12 N HCl with some sulfate will cause Zr, and some of Pa,
to be exiracted into the aqueous phase..

If very large amounts of protactinium are present initially, extra

 

gteps must be added to remove this activity. -
