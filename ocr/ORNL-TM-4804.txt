OF TRITIUM IN A MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR PLANT
R. B. Briggs and C. W. Nestor, Jr.
ABSTRACT

Tritium is produced in molten salt reactors primarily by fissioning
of uranium and absorption of neutrons by the constituents of the fuel
carrier salt. At the operating temperature of a large power reactor,
tritium is expected to diffuse from the primary system through pipe and
vessel walls to the surroundings and through heat exchanger tubes into
the secondary system which contains a coolant salt. Some tritium will
pass from thé secondary system into the steam power system. This report
describes a method for calculating the steady state distribution of
tritium in a molten salt reactor plant and a computer program for making
the calculations. The method takes into account the effects of various
processes for removing tritium, the addition of hydrogen or hydrogenous
compounds to the primary and secondary systems, and the chemistry of
uranium in the fuel salt. Sample calculations indicate that 30 percent
or more of the tritium might reach the steam system in a large power

reactor unless special measures are taken to confine the tritium.
I. INTRODUCTION

Conceptual designs of Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) power
plants usually can be represented by the diagram shown in Fig. 1. The
fissioning of uranium in the fuel salt heats the salt as it is pumped
through the reactor vessel in the primary system. The heat is trans-
ferred to a coolant salt that circulates in the secondary system and,
thence, to water, producing steam to drive a turbine-generator in the
steam system.

Fission products and other radiocactive materials are produced in
large amounts in the fuel salt. Much smaller amounts are produced in
the coolant salt by the flux of delayed neutrons in the primary heat
exchangers. The radioactivity is normally confined by the 'walls of
the piping and vessels. However, tritium is produced in the salts,
partly as a fission product, but mostly by absorption of neutrons by
lithium in the fuel salt. At the high temperature of an MSBR, tritium
diffuses through metals and might escape to the environs in amounts
thgt would be cause for concern.

The purpose of this report is to describe a method for calculating
the distribution of tritium in and its escape from an MSBR plant. We
assume that the tritium, born as tritium ions, is present in the fuel
salt primarily as tritium molecules® and tritium fluoride molecules. ¥

The ions are estimated to be produced at a rate of 2.6 X lOlh/MWsec***

 

*Tritium molecules are intended to include HT and H, molecules
when hydrogen is present.

*%Tritium fluoride molecules are intended to include tritium (and
hydrogen) ions associated with fluoride ions in the salt.

in a typical fuel salt. The relative concentrations of tritium and
tritium fluoride in the fuel salt are expected to be governed by the
equilibrium relationship for the reaction,

UF, + 1/2 T, 2 UF3 + TF ,
with uranium in the salt. The absolute concentrations are governed
by removal processes.

Three types of processes are provided for removing tritium from
the primary system: permeation through the metal of the walls of
piping and vessels, sorption on materials in contact with the salt,
and purging. We assume that tritium molecules that reach a metal
surface can sorb on the surface, dissociate into tritium atoms and
diffuse through the metal. Tritium in tritium fluoride and other
compounds is assumed to be chemically bound and unable to pass through
the metal.

Experience with the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment indicated that
tritium sorbs on and is tightly bound to graphite. We provide for
sorption of tritium and tritium fluoride on the graphite in the reactor
core.

Provision is made for purging tritium from the primary system by
circulating a stream of salt through an apparatus which extracts gaseous
tritium and tritium compounds. A contactor in which tritium and tritium
fluoride are transferred to a gas phase by virtue of their wvapor
pressures would be such an apparatus. Current designs for MSBR's
provide for sparging c¢f the fuel salt with helium bubbles in the
primary system to remove krypton and Xenon. Tritium and tritium
fluoride would be removed also. The sparging process can be treated

as an equivalent purging process in the calculatioms.
Tritium will reach the secondary system by diffusion from the primary
system through the walls of the tubes in the primary heat exchangers
and by neutron capture in the coolant salt. We provide for removal of
tritium from the secondary system by diffusion through the metal walls,
sorption, and purging. The secondary system would not normally contain
a sorber or have an elaborate purging system. Such processes, if
incorporated into the plant, would be designed specifically for removing
tritium.

The coolant salts do not normally contain constituents that are
reducible by tritium and, thereby, able to convert tritium into tritium
fluoride and make it unavailable to diffuse through the metal walls.
We, therefore, have provided for addition of hydrogen fluoride or other
hydrogenous compounds to the secondary system. We assume that tritium
will exchange with the hydrogen in the added compound and that the
compound will be extracted by the sorption and/or purge process.

The steam system and the cells around the reactor primary and
secondary systems are considered to be sinks for tritium. Tritium
reaching the steam system is assumed to exchange with hydrogen in the
water, and thdat reaching the cells is assumed to be oxidized to water.
The partial pressure of tritium is effectively zero.

In the calculations we assume that tritium and hydrogen behave
identically. The equation used for calculating the diffusion of
hydrogen through a metal wall states that the rate of transport per
unit of surface area is proportional to the product of a permeability
coefficient and the difference between the square roots of the partial

pressures of hydrogen at the inner and outer surfaces of the metal.
In this circumstance, addition of hydrogen can reduce the transport

of tritium through the metal. Suppose, for example, the partial
pressures of tritium and hydrogen at the outer surface of a pipe are
zero and the partial pressure of tritium at the inner surface is held
constant. If hydrogen were added to increase the total hydrogen partial
pressure at the inner surface by a factor of 100, the flow of hydrogen
plus tritium through the metal wall would increase by a factor of 10.
But the flow of tritium would decrease by a factor of 10 because of the
100-fold dilution of hydrogen. Because of other factors, the effect of
adding hydrogen may not be so dramatic, but the calculational method
provides for addition of hydrogen to the primary and secondary systems
and for hydrogen to be present at a specified concentration in the
steam system so that the effects can be studied.*

The calculational model describes the behavior of tritium in an
MSBR plant to the extent that it is known or has been inferred at the
present time. The removal processes can be included in or eliminated
from the calculations by careful choice of the values assigned to co-
efficients in the equations. The model probably does not include all

the chemical reactions and physical processes that will ultimately be

 

*The calculational procedure might have been developed to treat hydrogen
and tritium as separate species. Separate values then could be assigned
to important parameters, such as solubility and diffusion coefficients,
for each species. Interaction between hydrogen and tritium would be
taken into account by the equilibrium relationship

péT/pHQ *Pp, = kp for the reaction H, + T, ¥ HT .

However, kp has a value near 4 at temperatures of interest, which signi-
fies that hydrogen and tritium interact as though they are the same
species. Also, there are substantial uncertainties in the values for
most of the parameters. Complicating the procedure to treat hydrogen
and tritium separately would not, for the present, improve the accuracy
of the results.
shown to affect the distribution of tritium in an MSBR. In some
instances these effects can be included, when recognized, simply by
adjusting the coefficients in equations for processes presently in-
cluded. Others may require incorporation of additional processes.

Two assumptions in the calculational procedure should be recognized
for their potential for leading to major differences between the cal-
culated distribution of tritium and what would actually occur in a
reactor plant. Tritium, present in the salt as tritium fluoride, can
react with metal to yield tritium atoms that would dissolve in and
diffuse through the metal. Neglect of this reaction could cause the
calculations to be greatly in error under circumstances where most of
the tritium is present in the salt as tritium fluoride.

Oxide films (and possibly others) that form on metal surfaces
reduce the permeability of a metal wall to the passage of hydrogen.
They may also cause the transport to vary with pressure to a power
in the range of 1/2 to 1. The reduced permeability appears as a
coefficient in the transport equations of the model, but we make
no provision for changing the exponent on the pressure terms from
1/2. The calculated transport of tritium through the metal walls
and the effect of the addition of hydrogen in reducing the transport
would both be greater than would actually occur if the actual trans-
port were proportional to the pressure to a power in the range 1/2
to 1. The calculations would not underestimate the transport unless
the total pressure of tritium and hydrogen exceeded the reference

pressure for the permeability coefficient, which is usually 1 atm.
II. DERIVATION OF EQUATIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURES

In making the calculations, we first calculate the distribution of
hydrogen plus tritium in order to establish flows and concentrations of
the combined isotopes throughout the plant. Then we calculate the distri-
bution of tritium throughout the plant.

For calculating the distribution, the fluids in the primary and
secondary systems and the various parts of the steam system are assumed
to be well mixed and to contain uniform bulk concentrations of all
constituents, The calculations are for steady-state conditions, and
only hydrogen and tritium molecules are assumed to be able to sorb on
the metal surfaces, dissociate, and diffuse through the metal walls.
The various paths are defined and the distribution is calculated by the

use of the following set of equations.*

A. In the primary system:

1. Transport of hydrogen through the salt film to the wall
of the piping in the hot leg from the reactor vessel to

the heat exchanger:
Q1 = h1A1(CF — C1) (1a)

the hydrogen pressure is assumed to be negligible:

Because the molecular species involved may contain different numbers
of hydrogen atoms, all the calculations are done in terms of atoms of
hydrogen. This does not mean that the hydrogen necessarily diffuses as
single atoms, but only that a transport unit is one hydrogen atom and
the parameters are expressed in terms of single hydrogen atoms. A
Q value of 1 then represents the transport of one-half molecule of H,,
one molecule of HF, or one-fourth molecule of a compound 1like CH,, all per
unit time. Likewise, a C value of 1 represents a concentration of one-
half molecule of H,, one molecule of HF, or one-~fourth molecule of CH,,
all per unit volume.

If the rates of inflow of tritium and hydrogen atoms (R; and R,,
respectively) to the primary system are given, a material balance over
the primary system gives

In our calculations, all flow rates in the sum on the right-hand side

of Eq. 9 are positive or zero except for Q,, the transport through the
12

heat exchanger tubes to the secondary system. Q, can be positive,

negative or zero, depending on the conditions in the various systems.

Hydrogen is present in and is removed from the primary system as hydrogen

fluoride, but we provide no input of HF. It is produced by the reaction
UF, + +H, < UF, + HF ,

which has an equilibrium quotient

the ratio X(UF5)/X(UF,) = 1/U at a constant value,* so the concentration
of HF in the bulk of the salt can be related to the hydrogen concentration

Since we assume that the hydrogen fluoride does not release hydrogen
to diffuse through the metal walls, and that there are no chemical reac-
tions in the secondary system that make the concentrations of hydrogen and
hydrogen fluoride interdependent, we write separate material balances for

the two species for the distribution of total tritium and hydrogen:

The steam flows will be so large that the diffusion of hydrogen through
the metals should not have much effect on the concentration of hydrogen
in the steam. Under these assumptions, we do not require a material
balance over the steam system. If hydrogen is added to the feed water
as hydrazine or in some other manner to give a specified ratio of
hydrogen to H,0, then this ratio, coupled with the steam tables, can be
used to calculate the hydrogen concentrations in the water and steam in
the steam-raising equipment. Without addition of hydrogen the
concentrations are established by the dissociation of water.

We now need to solve the above equations to obtain values for all
the flow rates and concentrations. We carry this out in the following
sequence, discussed in more detail in Sec. IIIL.

1. Calculate C Cis, Q18 and Q;9 from equations 19a, 19b, 20

and 21b.

CF’

2. Assume a value for CC.

3. Calculate Qip5, Q115 Qi15, Q17 and C;¢ from equations 1lla, 11b,
12a, 12b, 17a, 17b and 18.

4. Calculate Qi13, Qis, Qis, Ci13, Ciy and Ci1s from equations léa,
14b, 15a, 15b, 16a, 1l6b, 22a, 22b, 23a, 23b, 24a and 24b,
noting that the steam system and the secondary system are

coupled by the relationships Qi3 = -Q21, Q14 = -Qz22 and
Qis = —Q23.
16

5. Calculate Q;, from the material balance, Eq. 2la.

6. Calculate CF’ Ci12 and Cy from Eqs. 4a, 4b, 13a, 13b, the
relationship Q4 = -Q;» and the value of Qi» obtained in step 5.
These concentrations should all be positive. If any one of them
is negative, steps 3 through 6 must be repeated with a larger

value of CC.

7. When positive values have been found for CF’ Ci2 and Cy4,

calculate Qi, Q2, Q3,5 Qs Q65 Q7,5 Qss Cs, Cpp and Cy.

8. Calculate RF from

8

Rp = iil Qi - (R; + Rp) &
If RF is positive, hydrogen must be added to the primary system
in order to maintain a balance. This means that CF is too large,
which in turn means that CC is too large, and steps 3 through 8§
must be repeated with a smaller value of CC. If RF is negative,
CC is too small and steps 3 through 8 must be repeated with a
larger value of CC.

When this process has been repeated until the ratio is

 

R, + R,

 

sufficiently small, the flows and concentrations of hydrogen plus tritium
and of hydrogen fluoride plus tritium fluoride have been established
throughout the plant and we can proceed with the calculation of the
tritium distribution. We ignore the difference in the properties of

the two isotopes and assume that they behave identically. Thus,

hydrogen and tritium compounds have the same solubilities and
diffusivities, and if a hydrogenous compound, such as HF, is added

to a mixture of hydrogen and tritium, exchange will occur to give a

ratio of tritium to hydrogen that is the same in hydrogen* and the

added compound.

Equations 25 through 27 are straightforward, simply indicating that
the amount of tritium flowing with hydrogen is proportional to the fraction
of the concentration that is tritium when the flow of both is into a sink
with a zero concentration of both. Equation 28a is straightforward,
indicating that the flow of tritium from the bulk salt to the wall is
proportional to the difference between the concentrations of tritium in
the bulk fluid and the wall. Equation 28b, however, requires some

additional explanation.

The rate of transport of hydrogen through a metal wall can be

expressed as

_DA v _

where D is the diffusivity of hydrogen atoms in the metal, the C's are
the concentrations of hydrogen atoms dissolved in the metal at the inner
(I) and outer (0) surfaces, t is the metal thickness and A is the surface
area. Assuming no interaction of tritium and hydrogen atoms as they
diffuse through the metal, the rate of transport of tritium is

where S is a solubility coefficient and P is the partial pressure of
hydrogen + tritium and is equal to the product of Henry's law coefficient
and the concentration of hydrogen + tritium in the salt at the surface.
Assuming that the ratio of tritium to hydrogen + tritium in the metal

at the surface is the same as that in the salt at the surface, we can

write

and by substituting the permeability coefficient, p, for the product,
DS, we obtain Eq. 28b. This treatment is necessary here because

the net flows of hydrogen and tritium may be in opposite directionms.
The equations provide a means for taking into account the effect of the
mass action laws on the concentrations of tritium in the metal and its
transport through the metal.

The balance over the secondary system is:

Since the tritium concentration in the steam system is assumed to
be negligible, no equations are needed for the steam system.

To calculate the distribution of tritium, we solve Eqs. 2544 in
the following sequence, discussed in more detail in Section III.

1. Assume a tritium concentration, C T° in the secondary system

C
and calculate Qso0, Q415 Qus through Q,s from Eqs. 34, 35, 37a,

37b, 38a, 38b, 39a, 39b, 40, 41, 42 and 43.
2. Calculate Q42 from the material balance, Eq. 44.

3. Calculate CFT from Eqs. 28a, 28b, 36a and 36b, the relation-
ship Qs34 = -Q42 and the value of Q4. from step 2., If the value

of CFT is negative, increase the estimate for C,, and repeat

CT

steps 1 through 3. When we have found a positive C Ts We

F
proceed to step 4.

Calculate Q3;, Q32, Qs33, Q3ss, Qse, Qs> and Qse from Egs. 25-32.

Calculate RF’ where

is the term that must be added to the left side of Eq. 33 in

order for the equation to balance. If R, is positive, tritium

F
must be added to the primary system, so CFT and CCT are too
large; if RF is negative, CFT and CCT are too small. Adjust
the value of CCT and repeat steps 1 through 5. When IRF/R1|

is sufficiently small, the calculations are finished.
23
ITTI. SOLUTION OF EQUATIONS

In the procedure discussed above, we begin with the calculation of

CCF’ Cisy Qie and Q,s with Eqs. 19a, 19b and 20, and the material balance,

Eq. 21b:
Qis = hlBAla(CCF — Cia) (19a)
3
= Bu,WsA;15(k18C1s)” (19b)
Qio = FhEhch s (20)
Rs = Qis + Q15 - (21b)

Eq. 19b requires that Q,s > 0 and Eq. 20 requires that Qi > 0, so if
Rs = 0, 21b requires that Qs = Q;9 = 0. If Rs > 0, we combine 21b, 20

and 19a to obtain

Rs - Q8 = FLE,C_ = Rs — h1aA15(CCF = Ci1s8) »

CF

or

c . = RsthiahA1eCis
CF Fqu‘i‘hlaAla (]_QC)

Substituting 19c into 19a, setting the result equal to 19b and collecting
terms we obtain

1
o — Cis = BCig » (194d)

where we have defined

Rs
F,E, °’

_ F‘.E¢.+hleAla} [Bhw‘.} 4
P = [ FLE, His [kls] ’

 

u:

and

 
24

Squaring both sides of 19d results in a quadratic equation for C;s}
since the right-hand side of 19d is positive, we want the root of this

quadratic which is less than a. We have

Cfa —'(2a+32)cle +0* =0 >

_2a+B2 + V(2a+B>) 2 ~4a

C
18 5

To obtain the root less than o, we want the root with the negative sign.
To avoid possible loss of significant figures, we note that the product

of the roots is &2, so that we can write the solution in the form

2

 

o
ClB = 2 . (lge)
a+-B— 1+ \/l+—ng-
2 B
Then we have
1
Qis = BhwhAls(klecls)T-, (19b)
_— R5 + hlBAIBC].B
CCF = TF.E. + DioAss (19¢)
and
Qo = F&Euch . (20)

With some value for CC we proceed to the calculation of Qio, Qi:,

Q165 Q17 and Cis. Egs. 1la, 11b, 12a and 12b read

Qio = h1oA10(CC — C10) » (11a)
A 1

Qio = Ei%:LQ (kIOCIO)E., (11b)

Qi1 = hllAll(CC — C11) > (12a)
25

A 1
Qi = P—;—l—l (k1:1C11)2 (12b)

These equations (11 and 12) are identical in structure, as aive Egs. 1,

2, 3, 5, 7, 17 and 19. For Egs. 11 and 12 we define

 

C1=C Ol=ki

c’ t.h

ii

and Eqs. 11 and 12 then can be written in the form of quadratics in the

concentration Ci:

2 2 _
Ci (2C1+a)Ci + C]_ 0o .

From Egs. 1lb and 12b, the flow rates Q;o and Q,; must be positive, so

that the root desired in each case is the smaller one. We have

 

 

C Cy i 10, 11
. = s 1 % ’ ’
* c1+9‘-(1+ 1+Cl)

2 o
and

P.A, 1

_ i = . _

By putting
Cl = CC ’

BsWs
=(§12)k16 ’
Cis can be calculated in the same fashion (Eqs. 17a and 17b) and the

flow rates Q.6 and Q,, are

1
Qi = BawsAls(k1sc1s)7-s

Qi7 = FsEscC .
26

We continue with step 4, the calculation of the flow rates Q,s,
Q14 and Q;s, and the corresponding concentrations C;s, C;, and C,s,
using Eqs. l4a, 14b, 15a, 15b, 16a, 16b, 22a, 22b, 23a, 23b, 24a and
24b. Note that the secondary system and the steam system are coupled

by the equations

Qis = =Q21, Qia = Q22 and Q15 = -Q23 .

The three equations 14, 15 and 16 all have the same structure and can

be written in the form

 

P 1 1
— = K T _ T
=G oo - aep?] (2)
h, (C; —Cz) = h (C:—Cp) , (b)
where K = 13, 14 and 15, C, = CC’ L =21, 22 and 23, and we identify
C. as CSG’ CSS and CSR for K = 13, 14 and 15, respectively. We can
solve Eq. b for CL:
ht(cl-C) +hC2 h
c =X K L - K,-c)+c, . (c)
L hL hL K

Since C, must be non-negative, there is a maximum permissible value

L
Cémax)’ which is the value such that
h
K (c1 c(max)) +Co =0,
h K
L
or
h

If we substitute (c) into (a) and rearrange, we have
27

k + | * %‘l
Ce = Co v gk & (G0 * G _[kKCK] ’ (e)
KK L
or, more concisely,
CK = F(CK) .

To locate the solutions (if any) of this equation, we need to

(max)

examine the behavior of F(CK) for 0 < C 5_CK . We find that

K

F(0) >0
and

F'(CK) < 0, F'(O) = =®
F"(CK) _>_ 0.

The graph of F(CK) then looks like the curve in Fig. 2.

“k

0 CK
Fig. 2. Sketch of F(CK) vs CK.

(max)

For there to be a solution between zero and CK

, we must have

(max)

“k

> F(Cémax)) and upon substitution of our expression (d) into
F(CK), we find that this condition is satisfied. We will now examine

the function

G(CK) = C_ — F(CK) .

K
28

We note that

G(0) = =F(0) <0

(max)

G(CK

) >0

and

G'(CK) =1 —-F'(CK) > 0 [since F'(CK) < 0] .

This insures that G(CK) has one and only one zero in the range

(max)

< : " = " " <
0<CcC E-CK . Since G (CK) F (CK), G (CK) < 0, and the graph

K
of G(CK) looks like the curve shown in Fig. 3.

With a suitable Cél) we can compute G, = G(Cél)) < 0 (for example,
starting with Céi) = () and with a suitable Céz), G, = G(Céz)) >0
(Céz) = Cémax), to start). An approximation to the solution CéT), is

derived from the inverse linear interpolation:

(1) _ (2)

as shown in Fig. 2. A better approximation can be derived with inverse

quadratic interpolation:

29

With G"(CK)_i 0 as shown and G'(CK) >0, GT = G(CéT)) will be positive
T

and CéT) should be larger than the root. If Céx) is larger than Cé ),

we replace Céz) by CéT), G2 by GT’ and repeat the inverse linear inter-

i (x) , (T)

polation. If, however, CK is smaller than CK , we calculate

GX = G(Cé%)); and if this value is negative, we replace Cél) by Cé#),

G, by Gx’ Céz) by CéT) and G, by GT’ and repeat the inverse linear

interpolation., If GX is positive, we replace Céz) by Céx) and G, by GX

and repeat the inverse linear interpolation. We terminate this process

when

or when we have done 50 iterations. The tolerance CTOL is defined in a
DATA statement in our program. We have found that the procedure converges
in about four iterations for CTOL = 10™° and in about six iterations for

_ -7
CTOL 1077,

The required flow rates Q;s;, Q215 Qias Qz22, Q15 and Q23 can now be

computed from
Q; = hiAi(CC-— ci)

Qg = ~Q» 1 =13, 14, 15 .

The flow rate of hydrogen and tritium through heat exchanger tube

walls from the secondary to the primary system, Q,,, is
Qiz = Rs + Ry — (Qio + Q1 + Qis + Qus + Qs + Q16 + Qy7) ’

and from Eq. 13a,

C12=C_££_.
C hi.A,
30

If the value for C,. is negative, we have used too small a value for
CC’ so we double our previous guess and start over at step 3. ' If the
computed value is positive, we proceed to calculate (Eq. 13b)

1 3 t,]?
Cy = E:’[(klzc1z)]-—'%ii;f]

and finally,

- _9;2
CF Cu hyAg

If the computed value for C_ is negative, we need a larger value for

F
CC’ so we double our previous guess and return to step 3. If positive,
we proceed to step 7, the computation of the remaining flow rates Q,,
Q2, Q3, Qs, Qg, Q7 and Qs and the concentrations Cs, Cop and Cy.

We can write Egqs. 1, 2 and 3 in the form

P.A, 1

Qi = hiAi (CF Ci) . (kici) , 1 1, 2, 3,

and with

 

the resulting quadratic equations can be solved in the same way as

those for C;, and Cy;. Egs. 5 can be manipulated into the same form

with

_{Bw; }?
o = hs k5

so that we can calculate Cs, and from it

1
Qs = B1WiAs (ksCs)Z . (5b)
31

Again, Eqs. 7a and 7b can be written as a quadratic for C; with

This is the end of the first part of the procedure if RF is small

enough. We test the condition

Rp

Ri+R,

 

 

 

TTOL

(where the quantity TTOL is defined in a DATA statement in our

program) and if it is satisfied, we proceed to the second part. If

not, we adjust C, in a variety of ways, depending on what information

C

we have accumulated so far. We carry out a preliminary search for

two values of CC which bracket the root, i.e., one for which RF is

negative and the other for which RF is positive. If this is the

first iteration or if both our present and previous values of RF

have the same sign, we multiply CC by a factor m such that

-R_/(R1+R3)
m = 10 RF
32

but limited to the range
.01 <m <100

When we have bracketed the root, we combine inverse linear and
inverse quadratic interpolation in much the same way as we did for
the solution of the equations for C;3, Ci;n and Ci15, keeping the root
bracketed and attempting to reduce the length of the interval con-
taining the root. When this process has converged, we proceed to
the tritium calculation.

With a value for CCT’ the concentration of tritium in the

secondary salt, we compute

If this value is negative, we have used too small a value for

V. COMPUTER PROGRAM, INPUT INSTRUCTIONS AND SAMPLE PROBLEM

The FORTRAN-IV program listed in the Appendix was written to pro-
vide a flexible and easily used tool for parameter studies. Many of the
system parameters listed in Sec. IV have standard or reference values,
and we have written the program to allow the user to specify a new value
for any parameter, to use the reference value, or to reset a parameter
to its reference value. Instructions to the program are in the form of
simple commands, followed by numerical values as required.

Output from the program consists of the summary of concentrations,
flow rates and fractions shown in Fig. 2, any input commands, and various
messages from the program to display the progress of the iterative parts
of the calculation.

The three options currently available to the user are

(a) OUTPUT

(b) OUTPUT__ALL“CRBE* all commands begin in column 1; (the

underline indicates a blank space)

(c) OUTPUT __ALL PRINTER
With choice (a), the summary output is sent to logical unit 20 and all
oﬁhef output is sent to logical unit 6 (the line printer); with choice
(b), all output is sent to logical unit 20; and with choice (c¢), all
output is sent to logical unit 6, For choices (a) and (b), appropriate

data definition (DD) statements for unit 20 must appear in the user's

job control language.

 

*The program was designed to be used from a remote terminal with the
‘Conversational Remote Batch Entry system; hence the use of "CRBE" as
a keyword. However, the program in no way depends upon the availability
of the CRBE system.
50

To change various system parameters, the command is

CHANGE__XXX

where XXX is replaced by the appropriate variable name as listed in

Sec, IV,

(CF 2 CFF’

parameter value in cols. 1~10.

If the variable name refers to one of the named concentrations
csns CSR)’ the next line of input must contain the new

If the variable name refers to any of

the subscripted variables in Sec. IV, the next line must contain a

and 62 X 106, respectively.

to be changed, the second subscript need not appear.

The user can supply starting estimates for CC

and C

If only one value is

o’ the concen-

trations of hydrogen plus tritium and tritium in the bulk of the

secondary salt, with the "CHANGE'" command.

the program will use 1 X 10

If no values

are supplied

 
51

To perform a calculation when all the necessary changes have been
made, the command is
RUN

A calculation will then be done with the parameters specified.
For subsequent cases, all parameters will have the values present at
the end of the preceding calculation; to change the parameters, the
user can supply additional "CHANGE" commands. To reset parameters to
their reference values, the command is
RESET XXX
If "XXX" is left blank, all parameters will be reset; if "XXX" is the
name of a subscripted variable, all entries with the given name will
be reset; and if "XXX'" is the name of one of the named concentrations

(C., C oo CSR) then just that concentration will be reset. If,

F’> “FF’
for example, after running the case specified by the '"CHANGE" command
in the example, a user put
RESET___A
then all the A's would be reset to their reference values.
The program will stop when an end-of-file condition is detected
on the standard input unit, i.e., when it runs out of data.
The input and output for a sample problem are shown in Figs. 4
and 5. Reference values from Section IV were used in the sample calcula-
tion. The results indicate that 30 percent or more of the tritium might

reach the steam system in a large power reactor unless special measures

are taken to confine the tritium.
