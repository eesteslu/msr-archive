PART I. HOMOGENEQUS AND QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS REACTQRS

'SECTTION VI. ~ SOLID HOMOGENEOUS (SEMIHOMOGENEOUS) REACTORS =

Chapter 1. Introduction

The concepts described in this section are for reactors ln which,thewsolld
fuel . and moderator are in a unlform comblnatlon or mixture, e.g., a uniform,
dlSper51on of fuel in a moderator matrix, Excluded are reactors in wh1ch the
fuel and moderator are discrete, as in some closely related ones in whlch the
fuel and moderator form alternate layers or zones. Both these and the solid
homogeneous reactors have also been named semihomogeneous or reactors of a mixed
fuel- moderator.type The reactors in which the fuel and moderator are discrete
will be described in Part II under thelr respective methods of coollng Some
solld homogeneous reactors have been descrlbed in thlS Catalog in Part I, Sectlon
I, Partlculate Fueled Reactors o ‘

Reactors covered in this sectlon have been de51gned for research and testing
as well as for power productlon and breeding. The research and test reactors
are descrlbed in Chapter 2, the power and breeder reactors in Chapter 3.

Uranlum ox1des are a common form of fuel 1ncorporated with the moderator
into a fuel element; carbides, alloys, and the metal 1tself have also been used.
In some fuel-moderators, the moderator is impregnated, by soaking, with a solu-
tion of a salt such as uranyl'nitrate,: Subsequent heating converts this to an
oxide or carbide. 1In some elements, partlcles of the fuel and moderator are
cold pressed and sintered or hot pressed. 1In some concepts no detalls of the
fabr1cat10n have been considered. ‘Graphite berylllum oxide, berylllum, zir-
conium hydrlde and polyethylene have been moderators with graphite and
berylllum being most common for power reactors and polyethylene used in some

low-power reactors ' Most of the solid homogeneous reactors are gas-cooled.

‘Breedlng 1s chlefly by the Th ---U cy cle.

The advantages of the solid homogeneous reactor were p01nted out in 1960
by Charple and Perry,1 who stated, '"The hlgh ‘temperature homogeneous or semi-
homogeneous reactors are at once the most dlfflcult and, in all probablllty,1
the most rewardlng members of the gas -cooled reactor famaly The advantages
given include: high fuel-moderator volumes and large heat-transfer surface,
which lead to high power densities and specific power; high gas pressure made

possible by the compact cores; high temperatures of the exiting coolant gas,

12

which mlght be hlgh enough to permit direct- cycle operatlon good neutron
economy ; and the pOSSlblllty of low fuel- -cycle costs.

Problems cited by these authors as chief difficulties at.the time are
development of fuel elements with good mechanlcal integrity and the capacity
for retaining fisSion:products and the need for rapld refuellng to take ad-
vantage of the high SpElelc power. _

Solid homogeneous reactors were among the first gas-cooled types to be
considered in the United States. By 1944-45 Farrington Déniels had evolved
designs for pebble-bed reaéfors (see Chapter 1, Section I, Part I) ihhwhich
the fuel-moderator is pebbles of uranium carbideﬂand graphite. 1In 1944 he
proposed the use of beryllium oxide‘in-a‘higﬁ-temperature pile. He and his
co-workers at the Metallurgical Labdrapbry, University of Chicago,‘étudied
this concept. Later, a group at thé Clinton Laboratofies ‘(now. the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory) continued . deve10pment through 1947, when the concept was
abandoned. 2 The fuel-moderator in the 1947 conceépt was a dlsper81on of uranium
oxide in graphlte or beryllium oxide, in the form of ‘tubes. For almost ten
years after 1947, there was comparatively little work~done on this type of-
reactor in the U.S., partly because of intereét in water-cooled aﬁd liquid-~
metal-cooled reactors and also because of.the view that the heat transfer |
properties of gases would limit power den51ty and specific power. Such develop-
ments as successful foreign experlence with gas-cooled reactors and the applica-
tion of new materials led to a renewed interest in the ﬁ,S; in gas-cooled reactors,
including those of the solid homégenéOUS‘type,3 K .

Unlike most concepts previously discussed in Part I, the solid homogeneous
reactors have been developed into several commercial-size units. These reactors
have been considered partlcularly attractive because of the high steam tempera-
tures that are feasible with the homogeneous fuel moderator Bromlnent ¢urrent
developmentsAln the United States include the Peach Bottom (PenngyiVania).High-
temperature Gas-éooled Reactor (HTGR), the Ultra High Temperature Reactor .
Experiment (UHTREX), and the Experimental Beryllium Oxide-Reéctor (EBOR). Foreign
development has been extensive; in line with the earlier interest in gas-cooled
reactors. Programs in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japén have included

solid homogeneous reactors. Several have been built, and others are planned.

Chapter 2. Research and Test Reactors

Reactors described in this chapter are low-poWer ones used to give experi-
mental data, primarily through the radiation they produce and for testing
reactor materials., 1In most, the fuel, an oxide of uran1um is dispersed in the
moderator (polyethylene, zirconium hydride, or graphite). Soﬁe of these reactors
have been widely used. ' ' |

An early‘(1952) model of a solid homogeneous research reactor was the Table
Model Reactor, described by Biehl, Hetrick, and Bennett. L The fuel-moderator
consists of very fine partlcles of uranium dioxide mixed homogeneously with
polyethylene and pressed into a mold. The core radius is 11.8 cm. ‘The authors
listed some advantages of a solid system over a fluid one: e.g., gas evolution
would be avoided if the moderator were sufficiently stable, because the solid
material would tend’to'trap fission fragments while it would not give off appre-
ciable amounts of decomposition gases. Also a smaller critical size, with smaller
core size and shielding, would be poseible° Tests showed that the uranium-
impregnated polyethylene would withstand long operation at high power. Poly~ -
ethylene has a somewhat hlgher hydrogen “atom.’ den31ty than ‘does water (7.8 x
10?2 nuclel/cm; versus 6.7 X 1022 for water), “

The Homogeneous Graphite Reactor, described in 1954 by Stelle,2 was intended
both as a research tool and a source of service irradiations to produce isotopes.’
Ite safety features aré a negative temperaturelcoefficient and control and safety
rods. The fuel, enriched uranium in U308’ is dispersed in graphite. Heavy water
circulates around the fuel-moderator as a coolant. A power of 135 kW(t) and an
average neutron flux oflO12 nentfons/cmz/secvwere planned.

The ANCO-201 reactor (1955) is a compact, low-power reactor designed for
training and research.3 The fuel-moderator is 207% enriched uranium dioxide
particles.dispefséd in discs of polyethylene. The originators, staff members
of the Applied Ndoleonics Corporation, stated that this reactor could be used
with only 450 g uranium-235 and it is safe enough to allow it to be installed
in highly populated areas. The maximum thermal neutron flux is 6 x 106
neutrons/cm /sec. ' |

The AGN-201 and -211 series of reactors of Aerojet-General Nucleonics
cloeely resemble each'other.é’5 "Many have been installed at universities.

.In 1956,'Biehl'et'a1.4 described AGN-201 as a compact; low-cost reactor
designed for maximum safety and high sensitlvityc The fuel, uranium dioxide

dispérsed in polyethlene, is in the form'of discs of different thicknesses.,
In addition to the negative temperature coefficient and rods for safety and
control; the reactor has an added safety feature. The core is divided into
two halves separated by a fuse of.polyethylene that has a high uraniuﬁ-235
content. If a high flux level occurs, the fuse melts, causing the iower half
of the core to fall and separate from the other half. Of neglible power, these
reactors are cooled by natural convection, but they'can be modified to operate
at a maximum power of 20 MW(t). The core and a graphite reflector are in a tank
of water for shielding. - | |

The AGN-211 reactore’7 is similar in'many ways to the AGN-20l1. The fuel is’
a dispersion of uranium dioxide in polyethylene, but the fuel elements are feeF-
long sections, with a graphite reflectof at each end. The elements are clad with
polyethylene to prevent contact of the coolant (water) with the fuel. The reactor
has a power of 100 W(t). This reactor was considered desirabie for training iﬁ
nuclear engineering; for exampie, different arrangements of core 1attices mighﬁ
be tfied. | | :
| The TRIGA reectors (Training, Research, and Isotope Production Reactor,
General Atomic) introduced in 1958, have been widely used in the United States
and abroad for training, irradiatioﬁ, and isotope production. There are four
models; Mark I, Mark II, Mark III, and Mark F.8-14 All have fuel-moderator
elements of uranium mixed with zirconium hydride, and a coolant-shield of a pool
.of water. The fuel elements are cylindrical and are clad. Mark I, II, and III
have a graphite reflector and can operate either in the steady state or as
pulsed reactors: -In_steady-state operatioh, these feactors are low power, but
in puleing they can produce 200 MW(t). 1In the Mark F, specifically designed
for pulsing, the graphite reflector is eliminated; it has more fuel elements,
which QFovide higher heat capacity; and it has a large water tank, for more
versatility of radiation.10 A large prompf negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity is chiefly depended upon for safety, although control rods are pro-
vided. Advantages claimed for the reactors include: economy, versatility, and
safety, with no special containment building needed.

An extrapolation of TRIGA technology for a reactor.for pewering a bathy-
scaphe, research craft, or power buoy was suggested in 1960.15 |

. Two reactors with the same core as the TRIGA Mark I are General Atomic's

| REGA (Research Reactor, General Atomic) 10-30 and IRGA (Isotope Production
Reactor, General Atomic) reactors.8’13

In 1959, Thompson and Fahrnerl6.described a design for a low-power research

reactor in which the fuel-moderator is graphite impregnated with enriched uranium
17

as‘U308vand the coolant is heavy water. The.fue;‘elements are clad with aluminum
and filled w?th helium, with concentric tubes in each element for flow of coolant.
The power is 200 kW(t). The authors indicated problems would be the large amount
. of heavy water needed (about 400 gallons); the limitation on temperature by the
boiling of'the.heavy water; and difficulties in deéign of the cooling system, -
even at moderate pressures. | |

Siemenstchuckértwerke A.G. announced in 1961 plans to build a solid homo-
geleous reactor as a prototype for a model to be offered for sale.17 Few details

- were given. The reactor is fueled and moderated with a suspension of powdered

0,0

30g in polyethylene and has a graphite reflector and shielding of lead and water.

The -homogeneous subcritical subassembly18 designed by staff members at
Aerojet-General Nucleonics is included here because it is intended for use in its
own right to measure neutron fluxes, rather than as a step in designing another
.reactof. It has a cylindrical core of a homogenéouslmixture of 207% enriched
uranium and polyethylene and includes a meutron source. It can be used without

a reflector or with one of either graphite or polyethylene.

Chapter 3. Power and Breeder Reactors

Most of the concepts described in this chapter are for higthémperaturé, f
gas-cooled reactors, some of which have been developed into Iarge-scaie plaﬁfs.
A few are liquid-cooled reactors for special'purposes, such as the SNAP reactors.
Typicaily, the reactor core is composed of fuel-moderator elements around which
the coolant flows. | ‘

. Gréphite or beryllium oxide is the moderator for nearly ali power reactors,
with graphite being used for most. Beryllium metal was suggested early.in the
development of solid homogeneous reactors, but it has been little used. The
advantages of gfaphite and those of berYllium oxide have been.given by several
aﬁthors. Faris1 discuséed'graphite. Jaye et al.,2 and Roberts,3 gave the ad-
Qéntages of beryllium oxide. Desirable characteristics listed for graphite as
a moderator in solid homogeneous reactors are: a negafive temperature coef-
'fiCient, which'givesrsafety in‘low;temperatufe applications; desirable mechanical
prOpertiés at high temperatures; comparatively simple decohtaminatioﬁ; and.
simplicity of fabrication and récovery processes. Many advantages are claimed
for beryllium oxide. Because it is a better moderator than'grqphite, conver-
sion ratios are higher aﬁd cores are smaller ﬁith beryllium oxide than with
graphiteifdr the same fuel load and specific power. Higher‘temperatures for
the gas coolant leaving the reactor are poésible; thus more effiéient steam
cycles can be used and the temperatures might be high enough for efficient gas
turbines. Beryllium oxide is compatible with carbon dioxide at high temperatures,
so that this gas can be used instead of helium. With carbon dioxide there are
fewe; problems with gas-tightness in the system. The fairly high thermal con-
ductivity of beryllium oxide makes it suitable for solid homogeneous fuels. It
resists release of fission products from the fuel-moderator, and it ﬁay have a
Along lifetime without serious loss of essential properties. Jaye et 51.2 have
suggested that a berylliuﬁuoxide spine might be used in a moderator element of
graphite. One obvious major difference between the two moderators is the con-

siderably higher cost of beryllium oxide.
Gas-cooled Reactors

" Studies of the use of beryllium oxide in a high-temperature power reactor
were begun by Farrington Daniels in 1944 at the Metallurgical Laboratory,
University of Chicago. Calculations by Daniels and co-workers established the

feasibility of such a reactor, and problems in.its design were investigated at
34

the Metallurgical Laboratory until 1946, when this work was transferred to a
group at the Clinton Laboratories. An aim of the program was developing a high-
temperature, helium-cooled, powér reactor fueled with enriched uranium and
moderated with beryllium oxide. A boiler for steam generatioﬁ and a generator
to produce electrical power were also included iﬁ the specifications for the
reactor plant. Emphasis was put on a design that could be developed in a fairly
short time. ‘ , _

In November 1946, a preliminary design was proposed,5 -In this 40 MW(t)
reactor, the fuel~m§derator is in the form of enriched uranium oxide mixed with
beryllium oxide to form cylinders, which are within axial holes in hexagonal
prisms of beryllium oxide. These prisms form a cylindrical core. A reflector?
a thorium breeder-blanket, and the core vessel surround the core. The coolant,
helium, floﬁs inté the bottom of the reactor, through the core, and out the top,
whence it passes to a boiler.

At the suggestion of Wigner, a group studied a reactor utilizing beryllium
metal instead of beryllium oxide, This study was published in February 1947.6
The design is very similar to the earlier one with beryllium oxide. Plates of
beryllium-uranium alloy are contained in a skeleton of beryllium metal. Fertile
material, thorium metal, is in channels in the side and end reflectors of beryl-
lium metal. The power is the same as for the oxide reactor, 40 MW(t). The
results showed no outstanding differences between the moderators that would make
the metal preferable. Also, the metal has such disadvantages as poor tensile
and creep properties at high temperatures, and the knowledge of fabrication tech-
niques for it was limited. Thus it was decided that use of the metal would give
no advantage, and the development of a beryllium oxide pile was continued,

Investigations showed that reducing_the volume of the pile would give a
considerably smaller critical mass and would increase the conversion ratio. Also,
tests on beryllium oxide indicated loss of thermal conductivity under irradiation,
causing unqertainfies in performance of the pile. It was thus decided to design
a smaller, lower-power pile to give a better facility for study of such problems.
In June 1947 the USAEC notified the Laboratory that it would not authorize de-
sign or construction of the power pile, but investigations on problems should
continue at a lower priority,4 In September of the same year, the Power Pile
Division (the Clinton Laboratory group assigned to the project), issued a final
report summarizing the status of the developmént:.4 The design advanced in this
report is generally similar to that for the earlier design with beryllium oxide.

The power is lower, 12-20 MW(t), and beryllium metal or graphite are considered

35

as alternatives to beryllium oxide. Concepts for higher power were ¢onsidered,
as was a design for a horizontal reactor, intended to facilitate loading and
unloading of elements. These concepts differed from the 12-20 MW(t) concept
~chiefly in:dimensions; fuel loadings, and engineering.

,A 1950 concept by Daniels, the Impregnated Graphite, Nitrogeén-Cooled Reactor,
was designed to use the étandard“equipment and materials available in 1950.7 The
author said that such a power pile could be'builtrquiekly and at low cost. It
'was intended to be a "one-shot' experimental reactor with expendable parts. The
fuel-moderator is uranium oxide disPersed>in'graphite in the form of blocks that
make up the core,. Nitrogen was recommended as a coolant gas because it could be
used to run standard turbineS‘ but helium could be used. The reactor was de-

signed as a breeder, with fully enriched uranium to be used for breeding U 233

" and sllghtly enriched uranium for breeding plutonium. For breedlng U 33, thorium
nitrate would be in the fuel-modérator or in the graphite reflector. ‘Plutonium
would be bred:from the U238 in the fuel. The coolant flows from the top of the
core to the bottom through channels in the graphite blocks and exits at 1100°F
The maximum power is '11.5 MW(t).

Another concept by the same author in 1956°'was the Gas-Cycle‘Reacror,Sfin
which the fﬁel-moderator coesiSts of uranium carbide, which could be in dif-
ferent forms, such as rods or pellets. This reactor was also designed for high
temperatures, with en exit cpoiant temperature of 1350°F. ‘'The power is 20 MW(t).
| Slegel in 1951, suggested a power breeder reactor in which the fuel-

“ moderatdr is graphite impregnated with uranium dicarbide. 2 The coolant, helium
or liquid bismuth, passes through ‘axial coolant channels. Thorium fertile |
material is in either the core or a breeder blanket. The power is 1400 MW(t).

Investigations at the Studebaker-Packard Corporation, repOrfed by Thompson
in 1956;10 resulted in a design for a gas-eodled reactor, with solid homogeneodus
fuel-moderator, intended for use with a gas turbine power plant...The fuel -
moderator is a ceramic of uranium dioxide and graphite. Additional moderation.
is provided in the roughly spherical core by a central island of graphite or
beryllium and a reflector of the same material. The fuel, ‘with passages for
flow of the heélium coolant, is in the annulus between the island and thé re-
flector. The power 'is 60 MW(t). " |

© In a 1960 patent, applied for in 1956,11 Fortescue and Lockett described
a reactor with solid homogenéous fuel-moderator elements. The materials of -
the “eléments are not giveﬁ, nor is ‘the 'gas cooldnt. The Ffuel elements are sur-

rounded by a reflector of graphite. The coolant gas passeés downward between

36

the feflector and the pressure shell of the reactor, then upward between core
elements.
In Japan, work on 'semi-homogeneous' reactors (which utilize solid homo-
géneous fuel-moderators) inciudés designs for two power reactors. For one design,
a critical experiment has been operated.
Inoue et al,12 in 1958 proposed that enriched uranium oxide, impervious
graphite, and thorium oxide be incorporated into elements for a breeder reactor
with a powér of 600 MW(t). A blanket of thorium metal surrounds the core. Few
details wefe given for the structure of this reactor, which is cooled by carbon
dioxide, The outlet temperature of the coolant gas (700°C), according to the
authors, would make possible,ﬁse of the reactor with a gas or steam turbine.
The Semi-homogeneous Critical Experiment (SHE)]"'}“15 Was-reported in 1961
by Inoue:-and co-workers. Thé fuel-moderator is a uniform mixture of 20%-enriched
UO2 and graphite, formed into discs. . The discs -are placed, within a graphite
tube, in sequence with discs of graphite to form rods. The rods, in hexagonal
horizontal arrangement, are in two halves of the assembly. The halves are
brought together for criticality. The experiment operates at room temperature.
Discs of other compositions, e.g., thorium oxide for breeding, can be added to .
vary theAcore composition. Control rods are provided. 'The first loading was
in 1961; and operation of the expefiment was continuing in 1964. .
~ The Semi-homogeneous Gas Cooled Breeder Reactor (SHR)16 is very similar to
the critical experiment, but ‘it is designed for a power of 25 MW(t) and is cooled
by helium;..The fuel-moderator, UO2 6r UCvaarticles smaller than 6 p evenly dis-
persed in graphite, is in the form of pellets. They are contained in an imper-
vious graphite sheath. A blanket of thorium surrounds the core.

scheduled for late '1966.° The reactor, designed as a converter; utilizes U235

as initial fuel and willuuse.U233 after the breeding cycle has begun..' Helium-
is the_coolant, and thorium dicarbide is the fertile material. The cylindrical
fuel-moderator element is of compound structure, with graphite as moderator,
cladding, and. fuel matrix containing the fuel and fertile material in homo-
geneous dispersion. The fuel-fertile material is a mixture of uranium and
thdridm‘carbides,_as particles coated with pyrolytic carbon to control escape
of fission products. There is an upper reflector, a fuel-bearing middle section,
a bottom reflector, and an internal fission-product trap. The fuel elements are
aligned vertically in a.triangular pitch. The coolant gas flows upward in spaces
between fuel elements. The power is 115 MW(t); 40 MwW(e).

Advanced forms of the Peach Bottom reactor are under consideration 2525 a
300- to SOO-MW(e) reactor is the subject of a fesearch and development program
being carried out jointly by General Atomic and the Empire.State Atomic Develop-
ment Associate, Inc. (ESADA). -With the same type of ‘fuel elements as are in the
Peach Bottom plant, the advanced deéign is for a reactor to produce steam for a
2400 psi, 1000°F superheat, 1000°F reheat steam cycle. Development and testing
on extending fuel life are also in progress.. . A modified form of the Peach Bot-
tom fuel is being evaluated for a 1000-MW(e) reactor plant, the Thermal, Advanced
19,25 'The-prograﬁ is being
carried out by General Atomic under contract to the USAEC. This concept is being

considered for possible construction in the 1970's. The reactor would have about

the same surface temperatures as in the Peach Bottom prototype, but a more ef-

- ficient steam cycle would be used, to give a steam pressure of 3500 1b psi, super-

heat to 1050°F, and two reheats, each to 1000°F. In the most highly developed
design,25 the fuel, uranium carbide, is a bed of particles within a graphite
container. Thus it is not a solid homogeneous reactor. In a suggested alterna-

tive, features .are the same except that the fuel-moderator-fertile material

‘consists of microscopic particles (1 p or less in diameter) dispersed in a
graphite matrix. Still another possibility being evaluated is operation with

‘recycled U2v33 as fuel and thorium fertile material in the fuel-moderator elements

to achieve core breeding.

The OECD High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor Project (DRAGON),ZE'-28 had its

origin in abodt:l956, when a team of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority,

~under Fortescue, began preliminary studies. The first report was- the 1958 paper

by Shepherd et a1.267.1h‘thatvyéar, a committee was set up under the auspices of
38

the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to study col-
laboration among members of the organization, with a high~temperature gas-cooled
reactor chosen for study. -In 1959 an agreement was concluded by Austria;
Denmark, Euratom, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom for work

on this type of reactor. Development of the reactor experiment is carried out

" at Winfrith Heath, England, by staff members from the parent organizations.

The objectives of this reactor development are those of others utilizing solid
homogeneous fuel, including the attainment of exit-gas temperatures (1382°F)
higher than possible before.

The core has two zones, inner and outer, It is so divided because it is
difficult to test, in a smali‘gore that .has much higher neutron leakage, units -
comparable with those of a large reactor. In the inner zone the fuel, uranium

carbide,'is diluted with thorium carbide; in the outer it is diluted with zir-

conium carbide. The fuel-moderator is in the form of particles, which are

pressed into coﬁpacts that are inserted intb graphite fuel tubes. Seven tubes
make up a,fuel-element. The core, which is made up of 37 of these fuel elements
in a triangular lattice, is surrounded by a graphite reflector.l The coolant
gas, helium, passes upward through the core. The power is 20 MW(t).
| The reactor became critical in August.1964° I

The Experimental Beryllium Oxide Reactor (EBOR) is the land-based proto-
type for the Maritime Gas-cooled Reactor (MGCR), which is to be of higher power,
but otherwise based on E].A:’,OR.zg_31 The purpdse is to demonstrate the technology
of beryllium oxide as moderator for gas-cooled reactors’to be used in central
station and marine power plants. EBOR, which was designed by the staff of General
Atomics, is at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho. The fuel-moderator
consists of compacts of highly enriched uranium dioxide and beryllium oxide, which
are contained in Hastelloy-X fuel pins. The pins, which are arranged cylindri-
callj, are surrounded by blocks of beryllium oxide. The coolant gas, helium,
flows into and out of the reactor through two concentric passages at the side of
the reactor,. The exit temperature is 1300°F. The design of EBOR is for 10 MW(t).

32-37 formerly termed

The Ultra High Temperature Reactor Experiment (UHTREX),
TURRET, is being developed at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, with completion
scheduled for 1966. The design is for a coolant exit temperature (2400°F) appre-
ciably higherﬂthan any previouély used. The design (as TURRET) was originally
suggested for electrical generation with a high-temperature gas turbine, but-:it
was later chanéed to an'experiﬁental prototype for a process-heat reactor

operating at an unusually high temperature for the exit gas. One purpose was
39

to investigate operation at high'temperature e. g',“the hehaviorporiunclad porous
‘graphite fuel elements at'up to 3000°F. The fuel moderator consists of hollow
-graphlte cyllnders contalnlng uranium carblde as mlcrospheres coated with pyro-
lytic carbon, which delays escape of f1551on products 'The fuel-moderator
elements -are arranged in rows within channels in the cyllndrlcal graphlte core.,

The use of beryllium oxide ‘as moderator in a high- temperature pebble -bed
reactor (the HTGC, High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor) is being investigated
by workers of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission._,'38'-'llLl Beryllfum oxide
is the matrix for a solid ceramic fuel-moderator-fertile material, in which
plutonium and thorium oxides are dispersed{-MIt was designed to incorporate
the advantages of this moderator, which have been previously discussed in this
chapter. The pebble-bed concept was chosen because it permits high burnup (by
" recirculation of the pebbles) and because ho neutron absorbers need be ifcluded
in the fuel-moderator. The study of beryllium-moderated, high-temperature,
gas-cooled reactors was begun by the Australian.AEC'in 1960, and the concept
is being assesseo now for plutonium fuel; Uz'33 and U235 fuels will be considered
later. Currently, the design is for a cyllndrical core vessel containing the
pebbles, which are slowly added at the top'and’removed at the bottom. The car-
bon dioxide coolant flows up between the core ‘vessel and the pressure vessel to
the’ top then downward through’ the core, 1eav1ng the bottom at 700 800°C. The
power density is 10-20 kW/liter. '

A brief description of a helium-co6léd solid homogeneous reactor was
published in 1963 by Sternglass ét‘éi.42 :The reactor is part of a'systeﬁ
designed to utilize MHD (magrnetohydrodynamic¢) power generation. 1In the 264-
MW(e) reactor, the core is a graphite cyllnder in which fuel-moderator elements,
of uranium carblde unlformly dlstrlbuted in graphlte are contained W1th1n
vertical channels. The homogeneous fuel-moderator, which is unclad, was chosen

because the high temperatures required by the MHD unit would prevent:the use‘of

clad fuel.
Other Reactors for Electrical Power -

Although most solid homogeneous reactors for electrical power are gas-

cooled, some concepts have been advanéed for reaétors cooled by other fluids.
40

In a 1960 United Kingdom Patent,43 applied for in 1956, the fuel, moderator,
and fertile material are combined as a mixture to form fuel rods. A typical mix-

233

ture would be U ""0,, BeO, and ThO2° Boiling water is the coolant, but because

’
only enough of it ti cool the fuel elements is used, it does not act as moderator.
In an alternative to the gas-cooled Japanese Semi-homogeneous Gas Cooled
Breeder Reactor described earlier,16 Inoue et -al. suggested that liquid bismuth,

rather than helium, be used as coolant.

A low-power [about 100 kW(e) ] reactor is being developed at the Martin

Nuclear Division of the Martin-Marietta Company for a direct-conversion system,

44,45 The system is for a

Terrestial Unattended Reactor Power System (TURPS).
self-regulating constant heat sourcevat about 1000°F. 1In an early report by
Murphy, thg coolant would be phosphorus sesquisulfide, P483; and alternatives
were given for fuel and moderator: wuranium dioxide as fuel and water as mod-
erator, or a fuel-moderator of Z;UHX. Boiling P483 was chosen as coolan; be-
cause this compound has low neutron absorption and resists radiation; little

is known, however, of its flow and heat-transfer characteristics. The criteria
were for a ldw-cost, portable, system of medium size that would be reliable, be
simple toIOperate, and have low capital and operating costs. A plant with a net
power of 1.3 MW(e) was originaliy'proposed. A few details of a more recent
design have begn published. The coolant is the same, P453. The fuel-moderator
element has two segments: one is an alloy of uranium and zirconium hydride; the
other is zirconium hydride alone. 1In the.configuration developed, hydrogen can
migrate from the unfueled segment to the fueled segment to act as moderator.
Control could be by reduction of heat load in the unfueled section, which would
reduce hydrogen migration and thus reduce activity. The coolant circulates By

natural convection in a boiling-condensing cycle. A contract for investigation

of the concept has been awarded by the United States Air Force.
Reactors for Aircraft and Space Vehicles

Several reactors designed for use in airc}aft, as power sources for space
propulsion,;or as auxiliary power for space vehicles utilize solid homogeneous
fuel. Some of the concepts have been proposed for aircraft, while the Tory,
SNAP, Kiwi, Phoebus, and NERVA reactors have been prominent in the deveiopment
of space vehicles. ' - |

In 1959 patents, filed in 1949;46’47 Grebe described a reactor for propul-
sion in which the porous fuel-moderator element is in the form of porous seg-

ments of fuel-moderator, separated by coolant passages. Because of the structure

41

]

of this core, the name '"Cabbage Head'" has' been applied to it.481-The segments

, converge‘to close at one end and are joined to adjacent segments at the other
end. The segments bow outwardly, the bowing increasing as the distance from
the center increases, so that a roughly spherical or pear-shaped core is formed.
Gas flows into passages, through the porous segments, out coolant channels, and
through a jet nozzle. The patent claims that the design permits close contact
of the coolant with fissionable material and the flow of a large volume of gés
without excessive pressure loss. In a modification, the use of different mod-
erator matrix materiéls in different zones was proposed. A refractory moderator,
such as graphite, would be used in the hot zone near the nozzle, and a.less-
refractory moderator, of better nuclear properties, would be used in-the cooler
inlet zone.

An early (1952) concept-by staff members at the Bendix'Corporation'isﬁfor
a low-power water-cooled reactor in which U235 is distributed in zirconium
hydride.49

A design for a high-temﬁerature‘reactor utilizing a ceramic of highly
enriched uranium dioxide in beryllium oxide with yttrium hydride (which has- a
much higher hydrogen content than zirconium hydride) as additional moderator
was proposed by Leeth in 1958,50 The U02-Be0 and the yttrium hydride are
arranged homogeneously in concentric polygons. The coolant, air, has an exit’
temperature of between 1800°F and 2000°F.

-In 1960, Levengood, Dissler, and Kalinowski described a reactor, the PWAR-
II'(Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Reactor - II), in which the fuel-moderator is
uranium dioxide in beryllium oxide.s1 Lithium coolant flows around the hexa-
gonal containers for the fuel-moderator pins. Beryllium oxide is also the-
reflector. Designs for 510 MW(t) and 200 MW(t) reactors were given.

Newgard and Leval described in 1960 a design for rocket propulsion in
which uranium-loaded graphite plates form a core through which hydrogeﬁ propel-
lant flows.52 The reflector is made up of beryllium oxide blocks, .and control
is by movement of control plates in the reflector.

Aé part of the PLUTO program.to develop a reactor for a- nuclear ramjet
engine, two solid homogeneous reactors, Tory IIA-1 and Tory IIC, were developed

53, 5 The reactors are similar in design. In both,

and successfully tested.
the cylindrical core consists of bundles of many fuel-moderator elements (100,000
for Tory IIA-1 and several hundred thousand for Tory IIC) of highly enriched
uranium dioxide homogeneously mixed with beryllium oxide. A graphite reflector,

with rotating cylinders contadining poison rods, is used for part of the control.

42

Cooling is by single pass, straight-through flow of air from inlet, -through the
reactor, and out the exhaust. :

Tory IIA-1 first operated on Maf 14, 1961. Full power, 155 MW(t), opera-
tion took place later in 1961l. The operation of Tory IIC (May 20, 1964) at |
fulllpower was also successful. 1In that yeaf, emphasis on the project. was
reduced because of the decision that the work by the USAEC was essentially
completed. The reactors were inactivated.

Work on the SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power)SS.60 reactors
originated in the need in advanced space vehicles for compact, long-lived, and
high-power nuclear sources of electrical power. Atomics International, a
division of North Amefican Aviation,'Inc.,~began_investigating the problem in
1953, and by 1955 the type of reactor was chosen. The bases'used in the choice
included minimum weight and suitable operating temperature. 1In the general
reactor design, the fuel is U235, moderated with zirconium hydride. The cool-‘
ant is a 1iquia metal, which transfers heat to a mercury Rankine cycle or a
direct-conversion thermoelectric unit for power conversion. In 1956, the
USAEC established the SNAP program.

A homogeneous thermal reactor with highly enriched fuel and a reflector.
was chosen for several reasons. The homogeneous core with enriched fuel per-
mits small size and efficient use of the fuel. A thermal reactor is preferable
to a fast reactor because of the lower uranium inventory and less-complex
control problems. Adding a reflectoer: (beryllium)‘reduces the minimum critical
mass 6f uranium in the core. The:use of the zirconium hydride as moderator
also gives a smaller core size., To restrain thermal dissociation of this
hydride, it is claﬁ with a material that is a barrier to diffusion of hydrogen.
Control of the reactor is aécomplished'by varying the thickness or effectiveness
of the reflector, or‘By remdving it to make the reactor subcritical.

The general design was useq‘in a series of reactors: SNAP Experimental.
Reactor (SER); SNAP-2 Development Reactor (SDR or S2DR); SNAP-2; SNAP-4; SNAP-8;
SNAP-10; and SNAP-10A. The first two were preliminary developments for the
SNAP-2, SNAP-8, SNAP-10, and SNAP-10A reactors. Both operated for test periods,
SNAP-2 was intended as a low-power [3 kW(e) ] reactor for space application for
use with a mercury- Rankine power convérsion cycle; it was a predecessor of -
SNAP-8. This project was redirected. in 1963, although the Rankine cycle was
used in later developments. SNAP-8 is a joint project between the USAEC and-
the Nationai Aeronautics and Space Administration for developing a reactor of

600 kW(t), 35-50 kW(e), for space applications with a mercury Rankine cycle.
43

SNAP-10 and SNAP-10A are direct-Conversionlsystems. In SNAP-10, the heat is

. converted by conduction from the core to a thermoelectric system. In SNAP-10A,
the heat from a liquid metal coolant is converted by means of a thermoelectric
system. : , _

The SER, SNAP-2, SNAP-8, SNAP-10, aﬁd SNAP-10A differ. chiefly in power, -

dimensions, heat conversion, and some other details, but they are basically of
the general type that has been discussed. ’

The basic core configq;ation for the SNAP reactors consists of the fuel-
moderator rods, of uranium and zirconium hydride in homogeneous mixture, ar-
ranged in a triangular pattern to make up a hexagonal core. Rods are clad with
steel or Hastelloy: stainless steel for the SER and Hastelloy-N for the later
‘reactors. The beryllium reflector is in segments and contains control drums,
which can be rotated to change neutron leakage. For scram, three beryllium
safety plates fall away. The NaK coolant flows axially among the fuel elements.
In SNAP;10A the sﬁaces Between the'angles of the hexagonal core and the cylin-
drical core vessel are filled with beryllium metal.

The SE/R,SS’56 50 kW(t), operated from September 1959 until the.end of the
test program, in November 1960. During more than a third of the operating time
the outlet temperature of the coolant was 1200°F. | |

SNAP-2 Development Reactor (S2DR, SDR)55-57 was a second-generation design,

which was to approach the requirements of a space reactor. It operated suc-

cessfully from April 1961 until December 1962.

A prototype of SNAP-_8,55-57 with a higher power, 600 kW(t),.was undergoing
test operation in 1965. o
The design for SNAP-1058’59 incorporates cooling by direct conduction of

heat from the core to thermoelectric devices on the reactor face. Thus a
liquid-coolant s&stem, with pumps, etc., is eliminated. The core consists of
stacks of uranium-zirconium hydride plates, with beryllium plates alternating
to increase heat transfer. This reactor was to be controlled by a strong
negativé temperature coefficient; for startup or shutdown; halves of the
reactor are joined or separatedl This concept originated from a requirement
of the U.S. Air Force for a device to produce 200-250 Watts (electrical). 1In
1958-59 Atomics International developed this concept, with work continuing until
1960. Some réasoﬁs for redirecting the project were: the temperatﬁre raﬁge
desired (1100°F) was too high for the thermoelectric material then used (lead
telluride); and there was little prospect of the solid-fin-type heat-rejection

radiator  being developed to increase the power much beyond 300 Watts. With
44

a liquid-metal coolant, as used in the SNAP-2 reactor, the higher p5wgf8=“?;&s
are possible, - | - '

is essentially the SNAP-2 concépt with lower power, 34

The bulk of the refléctor is outside the core, and it can be éompletély‘re-

‘moved without affecting the coolant system. The direct-conversion system’

utilizes silicon-germanium alloy as the thermoelectric material. The conver-
sion system has an overall efficiency of 1.63%. SNAP-10A is the first nuclear
reactor to be orbited in space. Work on this reactor was begun in 1961 and
performance testing was begun in December 1962. A SNAP-10A reactor (FS-3)
operated in a ground test for 10,000 hours.from January 1965 to March 1966. On
April 3, 1965, another SNAP-10A (FS-4) was orbited in a.SPacéCraft. It operated
untii May 16, 1965, when the system shut down. The cause given as most pro;
bable for the shutdown was a failure in the electrical system of the satellite
carrying the SNAP-10A, rather than in the reactor itself.:

SNAP-4 differs from the other SNAP reactors in purpose and in the coolant

~used. A project on this reactor began in 1959, with the aim of developing a

reactor and turboelectric system that would be very compact and capable of long
unat tended éperation under water- or in a remote land locatibn.6 " The power
level is 1-4 MW(e). The design is very similar to that of the SNAP-2 ‘and SNAP-8.
The fuel-moderator is hydrided zirconium-uranium alloy as rods in bundles that

make up a vertical hexagonal core,62 Unlike the other SNAP reactors, SNAP-4

‘utilizes boiling water as coolant, Water boils in the core and the steam goes

to a turbine. Advantages claimed for the design are compaétness;,feasibility
(built with existing technology); low cost; safety; no maintenance during core
life; versatility in application; and automatic, unattended operation. |

A prominent application of solid homogeneous fuels: in space propulsion is
in some ‘of the Kiwi' reactors and reactors developed from them.

‘Under Project Rover, which began at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
in 1955,63 development of solid-fueled reactors as potentiél sources of flight
power was begun. An aim was to supply basic reactor design for a flight engine.

The réactors_wduld produce high temperatures and would pose no unexpected pro-
64

"blems in startup, stable operation, or shutdown.

64-66 This reactor was

The first integral reactor test was of Kiwi-A:
successfully tested on July 1, 1959. A power of 70MW(t) and an exit-gas temp-
erature of 3200°R were achieved. - The fuel élement is  made up of graphite plates

containing enriched uranium oxide.. These plates, stacked within cylindrical

45

boxes, are in an annular zone around a central island contalnlng heavy water

and control rods. A graphite flow- separator cyllnder d graphite outer re-_'
flector, and a double-walled, water-cooled aluminum presShre'vessel surround

the fuel zoné. The gaseous hydrogen coolant enters the reactor at the upper%
end of the reflector, passes down into the core -up between the fuel plates,l
into an exhaust, and out the nozzle. o ' R

After the testing of Kiwi-A, several'designé were dereloped and tested,
with the aim of proaucing a 1000-MW(t) reactor. Liqﬁid, instead of geseous,
hydrogen was the coolant used in some later develepments, and some changestiﬁ
core design were .introduced. Even the early Kiwi tests showed'thenpoteﬁtiei“
of such reactors and stimulated interest in developing a»flight engine.63

In mid-1961 the NERVA (Nuclear Energy for Rocket Vehicle Application)
program was begun under the direction of the NASA-AEC Space Nuclear‘Prdpulsidn
Office. The Aerojet'Generel'Corporafieh was designated as’ the prime con-
tractor, with Westinghouse Electrie Corporatlon as the pr1nc1pa1 subcon-
tractor for development of the reactor,’ shleldlng, and reactor controls. 63

" In the development of the Kiwi reactors, Kiwi-Bl was designed'fdr liquid
hydrogen, but the first Kiwi-B reactor that was operated (Kiwi-B-1A) utilized
gaseous hydrogen.65 It was tested on December 7, 1961, attaining a power of
330 MW(t). The test of Kiwi-B-1B (1962) was the first test in which the reactor
was started and brought to high power with liquid hydrogen as coolant. Testing
continued, with Kiwi-B-4E reaching 1000 MW(t). With Kiwi-B-4E, improved fuel
elements were utilized. The uranium is in the form of extremely small beads of
uranium carbide coated with pyrolytic carbon. The power for the test of ‘this
reactor (August and September 1964) was nearly 900 MW(t), and the temperature
of the coolant leaving the fuel elements was about 4000°R,65 Among the develop-
ments in the Kiwi-B series was the demonstration that the reactors could be
controlled by drums in the reflector,68

The next step in the development was a reaetor designed and built by
Westingheuse Electric and tested by Aerojet-General Nucleonics. This design
was based on Kiwi-B-4A.

Two of the chief problems in designing a reactor for flight were in develop-
ing a structure and fuel elements that would withstand such conditions as:
extremely high temperatures, vibration, and corrosion. The reactor, NRX (NERVA
Reactor Experiment), was given a non-nuclear test (NRX A-l) in the spring of
1964 to test stability and structure. NRX-A2, a nuclear test, was successfully

carried out in September and October, 1964063
46

In the NRX-A reactor, the fuel elementlis enriched uranium carbide, coated
with pyrolytic carbon, uniformly dispersed in graphite. The fuel-moderator
elements contain passages for flow of the coolant (hydrogen), and they are
grouped in clusters. There is an inner reflector of graphite and an outer one
of beryllium. Control is partly by 12 cylindrical beryllium drums, within the
outer reflector, that rotate to turn a poison strip to or aﬁay from the core.
There are also control rods in the core and the outer reflector.69

Concurrent with the NERVA developments has been the Phoebus program at
LASL.65’68 The Pﬁoebus reactors are advanced versions, with many improvements,
of Kiwi reactors. They are large, high-power graphite reactors intended to
provide long operating times, high'specific impulse, and restart capability.
Clustering of engines for‘pr0pulsion-is part of this program. Phoebus-1

70,71 Performance

operated in July, 1965 at its design power, 1000 MW(t).
parameters of the Phoebus-2 design illustrate some of the conditions sought:

a power of 5000 MW(t), a hydrogen flow of 285 pounds per second, and an exit-
gas temperature (from the fuel elements) of 4500°R. Above 5000°R, . graphite-

based reactors, with solid-to-gas heat exchange, will probably not be feasible.

enter as a liquid, vaporize as it is heated in passing through‘core, then dis-
sociate to atomic state in further heating. Outlet temp.: over 6000°F max. for
hydrogen. Porous structure designed to: permit close contact of éoolant gas
with fissionable material;‘and provide many short parallel paths for gas flow
through it, to allow large volume of gas to pass through in unit of time without
excessive pressure loss. The reactor could be divided into separate sections,

according to the temperature gradient in each section, with different materials

used in each section. At the hot (exit) end, a refractory material, such as

graphite, would be used. For the cooler sections:{(the inlet and the central
portions) less refractor& moderators with better nuclear characteristics would-
be used. Li7H or Bezc would be examples. Control: B or Cd control rod'may be
used,
