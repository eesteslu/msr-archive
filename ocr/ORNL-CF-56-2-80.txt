Short-Term Program (From the Present to July, 1956)

On a short-term basis the Chemical Development Fused Salt Processing
program is essentially a straightforward, systematic investigation of the
variables related to the h&drofluorination—dissolution of STR elements in
a fluoride fused salt with the objective of establishing a process flow-

sheet,

The significant varisbles were given in ORNL-56-1-67 and are temperature,
type of fluoride melt, rate of HF addition, agitation (assuming that this
ié a different varigble from rate of HF addition), and metallurgical condition
of the fuel. Perhaps it is not presumptuous to add studies on nickel cor-
rosion and efficiency of HF utilization to this list. These variables, with
the exception of the type of fluoride melt, have already been investigated to
the point where plant design should be possible (as a matter of fact, Argonne
is proceeding on this presumption). It is unlikely that any significant
changes would be made in that design on the basis of any work done in the
near future. Consequently, a preliminary flowsheet will be drawn up on
the basis of the existing information, and areas for possible further elaboration

will be pinpointed.

It is to be expected that STR element dissolution rates may be varied by
a factor of two or three by Varying the amount of agitation or by changing
the melt composition; however, it should not be expected that order-of=~
magnitude changes will be forthcoming., Unless wholly unexpected effects are
observed when melt composition is varied, it is not likely that there will be

much deviation from the simple NaF-Zth eutectic melt.

It seems reasonableito assume that agitation can only be demonstrated
to be important or unimportant in laboratory studies, and that the design
decisions will be made on the basis of engineering expediency. In light of
the above observations, it must be concluded that the primary process in-

vestigations have already been made, and that the work remaining is largely

e e
developmental.

The variables mentioned should be investigated further, and work to this

end is under way. In addition, it is planned that minor variables (e.g., the

effect of small amounts of additives to the fused salt) will be explored as
means toward process improvements, and that assistance, where useful, will

be given in the form of services to the other groups engaged in this program.
