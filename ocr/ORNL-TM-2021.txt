EFFECT OF ALLOYING ADDITIONS ON CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF NICKEL-
MOLYBDENUM ALLOYS TN FUSED FLUORIDE MIXTURES

ABSTRACT

Fused fluoride mixtures containing UF,; have been developed
as fuel solutions for high-temperature nuclear reactors. To
develop container materials for such mixtures, we investigated
the corrosion properties of nickel-molybdenum alloys with vari-
ous golid-solution strengthening additiong. These evaluations
utilized thermal convection loops which circulated salt mix-
tures between a hot~zone temperature of £15°C and a cold-zone
temperature of 650°C. '

The alloys selected for study contained 17 to 20% Mo and
various percentages of Cr, Al, Ti, V, Fe, Nb, and W. ILoops of
individual alloys were exposed to the salt mixture NaF-LiF-KF-UF,
(11.2-45,3-41.0-2.5 mole %) for periods of 500 and 1000 hr.
Measurements of the concentrations of corrosion products in
after-test salt samples indicated the corrosion susceptibility
of alloying additions to increase in this order: TFe, Nb, V,
Cr, W, Ti, and Al. However, metallographic examinations of
loop surfaces showed relatively light attack for all alloys
except those containing combined additions of aluminum and
titanium or aluminum and chromium.

A nickel-base alloy containing 17% Mo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe,
designated Hastelloy N, was found to afford the best combina-
tion of strength and corrosion resistance among the alloy
compositions tested.

 

INTRODUCTION

Molten fluorides of uranium, thorium, or plutonium, in combination
with other fluoride compounds, have wide applicability as fuels for the
production of nuclear power.l Because of their high boiling points, these
mixtures can be contained at low pressures even at extremely high
operating temperatures. Thelr chemical and physical properties impart addi-

tional advantages such as excellent stability under irradiation and large

Fuels," Nucl. Sci. Eng. 2, 797803 (1957).
solubility ranges for both uranium and thorium. These factors have
prompted design studies of molten fluoride fuel systems in conjunction
with thorium~uranium thermal breeders, uranium-plutonium converters, and
uranium burners.

The development of reactors which incorporate g circulating fluoride
sall is predicated on the availability of & construction material which
will contain the salt over long time periods and also afford useful
structural properties. The container material must also be resistant to
air oxidation, be easily formed and welded into relatively complicated
shapes, and be metallurgically stable over a wide temperature range.

In order to provide a material for initial reactor studies, several
commercially available high-temperature alloy systems were evaluated with
respect to the above requirements. As a result of these studies, Inconel,
a nickel-base alloy containing 15 wt % Cr and 7 wt % Fe, was found to
afford the best combination of desired properties and was utilized for
the construction of the Aircraflt Reactor Experiment.2 Extensive corro-~
sion tests,BJ4 as well as posttest examinations of the ARE,5 confirmed
the suitability of Inconel as a container material for relatively short-
term fluoride salt exposures. Corrosion rates encountered with this
alloy at temperatures above 700°C, however, were excessive for long-term
use with most fluoride fuel systems.

Utilizing experience gained in corrosion testing of commercial
alloys, we initiated an alloy development program to provide an advanced
container material for fluoride fuel reactor systems. The reference
alloy system was composed of nickel with a primary strengthening addition
of 15-20% Mo. This composition afforded exceptional resistance to fluo-

ride attack but lacked sufficient mechanical strength and oxidation

properties, additions of various solid-solution alloying agents were
evaluated, among them Cr, Al, Ti, Nb, Fe, V, and W. An optimum alloy
composition was selected on the basis of parallel investigations of the
mechanical and corrosion properties which were Imparted by each of these
sdditions. The composition best sulited to reactor use was determined to
be within the range 15-17 wt ¢ Mo, 6-8 wt % Cr, 4—6 wt % Fe,
0.04~0.08 wt % C, balance Ni. Subsequent studies of the alloy, desig-
nated Hastelloy N, have shown it to be extremely well sulted for appli-
cations demanding long-term compatibility with fluoride salts in the
temperature range €50-800°C.

The present research was concerned with the corrosion effects
resulting from additions of alloying elements to the nickel-molybdenum
system and an analysis of the thermodynamics of the corrosion process as

indicated by these alloying effects.
REVIEW OF RELATED WORK

Corrogion by Fluoride Mixtures

Corrosion Reactions

 

The corrosion of nickel~base alloys, containing iron and chromium,

by fluoride fuel mixtures has been found to result from a combination

of the following types of oxidation reactions:6

r?

1. Reactions’ involving impurities in the salt

PHF + Cr = CrF, + I (1)
NiF, + Cr = CrFp + Ni , (2)
FeF, + Cr = CrFp + Fe . (2)

Systems,” Progr. Nucl. Energy, Ser. IV 2, 164 (1960).

2. Reactlions involving impurities in or on the metal, for example

2Ni0 + ZrF, = ZrO, + 2NiF, (4)

followed by reaction (2).

3. Reactions involving components in the salt

CrF, + RUF5 (5)

2UF4+_C_I‘_

3UF, + Cr = CrF3 + 3UF3 . (6)
The extent of the first four of these reactions, which proceed strongly
to the right and to completion rapidly, can be reduced by maintaining low
impurity concentrations in the salt and on the surface of the metal.
Reactions (5) and (6), on the other hand, are indigenous to fluoride
systems which derive their usefulness through the containment of UF,.
While the role of chromium has been investigated extensively in connec-

tion with these reactions,8

considerably less 1nformation is available
regarding the thermodynamics of these reactions for the other alloying

elements which were of interest in the present study.

Reduction of UF, by Chromium

 

The reaction of UF, with chromium is found to be strongly influenced
by the reaction medium employed.8 In melts composed principally of

NaF-Zr#, or NaF-BeFp, the reaction produces only divalent chromium, that is,

UF, + Cr = 2UF3 + CrF, . (7)

However, in the case of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixtures used for this investiga-

tion, the reaction between chromium and UF, produces both divalent and

trivalent chromium. At equilibrium, approximately 80% of the total
chromium ions in the mixtures are observed to be trivalent, giving the

net reaction
2.8UF; + Cr = 0.2CrFz + 0.8CrFs + 2.8UF3 . (8)

where ¢ representsg thermodynamic activity. Because of the relatively
small concentrations of CrF, and UFs; which are attalned in the salt solu-
tions at equilibrium, the activities of each of these components can be
closely approximated by thelr mole fractions, in accordance with Henry's
law. Thus, for a salt system of fixed UF, concentration, assuming the

The constant KN has been experimentally determined for the mixture
LiF-KF-NaF-UF, (11.2-41.0-45.3-2.5 mole %) by equilibrating it with pure

the constant is equivalent in value to the mole fractlon of chromium lons
in the salt at equilibrium. The measured values of KN are listed in

Because the chromium-UF, reaction ig temperature dependent, chemi-
cal equilibrium between these two components is precluded in systems of
uniform alloy composition where the circulating salt continually experi-
ences a temperature change. In such systems chromium tends to be con-
tinually removed from hotter portions and deposited in cooler portions.
A theory relating the rate of this movement to the operating parameters

of the container system has been formulated by Evans.’

Corrosion of Nickel-Molybdenum Alloys

Because of the oxidation of chromium by fuel-bearing fluoride salts,

alloys employing large percentages of this element were not satisfactory

as container materials except at temperatures where diffusion rates in
the alloys were relatively low. Accordingly, evaluations were made of
several commercial alloys in which chromium was not employed ag a major
alloying addition. Based on‘these tests, allbys of nickel and molybdenum
appeared to offer the most promising container system for achieving rela-
tively high reactor operating temperatures. Unfortunately, commercially
available nickel-molybdenum alloys which exhibited excellent corrosion
properties were not well suited to contemplated reactor systems because
of three adversge characteristics: (l) poor fabricability; (2) a tendency
to age-harden and embrittle at service temperatures between 650 and
815°C (ref. 10); and (3) poor resistance to oxidation by air at elevated
temperatures. The scale formed on exposure of these alloys to high-
temperature air was of the type NiMoO,, which upon thermal cycling
between 760 and 350°C underwent a phase transformation and spalled as a
congsequence of a resultant volume chamge.ll
By means of an alloy development program, however, it wasg considered
plausible to eliminate the undesgirable features of the commercial materials
while retaining their inherent corrosion resistance. The initial objec-
tive of this program was to provide an alloy which did not embrittle under
the thermal treatments imposed by reactor operation. By experimenting
with various compositions of binary nickel-molybdenum alloys, it was
determined that lowering the molybdenum concentration to a level of 15=17%
served to avoid detrimental age-hardening effects in the alloy system.l2
Although such an alloy system was satisfactory from the standpoint of
corrosion resistaﬁce, it was necesgsary to augment the oxidation and
strength characteristics of the system through additional solid-solution
alloying agents. The corrogion effects which resulted from these addi-

tions were the subjects of the present study.

MATERIALS AND PROCEDURES
Test Materials

The nickel-molybdenum alloy compositions selected for study were
supplied by the Metals and Ceramics Division at ORNL and, under subcon-
tract agreements, by Battelle Memorial Institute and Superior Tube
Company. Alloys furnished by ORNL were induction-melted under vacuum,
while those furnished by subcontractors were induction~melted in air
using a protective slag. Each alloy heat, which ranged in weight from
12 to 100 1b, was either forged or extruded into a 3-in.~dilam tube blank
and was subsequently drawn into 1/2-in.-OD seamless tubing by the
Superior Tube Company. The cold-drawn tubing was annealed at 1120°C,
Table 2 lists the experimental alloy compositions used for this corrosion

study.
Test Equipment

The method selected to evaluate the corrosion properties of these
alloys was based on the following considerations:

1. The method necessarily had to be tailored to the use of rels-
tively small quantities of material, since 1t was practical to produce
only small heats of the many alloys desired for study.

2. Tubing was considered to be a highly desirable form in which to
lLest the material, since production of the material in this form was
carried out as an adjunct to evaluating the fabricability of each alloy.

3. Previcus demonstrations of the effects of temperature gradient
in the salt and the salt flow rate on the corrasion behavior of container
materials in fluorides made 1t mandatory that corrosion tests be con-
ducted under dynamic conditions, that is, conditions which provided for
the continuous flow of salt through a temperature gradient.

The thermal convection loop, which had been used extensively for
Inconel corrosion studies and had been developed into an extremely
straightforward and reliable test device, was Judged to be the best form
of experimental device for meeting these requirements. This device con-

sists of a closed loop of tubing, bent toc resemble the outline of a harp,

two legs of which are heated and two of which are exposed to the cooling
effects of ambient air. Flow results from the difference in density of
the salt in the hot and cold portions of the loop.

The configuration and dimensions of the loop design are presented
in FMig. 1. All loops were Tabricated of seamless tubing having an out-
side diameter of 0.500 in. and a wall thickness of 0.035 in. The tubing
was assembled by the Heliarc welding technique using an inert gas
backing.

During operation the loops were heated by a series of clamshell
registance heating elements located as shown in Fig., 1. To fill the
loop required that we apply heal to both the cold- and hot-leg sections.
Auxiliary heating for this purpose was provided by passage of electric
current directly through the tube wall. When the loop was filled, as
determined by an electrical shorting probe near the top of the loop, the
auxiliary heat source was turned off and the heating elements were turned
on. TInsulation was then removed from the cold leg to whatever amount
was required to establish a predetermined temperature gradient.

Loop temperatures were measured with Chromel-P-Alumel thermocouples
located as shown in Fig. 1. The thermocouple junctions, in the form of
small beads, were welded to the outside tube wall with a condenser dis-
charge welder and covered by a layer of quartz tape, which in turn was
covered with stainless steel shim stock. All tests were operated so as
to achieve a maximum mixed-mean salt temperature of 815°C and a minimum
salt temperature of 650°C. The maximum salt-metal interface temperature,
which was attained near the top of the vertical heated section, exceeded
the maximum bulk salt temperature by approximately 95°C (ref. 13). The
salt~flow rate under these temperature conditions was established from

heat balance calculations to be in the range of 5 to 7 ft/min.

 

1 Measurements of the maximum inside wall temperature could not
practically be made in each loop test; however, values of this tempera-
ture were recorded by means of heat balance calculations and imbedded
thermocouples using a specially instrumented test loop which exactly simu-
lated the geometry and temperature profile used in the corrosion
experiment.

Salt Preparation

The fuel mixture used in these studies was of the composition shown
in Table 3. We selected the LiF-XKF-NaF-UF, composition (Salt 107) on
the basis that the oxidation of container constituents by a given con-

entration of UF, tended to be greater for this mixture than for other
mixtures of practical importance. Thus, achievement of satisfactory
compatibility with this mixture in effect provided a container material

of ultimate versatility with respect to all fuel mixtures.

The fluoride mixtures were prepared from reagent-grade materials
and were purified by the Fluoride Processing Group of the Reactor Chemistry
Division. In general, the procedure for purification was as follows:
(1) the dry ingredients, except for UF,, were mixed, evacuated several
times for moisture removal, and then melted under an atmosphere of helium;
(2) the molten mixture was held at 815°C and treated with hydrogen for 4 hr
to purge hydrofluoric acid from the mixture; (3) the mixture was cooled to
205°C under a helium atmosphere and UF, was admitted. Upon the addition
of the UF,, the mixture was remelted, heated to 815°C, and then treated
again with hydrogen to purge the excess hydrofluoric acid.

A1l mixtures were prepared in 300-1b quantities and apportioned into
50-1b containers, after which samples were submltted for analysis of

Ni, Fe, and Cr. It was required that each of These elements be present
13

in amounts less than 500 ppm as determined from individual batch analyses.
A second before-test analysis of each salt mixture was obtained from a

sample of the salt ﬁaken as it was being admitted to the test loop.
Operating Procedures

FEach loop was thoroughly degreased with acetone and checked for
leaks using a hellum mass spectrometer. After thermocouples and heaters
were aésembled and insulation was applied, the loop was placed in a test
stand, as shown in Fig. 2. |

The sall charging pot was connected to the loop with nickel or
Inconel tubing, and both the loop and the charging pot weré heated to
650°C under a dynamic¢ vacuum of less than 50 1 Hg. HellumApressure WaS
then applled to the charging pot in order to force the salt mixture from
the pot to the loop. After fllllng, salt was;allowed to stand in the
loop at 650°C for approximately 2 hr, so thatfoxides and other impuri-
ties would be dissolved from the container suﬁface into the salt mixture.
This mixture was then removed, and a fresh salt mixture Wa s admitted
from_the fluoride charging pot. A helium cover gas under glight positive
pressure (approx 5 psig) was maintained over the salt mixture during all
periodé of testing. _ |

At the end of test, power to the looyp was cut off and insulation
was stripped from the loop so as to freeze the salt mixture as rapidly

as possible.
Test Examination

Each loop was sectioned witﬁ a tubing cuﬁter into approximately
C-in. lengths. Five 2-in. sections were then removed from the loop posi-
tions indicated in Fig. 1 for metallographic examination, Two of the
remaining &~in. sections, one from the hottest section of the loop
(speC1men H) and one from the coldest section. (spe01men C)- were obtained
for salt chemistry studies, and the remaining loop segments were held in
storage until all examinations of the loop were completed.

salt removal was accomplished by heating each section in a small

tube furnace at 600°C in helium. The salt was collected in a graphite

crucible located below the furnace windings. The five 2-in. sections of
tubing were examined metallographically, and the galt samples were sub-
mitted individually for petrographic and chemical analysez. If layers
of corrogion products were discovered on the tube wall, samples of the
tubing and salt contained in that section were also submitted for x~ray

diffraction examination.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Alloying effects were evaluated in terms of both the corrosion
products entering the salt mixtures and the metallographic appearance of
the alloy after test. Resulis have been grouped in this section

according to the alloying element studied.
Chromium

Corroasion-Product Concentrations

 

Effects of chromium additions were examined in six ternary alloys
with chromium contents of 3.2 to 11.0 at. %. One loop of each of these
compositions was operated with Salt 107 for 500 hr under the test condi-
tions described above. The compositions investigated and the attendant
concentrations of chromium icns in salt samples taken at the conclusion
of these tests are shown in Table 4. The extent of reaction between
chromium and fluoride constituents, as indicafed by the chromium ion con-
centrationg, increased with the amount of chromium in the alloy. This
increase 1s illustrated graphically in Fig. 3, where the data are com=-
pared with data for Inconel* and for pure chromium.® It may be noted
that the chromium concentrations of the salts were less than those for
Inconel loops operated under ldentical temperature conditions. A hori-

zontal line, which represents the chromium ion concentration at

the observed concentrations were less than those required for the forma-
tion of pure chromium crystals in the coldest portion of the loops
(approx 650°C).

the conditions of these tests should be governed by the relation

maximum and minimum loop temperatures, are plotted in Fig. 3 and are
seen to include only two of the observed loop concentrations, both corre-
sponding to chromium compositions greater than 7 at. %. However, except
for the alloy with least chromium content, all concentrations lie rel-
atively close to the lower bound and roughly approximate the slope of
this bound.

tests from the predicted concentration ranges may have resulted primarily

from inaccuracy in the assumpiion that N eguals « However, assuming

ac to be accurately known, the corrosion-product concentrations in these
T
tests would nevertheless have been lower than those predicted, since cor-

rosive attack would necessarily reduce the chromium content and hence the
18

chromium activity at the surface of the alloys relative to the original
chromium activity. We also examined the possibility that the test times
were not sufficiently long for the chromium concentration of the galt to
have completely attained the maximum or steady-state level. To evaluate
this latter point, sufficient material of one of the alloy compositions,
heat OR 30-2, was obtained to permit the operation of a 1000-hr test.
Results of this test, which are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3, indicated
that only a small increase in chromium concentration cccurred between the
500- and 1000-hr intervals. Tt was concluded, therefore, that the 50C-hr
test provided a reasonably close estimate of the limiting corrosion-
product concentrations assoclated with the temperature conditions of these
experiments.

Additional data on the effects of chromium in nickel-molybdenum alloys
were afforded by tests of five alloys which contained chromium in comblna-
tion with one or more other alloying elements, as shown in Table 5. Not-
withstanding the additional alloying agents, the concentrations of
chromium-containing corrosion products following 500-hr tests of these
alloys in Salt 107, as shown in Table 5, were comparable to the concen-
trations associated with the simple ternary chromium-containing alloys.
The corrosion-product concentrations for the alloys with multiple additions
are plotted in Fig. 4, and are seen to show the same general variation
with chromium content as the ternary alloys (see Fig. 3).

Also shown in Table 5 and Flg. 4 are the results of 1000-hr tests of
four of the alloys containing multiple additions. After all but one of
these tests, the chromium ion concentrations in the salts were slightly
higher than for 500-hr tests of the same alloys; in one test, the chromium
ion concentration was unaccountably lower. The chromium ion concentra-
tions of these multicomponent alloys again fell near thoge predicted on
the basis of equilibrium data for pure chromium at 6C0°C and were con-
siderably less than the concentration needed to deposit pure chromium at
600°C,

The chromium activities in all of the alioys tested would appear on
the basis of corresponding corrosion-product concentrations to be lower
than the activity of chromium in Taconel. However, 1t is important tc

note in Figs. 3 or 4 that any alloy in which the chromium activity

equilibrium with the alloy at temperatures of 800°C or above, Thus,
unless the activity coefficients for chromium in these alloys are much

smaller than unity, the possibhility for the deposition of pure chromium
in cold-leg regions cannot be completely excluded for any of the alloys
tested,

activity equivalent to or less than that for Inconel cannot support
chromium ion concentrations at 800°C which are sufficiently high to main-
tain pure chromium at ©00°C. Consequently, mass transfer of chromium

by deposition of pure chromium crystals in the latter salt mixtures

should not be possible for any of the alloys listed in Tables 4 and 5.

Metallographic Results

 

Metallographic examinations of the ternary alloys shown in Table 4
showed little evidence of corrosive attack other than shallow surface
roughening. Void formation, which characteristically had been found in
nickel-chromium alloys under similar test conditions,l7 was not detected
in any of these alloys. The relative depths of attack which occurred
for the alloy containing 5.55 at. % Cr (heat OR 30-2) after 500- and
1000-hr tests, respectively, are compared in Fig. 5. Although the depth
of attack was similar at both time intervals, the intensity of surface
pitting was somewhat greater after the 1000-hr exposure. The intensity
of surface roughening was also found to increase with increasing chro-
mium concentration. This is seen in Fig. & which compares photomicro-
graphs of two alloys containing different chromium contents. Cold~leg
sections of these loops showed no evidence of corrosion and contained
no visible deposits of corrosion products.

The depths of attack observed metallographically for alloys con-
taining chromium in combination with other additions are shown graphi-
cally in Fig. 7. Attack in these alloys was manifested as surface
roughening after 500 hr and as a combination of surface pitting and
shallow void formation after 1000 hr. Depths of corrosion were in gen-
era). higher than for the ternary chromium-containing alloys, particularly

in alloys which contained aluminum additions.

Corrosion-Product Concentrations

with nickel-molybdenum alloys containing single additions of aluminum.

In the case of alloys containing greater than 2 at. % Al, the corre-
sponding aluminum concentrations in the salt mixture were relatively
high, that is, in the range of 0.15-0.37 mole %. Only one alloy composi-
tion was subjected to tests at both 500 and 1000 hr; however, results

for this alloy suggest thatl effectively similar sallt concentrations were

realized for both time intervals. Table 7 lists the concentrations of
corrosion products which formed in salt mixtures circulated in loops
containing aluminum in corbination with other alloying elements. These
concentrations were of the same general magnitudes as those observed for
the ternary Ni-Mo-Al alloys.

The corrosion-product concentrations showed no definable correspon-
dence with the aluminum content of the alloys. However, the propensity
for aluminum to react with interstitial contaminants, such as nitrogen,
in these alloys, makes the activity of aluminum in the alloys very depen-
dent on composition and metallurgical history. TFor this reason poor
correspondence between the corrosion-product concentration and total
aluminum concentration in the alloy would not be unexpecied.

It is apparent from tests of both the ternary and multicomponent
alloys that aluminum additions less than 2 at. % give rise to very much
lower aluminum ion concentrations than additions above 2 at. %. This
obgervation may svggest that below a concentration of 2 at. % the bulk
of the aluminum addition has formed highly stavle compounds with

interstitial contaminants in the alloy.

the form of surface pitting and subsurface void formation. Void formation
was evident to a depth of 0.002 in. in 500-hr tests of these alloys and

to 0.003 in, in 1000-hr tests. Figure & shows the appearance of an alloy
containing 4.27 at. % Al after a 1000-hr test exposure. However, an
alloy containing only 1.22 at. % Al revealed negligible attack after a
500-hr exposure to Salt 107.

Alloys containing aluminum combined with other alloying components
also exhibited both surface pitting and subsurface void formation after
exposure to Salt 107. The depths of attack for these alloys are shown
graphically in Fig. 7. Additions of up to 2 at. % Al resulted in only
light attack except in alloys where chromium additions were also present.
Alloys which contained over 2.5 at. % Al in combination with chromium or
titanium revealed pronounced attack in the form of subsurface voids to
depths ranging from 0.002 to 0.0045 in. Cold-leg sections of all loops

were unattacked and contained no insoluble corrosion products.

concentrations of 0.038-0,040 mole % after 500 hr and 0.040-0,055 mole %
after 1000 hr. These analyses correspond closely to the analyses of
salts circulated in loops constructed of the other titanium-bearing
alloys, in which titanium contents ranged from 1.68-3.24 at. %. Only
the test of the 2.71 at. % alloy effected a titanium salt concentration
significantly different from the ternary alloy, the concentration in

the former test being unaccountably lower than for the other tests.

Metallographic Results

 

The ternary titanium-bearing alloy revealed only light attack in
the form of surface pitting after both the 500- and 1000-hr test inter-
vals. The photomicrograph in Fig. 9 shows the appearance of a typical
hot-leg section of this alloy after the longer test interval. Depths of
attack which were observed in the remainder of the titanium-bearing
alloys are graphically depicted in Fig. 7. Except where aluminum addi-
tions were present in these alloys in amounts greater than 2 at. %,

depths of attack were in all cases less than 0.003 in. and generally

surface pitting and shallow vcid formation. No attack was seen in the
cold-leg sections of any of the titanium-containing loops nor were cold-

leg deposits detected.
Vanadium

Corrosion-Product Concentrations

Loops were operated with two ternary alloys containing vanadium
additions of 2.73 and 5.11 at. %, respectively. As shown in Table 9,
the vanadium concentration detected in a salt mixture tested with the
former alloy after 500~hr exposure was less than 0.005 mole %. However,
galts operated with the alloy of higher vanadium coantent contained
0.027 mole % V in a 500~hr test and 0.019-0.020 mole % V in a 1000-hr
test.

Metsllographic Results

 

Metallographic examination of the alloy with 2.73 at. % V revealed
very light attack in the form of surface roughening. Hot-leg surfaces
of the alloy with 5.11 at., % V exhibited attack in the form of void
formation to a depth of 0.002 in. in the 500-hr loop and 0.004 in. in
the 1000~hr loop. A photomicrograph illustrating attack incurred by the

latter loop is shown in Fig. 10,
Iron

Corrosion-Product Concentrations

 

Only two loop tests were completed with alloys containing iron as a
ma jor addition. Results of both tests, one of which operated for 500 hr
and the other for 1000 hr, arse summarized in Table 2, In the 500-hr
loop, which contained 4.12 at, % Fe, after-test salt samples were ana-
lyzed to contain 0,013-0.015 mole % Fe. In the 1000~hr loop, which con-
tained 5.56 at., % Fe together with aluminum and chromium additions, the
after~test salt samples contained an even lower iron concentration, It

would appear that corrosion products formed by reactions involving

chromium and aluminum in this latter test served to inhibit the reaction

with iron.

Metallographic Results

 

Metallographic examinations of specimens from the 500-hr loop showed
no evidence of attack other than light surface roughening. Examinations
of the 1000~hr test, as indicated in Fig. 7, showed corrosive attack to

a depth of 0.003 in. in the form of small subsurface voids.

Niobium

Corrosion-Product Concentrations

 

Loop tests of 500- and 1000-hr durations were carried out with ter-
nary alloys containing 2.20 and 3.62 at. % Nb, respectively. As shown
in Table 10, the niobium concentrations in salts exposed to these alloys
increased from a value near 0.015 mole % in the 500-hr tests to values

of from 0.022 to 0.025 mole % in the 1000-hr tests. Salts tested with

alloys which contained niobium combined with other additions showed very
much lower niobium concentrations than did the simple ternary alloys.

As seen in Table 11, concentrations in the multiple-addition tests were
less than 0.002 mole % for niobium contents as high as 3.62 at., %. Thus,
it appears that corrosion products formed by reactions with other com-
ponents in these alloys, namely titanium, aluminum, and chromium, were

effective in inhibiting reaction of the salt with nicbium.

Metallographic Results

 

Neither ternary alloy containing niobium showed sgignificant attack
in metallographic examinations of 5CC~hr tests; however, the presence of
very small subsurface volds to depths of approximately 0.001 in. was
detected in examinations of the 1000-hr tests, as illustrated in Fig. 11.
Corrosion results determined for alloys containing niobium together with
other additions are summarized in Fig. 7. Except where aluminum and
chromium were both present, attack in these alloys was legs than

0.002 in. in depth.

Tungsten

Corrosion-Product Concentrations

 

Single alloying additions of tungsten to the nickel-molybdenum sys-
tem were evaluated at levels of 0,72 and 1.44 at. %, respectively. Loop
tests of both alloys were conducted for 500 hr, at which time tungsten
concentrations in the salt mixtures had reached levels of 0.029 to
0,032 mole %, In 500-hr tests of two alloys which contained tungsten in
addition to chromium, niobium, or aluminum, the concentration of tungsten
detected in salt samples was below 0.010 mole %. Compositions of these
alloys and their attendant salt corrosion-product concentrations are

shown in Table 1Z2.

Metallographic Results

 

Metallographic examination of loops constructed of nickel-molybdenum-
tungsten alloys revealed only slight surface pitting, as illustrated in
Fig. 12. The addition of aluminum together with tungsten led to heavy
surface pitting, while the addition of aluminum, chromium, and niobium

produced subsurface voids to a depth of 0.0025 in., as shown in Fig. 7.

Relative Thermodynamic Stabilities of Alloying Constituents

Since the salt mixtures supplied for this investigation were very
uniform in composition, one can presume that the same relative activities
of UF, and UF; existed at the start of each test. It follows, therefore,
that the relative extent of reaction which occurred between the salt
mixtures and an alloying element

should be directly related to the activity of the fluoride compounds,

An indicatlon of the relative activities of these compounds is provided

In Table 13 are listed the standard free energies of formation, ver gram-

each of the alloying elements investigated. Values are given for the
most stable compounds (that is, those with most negative free energies)
reported*® for these elements, and are listed in order of decreasing
stabllities. The resultant order suggests that corroslion-product
concentrations associated with eéch element at a given activity should
have increased in the following order: W, Nb, Fe, Cr, V, Ti, and Al.

with the exception of niobium and tungsten, the concentrations per atomic
per cent of addition do increase in the exact order predicted. Only
tungsten noticeably deviates from this predicted behavior; the causes
for this deviation have not been established, although the number of

tests completed on alloys with tungsten additions were quite limited.

General Discussion of Alloying Effects

The corrosion-product concentrations associated with either iron,
niobium, or tungsten alloying additions were much lower when these ele-
ments existed in multicomponent alloys than in simple ternary alloys.
The reason for this behavior is undoubtedly associated with the presence
of the more reactive alloying additions in the multicomponent alloys.
Consider, for example, a gystem containing comparable additions of

chromium and iron, for which the corrosion reactions are

Cr + 2UF, = CrFp + 2UF3: MGy (14)

Fe + 2UF,; = FeFp + 2UF3: OG- (15)

40

Since AGI is considerably more negative than AGIT’

concentration produced by the first reaction is higher than that which

the equilibrium UF,

would be produced by the second reaction. According to the law of mass
action, therefore, the FeF, concentration at equilibrium should be
reduced in the presence of chromium compared to a system containing iron
only.

While this means of corrosion inhibition was effective for those
alloylng components less reagctive than chromium, its effect was not
apparent among elements of relatively high reactivities. Thus, chromium
corrosion-product concentrations were the same in the case of alloys con-
taining both aluminum and chromium as in the case of alloys containing
chromivm alone. Similarly, the presence of aluminum did not noticeably
reduce the titanium-corrosion products associated with titanium-containing
alloys. For most of the multicomponent alloys, the amount of chromium and
titanium, on an atomic percent basis, exceeded that of aluminum; conse-
quently their activities could have approached the activity of the alumi-
num component. Nevertheless, the high aluminum concentrations of fluo-
ride mixtures after these tests suggest a level of UFj3 higher than would
have been produced by either chromium or titanium alone, so that some
inhibitive action would be predicted. The fact that none occurred may
suggest that the measured aluminum concentrations were somewhat higher

than actually existed. '’

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The corrosion properties of solid-solution alloying elements in the
Ni—17% Mo system were investigated in molten mixtures of NaF-LiF-KF-UF,
(11.241.0-45.32.5 mole %). The corrosion susceptibility of alloying
additions was found to increase in the following order: Fe, Nb, V, Cr,

W, Ti, and Al. With the exception of tungsten, the susceptibility of

 

19considerable difficulty was in fact encountered in analyses of
this element by wet chemical methods. Analyses of a limited number of
samples were consequently made using semiquantitative spectirographic
techniques. Concentrations obtained by the latter technique were lower
by a factor of approximately 2/3 than the values that were reported in
Tables & and /.
41

these elements to corrosion increased in approximately the same order as
the stavilities of fluoride compounds of the elements.

The corrosion-product concentrations produced by either iron, nio-
bium or tungsten alloying additions in the above salt mixture were much
lower when these elements existed in combination with chromium, titanium,
or aluminum than when they existed as single alloying additions. In con-
trast, corrosion-product concentrations agsociated with chromium, tits-
nium, or aluminum were unchanged by the presence of other alloying
constituents.

The metallographic examinations of all alloys investigated under
this program showed considerably less corrosion than Inconel under equliv-
alent conditions. Surface roughening or shallow pitting was manifegted
in hot-leg sections of all the loops tested. Shallow subsurface voids
were also seen in aluminum- and nicbium-containing systems. Alloys con-
taining more than one alloying addition invariably were attacked to
depths greater than alloys containing each of the additions individually.
The greatest depths of attack, which ranged from 0.003 to 0.0045 in. in
1000~hr exposures, were incurred in alloys which contained combined addi-
tions of aluminum and chromium or aluminum and titanium. Alloys without
either aluminum or titanium in no case exhibited attack to depths of
more than 0.002 in. and generally showed attack in the range from
0.001 to 0.002 in.

In the case of the majority of alloys tested, the depth of attack
increased at a greater rate between O and 500 hr than between 500 and
1200 hr, This finding is in agreement with the concentrations of corro-
sion products, which in general increased only slightly between the peri-
odg of 500 and 1000 hr. Both results suggest that nearly steady-state
conditions were established within the first 500 hr of test operation.

In view of the generally favorable results of these tests, one has
congiderable freedom in the choice of potential alloying components for
nickel-molybdenum alloys for molten salt service. Only titanium and
aluminum appear to afford potential corrosion problems, particularly if
used as combined additions or in combination with chromium. Thus, the
choice of an optimum alloy composition for any given application can he

Judged mainly on the basis of gtrength and fabrication requirement.
