F. J. Smith, L. M. Ferris, and C. T. Thompson
ABSTRACT

Liquid-vapor equilibrium data for several LiF-BeFs and LiF-BeFo-
ThF, systems were obtained by the transpiration method over the tem-
perature range of 900 to 1050°C. Relative volatilities, effective
activity coefficients, and apparent partial pressures are tabulated for
the maojor components, as well os for solutes such as UF4, ZrFy, CsF,
RbF, and some rare-earth fluorides. The values are in reasonable a-
greement with those reported in the literature. ~ Results of this study
show that distillation may not be feasible as a primary separations
method in the processing of single=fluid MSBR fuels.

1. INTRODUCTION

To be an efficient breeder, a molten-salt reactor must be close-coupled to o
chemical processing facility to provide for the continuous removal of protactinium,
fission products, and corrosion products from the system. The initial molten-salt
breeder reactor (MSBR) con'::ep’i“s-l'2 were based on the use of two fluids: a fuel
salt composed of LiF-—BeF2 (66~34 mole %) containing about 0.3 mole % UF4, and
a blanket salt having the approximate composition LiF-Ber-ThF4 (73-2-25 mole %).
Recenﬂy,3 however, emphasis has been centered on a single-fluid MSBR that would
utilize a salt such as LiF—BeFZ—ThF4-UF4 (72-16-12~0.3 mole %). Considerable
effort was expended on the development of o fluorination-distillation mefhod4"7
for the processing of the fuel salt from a two-fluid MSBR.  Fluorination wos selected
as the method for removing the uranium from the salt as UFé, and distillation was
proposed as the means for separating the rare-earth fission products from the bulk
of the LiF- BeF2 carrier sc;lh Results of batch distillotion experiments by Kelly8
and experiments by Scott’ in asimple closed vessel with a "cold finger” to collect

the vapor sample indicated that the rare-earth separation factors were about 100,

the condenser is removed and the salt contained within is dissolved. Analyses of
the solution, along with the pressure of the system and the volume of inert gas used,
provide the information necessary for calculating apparent partial pressures of the

components of the system.

The transpiration apparatus, shown schematically in Fig. 1, closely resembles
that used by Sense et al. 2 and Cantor. 13 The basic components consisted of a
36~in.-long alumina tube contained in a 1é-in.-long Marshall furnace. A nickel
[iner was placed inside the alumina tube to protect the alumina from corrosion by the
fluoride vapors and to help "flatten" the temperature profile. The temperature profile
of the Marshall fumace was adjusted by the use of shunis until the hottest region of
the furnace was located exactly in the center and the maximum temperature variation
(at 1000°C) over the length of the nickel boat (used to contain the salt sample) was
5°C. The furnace temperature was conirolled by a Wheelco "Capacitrol” time-
proportional controller and a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple. The temperatures of the
melt and vapor were measured by means of Chromel-Alumel thermocouples and a Brown

recorder.

Salt samples (about 100 g) of the desired composition were initially treated, in
graphite containers, with HF- H2 mixtures at 850 to 900°C to remove oxide im-
purities; residual HF and H2 were stripped from the salt with high-purity argon.
After being cooled to room temperafure, each salt ingot was transferred (under argon)
to the nickel boat, which was placed in the center of the Marshall furnace. The
transpiration apparatus was heated (with argon flowing slowly) to the desired tem-
perature. Then a condenser was inserted into the system, and iranspired vapors were

collected over a predetermined length of time.

Each condenser (made of 1/4-in.-diam nickel tubing) had a 1/32-in.~diam hole
in the end that was in contact with the vapor phase above the salt sample. The
carrier gas was high=purity argon that had been further purified by passage through
a Molecular Sieve trap to remove water and through a heated (450°C) trap filled
with metallic copper to remove oxygen. Removal and replacement of the condensers

could be accomplished while the system remained at temperature; thus duplicate

samples at a given fempercfﬁre and/or a series of samples at different temperatures
could be obtained using a single batch of salt. After a condenser was removed, its
exterior was polished to remove surface contamination. The condenser waos then
cut into sections, and the salt contained within was recovered by leaching the
sections with T N H2504. Aliquots of the leachate were submitted for the desired

analyses.

Apparent partial pressures were calculated from the following expression:

N, P
PA N+Né o N +M 7
A B T n
where

PA = the apparent partial pressure of species A,

P = the total pressure of the vaporized salt and carrier gos,
NA = total moles of species A collected in the condenser, and

M = total moles of carrier gas passed through the sysiem.

This expression was derived by assuming that the behavior of each gos wos ideal

and that Dalton's law of partial pressures wos applicable.

The franspiration method gives no direct information about the molecular for-
mulas of the vapor species or about the total vapor pressure of the system. Therefore,
it was assumed that each species existed as the monomer in the vapor phase. In
using this method, the gas flow rate must be carefully controlled. If it is too high
(i.e., greater than the rate at which evaporation occurs at the liquid surface), the
carrier gas will not become saturated with vapor and the measured value of the
vapor pressure will be low. [f it is too low, thermal diffusion effects in the vapor

phase will make the calculated value of P, too large. For the experimental ap-

paratus described above, the measured vapAér pressure of a typical salt was found to
be independent of the argon flow rate in the range of 15 to 50 cc (STP)/min. There-
fore, no correction was needed for diffusion or kinetic effects. Under the conditions
used, no change in the composition of the liquid phase was detected during the course

of an experiment.

Y = 1). The resulis of the study presented in this report show that RbF and CsF also
behave almost ideally; their activity coefficients are near unity (Table 1). Uranium

3.2 Systems of Interest in Processing Single-Fluid MSBR Fuels

Liquid-vapor equilibrium studies of several L'i'F“-Ber-'ThF‘4 systems have been
made to determine the feasibility of using certain distillation steps in the processing
of single-fluid MSBR fuels. The data are summarized in Table 2. A typical partial-
pressure=-temperature plot is shown in Fig. 4. The partial pressures and the predicted
total pressures were calculated assuming that only monomers existed in the vapor.
Corrections for association in the vapor (known to occur in the vapor above pure LiF
and F.iF--BeF2 systems) would cause both the calculated partial pressures and the

predicted total pressures to be lower.

In addition to the systems shown in Table 2, a limited amount of data was ob-
tained with LiF-Ber-ThF4
LiF~BeF2—ThF -Lch3 (36.6-1.0-59.6-2.8 mole %) gave the following relative

4., CONCLUSIONS

.Mecsuren;jents made with three different _LiF-__BeFQ solutions indicated that a melt
having the appg’oximqi’e composii‘ion LEF—Ber (90-10 mole %) will, ot 1000°C, be

~in equilibri.um with vapor having the composition Li_F—BeF2 (66-34 mole %). The

latter composition is that desired for the fuel salt for o two-fluid MSBR. The re-

' and most of the LiF and BeF_ from

_ _ 4 7 T2
the fuel salt of a two-fluid MSBR, leaving fission products such as the rare earths

sults of this study show that recovery of the UF

in the still-pot bottoms, is not possible in a single-stage distillation system because
the vo!diil.ii'y’ of the UF4'is too low. '-The fluorides of the fission products cesium,
zsrcomum, and rubldzum have high relahve volatilities, cmd would therefore con-

centrate in fhe distillate wui'h the LiF and BeF Aithough i'he relative volatilities

original conclusion™ that distillation is best applied to the processing of two-fluid

MSBR fuel salt after the uranium has been removed by fluorination.

The few results obtained with LEF—Ber-ThF4 systems showed that the volatilities
of both the rare-earth fluorides and ThF4 are low, even at 1000°C. 1t is possible
that the rare-earth-thorium separation required in the processing of single-fluid MSBR
fuels could be achieved by distillation; however, the results of this work indicate
that the temperature required to achieve adequate distillation rates would have to be
at least 1200°C. Thus, determination of relative volatilities for the rare-earth
fluorides and ThF4 at temperatures above 1000°C will be required in order to assess

the feasibility of utilizing distillation in the processing of single-fluid MSBR fuels.
