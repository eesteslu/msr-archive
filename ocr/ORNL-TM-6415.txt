EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION

Molten-salt reactors (MSRs) are of interest in possible prolifera-

£33y power plants that

tion-resistant systems, particularly as denatured
could be widely deployed with minimal risk of proliferation. MSRs might
also be used as "fuel facteries" in secure centers, burning plutonium and
producing 2337, However, before they can be used, the MSR concept must

be developed into a commercial reality. The purpose of this report is

to review the status of molten-salt technology from the standpoint of

the development required to establish an MSR industry.

Following the successful operation of the Molten~Salt Reactor Ex-
periment (MSRE, 1965—69), it became necessary for the government to de-
cide if MSR development should be continued. To this end, a comprehensive
report on MSR technolegy was published in August 1972.' Because only
limited R&D has been conducted since then, most of the information in
the report is still valid and will be taken as the basis for the present
review. Some additional development work done in 1974—76 will be used to
update the conclusions of the 1972 study. The government decided not to
proceed with the further develecpment of the Molten—-Salt Breeder Reactor

(MSBR), or any other MSR, for reasons other than technological ones.

DEVELOPMENT STATUS, 1972

The development status of MSBRs in 1972 is covered thoroughly in
Ref, 1. All aspects of reactor development, from reactor physics to
materials of construction, are covered and wilil not be repeated here.
Of particular interest in that review are the discussions of technologi-
cal advances believed to be needed before the next MSR could be built.
These needed advances are defined briefly in the introduction of that

report as follows:

"In the technology program several advances must be made before we
can be confident that the next reactor can be built and operated success-—

fully. The most important problem to which this applies is the surface
viii

cracking of Hastelloy N, Some other developments, such as the testing
of some of the components or the work on latter stages of the processing
plant development, could actually be completed while a reactor is being
designed and built. The major developments that we believe should be

pursued during the next several years are the following:

"l1. A modified Hastelloy N, or an alternative material that is im-
mune to attack by tellurium, must be selected and its compatibility with
fuel salt demonstrated with out-of-pile forced-convection loops and in-
pile capsule experiments; means for giving it adequate resistance to
radiation damage must be feound, if needed, and commercial production of
the alloy may have to be demonstrated. The mechanical properties data
needed for code qualification must be acquired if they do not already
exist.

"2, A method of intercepting and isolating tritium to prevent its
passage into the steam system must be demonstrated at realistic conditions
and on a large enocugh scale to show that it is feasible for a reactor.

"3. The various steps in the processing system must first be demon-
strated in separate experiments; these steps must then be combined in an
integrated demonstration of the complete process, including the materials
of construction. Finally, after the MSBE* plant is conceptually designed,
a mock-up containing components that are as close as possible in design
to those which will be used in the actual process must be built and its
operation and maintenance procedures demonstrated.

"4, The various components and systems for the reactor must be de-
veloped and demonstrated under conditions and at sizes that allow con-
tident extrapolation to the MSBE itself. These include the xenon strip-
ping system for the fuel salt, off-gas and cleanup systems for the coolant
salt (facilities in which these could be done are already under construc-
tion), tests of steam—generator modules and startup systems, and tests of
prototypes of pumps that would actuaily go in the reactor. The construc-
tion of an engineering mock-up of the mazjor components and systems of the

reactor would be desirable, but whether or not that is done would depend

plant.

on how far the development program had proceeded in testing various com-—
ponents and systems individually.

"5. Graphite elements that are suitable for the MSBE should be
@ purchased in sizes and quantities that assure that a commercial produc-

tion capability does exist, and the radiation behavior of samples of

4 the commercially preduced material should be confirmed. Exploration
of methods for sealing graphite to exclude xenon should continue.

"6. On-line chemical analysis devices and the various instruments
that will be needed for the reactor and processing plant should be pur-
chased or developed and demonstrated on lcops, processing experiments,

and mock-ups."

The first three objectives were considered crucial to the MSBR con-
cept; the results of further development effort on them during 1974—76
are discussed in the following section. Objectives 4 to 6, while im-
portant, did not appear to present any insurmountable obstacles; in any

event, they could not be pursued further because of limited funding.

RESULTS OF R&D — 1972 TO PRESENT

At the direction of AEC/ERDA,* the MSR program was discontinued in
early 1973, resumed in 1974, and finally terminated at the end of FY
1976. Although the development effort since 1972 has been severely re-

stricted, some significant results were obtained from work performed

mainly in 1974—76.

Alloy Development for Molten-Salt Service

 

The nickel-based alloy Hastelloy N, which was specifically developed
for use in molten-salt systems, was used in construction of the MSRE.
The material generally performed very well, but two deficiencies became
apparent: (1) the alloy was embrittled at elevated temperatures by ex-
posure to thermal neutrons and (2) it was subject to intergranular sur-

face cracking when exposed to fuel salt containing fission products.

 

"Now the U.S. Department of Energy.
Recent development work indicates that solutions are available for both
these problems. Details of this work are given by McCoy;2 a summary of
the results follows.

Irradiation experiments early in the MSR develcopment program showed
that Hastelloy N was subject to high-temperature embrittlement by thermal
neutrons. The MSRE was designed around this limitation (stresses were
low and strain limits were not exceeded), but the development of an im-
proved alloy became a prime objective of the materials program. It was
found that a modified Hastelloy N containing 27 titanium had much im-
proved postirradiation ductility, and extensive testing of the new alloy
was under way at the close of MSRE operations.

The second problem, intergranular surface cracking, was discovered
at the close of the MSRE operation when surface cracks were observed
after strain testing of Hastelloy N specimens that had been exposed to
fuel salt. Research since that time has shown that this phenomenon is
the result of attack by tellurium, a fission product in irradiated fuel
salt, on the grain boundaries.

As a result of research from 1974 to 1976, two likely soclutions to
the problem of tellurium attack have been developed. The first involves
the development of an alloy that is resistant to tellurium attack but
still retains the other required properties. This development has pro-
ceeded sufficiently to show that a modified Hastelloy N containing about
1% niobium has good resistance to tellurium attack and adequate resistance
to thermal-neutron embrittlement at temperatures up toc 650°C. It was
‘also found that alloys containing titanium, with or without niobium, ex-
hibited superior neutron resistance but were not resistant to tellurium
attack.

The secend likely solution involves the chemistry of the fuel salt.
Recent experiments indicate that intergranular attack on Hastelloy N
is much less severe when the fuel-salt oxidation potential, as measured
by the ratio of utt to U3+, is less than 60.% This discovery opens up

the possibility that the superior titanium-modified Hastelloy N could

be used for MSRs through careful control of the oxidation state of the
fuel salt.

Both of the above scolutions appear promising, but extensive testing
under reactor conditions would be required before either could be used

in the design of a future MSK.

Tritium Control

 

Large quantities of tritium are produced in MSRs from neutron reac-
tions with lithium in the fuel salt. FElemental tritium can diffuse
through metal walls such as heat-exchanger tubes at elevated temperatures,
thus providing a potential mechanism for the transport of tritium to the
reactor steam via the secondary coolant locp and the steam generator.
Recent experiments indicate that tritium is oxidized in the proposed MSR
secondary coolant, sodium fluoroborate, thus blocking transpert to the
Steam system.

In 1975 and 1976, tritium—additiocn experiments were conducted in an
engineering-scale coclant salt test loop. The results are given in a
report by Mays, Smith, and Engel.3 Briefly, the experiments showed that
the steady-state ratio of combined to elemental tritium in the coolant
salt was greater than 4000. A calculation applying this ratio to the
case of an operating 1000-MW(e) MSBR indicated that the release of
tritium to the steam system would be less than 400 GBg/d (10 Ci/day).

The conclusion of the study was that the release of tritium from an MSR
using sodium fluorcborate in the secondary coolant systfem could be readily

controlled to within Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidelines.

Engineering Development of Fuel Processing

By 1972, proof-of-principle experiments had been carried cut for
the various steps in the reference chemical preocess, but development and
demonstration of engineering-scale equipment were just getting under way.
The only large-scale processing demonstrated at that time was the batch
fluorination of the MSRE fuel salt and the recovery of the uranium on

NaF beds.
xii

In the period 1974—76, efforts were begun to develop items of equip-
ment which would be vital to the success of the metal-transfer process.
Some progress was made in the develepment of a salt-bismuth contactor,

a continuecus fluorinator, and a U¥g absorber for reconstituting the fuel
salt.” Because of the pregram closeout in 1976, this work could not be
continued long enough to culminate in engineering designs for the various
items of equipment. The status of this work can be summed up by stating
that, although no insurmountable obstacles were encountered, the major

portion of process engineering development remains to be done.

Other Areas of Development

 

The development status of areas other than those discussed above is
practically unchanged since the report1 of 1972, because no further R&D
was funded. These include development of reactor components, moderator
graphite, analytical methods, and controcl instrumentaticn. Exceptions
were a design study of a mclten-salt heat exchanger and some limited
work on the in-line monitoring of fuel salt.

In 1971, Foster-Wheeler Corp. was awarded a contract for a study of ¥
MSR steam-generator designs. The contract was suspended in 1973 and then
reinstated in 1974 for the purpose of completing the first task (in a
four—-part contract), which wag the design of a steam generator to meet
specifically the steam and feedwater conditions postulated for the MSBR
conceptual design. This task was successfully completed and a report
issued in December 1974.° A design was presented which, based on analy-~
sis, would meet gll the requirements for an MSR steam generator. How-
ever, the design was not experimentally verified because the MSR project
was terminated.

The 1972 status report1 described the use of an in-line electro-
chemical technique known as voltammetry to monitor the oxidation poten-
tial of the fuel salt. The technique has since been used to monitor
various corrosion test loops and other experiments and may also be used

2+

to monitor Cr in fuel salt, a good indicator cof the overall corrosion \

rate. Recently the technique has been used to measure the oxide ion in

 
 

 

xiidi

fuel salt. Oxide monitoring is very important in molten-salt fuel be-
cause an increase in oxide contamination could lead te precipitation of

uranium from the fuel as UQ».

SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DMSR

Recent reexamination of the MSR concept with special attention to
antiproliferation considerations has led to the identification of two
preliminary design concepts for MSRs that appear to have substantially
less proliferation sensitivity without incurring unacceptable perfor-
mance penalties. The designation DMSR {(for denatured molten-salt reac-
tor) has been applied to both of these concepts because each would be

2359 enriched to no more than 20% and would be

fueled initially with
cperated throughout its lifetime with denatured uranium.

The simpler of these DMSR concepts6 would completely eliminate on-
line chemical processing of the fuel salt for removal of fission products.
(Stripping of gaseous fission products would be retained, and some batch-
wise treatment to control oxide contamination probably would be required.)
This reactor would require rcutine additions of denatured 235y fuel, but
would not require replacement or removal of the in-plant inventory except
at the end of the 30-year plant lifetime. Adding an on-line chemical
processing facility to the 30-year, once-through reactor provides the
second DMSR design concept.’ With this addition, the conversion ratio
of the reactor would reach 1.0 (i.e., break-even breeding) so that fuel
additions could be eliminated and a given fuel charge could be used in-
definitely by transferring it to a new reactor plant at the decomission-
ing of the old unit.

The required chemical processing facility for a DMSR, shown as a pre-
liminary conceptual flowsheet in Fig. S.1, would be derived largely from
the MSBR but would contain some significant differences. In particular,
isolation and segregation of protactinium would be avoided, provisions

would be made to retain and use the plutonium produced from “*%U

, and a
special step would be added for removal of fission-product zirconium.

Thus, the development of on-line chemical processing for a DMSR would

require essentially all the technology development identified for the
MSBR with additions to accommodate these differences. However, since

the DMSR offers a no-processing option, a large fraction of the repro-
cessing development, along with its associated materials development,
could Be deferred or even eliminated. Such deferral might be expected

to reduce the cost (but probably not the time) for developing the first
DMSRs. To provide an overall perspective, this development plan includes
costs and schedules for developing the reprocessing capability in parallel
with the reactor.

The only other substantial difference (in terms of development needs)
between the MSBR and the proposed DMSR concepts is the reactor core design,
which is similar for both. Relaxing the breeding requirement and empha-
sizing proliferation resistance for the DMSR led to a core design with a
much lower power density to limit losses of protactinium, the 233y pre-
curser which is retained in the fuel salt of the DMSR. By reducing the
rate of fast-neutron damage to the core graphite, the low power density
also makes possible the design of a core in which the graphite need not
be replaced for the life of the reactor. A low power density also re-
duces the poison fraction associated with xenon in the core graphite and
thus there is less need for a low-permeability graphite. Although im-
provements in graphite life and permeability would be desirable, graph-
ite grades tested before 1972 would have the properties acceptable for
the DMSR core. Graphite development for the DMSR would not require (but
could include) much effort beyond the gspecification and testing of com-

mercial-source material.

POTENTIAL PLAN FOR DMSR DEVELOPMENT

A major product of the reactivated MSR program in 1974 was a de-

8 for the first several years of a development effort that

tailed plan
would ultimately lead to a commercial MSBR. Since the program authorized
in 1974 was restricted in scope, no attempt was made in that plan to
include costs and schedules for reactor plants beyond a limited treat-

ment of a proposed next-generation reactor — the Molten-Salt Test Reactor
XVvi

(MSTR). The primary function of the 1974 program plan was to define a
base technology program for the MSBR. Since the technology needs for a
DMSR closely parallel those of the MSBR, extensive use was made of the
1974 program plan in evolving the plan described below for DMSR develop-
ment,

To develop a reasonable perspective of the potential role of the “
DMSR in providing nuclear electric power, it is necessary to concep-
tualize a reactor development and construction schedule that goes beyond
the MSTR to at least the first commercial (or prototype) system and pos-
sibly on to the first of a series of "'standard" plants. The potential
schedule that was developed (Fig. S.2) has a reasonable basis for ful-
fiilment in the iight of the current state of MSR technoleogy. Four

generally parallel lines of effort would be pursued, including:

1. a base program of research and development (R&D):
2. a project to design, build, and operate an MSTR;
3. a project to study and eventually design and build a prototype,
or first commercial, reactor plant;
4. a project to design and build the first of possibly several ''stan-

dardized" plants. .

If adequate guidance is to be provided for an R&D program on MSRs,
it 1s essential that some design activity be started on the prototype
reactor and the MSTR at the beginning of the overall program. (These
initial design efforts may be relatively small, however.) A prototype
concept is required to define the systems tc be tested in the MSTR, and
the MSTR design is required to guide the initial phases of the R&D effort.

If such a program were started in FY 1980, the development and de-
sign activities could probably support authorization of a test reactor
in FY 1985, and such a reactor could probably be built by 1995. The
prototype commercial plant (supported by earlier design study) could be
authorized approximately on completion of the MSTR, and the authorization
for the first standard plant (if desired) could follow about 5 years ‘
later.

Although the technology development effort is shown as only a single

line on Fig. S.2, it represents a multifaceted effort in support of all

which is described in some detail in the body of this report, is summa-
rized in Table S.l1 alcong with estimated costs (in unescalated 1978
dollars). This tabulation includes the estimated costs for development

(shown as $147 million over 32 years) might be deferred or saved if
development of on~line fuel reprocessing were deferred or eliminated.
The work for the first 15 vears is shown on an annual basis, with most
of the effort in support of the MSTR. In general, the funds shown here
are consistent with the more detailed tabulations presented in the body
of this report. However, in a few areas the development plan indicates
that additional, undefined costs could be expected in some vears. For
purposes of this summary tabulation, funds were arbitrarily added in
those areas to cover reasonable extra costs. Costs after the first 15
years are much less certain and are shown as totals only. The estimated
cost of the total base program is approximately $700 million. The costs
of the reactor construction projects, about $600 million®* for the MSTR
and possibly $1470 million* for the prototype, bring the estimated total
program cost to about $2.8 billion. Since it is impossible to foresee
all needs and costs for a program, this is probably az minimum figure. A
contingency allowance should be added in a subsequent planning stage, as
well as allowances for cost increases due to inflation and escalation and

for any development contributions provided by industry.

ABSTRACT

Preliminary studies of existing and conceptual molten-
salt reactor (MSR) designs have led to the identification of
conceptual systems that are technologically attractive when
operated with denatured uranium as the principal fissile fuel.
These denatured MSRs would alsc have favorable resource-utili-
zation characteristics and substantial resistance to prolifera-
tion of weapons—usable nuclear materiais. This report presents
a summary cof the current status of technology and a discussion
of the major technical areas of a possible base program to de-
velop commercial denatured MSRs. The general areas treated are
(1) reactor design and development, (2) safety and safety re-
lated technology, (3) fuel-coolant behavior and fuel process-—
ing, and (4) reactor materials.

A substantial development effort could lead to authoriza-
tion for construction of a molten-salt test reactor about 5
vears after the start of the program and operation of the unit
about 10 years later. A prototype commercial denatured MSR
could be expected to begin operating 25 years from the start
of the program.

The postulated base program would extend over 32 years and
would cost about $700 million (1978 dellars, unescalated). Ad-
ditional costs to construct the MSTR — $600 million — and the
prototype commercial plant — $1470 miilion — weould bring the
total program cost to about $2.8 billion. Additional allow-
ances probably should be made to cover contingencies and in-
cidental technology areas not explicitly treated in this
preliminary review.

INTRODUCTION

A concept for a proliferation-resistant molten-salt reactor (MSR)

2 2 , i
33y and/or 2°°U has been evolved in response to

fueled with denatured
the interest in proliferation-resistant power reactors for worldwide
use. Briefly, such a reactor (1) must not provide a tempting or readily

available source of weapons material; (2) must have good economics and
fuel utilization and be competitive with reactors generally used or
planned for use in nuclear weapons states; and (3) must provide reason-
able energy independence for the nonnuclear weapons states that adopt
it (i.e., an assured source of fuel and/or reprocessing capability).

The proposed denatured molten-salt reactor (DMSR) concept, described

in general below, meets these requirements for the feollowing reasons:

1. the fissile material is denatured and/or confined within a contained
highly radicactive system;

2. the projected economic performance is competitive with other existing
or proposed reactor systems;

3. uranium resources would support at least five times the electrical
capacity in DMSRs as in light-water reactors {(LWRs) on a once-through
cycles

4, each DMSR, as a break-even breeder {conversion ratio = 1.0) with on-
line processing, once started would not need an ocutside source of
fisgile fuel indefinitely. (However, fertile material and the makeup
salt constituents, 'Li and beryllium fluorides, would have to he (

supplied.)

At least two other MSR concepts may be attractive for proliferation-
resistant systems. Their development will not be specifically considered
in this report; however, they differ only in detail from the DMSR, and
their development would require the solution of essentially the same prob-
lems. The two concepts are a partially self-sustaining DMSR without on-
line processing and a plutonium-thorium MSR designed to consume plutonium
and produce 2337 for use in denatured reactors.

The development of a DMSR without on-line processing would be a
relatively modest extension of current technolegy and could presumably
be accomplished in a shorter time and with considerably less development
effort than the proposed DMSR with processing. This version could not
be a break-even breeder but would still be a high-performance converter
with significantly improved fuel utilization over LWRs. Addition of an ¢
on—-line fission product processing facility at some later date would
transform the plant into a breeder. Preliminary results indicate that

a fuel charge could last for the entire 30-year life of the reactor, at
 

 

75% capacity factor, with only routine additions of 238y and/or denatured
2353, A more detailed characterization of this concept is in progress.

A plutonium-fueled MSR could be designed for use in a secure energy
center as a "fuel factory" to produce U for use in denatured reactors.
The outstanding advantage of an MSR for this application is the ability
to remove product 233y from the circulating fuel about as fast as it is
formed, so that very little is consumed by fission within the reactor it-
self. Cycle times of V10 days for uranium removal are considered feasi-
ble, compared with reprocessing times on the order of years for seclid-
fuel reactors. An MSR on this fuel cycle has been estimated to produce
750 kg of 233y per GW(e)evear at 0.75 plant factor; this is several times
more than that produced by any other type of thermal reactor and about
the same as expected from a plutonium-thorium liquid-metal fast breeder
reactor (LMFBR). However, the MSR would consume half again as much plu-
tonium or more. More quantitative fuel cycle data are not available at
this time.

The nominal DMSR with processing is based on the design for the
MSBR, as given in Refs. 2 and 3, with several important changes:

1. The start=-up fuel is 235y (or %°*U) denatured with *°°U rather
than fully enriched uranium. Sufficient 238y is fed along with thorium
to keep the fuel in the reactor denatured.

2. The process is altered so that protactinium and plutonium are

not isolated from the fuel galt. Protactinium, which decays to 233

U,
would otherwise be a source of undenatured fissile uranium.

3. The reactor core is larger with a lower power density to reduce
parasitic neutron absorptiong in protactinium as well as in fission prod-
ucts. The power density is reduced sufficiently that replacement of the
moderator graphite in the core is not required due to fast neutron damage

during the lifetime of the reactor.

This version of the DMSR is described in greater detail in Ref. 4.

The MSR research and development was conducted largely at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, but with assistance by subcontractors and others, in
a nearly continuous program for more than 25 years. The effort included

many large engineering experiments and the design, construction, and
I~

operation of two experimental reactors as well as many small-scale ex-
periments in all fields of pertinent nuclear and materials science. For
nearly 20 years, that effort was directed to M5Rs for the generation of
central station electricity, with the primary focus cn an MSBR breeding
2350 from 2°%Th in the thermal system. The large, varied, and impressive
accomplishments of that program, along with the additional development
requirements needed for demonstration of the MSBR, were described’
thoroughly as of mid-1972.* That material was updated, and a detailed
description (along with a preoposed schedule and costs) of remaining R&D
items was presented’ in 1974. The status of molten-salt technology as

of late 1974 and the additional needs of the MSBR, accordingly, are
documented fairly well, as is the base program of research and tech-
nology development required to fill those needs.

A large fraction of the technology developed for the MSBR is appli-
cable directly, or with a minimum of additional experimentation, to the
DMSR. Morecover, most of the additional technology needed for the MSBR
is also needed for the DMSR. However, the two reactors differ in some
important regards. Accordingly, the technology development required for
a DMSR is likely to invelve significant redirection from that anticipated
for the MSBR, particularly if the technclogy for on-line processing of
the fuel salt is developed in conjunction with the reactor technology.
In some areas (e.g., chemistry and chemical processing), this redirec-
tion probably would increase the requisite development effort, while in
others (e.g., safety technology and graphite development),'the required
effort could decrease.

An additional consideration is the fact that a small MSR technology
development effort was reestablished in mid-1974 and continued for about
two yvears. Although this effort was limited in scope, some significant
acéomplishments were achieved that also affected the current effort to
identify further technology needs.

To the extent that it was applicable, the 1974 program plan was

used as a basis for this review and projection of the technology needs

 

“The MSR program was closed out in early 1973 and remained in that
state for about one year.

 
 

 

and program plan for a DMSR. The present document is focused on the
major development areas, with the recognition that significant develop-
ment efforts could be required in other related areas. (Such ancillary
activities would add somewhat to the overall development cost but
probably would not appreciably affect the total schedule.) In a number
of areas where little or no technical effort has been expended since
1972 and where the perceived needs are substantially the same, the
tasks, schedules, and costs were transposed directly from the 1974

plan with only adjustments of the costs to account for inflation be-
tween 1974 and 1978. 1In other areas, minor adjustments were made to
account for changes in either the technology status® or the apparent
development needs.

The areas with the greatest potential for change from the 1974
program plan are those related to the chemical processing of the fuel
salt. If the once-=through version of the DMSR were developed, it might
be possible to defer development of the reductive-extraction—metal-
transfer process and thereby reduce the overall development cest for
the DMSR. However, because the availability of this process would
substantially improve the fuel utilization of a DMSR, the development
needs, schedules, and costs for it were included in this plan. Thus,
some latitude would exist in the implementation of the program plan.

The remainder of this report consists of four major parts, each
prepared by a single primary author, which deal with the following major
areas of base technology development: (1) reactor design and development,
(2) safety and licensing, (3) fuel-coolant behavior and fuel processing,
and (4) reactor materials. The parts (which contain up to four chapters)
should be regarded as units because of the high level of interdependence
among the subjects treated. However, the base program needs and their
projected costs and schedules are developed separately within each

chapter.

 

KLess than $10 million has been expended on MSR development since
1973, so the changes can have little effect on the overall program cost.

PART I. REACTOR DESIGN AND DBEVELOPMENT

H. ¥. Bauman

The objectives of the reactor design program are to first develop
a fairly complete conceptual design for a full-scale [1000-MW(e)} DMSR
in order to define more clearly the development problems that must be
addressed. Then, concurrent with the technology development, a molten-
salt test reactor (MSTR) would be designed, built, and operated to
demonstrate all aspects of the required DMSR technology on a smaller
scale. The scale of the MSTR would be decided as the program progressed.
The MSER conceptual design, which the DMSR would probably follow, pro-
posed four fuel heat-exchanger and steam-generator modules of 250-MW(e)
capacity each. The scale suggested for the MSTR would lie in the range
of 100-MW(e) power [with two 50-MW({e) steam-generator modules {i.e.,
1/5 scale)] to 250-MW(e) power with a single (i.e., full-scale) steam-—
generator module. The data from the component technology develcopment
program would be fed into the reactor design efforts, and the experi-
ence obtained in reactor construction and operation would, in turn, guide
continuing effort in component development. An MSTR mockup is proposed
which would permit integrated testing of most of the reactor components
before the MSTR itself is built. Finally, the construction of the proto-

type DMSR would influence the development of a standardized DMSR design.
 

 
 

 

1. REACTOR DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

There is considerable experience in the engineering design and neu-
tronic analysis of MSRs, through final design, construction, and opera-
tion. The molten—-salt reactor experiment (MSRE) has been through the
entire design process, and the ORNL reference concept MSBR' has reached
the stage of detailed conceptual design. In addition, the various reactor
components and subsystems received intensive development effort in the

technology development programs.

Status in 1977

At the time the development—status report2 was prepared (1972}, a
detailed conceptual design had been developed for the single-fiuid MSBR.
Furthermore, many alternative designs had been investigated, generally
in lesser detail; one of these, also pertinent to the DMSR, was a low-
power-density core design3 in which the core moderator graphite would
have an expected lifetime equal to the design life of the reactor.

In the area of reactor components and systems, the most important
items had been identified as salt pumps, the coolant system as a whole,
heat exchangers, the entire steam system, valves, control rods, fuel
storage, and gas handling.

Ixperience had been obtained in the MSRE in all the above areas ex-—
cept the steam system. However, new developments were proposed in sev-
eral areas, such as the use of godium fluoroborate as the secondary
coolant (rather than lithium~-beryllium fluoride), the use of mechanical
valves in addition to freeze wvalves®, and the addition of a fuel-salt

gas sparging system (rather than sparging of salt in the pump bowl).

Current Development Status

 

The reactor design and analysig effort since 1972 has been minimal.

However, a major study of tritium transport in molten-salt systems was

quently reheated to thaw the plug.
10

carried out in 197476, including experiments in a secondary-coolant—salt

test loop.

Large quantities of tritium are produced in MSRs from neutron reac-
tions with lithium in the fuel salt. Since elemental tritium can diffuse
through metal walls, such as heat-exchanger tubes, at elevated tempera-
tures, a potential path exists for the transport of tritium to the reac-
tor steam via the secondary coclant loop and the steam generator. Recent
experiments indicate that tritium is oxidized in the proposed MSR second-
ary coolant, sodium fluoroborate, thus blecking transport to the steam

System.

Tritium—addition experiments were conducted in an engineering-scale
ccolant-salt test facility. The results are given in a recent report by
Mays, Smith, and Engelf.l+ The experiments showed that the steady-state
ratio of combined to elemental tritium in the coolant salt was greater
than 4000. A calculation applying this ratio to the case of an operating
MSER indicated that the release of tritium to the steam system would be
less than 400 CBg/d (10 Ci/day). The conclusion of the study was that
the release of tritium from an MSR using sodium fluoroborate in the
secondary coolant system could be readily controlled within NRC guide-

lines.

In the area of component development, there was an effort to advance
the steam system development from the conceptual design proposed for the
M5BR toward hardware development. In 1971, Foster-Wheeler Corporation was
awarded a contract for a study of MSR steam-generator designs. The con-
tract was suspended in 1973 and then reinstated in 1974 to complete the
first task (in a four-task contract) — the conceptual design of a steam
generater to meet specifically the steam and feedwater conditions postu-
lated for the ORNL reference-design MSBR. This task was successfully
completed, and a report was issued in December 1974.° A design was pre-
sented which, based on analysis, would meet all the requirements for an
MSR steam generator. Because of the termination of the MSR project, the
design did not receive experimental verification or further analytical

study.

 
 

11

The coclant-salt test facility mentioned in connection with the
tritium experiments was operated in the period 1974—76 to obtain engi-
neering-scale experience with sodium fluoroborate, the proposed MSBR
secondary coolant. The loop was operated successfully for >5000 hr at
temperatures up to 540°C. The tests indicated that the engineering
characteristics of sodium fluoroborate would be suitable for MSR second-
ary coolant.

One of the important advantages of MSRs is that
fission product with an extremely high thermal-neutron cross section,
is not scluble in the fuel salt and can be rapidly removed from the
system. Fission-product 135%e is the single most important parasitic
absorber of neutrons in thermal reactors, and the high conversion ratio
of MSRs depends on efficient 135%e removal. The xenon has twe exits
from the fuel salt: by absorption into the pores of the core graphite,
where it would remain as a neutron poison, and by diffusion into the
fuel cover gas (helium), where it can be removed from the system. A
helium-stripping system is proposed for MSRs in which fine bubbles of
helium are introduced into the fuel salt to provide a sink for xenocn and
are subsequently separated from the salt to remove the xenon effectively.
Gas-bubble generators and strippers had been designed and were to be
tested in a circulating salt loop when the program was ended in 1973.
Although some additional work was done in the 1974—75 period, an integral

test of the stripping system was not completed.

DMSR Development Needs

 

A1l the design and development needs described for the MSBR in the
1974 program plan6 would alsc be required for the DMSR. However, some
aspects of the program should be emphasized for the DMSR.

The core design and analysis for both the DMSR and the MSTR require
particular attention to the effects of 238U, protactinium, and plutonium
on the system fissile inventory and conversion ratio. Another important
point is the core fast-flux distribution and its effect on the design
life of the moderator graphite. Some prelimipnary neutronic calculations

for a proposed DMSR design are given in Ref., 7. Since both thorium and
12

2380 are important neutron resonance absorbers, the lumping of fuel and
the degree of thermalization of the neutron spectrum in the reactor core
and reflector regions are important variables in the neutronic analysis.
An extensive reactor-analysis program would be required to select optimized
core designs for the MSTR and DMSR.

A very important problem for all molten-salt systems is the control
of the reactor power and the temperatures in the fuel salt, the coolant
salt, and the steam generators and the management of thermal cycles and
thermal stresses in all parts of the reactor system. Although consid-
erable experience in MSR thermal problems was obtained in the operation
of the MSRE, the addition of a steam system and turbine-generator to
the next generation of MSRs leads to considerably more complex interac-
tions between the various components of the reactor systems. The analy-
sis of thermal-hydraulic dynamic behavior of the proposed reactor systems
will require the development of suitable computer models. Some prelimi-
nary analysis along these lines had been done for the MSBR, but a major
extension of this program would be required for the DMSR.

The reactor technology effort encompasses the development of all
the major components required in the reactor system. For the most part,
highly specialized components such as the vessels and contactors for
chemical processing and specific instrument items would be covered
within the development programs for the associated technologies. How-
ever, some of the more general items {e.g., small salt pumps, valves,
seals) might be included in the overall develepment program for reactor
components. Such items probably would not greatly affect the total
Program cost.

A vital part of the development program for reactor components is
the design of intermediate- and full-scale salt pumps. The pump preferred
for molten-salt service is a vertical-shaft, centrifugal sump pump such
as was used successfully in the MSRE and cother test facilities. The
drive shaft for this type pump extends through the reactor shielding so
that the motor is relatively accessible and is in a low-radiation field.
The scaleup of these pumps is proposed to proceed by extending the line
of past development with as little change in conceptual design as possi-

ble. The nominal capacity of the MSRE pumps was 0.08 m°/s (1200 gpm) ;

 
 

 

13

the pumps proposed for the MSBR, and required for any type of full-scale
MSR, would be larger by a factor of about 20. The line of development
may include an intermediate-size pump rated at about 0.3 m’/sec (5000 gpm).

The design of mechanical vaives for melten-salt service and the use
of freeze valves in large systems are alsc very important developments.
The MSRE was operated entirely without mechanical valves; freeze valves
were used where flow shutoff was required. Freeze valves have been used
in pipe sizes up te 1 1/2 in. IPS and have been found to be reliable,
zero-leakage devices so long as the integrity of the pipe itself is
maintained.

The disadvantages of freeze valves are that (1) flow in a line must
be stopped before a plug can be frozen, (2) they open and close relatively
slowly, and (3) they cannot be used for throttling. Therefore, mechanical-
type salt valves are considered essential to the operation of large MSRs.
Experience with bellows-sealed mechanical valves in molten-salt experi-
mental facilities has been limited. The main development problems are
finding materials that will close tightly without binding in molten salt
and developing reliable zero-leakage seals. Freeze valves, perhaps in-
tegral with mechanical valves, may also be developed for the larger
systems.,

Reactor control rods have been included in MSR designs, although
control rods serve a limited purpose in fluid~fueled reactors. The
reactivity of the core is controlled mainly by the composition of the
fuel and by changes in the density of the fuel with temperature. The
ultimate shutdown of the reactor is achieved by draining the fluid fuel
to storage tanks. Control rods are required for short-term fine control
of the temperature and reactivity of the core, as well as for rapid
shutdown; so the design of control rods for melten-salt service is an
important development need.

The fuel drain and storage system is another vital development. The
fuel storage system must have the capability of removing afterheat to
the ultimate heat sink in the event that the reactor becomes inoperable
or is shut down for maintenance. A drain tank with a natural-convection
NaK cooling system was proposed for the MSBR. Although this system ap-

pears workable, all aspects of fuel contaimment under normal and accident
14

conditions deserve further attention. Because of the relatively low power
density in the fiuid fuel (compared to solid fuel), it is likely that an
MSR could he develecped for which a containment melt-through accident

would not be considered credible.

An MSTR mock-up is proposed which would permit integrated testing
of the reactor components under zero-power conditions. The mock-up
would permit solving ot layout and remote maintenance problems before
the reactor was built.

Possible schedules for the first 15 years of the DMSR develiopment
program are shown for the reactor design and analysis work in Table 1.1
and for the technology development work in Table 1.2Z.

Operating fund requirements for this peried for reactor design and
analysis are given in Table 1.3, and operating and capital fund require-

ments for technology development are given in Tables 1.4 and 1.5.

PART TI. SAFETY AND SAFETY-RELATED TECHNOLOGY

J. F. Dearing

Substantial differences between the safety considerations for solid-
fueled nuclear reactors and those for liquid-fueled systems, such as the
MSR, have long been recognized. Consequently, safety studies have been
included in all MSR design and technology development pregrams. How-
ever, comprehensive studies of the safety attributes of commercial-scale
MSRs have been hampered by the lack of a reasonably complete conceptual
design for a large MSR. Thus the area of MSR safety has been subjected
to a great deal of generalization, with very little detailed system-spe-
cific analysis of the type required to define fully the safety charac—
teristics and questions of the MSR concept. Tt is presumed that any
future MSR development program would include significant effort in the
area of safety technology, along with sufficient reactor design effort

to support it adequately.

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

23

2. REACTOR SAFETY AND LICENSING

The MSR concept poses problems in safety and licensing that are
significantly different from those encountered in the present-day gen-
eration of solid-fueled reactors. The successful cperation of the MSRE
and the safety studies of the MSBR concept, however, have already estab-
lished a firm basis for identifying and solving these problems. A com-
prehensive summary of safety and safety-related technology status and
development needs of the MSBR as of 1972 is included in Ref. 1. An up-
date as of 1974 that presents a detailed plan for future work is included
in Ref. 2. Although many of the safety analyses contained in these two
documents will have to be carefully evaluated for applicability to the
DMSR (especially reactor core neutronics and thermal hydraulics), the
overall assessment of technoleogical status and future development needs

is expected to be applicable.

Status and Development Needs

 

Safety

The main feature of the DMSR which sets it apart from the other
solid fuel reactor types is that the nuclear fuel is in fluid form (mecl-
ten fluoride salt) and is circulated throughout the primary coolant sys-
tem, becoming critical only in the graphite-moderated core. The possible
problems and engineered safety features associated with this type of
reactor will be quite different from those of the present day LWR and
LMFBR designs. In the DMSR, the primary system coolant serves the dual
role of being the medium in which heat i1s generated within the reactor
core and the medium which transfers heat from the core to the primary
heat exchangers. Thus the entire primary system will be subjected to
both high temperatures (700°C at core exit) and high levels of radiation
by a fluid containing most of the daughter products of the fission pro-
cess. Because of the low fuel salt vapor pressure, however, the primary
system design pressure will be low, as in an IMFBR. The entire primary
coolant system is analogous, in terms of level of confinement, to the

cladding in a solid fuel reactor. Although much larger, it will not be
24

subjected to the rapid thermal transients (with melting) associated with
LWR and LMFBR accident scenarios. Two additional levels of confinement
will be provided in the DMSR, in accordance with present practice. The
problem of develcoping a primary coolant system which will be reliable,
maintainable (under remote conditicns), inspectable, and structurally
scund over the plant’s 30-year lifetime will probably be the key factor
in demonstrating ultimate safety and licensability.

It ig the breach of the primary coolant system boundary, resulting
in a large spill of highly radicactive salt into the primary containment,
which will probably provide the design basis accident. The analogous
level of occurrence in a solid fuel reactor would be major cladding fail-
ure. Possible initiators of this accident include pipe failure, missiles,
and pressure or temperature transients in the primary coolant system.
Failure of the boundary between the primary and secondary salt in the
IHX could be especially damaging. In the event of a salt spill, a possi-
bly redundant system of drains would be activated to channel the salt to
the cooled drain tank. The primary system containment, defined as the
set of hermetically sealed, concrete-shielded equipment cells, would
probably not be threatened by such a spill, but cleanup operations would
be difficult.

A unique safety feature of the DMSR is that, under accident shutdown
conditions, the fuel material would be led to the "ECCS" (represented by
drain tank cooling), rather than vice versa. The reactor and containment
must be designed so that the decay heated fuel salt reaches the drain
tank under any credible accident conditions. In any case, the decay
heat is associated with a very large mass of fuel salt, so that melt
through, or "CHINA SYNDOME," does not appear to be a problem.

The safety philosophy for accidents involving the reactor core is
very different for fluid-fueled reactors than for solid-fueled ones be-
cause the heat source is {(mainly) in the coolant and not in a solid,
which requires continuous cooling to avoid melting. An LMFBR, for ex-
ample, has a tremendous amount of stored energy in the fuel pins which
much be removed under any accident conditions. Dryout, which leads to
almost immediate meltdewn in an IMFBR, would not be nearly as severe in
the DMSR because the heat source would be removed along with the cooling

capability.

 

 
 

 

25

Under normal conditions, the reactor power is stable to all fre-
quecies of oscillation, because the negative prompt component of the
temperature coefficient of reactivity dominates the poesitive delayed
component. There appear to be no safety problems in the area of reac-
tivity control. Because the fuel salt will be channeled to the cooled
drain tank under many off-normal conditions, that tank probably must
have redundant systems for decay heat removal. There is no credible
means for achieving recriticality once the fuel salt hag left the

graphite~moderated core.

Licensing

Although two experimental MSRs have been built and operated in the
United States under government ownership, none has ever been subjected
to formal licensing or even detailed review by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission {(NRC}. As a consequence, the question of licensability of
MSRs remains largely open; the NRC has not yet identified major licens-
ing issues, and the concept has not been considered by various public-
interest organizations who are often involved in nuclear-plant licensing
procedures. Furthermore, the licensing experience of solid-fueled
reactors can be used as only a general guide because of significant
fundamental differences between those systems and MSRs. Presumably
MSRs would be required to comply with the intent, rather than the letter,
of NRC requirements, particularly where methods of compliance are concept-
specific.

Before any MSR ig licensed, it probably will be necessary to define
a complete new spectrum of potential transients and accidents, along
with their applicable initiating events, to be treated in safety analysis
reports. Some of the more important safety-significant events for an
MSR were mentioned earlier, but even routine operatiocnal events may have
a different order of importance for this reactor concept. For example,
mcderate reactor power disturbances would not be very important because
one of the principal consequences, fuel cladding failure, is a nonevent
in an MSR. However, a small leak of reactor coolant would be an important

event because of the high level of radicactivity in the MSR coolant. The
26

previous examples of significant differences between MSRs and other 1i-
censed reactors illustrate why a substantial design and analysis effort
would be required first. The reasons are (1) to establish licensing
criteria for MSRs in general and a DMSR in particular and (2) to evaluate

MSR licensability in relation to that of other reactor types.

Estimates of Scheduling and Costs

 

A detailed plan for developing the technology necessary to ensure
the safe operation of the MSBR under normal conditions and safe shutdown
under accident conditions is presented in Ref. 2. There are no signifi-
cant differences between the MSBR and DSMR concepts in terms of necessary
safety and safety-related technology development; thus the program sched-
ule and operating fund requirements for the MSBR safety technology de-
velopment program found in Ref. 2 will serve as a first estimate of the
requirements for a DMSR program. Table 2.1 shows the operating fund
requirements (in 1978 dollars) for a safety techneclogy development program

beginning in 1980. ‘

PART TIf. FUEL-COOLANT BEHAVIOR AND FUEL PROCESSING

W. R. Grimes

The development effort on MSRs prior to 1972 produced a large body
of technical information related to the behavior of potential fuel and
coolant salts and to the fuel processing concept. The primary focus
for most of this development was the MSBR, but much of the resultant
technology is also applicable to the DMSR. However, the two reactor
concepts differ in important regards, and some of the chemistry and ana-
lytical chemistry programs thought to be virtually complete for the MSBR
will require some additional effort for the DMSR. Differences in fuel
processing, necessitated by both the differing fuels and ﬁhe differing
philosophies, will require some additional R&D (and possibly a different
unit process in one area) as well as the engineering demonstration of
the processing steps individually and in integrated operation which the
MSBR also required.

The MSBR program continued after mid-=1974, and the subsequent two
years brought a variety of findings in the behavior of fuel and coolant
salts, in reprocessing and fuel reconstitution, and in fuel-material
interactions. All the findings, of course, contribute changes, some of
which are significant to the required development effort. These three
general topics, along with the relevant analytical chemistry, are treated
here.

The folleowing discussion attempts to briefly define the areas in
which DMSR technology requirements differ substantially from those for
the MSBR; in particular, differences in the reactors or recent advances
in molten-salt technology that require or permit significant changes in
the 1974 MSBR program plan are discussed. The general format for dis-
cussion of the four broad areas of technology includes (1} the key dif-
ferences between the MSBR and the DMSR; (2) post-1974 advances in MSBR
technology; (3) the status of molten-salt technoclogy, with special em-
phasis on additional requirements for demonstration of the DMSR; and (4)
estimates of scheduling and funding requirements of the overall DMSR

program, drawn from the 1974 MSER program plan.

3. FUE]L AND COOLANT CHEMISTRY

Because both the fuel (primary coolant) and the coolant (secondary
coolant) in an MSR are complex fluids, they are subject to a wide variety
of chemical effects and interactions that have a vital influence on
the overall behavior of the reactor system in which they are used.
Therefore, a detailed understanding of the chemical behavior of these
fluids under both normal and off-normal conditions is essential to the
successful development of the MSR concept. This chapter discusses that

chemical behavior as it applies specifically to the DMSR.

Key Differences in Reactor Concepts

 

Fuel proposed for the MSBR contained thorium (as ThF4)} as the fer-
tile material. The fissile material for the initial loading was highly
enriched 2%°U (essentially as UF4).* At equilibrium, the reactor (whose
fuel was to be continuously processed on a 10-day cycle to remove fission
233

products and to isclate 233pa for decay to U outside the neutron flux)

operated with 2331 45 the fizsile material. Because little *°°U was pres—
ent and the small quantity of plutonium was removed with the protactinium
and was not returned to the circuit, the amount of transuranium elements
in the system was trivial. Fission-product zirconium (present in the
fuel as ZrFy) was kept to a very low concentration since it was removed
with the 2°%Pa and was not returned to the fuel. The fission process in
UFy appears to be inherently slightly oxidizing (and, accordingly, cor-
rosive) to nickel-based alloys such as Hastelloy N; the total valence of
fission-product cations in the melt in equilibrium with Hastelloy N is
slightly less than four per fission event. This tendency toward enhanced
corrosion as a direct consequence of fission was contreclled in the MSRE*

and was to be controlled in the MSBR'»? by keeping a small fraction (ca.

1%) of the uranium present as UFs.

g . . 1
However, PuF3 was considered and given considerable study.

+Benefits from a somewhat higher proportion of UFs; were recognized,
but earlier they appeared to be marginal. Recent work (to be described)
suggests strongly that a higher fraction of UF3 will be very desirable.
In contrast to the MSBR (and since uranium is recoverable with
relative ease by fluorination), the DMSR must never contain fuel in
which the *%°U and 2°*°U are at weapons—usable concentrations; the over-
all uranium concentration must be markedly higher for DMSR fuel since a
large quantity of 2387 must always be present. The reactor is, accord-
ingly, like an LWR — a producer and cconsumer of plutonium.* Isolation

2330 must obviously be

of ?3%Pa outside the reactor for decay to pure
abandoned. Fission-product removal from the fuel necessitates prior re-
moval of protactinium and plutonium (as well as uranium), but the DMSR
is obviously constrained to reintroduce these materials directly to the
reactor. As a consequence, the fuel will contain an appreciable concen-
tration of transuranium isotopes. The constraint also eliminates the
easy removal of fission-product zirconium conceived for the MSBR, and,
unless some invention is realized, the DMSR must accept a low but appre-
ciable concentration of ZrF, in the fuel. Each of the differences above,
of course, implies a nontrivial (though relatively small) change in the
fuel chemistry.% A larger change in fuel chemistry {(and in R&D needs)
would result from a decision to operate the reactor with 5 to 107 of
the uranium present as UF3. A discussion of this issuec 1s presented
in a subsequent section.

Tt should be noted, even in a section such as this, that chemical
behavior and associated R&D needs of the fuels for the MSBR and DMSR

show far more similarities than differences.

Post-1974 Technology Advances

 

The appearance of numerous shallow cracks when Hastelloy N specimens
were tensile tested after exposure to the fuel was a key cbservation from
the otherwise very successful four-year operation of the MSRE. This

cracking behavior, which caused no particular problems in the MSRE but

which would probably prove intolerable upon extrapolation to an MSBR or
DMSR, was shown to be a consequence of fission-product tellurium.® At
the redox potential (set essentially by the ratio of UF3; to UF4)} in an
MSRE, fission-product tellurium would exist primarily as elemental tel-
lurium and could react with the alloy. Post=1974 R&D served to confirm
this hypothesis, and progress was made in understanding some details of
the behavior of telliurium in molten fuel mixtures *":° and in defining%
alloys {including slight modifications of Hastelloy N) far more resistant
to tellurium embrittlement.® Moreover, a considerable experimental pro-
gram has shown that if the fuel has a sufficiently high ratio of UF: to
UFy (0.02 to 0.1), the impact of added tellurium on ordinary Hastelloy N

is very markedly diminished. ®s”’

It seems clear that at high UF;/UF,
ratios, tellurium is constrained to exist in the fuel as Te?™ (and almost
certainly in solution) and is unable to mount an appreciable attack on
the alloy. This cbservation appears to open many possibilities and may
amount to a real breakthrough.

A careful remeasurement as a function of temperature and of solvent

composition of the equilibrium,*

has given a reasonable confirmation of the previous measurements  in LiF-
BeFs (66-34 mole %) and has extended them to other LiF-Bel; mixtures and
to LiF-BeF;~ThF, (72-16-12 mele 7%). Stability of UF3; relative to UFu,
increases rapidly with temperature and with a decrease in the free fluo-
ride ion concentration of the fuel solvent.

Adeguate retention of tritium that is generated within the fuel salt
has been known to be a problem for MSRs for vears. Two post-1974 devel-

11

opments at ORNL' %> promise at least a major alleviation of the problem.

First, a series of experiments in which tritium was added to the NaF-NaBF, .
coolant salt in the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility {(CSTF)} showed that
>907% of the tritium added under steady-state conditions appeared in the
off-gas system in chemically combined (water-scluble) form and that 987
of the added tritium was removed through the off-gas system.10 These
data suggest that the fluoroborate coolant system of an MSBR (or DMSR)
might well diminish the leakage of tritium to the reactor steam system

to acceptable limits. Continued study11 shows that the oxide film formed
by the reaction of steam with steam—generator materials can greatly im-
pede the permeation of the metal by tritium. Even at a steam pressure

of 1 atm, where the oxidation rate is still clearly dependent on rates
of diffusion from the bulk alloy through the oxide coating, tritium per-

meation is impeded by factors of nearly 500 after 150 days of exposure.®

Status of Fuel and Coolant Chemistry

 

Fuel chemistry

Choice of components and composition. For an MSBR, where excellent

 

neutron economy is an abseclute requirement, acceptable fuel components
are few. The careful considerations and the detailed experimentation
over a pericd of many years that led to the choice of fuel constituents

?  There is no doubt

and composition have been completely described. '’
that (1) the major constituents of the fuel salt for an MSBR must be
LiF, BeF2, ThFy, and UF4, with a composition of ~71.7, 16, 12, and C.3,
respectively, and that (2) highly enriched "LiF and 2°°UF, are required.
For a DMSR the requirement for excellent neutron economy might seem
to be capable of slight relaxation. However, such a reactor must have
a reasonably high concentration of thorium and must contain more uranium
than the MSBR. There can be no reasonable doubt that the anion must be
F-, and the possibility that one can find better diluent fluorides than

35

initial fuel loading for a DMSR is, of course, not yet known precisely.
However, it appears likely that the optimum mixture will fall near (in
mole %) 72 LiF, 16 BeFy, and 12 heavy-metal fluorides, with slightly
less than 10.5 mole % ThFy and slightly more than 1.5 mole % UF, and UF;.
As a consequence, much that has been learned about the MSBR fuel compo-
sition is directly applicable to the DMSR. Knowledge of the behavior of
MSBR fuel, although not complete, can fairly be said to be extensive

and detailed.!??%»1?

As an additional consequence, the DMSR (like the MSBR) will require
a large-scale and reasonably economic source of lithium enriched to near
99,99% ’Li. No such enrichment facility is operating in the United States
today, but the technology is well known and relatively large-scale separa-

tion has been practiced in the past.

Fluoride phase behavior. Phase equilibria among the pertinent MSER

 

and DMSR fluorides have been studied in detail, and the equilibrium dia-
grams, although relatively complex, are well understood. Because these
reactors need a ThIFFy concentration much higher than that cof UF4, the
phase behavior of the fuel is dictated by that of the LiF-BeF,-ThFy

shown in Fig. 3.1. This system shows a single ternary eu-

system is complicated by the fact that the compound 3LiF+ThF, can incor-
porate Re?+ ions in both interstitial and substitutional sites to form
solid solutions whose compositional extremes are represented by the
shaded triangular region near that compound. Inspection of the phase

diagraml’12

reveals that a considerable range of compositions with more
than 10 mole 7 ThFy will be completely molten at or below 500°C. The
maximum ThFs concentration available at this liquidus temperature is
just above 14 mcle 7. As expected from the general similarity of ThFy
and UFy, substitution of a moderate quantity of UFy for ThFy scarcely

changes the phase behavior.

Operation of the DMSR will result in production of plutenium and of
smaller quantities of other transuranium isotopes. It seems likely that
at equilibirum the concentration of plutonium will be near 0.05 mole %,

while Np, Am, Cm, Cf, and Bk might together total an additional 0.025

about 207 higher. In beth studies, more than one method was used for

crepancy is available. It is clear, however, that even the lower value

The trivalent lanthanides and actinides are known to form solid
solutions so that, in effect, all the rare-earth trifluorides and the
actinide trifluorides act essentially as a single element. Should it

of all trifluorides (perhaps 0.3 mole %) might exceed this combined
sclubility at a temperature somewhat below the reactor inlet temperature.
A few experiments® must be performed to check this slight possibility.

The result is that with 100 ppm protactinium and 30 ppm oxide present,

the U’1/U"" ratio must be kept above about 107™° if inadvertent precipita-
tion of Pa205 is to be avoided. Such oxidizing conditions are easy to
avoid in practice. There is also a dependence on the udt/utt ratio of

the oxide concentration at which Pu0; precipitation cccurs. However,

even stronger oxidizing conditions (U3+/Uq+ < 10™%) are required to pre-
cipitate PuOp from fuel for MSBRs or DMSRs.

The solubility of the oxides of neptunium, americium, or curium has
not been examined. Some attenticn to this problem will be required, but
it is not obvious that such studies have a high priority.

It is clear that the DMSR fuel must be protected from oxide contami-
nation to avoid inadvertent precipitation. Because of the low oxide
tolerance, this will require some care, but the successful operation of
the MSRE over a 3-year period lends cenfidence that oxide contaminaticn
of the fuel system can be kept to adequately low levels. This confidence,
when added to the prospect that the DMSR fuel will be reprocessed {(and
its oxide level reduced by fluorinaticn of the uranium) on a continuous
basis, suggests very strongly that problems with oxide contamination can
be avoided.

Physical properties. Most of the physical properties of LiF-BeFs;-

 

ThFy, (72-16-12 mole %);'C are known with reasonable accuracy, although
several have been defined by interpolation from measurements on slightly
different compositions.

The liquidus temperature is well known, and density and viscosity

2,24

are accurate to 13 and +107, resgpectively. The heat capacity has

been derived from drop calorimetry;25 on the basis of this determination

and with a simple model for predicting heat capacity of molten fluorides,

one can reliably predict the heat capacity of the DMSR mixture.

Most physical properties will be trivially affected by variations
among the heavv-metal cencentrations so long as the heavy-metal content
remains at 12 mole %.

 
 

 

39

Thermal conductivity is the key property for predicting heat-transfer
coefficients of molten fluorides. Measurements that are probably accurate
to *10 to 15% have been obtained for LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67.5-20-12-0.5
mole %).%*® TFor future design considerations it will be helpful to de-
velop an apparatus to measure thermal conductivities of fluorides with
greater accuracy and to determine the conductivity of the fuel salt com-
position.

The surface physical properties (surface tension and interfacial
tension between salt and graphite) are only qualitatively known. Such
properties are important in assessing wetting behavior and in determining
the degree of salt penetration into graphite.

The wvapor pressure, as yet unmeasured, has been extrapolated from
measurements of LiF-BeF,; and LiF-UFy mixtures. At the highest normail
operating temperature, 704°C, the estimated vapor pressure is V1.3 Pa
(107% torr). The vapor composition has not been measured, but the vapor
would be considerably enriched in BeF; and perhaps in ThF,. Vapor pres-
sure and vapor composition are not high-priority measurements. However,
more than qualitative estimates of these properties will be required in
future calculations of the amount and composition of salt that is trans-
ported by gas streams used to cool portions of the off-gas system in the
primary circuit. A transpiration experiment would provide firm values
of vapor composition and improved values of vapor pressure. Manometric
measurements combined with mass-spectrographic determination would pro-

vide more precise information on both.

Fission-product chemistry. Much attention was given to behavior of

 

the fission products in the MSRE?’ because of their effect on reactor
operation and performance, afterheat, and reactor maintenance. More
experimentation will clearly be required in future DMSR (or MSBR) develop-
ment.

was considered a remote possibiiity for the MSBR.? Such stripping seems
a most unlikely need for the DMSR; if it were necessary, it woeuld preclude
operation at high UF3;/UF, ratios.

The rare earths and other stable soluble fluorides (e.g., Zr, Ce,
Sr, Cs, Y, Ba, and Rb) are all expected to be found principally in the
fuel salt* and can be removed by the fuel processing operation.T The
chemical behavior of these fission products is fairly well understood
and, like the noble-gas behavior, can be predicted confidently for
operating DMSRs. *7

has been berne out in MSRE operations
According to available thermodynamic data, they are expected to appear
in a reduced form at UF3/UF, ratios greater than 1077, However, in the :
reduced and presumed metallic state, these fission products can disperse
via many mechanisms.

Analyses of MSRE salt samples for five noble-metal nuclides (°7Mo,
1DgRu, IOERug and '?°713%Te) showed that the fuel salt contained up to
a few tens of percent of the nominal calculated inventory. All these
species have volatile high-valence fluorides that could form under suf-
ficiently oxidizing conditions. On the basis of thermodynamic comnsid-
erations and a correlation of their behavior with that of lllAg, for
which no stable fluoride exists under fuel-salt conditions, it has been
tentatively concluded that they are metallic species that occur as finely

divided particles suspended in the salt.

 

P

Some of these have noble~gas precursors; a fraction of these will
escape from the fuel and appear in the off-gas system.

'See Chapter 6.

And several other species of lower yield.

The noble-metal fission products were also found deposited on graphite
and Hastelloy N specimens (on surveillance specimens as well as on post-
operation specimens). However, their distribution on both sets of speci-
mens varied widely and allowed only very tenuocus conclusions to be drawn.
It was evident from these studies that net deposition was generally more
intense on metal than on graphite, and deposition on the metal was more
intense under turbulent flow.

235y operation of the

Gas samples taken from the pump bowl during
MSRE indicated that substantial concentrations of noble metals were pres-
ent in the gas phase, but improved sampling techniques (used during

h 233UF4) showed that previous samples had

operation of the reactor wit
been contaminated by salt mist and that only a small fraction of the

noble-metal fission products escape to the cover gas.

0Of the noble metals, nicbium is the most susceptible to oxidation:
it was found appreciably in salt samples at the start of the 233y MSRE

operation because of the low initial U3+/U“+

ratio. It could be made
to disappear by lowering the redox potential of the fuel,1 but it sub-
sequently reappeared in the salt several times for reasons that were not
always explainable. The %°Nb data did not correlate with the Mo-Ru-Te
data mentioned previously, nor was there any observable correlation of

niobium behavior with amounts found in gas samples.

The actual state of these noble-metal fission products is important
to the effectiveness of MSBR operations. 1If the products exist as metals
and if they plate out on the Hastelloy-N portions of the reactor, they
will be of little consequence as poisons; however, they can be of im-
portance in determining the level of fission-product afterheat after
reactor shutdown and will complicate maintenance operations and post-—
operation decontamination. They will contribute to neutron poisoning
if they form carbides or adhere in some other way to the graphite modera-
tor;* however, examination of the MSRE graphite moderator indicated that

the extent of such adherence was limited.!s?s?7

 

Niobium is the only element of this series with a carbide that is
thermodynamically stable in this temperature range. It showed the largest
tendency to associate with the moderator graphite.
Operation with a UF3/UFy, ratio near 0.1 will apparently change the
behavior of those noble metals capable of reduction to an anionic state.

57 and may be safely presumed

This seems certain to include tellurium
to include selenium. Antimony may exist (and may be dissolved) as Sb’~
in such melts, and other of the noble-metal fission products may be dis-
solved. If so, they, along with the tellurium and selenium, would — as
was not expected for the MSBR — be transported to the fuel processing
circuit, where their removal should be possible. Should a decision be

made to operate with strongly reduced fuel, some study of such possi-

bilities will be necessary.

Clearly, most of the future fiésionwproduct chemical research should
be directed toward increasing cur understanding of noble-metal—fission-
product behavior to a level comparable to that of the other fission prod-
ucts., Factors of importance to future reactors include the redox poten-
tial of the system,* the possible agglomeration of metals onto gas and
bubble interfaces in the absence of colloidal (metallic, graphite, oxide,
etc.) particles, the deposition of noble metals onto colloidal particles,

and the deposition and resuspension of particles bearing noble metals.

Tritium behavior. A 1000-MW(e) MSBR has been estimated®® to produce

 

about 2420 Ci (v0.25 g) of °H per day; the DMSR must accordingly be ex-
pected to generate H at this rate. Since metals at high temperatures

are permeable to the isctopes of hydrogen, the pathways for tritium flow
from the reactor to the environment are numerous. Although many of the
pathways do not present serious difficulty,+ the flow to the steam genera-
tor, if not inhibited, could result in tritium contamination of the steam
system and release of tritium to the environment via blowdown and leakage

to the condenser ceolant.

As noted above (and described in more detail in a subsequent sec-
tion), the NaF-NaBF, coclant appears to be the major defense against *H

Attempts have been made

solubilities were measured, but the solubility is not precisely known.
Further study of the solubility relationships is needed, and measurements
of diffusivity in the fuel would alsoc be valuable. It seems likely that
an efficient sparging system (as for '*°Xe removal)} will strip a consid-
erable fraction of the °Hz to the reactor off-gas system, where it could

be coliected for disposal.

Basic studies of molten fluorides. A comprehensive knowledge of

 

the formation free energies (AGf) of solutes in molten Li»;BeF., has been
gained over the year533 from measurements of heterogeneous equilibria
involving various gases (e.g., BF or H»0) and solids (e.g., metals or
oxides). The list of dissolved components for which formation free
energies have been estimated includes LiF, Be¥,, Th¥,, several rare-
earth trifluorides, Zr¥,, UFs3, UFy4, PaFy, PaFs, PuF;, CrF,, FeF,, NiFy,
NbFy, NbFs, MoF3, HF, BeO, BeS, Be(OH),, and Bel,. Some of these AGf
values, however, are presently insufficiently accurate for the needs of
the MSBR and DMSR programs (e.g., those for PaFs, PaFs, ThF,, MoFj, NbFy,
and NbFs) and additional equilibrium measurements involving these solutes
are needed. Moreover, there is a need for the AGf values of certain other
fission-product compounds such as the lower fluorides of technetium and
ruthenium and various dissclved compounds of tellurium. A more urgent
need is an increased knowledge of how activity coefficients (which have
been defined as unity in Li»BeFy) vary as the melt composition changes.

Such knowledge is required to predict how the numerous chemical equilibrium
bty

constants that may be derived from AGf values in LioBeFy will change as

the melt composition is changed to that of a DMSR fuel.

Coolant chemistry

 

It has never appeared feasible to raise steam directly from the
fuel (primary) heat exchanger; accordingly, a secondary ccolant must be
provided to link the fuel circuit to the steam generator. The demands
imposed upon this coolant fluid differ in obvicus ways from those imposed
upon the fuel system. Radiation intensities will be markedly less in the
coolant system, and the consequences of uranium fission will be absent.
However, the coolant salt must be compatible with the construction metals
that are also compatible with the fuel and the steam; it must not undergo
violent reactions with fuel or steam should leaks develop in either cir-
cuit. The coolant should be inexpensive, it must possess good heat trans-
fer properties, and it must melt at temperatures suitable for steam cycle
start-up. An ideal coclant would consist of compounds that are tolerable
in the fuel or are easy to separate from the valuable fuel mixture should
the fluids mix as a consequence of a leak.

Choice of coolant compesition. Many types of coolant materials

 

were carefully considered before the choice was made. The coclant which
served admirably in the MSRE, "Li,BeF,, was rejected for the MSBR be-
cause of economics and because its liquidus temperature is higher than
desirable. No substitute with ideal characteristics was found. After
consideration of molten metals and molten chloride and molten flucoride
mixtures, the best material overall appeared to be a mixture of sodium
fluoride and sodium fluoroborate.’ These compounds are readily avail-
able and inexpensive and appear to be sufficiently stable in the radia-
tion field within the primary heat exchanger. The mixture of NaF-NaBFy
with 8 mole % NaF melts at the acceptably low temperature of 385°C (725°F),
and its physical properties seem adequate for its service as a heat trans-
fer agent. These compounds are not ideally compatible with either steam
or the MSBR fuel, but the reacticns are neither violent nor even particu-
larly energetic.

The fact that fluoroborates show an appreciable equilibrium pressure

of gaseous BF3 at elevated temperatures presents minor difficulties. The

 
 

 

BF3 pressures are moderate; they may be calculated from

log P = 11.149 — 5920/T ,

when pressure is in pascals and temperature is in kelvin [yielding 23
kPa (175 torr) at 600°C], and clearly present no dangerous situations.
However, it is necessary to maintain the appropriate partial pressures
cf BF3 in any flowing cover—-gas stream to avoid composition changes in
the melt.

The appropriateness of that choice for the MSBR (and for the DMSR)
has been confirmed by several findings in recent years. First, a care-
ful and detailed reconsideration of secondary {(and even secondary plus
tertiary) coolants®” ranked the NaF-NaBF, coolant very high on the list
of alternatives. After these deliberations,’® experimental information'®
became available to show that the NaF-NaBF; mixture was genuinely effec-
tive in trapping H. The reconsideration, accordingly, concluded: "

While the information that is currently available is in-
adequate for accurate extrapolation to the rate of tritium re-
lease teo the steam system of an MSBR, it appears that the

sodium fluorcborate salt mixture would have a substantial in-

hibiting effect on such release and that environmentally ac-

ceptable rates (<10 Ci/d) could be achieved with reasonable
effort.

Additional study needed.®* A considerable study of many aspects of
fiuvoroborate chemistry has been conducted during the past few years.
Neverthelesg, our understanding of the chemistry of the NaF-NaBF., system
is less complete, and our knowledge of its behavior rests on a less se-
cure foundation than that of the MSBR fuel system. Thus there are sev-
eral areas where further or additional work is needed, although it seems
unlikely that the findings will threaten the feasibility of NaF-NaBFy
in the MSBR (or DMSR) concept.

 

"It should be obvious that the additional study of NaF-NaBF, cool-
ants needed for an MSBR is essentially identical to that needed for a
DMSR. Accordingly, the previous documentation,'’? except as modified by
more recent findings discussed later, adequately describes the neaded R&D
pregram.
46

Phase behavior of the simple NaF-NaBF, system and the equilibrium wass’
pressure of BF3 over the pertinent temperature interval are well under-
stood. If the NaF-NaBF, eutectic (or some near variant of it) is the
final coolant choice, little effort need be spent in these areas.

Additional information is needed, however, on the behavior of oxide
and hydroxide ions in the fluoroborate melts. For example, the solubility
of NasBoFg0 in the mixture is not well known; data on equilibria (in
inert containers) among H,0, HF, NaBF30H, and Na:B»Fe0 are still needed;
and rates of reaction of dilute NaBF30H solutions with metals need defi-

red spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy have identified the stable ring
compound Na3zB3Fg03; as the probable oxygen-containing species in ccolant

meits. "

Measurements of condensates trapped from the coolant salt tech-
nology facility (CSTF), a development loop, show a tritium concentration
of 10° relative teo the salt, suggesting that a volatile species may be
selectively transporting tritium from the loop through the vapor.lO Re-
cent results indicate that BF3°*2H,0 may exist as a molecular compound in
the vapor and could be regsponsible for the tritium trapping,3£+ However,
the mechanism by which tritium diffusing from the fuel system can be
trapped needs additional study.

As indicated above, several of the physical property values have
been estimated. These estimates are almost certainly adequate for the
present, but the program needs to provide for measurement of these quan-
tities.

Compatibility of the NaF-NaBF, with Hastelloy N under normal opera-
ting conditions seems assured. Additional study, in realistic flowing
systems, of the corrosive effects of steam inleakage is necessary. This
study, closely allied with the study of equilibria and the kinetics of
reactions involving the hydroxides and oxides described above, would re-
quire the long-term operation of a demonstration loop that could simulate
steam inleakage and coolant repurification.

Purification procedures for the coolant mixture are adequate for ’
the present and can be used to provide material for the many necessary
tests. However, they are not adequate for ultimate on-line processing

of the coolant mixture during operation. TFluorination of the coolant

on a reasonable cycle time would almost certainly suffice but it has not
been demonstrated. A process using a less aggressive reagent is clearly
desirable.’

A fluoroborate mixture has shown completely adequate radiation sta-
bility in a single (but realistically severe) test run.  Additional
radiation testing cf this material in a flowing system would seem de-
sirable and should ultimately be done but does not rate a high priority

1,2
at present. ?

Fuel-coolant interactions

 

A rupture of a tube (or tubes) in the primary heat exchanger would
unavoidably lead to mixing of some coeolant salt with the fuel. The pos-
sibility of a nuclear incident would seem highly unlikely because of the
consequent addition of the efficient nuclear poison boron to the fuel.
However, since BFj3; is volatile, mixing might result in a pressure surge,
and the NaF-NaBF, mixture contains some oxygenated species. The 1972
review, accordingly, concluded:?®

Mixing of coolant and fuel clearly requires additional

study. The situation which results from equilibration of these

fluids 1is reascnably well understood, and, even where large

leakages of coolant into the fuel are assumed, the ultimate

"equilibrium' seems to pose no real danger. However, the real

situation may well not approximate an equilibrium condition.

Studies of such mixing under realistic conditions in flowing

systems are lacking and necessary.

The 1974 program plan2 included a very considerable program for such
study.

More recent experiments’®" have thrown additional light upen such
mixing. Although additional experiments are needed, it now appears
likely that such mixing would not pose drastic problems. These experi-
ments revealed that BF; gas was slowly evolved when the salts were mixed;
some 30 min were required to complete the BF3 evolution. Furthermore,
the ThF4 and UFy4 showed no tendency to redistribute, to form more con-
centrated solutions, or to precipitate. Moreover, no UG, precipitated
even when the molten fuel-coolant combination was agitated for several

hours while exposed to air.
48

Additional confirmatory experiments will be required and the dif-
ferent species in DMSR fuel must be tested. Such experiments may re-

ceive less attention and lower priority than previously helieved.!s?

Fuel-graphite interactions

 

Graphite does not react with, and is not wetted by, molten fluoride
mixtures of the type to be used in the MSBR. Available thermodynamic

35

data suggest that the most likely reaction,

4UFy + C

@ T Cey T CFe

+ 4UF 4

(g) (d) ~’

should come to equilibrium at CF, pressures below 107% atm. At least
one source°® lists chromium carbide (Crs3Cs) as stable at MSBR tempera-
tures. If Crs:Cy is stable, it should be possible to transfer chromium
from the bulk alley to the graphite. No evidence of such behavior has
been observed with Hastelloy N in the MSRE or other experimental assem-
blies. Although such migration may be possible with alloys of higher
chromium content, it should not prove greatly deleterious, since its
rate would be controlled by the rate at which chromium could diffuse .
to the alloy surface and should be limited by a film of Cri3C; formed on
the graphite. This consideration, taken with the wealth of favorable
experience, suggests that no problems are likely from this source in
the reference MSBR or in a DMSR.

However, some additional examination of this unlikely problem area
must be done for the DMSR, particularly if operation at UF3;/UFy ratios
near 0.1 is to be attempted. The upper limit on that ratio will most

likely be set by the equilibrium

AUFg(d) + 2C - 3UF, + UCy

(c) (d) (c)

at the lower end of the operating temperature range.37

Toth and Gilpatrick,38 who used a spectrometric technique in which
molten salts were contained in cells of graphite with diamond windows,
made a careful study of equilibria among UFs: and UF4 in molten solution

with solid graphite and uranium carbides. Their data show that the ratio

 
 

 

49

of UF3 to UFy in LiF-BeF;-ThFy (72-16-12 meole %) in equilibrium with
graphite and UC, at 565°C lies in the range 0.11 to 0.16.% All equilibria
.f.

studied were found to be very sensitive to temperature' and to the free
fluoride concentration of the solvent. It would seem likely that UF;/UF,
ratios as high as 0.1 can be tolerated for a DMSR (though slight adjust-
ments in fuel composition or fuel-inlet temperature might be required),
but confirmatory experiments are needed. Since similar systems appear

to be sensitive to oxide ion concentration, some experimental study of
this parameter will also be required.

Even at relatively high temperatures, graphite has been shown to

adsorb H» and its isotopes to an appreciable extent. - Further informa-

tion about this phenomenon should be cbtained.

Prime R&D Needs

 

Weaknesses in the existing technological base and requirements for
additional technical information have been identified throughout the
preceding discussion of the technology status. These needs are consoli-
dated and presented below, in cutline form, to provide a concise tabula-

tion for defining and scheduling possible R&D activities.

determine identity of the products and tﬁe key reaction rates.

3. Determine {(in cocperation with the materials development effort de-
scribed in Part IV of this document) the effect of the "contaminants"
mentioned above, and the effect of steam inleakage, on corrosivity
of coolant salt.

4. Refine the measurements of physical properties of NaF-NaBF, as re-
quired.

5. Confirm the adequacy of radiation resistance of the realistic mixture

ous interactions exist and define the limits of behavior.

3. Verify the interaction of noble-metal fission-products with graphite

at usable UF3/UFy ratios.

Estimates of Scheduling and Costs

Preliminary estimates of the necessary schedule and of its operating
and capital funding requirements are presented below for the fuel and
coolant chemistry program described above. As elsewhere in this document,
it has been assumed that (1) the program would begin at the start of FY
1980, (2) it would lead to an operating DMSR in 1995, and (3) the R&D
program will produce no great surprises and no major changes in program
direction will be required.

The schedule, along with the dates on which key developments must
be finished and major decisions;made, is shown in Table 3.1. It seems
virtually certain that the R&D programs (including those described else-
where in this document) will provide some minor surprises and that some
changes in the chemistry program will be required. No specific provi-
sions for this are included; but, unless major revisions become necessary
in the middle eighties, it appears likely that suitable fuel and cooclant
compositions could be confidently recommended on this schedule.

The operating funds (Table 3.2) and the capital equipment require-
ments (Table 3.3) are shown on a year-by-year basis in thousands of 1978
dollars. No allowance for contingencies, for major program changes, and

for inflation during the interval have been provided.

4. ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY

Scope and Nature of the Task

 

With conventional solid-fueled reactors, there is neither the op-
portunity nor an cbvious need for chemical analyses of the fuel during
its sojourn in the reactor. On the other hand, for a fluid-fueled reac-
tor, particularly cne that includes a fuel processing plant, there is a
pressing need to know the precise composition (particularly the concen-
trations of fissile materials) in several process streams. Moreover,
such information is needed at frequent intervals (if not continuously)
and on a real-time basis. As a consequence, such reactors are much more
dependent on analytical chemistry than are, for example, LWRs.

The MSRE was indeed coperated successfully with chemical analyses
performed on discrete samples of fuel removed from the reactor for hot-
cell study. However, it was recognized1 early that the MSBR and its as-
sociated reprocessing plant would require in-line analyses. The DMSR
would be equally dependent on successful development of such analytical
techniques.

These requirements are several in number. It will be necessary to
determine on a virtually continuous basis the redox potential, the con-
centrations of uranium, protactinium, and other fissionable materials
and of bismuth and specific corrosion products (notably chromium) in the
stream entering the reactor from the processing plant. Such information
must also be available for the fuel within the reactor circuit and in the
stream to the reprocessing plant. In addition, it would be highly de-
sirable to know the oxide ion concentration in the fuel within the reactor
and in the stream from the processing plant and tc know the states and
concentrations of selected fission products in the fuel within the reactor.
It will be essential to know the concentrations of uranium and fissile
isotopes in the processing streams from which they could be lost (tc the
waste system) from the complex. These streams will include the small
stream of released off-gas, the LiCl system®* for rare-earth transfer,

the ZrFy removal system® and perhaps a system® for removal of metallic

 

ol

“These systems are described in Chapter 6.
56

noble-metal fission products. 1In addition, it will be necessary to g
monitor corrosion products, oxygenated compounds, and protonated (and

tritiated) products in the coolant system and in the off-gas system as

well as in the system for hold-up and recovery of tritium. Accordingly,

on~line analyses will be required in at least three kinds of molten

salts, in gases, and perhaps in molten bismuth alloys® within the

processing plant.

Key Differences in Reactor Concepts%

 

Insofar as the analytical chemistry requirements (and the R&D needs)
are concerned, the DMSR and the MSBR are quite similar. The DMSR will
require determination of plutonium {(and to some extent of Am, Cm, and
Np) to a degree markedly different frem the MSBR. Concentrations of
CF3, UFy, and PaF, in the fuel stream will be higher in a DMSR (as will
that of ZrF.) than in an MSBR. Complexities of the fuel processing plants
for the two reactors are very similar, and, except for the presence of
transuranics, so are the analytical requirements.

In principle, the emphasis on proliferation resistance would seem
to place additional demands on surveillance and precise determination of
plutonium, protactinium, and uranium within the DMSR system. In fact,
the requirements already imposed by the demands for safe and reliable
continuous coperation of the complex are almost certainly at least as

stringent,

Pogt-1974 Technology Advances

 

Several advances, a few amounting to breakthroughs, were made in
the 1971-1974 interval.'»>® The post-1974 studies in analytical chemistry
consisted mainly of (particularly valuable) service functions and, ex-

cept for studies of tellurium behavior, contained little exploratory

 

¥
It is clearly desirable, and may be necessary, to have on-line de-
terminations o¢f lithium and of some other metallic species in bismuth

streams.

development cof the kind ultimately needed. Primary accomplishments in
the post-1974 period were therefore relatively few. They did include
the following:

1. On-line voltammetric techniques for determination of the UF3/UF,

ratio were refined and were applied successfully and routinely in many
corrosion test 100?8#0,@1 and engineering eX]_Je:r:'Lments.6’7’“0”“2 Such
techniques can now be said to be well established in the absence of
radiation {which should prove of little consequence) and of fission prod-
ucts.

NaBFy coolant salt were applied successfully in engineering test equip-
ment, ' %s%?

3. Voltammetric and chronopotentiometric techniques have been suc-
cessfully applied to measurements of Fe?t in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12

> using anodic voltammetry show prom-

moie %),"" and preliminary studies®
ise for in-line monitering of oxide level in this molten salt, at least

under favorable conditions.

Status of Analytical Development

 

MSRE operation was mainly conducted with analyses performed on dis-
crete samples removed from the reactor. The reactor off-gas was analyzed
by in-line methods, and remote gamma spectroscopy was used to study fis-
sion products; all other determinations were made using hot-cell techniques

on batch samples. Of course, a major program of R&D preceded that opera-
1,2

tion. ?

Substantial experience had been gained in the handling and analysis
of nonradioactive fluoride salts prior to the MSRE program. Ionic or
instrumental methods had been developed for most metallic constituents.
For MSRE application it was necessary to develop additional techniques
and to adapt all the methcods to hot-cell operations. A nonselective
measurement of "reducing power" of adequate sensitivity had been developed

L7 . \ .
in the radiochemical

(hydrogen evolution method).*® A general expertise
separation and measurement of fission products was available from earlier
reactor programs at ORNL, and useful experience with in-line gas analysis,

particularly process chromatography,l+8 was available from other programs.
58

During the operation of the MSRE and in the subsequent technology
program, development of methods for discrete samples was continued, and
the Laboratory has acquired instrumentation for newer analytical tech-
niquea—:.h"9 Instrumental methods expected to contribute to the program
include x-ray absorptiocon, diffraction, and fluorescence techniques;
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); spark source mass spectrometry; elec-— .
tron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and Auger spectrometry;
electron microprobe measurements; scanning electron microscopy; Raman
spectrometry; Fourier transform spectrometry; neutron activation analy-
sis; delayed neutron methods; photon activation analysis; and scanning

with high-energy particles, e.g., protons.

Key developments for MSRE

 

Homogenized and free-flowing powdered samples of radioactive fuels
taken from the MSRE were routinely produced in the hot cell within 2 hr
of receipt. Salt samples were taken in small copper ladles that were
sealed under helium in a transport container in the sampler—enricher50
for delivery to the hot cell. Atmospheric exposure was sufficient to
compromise the determination of oxide and Ut but did not affect other
measurements. lechniques for taking and handling of such samples (for
those analyses for which they will suffice) are well demonstrated.

Oxide concentration could not be reliably determined on the pul-
verized salt samples because of unavoidable atmospheric contamination.
Instead, 50-g samples of salt were treated with anhydrous HF gas and
the evolved water was collected and determined.”' Oxide concentrations
of about 50 ppm were determined with better than *10 ppm precisiocn.*

Uranium analyses by coulometric titration showed good reproduc-
ibility and precision (0.57), but on-line reactivity balance data estab-
lished changes in uranium concentration within the circuit with about
ten times that sensitivity.l Fluorination of the uranium from 50-g sam-

52 .
and was used to separate uranium for

ples was shown to be quantitative
precise isotopic determination. If necessary, it could also have served
as the basis for a more accurate uranium analysis.

The rate of production of HF upon sparging of the fuel with Hy; is

a function of the UF3/UFy ratio. This transpiration method, modified

 
 

 

59

to allow for other ions in the fue1,53 gave values in reasonable agree-
ment with "book' values during operation with 2°°U (0.9 mole % U). The
method proved inadequate at the lower concentrations during operation of
the MSRE with 2%3U. Attempts tec determine UF3/UF, ratios by a voltam-—
metric method using remelted salt samples was not generally successfulls>®
because of prior UF: oxidation via atmospheric contamination. However,

it was possible to follow UF3 generation via H, sparging upon such sam-
ples.1 The radiation level of the samples does not appear to affect the
method.

A facility for spectrophotometry of highly irradiated fuel samples
from the MSRE was designed and constructed.”" The system design included
devices for remelting large salt samples under inert atmosphere and dis-
pensing portions to spectrophotometric cells. The entire system could
not be completed in time to give much useful data for MSRE.* It has
since been used to observe spectra of transuranium elements and of pre-
tactinium in molten salts. Feasibility of the general technique appears
to be established.

Equipment was installed at the MSRE to perform limited in-line
analyses of the reactor off-gases, using a thermal conductivity cell as
a transducer. An oxidation and absorption train®? permitted measurement
of total impurities and hydrocarbens in the off-gas. The sampling staticn
also included a system for the cryogenic ccllectien of xXenon and krypton
on molecular sieves to provide concentrated samples for the precise de-
termination of the isotopic ratios of krypton and xenon by mass spec-
trometry. During the last two runs of the MSRE, equipment was installed’”®
at the reactor to convert the tritium in various gas streams to water
for measurement by scintillation counting.

By means of a precise collimation system mounted on a maintenance
shield, radiation from deposited fission products on components was di-
rected to a high-resolution, lithium-drifted, germanium diode.”® From
the gamma spectra obtained, specific isotopes such as noble-metal fission

products were identified and their distribution was mapped by moving

adverse effects from radiocactivity of the fuel.

the collimating system. During the latter runs of the reactor, such s

. . 57
measurements were made during power operation.

Analytical development for MSBR#*

 

At present, it appears that the measurement of the concentration of
major fuel constituents such as lithium, beryllium, thorium, and fluo-
ride ion by in-line methods may not be practical in an MSBR. Fortunately,
continuous monitering of these constituents will not be critical to the
operation of a reactor. The more critical determinations, which were
briefly described above, are generally amenable to in-line measurement.

The ultimate need for an MSBR is an analytical system that includes
all needed in-line analytical measurements that are feasible, backed up
by adequate hot-cell and analytical laboratories. In the interim, ca-
pabilities must be developed and analytical support provided for the tech-
nology development activities in the program.

Electrochemical studies. For the analysis of molten-salt streams,

 

electroanalytical techniques such as voltammetry and potentiometry ap-
pear to offer the most convenient transducers for remote in-line measure-
ments. Voltammetry is based on the principle that when an inert elec-
trode is inserted into a molten salt and subjected to a changing voltage
relative to the salt potential, negligible current flows until a criti-
cal potential is reached at which one or more of the ions undergo an
electrochemical reduction or oxidation. The potential at which this
reaction takes place is characteristic of the particular ion or ions.
If the potential is varied linearly with time, the resulting current-
voltage curve follows a predictable pattern in which the current reaches
a diffusion-limited maximum value that is directly proportionai to the
concentration of the electrocactive ion or ioms.

Basic voltammetric studies have been made on corrosion-product ions
in the MSRE fuel solvent LiF-BeF,;-ThF,>%7%2 and in the proposed coolant
salt Tl.\“haBFq—l\IaF.61"63 Most of this work is concerned with the determina-

tion of the oxidation states of the elements, the most suitable electrode

materials for their analysis, and the basic electrochemical characteris-
tics of each element. It has been shown that relatively high concentra-
tions (typically 20 ppm) can be estimated directly from the height of
the voltammetric waves. Lower concentrations can be measured using the
technique of stripping voltammetry through observation of the current
produced when a corrosion product is oxidized from an electrode on which
it has previously been plat,ed.6LP

A voltammetric method has been developed for the determiration of
the U3t/U*t ratio in the MSRE fuel.®® This method involves the measure-
ment of the potential difference between the equilibrium potential of
the melt, measured by a noble electrode, and the voltammetric equivalent

3+/U4+’

of the standard potential of the U couple. The reliability of the

method was verified by comparison with values cobtained spectrophoto-

PDP-8 computer, which operates the voltammeter, analyzes the data, and

computes the U3+/U“+ ratic. Recently, the method was used to determine

U3+/E“+ ratios in a thorium-bearing fuel solvent, LiF-BeF,-ThF., (68-20-
12 mole %). Ratios covering the range of 107° to >107% were measured
during the reduction of the fuel in a forced-convection loop.2 The data
support the reliability of the method in this medium.

introducing bismuth into the fuel, a method for bismuth determination is

an impurity in the fuel salt, bismuth will probably be present in the

metallic state; so some oxidative pretreatment of the melt will be nec-

essary before a voltammetric determination of bismuth can be performed.
The measurement of the concentration of protonated species in the

proposed MSBR coolant salt is of interest because of the potential use

of the coolant for the containment of tritium. The measurement could

also be used to evaluate the effect of proton concentrations on corrosion

rates and as a possible detection technique for steam-generator leaks.

A rather unique electroanalytical technique that is specific for hydro-

62,67

gen was investigated. The method is based on the diffusicn of hy-

drogen into an evacuated palladium—-tube electrode when NaBFy melts are
62

electrolyzed at a controlled potential. The pressure generated in the s
electreode is a sensitive measure of protons at parts-per-billion concen-
trations. The technique offers the advantages of specificity, applica-
bility to in-line analysis, and the possibility of a measurement of
tritium-to~hydrogen ratios in the coolant by counting the sample col-
lected from the evacuated tube. Measurements by this technique have led
to the discovery that at least two forms of combined hydrogen are present
in NaBFy4 melts.

The availability of an invariant reference potential to which other
electrochemical reactions may be referred on a relative potential scale
is a distinct advantage in all electroanalytical measurements. The
major problem was te find nonconducting materials that would be compati-
ble with fluoride melts. Successful measurements were performed with a
Ni/NiF, electrode in which the reference sclution (LiF-BeF; saturated

68,869 Standard

with NiF;) is contained within a single-crystal LaF3 cup.
electrode potentials were determined for several metal/metal-ion couples
which will be present in the reactor salt streams.®® These electrode
potentials provide a direct measure of the relative thermodynamic stabil-
ity of electroactive species in the melts. This information can be used
in equilibrium calculations tc determine which ions would be expected to
be present at different melt potentials.

As noted above, preliminary studies have indicated that, in at
least some of the salt streams, an electrecanalytic method for oxide con-~
centration may be feasible. Determination of C17 in the fluoride meits
(as may be necessary since "LiCl from the fission-product transfer system
could contaminate the fuel) can probably be accomplished by voltammetric
techniques.

The MSBR regquired little effort on transuranic elements other than
to determine whether traces of plutonium and higher transuranics inter-
fered with determination of other pertinent species. Interference pos-
sibilities will be intensified in the DMSR and thus quantitative deter-
mintations of Pu, Am, Np, and Cm at various points must be provided. .

Spectrophoteometric studies. Because molten fluorides react with

 

the light-transmitting glasses usually emplcved, special cell designs

have been developed for the spectrophoteometric examination of MSBR melts.

 
 

 

03

The pendant-drop technique70 that was first developed was later repiaced
with the captive-liquid cell’? in which molten salts are contained by
virtue of their surface tension so that no window material is required.

A concept has been proposed for the use of this cell in an in-line sys-
tem. ? The light path length through a salt in a captive-liquid cell

is determinable but is not fixed. The need for a fixed path length pro-
moted the design and fabrication of a graphite cell having small diamond-
plate windows ® which has been used successfully in a number of research
applications. Another fixed-path-length cell which is still in the de-
velopment stage makes use of a porous metal £f0il’" that contains a number
of small irregular pits formed electrochemically; many of the pits are
etched completely through the foil so that light can be transmitted
through the metal. Porous metal made from Hastelloy N has been pur-
chased to test its use for cell construction.

The latest innovation in cell design is an optical probe® which
lends itself to a sealable insertien into a molten-salt stream. > The
probe makes use of multiple internal reflections within a slot of ap-

measurements in NaBFy streams.

methods is also providing data fer the identification and determination

Gas analysis. Some determinations on MSRE samples {see preceding
section) were done by treatment of the salt to produce gases for analy-
sis. Little development of such devices has been attempted since the
MSRE ceased operations. The electrolytic moisture monitor was demon-—
strated to provide more than adequate sensitivity for the measurement
of water from the hydroflucrination method for oxide and to have ade-
quate tolerance for operation at the anticipated radiation levels.®? A
method has been developed for the remote measurement of micromolar quan-
tities of HF generated by hydrogenation of fuel samples using a thermal-
conductivity method after preconcentration by trapping on NaF.®3
Commercial gas chromatographic components for high-sensitivity
measurement of permanent gas contaminants are not expected to be accept-
able at the radiation levels of the MSBR off-gas. Valves contain elas-
tomers that are subject to radiation damage and whose radiolysis products
would contaminate the carrier gas. The more sensitive detectors generally
depend on ionization by weak radiation sources and would obviously be
affected by sample activity. A prototype of an all-metal sampling valve®"
has been constructed to effect six-way, double-throw switching of gas
streams with closure provided by a pressure-actuated metal diaphragm. A
helium breakdown detector was found to be capable of measuring <l-ppm
concentrations of permanent gas impurities in helium. Use of this de-
tector in a simple chromatograph on the purge gas of an in-reactor cap-

sule test demonstrated that it was not affected by radioactivity.85

 
 

 

65

The analysis of the coolant cover gas involves less radioactivity
but more complex chemical problems. Methods are being investigated for
the determination of condensable material tentatively didentified as BF3
hydrates and hydrolysis products86 and for other forms of hydrogen and
tritium. ''Dew=-point" and diffusion methods offer promise for such mea-

87
surements.

In-line applications. The first successful chemical analysis of a
88 3+/

 

filowing molten fluoride salt stream = was demonstrated by measuring U

U*" ratios in a loop being operated to determine the effect of salt on
Hastelloy N under both oxidizing and reducing cenditions. The test fa-
cility was a Hastelloy N thermal-convection loop in which LiF-BeFy-ZrF,-
UFy circulated at V25 mm/s (5 lin ft/min). The analytical transducers

were platinum and iridium electrodes that were installed in a surge tank

where the temperature was controlled at 650°C.

The Ug'“’“/UL:’+ ratio was monitored intermittently for several months
on a completely automated basis. A new cyclic voltammeter, which pro-
vides several new capabilities for electrochemical studies on molten-
salt systems, was designed for use with this system. The voltammeter

Prime Development Needs¥ e

 

The following list is a consolidation of the analytical chemistry
development needs identified in the preceding section.

1. Continued on-line demonstration of UFs/UF, ratio and total
uranium concentration in operating loops, in radiation fields, and in
presence of fission products and transuranics.

2. Demonstration of satisfactory on-line methods for determination
of plutonium and pertinent transuranics in realistic fuel and/or process-
ing streams.

3. Continued demonstration of methods for determination of corro-

2+ and Fez+) in fuel, coolant, and some

sion products {particularly Cr
process streams.
4. Methods for on-line determination of bismuth and C17 in fuel
salt from processing plant.
5. Sound methods for determination of protactinium in at least
some of the processing streams and, if possible, in the fuel within
the reactor.
6. In-line determination of valence state and concentration of
some important fission products (Te, Nb, Zr, Nd, and Eu) in fuel or .
pertinent process streams.
7. On-line methods for estimaticn of 0°7 content of fuel.
8. Demonstration of methods for determination of oxygenated and
protonated {(and tritiated) species in coolant salt and, if possible, of
tritiated species in the fuel.
9. Development of methods for determination of U, Pu, Pa, Th, and
0°~ in molten LiCL.
10. Development of methods for Cs+, Rb+, F7, and corrosion prod-
tcts in LiCl.
11. Methods for determination cof Lio, total reducing power, and
hopefully specific metals (especially plutonium and protactinium) in

molten bismuth.

 

"See Ref. 2 for additional details. It is expected that spectro-
photometric methods can be used for some of these, but it is anticipated “
that on-line electroanalytical techniques will carry the major load.
Both should be sufficiently developed that a choice can be made.

 
S 12. Development of reference electrodes suitable for use in the
pertinent systems.

13. Methods for determination of UFg, Fp, HF-H; mixtures, I, TeFg,
and SeFg in process gas streams.

14. Monitor for rare-gas fission products, and HT, I, etc., in
fuel cover gas and in small gas releases from that system.

15. Methods for analysis of cover gas over coclant for HT, HTO,
other tritiated compounds, BFj3, etc.

It is clear that most if not all of the above studies must be demon-

strated to be applicable in the presence of intense radiation fields and
in realistic solutions containing a spectrum of materials that might in-
terfere with the determinations.

Initial testing (most of which has been done) requires simple labor-
atory facilities. Generally {(as has been done in the past), demonstra-
tion should use engineering-scale facilities that test other facets of
the program at the same time. However, special facilities in which alpha-
emitting isotopes (plutonium, etc.) can be safely handled and hot cells
where high levels of activity can be used will clearly be required after
the initial development stage has passed.

In addition, an in-line tegt facility will be required for testing

the complex array of analytical devices in an integrated way.

Estimates of Scheduling and Costs

 

Preliminary estimates of the necessary schedule and of its operating
and capital funding requirements are given here for the analytical chem-
istry program described above. As elsewhere in this document, it has
been assumed (1) that the program would begin at start of FY 1980, (2)
it would lead to an operating DMSR in 1995, and (3) the R&D program will
produce no great surprises and no major changes in program direction will
be required.

The schedule, along with the dates on which key developments must
be finished and major decisions made, is shown in Table 4.1. It seems
certain that the overall R&D programs (including those described else-

where in this deocument) will provide some minor surprises, and scme

changes in the analytical chemistry program will be required. No spe-
cific provisions for this are included; but, unless major revisions
become necessary in the middie 1980s, it appears that suitable analy-
tical techniques and instrumentation could be confidently recommended
as shown in this schedule.

The operating funds (Table 4.2) and the capital equipment require-
ments (Table 4.3) are shown on a year-by-year basis in thousands of

5. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT FOR FUEL REPROCESSING -

Scope and Nature of the Task

 

The materials required for molten-salt fuel reprocessing systems
depend, of course, upon the nature of the chosen process and upon the
design of the equipment to implement the process. For the MSBR#* the
key operations in fuel reprocessingl’2 are (1) removal of uranium from
the fuel stream for immediate return to the reactor, (2) removal of
23%pa and fission-product zirconium from the fuel for isclation and de-
cay of 233pa outgide the neutron flux, and {(3) removal of rare-earth,
alkali-metal, and alkaline-earth fission products from the fuel solvent
(L.iF-BeF;-ThF,) before its return, along with the uranium, to the reactor.

Such a processing plant will present a variety of corrosive environ-

. 1,2
ments. Those of greatest severity are as follows: »°

1. the presence of molten salt along with gaseous mixtures of F» and UFg

at 500 to 550°C;

B

the presence of molten salts with absorbed UFg so that average val-
ence of uranium is near 4.3 (UFy.s} at temperatures near 550°C;

3. the presence of molten salts (either molten fluorides or molten LiCl)
and molten alloys containing bismuth, lithium, thorium, and other

metals at temperatures near 650°C: and
P

4‘_\

the presence of HF-H; mixtures and molten fluorides, along with bis-
muth in some cases, at 550 to 6€50°C.

5. the presence of interstitial impurities on the outside of the system
at temperatures to 650°C, particularly if graphite or refractory

metals are used.

The sizes and shapes of the components of the processing plant will
evolve as additional pilot-plant work is performed on the various process-
ing steps. The flow from the reactor is of the order of 60 em®/s (1
gpm}, so the piping sizes will be quite small. The crucial process in
most of the processing vessels is that liquids be contacted te transfer

selected materials from one stream to the other. This contacting could

73

be carried ocut in columns with countercurrent flow or it could be ac-
complished in rather simple mixer-settler vessels with some stirring of
the fluids at their interface. Thus the processing vessels may simply
be pipe sections a few meters long and a few centimeters in diameter or
they may be cells (about 1/2-m cubes) intercomnnected with small-diameter
tubing. The high radiation and contamination levels will require that
the processing plant be contained and ﬁave strict environmental control.
If the components are constructed of reactive materials such as molybdenum,
tantalum, or graphite, the environment must be an inert gas or a vacuum
to prevent deterioration of the structural material.

Obviously, materials capable of long~term service under these con-
ditions must be provided. The development program necessary to do this

is described below.

Key Differences in Reactor Concepts

 

The fuel reprocessing plant envisioned for a DMSR* will differ in
several nontrivial regards from that of the reference MSBR. However,
in the conceptual DMSR plant® the same unit operations and processes
will be used as for the MSBR. Accordingly, it seems certain that mate-
rials satisfactory for construction of the reference MSBR reprocessing
plant would suffice for a DMSR and that development needs identified

for that MSBRI’2

plant differ trivially, if at all, from those of the
generally similar DMSR plant.

Alternative processes (oxide precipitation of protactinium and,
perhaps, of uranium) have been identified as being less satisfactory
but probably feasible fall-back positions for some (not all) of the
MSBR processing plant operations. It is less clear (see Chapter 6)
that these would be feasible for the DMSR;* should they prove so, the

materials effort to support them would differ little from that for an

MSBR.

 

“See Chapter 6 for a detailed description cf fuel reprocessing.

The presence of plutonium and transuranics is a complicating factor
for a DMSR.
Pogt—1974 Technology Advances

 

After 1974 the MSBR Program had severely limited funding and could
afford little effort on development of materials for reprocessing equip-
ment. Accordingly, the situation for this important development program

is not markedly different from that described in the mid-1974 survey.?

Static tests for 3000 hr at 650°C showed that concentrated bismuth-
lithium alloy (48 at. % lithium) contained in graphite crucibles® per-
meated graphite specimens nearly uniformly and to a depth (0.13 to 0.4 mm,
or 5 to 15 mils) that depended on graphite density.+ Less-concentrated
alloy (4.8 at. 7 lithium) showed little evidence of penetration except

30 However, ATJ graphite speci-

in low—density regions cof the specimens.,
mens, tested in a molybdenum thermal convection loop for 3000 hr at hot-
and cold-leg temperatures of 700 and 600°C showed very large weight gains
of up to 65%, virtually all due te bismuth, though some molybdenum was
present. ° It seems possible, though it has not been confirmed, that the
molybdenum (perhaps by formation of a carbide) greatly promoted wetting

and permeation of the graphite by the alloy.

Tantalum and its alloys (particularly Ta—l107 W) are known to be
stable to bismuth-lithium alloysﬁl’2 but the effect of molten fluorides
on these alloys is not known. A thermal-convection loop of Ta—107 W was
started in February 1976, with Li¥-BeF;-ThFy-UFy (72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %)
and with hot- and coid-leg temperatures of 690 and 585°C, respectively’,91
The loop was kept in operation when the MSR Program was terminated; it
is still in operation after more than 18,000 hr with no appreciable change
in flow characteristics.?? Therefcre, no marked mass transfer of the
alloy appears to have occurred. Since reprocessing equipment probably
does not need to have temperature gradients as high as 100°C, the Ta—10%

W alloy shows real promise for use in reprocessing equipment.

Present Status of Technology

 

Materials for fluorinators and UFs absorbers

 

Nickel or nickel-base alleys can be used for construction of fluori-
nators and for containment of ¥, UFg, and HF, though these metals would
require protection by a frozen layer of fuel solvent over areas where
contamination of the molten stream by the otherwise inevitable corrosion
products would be severe. Many years of experience in fabrication and
joining of such alloys have been accumulated'*” in the construction of
reactors and asscociated engineering hardware.

The corrosion of nickel and its alloys in the severe environment
represented by fluorination of UFs from molten salts has been studied
in some detail. Most cof the data were obtained during operation93 of
two plant-scale fluorinators constructed of L nickel at temperatures
ranging from 540 to 730°C. A number of corrosion specimens (20 differ-
ent materials) were located in the fluorinators. Several specimens,
including Hymu 80 and INOR-1, had lower rates of maximum corrosive at-

33,94 .
359 Nevertheless, L nickel, protected where neces-

tack than L nickel.
sary Ey frozen salt, is the preferred material for the fluorination—UFg-
absorption system since the other alloys would centribute volatile fluo-
rides of chromium and molybdenum to the gaseous UFg.

Absorption of UFg in molten salts containing UFy is proposed (see

Materials for selective extractions

 

Most of the essential separations required of the processing plant
are accomplished by selectively extracting species from salt streams into
bismuth-lithium alloys or vice versa.* These extractions pose difficult
materials problems. Materials for containment of bismuth and its alloys
are known, as are materials for containment of molten salts. Unfortu-

nately, the two groups have few common members.

would not survive the separations steps in the processing cycle. More-

Molybdenum is a particularly structure-sensitive material; its
mechanical properties vary widely depending upon how it has been metal-
lurgically processed. The ductile-brittle transition temperature for
molybdenum varies from below room temperature to 200-300°C, depending
both upon strain rate and the microstructure of the metal. Maximum duc-
tility is provided in the cold-worked, fine-grained condition. The arc-
melted molybdenum now available commercially affords relatively good
control of grain size and interstitial impurity level. Nevertheless,
the use of molybdenum as a structural material requires highly spe-
cialized assembly procedures and imposes stringent limitations on system

design from the standpoint of geometry and rigidity.l’2

Many advances in the fabrication technology of molybdenum were made
at ORNL during attempted censtruction of a melybdenum system in which
bismuth and molten salt could be countercurrently contacted in a 25-mm-
ID, 1.5~m~high packed column having 90-mm-ID upper and lower disengaging
sections, ®® Techniques were developed for the production of closed-end
molybdenum vessels by back extrusion. Parts that were free from cracks
and had high-quality surfaces were produced consistently with this tech-
nique by the use of ZrO;-ccated plungers and dies and extrusion tempera-
tures of 1600 to 1700°C. The 1.7-m-long molybdenum pipe for the extraction
column, having an outside diameter of 29.5 mm and an inside diameter of

25 mm, was produced by floating-mandrel extrusion at 1600°C.

It was found that commercial molybdenum tubing can be made ductile
at room temperature by etching 0.025 to 0.08 mm of material from the
tube interior.'s?

03 (either by

Complex components have been fabricated by welding1
gas—tungsten-arc or by electron-beam techniques). Two of the most im-
portant factors found to minimize molybdenum weldment cracking have been
stress relieving of components and preheating prior to welding. Mechanical
tube-to-header joints have also‘been produced by pressure bonding by
use of commercial tube expanders. An iron-base alloy of the composi-
tion Fe-Mo-Ge-C-B (75-15-5-4-1 wt %) has been found to have good wetting
and flow properties, a moderately low brazing temperature (<1200°C), and

adeguate resistance to corrosion by bismuth at 650°C.»?
78

Although molybdenum welds that are helium leaktight have been pro- s
duced consistently using both the electron-beam and tungsten-arc tech-
niques, the ductile-brittle transition of the resulting welds was above
room temperature, and it was necessary to design each joint to support
the welds mechanically. The joints were also back-brazed or vapor plated
with tungsten to provide a secondary barrier against leakage. &

Both previous survey‘sl’2 concluded that

The results of work to date on molybdenum fabrication tech-

niques have been quite encouraging, and it is believed that

the material can be used in constructing components for pro-

cessing systems if proper attention is given to its fabrica-

tion characteristics.

That statement still appears to define a tenable position. However,
the test assembly described above was not completed.* Each of the fabri-
cation steps constituted a special R&D effort, and each welding and
brazing operation was an adventure. There is little doubt that further
advances in molybdenum metallurgy will be made, and it seems certain that
molybdenum fabrication research should continue as a part of the DMSR.
However, such fabrication will be slow and expensive for some time, and
the products are likely to be of uncertain reliability,+ Since it can
hardly be considered likely that complex engineering equipment of molyb-
denum can be provided on a short-term schedule, fabrication of molybdenum
could be given a lower priority than previously suggested.l’z

Cn the other hand, the coating of conventional materials (such as
iron- or nickel-based alloys) with melybdenum should probably be con-
sidered for higher priority. Two types of coating processes have been
investigated:2 chemical-vapor deposition by hydrogen reduction of MoFg
and deposition from molten-salt mixtures containing MoFg¢ by chemical
reaction with the substrate. The latter method looks especially promising

because more complicated components could probably be coated using this

approach.

It was still incomplete when the program terminated in 1973 and .
was not revived, partly because of funding limitations, when the program
was revived in 1974.

These remarks clearly do not apply to simple items such as crucibles,
stirrers, impellers, or transfer lines.

Tungsten and tantalum alloys. Pure tungsten is resistant tec molten

 

bismuth. Because of its high ductile-brittle transition temperature,

it is not at all amenable to the fabrication and joining operations re-
guired for complex equipment, but crucibles, stirrers, etc., of tungsten
could be used. Its use as a surface coating (by chemical vapor deposi-
tion) on meolybdenum was noted above and could perhaps be extended to more
conventional metals. Atmospheric protection equivalent to that required

for molybdenum would be necessary for tungsten.

Pure tantalum and some of its ailoys with tungsten (in particular,
T-111: 8% W, 2% Hf, balance Ta) have been shown to be usefully compati-
ble with molten bismuth and bismuth-lithium alloys. In quartz thermal-
convection loops at 700°C, the mass transfer rate of pure tantalum in
these liquid metals was greater than that of molybdenum, although the
rate was still less than 0.08 mm/year. Mass transfer rates of the alloy
T-111 were comparable to those for molybdenum, but the mechanical proper-
ties of the former alloy were strongly affected by interaction with in-
terstitial impurities, primarily oxygen, in the experiments with pure
bismuth in quartz loops. A more recent test carried out at 700°C with
the bismuth—2.3 wt % lithium mixture in a loop constructed of T-111
tubing did not measurably affect the mechanical properties of the T-111,

There seems

and the mass transfer rate again was insignificant.l’
little reason to expect that an alloy of tantalum and tungsten alone
(Ta—10% W, for example) would behave badiy in bismuth-lithium alloys

at 650°C.

Tantalum and its alloys have the very great virtue cof relatively
easy fabricability. Several complex assemblies have been fabricated at
ORNL using the T-111 alloy, the largest of which was a forced-convection

10% A thermal-

loop which circulated liquid lithium for 3000 hr at 1370°C.
convection loop®! of Ta—107% W was constructed in 1976 and is still in
operation. In contrast to molybdenum, the alloy is quite ductile in the
as-welded condition; thus it appears promising for complex geometries.
The tantalum alloy, however, would require a higher degree of protection

from interstitial impurities (oxygen, carbon, nitrogen) than would molyb-

denum. It is likely that a tantalum system would require operation in a
80

high vacuum [107° Pa (V10”7 torr)] and that sufficient purity could not
be maintained in an inert gas purge system.

The resistance of tantalum and its alioys to molten fluorides has
long been questioned, but no definitive tests had been made when previ-
OUS surveys were written.'s? Further tests are obviously necessary, but
the continued satisfactory operation® of the Ta—10% W loop with LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, must be considered encouraging. Use of tantalum in contact with
LiCl and bismuth-lithium alloys {(as in the rare-earth transfer system)
has previously been considered a likely possibility.2

A high priority should be given to tests of tantalum alloys (par-
ticularly the Ta—10% W variety) in combinations of fluoride salts and
bismuth~lithium alloys. Should they succeed, it seems likely that the
fabrication problems could be readily managed.

Graphite. Graphite, which has excellent compatibility with fuel
salt, also shows promise for the containment of bismuth. Compatibility
tests to date have shown no evidence of chemical interaction between
graphite and bismuth containing up to 3 wt 7 (50 at. %) lithium. However,
the largest open pores of meost commercially available polycrystalline
graphites are penetrated to some extent by liquid bismuth. Static cap-

1
sule testg!?®

of three commercial graphites (ATJ, AXF-5QBG, and Graphi-
tite A) were conducted for 500 hr at 700°C using both high-purity bismuth
and bismuth—3 wt % lithium. Although penetration by pure bismuth was
negligible, the addition of lithium to the bismuth appeared to increase
the depth of permeation and presumably altered the wetting characteristics
of the bismuth. Results (see above) obtained recently in a thermal-con-
vection loop of mclybdenum containing graphite specimens at 600 to 700°C
in bismuth—3.8 at. Z lithium were considerably more pessimistic.

Limited penetration of graphite by bismuth sclutions may be toler-
able. 1If not, several approaches have the potential for decreasing the
extent to which a porous graphite is penetrated by bismuth and bismuth-
lithium alloys. Two well-established apprcaches are multiple impregna-
tions with liquid hydrocarbons, which are then carbonized and/or

graphitized, and pyrocarbon coatings. Other approaches are based on

vapor-deposited melybdenum coatings and the use of carbide-forming

sealants.

Fabrication of a processing plant from graphite would necessitate
graphite—-to~graphite and graphite~to-metal joints. Development studies
have been conducted on both types of joints using high-temperature brazes

106,107 Several of these

and also metals which bond by carbide formation.
experimental joining techniques show promise for the chemical processing
application. Graphite-to-graphite joints can also be made with plastic

cements. Other workers 103 have pioneered mechanical joints that

may be satisfactory for the proposed application.

It seems very likely that graphite can be used successfuily in at
least some portions of the plant. Graphite crucibles, complete with
relatively simple piping connections, as liners within vessels of con-
ventional ailoys would seem to be clearly feasible. Whether truly com-
plex and interconnecting assemblies can be reliably fabricated from

graphite must, however, remain somewhat speculative at present.

Summary. Molybdenum exhibits excellent compatibility with the
working fluids, and the extermnal environment could be inert gas, but
the problems in fabricating molybdenum are great. Tantalum is easy to
fabricate and is likely compatible with the working fluids, but the ex-
ternal environment must be a hard vacuum. High-density graphite is
likely compatible with the working fluids and can be adequately protected
on the outside with an inert gas, but it is difficult to fabricate into
complex shapes. As the chemistry of the processing system is engineered
further through pilot plants, the precise type of hardware needed will
be better defined. The approach taken to materials development will be
to initially emphasize definition of the basic material capabilities with
respect to salt, bismuth-lithium, lithium chloride, and interstitial im-
purities, and then to develop a knowledge of fabrication capabilities.
As process equipment becomes better defined, this information will be
used to engineer the necessary components. This will involve the de-

sign, construction, and testing of prototypic units.
82

Primary R&D Needs gz

 

The R&D program will necessarily be concerned with detailed tests
of materials compatibility and with studies of welding, brazing, and ‘
other jeining techniques as well as joint design. Facilities for static
testing, for operation of thermal-convection loop assemblies, and for
fabrication and operation of forced-convecticn (pumped) loops will be
required along with sophisticated equipment for welding, brazing, etc.,
under carefully controlled atmospheres. Such facilities have been used
routinely in the past and involve little, if any, additionzl development.

The foliowing key R&D items are required:*

1. Further demonstrate compatibility of tantalum alloys at realistic
temperatures
a. with molten fluorides,
b. with molten chlorides,
¢. with salt-bismuth-lithium, etc., combinations, and
d. at controlled contamination levels.
2. Prepare sound molybdenum, tungsten, and tantalum coatings on conven-
tional substrate metals in realistic geometries.
3. Test such molybdenum and tungsten coatings
a. with pertinent salt-bismuth alloy combinations,
b. wunder thermal stress and thermal shock, and
c. at controlled contamination levels,
4. Conduct compatibility survey with a thermal-convection loop contain-
ing specimens of all likely materials
a. with molten LiCil,
b. with molten fluoride, and
c. with moiten bismuth alloy containing "lithium, thorium, etc.
5. Further test graphite compatibility with bismuth-lithium alloys con-
taining other pertinent metals (i.e., thorium, uranium)} and extend

to "impervious'" graphites. .

 

*

Not all of these items must be successful, but all need to be car-
ried until a material (or materials) for all portions of the plant has
been demonstrated.

Estimates of Scheduling and Costs

 

Preliminary estimates of the necessary schedule and of its operating
and capital funding reguirements are presented below for the development
of materials for fuel processing described above. As elsewhere in this
document, it has been assumed that (1) the program would begin at the
start of FY 1980, (2) it would lead to an operating DMSR in 1995, and
(3) the R&D program will produce no great surprises and no major changes
in program direction will be required.

The schedule, along with the dates on which key developments must
be finished and major decisions made, is shown in Table 5.1. Tt seems
certain that the overall R&D programs (including those described else-
where in this document) will previde some minor surprises and that some
changes in this development will be required. No specific provisions
for this are included; but, unless major revisions become necessary in
the middle 1980s, it appears likely that suitable materials for the
processing cperation could be recommended on this schedule.

The operating funds (Table 5.2) and the capital equipment require-
ments (Table 5.3) are shown on a year-by-year basis in thousands of 1978
dollars. Ko aliowance for contingencies, major pregram changes, and in-
flation during the interval has been provided. The first task group
involves the development of resistant coatings for use on graphite and/or
other more conventional structural materials, while the second group of

tasks includes the simultaneous development of refractory materials

through construction and operation of both natural- and forced-circula-
tion corrosion loops. The third task group invelves development of
fabrication techniques for the materials under development, while the
fourth group is concerned with the evaluation of material performance

in gctual processing test equipment. It is, of course, conceivable that
a high level of success with one material might eliminate much of the
effort and asscciated costs on other materials.

This entire activity is time-scaled for completion in parallel with
the development of the reactor concept. However, since the reactor could
operate as a converter without on-line processing, the maior part of this
work could be deferred with the expectation of back-fitting a processing
plant to then-existing reactor facilities if the economic incentive were

sufficiently great when development was completed.
88

6. FUEL PROCESSING -

Scope and Nature of the Task

 

Fluid-fueled reactors, unlike more conventional reactor types, offer
the opportunity for continuocus processing of the fuel in a facility lo-
cated at the site and directly coupled to the reactor. Continuous pro-
cessing of its mclten fluoride fuel on a relatively short cycle time* is

233y through

esgential if an MSR is to be a high-performance breeder of
the intermediate 2°%°Pa from 2°2Th. For a "hold your own'' converter (con-
version ratio = 1.0 throughout reactor life), a longer processing cycle
time almost certainly suffices, but there is no doubt that an integrated
and essentially continuous processing system is required. A DMSR that

is to be fed no (or even little) fissile material after its initial
charge is an example of such a reactor.

Removal of fission products that are appreciable neutronic poisons
is, of course, the primary purpcse of fuel processing. In an MSR (see
Chapter 3), not all of these species remain in the salt that flows to
the reprocessing plant. The worst of the lot is *°°Xe, which is vir-
tually inscluble in the melt and is stripped by helium sparging within
the reactor itself. Noble and seminoble metals are largely deposited
within the primary heat exchanger and on other metal within the reactor
system. The serious neutron poisons that are delivered to the process-
ing plant, therefore, are primarily rare-earth isotopes dissolved as
trifivorides in the molten fuel. These, along with other less important
fission-product species, can be removed by extraction inte bismuth~lithium
alloy and subsequently transferred from that alloy into molten LiCl in a

separate processing circuit. Unfortunately, the wvaluable fuel constitu-

ents (uranium, protactinium, plutonium) all extract into bismuth-lithium

 

oJa

>~

Processing cycle time 1is the time required for processing a2 volume
of fuel salt equal te that contained in the reactor system; for the refer-
ence MSBR, the optimum appeared to be about ten days. Removal time for a
particular species is an effective cycle time equal to the processing cycle ¢
time divided by the fraction of that species removed during a pass through
the processing system.
Lo

alloy more readily than do the rare earths. Prior separation and re-
covery* of these materials must, accordingly, be part of the processing
scheme.

The processing system must, in addition, (1) maintain the fuel at
an acceptable redox potential (UF3/UF, ratio), (2) keep oxide and cor-
rosion products to tolerable levels in the fuel, (3) remove radioactive
species from any {gaseous) effluent streams, and {(4) place the recovered
fission products into waste forms suitable for at least temporary storage
at the reactor site.

Fuel processing for the MSBR was far from a demonstrated reality at
the termination of that effort,l’2 but all key separations had been re-
peatedly demonstrated individually on a small scale. Overall feasibility
seemed assured from a chemical viewpoint, but much work remained beafore
engineering feasibility could be assured.T The status and the remaining
pressing needs in processing R&D — and their relationships to those of

DMSR — are described in the following section.

Key Differences in Reactor Concepts

 

The fuel mixtures for the MSBR and DMSR are similar in many regards,*

and the overall processing concepts share many features. However, both
the fuel chemistryi and the processing differ in several important ways.

233Pa

A very important feature of MSBR processing was the removal of
from the fuel on a short cyele time (ten days) and its isolation in a
molten~-salt reservoir outside the reactor for decay there to essentially

2
pure 331

. This product was recovered by fluorination; that needed by
the reactor was reintroduced into the fuel, and the excess was stored for
sale and use elsewhere. The proliferation resistance imposed on a DMSR

for this study obviously necessitates abandonment of that portion of the

Uranium can be separated by flucrination to volatile UFg; protac—

tinium, plutonium, and transuranics other than neptunium cannot; however,
they can be recovered by prior extraction into diiuvte lithium-bismuth alloy.

stantial problems (see Chapter 5).

MSBR system. As a nontrivial consequence, such abandonment requires

that the DMSR have an alternative scheme for removal of fission-product

zirconium, which was sequestered (on the ten-day cycle time) with “°*Pa

in the MSBR processing plant and was discarded as waste after decay of :

the 2%3pa,

The MSBER produced very little Pu, Am, Np, and Cm; and since what
was produced was sequestered with the 233pa and discarded to waste with
the zirconium, the equilibrium fuel contained very small quantities of
these materials. The DMSR is a prolific producer of plutonium (though
at near equilibrium the plutonium is of relatively poor quality), and it
needs to burn the fissile plutonium isotopes as fuel. The DMSR process-
ing plant, therefore, needs to recover plutonium quantitatively and to
return it immediately (along with #33Pa) to the reactor. As a conse-

quence, DMSR fuel will contain much larger quantities of transuranic

isotopes than did the MSBR.

The DMSR will ncot breed and will not have excess fissile material
for removal and sale for use elsewhere. However, it is likely that in

U; this will, of ceourse, exist in a suitably

wilil generate an excess of
denatured state but some storage of it (on NaF beds within the reactor

containment) may be required until it is needed by the reactor.

Conceptual processes for the MSBR and DMSR, accordingly, employ
very similar unit processes. Uranium is largely recovered by fluorina-
tion to UF¢ and is returned immediately to the reactor fuel. In the DMSR,
protactinium, plutonium, and the transuranium nuclides are recovered by
selective extraction into dilute lithium-bismuth alloy and are immediately
returned to the reactor. In both concepts the rare-earth, alkaline-earth,
and alkali-metal fission products are selectively extracted into bismuth-
lithium alloy and subsequently transferred to molten LiCl for recovery
as waste. As in the case of fuel chemistry discussed above, the process- )

ing for the two reactors shows far more similarities than differences.

Post-1974 Advances

 

Both the proposed MSBR'!*? and the DMSR processes require removal of
uranium by fluorination from the fuel salt and from a waste salt before
discard. Removal from the MSBR fuel salt virtually requires* continuocus
fluorination, and such fluorination from the waste stream is desirable.
The salt streams in the reactor processing plant contain much radiocac-
tivity and are appreciable volumetric heat sources; cooling of the ves-
sel wall to form a frozen salt film without freezing the vessel contents
would certainly seem feasible. Tests with normal (nonirradiated) salt
mixtures must introduce this volumetric heat source artificially, and

110,111

this has proven to be difficult.T Repeated attempts to demon-

strate adequate frozen walls with nonradiocactive salt have been virtual

failures because of malfunction of the resistance heating systems.

Early studies'*® had shown that the sorption of UFg¢ in molten LiF-

BeF;-ThF, containing UFy by the reaction

assemblies both used mechanically agitated, nondispersing contactors®
to equilibrate molten salt and molten bismuth alloy. Both assemblies
were built of carbon steel, though a graphite liner was used in a por-
tion of one of the apparatuses.

In the first of these,
mass transfer of °°’U and °’Zr between LiF-BeF,-ThF, and bismuth as a
function of agitator speed and salt and metal flow rates. These studies
showed that the system could be readily operated, that mass—transfer
rates increased with agitator speed, and that mass-transfer rates in-
creased markedly with only minor phase dispersal. Although confirmation
is needed, these studies also suggested that some phase dispersal might
be tolerated without undue contaminatiocn of the fuel solvent with bismuth.

The more ambitious experimentIOG demonstrated (primarily with neo-

'*7Xd as tracer) the metal-transfer process for removal of

dymium, using
rare—earth fission products from melten LiF-BeF;-Thy into dilute bismuth-
lithium and their subsequent transfer to molten LiCl and then to concen-
trated bismuth~1ithium alloy. This process was demonstrated on a small
engineering scale [about 1% of the flows required for a ten-day processing
cycle on a 1000-MW(e) MSBR]. Separation of the rare earths from thorium
was demonstrated to be essentially that projected from laboratory-scale
studies.’” However, overall mass-transfer coefficients were lower than
would be required for full-scale metal-transfer process equipment of
reasonable size; this was particularly true of the two Bi-LiCl interfaces.

Such contactors, in which the phases are not dispersed, permit opera-
tion with higher ratios of one phase to the other. They should lead to
less entrainment of bismuth in salt, and they are simpler to fabricate than
are extraction columns. They also must be expected to show poorer mass
transfer characteristics.

Status of Technology

 

The chemical basis on which the processing system is founded is well
understood; however, only small engineering experiments have been carried

out to date and a considerable engineering development effort remains.

Chemical status

 

Fluorination and fuel reconstitution. Removal of uranium from mol-

 

ten fluoride mixtures by treatment with F» is well understood. Initial
studies at ORNL led to the Fused Salt Fluoride Volatility Program, and
batch fluorination of the irradiated Adircraft Reactor Experiment fuel was
successfully demonstrated.’'’ The studies culminated in the highly suc-
cessful recovery of uranium from various irradiated zirconium-, aluminum-,

118 which in some cases were processed as

119

and stainless steel-based fuels,
early as 30 days after fuel discharge. Uranium recoveries greater than
997 and uranium decontamination factors in excess of 10° were consistently
demonstrated. More recently the Fused Sait Flueride Volatility Process
was used for removal of the “°°U-?3%U mixture from the MSRE fuel salt at

1260

the MSRE site after the reactor had operated for about 1.5 years. This

operation was also highly successful, and the fuel carrier salt was sub-

233y and returned to the MSRE for an additional

sequently combined with
vear of operation. There is no doubt that essentially quantitative re-
covery of uranium can be accomplished 1f necessary and that many details

of fission-product behavior are well understood. Such flucrination also
serves to remove oxide and oxygenated compounds (via their conversion to
fluorides and 02) from the melt. However, for the MSBR a continuous fluocr-
inator {probably of nickel protected by a layer of frozen salt) is essen-
tial, and such a device is, at least, highly desirable for the DMSR.
Additional'study is needed to develop and demonstrate such a device.

Gas phase reduction of UFg to UFy by hydrogenation is a well-known
operation in the nuclear industry, and this process was initially consid-
ered applicable for the MSBR.!»? However, consideration of the difficul-
ties associated with equipment scale-down, UF4 product collection and
holdup, and remote operation prompted a search for a more direct means

for recombining UFs with molten fluoride mixtures. The known chemical
94

behavior suggested that UFg could be absorbed directly into molten salt
that contained UFy. Subsequent experiments verified that the absorption
reaction is rapid and that UFg can be combined quantitatively with mol-
ten fluorides containing UF4 with the simultaneous formation of inter-

The final reaction is relatively slow in equipment of goldl’z’121

but, as noted above, can be effectively catalyzed by platinum. Additiomal
study is needed to establish whether, for example, icdine fluorides, TeFg,

SeFg, etc., are absorbed by the strongly oxidized UFs solution.

Selective reductive extraction. Selective extracticn from molten

 

 

fluoride mixtures and from molten LiCl into lithium-bismuth alloys has

2,158

¥

been studied in detail for essentially all the pertinent elements. '’
Bismuth is a low-melting-point (271°C) metal that is essentially

immiscible with molten halide mixtures consisting of fluorides, chlorides,

and bromides. The vapor pressure of bigmuth in the temperature range of

interest (500 to 700°C) is negligible, and the solubilities of Li, Th,

U, Pa, and most of the fission precducts are adequate for processing ap-

plications. Under the conditions of interest, reductive extraction reac-

tions between materials in salt and metal phases can be represented by
 

 

the following reaction:
MXn(salt) + nLi(Bi) = M(Bi)} + nLiX(salt) ,

in which the metal halide MXn in the salt reacts with lithium from the
bismuth phase to produce M in the bismuth phase and the respective
lithium halide in the salt phase. The valence of M in the salt is +n,

515 thatr the

and X represents fluorine or chlorine. It has been found'»?
distribution coefficient D for metal M depends on the lithium concentra-

tion in the metal phase (mole fraction, X

Li) as follows:

log D = n log Xii + log K;

The quantity K; is dependent only on temperature, and the distribution

coefficient is defined by the relation

_ mole fraction of M in metal phase
mole fraction of MXn in salt phase

 

The ease with which one component can be separated from another is indi-
cated by the ratio of the respective distribution coefficients, that is,
the separation factor. As the separation factor approaches unity, sepa-
ration of the components becomes increasingly difficult. On the other
hand, the greater the deviation from unity, the easier the separation.
Distribution data have been obtained for many elements!*?21%91° he-
tween LiF-BeF,~ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) and bismuth-lithium and between
LiCl and bismuth-lithium. As Fig. 6.1 indicates, extraction from the
molten fluoride affords excellent separation of Zr, U, and Pa from Th
and the rare earths but relatively poor separation of the rare earths
from thorium. Plutonium, neptunium, and americium are slightly more ex-
tractable from the fluoride than is protactinium; curium is slightly less
extractable than protactinium. Figure 6.2 shows the quite different be-
havior when molten LiCl is used. Excellent separations of thorium from
the rare-earth and alkaline-earth elements can be made by use of LiCl.
The distribution coefficient for thorium is decreased sharply by the

addition of fluoride to the LiCl, although the distribution coefficients

nation of the LiCl with several mole percent fluoride will not affect the
removal of the rare earths but will cause a sharp increase in the thorium
removal rate. Data with LiBr are similar to those with LiCl, and the dis-
tribution behavior with LiCIl-LiBr mixtures would not be likely to differ

appreciably from the data with the pure materials.!??

fluorinator removes 99% of the uranium. The protactinium extraction con-
tactor is equivalent to five equilibrium stages. The bismuth flow rate
through the contactor is 8.2 em?/s (0.13 gpm), and the inlet thorium con-
centration in the stream is 907 of the thorium solubility at the operating
temperature of 640°C. The protactinium decay tank has a volume of 4.5 m®
(160 ft?®). The uranium inventory in the tank is less than 0.2% of that
in the reactor. Fluorides of Li, Th, Zr, and Ni accumulate in the tank
at a total rate of about 0.003 m®/d (0.1 ftg/day)ﬁ These materials are
removed by periodic withdrawal of salt to a final protactinium decay and
fluorination operation. The bismuth flow rate through the two upper con-
tactors in the rare-earth removal system is 790 em®/s (12.5 gpm), and the
LiCl flow rate is 2080 ecm’/s (33 gpm). Each contactor is equilivalent to
three equilibrium stages.

The trivalent and divalent rare earths are removed in separate con-

tactors in order to minimize the amount of lithium required. Only 27 of

 
 

 

99

the LiCl, or 42 ecm®/s (0.66 gpm), is fed to the two-stage divalent rare-
earth removal contactor, where it is contacted with a 2200-cm®/d (0.58-
gal/day) bismuth stream containing 50 at. % lithium. The trivalent strip-
per, where the LiCl is contacted with bismuth containing 5 at. 7 lithium,
is equivalent to one equilibrium stage.

The remaining steps in the flowsheet consist in combining the pro-
cessed salt with uranium and purifying the resulting fuel salt. The
uranium addition is accomplished by absorbing the UF¢-F; stream from the
fluorinators into fuel salt containing UFy, which results in the formation
of soluble UFs. The UFs is then reduced to UFy by contact with hydrogen.
The HF resulting from reduction of UFs is electrolyzed in order to recy-
cle the contained fluorine and hydrogen. These materials are recycled
to avoid waste disposal charges on the material that would be preduced
if the HF were absorbed in an aqueous solution of KOH.'?" The salt will
be contacted with nickel wool in the purification step in order to en-
sure that the final bismuth concentration is acceptably low.

The protactinium removal time obtained with the flowsheet is 10
days, and the rare-earth removal times range from 17 to 51 days, with
the rare earths of most importance being remcved on 27- to 30-day cycles.

123,125 indicate that the flowsheet is relatively insensi-

Calculations
tive to minor variations in operating conditions, such as changes in
temperature, flow rates, reductant concentrations, etc. However, as
noted earlier, contamination of the molten LiCl by fluoride markedly
increases extraction of thorium by the LiCl. It appears that up to 2
mole % of F~ in the LiCl (which would lead to loss of 7.7 g-moles of
thorium per day} may be tolerable.? It has been shown that treatment
of LiCl contaminated with F~ by BCli serves to volatalize BF3;; the F~
contamination should be easily removable,?»126

The reliable removal of decay heat from the processing plant is
an important consideration because of the relatively short decay time
before the salt enters the processing plant. A total of about 6 MW of
heat would be produced in the processing plant for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.
Since molten bismuth, fuel salt, and LiCl are not subject to radiolytic

degradation, there is not the usual concern encountered with processing

of short-decayved fuel.

gas—salt contactors was demonstrated previously in tests in a 0.12-
m-diam, 2.4-m-high simulated fluorinator in which molten salt, LiF-ZrF,
(66-34 mole %), and argon were countercurrently contacted. An internal
heat source in the molten region was provided by Calrod heaters contained
in a 3/4-in. IPS pipe along the centerline of the vessel. A frozen salt
layer was maintained in the system with equivalent volumetric heat gen-
eration rates of 353 to 1940 kW/m3° For comparison, the heat generation
rates in fuel salt immediately after removal from the reactor and after
passing through vessels having heldup times of 5 and 30 min are 2000,
950, and 420 kW/m®, respectively.?’

However, as noted previocusly, recent attempts to use autoresistance
heating of the nonradioactive test salt (so that no unprotected metal

would be present in the fluorinator) have proved disappointing.lloslll

N Interest in mildly agitated, nondispersing extractors has developed
because (1) they should be much simpler to build of difficult-to-fabri-
cate materials such as molybdenum or graphite and (2) they might be less
likely to entrain bismuth in salt or salt in bismuth. Whether these or
mecre conventional extraction columns are to be preferred is not yet
established.

for the reductive extraction process for protactinium isolation. The
facility would allow countercurrent contact of salt and bismuth streams
in various types of contactors at flow rates as high as about 25% of
those required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The facility would

r operate continuously and would allow measurement of mass transfer and

hydrodynamic data under steady-state conditioms.

- Bismuth removal and urapium valence adjustment. Entrained or dis- e
solved bismuth will have to be removed from the salt before it is re-
turned to the reactor, since nickel is quite soluble in bismuth (about
10 wt %) at the reactor operating temperature. Efforts tc measure the
solubility of bismuth in salt have indicated that the solubility is lower
than about 1 ppm, and the expected solubility of bismuth in the salt is
very low under the highly reducing conditions that will be used. It
appears that bismuth can be present at significant concentrations in
the salt only as entrained metallic bismuth. Sampling of salt from en-
gineering experiments indicated that the bismuth concentration in the
salt ranges from 10 to 100 ppm after countercurrent contact of the salt
and bismuth in a packed-column contactor; however, concentrations below
1 ppm are observed in salt leaving a stirred-interface, salt-metal con-
tactor in which the salt and metal phases are not dispersed.2

A natural-circulation loop constructed of Hastelloy N and filled
with fuel salt has been operated for about two yvears; a molybdenum cup
containing bismuth was placed near the bottom of the loop. To date,
the reported concentrations of bismuth in salt from the loop (<5 ppm)
are essentially the same as those reported for salt from a loop contain-
ing no bismuth. No degradation of metallurgical properties has been
noted on corrosion specimens removed from the loop containing bismuth.

Operating a MSR with a small fraction of the uranium present as
UF3 is advantageous in order to minimize corrosion reactions and the
oxidizing tendency of the fission process. The U3+/L’L++ ratio in the
MSRE was maintained at the desired level by reduction of vt with beryl-
lium metal, and a voltammetric method for the determination of this
ratio in the MSRE fuel was developed. The final step in the processing
plant will consist in continuousiy measuring and adjusting the U3+/U”+

ratio of the fuel salt returned to the reactor.

Special characteristics of DMSR fuel processing

The DMSR core will be larger than that of the MSBR, and the inven-
tory of fuel will be larger, probably by about twofold. The optimum
processing cycle time — or even the tolerable limits on it — is not yet .

well defined; however, the limits probably lie between 30 and 150 days.

 
 

 

103

If so, the DMSR will process a smaller volume of fuel per day than would
the MSBR. This is not, in itself, a real advantage since the equipment
was relatively small for the MSBR and will not be much cheaper in smaller
sizes. However, if long cycle times are tolerable to reactor neutronics,
batch operations might be possible at a few points (the fluorinators, for
example}.

Several of the special characteristics of the DMSR will affect the
processing operation to only a minor extent. The presence of plutonium
and the transuranic isotopes is such a characteristic. In the MSBR,
protactinium (plus zircoenium and what plutonium and transuranics were
present) was extracted into bismuth and immediately removed by hydro-
fluorination into the protactinium—isolation salt. In the DMSR these
species will be recovered by reduction into bismuth* and immediate re-
moval therefrom by oxidation+ into the reconstituted and purified fuel.

The higher uranium concentration (by about fivefold) will probably
mean that the quantity of UFg produced per unit time will be larger in
the DMSR than in the MSBR:; the quantity produced per unit of salt will
obviously be higher, and this may make the fuel reconstitution step more
difficult in practice.

A major difference from the conceptual MSBR process may well be
necessary to effect a reasonable removal of fission-product zirconium
from the DMSR. Zirconium is not an important nuclear poison, and ZrFy
at low concentrations should affect the fuel properties trivially. How-
ever, ZrFu in the fuel must be reduced and oxidized each time the fuel
is processed, and the reduction requires expensive "Li. Zirconium is
the most readily reduced of all the pertinent elements (see Fig. 6.1)
and it can probably be separated from plutenium and protactinium with
some difficulty by selective extraction. If sc, it can be removed —
on some reasonable c¢ycle time — by an additional extraction circuit.
Zirconium cannot be reasonably separated from uranium by selective ex-

traction, but uranium lost with the zirconium can readily be recovered

 

Plutonium and the transuranics (except curium) are more readily
extracted than is protactinium. Quantitative recovery cf protactinium

will ensure quantitative recovery of plutonium.

If the DMSR is to operate with “10Z of the uranium reduced, it seems
reasonable to use a part of the bismuth alloy to reduce UFy to UFj.
104

by fluorination. There is little doubt that a better method for removal g
of zirconium is desirable for the DMSR, and some R&D on this should be

done. Possibly, the very stable intermetallic compounds that zirconium

forms with platinum-group metals may offer such a possi,b;i,l:i;ty.“L”135
All other separations processes — and the associated R&D — would

seem very similar to those required for the MSBR. A preliminary concep-

tual flowsheet for the DMSR'*® is shown as Fig. 6.4.

Possible processing alternatives

 

137 appeared to show that protactinium could be

Small-scale studies
oxidized to pa’t by treatment of the LiF-BeF,-ThFy melt with HF and that
the protactinium could then be precipitated as very insoluble Pa»Cs.

Thus it was possible that protactinium could be selectively removed from
the salt without prior removal of the uranium. Removal of protactinium
as Pa»0s might have been a viable alternative for the MSBR, where isola-
tion of this nuclide was a major requirement, but precipitation of only
Pa;0s5 would be of no value to the DMSR. However, it is possible to pre-
cipitate a solid solution of (Th,U)0., containing a very high concentra-
tion (>95 mole %) of U0z, by deliberate addition of oxide ion to the MSBR

5+, its oxide would, of

fuel.’® If the protactinium were oxidized to Pa
course, also be precipitated. 1If, in addition, plutonium were oxidized
to Pu'Tt (this oxidation is more difficult® and a small concentration of
dissolved F2 might be required), Pu0; would also be included in the solid
solution. Whether americium, neptunium, and curium could be made to pre-
cipitate as oxides is not vyet known.

Engineering studies of uranium oxide precipitation have been car-
ried out;l38 the studies involved the contact of 2 liters of MSBR fuel
salt with Hy0~Ar gas mixtures in a 100-mm-diam nickel precipitator. Ex-
periments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 540 to 630°C, and
the composition of the HyO0-Ar mixture was varied from 10 to 35% water.
The values for the water utilization were uniformly low (about 10 to

15%) and did not vary with the composition of the gas stream. Samples

of the oxide contained about 90% UQ; even though, at the lower uranium

concentrations in the salt, the solid in equilibrium with the salt would
contain 50% U0, or less. This enhancement of the uranium concentration
in the sclid phase appears to allow precipitation of 997 of the uranium
as a solid containing 857% U02 in a single-stage batch precipitator. The
oxide precipitate was observed to settle rapidly, and more than 907% of
the salt could be separated from the oxide by simple decantation.' Thus ¢
an oxide precipitation scheme could possibly recover together the U, Pa,
and Pu, along with a small amount of Th, as oxides. These could then be
returned to the purified fuel solvent (by hydrofluorination) for return
to the reactor. It would be necessary, of course, to remove residual 0*
from the fuel solvent before the rare-earth removal step. If processing
of a DMSR on a cycle time of 100 days or more is practicable (processing
rate of <1 m® of salt per day), such an oxide precipitation might be
used as a batch operation.¥
We know of no method for rare-earth removal that is comparable to
the reductive—extraction—metal-transfer process. Many attempts have
been made to find lon-exchange systems capable of removal of rare-earth
ions from LiF-BeF; and Li¥F-BeF,-Th¥, mixtures. All but a very few such
materials are unstable in contact with the salts. The only stable one
known to have ion-exchange capabilities is Cels3, which will exchange
Cet for other rare-earth ions,zQ but it is too soluble in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
to be genuinely usefu1.+ The fuel solvent, partially freed from other
rare earths but saturated with CeFs, could possibly be freed from cerium

* and precipitation of Ce0;. If so, the resulting

by oxidation to Ce"
LiF-BeF,-ThFy would again have to be treated to remove excess 0*~ before
its return (with the valuable fissile and fertile constituents) to the
reactor,

Several combinations of the preferred processes with some of the
alternatives are possible. Their attractiveness increases as the per-
missible processing cycle time lengthens. It seems certain, however,

that all are less attractive than that represented by the reference MSBR

unit processes.

 

el

Solids handling is axiomatically more difficult than fluids hand- .
ling, especially in continucus operations.

Cerium is an appreciable neutron absorber.

Primary R&D Needs

 

The primary needs, with relatively few exceptions, are for sound

engineering tests of individual process steps and ultimately for rela-

tively long-term and near full-scale integrated tests of the system as

a whole. For the former tests the facilities needed are relatively mod-

est, though test equipment and instrumentation are quite complex. For

the integrated tests a special engineering laboratory will be required

and an integrated process test facility must be provided with appropriate

consideration of the need to demonstrate remote maintenance. Specific

needs include

1.

Determination by computer calculation, in close coordination with
reactor neutronics studies, the permissible range of (and the op-
timum) processing cycle times and removal times.

Demonstration of frozen-wall fluorination of uranium on a batch,
and, hopefully, on a continucus, basis. Determination of behaviocr
of neptunium in this fluorinatiom.

Demonstration of adequate UFg¢ abscrption in LiF-BeF,;-ThF,;-UFy; mix-
ture and suitable reduction to UFy and to 7 to 10% UF3;. Determina-
tion of behavior of an NpFg in absorption system.

Development and demenstration of a method for removal (by selective
extraction or otherwise) of fission-product zirconium from the fuel.
Demonstration of quantitative recovery of protactinium and plutonium
by selective extraction on a scale at least 25% of that required
for a DMSR. Determination of efficiency of recovery of americium,
neptunium, and curium in that extraction.

Betermination of behavior of TeFy, SeFg, IFs5, etc., in the UFg ab-
sorption step.

Demonstration of retention of TeFg, SeFg, Iz, etc., from the UFg
absorption off-gas.

Demonstration of adequate removal of rare-earth, alkaline-earth, and
alkali-metal fission products in a complete metal-transfer system.
Demonstration of hydrofluorination of zirconium, rare-earth, etc.,

fission products into waste salt for storage.
108

10. Demonstration of the application of bismuth containing U, Zr, Pa,
Pu, Th, Li, etc., for valence adijustment of fuel salt.

11. Demonstration of adequate removal of bismuth (by absorption on
nickel or gold weol) from salt for return to the reactor.

12. Operation of the entire integrated system reliably for moderate to
long times with realistic construction materials and reasonable con-
centrations of species at tracer level activity (where possible).
Assessment of overall performance, achievable oxide concentration,

effect of system upset on fissile losses to waste, etc.

Estimates of Scheduling and Costs

 

Preliminary estimates of the necessary schedule and of its operating
and capital funding requirements are presented below for the fuel pro-
cegssing development described above. As elsewhere in this document, it
has been assumed that (1) the program would begin at start of ¥FY 1980,
(2) it would lead to an operating DMSR in 1995, and (3) the R&D program
will produce no great surprises and no major changes in program direc-
tion will be required.

The schedule, along with the dates on which key developments must
be finished and major decisions made, is shown in Table 6.1. It seems
certain that the overall R&D programs (including those described else-
where in this document) will provide some minor surprises and that some
changes in this development effort will be required. No specific pro-
visions for this are included; but, unless major revisions become neces-—
sary in the middle 1980s, it appears likely that suitable chemical pro-
cesses and processing equipment could be recommended onr this schedule.

The operating funds (Table 6.2) and the capital equipment require-
ments {Table 6.3) are shown on a year-by-year basis in thousands of 1978
dollars. ©No allowance for contingencies, major program changes, and
inflation during the interval have been provided. As with the develop-
ment of materials for chemical processing (Chap. 5), much of this effort
could be deferred if a decision were made to delay the development of a

break-even fuel cycle for the DMSR.

PART IV. REACTOR MATERIALS

H. E. McCoy

The material for the primary circult will be exposed at temperatures
up to 700°C to fuel salt containing fission products and to irradiation
by primarily thermal neutrons. A nickel-base alloy, Hastelloy N, has
been demonstrated to be reasonably serviceable under these conditions,
but it was embrittled by irradiation and suffered shallow intergranular
embrittlement by the fission product tellurium. There is considerable
experimental evidence that small modifications to the chemical composi-
tion of Hastelloy N results in improved resistance to neutron and fis-
sion-product embrittlement, and the materials program described in this
plan is directed toward developing and commercializing a modified com-
positicn of Hastelloy N with impreved properties.

The graphite moderator for an MSR must be capable of withstanding
neutron fluences of at least 3 X 10%? neutrons/cm®. Commercial graphites
exist which are likely to meet this goal, but further testing will be re-
guired to fully characterize these materials. There is also considerable
evidence that graphite with improved dimensional stability can be de-
veleped. Methods for manufacturing these impreoved materials must be
developed and the products irradiated and characterized. The improved

materials must be scaled up by a commercial wvendor.

7. STRUCTURAL METAL FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CIRCUITS

The material used in constructing the primary circuit of an MSR
will operate at temperatures up to 700°C. The inside of the circuit
will be exposed to salt containing fission preducts and will receive a
maximum thermal fluence of about 1 X 10%1 neutrons/cm2 over the operat-
ing lifetime of about 30 years. This fluence will cause embrittlement
due to helium formed by transmutation but will not cause swelling such
as is noted at higher fast fluences, The outside of the primary circuit
will be exposed to nitrogen containing sufficient gir from inleakage to
make it oxidizing to the metal. Thus the metal must have moderate oxi-
dation resistance, must resist corrosion by the salt, and must not be
subject to severe embrittlement by thermal neutrons.

In the secondary circuit the metal will be exposed to the coclant
salt under much the same conditions described for the primary circuit.
The main difference will be the absence of fission preoducts and uranium
in the coolant salt and the much lower neutron fluences. This material
must have moderate oxidation resistance and must resist cerrosion by a
salt not ccntaining fission products or uranium. |

The primary and secondary circuits involve numerous structural shapes
ranging from a few inches thick to tubing having wall thicknesses of only
a few thousandths of an inch. These shapes must be fabricated and joined,
primarily by welding, into an integral engineering structure. The struc-
ture must be designed and built by techniques approved by the ASME Boiler

and Pressure Vessel Code.

Status in 1972

Early materials studies led to the development of a nickel-base
alloy, Hastelloy N, for use with fluoride salts. As shown in Table 7.1,
the alloy contained 167 molybdenum for strengthening and chromium suf-
ficient to impart moderate oxidation resistance in air but not enough to
lead to high corrosion rates in salt. This alloy was the sole structural
material used in the MSRE and contributed significantly to the success

of the experiment. However, two problems were noted with Hastelloy N

Single values are maximum amcunts allowed. The actual

which needed further attention before more advanced reactors could be
built. First, it was found that Hastelloy N was embrittled by helium
produced from '°B and directly from nickel by a twc-step reaction. This
type of radiation embrittlement is commen to most iron- and nickel-base
alloys. The second problem arose from the fission-product tellurium dif-
fusing a short distance into the metal along the grain boundaries and
embrittling the boundaries.

When cur studies were terminated in early 1973, considerable prog-
ress had been made in finding sclutions to both problems. Since the two
problems were discovered a few years apart, the research on the two prob-
lem areas appears to have proceeded independently. However, the work
must be breught together for the production of a single material that
would be resistant to both problems. It was found that the carbide pre- .
cipitate that normally occcurs in Hastelloy N could be modified to obtain
resistance to the embrittlement by helium. The presence of 167 molybde-

num and 0.5% silicon led to the formation of a8 coarse carbide that was
 

 

125

of little benefit. Reduction of the molybdenum concentration teo 127 and
the silicon content to 0.17 and the addition of a reactive carbide former
such as titanium led to the formation of a fine carbide precipitate and
an alloy with good resistance to embrittlement by helium. The desired
level of titanium was about 2%, and the phenomenon had been checked out
through numercus small laboratory and commercial melts by 1972.

Because the intergranular embrittlement of Hastellcy N by tellurium
was noted in 1970, our understanding of the phenomenon was not wvery ad-
vanced at the conclusion of the program in 1973. Numerous parts of the
MSRE were examined, and all surfaces exposed to fuel salt formed shallow
intergranular cracks when strained. Some laboratory experiments had
been performed in which Hastelloy N specimens had been exposed to low
partial pressures of tellurium metal wvapor and, when strained, formed
intergranular cracks very similar to those noted in parts from the MSRE.
Several findings indicated that tellurium was the likely cause of the
intergranular embrittlement, and the selective diffusion of tellurium
along the grain boundaries of Hastelloy N was demonstrated experimentally.
One in-reactor fuel capsule was operated in which the grain boundaries of
Hastelloy N were embrittled and those of Inconel 601 (Ni, 227% Cr, 12% Fe)
were not. These findings were in agreement with laboratory experiments
in which these same metals were exposed to low partial pressures of tel-
lurium metal vapor. Thus, at the close of the program in early 1973,
tellurium had been identified as the likely cause of the intergranular
embrittlement, and several laboratory and in-reactor methods were de-
vised for studying the phenomenon. Experimental results had been ob-
tained which showed variations in sensitivity to embrittlement of
various metals and offered encouragement that a structural material
could be found which resisted embrittlement by tellurium.

The alloy composition favored at the close of the program in 1973
is given in Table 7.1 with the composition of standard Hastelloy N. The
reasoning at that time was that the 27 titanium addition would impart
good resistance to irradiation embrittlement and that the 0 to 27% nio-
bium addition would impart good resistance to intergranular tellurium
embrittlement. Neither of these chemical additions was expected to

cause problems with respect to fabrication.
126
Status in 1976 ,\",

When the program was restarted in 1974, top priority was given to
the tellurium-embrittlement problem. A small piece of Hastelloy N foil
from the MSRE had been preserved for further study. The foil was broken
inside an Auger spectrometer and the fresh surface analyzed. Tellurium
was found in abundance, and no other fission product was present in de-
tectable quantities. This showed even more positively that tellurium
was responsible for the embrittlement.

Considerable effort was spent in seeking better methods of exposing
test specimens to tellurium. In the MSRE the flux of the tellurium atoms

reaching the metal was 10° atoms cm™? sec™ and this value would be 10!°

atoms cm™° sec”! for a high-performance breeder. Even the value for a
high-performance breeder is very small from the experimental standpoint.
For example, this flux would result in a total of 7.6 X% 10”8 g of
tellurium transferred to a sample having a surface area of 10 em? in
1000 hry. Electrochemical probes were immersed directly in salt melts
known to contain tellurium, and there was never any evidence of a soluble
telluride species. However, there was considerable evidence that tel-
lurium "moved" through salt from cne point to another in a salt system. -
It was hypothesized that the tellurium actually moved as a low-pressure,
pure-metal vapor and not as a reacted species. The most representative
experimental system developed for exposing metal specimens to tellurium
involved suspending the specimens in a stirred vessel of salt with gran-
ules of CriTey and CrsTeg lying on the bottom of the salt. Tellurium,
at a very low partial pressure, was in equilibrium with the CriTe, and
CrsTeg, and exposure of Hastelloy N specimens to this mixture resulted
in crack severities similar to those noted in samples from the MSRE,
Numerous samples were exposed to salt containing tellurium, and
the most important finding was that modified Hastelloy N containing 1
to 2% nicbium had good resistance to embrittlement by tellurium (Fig.
7.1). An almost equally important finding was that the presence of ti-
tanium negated the beneficial effects of niobium. Thus, an alloy con-

taining titanium, to impart resistance to irradiation embrittlement, and

niobium, to impart resistance to tellurium embrittlement, did not have

acceptable resistance to tellurium embrittlement, even though the mech- e
anical properties in the irradiated condition were excellent. As a re-

sult, it became necessary to determine whether alloys containing niobium

(without titanium) had adequate resistance to irradiation embrittlement.

There was time only to obtain the alloys and run one irradiation experi-

ment, but the results loocked very promising. An alloy containing 2% .
niobium and irradiated at 704°C was about 30% stronger than standard

Hastelley N and had a fracture strain of about 3% compared with <1% for

standard Hastelloy N. Even though alloys modified sclely with nicbium

do not have as good postirradiation properties as alloys modified with

titanium or titanium plus niobium, their properties are probably adequate.

The niobium-modified alloys were not made in melts larger than 50
1b, but no problems were encountered in this size with niobium concen-
trations up to and including 4.4%. Test welds made in the 1/2-in.-thick
plate passed the bend and tensile tests required by the ASME Boiler and
Pressure Vessel Code. From the chemical analysis of the niobium-modified
alloy, no scaleup problems are anticipated.

One series of experiments was carried out to investigate the ef-
fects of oxidation state on the tendency for cracks to be formed in
tellurium-containing salt, on the supposition that the salt might be
made reducing enough to tie the teilurium up in some innocuous metal
complex. The salt was made more oxidizing by adding NiF,; and more re-
ducing by adding beryliium. The experiment had electrochemical probes
for determining the ratio of uranium in the +4 state (UF4) to that in
the +3 state (UF3). Tensile specimens of standard Hastelloy K were
suspended in the salt for about 260 hr at 700°C. The oxidation state
of the salt was stabilized, and the specimens were inserted so that each
set of specimens was exposed to one condition. After exposure, the spec-
imens were strained to failure and were examined metallographically to
determine the extent of cracking. The results of measurements at several
oxidation states are shown in Fig. 7.2. At U*T/U3* ratios of 60 or less,
there was very little cracking, and at ratios above 80 the cracking was
very extensive. These observations offer encouragement that a reactor
could be operated in a chemical regime where the tellurium would not be

embrittling even to standard Hastelloy N. At least 1.6% of the uranium

would need to be in the +3 oxidation state (UF:), and this condition seems
quite reasonable from chemical and practical considerations.

One further accomplishment during the period 1974—76 was the use of
available data to predict the helium yvield from interaction of nickel
with thermal neutrons. It has been known for some time that iron- and
nickel-base alloys can be embrittled in a thermal neutren flux by the

transmutations of "tramp" *°B to helium and lithium. This process gen-

erally results in the transmutation of most of the 10g by fluences of
thermal neutrons on the order of 10°%°/cm® and usually yields from 1 to
10 at. ppm of helium. With nickel there is a further thermal two-step

transmutation involving these reactions:
5 *
SNi 4+ m > PINi
Ige t
“9Ni + n > “He + °%Fe .

This sequence of reactions does not saturate, and although the cross
sections are still in question, it would produce a maximum of 40 at. ppm
of helium in the vessel over a 30-year MSBR lifetime. This is not an
unreasonable amount of helium to accommodate in the type of microstruc-

ture being developed in modified Hastelloy N.
130
Current Status

At the close of the program in 1976 (and at the present time), the
third alloy composition shown in Table 7.1 was favored. Considerable
progress had been made in establishing test methods for evaluating a ma-
terial's resistance to embrittlement by tellurium. Modified Hastelloy N
containing from 1 to 37 niobium was found to offer improved resistance to
embrittlement by tellurium, but the test conditions were not sufficiently
long or diversified to show that the alloy totally resists embrittlement.
One irradiation experiment showed that the niobium-modified ailoy offered
adequate resistance to irradiation embrittlement, but more detailed tests
are needed. Several small melts containing up to 4.4% niobium were found
to fabricate and weld well; so products containing 1 to 2% niobium can

probably be produced with a minimum of scale-up difficulties.

Technology Needs and Development Plan

 

The coverall development needs were described previously, but the
new findings shift the emphasis from alloys modified with titanium and
rare earths to those modified with niobium. The specific techneclogy
needs are identified in Table 7.2, along with a potential schedule for
their development. The first task will involve irradiation, corrosion,
tellurium exposure, mechanical property, and fabrication tests to final-
ize the composition for scale-up. The techniques for doing most of these
tests have already been established.

The second task will inveclve procuring large commercial heats of the
reference alloy. The material would be procured in structural shapes
ranging from plate to thin-wall tubing, typical of the products to be
used in a reactor. The third task consists in evaluating these materi-
als by mechanical property and cerrosion tests of at least 10,000-hr
duration. The two main purpeses of these tests would be to confirm the
adequacy of the new alloy for reactor applications and to gather the
data needed for reactor design. The fourth task would be to develop
the design methods and rules needed to design a reactor tc be built of
the modified Hastelloy N. This task will have already been partially

completed by ASME Pressure Vessel Code work currently in progress. The

final product of this task would be inclusion of modified Hastelloy N
into the high-temperature Code.

Although the data gathered in the third task (tests of 10,000-hr
duration) will probably be adequate for Code approval, it will be de-
sirable to continue some of the mechanical property and corrosion tests
for longer times. The continuation of these tests in the fifth task will &
improve confidence in design rules and will allew last-minute changes in
reactor operating parameters if necessary.

Although the work in the first five tasks should result in an al-
loy adequate for construction of MSRs, it is likely that further alloy
development would lead to materials having improved characteristics
which may allow a higher reactor-outlet salt temperature or significant
relaxation of design and operating constraints. It is this further al-
loy optimization which will comprise the sixth task.

8. GRAPHITE FOR MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS

The graphite in a single-fluid MSR serves no structural purpose®
cther than to define the flow patterns of the salt and, of course, to
! support its own weight. The requirements on the material are dictated
most strongly by nuclear considerations, namely stability of the mate-
rial against radiation-induced distortion and nonpenetrability by the
fuel-bearing molten salt. The practical limitations of meeting these
requirements, in turn, impose conditions on the core design, specifi-
cally the necessity to limit the cross-~sectional area of the graphite
prisms. The requirements of purity and impermeability te salt are
easily met by several high-quality, fine-grained graphites, and the
main problems arise from the requirement of stability against radiation-

induced distortion.

Status in 1972

By the time the MSBR Program was cancelled in early 1973, the di-
mensional changes of graphite during irradiation had been studied for
a number of years. These changes depend largely on the degree of crys-
talline isotropy, but the volume changes fall into a rather consistent
pattern. As shown in Fig. 8.1, there is first a period of densification
during which the volume decreases and then a period of swelling in which
the volume increases. The first period is of concern only because of the
dimensional changes that occur, and the second period is of concern be-
cause of the dimensional changes and the formation of cracks. The forma-
tion of cracks would eventually allow salt to penetrate the graphite,
The data shown in Fig. 8.1 are for 715°C, and the damage rate increases
with increasing temperature. Thus the graphite section size should be
kept small enough to prevent temperatures in the graphite from exceeding
those in the salt by a wide margin.

In the breeder concept the neutron flux is sufficiently high in the

[

central region of the core to require that the graphite be replaced about

every four years. It was further required that the graphite be surface

Its primary function is, of course, to provide neutron moderation.

sealed to prevent penetraticn of xenon intoc the graphite. Since re-
placement of the graphite would require considerable downtime, there
was strong incentive to increase the fluence limit of the graphite. A
considerable part of the ORNL graphite program was spent in irradiating

commercial graphites and samples of special graphites with potentially

improved irradiation resistance. The approach taken te sealing the

graphite was surface sealing with pyrocarbon. Because of the neutronic

 
137

requirements, other substances could not be introduced in sufficient

 

quantity to seal the surface.

The irradiation studies with several grades of graphite revealed
that the so-called binderless graphites, e.g., POCCO AXF, had improved
dimensional stability over most of the conventional graphites (Fig. 8.2).
The POCC graphites are presently available only in small sections, but
the GLCC B-364 grade is available in large sectiomns. The GLCC H-364 grade
has almost as high an allowable fluence as POCO AXF. Further work on
several special grades of graphite made at ORNL showed that graphites
could be developed with fluence limits even greater than those of the
POCO grades.
| The pyrolytic sealing work was only partially successful. It was
found that extreme care had tc be taken to seal the material before ir-
radiation. During irradiation the injected pyrocarbon actually caused
expansion to begin at lower fluences than those at which it would occur

in the absence of the coating. Thus the coating task was faced with a

number of challenges.

Status in 1976 R

No work was undertaken on graphite during the last segment of the

program. Thus the status in 1976 was the same as that in 1972.

Current Status

With the relaxed requirements® for breeding performance in nonpro-
liferating MSRs relative to the MSBR, the requirements for the graphite
have diminished. First, the peak neutron flux in the core can be re-
duced to levels such that the graphite will last for the lifetime of
the reactor plant. Secondly, the salt flow rate through the core is
reduced from the turbulent regime, and the salt film at the graphite
surface may offer sufficient registance to xenon diffusicon sc that it
will net be necessary to seal the graphite. The lessened gas permea-
bility requirements also mean that the graphite damage limits can be
raised (Figs. 8.1 and 8.2). The lifetime criterion adopted for the
breeder was that the allowable fluence would be about 3 % 10?% neutrons/
em’. This was estimated to be the fluence at which the structure in
advanced graphites would contain sufficient cracks to be permeable to g
xenon. Experience has shown that even at volume changes of about 10%
the graphite is not cracked but is uniformly dilated. For nomprolifer-
ating devices where xenon permeability will not be of concern, the limit
will be established by the formation of cracks sufficiently large for
salt intrusion. It is likely that current technology graphites like
GLCC+ E-364 could be used to 3 X 10°? neutrons/cm® and that improved

graphites with a limit of 4 X 10°?? neutrons/cm? could be developed.

Further Technology Needs and Development Plan

 

The near-term goal of the future development program (see Table 8.1)

will be to evaluate current commercial graphites for MSR use (Task 1).

This will involve irradiation of promising commercial graphites with
subsequent measurements of dimensional stability and thermal and elec-
trical conductivity.

A longer—range goal will be the development of a graphite with an
improved fluence I1imit. Efforts to date show that graphites can be
tailored to have improved dimensional stability. In Task 2 this work
will be continued te obtain several improved products, which will be
irradiated and evaluated. The technology for making the most desirable
products will be passed on to commercial vendors, and large lots of
these graphites will be obtained (Task 3). The commercial graphites
will be irradiated to high fluences, and the changes in dimensions, pore
spectra, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and electrical conduc~
tivity will be measured (Task 4).

The operating and capital equipment costs fer this work are sum-

marized in Tables 8.2 and 8.3, respectively.
