- DESIGN AND COST STUDY OF A
FLUORINATION--REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION—-METAL
TRANSFER PROCESSING PLANT FOR THE MSER

W, L. Carter = E L. Nicholson
ABSTRACT

A preliminary design study and cost estimate were made

- for an integrated processing plant to continuously treat

irradisted LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel salt from a 1000-Mi(e).

-single-fluid, molten-salt breeder reactor, The salt is
. treated by the fluorination--reductive extraction--metal

transfer process to recover and recycle uranium and carrier
salt, to isolate R33pg for decay, and to concentrate fis-
sion products in waste media. For a plant that processes
the active inventory (1683 fts) of reactor fuel on a 10-day
cycle the direct costs were estimated to be $21 million and
indirect costs were $15 million for a total investment of
$36 million, Allowances for site, site preparation, and
buildings plus facilities shared with the reactor are not
included since these costs are included in the overall cost
of the power station, The net fuel cycle cost for process-
ing on a 10-day cycle at 80% plant factor was estimated to

‘be 1,1 mills/kWhr; this includes credit for a 3. 3%/yr yield

of bred fuel, The capital investment wés not strongly in-
fluenced by processing rate, A plant to process the 1000-
MW(e) reactor on a 3. 3 day cycle was estimated to cost $L8
mllllon.

A 0.9-gpm stream of fuel salt flows directly from the

- reactor to the processing plant, and, after about 30 min-

utes holdup for’ ‘decay of short-lived fission products, the

~salt flows to a fluorinator where approximately 95%.of the
~ uranium is removed, The salt is then contacted with bis-
. -muth containing metallic lithium reductant to extract *>°Pa
~ end the remaining uranium, which are hydrofluorlnated from

the bismuth into a captive salt phase and held for **®Ps

decay. - The U- and Pa-free salt is treated in & second ex-

tractor with additionel Bi-Ii solution to remove most of

_the rare earth fission products which are isolated via the

~ metal transfer operation in Bi-Ii alloys and held for decay
"~ Finally, the rare earths are hydrofluorlnated into a waste -
- salt for disposal,, : \ . :

Fuel salt is reconstltued by redu01ng recycle UF from

fhé fluorinator directly into the purified LiF-BeF -ThF4

carrier, Gaseous reaction products (HF and excess Hé) from
UF reduction are treated to remove volatile fission products
and recycled. A portion of the HF is electrolyzed to provide

- F, for fluorlnatlon.

 
 

 

. Reductive extraction and metsl trensfer operations are
carried out at about 6L0°C; fluorlnatlon and hydrofluorina-
tion can be conducted at 550 600°C, ~ Molybdenum is the
assumed construction material for vessels that conteined.
molten bismuth and bismuth-salt mixtures; Hastelloy N was
used for vessels oontalning only molten fluoride salt

SUMMARY

An essential objective of the design &nd devélopmental'sffort on &

essing method for the irradiated fﬁel | As procossihg development'advancés .
in the laboratony and on an englneerlng scele, it is informative to relate
the oonoeptual process to the operation of the reactor and to the cost of
producing power, We have made & preliminary de51gn and oost estimate for
& processing plant that uses the fluorlnation—-reductlve extraction—-metal
transfer process to determine capital 1nvestment and fuel cycle costs,
Our study was for an integrated processing facility for treating irradi-
' ated LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel from a single-fluid, 1000-Mi(e) MSER on a
'10-day cycle., The estimated capital and fuel cycle costs are:

The costs are for installed process equipment, piping, instrumentation,
.thermal,insﬁlation, electrical supply, sempling stations, and various |
auxiliary equipment including pumps, electricel heaters, refrigeration
system, and process'gas:supply and purification‘Systems. The estimate |
does not include site, site preparation, and building costs er the cost

of facilities and equipment Shared'with the_reector plantj these costs

are included in the overall cost of the power station, - Installed spare
equipment and redundant cooling circuits for fail-safe design are also

not included Molybdenum was the aSSumed éonstrucﬁiOn naterial for all
equipment that contained blsmuth or blsmuth-salt maxtures, Hastelloy N

was used for vessels that contalned only molten salt

.‘Irrad;ated fuel ;s removed contlnuously from the reactor'and held
~ about 30 minutes for decay of short-lived fission products (see Fig. 1).
- Most of tne-nraniumisithen removed_ﬁ& fluorinaﬁion.end is qnickly're- |
cycled by reduction with hydrogen into-previously processed salt that is
returning to'the'reactor. Tne salt is then contaeted'in an extractien
column with bismuth contalnlng about 0,2 at.% lithium metal and 0,25 at,®
thorium metal reductants to extract protactinlum, zirconium, and the
remaining uranium, The uranium- and protactlnlum-free salt flows to a
second extraction colum where & large portion of the rare earths, al-
kaline earths, and alkali metel fission products are extracted by further
contact wifh'Bi-Li reductant. Some thorium is also extracted, The salt
is then'recenstifuted.nith recycle and makeup nraninm, treated to remove
entrained bismnth c°rros10n products, end suspended particulates.’ The

The bismuth effluent'frbn the‘firS£aextrsctionveolumn'is hydroflu-'
orinated in the presence -of reclrculatlng LJ.F-Tth,-ZrF4 PaF4 salt to
oxidize 253Pa, uranium, and zirconium to soluble fluorides which dissolve
'1n the salt; unused llthlum ‘and thorium reductants also transfer to the
salt, The clean bismuth recelves makeup reductant and returns to the
process. Protactinium-233 is isolated from the rest pf the process in |
. the salt phase and held for deeay. To avoid 2 large uranium inventory,

the protactinium decay salt is fluorinated on a one-day cycle, and,

every 220 days, about 25 ft° of the salt is withdrawn, held for 2>Pa
decay, fluorinated, and'disCarded to purge accumulated fission products,

LiF, ThF4,'and some corrosion prcducts. The F,-UFg stream from this

fluorinator contains uranium of the highest isotcpic purity in the proc-

essing plant; therefore,“a pcrtion of this stream is withdrawn to remove:

excess uranium above that required to refuel the reactor,

Fissicn;products removed from the carrier selt in the second extrac-
tion column are transferred from—Bi4Li solution to molten lithium chloride;
however, the distribution coefficient for thorium between LiCl and Bi-Li
solution is much lower'than'that of the rare earths and uery little tho-
rium transfers, The lithium'chloride-circulates_ih a closed loop,vand'
is treated in two steps to isolate the rare earths'ahdvalkaline earths,
The'entire LiCl stream is contacted with Bi-5 at.% Li alldy to strip

trivalent rare earths into the metal; about two percent of this treated

stream is then Stripped.uith Bi-50 at,% Li alloy to remove divalent rare

earths and alkaline earths, Alkali metals (rubidium, cesium) remain in

the llthlum chloride and are removed by occa51onally dlscardlng a small

 volume of the salt. FlSSlon products bulld up in the two Bi-Li alloys

and are purged,perlodlcally by hydrofluorlnatlng relatively small volumes
of each alloy in the presence of a molten waste salt.
Large fractions‘of some classes. of fission products (noble gases,

noble and seminoble metals) are presumed to be removed from the fuel salt

'1n the reactor, and for these, the process1ng plant is not designed to

handle the MSBR'S full productlon. Noble gases are sparged from the
01rcu1at1ng fuel in the reactor wlth inert gas on a 50 sec cycle, and
noble and semlnoble metals are expected to plate out on reactor and heat
exchanger surfaces on a relatlvely short cycle. A removal cycle time of

2.l hours was used for. thls study Since this cycle is Short compared

" to 10-day proce551ng qycle tlme, only about 0.1% of ‘these metals are

removed in the process1ng plant Halogenous flSSlon products are vola-

tilized in fluorination and are. removed from the process gas by scrubblng

| w1th aqueous caustlc solutlon after uranlum has been recovered

The capltal cost for the fluorlnatlon-areductlve extractlon--metal

transfer proce331ng plant is not strongly affected by throughput The

 
 

 

 

direct,_indirect, and total plant investments were $28;5'million;.$2b.0h1
million,randt$h8.5h1 million respectively:for a plant to process a 1000-
“Mi(e) MSBR.on a 3.33-day.cyole. The scale factor for capital cost versus |
| throughput is 0,28 for a’range of processing qycle times from 3 to 37 days.

Although con51derable knowledge has been galned in recent years on
processing molten fluoride salts, the current concept still has & number
of ‘major uncertalntles and problem areas that must be resolved to prove
‘its practlcablllty ‘From a chemical standp01nt the process is funda-
mentally sound; however, engineering- problems ere difficult, A basic
-problem is & material for containing bismuth and blsmuth—salt mlxtures,

Fluorlnatlon of a flowing salt stresm has been demonstrated but establish-
ing and malntalning a protective layer of frozen salt on the fluorinator
walls has not been demonstrated except in a fluorination 51mu1atlon.
Complete removal of entrained bismuth from molten salt, and satisfactory
-high-temperature 1nstrumentatlon for process control are yet to be de-
veloped and demonstrated. Experimental data from the MSRE indicate that -
noble metal fission products will dep051t on reactor surfaces as we have
. assumed in this study; if this is not the case, there will be & consider-
able effect on processing plant design in fac111t1es for handllng these

SCOPE OF THE DESIGN STUDY

essing irradiated LiF-BeF -ThF4 UF, fuel'of a 1000-MW(e) molten-salt
breeder reactor, The proce531ng plant 1s an 1ntegrated facility that

shares conmon services and maintenance equlpment with the reactor and

Our costs are based upon preliminary design caloulatlons of each
major item of process equipment, A sufficient study'was made of all
process operations to esteblish the geometry, heat transfer surface,
material of construction, coolant requirement, and other features that
influenced operability and cost of the'equipment . No plant layouts or

designs of'auxiliary equipment were made, Aux111ary 1tems such as pumps,

' sampllng statlons, reagent purification systems, etc., were 1dent1f1ed

by size and number in relatlvely broad categories from flowsheet require-
ments and a general knowledge of the overall plant layout. The costs of
magor equipment items were estlmated on the basis of unit cost per pound

of fabricated,material for the required shapes, fOr example, plate, tubing,

pipe, flanges; etc. The costs of conventional aux111ary equipment and

of f-the-shelf items were estimated from prev1ously developed molten salt

reactor proaect 1nformat10n.

Estimated costs for major and auxiliary equipment were the basis
for other diréct costs that could not be determined without detailed
designs and equipment layouts. Cost for piping, instrumentation, insula-
tion, etc,, were estimated'by taking various percentages of the installed_'
equipment costs, The applied factors wererobtained_from previous experi-
ence in chemical processing;plant_deSignland construction,

The study does not include allowances for site, site preparation,

buildings, and facilities shared with the reactor plant.' TheSe costs

are identified with the overall- cost of the power station and it is not

practicable to proratevthemlorer.various sections of the installation,
o Facilities‘andlequipment7for”treating the reactor off-gas are usually
- considered to be part of the reactor system and their cost was not in-

cluded, ‘Furthermore, our study was not sufficiently-detailed to determine

the'required‘duplication:of;eQUipmentVfor continuity of operations, nor .

: did we make'a thorough'safety'analysis that could resuit in additional .

' THE MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

Reactor Plant o

The processing plant of this study trects irfadiated fuel from the
'1000-Mw(e) reference molten salt breeder reactor descrlbed by Robertson.l,
The single-fluid resactor is fueled with’ 235UF4 in a carrier of molten
7LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %); about 0.3 mole % *°3UF, is required
- for criticality., The molten fuel is circulated at high éclocity in |
-cloSed loops consisting of the reactor core and primary heatvexchangcrs
(Fig. 2) wheré fission energy is transferred to & secondary coolant salt
for the production of supercritical steam at 1000°F and 3600 psia,
‘ FiSsioning'uranium in the core heats ﬁhe salt to zbout 1300°F; this témf
perature is reduced to about 1050°F in the primany heat'exchaogers from

which the salt returns to the core to repeat the cycle, ‘A sidestream of

s&lt flows continuously through the fuel-salt drain tenk, and & very small

portion (0.87 gpm) of this stresm is routed continuously to thefprOcessing'

 plent for treatment. Processed salt is returned to the drain tank end
- then to the reactor, S |

A thermel-neutron reactor must be processed rather rapidly for both
fission prodﬁct and **®Pa removal if the reactor is to maintain favorable
breeding characteristics, &nd a significant advantage of the MSBR is the
ease of withdrawing fuel for processing. The moderately high absorption
cross section and large equilibrium inventory (~102 kg) of **°Pa make
this nuclide a significant neutron poison and require that its removal
rate by processing'be sbout four (or more) times its decay rate, that is,
a cycle time of about 10-dsys.‘-In this system the processing plant is |
an integral part of the installation, and irradiated fuel can flow easily
from the primary reactor circuit to the processing plant (Fig. 1). Treated
fuel is returned in a similar manner, The processihg,cycle time is de- |
termined from an economic_balance between the cost of prccessihg and the

creditvfrcmvincreased fuel yield, The cycle time for this study (10 days)

‘might not be the optimum because it was fixed to give the MSBR favorable

nuclear performance withoutrpriof knowledge of the processing cost.

Contaminants in the reactor fuel can be gfouped into three broad

categories with respect to their influence on processing plant design:1?

| (1) volatile fission products, (2} soluble fission and corrosion products,

and (3) fission products that have an afflnlty for surfaces in the reactor

in the fuel salt can be divided into twelve groups, the members of'each
group haV1ng similar behavior in the processing plant The-primary'reA

moval operatlon is the domlnant process for the group, whereas, - the

;secondany removal operatlon is a downstream operation de51gned for
_removal of a dlfferent group but also effectlve in remov1ng components

'of a preV1ously removed group.

Noble gases,.sem;noble metals, and noble metals have only a small

influence on processing plant design because of their fast removal rate
in the reactor, However, soluble daughters of these nuclides will prob-

'ably reenter the fuel salt and be removed in the proce831ng plant,

Noble gases are sorbed from the inert sparge gas and retalned for decay

on. charcoal beds in the reactor off-gas circuit that 1s removed from the

| proce881ng plant Decay times are sufficient to decontamlnate the gas

from all krypton and-xénon 1sotopes except 85kr, which has a 10, 76-yr
half life, Krypton-BS is concentrated and stored in cylinders by routing

@ sidestream of the carrier_gas'thrOUgh either a;cryogenic operation.or

the more recently developed hydrocarbon sorption process,

There are small concentrations of heavy elementsr(neptunium and
protactinium) formed byfneutrOn oaptnre and decay, These elements are
easily extracted and will be held in the R53pg decay tank, Neptunium

can be fluorinated from the. salt but not as ea51ly as uranlum, therefore,

we can expect part of the neptunlum to behave 11ke uranium and be returned

to the reconstltuted fuel

‘ | Fluorination |
Irradiated fuel salt from the MSER enters the processing plant at
. ebout 0,87 gal/mln and is held for ‘gbout 30 minutes to allow the decay
heat generatlon rate to drop from about 5L.6 to 12,6 Ki/ft>. (See the
detalled flowsheet in Appendix D for material and energy‘balance data )
The salt then flows to a fluorlnator where gbout 95% of the uranium is
f volatlllzed at about 550°G as UF .- The fluorlnator must be protected '
from catastrophlc attack by the Fé-molten salt mixture by a 1eyer of
frozen selt on wetted surfaces of the unit, Salt leaves ‘the fluorinator
and enters e similer column, which is also protected by frozen salt,
'where hydrogen gas reacts with dlssolved fluorine and UFg to produce HF

. &nd UF, respectively, The hydrogen &lso strips HF from the selt, prevent- B

ing corrosion of downstream equlpment

The fluorinator is also the primary removal unit for the halogens,'
which are oxidized to volatile Bng and IFE} Certain noble &nd semi-
noble metals, namely, Se,'Mo, Tc, Ru, Sb, and Te, are converted to :
_volatlle fluorldes by fluorine and are removed with the uranium, ,How- -
ever, as stated above, the equlllbrlum amounts of these metals in- the |
salt are small because of the 2, 4-hr removal time in the reactor. Re51d-
ual Kr and Xe are removed by the stripping actlon of Fy in the fluorlnator

and. H2 1n the purge column,

Protactirium Extraction &nd TIsolation

The salt stream, containing about 5% of the urenium and all of the

protactlnlum, enters the bottom of .a packed extraction column and is

contacted with a countercurrent stream of bismuth containing about 0,2
at, % lithium and 0,25 at, % thorium reductants, Protactinium and ura-

nium are reduced by lithium‘and thorium and extracted into the bismuth;
fission product zirconium, the remalnlng noble and seminoble metals, and
corrosion products are also extracted Salt 1eav1ng the top of the ex-

tractlon column is essentlally free of uranium and protactlnium.,

The'reductlve_extractlon column operates at about 6L0°C with a salt/

'-metal flow ratio around 6,7/1, Extraction is essentially complete for

the affected nuclides, Thorium can be extracted into the metal as shown

in the third equation below, However, operating conditions are_fixed to

minimize the extraction of thorium, and, since thorium is a reductant

for protactinium and uranium, it is partially returned-tohthe salt phase,

- The principal reactions occurring in the protactinium extraction column

are: Co
 PaF, (selt) + L Li(Bi) - L IiF (salt) + Pa(Bi)

| Fuel Reconstitution

After removal of rare earths, the fuel salt is reconstituted with

recycled uranium in the reduction column. The UF,-F, mixturo is &bsorbed

- in UF,-bearing salt and contacted with hydrogen reductant at about 600°C
forming UF, dlrectly in the molten salt, Wetted surfaces of the column

are protected from corrosive attack by a layer of frozen salt, Gaseous
reaction products. primerily hydrogen and hydrogén'fluoride, are contam-
inated by small amounts of volatile fission products, principally compounds
I, Br, Se, ahd Te., It is belleved that most of the volatile noble metal
fluorides accompanylng the UF will be reduced to metals in the reduction
column and remain in the salt, However, the fluorides of I, Br, Se, and

Te will probably be'redﬁoed-to HI; HBr, H,Se, and H,Te, compounds that

- are very volatile, The gas is-treated to remove fission products and .

two atmospheres pressure and cooled to 11que£y HE which is then dlstllled
at essentially total reflux to separate more volatlle flsS1on product
compounds (prlmarlly HI, HBr, and probably H,Se &nd HéTe) from hydrogen
fluoride, The condenser for the still is kept at -hO C to minimize the
loss of hydrogen fluoride. A portlon of the HF is recycled to the hydro-
fluorinators and the remainder is electrolyzed in a fluorine'cell‘to make
Fy and H,, which are reused in the fluorinators and sparge columns re-

spectively,

The 220- -day holdup of combined 233py decay salt and carrier salt

'materlal in the salt sent to waste retentlon. Since the excess 233y
production is gbout 165 g/dey, the unrecovered materiel (55 g/220 days)
represents only 0.15% of the breed;ng gain, However, the waste salt is
held in‘the large retention tank for 9 years'after.filling'before ship- '
‘ment to permanent disposal, At the end of this time (13,5 years) the

must pass through three unit operatlons in series that are very effectlve

to function properly thereby allowing UF; to enter the gas recycle - system;
secondly, NaF sorbers, 1nstalled es a safeguard agalnst such a malfunction,
would have to be ineffective at trapplng the UFg;. and thirdly, any UF,

in the gas after the NaF sorbers would remain in the bottoms of the HF
still and be trapped in the electrolyte 1n the fluorlne cell, ‘Since dis- .

l products and noble gases,

' DESIGN AND COST ESTIMATE

The first step in preparlng the cost estimate was to define the .
sequence of operations that constitute the flowsheet as shown in Fig, 3.
and in more detail on the draw1ngs in Appendix D, These operatlons were

based upon laboratory and small-scale engineering data for batchwise

, pefformance of the various unit‘processes, and it was assumed that the

steps could be successfully operated on a continuous flow basis. Para-

‘metric studles were made to determine the breedlng performance of the

MSBR for various ways of operatlng the process;ng_plant, and from this
work basic conditions for the flowsheet were established, The computa-
tions did not necessarily determine the optimum economic processing cycle

since that presupposed kndwledge of processing costs, A computer pro-

gram® was used to calculate material and energy balances for each process

-operation, g1v1ng the ba31c data for equlpment de51gn.

A preliminary, highly simplified design was made for each major

equipment item in order‘feAesteblish its size, geometry, heet transfer

_surface, and special-featureslfrom which the amounts of materisls requir-

ed for the vessel could'be'eelculated Materials of construction were

"selected u81ng the general criterla that all vessels contalnlng blsmuth

' would be constructed of molybdenum and that vessels contalnlng only
emolten,fluorlde saltlwould,be made of,Hastelloy N. In other areas,

. particularly for auxiliaryﬂequipment,-nickel,-Stainless steel, and mild
”'steel were used, The timeischedule'for the cost estimate did not permit

us to make_thoroﬁgh'stﬁdieslef-eachevessel, and, for expedieney,‘certain -
shortcuts were adoﬁted‘to'preclude making lengthy Stress’and heat trans-

fer calculations, .The principal time-saving assumptions were:
 

32

Small tanks, columns, and vessels to be made of 3/8- in. plate,
larger ones of 1/2 -in, plate

" Heat exchanger tublng to be 1/2-1n. OD x 16 gauge for all ves-
sels

‘Overall heat transfer coefficients to be in ‘range 50 200 Btu/hr-
£t°-°F depending on fluids and.whether natural or forced
convection -

‘Annular space in Jacketed vessels to be & nom1na1 one-1nch

Den31ty, thermal conduct1v1ty, and specific heat values ‘for proc-,
ess fluids to be average values rather than temperature dependent

Freeboard volume standardized at 25% of required process volume
for tanks with fluctuating levels and 10% for tanks with constant
levels '

Number of nozzles and thickness and number of supports and baf-
fles for heat exchanger bundles estimated from & cursory
examination of the vessel diameter and length

'-All heat exchanger bundles to be U-tube constructlon

The cost of each installed vessel was estlmated using the unlt costs
for materieals glven in Table 6, A single price of $200/pound was used o
for all moLdeenum structursal shapes. -The fabricetion.ofAmolybdenum -
into conventional shapes and vessels is extremely difficul£ and is not
current technology; the $200/pound figure represents & "best guess" of
the cost.

Unit costs of Hastelloy N were taken from the conceptual design

~ study® .of the 1000-Mi(e) MSER power plant and are, therefore, character-
istic of the fabrication of large vessels., In our case, components are -
generailysmall‘and\intricately constructed, factors tha£ are conducive-'
to higher unit costs. However, we believed'that'refining the costs was

5un3ust1f1ed in view of other. uncertalntles 1n the estimate,

Our study did not contain a sufficiently detailed de81gn for d1-
rectly estimating the cost of a1l items in the plant, For the cost of
‘some items, for exampie, piping, instrumentation, insulation, and elec-
trieal connections; we estimated charges by taking various percentages‘
offthe installed equipment cost{r In nsing_this procedure the high cost
of molybdenum equipment was teken into-account by.notfusing as ierge a

The results of our study are summarized in Tables Ts 8 and 9;
these tables divide the equipment into three types--molybdenum, Hast-

" The auxlllary equipment of Table 9 costs $2,486,290, These items
are essential for startup and/or smooth operation of the plant. In

 $35.614 million. These costs do not include the cost of site, site prepe
aration, buildings, end facilities shared with the reactor plant such as
heat sinks, maintenance equlpment and emergency cooling, The cost of
these facilities were estlmated by Robertson® .and are 1ncluded in the
design and cost study of the 1OOQ—MW(e) MSBR,

Items of direct cost that were not obtained from preliminary designs
were estimated as percenteges of the installed equipment cost, The per-
centages were based upon previous experience in the design of rediochemical
plants, Piﬁing,.instrumentation, electrical connections, and insulation
costs were estimated in this wey, Charges for radiation monitoring de-
vices, sampling stations,”and a remotely operated fluorine plant were
estimated from other iﬁfOrmatien. The discussion below describes our

method of finding these costs.

Process Piping

| Piﬁing,costs for a remotely eperated processing plant are normally
in the range L0 to 50% of the.cost of installed process equipment. We
estimated the costs separately for moljbdenum, Hastelloy N, and auxiliary
piping, choosing factors of 30%, 50%, and L0% respectively. The low per-
centage value was used for molybdenum because of the relatively small
amount of this piping and the uncertalnty in the base prlce ($200/lb)
chosen for molybdenum, The calculated costs are:

of Mo pumps) + cost of Mo heat exchangers)] (0. 30)

Process Insfrumentation

Process instrumentation refers to devices for monltorlng and con-
trolllng the operatlon of the plant through measurements of flowrates,
temperatures, pressures, concentratlons, 11qu1d 1evels, or other pertJ.- |
nent quantities, Generally the 1nstrumentatlon cost is sbout 30% of the |
insﬁalled equipment cosﬁ. Instrumentationicost for-molybdenum equipment |
was charged st'10%'of the installed equipment cost, The lower percentage
allows for the inordinately high cost of fabricated molybdenum vessels,
‘-Heater instrumentation was charged at only 15% of the installed heater
cost because such instrumentation is stralghtforward. We determ;ned the
cost as follows: | o | | ‘

'Thermal Insulation -

| The thermal insulation cost for & chemical processing‘plant_is usu-
ally about 5% of the equlpment and piping costs, We calcﬁlated the cost
‘of insulation for Hastelloy N and auxiliary equipment in this way; how-
ever, we excluded the costs of the cell inert gas system, fluorine and
hydrogen‘supply system, ahd inert gas blanket-system since'this.equipment
does not need insulation. Also we used only 50% of the piping cost
($388,820) for auxlllary equipment because it was estimated that only
- gbout one—half of this plplng would need insulation, For insulation on
moledenum equipment we factored the equlpment and piping costs at 3.5%,

Fluorine Plant

The cost of mannfacturing fluorine and hydrogen on site by elec-

- trolyzing recycled hydrogen fluoride was compared with the cost of

purchasing these gases and disposing of unused excess &s waste, - Our

‘supplementary cost study (Appendix A) showed that once-through. operation

contributed about 0,11 mills/kWhr to the fuel cycle charge for the cost
of waste containers, shipping, salt mine disposal, fluorine, other chenm-
icals, and capital equipment, On the other hand, the corresponding'fuel-

. cycle charge for recycle operation including the fluorine plant was

gbout 0,02 mills/kWhr

We have estlmated the capital cost of a remotely. operated fluorlne

plant to be $1. 005 million; the cost includes labor, materlels, piping,

and 1nstrumentat10n.5 The‘plant is de81gned to produce 148 1bs Fé/day,

which allows about fifty percent utilization in the fluorinators, Hy-
drogen output.of the plant 'is used in UF, reduction and salt sparging.

Indirect Costs -

Indirect costs include construction overhead, engineering and in-

spection charges, taxes and 1nsurance, contingency, and 1nterest durlng

‘Construction Overhead

On the basis of past experience for'the cost of chemical processing
plants this cost was ‘taken as 20% of the total direct cost and equal to
$h 114 mllllon. '

Engineering and Inspection Charge

 

This charge was computed by the guidelines of NUS-531° which was
written specifically for reactor plants but was used in this study,
Plant engineering charges ere based upon the total direct costs of the
installation, which is $152,3 million* for the reactor plant plus
$20.568 million for the processing plant, The specified charge is 5.3%
of the direct cost of the processing;plant; | |

In addition, the cost guide specifies that a premium be added to
the agbove amount to account for the "novel" feature of the design, This
charge is also a function of the direct cost and for this ﬁlant is
$2,700,000. Although the use of a '"novel! design surchafge rather than
the lower-"prcven" design charge of $1,600,000 appears to violate the
condition that'the'cost estimate was to be for a plant'based.on developed
MSBR technology, it is our opinion that the complexlty of the plant is
such that the higher premlum'W1ll be required,

Taxes and Insurance

 

This account covers property and ell-risk insurance, state &nd local
property taxes on. the site and improvements durlng the construction pe-
r;od, and sales taxes on purchased materials, Using NUS 531 as & gulde
and taking the total direct:ccstof'thevinstallatlon as & ba31s, the

Contingency

The contingency charge was tazken as 20% of the total direct cost
minus the ccst of molybdenum ccmponents."Wé'felt that the $200/pound
charge for fabr1cated mclybdenum equipment already contained a sufficient

contingency factor.

FUEL CYCLE COST

- Inventory and use charges were valued at the unit costs given in
Table 11; inventory, net wofth Operéting charges, &nd fuel qycle costs
are given in Table 12, The gross fuel cycle cost is 1.21 mllls/kWhr
about 58% of this cost is contributed by fixed charges on the processing
plant and another 32% by the reactor inventory. The fuel yield of
3.27%/yr gives & production credit of &bout 0.09 mills/kWhr which is |
slightly more than the operating charges of about 0,08 mllls/kWhr The
net fuel cycle cost is about 1.12 mills/kWhr,

CAPITAL GOST VERSUS FLANT SIZE

' The usefulness of & cost estimate is greatly enhanced if the capital
cost can be related to plant throughput so that the most economic opera-
tion of the reactor system c&n be determlned . In this case we have &
 power station of predetermlned size [1000- MW(e)] so that, strlctly speak-
ing, cost-versus- throughput deta will apply only to & single 1000-MN(e) |

- fuel cycle cost, Andthér way of decreasingrfuel cycle cost is to asso-

ciate a larger power plant, for example, two or ‘more 1000-MW(e) MSER's,
with a 51ng1e proce581ng faclllty, however, such a2 consideration was

beyond the scope of thls study,

‘We chose to estimate the capital cost of the fluorination—-reductive

extraction~--metal transfer proCesSing'plant for a throughput that is three

- times the rate used gbove, corresponding to & 3,33-day processing cycle

for the 1000-Mi(e) MSER, .The shorter cycle time was selected because it
was believed that, at cycle times longer than 10 days, the breeding gain
would be adversely affected by hlgher parasitic neutron losses to R33pg,

Our estimated capltal cost is given in Table 13, Direct costs are $28.5

 million, and indirect costs are $2O Oh mllllon for a total 1nvestment of
$h8 54 mllllon. o |

Capital costs for the plant for a 10-day (O 874 gal/mln) processing
cycle and the plant for a 3,33-day (2,62 gal/mln)rprocessrng-cycle are
plotted in Fig, 6, and & straight line is drawn between the points. The
curve is extrapolated to cover processing rates from 3 gal/mln to 0.24
gal/mln (cycle times = 3 to 37 days). Below & rate of O, 2h gal/mln, the
curve is drawn: horizontally at a capital cost of $25.m111;on.‘ It was

‘felt that $25 million'probably repreSents ahlower'limit‘for the cost of
~a plant of'the:present deSign. |

The cost-versus- throughput line has 2 slope of 0,28 which indicates

hthat the capital cost is not strongly affected by throughput However,
) the economic: advantage in fuel cycle cost of proce531ng a 1000-MW(e)
'MSBR on longer or shorter oycle ‘times than 10 days has not been caloulated.

It is apparent though that lower fuel cycle costs can be obtalned by proc-

_e531ng several 1000-MW(e; MSBR's in one proces51ng plant Although thls
HlS undoubtedly true, the curve of Fig. 6 is not an accurate representa-
'tlon of ‘the cost of proce551ng ‘several reactors because the addltlonal

Cost Estimate for a 3, 33-Day Fuel Cycle Time

A complete rede51gn of the proce551ng plant wes not attempted to
- obtain the capital cost at the greater throughput However, the cost of
each item of equipment listed in Tables 7, 8, and 9 was recomputed.hy the
- following general procedures: ‘

Redesign and estimate the cost of- a few vessels that are typical

of the several types of equipment, e.g., tanks with internal heat
exchange surface, columns with frozen salt on walls, liquidfliquid |
contactors with internal heat exchange surface, etc, Compare the
cost of the redesigned vessel with its counterpart in the 10-day
cycle case and determine 2 scale factor from the relationship

'_ Ee@?\

' where n = scale factor ‘ ' ,
Cp= febricated vessel cost for 3. 33 -day cycle
C,= fabricated vessel cost for 10-day cycle :
Rz— flow rate through proce551ng plant for 3,33-day qycle ~
flow rate through processing plant for 10-day cycle

Determine the fabricated cost of the remaining vessels by using
~ the appropriate scale factor, the previously calculated cost for
the 10-day cycle cese, and the gbove equation, ’ -
Scale-factors for individuel pieces of equipment were in the range
0,52 to 0;82, however, ‘& number of items had & scale factorfeQual to
zero because their sizes were independent of processing rate, Typical
examples of vessels having zero scale factor are the *>®Pa decay tank,

the divalent rare earth accumulator, and the trivalent rare earth accu- |

mlator, Thus.the overall scale factor (0.28) for the plant is considerably -

below the velue of about 0,6 customarily associated with chemical'plantsQ

Installed costs for moledenum, Hastelloy N, and auxiliary equlp-
‘ment are given in Tables 1k, 15, and 16. An overall scale factor was
determined for each group of equipment by comparing the total costs from -
~ the above tables with the corresponding total from Tables 7, 8, and 9.
It was found that the molybdenum equipment scaled by & factor of 0. 31,
Hastelloy N equipment by a factor of O, 26 and the auxiliary equipment
by a factor of 0,33, These factors were used to determine some of the

NEEDED DEVELOPMENT, UNCERTATNTIES AND ALTERNATIVES

' There are sufflcient l&boratony and englneerlng deta tc show thet
chemical principles for the fluorlnation—-reductive extraction--metel
transfer process are fundamentally sound Except for fluorlnatlon, most
of the development has been in relatively small-scale experlments, end
design studies which, in addition to’ giving encouraglng results, have
~ identified problem areas, The more importent'problem areas &nd uncer- :

tzinties are discussed below.

Meterlals of Constructlon

'The most basic problem to thls process 1s that of a meterlal for
contalnlng molten bismuth or b1smuth-salt mixtures.. Molybdenum has
excellent corrosion resistance to both phases but is a very dlfflcult |
‘metal to fabricate, For example, in making welded jolnts therheat-
‘affected zone becomes very brittle due to recryStalization,'and'ductility
can be restored only by cold.worklng which is normally not practlcal on
fabrlcated equlpment Considerable progress has been made in the maklng
_of molybdenum shapes and joints, and in time, we feel that fabrication
'technology will be perfected The task will be difflcult even for small
molybdenum equipment, and, for large items that are required in parts of
this plant, the job is formidable, ~However, molybdenum equipment will
almost surely be expensive, | ' - |

Graphite is being considered as e.possible alternete'material of
construction, Also it may be possible to apply molybdenum coatings to &
- more eas1ly fsbrlcated material such &s a nickel-base alloy. Tungsten
~ coatings would also be satlsfactory. ‘ '

Continuous Fluorination

, Fluorination.of molten salts for uranium recovery has_been success-
fully demonstrated on severaloccasions7’9’9§1°hin~batchwise, pilot
plent operations, and the development of a continuous method- is in prog-
rress. Successful contlnuous fluorination depends upon ma1nta1n1ng a
, prctectlve frozen salt layer on wetted surfaces of the fluorinator to
 

 

 

&

C

prevent catastrophic corrosion, Establishing and maintaining this pro-
tective coating is a developmental problem that must be solved, The
solution is compllcsted by the difficulty of S1mulat1ng an internal heat

. source in the nonradloactlve salt of an englneerlng test, Experlmental o

: results have been encouraging, and the frozen-wall fluorinator ~should be

practical to bu11d &nd operate.'

Bismuth Removel From Szlt

Nlckel—base alloys are rapldly corroded by molten bismuth, e&nd ves-
sels that normally contain only salt, 1nclud1ng the reactor vessel &nd
prlmary heat exchangers, must be protected from chronic or recurring

exposure to the metal entreined‘in salt, A cleanup device for the salt

- stream, consisting of a vessel packed with nickel wool, exists only in

~ concept, and its effectiveness cennot be evaluated until tolerance

1im1ts for bismuth‘in salt have been determined as well as suitable
analytical methods for detecting low concentrations (<! ppm Bi) in salt,

The magnltude of bismuth entralnment cannot be completely assessed until

1 bismuth-salt contactors have been developed and tested, and cleanup

measures could be mandatory for the salt stream from each contractor if

bismuth entrainment‘is unacceptable, The allowable bismuth concentration:
in salt will almost surexy'be qulte low, and it is believed that blsmuth-
salt separatlon after each contact will be sharp. If not, a dependable

and practicable bismuth removal method must be developedQ

Instrumentatlon for Process Control

The continuous 1nterchange of salt between the reactor and proce581ng

,plant requlres quick and relisble analytlcal technlques for. salt composi-
_s't1on, uranium and protactlnlum content ‘and U5+/U4+ ratlo. -If on-line
- methods are not developed laboratory analyses could be used but these
are slow, 1nvolve the hazard and expense of . sample handllng, and requlre

holdup tanks wlth addltlonalrlnventory at the sample points, Similarly,
oneline monitoring_of.reductivefextraction and metal transfer-operations

by readings on the salt and/or bismuth phases would 2llow firm process -

control; however, we believe that these operations can be propErly con-

-ducted without sophiSticated instrumentation,

| Aocldental loss of f15511e materlal from the fluorlnatlon——reductlve
extractlon--metal transfer process is extremely unllkely Msloperations
~in all units except UF reduction will either return uranium and protao- :
tinium to the reactor in the recycle salt or dlvert each. into an area '
where f15$1on products are accumulated for dispossal. ‘Malfunction in the
UFg reductlon operation could route UFg toward the Hé-HF recyole systen,
‘and adequate mon1tor1ng and traps must be prov1ded to prevent such an
‘occurrence. The process already includes means of reooverlng f13311e
values from waste salt s;nce 211 waste is held for decey and fluorinated
‘before ultimate disposal - ’ - |

Some, but not all, process 1nstrumentation is requ1red to funotlon
in a 600° to 6LO°C enviromment, This condition will undoubtedly neces-
“sitate 2 development progream for 1nstrument oomponents, for example,

- gensors and transducers..r

Noble and Semlnoble Metel Behavior

Noble and seminoble metals constitute about 20,3 wt, % and 1, 6 wt, %
respectively of all fission products and account for_25.2%,and 2,06% of
_the'fission product decéy energy~st.equilibrium.v The behavior of these
‘fission products in the MSBR is not fuliy,understood;-however,fdata from
MSRE operation indicate that they are probably removed by attaching
themselves to reactor surfaces amd/or'ieaving uithlthe inert sparge gas.
Our treatment of the flowsheet is based on this premise;'and we have |

designed the processing plant to handle only & small amount of noble and

" seminoble metals, Most noble and seminoble metals have volatile fluorides :

. and would be removed in fluoriuation. If the behavior is not as assumed
and large amounts of noble and seminoble metals enter the process1ng
 plant, exten51ve redesign of the gas reoycle and salt cleanup systems
fwould be requlred -Heat removal problems would be more severe and
| add1t10na1 treatment would be required to remove reduced rioble. metal
~ particulates from the reconstituted fuel salt A better understandlng
- - of the behav1or of- thls class of f15$1on products in the reactor system

- is very 1mportant.

‘Operational.and Safety.Consideratibns

When operational and saféty considerations for the processing plant
are examined in detail,ﬂit will prdbably be found that their influence
on equipment aésign will bg’appreciqble. There is & volume heat source
due to decaying radiocactive nﬁclides"in practically every vessel in the
plant;’requiring’continuouS'cOOIing end fail-safe syétems. In some ves-
sels, high heat removal rates sre required because concentrations of the

Gas Recycle System

In the recycle system (Flg. A-2), gases from the reductlon column,
- purge columns, and hydrofluorlnators are compressed to about 2 atm
pressure and chilled to -40°C to condense hydrogen fluoride from the
H,-HF mixture;- Some of the*fission products, primarily volatile com-
pounds of I, Br, Se, and Te, are expected to condense to a large extent
with the hydrogen fluorine, These compounds are more volatile than
hydrogen fluorine and can be separated by distilling the mixture at low
temperature at sbout 2 atm pressure.r Vepor pressure data are shown in
Fig, A-l, ' The overheed_condehser is'kept at -L40°C so thet hydrogen
fluoride loss with the'noncondensabie gases .is minimel, Part of the
liquid hydrogen fluoride flows from the still to an electrolytic cell
to regenerate Hé'and”Fz; the remezinder is recycled to the hydrofluorinators.

The H,-rich gas from the:distillation.colqmn'is bubbled through a
caustic scrubber similar to the one used in the once-through system to
remove halides, The gas’isfdried in regenerative silica gel sorbers and
recycled to the reducﬁion and purge columns, About 5% of the hydrogen
is removed from the’ system on each cycle to purge selenium and tellurium

In the case of the oncevthrough gas cycle, the costs of purchased

: gases were calculated 1n two ways., One calculatlon was made -for the

purchase of all requlred fluorine, hydrogen, end hydrogen fluorlde from
outside sources. In the second case, hydrogen fluoride and some hydrogen
were purchased and fluorlne and hydrogen were manufactured on-51te from

HF in a nonradloactlve fluorlne plant. For complete gas recycle opera-

.tion, only the equlllbrlum hydrogen fluoride lost in the noncondensable

gas from distillation and that-consumed in hydrcfluorlnatlon are pur-

chased, The requlred hydrogen makeup is equlvalent to that discarded

less the’ hydrogen produced in hydrofluorlnatlon.

The costs of the two methods for treating the gases are compared in
Table A-1, The once-through gas cycle costs about 0,115 mllls/kWhr and

is almost flve times more expenslve than the recycle system, due primarily

1o the hlgher charges for waste. disposal and purchased fluorine. The

most 51gn1f1cant charge in the recycle system is the amortization of the

'remote fluorine plant. A small reductlon in costrcan be made in the
~ once- through gas cycle when fluorine-and hydrogen are manufactured on- .
's1te from hydrogen fluorlde, however, the fuel cycle cost 1s still four
| tlmes that of the recycle system.f S '

. On the bas1s of thls comparlson, the gas recycle system was selected

for the MSBR fuel reprocess1ng flowsheet

Appendix C: Steady State Concentrations
' in the Metal Transfer System

The metal-transfer system consists.of-captive‘bismuth and lithium
chloride phases that circulate in closed 1oops,-receiving fission pro-
ducts on one side of the loop and transferring them to a second phase at
the other side, Throughout the system the donor and acceptor flulds
operate wlth steady state concentratlons of . all metels being transferred,
the equ111br1a depending upon the dlstrlbutlon characterlstlcs of each
. species and the purge rate from the acceptor fluld - This system has
been carefully analyzed by Bell,: nd his date are glven in. Flg. Cc-1.

The purge of fission products from the Bi- 5 at, % L1 reservoir is
" shown as & continuous 5 669 gal/day stresm, thlng the rate continuous
~ was a convenience for calculatlons, 1n actual practlce the withdrawal
of such & small amount would be batchw1se on perhaps & two-day cycle.-
Slmllarly, the 1nd1cated w1thdrawa1 from the Bi-50 at, % Ii .reservoir
would probably be on & 30 day cycle._.,

Appendix D:  Flowsheet of the Fluorination--Reductive
‘Extraction--Metal Transfer Process [1000-Mi(e) MSER]

The attached flowsheets [Dwgs. No, F12173-CD-173E and No. F-12173-
CD~17hE] glve pertinent material and energy balance data for processing
the_reference MSER on & 10- -day cycle, During the course of the de31gn
and cost study, significant.design improvements.ln the original concept
of the plantfbecsme'epparent. As these changes were made to the flow-.
sheet, it was not always possible to fully investigate effects upon
other areas of the plant because of the urgency to complete the cost
Study on schedule._,Thus,.the reader might not elways obtain a satis-

factory material balance in specific areas of the flowsheet; however,

 the authors believe that such 1ncon31stenc1es are minor and do not

affect the results or conclusions of this study

Although the draw1ngs do not show englneering features with respect
to 1nstrumentat10n, coolant flow, aux111ary plplng, service lines, etc,,
these items were included in the cost estimate, Equipment. and vessels
for startup, shutdown, and standby operatlon of the plant were also

- included in the cost, however, they are not shown,
