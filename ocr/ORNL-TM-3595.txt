INTRODUCTION

This document contains abstracts of 321 selected reports and papers
which collectively provide a good, basic introduction to molten-salt re-
actor technology and describe major dévelopments in the field since the
initiation of the MSRE in 1960. As an aid in locating specific information,
three indexes are provided: by keyword, by author, and by subject category.

The abstracts and indexes, prepared and printed by a computer, were
taken from the file of the Molten-Salt Reactor Information System (MSRIS).
This is a growing file in the IBM-360 computer at ORNL, which can be
searched in various ways from femote terminals. A report is now being pre-

pared to describe MSRIS and how to use it.

LIST OF ABSTRACTS

In the pages which follow, abstracts are listed in the alphabetical
order of their primary subjeCt categories. Each’appears only once, even
though its subject may extend into éeveral other categories. Therefore to
find all abstracts having information on a particular subject, it is neces-
sary to use the category index. |

Each entry in this list consists of the abstract itself plus certain
other information about the reference. The first line is an identification
number, assighed when the_reference was added to the MSRIS file, The three

letters in this number'identify.thé-gtimarg subject category. If the ma-

 terial in the document'extendé'éignificantly into another category, this is

shown in the last line of'thg entry. Authors, title, and originating or-

'ganigation are listed on séparate'lines, then the document identification,

date of publication and'numbers"of_pages, figures, and references are given.
Following the abstract is a list ofrkeywqrds, with the most significant

marked by asterisks.

Molten-salt thermal bkreeder reactors are characterized by
low specific inventcry, moderate breeding gain with low fuel
cycle cost, and high efficiency fcr ccnverting heat irsto
electricity. Studies indicate they should be akle to
produce electricity in 1000-Mw {e) staticns at a ccst that is
as lcw or lower than prcjected for advanced converter
reactors or fast breeder power stations. The fuel
utilization characteristics compare tavorably with thcse of
fast breeders. The present status of thke breeder technclcqy
is being dercnstrated in successtul operation of the MSRE.
A two-region Molten-Salt Breeder Experiunent tc demonstrate
all the basic technclogy for full-scale breeders is proposed
as the next step in the development. Design and
censtruction of the MSBE would be accompanied by a program
of fuels, materials, fuel reprocessing, and ergineerirg
development. Develcgment, construction, and startup of the
breeder reactor is estimated to take abcut eight years and
to ccst about $125 million.

This document descrikes the fuel and klanket frccesses for
the MSBR, giving the current status of the technology and
outlining the needed development. It is ccncluded that the
principal needs are to develop the vacuum distillation and
protactinium removal operations, which tave beer
demcnstrated in the labcratory but not on an engineering
scale, A program to develop continucus fluoride volatility,
liquid-rhase reduction-reconstitution, improved xeaon
control, and special instrumentation shculd alsc be a major
~developmental effort. ' An estimate of manpower and cost for
developing MSBE fuel and fertile frocesses indicates that
it will require 288 manyears of effort over a 6-year period
at a total cost of about $18,000,C00.

Results cf chemical research and development for molten
salt reactors are summarized. These results indicate that
LiF-BeF2-UF4 mixtures are feasible fuels for thermal
breeder reactors, Such mixtures show satisfactcry rphase
behavior, they are compatible with Hastelloy N and
moderator graphite, and they appear tc resist radiaticn and
" tolerate fissicn prcduct accumulation. Mixtures of
LiF-PeF2-ThP4 similarly appear suitakle as blankets fcr
such machines., Several possible secondary coolant mixtures
are available; NaF-NaPBF4 systems seem, at fpresent, to be
the most likely poss=sibility. Gaps in the technology are
presented along with the accomplishments, and ar atteupt
is pade to define the information {and the research and
development program) needed tefore an MSBR cart be ope1ated

Breeder reactors are needed to keep power ccsts dcwn
as uranium prices rise. Development emphasis is on
fast breeders, which promise high gain. Therpal breeders
must have fast processing to remove protactinium and
poisons to achieve moderate gain, but fissile paterial
investments can be low. The fluid-fuel molten-salt
reactor with on-site processing promises lcw fuel cycle
cost and acceptable doubling times. MSF development
dates back to 1948 and includes successful cperation
of the MSRE at 650 deg C for over three years. The
molten-salt breeder concept is now a graphite ccte with
circunlating salt ccntaining both uranium and thorlum,

Molten-salt breeder reactors being developed at CENL
promise safe, low—cost power while extending rescurces of
fissicnable material., MSR technology, develciirng since
1947, was adequate for successful construction and
operation of the MSRE which showed thkat circulating
molten fuel is practical, that fluoride salts are statle
under reactor conditions, and that ccrrcsicn is very lovw.
The sivple fuel prccessing necessary for a converter was
demonstrated in the MSRE. Ptocessing methcds being
develcged should permit MSR*s in which UF4 and ThEF4 are
combined in a single salt flowing throuch a graghite
nmoderator to ofperate as economical breeders. Initial
startup can be with U-235, U-233, or Pu-23S. Ccrstruction
costs shculd be about the same as light-water reactors and
fuel costs should ke much lower. Achievement of eccacnmic
MSBR's requires develorment and construction of severaezl -

Apnalyses of MSEE salts dur1ng precritical testirg, U-235
loading, and zero-fpcwer experiments showed that purity was
maintained and corrosion was very low. Vapcr gtressures, HF
solubility, and iodine removal in LiF-BEef2 systems were
determined. Phase relations in the NaF-NaBF4 syster and
viscesity of NaBF4 ﬁererdetermined. (This systen is
suggested as an inexpensive, lower-melting breeder

This repcrt was presented at the Second Conference on

Neutron Cross Sections and Technology, Washingtcr, Naich

4-7, 1968. The effects of cross-sectior uncertainties
on estimates cf breeding perfcrmance and of pcwer
cost for a molten-salt Ltreeder reactcr are shcwrn to

be small. Uncertainty in breeding ratio due to cross-
section uncertainties is less than fplus cr rinus C.C2,
and the uncertainty in rover costs is less than plus
or minus 0,3 mills/kvhr {e). Similarly small effects
are shown fcr the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor.
The need for further refinements in nuclear data is
related primarily tc the calculation of temperature

ORNL-TM~-2696 (Sept. 1969), 29 p, 7 figq, 23 zef,
Several molten salts were considered as intermediate
coolants for LMFBR's, Included were flucride, chloride,
carbecnate, nitrate-nitrite and fluoroborate salts.
Chemical reactions that could cccur Letween scdiur and
flucrchorates lead to the conclusion that cartonates
might be a ketter choice for LMFBR's, Use c¢f carbonates
avoids the safety ccnsiderations and related costs thet

" arise from the reactions of sodium with water if stean

generator fails and with air if a coolant pipe ruptures.
In the absence of these safety ccnsideraticns, scdium is
clearly sugericr tc the mclten salts as an intermediate
coolant for LMFEBER's because the lcwer tlermal ccrductivity
and higher visccsity of the salts would result in higher
equipment costs.

Polycrystalline graphite has remarkaktle resistarce to ,
therral-stress-induced fracture. Nevertheless, selection
of a particular grade ot graphite for certain afprplicaticns
must include ccnsideration of this property. <Currently the
type and grade of graphite'are often selected cr the kasis
of elastic analyses, since thermal shock tests are toc
expensive. for screening devices., This repcrt describes a
test rapid and econcmical enough for screening candidate
materials. Thin disks of graphite are teated at the center
with an inert-gas shielded-arc nonconsumable electrode
velder, each at a different, Ltut constant, fpcwer level.
The rinirum power input to the welder that will consistently
cause the graphite to fracture is detercined. The graphite
that regu1res the highest power level to produce a _
fracture is the one most resistant tc thtermal shcck. This

nuclear graphite that is basically an extruded getroleun

" coke bonded with coal tar pitch heated to 2300 deg C. Low

permeation is oktained through a series cf infreqraticns and
heat treatments., The final heat treatment was at 2800 deg C
or higher. Experimental equipment and frocesses were used
on a ccmmercial scale fcr the first time. The graphite was
produced as a 2z-1/2-in.-square€e x 72-in.-long kars, shich
vere machined to the required shapes. The average bulk
density is 1,86 grams per cukic centimeter, 1Its matrix is
not permeated by mclten salts under conditions more severe
than those expected in the MSRE. It exceeded all the
requirements specified for the MSEE except that it had
longitudinal cracks. Tests indicated tlat the cracks
should nct have any significant adverse effect on the
operation of the MSRE. The skrinkage of the craphite at
30 to 475 deg C under exposures between 0.60 x 10{20th)
to 1,40 x 10 {20th) neutrons/sg-cm (E greater than 2.9 MeV)

The rerort discusses (1) corrcosion experiments dealing with
fluoride salts in support of the FKSRE, and (2) analytical
methcds employed tc interpret corrosicn and rass-transfer
‘behavicr. The rrodicts of ccrrosion are solutle in tthe
molten salt; accordingly passivation is precluded and
corrosion degends directly on the thermodynamic driving
force of the corrosion reactions. Conrpatibility, therefore,
~demands salt ccnstituents that are not appreciatly recuced
by useful structural alloys and container raterials whcse
compcnents are near thermodynamic equilibrium with the salt
medium, Utilizing information gained ip ccrrcsicn testing
of ccmmercial alloys . and in fundamental interfpretations of
the corrosion process, CRNL developed a high-strength
- nickel-base allcy ccntaining 17% Fo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe.
Several long-term corrosion lcops and in-pile capsule tests
ccrrleted with thicallcy demonstrate the excellent
corrosion resistance to fluoride salt mixtures at high
temperatures. Therrmodynamic methods are presented for
predicting corrosion rates. Radiotracer studies ccnfirmed

A srall heat of Hastellcy N was prepared in which a
portion of the carkton atoms were tagged as catbhcn—14, The
resgcnse tc heat treatment was studied to determine
whether the changes in mechanical properties cculd be
correlated with the cbserved changes in the carton
distribution, Although markedé segregation resulted,
the changes in wmechanical properties did not appear
to be related. A second okjective was to detersine.
‘whether the relatively large precipitate particles

bcth their stringer (lcu-temperature) and lamellar

that the other alloying elemepts reduce the sclukility

To reduce the gressure drop through the shell 51de cf the
MSRE primary heat exchanger, it was decided tc recove fcur
of the cuter U-tubes. 1This required sealing the eight tube
stubs produced. A plug design and seal weldirg frocedure
wvere develcged tc assure a high-integrity seal Letween the
molten fuel salt on the shell side and the ccclart salt on
the tube side cf the heat exchanger. The plugs had a
slight interference fit ({0.000C to C.CC(C2 in.,) with the
tubes and were machined for edge-welding. The plug
material was Hastelloy KN, as was the entire heat exchanger.
The tube end was manually velded to the plug with a gas

provide weld metal penetration equivalert tc at least the

The tensile properties ¢f Hastelloy N were measured after
various heat treatments. One vacuum-kelted ard fcur air-
welted heats were studied. The vacuum-wmelted material
exhibited good ductility after all heat treatrerts,
Annealing the air-melted material to temperatures in e€xcess
of 2150 deg F significantly reduced tite sinimur fractrire
strain. Holding at about 1600 deqg F for an extended period
recovered the fracture ductility. Aginc in tke 110C tc
120C deg F range material that had been previocusly annealed
at 2150 deg F significantly reduced tke ductility. These
changes in ductility cccurred with very small changes in
tensile strength., These effects can ke exrlained in terms
of the fcrmaticn of a brittle grain boundary layer alcng
vhich a crack can propagate easily at elevated terperatures.
Interrupting the ccrtinuity of this layer by overaging or
cold working recovers good fracture ductility. 1Tke
fcrration of this layer is associated with the fresence of
trace alloying elements.

The corresion of alloys exposed to nonisothersal
circulating liquids is important in systems with liguid
coolants or coclant-fuel combinations., Mathematical
descriptions vere developed to explain transpcrt cf |
constituents of allcys. This report specializes to cases

in which solid-state diffusion in the allcy dcmirates the

corrcsion. Equations are derived for hoth transient and
steady-state cases; transients are negligible.
Applicability is demrcnstrated by comparison of fpredicted
values with experimental results for twc systets, The
first involves hot-tc-ccld-zone transfer of nickel in
Inconel 600 pumped loops circulating sodiux. Actual
corresion is much higher than predicted; this suggests that
the true corrosion reaction overrides a slcw diffusior
process., The second system is transfer of chromium in
Hastelloy N thermal convection locps with zclter salt.,
Three examples are considered; (1) corrosion at all pcints,
transfer to salt only; (2) hot-tc-cold-zone trarsfer; and
{3) ccld-tc-hot-zcne transfer. - Early Cr-51 tracer

Design and evaluaticn studies were made of a twc-regicn
molten-salt thermal-treeder reactcr which uses fuel ard
blanket salts separated by the wvwalls of graphite tubing,
which acts as the moderator. A ccolant salt trarspcrts the
heat frox the primary heat exchanyers to steam generators
and reheaters. The reference design fuel salt is
LiP-Bef2-UF4 (68.3-31.2-0.5 mole %), the blanket salt is
LiF-ThF4-BeF2 (71.0-27.C0-2.0 wcle %), ard the ccclant salt
is NaF-NaBF4 (61.1-38.9 mole %). On-site fuel recycle
processing was assumed, with flucride volatility and
vacuum distillation employed for the fuel salt and direct
protactinium-rescval fprccessing used for the tlanket s=alt.
Estimated power cost is akout 2.7 mills, k¥Wkr, tke specific
inverntcry about 0.7 kg/E¥{(e), the fuel doubling time about
13 yrs and the estimated fuel-cycle ccst is 0.35 mills/kWhr.
General flowsheets and conceptual designs ifor the reactor,
primary heat exchangers, salt circulatirg pumgs and steanm

LiF-BeF2-ThFY4 rixture which is molten akove 930 deg F.
With continuous chemical processing tc isolate frctactinium
and rerove fission rrodicts, conversion of thorium to U-233
exceeds fissile burnup, The estirated fuel yield is 3. 3%
per year. The estirated construction cost of the station
is comparable to PWE total constructicn costs. The pcuwer
producticn cost, including fuel-cycle and grarphite
replacement costs, with private utility financirng, is
estigated to be less than that for present-day light-water

Develcpment of rapid fuel-salt processing and lcnger-lived

however, is generally within present technclcgy; the
graphite would last the lifetime of the plant and the
occasional fuel processing would invclve cnly the
vell-froven fluoride vclatility process. The breeding
ratio would be about 0.84, tut the fuel-cycle ccst wotld be
only about C.8 mrillss/kwh and the construction costs are
expected to be attractively lcw. The reactor design
receiving the most study is the type used successtfully in
the MSKE: a vessel filled with reflectcr and ecderatcr
grarhite having salt flcw passages formed by grooves in
the faces of the pieces. A pelttle-Led type cf ccnvertet
reactor has a structure that easily accommodates
dimensional changes in the graghite and the shkapes are
econcrical to ranufacture, but the salt-to-graphite ratio
in the core is higher than desired. Thermal reactors
operating on the Th - U-233 cycle are more efficient than
those using the U-228 - Pu-~-239 cycle, but Pu car be used

molten-salt reactor systems. The basic design concept is
such that boiling heat transfer instakbtilities and their
attendant severe thermal stresses are avoided even for a
temperature difference of as much as 1000 deg F between the
feedvater and the high-temperature liguid, thus givinc good
control characteristics even under startup ccrditiors.

This is accomplished by employing a vertical reentry tutke
geometry with the feedwater entering the becttcoe cf the-
inner swall diameter tube (approximately 1/4 in. diam)
through vhich it flovs upward until evafpcrated tc dryress.
The slightly superheated steam emerging from the top cf the
small central tube then flows tack dcwnward thrcugh the
annulus between the central tube and the outer tuke. A
portion of the heat transferred from the high- tenppratu:e
liquid tc the superheated steam in the annulus is in turn
transferred to the water toiling in the central tube.
Design studies indicate that this type of toiler not only
avoids thermal stress and salt treez:ng Frcblers but it
alsc gives a relatively compact and inexpensive
construction., Further, it apgears tc rake pcssible a
simple plant ccntrcl system sith exceptionally good plant
response to changes in load dewand.

Ar analog computer simulation of the prcoposed 1CCC-MW MSER
vas devised and preliminary studies were rade cf dytawics
and ccntrol. This report descriles thke reactcr glant
model and the computer simulation. The analog simulation
of the plant consisted of a lumped-paraneter reat trarcsfer
model for the ccre, primary heat exchanger, and steam
generator; a two-delayed-neutrcn-qroup ncodel c¢f the
circulating-fuel nuclear kinetics with temperature |
reactivity feedbacks; and the external contrcl system., . So
that the model would have the maximum dynamic range, the
system differential equations were nct linearized, and as
a result the mcdel was severtely limited spatially to
minimize the number of equations. In acditicr, the
Fressure in the water side of the steam generator, as well
as in the rest of the plant, and the physical ficperties of
the salts and vater were takem to be time invariant. The
temperature of the feedwater to the steam cerneratcrs was
alsc held constant. Results and conclusions are given in
CRENI-T¥-2927 (MSRIS accession JAB700C17).

the ccroponents, The eutectic %as purified by treatment
with hydrogen, which reduced the corrcsicn grcducts

ORNL-TM-1051 (March 11, 196S5), 15 p, 5 tiqg, 7 ref
The direct reducticn c¢f uranium hexaflucoride to uranium
tetrafluoride in a molten salt is propcsed as a steg
in the purification of fuel salt from a molten salt
reactor, This step would replace the ccnventicral
metkcd of reduction in which uranium hexofluoride is
reduced to uranium tetrafluoride power in a hydrcgen-
flucrine flame. Reduction of the uranium hexafluoride
in a molten salt will result in a shcrter and mcre
direct prccess for fuel salt purification. The reduction
is to be effected in two steps which consist cf abscrytion
of uranium hexafluoride into a molten salt conrtaining
uranium tetrafluoride and of reducticn c¢f the resultirg
intermediate fluorides to uvranium tetrafluoride with
hydrogen. EFExperimental data on the atscrpticr sterp

The MSRE has been refueled with an enriching salt
concentrate, lithium-7 fluoride-uranium-233 tetrafluoride
(73-27 mole %), which was prepared in a shielded cell in the
Thorium- Uraniur Recycle Facility at CEML. The preparation
process involved reducing uranius tricxide (uranium-232
content, 222 prm) tc uranium dioxide by treatment with
- hydrogen, converting the dioxide to tetraflucride by
hydrcflucrination, and fusing the tetraflucride with
lithiur-7 fluoride. The original KSRE fuel salt, which
contained 220 kg of uranium (3%5% uranium-235), was
flucrinated to volatilize the uranium as the hexafluoride
which was absorbed ‘on sodiur flucride. The urarium was
deccntaminated frow fissicn products by a factor of almost
ten to the ninth, Fluorine utilizaticn averaged 39%.
Corrcsion products were removed from the barren carrier salt

Operating experience with 0U-235 fuel in the MSEF is
described. From initial criticality in Jupne 1, 1965 to
March 19€8, the reactcr was critical 11,51% hr and
generated 9005 equivalent full-gcwer hours cf erergy &t
pcwer levels tc 8 Mw, The shutdown in March 19€€& was tc
perecit changeover tc U-233 fuel. Cperation with U-23°¢
demonstrated system reliakility and raterials ccrmratitility.
Infcrraticn was collected on fission-product lehavior,
nuclear characteristics, and reactivity pehavicr. Operating
difficulties were associated with a very small oil legk in
the fuel circulating punrp, the fuel sampler, air-line
disccrnects, and seccndary cooling blowers. Some remote-
maintenance technhiques were demonstrated., (A ccrvenient

The MESRE is an 8-Mvw {th) reactor in whict mclten flucride
salt at 1200 degrees F circulates through a core of
graphite bars, 1Its purpose was tc demcnstrate the
practicality of key features of molten~-salt power’
reactors. Operation with 0-23% in the fuel salt amcurnted
to SCCO0 equivalent full-povwer hours betseen June 1965
and March 1968. At the end of a 15-wcnth demcpstraticn
of reliability the reactor was shut down and the C-
235 was stripped frcm the salt in on-site fluorination
equipment., U-233 was added to the salt and cperaticn
vas resured in Octcber 1968. Cver 2500 EFFH has teen
produced with U-233 through July 1969. The. MSRE has
shown that salt handling in an operating reactor is
quite practical, the salt chemistry is sell-Lkehaved,
there is practically no corrosion, the nuclear

Overall fuel and graphite temperature distributicns were
calculated for a detailed hydraulic and nuclear
representation of the MSRE fueled with tighly erriched

importance and volume weighted to okttair nuclear and kulk
mean temperatures fcr bcth materials., At the design fpower
level of 10 Mw, with the reactor inlet and cutlet
temperatures at 1175 deg F and 1225 deyg F, respectively, the
nuclear mean fuel temperature is 1213 deg F. The bulk
average temperature of the fuel in the reactor vessel
(excluding the volute). is 1198 deq F. For the came
conditions and with no fuel permeation, the graphite nuclear
and bulk mean temperatures are 1z%7 deg P and 1226 deq F,
resgectively. Fuel rermeation of 2% of the graphite volume
raises these values to 1264 deg F and 1231 deg F,

Use is made of the concept of *nuclear averagye temperature!
to relate the spatial temperature prcfiles in fuel and
grarhite attained during high power operation of the MSRE
to the neutron multiplication constant. Based cr twc-groug
perturbation thecry, temperature weighting functions for
fuel and graphite are derived, frcm which the nuclear
average temperatures may be calculated. Similarly,
importance-averaged temperaturec coefficients cf reactivity
are defined. The values of the coefficients calculated for
the MSRE were -4,8 x 10 (~-5th) deg F fcr the fuel and -7.3 x
10(-Sth) for the grarhite. These values refer to a reactor
~ fueled with salt which does nct ccntain therice. They were .
about 5% larger than the values okttained freco a cne-reglon,

PERICL HERSUREHENTS ON THE MOLTEN SALT REACTOR EXPERINENT

Cak Ridge National Lahkoratory, Tenn.

ORNL-TM-1626 (Oct. 1966), 36 g, 8 fig, 10 ref.
A theory of period dependence cr the fuel circulaticn is
develored from the gemeral space-dependent reactor kinetics
equations. A procedure for computer evaluaticn cf the
resulting inhour-tyge equaticn is presented, together
with numerical results relating the reactivity tc the
otserved asymptotic period, both with the fuel circulating
and with it stationary. The calculated reactivity
difference betveen the time-independent flux conditioms for
the noncirculating and the circulatinc fuel states is in
close agreement with the value inferred from the MSRE rod
calibration experiments., Rod-kump pericd measurerents made
with the fuel circulating were converted to differential rod
vorth by use of this model. These results ate ccrpared with
similar rod sensitivity measurements made with the fuel
stationary. The rod sensitivities measured under these two
ccnditions agree favorably, within the limits of precision
of the period measurements., Due to the prchlesr cf
maintaining adequate precision, however, the period-rod
sensitivity measurements provide a less conclusive test of
the theoretical model than the reactivity difference letveen
the time-independent flux conditicns.

ANALYSIS OF FILLING ACCIDERIS IN MSKE

ORNL-TM-497 (Aug. 1966), 41 p, 14 fig, 2 ref,.
Whenever the MSRFE is shut down, the fuel salt is draired
frox the ccre. Then, -dvring a normal startup, the
graphite and the fuel are preheated and the ccntrcl
rcds are pcsitioned-sb-that the reactor remains subcritical
while it is belnq filled, Certain atncimal circusstarces
could result in criticality and a power excursion -
in the partially filled core., Varicus fcstulated
incidents were surveyed and the worse case was analyzed
in detail, This case involved selective freezirg
in the drain tanks to ccncentrate the uranium in the
molten salt fraction, Physical restrictions cn the
fill rate and safety actions of control rods and gas
control valves limited the calculated pcwer and tem;exature

" excursions sc that any damage to the reactor would

be prevented, Abstractor's note: It was subseguently
shown that the degree of uranium concentration required
for a serious filling accident cannot Le attained by
partial freezing of the salt., Protective circuits

‘accidents that can cause syster damage. Scre tluid fuels

The hydraulic portion of a comtined hydraulic-reutrcnic
matheratical mcdel for determining the effects of
helium gas entrained in the circulating fuel salt
of the MSRE on the neutron flux-to-pressure frequency
response was extended to include effects due tc the
fuel rumr and heliur ccver-gas system. By comparing
the computed results with experimental data, it wuas
ccncluded that rressure perturbations introduced ty
the fuel pump were the main scurce of tlte naturally
occurring neutron flux fluctuations in the freqguency
range of one to a few cycles per seccnd. 1t was also
noted that the arplitude of the neutron flux-to-pressure
frequency-response function was directly rropcrticnal
tc the pressure in the fuel-pump bowl; however, further
work will be required tefore conmrletely satisfactcry

The one-dimensional conservation equaticns describing the

matrix exponential technijue was selected to cttain a
solution for the hydraulic equaticns cver the techniques
ncrrally erployed (nodal or mcdal) for stability studies in
boiling water systems Lecause the validity cf tke sclction

resonant behavior in which the frequency of cscillaticn

Measured periods of natural oscillaticn ranged frcm
thirty minutes at 75 K% to two minutes at 7.5 MW. These
oscillations were lightly damped at lcw power, tut sticnyly

MEASUREMENT OF HELIUM VOID FRACTICN IN THE MSFE FUEL SALT

USING NEUTECN-NOISE ANALYSIS

Oak Ridge Naticnal Laboratory, Tenn.

CRNL-TM-2315 (2ug. 1968), 32 p, 10 fiqg, 17 ref.
Investigaticns were made at the FSRE during pover
operation with uranium-235 fuel tc determine if the
amount of helium gas in the fuel salt cculd Le measured
using peutrcn ncoise analysis. The neutron power
spectral density (NPSL) was measured at differert

. reacter coperating ccnditions and compared with analytical
model predictions of the NPSD tor the same ccrditiors.
Results showed that the principal source of small

- neutron density fluctuation cliserved in the MESRE
is heliur bubbles circulating in the fuel salt. The

- measurements showed that NPSLC in the frequency range
froom 0.5 to 2 cps varied as the sguare of heliunm
void fraction as predicted Ly the model, and that:
the rpinimum void fracticn was more nearly zero than
the previously accepted value cf C.1%. It is ccncluded
that changes in the circulating void fraction can be
inferred with good sensitivity directly frce reutron
'noise measurements, and, concequently, MESL can complement
and enhance the value of the MSRE reactivity fkalance

Neutron flux noise in the MSRE was studied by Fourier

range from 0.1 to 15 cyclessec. Peasurements at varicus
operating conditions and cross correlaticns vith cthet
reactor signals shcved marked changes with changes in the

Tests to determine the neutron flux-tc-reactivity frecuency
resfonse were rerfcrmed on the MSEE with the reactor
at various power levels between zero and full pcver ard
with the reactcr fueled with a 0~235 fuel mixture and
a U1-233 fuel mixture. Test patterns ergployed were pseudo-
randcr binary sequences (PRBS) and pseudorandom ternary
sequences (PETS5) of various sequence lengths ard mirnisum-
pulse-duration times. 1In some tests reactivity (control-
rod position) was forced to fcllow the test pattern,
ard in other tests the neutron flux was forced tc fcllow
the test pattern. The experimental results were analyzed
by several different methods and the results were ccmjared.
The frequency respcnse c¢f the uncontrolled reactor systenm
was found to be in good agreement with thecretical
predicticns for both the U-235 and U-233 fuel lcadings.

CATEGORY INDEX

'The category structure used in the MSRIS appears in outline form on

the next three pages, followed by the index.

The significance of ‘the letter X, which does not appear in the outline

but does appear in category designations elsewhere, requires some expla-
nation. - | |

There are two meanings or uses of the letter X. One is simply as a
"filler." For various reasons associated with the computer, every category
designation, whether it be the primary category‘in'the identification num-

ber or an "other category” in the last line of the entry, must have exactly

3 letters., Thus for category'N which is not subdivided, every abstract is.

designated NXX, Similarly, all abstracts falling into second-order cate-

.gories which are not subdivided have X as the last letter in their category

designation (ABX700054 for example)

The other use of X is to denote a general or broad treatment. This

is the meaning if X appears in place of the letters for established second-

or third-order categories. To illnstrate,'MAX690019 is a comprehensive

description of the MSRE design'(category MA) which discusses general con-

‘siderations and embraces information in third-order categories MAA, MAB,

MAC, and MAD
