Heavy Isotope Burld-Up In Core of U233 Breeder

Je Halperin and R. W. Stoughton

Abstract

The build-up of uramium i1sotopes with time in a U233 breeder core
was calculated for five different cases, the difference depending on the
startang fuel and the 1sotopic composition of the continuously added
make-up fuele The total uranium concentration was found to approach
slowly an equilibrium value of 2.6 to 3.5 times the starting value,
depending on the composition of the make-up fuel. In all cases the net
neutron losses per net neutron reproduced in the core go through a
maximum of less than 1% at a flux-tame of about 3 x 1021, go through a
mimmm of about -~0,6% (1.€. a net gain) at about a flux-time of
L x 1022 s and approach equilibrium values of about 0.3% at flux-times

above 6 x 1023.

The principle heavy i1sotopes in the core of a U233 breeder reactor and their
modes of formataion may be depicted by the following diagrame

The production of these species as well as of several other heavy muclides i1n

the core of a breeder starting with pure U233 has been discussed by'vlsner(l)

the net effect on neutron economy were presented 1In this paper five cases will
be considered with more recent values for the various cross-sections
I Pure U233 in core at start, pure U233 added to core,
ITo Pure U%33 in core at start, y233 containing 5% 23l added to core as
the fuel 1s consumed,
ITI. U233 containing 5% U23h in core at start and added to core.
IVe Pure U235 in core at start, pure U233 added to core.
Ve Pure U235 in core at start, ye33 containing 5% p23l added to core,
In any practical case the core will probably start with U235 *. As this
material 1s consumed U235 will be added at first, and then very soon the added
material should consist of the U233 product produced in the blanket. Some U23h

will be produced in the blanket by neutron capture of the members of the 233

 

O

¥ Actually this starting material will contain about 1,0% U23h, 93¢ 235 and 6%
U238° The U23h and U238 wLll increase the losses over those calculated in this
paper for Cases IV and V at the shorter times, the magnitude of this additional
loss will be about 0,174 at zero time and 1t will steadily decrease with

increasing time.

chain (Th233, Pa233 and U233) and 1t 15 felt that an upper limit on the U23h/U233
ratio for the blanket product will be about 0.05 1f the overall losses are to
be kept wathin reason. Hence any practical case 1s expected to lie somewhere
in between Cases IV and V Cases I, IT and ITI are included for comparison and
because some future reactors may actually start with U233 1n the core The
effect of U237 wall not be considered because 1t 18 expected to be destroyed
predominantly by beta decay and 1ts cross-sections are not known, Its concen-
trations and possible effects have been considered in a previous paper(l)

For Case I the concentration of U233 1s considered constant. Actually its
concentration will increase somewhat as various pile poisons (e.ge fission products,
U23h etc.) grow 1n and 1ts concentration may then decrease somewhat in the core
as 1t increases in the blanket. If the core and blanket are processed
contimiously, however, these effects will reach a steady state value rather soon,
if they are processed batchwise, then the tame average value will be constant
from period to period. The effect of the heavy i1sotope build-up 1tself on
required U233 concentration changes 1s small as will be seen from the small effect
of this build-up on neutron economy,

The values of the various cross-sections used here are gaven in Table 1.

In this case none of the four isotopes has a constant concentration., As
the original 1235 15 consumed U233 is added and a2 relation must be assumed
between these two species, The assumption made here is that 0233 15 added at
such a rate that the net neutrons reproduced in the core fuel i1s kept constant,

Here the single prime indicates contraibution from neutron reactions on the U233

The reason for divading these losses into two components will become apparent in

the dascussion of Case V.

Case V U235 In Core At Start, U233 Containing 5% U23h Added.
Here there are three contributions to some of the 1sotopes (1) that

;' part, (2) that resulting from peutron

resulting from the original U235, the N
reactions on the U233 added, the N. part, and (3) that resultang from the y23l
added with the U233, the N; parte The contributions (1) and (2) have already
been evaluated in Case IVe Item (3) will now be considered and then added to
the other two. For this contribution 1t 15 necessary to know the rate of
addition of U932 and not Just 1ts concentration which 1s fixed by Equation (12),

Using Equation (13) and differentiating Equation (12) gives the net rate of

But 0233 is destroyed at the rate of N;3f<3;(23). Hence the total rate of
addition of U233 is
KNpEE O, (25) + Np3f 03(23)
since the net rate of change of U233 = rate of addition - rate of destruction.
The rate of addaition of U23h 1s r times the rate of addition of U233 (where r
1s the U23}"/Uz33 ratio in the blanket product)es Using Equation (12) wath the
above expression for the total rate of adding U233 the rate of addition of
U23’4 becomes
kN3t G (25) = Hp3f(07,(25) - 03(23))
and the net rate of change of this contribution to the total U23h becomes

The first term in the brackets 1s a constant and the second one varies as Né3.
As will be seen, the calculations may be somewhat simplified if Equation (20)
1s broken up into two equations, one involvaing the constant production term and
the other a negative variable "production" term. Let

Noy = Woplg + Wollys

where the subscripts € and V indicate constant and variable terms, respectively.

Then ( " )

Equation (20a) 1s similar to Equation (1) in Case I where Np3 15 held constant,

 

 
- 12 =
Equation (20b) 1s simlar to Equation (1) wath Né3 being given by Equation (15).
Equations sumilar to (2) and (3) can be written for (Ngg)c, (N;S)V, (Ngé)c and
(Ngé)vp The total solutaon for Ngh will then be a superposition of the solution
given by Equation (L) and that given by Equation (16), that for Ngs, a super-
position of the solutions given by Equations (5) and (17), that for Ngé, a
superposition of the solutions given by Equations {6) and (18). The contribution

1t 1s clear that the solution of the differential equation differing only from
the above by a multiplicative constant in Ky will differ in 1ts solution from

the above by thas same multaplicataive constant in Ky. The coefficients of the
superposed solutions are simply the ratios of the coefficients to N, and

From the figures these conditions are seen to be satisfied.

A summary of the maxamum losses (all at about ft = 3 x 1021), the minimum
losses (all at about ft = L x 1022) and the equilibrium losses (attained at
about ft = 6 x 1023) are presented in Table 2, In the last column of Table 2
are presented the ratios of the total uramum to U233 at equilibrium, these
values are 2,60 1f pure U233 15 added to the core as fuel 1s burned and 3.50
1f 723 containing 5% U234 15 added, Since these two values probably represent
the two extremes (within the accuracy of the cross~-sections andY| values used)
the most likely value may be about 3,0, Depending on the concentration ranges
being considered, this increase in total uranium could cause increased corrosion
rates or solubility troubles. In aqueous homogeneous U233 breeder reactors
the uramium concentration ranges anticipated (a few grams per liter) are low
enough so that a three-fold increase probably will not cause any appreciable
harm,

The losses presented 1n Fig. 4 are instantaneous values at any gaven ft.

 
- 15 =
The integrated average losses up to any ft value in question are presented in
Fige 5 for Cases I and III, as mentioned previously these two cases probably
represent extremes between which any practical case will lie. The integrated
losses are negative (showing a small net neutron gain): between ft values of
about 2 x 10°2 and 5 x 1023, For a reactor with a core flux of about 1.5 x 1015
and with a total fuel hold-up (in core,heat exchanger, chemical processing, etco)
of 44 or & times that in the core, an ft of 1022 corresponds to about one yearts
operation. Hence for such a reactor the integrated net effect of the heavy
1sotope build-up 1s to cause a small neutron gain from about the second to the

fiftieth year of operation,
