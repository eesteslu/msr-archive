ABSTRACT

Maintenance and repair of reactor components by remote
welding will require development of adequate nondestructive
examingtion techniques to assure the integrity of the weld.
High temperature and radiation levels will require remote
inspections and add to the complexity of the performance.
Recommended developments include improved c¢losed-circuit
television for visual examination, evaluation of new high-
temperature penetrants, study of neutron radiography,
improved transducers for ultrasonics, and application of
acoustic emission and eddy currents. Sophisticated mechan-
ical positioning, manipulation, and scanning equipment will
be required for most of the techniques.

 

INTRODUCTION

The long-range economic utilization of nuclear reactors for
production of electrical power requires that practical economic main-
tenance and repair be possible. The latter functions become more
complicated than those encountered in other industry because of the
high temperature and radiation béckground associated with some of the
components. However, despite the difficulties, necessary maintenance
operations in nuclear reactors have been conducted successfully. In
regions of very high radiation background, ingenious mechanical devices
have been developed to allow simple repairs. For example, the
Homogeneous Reactor Test (HRT) was a proving ground for a nunber of

remote maintenance methods.l™ The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)

also demonstrated the feasibility of remote maintenance and repair of
radioactive components.” In both of these examples much of the work was
mechanical (e.g., flanges, bolts, etec.). Relatively little of the past
work has included study of remote welding techniques for repair or
replacement of components. Even less has been done on remote inspection
techniques for welds made remotely. However, despite the paucity of
effort on inspection of remotely made welds, work has been accomplished
toward the remote application of inspection technigues, in both nuclear
reactors®® and hot cells.l” This report discusses the present tech-
nology that may be applicable to the remote examination of welds made
during maintenance operations for Molten Salt Reactors (MSR). Most of

the discussion would be egually applicable to other reactor systems.

(e.g., after removal and replacement of a major component, such as a
heat exchanger). The primary metal for consideration is Hastelloy N,
and a type 300 series stainless steel is considered a potential alter-
nate. The welds are predominantly cylindrical in pipes having diameters
from 1 to 20 in. and wall thicknesses up to 1 in. ILarger cylinders
include the heat exchanger and the core vessel, with diameters of
approximately 5 and 30 ft, respectively.

Anticipated temperatures in the reactor cell range from 1000 to
1200°F. However, localized cooling for both welding and inspection can
probably bring temperatures down to the range 200 to 600°F and possibly
even to 200 to 400°F.

The anticipated level of radiation!?

in the reactor cell ten days
after the system is shut down and drained is expected to be approximately
10° R/hr. The dominant radiation will be gamma rays from relatively
noble fission products deposited on the metal surfaces of the heat
exchanger tubes and on the graphite in the core vessel. The area of
highest dose rate (calculated to be 1.4 x 10° R/hr) is at the midplane
immediately adjacent to a heat exchanger. Values in other portions of
the cell may be 25 to 30% of the maximum. Most of the radiation will
have photon energies of 0.8 MeV and below.

Care must be exercised during the examination to avoid the intro-
duction of materials that could be detrimental to the continued service-
ability of the components. For example, no sulfur-bearing cils and no
aluminum or low-melting alloys should be introduced for contact with
Hastelloy N because they may react to cause loss of desired properties;
Similarly, for stainless steels, chlorine-free materials must be used.

Because of the high radiation and temperature levels in the reactor
cell, personnel access is obviously forbidden. Therefore, mechanical
systems would have to be designed and built to allow remote performance
of the examination. Some attendant restrictions on the mechanical

equipment include the fact that examination equipment must be inserted

 

12J. R. Tallackson, private communication to R. W. MeClung,

into the reactor cell from above through access ports (perhaps 1 ft in
diameter) and be manipulated over distances up to 30 or 40 ft (not
necessarily immediately below an access port). In addition, because of
limited space within the cell, the examination equipment should not

extend outward more than 1 ft from the component being examined.

CUSTOMARY METHODS FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION OF WELDS

Under normal circumstances several methods of nondestructive
examination would be applicable to the examination of welds in Hastelloy N
or stainless steel. These include visual examination, use of 1liquid
penetrants, radiography, and ultrasonic methods. No detailed discussion
of the basic methods is intended in this report. Descriptions will be
limited to those aspects pertinent to remote operation within the
‘restrictions that were previously mentioned. Those wishing more infor-

mation about the methods are referred to the Nondestructive Testing

Visual Examination

Many features about the quality of a weld can be noted by visual
examination. Among the conditions that may be observed are surface
cracks, undercut, overlap, weld irregularity, and dimensional inaccu-
racies. However, the surface appearance alone 1is inadequate to prove
careful workmanship or good internal gquality. The visual examination
should be made before, during, and after the welding and be further
supplemented with other methods of nondestructive examination.

In the stringent environment being discussed, such visual examina-

tion must be done with optical aids, such as closed-circuit television

(CCTV). The CCTV has been successfully applied in radioactive environs
for surveying reactor internals and monitoring operations in hot cells. 1’16
Care must be taken to minimize the effects of high temperature and
radiation on the components of the camera to avoid excessive image

degradation and failure.

Liquid Penetrant Examination

Liquid penetrants containing visible or fluorescent dyes are com-
monly used to detect the presence of surface-connected flaws in welds.
However, the commonly used materials are not applicable at the high
temperature expected in the reactor cell during the examination. A
recent experimental productl7 shows promise of being applicable for
penetrant examination at temperatures as high as 600 to 900°F. At room
temperature the penetrant, remover, and developer are in crayon form.
The high-temperature penetrant was developed for use on multipass welds.
No information is available on the sensitivity to cracks or other dis-
continuities. Use of penetrant techniques in the remote environment
would require the development of procedures for performance and examina-
tion of results. The CCTV previously discussed could probably be used

to advantage.

Radiographic Examination

Radiography is a primary requirement for the examination and
acceptance of welds. However, the excessive radiation levels and high

temperatures to be encountered in the reactor cell raise genuine doubts

about the possibility of valid radiography for the examination of the
remotely made welds. Radiography has been demonstrated and used on
highly radioactive objects in special facilities (e.g., hot cells) and
with special techniques, but in every case significant effort was taken
to minimize the exposure of the film to the background radiation.1820
The film is usually placed for a very short time in a fixed position and
massive shielding prevents most of the background radiation from giving
an overexposure of fog. Similar steps for radiography on any of several
closely associated radioactive components in a reactor becomes so diffi-
cult as to be impractical.

The above discussion and extreme pessimism applies to x- or gamma-
radiography since the customary x-ray film is sensitive to the background
radiation. A potential alternative method of radiography uses neutrons

for neutron radiography (e.g., foils of indium or gadolinium, track-etch
plates such as mica or cellulose nitrate, and neutron-sensitive image
intensifiers) are not sensitive to x- and gamma-rays and thus allow
radiography of highly radioactive specimens (e.g., irradiation capsules
or used fuel elements from nuclear reactors) or radiography of nonradio-
active specimens in the presence of high background radiation. For
example, useful neutron radiography is commonly performed using a neutron
beam accompanied by high intensity gamma radiation from a nueclear reactor.
At the present stage of development of both techniques and equipment,
the sensitivity and resolution of neutron radiography for metals (i.e.,

welds) is less than is expected of x-radiography. Another problem is

the limited choice and capability of portable sources for neutrons.

Despite the problems, limited work has been done on welds, and with
advances in both the technology of neutron radiography and availability
of improved sources (e.g., 2520f), better performance capabilities for
the neutron radiography of welds should be expected. Extensive develop-
ment would be required for equipment to place both source and detector

in proper position near the weld to be examined in the reactor cell.

Ultrasonic Examination

Ultrasonic methods of nondestructive examination of welds have, in
recent years, been used increasingly. There are probably several reasons,
including (1) significant advances in capability of both equipment and
personnel; (2) increased awareness of the ability of ultrasound to detect
discontinuities such as cracks and lack of fusion, which are difficult
to detect radiographically; and (3) desire for the ultimate in confidence
in critical components (as a result many complementary examination methods
are used). Many of the mechanical scanning systems used for ultrasonic
examination of materials lend confidence to the ability to manipulate
probes remotely. The mechanical capability coupled with the minimal
effect of radiation on ultrasonic transducers has led to its utilization
on many occasions for the examination of radiocactive components in both

reactors?7 2% and hot cells.??

However, several problems must be resolved to allow use of
ultrasonics for examination of MSR welds. Welds have been successfully
inspected on many materials, inecluding carbon steels and aluminum.
However, difficulty has been encountered in the application of ultra-
sound to welds in stainless steel and nickel-base alloys. A large
variable attenuation of the sound and the presence of reflections from
grain boundaries interferes with calibration and ultrasonic examination
on such materials. ILaboratory studies should be undertaken to determine
the cause of inspection difficulty and to devise techniques and/or equip-
ment modifications necessary to overcome the problems, allowing high-
confidence ingpection.

Materials to couple ultrasound from the transducer into the weldment
will have to be selected on the basis of susceptibility to reactor con-
tamination or activation, remote applicability, and adequate ultrasound
transmission at the expected temperatures. A potential alternate solu-
tion to the problem of coupling the sound is the use of electromagnetic
induction transducers not requiring a liguid coupling.”®»?” Recent work
has shown that useful ultrasonic vibrations can be generated in specimens
by electromagnetic techniques, but the sensitivity is significantly below
that possible with conventional piezoelectric devices. Further work is
needed to improve the operation of these new transducers before this
method could be considered applicable for the cited inspection of welds.

Mechanical scanning devices will be required to move the transducer
in a preprogrammed plan over the weldment. Accurate positioning of the
transducer may be assured by CCTV. It may be possible to design and
build accessories that can be attached to the mechanical system to be

used for the performance of the remote welding.

ADVANCED METHODS FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION OF WELDS

Because of the difficulties anticipated in applying the common
methods for nondestructive inspection of welds, it may be desirable, or
even hecessary, to develop or improve certaln advanced methods of nonde-
structive examination to provide assurance of weld integrity. Among the

methods that offer promise are eddy currents and acoustic emission.

Eddy Current Examination

Methods using electromagnetic induction of eddy currents have been
used for detecting flaws and measuring electrical conductivity, permeabil-
ity, thickness, and the space between adjacent components. Application
to welds has been sparse, in part because the effective depth of penetra-
tion of the eddy currents is usually small (typically less than 0.1 in.),
and also because unwanted signals due to variations in coil-to-specimen
spacing (lift-off) are difficult to eliminate. The latter would be sig-
nificantly affected by roughness of the weld bead. Recent advances in
eddy-current theory and modeling have led to optimum design of coils and
systems that now allow performance significantly superior to any pre-
viously attainable.?® 720 Advanced instrumentation has reduced the
variations in signal due to lift-off to a negligible quantity.?1™32
Therefore, the eddy-current method deserves new consideration for the

examination of several aspects of remotely made welds.

1. Eddy-current techniques that were developed for the measurement
of space between components®’22* (e.g., coolant channel spacing between
nuclear fuel plates) could be useful for measuring the separation of
surfaces to be joined by welding.

2. Although improvements have been made to the eddy-current method,
it is still limited in its depth of penetration (even though greater
depths can now be inspected than before). However, because of the
guestions concerning the applicability and benefit of liquid penetrant
and visual techniques, eddy currents could be considered as a replacement
for the detection of surface or near-surface defects.??

3. Welds in austenitic stainless steels may crack unless the
deposit contains 4 to 9% ferrite. An eddy-current method can measure
the amount and distribution of ferrite in the weld (as well as other
conditions leading to variations in electrical or magnetic properties)
and determine the tendency for crack formation.

The eddy-current technique has been used in areas of high background

32527 and at the expected temperatures. With proper design of

radiation
the test system, these environmental conditions do not adversely affect
the performance. As discussed under Ultrasonic Examination, the same

mechanism used for welding could probably be used as the basic scanner

for eddy currents.

Acoustic Emission Techniques

All of the previously discussed techniques are applied to determine
the as-fabricated condition of the weld only after the welding operation
is completed. Fach is an active technique in that energy or matter is
applied to the area to be examined (e.g., sonic vibrations, x rays,
penetrants), and changes in the energy or matter are interpreted in
terms of the specimen. The acoustic emission method is a passive tech-
nique in which detectors are used to listen for energy produced within
the specimen as it undergoes a change {e.g., stress waves released at
crack pop-in or propagation). Extensive development on acoustic emission
has been performed recently at several sites.?® 4% Tncluded has been the

shown correlation between acoustic emission and cracking in the welds.

Further study is needed to determine its degree of applicability to the
materials and configurations being considered. No mechanical scanning

would be required for acoustic emission since fixed transducers are

sufficient to detect the emitted energy.

The transducer materials (not necessarily the design) would probably
be similar to those used for active ultrasonic techniques and could
tolerate the short-term exposure to the environmental temperature and
radiation. The coupling of the transducers to the weldment would be
simpler than for the active ultrasonic technique since movement of the
transducer during the examination would not be required. If signals of
acoustic emission are detected, supplementary examinations would be neces-

sary to pinpoint the location of the flaw.

Other Methods of Examination

In addition to the methods mentioned above on which some experience
exists for examination of welds, other new methods of nondestructive
examination should be considered, although near-term applicability may
not be obvicus. Among these are thermal technigques and holography.
Development programs should be continuously surveyed, and, if promising
possibilities occur, feasibility for application to welds should be

studied.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Nondestructively inspecting a remotely made weld at high temperatures
and in a high radiation background is a difficult problem but one for
which worthwhile solutions can be obtained. The anticipated environment
includes temperatures {after cocling) in the raﬁge 200 to 60C°F and
radiation levels (ten days after draining) in excess of 10° R/hr.
Sophisticated mechanical devices will be required to move the inspection
probes and devices remotely into position at the weld to be examined,
and mechanical scanning capability of the weld area must be provided for
several of the methods. Comments on the following methods briefly sum-
marize recommendations to achieve a working system of nondestructive
inspection.

1. Closed-circuit television is recommended for visual examination
of the weld, before, during, and after fabrication and to provide visual

monitoring of the performance of other examination methods. Specially
13

designed equipment will be required to assure proper performance in
the environment.

2. Conventional penetrant techniques are inapplicable. Advanced
high-temperature penetrant techniques should be studied and procedures
developed if feasibility is demonstrated.

3. X~ or gamma-ray radiography is probably impractical because of
the ektremely high intensities of ambient radiation anticipated. Advanced
neutron radiographic techniques should be investigated.

4. Ultrasonic techniques can be performed remotely in the environ-
ment. Work is needed to improve the capability of ultrasonics to perform
calibrated, meaningful inspections on welds in stainless steel and nickel-
base alloys. Techniques must be developed for remotely coupling the
sound from the transducer into the specimen. Advanced studies for
electromagnetic induction of ultrasound (which would not require coupling)
should be made to improve sensitivity.

5. Eddy-current techniques should be developed for measurement of
Joint fit-up, detection of near-surface flaws, and measurement of varia-
tions in the microstructure of the welds as indicated by variations in
the electrical and magnetic properties.

6. Acoustic emission techniques should be pursued for real-time
monitoring of the weld integrity through detection of the stress waves
emitted by the formation or propagation of cracks.

7. Other more sophisticated examination methods should be considered

for application to this difficult problem.
