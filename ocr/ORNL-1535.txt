FOREWORD

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment utilizes the circulating fluoride-fuel as
the primary reactor coolant. It is necessary, however, to employ an additional
coolant whose primary function is to cool the reflector and pressure shell.
Although liquid sodium will be used as the reflector coolant, the use of NakK
had been assumed during the preceding year. Consequently, aconsiderable amount
of consistent, detailed data on the performance characteristics for the reactor
system using NaK as the reflector coolant has been assembled. These data are
presented in this report. A sufficient number of calculations based upon the
use of sodium has been made to assure that the performance with sodium will not
deviate significantly from that calculated for NaK. Sodium 1s being used 1n

preference to NaK because it can be more easily sealed at the pump shaft.

INTRODUCTION

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE) is an experimental, high-tempera-
ture, circulating-fuel reactor being
constructed by the Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion Division of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The fuel is a
mixture of fused fluorides, including
uranium tetrafluoride; the moderator
1s beryllium oxide; and the structural
material 1s Inconel. Figure 1 shows
a schematic diagram of the reactor,
the heat disposal equipment, and the
other process equipment necessary to
the operation of the reactor; also
shown in Fig. 1 are the design-point
pressures, temperatures, and flows at
various polnts 1in the system. This
report contalns a summary of the more
pertinent analytical investigations
of thermodynamic and heat transfer
properties of the ARE.

Considerably more investigations
have been carried out than have been
presented; the investigations omitted
fall in one of the following categories:
1. investigations relating to systems

and items of equipment not actually

used 1n the ARE,

2. 1nvestigations relating to systems
and 1tems of equipment used in the
ARE but with different fluids than
those actually used,

3. 1investigations in which estimated
fuel properties were used that
were found to be incorrect when
additional experimental determi-
nations of fuel properties were
made,

4. routine calculations of tempera-
tures and pressures at various
points of the system that were of
interest only to the detail
designer.

For convenience, the investigations
are presented as they relate to the
following subdivisions of the ARE:

Fuel heat disposal system

Reflector coolant heat disposal system
Control rod cooling system

Preheating and monitoring system
Helium supply and vent system

REACTOR

PRESSURE PULSE RESULTING FROM A
SUDDEN CHANGE IN REACTIVITY

The self-controlling features of
the ARE are due to the expansion of
the fuel with increasing temperature.
A transient increase in reactivity
produces an attendant increase 1in
temperature that increases the volume
of the fuel. Since the reactor has a
relatively fixed volume, some of the
fuel i1s forced out of the core and
the reactivity is reduced. The entire
process occurs 1n a very short time,
and therefore 1t 1s necessary to know
what pressures will be set up in the
fuel tubes when the fuel 1is rapidly
forced out of the core. Figure 2
shows the reactor and connecting piping
to the surge tanks. The fuel can
expand out of the reactor 1n either
direction, but since the path to the
surge tank in one direction (upstream)
is considerably shorter than in the
other, i1t will be assumed that all
the excess fuel takes the shorter path
to the surge tank (this is a con-
servative simplification). Further
assumptions that have been made are:

1. The fuel 1s incompressible.

2. The pressure pulse 1is of suffi-
ciently short duration that the fuel
in the external piping remains es-
sentially fixed in temperature.

3. The Ltemperature and power
variations 1n the reactor core will be
neglected; all the reactor fuel 1s
assumed to be at the mean reactor
temperature, and the power generation
in the fuel 1s always equal to the
mean power generation.

4. The effects of the pressure
pulse on the fuel pumps will be neg-
lected. Precisely what effect this
pulse would have on the pumps 1s
unknown, but the pulse will probably
be of sufficiently short duration that
no permanent damage will be done.

Figure 3¢ 1is a schematic diagram
of the system to be analyzed. There
are two, distinct cases to consider:

the reactor in which the temperature
and the density of the fuel change
with time and the external piping 1in
which the temperature and density of
the fuel are constant., The reactor
will be considered first (Fig. 3b).
The impulse-momentum equation for any
section 1s

(1) - F dt = d(mv)
where
F = differential force on fuel volume,
1b,
t * time, sec,
m = mass in fuel volume, slugs,
v = velocityof fuel volume, ft/sec.

For a fuel volume of cross section 4,
thickness dx, and position x,

(2) m = pA Ax

where

© = mass density, slugs/fta,

A = tube cross-sectional area, ft?,

x = distance along the tube measured

from the reactor outlet, ft,

Since the fuel is incompressible,
all the incremental fuel volume being
generated between zero and x by in-
creasing temperature must pass acCcross
x (on the way to the reactor inlet and
thence to the surge tank) as rapidly
as the i1ncremental volume 1s being
generated. The rate at which incre-
mental volume is being generated
between zero and x 1is

V = volume from x = 0 to any arbi-

Since the rate at which the incremental
volume is being generated must be equal
to the rate at which the volume 1s

o = B P

where v is the incremental velocity
(v - v,) 1n ft/sec and the subscript

Eq. 1, may be rewritten for the volume

For the external piping (Fig. 3c),
where the temperature of the fuel is
assumed constant, Eqs. 1, 2, and 5 are
valid. However, Eq. 3 1is not valid,
because no incremental volume is gener-
ated 1n the external piping. The -
external piping, however, must pass

pressure differentials resulting from
the change in friction pressure drop
assocliated with change in velocity.

The calculations of temperatures
and temperature differences were made
from the following data for beryllium
oxide, NaK, and the metal tube.

Beryllium Oxtde Block. The beryllium
oxi1de block 1s hexagonal in cross
section (3.73 in. across flats). For
simplicity in calculation, the block
was assumed to be a circular cylinder
of equivalent cross-sectional area,
with an outside radius of 1.960 1in,
and an inside radius of 0,630 inch,

Metal Tube. The outside radius of
the metal tube 1s 0.618 in., and the
inside radius is 0.558 1inch., The

expression for the temperature gradient
in the tube 1s the same as that for
NaK, except that Qt is the heat gener-

ated in the beryllium oxide plus the
heat generated in the Nak,

The amount of heat generation 1in
the fuel 1s proportional to the length
of time the fuel resides in the reactor
core. Thus high-velocity fuel will
have less heat generated within 1t
than fuel flowing at a low velocity
and, correspondingly, 1ts temperature
will be lower. Upon looking at the
velocity profile of fuel flowing in a
fuel tube, 1t 1s seen that the maximum
velocity 1s at the center and that the
minimum velocity is at the tube wall.
From this, 1t that a
temperature gradientwill exist between
the outer surface and the center of
the fuel. This temperature gradient
can be determined, and the expression

temperature of the outer surface of

ture of the fuel at the center of the

FLOW OF REFLECTOR COOLANT THROUGH CORE

In the ARE, the pressure shell, the
moderator, and the thimbles of the
control rod and instrument holes are
cooled by the circulation of NaK, The
NaK circuit (reflector coolant cir-
cuit) is shown in Fig. 1.

The coolant enters the pressure
shell at the bottom, flows through
the lattice, and leaves at the top
(Fig. 9). The flow through the core
lattice 1s divided among the annulus
between the outer periphery of the
reflector and moderator can and the
pressure shell, the tubes leading
through the reflector blocks, and the
annuli around the rod and instrument
holes. For adequate cooling of the
moderator and pressure shell, it 1is
necessary to have only a minimum amount
flowing in the
around the rod and instrument holes.
The additional heat that must be
removed from the thimbles will be
carried away by the helium that cools
the rods and instruments. To obtain
this minimum flow, orifice plates
(Fig. 11) were placed in the annuli.

of coolant annuli

There will be a pressure drop in
the fluid when it enters the pressure
shell because of expansion, and when
it leaves there will be a further
pressure drop because of contraction.
In the spaces between the tube sheets
and the pressure shell above and below
lattice, which will act as
plenum chambers, the coolant velocity
will be effectively Thus the
pressure drop in these regions will

be very small. The pressure drop in
the coolant flowing through the core
lattice will be due to contraction,
friction, and expansion. Since the
pressure drop of the fluid inside the
pressure shell 1is due almost entirely
to that i1n the core lattice, the flow
through the various paths will be
directly proportional to the respective
resistances of the paths,

The loss in pressure by contraction
is given by

were considered to be constant. The
values of density and viscosity used

were, respectively,
p = 44.5 1b/ft3
and
pmo= 0.36 1b/hr: ft .

By using Egqs. 32 and 33, the inlet
and outlet losses of the pressure
shell were calculated to be

AP (inlet) = 156.3 1b/ft?
and
AP (outlet) = 78,15 1b/ft? ,
From Eqs. 32 through 35 and the

assumption that the distribution of
flow through the core lattice depends
only on the relative resistance of each

path, the distribution of flow was
found, by trial and error, to be:
FLOW RATE
PATH
T (ft3/sec)
Large annulus 0.108
Tubes through reflector 0.272
Six annuli 0.120

The pressure drop through the
lattice, which 1s the loss in pressure
experienced by the fluid flowing

through one path, was found to be

AP = 19.49 1b/ft? .

If the pressure drop i1in the spaces
above and below the core lattice 1is
neglected, the total pressure drop 1is

AP = 253,9 1b/ft?
= 1.76 lb/in. 2% .

 

HEAT REMOVAL BY THE REFLECTOR COQLANT

A cross section of the reactor 1is
shown in Fig, 9;
in Fig., 12. Molten NaK is circulated
through the reactor to remove the heat
generated i1n the reflector and to cool
the pressure shell and the walls of
rod and instrument holes. In passing
through the reactor, heat is removed

from the following sources in the

reactor by the NakK:

2. heat generated in the pressure
shell,

3. heat generated in the Nak,

core

a. through the serpentine elbows,
through the tube sheets,

c¢. through the “boundary’ between
the core and the reflector,

d. through the walls of the rod
and i1nstrument holes,

The NaK i1in the interstices of the
moderator blocks 1n both the reactor
core and reflector is almost stagnant
and, for the purposes of the following
calculations, is assumed to be entirely
stagnant, Jt 1s assumed that the
electric heaters on the pressure shell
add sufficient heat to the system to
Just balance the heat loss to the
environment; therefore it 1s also
assumed that there 1s no net heat flow

across the outside of the pressure
shell.

Neutron heating aqccurs only in the
beryllium oxide, which constitutes

about 78.5% of the reactor.

reflector the gamma and the neutron
heat generation vary linearly with

0.30 radial distance. That this assumption
1s fairly valid may be observed from

0.0 Figs. 7 and 8. The following equations
for the average gamma and neutron heat
generation at any radius within the

1.55 reflector can be written:

The heat generated in the reflector
is removed by the NaK through various
interfaces; the temperature limitations
of the beryllium oxide and associated
structure are sufficiently far above
the NaK temperature that temperature
patterns in the reflector need not be
calculated.

Heat Generated in the Pressure Shell.
The heat generated in the Inconel
pressure shell 1s due to gamma attenu-
ation and fast-neutron scattering. The

where
knag = thermal conductivity of Nak,

D = NaK passage equivalent diameter,
Pe = Peclet’s number for NakK.

To assure a conservative value for the

draulic diameter of the NaK passage
without the tube elbows was used as
the equivalent diameter of the NaK
passage. The diameter and other
values are

D = 0.667 ft,
kyag = 16.0 Btu/hr-fe? (°F/ft),
Pe = 148, using a velocity of 0.1

lleat Generated in the NaK. The
calculation of heat generation 1in the
NaK in the reactor circuit is rather
complex, and only a gross estimate of
the heat generation is available. The
maximum heat generation in the NaK
will probably be of the order of 10
Rtu/sec- ft®, with the average heat
generation being of the order of 3
Btu/sec* ft®. Since there is approxi-
mately 10 ft® of NaK in the pressure
shell, the total heat generation in
the NaK will be of the order of 30
Btu/sec.

The total heat added to the re-
flector coolant circuit by heat
generation in the reflector, pressure

shell, and NaK 1s
Q = 50.2 + 26.5 + 30 = 106.7 Btu/sec

NaK temperature.

Boundary Between Core and Reflector.
The fuel tubes at the periphery of the
core (near the reflector) are at a
considerably higher temperature than
the reflector, and they transfer heat
into the reflector through the beryl-
lium oxide blocks., An estimate of the
heat transferred into the NaK circuit
by this method has been made. The
system of fuel tubes, NaK tubes, and
beryllium oxide blocks was simplified
and considered as a hollow beryllium
oxide cylinder with internal heat
generation in which the inner surface
1s washed by fuel and the outer sur-
face 1s washed by NaK. The actual
heat transfer coefficients of the fuel
and the NaK in the tubes were calcu-
lated and, from these coefficients,
hypothetical heat transfer coef-
ficients on the sides of the cylinder
were computed so that

otherwise be transmitted to the hole
from the reactor; the passage between
the inner two tubes 1s packed with
insulation; helium flows inside the
inner tube and cools the rod or
instrument and the inner tube wall.
Heat 1s therefore added to the NaK
from the reactor and removed from the
NaK by the helium. Since the two
instrument holes are located in the
reflector and the heat addition to
the NaK from the reflector has already
been accounted for in the calculation
of heat generated 1n the reflector,
only the heat added to the NaK in the
four control rod holes remains to be

calculated. The calculation of the

to that used 1n the calculation of
heat transfer across the boundary of
the core and reflector), the holes
and associated structure were considered
as a hollow beryllium oxide cylinder
with internal heat generation and with
the 1nner surface washed by NaK and

There is some overlapping of fuel
tubes in the sense that some of the
tubes are members of the tube sets
encircling more than one rod hole.
This effect was neglected i1inasmuch as
the heat added to the NaK in the rod
holes smaller 1n
magnitude than the heat added elsewhere
and, a rough estimate of the

The heat removed from the NaK by
the helium flowing through the rod
holes is calculated in chap. 5, ‘Rod
and Instrument Cooling System,” for
the various rods and instruments.

Summary. A plot of the heat added
to the NaK circuit vs, the mean Nak
temperatures for the various sources
of heat addition is shown in Fig. 18,
A plot of the net heat that must be
removed from the NaK in the reflector
coolant heat exchangers vs. the mean
NaK temperature is shown in Fig. 19,
By cross-plotting these two figures,
the mean NaK temperature 1s obtained;
the cross-plot is shown in Fig, 19,
The mean NaK temperature 1is about
1172°F, and at that temperature,
640 Btu/sec (675 kw) 1s removed from
the reactor by the reflector cooling
system. The minimum and maximum NakK
temperatures are about 1105 and 1235°F,
respectively (Fig. 1). The maximum
pressure-shell temperature 1s about
20°F greater than the maximum NakK
temperature (see previous work in
this section) and is therefore about

1255°F,

and pumps and into the inlet manifold
of the reactor, whereit i1s distributed
into the six parallel passes through
the core lattice. Upon leaving the

The pressure drop of the fuel in
flowing through the i1nlet manifold,
core lattice, and outlet manifold 1is
due to factors:
curvature of the tubes or pipes,
contraction losses, expansion losses,
and losses 1n the pipe fittings and

The subscripts have
meanings:

the following

In the pressure drop calculations,
it was assumed that the flow of fuel
would be equally distributed between
the six passes through the core.
Although this 1s a reasonable as-
sumption, 1t 1S not qulte true, as
will be demonstrated by the calculated
data.

The same value of density was used
throughout the calculation, but the
viscosities corresponded to the mean
temperatures in the inlet manifold,
core lattice, and outlet manifold.
The properties used were:

Density, p 187 1b/ft>
Viscosity, p
Inlet manifold 12,5 cp
Core lattice 9.0 ¢cp
Outlet manifold 6.8 cp

The flow rate of the fuel was considered
to be 0.150 cfs. Figure 20 shows
sketches of the inlet and outlet
manifolds. In this figure, the
outlets of the 1nlet manifold are
numbered 1 to 6 and the inlets of the
outlet manifold are numbered corre-
spondingly. Thus outlet 1 of the
inlet manifold 1s connected by a tube
to inlet 1 of the outlet manifold,
etc., and the fluid paths from the
entrance tee of the 1nlet manifold
to the exit tee of the outlet manifold
are given designations such as “l1-1.7
The geometries of the two manifolds
are shown in Figs. 21 and 22. The
these manifolds
were calculated by using Eqs. 88
through 92.

The tubes carrying the fuel through
the core lattice are often referred
to as “serpentine” tubes because each
tube has 10 bends and 11 straight
lengths. For each tube the equivalent
straight length 1s

L = 42,20 f¢.

pressure drops 1n

The pressure drop for each path through
the system being considered was easily
calculated by using the equal flow
rate assumption and Eqs. 88 and 89.

O

The results are tabulated in Table 7.
Of course, as can be seen, the flow
will not be distributed equally among
the six parallel paths through the
core lattice. In fact, the flow rate
may vary as much as 2.5%.  Thus a
maximum temperature difference of the
order of 9°F may exist in the fuel

exit temperatures from the various

SLEEVES

The fuel tubes pass through the
pressure shell heads in the manner
shown schematically in Fig. 23a. The
sleeve connecting the pressure shell
and fuel tube 1s at the pressure shell
temperature at one end and at the
fuel tube temperature at the other
end. At the fuel tube outlet, the
fuel tubes are at 1500°F; the pressure
shell temperature at this point 1is
difficult to determine, but it 1is
probably not less than 1150°F, The
sleeve gains heat from the fuel tube
through the NaK between the tube and
sleeve; the NaK i1s assumed to be
stagnant. Heat lost by the sleeve
to the surrounding helium atmosphere
may be neglected because the helium
is at about 1200°F, The problem
was simplified by considering the
sleeve, the fuel tube, and the NakK
between the sleeve and the fuel tube
as a single cylindrical tube. The
temperature was assumed to be constant
across any cross section of this
cylindrical tube, and an
thermal

average

conductivity for the tube

was used. (The conductivities of NaK

and Inconel are nearly equal.) The

This residual fuel will rise in

know the maximum temperature that

FORMATION OF NONPLUGGING SOLIDS IN
FUEL TUBE IN THE EVENT OF A
SMALL LEAK

In the event of a small leak 1n a
fuel tube, 1t 1s possible that the
NaK entering the fuel tube will
precipitate solids that will adhere
to the walls of the fuel tube. This
deposit can build up to appreciable
thickness before causingany measurable
change in the flow through the fuel
tube. The temperatures which might
existin such a deposit were calculated
by treating the solid deposit as a
flat plate, with internal heat gener-
ation, cooled on one side by the
flowing fuel. The differential
equation and boundary conditions
governing the heat flow are

The values for the maximum temper-

unless the solids found when NaK and
fuel are mixed have a lower melting
point than that of Inconel there 1is
danger that a small leak might result
1in the formation of a solid deposit
which would reach a high enough
temperature to melt the Inconel tube

wall.

FUEL HEAT DISPOSAL SYSTEM

PERFORMANCE OF FUEL HEAT DISPOSAL
SYSTEM

Heat Transfer. The heat added to
the fuel 1n the reactor 1s disposed
of by circulating the fuel to a heat
exchanger where 1t gives up its heat
to helium. The hot helium 1s then
passed through a heat exchanger where
it gives up 1ts heat to water. The
fuel and helium recirculate; the
water 1s dumped. There are actually
four fuel-to-helium heat exchangers
and four helium-to-water exchangers.
These exchangers are arranged (Fig. 1)
so that all four fuel-to-helium
exchangers are 1n parallel on the
fuel side and all four helium-to-water
exchangers are in parallel on the
water side. The helium circuits are
arranged so that there are two parallel
circuits and each circuit contains
two fuel-to-helium and two helium-to-
water exchangers in series (the
exchangers alternate, of course).
Figures 26 and 27 show the details
of the two types of heat exchangers.
The performance of the fuel heat
disposal loop over a range of operating
conditions 1s calculated below.

The fuel heat disposal
obeys the following relations:

system

(1) Q = Wf ¢ (Tf - Tf) ,

(2) Q = wHe CHe (Tl;e - THe) !

(3) Q=W ¢ (T -T) ,

(4) Q = hf-He Af-He 6f-He !

(5) Q - hHe-w He s w He-w !
where

Q = heat transferred, Btu/sec,

W = weight flow, 1b/sec,

T' = maximum temperature, _F,

T = minimum temperature, F,

¢ = specific heat, Btu/lb-*°F,

h = heat transfer coefficient,

Btu/sec‘ft2'°F,
A = heat transfer area, ftz,
§ = effective log mean temperature

difference, °F,

and the subscripts refer to

f = fuel,
He = helium,
w = water,
f-He = fuel-to-helium heat exchanger,

He-w = helium-to-waterheat exchanger.

The heat disposal systemis operated
with the following restraints and
conditions:

1. The fuel flow 1s held fixed at
28.2 1lb/sec.

2. The water outlet temperature
1s thermostatically controlled and
held fixed at 135°F.

3. The water inlet temperature
will vary with the time of year, but
for this analysis 1t has been assumed
to be fixed at 70°F.

4, The mean temperature of the
fuel 1s fixed because the reactor 1is
sel f-controlling to a constant mean
temperature. The design mean tempera-
ture is 1325°F. Calculations were
also carried out for mean temperatures
of 1225 and 1425°F ¢to give some
indication of the effect of a change
in mean fuel temperature.

The helium weight flow 1s the
independent variable; the flow 1s
controlled by variable speed hydraulic
motors which drive the two helium
blowers. The dependent variables are

Q, W, T}, Tf, T;e, and Ty _. Thus

there are six unknowns and si1x equa-

ti1ons: the five equations listed
above and the one i1nherent i1n the
fourth condition, namely:

T + T

f f
(6) ———= a constant .

Before these equations can be

solved, the heat transfer coefficients

and areas must be calculated for the

two exchangers. The over-all hA’s are

REFLECTOR COOLANT HEAT DISPOSAL SYSTEM

The heat added to the reflector
coolant (NaK) in the reactor is dis-
posed of by circulating the NaK to a
heat exchanger where it gives up its
heat to helium., The hot helium is then
passed through a heat exchanger where
1t gives up its heat to water. The
NaK and helium recirculate: the water

The heat transfer coefficients on
the gas side are calculated in a manner
identical to that used for the fuel
heat disposal system calculations (cf.,
Egs. 14, 15, and 16 of chap. 3).

Table 10 contains alist of pertinent
information obtained from heat ex-
changer designs (Figs. 35 and 36) and
the heat transfer relations discussed
above. Values are given for four
different flow rates of helium and four
different flow rates of water; curves
were plotted from these values and used
in the solution of Egs. 1 through 5.

The data of Table 10 were used to
solve the five simultaneous equations
(Egs. 1 through 5) for various values

of the independent variable - heat

Inasmuch as the helium
flow 1s constant (see
the helium weight flow

transferred.
volumetric

restraint 2),
cannot be precisely determined until
the helium temperature at the blower
(Ty,) is known. It was necessary
therefore to assume a helium weight
flow for each power and to solve the
equations by i1teration. The results
of the solution of Egqs. 1 through 5
are shown in Figs., 37 and 38, in which
the minimum and maximum NaK and helium
temperatures are plotted against heat
transferred. The mean NaK temperature
is also shown 1in Fig. 37.

There are six vertical holes in the

COQ LING OF THE SAFETY RODS

During normal reactor operation,
the safety rods are not in the reactor
but are withdrawn into sleeves above
the reactor. The safety rods themselves
are 1n a cool area, and the only cooling
problem, then, 1s that of cooling the
sleeve i1in the reactor. The equations
governing this process are quite
straightforward and are listed below:

Equations 1 through 10 and the

were used to calculate the exit tempera-
ture of the helium and the heat trans-
ferred to the helium; an inlet helium
temperature of 150°F was assumed. The
properties of helium were eva luated
at the mean helium temperature. The
range of helium weight flows considered
was from 0,005 to 0,100 1b/sec, and
the calculations were made for mean
NaK temperatures of 1000, 1150, and
1300°F, The of the com-

By using Egs. 29 through 35 and
noting that the large number of
baffles on the shell side makes the
effective log mean temperature dif-
ference almost equal to the log mean
temperature difference for counterflow,
the performance of the rod cooling
system heat exchanger can be calcu-
lated. Figure 61 shows the result of
such a calculation: the helium inlet
and outlet temperatures are plotted
against the heat transferred. Some
of the pertinent information not
shown 1n Fig. 60 1s tabulated in
Table 12,

The heat removed from the core in
the rod cooling circuit, calculated
in the first section of this chapter,
is about 25 Btu/sec. From Fig. 61,
it may be seen that the minimum and
maximum temperatures in the rod cooling
heat exchanger will be about 110 and
240°F, respectively., The helium will
actually pick up a considerable amount
of heat between the heat exchanger and
the 1nlet to the reactor and, con-
sequently, the 1nlet and outlet
temperatures of the heat exchangers
wi1ll be greater than those listed
above. The inlet temperature to the
reactor will be about 150°F,

MONITORING AND PREHEAT SYSTEM

HEAT LOSS THROUGH INSULATION

The heat loss to the environment of
the various pileces of equipment in the
three ARE pits is complicated by the
fact that the pits are filled with
helium. The helium tends
the air in the pores of the insulation
and thus to 1ncrease the thermal
conductivity of the insulation. The
for the thermal
conductivity of porous 1insulating
materials was derived by Maxwell and

to replace

following formula

14):

and the subscripts

The ARE uses three types of insu-
lation; diatomaceous earth and Superex
for high-temperature insulation, and
felted Asbestos-Sponge for lower-
temperature insulation. The properties
of these insulations are given 1n
Table 13. By using the data of Table

respectively, for the high- and low-
temperature mean thermal conductivities
of helium. The results of the calcu-

REACTOR PREHEATING o

The reactor of the ARE, with its
large mass of beryllium oxide, has the
largest heat capacity of any piece of
equipment i1in the ARE. The reactor must
be raised to a high temperature before
the system can be filled with fuel
carrier, since the fuel carrier has a
melting point of approximately 950°F,
Figures 9 and 12 show elevation and
plan views of the reactor; Fig. 9 shows
the reactor andits thermal insulation,
which is attached to a metal shell
that 1s separate from the reactor,
The heat 1is supplied by electrical
strip heaters strapped to the reactor
itself, The procedure for preheating
the reactor will be the following:
1. turn the heaters on at a power of

10 kw;
2. 1ncrease the heater power as the
pressure shell temperature 1in-

creases so that the heater power
is equal to 10 kw plus the heat
loss through the insulation;

3. when the pressure shell tempera-
ture reaches 1200°F, gradually
reduce the heater power to hold
the pressure shell temperature at
1200°F,

When no further changes in heater

power are required to hold the pressure

shell at 1200°F, equilibrium will have
been attained and the preheat process
completed.

Steps 1 and 2 in the preheat process
imply that a constant amount of heat
1s being added to the reactor, namely,
10 kw. This method of preheating will

ture state being set up in the reactor
after some initial period. A quasi-
stationary temperature means that the
temperature difference between any two
points remalns constant even though
the entire temperature level isrising.

The preheating process can therefore

be broken up into three periods:

1. the initial period before the
quasl-stationary state is obtained,

2. the period when the reactor is in
the quasi-stationary temperature
state,

3. the period after the pressure shell
has reached 1200°F, during which
the heater power is being gradually
reduced and the quasi-stationary
state no longer exists,

The following assumptions were made
for the calculation of the reactor
preheating:

1. The reactor will be represented

by six concentric beryllium oxide

separated by helium shells 0,050 1in,
wide.

2. The pressure shell will be con-
structed of Inconel and will be 48 1in.

The temperature difference between
any radial station in the reactor and
the outside of the pressure shell when

the reactor is in the quasi-stationary

W = weight of material in the
reactor, lb,
Cp = specific heat, Btu/lb*°F,
and the subscripts
BeO = beryllium oxide,

number of the shells, counting inward

estimate, the fact that all the g, 1n

n should be considered. The above
approach 1s a conservative simplifi-
cation, however, because i1t leads to
larger values of A .)

The results of the solution of Egs.

gives the difference in temperature
(in the quasi-stationary state) be-
tween the outside of the pressure
shell and any radial position. The
difference between the outside of the
pressure shell and the center of the
reactor is 162°F.

quasi-stationary temperature state may
be readily calculated. The reactor 1is

probably vary during the preheating

this report assume an ambient tempera-

the heat loss through the insulation
for various pressure shell tempera-

2. The data of King(!?) were used
to evaluate h, ,

3. The dimensions of thermal insu-
lation were:

Outside diameter 76.25 in.

Outside length 80.5 1in.

Thickness 6 in. (4 in. of Superex, 2
in. of Asbestos-Sponge})

4. The thermal conductivity value
for the insulation, as found in the
previous section on “Heat Loss Through
Insulation,” was used.

The results of the calculation are
shown 1n Fig. 65, where the heat loss
through the insulation 1s plotted
against the reactor pressure shell
outer temperature. Temperatures at
other points 1n the reactor thermal
insulation are shown by the dotted line.

The last portion of the preheating
process, that is, when the heater power
is reduced to maintain the pressure
shell outer temperature at 1200°F, 1is
evaluated by a graphical method de-
veloped by Schmidt.(2%) Asa simplifi-
cation, each helium shell 1s divided
between adjacent beryllium oxide
shells, and the Inconel pressure shell
is replaced by an equivalent thickness
of beryllium oxide. The reactor 1s
then treated as a homogeneous cylinder
with a thermal conductivity equal to
the average thermal conductivity of
the composite beryllium oxide and
helium shells. A plot of the tempera-
tures in the reactor for the first 8
hr of the last portion of the pre-
heating period is shown in Fig. 66.

The tubes which contain the control

top and bottom, and there are six such
tubes. Figure 68 shows a sketch of a
typical tube and the passage through
the reactor thermal shield. The helium
inside the reactor thermal shield,
being at a higher temperature than the
room helium, will flow through the

which are kept cool by the use of
space coolers. A typical space cooler
is shown in Fig. 69. Fach space cooler
contains two helium blowers in parallel
(total capacity 7200 cfm) and a water
cooling coi1l. The entire unit was
supplied by the Trane Co. The cooling
coil is a Trane Co., series 93, type S
coil, with a 12- by 48-in. face and
four rows of tubes longitudinal to the
gas flow., The heat transfer coefficient
of such a coil, operating with air on
one side and water on the other, 1s
given 1n ref. 21, for various water
and air velocities. As used 1in the
ARE, these co1ls wi1ll have helium
instead of air on the gas side.

Since 1t was necessary to convert
the performance data from those for
alr-to-water operation to those for
helium-to-water operation, the follow-
ing equation, from which values can be
obtained that are approximately the
same as the actual performance data
given 1in ref. 21, was used:

velocity, that is, the air velocity
which would give the same heat transfer
coefficient as the actual helium
velocity, had to be calculated. Since
the fin efficiency of the coil fins 1s
very close to 100% at all times (sheet
fins of aluminum, 0.012 in. thick,
with the tubes on a triangular pitch
of approximately 1.2 in.), 1t may be
assumed that the gas-side heat transfer
coefficient is a function of the
Reynolds’ number to the 0.6 power.
Since the Prandtl’s numbers for aair
and for helium are about the same at
this temperature and since the geometry
of the co1l is unchanged, the equivalent
air velocity can be calculated from
the following equation:

where
k = thermal conductivity,

© = density,

f = viscosity,

h = heat transfer coefficient,
v, = equivalent air velocity,

Vo = helium velocity.

Since the equivalent air velocity
(calculated above) and the water flow
are known, the over-all hA can be
calculated from Eq. 20.

The equations governing the operation

of the space coolers are

(22) Q= Wy, (Ty, - Ty.)

He

(23) Q= W,e (T, -T,),

(24) Q = h46 ,

where

Q = heat transferred, Btu/sec,

£ = log mean temperature difference,
OF’

W = weight flow, 1lb/sec,

c, = specific heat, Btu/1b*°F,

T' = maximum temperature (also equals
ambient temperature), °F,

T = minimum temperature, °F,

and the subscript w refers to water.
The system operates under the following
restraints and conditions:

1. The helium flow is 7200 cfm at
blower temperature.

2. The outlet water temperature 1s
thermostatically controlled to be 100°F.

3. The inlet water temperature
varies with the season of the year but
is assumed to be 70°F for this calcu-
lation,

Equations 20 through 24 and the
restraints and condition listed above
can be used to evaluate the performance
of the space coolers. Figure 70 shows
the variation of heat transferred vs.
ambient temperature for one of the
space coolers. (The heat exchanger
pit contains four such units; the
other pits each contain two units,)
The difference between the maximum
helium temperature (ambient) and the
minimum helium temperature 1is small;
that 1s, 1t varies from about 0.2 deg
at a heat load of 25 Btu/sec to about
1.6 deg at a heat load of 200 Btu/sec.

The heat rejected to the ambient
atmosphere in the three ARE pits from
the various items of equipment 1in the
pits, calculated in the previous
section on “Heat Loss Through Insu-

lation,” is tabulated in the following:
Reactor pit 30 kw
Heat exchanger pit 135
Dump tank pit 75
Total 240 kw

The three pits are interconnected by
passages of relatively small flow area.
Therefore the pits will not operate at
the same temperature, nor will they
operate at the temperatures which
would exist 1f the pits were com-
pletely sealed from one another. The
pit operating temperatures were calcu-
lated for the two extreme cases (pits
at the same temperature; pits completely
independent) by using the data of
Fig. 70, which gives the space cooler
performance, It was assumed that the
heat loss from the pits to the outside
through the concrete walls could be
neglected; this 1s a conservative
assumption. Table 17 gives the heat
losses 1n the pits.

The pits will therefore operate at a
temperature of about 110 to 120°F, Tt
should be noted that all the heat loss
calculations in the section on “Heat
Loss Through Insulation’’ were made with
an assumed ambient temperature of 130°F
Therefore the heat losses listed in
Table 17 are slightly low. The dif-
ference is quite small, however, inas-
much as the surface temperature of most
of the equipment losing heat is from

1150 to 1500°F,

TEMPERATURE PATTERNS IN THE MONITORING

systems of the ARE are entirely enclosed
in ametallic envelope (Fig. 71). This
envelope consists of concentric tubing

The locations where the heat distri-

critical are in the fuel dump-and-fill
lines. As may be noted from the
position of the valves in Fig. 2, the
fuel dump-and-fill lines may stand full
of stagnant fuel during the operation
of the reactor., Consequently, in the
event of a heater failure, it 1is
possible for the fuel carrier to freeze
in these lines and make dumping of the
reactor impossible, However, a helium
bleed line will be connected to the
fuel-carrier line to prevent drainage.

investigated for several helium
velocities 1in the monitoring system.
For the investigation, 1t was assumed
that the lines were filled with the
fuel carrier. Figure 2 shows the pipe
line to the fuel dump tank; Fig. 72
shows a wiring diagram of a typical
set of electric heaters, which are in
the form ofhalf cylinders and surround
the lines shown in Fig. 2. Tt may be
noted from Fig. 72 that three sections
of electric heater, each consisting of
one half cylinder 8 1in. long, are
connected 1n series and that the
failure of any one heater results 1in
the failure of the other two. The
three heaters are separated so that
they are not adjacent to one another.
For the type of heater failure con-
sidered i1n the following analysais, 1t
1s assumed that two sets of heaters
fail and that these are exactly opposite
each other on the pipe line,

The system, as set up for analysas,
1s shown in Fig. 73e. For simplicity,
the heat produced by the electric
heaters 1s assumed to be generated
directly in the wall of the concentric
tube which serves as the metallic
envelope. The pipe line 1s divided
into seven sections:

1. Sections 1 and 7 are the un-
affected areas of the pipe lines up-
stream and downstream of the area
where the heater failures occurred.

2. Sections 2, 4, and 6 are the
areas where the heaters on both sides
of the pipe failed.

3. Sections 3 and 5 are the areas
where the heaters (which separate the
failed heaters) are still operative.

In the steady-state condition, the
fuel pipe temperature will be equal to
the temperature of the flowing helium.
Therefore only the heat transfer be-
tween the helium, themetallic envelope,
and the outside environment needs to
be considered. The heat balance 1n a
given section of pipe line 1in the
steady-state condition 1s given by

There are nine arbitrary constants

have a different value in each of the

Chapter 7
HELIUM SUPPLY AND VENTING SYSTEM

TRUE HOLDUP OF FISSION GASES IN TANKS

The fission gases removed along
with helium through the various gas
vents 1n the fuel circuit are held up
in the pipes and tanks of the off-gas
system (Fig, 79) until the activity
in the fission gases is reduced suf-
ficiently to permit their being
discharged into the stack. The holdup
time of the gases in pipe lines or
similar shapes of large length-to-
diameter ratio 1s readily calculated
as the pipe volume divided by the gas
volume flow rate. All the gas is held
up substantially the same amount of
time. In large tanks or similar shapes
of small length-to-diameter ratio,
the average gas holdup time is the
same as 1n a pipe line of similar
volume. However, because of the
mixing of the gas in the tank, not
all the gas 1s held up for substantially
equal periods; that 1s, some of the
gas leaving the holdup tank is held
up for much less than average time and
some for much more than average. The
true activity of the gases leaving the
holdup tank (Fig. 80) of the off-gas
system has been calculated and
compared with the activity which would
be present 1f all gases were held up
for equal periods.

The mixing of the gas 1n the tank
1s due to convective and diffusive
forces and occurs fairly rapidly
compared with the average holdup time
in the tank. Thereasonably conservative
assumption was made that the gas
entering the tank mixes instantaneously
with the gas i1n the tank. The follow-
ing definitions were made for the
calculations:

N = flow rate of gas,

V = tank volume, ft3,

C(t)

cfm,

concentration of gases of
age t, that is, C(t) dt equals
the ratio of the volume of gas
with age from t to t + dt
compared with the total tank
volume, V (age is used here to

mean time measured from the
time the gases enter the off-
gas system),

t = time,

Then,

min,

(1) C(t + dt) dt
N
= C(t) dt - C(¢t) dt'jfdt ,

C(t + dt) - C(t)

 

(2) P = - C(t)ﬁf’

(4) C(t) = K e~ (N V)t

The energy, E(t), in the fission

iodine removed previously) at time
t 1s plotted against t in Figs. 81,
82, and 83 for the separate xenon and
krypton 1sotopes and for the total
of these isotopes. For the determi-
nation of E(t), 1t was considered that
there had been 200 hr of reactor
operation prior to time zero and that
the fission gases had subsequently
decayed time t.

where t, 1s the age of the oldest
gases 1n the tank. The total energy
in all the fission gases developed
may be used since the final answer
desired 1s a ratio.

It 1s 1mportant to note that for
Eq. 10 1t is assumed that all the

gases 1n the tank contain equal amounts
of fission gases. This is obviously
not true of the gas originally in the
tank., Thus, at the beginning of
operation, the value of R is actually
less than 1s predicted by Eq. 10. The
highest possible values of R will
occur after long periods of operation,
and Eq. 10 will therefore be evaluated
with t, sufficiently large for the
contribution to the total activity of
the gases of age greater than t, to be
neglected.

The curve of E(t) vs. t shown in
Fig. 83 for the total energy of all
xenon and krypton i1sotopes was broken
up into a series of M segments between
t, and t_, and an equation of exponential
form was fitted to each segment.

The data and results of the calcu-
lations for the particular problem of
the first holdup tank in the off-gas
system are given in Table 19,

As a check on whether the intervals
selected were small enough, the
interval between t;, and t, was divided
into two parts. Recalculation of the
data for the smaller intervals is
given in Table 20,

The valueof 295 checks very closely
with the value of 296 calculated for
the original intervals, and thus the
intervals selected were probably small
enough.

The final answer, then, is that the
actual activity of the gases coming
out of the tank 1s 23% greater than
the activity which would be present

TEMPERATURES IN THE HELIUM VENT LINES
CONTAINING FISSION GASES

The off-gas system carries gases
from the surge tanks, the dump tank,
and the pits to the exhaust stack
(Fig. 79). At times, a portion of
these gases will be radioactive fission
products. The gas flow rate is
generally quite low, and the question
arises as to what temperatures will
exlist on the off-gas system with
essentially stagnant radioactive
gases 1n the system. The total energy
ofall the fission gases produced after
200 hr of reactor operation at 3
megawatts is about 14,8 Btu/sec for a
delay time of 1 1/2 minutes.(??) The

surge tanks enter a fuel vapor trap
(Fig. 84) and then a 2-in. IPS pipe.
The trap and the pipe are the critical

For proper operation, the fuel

vapor traps must be maintained at
1500°F, The traps are
covered with electric heaters and
insulated. The heater power 1is
controlled by thermocouples which
measure the trap temperature. The
heat input required to hold a trap
at 1500°F is about 0.71 Btu/sec
(cf., chap. 6, section on ‘‘Heat Loss
Through Insulation” ). The energy
loss through the insulation would more
than be balanced by the energy in the
and the heaters could

therefore

fission gases,

 

be shut off as the fuel vapor trap

began to heat up slowly. The heat
capacity of the vapor trap, including
contained liquid, is about 13.2 Btu/°F.
A tabulation of the energy dissipations
and of the temperatures of the vapor
trap at various times 1s given 1in
Table 21. The vapor trap temperature
would be increased by only about 40°F
at the end of 20 min, and the heaters
would have to be turned on again
as the fission gases further decayed.

The 2-in. IPS pipeis neither heated
nor insulated, and therefore Eq. 15
may be used to calculate the pipe
outside temperature (the inside temper-
ature 1s not greatly different). For
an emissivity of 0.5, the pipe outside
temperature necessary to dissipate

0.265 Btu/sec*lineal ft is about 380°F,

VACUUM PUMP PERFORMANCE

There are two vacuum pumps in the
off-gas system (Figs. 79 and 85).
They serve many purposes, but their
most severe requirement is that they

If a leak develops 1in the systenm,
it may be desirable to remove all the
NaK from the system. In order to boil
off NaK at 1200°F, a pressure of
about 100 mm Hg or less must be
maintained. The following calculations
were made to determine the maximum

size of leak which might exist and
still permit the vacuum pumps to

The values of volumetric flow, dV/dt,
as calculated from the pump-down test
results, are given in Table 22, The
values are for pump 1nlet conditions;
that 1s, the pressure 1s equal to the
system pressure and the temperature 1is
approximately 560°R, since the gas is
cooled before 1t reaches the vacuum
pumps.

The vacuum pumps are of the rotary
positive displacement type, and 1t
would therefore be expected that the
volumetric flow would decrease slightly
with decreasing pressure, since the
leakage past the rotor increases. It
1s apparent from the calculated values
of volumetric flow, dV/dt, that the
curves of Fig. 88 are probably somewhat
inaccurate., The 1naccuracy 1s not
entirely unexpected because the
information for Fig. 88 was obtained
by measuring the slopes of the curves
of Fig. 86, and the measurements were
not highly accurate. The accuracy 1s
of the orderof t10%, however, which 1s
sufficient for the purpose of the

problem.
The valuesin Table 22 for volumetric
flow are for pumping air. The leakage

past the rotor when pumping helium may
be somewhat higher than when pumping
air, but 1t is probably accurate
enough to assume that the volumetric
flows are the same for both helium and
air.

The volumetric flow of helium
through a leak can be approximated by
considering a hypothetical “leak” in

Chapter 8
DUMP AND FILL SYSTEM

FUEL DUMP TANK COOLING

The heat generated in the fuel
after shutdown of the reactor can
easily be taken up by the heat capacity
of the fuel and the fuel system without
overheating. However, once the fuel
is in the hot fuel dump tank, 1t is
desirable to keep the temperature of
this tank below a reasonable level.
Therefore heat is removed by allowing
helium to pass through the 91 coolant
tubes of the tank (Fig. 89).

It 1s postulated that the maximum
heat removal rate necessary is 50
Btu/sec. The problem of cooling this
tank does not lend i1tself readily to
analytical calculation. However, the
cooling was analyzedby free-convection
calculations and by chimney-effect
methods., Both methods are outlined
below.

The equation for free convection
heat transfer is

(1) Q. = hAs |
where
¢, = heat removed by convection,
Btu/sec,
h = free-convection heat transfer

coefficient taken at mean helium
temperature, Btu/sec:ft?-°F,

A = 91 times surface area of inside
of a coolant tube, ft?,
f = temperature difference between

the 1nside surface of tube and
mean helium temperature, °F,

The value of the free-convection
heat transfer coefficient for each
helium temperature was calculated from
the Nusselt’s number. The Nusselt’s
number 1s given as a function of the
product of Grashof’s and Prandtl’s
numbers on p. 525 of ref. 14. It
1s realized that the length-to-diameter
ratio of the coolant tube 1s too
great for use of these correlations;
however, they were theonly correlations
available, and an order of magnitude
estimate could be gained by using
them,

The i1inside diameter of each coolant
tube 1s 2.067 in. and the length is
3.1 feet. The temperature of the
inside surface was taken to be 1325°F
over the entire length of the tube.

Mean temperature valueswere assumed
for the helium 1n the coolant tube,
and from these and Eq. 1, a curve was
obtained of heat removed vs. mean
helium temperature. The mean tempera-
ature corresponding to a heat removal
rate of 50 Btu/sec is 1025°F. This
corresponds to an outlet temperature of
1920°F, since the inlet temperature
was assumed to be 135°F. A lower
outlet temperature would mean a greater
heat removal rate. Thus, apparently
the dump tank will be adequately
cool ed.

The chimney-effect method makes use
of the fact that a buoyant force acts
on the air in the coolant tube because
of a density difference. This buoyant
force 1s

V = volume, fts,
Powp, = density of helium at room

the total heat removed is 91 x 0. 59

HEATING OF FILL TANK WITH CENTRALLY
LOCATED DIP TUBE

Upon heating a flush-and-fill tank
containing helium, the temperature
of the dip tube will lagthe temperature
of the helium and metal walls of the
tank during the heating process
(Fig. 90). The temperature of the
helium will follow very closely the
temperature of the tank walls,

Heat is transmitted to the dip tube
by free convection of the helium and
by thermal radiation from the wall,
The difference in temperature between
the dip tube and the wall has been
determined at various wall temperatures
for certain heating rates.

OTHER INVESTIGATIONS

AFTERHEAT IN FISSION PRODUCTS

In order to analyze many of the
problems which arise 1n the ARE,
1t 1s necessary to know the decay
energy of the fission products at
various times after reactor shutdown.
Reference 23 gives the average dis-
integration energy of the fission
products as a function of time after
fission. This curve (ref. 23, Fig. 6a),
reproduced as Fig. 92 of this report,
cannot be used directly, however,
because the fissions 1n the reactor
occur over a considerable period of
time and the fission products, conse-
quently, have a wide range of ages.
The decay energy of the fission products

may be expressed as

For these calculations, 1t was
considered that the power had been
constant and equal to 2850 kw, which
equals 2700 Btu/sec or 1.78 x 101!°
Mev/sec. If it is assumed that there
is 190 Mev of energy released per
fission, then the fission rate, P, 1is
9.37 x 10'® fission/sec. Substitution
of these values for P and K in Eq. 1
gives

(2) Q=14.22 {2 q(t) dr .
t)

In order to integrate Eq. 2, it 1is
necessary to find a function to fit
the curve of g(t) as given in Fig. 92,
This was done by dividing the curve
into three parts and fitting each of
these parts with a different power

function. The resulting equations are
(3) g(t) = 0,708 ¢0%-72

(4) q(t) = 6.43 ¢~ 116

(5) gq(t) = 3.27 ¢=1-2 4+ 95, 4 ;=14
(Eq. 5 is the equation recommended in

ref. 23 for old fission products).

Equations 3, 4, and 5, were used for
integrating Eq. 2 for various values
of time after reactor shutdown (1t,)
and for 100 hr of reactor operation
(t, = t, + 3.60 x 10°). The results

are tabulated in the following:

These values of decay energy include
the energy carried by neutrinos. The
energy of the neutrinos is essentially
unabsorbable and, consequently, the
actual absorbable decay energy of the
fission products 1is less than that
tabulated above. A rough estimate of
the absorbable energy can be obtained
by takingone half thetotal energy, ¢ %%’
with the results shown in Fig. 93,
where the absorbable decay energy in
the fission products is plotted as a
function of the time after reactor
shutdown for the conditions of this
case (2850 kw, 100hr, 190 Mev/fission).

The bulk temperaturesof the fluids
in the fuel and NaK loops of the
ARE are measured by thermocouples
welded to the outside of the pipe
walls 1n which the fluid flows. The

most serious case, that is, the fuel
circuit (Fig. 94).

Since the fuel film temperature
drop is small and the Reynolds’
numbers are high, the difference
between the fuel bulk temperature
(the so-called ‘mixing cup” tempera-
ture) and the fuel maximum temperature
will be very small. The total differ-
ence between the fuel bulk temperature

At other thermocouple locations in
the fuel circuit, the temperature
drop 1n the fuel film 1s less than the
drop calculated above because the above
conditions i1nclude the minimum i1nsu-

lation thickness and the minimum
Reynolds’ number encountered in the
system. The temperature drop in the
