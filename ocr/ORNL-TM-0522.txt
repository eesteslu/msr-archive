DESIGN STUDIES AND COST ESTIMATES OF TWO FLUORIDE VOIATILITY PIANTS

W. L. Carter, R. P. Milford, and W. G. Stockdale

ABSTRACT

Design studies and cost estimates were made for two on-site, fluoride vola-
tility processing plants. Each plant was assumed to be processing continu-
ously irradiated LiF-BeFs-ThF4-UF4 fuel from a one-region Molten Salt Con-
verter Reactor (MSCR) capable of producing 1000 Mwe (ca. 2500 Mwt). One
plant processed fuel at a rate of 1.2 fts/day, the second at 12 fta/day.
The smaller plant was designed and cost estimated for two processing con-
ditions: (1) retention of the waste salt for Pa-233 decay and recovery by
a second fluorination, and (2) discard of all Pa-233 as waste after the

-~ first fluorination. The larger plant was considered only for the case of
Pa-233 decay and recovery. The following capital and direct operating
charges were estimated:

Capital Cost Operating Cost
1.2 £t3/day Plant with
Pa-233 Recovery 12,556,000 1,103,000
12 :E"bs/de.y Plant with '
Pa-233 Recovery 25,750,000 2,241,000
1.2 £t3/3day Plant with
Pa-233 Discard 10,188,000

The chemical processing scheme consisted of volatilizing uranium as UFg by
treating the molten salt with elemental fluorine at about 550°C. The hexa-
fluoride was then collected by absorption on NaF and condensation in cold
traps, reduced to UF4 in a Ha-Fp flame, dissolved in make-up salt, and re-
cycled to the reactor. Make-up fuel was supplied by purchasing fully en-
riched J-235. The 1Li, Be and Th components of the fuel were discarded with
fission product waste.

Capital cost and operating cost estimates have been prepared for two
on-site fluoride volatility processing plants. The respective plants are
designed to treat 1.2 and 12 £t3/day of an irradisted LiF-BeF,,~ThF) -UF,,
fuel from a Molten Salt Converter Reactor (MSCR) which has a conversion
ratio of about 0.8. The uranium-free fuel has the compcsition 68-23-9
mole % LiFmBngwThFh; approximately 0.66 mole % UF& is required for crit-
icality in the equilibrium reactor.

The assumed reacztor and chemical processing plant environment is a
1000 Mwe (ca. 2500 Mwt) central power station. This power is generated
in a single reactor which is 15 ft in diameter by 15 ft high. The one-
region system is 90 vol % graphite and 10 vol % fuel contained in an
INOR-8 shell. Heat is removed by circulating the molten fuel salt through
the core and external heat exchangers at an average temperature of approx-
imately 1200°F. Spent fuel is removed semi-continuously every 3-5 days
for reprocessing; make-up fuel (U-235 + Th) is added on the same schedule.
Total fuel volume is 1780 fts,

The chemical reprccessing plant utilizes fluoride volatility to re-
cover decontaminated uranium. Neither thorium nor the carrier salt
(1IiF + BeFe) is recovered; both are discarded as waste with the accom-
ranying fission products. In one phase of this study the waste salt was
retained 135-175 days to allow Pa-233 decay and recovery by a second
fluosrination. In a second phase of this study protactinium was discarded
with the waste salt immediately after fluorinstion. After fluorinationm,
all of the recovered UFE is burned in a Hg”Fé flame for reduction to UF#
which is dissolved in make-up IiF-BeF2=ThEu and returned to the reactor.
Make-up uranium (U-235) is also added at this point.

The accuracy and confidence level of any cost estimate depends upon
the amount of design detail. In this study all of the process operations
were considered in enough detail for preliminary designs of vessels and
equipment; complex vessels were considered mcre carefully to permit more
reliable cost estimation. The process building was laid out for conven-
ience of process operations and maintenance and was patterned after de-

signs of cother remctely operated plantsl that are the products of several
years experience and study. Cognizance was taken of the fact that the
reactor and chemical plant are an integral operation and can share cer-
tain facilities.
The treatment of protactinium in this study was made in the two

ways mentioned above to determine if there were sufficient value in the
protactinium to justify its recovery from the waste. The capital cost
cf the 1.2 ft3/day plant was estimated for the cases of complete Pa-233
discard and for Pa retention until the undecayed Pa amounted to only
0.1% of the bred uranium. The economics favored complete Pa discard
since considerable process equipment and building space were required
for this "dead" storage. A more complete evaluation of the process might
reveal that more favorable economics result from & nominal extension of
the prefluorination storage period allowing more Pa-233 decay at this
point. Increased process equipment, building and inventory charges would
have to be compared with the value of additional Pa recovery. This lat-
ter analysis was not made in this study.

The estimated capital costs cf the two fluoride volatility plants
are $12,556,000 and $25.750,000, respectively, for the 1.2 ft3/day and
12 ft3/day plants for the case in which the waste is retained for Pa-233
decay and recovery. For the case of complete Pa-233 discard, a capital
cecst of $10.188,000 was estimated fer the 1.2 fts/ﬂay plant. A summary
¢f the ccst data is given in Table 1.1, and these same data are plotted
in Fig. 1.1, 1In drawing the curve, 1t is assumed that the cost data can
be represented by a straight line on a log-log plot. The slope of this
curve is 0,312 which may be compared with a value of 0.6 that is custom-
arily associated with a capital cest vs capacity curve for a chemical
plant. The lower value fcor the slope suggests that more favorable re-
processing economics will be realized with large processing plants.

irect cperating costs for each of the plants employing Pa recovery

were calculated and are summarized in Table 1.2. The labor charges corre-
spond te 104 employees for the 1.2 ft3/day plant and 133 for the 12 ft3/day
plant. It is of interest to note the relationship between operating and
capital costs for each of the plants. When the operating cost is divided
by the corresponding capital investment; the operating charge rate be-
comes 8.77%/year and 8.61%/year for the 1.2 and 12 ft3/day capacities,
respectively. These charges may be compared to a value of 15%/year that
has been found to be generally applicable in the chemical industry.

In the analysis of the 1.2 fts/day plant employing Pa-233 discard,
the on=-site, interim waste storage time was optimized. The optimization
was carried cut by considering cn-site storage costs versus salt mine
permanent storage ccsts as a function of the age of the waste salt. The
lowest tctal storage cost appeared to cccur for an on-site holdup of about

1100 days hefcre shipping toe permanent storage.

2.0 INTRODUCTION

The utilization of thorium as a reactor fuel is being investigated
in several reactor systems which show promise of having a breeding ratio
greater than unity or at least a high conversion ratio, that is, a
conpversion ratio greater than about 0.5. This report covers that portion
of a study concerned with processirg spent molten fluoride salt from a
one-region, converter reactor for recovery of decontaminated uranium,

It is the purpose of this study to develop capital cost data for fluoride
volatility processing plants capable of processing 1.2 and 12 ftB/day cf

A
nolten fluoride fuel,

2.1 Reactor Description

The reactor for which the chemical plant has been designed is
fueled with a molten salt mixture that is basically 68-23-9 mcle %
LiF-BeF,-ThF) containing sufficient UFy, ca. 0.66 mole %, to maintain
criticality. The reactor is a one-region assembly whose core has the
approximate composition of 10 vol % fuel solution and 90 vol % graphite;
the geometry is a right circular cylinder about 15 £t diameter by 15 ft
high. Fission energy is removed by circulating the fuel solution through
the core and an intermediate heat exchanger which is cooled by a barren.
salt solution. The barren salt in turn dissipates the heat in a steam
generator which produces 1000CF steam at 2000 psia. The average reactor

temperature is 1200%F.

The assumed enviromment for the reactor is that of a central,
power-producing facility generating 1000 Mwe at a thermodynamic efficiency
of approximately 42.3%. This load is committed to one reactor supplying
steam to two turbo-generator sets. The calculated fuel volume for the
station is 1780 ft3. The total uranium inventory, which includes all
isotopes from U-233 to U~258, is about 4200 kg; of this total the
fissionable component, U-233 + U-235, is in the range 2627 to 2815 kg
depending upon the processing rate. In addition the system contains
52,000 kg Th and 90.7-96 kg Pa-233. For this study it was assumed that
the system had a nowinal conversion ratio of 0.8, the remainder of the

fuel being supplied by purchase of fully enriched U-235.

2.2 Design Bases
In any study of this type the accuracy and confidence level of the

results depends upon the amount of design detail. More or less arbitrary

design bases were established to govern the extent of the study and to

augment those design conditions which were more firmly established. In

this respect the following rules were follcowed:

l.

The chemical processing plant and reactor power station would

be an integrated facility; i.e., on-site processing.

The design would be based as much as possible on existing tech-
nology; extrapolation of technology would be done only when

absolutely necessary.

A cost estimate would be made for each of two plants~-one
processing fuel at a rate corresponding to an estimated optimum
reactor cycle time, and a second processing fuel at an estimated
minimum reactor cycle time. These two estimates would then be
uged to determine processing costs at other processing rates by
interpolation or extrapolation. In doing this it would be
assumed that the capital cost versus throughput data could be
represented by a straight line on a log-log plot. For this
study the processing rates were 1.2 and 12 f£t°/day of fuel
containing respectively 2.83 and 28.3 kg U/day.

The fluoride vaolatility process would be used to recover
uranium which would be returned in tofo to the reac%or. No
thorium or LiF-BeF2 carrier salt would be recovered but would
be discarded as waste with the accompanying fission products.
This was a necessary decision because no developed process
exists for separating LiF-BeFp-ThF) salt from fission products.

The waste salt, which contains Pa=-233, would be held for Pa
decay and recovery until the undecayed Pa amounted to only
about 0.1% of the bred U~233. rAfter the second fluorination,
waste salt would be held 1000 days for fission product decéy
before transport to permenent waste storage. (See Section 7.0

for a modification of this basis.)

6. pThe.chemical'processingplant would share certaih facilities

- with the reactor plant, Teley cooling water, potable water,
stack, electrical services, steam, compressed air, storm and

| sanitary sewers, railroad and barge docks, shipping and
.receiving facilities, etc. These services were assumed avall-
able from the reactor site. The chemical plent bore the cost

of extending the services and, in the case of the stack, bore
the cost of increasing the stack size.

T. The extent of the design would be that which'completely defined
the process to ‘the point of having & preliminary design on all
-major process equipment. Building and auxiliary service space
would be determined in the light of biologleal shield require-
'ments and accepted operating practices for a remotely maintained .
radiochemical plant._ In this regard experience and studiesl’
on the Savannah River type plant were referred to for design of
several areas of the building.

extremely stringent design requirements on the fluorinator. Because of

a rather high corrosion rate of about one mil per hour of fluorination
time, it_is desirable to have the fluorinator designed as inexpensively

as possible and accessible for quick replacement. If the fluorinator were
required to dissipate excessive quantites of fission product decay heat
plus heat from the exothermic fluorination reaction, the vessel would have
to be constructed somewhat like an expensive heat exchanger;B* frequent
replacement of such a vessel would create an intolerable expense. Conse-
quently, a basis of design was that fuel would be held until the fission |
product activity was low enough that the fluorinetor could dissipate its
heat load by radiation and convection to the cell environmment. For the

two plants the feollowing prefluorination conditions were egtablished:

Withdraw batch from reactor every 3 days 5 days
No. storage vessels 2 6
Average storage time (days) T 27.5
Average storage temperature (°F) 1200 1200

3.2 Fluorination
After prefluorination cocoling the molten salt mixture is fluorin-

ated hatchwise at about SOOOC te quantitatively remove uranium as

<

olatile UF6. Relatively few fission products form veolatile fluorides

o the decontamination factor in fluorination is quite high. The

0

principal fission product fluorides that volatilize are those of Ru,
Nb, Zr, Cs, Mo and Te. Fuel from the small plant (k.5-day cooling)
would alsc contain some 8-day I-131 which would be exhausted with the
product in fluorination. However, laboratory testsli have shown that

icdine can be effectively separated from UF6 in the NaF absorption step.

 

“Nete Figs. 4.3 and k.4 for examples of cooling equipment for radioactive

molten salt solutions.
Little, if any, protactinium is expected to volatilize during
fluorination so that the barren waste salt contains potentially fissile
material . The waste stream is retained to allow Pa-233 to decay to &

tolerably low level; U-233 is then recovered in a second fluorination.

3.3 Waste Storage

After the second fluorination, barren salt containing the bulk of
the fission products is held in interim storage for about 1000 days to
rermit fission product activity to decrease to a level that dces not
complicate transportation to permanent waste storage. During this pericd
containers of waste salt wouid be stored in thimbles in a canal for heat
dissipation to the canal water. The chosen storage pericd is a more or
less arbitrary figure and might be shortened appreciabtly by appropriate
waste carrier design. After 1000 days cooling, it should be possible
to transport the waste containers without auxiliary cocling facilities

on the carrier.

At this point it should be noted that all carrier salt plus thorium
is discarded as waste. This is necessary since there is no developed
process for removing fission products from the mixture. Lithium is the
most valuable component since it is 99.995 at. % Li-T; however, the
larger amount of thorium present makes it almost as important in terms

of teotal caost.

3.4 NaF Absorption

After leaving the fluorinator, UF6 and the accompanying volatile
Tission products pass into a NaF abscorption system. This system basical-
ly consists of two distincet zones defined according to function: Zone 1
is a high temperature (~ 400°C) zone (the so-called CRP or Complexible
Radiocactive Products trap) for removal by complexing or filtration of
Tission or corrosion product fluorides and entrained salt. Zone 2 is
the UF6 absorpticn~desorption zone operated at lOOOC for absorption
and at 400°C for desorption. Chromium is quite effectively removed in

the CRP trap, ruthenium is distributed throughout the Nal beds with some
passing into the F2 disposal system, and zirconium, niobium, cesium,
strontium and rare earths are quite effectively removed in the CRP trap

and the NaF absorption-desorption system.

Uranium hexafluoride absorbs on sodium fluoride by formation of
the UF6'5 NeF complex. However, the complex does not form at temperatures
as high as hOOOC, SO UF6 passes through the CRP trap and is caught in
the 100°C absorption zone. At the completion of the bateh fluorination,
the 100°C absorption zone is heated to 400°C at which temperature UF6
is desorbed and moved from the bed with fluorine carrier gas. Fission
product fluorides are not so easily desorbed and remain on the bed.
Decontamination factors of the order of 1000 are observed in the

absorption-desorption step.

The CRP trap and absorption zone may be integrated into a single
unit for convenience of disposing of spent NaF by discharge into the
fluorinator and then to waste storage. This method of disposing of NaF
has been employed in pilot plant operation where there is no protactinium
in the salt. For these plants in which protactinium recovery is necessary
it may not be pracfical to use this design. Instead it may be necessary

to discharge NaF into the waste salt after the second flucrination.

The design capacity of NaF for UF6 is 21 kg UF6 per cubic foot of
NaeF. For large batch fluorinations, the CRP trap and UF6 absorber

secztions may for convenience be separated.

The second fiuorinatior after Pa-233 decay storage is not followed
by NaF absorption (see Figs. 3.1 and 3.2) for two reasons. TFirst, at
this pcint there are no volatile fission product flucrides to contaminate
the product; second, the quantifty of UF6 is small and can be caught in a

cold trap.

5.5 Cold Trap

During the desorption cycle UF6 is moved from the absorber in a
stream of fluorine intc a =old trap maintained at about -50°C. Uranium
hexafluoride desublimes and is ccllected; fluorine is recovered for

reuse or discarded. A convenient means of disposing of fluorine is by
17

reaction with charcoal. When a batch has been collected on the cold
trap, temperature and pressure are raised to slightly above triple

point conditions and UF6 is drained into a ccllection cylinder.

3.6 Reduction and Fuel Make-up

The fuel cycie is completed by reducing UF6 1e) UF& and reconsti-
tuting the tetrafluoride into molten salt reactor fuel., The hexafluoride
is evaporated from the collection cylinder into a Héan flame in ths

presence of excess hydrogen where reduction occurs.
= T 2 A
UF6 + H2 UF4 + 2HF
By-product hydrogen fluoride may be recovered or sbsorbed in a caustic

solution,

Green salt (UFA) falls directly into a dissolver containing
molten LiF-BeFE—ThFuuUFh make-up salt., Before entering the dissolver,
make-up salt is given a pretreatment H2~HF sparge lasting about four days
as a purification measure to remove oxides. Oxides are detrimental to
molten fiuoride fuel stablility in that‘they causc precipitation of
uranium oxide.

After recycled UFH has dissclved, the fuel mixture is fed directly

to the reactor fuel system.

4.0 PROCESSING PLANT DESIGN

4.1 Decay Heat Removal

A major problem in the design of all process vessels which contain
short-cooled, highly irradiated fuel is that 6f heat removal. Heat
densities are so high that large cooling areas have to be designed into
relatively-small volumes. In the case of the molten salt system the
temperature of the heat source is considerablj greater than that of a
conventional heat sink such as cooling water, a fact which introduces
design problems in thermal stress and meximum allowable heat transfer
rates. An alternate cooling system that can be considered is an
intermediate heat fransfer medium éapable of convenient use up to molten

fluoride salt temperatures, thereby considerably lessening the proklems
18

mentioned above. Such a cooling medium could be molten NaK alloy,
sodium or barren salt. Since a considerable quantity of heat is
associated with the decaying fuel (Note Tebles 4.1 and 4.2), it is
pertinent to consider whether or ndt the heat should be rejected or
recovered. The large plant has an average heat release rate of about
3,6 Mwt; the small plant, 1.8 Mwt. These rates represent 0.1l% and
0.07%, respectively, of the nominal 2500 Mwt power station output.

The choice of the cooling system depends upon the decision to
reject or recover heat, and, if recovered, to what ultimate use will
the energy be put. A logical choice would be to use the heat in the
reheat or superheat cycles in the power station or, perhaps,; as preheat
for boiler feed water. In the first instance a high temperature coolant
such as NaK would be required to transport the heat at an elevated
temperature level. For heating feed water either cooling water or
liquid metal transport of the heat should be satisfactory. In this
design it was decided that all decay heat would be rejected and that
cooling water would be used for transport around all vessels except the
fluorinators which would be air cooled. It did not appear to be economic
to design a liquid metal cooling and heat recovery system into the
chemical plant - reactor plant complex in the case of either of the two
plants in this study. Furthermore, this study indicates that a process-
ing rate of 12 ft5/day is unecononic for a power station as small as
2500 Mwt; a chemical plant of this size would be built only in conjunc-
tion with a much larger power-producing complex - perhaps 5 to 10O
times as large. In such a multi-megawatt system, it is reasonable to

think of this waste heat being recovered in one of the reactor stations.

The complete cooling system for decay heat removal from both
plants is shown schematically in Fig. 4#.1. For the most part heat is
transferred across an air gap,for secondary containment of either leaking
salt or water, into cooling water surrounding the secondary vessel or
thimble. The principal heat transfer mechanism is radiation; convection
accounts for perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the transfer. The flucrinators
are cooled by air circulating through the cell. Only in the case of the

initial catch tanks in prefluorination storage is it necessary to use a

different design for removing heat. For these tanks a triple-walled
bayonet arrangement is used to vaporize water in a large number of

these bayonets immersed in the salt.

L.2 Equipment Design

Inasmuch as possible process equipment for this design study was
patterned after previously designed and tested equipment for the ORNL
volatility pilot plant as described by Milford and co~workers6 and Carr
and co-workers,5 In other instances, equipment and design experience
at ORGDP and ¥Y-12 were clcsely followed. Extrapolations in sizes were
made in some cases for the large plant; however, it is believed that

the limits of current technology aave nct been exceeded.

Pertinent data on process equipment for both fluoride volatility
plants are given in the Appendix on the equipment flowsheets, drawings

E-46081 and E-46059.

Pref'luorination Storage Tanks. Seven of these tanks are required

 

for the 12 ftB/day plant and two for the 1.2 fta/day plant. Because of
the large amount of fission product decay heat in “green" fuel which is
only a few minutes old, these vessels are in effect heat exchangers.
The proposed d.esign3 for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment drain tanks
has been adopted for the tanks which receive salt directly from the
reactor. The MSRE design, shown in Fig., 4.2, was suitable in a scaled-
down version for the 1.2 ft‘.i/day plant, but further modification was
necessary for the 12 ftB/day plant as shown in Fig. 4.3 because of the
exceptionally high heat release per unit volume of salt. Heat is
dissipated by boiling water in the interior annuli of the bayonets
which penetrate the vessel heads. The outer annulus of each bayonet
contains an inert gas which is monitored for leak detection. Details
of the bayonets are shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. The bayonet in Fig, L.k
corresponds to the vessel design of Fig. 4.2; the design of Fig. 4.5
corresponds to the vessel of Fig, 4.3. The 2 1/2 in. NPS, sch 10,
sleeve surrounding each bayonet.in Fig. 4.5 is required to maintain a

sufficiently thin salt layer around each bayonet.

Fig. 4.5 Typical Cooling Bayonet 12 ft3/day Plant.
29

The 1.2 ftB/day plant contains two of the MSRE type tanks in the
prefluorination storage system. The two tanks are used alternately.
The 12 fti/day plant contains two bayonet-filled tanks of %0 ft5 capacity
each and five other tanks of 60 ft5 capacity each, The five tanks are
cooled by radiation and convection to water~jacketed thimbles as shown in
Fig. 4.1. Four of the group of five tanks are for fission product decay
storage and the fifth is a feed tank for the fluorinator. In cperation,
fuel is held for five days in the two 5O-ft5 tanks and then transferred

to one of the other storage tanks for the remaining 20 days storage.

A prief description of the tanks required for prefluorination

storage is given in Table 4.3 for both the 1.2 and 12 ftﬁfday plants,

lower assembly is enclosed in an electrically heated furnace, and the
upper assembly is heated with electric strip heaters. Similar designs
were used for these two studies; the large plant fluorinated 6-ft5

bateches, the small plant flucrinated 3,6-ft3 batches.,

The principal design criterion for the fluorinator is that the
vessel be able to dissipate fission product decay heat and heat of
reaction by radiatiorn and convection to the cell environment. Whereas,
the vessel might be constructed like the prefluorination decay tanks
with a large heat transfer capacit&g it is undesirable to do so because
of the high corrosion rate during fluorination. It is advisable tp
construct the vessel as simply and cheaply as pcssible since it must
be rather frequently replaced. The vessel is made with thick, l/2~inch,
walls with a corrosion rate allowance of one mil per hour of fluorination

time.

The preferred materials of construction for the fluorinator are

either INOR-8 or Alloy 79-% (79% Ni, 4% Mc, 17% Fe). L-nickel has been
used for fluorinator construction, but this material is quite susceptible

to intergranular attack.

CRP Trap and Absorbers. The CRP (Epmplexible radioactive Eyo&ucts)

trap6 may he an integral part of the NaF absorber or the two units might

 

be separated. In either case, operation of the units is a batch process,
and the choice of an integral or separate installation depends upon the
physical size of the units. In this case the 1.2 ftE/day plant could
employ the integral unit; the 12 ftE/day plant required separate units.
The CRP trap and absorber are filled with sodium fluoride pellets having
a bulk specific gravity of C.9. The design absorption capacity of NaF is
21 kg UF6/ft5 NaF.

The movable-bed absorber6 (Fig. 4.7) has been designed for the small
plant to handle the quantity of UF6 from bateh fluorinations every three
days. The bed operates semicontinuously by receiving fresh NaF pellets at
the top and discharging fission-product saturated pellets at the bottom.
It may not be feasible to discharge pellets into the fluorinator as shown

in Fig. 4.7 in these plants because of contamination of Pa-233 still in
32

the waste salt. Important features of the unit are four separate
electrically heated zones and an internal pipe for air cooling and

thermocouples.

The stationary-bed sbsorber (Fig. 4.8) as used in the 12 ft5/day
plant contains just over one cubic foot of NaF; six absorbers are
required for the 42.6 kg UF6/day rate. Each absorber is mounted in a
lightweight, low-heat capacity electric furnace which is hinged for easy
removal; the furnace permits operation between sorption (100°C) and
desorption (MOOOC) temperatures. A 2.5-in. outside diameter tube extends
down the center of the bed for admission of cooling aif; the tube also
contains electric heaters. An interior cylindrical baffle causes gases

to take U-shaped path through the bed.

The governing design criteria for an absorber are the rate at
which the bed can be temperature cycled and the bed thickness. The
granular bed is a rather effective insulator and has to be made in thin
sections to facilitate heating and cooling. Each absorber therefore has
a large L/D ratio. When the bved becomes saturated with fission products,
the absorber is removed, emptied and recharged remotely on a L4-5 day

cyecle.

Cold Traps. Cold traps for desublimaticn of UF6 being desorbed
from the NaF beds are similar to those used in the ORNL volatility
pilot plant. Two ftraps are mounted in series: The first, or primary
trap, is operated at about -40°C; the second trap is a back-up trap
operated a% about -60°C to catch any product that might have passed
through the primary *rap. The two traps are shown in Figs. 4.9 and k.10,
These two traps are identical to the ones required for the 1.2 ftj/day
plant; the larger plant requires a longer primary frap, but the second

trap is the same as for the small plant.

The principal factor in design is the heat transfer rate. Adequate
surface for UF6 collection must also be provided, Also the unit should
have a low heat capacity to expedite temperature cycling between batch-
wise zollections. During defrosting the cold traps are heated to about
90°C at a pressure of around 46 psia to allow melted UF, to drain to

cellecticn cylinders.

Cold Trap.
37

The rigorous design of a cold trap to prevent dusting or fogging
of UF6 is difficult. However, considerasble design and operating experi~

7

ence in both fields has been gained at ORGDP. The design shown in
Fig. 4.9 was developed at ORGDP while that shown in Fig. 4.10 is an

ORNL adaptation of ORGDP developments.

Reduction Reactor. The UFé -—>-UF.LL reduction reactor for these plants

 

is patterned after the one described by Mi,nlr'rr:a.y,:“'LL The reactor is a L-in.
diameter by 10-ft high coluwmm having a capacity of 10-15 kg UFé/hr, Since
even such & small reactor has a much greater capacity than required by
either of these plants, the operation is batchwise, Uranium hexafluoride
and fluorine are contacted with excess hydrogen in a nozzle at the top

of the reactor. The hexafluoride is reduced to the tetrafluoride in

the H2-F2 flame and is collected in a tank of molten carrier salt at the
bottom of the column. Gaseous reaction products leave the reactor through

a filter.

Fuel Mske-up. Fuel make-up vessels are nothing more than heated,
insulated vessels located partly in the radioactive processing area and
partly in a cold make-up area. The cold make-up tanks are provided with
lines for admission and removal of sparge gases, H2 + HF, needed in the
purification procedure. Purification requires gas sparging for four

days; the tanks are designed to operate on a five-day cycle.

Pa-233 Decay Storage System. The design of & system for holding the
waste stream for Pa-233 decay resolves into providing adequate heat dis-
sipation from the several tanks. Batches have to be kept separated be-

cause of the fixed decay storage requirement.

In the 12 £t°/day plent, storage is carried out in 60-£t° batches
equivalent to the quantity withdrawn every five days from the reactor.
Fission product decay heat is removed by allowing the vessel to radiate
to a water-jacketed thimble which surrounds the side and bottom of the
tank. There are 36 tanks in the array; each tank has a nominal capacity
of 60 ft3. Dimensicns are 4.5 £t diameter by 4.5 £t high. The jacketed
thimble is about one foot larger in inside diameter than the storage tank.
38

The storage problem in the 1.2 ftB/day plant is similar to that of
the larger plant, Heat is dissipated by radiation and convection from
the vessel surface to a water-jacketed thimble. Twenty-four tanks are
5

needed, each having a nominal capacity of 7.2 ft7 and nominal dimensions
of 1.66 ft diameter by 3.32 ft high. The jacketed thimble is about one

foot larger in inside diameter than the storage tank.

Interim Waste Storage Tanks. Interim waste storage tanks are sealed
cylindrical containers made of stainless steel which can be used for
permenent waste storage after the interim period. The tanks for the small
plant are 16 in. diameter by 7 ft long and for the large plant, 2-ft
diameter by 7.5 ft long.

Thimbles in which the waste tanks rest while in the storage canal
are made of stainless steel. Each plant has 15-ft long thimbles, but
those in the small plant are 2-ft diameter while those in the large plant

are 2.75-ft diameter.

Freeze Valves. Conventional valves cannot be used on molten salt
process lines. Instead, closures in lines are made by freezing a plug
in the line using a Jjet of cooling air blowing across the area to be
frozen. Conveniently located electric heaters are then used to thaw
the line when flow is desired. A photograph of a proposed freeze valve

installation for the MSRE is presented in Fig. W.1l.

Line Heating. Whenever practical autoresistance heating will be

used,

Samplers. A rather complicated mechanism6 is required to remove
analytical samples from a molten salt system as shown in Fig. 4.12. The
pictured apparatus is being tested for use in the MSRE at ORNL. Essential
features of the sampler are the hoist and capsule for removing the sample
from the vessel; a lead shielded cubicle with manipulator, heating elements
and service piping; and a transport cask for removing the sample from the
process area., The sampling cubicle is mounted on the cell biological

shield in an accessible area.

Refrigeration. Low-temperature refrigeration is needed for the cold

traps. One trap operates at -40°c and a second operates at -7500.

4.3 Shielding Calculations

Shielding calculations were madé to compute biological shield re-
guirements for processing areas. It was reccgnized that the extremely
radicactive "green” fuel only a few minutes out of the reactor would re-
guire thick shielding, significantly affecting building size and cost.
The calculations were mede using a program @ for the IBM 7090 computer;
the program is able tc treat cylindrical, volumetric sources which are
applicable in these cases., The code emplcys such parameters as source
strength, source geometry and dimensions, vessel material and location
with respect to top and side shield to calculate either shield thickress

or dose rate, Self-sbsorption by the source is alsc taken intc account.
Shield material was ordinary concrete.

Source Strength. The shielding program was written more specifi-

 

cally for a solid-fueled reactor than for a circulating fuel reactor; and
minor modifications had o be made in calculating the source strength.

The activity of U-235 fission products as a function of irradiation time
and cooling time has been reported by Blomeke and Todd9 for solid fuel
normalized to one atom of original fissile feed. This implies a knowvledge
of fuel burn-up, a quantity that is not so well defined for a circulating
fael. For these calceulations the fraction burn-up was determined using
terms defined in Fig. 4.13

Buri =

BU = Recycle + PFeed ’

where quantities in the fraction are expressed in consistent uaits such
as kg/day1 Feed includes both make-up fissile material and that part of
fertile material that is converted to fissile material. The number of
original atoms of fissile material present was then calculated from equl-
librium reactor concentraiions.

Equilibrium concentraticn U-233 -+ U-235

Original concentration U present = T,

The data of Blomeke ard Todd were then used with this calculated original

concentration to obtain source streangths in terms of disintegrations/sec.
Lo

It was assumed that the fuel had been irradiated for an infinite time at

& thermal ‘neutron flux of 1007 neutrons/cm2 sec.

The fuel in this system is predominately U~233%. However the data
of Blomeke and Todd for U-235 fission products were used because no com-

parable data for U-233 were available.

Geometry. In all calculations shielding requirements were determined
for top and side shields as shown in Fig. 4.14 using the criterion of 0.25
mrad/hr dose rate at the shield's external surface. When several process
vessels were aligned along a wall as shown in Fig. 4.14b, the dose rate
vas computed for several shield thicknesses, t,, ti; ti, -==, taking into
account contributions from adjacent tanks. The data were plotted to de-
termine the required shield thickness for a 0.25 mrad/hr dose rate. Compu-
tations were made for arrays of 3 and 5 tanks, and it was observed that
the dose contribution from the fourth and fifth tanks (extreme end tanks)
could be ignored. |

Summary of Shielding Requirements. Shielding requirements for
process, storage and meintenance areas in the two plants are given in

4.k Process Equipment Layout

Process equipment has been laid out in areas according to the major
process operations: prefluorination storage, first fluorination, Pa-233
decay storage, second fluorination, NaF absorption, cold traps and product
collection, UF6—+UF4 reduction, and interim waste storage. Equipment is
grouped in cells according to activity level and in an arrengement that
minimizes distances for molten salt transfer between vessels. Filve trans-
fers of molten salt are required in the processing sequence for the
1.2 ft3/day plant., First, the irradiated fuel is transferrgd from the
reactor to prefluorination storage; second, to the first flﬁorination;
third, to Pa-255 decay storage; fourth, to the second fluorination;, and
fifth, to waste storage. The operational sequence in the 12 ftB/day plant
is the same with an additional transfer in prefluorination storage brought

about by economic heat remcval considerations.

Interim waste storage vessels can most conveniently be stored in an
arca immediately adjacent to but not directly a part of the principal
processing area., A rather large canal is required to contain the large
number of waste tanks. After approximately 1000 days residence; the

waste tanks are transferred to permanent storage.

A very important consideration in equipment layout inside the cells
is the remote maintenance aspect which has beenrn assumed for these proces=-
sing operations. Vessels must be arranged so that all proéess and service
~onnections can be remotely broken and remade and all equipment must be
accessible from above. Over-all building space is often dictated by
remote maintenance considerations rather than by actual vessel size. It
should be pointed out that there has been no actual experience in remote
maintenance of a molten salt fluoride volatility plant and that the
necessary space requirements for such a plant may not have been fully
recognized in this study. Considerable development of both equipment and

operating technique will be required to furnish adequate design information.

4.5 Plant Layout
In order to establish uniformity in cost estimation of nuclear power

plants, the Atomic Energy Commission ™ has specified sertain ground rules
b7

covering site location, topography, meteorology, climatology, geology,
availability of labor, accounting procedures, fixed charge rates, etc.
These recommendations were followed in this study. A concurrent cost
evaluation for a molten salt reactor plant by ORNL and Sargent and Lundy
Engineersl2 used the same basic ground rules making the two plant evalu-

gtions congruent.

Site Location. The hypothetical site location is 35 miles north of
Middletown, a city of 250,000 population. The plant is located on the North
River, a stream that is navigable to boats having up to 6 £t draft. There

is convenient highway and railroad access,

The plant is located on level terrain in a grass-covered field. The

earth overburden is 8 ft deep; below this depth is bedrock.

Qver-all Plant Layout. A remote maintenance chemical plant is most

 

conveniently laid out in a canyon-type arrangement, which is a long, heavily
shielded series of in-line cells serviced by an over-head crane. The depth
of the canyon is determined by location and size of installed equipment;

the width is determined by vessel size and span limitations for the crane.
The over=-all building length is more or less determined by the length of

the canyon, Offices, control room, laboratories, sample gallery, ware-
house, shop and other service areas are placed along a face of the canyon

in a manner that is consistent with good design and functional facility.

In this study advantage was taken of a design study and operating
experience with a remotely maintained radioactive chemical plant by
Farrowl to obtain over-all plant arrangements shown on drawings E-h6059,
E-U6067, E-46079, E-L6068, E-46069, E-L6081, and E-46080 in the Appendix.

Processing Area. Processing cells are located in the central section
of the canyon and are the most heavily shielded parts of the plant. 1In
the 12 ft3/day plant, four cells are employed; in the 1.2 ft3/day plant,

three cells are used, Because of the lower total activity and fewer

 

process vessels in the small plant, one of the shielding partitions

could be eliminated.

Prefluorination storage and first fluorination vessels are located

near the center of the canyon and convenient to the reactor area.
L8

Immediately adjoining (in the same cell for the small plant) is the cell
containing the second fluorination and absorption equipment. This arrange-
ment permits carrying out the most radioactive operations in a compact lay-

out minimizing the amount of thick (7.5 ft) shielding.

The remaining process aresa contains product collection and reduction
equipment for carrying cut the UF6 d'UFh reaction. Althcugh the product
at this point has been decontaminated by a facter of 10" c¢r greater, shield-
ing is required to attenuate the gamma activity of U-237. Four feet of
ordinary concrete suffices to shield this ares. This cell also contains
the dissclver for blending recovered fuel with make-up fuel introduced

from the outside, Fuel is recycled to the reactor from this tank.

Pa-233 Decay Storage. The largest process area of the canyon is

 

occupied by "dead" storage to segregate batches of waste salt while al-
lowing Pa-233 to decay. For convenience the area is located adjacent to
the first fluorinator. An area 27 ft wide by 92 £t long was provided for
the large plant and one 23 £t wide by T4 £+ long for the small plant.

Waste Storage. Wasie sthorage need not be located in the process

canyon because there is negligible fissile material in the waste and no
further process coperatlons are performed on the waste, Facilities are
previded in a canal adjcining the canyon *o¢ store waste containers until
eash can te *transported to permanent storage al some remcte location.
The ares is rectangular with the width being the deperndent dimension.
Since a crane mish be provided Lo service the area;, the width is governed
hy crane span and cost considerations. In these plants over-all canal
dimensions are 48 f+ wide bty 181.5 £t leong and 37 £t wide by 56 £ long
fcr the large and small plants, respectively. Each canal contains water
e a depth of 16.5 ft.

Waste containers are transported from inside the canyon to the waste

Lorage area via a cart on a track which runs fthrough the side shield. A

Crane Maintenance Area. Since the cverhead c¢rane is the principal

 

tocl for carrying coubt all mainterance operaticns In the canyon, facilities

are necessary C keep i3 in good operating condition. An area at one end
of the canyon is set aside for crane maintenance; this area is equipped
with a small crane to service the larger crane. Decontamination pro-

visions are made for this area to allow persomnnel access.,

Contaminated Equipmernt Storage. A relatively small cell is provided
in the canyon for storage of contaminated eguipment during the interim
vetween removal from sexvice and permanent disposition. For example, it
might be necessary 4o hold equipment for fission product decay before re-
noval from the canyon.

-

Decontamination Call., The use of this cell is for decontaminating

 

equipment so it can be packaged and removed from the canyon. The cell is
equipped with sprays azd located near the source of decomtaminating chem
icals.,

Canyon Shop. This cell is a limited perscnnel access area for per-
forming maintenance cn contaminated equipment. Before entering the shop,
vessels and other eguipment would have been decontaminated sufficiently

for contreolled contact work bub not sufficlently for removal to "ecold" shop.

Railroad Dock. A raiircad dock is provided at one end of the canyon

Hy

or recelving into or removing from the canyon vessels and other equipment.
The dock is in a nonradicactive area but can be served by the large bridge
crane used over the caryon. Rolleup steel dcors separate the dock and

crane bay over the process cells.

Control Room. The control room is located adjacent to the biclogical
shield at cell top level. The room extends along the shield face directly
cprosite the cells iz which the principal process operations of fluorina-
ticn, abscrption, product collection and reduction are carried out as well
as salt transfers from one ares to another. From this area all process
operations can be controlled and performed. Remote maintenance is also

carried out from the control room with the aid of television.

Sample Gallery. This space contains the heavily shielded sampling
cubicles (see Fig. 4.i2) and transport equipment. The gallery is located
over the control room ¢n the shield face near the fluorination and re-
duction cells. It is anticipated that process control and accountability

can be accomplished by sampling the fiuorinators and product dissolver.
50

Laboratories. Adequate analytical facilities are provided in the
chemical plant to process all samples from the reactor plant as well as
from the chemical plant. Analytical caves are prcvided for highly radice
active analyses. The analytical area is a ccntrclled access area separabted

from the nonrestricted areas by an air lcck.

Offices. Office space is provided a* ground level near the cenfer of

the ilding.

Service Areas. The remainder of the building space is cccupied by
service facilities necessary for an integrated chemical plant. These in-
clude mechanical and instrument shops, first aid rocom, lunch room, change
rocm; toilets, warehouse and receiving dock, elevators; cold chemical make-
up space, electrical transformer and switch gear room, refrigeration equip-
ment space, air conditioning equipment space, compressor space and pipe
corridors. Most of these areas are located below grade alcong the face of

the process canyon.

5.0 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE

The capital cost estimate was divided intc three principal categeries:
building costs, process equipment costs, and auxiliary process equipment
and services costs. The building costs included such items as site prepa-
ration, shtructural materials and labcr, permanently installed equipment,
and material and labor for service facilities. Process eguipment costs
wvere calcuiated for *those tanks. vessels, furnaces and similar items whose
primary furcticn is directly coancerned wikth preocess cperaticns. FProcess
service facilities are items such as sampling facilities, process piping
and process instrumentation which are intimately associated with process

cperations .

5.1 Accountirg Procedure
The accounting procedure set forth in the Guide to Nuclear Power Plant

Cost Evaiuationll was used as a gulide in this estimate. This handbook was

 

written as a gulde for ccst estimating reactor plants, and the accounting
weakdown is noh specific for a chemical processing plant., Where necessary
for clarifization and completeness, the accouting procedures of the hand-

Tcck were angmented by established Chemical Technology Division methods.
5.2 Bases for Estimates

Process Equipment. A large number of process vessels and auxiliary
equipment in these plants is similar to equipment previously purchased by
ORNL for the fluoride volatility pilot piant for which cost records wvere
available., Extensive use was made of these records in computing material,
fabrication and over-all eguipment costs. In some cases it was necessary
to extrapolate the data to obtain costs for larger vessels; however, for
some equipment in the small plant, the data were directly applicable.
items that vere estimated in this manner were the fluorinators, furnaces,
NaF absorbers and CRP traps. The cost of the UF6-to—UF4 reduction unit
was based on a unit described by l%fiu.rra},re:’;“l‘L The unit had a larger capacity
than was needed for these plants, but it was assumed that the required unit
would have about the same over=-all cost. Refrigeration equipment and cold
traps were estimated from cost data for ORGDPT and ORNL equipment.

Some items of process equipment were of special design and signifi-
cantly different from any vessels for which cost data were available. The
prefiuorination storage tanks which receive irradiated fuel directly from
the reactor are exampies. The cost of these vessels was calculated fron a
previous cost estimate made by vhe Y-~12 machine shop on a similar vessel
for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. For vessels and tanks of more
conventional and familiar desigrn, the cost was computed from the cost of
material (INCR-8 for most vessels) plus an estimated fabrication charge,
both charges being based on the weight of the vessel. A summary of values
used in estimating process vessels by weight is given below. For the
shells of the prefluorination storage tanks, the high fabrication cost
values shown were obtained by back calculating from a Y-12 shop estimate

for a similar vessel.

Auxiliary process items such as process piping, process electrical
service, instrumentation, sampling connections and their installation were
not considered in sufficient design detail to permit direct estimation. A
value was assigned to these items which was based upon previous experience
in design and cost estimation of radiochemical processing plants., In as=-
signing these values cognizance was taken of the fact that the plant is

remotely maintained.

Building. The building estimate included the cost of land acquisition,
site preparation, concrete, structural steel, painting, heating, ventilation,
air conditioning, elevators, cranes, service piping, laboratory and hot
cell equipment, etc. The individual costs were calculated using current
data for materials and labor, and are based on the drawings shown in the

Appendix.

5.4 Building Capital Cost

Building cost data for the two fluoride volatility plants are given
in Teble 5.2. These costs are divided into five categories: processing
cell, interim waste storage, operations and laboratories, outside utilities
and land improvements. The tabulation presents both material and labor

costs.,
5.5 Total Capital Cost

As mentioned above, process equipment and buildings were the only
items considered in sufficient design detail to permit direct estimation.
The remainder of the capital costs were estimated from previous knowledge
and experience with radiochemical processing plants. The fact that the
plant is remotely meintained was an important factor in estimating process
instrumentation and electrical and sampling connections. These items be-
come considerably more expensive because of counterbalancing, spacing and

accessibility requirements.

Construction overhead fees were taken as 22% of direct materials and
labor for all buildings, installed process equipment, piping, instrumenta-
tion, electrical and other direct charges. This rate is in agreement with
current charges for this type of construction and estimate. Architect
engineering and inspection fees were taken as 15% of all charges including
construction overhead. This fee may be as large as 20% for some designs;
however, for this plant the lower 15% value was used because of considera-

ble repetition in the design of a large number of process vessels.

6.0 OPERATING COST ESTIMATE

Direct operating costs were calculated for both plants to cover man-
power requirements, chemical consumption, utilities, and maintenance ma-
terials, Current data on labor and materials costs were used in making

the estimates.

6.1 Operating Manpower
Operating manpower requirements for the 1.2 and 12 fts/day plants
are estimated in Table 6.1.

6.2 Summary of Direct Operating Costs

Direct operating costs and the bases upon which they were computed
are given in Table 6.2. Labor costs were obtained from Table 6.1 but are
presented in & slightly different manner to exhibit the charges associated
with the major classifications of operations, laboratory, maintenance and
supervision. The largest single direct costs are labor and maintenance
materials. There is no direct way to calculate yearly costs for main-
tenance materials; these charges must be estimated as certain percentages
(%/year) of the corresponding capital investment. The rates that have
been used are average rates which have been observed to apply to a large

number of chemical reprocessing operations.

7.0 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE OF MODIFIED
1.2 FI'3/DAY PIANT

T.1 Modifications

In examining the large amount of process equipment and cell space
required for Pa=-233 decay storage, it becomes guestionable if there is an
economic advantage in recovering the protactinium. Accordingly the 1.2
ft3/day plant was redesigned to remove Pa-233 decay storage and associated
equipment, and relocate the interim waste storage cell area to a more eco-
nomic location, the process building was thus reduced in size. These
changes brought about corresponding savings in process electrical, in-
strumentation and piping charges. In the modified plant the process
operations now consist of seven principal steps:

1. Prefluorination holdup (4.5 days average)

2. Fluorination

3. Absorption -desorption of UF6

L. UFg collection on cold traps

5. Reduction UFB e-UFh

6. Fuel make-up

7

. Waste storage

Eliminated from the operations were Pa-233 decay storage and a second
fluorination as well as two transfers of molten salt.

Only the 1.2 ft3/day plant was considered in making the revised
cost estimate. The initial estimate discussed in Section 5.0 indicated
that the large fluoride volatility plant (12 ft3/day) was not economic
for processing only a 1000 Mwe reactor system, but rather would find its
utility in a large, central processing location. It was beyond the scope
of this study to include cost estimates of centrally located processing
plants.

In making the revised estimate it was not deemed necessary to re-
design the process building. A revised building cost estimate was pre-
pared from marked up drawings showing the areas that would not be needed.
Likewise no new process equipment and layout drawings were prepared for
the revised process equipment estimate. In this regard the drawings in

the Appendix are not representative of the modified plant.
65

(.2 Process Equipment

A study of the modified process indicated that the items listed in
Table 7.1 would not be needed. The savings resulting therefrom were cal-
culated by using the initial process equipment estimate of Table 5.1.
A saving of $183,700 is indicated for the modified systen.

7.3 Waste Storage

In the design bases of Section 2.2 an interim waste storage period
of 1000 days after the second fluorination was chosen. This amounted to
a total holdup of about 1138 days for the processed salt before it was
shipped to permanent waste storage. The 1000-day figure was an arbitrary
choice; the proper interim waste holdup should result from an economic com-
parison of the on-site storage cost versus the permanent site storage cost
using the age of the waste after reactor discharge as the independent var-
iable. For the modified plant study, the data of Perona and Bradshawl5’16
on waste storage costs in salt mines were used to determine the optimum
on-site storage period; on-site storage for 1100 days appeared to give the
most economic total storage cost (Fig. 7.1).

The required mine storage area is a function of the decay heat re-
lease of fission products, and hence is inversely related to the age of
the waste. On the other -hand, on-site building and process equipment
costs increase with on-site waste holdup. For this optimization, building
and equipment costs were estimated for four interim storage times, and the
required cost of salt mine permanent storage space was estimated for the
correspending periods. Salt mine space was charged at a rate of $500,000
per acre for each first year of use. This charge includes development
of the mine site, mining the salt, hot cell facilities on. the surface and
in the mine for handling the waste containers, motorized shielded carrier
and drilling equipment in the mine.

It is estimated that the optimized building cost should be about
$570,500¢ This value includes savings resulting from a relocation of the
wvaste storage area from the position shown on drawing E-46079 in the Ap-
pendix to a new position at the end of the process canyon. In the new
location the waste area can be served by the canyon crane thereby elimi-

nating a second crane for use in the interim waste storage area.

7.4 Process Building

The revised cost estimate for the process building reflecting the
removal of Pa-233 decay storage space is given in Table 7.2. The costs
are classified according to the major divisions of processing cells, in-
terim waste storage, operations and laboratories, outside utilities and
land improvements. These costs reflect an allowance for facilities that

are shared with the resctor station.

7.5 Total Plant Cost

A summary of the total plant costs is given in Table 7.3. There
were insignificant changes in the accounts of land improvements, outside
utilities and sampling connections in the modified plant, so these ac~
counts retain the same charges as in the initial part of this study.
Process piping and process instrumentation charges were appreciably re-
duced reflecting the removal of a number of items of process equipment.

Application of the same construction overhead, architect engineering
and contingency fees as in the initial part of this study obtains a total
plant cost of $10,188,000.

7.6 Economic Advantage

The economic advantage of eliminating Pa-233 decay storasge facilities
from the 1.2 ft3/day fluoride volatility plant can be found by comparing
the savings in capital cost with the value of protactinium that is dis-
carded as waste. Subtracting the total plant cost of Table 7.3 from that
of Table 5.3, there obtains

$12,556,000 - 10,188,000 = $2,368,000,

the estimated savings in capital investment. If this amount is amortized
at 14 .46%/year, which is the charge applied to the capital investment, an

annual gross economic advantage of

$2,368,000 x 0.1446 = $342,400 per year

is realized. There would be some savings on operating cost which should
be added to this number; this saving was not estimated and is probably
not a very significant amount because it does not cost much to operate
a dead storage area.
The process flowsheet (Fig. 3.1) shows that there are 54.6 g Pa-233/day
entering the fluorinator. Valuing this material at $12/g for 292 days op-

eration per year, there obtains

54 .6 x 292 x 12 = $191,300/year

lost by discarding protactinium.
The net economic advantage from eliminating Pa-233 decay storage from
the 1.2 ft3/day fluoride volatility plant is about $l5l,100 per year.
Although it was not considered in this study, there might be some
economic advantage to a nominal increase in prefluorination holdup to
allow more Pa-233 to decay. The value of the increased U-233 yield would
have to be weighed against the additional process equipment and inventory

charges for the longer storage.
