SECTION V. REACTORS FUELED WITH URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE, GASES, OR PLASMAS

Chapter 1.  Introduction

This section covers reactors fueled with uranium hexafluoride, either as
a gas or a liquid, and those fueled with other gases (such as vaporized fis-
sile metals) or with plasmas (ionized gases). Although uranium hexafluoride
is normally a solid or a gas (it sublimes at 56.4°C under atmospheric pressufel)
its use as a liquid by keeping the system under pressure has been proposed.
The liquid phase appears above the triple point of 147.3°F and 22 psia. The
critical point is at PC, 45.5 atm; and TC, 446°F.2 The reactors fueled with

UF, are included in Chapter 2. Reactors fueled with other gases or with

6
plasmas are in Chapter 3; in some of these, uranium hexafluoride is the
original form of the fuel.

The UF6-fue1ed reactors might be considered fairly conventional, in that
the liquid or gaseous fuel is in a reactor system resembling those previously
described for reactors fueled with molten salts or metals. The fuel may
either circulate for cooling or be cooled by another material. In the reactors
fueled with gaseous metals or with plasmas, on the other hand, the gaseous fuel,
at extremely high temperatures, mixes with a gas that is both a rocket propel-
lant and the reactor coolant. Sophisticated means are needed both to contain
and later to separate the two gases. Most of the concepts in this section are
for thermal reactors. Another moderator is therefore needed because with
fluorine alone as a moderator the critical mass would be excessive.

The advantages of UF, as reactor fuels were recognized early in the war-

6
time atomic energy program. It has a low cross section for parasitic neutron

capture. Like other fluid fuels, UF, can be used in simple reactor systems

and can be circulated to give heat tg a boiler or other heat outlet. Fuel
fabrication is not necessary, and both fission products and bred fissile
material can be removed by simple means. The gaseous fuels have the added
advantage that they are not limited by structural properties to any minimum
temperature. There are, however, difficulties with the systems described in
this section. Such problems as possible instability, corrosiveness, and

[isslon-product deposition with UF, and the need for special containment

6
methods for gases and plasmas at extremely high temperatures will be covered

in Chapters 2 and 3. Two difficulties common to both types of gaseous reactors
10

are that gases are poor conductors of heat and extremely large volumes are
needed to obtain a critical mass because of the low density of gases.

An early suggestion for the use of uranium hexafluoride as a reactor fuel
was in the concept by Anderson and Brown in 1942,3 They proposed using liquid
UF6°

thereafter. Concepts have been published intermittently since then, although

Several other concepts were advanced during World War II and shortly

no practical development has occured in the United States. Some of the
suggestions published are too incomplete for data sheets to be made. 1In
Russia, a 1ow;power experimental reactor fueled with gaseous UF6 began opera-
tion in 1957.

The reactors fueled with high-temperature gases, such as the vortex and
the plasma reactors, first received attention shortly atter the war, especially
for rocket propulsion. Several concepts have been published; much of this
work deals with the problem of separating the gaseous fuel and the propellant
gas. Work is continuing in this field, but details of some developments are

not available.5

Chapter 2. Reactors Fueled With Uranium Hexafluoride

Most of the concepts in this chapter are for thermal reactors. Use of
uranium hexafluoride alone is not practical, and a moderator must be used with
it. Gaseous (helium), liquid (heavy water or fluorocarbons), and solid (beryl-
lium or graphite) moderators have been suggested.

The early concepts for UF6 as a fuel employed either liquid or gaseous
forms. Later, use of the gaseous fuel predominated. The advantages of a gas
as fuel have been given in Chapter 1.

Some problems appear to need further investigation: stability of the
compound under irradiation; corrosion of containment materials, especially
under irradiation; settling out in the reactor of solid UF6, fission pfoducts,
or corrosion products; and the use of a moderator for which a reactor of rea-
sonable size is possible: for example, if heavy water were to be used as has
been suggested, a very large amount woﬁld be needed.‘

The only reactor reported to have actually operated with UF6 as fuel was
a Russian reactor that operated at low temperature (90°C) and low power (1.5 kW)¢1
The Russian investigators, Kikoin et al., found that the decomposition of the
UF6 could be hindered by adding chlorine trifluoride. No experience on the
stability under radiation at temperatures usual in power reactors has been
reported.

The corrosivity of UF6 toward metals has been investigated, but apparently
not under conditions of irradiation. Heymann and Kelling2 found that the cor-
rosion rates at 80°C are low for nickel, copper, Monel, aluminum, alloy steels,
and titanium alloys. For use at high temperatures, high-purity nickel and
Monel appear to be best, Langlois3 studied corrosién by UF6 at high tempera-
tures. High-purity nickel has the lowest corrosion rates above 800°C, and
these rates are compatible with industrial uses. Between 550° and 700°C,
however, corrosion of nickel and Monel by penetration along crystalline bound-
aries prohibits the use of these metals in this temperature range. Nickel of
the highest purity, in which impurities responsible for intergranular attack
are eliminated, should have greatly improved corrosion resistance. Dry UF6
is normally contained in nickel or Monel. Lane4 points out that the stability
under irradiation of the protective film on these metals has not been investi-
gated. _ _
In 1947, Hull5 described several concepts and discussed different aspects
of using UF, as fuel. He listed many advantages, most of which have been given

6

here already. Others he noted are: remote operation permits low-decontamination
14

ceparation, with consequent simplified processing; and elimination of cooling
permits a low inventory. He suggested hydrogen fluoride (b.p., 19.4°C),
deuterium fluoride, and fluorocarbons as liquid solvent-moderators for homo-
geneous reactors. Helium or fluorocarbons would be coolants; water or liquid
metals would have to be kept separate from the UF6 because of the vigorous
reactions that would occur on contact between them and the fuel. Graphite

reacts so vigorously with UF, that it also would have to be separated. For

6
containment materials, he suggested beryllium or nickel; aluminum or magnesium
could be used if the problem of attack by UF6 could be solved. Areas in which

he thought investigation was needed are: corrosion of metals by uranluw liesa=-

fluoride and fluorine; decomposition of UF, by fission-product fluorides, witLh

6
or without solvents; and heat transter by radiation and conduclivu through

is formation of gas bubbles

gaseous UF A possible problem with liquid UF

6°
that might cause instability. °

In 1962, Wethington6 proposed that research be carried out on a reactor
fueled with a solution of uranium hexafluoride in a fluorocarbon. He cited
the Russian experience and the work of others to show that although there
would be some decomposition of UF6 under radiation it could be controlled and
it would be no worse than that uf other compounds used in reactor technology.
The fluorocarbons were suggested as promising moderators because published
information indicates that they have good radiation stability. More investi-
gation, however, would be needed on Lﬁe coucept,

As mentioned in Part I, Section I, of this catalog, Kerze has suggested
that CaF2 particles might be fluidized with.a mixture of uranium hexafluoride
and tetrafluoromethane (CF4) to give a gaseous suspension. The feasibility of
such a system would depend upon the mixture having sufficient moderating pro-
perties, -

Another concept with uranium hexafluoride as a gaseous fuel has been dis-
cussed in Part I, Section I. Halik et al. proposed fluidizing Fine particles

of beryllium oxide moderator by the fuel gas.

Reactors Fueled With Liquid Uranium Hexafluoride

In 1942, Anderson and Brown,7’8 of the Metallurgical Laboratory of the
University of Chicago, suggested a reactor fueled with liquid uranium hexa-
fluoride, as well as two variants of the original design. The reactor would
be a breeder for produciﬁg plutonium. 1In the original design, the fuel-
coolant-fertile material is natural or enriched 1iquid>UF6.- The fuel circulates
through tubes in a moderator of graphite or heavy water and goes to an external
15

heat exchanger. The tubes are of uranium lined ﬁith nickel dr other corroéion-
resistant metal of low neutron-absorption cross section. A power of more than
100 MW(t) was expected. In the first variant, the central portion of the
graphite matrix contains uranium rods, which are cooled by helium passing be-
tween the rods. At the periphery of the matrix are aluminum tubes containing

liquid UF,, which passes to an external heat exchanger. Breeding occurs in this

6’
outer region, which also serves as a reflector for the inner section of rods.
In the second variant, there is a central spherical void, filled with heavy

water, in the graphite matrix. The UF, circulates through tubes that are im-

bedded in the graphite and pass througg the heavy water. A power of more than
100 MW(t) was expected.

Two 1943 concepts from the Metallurgical Laboratory, University of Chicago,
are a Liquid Hexafluoride Pile and the Proposed Hanford Circulated-Hexafluoride,
Thermal Pile.9 Both are rated at 390 MW(t). 1In the first, the liquid UF6
circulates through tubes of aluminum in a graphite moderator and out to a heat
exchanger. This concept is a burner. 1In the second concept, the fuel circu-
lates through tubes, immersed in 25 tons of heavy water surrounded by a graphite
reflector, to an external heat exchanger. It is a breeder, with the fuel and
fertile material being natural uranium moderated by heavy water.

In the U233 Hexafluoride Breeder,10 suggested by Metallurgical Laboratory

staff members in 1944, a fluorocarbon is utilized to dissolve U233Fé, and
thorium is the reflector-breeding blanket. The fuel circulates in tubes through
the cylindrical core. The power is 100 to 200 MW(t).

A 1944 concept by Anderson is the Hex P-9 Pile (UF6-D

would require 686 tons of liquid UF6(”Hex"), probably highly enriched for a

2O pile).8’11’12 This

burner and natural uranium for a breeder, with 63 tons of heavy water ("P-9'")
as moderator. The fuel circulates through tubes in the moderator and out the
top to a heat exchanger. Temperature limits to prevent both solidification
and vaporization of the UF, are 75°C minimum and 150°C maximum.

Among the concepts described by Hull in 19475 were two for liquid UF6

fuel. 1In one, the fuel is.liquid UF, dissolved in either a liquid fluorocarbon

6
or deuterium fluoride. The fuel circulates for heat exchange and removal of
fission products. It has thorium tetrafluoride as fertile material. 1In the
second concept, the fertile material, thorium tetrafluoride, is present as a

fine powder within beryllium cylinders in a graphite bed.
16

Reactors Fueled With Gaseous Uranium Hexafluoride

In 1947, Hull5 described the use of gaseous uranium hexafluoride, pointing
out the advantages of the fluid fuel, and he described concépts originated by
staff members of the Clinton Laboratories (now QOak Ridge National Laboratory).
A preliminary study on such piles had been published earlier in the same year

by Hull and Miles.13

In one design, the fuel, U233 or U235 in UF6, is contained in porous
beryllium tubes surrounded by impervious beryllium tubes. The pores are for
trapping fission products. The tubes are within a graphite moderator core that
is either in the form of rods in the center ¢f a triangular lattice ot tuel
tubes or as annular tubes around them. The coolant, helium, circulates through
the spaces in the core and out to a heat exchanger. A blanket of thorium
powder in beryllium tubes within a graphite bed is the fertile material. Bred
fissile material is leached out of the fuel by slowly circulating fluorine
through the bed. The porous design of the fuel tubes, intended to facilitate
trapping of fission products, allows the products to be removed from the UF6
without chemical processing. This design was for a power of 96 MW(t).

In a modification of this design, the fuel circulates slowly through
aluminum tubes outside the reactor. These tubes have large pores that do not
trap the fission products. Thus removal of fission products is continuous,
permitting better neutron cconomy. Bccausc of their low cost, these aluminum
tubes can be discarded instead of being reprocessed, but their use results in
lower power potential. The power is 50 MW(t).

In a high-flux pile, the water coolant flows in an annulus between porous

233 or U235 as

aluminum rods and beryllium cylinders. The rods contain U
gaseous uranium hexafluoride. Water cooling of the rods, according to the
author, gives a high power output--32 MW(t)--but at a temperature too low for
economic value in generation of electrical power. The moderator would be either
water or beryllium. A reflector-blanket, like that in the previous design,
permits breeding.

The originators believed that the uranium bred in the reactor could be
removed fairly simply from the blanket of the finely powdered thorium fluoride
contained in beryllium tubes. A hot mixture of helium and fluorine flowing
through the powder would convert the products to fluorides. If the powder were
fine enough and the temperature high enough, the PaF5 and UF6 could diffuse
through the beryllium, be volatilized at the surface, and be carried away by
circulating gas. The UF, could be separated in a fractionating column con-

tinuously as soon as the proactinium decays to U 33.

Ll
17

Two other concepts described were for reactors in which gaseous UF6'cir-
culates outside the reactor for removal of fission products and, presumably,
for heat exchange. Both would operate at 230°C or higher. This temperature
would avoid the need for excessive pressure. In one desigﬁ, the fuel circu-
lates through holes in a cylinder of beryllium moderator. The authors stated
that fission products would settle out of the gas onto surfaces within the -
reactor, but using the gaseous form of UF6 avoids the problem of gas. bubbles

that would occur with liquid UF In the other design, the reactor is homo-

geneous, with the moderator beigg a gas, helium or carbon tetrafluoride
(tetrafluoromethane). The operating pressure is 100 atm. The authors specify
a spherical reactor with a diameter of 17 meters, but they stated that it was
too large to be considered at that time. Breeding with a blanket would be
possible, but the blanket would have to be extremely large.

A 1947 suggestion by Goodman14 for a reactor fueled with gaseous UF6
included the use of fluorine to stabilize the UF6 and to act as additional
moderator. The fuel either circulates to an external heat exchanger or re-
mains fixed and is cooled by a coolant such as liquid metal passing through
coils.

In 1953 Kerner proposed the use of the direct expansion of UF6 in an
internal-combustion engine, a turbine, or a reciprocator, The gas is
briefly compressed to supercriticality with a piston; it heats up and pushes
back the piston. The gas returns to the core through a heat exchanger and a
pump.

Reactor concepts in which this direct expansion were utilized were ad-
vanced in 1953 by ‘Fortescue]'6 and in 1957 by Clasen..’17 In the 1953 concept,
the moderator is molten beryllium fluoride surrounding fuel tubes in a cylin-
drical nickel calandria. The reactor is under a pressure of 20 atm.. Cadium
absorbers in the heat exchangers were suggested for control of criticality
outside the core. 1In the 1957 concept, the fuel is within a beryllium core;
the turbine also is to be made of beryllium as much as possible. A graphite
reflector surrounds core and turbine. A blanket of U238F6 is suggested if
breeding is desired. A fast reactor is suggested as an alternative, but no
details are given.

235

The expansion of gaseous U ~"F, is the basis for another reactor, for

6
which few details are given, in which a piston compresses the gas fuel in each

end of a cylinder.'8 20 The compression causes criticality, and the gas ex-
pands to drive the piston to the opposite end, where the gas at that end ex-

pands. Thus a reciprocating action of the piston results. Each end of the
18

cylinder is surrounded by a moderator and reflector. Direct conversion of the
piston motion into electrical action by use of electromagnefic induction was
proposed° The application of the concept to locomotives has been suggested, and
in 1955 the USAEC awarded a contract for the study of a nuclear-powered recipro-
cating engine for locomotive propulsion to the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation
and the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad.20 The chief problems visualized were in

startup and in handling UF

power [1.5 kW(t) ] experimental reactor, fueled with gaseous UF6. It went

satisfactorily. There was a pressure drop and a decrease in reactivity at a
higher power level, which was attributed to dissociation of the UF6 under 1r-
radiation. Adding chlorine trifluoride permitted stable operation. The fuel
is highly enriched uranium hexafluoride, the moderator is beryllium, and the
reflector is graphite. The fuel is within channels formed from aluminum tubes,.
Criticality is achieved by increasing the pressure. Control rods are provided,
The authors suggest that improved methods of plutonium breeding might be pos-
sible with the UF6 reactor. Some plutonium fluorides are not volatile, and
plutonium hexafluoride, which has a high vapor pressure, is unstable. Thus
special traps in the fuel-coolant system might be used to collect plutonium
fluorides. ,

A 1958 concept by Baron22 was for a circulating-fuel converter utilizing
slightly enriched uranium in the gaseous fuel as both fuel and fertile material.
The fuel flows by natural circulation through double-wall aluminum tubes set
within graphite blocks in the core; helium, the intermediate coolant, is in the
annulus between the tube walls and in an external heat exchanger to which the
fuel circulates. The fuel leaves the corc at 900°F. To maintain sufficient
fuel circulation, a core height of .25 feet is specified. The power is 35 MW(e).

9
Hammitt,"3

in 1960, described a concept for a fast breeder reactor in which
the UF6 fuel and the sodium coolant flow through parallel tubes made from a
nickel alloy. A blanket of fertile material surrounds the core. The power

given is 300 MW(t).
Status

vThefe appear to have been no sustained developmental programs leading to
reactor experiments for reactors fueled with uranium hexafluoride. The early
interest in uranium hexafluoride as a reactor fuel has resulted in compara-
tively few concepts and, aside from the low-power Russian reactor, apparently
no practical development. Recent concepté have been few. Questions of practi-
cal feéctor operation, such as stability and corrosivity of UF6 under operating

conditions of a power reactor, are not yet clarified.

Chapter 3. -Reactors Fueled With Gases or Plasmas' .

Concepts in this chapter included those in which the fuel is a nonionized
gas or an ionized gas (plasma) at extremely high temperétures. Before oper-
ating conditions are reached, the fuel may be a solid or liquid. A concept
for such reactors was described by Shepherd and Cleaver in 1949.1 The advan-
tage of a gaseous fuel, its capability for attaining'temperatﬁres too high
for liquids or solids, is the basis for the suggested use of most of these
concepts for rocket propulsion. In rocket propulsion, the propellant gas would
act as coolant for the reactor. For interplanetary flights, the nuclear reac-
tion would have to raise the propellanp temperature by regenerative heating to
about 10,000°R. The name 'cavity reactor'" was suggested by Safonov2 for those
reactors in which a core of uniformly distributed gaseous fuel is surrounded
by a moderator-reflector of uniform density. They'were so named because the
flux distributions of dilute fuels approach the flat distribution of an empty

cavity and because of the gaseous fuel is at near-vacuum as it is used in the

system.
General

It -the simplest kind of a cavity reactor, the fuel and coolant are fed
separately into the core région, where they mix intimately, and are expelled
from the core. Separation is done externally. Because cost and weight must
be minimized in a rocket system, the fissionable material must be separated
Ifrom the coolant and conserved; yet, the coolant, which is also the rocket
propellant, must be able to pick up energy efficiently from the fuel for the
system as 4 whole to operaﬁe effectively. .For this reason, several sophisti-
cated methods of achieving fuel-coolant éeparation have been considered. In
some, the two fluids are separated after mixing; in others, they are kept
separated in the core.

Configurations to keép the fuel and coolant separated while they both are
in the core region include (1) coaxial flow, (2) magnetohydrodynamic means,
and (3) magnetic fields. ‘Lhese methods-éf separation are discussed under the
concepts taken up in this chapter, 3

In many conceptg, the fuel is a plasma, which raises probleﬁs of contain-
ment .,

There are two ways of restricting the interaction between high-temperature
gases and adjacent solid materials: (1) limit the interaction in time; or (2)
limit the interaction in space by eliminating all solid méterial in.the vicinity

of the hot gas and replacing it with an electromagnetic fiéld.
38

Nelson3

has suggested that, despite these problems, plasmas should be

considered because of their advantages. A plasma can be confined electro-

magnetically, separating it from the surrounding solid materials with’which

it would otherwise react;

it can be accelerated by electromagnetic means to

greater supersonic velocities than are obtainable with a nonionized gas ac-

celerated by means of fluid jets; and it can be separated from the nonionized

propellant.

The simplicity of the system relies on the fact that the ionized

fuel is confined by a field barrier, whereas the nonionized hydrogen propel-

lant diffuses through the field.

Nelson suggested confining plasma by either a simple magnetic bottle with

mirrors at each end or a homopolar device, which provides more reactor control.

*Fissioning plasma rotates by being electromagnetically pumped by crossed

electric and magnetic fields.

Centrifugal force associated with the rotation

tends to keep the plasma away from regions where leakage would most likely occur.
39

In reactors such as the vortex reactors, in which the propellant and fuel
mix intimately, the cooling mechanism is either regenerative heating or the
direct heating of the gaseous propellant by the slowing down of fission frag-
ments. In systems where the fuel and propellant do not mix, such as in the
magnetic containment of ionized fuel or coaxial flow, heat transfer from the
fuel to the propellant is principally by thermal radiatidn.

In those systems in which the primary energy-transfer mechanism is thermal
radiation, the radiation must be attenuated by the propellant gas before it can
reach the cavity walls. Also, at certain temperatures, the gases become trans-
parent to radiation. Hydrogen gas is transparent between 5000°R and 12,000°R.
Graphite dust can be used to 'seed" hydrogen for radiation absorption but it

sublimes at 6800°R.
Concepts

In Shepherd and Cleaver's 1949 concept for rocket propulsion,1 the fuel
and coolant are fed into a core area formed by the moderator-reflector. Here
they mix and the critical mass is reached. The propellant-coolant must be
heated to 3000-5000°K. The fuel material and moderator material are not speci-
fied, but the original form of fuel might be a powder, a liquid suspension of a
powder, a wire (extruded into the chamber) or a liquid compound of fissile
material. The coolant could be hydrogen, deuterium, helium, ammonia, or steam. -
Control might be possible by varying the amount of fuel fed to core. A specific
power of 100 MW per metric ton was sought. _

In 1955 Safonov2 advanced a design for a cavity reactor, with different

arrangements to fit different purposes. The gaseous fuel, of low density at

233 or U235, as well

the high operating temperature of the reactor, could be U
as plutonium. The fuel is in a region surrounded by a moderator-reflector of
heavy water, beryllium, or graphite. This moderator-reflector region could
contain fertile material for breeding and a thermal-absorbing material for
control. The coolant, an unspecified gas, is pumped around or through the

fuel. An inherent safety factor is stated to be the prompt neutron regenera-
tion time, which is as long or longer than that for solid-fuel thermal reactors.
The high neutron flux produced might make the reactor suitable for engineering
testing. Other modifications are: a gas- or air-cooled power reactor; zir-
conium tubes carrying liquid-metal coolant in the center and fissile material
at or near the outer surfaces; liquid metal to carry the fissile material; or
uranium hexafluoride fuel. The gas- or air-cooled and the UF6-fue1ed reactors
could be used to operate a turbine; the UF6-fue1ed reactor would operate by

direct expansion. In all, the fuel would be gaseous in reactor operation.
40

The direct conversion of mechanical energy produced in a pulsing plasma
to electrical energy is proposed in a 1957 concept by Colgate and Aamodt.4
The gaseous fuel, plutonium or uranium, is partially ionized at the tempera-
ture of operation. A magnetic field compresses the gas at one end of a
cylindrical graphite fuel container, which is blanketed by heavy water (the
coolant-moderator-reflector). The blanket is contained in aluminum or zir-
conium. As the gas is compressed, criticality occurs to release fission
energy, which drives the gas to the other end of the container. Here it is
again compressed and driven back by the fission energy. The oscillation of
the gas between the two ends causes the portion of the gas directly behind
the shock front to become highly ionized. As this plaswa, acting as a con-
ductor, moves through the magnetic field it induces an electrical current in
an external electrical circuit. The power is 500 MW(e).

A high-temperature (15,000°K) reactor with electromagnetic confinement

of fuel was described by Taylor in 1957.,5 The fuel, a plasma of U233, U235

>
or Pu239, is in a core surrounded by the moderator-reflector, heavy water or
beryllium. The coolant-propellant, hydrogen, passes through the core, where
it gains energy, and leaves the reactor. The fuel is retained in the core by
externally applied electromagnetic fields, which do not retain the nonionized
propellant.

A preliminary design for a reactor of high power, called a "fizzler",
was published by Bussard and bLelLauer in 1958,6 Designed to producc 5000 MW(t),
this reactor was intended for rocket propulsion. Fuel (UQJJ, Usz, or Pu239)
and coolant (rocket propellant) mix in a core region formed by the unspecified
moderator-reflector. Here criticality heats the fuel to above its vaporiza-
tion temperature. The authors conclude that at the operaliug pressure con-
sidered reasonable (1000 psi), greatly excessive amounts of fuel would be lost.

Two 1959 concepts by Grey7 were for rocket propulsion; few details were
given. 1In one, the "fizzler"'" reactor, the fuel is mixed in a solid with the
propellant, which is also the moderator. Removal of a portion of a cadmium
control rod causes criticality, which vaporizes the fuel. The other concept
is for a series of subcritical solid-fueled reactors. They are made tempo=-
rarily highly supercritical when propellant gas containing fissile material is
passed through them. The gas increases in temperature as it passes through

the series of reactors until it comes out of the nozzle at a very high tempera-

ture.

Meghreblian described two cavity reactors of similar design that were

intended for rocket propulsion. In both, two fuel zones were used, one of .
41

solid fuel and one of gaseous. 1In one,8’9 a central moderator matrix contains
the gaseous fuel and is surrounded by a solid fuel zone. In the other, . the
solid is in the central portion and the gaseous fuel in the moderator matrix
surrounds it. A reéflector-moderator surrounds the core in both. ' The coolant,
which is the rocket propellant, passes into the core, and picks up heat, first
from the solid-fuel region and then from the gaseous fuel. ©No details of
materials were specified.

The concept for a vortex reactor,l ) 7vproposed by Kerrebrock and
Meghreblian,ll’12 emphasized the separation of fuel and propellant, after
mixing, by the formation of a vortex. The fuel (gaseous uranium, plutonium,
or their compounds, in h&drogen) is contained as a jet-driven vortex in many
long thin tubes imbedded in moderator material (beryllium oxide or graphite).
After the fuel and coolant mix, the mixture spirals into the center of core,
is drawn off axially, and is discharged. Because of the radial pressure
gradient within the vortex, the heavier fuel molecules would be contained in a
steady-state concentration distribution in the vortex, while the lighter pro-
pellant gas would diffuse through it,l6 A core temperature of 10,000°R and a
power of 500 MW(t) were sought. 1In addition to the method described for at-
taining a vortex, magnetic fields, magnetic mirrors, or magnetohydrodynamics
(externally imposed electrical and magnetic fields) might be used.

Certain variables--tube diameter, mass flow rate per unit tube length,
jet injection velocity, and wall pressure--affect vortex strength.1 The
strength increases as tube diameter decreases and as mass flow rate incéreases,
and it increases with subsonic rather than sﬁpersonic injection. Because vor-
tices develop turbulent instabilities, particularly at the periphery, several
configurations designed to produce a laminar flow by stabilizing the shear
boundary layer on a concave wall have been considered. They are: (1) bleed-
off of the boundary layer through a uniformly porous wall, (2) injection of
heavy gas uniformly through a porous wall, (3) wall cooling, and (4) bleeding
ott some of the total flow axially at radial positions between the tube .center
and the wall so that the exit radial flow is held to an allowable rate, based
on diffusion considerations (bled-off flow would be recirculated).15

Three variants have been explored in somewhat more detail.

One variant includes 'a rotating porous wall through which the propellant
is introduced.15 Turbulence is reduced because the boundary layer on the outer

wall is effectively eliminated. However, to produce significant thrust levels,

many small tubes would still be required because mass flow per: unit of vortex
42

tube length remains limited by the diffusion process. There is a severe

mechanical problem in combining high temperature, high speed, and many tubes.
In another variant, excess mass flow, which has been jet-injected into

the system and which causes the vortex instabilities, is bled off and recir-

culated. The heavy mass could be helium + C or Freon-12 (CCL2F2).15

0 8716

The third variant is based on the same principle as the vortex reactor
except that, to reduce turbulence and to dissipate instabilities, several
vortices are generated in a single container in équare array, by means of fluid
injection from tubes located in the container. The injection and exit pattern
is designed so that adjacent vortices roll on one another, producing zero shear
at the interfaces. This eliminates a major sourc¢e of instabllity, turbulence
at the periphery of the vortices that are located in the interior of the matrix.
Also, since wall area per vortex decreases as the number of vortices inéteases,
the wall area per vortex approaches the area of a single injection tube as the
number of vortices becomes infinite. This greatly reduces the momentum removed
from the system by the action of shear forces, which is proportional to the
wall area involved.

In the Coaxial Flow Reactor of Weinstein and Ragsdale,ls’19

239

fully ionized gaseous Pu ", and the hydrogen coolant are fed into the core,

the fuel,

which is surrounded by a moderator of graphite, heavy water, or both. Here

criticality occurs. ‘the fuel is fed into the center of the core, and the

hydrogen enters around the periphery at a flow rate different from that ot the

fuel. Because of the differing axial velocities, the two streams do not mix.
They are exhausted from the core through a nozzle. The average reactor tempera-
ture is. about 10,000°R. - ‘Heat transfer from the fuel at this temperature is
primarily by radiation. The thermal energy must be atlenuated by the propcllant
to avoid overheating the walls (maximum temperature 5000°R). Because hydrogen
is transparent to radiation between 5000° and 12,000°R, ''seeding" with an ab-
sorber is necessary for radiative heat transfer. Solid particles, such as
graphite dust, might be adequate up to the sublimation point of graphite (6800°R).
A recent design by staff members at the Hanford Atomic Products Operation
is for a system to produce electrical power by a magnetohydrodynamic generator
and a secondary heat exchanger.20 Both would derive their power from a reactor
fueled with fissionable gas such as uranium hexafluoride. The gas flows in a
toroidal container at a density below that of criticality, except in the core
region. Here it is compressed to give criticality, and the gaseous fuel is

ionized. The plasma flows through a magnetohydrodynamic channel, whic¢h consists
of rails carrying current, and two large cryogenic magnets, which supply the
cross-current field. The plasma stream provides an emf to generate current
flow between the rails, The gas flows to a turbine and then to a heat ex-
changer to produce steam from the remaining usable heat. After purification,

the gas is returned to the system.
Status

A brief summary of a conference held at the Los Alamos Scientific
Laboratory in April 1964 indicates recent work on some gas- and plasma-
fueled reactors, although few details are given.

Ragsdale reported further work on the coaxial-flow reactor described
earlier in this chapter. Research was reported in heat transfer, hydro-
dynamics, and nucleonics. Larger flow area, plus higher propellant velocity,
is thought to give an economic ratio of propellant to fuel in the exhaust
gas. The ratio would be about 50.

In the "Glo-Plug" reactor, the gaseous fuel is contained within a double-
walled transparent tube. Hydrogen flowing between the walls cools the tube,
Heat transfer is by radiation through the tubes and coolant. The propellant,
seeded with material to make it absorbent, absorbs the radiation. Quartz was-
being considered as material for the tubes. X

Stumpf and Rosenweig, in reporting experiments on vortices, discussed
the possibility of combining vortex containment with other methods. For

example, fuel might be contained in some cells of a matrix of vortices and

propellant could flow through others.

Magnetic field produced by Cu coils located in DZO blanket section compresses

accomplished by having ionized gas do work against the magﬁetic field. The
released fission energy creates a shock wave which drives the gas towards the

of mechanical energy to electrical is the basis for the generation of electri-
