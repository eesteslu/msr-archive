OF ALUMINUM~-MATRIYX NUCLEAR FUEL ELEMENTS

R. E. Thoma, B. J. Sturm, E. H. Guinn

ABSTRACT

The results of a search for molten-salt solvents for use
in fluoride wvolatility processing of aluminum-matrixz fuel ele-
ments are presented. The solubility of aluminum fluoride in
various mixtures of fluorides was determined in order to esti-
mate the feasibility and cost of processing methods. OSufficient
data were accumulated to construct equilibrium phase diagrams
of the solution systems, IiF-NaF-AlFj3, LiF-KF-AlF3, LiF~K3AlFg-
MFo {(where MF, is CaFp, SrFp, or Zans, and XKF-ZrFs~Al1F3. New
and revised phase diagrams were determined for the limiting
binary systems of the alkali fluorides with AlFa by use of a
new visual method for determining the occurrence of liquidus
transitions. This method provided several advantages not
available in classical methods of obtaining liquidus data.

For example, it was observed for the first time that immisci-
ble ligquids are formed at high temperatures in Al¥s-based
systems. The temperatures at which such liguids form are,
however, higher than is feasible for adoption in most current
chemical technologies. Of the various materials evaluated as
solvents for the volatility process, the greatest potential
for application was displayed by the KF-ZrF;-AlF3 system.
High solubility and good dissolution rates are afforded by
the inexpensive solvent salt KzZrFs. At operating tempera-
tures, approximately 600°C, the AlF3 capacity of the solvent
is in excess of 25 mole %.

 

INTRODUCTION

Development of the fluoride volatility process is sought as a useful
and effective alternative to conventional aqueous processing for recovery
of uranium from spent nuclear fuels. The process depends on dissolving
fuel elements in a suitable molten fluoride solvent by passage of HF gas
followed by fluorination of the resulting melt to volatilize uranium as
UFa.l The UFs is purified by selective sorption on solid NaF or other
fluorides. Molten~salt Tluoride wolatility processing of nuclear rfuels
offers advantages not available with other chewmical reprocessing methods:
(1) the process is sjmyle,z requiring only a hydrofluorination step and
a fluorination step instead of the many steps--dejacketing, acid dissolu~
tion, precipitation, filtraﬁion,3m5 gte.~~characteristic of the usual
aqueous procedures; (2) the uranium is recovered as UPFg, the form reguired
for isolope separaticn,e and (3) disposal is made of essentially all fis-
sion products as water-insoluble solids. It is also one of the Tew methods
that can be used Tor processing certain ceramic fuels.{

The process has been previously applied successfully to zirconium-

1,8,9

matrix fuels. Currently, it is considersd for alwminum-matrix fuels

10,11 and because of the need

because of theilr use in numercus reactors
anticipated for processing large quantities of these fuels.

One of the most important aspectis of volatility process development
in adapting the process to a particular kind of fu=l element is the selec-
tion of a suitable molten~salt solvent into which to pass the HF gas during
dissolution. A preliminary swrvey of prospective AlF3 solvents reported
by Boles and Thoma,l2 showed that a Bel;~-LiF solvent provides moderately
good solubility for AlFs;, bul,; because of expense and toxicity, an slter-
native solvent system is vpreferred. They considered KF-Zr¥, solvents to
be of potential use. The preliminary data obtained at that time were too
limited for a critical selection of optimal solvents for use in volatility
processing. Accordingly, a more intensive search for sclvents was dniti-
ated using newer methods which permit rapid accuwmlation of large numbers
of liguid~solid transition data.

Desirabple characteristics of the solvent for the process include the
following:

1. TIow cost.

2. Tigquidus temperatures below 600°C.

3. Substantial solubility of Al¥F3 at 500 to 600°C.

4. Low vapor pressure.

5. Low viscosity.

6

. Noncorrosive with respect to the INOR-8 container.
In reprocessing aluminum-matrix fuel elements, the temperature must
be kept below the melting point of alumimm (600°C)13 to avoid forming
liguid metal, which is corrosive to the container alloy, INOR~-8. The sus-
ceptibility of INOR-8 to corrosion by liguid aluminum is offset by its
excellent structural properties at high temperatures and its resistance
to corrosion by fluorine and HF. It is desirable to prevent the maximum
operating temperature from exceeding a limit of at least 50°C lower than
the melting point of aluminum; consequently, 600°C has been tentatively
chosen as the maximum temperature for the process. The economic feasibil-
ity of the process is highly dependent upon the cost of the solvent.
Solvents in which the saturating concentrations for AlFi3 are as low as
8 mole % may be useful if the solvent costs less than 50 cents a pound.
I, however, higher-priced solvent components are required in order to
obtain the desirable solvent characteristics, the economic feasibility

of the process may then require higher saturating concentrations of AlFj3.

Choice of Constituent Fluorides as AlF3 Solvents

 

The cholce of possible solvent constituents can be rapidly narroved
to one group: cheap fluorides which are stable in the presence of gaseous
HE and fluorine. Cationic constituents should either have only one va-
lence state as the flucride, or both the lower fluoride, existing during
dissolution, and the higher fluoride, formed during fluorination, should
be noncorrosive, possess sufficiently low vapor pressure, and have suit-
able melting characteristics for use in the solvent.

Previous to the ORNL work on the volatility process there was little
published information concerning the attack of aluminum metal by molten
fluorides, and none regarding the relationship of HF or other dissolved
oxidant gases to this attack. It is known that aluminum reacts with molten
alkali metal fluorides and with molten cryolite to form free alkali metal

and the appropriate fluorocaluminate.
KaThFg, forming z Th-Al alloy and a potassium fluorcaluminate. Aluminum
metal reacts with solid CeFs at 1000°C to form cerium metal and AlF3z.
With KaTiFe¢, aluminum reacts to form KpAlFg, free titanium metal, and an
opaque phase believed to be a complex of TiFg.ls Published free-energy

valuest® favor the formation of TiFs3 by the reaction:
Al + Zw, = 3TiFs3 + AlF3 .

The rree~energy values suggest that the alkalil metal {luorides ThFgz, Cels,
AlFa, and TiFz may serve as potential sclvent constituents. Mclien Snka
and NizHF2 both attack aluminum.m&%&il7m19 but have disadvantages which
preclude thelir use as poteptial volatility solvents. The former is very
corrosive to structural metals;zo the latter presents a vapor prcblem

metal fluorcoborates and fluorosilicates to form, respectively, aluminum
boride and silicon or silicides. The use of fluoroborates and fluorosili-
cates in the volatility process presumably should be avoided because
vorides and silicides are s0 inert that they are likely to remain in the
processing solvent in the form of an annoying sludge.

Relatively few Tluorides possess the properties reguired for their
use as major constituents of a solvent. Fluorides of nonmetals, semimetals,
inert gases, and the platinum metals either have too high a vapor pressure
or are too corrosive to be considered. (See Tsble 1 for boiling points.)
These objections apply as well to fluorides of Cu; Mo, Ag, W, Au, Hg, Nb,
Ta, V, Cr, Ma, Co, T1l, Pb, and Sn. Scarcliiy would eliminate consideration
of most rare earths, all transuranium elements, also Sc, Y, Re, Hf, Te,
Fr, Ra, Ac, and Pa. Fluorides of Zn, Ga, In, and Cd do not qualify because
their reduetion by aluminum would form corrosive liguid metal. Uranium
fluoride of natural isotopic camposition is objectionable because its use
would alter the isotoplic composition of the fuel being processed. Thus
the list of possible solvent constituents is therefore narrowed to the

following fluorides:

Li¥ BeFa Al¥3 TiFs FeFo
NaF MgFos LaFs ZxFe NiF'as
KF Cal» Cel's Thi'y

RbF Sr¥2

CsF BaFp

Most of the fluorides in this group are suitable only as minor constitu-~
ents of the solvent for the following reasons:

1. EKbF, CsF, LaF3, and ThF4 are moderately expensive.
n

2. TFeFz and NiFz in high concentrations may present corrosion
problems during fluorination.

3. MgFp, CaFa, SrFa, BaFz, and CeF3 have very high melting
points (see Table 1).

4, TiFs in high concentrations may exert somewhat excessive
vapor pressure.
These compounds were, therefore, considered not as major solvent constit-
uents but merely as possible additives for possibly depressing the liquidus
of a promising solvent. The remaining six compounds--LiF, NaF, KF, BeFp,
AlF3, and ZrFi--were given the principal consideration as solvent compo-

nents.

survey of Potential Solvent Systems

 

Except for BeFp, which is too viscous, none of the promising fluoride
constituents individually has the necessary low melting point (below 600°C)
to be used directly as the solvent (see Table 1). A mumber of binary mix-
tures of these fluorides do, however, form adeguately low melting eutectics
(see Table 2). The only Al¥s binary system which provides sufficiently
low melting mixtures for possible use in the process is the KF-AlF3 sys-
tem; its capacity for additional AlFj3 at the process temperature is,
however, limited to about 5 mole %, too low for process use.

In order to find low-melting solvent systems suitable for the proc-
ess, phase relationships were studied in the ternary systems formed by
dissolving Al¥3 in a molten binary solvent. Little concern was given to
more complex solvent systems because the study of polycomponent systems
delineating the phase reactions occurring as AlF3 dissolves in such sol-
vents iz too inveolved to permit adequate characterization in a reasonable
length of time. In addition, the probability of diagnosing the cause of
off-performance difficulties in engineering tests by identification of
crystallized solids is remote for multicomponent salt systems unless de-
tailed investigation of the phase behavior has been made. Accordingly,
when a fourth component was considered, it was usually only as @& minor
addition to a promising ternary system, e.g., A~B~AlF3, included in oxrder
to lower the liguidus temperatures enough to meet process requirements.

Although the fluoride velatility process is intended for reprocessing
o

fuels conteaining both uranium and alumimen, consideration was given only
to the solubility of the resulting Al¥F3z in evaluating 2 solvent. The
uranium content of these fuels, generally less than 1 at. %, yields too
low a UFg concenvration in the solvent to affect the ligquidus temperature

significsently.

The initial phase studies of the solvent systems were performed

,._J

primarily by classical procedures wiich proved to be generally inadeguate
for systems containing Al¥i., Because AlFz and alkali metal fluoroaluwni-
nates are frequently not microscopically distinguishable from each other,
these systems were not amenable to studies employing the guenching tech-
niqus. Alsc; the thermal changs at the liouidus temperature was often
too small to be jesdily deteected by thermal analysis. Even when a thermal
change was detected,; its interpretation, without visual observaltion or
accompanying quench data, was equivoeal..

Most of these difficultlies were overcome Dy melting the mixtures in
an inert-atmosphere glove box (Figs. 1 and 2) and observing phase changss
through a window. GLigquidus temperaturcs were determined accurately (nsu-
ally * 2°C) by noting the temperature at which the first crystals were
obgerved in a cooling melt. The melts were stivred manually to prevent
supercooling and to ensure uniTormity of composition and temperature.
Usually aboub & mole of sall contalned in a hydrogen~fired; polished nickel
crucible was used for the study. Intense illumination was provided by a
Zirconarce photomicrographic lamp (Fish-Schurman Corporavion, New York).
The lignt Trom this instrument overrides the near infrared hackground
radiation from the melt to temperatures of aboul 1200°9C and thus facili-
tates determination of liguidus under conditions where other methods would
be difficult or impossible. Atmosplicre control was obtalined by evacuating

the glove box to 30 u and refilling with helium purified by passage through

As many as sixteen composibions in & given system can be studied in an

8=nhr period by sequential additions of prewsighed specimens. Since the
melt may be observed as phase changes occur, the apparatus 1s also useful
for obtaining interpretable thermal analysis data. To enswre accuracy,
the temperature recorder was periodically standardized against LiF melt-
ing at 848 * 100.22"24

The precision of temperature measurements obtainable in routine use
of Chromel-Alumel thermocouples is generally believed to be *59C. Occa~
sional calibrations with pure salts have shown that the accuracy of thermal
transition temperatures reported here is within the #*5°C precision limits.
Correspondingly, the accuracy of visual transition data reported here is
within *3°C.

A similar visual procedure called "visual polythermal method"” has

been used by Russian investigators,25

but thelr procedure seems inferior
to that used here in that it apparently does not permit (1) agitation of
the observed melt, (2) addition of salt during the run to alter the com-
position, or (3) use of vacuum to control the atmosphere.

A sharp increase in viscosity 1s often displayed by molbten salts as
they cool to temperatures approaching the liguidus. This effect was noted
in most of the systems discussed in this report and was useful in signal-
ing the onset of crystallization. Such a sharp change in viscosity has
been observed also by Velyukov and Sipriya26 for NaszAlFs and L13A1Fg and
by 8111527 for “nCla, A sharp change in the electrical conductance at
phase~-trnasition temperatures was also noted. Preliminary measurement of
electrical conductance using an ohlmmeter (Model 630, Triplett Electrical
Instrument Company, Bluffton, Ohio) indicated that it may also provide a

procedure useful for studying AlF3 systems.

MATERIALS

Purity of the fluorides used in the phase studies was very important.
The molten~-salt systems were studied primerily by a visual procedure which,
in determination of a liquidus temperature, depended on the appearance of
precipitate, oftten in such a form that 1t clouded the melt. Accordingly,
any impurity which clouded the melt interfered with the study. Because
they reacted to form very sparingly soluble phases, hydroxides and water
vapor proved Lo e especizlly objectionable and in some cases initially
veyy difficult to remove or avold in the preparation of thess [luorides.
Hydroxides and moisture were additionally objectionable because they
attacked the metal comtalner, contaminating the melt with highly colored
nickel ion. Often such melts gave rise to lrreproducible Liquidus Tenper -
atures due, presumably. Lo a progressive increase in oxide concenbration

oxygern content:

AlF3 and ZrFs, as the corrasponding oxides have exbremely

low volatility. ZrFs was obtained with as 1little as

sition at 600°C in a helium stream yielded anhydrous

RESULTS AND DISCUGSION

In the search for high~capacity solvent systems for use in the fluo-
ride volatility process, equilibrium solubility data for aluminum fluoride
in seven fluoride systems were obtained. The systems examined included
LiF-KF-AlF3, K3AlFe-1iF-CaF,, K3Al1Fg-LiF-SrFy, K3AlFg~LiF-ZnF,, LiF-NaF-
AlF3, NaF-KF-AlFj3, and KF-ZrF4-~AlFs. The phase diagrams constructed fram
the data obtained in these examinations show that only one of these systems,
KF-Zr¥Fas-AlFi;, can be expected to have practical application as a solvent.
New data were obtained for the limiting binary systems LiF-AlF3, NaF-Al¥Fs,
KF-AlF3, and KF-ZrF¥4. New phase diagrams of each of these systems are
shown in Figs. 8 to 11. Experimental data for the systems reported here
were collected simultaneously for several systems, thus making it possible
to curtail the efforts on any one system as the development in another

system showed promise.

AlF3 Melting Point

Previously reported experimental values for the melting point of
Al¥3 range from 98612 to 104000.28 All of our visual observation data
indicate that these values are low and that the melting point is higher
than the reported sublimation temperature, 127000,29 though not as high
(19200C) as was regarded by Steunenberg and ngel.BO Because high liquidus
temperatures and vapdr pressures prevented visual study of mixtures con~
taining over 56 mole % AlFj3, too little data were obtained to permit a
good extrapolation of its melting point. Since AlF3 is of similar struc-
ture to CngBl and of comparable size relationship,32 we surmise that its

equilibrium melting point at 1 atm is close to that for CrFs, 1404°C.

Systems Based on LiF-KI¥

 

Mixtures of the lightest alksli fluorides, ILiF, NeF, and KF, are not
so low melting as those obtainable with EbF or CsF; the cost of these latter
two materials, however, precludes their economic use in process development.
The binary mixture of the cheaper fluorides which affords the lowest~-melting
solvent is the cguimolar LAF-KF eutectic wixvure which melts at 5007°C (sec
Fig. 4). ‘The phase diasranm of the system LAF-XF-AlFa, consbructed on the
basis of the datva shown 1n Table 3, is given in Fig. 5. Ilovariant equilib-
ia are listed in Tsble 4. The diagvan shows clearly that LiF-KF mixtures
cannot provide useful solvents because off the extent to which the primars;
phase fields of the high-melting caonpounds K3Allg and KzLiAl¥e approach the
limiting binary system L[iF-Al¥Fa3. The iternary system 1s canprised of the
subsystems KE-LiF-Kz81Fs, KaAlFe~-11i2AlFg~-1aF, and KaAlF,-TiA1F5.  Both of

Data obtained Por the system are given in Table &.
The System NaF-KF-A1F4

 

Preliminary investigation of the system NaF-KF-AlFj3 made by Barton
et gi.35 indicated that aluminum fluoride solubility was negligible in
NaF-KF mixtures except at temperatures above the NaF-KF eutectic. This
inference was corroborated by additional experiments conducted as part

of the present investigation.

The System KF-ZrFgz-Al1F4

 

Binary systems of the alkali fluorides with Zx¥s; afford low-melting
solvent mixtures for the heavy-metal fluorides UFy; and ThFg and can be
expected to provide useful solvents for AlF3 as well. Othef solvents
would be preferred because of the high cost of ZrF, and because of the
volatility of Zr¥Fgi-rich ligquids at high temperatures. Nevertheless, the
liguidus temperatures at concentrations of 35 to 45 mole % ZrFs; in the
KF-Z2rFs system and the availability of KpZrFe¢ as an inexpensive reagent
suggested the use of the reagent in the preliminary evaluation of the
aluminum solvent systecms.l2 The experimental data obtained in this inves-
tigation are shown in Table 9, The phase diagram of the system is shown
in Fig. 7. Crystallization reactions within the system KF-ZrF4-AlF3 have
been characterized in detail except for those involving AlFj3 and ZrF,.
Both of these coamponents are high melting and volatile. Their phase reac-
tions are extremely difficult to exsmine at high temperatures because of
this volatility end their low heat of fusion, which preclude most dynamic
methods for obtaining phase data. Their crystalliization reactions in the
ternary mixtures suggest that the only interaction cccurring between them
at high temperatures is the formation of a eutectiec. For these reasons,
we have cmitted investigation of the limiting binary system AlF3-ZrF,;. At
600°C, the maximm acceptable temperature for the process, a solvent, KF-
zrFs (63-37 mole %), was found to have 15 mole % AlF3 capacity. Idguidus
temperatures In the binary system KF-ZrFs exclude the use of solvents
richer in X¥F. It can be seen from the phase diagram of the system KF-ZxrFs-
AlF3 (Fig. 7), constructed in this study, that by a single addition of KF
after partial dissolution of the fuel element the solubility of AlF3 is
increased from 15 to 26 mole %.
