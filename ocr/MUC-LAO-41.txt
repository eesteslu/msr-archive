Besides the use of the chain reaction for the production of

ux as high as Hanford which can-be used for experimental
purposess. - While' such-a unit might seem expensive at first (the cost
would be: about $150,000- to. $200,000); itiwould give an important too: 5

‘Therefore, it ‘igsuggested ‘that beryllium or beryllium oxide: or some

‘Thegeneral ‘arrangement of such a pilé would be as indicated

with one using water-ab high' pressure and felt that one could realize a:.

explained that he was suggesting this type-of pile only for its advantage

In answer to the quest:.on,wlr. Morrison expla::.ned that the ‘

the pile he had designed:-had the advantage of not depending upon neutfon’

his favorable:reaction to high. temperature operation and reported that

purpose. This included the solubility of iron in these alloys, wetting
