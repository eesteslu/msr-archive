~ 'COMPATIBILITY OF HASTELLOY N AND CROLOY 9M WITH
- NaBF;-NaF-KBF; (90-4-6 mole %) FLUOROBORATE SALT

J. W. Koger and A. P. Litman
. .ABSTRACT

The compatibility of a relatively impuré (> 3000 _ppm

impurities) fluoroborate selt, NaBF,-NaF-KBF, (90-4-6 mole %) s

with Hastelloy N and Croloy 9M was evaluated in natural cir-
culation loops operating at a maximum temperature of 605°C

- with a temperature difference of 145°C. The Croloy 9M loop
- '(NCL’—J.E.’) was completely plugged -after 1440 hr of operation ..
~and the Hastelloy N lo (NCL-10) was three-quarters plugged

after 8760 hr (one"ygar' ‘of operation. All major alloying

 elements of the container materials mass transferred during

operation as the result of nonselective attack by virtue of .
the initial oxygen and water contamination of the salt. Satu-
ration.concentrations of 700 ppm Fe and 470 ppm Cr were deter-

“mined for the fluoroborate salt at 460°C.. The mechanism of -
corrosion of the system is as follows. Initially, metal fluo-

ride compounds that are soluble in the salt are formed in the
hot leg. The reverse reaction occurs in the cold leg and
causes the metal to deposit and to diffuse into the cold leg.
This contimes until (1) an equilibrium concentration of one
or more metasl fluorides is reached in the salt at the cold-
leg temperature and these compounds start depositing (e.g.,
NCL-10) or, (2) the equilibrium constant of the reaction

deposited (g.g., NCL-lZ)

- changes so much with temperature that the pure metal is

then dissipates the heat to steam. 2 In the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

(MSRE), the nickel-base alloy Hastelloy N has proved to be an effective
container material for the fluorlde salt that contains the fuel and for
the LiF-BeF, diluent.

Many potential fissile® (contalnlng UF, ), fertile® (containing ThF4),
or combination! (containing both UF; and ThF,;) salts proposed for the
MSER have been or are being tested for their compatibility with
Hastelloy N and other container materials. The choice of a salt for
the secondary coolant, however, remains_open. Test programs naveronly
considered coolant salts like NaF-ZrF, and, recently, LiF-BeF.. While
these salts have demonstrated excellent compatibility with Hastelloy N,
there is need for cheaper fluoride mixtures that melt at 1owor tempera-
tures. On the baéis of low cost (approximately 50é/lb) and a relatively
low melting point (about 400°C, necessary for transferring heat to super-
critical steam), fluoroborate salts -especially'NaBF4 — with small
additions of NaF and/or KBF; have recently become of interest as secon-
dary coolants. Little is known, however, about the corrosion behavior
of these salts. _

The space diagram of the ternary NaF-NaEF,-KBF, systém (Fig. 1)
shows that the salt mixture under consideration lies very near the NaBF,
corner and has a melting point close to 390°C. Note that oxygen impu-
rities that form BF30H-compounds significantly lower the melting point
of the mixture below that shown by the diagram. The vapor pressure of
fluoroborate salts, especially NaBF,, is higher than that of other
fluoride salts,’ because in the temperature range of interest the sodium
fluoroborate maintains such an equilibrium with its components that a

significant amount of boron trifluoride gas is present in the system:

NaBF, =NaF + BF;(g) . (1)

‘NaF, and KBF, (90-4-6 mole %) (Table 2) — were loaded into a container
lined with nickel, which was then evacuated and purged several times
with helium.' Then, the materials were melted and heated to 400° C under
" a helium atmosphere. Next, the liquid was sparged with hélium."sinée
this caused a large increase in pressure, the reactor vessel was vented.
Large quantities of BF3, which had caused the increase in pressure, were
" then released. Later steps included sparges with a mixture of hydrogen
fluoride and hydrogen for several days at 550°C to remove oxides and a
sparge with hydrogen to remove structural metal impurities. The salt
was then transferred to a fill tank made of Hastelloy N in preparation
for filling the loop. _

The chemical analysis (Table 3) of the prepared selt disclosed two
important compositional changes germane to this test series:. (1) a
significant loss of BF; during preparation, and (2) a high content of
oxygen and water. Since little was known asbout the corrosivé behavior
of this salt or the effect of impurities and because information on its
compatibility with the container alloys was needed quickly, we decided

to use it as prepared.

' OPERATIONS

The hot portion of each loop was heated by sets of clamshell heaters,
with the input power controlled by silicon controlled rectifiers .(SCR

units) and the temperature éont_rolléd by a Leeds and Ndrthrup Speedomax H

Series 60 type C.A.T. (current proportioning) controller. The loop tem-
peratﬁres were mea'sured by Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples that were
spot welded to the. outside of the tubing, covered by a la.yer of qua.rtz
tape, and then covered W1th stalnless steel shim stock.

- Before each loop was filled with salt, it was degreased with a.cetone

‘and heated to l?O‘?,C ~under v_s_a._c_:gum }:o_ remove any moisture in the system.
 

We checked for leaks with a helium mass spectrometer leak detector while
the interior of the loop was evacuated to < 5 X 1077 torr. All lines
from the fill tank to the loop that were exposed to‘the fluoroborate _ ¥
salt were of the same material as the loop and were cleaned and tested “
in the same manner as the loop. All temporary line connections were
made with stainless steel compression fittings. | |
The loops were filled by heating the loop, the salt pot, and all
connecting lines to a minimum of 530°C and applying helium pressure to
the salt pot to force the salt into the loop. Air was continuously
blown on the freeze valves leading to the dump and flush tanks to pro-
vide a positive salt seal. Tubular electric heaters controlled by vari-
able autotransformers furnished the heat to the cold-leg portions. Once
the loop was filled the heaters were turned off and the insulation was
removed to obtain the proper temperature difference by exposing portlons
of the cold leg to ambient air.
The first charge of salt was dumped after 24 hr in the loops at the
maximum operating temperature with some circulation and little tempera- /
ture gradient. This flush removed surface oxides and other impurities
that could have been left in the loops. The loops were then‘refilled : | ~
with qéw salt and put into operation. A helium cover gas under slight |
positive pressure (about 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the
loops during operation. Each loop was operated at a maximum temperature
of 605°C and with a temperature difference of 145°C. A temperature pro-
file around the loops is shown around the schematic of the loop in Fig. 3.
During circulation each loop contained about 920 g of salt that con-
- tacted 1200 cm® of surface and traveled 254 cm around the loop.
Temperature excursions indicated a flow stoppage in NCL-12
(Croloy 9M) after 1440 hr. Attempts to drain the loop were unsuccess-
ful, and the loop was allowed to cool with the test salt in place. In
- NCL-10 (Hastelloy N),Va significant increase of temperature in the hot

leg accompanied by a simultaneous temperature decrease in the cold leg .
occurred after 8335 hr of operation. A perturbation of this type indi- t
cates a disruption in salt flow and can indicate plugging. This tem- -

perature cycle ceased after 1 hr, and no further incidents occurred Q;J

mich scatter, but we believe that the oxygen content also increased.

. Presumsbly these increases are due not to air inleakage but to other
factors discussed later in this report. |

The crossover line to the cold leg, the cold leg, and the crossover
line to the hot leg all showed slight increases in'wal} thickness due to
deposition of eomplex surface layers (Fig. 6). Chemical analysis of the
layers disclosed that they were primarily'metailic nickel (60 to 90 wt %)
and molybdémum. A small quantity of iron was present 1n.prox1m1ty to the
‘base metal, but chromium was conspicuously absent. o

Metallurgical. — Micrometer measurements of the hot leg of the loop
disclosed 1 to 2 mils of metal loss and slight surface roughening.

Metallographic examination of an area from the hottest section
_(605°C), however, showed a smooth surface with an 6ccasienal penetra-
tion along a grain boundary (Fig. 7). Microprobe traces’ of this hottest
section for all the alloying elements showed no compositional gradients.
The chromium trace for this section is givenrin Fig. 8. These results
indicate a general dissolutive attack in the hot-leg section.

An area at the entry of the cold leg (520°C) showed a duplex surface
structure, and the areas numbered in Fig. 9 were analyzed with the micro-
probe for the various elements (Fig. 10). The outermost layer, aresa 1,
is quite high in nickel ~ up to 87 wt %. We believe this is most likely
a region where nickel deposited during the test. Area 2 is a region con-
taining essentially only'molybdenum and nickel. Close to the original
metal surface there is an increase in nickel, a smaller increase in
molybdenum, and little change in chromium and jron. Note that with an
increase in nickel and molybdenum metal the concentration of chromium
and iron would show a decrease even though there were no chenge in the
actual amounts. '

Figure 11, a photomicrograph of the coldest section NCL-lO (460°C)
shows a spongy deposit on the surface and a loosely adherent corr031on
product beyond this region. At higher magnifications, it was seen that
the tightly attached spongy deposit varied in thickness from O to 6 um

7Da.ta not corrected for absoxptlon, secondary fluorescence or atomic
number effects.

~ much thinner. The spongy layer is high in nickel, with some molybdenum,

and sppears, like the;area 1l of Fig. 9, to have resulted from nickel
deposition (Fig. 12). There was only 63% metal in this spongy layer;

Electron microprobe analyses were made on tubing fromrthe hot- and

with the metallographic results, showed no iron or chromium concentration

systems containing such salts. The use of loops of an old design pre-
vented our having any removeble specimens, but permanent hot-leg specimens
were used in NCL-12.

Our expectation, based on previous experience w:ith fluoride salts,
was that temperature gradienf mass transfer of the least noble constit-
uent (i.e., chromium and iron) would be the limiting factor. But salt
analyses after the test indicated that all the major alloying elements
of the container materials had mass transferred. The nonselective attack
was also: confirmed by metallographic examination and microprobe analysis
of the loop specimens and piping. In view of the mofrement of nickel and
molybdenum, it is obvious that highly oxidizing conditions, due to water
and oxygen in the salt, were present during the operation of the loops.

In analyzing NCL-10 and -12, we reviewed earlier studies® (1late

1950's) to single out the cases of mass transfer of nickel and molybdenum.

‘We. found several instances where this had occurred in salts containing

‘a NaF-LiF-KF salt (11. 5=46. 5-42 mole %) at & maximum temperature of 690°C

w:Lth a temperature dlfference of 90°C. No anslysis for oxygen or water

‘was made before test. Examination after test disclosed green crystals

embedded in the salt. Sa]:.t_analyses showed significent increases in
nickel, iron, molybdenum, and chromium content. X-ray analysis showed

that the green crystals were mixtures of sodium and potassium chromium

fluoride complex compounds and that most of the KF present in the salt

'was actually KF-2H>0.

, Another loop, constructed. of Inconel s (N1—18% Cr—lO% Fe) operated
about one-half Yyear with the seme sa:l.t and at the same temperatures as

above. After test, metallographlc examination showed heavy attack in

contents of the salt were determined; the chromium content had increased
significantly from 60 to 900 ppm. X-ray analysis of the salt disclosed

-pattern of this hydrate suggested that it was not formed when the cold

The literature states that KF easily forms a series of crystal hydrates,

The generation of HF in the system leads to the following reactions with

~the elements of the container material:

~ Note that, in the temperature range of interest, changes in the
standard free energy of formation are not favorsble for all the reactions
as written. waevér, studies on the Fluoride Vblatility Processing
schemel® at ORNL showed that in a Hastelloy N hydrofluorinator containing
fused fluoride salts and HF, chromium and iron were rapidly leached from
the alloy at elevated temperatures (500 to 650°C) evenjwhen the HF activ-
ity was quite low. The main reaction is the oxidation of the metal by
the HF to form fluorides soluble in the melt. It was found that NiF» is
produced by driving the reaction through the continuous removal of hydro-
gen and reaction products, since the free energy of formation (above
490°C) of the nickel fluoride reaction by Eq. (3) is not favorsble. For
the same reason, molybdenum can also be forced to react with HF even
though a positive change in free energy is involved. Evidence of small
but finite dissolution rates of molybdenum metal during hydrofluorination
conditions have been reported.ll,1? i' '

In light of the discussion above, we can now consider why two dif-

ferent types of products (i.e., metal and fluoride compounds)’were mass

transferred in these (NCL-10 and 12) thermal convection loops.

Thermodynamics of System Corrosion

The cycle'of mass transfer initiated by the corrosion of metals by
fluoride salts is kncwndte‘hegin'in;the hotter regions of a loop system
with the formation of'structural metal fluorides that are soluble in the
salt: ' '

M+F =M , (7))
where Mis the attacked metal of the container.

The equilibrium constant for Eq (7) increases with increasing tem-

perature; thus, in a multicomponent alloy the concentration of the
attacked constituent, M, Will_decrease at loop-surfaces at high tempera-
ture (weight loss) and increases at surfaces at lower temperatures (weight
gains). At some intermediate temperature, the initial surface composi~
tion of the structural allow'w1ll be in equllibriumJW1th the fused salt
(no weight change). | |

In the cooler reglons of & closed system, the rate at which the

- metal is depos1ted (steady state condition befbre plugglng) is ‘generally

equal to the rate at which 1t diffuses into the metal — g necessity to

maintain its equilibrium activity on the surface. - Thus the rate of

diffusion of the metal in the alloy in the cooler regions usually con-

ltrols the rate of corros1on in the hot zone. At this stage in the temr

perature-gradient mass-transfer process,'weight gains would be found on
specimens in the cold section.but little if any surface change (depos1ts)
would be seen. This generalization is valid only'when the equilibrium
concentration of a metal fluoride compound in the salt [produced‘by |

. (7)1 does not exceed the saturation concentration of a metal fluoride

rai;compound in the salt at the lcw temperature.

‘Early studies reported.by Grimes13 clearly illustrate these p01nts.'
Table 6 shows the chramxum concentrations for two salts as functions of

'the equilibriumﬂbetween the salts and Inconel or pure chromjum. Note

that when the alkali-metal fluoride salt (NaF-KF-LiF-UF4) is in contact

fluorides (1660 ppm Cr) than it will when it is in contact with pure

chromium at 600°C (1100 ppm Cr). Accordingly, circulation of such a

salt in an Inconel loop would result in the deposition of essentially

pure chromium metal in the cold zone. 1In that case, the total rate of

attack would be controlled simply by diffusion of chromium to the inter-

face betweén metal and salt in the hot zone. We believe that the deposi-

tion of pure iron in NCL-12 (Croloy 9M) occurred this way. This is not

& new phenomenon. Rapid plugging by deposition of metal dendrites occurred

frequently in the late 1950's especially in iron-base alloy loops.l%4,1>
Examination of the data for the other salt shown in Table 6

~ (NaF-ZrF,-UF;) leads to the conclusion that chromium metal would not

plate out in that system and that any product of mass transfer would be

_a fluoride compound. At 600°C this salt in equilibrium with pure chromium

will support a higher concentration of chromium fluorides than it will

~in contact with Inconel at 800°C. For gross deposition of compounds to

-occur, the concentration of the compound at the temperature of interest
(cold zone) must exceed the saturation concentration of the metal fluoride

 corrosion product present in the system.

We believe that the mechanism in NCL-10 (Hastelloy N) is similar to
the one discussed above for the NaF;Zer system and that in time the con-
centratlon of chromium.-or more accurately the concentration of mixed
metal chromium fluoride -1n the fluoroborate salt at 605°C exceeded the
saturation concentration at 460°C and allowed deposition of large quan-
tities of complex compounds. | |

Both NCL-10 and NCL-12 operated with the same salt at the same tem-

perature, yet they'were plugged by different mechanisms at different

rates. A chromium-rich plug was found in the Hastelloy N loop (containing |
7% Cr—5% Fe) and an iron plng'was found in the Croloy 9M loop (containing
9% Cr-bal Fe). Thus, it appears that when these fluorcborate salts

~are contained in alloys with between 7 and 9 wt % Cr, the iron content
of the alloy controls the comp031t10n of the temperature-gradaent

mass~transfer dep081t.

With the fOreg01ng data and evaluatlon, it is now p0381b1e to deter-
mine when plugging started ;n_NCL-lO and =12 and the dlsp031t10n_of each
element at various times. . R

 We calculated the interim concentrations for chromium and iron in

_ NCL-12 from knowledge of . the amount of these elements after test, the
"welght of the iron plug, and an assumed reaction-rate constant and mode
of chemical attack (from later experlments) 16 The results of the cal-

culatlons, presented in Table 7, show that the saturation value of iron

in’ the cold leg, 470 ppm, was reached after about 4000 hr of operation;
at that time, the chromium, as Na3CrFg, started deposmtlng in large
amounts. 1’

It is interesting to note that in both cases the amounts of the
alloylng elements in the salt and in the plug were in dbout the same
ratio as they are in the base metal. Capsule tests and other loop tests |
have shown that when conStituents of an alloy react with the liquid medium
they will be found in the liquid and/or deposited in the ratio at which
they existed in the alloy.l® This behavior was found in both loops of
this experiment. '

Nickel and molybdenum mass transfer products, not normally found in
relatively pure fluoride salf systems, also fbllcw this pattern. As has
been stressed here, the presence of gross quantities of nlckel and molyb-

denum indicates strongly oxidizing conditions.

Salt Purification

The salt used in these experiments contained many impurities that
the old techniques, successful with other fluoride salts, did not remove.
Since these experiments, improvements have been made in the fluoroborate
salt preparation. Only very pure salt (99.9%) is now used as starting
material. In fact, the salt has so few impurities that no steps are

 

17 Several suggestions, besides the removal of the water or oxygen
from the system, are offered to improve the service of the container
materials using this fluoroborate salt. The most obvious change is to
lower the hot-leg temperature to 540°C thus lowering the reaction-rate
constant an order of magnitude. It would then take three times as long
to duplicate the previous plugging. Another possibility is to raise the
temperature in the cold-leg section. This would raise the saturation
value of the elements in the salt, and depositing would not occur until
later. But this probably would not improve the life by the same factor as
above. Probably the most important improvement is removing corrosion
Products from the system on a continuous or batch-wise basis since
deterioration (thlnnlng) of the container wall by dissolutive corrosion
is not a problen in these systems.

taken during processing,to remove the structural metals. Purification

procedures for removing water and oxygen are now under study. A new
procedure is alse used in the.melting and preparation of the fluorcborate
salt to prevent'loss‘of BF3 vapor and the ensuing change of composition.
In brief, the loaded salt is evacuated to about 380 torr and heated to
150°C in a vessel lined with nickel and is held for about 15 hr under

these conditions. -If the rise in vapor pressure is not excessive, (no

volatile impurities) the salt is heated to 500°C, while still under

vacuum, and agitated with helium for a few hours. The salt is then
ready for transfer to the fill vessel.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Natural clrculatlon loops, fabricated from. Hastelloy N and
Croloy 9M, that c1rculated impure (> 3000 ppm.1mpur1t1es) NaBF, -NaF-KBF,

(90-4-6 mole %) at a max1mum;temperature of 605°C with a temperature

difference of 145°C evidenced serious temperature-gradient mass transfer.
The mass transfer involved migration of all major constituents of the con-
stituents of the container materials and resulted in restricting flow in
the Hastelloy N-leop by'dePOSition of Na3CrFe¢ crystals andfcomplete plug-
ging of the Croloy 9M loop by iron dendrites. -

2. The nonselective corrosion observed was due to the presence
of water, chemically'bound'to the fluordborate salts, that reacted
durlng heating to form HF. |

3. The driving fbrce fbr mass transfer'was the temperature depen-_

‘dence of the equllibrrwm constant between the conta1ner material con-
?stltuents and the,most stable,fluorlde compounds that cen,form in the

‘system.

4. The saturatlon concentratlons for iron and chromlum in the test
salt at. 460 C'were found to be 700 and 470 ppm, respectlvely

- 'EECOMNDATIONS |
1. Other, morerhighlﬁ'purified'fluoroborates should be extensively

tested for corrosion before these coolants can be qualified for molten-

salt reactor service.
 

 

38

2. Based on knowledge to data, iron-base and iron-containing alloys
should.be avoided in molten-selt reactor coolant circuits that use -
fluordborate salts.
