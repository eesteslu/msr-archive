ABSTRACT .

Fused salt fluorination tests were conducted at 600°C to determine the
feasibility of recovering plutonium as PuFg in the fused salt-fluoride volatility
process. Recoveries and material balances were good, although the initial
plutonium concentration in 50-50 mole % NaF~ZrF4 or 31-24-45 mole % LiF-
NaF-ZrF4 salt was only 2 ppm. The volatilization reaction appeared to be
approximately first-order with respect to the plutonium concentration in the
salt. Results of absorption of the volatilized PuFg4 on beds of LiF, CaFy, or
NaF indicate that this is a possible method of trapping the material in fluoride
volatility processes, possibly separately from UFg.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes exploratory work on the volatilization of PuFg from
fused salts with fluorine. Volatilization of uranium hexafluoride from fused fluorides
with elemental fluorine is the basis of a reactor fuel processing method being de-
veloped, and the comparable vapor pressures of PuF4 and UF4 indicate that plutonium
might be recovered with the uranium if the disparity between the chemical stabilities
of PuFg and UF¢ is unimportant (1-4). The recovery of plutonium as well as uranium
is necessary in the processing of reactor fuel of low enrichments.

The work was conducted with 0.1 mc of Pu-239 in each test to determine
whether volatilization of PuFg from fused salts is feasible and whether PuFg absorp-
tion on solid beds might be useful in the process. The favorable results obtained in
both areas indicate the desirability of extending the work to tests at higher plutonium
concentrations and under conditions that would prevail in actual processing. The
recovery of plutonium separately from uranium was briefly explored, and this repre-
sents another aspect needing further effort. '

The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the Analytical Chemistry
Group under J. H. Cooper in carrying out the a analytical work. F. L. Moore was
“particularly helpful in assisting with development of the analytical procedures. The
assistance of T. E. Crabtree and C. J. Shipman in the laboratory work and their
helpful suggestions were also invaluable.

2.0 FUSED SALT-FLUORIDE VOLATILITY METHOD

In the fused salt-fluoride volatility process being developed for uranium
recovery, two steps, namely, dissolution by hydrofluorination and UFg4 volatilization
by direct fluorination, are carried out in the presence of a fused salt at a tempera-
ture of 500-600°C (4). The third step, absorption of the UFg on NaF beds, results
in relatively complete decontamination of the UF¢ product from volatile or entrained
fission product fluorides. Based on the results reported here, adaptation of the process
for recovery of PuF, as well as UF4 appears feasible, although the fluorine utilization
in PuFg volatilization is low and fluorine recycle would probably be required (Fig. 1).
It also appears probable that the volatilized PuFg could be recovered by absorption,
either together with or separately from UFy4, on a system of fluoride beds. For separate
recovery of the PuF¢, a system for separate gaseous transfer and decontamination from
fission products would be needed. In many fuels the Pu/U ratio would be low, but
the process would also be operable with recycled plutonium fuel where this would
not be the case.

In the 18 fluorination experiments shown in Table 1, fused salts containing
~2 ppm of plutonium were used to determine the extent of PuFg volatilization and
to observe whether the volatilized PuFg could be trapped on various solid fluoride
beds. The data in Table 2 indicate that NaF, LiF, or CaFy is effective in absorption

of plutonium volatilized as PuFg. The material balances for many of the tests were
in the range 90-100% despite the use of only 0.1 mc of Pu-239 per run. In two tests
with uranium present the possibility of separating recovered plutonium and uranium
was indicated.

2.1 Retention of Plutonium in Fluorination of Fused Salts

In all tests the plutonium retained in the fused salt decreased during fluorina-
tion, indicating volatilization of PuFg (Table 1). The rate of disappearance of
plutonium from the fused salt had an approximately first-order dependence on the
concentration in the salt. Deviations from the first-order dependence could be due
to inhomogeneities in the gas or salt mixing.

In three lesls {(runs 7, 9, and 1U) with fluorine flow rates of 50, 100, and
150 ml/min, the volatilization rate constants (assuming a first-order dependence)
were approximately proportional, being, respectively, 0.11, 0.18, and 0.31 hr~
(Fig. 20). The corresponding half-value times in these tests were 6.5, 3.8, and
2.2 hr. It was concluded from this that the amount of plutonium transfer or vola-
tilization depends approximately on the total amount of gas passed through the :
salt. '

A special long-duration test of 20 hr (run 8) demonstrated that the initial
plutonium concentration of 2 ppm could be reduced to 1.4% or 0.028 ppm, with no
indication that this was a lower limit (Fig. 2b). The half-value time in the initial
part of this run, 4.0 hr, duplicated the result in run 7 under about the same condi-
tions. The curvature of the plotted data indicates that the fractional volatilization
rate increased v some extent as the experiment proceeded.

Tests at 600°C with 50-50 mole % NaF-ZrF4 salt (Fig. 3) instead of with
31-24-45 mole % LiF-NaF~ZrF 4 salt gave little indication that salt composition
was @ major variable. The half-value time (run 6) was about 3.4 hr. There was no
significant change in the volatilization rate at 500°C.

Fluorination with fluorine gos diluted with helium gave anomaloys data. With
a 50/50 F»/He gas mixture, there was initially a rapid decrease of plutonium in the
salt, but then the rate of disappearance decreased so that the final salt concentra-
tion of 34.0% (of initial level) in run 15 compares closely to the 34.6% in run 8.
A 25/75 Fo/He gas mixture definitely gave a slower plutonium disappearance rate.
Both runs were characterized by abnormally erratic data (Fig. 4).

Evidence was obtained that the rate of plutonium transfer from the fused salt
is enhanced by increasing the degree of dispersion of the F5 in the salt. In the first
16 runs the gas bubble size was the result of using a 1/4-in. tube immersed in the
salt. In runs 17 and 18, capillary fluorine inlets were used, giving half-value times
of about 2.5 hr, with little difference noted between fluorine flow rates of 100 and
150 ml/min (Fig. 5).

2.2 Behavior of PuF, Volatilized in Fused Salt Tests

In all except the first run the data indicated that the bulk of the volatilized
PuF ¢ was trapped in dry fluoride beds consisting of NaF, LiF, or CaFy (Table .2).
These materials appeared equally effective in the 25-100°C temperature. range.
CaF 5 was effective also at 400°C (run 11). There was some indication of a plu-
tonium breakthrough with NaF at 400°C (run 13), and there was detinite nonsorp-
tion on LiF at 400°C (runs 14 and 15).

2.3 Overall-Plutonium Material Balances

A good material balance was obtained in most of the runs, not only for the
total plutonium used in the test, but also for the part that was volatilized from the
salt (Table 2). The latter was calculated on the basis of the final fused salt concen-
tration, corrected for the amount of plutonium removed in fused salt samples. The
material balances obtained appear to be reasonable in view of the small amount of
initial plutonium used (100 pg) and of the large number of samples that had to be
analyzed.

The data show that some plutonium was retained on all wall surfaces within
the system. This was expected since such a small amount of plutonium was used.
The experience of other workers with PuF4 indicates that such loss is insignificant,
on a percentage basis, when handling 50~100 g quantities. '

2.4 Absorption as a Separation Method for PuF .~UF ., Mixtures

In one test the fluorine used in the volatilization step contained 7 mole %
UF4 (run 12). The absorption results (Table 3) show that it is possible to effectively
separate PuF, and UFg4. In this test with a 7% UF4-F5 mix the final fused salt con~
tained less than 100 ppm of uranium.

In a second test the initial fused salt contained 2.26% uranium (as UF4) in
addition to the usual plutonium spike (run 14). With a LiF bed at 400°C, however,
the PUF6 broke through to the following NaF bed. Similar plutonium behavior was
evident in run 15 where no uranium was present.

3.0 DISCUSSION

3.1 Fused Salt Volatilization

The conditions under which the above results were obtained do not duplicate
the conditions that might be expected in actual processing of reactor fuels. For
example, irradiated low-enrichment UO9 might be expected to have a plutonium
content of 5000 g/tonne after use as power reactor fuel. ‘When this fuel is dissolved
in fused salt, a reasonable uranium concentration would be about 5% with a plutonium
concentration of 250 ppm, which is far above the level of 2 ppm used in this work.
However, the adequate volatilization and recovery obtained at the 2 ppm level
indicate that little trouble would be encountered at the higher level.

The PuF¢ volatilization process appears to be primarily a sweep-out or sparging
action, as is also the case with UF¢ volatilizations at low concentrations (<1%).
-10-

In a typical run at a fluoride flowrate of 100 ml/min, the plutonium transfer
from salt to gas in the first minute of operation (assuming a first-order rate effect)
was ~0.3 pug. At a fused salt concentration of 250 ppm in actual fuel processing,
the initial transfer value would be increased to 37.5 pg. This is still well below the
value .of about 500 g in the first 100 ml of fluorine gas obtained by using data for
the equilibrium PuF, + Fp— PuFg at 150°C (2,3).

The data presented indicate that PuF4 volatilization from fused salt is slow,
but this does not mean that it is impractical as a processing technique. The super-
ficial linear velocity of the fluorine gas in the reactor (1 in. dia) varied from 4 to
12 in./min, to give half-times of 2.5-4 hr. Probably shorter half-times would be
achieved by increasing the gas flowrates to a superficial linear velocity of as much
as 500 in./min. Flows of this magnitude have been used in the HF sparging of salt
in the Oak Ridge Volatility Pilot Plant (5).

3.2 Absorption of PuFg

The existence of chemical complexes of PuFg with LiF, NaF, or CaF5 is indi-
cated by the results. Although less than 100-ug quantities were used, they were
trapped by these materials. It is dubious that this was due only to surface adsorption,
to a hydrolytic mechanism, or to simple filtration of entrained material. The chemical
complex concept, however, is consistent with the behavior of UF, with NaF, forming
the complex UFg-3NaF (6). An adsorption mechomsm is unlikely due to the fact that
the specific surface areas of these materials are 1 m /g or less. The hydrolytic mecha-
nism-is discounted because of the large excess of fluorine.

The similar behavior of PuFg to that of UFg in forming chemical complexes or
compounds is supported by similar reactions of NaF with other hexafluorides, e.g.
MoF¢, TcFg, and NpFg (7). The dissociation pressures of the UFg-NaF and MoF 4=
NaF complexes over a wide temperature range have been studied, and similar work
is needed on the other compounds. The UF,-NaF, MoF,~NaF, and probably the
NpF¢-NaF complexes appear completely reversible. The behavior of PuF¢ with NaF
and CaF, at 400°C indicates that these complexes might be irreversible under prac-
. tical conditions. The breakthrough of PuFg in a LiF bed at 400°C, in contrast to the
behavior at lower temperatures, shows that this complex might be more easily re-
versible than the others. UF, does not complex with LiF or CaF,, whereas PuF g
apparently does. ‘ -

In the one test (run 12) with both PuF¢ and UF,4 entering the absorption bed
train, the absorption of PuF, in the presence of a large excess of UF¢ further supports
the view that a PuF4~CaF o complex was formed. If surface adsorption had occurred,
it is reasonable to assume that the UF ¢ gas would have "washed off" the PuFg4 since
the condensation and vapor properties of the two materials are similar: sublimation
temperature of UFg 56.5°C, boiling point of PuF, 62.3°C.

4.0 EXPERIMENTAL TEST EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURE

4.1 Fluorination Work

The equipment for the plutonium work was mainly nickel vessels connected
by 1/4-in. copper tubing with compression-type tube fittings (Fig. 6). The nickel
fluorinator was constructed from 1-in.-dia tubing and was 6 in. long.: A 1/2-in.
entry port was provided for introduction of salt and plutonium spike solution. The
outlet was 1/4-in. nickel tubing about 6 in. long. In runs 1-16 the fluorine inlet
was a 1/4-in. dip tube, welded into the side of the vessel, which extended down to
about 1/4 in. from the reactor bottom. In runs 17 and 18 special capillary inserts
were attached to the end of the dip tube before insertion and welding. The 8-g
absorption traps were made from 1/2-in.-dia nickel tubing and were about 5 in,
long. " Nickel-wool plugs were used to retain the absorbent (12-20 mesh) in the
trap. The 5-g absorption traps were slightly shorter and made with a level cut in

a V-form to eliminate the necessity of using nickel wool retainer plugs.

The procedure consisted in inserting the LiF~NaF-ZrF4 or NaF-ZrF 4 salt,

" broken up into pea-size lumps, into the fluorinator, after which 100 ul of PuO2(NO3)o
solution. (~1 g Pu/liter) was placed directly on the salt, with care to avoid contact
with the metal walls of the reactor. The reactor was then inserted in the furnace and
connected to the gas tubing system. Heating was carried out slowly and carefully

with a helium sparge to decompose the aqueous plutonium spike solution. After the
reactor had reached the operating temperature of 500-600°C, the helium flow was
stopped and fluorine flow was started through the by-pass circuit to condition the
tubing, vessel walls, and absorption material, This was continued for about 1 hr.

All the opporctus was at operating temperature during the conditioning period.

Salt sc:mples were taken at intervals during fluorination, Each sampling was
preceded by a short helium sparge, and this time was not counted in the total fluori-
nation time. The salt samples (~0.5 g each) were taken with a 1/8-in.~dia nickel
rod by the quick-freeze technique, i.e. by quickly inserting the cold rod and with-
drawing it before the frozen salt could remelt. Experience with uranium and radio-
activity determinations has shown that this is a reliable method of sampling since
the frozen salt does not have a porous structure and the time lnvolved (2-4 sec) is
short.

A large safety trap containing ~1 kg of soda lime was placed at the end of
the gas system to absorb the fluorine and to ensure that no plutonium would leave
the system and contaminate the external working area. This worked efficiently,
only one replacement being made over the entire series of tests. No plutonium a
activity was ever detected on a paper gas filter placed at the exit of this trap.

The fluorine gas used in these tests was supplied by the Oak Ridge Gaseous
Diffusion Plant, It was passed through NaF to remove 3-5% HF before use. The
purity after this treatment was in the range 93-97%

Gas flowrates were controlled and measured with 50-mil-dia capillary flow-
meters, using 0.25 psi input differential pressure instruments to measure the Ap.

4.2 Analytical Methods

Suitable fluoride salt dissolution procedures had to be developed during the
test runs because of difficulties in initial analytical tests in achieving reproducible
results., Aluminum nitrate solution (1 M) was used initially to dissolve fluorination
salt samples as well as absorbent bed fluorides. Erroneous and erratic results were
obtained in using LaF3 precipitation followed by TTA extraction to measure the
plutonium a activity. Consultations with F. L. Moore and J. H. Coopcr at ORNL
indicated that the low plutonium analytical recoveries were due to APt and F~
interference in LaF3 precipitations and to ZrF4 interference in counting due to
its extraction by TTA. '

A satisfactory analytical method found was to use dilute aqua regia as the
solvent (method 3, below). However, even in this case the presence of dissolved
ZrF4, NaF, and LiF in the dilute aqua regia affected the plutonium a determinations.
The percentage recovery appeared reproducible, however, and method 3 was therefore
used with all types of material fo obtain comparative but not absolute values.

Method 1: Filter Paper Technique. In the first fluorination tests the fluoride
salts were dissolved in T M AI(NO3)3 solution (I g of salt in ~20 ml of solution).
Aliquots of these solutions were used successfully with a filter paper technique since
results could be quickly obtained and the fluorinations could be monitored as they
proceeded. Comparison of the filter paper results with LaF3-TTA results indicated
greater.reliability of the former over the latter, and hence the filter paper results
were used exclusively in the first three runs.

The filter paper technique consisted simply in slowly dropping 0.050 m! of the
1 M AI(NO3)3 solution onto a piece of 5-cm filter paper and allowing it to air dry
at 80-90°. The plutonium a activity was then counted with a scintillation counter
at 41% geometry.

Method 2: HNOs3 Dissolution. Dissolution of some of the absorbent bed
materials (run 4) in 4 M HNO3 gave accurate data by a standard LaF3-TTA analyti-
cal method. However, since the method was not suited for use with fluorination salt
samples, no further work was done with it,

Method 3: Dilute Aqua Regia Dissolution. Dilute aqua regia (4 M HNO3-
4 M HCI) at 95°C, in polythene containers, was suggested by C. J. Shipman as a
general dissolvent for all the fluorides. In 10 analytical runs in which an aliquot
spike of the standard Pu(NO3)3 solution in a synthetic salt solution (1 g of 31-24-45
mole % LiF~NaF-ZrF4 in 25 ml of dilute aqua regia) was used, plutonium recoveries
were 74.7, 77.9, 83.2, 81.5, 85.5, 74.3, 92.2, 95.6, 83.4, and 87.6%. The average
was 83.6%, with a standard deviation of 6.65. The counting level in these tests was
in the range 700-900 cpm/ml. The average recovery again demonstrated that some
interference (probably from ZrF4) was recurring in the analytical LaF3 precipitation-
TTA extraction procedure; however, the recovery was much higher than when aluminum
nitrate solution was used, and the variation in error was low.

In fused salt runs 6-10, inclusive, a statistical test of the zero-time values for
plutonium in the salt after spiking, melting, and helium sparging with duplicate
sampling showed the same average recovery value of 83.6% with a standard devia-~
tion of 6.35. The values obtained were 77.5, 90.4, 79.1, 95.2, 89.3, 89.3, 78.6,
81.3, 77.0, and 78.6%.
