Expasure of LiF-—Ber (66~34 mole %) containing about 107 % mole fraction CeF3 or NdF | to excess solid
UF3 caused removal of the rare earths from the molten solution, '
EXTRACTION OF RARE EARTHS FROM MOLTEN FLUORIDES INTO MOLTEN METALS
J. H. Shaffer, W. P. Teichert, D. M. Moulton, F. F. Blankenship, W. K. R. Finnell, W. R. Grimes . ..............
The distribution of rare earths (lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, samarium, and europium) between molten
Li.T*‘-Ber (66-34 mole %) and molten bismuth was studied at 600°C as a function of the concentration of

lithium netal added as a reducing agent.

REMOVAL OF PROTACTINIUM FROM MOLTEN FLUORIDES BY REDUCTION PROCESSES

The removal of protactinium from a simulated molten-salt breeder reactor blanket was demonstrated in a
six-week experiment in which liquid bismuth was recirculated through the blanket salt, a bed of steel wool,
and a bed of thorium metal chips. The evidence suggested that the protactinium was transported as a4 sus-

pension, perhaps associated with high«melting metallic compounds of iron, chromium, and thorium.

REMOVAL OF PROTACTINIUM FROM MOLTEN FLUORIDES BY OXIDE PRECIPITATION
J. H. Shaffer, W.:P. Teichert, W. K. R. Finnell, F. ¥. Blankenship, and W. R. Grimes ... ...

the addition of Zr02 at 600°C was studied with a variety of Zr(_)2 powders of differing surface areas (from
1.3 to 8O mZ/g). The results were not consistent with simple theories of either complete solid solution for-

mation or precipitation on the surface of the ZrO,‘2~

H. C. Savage, J. M. Baker, E. L.. Compere, M. J. Kelly, and E. G. Bohlmann .........c.cccei i
Irradiation of the first molten-salt thermal convection loop experiment in the ORR was terminated August
8, 1966, because of a leak through a broken transfer line after achieving power densities of 105 W/cm3 in
the fuel channels of the graphite core. A second loop, modified to eliminate causes of failure encountered

in the first, begins long-term irradiation in January 1967.

THE EQUILIBRIUM PHASE DIAGRAM FOR
THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF ,-ZF

R. E. Thoma H. A. Friedman
H. Insley?

Mixtures of 'LiF, BeF , and ZrF, are of especial
interest in this Laboratory because such mixtures
serve as the solvent for 23’5UF4 in the Molten~
Salt Reactor Experiment, Phase behavior of this
ternary system and of its constituent binary sub-
systems has, accordingly, been examined in some
detail. The binary systems LiF—BeF22'3 and Lib-
ZrF44 have been carefully investigated here and
elsewhere and have been described in available
literature. Study of the BeF ,-ZrF, and the LiF-
BeF -ZrF, systems was completed during the past
year.

Most of the data for these systems were obtained
by the technique of thermal gradient quenching
followed by careful examination of the products
by optical microscopy,® though the older technigue
of thermal analysis was of value in some regions.
The regions of liquid-liquid immiscibility in these
systems were defined with the help of high-temper-
ature centrifugation® and careful examination of
the separated products.

The combined data were used in construction of
the phase diagrams shown as Figs. 1.1 and 1.2

Invariant equilibria in these systems were found
to occur at the composition-temperature locations

As Fig. 1.1 indicates, the binary system BeF -

A single eutectic occurs at a relatively low ZrF,

concentration, and the system is free from binary

compounds. Two immiscible liquids occur in
mixtures containing 14 to 25 mole % ZF ; the
upper consolute temperature is near 740°C,

The LiF-BeF -ZiF, system (Fig. 1.2) is, so far
as we are aware, the only temary fluoride system
yet shown 1o include immiscible liquids, As the
temperature is increased above the liquidus, the
composition interval showing two liquid phases
steadily diminishes; it disappears at an upper
consolute point at 25 mole % LiF and 55 mole %
BeF, at 955°C.

This occurrence of two liquid phases in the
system at high concentrations of BeF, does not
prejudice use of materials in the composition region
near 65 mole % LiF and 30 mole % Bel, as fuel
solvents for molten-salt reactors.

PRELIMINARY STUDY OF THE SYSTEM
LiF-ThF -PaF

C. J. Barton H. H. Stone
G. D. Brunton

I the protactinium recovery studies described
in Chap. 3 of this report it has been generally
assumed that protactinium is present in the LiF-
ThE, (73 mole % LiF) melts as PaF,. This as-
sumption has seemed plausible since the melis
have, in every case, received a treatment with H,
at temperatures near 650°C, and since H, is known
to reduce pure PaF_ to PaF, at much lower temper-
atures. (The Pa'" state seems to be the lowest
known in fluoride sysiems.) We have, however,
conducted a few preliminary experiments to test
this assumption and to see if the phase behavior
of Pal’, is similar to that of Th¥, in mixtures
with LiF,

About 100 mg of ?*'PaF, was prepared by
evaporating a measured portion of purified stock
solution (9 M in HF) to dryness in platinum and
heating the residue to 600°C in flowing HF-H, mix-
tute. Conversion to PaF, was confirmed by weight
and by the brown color of the material. A portion of
this material was mixed with LiF-ThF4 (73 mole
% LiF) to yield a mix with 68 mole % LiF and 32
mole % (Th,Pa)F,. Another portion was mixed
with LiF and the LiF-ThF  mixture to yield a
mix with 73 mole % LiF and 27 mole % (Th,Pa)F4.
Both mixtures were admixed with ammonium bi-
fluoride (whose decomposition products on heat-
ing help to minimize possible hydrolysis), heated
to 650°C, and cooled slowly.

Examination of the slowly cooled melts showed
that segregation of Pal -rich phases from the
bulk of the LiF-ThF, material occurred in both
cases. Material from the mixture with 68 mole %
LiF is believed to be a solid solution of LiPaF
in LiThF_. One of the phases from the sample
with 73 mole % LiF is believed, because of its
similarity to the analogous uranium compound, to
be Li,PaF,. The PaF, does not appear iso-
morphous with ThF,; the LiF-PaF_  system may,
in fact, be more like the LiF-UF, than the LiF-
Th¥, system. It is obvious that study of the binary
LiF-PaF, system is needed before attempting
further deductions conceming phase relations in
the ternary system LiF-ThF -PaF,.

A portion of the LiF-ThF -PaF, mixture with
73 mole % LiF was transferred to a small thorium

crucible and heated to 650°C in a helium atmos-
phere. Examination of the material with the polar-
izing mictoscope revealed some LiSThF,V but a
large part of the mixture was in the form of opaque
angular fragments, which are probably protactinium
metal. X-ray examination will be required to con-
firm this conclusion.

APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIAL

L.. O. Gilpatrick

R. E. Thoma

Fluoborate mixtures containing high concentra-
tions of NaBF, appear useful as secondary cool-
ants in molten-salt breeder reactors.’
systems show significant BF, pressures at tem-
peratures above the liquidus, our standard tech-
niques of thermal analysis and thermal gradient
quenching are applicable only with difficulty to
these materials. We have, accordingly, developed
(with help from the ORNL

Since such

Instrumentation and
Division) a sensitive automatic differ-
ential thermal analysis apparatus for study of the
fluoborates.

This equipment, similar to that used by Holm,®
consists of a series of components assembled as
illustrated in Fig. 1.3, Specimens are contained
in sealed thin-walled nickel tubing, having outer
dimensions ¥ x 2.5 in. Temperatures are monitored
by armored 40-mil thermocouples which are posi-
tioned from below in reentrant chambers. Specimen
containers and thermocouple assemblies were de-
signed for minimal heat capacity, The specimen
thermocouple supplies a signal in opposition to
that from a matched cell containing fired Al,O,
as a comparison standard. Both cells are mounted
in a massive nickel block and out of direct thermal
contact with the block by means of ceramic sup-
ports.  An independent thermocouple embedded
in the block provides a signal which programs
the temperature and heating rate of the system as
a whole. Differential temperatures are recorded
as a fuanction of time on a model 7002AMR Moseley

and the resulting
samples were examined by use of a polarizing
microscope.  The principal findings of the in-
complete investigation are as follows: There is
one eutectic composition at about 19 mole % CeF ,
melting at 625 + 5°C, and two incongruently melt-
ing compounds, 3KF-CeF, and KF.CeF,. The
former melts at 675 + 5°C to give KF.CeF, and
liquid and it also decomposes on cooling at
595°C £ 5° giving KF and KF -CeF,. The latter
compound melts at 755 & 5°C giving liquid and a
Thermal
analysis did not indicate the upper and lower sta-
bility limits of 3KF .CeF,, nor did it provide reli-
able liquidus values for mixtures containing more
than 20 mole % CeF ..

It was interesting to compare the data obtained

of the slowly cooled melts,

cubic phase of unknown composition.

for this system with the proposed diagram for the
system KF-NdF, recently reported by Schmutz, '
He reported a eutectic containing about 20 mole %
NdF,, melting at 625°C 1 10° and three com-
pounds, 3KF.NdF,, KF.NdF,, and KF:ZNdP‘3,
melting incongruently at 695, 750, and 1115°C
respectively. His phase diagram was based on
differential thermal analysis data and examination
of the slowly cooled melts by means of x-ray dif.
fraction. On the basis of cur studies of quenched
melts it” seems probable that the system is more
complex than shown by Schmutz’ diagram. We
plan to perform further thermal analysis and quench-
ing studies to better define the composition of the
high-temperature cubic phase mentioned above,
It is quite possible that it is more closely re-
lated to the 5Nal’.9YF, compound!? than to the
simple 1 to 2 compound postulated by Schmutz,

Twenty-four positional parameters, four anisotropic
uranium temperature factors, and seven isotropic
temperature factors (Table 1.2) were determined
from 634 independent reflections measured by the
20-scan  technique with a scintillometer.  The
parameters were refined by least squares to an R
tactor of 0,082. Absorption corrections were made
for Cu Ka radiation on an oblate spheroid with a
short 36-p axis, (001], and a 64-p diameter for the
circular section. The U*” ion has eight I near-
est neighbors with bond distances of 2.21 to 2.39

are two Li* and another F™ at 3.27 and 3.39 A
respectively. The nine F7 ions are at the corners
of a l4-faced polyhedron which has the form of a
triangular prism with pyramids on each of the three
prism faces, and the two Lit ions are at the centers
of irregular F~ octshedra which share faces with
the uranium polyhedron. The Li'~F~ distances
are 1.82 to 2.28 A.

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF NaF-LuF,

A remarkable feature of the sodium fluoride—rare-

of a cubic phase whose lanthanide-rich composi~

radius) 1s even more surprising, Seeking a crystal-
chemical explanation of this behavior, we have
begun to determine crystal structures of cubic
NaF-LnF, materials of selected compositions.
Complete three-dimensional x-ray intensity data
have been collected for two cubic sodium lutetium
fluorides, whose compositions are 51.2 and 56.6%
LUF.s' Reflections were measured with a spectro-
goniometer and single-crystal orienter, using the
20-scan technique. Using full-matrix least-squares
and difference-synthesis methods,

ence of choice of lanthanide (i.e.,

a variety of
cation vacancy and anion interstitial models were
tested and refined. Basically, all models were
derived from the classical fluorite (Cal,) structure.

Best goodness of fit {(as judged by R factors
and difference syntheses) was obtained for each
crystal using a model consisting of 2 mixed cation
site at the origin, a fractionally occupied fluorine
site at (0.275, 0.275, 0.275), and a second {raction-
ally occupied fluorine site at (1/?, x, x). For
51.2% LuF ,, x = 0.114, and for 56.6% LuF,, x -
0.061. The corresponding R factors are 4.6 and
3.8% respectively.

Fluorine-fluorine distances are impossibly short
and would seem to be unacceptable even if x = 0.
The model is unrealistic also in the constraints
necessarily imposed upon thermal parameters in
order to assure convergence: the isotropic thermal
motion parameters of the two types of tluorine
were constrained to be equal.

We conclude that the anion interstitial model is
tenable only if the static fluorine displacements
from (1/4, Y ,3/4) and (1/2, 0, O) are fictitious and

anharmonic thermal occurs along

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF »-CsBeF,

H. Steinfink!? G. D. Brunton

The gamma (low-temperature) form of the com-
pound CsBeF, crystallizes in space group Pnma
with a) = 4.828 A, b, =6.004 A, and ¢, - 12.794 A,
The x~ray density is 3,56 g/cc, and Z = 4. Nine
positional parameters and 16 anisotropic tempera-
ture factors (Table 1.3} were determined from re-
flections measured on a Norelco PAILRED auto-
matic crystal data collector. The parameters were
refined by least squares to an R of 0.11.

Each Cs' ion is surrounded by eight F™ nearest
neighbors with bond distances of 3.02 to 3.92 A
(Fig. 1.5). The Be®" jons have four nearest
neighbor F7 ions at the corners of a tetrahedron.
The Be®™-F™ distances are 1.47 to 1.62 A, The
structure of this compound is similar to that of
the high-temperature form of BaGeO,.'® The re-
puision of the doubly charged Re®' jons increases
the Be-F distances where the F7 ions are shared
between two tetrahedra, This accounts for the un-
usually long (1.62 A) Be? *-F™ distances.

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF 3,-KLaF

D. R. Sears

Hexagonal (5 -KLaF, solidified as mecohedrally
twinned crystals of space group Pb, almost iso-
structural with NaNdF , and not with 8 -K UF,
as previously reported,'? Seven coordinates,
fourteen anisotropic thermal parameters, and one
occupancy fraction (vide infra) were determined
from 258 independent reflections measured with a
spectrogoniometer and single-crystal orienter,
using the 20-scan technique. The structural
parameters were refined to an R factor of 5.8%
using full-matrix least-squares methods and appear
in Table 1.4, The unit cell and some adjacent
atoms are illustrated in Fig. 1.6,

This cell, with a, = 6.530 £0.002 A, ¢, = 3.800 *
0.002 A, contains ‘?/2 formula weights of KLaF,
and is disordered with respect to fluorine occu-
pancy of a pair of unrelated sites on either ‘side
of the twinning planes and potassium occupancy
of a pair of half-occupied, crystallographically
equivalent sites above and below the horizontal
mirror planes. Furthermore, there exists a calion
site filled randomly by both lanthanum and potas-
stum  ions. Ordered lanthanum and disordered
potassium, as well as the mixed cation sites, are
all nine-coordinated by fluorines, each of which
is shared with five additional (but not identical)
coordination polyhedra. These polyhedra, compris-
ing the “tripyramidal’’ coordination, are
structed by erecting

con-
right pyramids upon each
rectangular face of a trigonal prism. In BI»KLaFV
individual polyhedra lack a 6 figure axis because
both fluorine and potassium are disordered.

The La-I¥ distances range from 2.36 to 2.51 A,
and the K-F distances from 2.46 to 3.05 A,

CENTRAL CATION DISPLACEMENTS IN THE
“TRIPYRAMIDAL™ COORDINATION

D. R. Sears

All cations in I\IaI\Ile“‘20 and KLaF, (preceding
section) are located in “‘tripyramidal’’ coordination
environments, Both sodinm and potassium exhibit
targe displacements from their ideal positions,
although it has been assumed®’ generally that the
cation shounld lie on the polyhedron medial plane.
Seeking an explanation of these data, we have cal-
culated potential energy sums 2?2 of the ““exponential-
six’’ form:

as well as the Coulombic sum 2 (l/rl.j) for various

anion configurations in the trifyyramidal coordina~
tion. We used values of o and s from 7 through 12
and incremented the central cation position along
the polyhedron figure axis from the medial plane
to the basal plane. Interactions beyond the poly-
hedron were ignored, the anion framework was
assumed to be rigid, and r, was taken to be the
sum of Pauling radii.

For the examples studied so far (Na, Nd, and
mixed Na + Nd in NaNdF4, and K, La, and mixed
K + La in f,-KLaF ) the Coulombic term varied
less than 0.1 to 1% for a 1-A displacement. By
contrast, relatively larger variations in the ex-
ponential-six and Lennard-Jones functions were
found. Results were nearly independent of choice
of function and choice of s or ¢, insofar as the
qualitative conclusions are concerned, and ac-
cordingly the results are presented here only for
o == 12 in the exponential-six case. In Table 1.5,
Az . is the experimental cation displacement,
Az .. is the location of the minimum in the poten-
tial function, Az(1%) is the displacement from the
minimum corresponding to a 1% increase in poten-

tial, and \/L;g; is the rms thermal displacement
derived from the experimental thermal parameters
f3,, corresponding to vibration along the poly-
hedron figure axis (i.e., the hexagonal z axis).

We conclude that the cation displacements can
be rationalized in terms of the relative insensitivity
of the Coulombic interactions to cation location
in these structures and that displaced potential
minima, or very shallow minima, in the remaining
potential contributions will suggest which anion
configurations will favor or permit cation dis-
placements,

Calculations are being extended to include other
framework structures containing tripyramidal co-
ordination polyhedra.

PREPARATION OF FLUORIDE SINGLE
CRYSTALS FCR RESEARCH PURPOSES

R. E. Thoma R. G. Ross
H. A. Friedman

Our efforts to develop techniques for the produc-
tion of large (350 g), pure single crystals of LiF
with selected isotopic ratios*® have succeeded in
the production by Stockbarger-Bridgman methods
of crystals of as high chemical purity as can be
obtained with Czochralski techniques. Concentra-
tion of heavy-metal impurities in crystals produced
this year was found to be less than 2 ppb from
activation analysis and thermal conductivity data.
Thermal conductivity of these crystals, as meas-
ured by investigators at Cornell University, was
found to be virtually identical through the tempera-
ture range 2 to 50°K with the best "LiF crystals
grown from our starting materials by the Czochral ski
method.

Since purity control has been developed to the
extent that further improvement is limited by the

capabilities of the analytical methods (spectro-
chemical, infrared absorption, and activation
analysis), most recent efforts have sought to
reduce the population of crystal dislocations. By
programming the reduction of annealing tempera-
tures at a slow steady rate after crystal growth,
in one experiment at 2.5°C/hr in the temperature
range from 840°C to room temperature, the popula-
tion of crystal dislocations in LiF crystals has
been reduced significantly. Preliminary indica-
tion of the effectiveness of such programmed an-
nealing was obtained by neutron diffraction ex-
amination of ORNL-14,%% a 550-g crystal of lithium
fluoride of 99.993 at, % ’Li, which showed a major
volume of the crystal to be essentially free of
disorder.

Part of the effort to synthesize fluoride single
crystals was devoted to the preparation of crystals
for use in x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments.
For such purposes, neither size nor purity stand-
ards are as demanding as those imposed for LiF
preparation. Single crystals (approximately 1 cm
maximum dimension) of each of the three com-
pounds Li,BeF,, Na Zr F, , and "Li,NaTh,F,
were grown by the Stockbarger-Bridgman method.
For other structural investigations?® which employ
even smaller crystals, suitable single crystals
of [-CsBeF, and Li UF, were grown by high-
temperature anneal-quench experiments.

A POLYMER MODEL FOR LiF-BeF, MIXTURES

C. F. Baes, Jr.

The salts LiF and BeF, are quite dissimilar in
character; LiF is a normal icnic salt, while BeF
quite evidently is more covalent since it foms
a very viscous liquid' which is obviously poly-
meric.  Solid BeF, has a structure analogous to
510 ,; Be?t jons are surrounded tetrahedrally by
four flucride iens, and each F7 ion is bonded to
two Be?' ions, that is, BeFf* tetrahedra share
comers to form a three-dimensional network., The
liguid would be expected to have a similar poly-
meric structure. As LiF is added to molten BeF ,
the viscosity drops sharply,! presumably because
bridging fluorids linkages ave broken,

and the degree of polymerization decreases. The
stoichiometric end point for this process occurs
at the composition ZLil*-BelF,. Thereafter, the
principal beryllium species in the melt presumably
is BeF 27,

This plausible qualitative picture of LiF-BeF
melts has been treated more quantitatively in the
following fashion. It was assumed that all of the
many Be-F complexes formed would retain the
same three elements of structure — I-BeF42“ tetra-
hedra, bridging F7 ions, and teminal F7 ions.
For a given complex anion Be F (P-28)= it can
then be shown that there are 4a — b bridging ¥
ions and 2b ~ 4a teminal F7 ions. Hence, for
the formation reaction,

the number of bridging ¥~ ions increases by 4a — b
while twice that number of terminal F~ ions dis-
appear. It seems reasonable, therefore, to write
as an approximation for the free energy of reaction
the equation

AG, =(4a - B4, (3)
in which {at a given temperature) A is a constant
representing the free energy increase associated
with the formations of 1 mofe of bridging ¥ bonds
from 2 moles of terminal F~ bonds. The develop-
ment of the model from this approximation is sum-
marized in Table 2.1, and equation numbers given
below are from that table. In the equilibrium con-
stant expression (Eg. 4), the anion activities are
represented by adaptations (Egqs. 5-7) of Flory’s
equation? for polymer solutions, in which the vol-
ume fraction (9’5a,b) of Beanj(bwza)b is calculated
in terms of the number of ¥ ions the species
containg (Eq. 8). These modified Flory equations
also contain a heat of mixing parameter (8) and
an average value of b (b, Eq. 7) in the mixture.
From Eqs. 4-9, the volume fraction of a given
polymeric ion (¢, ,) may be cslculated (Eq. 10)
in terms of a, b, the volume fraction of BeF 2~
(961'4), the volume fraction of F™ ((760’_1) and the
two adjustable parameters A and B. Introducing
this expression for an,b info two material balance

PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES
IN THE U0,-Z<0, SYSTEM

K. A. Romberger C. ¥. Baes, Jr.
H. H. Stone

The previously described study of the UO, —?rO
system in which a molten-salt flux was u‘;ed to
achieve equilibrium between the oxide phases has
been completed during the past year. The com-
position assigned to the tetragonal solid solutions
at the eutectoid temperature (1110°C) has been

17

increased from the value 1 mole % uo, reported
previously to 2.7 mole % on the basis of recent
measurements which indicate that the previous
result had not corresponded to equilibrium. In
addition, analyses have been obtained on a mix-
ture of cubic UO, and monoclinic ZrO which had
been equlhbrated with a molten salt at ~600°C
for 60 days® glvmg ~0.3 mole % ZrO, in UO,
and ~0.07 mole % UG, in ZrO . These results
indicate a lower rate of eysolutmn of the two
phases with decreasing temperature than previously
estimated.

The revised phase boundaries in Fig. 2.1 reflect
these changes. In addition, the boundares below
1150°C reflect the distribution behavior expected
for dilute solid solutions in the three two-phase
regions C =& M, M & T, and C = T. In partic-
ular, it was assumed that the distribution coeffi-
cient (P, a ratio of mole fractions) for one com-
ponent between two solid solutions at equilibrium
would obey the relationship

log D =a+ b/T. (17)

In the case of the M = T equilibrium, the esti-
mated dependence of Xz.0 (T)/Xz.6,(M) on tem-
perature indicates the enthalpy of the M — T transi-
tion in pure ZrO, (1170°C) to be 1.7 1 keal/mole.
This compares favorably with = measurpd value
of ~1.4 keal.” Just above 1150°C (the upper
limit of the present measurements) it is clear that
values of D wmust deviate markedly trom those
predicted by Eq. (17) (corresponding to the sharply
bending dashed curves in Fig. 2.1) if the C = T
phase boundaries are to be consistent with the
publisted higher temperature data,  Such pro-
nounced deviations from ideal behavior in solid
solutions that are still quite dilute seem unusual.
Consequently, additional measurements between
1150 and 1500°C by the methods used here would
be of considerable interest.

THE OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF ThF ,-UF, MELTS

The precipitation of protactinium and uranium
from LiF—BeF2-’1“hF4 mixtures by addition either
of BeQ or ThO_ was demonstrated several years
ago by Shaffer et al.® 1'% as a possible method
for processing an MSBR blanket salt. The purpose
of the present investigation is (1) to verify that
the oxide solid phase formed at equilibrium with
UFq-’I‘hE‘4—containing melts is the expected solid

the oxide and the fluoride solutions,

U*T(£) + Th*'(0) = U* (o) + Th*'(f) (18)
(here f and o denote the fluoride and the oxide
phases).

The experimental technique is similar to that
used in the U0,-Z:0O, phase study (see preceding
section); Th()2 and UO, were contacted with 2LiF-
Bel®, containing U¥, and ThF, within nickel
capsules under a hydrogen atmosphere in a rocking
furmmace. The equilibrated oxide solids were al-
lowed to settle before the samples were frozen.
Good phase separation was obtained provided suf-
ficient quantity of the fluoride phase had been
added originally.

A (U-Th)O, solid solution has been found in
every sample examined thus far; the lattice param-
eter determined by x-ray diffraction'! was con-
sistent with the composition calculated for such
an oxide phase. The equilibrium quotient for the
metathesis reaction shown above was determined
by analysis of the fluoride phase for the small
amount of uranium which it contained. 'The results
obtained thus far give

while the mole fraction of thorium in the fluoride

It thus appears that the Ut present is strongly
extracted from the fluoride phase by the oxide
solid scolution formed at equilibrium. This con-
firms the effective precipitation of U*" by oxide
first reported by Shaffer et al.® In addition, the
formation of a single oxide solution phase offers
a much more flexible and effective oxide separation
method for breeder blankets than would be the
case if only the separate oxides ThO, and UO,
were formed.

THE OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF LiF.BeF,-ZrF,
MIXTURES

B. F. Hitch C. F. Baes, ]Jr.

Measurements of the solubility of BeO in LiF-
BeF , melts and of Z10, in 2LiF—BeF2 + ZtF | melts
(simulating mixtures of MSRE flush salt and fuel
salt) have been completed. As described previ-
ously,??1? the procedure consisted in withdrawing
from an oxide-saturated melt a filtered sample
which was then sparged with an HF-H, mixture
to remove the dissolved oxide as water. The total
amount of water liberated was determined by Karl
Fischer titration. The principal difficulty en-
countered with the method was in filtering the
samples. Particularly in the case of BeO-saturated
melts, the oxide crystals evidently were sometimes
small enough to pass through or to plug the filter.
The BeO solubility measurements were found to
be reproducible only after sevefal days of equili-
bration at temperatures above 600°C. Considerably
less difficulty was encountered with melts satu-
rated with Z:O -

The results of these measurements are repre-
sented adequately (> £20%) by the following ex-
pressions; the concentration unit employed is the
mole fraction:

Xizni/(nt,ilr +nBeF2+anF4) . (20

log b= 1.195 - 2055/T .

The results are reasonably consistent with pre-
vious, less direct estimates!* based upon measure-
ments of the following equilibria:

H, (0 + 2F~(d) = 0%7(d) + 2HF(g) , (23)
H,0(g) + BeF (d) = BeO(s) + 2HF(g) , (24)
2}120(g) + ZrF4(d) = ZIOQ(S) + 4HF(8) . (25)

The tolerance of MSRE flush salt for oxide should
be determined by the solubility of BeO (Fig. 2.2).
When the flush salt becomes contaminated with
enough fuel salt (~1.6% by weight) to produce a
Z1F | concentration of 0.0008 mole fraction, Z:0,
should appear as the least soluble oxide. The
oxide tolerance should then decrease with increas-
ing fuel salt content because of the mass action
effect of the increasing concentration of ZrF .
This oxide tolerance should pass through a mini-
mum at X, ™ 0.01 (Fig. 2.2), and then it should
increase because of the effect of the medium upon
Z10, solubility. The oxide tolerance of such fuel-
salt—flush-salt mixtures is given by

The solubility of ZrO, was also measured in a
salt mixture whose composition (65.5% LiF-29.4%
Ber-—S.l% ZrF4) simulated more closely the
MSRE fuel composition than did the 2LiF-BeF , +
ZrF , mixtures. The results (Fig. 2.2) differ little
from the values given by the equation immediately
above for the case where X, 44 = 0.05.

The effect of salt composition on the Zr0, solu-
bility product may be caused, at least in part, by
specific chemical effects, that is, complex forma-
tion. For example, the form of the expression for
the wvariation in the Z10, solubility product is
consistent with — though it does not prove the
existence of - the following complex-forming
reaction,

CONSTANT-VOLUME HEAT CAPACITIES
OF MOLTEN SALTS

Stanley Cantor

From the magnitude of the constant-volume heat
capacity (C ) of molten salts one can infer what
kinds of motion are executed by the ions. An
attempt has been made, therefore, to derive ac-
curate values of C_ and to relate these values

20

to ionic motions. In this study, C_ was calcu-

lated from the relationship

C

_ p
v 1+(a2(12MT/Cp), (28
where C_is the heat capacity at constant pressure
of 1 gram-formula weight, a is the volume expan-
sivity, p is the velocity of sound in the molten
salt, M is the gram-fommula weight, and T is the
absolute temperature. The volume expansivity is

obtained from density-temperature data by

1 <ap>
p \OT o

where p is density and p is pressure.

For systematic study, it is necessary to compare
C, of the salts at corresponding temperatures.
An obvious corresponding temperature is the melt-
ing point. Other corresponding temperatures were
defined empirically by the equation

a =

T=T,+ (J‘(TB -T,), (29)
wherte T, and T, are the normal melting and boil-
ing points respectively, and €/ is a constant that
may vary between 0 and 1.

Values of C at T, and at some other corre-
sponding temperature are given in Tables 2.2 and
2.3. An obvious limitation of this treatment
that, since virtually all available data were ob-

15

tained at atmospheric pressure, the values cal-
culated for a single salt at the various tempera-
tures (as in Table 2.2) do not refer to precisely
the same volume. A method for calculating the
effect of temperature on a truly constant-volume
heat capacity is described briefly in the following
section.

The ‘‘experimental” C ’s listed in Tables 2.2
and 2.3 exceed in almost all cases thosze calcu-
lated on the basis of contributions due to (1)
harmonic oscillation, (2) molecular rotation, (3)
intraionic vibrations. For the halides, it may be
shown that for contributions 1 through 3, the
highest calculated C would be based on the as-
sumption that each ion executes harmonic oscil-
lations in three coordinates. For instance, for
an alkaline-earth halide, if we assume only har-
monic oscillation, then C_ for 1 gram-formula weight

would be 9R cal/deg. If we assume a model for

contribution for these complex ions may be safely
assumed as 3/2R. Contributions due to harmonic
oscillation for the nitrates were assumed equal
to 6R, and for the sulfates, 9R. Note in Table 2.3
that the experimental C  for these salts always
exceeded the value calculated based on the con-
tributions just noted.

Two general patterns are clear from this study:
(1) experimental C, exceeds that calculated on
the basis of simple classical and/or quantum con-
tributions; (2) C, decreases with increasing vol-
umes. Pattern 1 may be partly explained by cor-
recting the notion that these ions execute harmonic
oscillations; almost certainly these ions may be
better represented as anharmonic oscillators whose
potential energy contribution exceeds the 3/21(T per
ion that is associated with harmonic motion (see
following section); this excess cannot presently
be calculated with very much accuracy. Pattem 2
probably reflects the decrease in average potential
energy per ion that occurs when the volume of the
liquid increases. In other words, the liquid ex-
hibits moie gaslike behavior as volume increases;
the kinetic energy contribution per ion probably
remains at efsz, but the potential energy contri-
bution slowly decreases with volume.

TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF C
FOR MOLTEM SALTS

Stanley Cantor

As noted in the previous section, experimental
values of C_ for molten salts exceeded values
calculated from the expected contributions (i.e.,
degrees of freedom). To determine how the inter-
nal energy is changing with temperature alone,
it is necessary to evaluate C  maintaining the
volume constant with changing temperature. The
method of evaluation used here is similar to that
published by Harrison and Moelwyn-Hughes. !’

Owens’ *? data on nitrates afford the only experi-
mental tests of whether these equations are valid
for molten salts, His work suggests that the for-
mulas are obeyed at constant temperature but that
¢ varies somewhat with temperature. For NaNO .,
for example, ¢ = 4.5 at 400°C and 5.0 at 500°C,

For all salts, CV increased with temperature when
compression was nccessary ‘to maintain constant
volume. When pressure was decreased, C_  de-
creased with temperature. Some typical results are
shown in Tables 2.4 and 2.5. ‘

These increases of C_ may be correlated with a
decrease in the elastic forces holding the ions
together. Such a decrease in elastic forces for
the crystalline state usually means that the aver-
age potential energy exceeds the average kinetic
energy,2 ! Because the temperature range examined

narrow ranges for A and b are perhaps more under-
standable. Compressibility at low pressure most
likely represents squeezing against the volume not
occupied by the ions, that is, the “‘free” volume.
Since the forces exerted by the ions on this free
volume should be virtually independent of the kind
of ions, it follows that increases in free volume
which occur with temperature should be roughly
the same for all ionic liguids; hence the tempera-
ture dependence of squeezing against the free
volume would also be essentially independent of
the ions involved.

ViSCOSITY AND DENSITY IN THE LiF-BeF,
SYSTEM

C. T. Moynihan %2 Stanley Cantor

Densities and viscosities of selected composi-
tions in the LiF-Bel  system were measured to
determine if temperature coefficients of viscosily
are correlated with coefficients of volume expan-
sion.

The viscosity of pure BeF, was measured over
the temperature range 573 to 985°C, using Brook-
field LVT and HBF 5X viscometers. In this range
the viscosity, 7, varied from 10 to 10° poises and
was about 10% greater than previously reported. 23
The plot of log n vs 1/T(°K) showed only slight
curvature. A least-squares fit of the data to an
equation quadratic in 1/7T yielded

log  (poises) = —8.119

(standard error in log # = 0.013). This equation
yields an activation energy for viscous flow of
57.3 kcal/mole at 985°C and 59.6 kcal/mole at
575°C. These are relatively small activation en-
ergy changes; thus the temperature dependence
of viscosity for BeF, is basically Arthenius over
the range covered in this investigation (10 to 10°
poises).

The densities of three BeF Z—LiF mixtures (see

method by measuring the apparent weight loss of
a platinum sinker upon immersion in the melt.
Volume expansion coefficients (i.e., expansivities)
derived from the density data decreased with de-

In none of the four attempts to measure the BeFQ
density was it possible to eliminate the few small
bubbles that adhered to the sinker. The buoyant
effect of the bubbles leads to low values of the
apparent weight of the sinker and hence the high
values of the density. If a surface tension of
200 dynes/cm is assumed for BeF , the best of
our density results yielded a value of 1.96 +0.01

Transpiraticn Studies in Support of the

tration in the still; this high concentration of lan-
thanum in the melt was required in order to give
lanthanum concentrations in the vapor that were
high enough to analyze.

Measurements were carried ouf in the temperature
interval 1000 to 1062°C; dry argon, the entraining
gas, flowed over each melt at the rate of about
30 em®/min. Salt vapor, condensing in a nickel
tube, was analyzed by spectrochemical and neutron
activation methods. The latter method gave higher,
more consistent, and probably more reliable lan-
thanum analyses. The most consistent results have
been obtained at the two temperatures shown below.

(in which the electrode compartments were of

tially successful because the voltage of this cell
invariably decreased with time, It is infecred, but
has not yet been proved, that the cell voltage
decreased because a small amount of beryllium
metal dissolved in the 2LiF-BeF  solvent and
intemally shorted the cell. However, before these
decreases became marked, reasonably stable
voliages were observed, in one case for as long
as three days. |

Measurements of the cell voltagge were made asg a
function of increasing NbFX concentration. (NbF ,
was added to the melt by anodic dissolution of nio-
bium metal.) The voltage first increased and then
remained constant, an indication that the melt
had become saturated with NbFX. Based upon the
number of faradays which were required to reach
saturation and the amount of melt within the nio-
bium compartment, it is estimated that at 597°C
the solubility was ~3 x 1077 equivalent of the
niobium salt per kilogram of solvent. The cell
voltage at saturation was 0.96 1 0.04 v. This value
can be combined with the free energy of formation

The beryllium electrode has now been replaced
by an H_,HF/F~ half-cell. The latter, while less
convenient to use than the Be?/Be?" half-cell, is
expected to yield voltages which are more stable
and reproducible. No results are yet available from
this new cell.

The value of X, that is, the oxidation state of
the niobium in the presence of the metal and the
fluoride salt, appears to be +2. This is a tentative
conclusion based upon the results of a transpira-
tion experiment in which a known amount of gas-
ecous HF was used to partially oxidize niobium
metal in contact with the melt. The value of the
oxidation number was then determined from the
amount of metal which was consumed. No apparent
evolution of NbFS occurred, which is consistent
with a stable lower valence state.

The value for EA(Li F) indicates the general de-
gree of uncertainty in these values.

With the derived value of D(LiF2 —Li) = B.00 ev,
one would anticipate the possibility of producing
Li* from the dimer at an AP of 8.00 + 5.36 =
13.36 v. Our value of AP (Li*) = 13.6 + 0.3 indi-
cates that this process is responsible for APHI(Lf ).
The second appearance potential, APH(Li*), is,
it real, not readily explainable since the lowest
excitation level for F° is 14.4 ev and for Li',
much more. Invoking possible precursor excitation
is not a happy explanation in view of the 0.5v
difference between API(LiJ’) and API{(L1+) and the
agreement of our value of D{LiF) with the literature.

The onset potential for the mixed species LiBelF *
can be used to estimate a D(LiBeF, —F) = 7.9 v,
which is near D(BeF) = 8.02.%° This indicates that
the fluoride atoms are all associated with the
beryllium in the vapor species LiBeF . Consid-
eration of the energies and bond strengths and the
near agreement between API(Li2F+) from LiF with

that from Li BeF, make it seem unlikely that
Li BeF is a precursor of Li2F+.

For BeF 2+ an additional set of possibilities must
be considered as causes of structure in the LE.
curve, These include autoionization and meta-
stable ion formation. Since all of the ions except
possibly Li* present marked similarity of structure,
it seems most plausible that even for the species
from Li BeF the structure observed is attributable
to ionic excitation, either vibrational or electronic.

The energies determined can be used to predict
possible appearance potentials beyond the limited
range used in these studies. For examples,

cause any irregularity in the Knudsen cell opera-

Some initial determinations were made of slopes
of log (I'"T) vs 1/T for LiF species in order to
provide some comparison with the literature values

REMOVAL OF JODIDE FROM LiF-BeF, MELTS

C. E. L. Bamberger C. F. Baes, ]r.
The removal of iodide from LiF-Be¥F  mixtures
by HF sparging, presumably by the reaction

HF(g) + I™(d) « F~(d) + HI(g) , (1

was previously described!’? as a promising method
for removing 6.7-hr '3°I from an MSBR fuel at a
rate greater than the rate of decay of this nuclide
to !3%Xe.

One difficulty with the results rteported pre-
viously was that poor recoveries (typically 80%)
of iodide were obtained by HIF sparging. In con-
tinued studies the cause of this has been traced
to small particles of salt entrained in the gaseous
mixture of HF, HI, and H, emerging froimm the re-
action vessel. Evidently these particles caused
condensation of the HF and HI with water vapor
in the NaOH bubbler used to trap the HI. The
condensed droplets of acidic solution, readily
visible as a fog in the gas phase of the trap,
evidently did not react completely with the NaOH
solution, thus causing low recoveries. Introduc-
tion of a filter of sintered Teflon or gold in the
effluent gas stream ahead of the trap has resulted
in iodide recoveries greater than 95%.

It was ifound previously that the fraction of
iodide the melt ((I7]/[1719 de-

This interpretation of the previous data was sup-

subsequent measurements, however, a fuller study
of the effect of the HF pressure at different tem-
peratures and as a function of melt composition
has shown a pronounced effect. It has been
found (Fig. 3.1) that Q varies approximately in-

versely with PHF as follows:

the above expression can be accounted for with
a=1/Q and b = Q,. Sparging with HI as well
as HF is presently being used to determine
whether or not equilibrium conditions are being
attained during the measurements and to determine
the solubility or other possible reactions of HI
in these melts.

Whether the dependence of @ on PHF is due to
a rate effect or to the occurrence of other equi-
libria in addition to reaction (1), it seems evident
that, in the application of this treatment to the
processing of an MSBR fuel, better HF utilization
(higher Q values) will be obtained at lower HF
partial pressures, The limiting (maximum) value

REMOVAL OF RARE EARTHS FROM MOLTEN
FLUORIDES BY SIMULTANEGUS
PRECIPITATION WITH UF,

F. A Doss H.F.McDuffie J. H. Shaffer

The relatively low solubility of UF, in fluoride
mixtures of interest to the MSR program?® and the
known similarities of the crystal structure of rare~
earth trifluorides with UF34 provide a basis for
studies of the precipitation of solid solutions of
these compounds from fluoride melts.  Since
fission product rare earths represent a major
portion of the poison fraction in the fuel of a
molten-salt nuclear reactor, this study may be
applicable toward the development of suitable
reprocessing methods for rare~earth removal.
Initial experiments conducted in this program con-
sidered the reduction of UF, contained in a re-
actor fuel mixture to UF, and the simultaneous
precipitation of rare-earth trifluvorides with UF,
as the temperature of the fuel mixture was re-
duced. A second series of experiments is in
progress to examine the precipitation of rare
earths from a simulated fuel solvent upon addi-
tion of solid UF ,.

If all UF, contained in the current MSRE fuel
mixture, LiF-BeF -ZrF -UF, (65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9
mole % respectively), were reduced to UF,, the
solution would be saturated with UF, at approxi-
mately 725°C. By lowering the melt temperature
to 550°C, approximately 83.5% of the uranium
would be precipitated from solution. Results of
preliminary experiments designed to investigate
this reprocessing method demonstrated that LaF ,
CeF,, and NdF, could be precipitated with UF ,.
Europium and samarium were probably reduced to
their divalent states by the in situ reduction of
uranium with added zirconium metal and showed
little or no loss from solution during the pre-
cipitation of UF,. Subsequent experiments with
excess reducing agent showed that cerium removal
could be related to the U®" concentration in solu-
tion by the equation

in the extraction systein are currently in progress
to ascertain activity cecefficients of lithium and

Fluoride starting materials were prepared in
nicke! equipment by treatment with HF-H, mix-
tures at 600°C to remove oxide impurities and at
700°C with H, alone to reduce concentrations of
structural metal difluorides in the fluoride melts.
Selected rare-earth fluorides were added prior to
this treatment in quantities sufficient to attain
concentrations of about 10~ * mole fraction in the
salt mixture. Bismuth was further purified by
treatment with H, at 600°C in the 204L stainless
steel, low-carbon-steel-lined extraction vessel,
Following this treatment the prepared salt mixture
was transferred as a liquid to the extraction
vessel, Each experiment typically contained
2.35 kg of bismuth and about 2 kg of the salt
Lithiuin, for incremental additions to
the experiment, was freshily cut and tared under
mineral oil, affixed to a small-diameter steel rod,
rinsed in benzene, and dried in the flowing inert
atmosphere of the loading port prior to its in-

each phase for rate-earth gamma activity and
spectrographic analyses of the metal phase for
rare-earth and lithium concentrations provided
data for calculating the distribution of rare earth
in the system and its dependence on the lithium
concentration of the metal phase. A summary of
these results, illustrated in Fig. 3.4, shows that
a mixture containing 0.02 mole fraction of lithium
metal sufficed for removing essentially all cerium,
lanthanum, and neodymium and substantial quan-
tities of samarium and europium from the barren
fuel solvent under separate but comparative con-
ditions. In all experiments rare earths that were
reduced from solution in the salt phase were
found as dissolved components of the metal
phase.

The reduction of rare-earth fluorides by lithium
is expected to proceed by the reaction

where m is the effective valence of the rare-earth
cation, If unit activities prevail for all metal
species in the salt phase and for all ionic species
in the metal phase, then the activity of lithium

It was found, however,

In experiments where lithium metal was
added to the system, the lithium loss was pro-
portional to the square of the mole fraction of
lithium in bismuth. Such behavior suggests the
presence of a reduced divalent species at less
than unit activity, for which the most obvious
choice is Be? dissolved in the melt. When Be®
was added to the melt, the lithium loss was pro-
portional to the first power of XLi(Bi)’ which
is consistent with the formation of neither Be%(d)
nor Be +(d). For a third set of experiments, where
salt was added to bismuth containing lithium,
the loss was independent of the lithium concen-
tration, indicating the presence of some easily
reduced impurity in the melt. No simple mecha-
nism bas been devised to explain all three of
these reactions.

It is known that certain properties of this melt
[e.g., heats of solution of HF and solubilities of
PuF , and (RE)FS] show extreme values at the
ratio 2Li:Be. The salt composition used in the
described experiments started at about this con-
centration and went to opposite sides of it. One
can conceive, therefore, that further experimenta-
tion may reveal solvent effects which are as yet
unexplained.

In the beryllium-addition experiments at 600°C
a limiting mole fraction of lithium in bismuth was
reached. As this was well below the solubility,
it was assumed that the lithium was in equilibrium
with metallic beryllium. From this it was possible
to calculate an activity coefficient for lithium of
9.8 x 107° to 1.3 x 10~ * (two experiments) for
the mole fraction of lithium referred to a standard
state of unit activity (i.e., pure lithium). A sim-
ilar analysis gave the activity coefficient of lith-
ium in lead as 1.5 x 10>,

REMOVAL OF PROTACTINIUM FROM MOLTEN
FLUORIDES BY REDUCTION PROCESSES

J. H. Shaffer W. P. Teichert
D. M. Moulton F. F. Blankenship
W. K. R. Finnell W. R. Grimes

The removal of protactinium from solution in
LiF-BeF -ThF, (73-2-25 mole %) has been
demonstrated by adding thorium metal that was
either put directly in the salt mixture or initially
dissolved in molten lead or bismuth that was in
contact with the salt.® More recent studies have
examined methods by which this reduction re-
action might be used for reprocessing the fertile
blanket of a two-region molten-salt breeder re-
actor. The results of several batch-type laboratory
experiments led to the design and operation of
a small pump-loop experiment which has demon-
strated, in principle, the removal of protactinium
from the fluoride mixture by a liquid-liquid ex-
traction technigue.

In static batch-type experiments,
fractions of 233Pa
on adding thorium
components of the
of the
used in these experiments indicated that most of
the precipitated protactiniuin had deposited on the
vessel walls that were in contact with the salt
phase. Although this behavior may have resulted
from nonwetting characterigtics of the two liquid
phases, an experiment was conducted to examine

distributed on steel wool that had been immersed
in a blanket salt mixture. When this salt mixture
was drained from the vessel and filtered through
sintered nickel, essentially no ?3°Pa activity
could be found in the salt mixture or on the filter.

In other experiments in which no salt phase was
used, solutions of ?3°Pa in molten lead or bis-
muth, obtained by the addition of irradiated
thorium metal, were not stable in either metal
solvent.  However, a much larger fraction of
233pa activity was retained in bismuth than in
lead during 48-hr contact periods. Subsequent
examination of the low-carbon-steel vessels used
in these experiments showed a distribution of
233pa on the container walls which resembled
sedimentary deposition of insoluble materials
rather than surface absorption. In view of earlier
results, tentative conclusions assumed that 233Pa
was preferentially absorbed on insoluble par-
ticles that were initially present in the molten
metals or formed by reactions with added thorium.

Since the anticipated function of the molten
metal phase in the extraction process is that of
an intermediate carrier for protactinium, the rate
at which ?33Pa can be extracted from the blanket
salt and concentrated in a second salt mixture by
back extraction with HF need only depend on the
mass transfer rate of protactinium dissolved in a
recirculating molten metal stream. Thus a pump-
loop experiment, shown schematically in Fig. 3.6,
was tried in an endeavor to achieve the transport
of 233pa in bismuth while maintaining its con-
centration or that of its carrier at relatively low
values, Thorium was introduced into the system
by contacting the liquid metal with thorium chips
just prior to its reentry into the extraction vessel.
At low bismuth flow rates protactinium could be
reduced at the surfaces of free-falling droplets.
For the recirculating molten metal
stream was pumped through a bed of steel wool
to provide for the collection of protactinium, pre-
sumably by absorption, and to provide coarse fil~
tration of the bismuth in the event that **3Pa
was being carried by suspended solid particles.
Sutrface areas of steel wool columns used in the
experiment were at least tenfold greater than
those of other iron surfaces exposed to the molten
metal elsewhere in the loop. The extraction
vessel was also provided with a niobium sleeve
to isolate the salt phase from the iron surfaces
of the loop.

The pump-loop experiment was operated dis-
continuously for approximately 60 hr over a period
of about six weeks and was terminated because
of pump failure. Material balance calculations on
the system at the conclusion of the experiment
showed that approximately 96% of the 2**Pa had
been removed from the salt mixture. At least
43% of the 2?33Pa originally in the system had
been pumped as a solution or a suspension with
molten bismuth and deposited on rather small
volumes of steel wool. Since only 4% of the
233pa remained in solution in the bismuth, ap-
proximately 49% of the #33°Pa was lost as solids
in the system. The collection of 2%7Pa on the
columns was, in fact, better identified with a
filtration process even though some surface ab-
sorption was apparent. Spectrographic analyses
of high-melting metallic plugs taken from the
system associated relatively high concentrations
of thorium with iron and chromium. These ob-
servations suggest that a more inert containment
material will be needed before a satisfactory

with helium at a rate of about 1 liter/min during
24-hr equilibration periods. Filtered samples of
the salt mixture were taken after each equilibra~
tion period and analyzed radiochemically for
233pa by counting its 310-kv photopeak on a
single-channel gamma spectrometer. At the con-
clusion of the experiment the mixture was hydro-
fluotinated to convert added ZrO_ to its fluoride
salt and to restore 233Pa activity in the molten-
salt phase. This experimental procedure was
repeated with the same salt mixture for all three
lots of Zr0,,.

In each experiment the addition of ZrO, to the
fluoride mixture resulted in the loss of protace
tinium from solution. However, as shown by Fig.
3.7, a plot of the reciprocal fraction of 233Pa
in solution vs Zr0O_ added, yielded, according to
Eq. (12), distribution coefficients for ??3Pa be-
tween the two phases which varied continuously
as the precipitation reaction approached comple-
tion.  Although these experimental results are
contrary to those obtained previously, with re-
spect to the constancy of the 233Pa distribution
coefficients, they indicate that 2?33Pa removal
from the salt mixture is probably not singularly
dependent on the surface area of the added oxide
particles nor on solid solution formation.

PROTACTINIUM STUDIES IN THE HIGH-ALPHA
MOLTEN-SALT LABORATORY

C.J. Barton  H. H. Stone

The High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory was
briefly described in the previous report,? and
results of the first experiments performed in this
facility were given. Attention has been focused
on development of methods of removing protac-
tinium at realistic concentrations (25 ppm) from
breeder blankets, but a few experiments have been
performed in an effort to obtain a better under-
standing of the chemistry of protactinium in
molten fluoride systems. Because of the variety
of experimental methods that have been applied
to the protactinium removal problem, only a brief
summary is presented here, with emphasis on the
experiments that gave the most promising resulis.
Some information from these experiments has been

Protactinium Recovery Experiments

We found that protactinium dissolved to the ex-
tent of 20 to 30 ppm in molten LiF-ThF, (73-27
mole %) could be readily reduced by solid thorium
or by thorium dissolved in lead. In the latter
case, only a small fraction of the reduced protace
tinium was found in the molten metal phase. Re-
duction experiments with solid thorium in three
different container materials (nickel, copper, and
graphite) showed that more than half the reduced
protactinium temained suspended in the molten
fluoride mixture. We believe that the reduced prot-
actinium is attached to small particles of a struc-
tural metal such as iron or nickel which are large
enough to be removed by the sintered copper filter
material through which the samples are drawn
but small enough

GRAPHITE-MOLTEN-SALT IRRADIATION
TO HIGH FiSSION DOSE

H. C. Savage E. L. Compere
J. M. Baker M. J. Kelly
E. G. Bohlmann

Irradiation of the first molten-sall convection
loop experiment in ORR beam hole HN-1 was
terminated on August 8, 1966, after development
of 1.1 x 10'® fissions/cm?® (0.27% 235U burnup)
in the ‘LiF-BeF -ZiF ~UF  (65.16-28.57-4.90-
1.36 mole %) fuel. Average fuel power densities
up to 105 w per cubic centimeter of salt were
attained in the fuel channels of the core of MSRE-
grade graphite.

Successful operation of the major heating,
cooling, temperature-control, and sampling sys-
tems was demonstrated; however, leaks developed
in two of the four cooling systems. The experi-
ment was terminated after radioactivity, resulting
from fuel leakage from a break in the sample line
near the loop, was detected in the secondary
containment.

Irradiation of a second loop, modified to elimi-
nate causes of failures encountered in the first,
will begin in January 1967. Operation at an
average core fuel power density of 200 w/cm?
for a period of the order of a year will be sought.

Objectives and Description

The loop is designed to irradiate a representa-
tive molten-salt fuel circulating at typical tem-
perature differences in contact with graphite and
Hastelloy N at desired core power densities of
200 w/cm?, with provisions for gas removal and
salt sampling. In particular, it is desired to

41

study the interaction of fission products with
graphite, metal, fuel, and gas phases and the
stability of the fuel salt at high levels of burn-
up. L1417

The core of the first loop consisted of a 2«in.-
diam by 6-in.-long cylinder of graphite obtained
from MSRE stock. Through the core, eight vertical
1/4—ir1. holes for salt flow were bored, arranged
octagonally with centers S/8 in. from the graphite
center line, A horizontal gas separation tank
connected the top of the core to a return line to
the core bottom, completing the loop. The tank,
lines, and the core shell were fabricated of Has-
telloy N. The heaters and the cooling tubes in the
core and return line were embedded in sprayed-on
nickel, as was the 12-ft sample tube leading from
the loop to the sample station in the external
equipment chamber.

Operations. — The loop was operated with MSRE
solvent salt for 187 hr at Y-12, and several salt
samples were taken. [t was inserted in beam
hole HN-1 of the ORR on June 9. 1966, and
operated 1100 hr with solvent salt; during this
period calibration and testing of equipment and
performance were conducted. The loop was in-
serted to the position nearest the reactor lattice
on July 21, and water injection into the air
streams to the tubular core coolers and the jacket
around the gas separation tank was tested. One
of the two core coolers leaked and was plugged
off. Water injection was discontinued until after
uranium addition.

On July 27, after sampling, eutectic 7LiF-‘»UF4
(93% enriched) fuel salt was added to develop a
uranium inventory concentration of 1.36 mole %.
At this time a capillary tube in the sample re-
moval system broke, precluding further sampling.
An associated inleakage of air impelled solvent
salt to a cold spot in the gas sample line, thereby
plugging it.

During subsequent operation fission heat was
determined.  During this period water was re-
leased into the loop container from what proved

hot cells for disassembly and examination on

Chemicol Analysis of Salt. — Samples of solvent
salt taken prior to irradiation and after 1100 hr
in pile and of irradiated fuel salt obtained after
dismantling were analyzed chemically and radio-
chemically. A sample of salt found between the
metal core shell and the graphite was also
analyzed. Results are given in Tabhle 3.2 and
are discussed below.

radioactivity
indicated fuel leakage.

Corrasion. — The level of corrosion products,
particularly chromium and nickel, in the salt
increased in the successive samples. This was

possibly due to uptake of moisture by the solvent
salt prior to loading, with consequent corrosion
of the Hastelloy N. This appears to have occurred
in the addition tank, since a sample taken directly
from the addition tank without entering the loop
showed similar levels of corrosion products.

Producis. - Fission products were
counted in a fuel sample after 110 days’ cooling;
concentrations are given below as a percentage
of the amount produced, calculated on the basis
of observed fission heat (4.8 x 10!7 fissions/g).

Cerium-144 and -141 (77, 64%) and zirconium-89
(65%) were somewhat below the calculated pro-
duction. Cesium-137 (41%) and strontium-89 (42%),
with noble-gas precursors of ~3 min half-life,
could have thereby been lost to the gas space
or graphite voids. Tellurium-127 (10%) was
largely removed from the salt. Ruthenium-103
and -106, which were expected to deposit on
Hastelloy N surfaces, were not detected (<0.03%)
in the salt.

Nuclear Heat and Meuvtron Flux, — Nuclear heat
was measured at various loop insertion positions
by comparing electrical heat requirements under
similar conditions with the reactor at zero and
full power. Reactor gamma heat fully inserted
was 2900 w (with unfueled salt). With fuel con-
% wuranium (93% enriched),
fission heat in the fully inserted position was

HoteCall Examination of Components. - After
separation from other parts of the package, the
loop proper was kept for about three months in
a furnace at 300°C to prevent fluorine evolution
by fission product radiolysis of the salt. At this
it was removed for detailed examination.

The type 304 stainless steel tubular core cooler
was found to have broken entirely loose without
ductility at its outlet end as it left the core near
a tack weld to the corc shell. Intergranular cracks
originated on the outer circumference of the coiled
tube.

The cooling jacket on the gas separation tank
leaked at a weld. The fuel leak resulted from
a nonductile break in the Hastelloy N sample line
tubing near the attachment to the core bottom.
The sprayed nickel was also cracked in this
regioii.

Fuel salt in the form of a scale a few mils
thick was found on the interior of the core shell,

time

between it and the closely fitting graphite core.
The analysis shown in Table 3.2 appeaws to be a
mixture of fuel salt and Hastelloy N (probably
metal debris from cutup operation).

Hot-cell metallurgical examination of the in-
terior surfaces of the Hastelloy N comprising the
core bottom and core shell wall showed no evi-
dence of any interaction with salt or carbon, or
other change.

the loss described earlier of one of the two
cooling coils around the loop core section. The
air plus water-injection technique appears ade-
quate and responsive. The use of water injection
was not necessarily the cause of failure of the
two cooling units, but only made the failures
evident.

Temperature Control. — The response of the
heating and cooling systems to rapid changes in
the nuclear heat could only be tested under full
fission conditions in pile. Since this was re-
garded as important, reactor setback tests were
conducted. Temperature-control system response
was adequate to maintain the salt molten during
a reactor setback with resultant loss of 8.8 kw
of nuclear heat, and to return the loop to normal
operating condition during a rapid (11-min) return
to full power.

Sampling ond Addition. -- Sampling and addition
systems and procedures were adequate to permit
addition and removal of molten salt while operating
the loop in pile and to transport shielded samples
under an inert-gas atmosphere to the analytical
laboratory. A broken capillary connecting tube
prevented additional sampling.

Salt Circulation. — Convective salt circulation,
at rates of 5 to 10 cm?®/min, was achieved by
causing the return line to operate at temperatures
below the core temperature. Flow stoppages
These were attributed
to bubble formation resulting from different solu-

bility of argon cover gas at the varied tempera-
tures around the loop. Salt flow was reestablished

by evacuation and readdition of cover gas. Loss
of flow had no adverse effect on loop operation.
Second In-Fiie lrradiation Assembly. — A second

in-pile molten-salt convection loop, essentially
identical to the first convection loop experi-
ment,!® has been constructed, and it is antici-
pated that in-pile irradiation will begin early in
1967. Problems encountered
vection loop experiment and subsequent post-
irradiation hot-cell examination, described above,
have led to modifications to the second loop
which are designed to eliminate these problems.

The coolant tubes, embedded in nickel spray
Y=in.~00) x
0.035-in,~wall Incone!l tubing instead of the z-m.-

OD x 0.035-in.~wall 304 stainless steel used on

in the first con-

around the core section, are now of

44

the first loop. The stainless steel tubing should
have been entirely adequate for the service, but
Inconel is the preferred material for exposure to
the high-temperature steam (™~400°C) genecrated
when air-water mixtures are used as coolant.
Since the rupture of one of the core coolant
tubes occurred adjacent to a point where the
tube was tack welded to the core wall, the tack
weld was eliminated in favor of a mechanical
strap attachment. An expansion loop to relieve
stresses has been included in each of the coolant
outlet lines. A mockup of the modified cooling
coil was operated at temperature with air-water
mixtures for more thaa 400 hr, including 120
thermal shock cycles (600 - 350°C), with no
sign of difficulty. Thermal! cycling occurs during
a reactor setback and startup, and it is estimated
that no more than about 20 such thermal cycles
will occur during a vear of operation.

The two failures which occurred in the capillary
tubing (0.100 in. OD x 0.050 in. ID) used in the
salt transfer system appear to have resulted from
excessive mechanical stress. Consequently, the
wall thickness of this line has been increased to
0.050 in., and additional mechanical support has
been added such that there is now no part of the
salt sample line which is unsuppoited —~ as was
the case in the first loop assembly.

The Y -in.-thick stainless steel cooling jacket
surrounding the reservoir tank has been replaced
by an Incone! tube wrapped around the outside
of the tank and attached by means of sprayed-on
nickel metal, as is done on the core section and
cold leg. Also, provisions for use of an air-water
mixture as coolant have been added, since it was
found that air alone did not provide sufficient
cooling in the first experiment.

Continuous salt circulation by thermal cone-
vection was not maintained in the first experi-
ment. It was concluded that loss of circulation
was caused by gas accumulation in the top of
the core section. Accordingly, the salt flow
channels at the top and bottom of the eight ' -in.
holes for salt tflow in the graphite core were re-
designed to provide better flow conditions!’ at
the inlets and exits of the vertical holes. [Fur-
ther, the top and bottom of the core section,
horizontally oriented on the first loop, were in-
clined at 5°to minimize trapping of gas.

EXTENT OF UF ; REDUCTION DURING
MSRE FUEL PREPARATION

B. F. Hitch C. F. Baes, Jr.
Uranium was added to the barren fuel salt of
the MSRE as a binary mixture of 27 mole % UF,
in ’LiF. ‘This fuel concentrate had first been
purified by the usual sparging with an HF-H,
mixture to remove oxide, followed by sparging with
hydrogen alone to complete the reduction of struc-
tural metal fluorides such as NiF, and Fef . !'?
During this final reduction step, a small portion
of the UF, should also have been reduced, the
amount depending upon the duration of the treat-
ment and the equilibrium constant for the reaction

UF (d) + LH, (g) = UF (d)+ HF(g).

The exact amount of UF | thus introduced into the
MSRE fuel has become a matter of special interest
with continued operation of the MSRE, owing to
evidence that significant amounts of some fis-
sion products are far more oxidized (see following
section) than would seem compatible with the
presence of significant amounts of UF, in the
MSRE fuel. Consequently, the data collected by
Shaffer et al.® during the purification of the fuel
salt concentrate at the production facility recently
have been examined in detail in an attempt to de-
termine the equilibrium quotient for the above re-
action,

1/‘0311? = 0, the average amount of uranium re-
duction at the end of the hydrogen treatment was
estimated to be 0.16%.

In an attempt to confirm this estimate of @ and
the amount of reduced uranium present initially
in the MSRE fuel, an 11.4-kg portion of unused
fuel concentrate was studied further in the lab-
oratory. Hydrogen sparging was initiated at 510°C.
At this relatively low temperature, no sigpnificant
reduction of U*" to U3% should occur; however,
HF evolution was detected immediately and con-
tinued at a significant leve! until 250 liters of H,
had been passed and 0.0019 mole of HF per mole
of uranium had been evolved. This indicated that
inadvertent exposure of the salt to oxidizing im-
purities such as water or oxygen had occurred
during prior storage, during transfer of the sam-
ple to the reaction vessel, or in later handling.
Since the HF at this temperature in the amounts
seen should have quickly oxidized the UF ; pres-
ent, it was not possible to confirm the amount
of UF, initially present in the fuel concentrate.
In two subsequent H, sparging runs at 700°C,

however, data were obtained which permitted im-

proved estimates of Q from plots of 1/ vs V:

Run 2 705 35 1.85% 107°

The resulting values of Q are about twice those
estimated from the salt production data. It is
not reasonable to attribute this discrepancy en-
tirely to the differences in temperature, since,
judging from Long’s measurements of the tempera-
ture dependence of Q in LiF-BeF, melts,® more
than a 30°C difference would be required. It seems
more likely that the discrepancy is due partly to
nonequilibrinin sparging conditions in the produc-
tion treatment. The present value of Q = 1.8 x 10~¢
atm !/ 2 determined for the fuel concentrate is some-
what lower than the value ~4 x 107% atm!/?
which may be estimated for the MSRE fuel salt
at 700°C from Long’s measurements. This in-
dicates that UF_ is not as easily reduced in the
fuel concentrate as in the fuel salt.

have prevailed during purification of the fue! con-

estimate, since, in effect, it is based upon the
integrated amount of HF evolved by reduction,
which, in turn, is related by material balance to
the amount of UF ; formed.

CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF FLUORIDES
DURING MSRE OPERATION

R. E. Thoma

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment operated
during six separate periods in 1966; virtually all
of the operating time accumulated after mid-May
was at the maximum possible power of about 7.5
Mw. The reactor accumulated approximately 11,200
Mwirr during the year.

During periods of reactor operation, samples of
the reactor salts were removed routinely and were
analyzed for major constituents, corrosion piroducts,
and (less frequently) oxide contamination. Stand-
ard samples of fuel are drawa three times per
week: the LiF-Bel”
two weeks.

, coolant salt is sampled every

Current chemical analyses suggest no percep-
tible composition changes for the salts since they
were first introduced into the reactor some 20
months ago. ©

While analyses for ZrF , and for UF, agree quite
well with the material balance on quantities charged
to the reactor tanks, "LiF and
Bel ) have never done so; analyses for LiF have
shown higher and for BeF, have shown lower
values than the book value since startup. Table 4.1

shows a comparison of current analysis with the
original inventory value. While the discrepancy
in LiF and BeF , concentration remains a puzzle,
there is nothing in the analysis (or in the be-
havior of the reactor) to suggest that any changes
have occurted. The burnup of uraninm totaling
some 0.3 kg out of 230 kg in the systemn should
be perceptible (and does not seem to be) within
the experimental scatter. A chronological sum-
marv of all MSRE fuel salt analyses is shown in

able scatter in these analyses, there seems to
be no indication of corrosion of the Hastelloy N
by the salt.

The fuel mixture in the MSRE contained (see
preceding section) considerably less UF . than
the quantity intended; 1.5% of the added uranium
was to be as U?’. Furthemmore, the fission proc-
ess should prove oxidizing to UF, in the melt”
(or to chromium in the Hastelloy N). The extent
to which the fission process should prove oxi-
dizing depends on several variables including (1)
the extent to which Kr and Xe are swept from the
reactor, (2) the redox potential of the fuel-metal
system, and (3) the extent to which evolution of
“unstable’ species (such as MoF , or RuF ) oc-
curs through nonequilibrium behavior. It
very likely, however, that fission of about 0.3 kg
of uranium (perhaps aided by a small amount of
inadvertent oxidation within the MSRE) can have
used up most of the UF, added. An attempt to
determine UI"; concentration in the MSRE after
about 11,000 Mwhr of operation (by H,-HF equi-
[ibrium, a method similar to that employed in the
preceding section) showed less than 0.10% of the
uranium to be in the trivalent state.?

Accordingly, the lack of corrosion in the MSRE
seems to be somewhat surprising.
tionalized by the assumption (1) that the Hastelloy
N has been depleted in Cr (and Fe) at the surface
so that Mo and Ni only are under attack, with Cr
(and Fe) reacting only at the slow rate at which
it is furnished to the surface by diffusion, or (2)
that the noble-metal fission products (see section
on Fission Products on Metal and Graphite from
MSRE Corte) are forming an adherent and protective
plate on the reactor metal,

Though neither of the analyses nor the reactor
behavior suggests appreciable corrosion, plans are
under way, and techniques are being studied, for
reducing about 1% of the MSRE UF , to UF ; within
the reactor. Such a reduction (which would surely
take the MSRE fuel to near its intended UF, con-
centration) should remove all apprehension about
possible corrosion and should, we believe, allevi-
ate some of the problems of volatile fission product
fluorides (see subsequent sections).

Routine determinations of oxide (by study of
salt—~H,O-HF equilibria) continue to show low
values (about 50 ppm) for 02—, There is no reason
to believe that contamination of the fuel has been
significant in operations to the preseunt.

MSRE maintenance operations have necessitated
flushing the interior of the drained rcactor circuit
on four occasions. The salt used for this oper-
ation consisted originally of an 7LiF-BeF2 (66.0-
34.0 mole %) mixture. Analysis of this salt before
and after each use shows that 215 ppm of uranium
is added to the flush salt in each flushing oper-
ation, corresponding to the removal of 22.7 kg of

Typical results obtained for these materials are
shown in the table.

The strontium and cerium isotopes are of special
interest as fission monitors since they have con-
venient half-lives and stable, nonvolatile fluorides
which would be expected to remain almost com-
pletely in the circulating fuel. The concentration
of these monitors, however, is in only fair agree-
ment with calculations based on power level of
the reactor from heat balance; fission power based
on 2'8r is 75% of nominal power, while that based
on '%3Ce shows 88% of normal reactor power.

Molybdenum and ruthenium are typical of a class
of metals expected to deposit, at least in part,
as elements. These analyses of the salt show
that these materials are present in less than the
expected concentration; if calculations of total
yield are based on ?!Sr, about 60% of the “*Mo
and about 30% of the '"%Ru are accounted for in
the salt. It is not possible to decide whether
these isotopes are present as colloidal particles
or are soluble chemical species.

Isotopes of tellurium and iodine are of interest
as xenon precursors and as elements which might
show appreciable volatility from the melt. Only
about 30% of the !%?Te appears in the salt, but
the expected quantities (90 to 100%) of the iodine
isotopes were found in the salt samples.

Analyses of the MSRE fuel samples do not,
therefore, seem surprising except for the low con-
centration of 13?Te. Examination of graphite and
metal samples and, especially, of specimens from
the vapor phase as described in subsequent sec-
tions do show several surprises.

Equilibrium Pressures of Noble-Metal Fluorides
Under MSRE Conditions

C. F. Baes, ]Jr.

As the following sections of this document de-
scribe in brief, volatile species of Mo, Te, Ru,
and (probably) Nb have been found in the helium
cover gas of the MSRE. In addition, sizable
fractions of these elements appear (presumably
as metal) on the metallic surfaces of the reactor.
Their unexpected behavior prompted a review of
the thermodynamic data on the volatile fluorides
of these elements and an assessment of their

49

equilibrium pressures under
MSRE conditions.

The formation free energies for NbF ., MoF,
and UF , may be calculated with relatively good
accuracy because of recent measurements at Air-
gonne of the heats of formation of these com-
pounds by fluorine bomb calorimetry. 1% The
entropies and heat capacity data also are avail-
able. 13 While the people at Argonne have meas-
ured RuF_,'* no entropy or heat capacity data
seem to be available:

From these wvalues and the available heat ca-

derived. In the case of RuF , Glassner’s'’ ear-
lier estimate was corrected to be consistent with
the above AHf measurement:
AG!H (NBF _, g) = —416.70 + 54.40(T/1000) ,
AGH (RuF , g) = —200 + 25 (7/1000) ,
AG! (MoF _, ) = ~370.99 + 69.7(7/1000) ,

melt is increased, NbF . is expected to appear
first, followed by MoF ., and then RukF .. Uranium
hexafluoride has a lower dependence on oxidizing
power because its reduction product is UF , rather
than the metal. It was assumed in the case of
NbF ., MoF , and Ruk  that the reduction product
was the metal. The UK should not be formed
in significant amounts until the melt is oxidizing
enough to produce RuF,. If any stable inter-
mediate fluorides of Nb, Mo, and Ru are formed
in the melt, the result would be correspondingly
lowered equilibrium gas pressures and lowered
power dependences on the UF /UF ; ratio.

Anolysis for Fission Products in MSRE Exit Gas

S. S. Kirslis F. . Blankenship

The only gas-liquid interface in the MSRE (ex-
cept for the contact between liquid and the gas-
filled pores of the moderator graphite) exists in
the pump bowl. There a salt flow of about 60 gpm
(5% of the total system flow) contacts a helium
cover gas which flows through the bowl at 4
liters/min. Provisions for direct sampling of this
exit gas are planned but have not yet been in-
stalled in the MSRE.

Samples of the liquid fuel are obtained by low-
ering a sampler, on a stainless steel cable, through
this cover gas and into the liquid. It has been
possible, accordingly, to detect chemically active
fission product species in this cover gas by ra-
diochemical analysis of the stainless steel cable
and its accessories which contact only the gas
phase and by analysis of special getter materials
which are attached to the cable. Coils of silver
wire and specimens of Hastelloy N have generally
been used as getters for this puipose.

No quantitative measure of the isotopes present
in the gas phase is possible, since no good es-
timate can be made of the gas volume sampled.
The quantity of material deposited on the wire
specimen does not correlate’ well with contact
time (in the range 1 to 10 min) or with the gstter
materials studied.

The quantity of material deposited, however,
is relatively large. Table 4.3 indicates relative

amounts found in typical tests. Volatile species
of Mo, Te, and Ru must certainly be presumed
to exist in the gas phase. The iodine isotopes
show perceptibly different behavior. Jodine-135,
whose tellurium precursor has a short half-life,
does not appear, while '3[ and 133 both of
which have tellurium precursors of appreciable
half-life, are found. These findings — along with
the fact that these iodine isotopes are present
in the salt at near their expected concentration —
suggest that any iodine in the vapor phase comes
as a result of volatilization of the tellurium pre-
CUursors.

Attempts to detect deposition of uranium (from
evolution of UFﬁ) on the wites have so far been
unsuccessful. This fact — along with the failure
to find many of the fission products which have
no volatile compounds — rules out the possibility
that salt spray is responsible for these obser-
vations.

It seems most unlikely that these data can be
reconciled as equilibrium behavior of the volatile
fluorides. Tt is possible that the MSRE metal is
plated with a noble-metal alloy whose thickness
is several hundred angstroms, and it is conceiv-
able that the UF /UF, ratio is near 10*. The
compound NbF_ (not tested for in the gas phase)
could show an appreciable pressure under these
circumstances, The other possibilities such as

MoF ., TeF , and RuF would require much higher

51

UF /UF, ratios, and it seems most unlikely that
any single redox potential can yield the relative
abundance observed for these isotopes.

The following speculation may be televant: As
the fission products, which originate in highly
electron-deficient states, thermalize and acquire
electrons in the melt, they pass through these
“unstable’” but volatile valence conditions. If
the plated reactor metal is sufficiently unreactive
and if (as it seems to be at present) the MSRE
fuel is quite deficient in UF ,, it is conceivable
that some fraction of these materials might ap-
pear in the gas phase and enter the MSRE graphite
or leave the system in the exit gas. If this is
true, then a considerable increase in UF, con-
centration in MSRE fuel might well markedly de-
crease the fraction in the vapor phase. It is
cleat that additional study will be required before
the situation becomes clear.

FISSION PRODUCTS ON METAL
AND GRAPHITE FROM MSRE CORE

S. S. Kirslis F. F. Blankenship

An assembly of MSRE graphite and Hastelloy N
specimens was exposed on the central stringer
within the MSRE core during its initial operation.
This assembly was removed during the July 17
shutdown after 7800 Mwhr of reactor operation,
and many specimens have been carefully examined.

No evidence of alteration of the graphite was
found under examination by visual, x~radiographic,
and metallographic examination. Autoradiographs
showed that penetration of radioactive materials
into the pgraphite was not uniform and disclosed
a thin (perhaps 1- to 2-mil) layer of highly radio-
active materials on or pear the exposed graphite
surfaces. Examination of the metal specimen
showed no evidence of corrosion or other danger.

Rectangular bars of graphite from the top (out-
let), middle, and bottom (inlet) region of this
central stringer were milled in the hot cell to
temove six successive layers from each surface.
The removed layers were then analyzed for sev-
eral fission product isotopes, 17

The results of analysis of the outer layer from
the graphite specimen are shown in Table 4.4,

 

17The initial sampling was carried out by J. G. Morgan,
M. F., Osbome, and H. E. Robertson. ‘Their help and
that of the Hot-Cell Operation Group is gratefully ac-
knowledged.

It is clear that, with the assumption of uniform
deposition on or in all the moderator graphite,
appreciable fractions of Mo, Te, and Ru and a
large fraction of the Nb are associated with the
graphite. No analyses for Tc have been obtained.
The concentrations of these noble metals would
be sufficient to exert significant poisoning in a
breeder reactor.

The behavior of '#°Ba, 8%Sr, '41Ce, '**(Ce, and
137Cg, all of which have xenon or krypton precur-
sors, can be accounted for in terms of laws of dif-
fusion and half-lives of the precursors. Figure 4.3
shows the change in concentration of the fission
product isotope with depth in the graphite. Those
isotopes (such as !'49Ba) which penetrated the
graphite as noble gases show straight lines on the
logarithmic plot; they seem to have remained at
the point where the noble gas decayed. As ex-
pected, the gradient for '*%Ba with a 16-sec '*%Xe
precursor is much steeper than that for #9Sr, which
has a 3.2-min 89Kr precursor. All the others shown

show a much steeper concentration dependence.
Generally the concentration drops a factor of 100
from the top 6 to 10 mils to the second layer.

It is possible that carbide formation is respon-
sible for the deposition of Nb and possibly for -
that of Mo, but it seems quite uanlikely for Ru and
Te; the icdine probably got in as its tellurium pre-
cursor. Since these materials have been shown
to appear in the exit gas as volatile species, it
seems likely that they entered the graphite by
the same mechanism. The possibility that the
strongly oxidizing fluorides such as MoF
present raised the question as to whether Uk’
was accumulating in the graphite. An average
of 0.23 ug/cm? was found in the surface of the

were

graphite; much less was present in interior sam-
ples. This amount of uranium, equivalent to less
than 1 g in the core, was considered to be neg-
ligible.

Table 4.5 shows the extent to which various
fission product isotopes are deposited on the

cursor. The values for ?5Zr seem surprisingly
high, since those for the !'?iCe and '*%Ce with
noble-gas precursors probably reflect the amount
expected by direct recoil at the moment of fission.

If the Nb and Tc are assumed to behave like
the Mo, Te, and Ru, it may be noted that the MSRE
could have been uniformly plated during its oper-
ation with several hundred angstroms of relatively
noble metals.

xenon diffusion and the behavior of daughter ce-
sium born in the moderator graphite of an MSBR
operating under such conditions. A one-dimen-
sional steady-state diffusion model was assumed
in which the moderator was represented as a slab
of graphite infinite in two dimensions, with a
thickness of 1 cm, immersed in the fuel salt.
It was further assumed that all cesium bomn in
the graphite was in the elemental (gasecus) form.
The parameters varied were: (1) the diffusion
coefficients D of xenon and cesium in the graphite
(assumed to be equal), (2) the {ilm coefficient H
associated with the salt-graphite interface, and
(3) the rate at which gas is stripped from the
fuel, r\ST.

Over the range chosen for these parameters,
the rate step in the diffusion of xenon into the
graphite was found to be at the salt-graphite in-
terface and was dependent on the value of X
(Fig. 4.4). As a consequence, a decrease in D
did not materially decrease the inward diffusion
of xenon;, however, it did decrease the rate at
which gaseous cesium diffused to the graphite
surface, where

Thus, somewhat paradoxically, the maximum par-

Under all combinations of [, D, and /\ST values
chosen, the calculated cesium partial pressure
at steady state was high enough to cause the

However, the calculated accumulation rate of Cs
was s0 low that the amounts of CsC_ which could
be formed did not appear to he significant.

Finally, these calculations indicate that in the
absence of iodine removal (i.e., 6.7-hr 135I), Xe
poisoning in a full-scale MSBR will be controlled
primarily by the film coefficient H (Fig. 4.4) and
will be difficult to reduce tc an acceptable value
by gas stripping alone. It could be reduced more
effectively either by iodine removal or by some
means which effectively reduces the film coef-
ticient.

" Poison conticl solutions of CdSO, are being
considered by NASA Lewis Research Center for
possible use in the NASA Tungsten Water-Moderated
Reactor (TWMR). Information regarding the effects
of irradiation on the stability of these solutions

this poison control system, 1+?

We have conducted experimental investigations?
of the stability of CdSO, solution under electron
irradiation using the following experimental con-
ditions:

The container was in the form of a loop of 26-

end, The solution was exposed within the tubing
for a period of time and then expelied through the
filter; the expelled solution was analyzed for Cd.

Small amcounts of Cd were lost from the solution
during 30-min irradiations at each tested combina-
tion of the above set of conditions. With 0.02 ¥
CdSO, solutions, the loss at 120°C and 145 w/cm3
was 5.0 + 3.4% error at 80% confidence. The loss
at 77°C was 3.3 + 2.8% and that at 77°C and 73
w/cm?® was 2.0 £ 2.7%. One experiment with 0.02
M CdSO, and H,S50,, pH 2, indicated negligible
loss.

With 0.06 M CdSO,, the loss at 60°C and 145
w/cm?® was 1.5 + 1.0%. At 120°C, the best indica-
tion was about 4% loss. The results of experi-
ments with 5- and 50-min irradiations of 0.067 M
CdSO4 at 60°C and 145 w/em? indicated that the
amount of Cd lost was greatest at the longer time.

Experimental information on recovery of the
separated Cd after irradiation indicated that the
rates of redissolution are slow.

Considerations of these results and of theory
suggest that Cd metal is formed under irradiation
and that this separates as relatively insoluble
material by agglomeration or by plating on solid
surfaces.,  Additional experimental investigation
of effects of agitation and of surface-area~to-
volume ratics would be required to predict the ef-
fects of radiation on stability in a reactor in
which these parameters differ from those in our
experiments,

Design and development work was done on a
system which could be used to study effects of
electron irradiation on stability in a dynamic
system.”  The planned dynamic experiment was
to be conducted with a small, high-speed (35,000
rpm) ceantrifugal pump with which solution was to
be circulated through a 26-mil-ID tube forming

1/(X + 6a) for large X. This value of the activa-
tion distance seems to be quite reasonable. We
conclude that this model is capable of describing
the anodic film growth process in zirconium over
a wide range of electrode potentials and film thick-
nesses with satisfactory accuracy by use of reason-
able values of pliysical parameters.

AC IMPEDANCE OF OXIDE FILMS IN AQUEOUS
SOLUTIONS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

G. H. Jenks R. J. Davis
A. L., Bacarella H. 8. Gadiyar!®

We are in the process of developing equipment,
methods, and techniques which will permit us to
measure the ac impedance of corrosion films on
zirconium and its alloys in aqueous solutions
at elevated temperatures. The immediate objec-
tive of these measurements is to determine whether
pores or fissures which admit aqueous solutions
occur in these films during corrosion at tempera-
tures up to about 300°C. If these determinations
can be made satisfactorily, we will then attempt
to conduct similar experiments in-pile. It is ex-
pected that valuable information on the electrical
properties of the high-temperature corrosion films
will be obtained also during the course of the
me asurements.

In the method employed, the specimen is im-
mersed in an electrolyte which, together with the
metal container, comprises one electrode for im-
pedance measurements of the oxide film on the
specimen. The metal of the specimen is the second
electrode., Measurements are made of the capaci-
tance and resistance of the oxide over a range of
frequencies: and at two or more electrolyte concen-
trations, The results are examined for behavior
expected to result from penetration of the electro-
lyte into fissures within the oxide.

The principles upon which this method of pore
detection is based were discussed by Young.??®
Wanklyn and co-workers?% 27 have used ac im-
pedance measurements at room temperature in
studies of the protective and electrical properties
of oxide films formed on zirconium alloys during
high-temperature corrosion.

Our measurements to date have covered a tem-
perature range of 25 to 200°C and have been made
on a single zirconium specimen bearing a 1500-A
film formed anodically (0.0 v vs Pt at 55°C) in
oxygenated 0.05 m H, S0, at 220 to 230°C in the

The slopes of these straight lines are listed in

Young derived these equations by emwploying a
mode! in which the resistivity, p, varies exponen-
tially with distance through the oxide, The re-
sistivities at the opposite surfaces of the oxide
of thickness d are p(0) and p(d) respectively; € is
the dielectric constant and A is the area. These
equations reproduced Young’s experimental re-
sults for anodic films on Nb with respect to straignt-
line formation in plots of 1/C_ vs log f and of R_
vs 1/f and with respect to the rclationship between
the slopes of the 1/C_ and R plots.?® The fre-
quency dependencies of C_ and R_ observed by
otherz for anedic and corrosion films on Zr have
beern ascribed to conductivity gradients thiough
the oxide.?”

Values of p(d) and p(0) determined from our
capacitance data employing Eq. (V) are listed in

R_ plots varied between 8.3 and 9.7. A value of
9.2 is predicted by Egs. (7) and (8).

Qur tentative conclusions are that the observed
frequency, temperature, and electrolyte dependence
of the impedance components can be reasonably
ascribed to resistivity gradients through the oxide
and to changes, with temperature and with electro-
lyte, of the resistivity of the layers of oxide in
contact with the electrolyte. There is no evidence
for fissures which admit electrolyte into the oxide.
Additional work is needed to confirm these con-
clusions and to permit more complete explanations
of the impedance behavior,

are given below. Results concerning the corrosion
of the aluminum-clad HFIR fuel elements have

here.

The HFIR, which is presently operating at the
design power of 100 Mw, uses water adjusted to a
pH of 5.0 with nitric acid as coolant; all tests
were conducted in this environment at 100°C.
Aluminum alloys (6061, 1100, and X-8001) cor-
roded at rates of 0.2 mil/year or less at all flow
Contacting aluminum with
aluminum, nickel, or stainless steel
resulted in pitting of the aluminum in contact
areas only. The pits were of appreciable depth,
but they were randoinly spread and should not be
of major consequence in the HFIR system. At
velocities of 13 to 81 fps, beryllium corroded at
a constant rate of 2 mils/year and showed only =
slight tendency to pit. Corrosion damage to the
beryllium reflector in the HFIR should be negligibly
small.  Both nickel and electroless nickel de-
posits corroded excessively in the acidified water
and are not usable in the HFIR. ¥Electrolyzed

terials with chromium) on stainless steel exhibited

cooled production and research reactors were fully
used in the design of the HFIR. Assuming ade-
quate control of the water chemistry, the HEFIR
should be free of major corrosion problems.

The primary areas of concern in the AARR were
the beryllium reflector, the 5061-T6 aluminum
beam tubes, and the stainless steel fuel element
cladding. All tests were conducted in deicnized
water at 93°C (200°F). The results indicated
that the corrosion rate of the bLeryllium reflector
in the AARR will be between 1 and 3 mils/year
with a minimum of localized attack.

The coriosion of 6061-T6 aluminum
results in the formation of an insulating layer of
corrosion products on the surface. Since heat
generated in the beam tubes must be transferred
across this insulating laver, the coriosion rate
of aluminum wmust be minimized to prevent exces-

ing system would have to be capable of keeping
the temperature at the aluminum-water interface
at 200°F or less if frequent replacement of beam
tubes was to be avoided.

There is relatively little information available
on the properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions
at superciitical temperatures and pressures. The
simplest and most direct method f{or obtaining
information about the existence and behavior of
ions in these solutions is to measure their electri-
cal conductances, By using this method, we have
studied aqueous solutions of K,50,, KHSO,, and
H,50, to 300°C and to 4000 bars; from these
measurements we have calculated [lirst and second

tions.?  The experimental data were evaluated
with the usual theoretical equations that describe
equivalent conductance as a function of concentra-
tion. By using a digital computer to fit the data
to the equations by nonlinear least-squares methods,
limiting equivalent conductances were calculated
at integral temperatures (0 to 800°C) and densities
(0.4 to 1.0 g/em?®). These values are shown

conductances are plotted as a function of density.
This graph indicates that the limiting eguivalent
conductance of NaCl is a linear function of scolu-
tion density (at constant temperature)., Figure
6.1 also reveals that at tempervatures of 400°C
and above, the limiting equivalent conductance of
NaCl appears to be independent of temperature
(at constant density).  Although the values at
800 are slightly helow the 400 to Y00°C values,
this difference is mostly a consequence of in-
creasing ion-pair formation at higher temperatures.
As NaCl becomes a weaker electrolyte, the extrap-
olated limiting equivalent conductances become
somewhat uncertain and tend to fall below their
true values, These solutions showed this behavior
al densities below 0.4 g/cm® and at temperatures
above 700°C., Disscciation constants for ion-pair
formation in Na(Cl sclutions were calculated from
the Shedlovsky equation® at densities from 0.3
to 0.75 g/cm?® and temperatures from 400 to 800°C.

KCl solution of this concentration appears to be
the logical choice as a reference for conductance
measurements at elevated temperatures and pres-
sures, since it is used as a standard solution for
cell constant determinations at 25°C. Accordingly,

DISSOCIATION CONSTANT OF CALCIUM
SULFATE TO 350°C OBTAINED FROM
SOLUBILITY BEMAYIOR IN MIXED
ELECTROLYTES®

L. B. Yeatts W. L. Marshall

The dissociation quotients, Qd’ for CaSO4° were
determined from extensive solubility measurements
of calcium sulfate (or the dihydrate at 25°) in an
aqueous system of mixed electiolytes, varying from
pure NaNO_ to pure Na SO, when possible. Mea-
surements were made at several constant ionic
strengths from 0.25 to 6 m at 25, 150, 250, and
350°C.

When solid calcium sulfate dissolves in aqueous
solutions, it may be assumed that an equilibrium
is reached with undissociated molecules:

CaS0 ,(5)==>CaS0,%aq) , (9)
which at saturation can be expressed by

Q, =[Cas0,°] (molal units) . (10)
The neutral species can be considered also to
undergo partial dissociation:

CaS0,°(aq)=>Ca’"(aq) + 80,7 (aq) , (11)

in which case the equilibrium gquotient expression
is
Q,=Ica™[s0,271/Cas0,"] (molal units) .  (12)
The solubility product quotient in this study was
then defined as

0., =[ca® 50,271 0,0, . (13)
With these assumptions, the molal solubility of

calcium sulfate, s, at various ionic strengths and
temperatures can be expressed by

s [Cas0 °l+ [ca®]. (14)
Since
[ca®*] -0, /150,%7] (15)
and
[$0,27] = total sulfate — {CaSO,°]
=[s0,],, ~ [Cas0,°},  (16)
then
s =[Cas0,%1+ Q_ /(50,1 ,, ~ [CaSO %) . (A7)

A plot of values of s vs 1/([3()4](0 — [CaSOf]),
with the assumption of constancy (or near con-
stancy) of activity coefficients at constant ionic
strength, should yield a straight line of slope 94,
and intercept [CaSO4°]. The results obtained at
25°C at constant ionic strengths of 0.25, 0.5, 1,
2, and 6 m, at 150°C at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 6 m, at

This study of the solubility of Fe O, in HCI
solutions is being carried out because Fe O, is
steel -water

a coriosion product of the systems

used in pressurized-water reactors. Measurements
previously reported?? have been extended in tem-
perature and in HC! concentration.

The method used was essentially the same as
before. An HCI solution in a reservoir of Pyrex
glass was equilibrated at room temperature with

H, at a pressure of 1.0 atm. Then it was pumped

through a pressurized heated column of the spe-
cially prepared Fe O,. The equilibrated solution
was cooled and then passed through a cation ex-
changer to strip out the dissolved iron. The iron
was later eluted and analyzed spectrochemically
by means of o-phenanthroline.

After obtaining most of the data reported here,
we modified the system for eventual use of alkaline
solutions. A copper reservoir was substituted for
the glass one, and provision was made for injecting
an HCI solution into the stream of hot equilibrated
solution to prevent precipitation of dissolved iron
on cooling.

The data are shown in Fig. 6.8, where the log-
arithm of the iron concentration is plotted against
the C17 concentration obtained from the electrolytic
conductivity of the makeup solution. The lines on
the graph have been calculated on the basis of
iron being in solution as the two ions, Fe?" and

we calculated the H' concentration that gave a
charge neutrality for the ionic species at the ex-
periment temperature. The logarithm of the corre-
sponding concentration of iron was then compared
with the experimental value. After treating all the
data this way, a least-squares procedure was used
to adjust the solubility products to values that
minimized the differences between calculated and
observed iron concentrations. These constants,
which include the effective: I, pressute as cal-
culated from the solubility data of Gilpatrick and

Stone, 22 are given below:

These calculated solubility products indicate that
the fraction of iron in the Fe?" form was 100% at
200°% 15% or less at 260° and 55 to 85% at 3007
The apparent change in the signs of the tempera-
ture coefficients of the solubility products over
this temperature range is of interest, as this is
in the same temperature range where the dissocia-
tion constant of water goes through a maximum.

increase the precision of the calculated solubility

HYDROLYSIS OF BERYLLIUM IO IN 1.0 ¥

lium beginning with the work of Prytz?? in 1929.
Probably the most authorative studies are those
coming from Sillén’s sclicol in Stockholm since
1956. %4727 These workers favor a scheme of three
species to explain potentiometric data below 1 M
beryllium concentration in acidic perchlorate
media, that is, Bez(OH)3+, BeS(OH)33+, and
Be(OH’)Q. many other
schemes have been proposed which were not sup-
ported by the work of Sillén and his co-workers.

The neutral species Be(OH), is the least accept-
able of those in the above scheme. The existence
of such a species implies a lower limit for the
solubility of beryllium hydioxide.

and the solubility product.?® However, the work
of Gilbert and Garreit?® has indicated solubilities
less than this and even as low as 107 M. A
cursory examination of the data in ref. 24 indicates
that comparable or better fits to the data are ob-
tained with the scheme Be 3(OI{)24", Bes(OI'{)33+,
and Be3(OH)42Jr as well as other schemes con-
taining Bes(OH)33+. The logarithm for the sta-
bility constant for the species Be:&(OH);‘Jr is

surements have been completed at 25°C in the pH
region 2 to 7 and at beryllium concentrations be-
tween 0.001 and 0.05 m using quinhydrone and
calomel electrodes. The factors limiting the pH or
hydroxide-to-metal concentration ratios which can

be attained are the equilibration rate and the
solubility. Generally, equilibrium ratios up to
about 1.1 were achieved without precipitation

within 1 hr.

Analysis of our data at 25° indicates that no
pair of species with up to five metal jons or hy-
droxide ions per species is sufficient to explain
the data within experimental error. Least-squares
calculations for 33 pairs led to this conclusion.
The schemes involving three or more species have
not yet been examined in detail. However, pre-
liminary results indicate that a polynuclear species
is more suitable than Be(OH),.

As Kakihana and Sillén?** have pointed out, the
presence of the species BG(DH)2 leads to an inter-
section of all A vs pH curves at A of 1.0 and
pH ca. 5.5. Cleatly such an intersection is absent
in the data shown in ig. 6.9, This observation
is consistent with data reported in 1965 by Bertin
et al., %% although these investigators also chose
to interpret their data in terms of Be(OH)2 as
suggested earlier by Sillén.

In order to better define the most representative
hydrolysis schemeg, similar studies are being con-
ducted at higher temperatures.

SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF THORIA

Heots of Immersion and Adsorption

E. L. Fuller, Jr. H. . Holmes
S. A. Taylor!

Heats of immersion of samples of thoria in water
at 25.0°C have been measured for various pre-
treatments. The base material for this series was
obtained by a 650°C calcination of thorium oxalate

(ORNL lot No. DT 102W) to produce thoria with
a specific sutface area of 35.5 m?/g. Portions
of this material were calcined for 4 hr at higher
temperatures to successively decrease the specific
surface area. The specific surface areas () and
crystallite dimensions {from x-ray line-broadening
data) are given as a function of calcining tempera-
ture in Fig. 7.1. This graph also shows the vari-
ations of the heats of immersion with regpect to

these parameters for outgassing temperatures rang-
ing from 25 to 500°C. The samples were maio-
tained at a pressure less than 107% torr for 24 hr
at each temperature, prior to sealing under vacuum.
Fach point represents the mean of at least two
experimental determinations. The calorimetric and
associated techniques have been described previ-
ously.

As observed earlier,? the materials from the
lower-temperature calcination liberated a portion
of the heat slowly after an initial instantaneous
burst of heat. The slow heat effects for the
650 and 800°C calcined thoria are best character-
ized as two concurrent first-order processes: a
slow heat effect with a half-life of ca. 4 min and
a very slow heat with a half-life of ca. 40 min.
The 1000°C calcined thoria exhibited only one
slow process (half-life of ca. 12 min) in addition
to the instantaneous process. The higher cal-
cination temperatures (1200 to 1600°C) produce
materials which release all the immersional heat
instantaneously, with no detectable slow processes
present,

The heat of immersion at any given outgassing
temperature shows an increase with increasing
crystallite size (decreasing specific surface area)
for the lowest-fired materials, followed by a de-
crease to an essentially constant value for the
larger crystallites. The variation of the heats of
immersion with respect to crystallite size is not
well understood and has been the object of inves-
tigations with other oxides, as reviewed recently
by Zettlemoyer.? The invariance of the immer-
sional heat per unit area for our larger crystallites
suggests that these values may be truly repre-
sentative of an ““ideal’’ thoria surface, with some
sort of perturbations present for the smaller crys-
tallites. Such a conclusion must receive justifi-
cation from other techniques that will allow con-
stuction of a creditable model. The inversion
of the data for the 300°C-outgassed, 1000°C-
calcined material is probably due to experimental
error, with the heat of immersion being 850 * 20
ergs/cm? for 300 to 500°C outgassing of this
material.

In an attempt to see if the aforementioned be-
havior is the result of the oxalate preparation of

prepared by the steam denitration of thorium nitrate.
The low-fired, high-surface-area materials also
showed slow heat effects, with none present for
the higher-fired materials.

Adsorption of Water and Nitrogen on Porous
and Nonporous Thoria

H. F. Holmes {. L. Fuller, Jr.

Previous calorimetric?'* and gravimetric® inves-
tigations of the interaction of water with the sur-
face of thoria have revealed the very complex
nature of this process. Material used in the pre-
vious work consisted entirely of porous thoria
derived from the oxalate. ['wo samples of compa-
rable surface area were used in the present work.
Sample C is a typical oxalate material, while
sampie S was prepared in an attempt to minimize
the internal surface, that is, '

decrease the po-

The porous and nonporous character of samples
C and 8, respectively, are clearly revealed from
the typical adsorption isotherms shown in Figs.
7.2 and 7.3. Inflections in the desorption branch
for sample C at a relative pressure of about 0.35
indicate pore sizes ranging down to about 10 A in
radins, The nonporous character of sample § is
further confirmed by the fact that the x-ray crys-
tallite size is compatible with the nitrogen sur-
face area. However, both samples exhibited the
low-pressure hysteresis and irreversible retention
of water discussed previously.® The quantities
of irreversibly adsorbed water listed in Table 7.1
are much greater than would be required to form
a single layer of surface hydroxyl groups. On the
basis of the present resulis, it is concluded that
the irreversible retention of water in such large
quantities is not a unique property of porous mate-
rial. The phenomenon has been described’® as an
immobile association adsorption to give the surface
analog of a hydrated bulk hydroxide.

nitrogen surface areas.

Results from the nitrogen adsorption experiments
are summarized in Table 7.1, which gives the
BET parameters obtained from the isotherms. It
is evident that increasing amounts of irreversibly
adsorbed water decrease both the measured nitro-
gen surface area and the BET C constant., A
decreasing value of C implies a smaller average
heat of adsorption in the first monolayer, a less
shatp ‘‘knee’’ of the isotherm, and that higher
pressures are required to fill the first statistical
monolayer. Decreasing nitrogen sutface areas
for sample C, like those obtained from the water,
can perthaps be explained on the basis of the chem-
isotbed water decreasing the pore volume. This
concept cannot, however, explain the decreasing
nitropen surface areas observed with sample S.
Explanations for the effect of chemisorbed water
on the nitrogen surface areas of sample S are, at
best, tentative. The effect of the magnitude of
the BET C constant and of the substrate lattice
on the area occupied by a nitrogen molecule is
curtently being investigated.

Infrared Spectra of Adsorbed Species on Thoria

C. S. Shoup, Jr.

Infrared spectral studies of adsorbed species on
thorium oxide have continued with higher outgas-
sing temperatures than were previously attainable.?
Initial room-temperature outgassing of a pressed
disk of ThO, which had been calcined in air at
650 (see Fig. 7.1) produced a prominent absorp-
tion band at 3740 cm ™!, attributed to unperturbed
surface hydroxyl groups, and a band at 3660 cm™ .
In addition, a dramatic reduction in the intensity
and increase in the frequency at maximum absorb-
ance of a broad band due to the stretching mode
of hydrogen-bonded OH groups occurred. In con-
trast to most other oxides, ?'1? however, increasing
the outgassing temperature above 100° reduced
{he intensity of the band at 3740 cm™'. After
outgassing at 5007 this band had virtually dis-

appeared, leaving a doublet at 3645 to 3660 cm ™1

and a weaker band at 3520 cm~' superimposed
on a weak, broad contour, indicating some residual
polymeric hydrogen bonding.

Although this thoria had previously been calcined
in air at only 650° the sample was nevertheless
outgassed at increasingly higher temperatures,
thus producing some sintering action.!! OQutgas-
sing at 650° left only weak bands in the OH stretch-
ing region at 3656 and 3503 cm™!. No surface
hydroxyl groups were spectroscopically evident
after outpassing at 800° but other bands in the
1200 to 1700 em™ ! region were present. These
latter bands disappeared after outgassing at 950°.
However, bands at 1040 and about 730 cm ™! were
very little affected by the outgassing treatment,
and their intensities were hardly reduced after
in vacuo sintering at 950°. Examination of other
samples of 'I‘hO2 indicated that these bands were
properties of the total mass, either as thotium
oxide or bulk impurities.

The discoloration of ThO,, which has been ob-
served often after outgassing at 500° % has been
shown to be due to the presence of a small amount
of carbon residue from organic contamination de-
posited during the initial outgassing steps (indi-
cated by the presence of carbon-hydrogen stretch-
ing bands in the 2850 to 3000 cm™?! region). This
catbon residue can be removed by oxidation at
400° with an accompanying weight loss, or by
volatilization at 900 to 1000°.° [o the absence
of prior organic contamination, heating to 500° in
vacuo produced no discoloration. The fact that
the infrared spectra and the enerpetics of water
adsorption? were independent of color and oxygen
treatment (in contrast to rutile*?) indicates  that
oxygen defects, as proposed elsewhere,'? do not
play an important role in the discoloration of thoria.

In the presence of pure water vapor at a relative
humidity of 60%, the H-O~H deformation mode of
physically adsortbed H,0 at 1630 em™! was the
only absorption band to appear (except in the OH
stretching region) that was not present after out-
gassing at 950°  After rcom-temperature evacu-

remained at 861, 1020, 1303, 1416, and 1583 cm ™!,
in addition to those present before the ThO 6 was

this that atmospheric catbon dioxide is rapidly and
strongly adsorbed on thoria, at least in the pres-
ence of water vapor.

Sol-gel microspheres of ThO, or UO, have been

largest amount of gas evolution occurred at the
following centigrade temperature intervals: 240
to 260, 400 to 460, and 700 to 760, Above 760°C,
only a negligible amount of gas remained.

The wet UO, microspheres yielded CO,, CO,
Hz’ N,, 02, NO, and organics when heated with
steam and evacuated. The temperature intervals
of maximum gas evolution appear to be 150 to
250°C and 400 to 650°C. The principal gas
evolved (primarily in the 300 to 350° range) was
CH,. This is in direct contrast with the production
of higher-molecular-weight organic products previ-
ously noted in the case of the ThO, microspheres.

A possible explanation'® for the difference is
that in dry ThO, catalytic cracking of the included
organics occurs, while in the wet UO, matrix
thermal cracking is dominant. The lailter case is
expected to produce lower-molecular-weight prod-
ucts.

A conditioning scheme, successful with respect
to producing a low carbon content, a low O:U
ratio, and high density, is shown in detail in Table
7.2. The flow of water vapor was necessary for
the removal of carbonaceous material and, thus,
for production of a low final concentration of car-
bon in the UO, microspheres. The water vapor
also seems to prevent fragmentation of the spheres.

The mixture of CO, and H, 0 was superior to
either compound separately for increasing the rate
of sintering. Tt was of prime importance that the
carbon removal be complete before the mixture of
Co, and H?_O was added, since the densification
step trapped any remaining carbonaceous material.
The final use of pure H, to counter the oxidizing
effect of the mixture of CO, and H O produced the
low O :17 ratios.

It is expected that the same processing scheme
would be applicable to microspheres consisting of
any member of the ThO,-UO, solid-solution sys-
tem, although no experimental information is avail-

TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF GASES

Gaseous Diffusion Studies in Noble-Gas Systems

A. P. Malinauskas

Gaseous diffusion experiments have been con-
ducted with the gas pairs He-Kr, Ar-Kr, and Kr-Xe
over the temperature range 0 to 120°C to provide
additional data for use in an investigation of the in-
teraction characteristics of noble-gas molecules, !
This work represents the second phase of a sys-
tematic study of the binary diffusion process in
systems involving all possible combinations of
the noble gases.? The third part of this research,
involving the systems He-Ne, Ne-Ar, Ne-Kr, and
Ne-Xe, is in progress.

All the diffusion data available concerning the
systems He-Kr, Ar-Kr, and Kr-Xe are graphically
summarized in Figs. 8.1 to 8.3, where the dif-
fusion coefficient D.,, at 1 atm pressure, is
plotted as a function of the absolute temperature
T. The solid lines in the figures have been con-
structed using the usual Chapman-Enskog ex-
pression for the diffusion coefficient,® in which
the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential energy pa-
rameters presented in Table 8.1 have been em-
ployed. These parameters yield the best repre-
gsentation of the experimental data; they likewise
give favorable agreement with diffusion coefficient
values deduced from measurements of the com-
position dependence of the viscosities of the cor-
regponding pas mixtures. On the other hand, a
similar comparison with values obtained from the
measured thermal conductivities of the mixtures

In an attempt to remove this shortcoming, we
sought to replace the capillaries with a fritted
glass disk.

Experiments wete conducted with the porous
disk arrangement; although the time interval for
a given experiment was reduced to 5 min, it was
no longer possible either to measure or to comn-
trol the temperature gradient accurately, since
the use of the porous plate permitted the thermal
conductivity of the gas to markedly atfect the
temperature conditions. Coansequently, the re-
producibility of the data obtained was quite poor,
and the method was therefore abandoned.

In the meantime, a more sensitive pressure-
sensing device than that employed in the earlier
work has been procured. Since the instrument
will permit us to employ capillaries of a larger
size, thereby increasing the rate of attainment
of steady-state conditions, we are cuirently con-
structing a modified version of the original cap-
illary design.

Gaseous Diffusion in Porous Media

A. P. Malinauskas R. B. Evans III
E. A. Mason® '

A generalized freatment of gas transpost in porous
media has been realized; as a result, it is now
possible to account for a variety of phenomena
involving gas transport from a single viewpoint
having a sound theoretical foundation. 7

The treatment has been developed on the basis
of the ‘“‘dusty-gas’’ model, a model in which a
porous septum is described as consisting of uni-
formly distributed giant molecules (dust) held
stationary Although this description
is not as palatable as the more common ‘‘bundle
of capillaries’’ concept, it does possess two dis-
tinct advantages from a mathematical standpoint.
First, the geometrical part of the problem neatly
separates from that part which deals with the
dynamics of the gas transport. Second, the im-
portance of gas-surface collisions relative to
gas-gas readily assessed; one
mesely varies the ‘““mole fraction” of the dust.
In other words, it is unnecessary to postulate
one mechanism for free-molecule conditions and
ancther for hydrodynamic transport and then at-
tempt to reconcile the two in the transition region;
the validity of the dusty-gas model applies through-

in space.

interactions is

out. Moreover, the results are likewise applicable
to describe gas transport through capillaries simply
by a suitable substitution for geometric parameters.

The following brief summary indicates the num-
ber of phenomena which have been described as
special forms of the general case (some of these
have been presented previously).®

Binary Gaseous Diffusion at Uniform Temper-
ature and Pressure. — This pheaomenon is treated
as three-component diffusion in terms of the dusty-
gas model; the most notable result is a theoretical
formulation for the observation that the ratio of
the fluxes of the two diffusing gases is approxi-
mately inversely proportional to the square roots
of their molecular weights, not only under con-
ditions of free-molecule transport but in the region

of hydrodynamic transport as well. Parenthetically,
this observation appears to have been made first
by Graham in 1833, but has either become for-
gotton or confused with his work on effusion
(transport into a vacuum), which was done about
13 years later.

Isothermal Transport in the Presence of a Pres-
sure Gradient. — When only a single gas is con-
sideted, the mathematical expression which results
from an application of the model represents an
analogous form of Poiseuille’s flow equation with
viscous slip. However, the viscous part arises
from Stokes’ law, whereas the slip term is de-
veloped from a consideration of pure gas diffusion
in a static dust environment. Moreover, the
Knudsen minimum, which has yet to be rigorously
described utilizing the capillary concept, is sat-
isfactorily taken into account by considering the
next-higher to the diffusion co-
efficient.

Whether a pure gas or a binary gas mixture is
considered, it turns out that it is possible to
separate (mentally) the viscous flow contribution
from that due lo diffusive transpori; but in the
latter case the equations remain coupled through
the composition dependence of the characteristic

approximation

transport coefficients.  Consequently, few sit-
uations can be conveniently handled without re-
course to numerical methods. Cne of these is
known as the Kramer-Kistemaker effect, wherein
a pressure gradient develops in a closed system
because of diffusion. In this instance the equation
derived from the dusty-gas concept appears to
be the first description of the phenomenon that
is applicable at all pressures.

Pure Gas Transport Under the Combined Influ-
ence of Gradients of Pressure and Temperature., —
This phenomenon is koown as thermal transpi-
ration or the thermomolecular pressure difference.
Priot to the application of the dusty-gas model,
the effect was primarily investigated only be-
cause of its influence on zccurate pressure meas-
urement. As stated in the section ‘‘Thermal
Transpiration,”” the phenomenon now appears to
provide a particularly simple approach to an in-
vestigation of inelastic collisions.

Binary Gas Transport Under Nonuniform Tem-
perature and Pressure Conditions. - All the pre-
vious items represent special cases of this rather
complex situation, and only two aspects of the
problem have been considered in detail. The
first of these is the pressure difference, at steady-
state conditions, which is produced in a binary
gas mixture under the influence of a temperature
gradient, without regard for variations in com-
position; the resultant expression describes thermal
transpiration in a binary gas mixture.

The second case also concerns a steady-state
solution; the problem considered is the relative
separation produced in a binary gas mixture as
the result of a temperature gradient, without re-
gard for pressure variations. The expression
derived for this case describes the variation of
the thermal diffusion factor with pressure, as one
proceeds from the free-molecule region to the
region of hydrodynamic transport.

It is interesting to note that in neither of these
last two cases does there appear to be any ex-
perimental data with which the theoretical re-
lationships may be veritied.

Gas Transport Studies Relojed to Yented
Fue!l Elements for Fast Gas-Cooled Reactors

R. B. Evans III D. E. Bruins®

Tentative reference designs for a 2500-Mw (thet-
mal)} fast-flux helium-cooled reactor call for utili-
zation of fuel pins comprising (U,Pu)O2 bushings
stacked in free-standing stainless steel cladding.
Requirements for high power densities demand
very high fuel temperatures, close pin spacing,
and minimum cladding wall thickness. One might
envision 0.38:in.-OD claddings (0.010-in. walls)
containing 6-ft sections of 80% effective density
Cladding temperature will be 815°C at
steady-state conditions; helium coolant pressure
will be about 1000 psi.

If, for any reason, the coolant pressure exceeds
the internal pin pressure by 200 psi at 815°C,
the claddings might collapse. A means for pres-
sure equalization is clearly needed. In the present
investigation the possibility of using direct vent-
ing devices'!® to ensure pressure equalization
is being examined under the realization that direct

We have elected to initiate our work by giving
first consideration to the release problems and
means for their mitigation. This approach was
adopted to take advantage of the only established
criterion available for studies of this type, namely,
the maximum allowable release-to-birth ratio, R/B,
of fission products as legislated in the PBRE1!!
fuel specifications, modified to account for zero
retention by fuel at fast flux reactor tempera-
tures. !? The reference criterion turns out to be
a constant R/B of 1.8 x 10~ 2 for all fission prod-
ucts.

Venting efficiencies have been left as somewhat
of a dependent variable because, once a suitable
venting device has been contrived, dimensioned,
and evaluated, venting capabilities as well as
inherent limitations can be determined. Under
this approach we need not be concerned (for the
time being) with rather nesbulous considerations
that might govern venting criteria in the future,
for example, ““maximum credible’’ coolant pressure
and /or fuel-temperature excursions.

In summary, we seek selective venting devices,
materials, or configurations that can discriminate
gradients in total pressure and partial pressures;
thus forced-coolant flow admittances will be high
when Ap # 0, and diffusive-flow admittances will
be low when Ap = 0. Both laboratory and desk
studies have been initiated to obtain the ob-
jectives cited above.

satisfy the condition dn,/dR = 0, and n, must be

of experimental imperfections. Experimental data

diffusion and densification neglected.

For the case of porous carbons and graphites,
we find that Eg. (6) does not give a good fit of
experimental data plots. Obviously, the normal
r-space distribution does not hold, because well-
collimated beams would ‘‘see’’ density variations
in porous targets. The probability for stopping
f(r) dr about a mean R would not be symmetrical,
as it is for a normal distribution. In terms of
bulk volume most of the matrices of our porous
targets are composed of solids (open porosities
range from 10 to 20 vol %), and the most probable
range r, should correspond to a ‘‘low’” value
which might be predicted using a ‘“high’’ porosity-
corrected density. Thus, on the r-space distri-
bution, r_ should reside to the left of the average
{r) or R, while portions of the curve to the right
of R should “‘tail out’” slowly to account for

that encountered nonstopping regions

Several skewed distribution functions were tested
for applicability to this problem; the most suc-
cessful candidate appears to be that shown in
Fig. 8.4 for porous targets. This function is
simply Maxwell’'s speed distribution for gases with
v/v_ replaced by r/r_.

When the Maxwellian distribution is subjected
to the same manipnlations employed to develop
Eq. (6), one finds that

exactly. As before, the F.R. function also rep-
sesents the f(z) distribution in coatings. Typical
porous target data are shown on the right side
of Fig. 8.5. The solid line represents a plot of
Eq. (7), and the dotted line represents a plot of
Eq. (6), which clearly does not apply.

Average range values for porous targets appear
in Table 8.2. Values for two of the porous ma-
terials show good agreement with ideal values.
Range wvalues for the very porous graphite are
somewhat high; however, a large fraction of the
pores in this material were several times greater
than R. Our original intentions were to use these
data to establish an upper limit on pore sizes,
and in this respect the experiments failed because
Eq. (7) was followed (except at large z/R) and
the ranges were only slightly greater than the
ideal values.

In summaty, we have found that effects of po-
rosity and variations in n, can be taken into ac-
count through a proper selection of the primitive
r-space distribution function. When this is ac-

91

complished, the mean range for porous targets
should be approximately the same as those ob-
served or predicted for homogeneous (ideal) ma-
terials. Specific details concerning porosity char-
acteristics are of little importance, if the pores
are not too large or well connected, because the
range correlation depends only on the bulk den-
sity and/or total porosity. Finally, we note that
straggling factors, as given by the theory, are of
little consequence with respect to the present
investigation.

OXIDATION OF GRAPHITE SLEEVES BY STEAM

C. M. Blood G. M. Hebert

I.eakage of steam into the coolant circuit of
an HTGR having coated fuel particles and graphite
structural elements in the core could result in
damage to the fuel coatings and graphite com-
ponents due to extensive oxidation if appreciable
partial pressures of steam were present during
the period in which the core components were at
high temperatures. At this time, such parameters
as partial pressure of steam and temperature of
the various core components under accident condi-
tions cannot be precisely defined. Consequently
the steam-graphite reaction must be examined
experimentally using fairly wide ranges of tem-
peratures and partial pressures of steam in an
attempt to cover the abnormal conditions which
may prevail. Some fission products catalyze the
oxidation of graphite, and if such products have
moved from the fuel particle to the adjacent
graphite abnormal reaction rates may be expected.
The

trolled at very high reaction rates resulting from

reaction also may be mass transport con-

excessively high temperatures or strong catalysis
at lower temperatures.

The oxidation of AT] graphite spheres by steam
was studied previously.! More recently, AT]J
graphite sleeves have been oxidized at 1000°C
using a helium-steam mixture having a partial
pressure of ~250 torrs and a total pressure of
1 atm. Mullite reaction tuhes and quartz deposition
tubes used in these studies have been replaced
recently with alumina tubes, and studies now are
being performed in the temperature range of 1100
to 1500°C. 1

These dimensions approximated those of graphite
specimens available from irradiation studies.
Graphite sleeves (2 in. long) were impregnated
with barium using 1338&(112 and Ba(()H)2 solution,
drying the impregnated specimen at ~125°C, and
finally heat-treating in diy helium at 800 or 1000°C
for various periods of time. Sectioning and count-
ing of impregnated specimens are incomplete, but
preliminary measurements suggest that the treated
specimens contained ~0.1 wt % of barium and that
the barinm was not uniformly distributed through
the graphite. One specimen of graphite previously
irradiated in loop 1, experiment 14 (ref. 2) was
oxidized and examined for transport of fission
products.
Reaction rates measured for wvarious graphite
specimens are given in Table 9.1. Average rates
determined from weight changes are expressed on
a weight basts, but essentially the same telative
rates would be obtained if geometric surface areas
were employed instead of weights because of the
geometiy of the specimens. A superficial com-
parison of the rates obtained for the untreated

TRANSPORT OF FISSION PRODUCTS
C. M. Blood

Quartz deposition tubes were used in the runs
in which the barium-impregnated and the previously

irradiated graphite sleeves were oxidized by
steam, as well as during the prior heat treatment
of the impregnated sleeves in dry helinm. These
tubes were utilized to determine any movement
of barium downstream from the impregnated spec-
imens in wet or dry helium and (in the case of
previously irradiated graphite specimens) to cap-
ture any fission products transported by wet
helium. A number of the deposition tubes have
been sectioned by cutting into 1.5-cm lengths,
and the gamma activity due to '°°Ba has been
measured in each section,

Studies using graphite sleeves impregnated with
133Ba and subsequently heat-treated at 800 or
1000°C employing a flow of 330 cm®/min (STP)
of dry helium showed that very small quantities

94

of 1°°Ba deposited on the deposition tubes. Even
smaller quantities of transported 133Ba were found
on the deposition tubes from runs in which heat-
treated impregnated graphite were
oxidized by steam-helium mixtures [900 cm®/min
(STP) of helium| at 1000°C. The data suggest that
barium is less readily transported by wet belium
than by dry helium. The fact that all the impreg-
nated graphite specimens had received a heat
treatment in dry helium prior to oxidation compli-
cates the comparison, however, because there is
evidence that barium is fixed in graphite to some
extent by the prior heat treatment. The flow rate
of the dry helium during the heat treatment at
1000°C appears to have had an important effect

of dry helium showed a much larger transport of
13384 than those runs made at the lower flow rate
of 330 cm?¥/min (STP). Counting data obtained
from the sectioned deposition tube used in the
run at the higher flow rate of dry helium are given
in Fig. 9.1. The marked temperature dependence
of the 1?*Ba deposition suggests that condensation
of some species occurred over a relatively short
length of the deposition tube. At this stage, how-
ever, the transported species has not been identi-
fied, and the available data do not permit an
accurate determination of the condensation tem-
perature or heat of sublimation. A gamma scan
of the tube did not provide a better profile than
that obtained by sectioning. A smaller temperature
gradient and improved sectioning or scanning
techniques are required to provide the more precise
data needed for further study of the transported
material.

Sectioning and counting of the deposition tube
used in the run in which irradiated graphite from

(Table 9.1) revealed that appreciable activity had
been transported downstream by the wet helium,
The deposition profile is given in Fig. 9.2, in

OXIDATION OF COATED FUEL PARTICLES
BY WATER VYAPCR

J. E. Baker

The pyrolytic-carbon coating on the fuel particle
is expected to retain gaseous fission products
until the coating fails; nonvolatile fission products
may diffuse slowly into the coating during pro-

longed use at high temperatures. If {eakage of
water vapor into the reactor occurs, subsequent
oxidation of the coating on the fuel particle may
cause failure of the coating and release of gaseous
fission products. The nonvolatile fission products
may be transported by the coolant and deposited
on various surfaces within the reactor following
failure of the coating.
97

Fatlier studies?®'? of the oxidation of pyrolytic-
catbon-coated fuel patticles by water vapor were
performed at temperatures of 1000°C orx less and
utilized partial pressures of water vapor ranging
from 4.5 to 560 tous. The effects of higher tem-
peratures and lower concentrations of water vapor
have been examined in more recent studies.®
Rates of reaction of pyrolytic-carbon coatings
present on unirradiated fuel particles were deter-
mined at temperatures of 1100 to 1400°C. Helium—
water-vapor mixtures containing 500 to 1000 ppm

Experiments performed in mullite reaction tubes
during the early part of these studies gave results
which were so erratic that it was impossible to
determine the effect of temperature and water vapor
concentration on the reaction rates. In virtually
all cases, the observed reaction rates decreased
with time, and in some instances the final rates
were an order of magnitude lower than the initial
rates, Consistent data obtained after replacing
the mullite tube with an alumina tube indicate that
mullite was responsible for the erratic results.
Gearey and Littlewood® also observed a decrease
in reaction rate attributed it to
catalysis of the steam-graphite reaction by silica

IRRADIATION EFFECTS ON PYROLYTIC-
CARBON-COATED FUEL PARTICLES

P. E. Reagan  J. G. Morgan  J. W. Gooch
M. T. Morgan M. F. Osborne

We are studying the irradiation effects on coated
fuel particles by measuring the fission-gas release
rates during irradiation at high temperatures, and
by postirradiation examination to determine what
damage was done. These studies are being pér-
formed in cooperation with the groups who are
developing the coatings for fuel particles  at
ORNL, General Atomic, and the Carbon Products
Division of Union Carbide Corporation. The in-
tegrity of production-run coated particles for the
AVR reactor was studied during a long-term test.
The effectiveness of silicon carbide barrier to
solid fission product release is being studied,
and the effectiveness of a gas gap in retarding
sclid fission product release is also being in-
vestigated.

fuel elements for the pebble-bed gas-cooled
German AVR reactor, were irradiated to 10 at., %

ticles that were representative of the production-
run coated particles.? The fractional fission-gas
release for 28Kr was 5 x 107 ° at the beginning of
the test and increased with burnup to 4 < 1075,
No bursts of fission gas were released during the

irradiation examination.® Metallographic exami-
nation revealed some damage to the inner coating,

Pyrolytic carbon coatings on fuel particles will
contain essentially all of the fission gases, but
at elevated temperatures some of the solid fission
products {(notably St, Ba, and Cs) will diffuse
through the coating. To reduce the mipration of
fission solids, a silicon carbide barrier layer
may be deposited between layers of pyrolytic
carbon., One experiment (capsule AS7) contain-
ing thorium~uwranium carbide—coated particles of
this type (batch GA-327) was irradiated at 1300°C
for 1800 hr. The fission-gas release was low

One irradiation capsule assembly (A9-6), after
being irradiated for 1100 hr at 1500°C, was ex-
amined for the location of the principal solid
fission products. In this experiment the graphite
fuel particle holder was isolated from a graphite
shell by an annular gas gap as shown in Fig

IN-PILE TESTS OF A MODEL TO PREDICT
THE PERTFORMANCE OF COATED
FUEL PARTICLES

P. E. Reagan
E. L. Long, Jr.

J. G. Morgan
J. W. Gooch

A mathematical model that will predict the
conditions under which a pyrolytic-carbon-coated
particle will fail has been formulated by Prados
and Scott.* This model takes into consideration
the combined effects of fuel swelling and fission-
gas pressure from fuel burnup, and fast neutron
damage to the coating., To test the model, we
irradiated a capsule containing about 4000 coated
particles with structural characteristics for which
the model was readily applicable. These were
sol-gel U0, particles, coated with a high-density
laminar pyrolytic carbon inner coating and a
high-density isotropic carbon outer coating. The
average fuel particle diameter was 202 y, and the
average coating thickness was 123 u. These par-
ticles (designated OR-YZ66) were irradiated at
1400°C in the B9 facility. After 1209 hr (15 at. %
uranium burnup), the particles began to release
bursts of fission gas at irregular intervals. The
bursts continued, and at the end of the test (23%
burnup) we had observed 197 bursts. Postirradia-
tion examination of the coated particles showed
that about 5 to 10% of the coatings had indeed
broken and in many cases were completely sep-
arated from the uranium oxide particles, as shown
in Fig. 10.2. Mectallographic examinations are in
progress, and postirradiation burnup determina-
tions are being made to check the values ob-
tained by argon activation during irradiation.

The mathematical model had predicted coating
failure at 14.2 at. % burup.® Since the first
failure occurred at 15% burnup and a rather small
fraction of the coated particles had failed even
at 23% burnup, it appears that the calculation gave

proves this to be tme, the constants in the
equations can be changed to increase the accuracy
of the calculation.

To study the effect of the ratio of thickness of
porous carbon to dense pyrolytic carbon in the
particle coating, uranium oxide particles were
coated with three different ratios of dense to

the test, the fractional release of ®3Kr was in the

porpus carbon coating had been consumed during
irradiation; but there was no evidence of uranium
carbide formation. Most of the high-ratio parcticles
(batch OR-494) either failed or were damaged
almost to the point of failure. Failure was by
unilateral movement of the Jo, through heth
layers of the coating. The fuel in these particles
appears to have operated at a higher temperature
than particles with the thinner porous carbon
coating. Crystals of UC_ were found at the fuel
sutface of the totally failed particles.

When the experiment was designed, it was as-
sumed {hat the five coated particles with the
thinnest porcus carbon layer would fail first,
because there is little room for expansion of the
fuel and accumulation of fission gas. The coated
particles with thick layers of porous carbon were
not supposed to fail. The burnup was too low
to cause failure in any of these particles. We
have observed, however, that a very thick buffer
layer of porous carbon will insulate the fuel
particle and may cause failure because of ex-
cessively high temperature in the fuel.

POSTIRRADIATION TESTING OF COATED
FUEL PARTICLES

M. T. Morgan C. D. Baumann
R. L. Towns

To aid in the development of better coatings for
coated fuel particles, a series of postirradiation
anneals have been made on four types of pyrolytic
carbon coatings applied to UC, and U0, fuel
particles. Fuel migration studies by metallography

and microradiography have been made, and fission
products released during anneals are being ana-
lyzed. Anisotropy, density, and crystallite size
were the wvariables in the four types of outer
coatings, the details of which are given in Figs.
10.3 and 10.4. These coatings were applied over
identical inner coatings. The coated particles
were all irradiated in the same capsule at the
same temperature (1400°C) and to the same burnup
(14.5% of the heavy metal). Samples of ten
coated particles from each batch were annealed at
1700°C, and duplicate samples were annealed at
2000°C for a total of 191/2 hr for each sample in
steps of 61/2 hr. 78

Evoluation of Fuel Migration by Meta!lography
and Microradiegraphy

Microradiographs and metallographic photomi-
crographs were made on each of the eight batches
of coated particles as coated, on the irradiated
coated particles before heating, and on the ir-
radiated coated particles after the 1700 and
2000°C anneals. The photomicrographs are shown
in Figs. 10.3 and 10.4. The microradiographs are
not shown, but the outer diameter of the dense
areas in the radiographs corresponds to that of
the shaded or spotted ateas of the coatings in the
photomicrographs, indicating uranium diffusion
into these areas.

Reaction areas in the coated uo, particles
were restricted to the inner coating. Spearhead-
type attack occurred during irradiation in coated
particles with low-temperature outer coatings, and
the UO, seemed to expand to fill the void areas.
In the coated uo, particles with outer coatings
deposited at 2000°C, spearhead attack is not
evident, and penetration of the inner coating is
slight: this is probably a result of the 2000°C
heat treatment received during the deposition of

the outer coatings. The uo, particles lost

The UC, fuel showed no apparent fine porosity
after irradiation. Heat treatment at 2000°C seemed
to have consolidated the fine porosity into larger
pores or voids. Some graphite flakes were seen
around the periphery of the fuel particles. The
particle-coating reaction areas in the coated
carbide particles were not as local as the spear-
head attack in the coated oxide particles and
were asscciated with a progressive, more ex-
tensive diffusion of fuel into the coating. The
microradiographs of the unirradiated carbide par-
ticles indicated that fuel diffusion into the inner
coatings started during the manufacture of the
particles.

Penetration of the inner coatings was
complete in all coated carbide particles after
irradiation, as indicated by the spotted areas in
the micrographs. Diffusion of fuel deep into the
coating was evident in the
irradiated YZ-13 coated particles. Large voids
and separation of the inner coating froin the outer
coating were apparent in the YZ-15 and YZ-19
coated particles after heat treatment at 1700 and

Coating Stability

No coating failures were observed in the eight
groups during irradiation at 1400°C. Coatings of
the UC, particles failed during the postirradiation
tests at both 1700 and 2000°C, but no failures
occurred with the UQ, particles. Based on ®°Kr
release, approximately 30% of the YZ-4 sample
and 25% of the YZ-13 sample failed at 1700°C.
At 2000°C, 80% of the YZ-4, 70% of the YZ-13,
and 45% of the YZ-19 samples failed. Failures all
occurred during heatup or within a few minutes
after the annealing temperature was reached.

The two samples of coated uc, particles which
did not fail at 1700°C (one of which also survived
the 2000°C anneal) had undergone the heat treat-
ment during fabrication. We think that the migra-
tion of fuel into the coatings of UC, particles
weakened the coating and caused the high per-
centage of failures.

The compatibility of (U,Th)D2 with graphite and
the compatibility of beryllium oxide with graphite
were studied in separate experiments in the ORR.

(U, Th)O zquphite Experiment

The objectives of this experiment were to study,
at a fuel center temperature of 1650°C and a sur-
face temperature of 1370°C, irradiation etfects on
chemical compatibility of (U,Th)O, with graphite
and fission-gas release, and to determine possible
fuel swelling and its effects on the graphite.

The assembly was swept with helium containing
250 ppm of CQ to suppress the reaction of the
fuel oxides with graphite. The fuel loading and
operating conditions are given in Table 10.2.

During the last six weeks of irradiation, the
133%e release rate increased from 1.5 to 18%;
the temperature drop from fuel center to surface

105

increased from 315 te 390°C. The gamma scan of
the capsule after irradiation and before disassembly
showed about 12 individual peaks of activity for
the space occupied by eight hollow pellets in the
upper fuel region. This indicated that the pellets
were broken and pieces had separated; this was
verified upon disassembly.  The seven solid
pellets in the upper region showed general de-
terioration of their outer surfaces. The 12 pellets
in the lower region appeared intact; however,
attempts to determine dimensions caused one of
them to powder.

Metallography revealed that because of densi-
fication there was much less porosity in the
irradiated sample (compared to an unirradiated
control), and shrinkage cracks were apparent. In
spite of this shrinkage, the diameters of two pel-
lets which we were able to measure did not
change. Weight and dimensional changes of the
graphite disks and spacers were negligible.

We conclude that no carbide formation occurred
from the following:

Be0O-Graphite Experiment

The BeO-graphite test was designed to study
irradiation effects at 1500°C on the chemical
compatibility of graphite with BeO, to investigate
the distribution of °Li formed in the Be(, and to
determine weight,
changes in the graphite and BeQ. A BeO ring and
a graphite ring were in close contact on flat sur-
faces and were nested over a solid BeD core
within a graphite sleeve.

The experiment was not fueled. The desired
temperature was achieved for about four months
by pamma heating. During the last five months
of irradiation, the temperature gradually fell to
about 1280°C, probably because of formation of
soot {CO » CO, + C), resulting in loss in effec-
tiveness of reflective insulation in the capsule.
The total irradiation dose was 1.0 x 102! uneu-
trons/cem? (E > 0.18 Mev).

There was no physical damage to the BeO or
graphite during irradiation. Metallographic exami~
nation of selected surfaces showed no reaction
products, and x-ray diffraction of the BeO ring
showed no Be,C. There was a deposit of Mo,C
on the graphite sleeve adjacent to several large
holes  which appeared in molybdenum heat
shield.

Examination of the irradiated graphite showed
no microstructural changes. Examination of the
irradiated BeO showed that the grain size doubled,
and each grain was outlined by gas bubbles, as
seen in Fig. 10.5. Analyses of experimental com-
ponents for °Li concentrations showed that the
major portion of the °Li stayed in the BeO core
where it was formed. A surface-to-volume rela.
tionship for °Li retention was found by comparing
the Be() ring with the BeO core. This is in
agreement with work by Stieglitz and Zumwalt. !

Weight and dimensional changes for the BeO and
graphite showed about 1% shrinkage for the
graphite and 0.5% expansion for the BeO.

During the past year we have begun postirra-
diation evaluations of experimental assemblies
related to fuel elements for fast gas-cooled re-
actors. This is a cooperative program with
General Atomic Division (GA) of General Dy-
namics Corporation. Details of test conditions
and procedures were determined by the ORNL
Reactor Division in cooperation with GA, and the
fuel specimens were supplied by GA. The present
series of tests is designed to investigate the
effects of irradiation, thermal cycling, external
pressure, and fuel-cladding interactions on . the
integrity and behavior of metal-clad UO, fuel
elements having design features that approximate
those for the General Afomic fast pas-cooled re-
actor design. Design and operation of these ex-
perimental assemblies and details of postirradia-
tion findings have been reported elsewhere.!?271°

Two types of elements are being studied in the
first group of tests: the fuel-supported type, in
which the cladding is designed to collapse onto
the fuel pellets at the outset of pressure and
temperature application, and the free-standing fuel
or ‘“flexcan’® type. The latter has a deformed
section of cladding above the fueled region that
is capable of flexing with pressure changes, and
the internal void is filled with sodium.

We have completed examinations of four as-
semblies (lacking metallography for the fourth)
which contained six of the fuel-supported elements
and two of the sodium-filled flexcan types. All
elements were fueled with UOQ pellets,

Operating data and metallograpghic findings are
given in Table 10.3, while the appearance of two
of the test elements is shown in Fig., 10.6.

GAl was badly deformed and GA2 was deformed
to a lesser extent. (Some more recent elements
have been prepressurized to avoid large pres-
sure differences across the cladding.)

There was no evidence of incompatibility be-
tween the cladding and the fuel in the ele-
meats tested, except for subsurface voids (fto
a depth of about 10% of the wall thickness)
noted in the inner surface regions of GAl
(Hastelloy X).

There was no evidence cf fuel melting in any

to this problem by studying the behavior of
fission-gas release under well-controlled condi-
tions in an attempt to understand the basic mech-

anisms of fission-gas release.!? 21

Defect-Trap Medel

As a result of these studies, we believe that
the fission gas is released by a combination
trapping and diffusion process, where the trapping
is the dominant factor determining the time for the
gas to escape. We have formed a defect-trap
theory which postulates that defects in the uo,
crystal structure will trap migrating xenon and
krypton atoms.?? Some defects, such as grain
boundaries and closed pores, are naturally present
in the UO_, and others can be formed by irradia-
tion. The irradiation-formed defects start as
point defects which may be destroyed by annealing
but may cluster to form larger defects that will
require longer times to anneal. Experiments have

These data are being fitted into a com-
puter code to determine the parameters of the

by the mixing of the fission gas with the flowing

fission-gas release transfer function for the in-
pile experiment.

Fission fragments which recoil free of the speci-
men surface will knock out UO, molecules along
with any fission gas in the immediate vicinity.
The knockout release depends on the fission rate,
the total surface area of the specimen, and pos-
sibly the condition of the surface., In order to
study the eifects of surface condition on fission-
gas release, the gas release rates from UO, single-
crystal specimens with highly polished surfaces
were compared with those from unpolished speci-

mens. 5

The fission-gas release from unpolished
specimens decreased with time in the early stages

predominates, and the gas release shows little
temperature dependence. The tougher surfaced
polycrystalline specimen shows greater knockout
release (both specimens are the same size). At
temperatures above 700°C the gas release is from
point-defect traps for both specimens. At 950
to 1050°C the point defects are mobile encugh
to form clusters, slow down the gas release, and
thus cause the step in the curve for the single-
crystal specimen. The point defects are trapped
by grain boundaries in the polycrystalline speci-
men before they can cluster, and therefore the
step is absent. At higher temperatures, the
clusters in the single-crystal specimen may an-
neal and migrate, and once again the release rate
has an exponential temperature dependence, but
the dependence differs from that where release
is primarily from point defects. The temperature
dependence of gas release from the polycrystalline
specimen, where the gas release is always from
point defects, is constant to 1200°C. Al of
these observations were predictable by the defect-
trap model.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF UD,
DURING IRRADIATION

C. D. Baumann J- G. Morgan

R. B. Perez'®

Studies of the effect of irradiation on the thermal
conductivity of UO, have, for the most part, been
limited to postirradiation tests. Annealing tests
show that irradiation at a low (<100°C) tempera-
ture causes a decrease in themmal conductivity
which can be recovered in stages near 150 and
400°C. 2% Effects of density, grain size, and
burnup have also been studied after irradiation. a7
Data are lacking, however, on the actual thermal
conductivity during irradiation as it is affected
by fission rate and temperature. We have begun
our in-pile testing with a single crystal of U0, to
eliminate the parameter of grain-boundary effects.?®

We are evaluating data obtained while the speci-
men was at three different neutron flux levels and
three temperatures at each neutron flux. The evalu-
ation is not complete, but we can see some rather
definite trends: (1) the thermal conductivity is
lowered by increasing the fission rate at a given
temperature, and (2} the themal conductivity in-
creases with temperature up to about 900°C and
then decreases with further increase in temperature.

These changes of thermal conductivity with tem-
perature, while fissioning, are consistent with
the concept that disorder lowers the thermal con-
ductivity. When the temperature of the specimen
is changed (for example from 600 to 700°C) while
at a constant fission rate, two different processes
are in competition which affect the thermal con-
ductivity: (1) the conductivity of the undamaged
matriz tends to decrease as the temperature (s
increased, and (2) the increased temperature would
increase the conductivity by annealing the accu-
mulated radiation damage. When the temperature
is increased from 600 to 700°C, the themmal ¢on-
ductivity increases because annealing the radi-
ation damage is the dominant process. At tem-
peratures higher than about 900°C, the equilibrium
amount of damage is small enough so that the
change in conductivity caused by the increase in
temperature will result in a net lowering of the
conductivity.

The specimen is moved sinusoidally in the reac-
tor neutron flux. The fission rate and, thus, the
heat production within the specimen respond in-
stantaneously to the change in neutron flux, but
the temperature does not. I the oscillations are
so rapid that the temperature does not have a

of the irradiation behavior of
commercially available translucent aluminum
oxide of high density* which is of interest as a
possible iasulator in themmionic emitters. The
objectives were (1) to establish its limits of
stability toward fast aeutrons and (2) to determine
whether grain boundary separation would cccur at
very high doses, as it does in BeO at doses well
velow 1 x 102! neutrons/ecm?. The experimental

probably does not produce the grain boundary
separation, which is observed in increasing degree
as the neutron dose is increased from 2.3 to 4.7 x

expansion in A1203 is small and does not increase

neutron doses than with the corresponding het-
pressed and slip-cast carbide specimens with
no additive, This was particularly true for
explosion-pressed titanium and tungsten carbides,
which were damaged on exposure to doses above

1. The gross volume expansion is the sum of
the lattice parameter expansion and agglomer-
ates of defects too large to affect measured
values of the lattice parameters,

2. A collapse of the large agglomerates as the

- neutrons/cm? (>1 Mev) is the principal cause

of the shrinkage in gross volume over this

3. The leveling effect on gross damage to the

were irradiated indicates that the nickel
additive is primarily responsible for the in-
creased fracturing observed.

SOLUBILITY OF CALCIUM SULFATE

IN SEA SALT SOLUTIONS TO 200°C;

TEMPERATURE-SOLUBILITY LIMITS
FOR SALINE WATERS'

W. L. Marshall Ruth Slusher

In a previous study? the extensive solubility
measurements of calcium sulfate and its hydrates
in sodium chloride solutions? were used to estimate
solubility limits for these gpecies in saline waters
in general, since such estimates are of great value
to those concerned with distillation of saline
waters. The effect of divalent ions (magnesium
in particular), which can partially complex the
sulfate ion and thereby increase the solubility of
calcium sulfate over that ‘‘normally’® expected,
could not be taken into account in these estimates.
We have, therefore, measured the solubility of
calcinm sulfate (or of the dihydrate at temperatures
below 100°C) in sea salt solutions (aqueous sclu-
tions containing the salt composition of seawater
bul with varying degrees of concentration or dilu-
tion) at temperatures from 30 to 200°C and at ionic
strengths to 6 m, and have compared the results
with those obtained in sodium chloride solutions.
Figure 12.1 shows all scolubility values obtained
experimentally; in this figure the logarithm of the
solubility product, K . is plotted against a func-
tion of the formal ionic strength, /. The term _K;p
is defined as the molal solubility of calcium sulfate
times the molality of total sulfate. The analogous,
comparative behavior in sodinm chloride solutions

data for which are given elsewhere.?'* Qur evalua-
tions of some published solubilities in sea salt

solutions?

are also included in this figure; the
comparative results appear to be in good agreement.
In the temperature interval 30 to 90°C the only
significant difference in solubility in the two
systems is observed at very high ionic strengths.
The solubilities for temperatures from 100 to 200°C
are greater in sea salt solutions, but the values
do not show a continuous (monotonic) increase
in the difference with temperature.
This behavior can be explained by the formation
of an MgSO " neutral species that allows the
molal solubility of calcium sulfate to increase
until the limiting value of the solubility product,
K, obtained from the comparative solubility in
soé’ium chloride solutions, is reached. The change
with increasing temperature in solubility between
that in sea salt (containing approximately 2 moles

increasing

of magnesium per mole of sulfate) and in sodium
chloride soluticns is then explained by an inter-
related function of an increasing association con-
stant of magnesium sulfate and the decreasing
solubility product constant of calcium sulfate.
With the dissociation quotients (at ionic strengths,
[) and constants (at [ == 0) for magnesium sulfate,
calculated from the solubility behavior shown in

Crevice Attack

Titanium has excellent resistance tosaline waters,
but at temperatures of 150°C and higher it is subject
to severe corrosion damape in crevices.® Studies
to determine the cause and to find ways to mitigate
such attack are in progress,

Flectrochemical polarization studies at tempera-
tures up to 150°C showed that it was not possible
to preduce corrosion of the same magnitude as
observed in crevices when the pH of 1 M NaCl
solutions was 3 or higher; this suggests that the

small volume of solution in the crevice becomes
appreciably acid (more than 107 ° M) before crevice
corrosion can occur.® To determine the approxi-
mate pH of the solution in a corroding crevice,
specimens were prepared in which the tip of a fine
titanium capillary extended into the crevice. The
capillaty tubing passed through the head of an
autoclave, and with appropriate valving a small
volume of the solution from the crevice region
could be sampled while the specimen was at 150°C.
The pH of single small drops of solution was about
1 in those cases where crevice corrosion was
observed and 4 to 5 when sipnificant corrosion
was absent. The pH of the bulk solution was 6
to 7.

Figure 12.3 shows a series of paitial anodic
polarization curves obtained potentiostatically in
a solution containing 0.1 ¥ HC{ and 0.9 M NaCl.
The curves originate at the corrosion potential,
and the potential was changed in a noble direction
at 3-min intervals. In the active region the current
density achieved a steady-state value in less than
3 min, whereas in the passive region the current
density decreased slowly for long periods. Although
not shown, the passive region extends up to the
pitting potential, which is higher the lower the
“Pitting’’).  The

temperature (see section on
critical
temperature, corresponding to an activation energy
of about 11 kcal/mole. The actual maximum cur-
rent density at 150°C corresponds to a corrosion
rate of 360 mils/year, which is close to, but less
than, the maximum corrosion rate observed in the
crevice regions (as high as 500 mils/year) at the
same temperature.

specimens exposed to neutral aerated 1 M NaBr,
Nal, or NaQSO4 at 150°C underwent corrosion in
the crevices to about the same extent as observed
in chloride solutions. Anodic polarization curves
obtained in boiling acidified solutions of these
salts were essentially the same as those obtained
in chloride systems (though the pitting potential
is different). These results show that crevice
corrosion of titanium is not peculiar to chloride
but that it is associated with the de-
velopment of an acid environment within the crevice.

The preceding results imply that a titanium alloy
resistant to dilute acid solutions at 100°C may be
immune to crevice corrosion at higher temperatures;
conversely, an alloy showing active corrosion in
dilute acid solutions at lower temperatures probably
will be susceptible to cievice attack at high tem-
peratures. It was of interest, therefore, to deter-
mine the anodic polarization characteristics of a
number of commercially available titanium alloys
and of alloys prepared in small quantities by the
Metals and Ceramics Division. The nominal com-
positions of the commercial alloys tested were:
0.15% Pd; 4% Mn—4% Al; 5% Cr—3% Al;, 4% V—-6%
Al;, 14% V-11% Cr-4% Al; 2.5% Sn--5% Al; 2%
Nb—1% Ta—8% Al; and 8% Zr--1% (Nb + Ta)-8%

Potentiostatic anodic polarization curves were
obtained for each alloy in a solution containing
0.1 M HCl and 0.9 M NaCl at the atmospheric
boiling temperature. Of all the alloys tested, only
the 0.15% Pd alloy, those containing 5% or more

Mo, and both alloys containing nickel showed

no active region. Open-circuit potentials of freshly
abraded or pickled surfaces for the latter group
of alloys were greater than the active potential
(more than ~0.4 v vs S.C.E.), whereas all the
other alloys had polarization curves similar to that
observed with commercial purity titanium. The
critical current density for passivation, however,
varied somewhat from alloy to alioy.

Additional anodic polarization curves were ob-
tained in boiling 1 M HCl with those alloys ex-
hibiting passivity in the 0.1 # HCI-0.9 ¥ NaCl
solution.  In this environment only the alloys
containing 20 and 30% Mo and the 0.15% Pd alloy
did not develop a potential characteristic of actively
cotroding titanium. The 2% Ni alloy was passive
initially, but after exposure to the 1 ¥ HCI for
several days or affer cathodic polarization, the
alloy developed an active potential and corroded
at about the same rate as pure titanium. The 1%
Ni-1% Mo alloy exhibited borderline passivity.
Most of the time the potential of the alloy was
about —0.3 v vs S.C.E., but periodically it de-
creagsed to —0.47, at which potential the alloy
corroded with evolution of hydrogen. After a few
minutes at the latter value, the potential returned
to - 0.30 v vs 5.C.E. The time between periods
of active corrosion was 20 to 30 min.

On the basis that crevice corrosion occurs be-
cause of the production and maintenance of an
acid solution in the crevice, the alloys which
would tend to resist such attack are 2% Ni, 5% Mo,
1% Ni + 1% Mo, 10% Mo, 0.15% Pd, 20% Mo, and
30% Mo, with the last being the most resistant.
Observations on a large number of specimens
exposed in high-temperature (150 to 200°C) loop
experiments ate qualitatively consistent with this
ranking, but a satisfactory quantitative means of
assessing and demonstrating susceptibility has not
been devised,

Pitting

Titanium, in common with many other metallic
materials of construction, owes its immunity to
corresion to the existence of a passive oxide
layer at the metal-solution interface. Except in
strongly acidic solutions undet reducing coondi-
tions, titanium normally corrodes spontaneously
at a very low rate in the passive state, and the
current density of the anodic process (formation of
a Ti()2 passive layer) is independent of the value
of the electrode potential over a wide potential

123

range, However, in solutions containing a suf-
ficient concentration of chloride ions (also bromide
or iodide ions), localized breakdown of the passive
layer occurs, and titanium exhibits a pitting poten-
tial similar to that observed for aluminum, iron,
stainless steel, and other metals and alloys which
are capable of existing in both active and passive
states.

Electrochemical studies of titanium alloys in
saline waters have shown asharp inverse dependence
of the pitting potential on temperature. Thus,
whereas most such alloys require anodic potentials
of the order of 10 v or higher to initiate breakdown
of the protective oxide and consequent pitting
attack at approximately 25°C, we have found that
the potential required is only 0.5 to 2.0 v at elevated
temperatures, Details of the variation of the pitting
potential with temperature are dependent on alloy
and solution composition but have been shown to
be quite reproducible under a given set of conditions.

The etfect of temperature on the pitting potentials
of a number of titanium alloys is shown in Fig.
12.4. These data were obtained by variation of the
temperature of the 1 4 NaCl solution while the
titanium electrodes were polarized to their pitting

With increasing
temperature the pitting potentials of these materials
decrease more or less uniformly to values of the
order of +1 to 2 v at 175 to 200°C. A relatively
sudden change (—2 v) in the pitting potential of

changes about 2.5 v over a temperature range of
only a few degrees. Pitting potentials of the type
110-AT alloy (5.5% Al, 2.5% Sn) are generally low
and attain values of only about +0.4 v at 190°C.

Qualitatively, the curves of Fig. 12.4 show that
in general the addition of alloying elements de-
creases the value of the pitting potential of tita-
nium. This is consistent with observations of
Fischer? on effects of various surface treatments
and of intentionally added impurities on the initia-
tion of titanium pitting corrosion. One way to
rationalize these differences in pitting potentials
of titanium alloys is to suppose that the presence
of alloying elements affects the ionic as well as
the electronic conductivity of the protective oxide
layer. It is known that the presence of certain
impurities or lattice defects considerably enhances
the electronic conductivity of rutile (TiOz) crys-

tals. 1%~ 13  Apalogous effects on the kinetics of

the anodic process have been observed as a result
of incorporation of alloying elements into the Ti0O
lattice,!*4/1%  In addition to direct effects on

anodic reaction mechanisms, the presence of

additional electronic energy levels in a semi-
conductor of the type in question and the resulting
enhanced electronic conductivity imply a simul-
taneous increase in hole concentration in the
valence band (weakened bonds), so that a further
increase in the mobility of ionic charge carriers
can be expected.

An analysis based on a simple resistance analogy
suggests that differences in the mobility of ionic
charge carriers, which affect the kinetics of the
anodic processes occurring in the passive oxide
film, can account for observed variation in values
of pitting potentials as a function of alloy com-
position.

EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON POLYMERS

W. W. Parkinson W. K. Kirkland

Radiation~induced processes in polybutadiene
are significant because the polymer has a simple
hydrocarbon structure related to natural and many
of the synthetic rubbers and because the olefin
groups of this polymer undergo rapid changes
upon irradiaticn.  Furthermore, types of poly-
butadiene are obtainable having a high fraction of
the olefin groups in any one of the three possible
igsomeric forms. These forms are cis, trans, and
side vinyl, as shown:

studied were high cis (82%), high trans (95%),
and two mixed polymers, one 73% trans and the
other 71% side vinyl.

To derive actual concentrations of the olefin
groups from the spectral measurements, it proved
necessary to  use the unirradiated specimens
themselves as calibration standards. Calibration
curves developed from liguid olefins proved
inapplicable. However, they were adequate to
determine the small content of c¢is groups in the
two mixed polymers. Since the total unsaturation
was known, this pemmitted the solution of simultee
neous equations relating the concentration of
trans and side vinyl groups to the optical
densities at 967 and 910 ecm™!. The absorptivities
thus calculated, coupled with the accepted value
for the total unsaturation in high-cis polybutadiense,
enabled us to determine the cis concentration in
the polymer of this type from its spectrum. The
integrated band area at 740 cm™*', calculated from
theoretical band shapes,®*? was required for the
calibration and concentration determination of the
cis group because of the dependence of the simple
absorptivity on groups adjacent to the cis species
in the molecule, '

From this treatment of the infrared spectra, the
concentrations of olefin groups were obtained for
specimens irradiated undet wvarious conditions.
The changes in these groups for high-cis poly-
butadiene are plotted vs dose in Fig. 13.1. The
decrease in cis groups at the lower doses appears
to be independent of their concentration {(zero-
order), whereas the decrease in trans and side
vinyl groups in the other types of polybutadiene
followed first-order kinetics. In addition, the high-

yields, rate constants, and activation energies
calculated for all the polymers from these changes
in concentration are listed in Table 13.1.

The activation energies were calculated from
radiation yields at room temperature and at 110°C.
They are similar to activation energies in other
radiation-induced reactions and indicate that low-
energy processes such as the addition of radicals
and the diffusion of relatively small species are
the rate-controlling steps.

The high yields and high rate constants indicate
efficient transfer of radiation energy from the
points of absorption to reactive sites, either
through charge or excitation transfer. It is also
possible that the high rate constants observed for
the side viny! groups result from short chain
reactions.

The products resulting from these reactions are
unidentified as yet. Because the cross-link yields
are far too low to account for the loss in olefin
groups, it has been speculated that intramolecular

RADIATION-INDUCED REACTIONS
COF HYDROCARBONS

R. M. Keyser W. K. Kirkland

The irradiation of coal together with a condensed-
phase source of hydrogen atoms and alkyl free
radicals offers the possibility of the synthesis of
useful hydrocarbon chemicals from inexpensive
raw materials in @ chemonuclear reactor. Initial
jirradiations have been confined to a model system
for experimental convenience: n-hexane (simulating
liquefied petroleum gases) the condensed source
of hydrogen and radicals, with naphthalene simu-
lating coal. It is expected that the overall course
of the reaction, the addition of radiation-generated
hydrogen atoms and alkyl free radicals to aromatic
rings,® will be similar in both the model and coal
systems.

Samples irradiated with ®°Co gamma radiation
have been analyzed by gas chromatography on a
5-m column containing Apiezon L as the separating
medium. The results of a typical run are shown in
Fig. 13.2, from which it is apparent that irradiation
of naphthalene-hexane solutions yields a quite
complex array of products. Efforts to date have
been directed toward identification of the com-
pounds responsible for the peaks in Fig. 13.2.

The six dimers of hexane, the peaks labeled
4,5-diethyloctane through n-dodecane in Fig. 13.2,
have been identified by using chromatographic
retention times to obtain estimates of the boiling
points of the compounds in question and comparing
these with literature values. Apiezon L., a nonpo-
lar liquid, separates saturated hydrocarbons es-
sentially on the basis of their boiling points. It

Values of log t for standard samples of n-
heptane, n-decane, and n-dodecane were plotted
against their respective boiling points, and the
relationship predicted by Eq. (13.1) was found to
hold. Boiling points of the compounds correspond-

the log t vs T, plot. The boiling points obtained
in this way agreed within 1 to 2° of the literature
values for the hexane dimers.

The identification of one of the radiation products
as n-dodecane was further confirmed by the coin-
cidence of its retention time with that of a standard
sample of n-dodecane. This same technique was
also used to tentatively identify the peak preceding
naphthalene as 1,2-dihydronaphthalene,

Compounds corresponding to peaks 1 to 8 in the

trapped in glass capillaries at liquid-nitrogen tem-
perature upon elution from the chromatograph.

tion of compounds 1 through 8. Some typical

The uv spectrum of a-methyvlnaphthalene, in-
cluded in Fig. 13.3 for comparison, exhibits absorp-
tion bands in these same regions also, and the
comparison strongly suggests that compounds 1,
2, 3,4,6, and 8 are c-substituted alkyInaphthalenes.
mince the chromatographic retention time of a-
methylnaphthalene is less than that of compound
1, the alkyl substituents must be larger than methyl.
The uv spectra of compounds 5 and 7 indicate
that these compounds are f-substituted alkyl-
naphthalenes.

Additional amounts of these compounds are being
trapped from the chromatograph effluent, and it is
planned to use these to obtain mass, infrared, and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, which, in
conjunction with the uv data, should enable us to
make a positive identification of the unknowns,

ADDITION REACTIONS
OF FURAN DERIVATIVES

C. 1D, Bopp W, W, Parkinson

The radiation-induced addition of saturated furan
derivatives to olefinic groups is being studied to
develop high-yield reactions which could utilize
radioisotopes in chemical synthesis. An earlier
survey ® covered chiefly monoolefinic and saturated
furan derivatives and eyclohexene. The results
were promising in that the array of products was
limited; there were only three or four major products,
consisting of dimers, 1:1 adducts, and a non-
volatile residue probably comprising trimers and
higher adducts. Furthermore, the yield of major
products was enhanced by irradiation at higher
temperatures, while the yield of minor products
was reduced. On the other hand, none of the
mixtures containing saturated furan compounds
gave the high vields characteristic of chain reac-
tions.

The system cyclohexene-tetrahydrofuran has
been investigated in detail, since the radiation-
induced reacticns of cyclohexene are better known
than those of the other reagents, Solutions of
cyclohexene in tetrahydrofuran in concentrations
of 1:3 and 1:7 were irradiated at room tempera-

ture, and solutions of 1:3 councentration were
irradiated at 150 and 300°C. The irradiated mix-
tures were subjected to chromatographic analysis
on a butanediol succinate polar column and on a
silicone rubber nonpolar column. At room tempera-
ture there were four products in the range of dimers
and 1:1 adducts, plus the nonvolatile residue.
At the higher temperatures one of the products
disappeared.

To identify the radiation products observed by
chromatographic analysis, compounds which were
probable products were synthesized by conven-
tional chemical methods. The chromatographic
retention times of the synthesized compounds were
then matched with those of the radiation products
on columns of at least two types.

The methods used for preparation of the dimeric
compounds were Wurtz-type condensations of or-
ganic halides with active zinc-copper and con-
densations with CHaMgI. For adducts the syn-
thetic method was the Grignard reaction, condensing
the cyclohexeny! ot furanyl magnesium halide with
the proper halide. The halides in all these reac-
tions were prepared by accepted methods. For
example, 2-chlorotetrahydrofuran was obtained by
direct chlorination of tetrahydrofuran at —56°C;
allyl-type bromides, such as 3-bromocyclohexene
and 2-bromo-2,5-dihydrofuran, were obtained by
bromination with a suspension of N-bromosuc-
cinimide in carbon tetrachloride. By these methods

By comparing retention times of these synthetic
products with those of the irradiated mixture, the
compounds listed in Table 13.2 were tentatively
identified as the major radiation products. The
identification remains tentative because of the
presence of the products of side reactions in the
synihesized compounds. The synthesized com-
pounds are now being isolated, Ly distillation
and extraction, for infrared spectra to eliminate
uncertainties. Chromatographic fractions are also
being collected from the radiation products for
similar examination to confirm our identifications.

The tabulated product yields were obtained from
chromatographic peak areas utilizing dodecane as
an internal standard. Evaporation of the irradiated
mixture indicated that the yield of polymeric non-
volatile residue was pgreater than G = 6, probabiy
exceeding the combined yields of dimers and 1:1

DEVELOPMENT OF RADIATION-RESISTANT
INSULATORS

W. W. Parkinson B. J. Sturm
E. J. Kennedy”

A program has been initiated under the sponsor-
ship of the Office of Civil Defense to develop
radiation-resistant insulators for personnel dosim-
eters. Since the dosimeters are small fiber elec-
trometers, the electrical resistance of the construc-
tion materials must be very high, both before and
after irradiation.

A copolymer of styrene and a-methylstyrene with
a moderate impurity content has been found to have
high resistance before irradiation and extremely
low postirradiation conductivity. Objectives of the
program, then, are to correlate the electrical con-
ductivity of plastics with the molecular structure

130

of the base polymers and also with the chemical
nature of the impurities, since these are known to
affect the conductivity prior to irradiation and
appear to play a part in reducing the postirradiation
conduction.

The correlations should permit the selection of
materials andthe development of fabrication methods
suitable for both the bulk insulators and the capac-
itor dielectric in the dosimeters. We also hope to
identify the mechanism of the impurity effects; it
could be a suirface process or a process in the bulk
of the polymer involving supplying and trapping
charge carriers.

Analytical work on styrene-base plastics has
indicated that the content of unpolymerized styrene
varies widely in these materials. The copolymer
of low conductivity showed a monomer content of
~0.1%. The solvent-cast film (the form for capac-
itor dielectric and specimen material for resistance
measurement) showed less than 0.01% monomer.
Since the unsaturated nature of styrene monomer
makes it chemically different from the polymer,
the role of the monomer in electrical processes
inn the plastic will be investigated early in the
program.

A vibrating-reed electrometer has been modified
slightly to permit electrical measurements in the
required low-current range. Tests have indicated
that its minimum sensitivity is of the order of
10~ '% amp. This will be suitable for postirradia-
tion measurements and at least some of the pre-
irradiation measurements.

The procurement of sample materials has been
confined to simple polymers, either hydiocarbons
or polymers of carbon, hydrogen, and either oxygen
or nitrogen, and to materials of relatively high
purity, with the emphasis on the glassy, amorphous
plastics,
ample,

Common commercial additives, for ex-
ultraviolet stabilizers and antioxidants,
have also been obtained.

Measurements and irradiations will be made first
on polymers of simple chemical and physical
structure in the hope of obtaining data amenable
to interpretation in terms of the basic composition
of the material.

INTERPRETATION OF DCX-2 MASS SPECTRA

Twenty DCX-2 mass spectra obtained during a
single day were subjected to detailed examination.
Four types of impurity pases (viz., not hydrogen)
were distinguished by peak height comparisons.
These four types were:

1. those species generated or evolved near the
spectrometer,

2. the so-called base pressure gases,

3. impurity gases introduced with intentionally
admitted gas,

4, impurity gases generated during beam injection.

As noted earlier,! the spectrometer species de-
cayed rapidly for 30 to 50 min after the spectrom-
eter filament was turned on. Those species,
primarily organic, appatently have no significant
relation to gases impinging on the DCX-2 plasma.
Quantitative interpretation of the mass spectra is
complicated by their presence.

Of far more significance is the behavior of the
base-pressure species other than hydrogen. Air
leaks have been only occasionally responsible for
a significant part of the background gases. Water
vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane were the prin-
cipal identifiable species in the background gas
on the day of the study (August 11, 1966). Water
vapor constituted about three-quarters of the im-
purity background gases. Although the water par-
tial pressure increased during admission of hydro-
pen, it was possible to notice the variation of
this component of the background during the day.
This variation is shown in Fig. 14.1. This domi-

nant change, except during a period of probe
adjustment at noon, indicates that the water off-
gassing rate increased during the moming and
presumably was a themal! effect. Because of
the dominance of water vapor and its slow removal
from unbaked vacuum systems, some of the param-
eters affecting water behavior (in unbaked stain-
less steel systems) have been separately studied.?
The partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been
generally observed to follow that of water vapor.
The average carbon dioxide partial pressure ap-
peared to be about 15% of the water vapor pressure
during the day. Methane (present during the tita-
nium evaporation) was about 5% of the water par-
tial pressure, Other organic species and carbon
monoxide comprised the balance of the base-pres-
sure gases, but were not studied.

Of the gases which are introduced along with
intentionally admitted gas, water vapor and air
have been observed. Air from leaks in the gas
manifold is present in amounts which depend upon
the length of time subsequent to manifold evacu-
ation, as well as the leak rate. Water vapor is
usually the dominant manifold impurity and was
so for this study. The water partial pressure
variation with ion-gage reading for a hydrogen leak
is shown in Fig. 14.2. The linearity of the data
points and the times involved in the exposure in-
dicated that this increase was not an artifact of
the spectrometer but was a net increase of water
partial pressure admitted with or due to admission
of the hydrogen. The water pressure was observed
to vary only slightly during beam injection. It
was therefore concluded not to be a gas of the
fourth type (gases produced during beam injection).

ters, to be primarily carbon monoxide and ethylene
in about equal amounts. The variation of mass
28 so adjusted contributed slightly less to the
total pressure than did methane. A fractional
abundance of 0.003 to 0.004 for each of these
gases relative to hydrogen was indicated. This

The principal organic species identified as being
produced during beam injection are methane, ethyl-

of these gases was found for one day to be about

2.5% of the indicated pressure.

For many plasma experiments in DCX-2, it has
not been as necessary to maintain a high-purity
environment as to have some knowledge of the
purity level. A purity index can be defined as

obtained on August 1l yielded the purity index
variations shown in Fig. 14.4. These data were
obtained over a period of several hours in the
merning when the water partial pressure was in-
creasing as discussed above.  The points at
indicated pressures of 1.0 and 1.3 x 107" torr,
which were obtained later, were, accordingly, some-
what lower than the values interpolated from the
eatlier detemminations. The agreement of the cal-
culated values of P.I. with those shown in Fig.
14.4 indicates that unidentified species are not
present in significant amounts,

Residual gas analysis strongly depends on the
useful mass range of the spectrometer, the exist-
ence of identifiable parent mass peakg, and a
knowledge of fragmentation pattems. We have
little knowledge of species with molecular weights
higher than 44 u for the DCX-2 spectrometer, or
higher than about 92 u for the instrument used in
the calibration and chemistry studies. A spectrom-
eter design study has begun with the goal of im-
proving the analytical capability in the ORNL
mirror machines.

MASS SPECTROMETER CALIBRATION STUDIES

Dispersion of mass spectrometer ion beams af-
fects both the cracking patterns and the relative
partial pressure sensitivities for different gases.
Calibration studies carried out using the type of
mass spectrometer used on DCX-2 (Veeco model
No. RGA-3) showed that the instrument has a sig-
nificant degree of mass dispersion. This dis-
persion is attrbutable to space-charge effects and
to thermal velocities in the direction parallel to
the magnetic field during the ion’s life.
Space-charge effects at higher pressures were
observed as a diminution of ion intensities upon
increasing the hydrogen pressure. As expected,
this effect is most pronounced for gases of higher
molecular weight (e.g., argon and krypton). Hydro-
gen pressures of as much as 2 to 3 x 1077 torr
were needed before a significant decrease of the
28 and 18 mass peaks occurred.

At lower pressures the mass discrimination can
be attributed principally to thermal drift in the
direction of the magnetic field during the flight
time of ions to the collector. Estimation of this
effect for the analyzer region only, using as
parameters the flight path (23 cm), the ion velocity
derived from the ion energy meter, the average
thermal velocity (at 100°(C), and relative spectrom-
eter slit lengths, leads to the estimated transmis-
sions listed in Table 14.1 along with the trans-
mission as determined from experimental data
described below. The observed transmission frac-
tions were uniformly lower than those estimated.
This is presumably due to mass discrimination in
the source. For this 60° spectrometer (supplied
with almost equal source and collector slit lengths),
it should be possible to decrease the mass dis-
crimination of the analyzer region by perhaps 60%,

but probably with little overall improvement of this
parameter because of the source contribution.

The method used to experimentally determine the
extent of mass discrimination was simply to meas-
ure the peak height ratios for argon (+1, +2, and
+3) and compate these with the literature values.?
(The electron encrgy for the RGA-3 is 145 1 4 v.)
The same technique applied to the spectrometer
on DCX-2 vielded similar results. The data shown
in Table 14.1 were estimated using a smooth curve
drawn through the points at M/e = 13.3, 20, and
40. Relative calibration of the spectrometer to
an ion gage for nitrogen and water vapor yielded
additional points within 15 and 5%, respectively,
of the derived argon transmission curve. The ion-
gage sensitivity factor for water vapor was inci-
dentally determined from measured flow rates,
assuming the pumping speed for water vapor to
of the trap). This value of the gage sensitivity of
water vapor was found to be 0.9 1 (.03 that of
nitrogen.

These data were used in the measurement of con-
taminant levels in the DCX-2 work described above.
These results should not be indiscriminately ap-
plied to other similar analyzers, because the extent
of mass discrimination is strongly affected by
operating parameters such as repeller potential.
In order to avoid overly harsh evaluation two things
should be noted. The first is that residual gas
analyzers are designed primarily for qualitative
assessment of vacuum conditions and that their
application to quantitative work is usually re-
stricted to individual mass peaks or simple ratios.
The second is that the analytical capability is
restricted generally to masses less than 44 u.
The spectrometer model used in our studies per-
forms these tasks well.

WATER VAPOR CHEMISORPTION
ON STAIMLESS STEEL

The dominance of water vapor impurity in DCX-2
and the lack of information about its sorption
kinetics prompted a study of water sorption at
low partial pressures. The results of the study

 

l.ow masses are obtained by shunting the magnet,
which reduces the field by a factor of about 0.55.

showed distinctly that chemisorption occurred in
the experimental vacuum system. The experiments
were conducted in a manner to give assurance
that the observed chemisorption occurred primarily
on stainless steel surfaces. Thus, since a large
body of informaticn on chemisorption exists,* the
description of water vapor behavior in vacuum
systems can be greatly simplified. Specifically,
a selection from empirical relations between the
extent of sorption and time, exposure, pressure,
or temperature which are observed for other chemi-
sorption reactions may be applied to studies of
water vapor.

Chemisorption may be digtinguished from physi-
cal adsorption using several criteria, including the
following:

1. Chemisorption requires an appreciable (>0.1
ev) heat of activation.

2. It usually involves sorption heat values greater
than about 0.5 to 1.0 ev, whereas physical
adsorption is usually associated with smaller
values.

3. Chemisorption or chemidesorption iz (as a con-
sequence of criterion 1) a slow process.

4. The quantity of substance chemisorbed often is
related to time by the empirical relation:

where ¢ is the amount sorbed at time t and where
a and @ are constant during any single experiment
or at the very least have discontinuous derivatives
with respect to time during a single experiment.

literature on water sorption kinetics at low pres-
sures (<107* torr) or on metals.

The technique used in this study was to observe
the pressure fall after water vapor exposures at
different pressures and durations in a dynamically
pumped vacuum system (Fig. 14.5). The apparatus
was designed to have two regions (A and B) which
could be separately heated. To minimize tempera-
ture nonuniformity, region 4, a steel tube with
1.1 x 10* cm? area, was baked by resistance
heaters strapped to the outside of an aluminum
pipe which fitted concentrically around the steel
tube with a uniform l/g—in, gap. Insulation material
and aluminum foil were applied around the alumi-
num pipe. A copper tubing cooling circuit was
strapped to the steel tube in order to achieve a
rapid cooling capability. Region B, down to below
the conductance-limiting baffle, was heated using
strapped-on and serpentine heaters, and a hot air
assembly to heat the trap. The mass spectrometer
(Veeco RGA-3) was heated with tape heaters,
Glass jon gages (used only for early experiments)
were heated by heat lamps. Only metal seals
were used.

The water was admitted through a valve from a
regulated pressure of 1 or 2 torrs, The gas line
was perodically baked and operated with cold
water cooling to minimize organic contamination.

B was not changed. At the elevated temperature,
typical partial pressures in torrs were 3 x 1073

the gas under study was water.

Water was admitted for periods of time ranging
from about 0.5 sec to as long as 30 min, after
which the valve was closed and the exhaust curve
was obtained. The partial pressure of water was
followed by monitoring mass 18 with the spectrom-
eter. As was expected, agreement with glass ion
gages was good only when the gages ware heated.
For most of the determinations, however, to mini-
mize the possibility that the glass might be affect-
ing the results, they were replaced by nude gages.

was exercised to be able to attribute the observed
chemisorption to the steel surface,

Some effect on water chemisorption kinetics by
ion or electron bombardment is to be anticipated
by analogy to other chemisorption phenomena.
Neither the magnitude nor the direction of change
seems to be presently predictable. Water sorption
by unbaked and baked stainless steel during a
pressure excursion to atmosphere of different hu-
midities has been observed and is reported in the
literature but with inadequate reported data to
permit scaling the parameters studied here over
the required five to six orders of magnitude.
Samples with different specific surface areas wmay
be expected to show different sorption capabilities.

exist leads to possible practical application in

since chemisorption occurs at even very low pres-
sures and is a strong function of exposure time,
maintenance of very low partial pressures of water
by liquid-nitrogen cooling of appreciable areas in
the system, followed by intermittent warming of
the cooled areas, desorption, and rapid exhaust,
should result in a lower water impurity level than
the same period of pumping would produce. Anocther
consequence of the observations reported here is
that even small water impurity levels introduced
from gas manifolds are expected to result in sig-
nificant impairment of the ‘‘base’’

W. E. Browning, ]Jr.

The Nuclear Safety Technical Staff, comprised
of three persons, was formed early this year to
aid in planning, coordinating, and directing the
research and development activities within the
Nuclear Safely Program.

One of the first activities of the technical staff
was to survey work being done in the Nuclear
Safety Program on the development of analytical
models for fission product behavior in various
stages of reactor accidents and to recommend the
initiation of additional theoretical and experi-
mental activities which were needed, preferably in
existing groups outside the technical staff.

In a new activity, theoretical treatment of the
chemical behavior of gas-borme fission products
at high temperatures is combined with a labora-
tory investigation. ‘There are separate studies
of dynamic transport phenomena (continuing) and
of surface phenomena (new) of fission product
deposition at high temperatures. Models are
being developed for the transport and deposition
of fission products in containment vessels and for
the convective circulation of pases. Other theo-
retical work covers the behavior of aerosols. A
new program on behavior of fission products in
gas-liquid systems was started with studies on
the fission product removal by sprays at ORNL
and by suppression pools at General Electric,
San Jose, under subcontract. Another subcontract,
with Battelle Memorial Institute, supports work
on the theoretical chemical yield of methyl iodide.

A continuing program has been maintained for
computing thermochemical equilibria of fission
product fuel mixtures at high temperatures and
for predicting vapor pressures in the gas phase
above a condensed-phase solution. A multi-
component equilibrium program has been obtained
and debugged, and thermochemical data tapes
have been made for U, Sr, 5r0, UO, UOZ, and

U0, in addition to 140 compounds from the JANAF
Tables., Computer programs have been written to
generate thermochemical tables in the JANAF
format for compounds of interest, given some
spectroscopic or experimental data. An experi-
mental program to check theoretical calculations
by mass spectrometric measurements has been
initiated, and preliminary shakedown runs have
been made.

One member has assisted in the development of
a theoretical model describing fission product
behavior in containment vessels and in planning
an experimental program of scaling, flow visual-
ization, and pilot-plant experimeats to test the
model, At the invitation of the AEC, the staff
has participated in the management of an AEC
contract with Professor N. C. Ozisik at North
Carolina State University, who is working on the
theory of diffusional transport as it applies to
containment vessels.

One member has been assigned full-time to the
program on spray effectiveness (Sect. 18) during
its formative stages. A study undertaken by the
Chemical Technology Division at the instigation
of the technical staff has led to a report on the
theory of foam decontamination as it might be
applied to a teactor containment vessel.!

Recently, one man has spent half fime on the
special core melt-through problem assisting the
task force directed by W. K. Ergen. The work

16. Correlations of Fission Product Behavior

THE LIGHT BULB MODEL FOR RELEASE
OF FISSION PRODUCTS

C. E. Milier, Jr.

Experiments in various laboratories and in re-
actors have accumulated much data on release of
fisgion products under conditiens which simulate
reactor accidents. The effects of important vari-
ables on fission product behavior have generally
been recognized, but interpretations of the data
have been at best empirical. The “light bulb”
meodel of fission product release preseanted below
seems fo explain in a simple fashion most, if not
all, of the available release data.

Fonda,’ in studies of the incandescent lamp,
observed that tungsten filaments lost weight (at
a given temperature) more rtapidly in a vacuum
than in the presence of a nonreactive gas. He
related this to Langmuir’s® theory that heat loss
from incandescent wires in gases is controlled by
conduction of heat through a stationary gas film
around the wire., Fonda proposed that evaporation
of material from the filament in a ncareactive gas
is controlled by diffusion through a similar statione-
ary gas layer, If it is assumed that a heated speci-
men of reactor fuel has such a nonreactive gaseous
boundary layer and that diffusion (by Fick’s law)
through this layer controls the rate of release of
fission products, then the theories of Langmuir
and of Fonda may be applied in a straightforward
manner.

If the rate of evaporation of species 4 is con-
trolled by Fick’s law diffusion of 4 through a
boundary layer of species B,

EFFECT OF CONTAINMENT SYSTEM SIZE
ON FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR

G. M. Watson R. B. Perez
M. H. Fontana

Simple mathematical models to aid in the de-
termination of effect of containment size on rate
and extent of deposition of icdine from the gaseous
phase have been postulated. '
of systems (those with and without condensing
steam) have been considered.

In the absence of steam the principal assump-
tions made were: (1) homogeneous mixing within
the gas, (2) boundary gas layer enveloping: all
surfaces, (3) diffusion through this boundary layer
as the rate-limiting process, and (4) icdine present
in the molecular form with combined forms such as
methyl iodide absent. Mathematical relations in
terms of mass transfer coefficients, surface-to-
volume ratios of containers, and surface-character-
ization parameters were developed for cases with
and without desorption from partially covered sur-

In the presence of condensing steam,

cases, it has been assumed that the iodine flux,
which consists of diffusive and bulk f{low com-
ponents, may be approximated by the bulk flow
component alone. Furthermore, it has been as-
sumed that the solubility of iodine in steam con-
densate is high enough to permit the indine and
the steam to condense together with the same

these assumptions, relations have
been derived for the concentration of iodine as a

centrations.

The case of molecular iedine-methyl iodide~

assumed that the deposition of methyl iodide iz
limited by its smaller solubility in steam con-
densate,

Corresponding values for the Containment Mockup
Facility (CMF) and for the Containment Research
Installation (CRI) were obtained by scaling with
size and pressure the NSPP parameters in a man-
ner prescribed by relationships obtained from the
model.  For the asymptotic concentrations, the
surface-chemistiy effects were assumed equal in
all three systems.

An example of the correlation of data obtained
in the absence of steam in the NSPPP and in the
CMF is shown in Fig, 16.1. We can conclude from
the results® that the model predicts the general
behavior of the concentration-time curve in the
absence of steam. It appears quite successful
in the extrapolation of mass transfer coefficients
as indicated by the agreement between the pre
dicted and experimental initial slopes. The neces-
sity for additional research on the surface chem-
istry of containment materials is apparent from
the relatively poor agreement of the asymptotic
concertrations using the simple assumption of
equal surface behavior in all three facilities.

appears to be quite satisfactory.

Based on a very limited number of tests, it
appears that the behavior of jodine in containment
systems differing in size by two orders of magni-
tude may be correlated with moderate success
utilizing simple mathematical relationships.

CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES OF
ORGANIC-IODIDE FORMATION UNDER
NUCLEAR REACTOR ACCIDENT CONDITIONS

R. H. Bames® J. F. Kircher®
C. W. Townley®

The presence of CH,I in nuclear reactor environ-
ments poses a potential hazard because of the dif-
ficulties involved in removing this compound from
gases using conventional trapping techniques.
To gain insight into the chemical processes lead-
ing to CH,I formation, a study was performed of
calculated equilibrium concentrations of CH,I
and other important species for a range of condi-
tions typical of reactor-accident systems. A
report of this work has been issued,’

The results of this study indicated that chemi-
cal systems containing iodine and simple com-
pounds such as COZ, HQO, C2H4, and CH, would
be expected to generate CH, L Such materials are
found as trace pollutants in the atmosphere, even
if some of them are thermodynamically unstable®-®

THE ADEQUACY OF SCALEUP IN
EXPERIMENTS ON FISSION PRODUCT
BEHAVYIOR IN REACTOR ACCIDENTS

C. E. Milles, Jr. W. E. Browning, Jr.

We concluded in a previous report!® that scaling
of experiments on fission product release and
transport in the U.S. Nuclear Safety Program does
not seem adequate; a very large extrapolation
will be necessary to compare presently available
data to that obtained from the projected Loss-of-
Fluid Test (LOFT).!! In a subsequent report'?
we propose experiments at 1 and 10% of the size
of LOFT (based on the mass of fuel) in order to
fill the gap in scaling.

Intermediate-scale experiments to study fission
product release and transport should be designed
so that they (1) generate fission products with
maximum practical realism as a function of various
simulated loss-of-coolant accident environments
and heatup rates and (2) simulate core geometry
sufficiently to achieve proper temperature profiles
and heatup rates, to allow natural movement of
core components during the heatup cycle, and to
provide a realistic escape path for fission products
through remaining core materials.

The characteristics
capabilities should be incorporated into the experi-

following eneral and

ments:

1. The experimenis should be performed in-pile
on multipin fuel subassemblies to give maximum
realism to the time-temperature-position pro-
files.

2. Where possible the experiments should be de-
signed to accommodate water, liquid metal,
and gas-cooled fuel systems.

3. The released fission products should be trans-
ported through a representative primary system
in which the transport rates result from realis-
tic thermal gradients and natural steam flow.

4, Parameters of interest in the experiments are
(1) maximum operating temperature (the experi-
ment should be capable of operating at initial
conditions similar to those of real reactor
operation), (2) core environment (steam, steam-
hydrogen, steam-air), (3) cladding and core
materials, and (4) burnup.

of fuel and cladding, (2) observation of geo-
metrical changes, (3) permanent and temporary
fission product platecut (on fuel materials,
cladding, and ozxidized cladding in the un-
melted part of the fuel subassembly, and on
the walls of the primary, etc.) as a function
of time and temperature in the primary system,
(4) extent of fuel oxidation, fuel melting, and
fuel melting point lowering via eutectic forma-
tion, (5) extent and rate of metal-water reac-
tion, (6) size, (7)
transport as a function of flow (diffusion or

particle fission product
forced), and (8) physical and chemical form of
radioactive aerosols which remain in the gas
phase as a function of time.

Alternative experiments at the same scale using
a nonnuclear method of heating are proposed to
fill the gap in scaling if for reasons of expense or

scheduling the nuclear experiments cannot be
performed. The 1% scale experiment is proposed
for the Containment Research Installation,* and

the 10% scale experiment is proposed for the
Containment Systems Experiment.'® An electrical
method of heating the fuel is proposed, which is
presently under development in an AEC-sponsored
program. '

The capability of performing any of the proposed
experiments appears to be near at hand. All four
facilities are under construction, and the capability

151

of electrical heating is being developed. How-
ever, three of the four possible experiments involve
facilities which are already scheduled for experi-
mental programs. These are the LOFT, CSE, and
CRI facilities. The addition of these proposed
experiments would cause delays in programs which
are very much needed in other phases of nuclear
safety work. The remaining facility, the Power
Burst Facility, which is still to be constructed,
seems the most promising.

With the addition of these experiments to the
AEC Nuclear Safety Program, the comparison of
size of planned nuclear safety experiments will
be as shown in Fig. 16.4. The accomplishment
of these experiments will produce a scaling range
which should cover all possible mechanisms of
fission product behavior and make extrapolation
of data from one experiment to the other more
reliable,

FISSION PRODUCTS FROM FUELS UNDER
REACTOR-TRANSIENT CONDITIONS

G. W. Paiker R. A. Lorenz
J. G. Wilhelm

ORNL fission product telease experiments are per-
formed in the TREAT reactor to study the release
and transport of fission products from fuel during re-
actor transients in which fuel is heated and melts
rapidly. In the cument series of experiments, vari-
ous components of the equipment are designed to
simulate the core, pressure vessel, containment ves-
sel, and the filter and charcoal cleanup system of a
typical large pressurized- or boiling-water power
reactor. Experiments 9, 107, 11Z, and 12Z were
recently completed and repoited in detail else-
where, 2 making a total of six experiments in which
stainless-steel- or Zircaley-2-clad UO, fuel spec-
imens were melted underwater by transient heating.
The letter Z indicates experiments in which
Zircaloy-2 cladding was used. FEach of these ex-
periments used 32 g of 10.7% enriched UO, sin-
tered into pellets 0.400 in. in diameter, with 0.020-
in.-thick cladding. Heat input to the fuel by in-
ternal fissioning during the transient was approx-
imately 520 calories per gram of UOZ; this treat-
ment heated the UO, well above its melting point.

In each experiment a reactor accident was sim-
ulated by first preheating the fuel autoclave to
about 120°C, executing the transieat which melted

generated steam aerosol to leave the fuel auto-

was then heated electrically to abeut 300°C for

fuel autoclaves in the first minute following the

In

transient. In experiments 9 and 10Z, approximately
75% of the water boiled out in the first minute,
and essentially all of the water boiled out of the
11Z and 127 fuel autoclaves in 1 min. These two
latest experiments also explored the effect of
pressure during melting by enclosing the fuel and
water in sealed primary vessels. Experiment 117
used a 300-psi rupture disk to release the steam,
and experiment 12Z used a 2500-psi mupture disk
along with 500 psi of helium as preliminary pres-
surization. Examination of these two experiments
is in progress.

The fuel and cladding melted completely in
experiments 7, 8Z, 9, and 10Z, except for portions
of the metal end caps. The melted residue from
experiments 7 and 9, which used stainless steel
cladding, appeared to be foamy and more porous
than the residue from experiments 8Z and 10Z.
In Fig. 17.1 the firont half of the crucible in ex-
periment 10Z has been removed to reveal some
of the nonporous solidified fuel and cladding
around the sample holder pedestal and some ma-
terial splattered onto the crucible and flux monitor
capsule.

Approximately 24 and 16% of the stainless steel
cladding reacted with steam to form hydrogen in

well with those found by workers at Argonne

in 9 and 10Z is attributed to the faster steam
release. About 1% of the barinm and strontium,
0.3% of the ruthenium, and less than 0.1% of the
cerium, zirconium, and UO, were carried out of
the fuel autoclave with the released steam in each
of the four experiments. The condensation process
was highly efficient in trapping fission products
and UO2 in these experiments; a decontamination
factor of about 10 for nonvolatile materials was
observed. No significant effect of cladding ma-
terial was evident.

In experiments 9 and 10Z, distilled-water rinses
of the fuel autoclave walls contained 33 to 44%
of the total cesium and iodine; this behavior sug-
gested rapid formation of nonvolatile water-soluble
compounds, possibly cesium hydroxide and various
metal iodides.

The amount of unreactive or penetrating iodine
was only a small fraction of the total in all four
experiments. Sixty to eighty percent of the total
1311 was released from the melied fuel specimens,
but only 0.0006 to 0.005% was found on the char-
coal-loaded papers and in the gas collection tank.
This iodine was characterized as unteactive ot
penetrating, based on its poor sorbability in the
bed of 27 charcoal-loaded papers.

accidents. It is intended that the information ob-
tained can be used to predict fission product be-

that hypothetical accidents can be more realis-
tically evaluated.

constiuction work has been under way on the re-
actor facility.

A major construction program has been carried
on during the past year involving the reactor fa-
cility in which the in-pile fission product release
experiments are performed. The modifications are
in line with the emphasis on fission product trans-
port. They include the construction and instal-
lation of a simulated reactor containment vessel,
the installation of on-line analyzers for the de-
termination of water, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon
oxides in the sweep gas, and of increased capa-
bility for temperatiure measurement and control in
the experiment system. A schematic diagram of
the new system is shown in Fig. 17.2. The avail-
ability of this modified facility will allow the
complete study of realistic fission product release,
transport, and behavior in a vessel.

The considerable literature has been examined
in a study of the extent and the rate of sorption
of iodine on a variety of surfaces and possible

components of reactor systems. The practical re-

154

sults of this study, from nuclear safety consider-

ations, are as follows: -

steel with oxide coatings) can be interpreted very

well by mechanisms involving monolayer adsorp-

Sorption of iodine on several materials (no-

tion with dissociation.

2. Absoiption of iodine in water or in aqueous
solutions can be treated by use of models involv-
ing diffusion through boundary layers. Such mech-
anisms for iodine deposition will be important
when surfaces are covered with water films during
steam condensation within a containment vessel.

3. Sorption of iodine on stainless steel and
some other metals covered with an oxide layer
(e.g., as-treceived stainless steel) seems to in-
volve complicated mechanisms and to follow rel- -
atively complex kinetics. Since stainless steel
is likely to be an abundant material in containment
systems, it will be necessary to study the sorp-
tion-desorption process as a function of oxide
thickness and temperature,

IGNITION OF CHARCOAL ADSORBERS

C. E. Miller, Jr. R. P. Shields

Charcoal adsorbers are used in many present and
proposed reactor safety systems to remove iodine
from the containment system atmosphere. The High
Flux Isotope Reactor uses such a safety system.
Such charcoal adsorbers will ignite and burn if
temperatures and air flows are sufficiently high.
Reactor accidents would discharge large quan-
tities of fission products whose radioactive decay
could produce serious overheating (especially in
local hot spots) of the adsorber beds. Such ac-
cidents might also permit air to enter the contain-
ment system and the adsorber bed. Accordingly,
we have initiated a program of tests both in the
laboratory and in-pile to establish the effect of
fission products and of irradiation on the ignition
temperature of charcoal adsorbers.

L.aboratory studies have been conducted primar-
ily with Barnebey-Cheney type KE (BC-KE) and
Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) No. 85851 char-
coals, both of which have been widely used in
adsorbers. The data from small-scale investiga-
tions of these materials show that ignition tem-
perafures vary somewhat for various lots of the
same charcoal; initial ignition temperatures dif-
fered by 30°C for two lots of MSA charcoal, while
subsequent ignition temperatures differed by 15
to 20°C. Ignition temperatures seem independent
of apparatus material (glass or metals such as
stainless steel) and of tubing size over the small
range (0.5 and 0.7 in. in diameter) studied. Initial
ignition temperature was unaffected by change in
air flow rate from 20 to 40 fpm, but subsequent
ignition occurred at temperatures 10 to 15°C lower
at the higher flow rates. Ignition temperatures
were lowered measurably (about 6°C) when moist
air was substituted for dry air at the same veloc-
ity.  The ignition temperatures for the BC-KE
charcoals were increased by addition of iodine.

A most important finding in this study is that
charcoal from adsorbers which had been in service
for one year on the NS “Savannah’’ showed igni-
tion temperatures 150 to 200°C lower than unex-
posed samples of the same charcoal. The reason
for this difference is not yet known.

155

In-pile tests have been conducted in an experi-
mental unit (see Fig. 17.3) designed for use in
the fuel melting facility in the ORR. This facility
and the first in-pile ignition test of this series
were described in a previous report.® A total of
100 ignitions have been performed with ten ignition
cycles per position. Countrol of the position of the
U0, cylinder (from which fission products were
emitted to the charcoal adsorber) permitted study
at three levels of fission product concentration in
the charcoal; iodine concentrations cormesponded
to 4.3, 5.0, and 7.0 w per square inch of charcoal
surface. These energy release rates are greater
by a factor of 8 than those expected in HFIR,
LOFT, or NPR adsotbets.

Ignition temperatures for the in-pile experiments
differed in several regards from those observed
in the laboratory experiments. Typical experiments
with & BC-KE charcoal showed that initial igni-
tion, which took place after the iodines were at
equilibrium, occurred at 336°C; this value is not
significantly different from the value 341°C which
is the average of ten fast ignitions in the same
apparatus out-of-pile. However, subseguent igni-
tions in the in-pile assembly occurred at tempera-
tures up to 40°C higher. This increase in ignition
temperature (which is quite unlike the laboratory
behavior) persisted even after the unit was re-
tracted to stop fission product (and jodine) gen-
eration. When an in-pile ignition experiment was
resumed (in the retracted position) after a 45-day
lapse following an equipment malfunction, the
ignition temperature remained at some 20°C above
its laboratory value, even though virtually all
iodine activity had decayed. Some factor in addi-
tion to iodine and the short-lived fission products
seems respensible for a part of this temperature
increase.

Future in-pile experiments will be performed to
study the ignition temperature behavior of high-
ignition charcoals and impregnated charcoals, In
these experiments a controller will be used to
reproducibly control the heating rate of the ad-
sorber. Future out-of-pile experiments will include
the further development of a standard ignition ap-
paratus and the study of ignition characteristics of
various charcoals.

The previous report® gave results of an experi-
ment performed in the Containment Mockup Facility
(CMF) with stainless-steel-clad UO, irradiated to
a burnup of 1000 Mwd/ton. Data obtained in a
similar experiment (run 4-11) with Zircaloy-clad
UC, irradiated to a burnup of 7000 Mwd/ton are
reported below.

The conditions used in this experiment were
quite close to those prevailing in the previous
high-burnup experiment.® The total pressure in
the CMF, furnished by a mixture of air and steam,
was about 29 psig before heating the fuel. Heating
of the fuel was started with a mixtare of steam
and air flowing through the pressurized furnace
tube, but steam flow was discontinued before the
fuel temperature reached an estimated 2200°C be-
cause of steam condensation in the furnace tube.
Dry air flow continued during the balance of the
heating period (10 min total) and for 20 min there-
after. During most of the 20-min cooling period,
bumning of the specimen was obsetved at irregular
intervals; such behavior has been observed with
previous Zircaloy-clad UO, specimens that had
been melted and then cooled in air.

The distribution of iodine observed in this ex-
periment is compared in Table 17.1 with the data
obtained with the 1000 Mwd/ton burnup fuel® (run
10-29). The distribution of four other important
fission products is similarly compared in Table
17.2. 1In both tables the observed differences are
not large enough to be considered significant
without further, confirmatory, data. The high trans-
port of iodine observed in the 7000 Mwd/ton experi-
ment (21.6% as compared with 9% for the 1000
Mwd/ton experiment and 6 to 10% in simulant ex-
periments) was an unexpectedly large difference.
The difference in iodine collection on plateout
samples is due, at least in part, to a larger number
of painted carbon-steel samples in run 4-11 as
compared with run 10-29. There appears to be no
obvious explanation for the smaller fraction of

 

iodine in the condensate in the 7000 Mwd/ton
experiment.

BEHAVIOR OF ﬁz AND Hi IN THE CONTAINMENT
RESEARCH INSTALLATION TANK
G. W. Parker G.

The Containment Research Installation (CRI)
has been constiucted at Oak Ridge National Lab-
oratory for the investigation of fission product
release, transport, and plateout as a function of
burnup, fuel and containment temperature, time
at temperature, and atmospheric and containment
sutface composition.

The primary objective of the initial experiments
in the CRI was to compare the deposition behavior
of molecular iodine (run 100) and HI (run 101) in
a stainless steel system under ambient conditions
of temperature and humidity and an internal air
pressure of 30 psig.

In run 100 an initial concentration of 2 mg/i'n3

1301 was intro-

of elemental iodine tagged with
duced into the CRI containment vessel by com-
pressing a thin-wall stainless steel tube which
contained an iodine-filled glass ampule. An air
stream passed through the heated tube for 12 min

to transport iodine to the containiment vessel.

sampling data, which show that the rate of deposi-
tion of HI over the first 3 hr was faster than that
of I, in run 100. The slower deposition rate after
3 hr possibly indicates that the HI has changed
the adsorption characteristics of the stainless
steel surfaces, rendering them wmore inactive, or
that it reacted to give an unidentified form of
iodine which was only slightly reactive with the

This program is intended to advance the tech-
nology of removal of fission product gases and
colloidal dispersions by adsorption and filtration
techniques in order to increase the confidence
in the reliability of the effectiveness of various
air cleaning systems unader accident conditions.
As this confidence is achieved, a wider acceptance
of air cleaning systems as engineered safeguards
will be accomplished.

Results of these studies are reporied in detail
elsewhere. ?
niques have been reported previously.®'* Briefly,
a reproducible aerosol containing stainless steel
and oxides of uranium is used for these tests.
The test aerosol is prepared by striking an elec-
tric atc between electrodes consisting of UO,
(with thoriated tungsten) and a stainless steel
tube packed with UO,. Under diy conditions the
test aerosol (median size of primary paiticles
0.018 p) is easily filtered out of air streams by
any of the so-called ‘‘high-efficiency (absolute)”’

Prior experiments at room temperature have shown
that a moist atmosphere may reduce the efficiency
of the same filter medium toward the same test
acrosol to as low as 23% under ~95% relative
humidity.

The effect of moisiure had not been anticipated
by reactor designers, aand, because of its impli-
cations in case of reactor accidents, recent re-
search efforts have been directed toward defining
the mechanism of moisture in reducing filtration
efficiency. The effect of moisture may be due
to changes in the properties of the acrosol, changes
in the {ilter media, or both.

A difference has been noted in the physical
characteristics of asrosols produced under humid
and under diy conditions. Election photomicro-
giraphs of an aerosol produced under high relative
humidity reveal that the particles are covered with
a thin film of unknown composition and that ag-
glomerates are in the form of chains (Fig. 18.1)
rather than clusters as observed under diy con-
ditions. Evidently the stability and filtration char-
acteristics of these two types of aercsols differ
in some respects.

Tests have established that activity profiles
obtained by filtration of wmoist and div aerosols
through fibrous-filter analyzers ate guite different.
In a drv atmosphere as much as 90% of the aerosol
passed through the fibrous-filter analyzer is re-
tained on the fiist fiber mat, whereas under high
humidity conditions a flat activity profile is ob-
tained as a result of more even distribution of
on the successive fiber mats. Inter-
pretation of results under wet conditions can be
taken to mean that the fibrous filter mat efficien-

particles

cies ate being reduced, or moisture is affecting
the aerosol in some way, making it more difficult
to filter, or both. In any case, a flat distribution
of particles through the filter pack would result.

ments was made in which an aerosol generated
in a high-humidity air atmosphere was sampled
by two filter packs. One pack was held at room
temperature, and the fibers were saturated with
water vapor from the high-humidity carrier gas.
To reduce the moisture content of the fibers, the
other pack was heated to 100°C under similar
conditions. In another set of experiments the
acrosol was generated in a dry air atmosphere and
once more sampled with two packs. One pack
was dry, and the other was wetted by pretreating
it with 90% relative humidity air immediately prior
to its use in an experiment. The conclusion
drawn from these experiments was that moisture
does not affect the efficiency of a fibrous filter
but that it influences the physical properties of
the acrosol, making it more difficult to filter.
However, not all the results from these experi-
ments were equally unambiguous. At aeirosol con-
centrations estimated to be at the level of 10°
nuclei/cm?, the activity profile obtained in the
presence of a wet atmosphere was not character-
istically flat. It is probable that at these higher
concentrations, agglomeration will occur regardless

EXAMINATION OF PARTICULATE AEROSOLS
WITH THE FIBROUS-FILTER AMALYZER

The fibrous-filter analyzer (FFA) is being de-
veloped for measuring the characteristics of ra-
dioactive azerosols in terms of their response to
filtration processes by determining their distri-
bution vs depth in a filter under carefully con-

trolled conditions. Moisture does not significantly

162

affect the peiformance of the FFA, although the
test aerosol itself was affected. The filtration
efficiency data agreed well with the theoretical
treatment of filtration developed by Torgeson. The
analyzer was calibrated against particles 150 to
1500 A in diameter, measured by electron micros-
copy.

A summary report on this project has been com-
pleted,® and only a brief review of the subject
material will be presented here.

The FFA is an “‘in situ’’ analytical device
which characterizes radioactive aerosols dynam-
ically by particle respoiise to the major processes
of filtration: diffusion, inteiception, and inertial
impaction. The concept of the FFA ocriginated
from a note by Sisefsky,® who determined the
penetration of ‘‘fallout’’ material in a commercial
filter by radioassay by peeling off layers of the
filters with pressure-sensitive cellophane tape.
By contrast, the fibrous-filter analyzer is made
from uniform-diameter Dacron fiber (which is formed
into a uniform web by a carding maching) into a
layered structure to facilitate separation of the
fiber bed into disctete layers for radioassay. The
test aerosol containing ®3Zn was produced by
using a Tesla coil to generate a spark between
two preirradiated zinc electrodes. A stream of
air passing over the electrodes carried the aerosol
through the system containing the filters. Elec-
tron micrographs of samples of the aerosol col-
lected on carbon-covered Millipore membrane filters
yielded information regarding the size of the par-
ticles. Depending on the experimental conditions,
acrosols have been prepared over the size range
50 to 10,000 A (0.05to 1 u).

The data were analyzed graphically by means
of the Chen equation’ to estimate single-fiber
efficiencies. These were compared with thecretical
fiber efficiencies calculated according to Torge-
who used an adaptation of Davies’?

theory was selected by Whitby!? as that which
agreed most closely with experimental data ac-
cumulated in numerous researches. A computer
program developed specifically for these FFA
calculations is given in Appendix II of the sum-
mary report, >

Calibration of the FFA was performed by com-
paring particle sizes estimated from electron pho-
tomicrographs of the inlet and outlet aerosols with
those calculated according to the Torgeson treat-
ment. The best correlations were observed in
dry experiments and at low velocities. Additional
calibrations will be performed at the University
of Minnesota under a subcontract.

DISTINGUISHING iODINE FORMS
AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITIES

R. L.. Bennett
W. H. Hinds

R. E. Adams
Zell Combs

In the event of a nuclear accident, radioiodine
is the most hazardous fission product which may
be released. lodine may exist in elemental or in
chemically combined species in molecular form
or as aerosols dispersed on particulate material
from the fuel or structural members of the reactor
core. The various species exhibit different be-
havior toward removal, and information is needed
on their behavior in order to design adequate gas
cleaning systems. A program is in progress to
develop tools for distinguishing the various vapor
forms of iodine which occur in the laboratory and
in larger-scale experiments. The identifying de-
vices should be capable of remote operation and
pteferably should keep their effectiveness under
extreme conditions of temperature and humidity
that may occur in a reactor accident.

The analytical devices most commonly used for
radioiodine studies are composite diffusion tubes
and May packs. The adverse effects of high
humidity on the respoanse of diffusion tubes and
the application of selective desiccants and im-
pregnated charcoal linings in improving their per-
formance have been reported.'!''?  Extensive
tests of May packs under elevated temperatures
and high-humidity conditions, such as those ex-
pected in the LLOFT experiments, are in progress.

 

19, T. Whitby, ASHRAE J. 7(9), 5665 (1965).

The May pack is an assembly of filter materials
and adsotbent beds intended to separate iodine
forms of different reactivity or adsorption tend-
ency. Since high specificity is difficult to ob-
tain for wide ranges of temperature and humidity,
considerable testing is needed to establish the
range of reliability of the optimum components
of the pack. Initial emphasis has been placed
on a configuration suggested for the LOFT pro-
gram. This arrangement consists of a sequence
of three high-efficiency filters, eight silver screens,
five charcoal-impregnated filters, two 3/j‘—in, char-
coal beds, and finally one more high-efficiency
filter section. The initial filter section is in-
tended to remove particulate forms of iodine, the
silver screens remove elemental iodine, and the
charcoal filters retain the iodine species which
are not removed by the silver screens but which
are easily adsorbed by charcoal-impregnated filter
papers. The more penetrating forms, such as
methyl iodide, are adsorbed in the charcoal beds.
The last high-efficiency filter section is designed
to trap any charcoal particles which might be
dislodged from the beds.

Duplicate May packs were usually tested with
two associated diffusion tube assemblies,
at room temperature under dry conditions and the
other at the same conditions as the May packs.
The tests were made at 90°C with a superficial
face velocity of 10 fpm. Dry or 90% relative-
humidity air streams were used in tests with
elemental iodine and methyl iodide.

Results and discussion of 2 large number of
these tests have been reported. 13

Briefly, the effect of moisture on penetration
of methyl iodide into the pack is illustrated in
Fig. 18.2. Under dry conditions the CH,I was
about evenly distributed between the charcoal-
loaded filters and the first chawcoal bed, while
at 90% relative humidity most of the CH,I was
swept into the beds. The sharp separation of a

REACTIONS OF {ODINE YAPOR
WITH ORGANIC MATERIALS

When radioiodine is released into & closed en-
vironment, such as in a containment test facility,
it has been noted that a generally small, but pos-
sibly significant, fraction may appear in the form
of methyl iodide and other alkyl icdides.!* -In
an accident situation, methyl iodide may be formed
in the containment atmosphere by gas-phase re-
actions with organic contaminants, or on the var-
ious types of surfaces within the containment
vessal with subsequent desorption into the gas
phaze. This investigation, which is an extension
of some earlier efforts,?5'1% iz concerned with
the methods of formation of methyl iodides to
avoid, if possible, conditions or materials con-
ducive to its fermation in a reactor systewm.

Possible reactions beiween painted surfaces and
elemental iodine to produce methyl iodide have
been investigated.

Preliminary work has been done using gas chro-
matography, with electron capture detectors for
analysis of the reaction products. Calibration
of methyl iodide response has been made with
samples in the gas and in the liguid phase (cy-
clohexane).

The first experiments were performed using a
reaction vessel painted with two coats of Amercoat
64 primer and two coats of Amercoat 66 seal coat

chtomatograms with about six major peaks, none
of which fell near the methyl iodide peak. About
1 mg of elemental iodine was placed in another
painted vessel and heated at 100°C. Chroma-

about 107° mg. Additional studies will be made

also be employed to investigate the reaction of
iodine with trace organic components in the gas

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS
IN GAS-LIQUID SYSTEMS

R. E. Adams B. A. Soldano
W. T. Ward

Removal of fission product dispersions from
containment atmospheres by application of liguid
systems has been proposed as an engineered safe-
guard. Examples of these systems are pressure
suppression pools and containment sprays. An
experimental program has been initiated to study
both the chemical and physical aspects of such
gas-liquid systems. A study of the adsorption
of gases, or particles in gases, by a liquid in a
spray system involves a situation wherein there
exists a large amount of gas and a relatively small
amount of liguid under highly dynamic conditions.
On the other hand, a study of fission product
trapping in a pressuare suppréssion pool represents
a situation in which there is a very large amount
of water under relatively static conditions in con-
tact with a small amount of gas. Since the two
systems involve the two extremes of the gas-
liguid spectrum, the study has been divided into
two parts. This dualistic approach will hopefully
permit extrapolation of information to intermediate
conditions and will allow one to {ix experimental
conditions such that a chemical-physical descrip-
tion of our experiments becomes feasible.

An experimental study of the efficacy of water
sprays in the removal of released fission products
in reactor containment vessels requires a knowl-
edge of the hydrodynamics of these systems as
well as an understanding of their kinematic be-
havior. Since single liquid drops under highly
dynamic conditions constilute a primary element
of the spray itself, we propose to study the be-
havior of liquid drops suspended in a low-velocity
wind 1.7  Such a tupnel can be used to
simulate the gas-liquid environment accompanying
a fission release accident. Some of the pertinent
variables are drop size, height of fall, time of
contact, composition of both gas and liquid phases,
pressure, temperature, and the volume of tunnel

tunne

gases,
The advantages of a wind tunnel in such dy-
namic studies aze, in part, as follows:

1. The time of contact of each drop with the gas
streaim can be widely varied.

2. Drops suspended by the gas stream in the tun-
nel can be directly observed and photographed
so that shape and oscillation factors can be
properly accounted for.

Random convection effects are eliminated.

4. Close temperature control can be achieved in
the working area.

5. Homogeneity of the gas mixtures and therefore
reproducibility of results is, in principle, at-
tainable with such a probe.

The second part of this program involves a study
of the behavior of fission products in a pressure
suppression pool. General Electric Company is
incorporating such pools in their design of com-
mercial power reactors and, for this reason, is
conducting research into the behavior of suppies-
sion pools during and subsequent to a reactor
accident. Negotiations are under way with General
Electric, San Jose, for a subcoitract under which
they would perform theoretical ana laboratory in-
vestigations of the effectiveness of pressure sup-
pression pools for fission product trapping.

At present, engineering designs have been com-
pleted on both the wind tunnel and the supporting
drop collection equipment. It is estimated that
approximately 75% of the paris have been fabri-
cated.

Prior to initiation of the wind tunnel! investi-
gation, studies were undertaken to determine the
efficiency of various solutions in removing methyl
iodide from air. The experimental procedure con-

through a 1 1/2—1'n.—diam glass column containing 800
ml of the solution at approximately 25°C (depth
of solution = 28 in.) for approximately 2 hr, fol-
lowed by a “‘clean’ air sparge of from 16 to 20 hr.
The air entering the bottom of the column is
dispersed through a porous glass disk. The air
leaving the column is passed through two or three
beds of iodine-impregnated activated charcoal to
remove the methyl iodide that is not captured by
the solution. lodine-131 tracer is used; the ra-
dioactivity of the charcoal and solution indicates
the iodine distribution. All the activity on the
charcoal was found to be in the first bed.

A comparison of the efficiencies of the various
solutions tested to date is given in Table 18.1.
Tests of other solutions are planned, as well as
tests to determine the effect of increasing the
temperature.

OF GAS-BORNE FISSION PRODUCTS.
TELLURIUM DIOXIDE

M. D. Silverman A. P Malinauskas

Recent experimental studies'® indicate an en-
hanced volatility of a rather broad class of metal
oxides in the presence of water vapor. This en-
hancement is believed to be the result of the
generalized reaction

oxide(s) + H,0(g) = hydroxide(g) , (1)

in which the hydroxide so formed is stable only
at high temperatures. The present investigations
are directed toward a study of this reaction.

The research has been initiated using tellurium
dioxide, TeQ,, as the compound under investi-
gation. Although reaction (1) has yet to be un-
equivocally established in this case, the increase
in the apparent vapor pressure, due to water vapor,
has been experimentally demonstrated over the
temperature range 600 to 700°C. /1% Qur imme-
diate objective is to verily these data and to
extend the temperature range.

The transport method (also called the “transfec®’
or ““trauspiration’ method) has been chosen for
In brief, the pro-
cedure involves saturating a suitable carrier gas
with the material under study in one section of
the apparatus and allowing this substance to be
transported and collected in another region. A
detailed description of the experimental and the-
oretical aspects can be found elsewhere, '8—%0

Since the program has only recently been ini-
tiated, much of the work has been concerned thus
far with the design, construction, and testing of
the apparatus itself. Data obtained from two of

THE CASCADE IMPACTOR AS A TOOL
FOR THE 5TUDY OF SIZE DISTRIBUTION
OF FISSION PRODUCT AEROSOLS

G. W. Parker H. Buchholz??

Cascade 22 are instruments used to

separate aerosols into fractions of a discrete range
of particle size. They are frequently used for
analyzing radioactive aerosols to collect a range
of size groups which may later be examined for

their radioactivity. Several thecretical and ex-
perimental studies of cascade impactors have been
reported. 23727 Impactors are limited to relatively
large particles, usually above 0.5 g, and, in order
to make this instrument genuinely useful in nu-
clear safety research, it is necessary to extend
their range to particles below 0.1 u. The basic
theory of these devices is quite simple. When
a gas jet carrying particles is directed toward a
surtace, all particles having sufficient inertia in
the first stape will leave their stream lines . and
settle on the sutface. Smaller particles will re-
main within the jet stream. In the cext stage the

accelerated to a higher velocity. The probability
of smaller particles settling is thus increased.

If the pressure within the cascade impactor is
lowered until the particle diameter is comparable
to the mean free path of the gas molecules, there
are fewer collisions between particles and gas

molecules. Particles having small inertia are able

under reduced pressure to leave the jet. By this
slip effect, described by the Cunningham correction,
the cascade impactor becomes more efficient for
separating smaller particles. Using an equation

of particles that have a 50% probability of de-
positing on each stage of the Andersen sampler.

REACTION OF MOLECULAR IODINE
AND OF METHYL {ODIDE
WITH SODIUM THIOSULFATE SPRAYS

G. W. Parker
W. J. Martin

G. E. Creek
N. R. Horton

Addition of chemicals to water used in reactor
containment misting sprays to aid in the rapid
scavenging of radioiodine from steam-filled reactor
coitainment shells has been proposed in many
recent applications for power reactor construction
permits presented to the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. Pure water sprays do.not provide the de-
sired iodine removal rate.

The removal of heat in most latge reactor de-
signs is effected primarily by ait-recirculation
cooling units, and the removal of inorganic vapor
forms of jodine (I, and HI) is the major require-
ment of the sprays. Griffiths *® described a method
for predicting the rate of iodine removal from
gases by sprays and presented most of the pa-
rameters for making such calculations in a com-
prehensive report which was summarized in Nuclear
Safety.?? The most useful experimental exami-
nation of Griffiths’ theory was performed by Tay-
lor, % using glass columns in which he varied
both the liquid flow rate and the gas velocity.
From these experiments the mass transfer process
through the liquid film was confirmed. It is clear
that elemental iodine, as it is absorbed by a

liguid drop containing reducing material, is chemi-
cally altered to the form of iodide by the reducing
agent. Thus, there is a sharp reduction in the
vapor pressute of iodine near the liquid surface,
and, since the total gquantity of iodine available
from a reactor is almost negligible (by comparison
with the quantity of reducing agent in the spray),
there is essentially no change in efficiency as
the drop continues to fall. The iodine present
as HI is even more soluble in the droplet, and
it should be removed at a faster rate than [,.

In order to test the spray removal concept under
conditions used in fission product transport studies
and in order to be able to assess the limitations
of the process for the nonreactive forms of iodine,
we decided to carmry out spray experiments in the
Containment Mockup Facility (CMF) with charac-
teristic forms of radioiodine. The design of the
spray system allowed very small gquantities of
liquid to be used, and therefore the liquid-to-gas
ratio could be adjusted to reactor containment pro-
portions.

The spray system chosen for test contained six
atomizing nozzles, each of which delivered 0.1
liter/min at 80 psig. Since the test containment
was small (180 liters), the sprays were generally
operated for only 15 to 30 sec. Operation fot
30 sec produced a liguid volume of 0.3 liter or
1/600 of the containment tank volume. A con-
centration of Na,§,0, of 0.1 mole/liter (1.6%)
was used in these tests.

Test with Molecular lodine (1,)

The conditions selected for the molecular io-
dine test were typical of those used in previous
CMF steam-air runs. The initial pressure was
about 35 psig, of which about 20 psig was due
to steam. The tank atmosphere temperature was
about 130°C at the injection time, and the cooling
rate without sprays was about 30°%hr. Since the
natural removal rate for molecular iodine in the
CMEF (fuz = 30 min) was fairly well known, the
effect of thiosulfate sprays on the removal rate
could be readily calculated. We found that ad-
dition of sodium thiosulfate spray at a rate of
1/300 of the containment tank volume per minute
decreased the half-life of disappearance of Izlfrom
the tank atmosphere to 3.9 sec. This value agreed
quite well with the calculated value of 2.6 sec
for the half-time of removal of 1, by 200-u droplets
of 0.1 mNa,S,0,.
Tests with Methyl lodide (CH3I)

In two experiments conducted in a similar man-
ner to the molecular iodine experiment described
above, methyl iodide injected at similar concen-
trations (2 mg/m>) was first exposed to steam
and to the condensation process and then to
sodium thiosulfate spray. The results were en-
couraging, but the rate of removal of CH,I is
only a fraction of the corresponding iodine rate.
However, the CH ,I removal rate is of sufficient
magnitude to warrant its consideration in safety
The calculated half-times
for depletion of CH.I were approximately 2 hr in
one run and 4 hr in the other.

Tests of methyl iodide removal with Na,S 0,

slower removal rates than the corresponding io-

the NSPP.3% The simulation technique devised
for the CSE experiments, described by Hilliard
and McCormack,** iavolves vaporization of suit-
able quantities of fission product elements con-
taining radioactive tracers and passing the vapor
over molten unirradiated UO, before it enters the
containment vessel. In order to determine how
well the aerosols produced by this teclinique imi-

tate those produced by overheated high-burnup

fuel, it will be necessary to make direct com-
parisons under similar conditions. We plan to
do this in the CMF, where experiments with

high-burnup fuel have already been performed, and
perhaps later in the Containment Research Instal-
lation (CRI).

We have completed the design, construction, and
preliminary testing of equipment for performing
CSE-type simulation experiments either in the CMF
or the CRI (the fuel-melting cans of these sys-
tems are interchangeable). It was necessary to
modify the experimental arrangement described
by Hilliard and McCormack®* rather extensively
in order to adapt it to the CMF-CRI fuel meltdown
arrangement, but the differences relate mainly to
methods of getting the vaporized materials into
the pressurized meltdown furnace. In addition,
we chose to provide a steam-air environment in
the vicinity of the molten UO, and in the con-
tainment tank, both at 30 1b total pressure, rather
than air, because our recent experimeits with
high-burnup fuel were all carried out using a steam-
air atmosphere.

As shown by Fig. 18.5, two ribbon heating units
are inserted through the glass envelope, which
is fitted to the end of the quartz meltdown tube
by means of a tapered joint. A platinum ribbon
which can be operated at a temperature between
1400 and 160C°C in the furnace tube atmosphere
will be used to vaporize tellurium (in the form
of TeO,), cesium (intioduced as Cs,CO,), and
ruthenium metal. Cesium will probably be vapor-
ized as the metal but will quickly be reoxidized
in the furnace atmosphere. Ruthenium metal will
undoubtedly be converted to a volatile oxide, RuO,

Iodine in the form of I, is introduced through
a side arm attached to the outside pressurized

is crushed while a stream of air flows through
the tube to carry the iodine into the inner (fur-
nace) tube.

Finally, steam is introduced through a ball joint
at the end of the glass envelope. Water supplied
under pressure at a carefully controlled rate is
converted to steam by a miniature water vaporizer
located in the outer pressurized shell, quite close
to the ball-joint entrance to the furnace tube.

Preliminary testing has centered on achieving
satisfactory volatilization of barium, the least
volatile species expected to be used in these ex-
periments. We found that a temperature of 1800°C
was needed to volatize half the barium activity
from a BaCO -Zr mixture in a flowing helium at-
mosphere.

RETENTION OF RADIOACTIVE METHYL

Methy! iodide, which is more difficult to trap
than elemental iodine, may be generated in re-
actor accidents. It readily penetrates beds of
the common types of activated charcoal at ambient
temperatures except when the relative humidity
is low. However, certain specially impregnated
(iodized) charcoals have been observed to have the
capability of effectively trapping radoactive methyl
iodide from air streams of fairly high relative hu-
midity at temperatures as high as 115°F.37:38

or more iodine-containing substances, appear to
possess this unusual capability as the result of
an isotopic exchainge mechanism. ‘To obtain in-
formation pertaining to the applicability of im-
pregnated charcoals under various reactor accident
situations is the objective of this work, which
has been reported in more detail elsewhere. 3940

A rather large number of screening tests on
various laboratory-impregnated charcoals and on
various types of commercially impregnated char-
coal were performed. The manner of conducting
these tests is illustrated in Fig. 18.6. The tests
are made at ambient temperature and pressure
and usually at around 70% relative humidity. Four
commercial products were cbserved to be effective
for CH,'*'l trapping. They arc BC-727 (from
Barnebey-Cheney), MSA-85851 and MSA-24207 (from
Mine Safety Appliances Company), and G601 (from
North American Casbon, Inc.). Results from these
room-temperatuie tests for the four commercial
charcoals are given in Table 18.3. A number of
laboratory-impregnated charcoals also gave prom-
ising results, although at present none of them
are regarded to have ainy especial advantage over
the commercial charcoals mentioned.

The conditions corresponding to the earlier
tests>® and those discussed above are less severe
than the conditions which have been postulated

in Fig. 18.7, where the deleterious effect of very
high relative humidity is displayed. The use of
charcoal laboratory impregnated with triethylene-
