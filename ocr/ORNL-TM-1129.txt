LITHIUM FLUORIDE~-BERYIIIUM FLUORIDE BY EQUILIBRATION WITH
GASEQUS WATER-HYDROGEN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

A. L. Mathews C. F. Baes, Jr.

ABSTRACT

The transpiration method was used to equilibrate dilute
gaseous mixtures of HF and H20 in hydrogen carrier gas with
molten LiF-BeF; mixtures varying in composition from 0.25 to
0.80 ReF2, both saturated and unsaturated with crystalline
BeO, in the temperature range 500 to 700°C. The partial pres-
sure data were used to evaluate the equilibrium quotient for
the reaction of HF and Hz0 with solid BeO and dissolved BeFz.
Bquilibrium quotients were also obtained for the formation of
oxide and hydroxide ions in the liquid phase.

These equilibrium gquotients were employed to determine:
(1) thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeFz in the mixtures;
(2) thermodynamics of liquid BeFa; (3) stability of hydroxide
in the melt; and (4) solubility of BeO in the LiF-BeF2 system
as a function of temperature.

 

I. INTRODUCTION

Molten mixtures of LiF and BeFz have been the subject of numerous
investigations in recent years primarily because of their suitability as
a carrier solvent for UFg in fluid fueled nuclear reactors. In addition,
these solutions are especially worthy of study because the components -
highly ionic IiF and highly associated, more covalent BeFz - represent
extreme types of fluoride salts. Although the molten LiF-BeFz system has
received considerable attention from both a practical and a theoretical
point of view, the study of its chemistry is still far from complete.
According to Everest,l many of the investigations of beryllium fluoride
systems did not take into account the role of moisture and the resulting
hydrolysis products. If this information were available, future investi-

gators could make appropriate experimental adjustments and corrections.
The purpose of the present investigation was to study heterogeneous
reactions of the type
Hao0(g) + fluoride species(soln)’=t HF(g) + oxygen species(soln)
in the molten LiF-Bel, system. From such a study information could in
principle be obtained about: (1) the thermodynamic activities of LiF and
BeF2, (2) the solubilities and stabilities of oxides, and (3) the inter-
action of oxide with the proton and perheps other cations in this molten
fluoride system. Information about the chemical reactivity of the compo-
nents in the molten LiF-BeF; system could be obtained from the thermodynamic
activities of LiF and Belz. The oxide chemistry of this system is of
interest because oxide is a principal impurity to be dealt with in prepara-
tive work and because metal oxides are known to be only sparingly soluble
in LiF-Bel'z mixtures.

The presence of oxide species in the molten IiF-BeF; system, which
is currently being used as the solvent in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experi-
ment at ORNL, constitutes an undesirable impurity since inadvertent pre-
cipitation of sparingly soluble uranium (and other) oxides might result
in unstable reactor operation. One of the steps in the purification of
melts for reactor operation is sparging with a mixture of HF and Hp to
remove oxide. The present study of the equilibria involved would yield
additional guidelines for this treatment.

The reactivity of oxide with beryllium and other cations has been
investigated as a possible means of removal of reactor products, or of
uranium to be reprocessed for later use. In order for proper evaluation
of these methods to be carried out, a thorough understanding of the inter-

actions occurring in melts would be desirable. For example, the use of
H20 as the source of reactive oxygen for oxide precipitating schemes and
the use of HF for removal of oxide require that the stability of the inter-
mediate hydroxide be evaluated in the melts.

In the present study the transpiration method was used to equilibrate
dilute gaseous mixtures of HF and H20 in hydrogen carrier gas with molten
LiF-BeF, mixtures varying in composition from 0.25 to 0.80 BeFz, both sat-
urated and unsaturated with crystalline BeO, in the temperature range 500
to 700°C. The primary data from the measurements were used to evaluate
the equilibrium quotient for the reaction of HF and H20 with solid BeO and
dissolved BeFz. Equilibrium quotients were also obtained for the formation
of oxide and hydroxide ions in the liquid phase. These quantities in turn
could be used to obtain the thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeFy as
well as the solubility of BeO and the stability of hydroxide. Use of the
HF-H20 equilibria as a much needed analytical tool for the determination

of oxide in such melts was also indicated.
Physical Properties of the LiF-BeFz System

Beryllium fluoride is frequently found in the form of a glass rather
than a crystalline solid. The beryllium fluoride glass consists of a ran-
dom network structure in which the beryllium atoms are surrounded tetra-
hedrally by four fluorine atoms and each fluorine atom by two beryllium
atoms.l Iiquid beryliium fluoride retains the polymeric character of the
glass as indicated by its high viscosity. In contrast to the covalent
nature of beryllium fluoride, lithium fluoride is a highly ionic salt.

The addition of LiF to liquid BeFz causes a breaking down of the polymeric

structure, but apparently the tetrahedral BeF42™ groups are retained.
Although it isn't proof of structure in the liquid phase, the fact that
a compound LipBeF,; can be precipitated from the melt may be some indica-
tion of the short range order in the liquid phase.

Phase behavior of the LiF-BeF; system has been studied extensively
by Thomsa., gg_gl.z A copy of their published diagram.(Figure 1) is included
here to illustrate the major characteristics of the system.

The melting point of BeFz is 548°C; the melting point of LiF is 848°cC.
The liquidus temperatures for the BeFz-rich region have been difficult to
obtain because of the high viscosity of these solu.‘bions-3 A brief summary
of the phase studies of various BeF; systems is included in reference l.
Many of these systems parallel those of the much higher melting silicate
glasses.

Studies of the LiF-BeF; system in the temperature range of the pres-
ent work (500 to 700°C) are restricted to the region between the high
ligquidus temperatures at low BeF2 concentrations and high viscosity at

high BeF concentrations.

Thermodynamic Properties of the Various Possible Species

From previous studies of LiF, BeF2, and the other possible species
present, some information can be drawn about the expected behavior of the
system. The thermochemical data for BeF; are summarized in the JANAF
Tables.* There is considerable uncertainty in aH,” of BeFa(1), which vas
derived from the AH_.°

£ 298.15
capacity functions for both the solid and liquid phases. Two sources

for the crystal and the appropriate heat

of error were cited in JANAF. The heat capacity studies were made on
samples of BeF2 which contained BeO and Hz0. Also, the heat of fusion

is uncertain. The value of 2 kecal/mole was used in the tabulation (be-
cause of the similarity of BeFz glass to B203 and Si02) even though a
value of 12.9 kcal/mole was determined from the vapor pressures over solid
and liquid BeFs. Determination of AH%O of Bng(l) would help resolve same
of these difficulties.

The thermochemical properties of BeFa(g) have been based on proper-
ties of the liquid and the heat of vaporization of BeF2(1l) except for the
work of Greenbaum, EE,EQ‘5 who determined equilibrium constants for the
reaction
BeO(s) + 2HF(g) = BeFa(g) + Ha20(g)
over the temperature range 670 to 970°¢. They report that a @lot of log
K vs 1/T yields a least squares slope corresponding to 20.5 * 1.7 keal/mole
for AH} over the temperature range studied, and that a plot of AF} vs T
gives a value of 6.0 * 0.3 cal deg™* mole™* for ASr by a least squares
analysis. If the calculated line for log K vs 1/T using these parameters
were drawn and the reported equilibrium quotients plotted, the line would

fall on the same side of all points. A least squares analysis using all
published data, with equal weighting for all points, gave values of Aﬁi =
20.28 * 0.84 kcal/mole and 85 = 6.67 £ 0.77 cal deg™! mole™*. From their
values Greenbaum, et g_]___.5 reported the AHfo 208 of BeFa(g) as -191.3 +

2.0 kecal/mole and 50298 of BeFa(g) as 52.4 % 0.3 cal deg™! mole™!. Based

cn the recalculation, the values would be -191.5 % 1.1 and 53.1 % 0.8,

respectively.
The vapor pressure of BeFa(i) has been studied extensively.é'lo Sense,
93_25-6’7 studied the vapor pressure from 745 to 1021°C. Two Russian groups8’9

have reported vapor pressure studies. All of these are in general agreement
but have slight differences. The most extensive, and probably the best,
study (550 to 950°C) was that of Greenbaum, g&_g&.lo Since the enthalpy
and entropy of vaporization are reasonably well known from these measure-
ments, a combination of this information with independently determined
entropy and enthalpy of formation of Ber(;) should provide a new means

for evaluating the thermodynamic properties of BeFa(g).

The thermodynamic values of Hz0(g), HF(g), and BeO(s) are well char-
acterized throughout the temperature range of the present measurements
(see reference 4). Thus, if the AHr can be determined for the reaction
H20(g) + BeF2(1) = 2HF(g) + BeO(s) ,
then AH%O of BeFa(1l) can be calculated. The greatest uncertainty in AHfO
for HF(g) is the correction which should be applied for the imperfection
at room temperature. Several recent publications have dealt with the sub-
ject- 1117 Franck and Spalthoff'’ reported that the enthalpy of vaporiza-
tion rises from 89.5 cal/g at 19.4°C to a max of 146 cal/g at 130°C and

decreases at higher temperature. Armitage, g§_§£-12 show that the various

thermodynamic properties can best be explained by assuming that HF exists
in the gas phase principally as monomers and hexamers, but no actual indi=-
cation of the average molecular weight as a function of temperature or
pressure is given. Yabroff, gg.gi-lB have summarized most past work in
their report. They conclude that HF molecules are strongly associated
into polymeric forms and that dissociation is accompanied by large changes
in enthalpy-. Armstrong14 and Feder, g§.§£-l5 have considered the effect
of this association on the heat of formation of HF(g). The average molec-
ular weight of HF(g) at 1 atm and 25°C is 54, at 0.4 atm and 25°¢ is 22,
and at 1 atm and 80°C is 20.16 For pressures as low as a few hundredths
of an atmosphere both HF and Hz0 are reasonably ideal at 25°C and undoubt-
edly are ideal at melt temperatures.

From the thermodynamic gquantities tabulated in JANAF, equilibriuvm
constants were calculated for several conceivable reactions involving HF,

H20, BeFz, BeO, and LiF. These are presented in Table 1 along with the

calculated heats of reaction. Although the equilibrium constants refer to

reactants and products which are pure solids or liquids, they could be ap-

plied to reactions in solution if appropriate activities were used. From
these data the following predictions are made:

(1) Oxygen containing compounds of Li should react to form Be compounds.
If Lip0 were added to an ILiF-BeF2 melt, the Liz0 should react almost
quantitatively to form BeO and LiF. If IiOH were added to an LiF-BeFp
melt, the LiOH should react almost quantitatively to form Be(OH)2 and
IiF.

(2) The formation of Be(OH)2 as a separate solid phase at temperatures as
high as 800%K is very unlikely.

(3) A11 of the stable campounds have low volatilities at the temperatures
of interest.

A more precise determination of the AH. of BeF2(1) and of the activ-

ities of BeFz2 and LiF in the melt would allow more gquantitative predictions

of reactions in the LiF-BeFp system.
Thermodynamic Studies of Molten Salt Mixtures

The determination of thermodynamic activities of melt components in
molten salts has received considerable attention. Blander has swmarized
much of the work through 1962.%7

The relationships between activities and activity coefficients depend
on the choice of concentration units. The most frequent unit for expressing
concentration of mixed solvents is the mole fraction. In molten salts the
ion fraction is frequently used. TFor systems in which all salts contain the

same anion, mole fraction and ion fraction are equal. The term "mole frac-

tion" will be used in the text.
10

According to the Temkin model,l8 in which salts are considered to be
completely ionic, the ideal activity of a component is equal to the product
of ion fractions of its constituents (aij = Xixj)' For a solution which
contains only one anion, j, the ion fraction,Xj, equals one. The ion frac-
tion of each cation is equal to the mole fraction of that component. The
activities of components are usually referred to the pure liguid (super-
cooled if necessary) as the standard state. Occasionally, the activities
are referred to the pure crystalline solid for experimental convenience.

The activities of components in solution have been measured by the fol-
lowing methods: +vapor pressures, freezing point depression, electrode
potentials, and heterogeneous equilibria. The vapor pressure method is
compllicated by the formation of complex species in the vapor phase. Deter-
mination of activities from freezing point depressions requires that the
heat of fusion and the qu for the pure solid and liquid solvent be known.
Electrode potential measurements of activities are often made in cells with
liguid Jjunction. OSuch measurements are limited to dilute solutions, which
are expected to give small liquid junction potentials.

The use of heterogeneous equilibria has thus far been limited. The

19,20 in mixtures with KC1 and NaCl

activity of MgClz has been determined
by use of the equilibrium

MgCla(soln) + 302(g) = Mgo(s) + C1la(g) -

Blood, g§_§£.21 determined the activities of various metal fluorides in
LiF-BeF; mixtures using the eguilibrium

M(s) + xHF(g) == MF_(soln) + (x/2)Ha(g) -

In studies of this type it is important that the solid present be well

characterized and relatively insoluble and, of course, that all phases are

in equilibrium.
11

If the activity of one of the components of a binary mixture is known
as a function of camposition, the other one can be determined by integration
of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. From the activities, such properties as molar
heats of mixing, excess chemical potential, vapor pressure, and phase behav-
ior can be derived.

At present, a general theory of the behavior of melts has not been
developed to the point that activities can be predicted for a system such
as LiF-BeF».

The activities of LiF and BeFz have been reported for a limited number
of cases. Berkowitz and Chupks in 1960 reported the activities in an equi-
molar mixture from relative ion intensities during mass-spectral ana];ysis.22
Recently, Buchler has reported determinations by a more careful mass-spectral
analysis and emf measurements. The emf measurements were conducted at two
temperatures in a concentration cell containing pure BeF2 in one compart-

Solubilities of Gases in Melts

In addition to the studies of activities in melts, the solubilities
of gases have also been of interest. Watson, g}_§£.25 have studied the
solubility of the inert gases in molten fluorides, including the LiF-BeFa
system. All solubilities obey Henry's law and increase with increasing
temperature and with decreasing atomic weight of gas.

Burkhard and Corbett26 reported the solubility 6f water in molten
LiCl-KCl mixtures. Apparently Henry's law was obeyed for low pressures,
with the deviations above a few millimeters attributed to hydrolysis. How-
ever, no analyses were reported on the gases to determine the amount of
H,0 and HC1l in the gas phase in equilibrium with the melt.

Shaffer, et al. have studied the solubility of HF in molten fluo=-

ride mixtures. In the LiF-BeF2 system28 solubility of HF increases with
13

decreasing temperature and with decreasing BeF2 concentration. The Henry's
law constants indicate that the solubility of HF in the LiF~-BeFp system
should be less than 150 ppm per atm HF above the melt. Thus, for the pres-
ent studies with partial pressures less than 0.02 atm HF, the solubility

should be less than 3 ppm.
Determination of Oxides in Melts

Since the presence of oxide in molten halides affects many physical
and chemical properties, quantitative procedures for determination of the
amount of oxide present have been widely sought. Goldberg, et §£.29 PLro=-
posed high-temperature fluorination with KBrFs; with liberated 02 measured
tensimetrically. This method works reasonably well, but the greatest un-
certalnties were found with fluoride melts and with samples containing less
than 300 ppm.

Porter and BrownBO used an inert-gas fusion technique (described by
Banks, g§_§£.3l) in determining oxide concentrations in molten fluorides.
Samples of the melt were withdrawn through graphite filters and the entire
sample was used in the analysis. The reported analyses indicated the rela-
tive precision was * 10% for oxide concentrations of about 0.5%. No
indication was made of applicability to lower concentrations.

32,33 has determined relative oxide solubilities in ILiCl-KCl

Delarue
melts electrochemically. The concentration of oxide was determined in the
melt with Pt-C electrodes vs a Pt-PtClz reference electrode. These results
permitted identification of a variety of reactions involving oxide.

None of the methods cited are adequate for determining oxide in the

LiF-BeFs system. From studies of oxide solubility by Baes, gE_§£.34 in
14

which weighed samples of BeQ were added to fluoride melts containing uran-
ium and zirconium, it was estimated that the solubility of BeO was less than
1000 ppm. Determination of oxide content in filtered samples by the Goldberg

mﬁthod,zg however, gave very inconclusive results.
Suitable Experimental Approach

The molten salt production facility at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant has
made use of HF-sparging to remove oxide from solution in the form of water.35
Since the production procedure parallels the transpiration method for deter-
mining vapor pressures of liquids, the feasibility of transpiration techniques
for an equilibrium study of the LiF-BeF2 system was considered. Much of the
feasibility study was conducted by M. K. Kemp who determined partial pres-
sures over the ZrOz-saturated LiF-BeFa-ZrF,; system and was able to estimate
the activity of ZrF4 in solution-36
Transpiration Method
The transpiration method for determining vapor pressures of liquids is

well esta‘blished-37 In order for the trenspiration method to work satisfac-
torily in studies of heterogeneous equilibria, the following conditions
should be met:
(1) Reactions must be fast enough and flow rates must be slow enough to

allow equilibration between gas and condensed phases.
(2) Adequate stirring of liquid phases must be maintained to provide uni-

form concentrations of reactants.
(3) The vapor pressures of condensed phases must be low enough to prevent

significant loss by transport in the carrier gas.

(4) Reacting gases should be unassociated.
15

(5) An adequate means of removal and measurement of reactive gases from
the flowing gas stream must be available.

The best evidence that these conditions have been met in the present
system is described in Chapter III. The variation in flow rates and in
the amount of reaction necessary to maintain equilibrium was used to test
the validity of the first two conditions. The vapor pressure data for
BnglO and LiF-Bel'z mixtures38 indicated that very little BeFz would be
vaporized. The vapor pressure of BeO at the experimental temperatures is
insignificant.Bg Although both H20 and HF are at least partially associ-
ated at room temperature, the dilute gases at melt temperatures are
expected to be ideal.

Determinations of the partial pressures of HF and Hp0 over aqueous
hydrofluoric acid solutions have been made by means of the transpiration
m.ethod.40 Measurements were made over solutions of 10, 20, 30, 50, and
70% hydrofluoric acid, at temperatures from O to 70°C. The HF in the car-
rier gas stream was absorbed by an agueous KOH solution. The difference
between weight lost by the saturator and weight of HF found in gas stream
was assumed to be the ambunt of water removed from the saturator. Since
this difference could not be used in the present studies, a suitable
method for measuring water was needed. Xemp investigated several methods
of analysis. Condensation of samples in a cold trap with subsequent weigh-
ing and analysis for per cent HF was not satisfactory primarily because of
the small size of the samples. Adsorption of the water by a suitable des-

sicant in a weighed drying tube was not satisfactory because HF was also

adsorbed.
16

Finally, it was observed that a mixture of methanol and pyridine was
suitable for removal of water from a flowing stream even in the presence
of HF. Titration of the water with Karl Fischer Reagent could be performed
in the vessel and since Karl Fischer Reagent contains excess methanol and
pyridine, several successive titrations could be performed. Apparently the
HF reacted with excess pyridine to form a fairly soluble pyridinium hydro-
fluoride which did not interfere with the titration.

Karl Fischer Reagent consists of Iz and S0z dissolved in pyridine and
methanol (actually the "stabilized reagent" contains methylcellosolve in-

41

stead of methanol). Although the titration is straightforward, — the

reaction occurs in two steps:

502
- 7~
Hz0 + CsHsN + CsHsN'S02 + C5HsN'Iz » 2C5HsNH'I™ + CsHsN, |
0
/802 -
C5HsN | + CH30H — CsHsNHOSO20CH3 .
0

When titrating H20 with Karl Fischer Reagent the endpoint corresponds
to the first appearance of Iz. For macrotitrations the reagent serves as
its own indicator; however, for microtitrations a more precise method is
needed. Several authors have reported suitable circuits for the amperomet-
ric determination of the endpoint. The one actually used was quite similar
to the one described by Nérnitz.42
Equilibria

If the molten LiF-BeF, system comes into contact with water vapor,
hydrolysis occurs releasing some HF into the gas space and leaving some
oxygen-containing species dissolved in the melt. For a closed system at
equilibrium, the amount of HF and H20 in the gas phase will depend on (1)

the amounts of HF and H20 initially introduced, (2) the solubility of HF
17

and Hz0 in the melt, (3) the concentration of oxide in the melt, (4) the
concentration of hydroxide, a reactive intermediete (in the sense that it
can exist only in the presence of HF and H20), in the melt, and (5) the
amount of HF and Hz20 consumed in side reactions which do not influence the
oxide reaction scheme.

If the above quantities are properly controlled or measured, useful
equilibrium data can be obtained. The reaction of HF and H20 at high tem-
peratures with the structural metal used (nickel) can be suppressed by the
presence of Ha. Side reactions are essentially eliminated if the purity
of melts is sufficiently high. The solubility of HF in melts in the absence
of oxygen species has been mentioned and is small compared with the best
estimates of oxide solubility. It seems reasonable to assume that water
solubility would be of the same order of magnitude as that of HF and the
experimental results supported this. One method of controlling the oxide
concentration would be saturation of the melt with a sparingly soluble
oxide such as BeO. With the above conditions set, transpiration experi-
ments can be used to control the amounts of HF and H20 introduced and to
measure the hydroxide concentration indirectly through the material differ-
ence between influent and effluent gas streams.

For a BeO-saturated, LiF-BeFz melt with excess solid BeO present the
following equilibrium is valid:

H20(g) + BeFa(soln) = 2HF(g) + BeO(s) .
If both HF and H20 are assumed to be ideal gases and if the thermodynamic
activities of the condensed species are represented by "a", the equilibrium

constant for the reaction would be

K, = (Ppp) *8peo/ P o%Ber,
18

Since 800 is 1 by definition,

Ky = (Ppp) /Py, Ppep, = Yopey, -

This equilibrium is independent of the presence or absence of hydroxide in
the melt.

The quantity (PHF)z/PHZO for BeO saturated melts, defined above as Q,
can be obtained from determination of partial pressures in the gas phase
alone. Thus Q, which is proportional to the activity of BeFz, would be
equal to Ké for the equilibriwm involving pure liquid BeFs at the same tem-
perature. Determination of Q for various temperatures and compositions of
BeF provides the data necessary for thermodynamic calculations involving
the melts.

The following additional equilibria involving oxide and hydroxide ions
in the melt should also be considered. (The corresponding equilibrium quo-
tients, which are shown, may be considered constant for a given LiF-BeF;
composition and temperature since at the low concentrations of oxide and
hydroxide involved, the activity of F and the activity coefficients 702-
and 7.~ can reasonably be assumed constant.) Since [F ] is reasonably
constant for a given melt composition, [F~ ] is incorporated into the equi~
librium quotients.

H20(g) + 2F (soln) = 2HF(g) + 02 (soln)

Q = (Pyp) 1071/ FH20

For oxide saturated melts [0°7] is constant, hence
QO/[OZ-]sat = (PHF)zﬁPﬁzo = Q.

There are three reactions involving hydroxide in solution.
H20(g) + F (soln) = HF(g) + OH (soln)

Qy = (Py) [0 /Py
19

Ha0(g) + 02~ (soln) == 20H (soln)

Q, = [oH"1%/(py ) [0*7]

and for a melt saturated with oxide where [0%~] is constant,
Q = [OH-]a/PHao .

Hr(g) + 0%7(soln) == OH (soln) + F (soln)

Q, = [on"1/(py) [0%7]

and for a melt saturated with oxide,

Qg = [OH ) /P, -

Note that not all of the equilibrium quotients are independent. Since
QO is independent of [OH™ ] and QA is independent of [0%“], these two equi-
librium quotients are the most conveniently employed. Both Qb and Qc can
be expressed as functions of QO and QA-

Q, = (q,)%/q, and Q, = Q,/q,
The relationships for BeO saturated melts are given by
q, = (q,)2/a and Qe = Q,/Q -

Stoichiometric relationships show that the number of protons in a given
volume of effluent gas will be less than the number in the influent gas by
the amount that has appeared as OH added to the melt. If the proton level
in the effluent gas stream exceeds the level in the influent stream, OH
is being removed from the melt. The difference in Hz0 content between the
influent and effluent gas streams corresponds to the total amount of oxide
plus hydroxide being added to or removed from the melt. Iikewise, the dif-
ference in HF content between the influent and effluent gas streams corre-
sponds to the amount of fluoride being added to or removed from the melt.
For all experiments conducted, the change in fluoride was small enough so
that the LiF-BeFz concentration in the melt was assumed to be constant

throughout a given experiment.
20

For simplicity in handling equations the following notation will be
used:
wt of melt = w(kg)
vol of gas (measured at T) through melt = V(liter)
V/wRT = W(mole kg™t atm™1)
P =28 + bW and Py,o = ¢ *d¥ (atm) for influent pressures
(NOTE: When the agueous HF saturator was employed b and 4
were always O. When gas mixing was employed b and d were
small negative numbers because small opening in valve tended
to gradually close.)
Pom = X and Py,0 =Y (atm) for effluent partial pressures
[0*"] =

[OH"] = s

1§

The equilibrium quotients may now be expressed as

Q= x*/y, Q = X°r/y, and Q = xs/y -

Saturated Melts

 

For constant. influent partial pressures of Hz20, HF, or both there will
be an ultimate steady state condition in which the effluent partial pres-
sures are not changing, hence r and s are constant. In fact r will be
constant at all times in a given experiment unless rate of reaction to form
hydroxide and water exceeds the dissolving rate of solid BeO. The speed
with which x and y approach a steady state is controlled primarily by Q and
QA' According to the equations described earlier, the difference in proton
level of influent and effluent streams is equal to the change in hydroxide
concentration. Thus,

ds/aw = (a + 2¢) - (x + 2y) .
21

Both ds and y may be eliminated by using the relationships Q = xz/y and.

Qy = xs/y. Rearrangement of the former gives y = x°/Q. Rearrangement and
substitution into the latter gives s = QAX/Q, which may be differentiated
to give ds = (QA/Q)dx. Thus

dx/aW = (Q/QA)[(a + 2c) - (x + 2x%/Q)].

Separation of variables gives

dx
(a +2¢) - x - (2/Q)x?

 

= (Q/Q,) aw .

Defining (a + 2c) as A, this equation may be integrated to give

1 1n (4/Q)x + 1 + [1 + (84/Q)]
[1+ (88/Q)1F (4/Q)x + 1 - [1 + (8A/Q)]

 

 

= (Q/QA)W + constant .

The correlation of experimental measurements with this eguation is described
in Chapter III. The computer program for this correlation was written by
R. J. McNamee, Operations Analysis Division, ORGDP.

Unsaturated Melts

 

For unsaturated melts the change in r and s can be determined by mate-
rial balance. The difference between influent and effluent partial pressures
of Ha20 corresponds to the change in total oxide concentration
(dr + ds)/aWw = (¢ - y) .

The difference in proton levels corresponds to the change in hydroxide con-
centration just as in saturated melts

ds/daW = (a - x) + 2(c - y) .

By difference

dr/aW = (x = a) + (y - ¢) .

Combination of these equations with Q, = xs/y and Qy = x?r/y could, in
22

principle, yield integral equations expressing QA and QO as a function of
the measured quantities. However, the resulting pair of simultaneous dif=-
ferential equations could not be integrated. The following simultaneous
differential equations were obtained by elimination of x and y from the
expressions for dr/dW and ds/dW:

as/aw = (a + 2¢) - (Qys/Q,r)(1 + 2s/Q,)

and

dr/aw

il

(QOS/QAr)(l + s/QA) -(a+e)
These equations could be solved in the differential form to obtain values
of r and s as a function of W for specified values of QO and QA' If r,
S, QG and QA are specified at a given W, values for x and y may be calcu-
lated.

The method of solution of the equations and the correlation of experi-
mental data by this method are described in Chapter III. The computer
program for this correlation, "FIASCO", was written by M. T. Harkrider,

ORNL Mathematics Division.

II. EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals

Gases

Commercial Hz was purified before use by passage through a deoxo unit,
a magnesium perchlorate drying tube and, finally, a liquid Nz trap. Com-
mercial He was passed through an ascarite trap, a magnesium perchlorate
drying tube and, finally, a liquid N2 trap. Anhydrous HF was used directly
from a commercial cylinder without further purification. B & A reagent
grade 48% hydrofluoric acid was used as the source of HF(g) and Ho0(g).
Melt Components

Beryllium fluoride was from Brush Beryllium Company (material to be
used in preparing the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment fuel salt). Iithium
fluoride was B & A reagent grade. Various mixtures were prepared by melt-
ing together weighed samples of the two components. Samples of the mixtures
were withdrawn in filter sticks and analyzed for Be, Li, F and impurities
(Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu and S). High purity BeO from Brush Beryllium Company was
added to the melts which were used in studies of oxide saturated melts.

Standard Reagents

 

Reagent grade KOH was used in the preparation of 0.1 N base which was
standardized with potassium acid phthalate. Karl Fischer Reagent from
Fisher Chemical Company (So-K-3) was standardized by direct addition of

weighed aliquots of water.
24
Apparatus

Experiments were carried out by means of a transpiration method. The

stepwise sequence of processes was as follows:

Control of flow of

A complete flow diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 2.
Flow Control Panel

The menifold gas pressures (Hp and He) were not constant but varied,
generally, between 5 and 10 1b gauge. A pressure relief valve (Moore
Products Campany differential type flow controller, Model 63BD, modified
form) was used to reduce this pressure to & constant value of 3.0 1b gauge.
The gas next passed through a Fisher-Porter Rotameter which was used only
as & visual check of the flow rate. The pressure was measured with a 4=-in.
Asheroft gauge graduated in 1/4-lb divisions from O to 15 1b above atmos-
pheric pressure. The brass needle valve with micrometer handle was from

prevent back flow of gas. The Hz line to the agueous HF saturator was also
connected to a water filled manometer from which the pressure immediately
upstream of the saturator could be determined. The various pieces on the
panel were connected by 1/4-in. Cu tubing using mechanical Swagelok fittings.

An alternate flow control system, identical with the above except for
the H20 manometer, was used to control the carrier gas for the anhydrous HF
system.

Agueous HF Saturator

 

When HF and H20 were both desired in the influent gas, agueous solu-
tions of HF were employed. The Hz from the flow control panel passed first
through a dry bottle, next the filled saturator, and then another dry bottle
which acted as a trap for liquid droplets. Both the bottles and the satu-
rator were machined from Teflon bar stock. The two bottles were 2%—in-
diemeter with a capacity of 300 mi. The saturator was a two-piece spiral
gas-washing bottle (3-in. outside diameter top, 2-in. bottom) with approx-
imately the same volume as the dry bottles. Iids for the three were screw-
type with 45° shoulders which made pressure seals. The tube openings were
threaded for compression-type nuts which sealed the tubes in place when
tightened. The connecting line from the flow control panel and between the
bottles was of 1/4-in. Teflon tubing.

The saturator and dry bottles were in a constant temperature bath, the
temperature of which was used to control the partial pressures of HF and
H20. The temperature could be controlled % 0.1°C from 15 to 25°C. The bath
was continuously cooled by a water coil while heating was controlled by a

mercury-mercury contact thermostat and an electronic relay.
Anhydrous HF Mixing System
For studies reguiring anhydrous HF(g), controlled gas mixing was
employed. The manifold HF pressure was controlled by regulating the tem-
perature of the HF supply cylinder. The flow of HF was controlled by a
small-orifice Monél diaphragm valve. The HF flowed from the valve through
a 6-mil capillary to the mixing chamber, a 1/4-in. Cu tube about 3 in.
long. The HF entered at one end of the mixing chamber; the Hz entered at
the other end through a 1/8-in. Cu tube which extended the length of the
chamber to the point where the HF capillary ended. The mixed gases flowed
out through a sidearm. This system was adapted from one designed by
G. Long which was suitable for HF pressures from about 3 X 10°2 atm down-
43

ward.

Reaction Vessel

 

The melts were contained in cylindrical vessels (2-in. diam, 15-in.
long; or 4~-in. diam, 15-in. long) constructed of Grade A nickel. Fach
vessel was equipped with the following: & thermocouple well and a gas-
inlet tube (1/4-in. tubing) each of which reached to within 1/2 in. of
the bottom of the vessel; a cover gas line (1/4-in. tubing) with an at-
tached 6-in. Ashceroft Duragasuge graduated from 30-in. vac to 30-1b gauge;
and a sampling port (a 3/8-in. pipe with the end closed by a 1/2-in.
Worcester ball valve). A sidearm on the sampling port of 1/4-in. tubing
served as the gas-outlet line.

The sampling port could be connected to either a sampling apparatus
or an addition apparatus. These apparatus (developed and in common use
)

in molten salt studies at ORNL allow removal of samples from the melt

in Cu filter sticks with subsequent transfer to a dry box under He
28

atmosphere, and addition of weighed salt samples to the melt under a dry
He atmosphere.

The reaction vessel was located inside an upright tube furnace, the
temperature of which was controlled by an L & N Speedomax H Temperature
Controller with Model S Recorder and a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple. The
temperature was checked periodically with a calibrated Pt vs Pt-10% Rh
thermocouple and an L & N K-2 Potentiometer.

The gas lines from the saturator and the HF mixing chamber to the
reaction vessel and from the vessel to the titration assembly were of
l/4-in- Cu tubing. Monel sealed-diaphragm valves were comnected by means
of silver-soldered Jjoints. Both the lines and valves were heated to about
100°C with heating tape as precaution against condensation or surface ad-
sorption of the HF or Hz0.

Titration Assembly

 

The Karl Fischer titration vessel was a 300-ml round-bottom flask
with the following additions: two Pt wires fused through the bottom of
the flask about 3/4 in. apart; a sidearm added to the bottom to allow
drainage of the flask; two buret tips (for 5-ml Koch microburets with 150-
ml reservoir) fused through the top of the vessel about 3 in. apart. The
solution was stirred by a small bar magnet under the Pt wires. Teflon
gas~inlet and gas-outlet lines were fitted through a rubber stopper.

The endpoint was determined by an amperometric method using the "dead-
stop" technique-45 The indicator circuit consisted of the following:
1.5-v dc source, & 10* ohm variable resistor, a 500 ohm variable resistor,
the Pt electrodes, and a microammeter (all connected in series). With

excess Karl Fischer Reagent present the variable resistors were adjusted
29

so that a current of more than 100 pa was observed. With excess water
present the current was less than 2 pa. The endpoint was taken as the
point at which the current was 50 pa.

The KOH titration vessel was a 175-ml test tube. Teflon gas~inlet
and gas-outlet lines, and the tip of a 10-ml ILab-Crest microburet were
fitted through a rubber stopper. Phenolphthalein indicator was used.

Gas Volume Measurement

 

The carrier gas from the titration assembly was bubbled through a
bottle containing KOH solution (to remove acidic vapors from the Karl
Fischer Apparatus) and. then through a bottle containing H20 [to saturate
with HzO(g) at room temperature] before its volume was measured in a
Precision Wet Test Meter. The gas-exit line from the Wet Test Meter was

connected to a Bubble-0O-Meter which was used to measure flow rates.
Procedure

Measurements
The primary experimental quantities needed were the partial pressures
of HF and Hz0 over the melt.
Titrations.--Measurements for determination of partial pressures were
made as follows:
(1) A measured volume of standardized reagent was added to a titration
vessel.
(2) The time required for the flowing gas to neutralize the reagent
was determined.
(3) The flow rate of gas was determined at room temperature by timing

a soap bubble for 100 ml. Since diffusion of Hpz through the bubble
(4)

(5)

(6)

30

would lead to lower indicated flow rates than the true flow
rates, at least one bubble before and one bubble after the one
being timed were employed to help decrease diffusion of Haz.
Usually, at least three successive titrations were carried

out with a given reagent and then the gas flow was switched to
the other titration vessel for a similar number of titrations.
The initial volume for a series of titrations was recorded from
the wet-test meter, which indicated continuously the total gas
volume which had passed through the reaction vessel during an
experiment. The meter could be read only to the nearest 10 ml,
which was a precise enough reading for total volume but not for
individual titrations. The gas volumes titrated were calculated
from the flow rate and time of titration.

The temperature of the wet-test meter, which was the temperature
of the gas as it was being measured, was recorded.

Calculations.--The required calculations to evaluate the partial

pressures were carried out as follows:

(1)

(2)

(3)

The measured volume of gas was calculated by

(Time of titration)/(Time per 100 ml) x 100 = ml of gas.

The number of millimoles of the component removed from the gas
stream by the titration was calculated by

(ml reagent)(conc reagent) = millimoles component {HF or Hz0).

The partial pressure of the component was calculated from ideal
gas law by

P = (millimoles component)(0.08206)(temp wet-test meter)/

component
(ml gas) -
31

Limitations.--The apparatus as employed did pose some limitations
on the procedure. The aqueous HF saturator as designed could not accom-
modate flow rates greater than 200 ml/min without bumping. For consis-
tency, comparable flow rates were used with the anhydrous HF sysien.

Under operating conditions both the Karl Fischer titration vessel
and the KOH titration vessel were checked to verify that they were able
to remove quantitatively the H20 and HF, respectively, from the flowing
gas stream. In both instances two vessels were set up in series and the
leak-through from the first determined the second. The amounts of HF and
Ho0 titrated in the downstream vessels were less than 0.1% of the amounts
measured in the upstream vessels.

The Karl Fischer titration vessel was also checked against in-leakage
of moisture from the atmosphere. The amount of Karl Fischer Reagent needed
to maintain the endpoint with no gas flowing through the vessel was about
0.07 ml/hr. This correction was applied to pressures below 1 x 10”2 atm
when it altered the observed results by as much as 1%.

Since the titration vessels were operated at room temperature, in
order to avoid condensation, the max pressures of HF and H20 were limited
to the vapor pressures above agqueous HF solutions at the same temperature.

Even for pressures below these limits some surface adsorption was
encountered. When the flowing gas stream was switched through the Karl
Fischer apparatus, the PH;O determined for the first few tenths of a liter
would be lower than the following determination. Therefore, the first
titration of about 0.3 ml Karl Fischer Reagent was not recorded after the
switch was made. Dehydrdtion of the Teflon was observed after the flow-

ing gas was stopped. Additional Karl Fischer Reagent was necessary to
32

maintain the endpoint. (This was much in excess of the amount due to in-
leakage discussed above and due to the untitrated gaseous water in the dip-

line.) The same problem was not observed with P._, measurements, but usually

HF
a small aliquot of KOH was added to vessel during switching to allow stabi-
lization of flow before titrations were begun.

Systematic Errors

 

The preceding method of calculating partial pressures included +the
assumption that the pressure in the apparatus from the saturator to the
wet-test meter was constant and that the amount of material was the same
at every stage. The assumption was also made that the measured volume
was equal to the volume of carrier gas plus reactive components, HF and
H20. These assumptions were not completely valid, but it will be shown
in the following sections that the resulting systematic errors were small.

The following notation will be used in the discussion of systematic

errors:

T_ = temperature of melt, K

TW = temperature of wet-test meter, %k
Pw = total pressure at wet-test meter
p, = vapor pressure of water at Tw

X and y = partial pressures of HF and H20, respectively, at titrator

Nym and anD = moles of HF and H,0 as measured at Tw’ Pw

V,; = measured volume on wet-test meter
Va = volume of dry carrier gas going through system measured at Tw’ Pw
Vb = volume of gas entering titration assembly at TW, Pw-

Measured Volume.--The measured gas volume, Vw, was of the carrier

 

gas which had been saturated with water at Tw’ immediately prior to
33

entering the wet-test meter. The volume which should have been used in

the pressure calculations was Vb' The volume of carrier gas corresponding

to the measured volume is given by

Vg = VW(PW " PW)/EW *

The volume of HF and H20 entering the titration assembly may be calculated
from the gas laws to bhe

(nH20RTW)/PW " ('HF}TW)/PW.

(The effect of any non-ideality of HF or H20 at the low partial pressures
involved here is expected to be negligible.)

From Dalton's law of partial pressures

Substituting the value of Va from the above equation,

y = ( ) ’

note that PW cancels, and by a parallel method

_ [PW - (x +y)] Ny RT
vﬁ(Pw - Pw)

 

X

According to these calculations, the x and y values calculated in
the preceding section should be multiplied by the factor f, where
P -(x+y)
=,
P - Py
The maex and min values for f can be estimated. PW = atmospheric pressure;

(x + y) varies from O to 0.033 atm, but generally is between 0.013 and
34

0.020 atm; p, is between 0.029 and 0.035 depending on T The maximum
value for f would be 1.00/0.965 = 1.037. The minimum value for f would
be 0.967/0.971 = 0.996. For the majority of measurements,

0.980/0.970 < £ < 0.987/0.970 ; 1.013 < £ < 1.0196 .

Thus the calculated partial pressures are too low by 1.0 to 2.0% due to
the removal of HF and H»0 and subsequent saturation with H20 vapor before
the volume of carrier was measured.

Another effect, which exerts a minor influence on pressure measure-
ments, is the pressure drop, between the gas space above the melt and
atmospheric pressure, required to maintain bubbling through the titrator
and wet-test meter. This drop was less than 0.01 atm, and would cause
the measured values to be low by as much as 1.0%.

Influent Pressure.--The influent partial pressures were measured

 

with the gas bypassing the reaction vessel. The influent partial pressures
are controlled by the saturator temperature and are independent of the
total pressure. The total pressure in the saturator was less during the
measurements of the influent gas camposition than when the gas was pass-
ing through the melt by the pressure drop required to maintain bubbling,
which was about 0.015 atm. This pressure drop results in an expansion

of the gas as it enters the reaction vessel, hence the actual influent
partial pressures of HF and H20 are less than the measured influent par-
tial pressures by 1.5%.

Hydrogen Diffusion.--According to published diffusion coefficient346

 

the diffusion of Hz out of the Ni vessel could be a few milliliters per
minute at the elevated temperature of the vessel. Only the reaction ves-

sel was sufficiently hot to allow diffusion of hydrogen.
35

The rate of diffusion was measured experimentally by pressurizing
an empty vessel to 5 1b gauge and following the decrease in pressure as
a function of time. The pressures were measured down to 10 in. vacuum.

A control experiment with He was used to check against leakage. The fol-
lowing rates of diffusion (expressed as the volume of gas per second
which would be measured at the wet-test meter; i.e. at 'I'W and PW) were
determined; 700°C, 0.035 ml/sec; 650°C, 0.025 ml/sec; 600°C, 0.015 mi/
sec. The rate of diffusion of Hz out of a vessel containing salt should
be no greater and probably not much less than for an empty vessel.

The influent partial pressures from the aqueous saturator were deter-
mined without loss of Hz by diffusion since the gas bypassed the vessel.
If the influent gas were passed through a veseel with no salt present,
the measured partial pressures would be greater due to this effect, by
an amount dependent on the temperature and flow rate.

Most experiments were conducted with flow rates between 2.0 and 2.5
ml/sec. This means the apparent influent pressures would be from 1.4 to
1.75% higher at 700°C; 1.0 to 1.25% higher at 650°C; and 0.60 to 0.75%
higher at 600°C then the measured influent pressures. The difference
would be less at lower temperatures.

Hydrogen diffusion did not play the same role when the anhydrous HF
supply system was used. The flow of HF through the control valve was
independent of the flow rate of Hz, hence the amount of HF was determined
as a function of time and the influent PHF was calculated from this value
and the effluent flow rate.

The effect of diffusion of Hz out of the reaction vessel need not

have been as great as indicated above. The mixing of the effluent gas,
36

primarily through turbulence, could have permitted re-equilibration of
the gas with the melt. This would reduce the error caused by loss of hy-
drogen from the system by diffusion.

Dead-volume.~-~-The preceding errors reflect the variations in pressure
and mass of flowing gas. There is one additional error in the pressure
determination at a given volume. This is the lag in measured pressures
because of the volume of the gas space above the melt. The following addi-
tional notation will be used:

T = temperature of gas above the melt, °k

Vm = volume of gas space above the melt
P = partial pressure of HF or Hz0 leaving the melt
P2 = measured partial pressure

dV = increment of gas flowing through system as measured at Tw, Pw .

From the mixing process,

moles of substance entering V, = (PldV)/(RTW)

moles of substance leaving V_ = (Png)/(RTW)

change of moles in Vm = (YmdPg)/(RZm) .

Thus,

(vap2)/(RT_ ) = (P1av)/(RT,) - (P2aV)/(RT )

and rearranging,

P = Vm(Tw/Tm)(dPg/dV) + P2 e

For most experiments, V= 0.400 liters and T_ = 300°K. When T = 773°K,
— — — O —— ——

(/T ) = (300/773) = 0.388 and when T = 973°K, (T /T ) = (300/973) =

0.308.

Therefore, at 500°C

Py = 0.1552(dP,/dv) + Pa
37

and at 700°C
Py = 0.1232(dPa/dv) + Pa

The most dramatic change in P2 occurred in the experiments when water
was introduced into melts which contained very little oxide. The maximum
rate of pressure change noted was 0.01 atm/liter. Therefore,

Py =1.55 x 10"% + P2 .

This large change occurred only during the first liter and only in the HF
measurements. During this time P2 increased to about 1 x 10"2 atm so that
the error in these unusual circumstances was only about 10%. At all other
times the chenge was less than 1 x 10™% atm/liter and often less than 1 x
10-2 atm/liter. For all of these conditions the error would be much smaller
than 1.0%.

This treatment assumes no further equilibration after the bubble leaves
the melt. If any did occur then application of the above equation would be
an overcorrection.

Summary .--The combined effect of these systematic errors on the over-
all accuracy of the results will now be considered.

Due t0 the measured~volume error all cbserved partial pressures were
1.0 to 2.0% low. The other errors do not affect the observed partial pres-
sures but do affect the material balance relationships used in treating the
data.

The calculated values of Q (i.e., x%/y) are 1.0 to 2.0% low for all
cases. This range is within the experimental scatter of the data. No
bias is introduced in calculation of activities because of the extrapola-
tion to pure BelFa2. The extrapolated thermodynamic values for BeFa(l) are

well within the precision of literature data. No comparison of influent
38

and effluent pressures is required and diffusion of H, should not influence
results.

The expected effects on Q,, (x/y)[0H"], are within the scatter of
the data. The quantity, (x/y), will not be affected by any of the errors.
The hydroxide concentration is based on proton material balance between
influent and effluent gas. Thus, due to the error in measured influent
pressures, the hydroxide concentration should be decreased by 1.5%. Due
to the error caused by diffusion of hydrogen, the hydroxide concentration
should be increased by 0.5 to 1.75% depending on temperature and flow rate.
Since the hydroxide concentration is proportional to QA’ the calculated
values for Q, could range from 1.0% high to 0.25% low. This range is
well within the indicated scatter of data, with QA generally known only
to * 10%.

For unsaturated melts, QO is based on the difference between oxygen
material balance and proton material balance. QO is subject to the same
corrections as QA, hence it is from 1.0% high to 0.25% low. The quanti-
ties QB and QC are derived from QA and Q, hence they are in error in the
same manner.

Random Errors

In order to give a satisfactory estimate of the expected precision
of the experimental measurements, the various random errors and their
probable magnitudes are considered.

Melt Composition.--The melts were prepared by adding weighed samples

 

of BeFa and LiF to the reaction vessel. The precision of weighing and
transferring samples to the vessel was about * 0.2%. The weight per cent of

Li, Be and F was determined chemically on filtered samples. The variation
39

in analyses of successive samples from the same melt was generally * 4%
for each constituent, which was clearly greater than the uncertainty based
on weights of components. Since both LiF and BeFz are hygroscopic, small
amounts of water were included in the weighed samples. Determination of
moisture content of typical samples by the thermogravimetric method indi-
cated 0.1 and 0.4% moisture, respectively. Thus, on the basis of the
above uncertainties in weight and moisture content, the melt compositions,
expressed as mole fraction BeFz, were probably known within % 0.5%.

The amounts of the impurities Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni and S were determined
in the starting materials, in filtered samples of the melt after it had
been sparged with Hz for more than 48 hr, and again immediately after
sparging for 6 hr with a dilute mixture of HF and H20 in Hz. All analyses
were within the following range: Cr always less than 20 ppm, Cu always
less than 100 ppm, Fe usually between 100 and 200 ppm, Ni usually less
than 20 ppm, and S always less than 5 ppm. Total measured impurities only
amount to about 350 ppm which is not significant in terms of melt composi-
tion.

The impurities could, however, cause some uncertainty in the partial
pressure measurements if the impurities reacted to liberate or consume HF
or Hp0 during an experiment. Consumption of HF would have occurred if
sulfide had been present in concentrations greater than 5 ppm by the reac-
tion of S%” with HF in a manner analogous to the reaction of oxide with HF.'Z*'7
Since the impurity levels were not appreciably decreased during the Haz
sparging, the impurities apparently were not reduced to the metallic state.

The results of Blood's study on the stability of the difluorides of nickel,

iron and chromium21 indicate they should eventually be reduced. However,
40

most of the reactions he studied required several days for equilibration.
His results indicate that: the Ni reaction vessel would not react with
HF to produce NiF, concentrations greater than 0.1 ppm with the highest
(PHF)z/PHg ratios employed here; the Cr would have been in the CrFz state
for all (PHF)z/PH2 ratios above 1 x 10”8 (true at all times except for
extended stripping with Ha); the FeFs concentration could have veried be-
tween the time when Hp was used and when (PHF)z/PHg = 4 x 10~* atm.

The Fe probably did not react rapidly enough to interfere (or the
analyses were in error) as indicated by the following experiment. Anhy-
drous HF-Hz mixtures (approximately 0.01 atm HF) were employed to remove
oxide and hydroxide from melt. After the melt was essentially free of

oxide, the effluent P, equaled the influent PHF' The HF was then stopped

HF
and Hz continued. The total amount of HF stripped out was about 5 ppm and

was probably due to HF solubility. If the Fe had been appreciably reduced,
more HF would have been detectable in the stripping gas.

Melt Temperature.--The temperature of the melt varied about * 0.5°

 

during the furnace heating and cooling cycle. The observed temperature
with the thermocouple at different depths in the melt did not vary more
than * 1.0°. Overall, the temperature of a melt was known and constant
to = 1.5°. One exception to the low temperature variation with dept oc-
curred when large amounts of solid IiF were in the melt. In this case
the temperature read about 15 to 20° lower at complete insertion of the
thermocouple than when the themmocouple was withdrawn about 1 in. from
the bottom. Even in this case the temperature varied no more than * 2°

when the thermocouple was withdrawn further. Apparently the solid LiF

settled to the bottom and was not stirred by the bubbling, and as a
41

result, loss of heat out of the end of the vessel was faster than the
transfer of heat from the liquid to unstirred solid.

Titer Precision.-=A 25-1iter reservoir of KOH was standardized with

 

potassium acid phthalate before initial use and again approximately 3 and
6 months later. All values agreed with the average value * 0.1%.

The 150-ml reservoir of the Karl Fischer apparatus was filled as
needed from quart bottles of Karl Fischer Reagent. The reagent was stan-
dardized each time the reservoir was filled and frequently thereafter.
Water (0.050 to 0.080 g) was added directly to the titration wvessel from
a weighing buret and the Karl Fischer titer determined. Successive titra-
tions agreed within #* 0.3%. Usually the concentration change from one
standardization to the next would not exceed 1%. The precision in measur-
ing the concentration of Karl Fischer Reagent was * 0.5%.

The volumes of both KOH and Karl Fischer Reagent used in standardiza-
tions were large enough so that the uncertainties in reading the burets
could be ignored. However, the much smaller volumes used during experi-
mental titrations were known only to % 1.0%.

Wet-test Meter Temperature.--The wet-test meter temperature, which

 

was the temperature of the gas as its volume was being measured, varied

no more than * 0.5° during a given experiment. Due to the variation in

temperature, the variation in measured volume is about * 0.2%, including
the effect due to the change in vapor pressure of water.

Endpoint Precision.--The precision in the timing of endpoints was

 

constant at * 0.5% of the measured value.

Flow-rate Precision.-~The precision in the timing of flow rates was

 

0.1 second per 100 ml. For a typical value of 50 seconds per 100 ml, this

would amount to 0.2%.
42

Statistical Erroxr Analysis

 

The probable error in the calculated quantities can be determined from
the magnitude of random errors in the various measurements. If the contri-
bution of each observable, a5 to the calculated function, Q, is known and
expressed as

a b m
Q=f(Q1:q.‘2: cevene ’qn) 2

and (AQ/Q) x 100 is % probable error in Q and (qu/qi) x 100 is % probable
error in s the contribution of errors can be calculated. If the errors
follow a normal distribution, it can be shown48 that the following equa-
tion allows for partial cancellation of errors of opposite sign:

(AQ/Q)Z = aa(éql/ql)z - bz(éqz/Q2)2 + ceenes + mz(éqn/qn)2 .

Evaluating the above equation numerically for each observable and taking
the square root of both sides will give the probable error in the calcu-
lated quantity.

Volume of Gas Titrated.--

 

ml of gas = f(time of titration, time of flow measurement )
(ml gas/ml gas)? = (0.005)2 + (0.002)% = 29 x 10™°
% probable error in vol of gas = 0.54%.

millimoles Hp0 = f{conec Karl Fischer Reagent, vol Karl Fischer Reagent)
(Amillimoles Hp0/millimoles H20)2 = (0.005)% + (0.010)2 = 125 x 107
% probable error in millimoles Hp0 = l.ll%-

Millimoles HF Titrated by Aliquot.--

 

millimoles HF = f(conc KOH, vol KOH)
(Amillimoles HF/millimoles HF)? = (0.001)2 + (0.010)? = 101 x 10~

% probable error in millimoles HF = 1.00%-

PHgO = f(vol gas, millimoles Hz0, wet-test meter temp)

(aPHZO/PHZO)?' = (0.0054)2 + (0.0111)? + (0.002)? = 154 x 1076
% probable error in pressure Ha0 = 1.24%.

% probable error in P, = 1.15%.

HF
Bquilibrium Quotients.--The exact relationship of Q, QA and QO to

 

all of the variables cannot be expressed in the proper form to calculate
the expected uncertainty. However, use of only the dependence on the
pressure measurements would lead to 2.5, 4.0 and 4.7%, respectively, as
the most precise possible determinations. Both QA and QO depend on inte-
gral relationships between influent and effluent gas which increase the

uncertainty still further.

Tabulation

Saturated Melts

Appendix A contains the data from each experiment performed on a
saturated melt. The experiments are arranged according to a three digit
"Run No." which indicates chronological order. Here, and throughout the
text, numbers preceding "BeF2" denote mole fraction. In the 100 series
the first experiments (101-123) were run in a 2-in.-diam vessel on 305 g
of 0.316 BeFs and 6 g BeO, whereas, for the later experiments (125-129),
enough BeF> was added to give 0.333 BeFa.

In the 200 series a 4-in.-diam vessel was charged with 1522 g of
0.80 BeFz and 10 g BeO for the first experiments (201-213). After this
composition was studied, enough LiF was added to give 0.70 (215-223),
0.60 (225-233), 0.50 (235-241), 0.40 (245-255) and 0.333 BeFa (257-273).

In the 400 series the first experiments (401-409) were run on 0.30
BeFy obtained by adding 44 g LiF and 3.0 g BeO to the melt used in the
300 series. For the later experiments (413-423) 87 g additional LiF was
added to give 0.25 BeFj.

The parameters listed in Appendix A are:

w = wt of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet-test meter, %k
a = influent P, atm x 107
= i 3
¢ = influvent PHQO, atm x 10”7 .
The effluent partial pressures, Py = x and PHgO =y, are tabulated (atm

x 10%) with the corresponding initial and final values of W. Note that
45

the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent of
the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement.

Unsaturated Melts

 

Appendix B contains the data from each experiment performed on an
unsaturated melt. These experiments are also arranged according to a
three digit "Run No." In the 300 series a 2-in.-diam vessel was charged
with 500 g of 0.333 BeFz and anhydrous HF was used to remove oxide from
the melt. Measurements then were made while an aqueous-HF gas stream
was being passed through the melt.

In the 500 series the first experiments (501-527) were run in a 2-in.-
diam vessel containing 500 g of 0.333 BeFz. For the later experiments
(529-539) enough LiF was added to give 0.273 BeFz. Measurements were made
both while anhydrous HF was being used to remove oxide from solution and
while an aqueous~-HF gas stream was being used to add oxide to solution.

In the 600 series a 2-~in.-diam vessel was charged with 424 g of 0.60
BeF2 for the first experiments (601-615). For the later experiments (617-
627) LiF was added to give 567 g of 0.40 BeFa. Measurements were made
during both the removal and addition of oxide.

The format of Appendix B is identical to that of Appendix A except
that influent pressures are reported as P, =a + bW and P = ¢ + dW

HE H20
when gas-mixing method was employed.

Determination of Equilibrium Quotients

The experimental data were correlated according to the model presented

in Chapter I. Computer methods were developed for these correlations.
Saturated Melts

The experiments fall into the following three groups:

Case I. Measurements were made while both PHF and PHgO were still chang-

ing but were stopped before steady state was reached.

Case ITI. Partial pressure measurements were made only after PHF and PHgO

had reached steady state.

Case I1I. Measurements were made in both the changing- and steady-state

regions.

The program was designed to handle all three cases with only Case I
requiring additional input information. In all cases, since x and y were
determined alternately, direct calcuwlation of Q would require interpola-
tion, which was not very satisfactory where x and y were volume dependent.

The procedure of solution is outlined in the following steps:

1. For Case I, Q was specified as part of input information. For Cases
IT and III, Q was not specified; the camputer started with the largest
value of W and compiled average x and y as it moved to successively
lower values of W until the partial pressures became lower than the
average to that point by a specified amount (usually 4%). Safeguards
were build in to prevent the computer prematurely terminating this
process because of unusual scatter.

2. Using all of the partial pressures selected above, the average value
of x and the average value of y were calculated and their standard
deviations were expressed at the 99% confidence level. The best Q
was calculated from these averaged partial pressures and its standard

deviation was calculated from the deviation of its component parts.
&7

3. Using the Q calculated (or Q provided if Case I), each observed y was
1
converted to a corresponding x using the relationship x = (Qy)g, for
the initial region not used in the determination of Q.

4. Next, for each x (observed or calculated from observed y) the quantity

(4/Q)x +1 + [1 + (8A/Q)]%
log = £(w)

(4/Q)x +1 - [1 + (8A/Q) ]%

 

(this relationship was derived in Chapter I) was determined and tabu-
lated along with the midpoint, W,, for each observation.
5. These f(W) were now correlated according to the equation

£(w) = [1 -+ (SA/Q)I% Q (1/
24303

QA)W + constant
to obtain the best value of QA' The standard deviation in QA was cal-
culated by normal method for slope in a straight line correlation.

6. At this point a consistency check was made - the deviations from the
best fit were determined to see if the observed values of x were con-
sistently on one side of the line and values of x calculated from
observed values of y on the other side. If a difference had occurred,
Q could be readjusted or QA determined from x and y separately.

Steps 1 and 2 complete the calculation for Case IIT. Steps 1 through ©
complete the calculation for each experiment.
Several examples of the various cases are given in Figures 3, 4, and 5.

An example of Case I is given in Figure 3a, with the observed values of

x and y indicated by short bars. The line is generated by using the values

for Q and Q, determined by the correlation. Figure 3b is a plot of £(W)

vs W, indicating the linearity of the relationship. TFigure 4a gives an

example of Case III. The flat portion was used to determine Q. QA wa.s
48

determined from the initial region by holding Q constant. A plot of £(w)
vs W is given in Figure 4b for the applicable region of the above run.
Another example of Case I is given in Figure 5a showing the decrease in
x and y when influent HF and Hz0 were stopped and hydrogen sparging con-
tinued. Figure 5b gives a plot of £(W) vs W showing that the function
also holds when influent pressures are zero.

The values obtained for Q and QA fraom all of the saturated-melt ex-
periments are presented in Table 3. The values are arranged according to
composition and temperature of melt. Run numbers are provided for cross

reference with original data in Appendix A.

Unsaturated Melts

 

Determinations of equilibrium quotients involving oxide and hydroxide
were based on material balance between influent and effluent gas. The
differential equations needed for this correlation were developed in Chapter

I. These equations were:

dr/dW = (QOS/QAr)(l +5Q,) -[a +e + (b + a)wl
and
ds/dW = a + 2 + (b + 24)W - (QOS/QAr)(l + 2S/QA) .

A computer program was developed for the similtaneous solution of
these differential equations using the Runge-Cutta method of solution.49
This caleculation required that the adjustable parameters, QO, QA, Ty and
8,9 and the fixed parameters, a, b, c, and d, be specified. With all of
these quantities chosen, the change in r and s with respect to W was calcu-
lated and new values estimated for r and s after the increment AW. The
cycle was then repeated stepwise and the process continued until a value
of W larger than a specified limit, wﬁax’ was reached. In order to deter=-
mine r and s precisely without significant accumulative errors the step
size, AW, had to be restricted so that neither r nor s could change by
more than 10% for any step. Values for r and s were tabulated at the var-
ious values of W corresponding to the end of each step.

With both r and s known, both x and y could be calculated using the
equilibrium relationships. If the relationships
Qy = xs/y and A = xr [y
are solved simultaneously,

X = QOS/QAr and v = Qosz/QAzr .
55

These calculated values of x and y form smooth continuous curves al-
though exact equations for the curves could not be expressed. The deviation
of the observed x and y values from the calculated values was determined.

A general least squares method was used to improve the fit. The partial
derivatives of the x and y curves were determined numerically by making
slight changes in each adjustable parameter (QO, QA, T so) successively.
From the deviations and partial derivatives the adjustments in the param-
eters needed to minimize the squares of the deviations were determined.

With new values for QO, QA’ s and 8, the new values for x and y
were calculated. The least-square subroutine was repeated until the values

for Qo, QA’ r , and s, were essentially constant as indicated by their he-

O,
ing changed less than a preset limit (usually 1%) in successive steps.

The method would not work when the initial guesses were not reasonably
close to the correct values. Upper and lower limits were preset for the
value of each parameter. If these limits were reached the calculation was
terminated and the data resubmitted with different first guesses.

The '"best" values for the parameters Qys Qs T,» and s are reported
in Teble 4. The indirect method for detexrmining these values did not per-
mit calculation of the standard deviatiors of these parameters. Since a
large number of runs are reported for 0.333 BeF,, the spread in the Q and
QA values may be used as an indication of the uncertainties with which
these are known. The values for T, and sO represent concentrations of
oxide and hydroxide at the start of an experiment, hence their variations
are mainly the result of differing histories of the melts. The runs are

arranged according to composition and temperature with run numbers given

for cross reference with the original data in Appendix B.
56

A measure of the goodness of fit is given in Table 5. The mean of
the calculated x curve is given with the standard deviation of the observed
values of x from the calculated values along with the number of cbserved
x points. The corresponding information is also given for y. This tabular
information does not give a complete picture of the correlation, hence the
following figures are included to further show the relationships. ZEach
figure consists of two plots: one showing the calculated values of x and
v as a function of W with the pressure data indicated by short bars, the
other showing the values of oxide and hydroxide (r and s) at the same val-
ues of W needed to obtain the calculated values of x and y for the parameters
specified on each.

Figures 6 through 12 are all for 0.333 BeFz. Figures © and 7 (Runs
303 and 305) show similar conditions (60000) except for the initial oxide
concentration in the melt. Figure 8 (Run 306) shows the decrease in x and
y when the influent HF and H20O were stopped at the end of Run 305 and Ha
sparging continued. Figures 9 and 10 (Runs 307 and 313) are for 700 and
5OOOC, respectively. Figures 11 and 12 (Runs 501 and 511} show the behavior
during higher-temperature (650°C) and lower-temperature (550°C) removal of
oxide from the melt.

Figures 13 through 15 are for 0.273 BeFz. Addition of oxide is shown
in Figure 13 (Run 533) and removal of oxide is shown in Figures 14 and 15
(Runs 535 and 539). Figure 16 (Run 607) shows removal of oxide from 0.600
BeF2 which is near the upper limit of this technique. Figure 17 (Run 621)

shows the addition of oxide to 0.400 BeFgz.

Validity of Results

The general agreement between the calculated and observed effluent
partial pressures of HF and Hp0, in view of the variely of experimental
conditions, supports the method of measurement and indicates that the equi-
libria assumed were correct and sufficient. OSome specific examples which
support these equilibria are given below.

Saturated Melts

 

The first clearcut indication of the formation of hydroxide in mea-
surable amounts came from the variation of effluent pressures with respect
to volume of carrier gas. VWhen a mixture of HF and Ha0 was introduced into
a BeO-saturated melt containing little or no hydroxide, the effluent par-
tial pressures of HF and Hz0 (x and y) increased with the increase in
volume of gas passed in such a manner that x2/y remained constant, vhile
x/y decreased. Since Q = x®r/y and Q = xs/y, the quantity x*/y would
be constant when r is constant (fixed by Be0 saturation) and x/y would
decrease as s increases.

The influent partial pressures of HF and Ha0 were varied and the
resulting Q's compared. Rums 101, 103, and 123 for 0.316 BeF2 at 700°C
(with reported Q values of 2.18 x 1072, 2.47 x 1072, and 2.13 x 10™2,
respectively) had influent pressures such that influent (PHF)a/(PHQO)
were 4.36 x 1072, 4.46 x 1072, and 4.25 x 10”2, respectively. Runs 105,
107, 109, and 111 for 0.316 BeFp at 600°C (with reported @ values of
4,61 x 1073, 4.07 x 1073, 4.09 x 1073, and 4.69 x 10”3, respectively)
also indicated that the cbserved Q's were independent of the influent
pressures, with influent (PHF)z/(PHaO) values being 6.52 x 1072, 2.28 x

1072, 5.54 x 10™2, and 4.98 x 10”2, respectively.
72

These runs include cases where the influent and effluent pressures
were nearly identical and also where quite a bit of HF was required to
react with oxide to form water and the reverse (Hz0 reacting with fluoride
to form HF). All three gave Q's in agreement. In the early runs, the
flow rate of carrier gas was varied from 50 to 150 ml/min and no variation
in the effluent pressures was observed.

The QA values determined using saturated melts were similarly found
to be independent of the ratios of HF and Hp0 in the influent stream. Also,
QA was shown to be independent of whether hydroxide was being added or re-
moved by the gas stream. For example, see the odd-even pairs 401-402,
405-406, and 407-408 in Teble 3 for 0.300 BeFa at 652, 601 and 700°C,
respectively.

The proton balance between influent and effluent gas streams, after
the initial region where hydroxide was being formed, alsc attests toc the
vallidity of the measurement.

After completion of the 200 series the melt was transferred from the
vessel through a sintered nickel filter and the material on the filter
examined by x-ray diffraction. The characteristic peaks for LiF-BeFz and
BeO were observed. There was no indication of compound formation between
BeO and the fluoride melt or of other constituents [such as Lia0 or Be(OH)a]-

Unsaturated Melts

 

In addition to the tests performed with saturated melts, the validity
of Qo was checked by conducting experiments in which oxide was being added
and a8lso when oxide was being removed. The former, more precise results,

and the latter were in reasonable agreement.
73

The total pressure of the reactive gases was varied by changing the
termperature of the saturator with no noticeable effect on the QO and QA

values.
7
IV. DISCUSSION

The measured equilibrium quotients, Q, QA’ and QO, were correlated
with temperature and melt composition in terms of simple algebraic expres-
sions. In the case of Q, wherein Ka = Q/aBer, the resulting correlation
can be used to derive a considerable amount of thermodynamic information
about the LiF-BeFp solutions and, by extrapolation, about pure BeF, liquid.
Combination of Q and QO can be used to obtain the concentration of oxide
at BeO saturation. The variation of QA with melt composition and tempera-

ture reflects the stability of hydroxide in LiF-BeF; melts.
Correlation of Q

For each composition, the Q values were correlated according to the
equation log Q = slope(1/T) + constant. The Q's were weighted by an amount
inversely proportional to their variance since all measurements did not
follow the same parent distribution. The values of the parameters are
presented in Table 6.

Since one of the primary objectives was determination of thermodynamic
properties of Bng(i), extrapolation of these data as a function of XBng
to the pure liquid BeF; was desirable. For a given temperature,
log (Q/XBng) Vs (XLiF)2
forms a parabola for the composition range 0.30 to 0.80 BeFz, thus the Q
values at various compositions were correlated by the function
log (9/Xg p,) =k + (X p)? + m(x, )% -

From definition in Chapter I, log Ka = k, therefore, correlation of k as
a function of 1/T will yield the thermodynamics of the desired reaction.

Both 1 and m also show linear dependence upon l/T- For the coefficients
75

expressed according to k = k° + k'(1/T), etc.

¥° =  3.900 * 0.019 k' = 4418 £ 17
1° = 7.819 % 0.225 1! = =5440 = 218
m° = -12.66 * 0.60 m! = 5262 + 513 .

From the above parameters, equations were generated for each experimental
composition as a function of (l/T). The smoothed parameters obtained are
tabulated in Table 7. The lines generated by the smoothed parameters for
the various experimental compositions are shown in Figure 18 along with
log K, vs (1/T) for pure BeF2(l) based on the extrapolation. Figure 19
provides a measure of this correlation. The quantity des/Qcalc is shown
for each experimental run. The standard deviation for each point is rep-
resented by a vertical bar.
Activity of BeFp and LiF

Since Q is equal to Ké(aBer),
log (Q/¥p.p,) = log K lap p )/(Xpg) = Tog K + 1og (ap p /Xpp,)
By definition, aBng is unity for pure liquid BeF; (XBer = l), therefore,
log (aBer/l) = Q0. Since XiiF = 0 at this point,
log K, = k® + k'(1/T)
In order to solve for log (aBer/Xéer), which is log 7ﬁeF2’ at any com=-

position the value of log K  must be subtracted from log (Q/XBer) leaving

- O L, 11 2 0 1 4
log Yo, = 17 + 11 (/D) IXP 0 + [ + (/M 1% 0
At a specified temperature, the variation in ZBng with composition
is given by

- ox® 4 pxh .
10g Yo, = Kpip X p

Values for the parameters at three temperatures are presented below:

600 1.589 0.356 ~-6.66 0.85
700 2.229 0.338 -7.25 0.80

The quoted uncertainties in ¢ and B lead to an average uncertainty of

* 0.10 units in log 7. From these uncertainties the values 100°

BeFp'
apart would overlap within the quoted uncertainty, but the values for
500 and 700°C definitely do not overlap.

According to the Gibbs-Duhem Equation, if the activity (or activity
coefficient) of one component is known as a function of composition, the
other can be determined by integration of the equation
d 1n (72) = -X1/%X2 4 1n (71) .

From the equations given for log 7EeF2 as a Tunction of composition

at specified temperatures, integration was carried out as follows:

Twvo methods for evaluating C for various temperatures were considered.
For a given temperature, if NiF is known for one composition, C can be

determined and, hence, 1T determined for all compositions. First,
77

7LiF was calculated from the reported composition at LiF liquidus at
various temperatures vhere a, .. £ 1 and ¥ o = l/XLiF' The values for
7LiF at the various temperatures were determined from the published phase
diagram2 which was presented in Chapter I. The second method involved

the use of the Q values for BeO=-saturated melts in contact with solid IiF

to determine the XiiF at saturation. (The measured Q's are tebulated in
Teble 3 and the parameters for smoothed fit are given in Table 6.) The
equations for log aBng as a function of composition and log aBng at

IiF saturation were solved simultaneously to obtain XiiF' With the con-
centration of LiF at Bap = 1 known, Yr 4T could be evaluated. The following
values for C were obtained by the two methods.

700 0.208 1.263 +0.283 0.256 1.344 0451

Agreement of values of C determined by both methods is very good at 500
and 600 but not at 700°C. Although ILiF saturation at 700°C oceurs at
0.208 BeFa, the value of C corresponding to a calculated saturation value
of 0.256 BeFa was considered more acceptable because the parabolic func-
tion does not fit the data well below 0.30 BeFz. In fact, at 0.25 BeFa
(data at 650 and 700°C) the fit is very poor.

Other empirical expressions were tried in an attempt to improve the
fit in this region. No improvement was obtained using expressions con-
taining additional odd-powers of XLiF’ but a very good fit was obtained

from 0.25 to 0.50 BeFa by using an equation containing X%, X%, and X
78

terms. Correlation of the data at 700°C gave the following equation:

This equation should be compared with the correlation using only X? and

X% terms:
log (@/Xp.p ) = -0.640 + 2.220%% . o - 7.25%% L

Both fit equally well between 0.33 and 0.50 BeFp, but the former fits
better for concentrations below 0.33 BeFs and the latter fits better for
concentrations above 0.50 BeFz. In order to obtain values for ZBeFa from
the former equation, the constant term was adjusted to yield the same vale-
ue of 7Bng (at 0.40 Bng) as was given by the simpler expression used to
express activities above 0.30 BeFz. The expression obtained for log ZBeFa
was given by:

The (-*-+-) line shows the predicted behavior of log Tper, o0 the

Since aBng = X BeF as defined above, the activity coefficient of BeF;

assumed equal to the mole fraction X'

ZBer = (BXBng - l)/ZXaBeFa ’

This procedure of redefining components is similar to the method of
Flood and Urnes;50 however, the assumed proportionality of aBeFa to its
mole fraction is purely arbitrary and the resulting correlation, which is
rather good, is, therefore, entirely empirical. It might be more reason=-

able in this model to expect to be proportional to the product of

aBeFa

mixture of the four ions Li+, Be2+, F, and BeF42'. In order to rationalize

. * 1 -

the proportionality of aBng to X BeFa it seems necessary to adopt one of

the following unattractive models for the components

IiBeF,; (undissociated) + BeFa (undissociated)

or

Liz?t BeF,2™ + Be?t BeF,2" .

A more realistic approach to an interpretation of the behavior of

aBng and arsp con perhaps be made in terms of models such as have been
80

proposed by F‘drland-5l According to this model BeFa(%) is assumed to be
a three-dimensional polymer of BeF4°~ tetrahedra with common corners, and
the addition of LiF is assumed to break the Be-~F-Be bonds. However, no
such correlation will be attempted here.
Two features of the observed variation of aBng are especially note-
worthy:
(1) The rapid drop in Tger, &5 Xpep, 8PProaches 0.33, at all temperatures,
suggests the formation of BeF4%~ ion.

(2) The temperature coefficient of 7 indicates increasing positive

BeF2

deviations from Raoult's law with increasing temperature at high
XBer values.

The activities of BeFz and IiF were calculated from the activity
coefficients as a function of composition and temperature. The activities
at 500, 600, and 700°C are shown in Figure 21. The plot of activities,
which should be proportional to the partial pressures of BeFz and LiF,
corresponds to the predicted behavior of a system showing incomplete mis-
cibility.52 Since the positive deviations increase with temperature,
these data seem to indicate that the system has a lower consolute temper=-
ature near 700°C and 0.80 BeFp. Although the number of determinations of
Q in this area is not extensive enough to definitely show the formation
of two liquid phases, the indication is strong enough to warrant further
investigation of this possibility. To date there is no clearcut evidence
of partial immiscibility in the LiF-BeFz system although various investi-
gators have considered the possibility of such occurrence.53'55 The MgO-
5102 system, which has frequently been compared with the LiF-BeFz system,l

indeed does show a miscibility gap. At least one case has been reported
81

for a similar fluoride melt. At low LiF concentrations in the system,
LiF-BeF,~-ZrFs;, evidence was obtained from quenched samples that two immis-
cible liquids were formed above the ZrF, primary phase field.56

The IiF activity exhibits large positive deviations at low BeFp con-
centrations; however, it should be kept in mind that these activities are
referred to the solid rather than the supercoocled liquid (if the latter
were used as the reference state, all of the activities would be lower).
The activities reported in the present work are in general agreement with
previous measurements (surmerized in Teble 2). The largest discrepancy
is in the value for LiF at 0.50 BeFz reported by Berkowitz and Chupka-22
The value for IiF by Bﬁchler24 is in reasonable agreement. Also, Biichler
obtained greater activities for BeFz at higher temperatures.23 Special
attention should be given to the value reported for 0.67 BeFz (displaying
very large positive deviations) which corresponds very closely to present
values. This agreement is particularly gratifying since three completely
different techniques have been used to obtain the values. Also, the pre~
vious studies were performed with melts which did not have BeO present.
The presence of BeO would not be expected to affect the activities since
BeO is only slightly soluble. Beryllium oxide could not have affected
the Gibbs~Duhem integration since BeO was always present as a saturating
phase, thereby restricting its activity to unity.

The expression for the relative partial molal heat content is given

Since the activity coefficient of BeFz is given by an analytical

culated from

Since 1n yBng is a function of temperature, this equation does not lend
itself to easy tabular or graphic presention (unless in a plot similar
to Figure 20); however, the analytical expression should be useful for

further calculations involving the excess chemical potential.

Thermodynamics of BeFa(1)

 

From the correlation of Q as a function of temperature and composition
for the reaction
BeF2(1) + H20(g) = Beo(s) + 2HF(g)
involving pure liquid BeFa, the equation expressing equilibrium constant
values is
log K, = (3.900 * 0.019) = (4418 * 17)(1/T)
or
OF = -(17.85 * 0.09)T + (20,217 *+78) .

From this equation, the AH are 20.22 keal/mole BeFa

reaction’ 2 “Sreaction
and 17.85 eu/mole BeFa2, respectively. As indicated in Chapter I, the ther-
modynemic values of Ha0(g), HF(g), and BeO(s) are fairly well established.
Thus, by using these values and the relationships from the above reaction,
new values for Apr, Aﬂpf, Asof, and S° of BeFa(l) can be calculated. These

are tabulated below along with the reported values from JANAF-4

While the present values are not in close agreement with the published
values, they provide the most direct experimental method of evaluating the
thermodynamic properties of BeF2(1). If these values for BeFa(l) are com-
bined with the data of Greenbaum, gglgi-lo for the vapor pressures of
Bng(é), new values for the thermodynamics of Ber(g) can be obtained.

These are tabulated below along with the values reported in JANAF.

The values of Aﬂpf and S° of Ber(g) reflect significant difference between
these results and those of Greenbaum, EE_§£.5 for the reaction
BeO(s) + 2HF(g) = BeFa(g) + Ha0(g) .

Since the velues of AF°. from the two methods are in reasonable agreement,

£
the greatest source of difference must be in the temperature dependence of

the equilibrium quotients.
In addition to the thermodynamic properties of BeFa(l) and BeFa(g),
the present study provides a means of determining thermodynamic properties

of BeFa(s) through determination of the heat of fusion, AH If pure

fusion’

solid BeFz separates upon cooling the LiF-BeF; system, the relation between

a and the freezing temperature T at a given concentration XBer in the

values of 7BeF2 were calculated for the specified temperatures and compo=-

is given in Figure 22. The slope of this correlation leads to a value
90

of 11 * 3 keal/mole for Aﬂfusion' The other lines presented in the figure
include: +the line obtained if Aﬂfusion = 1.6 kcal/mole; the line obtained
if TBeF, = 1 (i.e., log Rers VS 1/T); the line obtained if Mo ion =

7.5 keal/mole.

The value of 1.6 kcal/mole for AH was included for comparison

fusion
because this value was recently reported57 from comparison of AHSUbl with
éigap- Both measurements were from the variation of vapor pressures with
temperature over solid and liquid, respectively. One discrepancy in these
data, which is not mentioned in the article, is that the vapor pressures
reported for the solid near the melting point are greater than the extrap-
olated wvapor pressures of the liquid by a factor of three. The faet that
the reported vapor pressures for the solid and liquid do not intersect even
near the melting point is indicative of a systematic error in one or the
other sets of measurements since both sets seem internally consistent.

The value of 7.5 keal/mole for AH was included for camparison

fusion

because this is the value obtained if aﬂfusion is determined to be the dif-

ference between Aﬁpf of BeFa(1l) calculated here and Aﬂpf of BeFa(s) reported
in JANAF.” The AHOf of BeFa(s) is based on the heat of solution measure-
ments on BeO and BeFz in agqueous HF by Kolesov, gg.gi.58 Since there is
some question regarding the accuracy of the reported results, the value of
Mo oo, 1s about 7.5 & 6 keal/mole. Although the present results do not
definitely establish the value of AH, . . of BeFa(s), they do tend to sup-
port the value of 12 kcal/mole reported in JANAF rather then that of 2
keal/mole used in the JANAF tabulation or the more recently reported value

of 1.6 keal/mole.

Correlation of QA

The vaelues of Q, reported in Tables 3 and 4 were correlated with

respect to temperature and composition. Visual inspection indicated that

the values exhibited linear dependence on both temperature and composition.

The general equation for the correlation was obtained in the following

manner.

(1)

(2)

(3)

The values at each temperature were grouped to determine the slope of
the line

log Q, = (slope)XEer + constant

The least-square slopes at the five experimental temperatures were as

follows:
Temp (°c) Slope No. of Values
500 2.695 * 0.473 6
550 2.480 = 0.357 11
600 3.123 % 0.174 22
650 2.847 * 0.207 16
700 2.775 £ 0.175 20

Using weights equal to the number of data points for each line, the
average slope was determined to be 2.843. All of the values agree
with this slope within the quoted standard deviations except the wvalue
at 600° which is slightly larger.

With the slope of all lines set at 2.843, the value of log QA at the
composition intercept (XBer = 0) was determined at each temperature

to give best fit to data as shown below:
23

 

 

Temp (°C)  1log @, Temp (°C)  log Q,
500 -3.138 650 ~2.757
550 -3.056 700 -2,638
600 "'"2 .893

(4) These end values were used to calculate the function of log QA vs l/T,
vhich is log Q, = -2085(1/T) - 0.503. Thus, the best smoothed velues
for QA over the experimental range are given by
log Q, = 2‘843XBeF2 - 2085(1/T) - 0.503 .

The observed values of QA and the calculated values based on the above
function are shown in Figure 23. Since the data at the various temperatures
overlap, the coordinates are specified for each line independently. The
standard deviations of the points are not shown in the figure, but most
points agree within the quoted standard deviations in Table 3. The values
determined in BeO-saturated melts are shown by closed symbols and those in
unsaturated melts by open symbols.

The concentration of hydroxide present at equilibrium for known par-
tial pressures of HF and Hz0 above a melt of known composition could be
calculated using the relationship for QA,

Q, = (PHF/PHzo)[OH"] = mole/kg ,

derived from the reaction

H20(g) + F (soln) = HF(g) + OH (soln) .

Other equilibria involving hydroxide were also introduced in Chapter
I. One reaction is
Hz0(g) + 0%27(soln) = 20H (soln)
from which

Q = [OH”]a/'PH20 = (QA)z/Q
%

for a BeO-saturated melt. Since expressions for both Q and QA are known,
the values of QB can be derived. If the equation given earlier for
log (Q/XBer) 18 rearranged in terms of Xz .. rather then X ;p, the follow-
ing equation is obtained
log (Q/XBeFa) = ~0.940 - 4596(1/T) + [35.00 - 10168(1/T)])<'BeF2

If this equation is combined with the expression for QA, the following

IF(g) + 0% (soln) == OH (soln) + F (soln)

from which

Qy = [0 ]/PHF = QA/Q for a BeO-saturated melt.

Therefore,

log Qy = log Q, - log Q = 0.437 + 2511(1/T) + [-32.16 + 10168(1/T)]X'Ber

The parameters of the equation

log Q = slope(1/T) + constant

are tabulated below for various experimental compositions:

 

 

XBng Slope Constant XBeFa Slope Constant
0.30 3734 -3.819 0.60 3068 -3 404
0.333 3714 ~3.960 0.70 2780 -2.862
0.40 3609 ~4.052 0.80 2541 -2.348

If the above functions are used to evaluate equilibrium quotients
for 0.333 BeFp, the values obtained and Aﬂi based on integration of the

van't Hoff equation are given below:

Equilibrium Aﬁ?
Quotients Q at 800°K Q at 1000°K (kcal/mole)

 

Qy 6.90 x 10™3 2.29 x 107% 9.5
Qg 3.33 x 1072 1.30 x 10™2 7.5
Q 4 .80 5.70 x 10”1 -17.0

Fach of these equilibrium quotients is in terms of moles of hydroxide per

kilogram of melt due to experimental expediency, but they could be converted
to the mole fraction scale by dividing each by moles of solvent per kilogram
of melt. This conversion would not affect the Aﬂf values. The above values
of equilibrium quotients involving hydroxide may not provide enough informa-

tion to establish the complete nature of hydroxide in the IiF-BeF2 systemn,
96

but they do allow quantitative prediction of the extent of conversion of
oxide to hydroxide, which is the principal controlling step in the removal

of oxide by HF-sparging.

Correlation of Q0

The vealues of QO reported in Table 4 were correlated as a function of
temperature at each composition. The parameters of the equation
log Qg = slope(1/T) + constant

are given below:

 

XBng slope * O constant * o No. of Points
0.333 -8637 £ 349 5.673 = 0.401 24
0.400 -9032 + 706 7.026 * 0.812 4

The values of QO and the corresponding correlations as a function of
temperature are shown in Figure 24. Since the two values for 0.60 BeFz
would not yield a line with slope or intercept similsr to the others, a
line was drawn parallel to the line at 0.40 BeFz so as to be equidistant
between the two values at 0.60 BeFz.

Measurement of QO at high BeFz compositions is limited because the
rete of change in P, and P with respect to W approaches the precision

HF Ha0

of measurements of the low PHgO and high PHF encountered. Although addi-
tional experiments were performed on 0.60 BeFp, convergence in the solution

of equations to obtain QO’ QA’ r , and 8, was not reached due to the exper-

0)
imental limitation mentioned above.
The data on unsaturated melts were neither extensive nor preclse
enough to permit a meaningful correlation with respect to melt composition.

However, the solubility of BeO could be determined by comparison of these

measurements with those of BeO-saturated melts.

The value of Q at BeO saturation was established in the earlier work. Divi-
sion of QO by Q for the same melt composition and temperature would provide
the concentration of oxide at saturation.
The values of Q needed to determine BeO solubility are given by the

following parameters for the equation

log Q = slope(1/T) + constant:

 

XBng Slope Constant

0.273 -5900 44150
0.333 -5674 4a233
0.400 -5565 4.528
0.600 =524 4745

The solubilities in moles per kilogram of oxide in the various experiments,
as determined from QO/Q using observed QO values and smoothed Q values
from the above relation, are given in Table 8. Since

[0*7] = o,/ ,

log [0°7] = log Q; - log & ,

and as both log QO and log Q show linear dependence with (l/T), log [027]
should also show linear dependence. Combination of the parameters for QO
and Q leads to

log [0%7] = slope(1/T) + constant:
100

 

f@i@& Slope Constant
0.273 -2258 0.641
0.333 -2963 1.440
0.400 - 3467 2.498

Each of the observed solubilities is shown in Figure 25 along with the
calculated expressions for the three compositions tabulated above.

Since many more experiments were performed on 0.333 BeFz, the range
of measured solubilities at each temperature provides a rough measure of
just how well these are known. A clear trend of solubility with tempera-

ture is shown:

500°C (2.5 -~ 6.0) x 10~3 moles/kg
600 (7.2 - 11.8) x 103
700 (2.3 - 3.8) x 107%

The other values indicate that BeQO solubility may be increasing slightly

with BeFz, but the increase 1is not very great.

Summary

These studies of equilibria between HF, H20, and molten LiF-BeF2 had
a twofold purpose: (1) to determine as much as possible about the thermo-
dynemics of the 1iF-BeF system, and (2) to determine as mch as possible
about the oxide chemistry of the system.

The thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeF2 were determined as a
function of temperature and composition. The major characteristics of
the system include:

(1) Positive deviations from ideality at high BeF, concentrations.

(2) Increasing positive deviations of the activity with temperature indi-
cating the probability of a miscibility gaep near 700°C.

(3) Combination of activities with previously published phase diagram
indicate a higher value for Aﬂfusion of BeFz than currently used in
thermodynamic compilations.

(4) Activities determined with BeO present are in agreement with limited
previous data.

Extrapolation of data to pure liquid BeF,, which is inaccessible
experimentally because of high viscosity, provides a means of determining
thermodynamic properties of BeFa(l).

The equilibria between Hp0, HF, and dissolved hydroxide were studied
by estimating, from material balance calculations on the gas phase, the
amount of OH formed in or removed fram the melt upon reaction. The re-
sults from measurements on both BeO-saturated and unsaturated melts were
consistent. The results indicate that significant amounts of hydroxide

were formed in the presence of 0.0l atm HF, but OH could not exist in

the absence of HF and Hz0-
105

The equilibria between Hp0, HF, and dissolved oxide were also evalu-
ated with melts not saturated with BeO. The solubility of BeO was estimated
by combination of these results with those for BeO-saturated melts.

These results suggest methods to attack at least two allied problems:
(1) Determination of thermodynanmic activities of other fluorides dissolved

in the LiF-BeFp system; and
(2) Determination of the amount of oxide in fluoride melts.

The procedure used here to determine activities of BeO-saturated melts
could be applied to melts saturated with other sparingly soluble oxides.
Variation in Q with amount of corresponding fluoride dissolved in melt would
provide information necessary to calculate change in activities.

The experiments performed here on unsaturated melts required determi-
nation of the concentration of oxide present at the start of an experiment
in addition to the equilibrium quotients. If oxide analyses were required
on similar melts, the equilibrium quotients could be evaluated and treated
as fixed parameters, thus the variation in effluent PHF and. PHgO to a small
value of W (about 1.0) could be used to calculate the amount of oxide in
the sample prior to treatment. In principle, this should work no matter
whether oxide were being added or removed. The presence of saturating
solid oxide would complicate the analysis, but the total amount of oxide
present could be determined by treatment with anhydrous HF and measurement

of the evolved H0.

APPENDIX A

Partial Pressures from Studies on BeO=Saturated Melts

The experiments are arranged according to & three digit "Run No."
which indicates chronological order. There are three series (100, 200,
400) included. A brief history of each series is given in Chapter III.

The information provided for each experiment includes:

Run No.
Composition of melt (expressed as mole fraction Bng)

Temperature of melt, °c

w = weight of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet-test meter, °k

a = influent Pr, atm x 103
- 3 3
¢ = influent PHgO’ atm x 10
The effluent partial pressures, PHF = x and PHao =y, are tabulated (atm

x 103) with the corresponding initial and final values of W (V/WRT). Note
that the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent
of the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement. The equilibrium

quotients evaluated from each experiment are presented in Table 3.

APPENDIX B
Partial Pressures from Studies on Unsaturated (with respect
to Be0) Melts
The experiments are arranged according to a three digit "Run No."
which indicates chronological order. There are three series (300, 500,
600) included. A brief history of each series is given in Chapter III.
The information provided for each experiment includes:
Run No.
Composition of melt (expressed as mole fraction BeF3)
Temperature of melt, °C
w = weight of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet~test meter, Ok

1

a + bW = influent Pi, atm x 102
7 2 3
+ N =
c + dh influent PHgO’ atm x 10
The effluent partial pressures, PHF = x and PHgO =y, are tabulated (atm
%x 103) with the corresponding initial and final values of W. Note that
the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent of

the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement. The equilibrium

quotients evaluated from each experiment are presented in Table 4.
