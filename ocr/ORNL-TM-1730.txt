CONSIDERATIONS OF ‘LOW PRESSURE DISTILLATION AND ITS APPLICATION
TO. PROCESSING OF MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR FUELS

_L.-E.-McNeese
| ABSTRACT‘

Distillation at low ‘pressure was examined as a: method
for removing rare- earth fluorides from the fuel stream of
-a molten-salt breeder reactor,' ‘It was concluded that 'dis- - .
tillation allows: adequate rare earth fluoride removal with
‘the simulténeous recovery of more ‘than 99,5% of the fuel
salt. Characteristics of equilibrium and molecular =
distillation were noted and expressions for the relative !
volatility of rare earth fluorides were derived for these
types of distillation. 7 . e -

- Expressions for the separation potential of several
modes of distillation were derived and reported rare
earth fluoride relative volatilities were shown‘to:allow_,

& great deal of latitude in still design and operational

- mode. It was concluded that a single contact stage such
as a well mixed liquid pool provides adequate rare earth.

-fluoride removal and that rectification is not required

. The buildup of rare earth fluorides at the vapori-
zation surface was shown to seriously reduce the R
effectiveness of a distillation system, .Liquid circu-

 lation was shown to be an effective means for preventing
"buildup of rare earth fluorides at vaporization surfaces.'

"lgjlleRObUCTION |

The molten*salt breeder reactor (MSBR) is a reactor concept

having ‘the possibilities of economic nuclear power production and

simultaneous breeding of fissile'material using the thorium-uranium -

'ri'fuel cycle. The reactor will be fueled with a mixture of molten

fluoride salts’ which will c1rcu1ate continuously through the reactor

core where fission occurs and through the primary heat exchanger"

';where most of the fission energy is removed The reactor will employ'r

a blanket of molten fluorides containing a fertile material. (thorium)

 
 

in order. to: increase the neutron- economy of the system by the con-.

version of thorium to fissile uran1um-233 A close-coupled processing

facility,for removal of fission products, corrosion products, and
fissile materials from these fused fluoride mixtures will be an

integral part of the reactor system..

1t has been proposed that the rare earth fluorides (REF) and
fluorides of Ba, Sr, ‘and Y be removed from the fuél stream by -
vacuum distillation. The purpose of this report is to examine
various factors pertinent to such an operation and to compare several

methods for effecting ‘the . distilIation_ .
2. }DISTILLATION’AT,LOW‘PRESSURE -

The vaporization of a liquid is normally carriedlout under . -
conditions such that the 1liquid and vapor phases are essentially '
in thermodynamic equilibrium. -This condition may cease to exist
1f the distillation pressure is reduced sufficiently; and phenomena

peculiar to low pressure distillation may be observed.

-In discussing digtillation at lowfpressure,,it'is convenient

to'make-a distinction between two modes of distillation-' equilibrium |

distillation and molecular distillation. During equilibrium
distillation, a kinetic equilibrium exists at the liquid-vapor
interface owing to the presence of a vapor atmosphere above the
liquid which has the net effect of immediately returning most of the
vaporizing molecules to theoliquid surface. In contrast, molecular
‘distillation is carried out in the absence of such an atmosphere

and the vaporizing molecules reach the condensing surface without
experiencing collisions ‘with other gas molecules or with the walls
of the system. In the following sections, consideration will be
given to characteristics of these modes of distillation, to. values ‘i
of the mean free path under conditions of Anterest for MSBR , N
’ processing, and to calculated values of maximum vaporization rates

to be expected

2.1 Equilibrium Distillation

Equilibrium distillation can be further divided into ebullient

distillation and evaporative distillation. Ebullient distillation N

occurs when bubbles of vapor form within the bulk of the liquid
which remains at a temperature such that -the vapor preSSure is
equal to the total external pressure acting on the liquid (in the

absence of other gases Boiling‘prOmotes mixing in the liquid

.and the surface from which vaporization occurs is not depleted in

the ‘more- volatile species,

“Evaporative distillation occurs when the distillation is carried
out at a temperature below.the bdiling‘point of the liquid. Under

‘these conditions there ie no formation of bubbles at points below

the ‘1iquid surface and no visiblemovenent‘of the ‘1iquid surface,
Transfer of the more volatile species to the. liquidisurface occurs

by a combination of molécular’diffusionﬁand convective mixinglso:'

that depletion of this species in“the viéinity of the- surface is

possible, _However, the rate of distillation is relatively low owing
to the kinetic equilibrium which exists ‘at the liquid-vapor -interface
and the liquid surface may have ‘a composition near that of the bulk

‘1iquid.

‘o.2 'Molecularr‘Distillation |

Mblecular distillation is quite similar to evaporative distillation

-in that vaporization occurs only from a quiescent liquid surface

end in that ‘the vaporizing species 1s transferred .to the surface by

- molecular. diffusion and convective mixing. However, few of the

vaporizing molecules are returned to ‘the liquid surface by

"collisions in the vapor space above the liquid and vaporizdtion -
: 1proceeds at the greatest rate’ possible at the operating temperature.

| f In order to achieve this condition, the distance between the

vaporizing surface andstheieondensing-surface should_theoretically

l,beqleSS'than_the "meanﬂfree"path“of-thehdistilling moleculeS. This

condition - is seldom realized in practice, however ‘the distance should

do those- of evaporative distillation at the ‘same temperature where
vaporization is impeded by the vapor - atmosphere above the liquid |
‘which serves to Teturn most of the vaporized molecules to the liquid lﬁ,

surface,

“In a distillation‘system, the gases in the region between the -

vaporizing liquid and the condenser normally consist of a mixture

2.3 Mean Free Path

These conditions favor a

of ‘the distilling molecules and molecules of noncondensable gases.-“

. The calculation of the mean free path in this region is complicated

by the fact that the vaporizing molecules, which have a net velocity

 component directed away from the liquid surface, pass into 8as
vhose molecules are in random motion.

Values for the mean free path of LiF in Ar and in LiF at 1000 C

'LiF at a pressure of 1 nm Hg-1s approximately 0. O4 cm and that at a
pressure of 0.0l mm Hg, the mean free path of LiF is approximately
4 cm., These distances are probably quite small in comparison with '

~ the distance between the condenser and the surface from which

vaporization will occur- in an MSBR distillation system. ‘Hence, the
rate of distillation in an MSBR system will be set by the pressure

:-drop ‘between the liquid surface-and the condensing surface. . The
~values for the mean free path are sufficiently large that slip-flow

may be of importance in presgure drop considerations,

Thus
or |

W = 0.0583 P—T P
The assumptions implicit in the use of this relation for cal- : ..
-culating the rate of vaporization from a liquid surface include P
the following: '
(1) The liquid surface is plane.
(2) The liquid surface is of infinite extent, i.e. collisions

-of molecules with the vessel walls in the vapor space must -

exert a negligible influence on the rate of vaporization. a e

(3) The vapor behaves as an ideal gas.ki,

-F

(4) Every part of the liquid surface is within a fraction of ﬂ- o

the mean free path from every other part or from a
condensing surface,-i.e., thereffect of collisions between
evaporating molecules on the ratehof vaporization is
negligible. | S - «

(5) The number of molecules-leaving the liquid surface is not
affected by the number striking the surface. |

(6) Vapor molecules striking_therliquid surface are absorbed
and revaporized in a direction given by a cosine relation
which is independent of the direction of aoproach atithe

moment of absorption.

When applied to the vaporization of LiF-BeF2 mixtures, the

poorest .of these assumptions is likely that of considering the vapor “i__m

to behave as an ideal gas since it is known that gaseous_LiF ‘tends

to associate. The vaporization rate given by Eq. 11 represents the
maximum rate at which vaporization will occur and hence sets an
upper limit on the vaporization rate. Values forvthe-Langmulr
vaporization rate of LiF are given in Fig. 2. The vaporisation‘rates-
observed in practice may be considerably lower than the Langmuir rate

since the fourth assumption is rarely met,

2.5 Probable QOperating Mode for MSBR Processing

The mode of distillation currently envisioned for proceSSing
MSBR fuel salt is that of single stage equilibrium distillation at
950°~1050°C and at a pressure of -approximately 1 mm Hg. The -
composition of liquid in equilibrium with vapor having the composition
of MSBR fuel salt (64 mole 4 LiF - 36 mole ¢ BeFy) is approximately
88 mole % LiF - 12 mole % BeF. The vapor pressure of liquid of
this composition is ~ 1.5 mm Hg at~lQOO°C_.5 -Hence, evaporative
distillation, with surface vaporization onli, will occur if the
distillation is carried out at a pressure greater than 1.5 mm Hg.
However, if the distillation is carried out at a pressure lower than
‘1.5 mm Hg, boiling could occur below the liquid surface. At a pressure
of 0.5 mm Hg, boiling could occur to a depth of about 0.7 cm. The
actual depth to which boiling would occur is-dependent on the
vertical variation of liquid temperature and composition (and hence
vapor pressure) and on the extent of superheating of the liquid;
the value of 0.7 cm assumes a constant temperature and concentration
and no superheat throughout the bulk of the liquid. Boiling in the
vicinity of the liquid surface would promote convective mixing
which would result in a lower rare earth fluoride concentration
at the liquid surface than would be observed without such mixing.

The lower surface concentrations would in turn decrease the relative

rate of volatilization of REF with respect to LiF.

 

.Molecular distillation offers two advantages over either type
of equilibrium distillation in.that (1) the distillation proceeds
at the maximum rate, and (2) a greater separation of rare earth

fluorides from the MSBR fuel salt is possible as will be discussed

~ in the section on relative volatilities. 1Its chief disadvantages
are the low pressure required to achieve this type of ‘distillation
and the increased likelihood of an undesirable buildup of rare eafth

fluoride at the liquid surface.

The MSBR distillatlon system will probably be operated at the

vapor pressure of the liquid at the vaporization surface or possibly

 
oy

L)

 

11

.at a pressure:0,5-1.0 mm Hg lower than the vapor pressure. A decrease

in pressure could yield an increase :in distillation rate-and/or -a
deerease-in operating-temperature. Entraimment -at the lower pressures
should'be»consideree.'\It'is improbable thatjthe'advantages to be
gained'by'molecnlar'distillation justify the;efforthnecessary to attain

this mode of operation.

4.6 Comparison of Methods Considered

A comparison of the various distillation methods must take

account of numerous factors such as separation potential

operability, economics, etc. Consideration of all of these factors

is beyond the scope of this report, however, the two topics of

separation potential and operational simplicity will be discussed

For currently envisioned processing rates, the required removal.
efficiency for the rare earth fluorides is approximately 90% for
the more important neutron poisons (Pm, Nd, Sm) and less,for other
members of this group. It should be recalled that the real
requirement is the rate at which neutron poisons are removed from

the reactor system, hence the "required removal efficiency"” can be

-lowered at the expense of an increased throughput in the processing

plant. With this in mind,!a rare earth‘fluoride;removal'efficiency
of 90% will be used as a basis for discussion of separation potential
for the various distillation methods.

As shown in Table 1, recent measurements indicate the relative
volatilities (referred to LiF) of some of the fore important rare |
earth fluorides to be 6 x 10 % for NdFs, 5 x 10 % for SmFs, and
3 x 10 # for LaFs at 1000°C in LiF, The relative volatility of CeFg
was found to be 3 x 10-3,.however; the required removal effiCienoy.' o
for CeFs is only 84.

~ methods considered is given in Table 2. The values were calculated

for a REF relative volatility'of.ﬁ.x'10f4-and.a'LiF'recovery of
99.5%. As would be expected, the éontinuous system yields_the
-‘pporest-REF'removal.(91%) although this is an adequate removal
efficiency. The removal efficiency fof a semicontinuous system is.
somewhat higher (95.2%). The combination of semicontinuous dis-
" tillation followed by batch operation to yield a 10% heel results-
in a REF removal of 99.5% which is comparable to that obtained with
'batch'bpération (99.744). The effectiveness of rectification is
~ pointed. out by the REF removal (99. 99674) for a semicontinuous f ;
system containing one theoretical plate in addition to the reboiler.i

The continuous distillation system is considered to be the -
simplest operationally. This system will operate with a near
constant heat load (due to fission product'decay) and liquid level
vhich will allow prediction and control of‘concentfafion-and‘ f '
temperature gradients in the liquid phése and will simplify‘instfu-
menting the system. Waste salt could be removed from~the?systémrat

.frequent intervals rather than continuously,

The semicontinuous system is considered to be slightly more

complex operationally than the continuous system; this complexity

 
 

 

35

arises primarily from the,transient“nature.ofhthisimode of operation
and the associated variation of.the‘fiSSion'product°heat load with
'time. Reduction of the liquid volume in the system near the end of
a cycle by batch operation will not complicate instrumenting the ”:
system if the heel volume is not less ‘than approximately 10% of the
initial still volume. - | | ﬁ

Operation of a batch system W1ll be significantly more compli- _
cated than either of the above systems for a number of reasons.
The cycle time for this system should be relatively short in order
to maintain an acceptably low salt 1nventory, hence the system must
be charged and discharged frequently. Control of temperature and 7
concentration gradients in the liquid will be complicated by the
continual variation of both liquid level and heat generation per
unit volume, Near the end of a cycle, the liquid volume in the ”i'
system will be approximately 0., 5% of the initial volume° accurate
-measurement of liquid level at’ this point may be difficult '

Conceivably, a continuous distillation system employing
~rectification would be as simple operationally as a- ‘continuous
‘system without rectification._ However, a system using rectification_
probably requires a greater extension of present technology than any
of the systems considered Problems 'such as vapor- liquid contact
are aggravated by the necessity for low pressure, high temperature
operation. The very high rare ‘earth removal efficiency achievable

with rectification is not required for MSBR processing.ii:}

5. PREVENTION OF BUILDUP OF 'NONVOLATILES AT A VAPORIZING SUREACE S 7 .
: BY LIQUID PHASE MIXING , o

During.vaporization of a multicomponent mixture, materials

 

less volatile than the bulk of the mixture tend to remain in the‘.v S |
liquid phase and are removed from the liquid surface by the processesjﬁqq

-of convection and molecular diffusion. As noted in Section 11, Low

pressure distillation will result in little if any convective mixing

in ‘the liquid and ‘an appreciable variation in the concentration of

materials of low volatility is possible if these materials are " '_

~ removed by diffusion only. The extent of surface buildup and the -

effectiveness of liquid phase mixing will be examined for a continuous |

still although the phenomena 1is common to all types of stills.-

, Consider a continuous still of the type shown in Fig., . Fuel
carrier salt. (LiF-Bng) containing fission product fluorides is
fed to the bottom of the system continuously. Most of the LiF-BeFp
fed to the system is vaporized and a salt stream containing most _77
of the nonvolatile materials is withdrawn continuously. The S
positive x direction will be taken as vertically upward and the
liquid withdrawal point and the liquid surface will be located at _
x = 0 and x = £, respectively. Assume that above the liquid
‘withdrawal point, molten LiF containing rare earth fluorides (REF)
flows upward at a constant velocity V. At the surface, -a fraction |
v/V of the LiF vaporizes and the remaining LiF is returned to the
bottom of the still, o

- earth fluorides allow a great deal of latitude in still

design and‘operetional mode. A single contact stage such
as a liquid pool is adequate and rectification is not

necessary.

The effectiveness\offa distillation system can be'seriously

decreased by the buildup of rare earth fluorides at-the

surface of the vaporizing liquid.

Liquid circulation can provide adequate liquid phase

- mixing and is an essential feature of an effective dis-

tillation gystem.

The following recommendations ‘are made-

jlo

Further consideration should be given to the use -of single-

stage,.continuous distillation for removal of rare.earth

- fluorides from=the fuel~stream of an MSBR. -

dThe ‘study of liquid phase temperature and concentration

'profiles ‘should be extended to stills having configurations

of interest for‘MSBR processing. ‘Methods :should be

gdevised for the calculation of velocity, temperature and

concentration in the liquidiphase of a three dimensional i,

-still'havingVa_distributed-heat source, The effect of

.'_rvariations;in heatigeneration rate ‘should be considered.

 
3. Removal of fission product decay heat from a distillation

42

system should be étudied. Heat removal_systems which

‘maintain the temperature within acceptable limits in the

event of failure of the primary cooling-systém-should;be?v,<i

 devised,

Factors which limit distillatibﬁ’raté1such~as opefétiné

- pressure, the presence of noncondensables, and entrainment

- should be examined.
