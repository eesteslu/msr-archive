Part 1. MSRE Design, Engineering Analysis,
and Component Development

 

 

1. MSRE Design, Procurement, and Construction

 

The design, procurement, and construction of the MSRE was 90% com-
plete on January 31, 196L.

Designs for the pump overflow tank and the reactor access nozzle were
completed. Drawings were nearly finished for the sampler-enricher system
and for the off-gas handling system. Work continued on design of the
MK-IT pump, a fuel pump with a larger expansion volume. Other mechanical
and process design work consisted mainly in revising drawings to incorpo-
rate the results of development work or to alleviate field problems.

Except for the addition of a safety relay cabinet and the removal of
one nuclear panel, the layout of the instrumentation and controls system
remains the same as reported previously.

Instrument applications diagrams, tabulations, and design drawings
were revised to incorporate recent changes in, and additions to, the
instrumentation and controls system.

Block diagrams for the control system are now complete except for
those for the sampler-enricher system and the fuel processing systen.
Preparation of engineering elementary schematic diagrams is nearing com-
pletion. The design of interconnection wiring for the control and safety
circuits is approximately 50% complete.

Designs of 46 of 53 panel board sections presently required are com-
plete. The remaining 7 are partially complete.

Some of the drawings are still incomplete for the installation of
field instruments.

Design of the process radiation monitoring system is complete, and
that of the personnel radiation monitoring system is 70% complete.

An arc-spectrograph-type beryllium analyzer will be installed at the
MSRE as part of a beryllium monitoring system. Design of this system was

begun.
The graphite core for the reactor was assembled. The graphite sup-
port flange in the reactor vessel was modified because of cracks where

the flange was welded to the vessel wall.

Fabrication and testing were completed on the fuel pump bowl and its
flexible mount. The lubricating-oil packages for the pumps were completed.

1ii
iv

The salt-to-air radiator and all freeze flanges were finished.

Manufacture of the heater control panels was completed, and progress
was made at the vendor's plant in the fabrication of the removable heater
insulation units for the components and piping in the reactor and drain
tank cells.

The portable maintenance shield was completed as well as some other
remote maintenance equipment.

The 5-in. coolant piping, the fuel pump auxiliary piping, and the
fuel pump support were installed in the reactor cell. Other auxiliary
piping in this cell is 90% complete. The overflow tank was assenmbled on
the pump.

The radiator, the 5-in. coolant piping, and the circulating pump
were installed in the coolant cell.

The auxiliary diesel generators were reconditioned and checked.

Leak testing of installed systems is in progress.

The cost plus fixed fee contractor made scheduled progress in the
installation of both electrical and piping systems outside the reactor,
coolant, and drain tank cells.

Progress was made in the fabrication of instrument panels and the
installation of thermocouples, electrical wiring, and valves associated

with the instrumentation systems.

A contract was awarded for a computer data-handling system. Delivery
is scheduled for October 196k,

Procurement of process and nuclear instruments was continued. Addi-
tional components required by revisions and additions to the system were

requisitioned.

2. Component Development

 

The MSRE primary heat exchanger was operated with up to 1300 gpm of
water flowing through the shell. The tubes were found to vibrate exces-
sively at 900 gpm and above. It was concluded that the clearances between
the tubes and the baffle plates were too great and that the tubes would
require more rigid support.

Failure of a welded connection in a nickel lead wire shut down the
prototype drain tank heater test for repairs. Similar welds for reactor
heaters are being reexamined.

A production model of the removable heater and insulation for 5-in.
pipe was received from the vendor and testing was started. Comparison of
data taken at the beginning of the tests indicates that the production
unit performs slightly better than the prototype.
Two prototype cooling bayonets, constructed of INOR-8, were operated
through 180 rapid-quench cycles (1350 to 212°F), a total of 3400 hr.
Both tubes were free of cracks, but one was badly warped, probably be-
cause the method of operation produced more temperature cycles in that
tube. Testing was continued.

A Treeze valve, designed for operation where the valve must open on
a power failure, was tested and found satisfactory. The average melt
time was 10 min, and the average freeze time was 20 min.

Testing of a prototype of the reactor drain valve was started, and
preliminary indications were that the freeze time would be 20 to 25 min.
The melt times averaged 5-1/2 min with power and 13 min under a simulated
power failure. Testing was continued to determine whether the freeze
time can be reduced.

The prototype control-rod-drive unit was operated under MSRE condi-
tions through a total of 40,000 full-stroke cycles. Minor modifications
were made to strengthen the rib cage, to improve alignment, and to in-
crease the shock-absorber stroke. Excessive wear on an aluminum-bronze
worm wheel in the gear reduction unit caused the drive to require repair
after l7,h58 cycles. Other materials are being considered for the worm
wheel and will be tested. Measurements on a new, flexible control rod
indicated that 95% of the permanent elongation occurred during the first
week of operation and that prerunning new rods at temperature would allow
them to stretch to the final operating length. Operation of a dynamic
brake to reduce rod overtravel and of the synchro system for remote posi-
tion indication were both satisfactory. The magnetic-clutch release time
was measured as less than 25 msec, and the acceleration of the falling
rod was 1% ft/sec®. These values are satisfactory.

The oxygen-removal unit was operated at 1160°F with a helium flow of
10 liters/min (STP) and an inlet oxygen concentration of 225 ppm until
the concentration of oxygen at the outlet exceeded 0.1 ppm. This period
was the equivalent of about one year of operation under the MSRE require-
ments, and approximately 58% of the titanium bed was consumed. A black
deposit, found by others using similar equipment, was identified as a
carbonaceous material originating from an organic solvent used in clean-
ing the components.

The Engineering Test Loop (ETL) was operated for L4OO hr for testing
the sampler-enricher mockup and for following the inventory of uranium in
the l1oop. A comparison of the uranium concentration by chemical analysis
with the calculated uranium concentration indicated a discrepancy of 9%.
Efforts to resolve the discrepancy are continuing.

Thirty-five salt samples were removed, and eleven capsules of enrich-
ing salt were added with the sampler-enricher mockup. The sample capsule
was modified to reduce the tendency to bind and to strengthen the connect-
ors. A 6-5/8-in.—long enriching capsule was chosen which can contain up
to 92 g of uranium. The manipulator for transporting the capsule within
the sampler and the valves used in isolating the areas performed adequately.
vi

Design of the sampler-enricher for the reactor is 90% complete.

Preparations were started for maintenance demonstrations, using some
of the reactor components, during the erection and precritical periods.
The stereo television system was discarded in favor of g system using two
cameras set 90° apart. The portable maintenance shield was recelved, and
minor modifications were made. Several new tools were tested and adopted.

Detalled procedures for remote maintenance are approximately 50%
complete.

Fabrication and tests were completed for the lubrication stands that
will be used with the fuel- and coolant-salt pumps and for the supports
that will be used to mount the fuel-salt pump. These items were delivered
to the MSRE. Manufacture and electrical tests were completed for the
first motor which will be used to drive the fuel pump. The hydraulic per-
formance data for the prototype fuel pump were analyzed, and impeller
diameters of 11-1/12 in. for the fuel-salt pump and 10-21/64 in. for the
coolant-salt pump were selected. Assembly of the rotary elements for the
fuel- and coolant-salt pumps was started. Preliminary tests made with
the water mockup of the MK-IT pump tank indicated the presence of many
very small bubbles in the pump tank liquid; modifications to reduce this
ingassing are being studied. The emphasis on completing hardware for the
MSRE has delayed the program to measure the concentration of helium en-
trained in the circulating salt in the prototype fuel pump test.

Problems encountered in the design of high-temperature seals for the
NeK-filled differential-pressure transmitters were resolved. Three trans-
mitters were fabricated and tested with satisfactory results.

Thermocouple testing was continued. Observed drift of thermocouples
fabricated from MSRE stock (of the order of +1.5 to +2.5°F) indicates
that the thermocouple material procured for the MSRE was inadequately
annealed after fabrication. The thermocouples installed on the ETL and
the prototype pump test loop continue to perform satisfactorily. Devel-
mental tests indicate that temperatures in the bayonet tubes of the MIRE
drain tank can be measured with an accuracy of 3°F if g special assembly
designed for this purpose is used.

Radiation-damage tests are being performed on the thermocouple lead-
wire and disconnect assemblies. No obJjectionable insulation breakdown has
been noted to date; however, outgassing of materials in & hermetically
sealed multiconductor thermocouple cable was noted.

A device was developed which permits the insertion of a test signal
into the input of the reactor temperature safety instrument channels with-
out disconnecting wiring and which is compatible with the requirements for
physical isolation of redundant safety channels.

Some minor revisions were made on the Electra Systems switches to
improve temperature control of the freeze valves.
vii

A signal-marking device was developed for use in providing positive
identification of temperature signals on the MSRE temperature scanner.

One of the two bubbler level systems on the MSRE pump test facility
continues to perform satisfactorily; the other is plugged with salt and
has been abandoned.

Satisfactory performance of the three float-type molten-salt level
transmitters under test continues. Development of a similar transmitter
for the MK-II replacement pump is in progress.

Revision to the design, fabrication, and preinstallation testing of
the MSRE drain tank level probes was completed. Specifications were pre-
pared, and procurement was initiated for the alarm transducers that will
be used with these probes.

A system was developed for obtaining a positive indication of the
position of MSRE control rods.

A device was developed, for use with Foxboro ECI pressure transmitters,
that will provide a secondary containment barrier that is required when

the transmitters are connected to the reactor primary system.

5. MSRE Reactor Analysis

 

Calculations were made to predict the neutron fluxes in the thermal
shield and the nuclear instrument shaft with a neutron source in the
source tube and varying degrees of multiplication in the core. Results
indicate considerable scattering of source neutrons to the detectors, but
the ability to monitor subcritical multiplication is not seriously
impaired.

Criticality in the drain tanks or storage tank requires abnormal con-
centration of the uranium around the center of the tank. Concentration
factors required for criticality were calculated and appear to be outside
the range of possibility.

If 1t becomes necessary to cool down the core with fuel salt in it,
criticality could be prevented (down to room temperature) by the addltlon
of less than 0.26 kg of Li® to the salt before it freezes.

The effects of revised cross sections and the number of neutron
energy groups on the calculated nuclear properties of the MSRE are being
studied.

The prompt temperature coefficient in a large, graphite-moderated,
molten-salt converter reactor may be either positive or negative, depend-
ing on the composition of the core. The criteria which determine the
sign were explored, and it appears that a negative coefficient can be
obtained with practically no restriction on the design.

Part 2. Materials Studies

 

L. Metallurgy

 

Mechanical properties were determined for specimens from heats of
INOR-8 used in the MSRE to evaluate the effects of large-scale produc-
tion. ©Stress rupture strengths of these heats were found to be higher
than those of heats used to establish MSRE design. Thermal fatigue be-
havior of INOR-8 was evaluated and found to follow s Coffin-type relation.

Postirradiation tensile properties were measured for INOR-8 as s
function of deformation temperature and at several strain rates. No sig-
nificant effect on yield stress was observed; however, irradiation reduced
the ultimate stress and ductility of INOR-8 at temperatures of 600°C and
above. The effect of irradiation was found to increase with decreasing
strain rate.

Evaluation of the MSRE graphite, grade CGB, was continued. The bulk
density ranged from 1.83 to 1.87 g/cm?, with an average value of 1.96
g/cm®. Data on a typical bar indicated that more than 6% of the acces-
sible pores had entrance diameters smaller than 0.2 . Theoretically, if
there were no cracks in the graphite, a pressure of 600 psia would be
required to force the nonwetting molten fuel salt into 0.5% of the bulk
volume of the graphite, the design limit for the MSRE. There was some
variation in the microstructure of the graphite from bar to bar, but al-
most all volds were appreciably reduced in size by impregnations. Radio-
graphic examination of typical bars for the retainer ring and lattice bars
of the MSRE showed that these had good structural integrity, with only a
few small tight cracks in some of the bars. Thermal conductivity was
measured for grade CGB graphite using radial heat flow apparatus. Con-
ductivity data are reported for this graphite in a direction perpendicular
to the axis of extrusion.

Grade CGB graphite was irradiated at various temperatures, and post-
irradiation measurements were made to obtain comparative data on effects
of irradiation on dimensional stability, electrical resistance, modulus
of elasticity, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity.

A total of 160 control rod elements containing gadolinium oxide -
aluminum oxide bushings made with prereacted powders were manufactured

for the MSRE. The fabrication procedure for these elements is described.

>. Radiation Chemistry of the MSRE System

 

Metallographic examination of INOR-8 specimens irradiated in contact
with graphite and fuel salt in experiment ORNL-MTR-47-3 showed heavy car-
burization of the outer surfaces and milder carburization of the interior
metal. The degree of carburization was rather higher than expected for
the temperature of the exposure. The simultaneously exposed molybdenum
specimens showed carburization in the absence of fluorine generation and
severe corrosion in its presence. Of four pyrolytic-carbon specimens
exposed, one showed slight metallographic evidence of dama.ge .
ix

The small amounts (0.1%) of uranium in the graphite cores of the
L7-4 capsules were found by autoradiography and x-radiography to be con-
centrated in a peripheral layer about 2 mils thick. The deposition of
uranium may have been a consequence of fuel radiolysis during reactor
shutdowns in the course of the in-pile exposure. This conjecture will
be tested in the next in-pile experiment, which provides for suppressing
radiolysis of the fuel during shutdowns.

Induction periods and fluorine yields showed large variations during
the seven reactor shutdowns in the course of the 47-5 in-pile exposure,
again indicating the controlling influence of subtle crystallization vari-
ables on the rate of radiolysis of solid fuel.

The analyses of cover gases from the sealed capsules in experiment
47-5 indicated extensive radiolysis, producing large quantities of Fz2 and
CF,, in the capsule containing only a small amount of graphite. Corre-
spondingly, the graphite wafer was badly eroded and cracked. Less fuel
radiolysis and graphite damage was observed in the similarly exposed cap-
sule in which the fuel was contained in a large graphite crucible. The
unique observation of no F, nor CF, in the cover gas was made in two seal-
ed capsules which contained only fuel-impregnated AGOT graphite rods.

Construction of the L47-6 in-pile assembly is under way. This experi-
ment 1s directed toward more sensitive detection of CF, generation during
irradiation, the measurement of CF; radiolysis at MSRE temperatures, and
the observation of uranium deposition under conditions where fuel radi-
olysis is suppressed.

An INOR-8 capsule containing MSRE salt was exposed to gamma radiation
from a Co®? source for ~7400 hr. The salt was irradiated at temperatures
ranging from 36 to 150°C and was thus in the solid state throughout the
entire test period. The salt received a calculated dose rate of 0.45 x 10°
ev hr'tg™l. After an induction period of about 600 hr, fluorine gas was
generated at rates (G values) varying between 0.03 to 0.07 molecule of
fluorine per 100 ev absorbed at temperatures up to 110°C. At a tempera-
ture of 150°C, any fluorine gas which had been generated was recombined.
At 130°C, recombination rates roughly equaled generation rates. No evi-
dence was obtained of any appreciable reaction of the Fs gas with the
graphnite to generate CF,;. The experiment qualitatively confirmed previous
evidence that fluorine gas is generated in solid salt below ~100°C and
that fluorine is recombined with the salt at a higher temperature.

Experiments to investigate fluorine evolution from solid MoRE-type
fuel salt under fast electron bombardment have been continued. Completed
additional experiments yield values of Gp, as a function of dose up to a
total dose of about 1.6 x 10+8 Mev per gram of salt. The dose rate em-
ployed in additional experiments was less than that employed previously
by about a factor of 2. The GF2 values were significantly greater at the
lower dose rate. The fluorine-evolution rate changed with increasing dose
and passed through maxima. In general, the results appear consistent with
the kinetic plcture of salt radiolysis previously reported. Similar ex-
periments with solid LiF showed that fluorine was not evolved as a result
of bombardment but was taken up in small amounts.

0
The study of x-ray radiolysis of MSRE fuel salt and its components
showed substantial fluorine evolution from Thi'y , 6LiF-BeF2-ZrF4, and a
fine-particle fraction of MSRE-type fuel salt. Less fluorine was evolved
from a coarse-particle fraction of the same fuel salt. No fluorine was
found upon irradiation of either LiF or ZrF, alone.

6. Chemistry

Investigations of high-temperature phase equilibria were continued
for systems having potential use in molten-salt-reactor technology. Much
of the MSRE solvent system phase diagram LiF-BeF,-ZrF,; was described in
detail. The crystallization behavior of MSRE fuel was studied in more
detall to reveal the sequence of events when the fuel is cooled slowly.

The solubility of uranium trifluoride in a reduced MSRE fuel mixture
was determined over a temperature range of 550 to 800°C and found to be
considerably lower than that predicted by analogy with the information
for rare-earth and plutonium trifluorides. In anticipation of a study of
the stability of uranium trifluoride in molten fluoride solvents, measure-
ments were made of the equilibrium quotients for the reaction UFs + 1/2Hs =
UF3 + HF in the temperature range 670 to 810°C. The difference in the free
energies of formation between UF3 and UF, was found to be 80 + 1 kcal/mole
at 1000°K, within the range of widely divergent values reported in the
literature.

A determination of the crystal structure of 6LiF-BeF,.ZrF, established
the existence of separate BeF,*~ and ZrFg*~ ions in this solid phase.

An investigation of the system KC1-UCl3 was initiated as part of an
effort to evaluate molten chlorides as fast reactor fuels., Potentially
useful concentrations of thorium (up to 2400 g/liter) for static molten
blankets for fast-breeder reactors were discovered in the system NaK-KF'-
Th¥s4. This concentration is provided by the lowest melting eutectic
(562°C) whose composition is NaF-KF-ThF,(68-6-26 mole %). Molten lead,
suggested as an internal heat transfer agent for molten-salt systems via
direct contact with the molten salt, was found to give good phase separa -
tion after being dispersed in molten chlorides or molten fluorides, even
in the presence of solid oxides.,

Moisture removal from specimens of MSRE graphite has been tested
under conditions simulating those expected prior to MSRE startup. Very
little water was released from the graphite; exposure to moist environments
did not cause any water adsorption, and even prior to immersion of the
specimen in liquid water was ultimately followed by the release of only &
very small amount of chemisorbed water. The results of the tests indicate
that water contamination from the MSRE graphite will not be serious.

Studies of the interfacial behavior of fluorides with graphite and
metals led to the discovery of a linear relation between the surface ten-
sion of the salt (at its melting point) and the cosine of the contact
angle between the salt and the surface. Values of surface tension of 190
and 210 dynes/cm for graphite and metals, respectively, marked the change
from wetting to nonwetting behavior.
xi

The equilibrium behavior of the reaction of HF and H, O with molten
2L1iF-BeF2 containing oxides was examined. The equilibration in the pres-
ence of hydrogen as a carrier gas with molten salts was found to be rapid
and conveniently measurable. The results, together with thermodynamic
information in the literature, were combined to give quantitative expres-
sions relating the oxide ion concentration in the melt to the partial
pressures of water and HF in the gas phase at 600°C. Such relations were
extended to provide information concerning the purification process for
the removal of oxide ion from the MSRE fuel solvent. The reduction of
sulfate to sulfide with beryllium metal and the removal of H,S by treat-
ment of molten salts with HF were studied; controlled removal of sulfur
by HF-Hy sparging may be achieved without nickel sulfide formation if the
HpoS to Hp ratio is held below a critical value, known as a function of
temperature.

Raw materials have been purchased, and improvements to the fluoride
processing facility have been made preparatory to the production of the
coolant, flush, and fuel salt mixtures for operation of the MSRE. As s
continuing effort for process development, studies of impurity-removal
rates and various process control methods have been made. The use of
stronger reducing agents for the removal of structural-metal cations
from fluoride mixtures is being investigated, and both beryllium metal
and zirconium metal appear promising for this application. The densifi-
cation of Li7F by a combination of heating and HF treatment was confirmed
in intermediate-scale apparatus, and preparations were made to apply this
treatment to the entire raw-material supply of Li’F.

Electroanalytical methods are being evaluated for possible applica-
tion to the MSRE. The cell assembly consists of a graphite cell in which
a pyrolytic-graphite indicating electrode and two platinum electrodes are
immersed. Current-voltage curves of the MSRE fuel solvent were obtained,
the cathodic limit of the melt being —1.2 v and no anodic limits to +3.0 v.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) and fluorescence absorption measure-
ments were studied to determine their feasibility for the determination
of oxidation states of uranium in the MSRE fuel. At 77°K, an ESR signal
attributable to trivalent uranium was observed. The potential limit of
detection of U(III) appears to be about 250 ppm.

Development was continued on methods for determining chromium, molyb-
denum, uranium, and oxide in the MSRE fuel. catisfactory limits of pre-
cision were established for chromium, molybdenum, and uranium under simu-
lated hot-cell conditions.

Redesign and fabrication of equipment such as sampler, mixer, and
transfer device have been completed. The final testing of this equipment
1s in progress, and final evaluation of all methods is being conducted in
the hot-cell mockup.

INTRODUCTTION

 

The Molten-5alt Reactor Program is concerned with research and de-
velopment for nuclear reactors that use mobile fuels, which are solutions
of fissile and fertile materials 1n suitable carrier salts. The program
is an outgrowth of the ANP efforts to make a molten-salt reactor power
plant for aircraft and is extending the technology originated there to
the development of reactors for producing low-cost power for civilian
uses.

The major goal of the program is to develop a thermal breeder reac-
tor. TFuel for this type of reactor would be UR33F, or U235Fg dissolved
in a salt of composition near 2LiF-BelFp. The blanket would be ThFs dis-
solved in a carrier of similar composition. The technology being devel-
oped for the breeder is applicable to, and could be exploited sooner in,
advanced converter reactors or in burners of fissionable uranium and plu-
tonium that also use fluoride fuels. Solutions of UCls and PuCl3 in
mixtures of NaCl and KCl offer attractive possibilities for mobile fuels
for fast-breeder reactors. The fast reactors are of interest too but are
not a significant part of the program.

Our major effort is being applied to the development, construction,
and operation of a Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. The purpose of this
Experiment is to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used
in the thermal breeder and the converter reactors and to obtain several
years of experience with the operation and maintenance of a small molten-
salt power reactor. A successiul experiment will demonstrate on a small
scale the attractive features and the technical feasibility of these sys-
tems for large civilian power reactors. The MSRE will operate at 1200°F
and atmospheric pressure and will generate 10 Mw of heat. Initially, the
fuel will contain 0.9 mole % UF4, 5 mole % ZrF4, 29.1 mole % BeF,, and
65 mole % LiF, and the uranium will contain about %0% U235, The melting
point will be 8L4LO°F. In later operation, highly enriched uranium will be
used in lower concentration, and a fuel containing ThF, will also be test-
ed. In each case the composition of the solvent can be adjusted to retain
about the same liquidus temperature.

The fuel will circulate through a reactor vessel and an external pump
and heat exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of INOR-8,*%
a new nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to cor-
rosion by molten flucrides and with high strength at high temperature.
The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars that are
in direct contact with the fuel. The graphite is a new material® of high
density and small pore size. The fuel salt does not wet the graphite and
therefore should not enter the pores, even at pressures well sbove the
operating pressure.

 

*¥S0ld commercially as Hastelloy N and Inco No. 806.

*Grade CGB, produced by the Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide
Corporation.
Heat produced in the reactor will be transferred to a coolant fuel
in the heat exchanger, and the coolant salt will be pumped through a
radiator to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. A small faclility i1s
being installed in the MSRE building for occasionally processing the fuel
by treatment with gaseous HF and F,.

Design of the MSRE was begun early in the summer of 1960. Orders
for special materials were placed in the spring of 1961. Major modifi-
cations to Building 750% at ORNL, in which the reactor is being installed,
were started in the fall of 1961 and were completed by January 1963.

Fabrication of the reactor equipment began early in 1962. Some dif-
ficulties were experienced in obtaining materials and in making and in-
stalling the equipment, but we expect to complete essential installations
and to begin prenuclear testing in the summer of 1964, In the absence of
serious difficulties, the critical experiments will begin early in 1965,
and they will be followed by several months of operation at intermediate
levels in raising the reactor to full power.

Because the MSRE is of a new and advanced type, substantial research
and development effort is provided in support of the design and construc-
tion. Included are engineering development and testing of reactor com-
ponents and systems, metallurgical development of materials, and studies
of the chemistry of the salts and their compatibility with graphite and
metals both in and out of pile. Work is also being done on methods for
purifying the fuel salts and in preparing purified mixtures for the reac-
tor and for the research and development studies.

This report is one of a series of periodic reports in which we de-
scribe briefly the progress of the program. Previous reports in the
series are listed below.

Part 1. MSRE DESIGN, ENGINEERING ANALYSIS AND
COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT
1. MSRE DESIGN, PROCUREMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION

The design, procurement, and construction of the MSRE was 90% com-
plete on January 31, 196L.

otatus of Design

 

Mechanical and Process Design

 

Designs of an overflow tank for the fuel pump and a strainer for the
fuel outlet from the reactor vessel were described in the previous report;l
those designs were finished.

Drawings of equipment for sampling and enriching the fuel salt are
nearing completion. This design incorporates results of recent devel-
opment work on the mockup of the sampling and enriching system in the
Engineering Test ILoop.

The redesign of the off-gas-system process piping between the coolant
cell and the charcoal beds outside the building is nearing completion.
The major revisions are being made to change from direct to semiremote
maintenance of valves PCV-522 and HCV-533 in the off-gas line. These
valves are located in the instrument and valve pit in the venthouse.
The PCV-522 valve controls pressure in the pump-bowl gas space, and the
HCV-533 1s a shutoff wvalve used to vent gas to the auxiliary charcoal
bed during filling operations. The change avoids excessive maintenance
Time due to high radioactivity in the off-gas line.

Preliminary design work was completed on the system for handling
radiocactive gas from the graphite-sampling operation. Control of the
atmosphere in the graphite-sample work tube must be maintained such that
(l) the reactor atmosphere and the graphite sample are protected from
undesirable contaminants, and (2) release of activity is within accept-
able 1imits. The system provides for continuous flow of about 20 cfm of
gas to and from the work tube, with the effluent gas passing through an
absolute filter and then to the building vent header and off-gas stack.
A blower located downstream of the absolute filter serves to maintain a
slight negative pressure in the work tube.

Other design work consists in modifying existing drawings to incor-
porate recent results of development work and to ease remote maintenance,
fabrication, and construction problems.

Work was continued on the design of the MK-II fuel pump with the
larger expansion volume for fuel. The temperature distributions in the
pump bowl were calculated for operation with air cooling of the top of
the bowl with and without nuclear heating. Estimates are being made of
the thermal stresses that result from those temperature distributions.
Instrumentation and Controls Design

 

oystem Layout. The layout of the instrumentation and controls
system remains essentially the same as described in the previous re-
port.= The number of nuclear panels was reduced from six to five, and
one safety relay cabinet was added in the auxiliary control room. Some
instruments on the auxiliary control panel were relocated to satisfy
requirements for separation of safety- and control-grade instrumentation.
With the exception of one pump speed monitor, all panel-mounted instru-
ments of safety grade are now located on two panel sections in the
auxiliary control room. Instruments required for testing the system
for blocking of the reactor cell penetrations will be consolidated on =
panel in the electric service area.

 

Drawings showing location and installation of process radiation
monitors, process safety transmitters, and routing of conduit for these
instruments were completed and approved.

Instrument Application Diagrams and Tabulations. Instrument appli-
cation diagrams, tabulations, and design drawings were revised to incor-
porate recent changes in the design of the instrumentation and controls
system. The major changes were due to the addition of the overflow tank
on the fuel pump and of instrumentation required by the safety and con-
trol circuits.

 

A preliminary "Nuclear Instrument Application Diagram" was completed,
but it is presently being reviewed and revised.

Instrument application tabulations were extensively revised, updated,
and reissued.

Control-Circuit Design. Block diagrams describing criteria for
operation of the control rods, radiator doors, and the reactor process
and nuclear control and safety systems were finished and approved.

Block diagrams for all reactor auxiliary system control circuits, except
The sampler-enricher and the fuel processing systems, are also complete.

 

Preparation of engineering elementary schematic diagrams for the
reactor process and nuclear control and safety circuits is nearing com-
pletion. kEngineering elementary diagrams for all auxiliary equipment
control are complete and approved except for the fuel processing sys-
tem. Although the sampler-enricher control-circuit diagrams are com-
plete and approved, some revisions may be necessary to obtain the inde-
pendence and separation of redundant circuits required to meet safety
criteria. The schematic diagrams of the freeze valves, previously re-
ported as complete and approved, were revised to accommodate changes
resulting from recent valve development and to include cross interlocks
with other portions of the reactor control system.

A single-line instrument power-distribution diagram was completed
and issued for comment. Based on this drawing, a tabulation of loads
indicates that the present 25-kw reliable power source lacks sufficient
capacity to supply all requirements. Requirements for reliable power are
presently being reviewed to determine whether additional capacity must be
installed.

The design of interconnection wiring for the control and safety
cilrcults is approximately 50% complete. Requirements for the safety
and control relay cabinets were determined. TLayout and wiring drawings
for these cabinets were completed, and relays and necessary hardware are
being purchased.

Requirements for "jumpers' in the control circuits have been re-
viewed, and preliminary criteria have been established for the design of
this portion of the control circuitry.

Requirements for conduits and wireways for the control and safety
circuits are now known, and drawings are being revised to include all
the requirements.

Control Panels and Cabinet Design. Designs of 46 of the 53 panel
board sections presently required are complete. The remaining 7 are
partially complete.

 

During this report period, the design of one main board panel, two
process radiation alarm panels, and two auxiliary panels containing
safety instrumentation were completed and approved. The design of the
safety relay cabinet was also approved. The layout of the control con-
sole was approved, and the design is continuing.

Five main board panels and three transmitter board panels were re-
vised because of changes to the helium supply system for the fuel pump.
Revisions, required by minor system changes, to auxiliary panels 1 to 4
were completed and approved. The drawings for the fuel pump level
transmitter panel were revised to accommodate the new equipment for the
overflow tank. The design of the indicator lamp flasher panel chassis
for use in the freeze valve circuits was also approved.

Instrument Interconnection and Field Installation Design. Revisions
were made to the annunciator (ECI, Foxboro) and pneumatic schematic dia-
grams to satisfy the requirements of additions of safety instrumentation
and changes in control instrumentation design.

Four Venturi flow elements were made and calibrated for the salt-
circulation pump lubricating-oil system. Designs for the drain tank
level probes and valve position-indicator disconnects were completed and
approved. Detail drawings were also approved for installation of the
high-temperature differential-pressure heads on the coolant-salt
Venturi.

All thermocouple interconnection wiring diagrams, including terminal
box details, have been approved; however, continued revision of these
drawings 1is being required by changes in box heater and process design
and by additional requirements for thermocouples.

Procedures for sealing thermocouple cables in junction boxes out-
side the reactor and drain tank cells were completed. Assistance was
provided in training and qualifying electricians to perform this work.

Design of the installation of the float type of level element for
the coolant pump was completed and approved.

Process and Personnel Radiation Monitoring. The criteria for the
arrangement of the personnel monitors in the building evacuation system
were established, and 70% of the design of the system was completed.
A1l the primary instruments have been received. The fabrication of the
building evacuation alarm circuitry has been delayed by lack of funds
until after July 1, 196k,

 

Except for possible additional requirements in the fuel processing
system, the process monitoring system design is complete.

Beryllium Monitoring. A beryllium analyzer of the arc spectrograph
type will be installed at the MSRE as part of a system for detecting the
release of beryllium from the coolant system.” The arc spectrograph,
which is on hand at ORNL, will be used for continuous monitoring of the
beryllium content of the air passing through the radiator and up the
stack. The output of the arc spectrograph will be recorded in the
auxiliary control room. Design of this installation was started.

 

Data System. Due to delays in arranging the procurement details,
the final selection and AEC approval of a data logging and computing
system was delayed several months. AEC approval was obtained in October,
and the contract was signed in December. The contract is for a TRW-3L0O
computer data-handling system in essential accordance with the original
proposal and specifications. »>  The contract is for a one-year lease,
with an option to purchase at the end of the year. Delivery is sched-
uled for October 1, 196L4,

 

The outline and administrative procedures for the data-system
project have been established with the seller (Bunker-Ramo Corporation. )
The computer programming will be a Joint effort between Bunker-Ramo
Corporation and ORNL, with ORNL supplying three men full time for pro-
gramming, procurement, and installation. Preliminary work in preparation
for the programming is under way, with the final input signal tabulation
and calculation details being completed. A programming course is
scheduled to be given in Ios Angeles for four weeks, beginning in March.

Details for the system installation, including equipment layout
in the data room and power and air-conditioning requirements, are
being determined.
otatus of Fabrication of Major Reactor Components

 

Reactor Vessel and Control Rod Thimble Assembly

 

All the graphite for the reactor core has been received from the
vendor and assembled on the support grid in the Y-12 machine shop
(Fig. 1.1).

Machining and cleaning of the reactor vessel were completed in time
to receive the graphite assembly when final inspection with dye penetrant
revealed many cracks in the welds that Jjoined the graphite support flange
to the inner wall of the vessel. (The graphite is contained in an open
can that is about 55 in. in diameter and 66 in. long. A flange on the
outside of that can near the top was to rest on, and be bolted to, the
flange on the inside of the reactor vessel to support the graphite.) The
support flange was made by welding a continuous ring to the inner wall
of the reactor vessel with full penetration welds as shown in Fig. 1.2.
The welds were inspected with dye penetrant as they were made, and they
contained no cracks when they were finished. However, the design is
one in which the welds are highly stressed, and we believe that they
cracked during heat treatment to relieve stresses or during subsequent
storage.

The problem 1s being solved by replacing the ring with brackets of
the design shown in Fig. 1.3. Much less welding is required, stresses
introduced during fabrication are much lower, and the applied stresses
in the brackets and the welds are well below the permitted design
stresses when they are supporting the full load of the graphite.

The ring and a small amount of the vessel wall were machined to
remove the cracks. The wall thickness was restored by depositing weld
metal. The inner wall was machined to a smooth surface, and the brackets
were welded in place. The vessel will be stress relieved, machined to
final dimensions, cleaned, and reinspected before the graphite is
installed.

Work is progressing satisfactorily on the reactor access nozzle
assembly that contains the control rod thimbles and the strainer for
fluid leaving the reactor. Fabrication of the control-rod-drive supports
18 also in progress.

Fuel and Coolant Pumps

 

The fuel pump bowl, overflow tank, and cooling shroud were completed.
Testing and some modification of the pump support--which permits the pump
to move to relieve stresses in the piping as the system heats and cools--
were completed. Testing and minor modifications to the lubricating-oil
stands for both pumps were finished. The float-type liquid-level indi-
cator was completed for the coolant pump.

Major Procurement

 

calt Piping and Component Heating Eguipment

Twelve heater control panels, the reactor heaters, and part of the
drain tank removable heaters were completed and delivered.

The Mirror Insulation Company is designing and fabricating remotely
replaceable heater and insulation units for the salt piping and heat ex-
changer in the reactor and drain tank cells. Fabricaticn of the units for
the reactor cell is nearing completion. One unit has been received and
is being tested and evaluated.

Remote Maintenance Eguipment

The large, portable, sliding shield for doing semiremote maintenance
has been fabricated and delivered (see Fig. 2.7). Pipe alignment
brackets for use in maintaining freeze flanges and some of the equipment
for removing graphite samples from the reactor have been made.

Reactor Auxiliary Systems

 

A surge tank for purified helium and two oxygen-removal units for
the cover-gas system were fabricated. Iead shielding for line 524, the
off-gas line from the pump bowl, was completed.

Neutron Instrument Tube

 

The neutron instrument tube extension and the neutron tube harp
assembly were completed. Iead shields were finished for the six radi-
ation detectors for process lines.

Instrumentation

 

Specifications were written, and orders were placed for additional
instrumentation made necessary by revisions To the control systems and
the completion of the design of the safety system. Most of these com-
ponents have been delivered, and the others should arrive soon.

The reactor operator's console was ordered, and delivery is scheduled
for March 196L. Most of the console instruments have been specified and
purchased, and some are on hand. Delivery of the others is expected
within the next two months.

Five weld-sealed helium control valves had to be returned to the
vendor for reworking. They have been received and are now satisfactory.

The multiconductor signal cable (6000 ft ) for interconnecting the
Foxboro ECI instruments was also received.
15

Two important special items were received from their vendors: the
NaK-filled differential-pressure transmitters for use in coolant-salt
flow measurements, and the matrix-type helium flow elements. Acceptance
tests on the helium flow elements have been completed.

An order for 33 weld-sealed solenoid valves was placed. Vendor
fabrication drawings for these valves were recelved and approved.

A1l equipment for the process radiatilon monitoring system 1s either
on hand or on order. All primary instruments for the personnel radiation
monitoring system are on hand. A portion of the nuclear instruments are
on hand or ordered. The specification and procurement of the remainder
of the nuclear instrument components is under way.

The special alarm discriminators will be fabricated by a vendor
instead of by ORNL shops, as previously reported. The contract for
fabrication of these items has been awarded, and delivery is expected
in March 1964. A contract was also awarded to a vendor for fabrication
of ten special expansion chamber assemblies.

Orders were placed for purchase of relays, terminal strips, timers,
and additional solenoid valves required for construction of the control
and safety relay cabinet and completion of the electrical safety and
control systems. Part of this equipment has been received. Delivery
of the remainder is expected 1n the next two months.

Additional quantities of thermocouple extension wire, multiconductor

thermocouple cable, disconnect boxes, and multipin header seals were
purchased to satisfy the expanded requirements of The thermocouple system.

Status of Construction

 

Reactor Cell

 

The auxiliary piping was installed on the housing for the rotary
element of the fuel pump, and the housing was shipped to Bldg. 9201-3
for further test.

The fuel pump bowl, overflow tank, and piping were assembled on the
jig. The pump support is being installed in the cell.

The status of the installation in the reactor cell is shown in
Fig. 1.5.

2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

Primary Heat Exchanger

 

Difficulties with excessive vibration in heat exchangers at the
Enrico Fermi Atomic Power FPlant and the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility
prompted a review of the MSRE heat exchanger design. This review, to-
gether with some tests on a single tube mockup, indicated that vibra-
tions could be a problem and that flow tests should be conducted with
the exchanger.

The primary heat exchanger was operated with water flowing through
the shell at up to 1300 gpm to determine if the high inlet velocity
(19.3 fps) impinging on the tubes would produce excessive vibration.
The test was conducted by connecting the heat exchanger to a new 12-in.
water main supplied from a new reservolr and by diverting the discharge
to ground drainage.

At a flow of about 900 gpm, noises were heard coming from the heat
exchanger. Initially, they were mild and intermittent but became louder
and continuous as the flow rate was increased to 1300 gpm, where the
test was terminated to prevent damage to the tubes. The noise level was
not noticeably decreased when a 55-psi back pressure was applied — so
cavitation was not a factor — or when the tubes were filled with water.
The nolse came from the entire heat exchanger and was not limited to any
specific region. The sound was almost identical to that produced by a
single vibrating tube mounted in rigid supports which simulated the baf-
fle plates. It was concluded that the clearances between the tubes and
the baffle plates were too great and that the tubes would have to be
supported more rigidly.

The frequency and amplitude of the shell vibrations were measured
with an IRD model 600B vibration analyzer. No highly specific natural
frequencies were detected; but, instead, there was a large amount of
background noise.

Drain Tank Heater

 

After 5560 hr of operation, the prototype drain-tank-heater test
was shut down by burnout of one of the welded connections in the No. 10
nickel lead wire between the enclosed ceramic heating elements. The fail-
ure occurred at a "tee' connection, where a point of high resistance was
produced by improper fusion at the weld point. The heating elements were
in good condition. The weld was repalred, and the testing was continued.
All similar welds in the reactor heaters are being reexamined.

Pipe Heaters

 

A production model of the removable heater and insulation unit for
5-in. pipe was received from the Mirror Insulation Company for testing.
Figure 2.1 shows the assembled unit, including the remote disconnect.
The type of power lead shown is used only in the test; in the reactor,
mineral insulation will be provided, protected by a flexible metallic
tube. Iigure 2.2 shows the heater and base arrangement for the same
unit. Fach ceramic heater has a capacity of 667 w, and there are six
heaters per straight-run section. The production model differs from
the unit previously tested! in that it contains pure silver in the sec-
ond lamination instead of silver plated on the surface of the first
lamination. Both the base and removable sections are made up as follows:
inside surface facing pipe, 310 stainless steel; 2d lamination, 0.003 in.
of silver; 3d to 8th laminations, 0.003 in. of 321 SS; and outside case,
304 SS. Some of the miscellaneous fittings are made of Inconel.

A comparison of the initial performance of the production unit with
the original unit tested is shown in Fig. 2.3. The production unit per-
formed slightly better than the prototype. The test will continue in
order to evaluate the effect of age on performance.

Drain Tank Cooler

 

Two prototype cooling bayonets for the drain-tank cooler were fab-
ricated of INOR-8 to reactor specifications and installed in the carbo-
nate salt tank for test. The water input to these cooling bayonets was
regulated by controlling the water level in the steam dome. Water was
fed to one bayonet inlet tube from near the bottom of the steam dome,
the other from a point 7 in. above the bottom. This simulates the two
types of conditions in the MSRE drain tank. The bayonets were operated
through 180 rapid-quench cycles (1350 to 212°F), a total of 3400 hr.
The tubes were removed and examined periodically. At 126 cycles, both
tubes were in good condition; but at 180 cycles, the assembly with the
higher inlet was badly warped. Examinagtion by penetrant dye check and
by metallography methods revealed no cracks; however, the outside sur-
faces of both l/Z-in. tubes were heavily covered with oxide.

Before the tests were continued, thermocouples were installed on
the exteriors of both l/Z—in. water tubes at the point of maximum warp-
age, approximately 1 ft below the surface of the salt. It was noted
during the heat-up cycle (after the water return valve from the con-
denser to the steam dome was turned off) that the temperature of the
high~inlet tube approached that of the salt very rapidly as the water
boiled out, but the low-inlet tube temperature rose only to 500 — 800°F.
After the steam dome was drained completely, the low-inlet tube tempera-
ture behaved in a manner resembling that of the other tube. Apparently,
a small amount of water condensed in the uninsulated steam dome, pro-
viding a small feed to the low-inlet tube. The resultant lower tem-
perature of the tube reduced the shock load during the initial quench,

which in turn caused less damage to the low-inlet tube. The test was
continued to determine the amount of heat removed by the small feed
and the life of the bayonet with the high-inlet tube.

Modified Freeze Valves

 

The operation of the reactor requires that some of the freeze valves
should open in the event of a total power failure. The important design
features of these valves are the high heat capacity, the insulated en-
closure, and the integral cooling Jjacket on the valve. Figure 2.4 is a
photograph of this type of valve showing the air coolant jacket and the
heating arrangement. The insulation around the air jacket was partially
removed for the photograph. Heat is supplied to the frozen zone of the
valve by conduction along the l-l/Zuin. pipe. The ceramic heaters, which
are on at all times, are installed in the removable insulation section.

In Fig. 2.4 the removable section has been laid back on its side, at

right angles to its closed position, and extends from the top of the photo-
graph to behind the pipe. The removable insulation section and the base
section are metal boxes packed with Fiberfrax wool insulation to give the
unit a higher heat capacity than that for the reflective type heater boxes
which are used on the piping. The valve may be frozen or thawed by regu-
lating the air input.

The average melt time for this type valve was 10 min with 620 w
applied to the heater box; the average freeze time was 15 to 30 min with
15 scfm of airflow through the cooling jacket. The airflow required to
keep the plug frozen was 5 to 6 scfm.

Reactor Drain Valve

 

A prototype of the reactor drain valve FV-103 was fabricated and in-
stalled in the valve test system. Figure 2.5 shows the valve prior to
operation. An attempt was made to simulate reactor operating conditions
by enclosing the valve in a 25-ft° insulated container and supplying heat
to the pipe by radiation from heaters located on one wall of the container.
This condition is similar to that of the valve's receiving heat from a
surface of the reactor vessel.

The controls for the valve test were representative of the system
proposed for use in the reactor and included the electronic modules used
in setting limits on the thermocouple readings.

In preliminary tests the freeze times were 20 to 25 min, with the
average temperature in the valve area initially at 1000 to 1100°F. The
melt time averaged 5-1/2 min. The thaw time, with all power off, was
13 min. Tests are continuing.

Control Rod Test

 

The prototype control-rod-drive unitl was operated under MSRE con-
ditions (except for radiation) through a total of 40,000 cycles, or
255,000 ft of rod travel. The lower rod and the thimbles were held at
1200 to 1300°F; the cooling air and drive unit were held at lSOOF. As
a result of these tests, minor mechanical modifications were required
as described below.

It was necessary to strengthen the rib cage at the bottom of the
rod thimble to prevent buckling at temperature. This was done by in-
creasing the number of retaining rings.

The convoluted hose of the control rod broke near the tow block
after 2500 cycles owing to excessive wear caused by a misalignment of
the internal air tube. However, the wire-mesh Jjacket around the hose
kept the rod attached to the drive. A bushing was added to this tow
block to center the air tube in the flexible metal hose, and examina-
tion after 17,000 cycles revealed only minor wear in the hose.
30

The shock absorber, preload spring, and plunger knob were modified
to increase the buffered stroke to 3 in. Initially, the stroke was less
than 1 in.

At 17,438 cycles the drive unit ceased operating owing to complete
failure of the aluminum-bronze worm wheel in the gear reduction unit.
Examination revealed that the working surface of the steel worm was
scored slightly, and the teeth of the bronze worm wheel were completely
destroyed. The reason for the failure was not clear since the loading
on the gears was very low. Possible reasons might be overheating, im-
proper aligmment of the worm and wheel, or slight damage to the bronze
worm wheel at some time either before assembly or during the preliminary
testing. Alternate methods of gearing have been suggested to avoid re-
currence of this failure but were discarded as impractical. Alternate
materials such as nodular cast iron for the worm wheel and chromium
plating for the worm are being considered. A brass worm wheel was ma-
chined to match the original worm and was installed in the unit so the
test could continue. After 16,400 cycles, when it was removed to install
the replacement gears, the brass gear was slightly worn but was still in
good condition. The new gears, which are duplicates of the original set,

have not operated long enough to form any conclusions as to why the orig-
inal gears failed.

Measurements made on a new, flexible control rod indicated that 95%
of' the permanent elongation occurred during the first week of operation.
Total variation of the rod length during the 14,000 cycles after the
first week was less than t0.025 in. Prerunning new rods at temperature
for a period of several days seems worth while in that it allows the rods
to stretch to the final operating length. In some cases this initial
stretch has been as much as 0.9 in.

The synchro system for remote indication of the rod position has
operated satisfactorily. The precise position indicator is calibrated to
0.050 in.; the accuracy of position required is only 0.2 in. The single-
point position index is capable of reading the position of the bottom of
the rod to £0.015 in.

A dynamic brake which was installed to reduce the overtravel of the
rod during manual operation performed satisfactorily.

The air for cooling the rod and drive enters at 150°F and is divided
to provide 2.3 scfm to the rod and 2.3 scfm to the housing. The motor
temperature has been constant at 230°F with a 0.6-amp input at 110 v. It
was necessary to replace the Diehl drive motor at 23,791 cycles due to
failure of the front motor bearing. The lubricant in the bearing had com-
pletely carbonized, indicating overheating, and this problem is being in-
vestigated.

The magnetic clutch is normally operated at 28 v; however, this volt-
age was varied to observe the effect of the rod release time. It was
estimated that increasing the clutch voltage from 12 v to 28 v increased
the drop time by 25 msec. The acceleration during drop was estimatedl to
be 13 fps. Bafety analysis of the MSRE has indicated that the release
and drop times are acceptable.
31

It was demonstrated that the control rod assembly can be installed
and removed from the thimble by remote maintenance methods.

Although the problems noted above have been encountered in testing
the control rod and drive, a life of about one year in the reactor seems
to be assured if minor improvements are made. These improvements are
being incorporated in the design so that manufacture of the drive can pro-
ceed.

Helium Purification System

 

The oxygen-removal unit was operated at a constant helium flow of
10 liters/min (STP), a constant temperature of ll6OOF, and a constant
inlet oxygen concentration of 225 ppm by volume to determine the point
at which the concentration of oxygen in the effluent became detectable,
that is 2 0.1 ppm. Breakthrough occurred when approximately 58% of the
titanium had been consumed. The period of operation was equivalent to
about 40 days of operation at 6000 liters/day of helium containing 225 ppm
of oxygen. ©Since the oxygen level in the supply to the MSRE purification
system should average less than 20 ppm by volume, the life of one charge
of titanium (200 g) should be at least one year. Design and operating
conditions are shown in Table 2.1.

Tests were made to determine the nature of a black deposit that had
been observed by others® using similar equipment and that was thought to
be due to a volatile titanium compound which reacted with the molten salt.

Test results indicated that the deposit was carbon, or carbonaceous
material, resulting from high-temperature decomposition of organic sol-
vents which had been used for cleaning various system components. Where
solvent cleaning was eliminated, no black deposit was formed.

Ingineering Test Loop

 

The Engineering Test Loop (ETL) was returned to operation in July
1963, after examination of the graphite access joint.” Since then the
loop has operated 4400 hr, mainly for testing the sampler-enricher mockup
and for following the inventory of uranium added to the loop. Additions
totaling 1528 g of enriching salt (930 g of uranium) have been made with

the sampler-enricher to an estimated inventory of 143.8 kg of circulating
salt.

The uranium was added in the form of an LiF-UF, (73-27 mole %) eu-
tectic and varied in uranium content between 76 and 91 g for each
addition. TFigure 2.6 shows the variation in the ratio of the uranium
concentration from chemical analysis to the uranium concentration as cal-
culated from the uranium additions. The initial uranium inventory in this
plot was taken as 0.63 wt % (~0.1 mole %), which is the average of the
results of analysis of 40 samples taken over a period of 3600 hr oper-
ation before any additions were made. The additions raised the concen-
tration level to ~0.2 mole %. However, as shown in the figure, the
analysis of samples taken after additions 6 to 11 averaged ~9% below
the predicted uranium concentration. Efforts toward resolving the dis-
crepancy are continuing.

Mockup of Sampler-Enricher System

The sampler-enricher system mockup® which is installed in the Engin-
cering Test Loop (ETL) was used to isolate 35 salt samples and to add 11
capsules of enriching salt to the pump bowl under simulated reactor con-
ditions. Most of the components operated reliably and satisfactorily,

although some minor changes in equipment and control circuitry were in-
dicated from these tests.

Sample Capsule

 

During the initial stages of testing, an open-top type of sample cap-
sule lodged under a sheet-metal sleeve which had been inserted into the
capsule guide cage in the pump bowl. The sleeve had been installed as an
experimental expedient to reduce mist in the sample area of the ETL pump,
but it will not be used in the reactor pump. The stainlesgss steel support

cable was pulled free of the lodged capsule. The capsule then dropped to
the bottom of the pump bowl within the guide cage and was recovered with-
out exposing the pump bowl to the atmosphere. The capsule was modified
to include a spherical top, which reduces the tendency for the capsule to
bind and strengthens the connection between the capsule and the support
cable.

Enriching Capsule

 

Enriching capsules of three lengths were tried, and the intermediate
length of 6-3/8 in. was chosen as the best. The capsules were fabricated
from S/M—in.—OD 0.035-in.-wall copper tubing by spinning a hemispherical
shape on the bottom and welding a machined hemispherical insert on the
top. After each capsule was filled with salt, three 0.191-in.-diam holes
were drilled in a line along the side and one 0.221-in.-diam hole was
drilled in the bottom. The capsule was lowered into the pump bowl and
left for 5 min to allow the salt to melt. ©No salt remained in the three
capsules of this size after removal from the pump bowl. Approximately
152 g of salt (92 g of uranium) was added per capsule.

cample Transport Container

 

The sample transport container, used for sending the sample from the
reactor to the hot cell under an inert atmosphere, was modified slightly
by making the capsule receiving cup deeper. This was done to simplify the
problem of removing and inserting the capsule with the manipulator. The
threads connecting the top and bottom pieces were changed from 21 to 7
threads per inch to reduce the tendency to gall.

Manipulator

 

The manipulator has performed all the necessary operations. The fin-
gers were strengthened to lmprove the operation. There is a small gas
leak from the atmosphere side through the manipulator boots into the vac-
uum buffer zones. Efforts to locate the leak and to improve the end seal
are continuing.

Valves

The leak rate of buffer gas through the seals of the removal valve,
the operational valve, and the access port is determined from the pressure
in the buffer zone.® After six months of operation the removal valve and
access port seals have no detectable leaks, and the operational valve has
a leak rate of about L cm3/min (which is acceptable), the same as when in-
stalled.

Design

Design of the sampler-enricher for the reactor is 90% complete. The
motor drive units of the operational and maintenance valves were relocated
outside the contaimment and shielding areas. The removal valve and light
source were relocated external to the containment area. All electrical
35

and gas disconnects inside the contaimment areas were eliminated. It is
expected that these changes will simplify maintenance and reduce fabrica-
tion costs.

Maintenance Development

 

Preparations were started on a program of malintenance demonstrations,
using some of the reactor components, during the erection and precritical
testing periods. The objectives of this program are to establish that no
additional problems have been introduced during construction; to provide
a final test of tools and techniques developed in the mockup; to test
equipment which could not be tested in the mockup; and to acquaint reactor
operating personnel with the equipment, techniques, and problems of the
mailntenance procedures. The following categories are included.

Television Viewing

 

As a result of an examination of a SNAP reactor dismantling facility®
of Atomics International and some tests made 1n the maintenance mockup, it
was decided to use two television cameras set 90° apart for auxiliary
viewing in the MSRE rather than the stereo arrangement previously studied.
The existing cameras, controls, and monitors (used originally in the MSR
Maintenance Development Facility) have been set up at Bldg. 7503 to be
used during the maintenance demonstration. Portable camera stands de-
signed for use around the worst restrictions were prepared for testing.

Maintenance Shield

 

The L-ft-wide portable shield, designed specifically for use in main-
tenance of the MSRE, was received and set up for test as shown in Fig. 2.7.
Minor reworking of bearing surfaces was necessary to improve the operation
of the slides. The method of attaching an additional drive motor was
worked out so that the ends of the shield slides could be moved independ-
ently.

Long-Handled Tools

 

Several long-handled tools were designed, built, and tested, five of
which are shown in Fig. 2.8. 1In addition, a procedure was developed for
handling auxiliary piping spool pieces of various sizes, with and without
flexible joints. The handling scheme utilizes four separate, but very
simple, long-handled tools and several specially fabricated "C" clamps.
Prototype extension sockets with self-contained bolt retainers were de-
signed and bullt for use on various masts. Some flexibility was incorpo-
rated into the socket design for overcoming axial misaligmment of the
mast with the bolt heads.

operated for 1400 hr, circulating salt LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (66.L4-27.3-

4.7-0.9-0.7 mole %) at the conditions and for the purposes shown in Table
Del

After 703 hr of operation, the pump was stopped to investigate the
cause of increased use of power. Inspection revealed that the shaft annu-
lus was plugged with solidified salt. Analysis® of the flow of inert gas
to and from the pump indicated that the flow of gas in the shaft annulus

had been in the upward, or reverse, direction for the 703-hr period. This

condition was caused by ignoring the contribution of gas flow into the

pump from the bubble-type liquid-level indicator which had been assumed €O

be very small but actually was 1400 cmB/min. To prevent recurrence of

this reverse flow during operation of the prototype pump, all the gas flow

rates to and from the pump tank will be measured and maintained — as in the
reactor installation — so as to provide adequate purge flow down the shaft

annulus.

Hydraulic performance data were obtained at 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300,
and 1400°F along a single resistance line. There was no measurable dif-
ference in the performance with a variation in temperature. A plot of
head flow rate, with speed as a parameter, is shown in Fig. 2.9 for an
ll—l/Z—in.—diam impeller and salt at 1200°F. These data were obtained
for three lines of constant resistance as shown. The pump hydraulic bal-
ance line 1s superimposed on the plot; during operation on this line, the
net radial hydraulic force on the impeller caused by pressure distribu-
tion in the volute approaches zero. The maximum head required for the
MSRE fuel-salt circuit is 48 ft at a flow of 1200 gpm. The ll—l/Z—in.~
diam impeller provides a total head of 43.3 £t at 1200 gpm and 1150 rpm.

Measurement of Undissolved Gas Circulating with the Molten Salt. In-
vestigations® were continued toward improving the calibration of the test
apparatus. A common support for the source and detector was fabricated
and mounted to the test section of pipe. With this arrangement, the source
and detector always maintain the same alignment, and since the support is
attached to the test pipe, they move with the pipe during thermal expansion.

Drift of the signal output from the detector at steady-state condi-
tions has been a problem, and schemes for minimizing it are being investi-
gated.

MSRE Fuel Pump Supports. The fuel pump supportsi© were altered and
reinstalled in the prototype pump test facility for final testing. We
found that the spring force required to 1lift the pump and drive motor was
8000 1b. About 1650 1b of this force results from friction and other
losses in the mechanisms.?*!' The vibration dampeners proved to be unneces-
sary. The configuration of the mechanical linkages in the mount is such
That the net upward force provided by the springs increases as the pump
moves vertically after counterbalancing has taken place; this action pro-
duces small tensile forces on the pump suction and discharge piping.

 

Lubrication Systems for the MSRE Pumps. The lubrication stands for
the fuel and coolant pumps were installed and operated individually in the
prototype pump test facility. Heat-load and pressure-drop data were ob-
tained, and the performance of the systems was observed.l2 A problem of
gas entraimment was found which affected the priming of the standby lub-
rication pump. After about 8 hr of continuous operation, when the roles
of the operating and standby pumps were reversed, approximately 30 sec
was required before the newly started pump would fully prime. Priming
time was reduced to 5 sec by installing gas vents from the pump volute
casing and the pump discharge line to the gas space in the reservoir. At
The MSRE the standby pump on each lubrication stand will be operated for
approximately 15 min during each 8-hr shift to remove the accumulated gas.

 

Rotary Assemblies for the MSRE Fuel- and Coolant-Salt Pumps

The fuel- and coolant-salt pump rotary assemblies are being assembled
for proof testing prior to delivery to the MSRE site.

Test Pump with One Molten-Salt-Lubricated Bearing

 

The molten-salt bearing for this pumpt® has been replaced, and the
pump is belng assembled for further endurance operation.

PKP Fuel-Pump High-Temperature Endurance Test

 

The test pump rotary assemblyt? was found acceptable in the cold
shakedown test and was installed in the hot-test facility. Test operation
has been delayed by the emphasis placed on completing hardware for the MSRE
pumps .

Lubrication-Pump Endurance Test

 

The lubrication pumpt> circulated turbine-type oil at 160°F and 70
gpm for 4550 hr without incident during the report period.

MK-I1 Fuel Pump

 

The fabrication of a mockup of the MK-II pump tankl® for water test-
ing was completed. The internal baffles and shields required to minimize
the entrainment of gas bubbles into the circulating fluid via the return
of the bypass flows to the pump impeller will be developed in this mockup.

Large numbers of very small bubbles were present in the pump tank
liquid in the initial tests. Modification of the baffles to reduce this

gas entrainment are being studied.

MSRE Pump Fabrication

 

Fabrication of the fuel pump bowl, the lubrication stands for the
fuel- and coolant-salt pumps, and the supports for the fuel-salt pump were
completed, and all were delivered to the MSRE site for installation. The
first of four drive motors for the fuel- and coolant-salt pumps passed the
required electrical tests and was shipped by the manufacturer. The other
three units are in various stages of fabrication.

Instrument Development

 

High-Temperature NaK-Filled Differential-Pressure Transmitter

 

The problems in the design of the high-temperature seals, previously
reported,l7 were resolved in discussions at the Taylor Instrument Company
plant between Taylor and ORNL metallurgists and instrument design engi-
neers. The major problem in the design of these seals was that of obtain-
ing a seal that would satisfy ORNL requirements for minimum thickness and
maximum temperature effect on the transmitted signal. Agreement was
reached at the meeting to use a 3I-ply, la-convolution diaphragm. Each ply
is 0.005 in. thick and is welded to the seal head assembly in vacuum by
the electron beam technique. Taylor originally objected to the use of
multi-ply diaphragms on the basis that expansion of the gas trapped be-
tween the plys would produce excessive temperature shifts when the seal
assemblies were heated; however, these objectives were withdrawn when
ORNL metallurgists proposed to weld the assembly in a vacuum with an elec-
tron beam.

Three transmitters have been completed and delivered to ORNL. All
welding and weld inspection of the high-temperature diaphragm head assem-
blies was done at ORNL. Figure 2.10 shows the seal assembly with the dia-
phragm welded in place. Prior to shipment from the factory, the trans-
mitters were tested, with the following results: maximum hysteresis,

0.66% of full scale; maximum deviation from linearity, 0.37% of scale;
zero shift after 45 1b reverse pressure was applied to the seals, 0.9%;
and calibration change for 2500F change in temperature (1000 — 1250°F),
0.64%. Two of these units were recalibrated at the MSRE site and welded
into the system. The third transmitter is a spare. Additional tests
will be performed on this unit.

Thermocouple Development and Testing

 

Drift Test. The testing of thermocouples, made of materials selected
from MSRE stock, for drift in calibrations at MSRE operating temperatures
was begun. Prev1ous tests were performed on thermocouples supplied by a
vendor. Random drifts of +1.5 to +2.5°F were Observed when eight thermo-
couples were cycled between 1000 and 1400°F during the initial calibration
period, which lasted nine days. The couples have operated continuously at
1250°F since the initial calibration period. Additional drifts of the
order of +1.1 to +2.00F were observed during periodic checks made over an
ll-week period ending January 22, 1964. This drift is thought to be due
partially to inadequate annealing after fabrication. This test is contin-
uing.

 
43

Thermocouples on Engineering Test Loop. Eight MSRE prototype surface-
mounted thermocouples on the ETL continue to be checked periodically for
performance. These thermocouples have accumulated a total of 21 months of
service in operation at temperatures up to 1200°F. All are still function-
ing properly.

 

Thermocouples on Prototype Pump Test Loop. Ten MSRE prototype sur-
face-mounted thermocouples on the prototype pump test loop continued to
perform satisfactorily according to periodic checks. These couples accu-
mulated only 1176 hr of operation at 1200°F during this report period due
to loop downtime. To date, they have operated 6500 hr at 1200°F.

 

Thermocouples on Prototype of Reactor Drain Valve. Six MSRE proto-
type thermocouples were installed on the FV-103 test assembly. Attach-
ments were made in accordance with MSR-63-40 (an internal memo), entitled
Procedure for Welding of Thermocouples to MSRE Piping and Components. A
seventh thermocouple, with an ungrounded junction and insulated sheath,
was installed on the resistance-heated section of pipe downstream of the
valve. It is located inside the heater sleeve next to the weldment of
the sleeve and pipe.

 

 

Drain Tank Thermocouple Bayonet Test. Development tests were con-
ducted on an assembly of thermocouples that will be installed in a thimble
in each drain tank to measure the axial temperature distribution in the
salt. A preliminary test was performed to determine if the salt tempera-
ture could be measured with acceptable accuracy with thermocouples at-
tached to a tube inserted in a well (No. 30 AWG bare thermocouples were
used in this test). Temperatures indicated by thermocouples mounted at
The same level on the inserted tube and the outer wall of the well were
compared. Under steady-state conditions the temperatures indicated by the
thermocouples on the inserted tube were only 1 to 3°F lower than the tem-
perature of the outer wall of the well at 1200°F. A final test was made
with l/8—in.—OD, metal-sheathed, mineral-insulated thermocouples welded to
a 1.5-in.~-0D x 0.065-in.-wall 304 8S tube filled with Fiberfrax insulation.
The results of this test were the same as above.

 

Dimensions of the wells installed on the tanks were obtained from the
field. The design of the bayonets is complete, and the reactor installa-
tion is being designed.

Radiation-Damage Test of Thermocouple Leadwire, Disconnects, and
Sealing Materials. A radiation-damage test was begun November 26, 1963,
on copper-sheathed, glass-insulated, multiconductor thermocouple cable,
disconnects, and sealing materials. The latter were glass-to-metal header
seals, ceramic and epoxy potting compounds, PVC shrinkable tubing and
Physical Science's 0900 glaze compound. These items are being exposed at
a level of 2 x 106 r/hr in the cobalt gamma source in Bldg. 3029. Break-
down of Insulation is being checked periodically with a 500-v megger and
an ohmmeter. None has been detected during an eight-week period. The
€poxy compound and PVC shrinkable tubing began showing physical damage
after seven weeks of exposure. The only other change noted was a constant
bulldup of pressure in the hermetically sealed thermocouple cable, indi-
cating a possible outgassing of the filler in the glass insulation. The

 

 
4ty

gas was sampled and analyzed. Although there is slight indication of
radioactivity in the gas, it is believed at this time that the outgassing
can be tolerated. This test is continuing.

Thermocouple Test Assembly for Temperature Safety Channel

A device has been developed which permits the insertion of a test
signal into the input of the reactor temperature safety instrument channels
without disconnecting any wires and which is compatible with the require-
ments for physical isolation of redundant safety channels. The device con-
sists of a vacuum thermocouple assembly of the type frequently used to
measure the rms value of rf currents and an associated transformer and push
button switch. The vacuum thermocouple consists of a fine-wire heater sup-
ported at each end with a fine-wire thermocouple attached to its center by
a ceramic bead. This whole assembly is sealed in an evacuated glass bulb.
By passing a current through the heater, an electromotive force (emf) is
generated by the thermocouple. The emf generated is approximately 0.07
mv/ma, with the maximum permissible current being 200 ma. Thus the full-
range output is approximately 14 mv, which is equivalent to 560°F on the
Chromel-Alumel thermocouple scale. Leads of the device may be connected
to simulate either a temperature increase or decrease, depending on
the polarity of the voltage output. A schematic diagram of the device
is shown in Fig. 2.11.

Temperature Alarm Switches

 

The testing of the Electra Systems switch system was completed in
conjunction with the freeze valve tests. The switches operated satis-
factorily. ©OSome modifications were made to improve switch control action:
an adjustable switching hysteresis was added, and a ten-turn potentiometer
was used to replace the single-turn calibration potentiometer to provide
easier set point adjustment.

Tests of freeze valve FV-103 are under way with the same switches.

Marker Generator for Temperature Scanner

 

A signal-marking device was developed for use in providing positive
identification of thermocouple signals on the MSRE temperature scanner.l®
A block diagram of this device, which was assembled from commercially
avallable components, is shown in Fig. 2.12. The wave-form generator sup-
plies a ramp voltage whose amplitude varies linearly with time. The ramp
generator is triggered by a synchronizing pulse from the mercury commu-
tator, once each revolution. When the generator is triggered, the ramp is
started. When it reaches a preset amplitude, the pulse generator produces
a voltage pulse which is applied to the grid of the scope, causing a
bright spot to appear on the scope screen. Since the ramp voltage is pro-
portional to elapsed time, which in turn corresponds to a particular input
signal channel, signal identification is achieved. The pulse-generator
trigger voltage is adjustable in 100 steps. This is done by a potentiom-
eter whose dial setting corresponds to the number of the input signal
channel. The device 1s under test on the prototype scanner.

Bubbler-Type Molten-Salt-Level Indicator

Developmental testing of the bubbler level system on the MSRE proto-
type pump test facility was continued. The system using the open-ended,
46

V-notched dip leg has continued to perform satisfactorily. As reported pre-
viously,19 the bubbler dip leg with the l/8—in. hole was plugged with

salt. ©Gince attempts to remove this plug were unsuccessful, the trans-.
mitter was disconnected, and the riser on the plugged dip leg was capped.

Helium flow rate and pressure drops were measured in the developmental
bubbler installation to obtain data for evaluating the design of the MSRE

bubbler installations.

Float-Type Molten-Salt-Level Transmitter

 

Developmental testing of the float-type molten-salt-level transmitters
on separate installations in the MSRE level test and prototype pump test
facilities was continued. Twenty-four months of operation at MSRE tempera-
tures has been accumulated on the two transmitters installed on the level
test facility. The transmitter installed on the pump test facility has
been in operation since July 1963. This instrument, which is operating
under dynamic conditions approximating those to be encountered in the
MSRE, underwent several startup and shutdown cycles during this period.
Performance of all instruments under test continues to be satisfactory.

Design and development of a float-type level transmitter for use in
measurement of molten-salt level of the pump bowl of the MK-II pump was
started.

Results obtained from design studies and bench experiments indicate
that the present design could be scaled up to give a usable range of
16 in. without loss of accuracy, sensitivity, or linearity.

Mthough a 16-in. range would be desirable, 8 in. was selected for
the design of the MK-II level instrument. The choice of this restricted
range was based on the following considerations:

1. An 8-in. range satisfies operational and safety requirements.

2. Direct installation of the float in the pump bowl is desirable.

3. Major alterations in the design of the pump bowl would be required
to obtain a range greater than 8 in. with direct installation.

L. A 36-in.-long transformer would be required to obtain a 16-in. range.
Construction of a transformer more than 30 in. long would require

additional development and testing.

Materials necessary for fabrication of this instrument are now on
hand, and fabrication will begin when detail design is completed.

oingle-Point Level Indicator

 

Revisions to the design of the level probes for the MSRE drain tanks
to provide a secondary contaimment barrier were completed and approved.
Fabrication and preinstallation testing of the MSRE probes was completed,
and they are being installed.
47

opecifications were written for alarm transducers for use with these
probes, and procurement was initiated. The alarm transducer will be bas-
ically a solid-state (transistorized) relay amplifier which will detect
the presence or absence of a low-level 1000-cps signal in the presence of
60-cycle pickup and random electrical noise.

Positive~Position Indicator for MSRE Control Rod

Experiments were performed to determine whether the control rod posi-
tion-indicator system previously described®® could be adapted for use on
the MSRE.

Initial studies indicated that the MORE piping and the basic indi-
cator system should be modified in order to obtain usable signal levels
and to eliminate sensitivity to variations in reactor cell pressure.

(This was subsequently confirmed by experiments.) Since a number of de-
sign parameters were either unavailable or difficult to acquire, the MSRE
system was simulated on the MSRE control rod test facility. By experimen-
tation, it was determined that usable signals—pressure charges of 1 to

were placed in the lines to each rod thimble and housing and that a pres-—
sure bridge system was used to minimize the effects of variations in reac-
tor cell pressure. A flow diagram of the revised system is shown in Fig.
z.13. This system will be susceptible to long-term drifts and may require
some adjustment before use. Since only occasional calibration of the rod
position synchro transmitters will be required, this drift is acceptable.

Pressure-Transmitter Expansion Chamber Assembly

 

A device has been developed, for use with the Foxboro ECI pressure
transmitter, that will provide the secondary containment barrier required
when the transmitters are connected to the reactor primary system. The
device consists of a floating diaphragm assembly in a housing (see Fig.
2.14). The volume above the diaphragm is connected to the reference port
of the pressure transmitter. The volume below the diaphragm is at atmos-
pheric pressure. During normal operation, the device acts as a free-
Tloating slack diaphragm and introduces less than O.l% error in the trans-
mitter signal. 1In the event of a rupture of the bellows assembly in the

A prototype unit was designed, fabricated, and tested. Test results

showed that performance and structural strength were within specifications.
Ten additional units of this type are being fabricated for use in the MSRE.

Nuclear Analysis Report

 

The nuclear analysis part of the MSRE Design and Operations Report
was prepared and issued.t The purpose of this part is to describe the
nuclear characteristics of the final design of the MSRE and, to some ex-
tent, to show the basis for choosing this design. It includes information
on critical fuel concentration, reactivity control, fission product poi-
soning, kinetics, nuclear heat sources, radiation sources, and shielding.

Flux Distributions from an External Neutron Source

A neutron source will be installed in the MSRE thermal shield for
use in monitoring the subcritical multiplication in the core during the
initial loading of enriched uranium and during routine startups. Because
of the air gap between the reactor vessel and the thermal shield, there
will be considerable scattering of source neutrons to the detectors, by-
passing the core and reducing the sensitivity of the count rate to multi-
plication in the core.

Two-group, two-dimensional neutron-diffusion calculations were em-
ployed to predict flux distributions from an external source.2 Results
indicate that as RKerpp 1s raised from O to 0.95, the thermal neutron flux
in the nuclear instrument shaft (opposite the source tube) will increase
by a factor of 5. The fluxes in the instrument tubes in the thermal
shield are less sensitive to kefr because they are closer to the source
tube. It is concluded from the calculations that while the bypass flow
of neutrons from the source to the detectors must be taken into account,
the effect does not seriously hamper the monitoring of the subcritical
multiplication.

Criticality in Drain and Storage Tanks

 

Multigroup neutron-diffusion calculations were made to determine the
limiting conditions for criticality in the fuel storage tank or the fuel
drain tanks.” Criticality could be reached only if the uranium became
abnormally concentrated near the center of the tank. Figure 3.1 shows the
calculated kers in the fuel storage tank as a function of the concentra-
tion factor of a central region containing all the uranium. Similar re-
sults were obtained for the drain tanks, the major difference being that
the poisoning effect of the cooling thimbles raised the minimum critical
concentration factor to 5. Accidental concentration by such large factors
appears to be physically impossible (see Chap. 6, p. 114).

Shutdown to Ambient Temperature with Fuel in the Core

 

In a normal shutdown the MSRE is made subcritical by inserting the
control rods and then draining the fuel from the core before the system
is allowed to cool down. The fuel is drained because 1t would be very
difficult to avoid damage on remelting a core full of frozen salt. Fur-
thermore, the poisoning effect of the control rods is not enough to keep
the core subcritical at temperatures much below the freezing point.

In the extremely unlikely event that it becomes necessary to cool
the system to ambient temperature while fuel 1s in the core, criticality
could be prevented by the addition of a neutron poison to the fuel salt
before it is allowed to freeze. Li®PF is a convenient material for this
purpose because it readily dissolves in the fuel salt, and only a small
amount is required. Multigroup neutron-diffusion calculations were used
to estimate the concentration of Li® required to keep the reactor sub-
critical at 70°F. An extreme case was considered in which the control
rods were fully withdrawn and the fuel contained enough UP2° for 4% 8k/k
excess reactivity at 1200°F. (The maximum loading will probably provide
less than 3% 8k/k excess.) Even in this case only 0.26 kg of Li®, evenly
dispersed in the 70 ft° of fuel salt, is adequate to ensure nuclear shut-
down at TO°F.

Computational Methods--Revisions in Cross
Sections and Group Structure

 

 

Nuclear calculations previously reported for the final design of the
MSRE used multigroup cross sections generated by the General Atomic GAM-I
program. Because GAM-1 did not include Li6, Li7, and. F'° cross sections,
it was necessary to simulate their effect in the GAM-1 spectrum calcu-
lations and to compile group cross sections for these nuclides from basic
cross section data.! A revised version of the program,* GAM-II, which
includes the lithium isotopes and fluorine, was recently acquired by ORNL.
A few calculations for the MSRE have been made with cross sections from
GAM-~1T.

Table 3.1 compares critical concentrations and concentration coefl-
Ticients of reactivity calculated by the same 33-group diffusion method,
but with different sets of group cross sections. The differences appear
to reflect primarily a decrease in the neutron age-to-thermal in the calcu-
lations using GAM-I1 cross sections. This in turn is attributable to
inelastic scattering in fluorine, included in GAM-II but not in the
earlier calculations. IFurther investigations of the effects of the re-
vised cross sections on the predicted nuclear properties of the MSRE are
being made.

In preparation for more detailed control rod studies, calculations
were made to determine the minimum number of neutron energy groups re-
quired to adequately represent the MSRE core in one- and two-dimensional
diffusion computations. Sets of multigroup cross sections with 32, 16,
8, and 4 fast groups were generated using the GAM-II program. One-
dimensional diffusion calculations were then made by use of the MODRIC
program and a radial geometric model of the core previously described.t
The critical concentrations obtained in this manner agreed with each
other to within 1%. Thus it promises to be feasible to simplify future
calculations for the MSRE by using as few as four fast groups.

Prompt Temperature Coefficient in a Large
Molten-5alt Converter Reactor

In the summer of 196%, a preliminary hazards evaluation of a large-
scale Molten-Salt Converter Reactor (MSCR) was made by a group of ORSORT
students. In conjunction with this study, a separate analysis was made
of the factors determining the prompt temperature coefficient of re-
activity in a large MSCR. As contrasted to the MSRE, neutron leakage
factors do not contribute substantially to the temperature coefficient
in these large systems. Instead, the principal reactivity effects which
do occur are due to temperature-induced changes in the nuclear parameters
of the lattice. Because of its importance in reactor stability, it is of

interest to examine the criteria which determine the fuel temperature re-
activity coefficient.
55

The sign of the fuel temperature coefficient was found to be deter-
mined by two parameters, the ratio of the fractional change in the tho-
rium resonance integral to the fractional change in fuel-salt density and
the ratio of the resonance absorption rate in thorium to the resonance
absorption rate in fissile material. Here, resonance absorptions are de-
fined as those absorptions occurring at all energies above a thermal cut-
off of about 1 ev. The temperature coefficient of the thorium resonance
integral is composed of two effects, that due to Doppler broadening and
that due to reduction in "blackness" of the fuel channel as the salt den-
sity is reduced. Both these effects tend to decrease reactivity by in-
creasing the resonance neutron absorption in thorium during a fuel temper-
ature rise. This tends to be countered, however, by a reduction in the
thorium absorption rate due to the decrease in the salt density. As long
as the net effect is an increase in absorption rate, the sign of the fuel
temperature coefficient is always negative. If this condition is not ful-
filled, there is a maximum ratio of Thorium to fissile material which will
keep the fuel temperature coefficient negative. This limit is determined
such that the net decrease in resonance absorption in thorium is compen-
sated by a loss in resonance fissions. These criteria are summarized in
Fig. %.2, where the ratio of the maximum resonance absorption rate in tho-
rium to the resonance absorption rate in fissile material is plotted as
a function of A, the ratio of the thorium resonance integral coefficient
to the salt density coefficient. (For ‘%[ > 1.0, the fuel temperature
coefficient is always negative.) Curves are given for both UZ>° and U=>2
as the fissile material. At the beginning of operation of an MSCR, the
fuel would probably consist largely of U=°> and would shift to a mixture
of U=7> and U2 as irradiation time accumulated. Both fuels must be con-
sidered since the Tuel temperature coefficient must be negative during the
entire operating life, and the resonance fission effect in U=>2 is sub-
stantially larger than that in U=>>.

A numerical analysis was made of a tTypical MSCR lattice, in order to
illustrate the practical significance of these criteria in reactor design.
For this purpose a lattice with cylindrical salt channels located at the
corners of L-in.-square graphite stringers was considered. The conditions
chosen were: volume fraction salt, 10%; operating temperature, 1200°F;
and base salt composition (LiF-BeF--ThF,), (68-2%-9 mole %). The base
salt composition given above was that obtained from an earlier economic
study> of a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSCR. To this base composition, fissile
material in the form of UF, was added.

For this lattice it was found that the temperature coefficient of the
thorium resonance integral slightly exceeded the magnitude of the temper-
ature coefficient of the salt density. Thus, in Fig. 3.2, A lies to the
right of —l1, and there is no restriction imposed on the thorium to fissile
material concentration ratio in the salt. Calculations were also made,
however, for the general case in which O =2 A = —lL. This is indicative of
the margin of safety, since the temperature coefficients cannot be calcu-
lated with complete accuracy, and also since the effective magnitude of A
could conceivably be reduced 1f there is a void coefficient of reactivity;
that is, changes in the salt density occur which are not controlled by the
salt temperature alone.

The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 3.3. The maximum
concentration ratios obtained do not appear to offer any practical re-
strictions on the thorium and uranium composition in the salt. If void
effects were present, the temperature-reactivity changes would ultimately
override any positive void reactivity. It may be tentatively concluded
that, in any practical design of an MSCR, the temperature coefficient of
the thorium resonance integral is large enough to ensure a negative prompt
temperature coefficient of reactivity.

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

 

Stress Rupture Strength

 

Mechanical properties are being determined for specimens from some
heats of INOR-8, from which MSRE components have been fabricated, to evalu-
ate the effects of large-scale production and requirements for improved
quality. Both tensile and stress rupture tests were completed for three
heats of INOR-8 (NI-5055, NI-5075, and NI-5081). The tensile test results
were reported previously.

The stress rupture results for these materials at 1100, 1500, and
1500°F are illustrated in Fig. 4.1. Examination of this figure reveals
that heats NI-5055 and NI-5081 are comparable in creep strength and creep
ductility, while heat NI-5075 appears both weaker and less ductile than
the other two.

The mechanical properties collected to date from the heats of INOR-8
produced for the MSRE indicate a significant improvement in the strength
of these materials over the strength of experimental heats of INOR-8, from
which the design strengths of the material were established.

Thermal Fatigue

 

The thermal fatigue behavior of INOR-8 is being investigated at the
University of Alabama under a subcontract. The procedure and preliminary
results were described previously.l’Z

Additional results of the program are presented in Fig. 4.2 as plastic
strain range vs cycles to failure and are seen to obey a Coffin-type re-
lation. The tests plotted involve several maximum temperatures as noted,
as well as rapid cycling and hold-time cycling, and further are obtained
from two specimen geometries. These data show good agreement with iso-
thermal-strain-fatigue data on this alloy.

An analysis of these same tests based on a plastic strain energy cri-
terion indicates that for fatigue of INOR-8 in this temperature range the
total plastic work to failure is a constant. Data have been plotted in
Fig. 4.3 as plastic strain energy vs cycles to failure. It is seen that the
data for 1300 and 1600°F fit curves having the same slope (approximately
—1) but with different intercepts. The intercept values (at Ne = 1/2) are
in fair agreement with plastic strain energy values from tensile tests at
the appropriate temperatures.

The influence of strain rate at elevated temperatures was investi-
gated, and these data are given in Table L4.2. The effect of irradiation
increases with decreasing strain rate. Figure 4.4 indicates that the ef-
fect of irradiation on the uniform elongation and true fracture strain may
reach a maximum at a temperature that is strain rate sensitive.

Fig. 4.4. Effect of Irradiation on the Ductility of INOR-8 at
Elevated Temperatures.

The effect of postirradiation annealing on the elevated-temperature
problem has been investigated. Numerous investigations® have shown that
vostirradiation heat treatments in the range 950 to 1100°C anneal the
damage causing embrittlement of stainless steel irradiated and deformed
at 20 to 100°C. Irradiated INOR-8 samples were given a 0.75-hr heat treat-
ment at 1175°C prior to deforming at 700 and 900°C. The properties of the
irradiated alloy given the postirradiation heat treatment are compared to
those not heat treated in Table L4.3. The stability of the irradiation-
induced defect associated with the elevated temperature problem is remarka-

ble.

The differences observed in these data obtained at 700°C and a strain rate
of 0.002 min™" are believed to be insignificant.

In summary, the ductility of INOR-8 in the absence of irradiation is
considered to be low at deformation temperatures of 800 and 900°C. The
low uniform elongations decrease with decreasing strain rate. The decrease
in uniform strain is accompanied by a large increase in fracture strain and
a reduction in true fracture stress. The alloy appears to work-soften at
elevated temperature at a specific temperature that is strain rate sensi-
tive.

The effect of irradiation at elevated temperatures on the mechanical
properties of INOR-8 is confined to temperatures in excess of 600°C. The
magnitude of the effect increases with decreasing strain rate. The effect
is one primarily of lowering the ductility. However, the ultimate engi-
neering stress and the true tensile stress are markedly reduced for those
deformation temperatures at which the work-hardening coefficient of the
alloy is high.

Evaluation of MSRE Graphite

 

Graphite bars, grade CGB, selected from material produced for the
MSRE moderator, are being evaluated for compliance with specifications and
to establish properties data useful to the MSRE. This testing is in ad-
dition to the quality control called for in the specification.

Structure of Grade CGB Graphite

 

Measurements on specimens machined from ten different bars indicate
that the bulk density values range from 1.8% to 1.87 g/cm®, with the ma-
jority of the bars having values of 1.86 g/cm®.

Precursory determinations of the spectrum of the open-pore entrance
diameters over the range of 100 to 0.02 p were made with a mercury porosim-
eter. The determinations were made on specimens from a bar with an aver-
age bulk density of 1.86 g/cm® and an accessible porosity of 9.6%. More
than 96% of this accessible porosity had pore entrance diameters smaller
than 0.2 p. If the MSRE graphite had no cracks, a pressure of ®600 psia
would be necessary to force the nonwetting molten MSRE fuel salt into 0.5%
of the bulk volume of the graphite, the design limit for the MSRE.

The spectrum of the entrance dilameters of the accessible pores for the
MSRE graphite has not been determined as a function of the various lots of
graphite bars. These data will be determined as soon as possible in order
to establish the overall spectrum of pore entrance diameters for all the
MSRE graphite. This would also be a relatively critical evaluation of the
quality control that is possible in fabricating graphite of this type.

The MSRE graphite 1s generally described by its manufacturer as basi-
cally a petroleum coke bonded with coal-tar pitch which is heated to 2800°C.
No carbon blacks are used. The low-permeation graphite is finished through
a series of impregnation and heat treatments. The final heat treatment is
to 2800°C minimum, so all components are fired to 2800°C or higher.

Four different major structures are visible in microscopic examinations:
the graphitized petroleum coke particles, the coal-tar pitch binder, and two
kinds of Impregnation structures. The graphitized petroleum coke particles
that constitute the bulk of the material are easily seen in Fig. 4.5. The
most difficult structure to see is the binder material between these large
graphite particles. The two types of structures developed through impreg-
nations and heat treatments are somewhat more resolvable than the binder.
One is the nonporous solid material located at or near the center of what
used to be a vold in the base stock graphite. This shows up as nonporous
white areas in photomicrographs, as shown in Fig. 4.5a. The other visible
impregnation structure 1s a cellular-like material that almost always com-
pletely fills a pore whether the other type of impregnation structure is
present or not.

At a magnification of 100, this cellular structure is not clearly re-
solved but appears black like a pore; however, with a magnification of 500,

this structure is clearly visible. The preceding statements are illus-
trated by Figs. 4.5a and L4.6c. If this structure is actually cellular,
this would explain how the small pore entrance diameters were finally ob-
tained. The pores measured in part were the diameters of the channels or
cells in this porous structure. All types of the MSRE graphite structures
are shown rather well in Fig. 4.6.

There is some structure variation in the graphite bars, as illustrated
by Fig. 4.5. In Fig. 4.5a, all forms of the basic structures that have
been described are present. In Fig. 4.5b, the nonporous white phase is
almost completely missing. These two types apparently are the extremes
within which the structure of the bars varies. No microscopic alterations
of the various structures of the graphite have been oObserved on irradiated
graphite. Examinations are planned to determine what changes were made in
the lattice constants of the crystallites.

Gas Evolution

 

It has been reported® that the Tenaciously held oxygen contamination
on three lots of MSRE graphites was determined to be 6 cm® of CO (STP) per
100 cem® of graphite. This was determined by placing specimens in a closed
system, evacuating the system to 107 torr at room temperature, and then

measuring the STP volume of carbon monoxide evolved from the graphite at
1800°¢.

Measurements of oxygen contamination were made on a sampling of this
material approximately nine months after the initial testing to determine
1f the oxygen contamination has remained within specification tolerance.
An initial measurement indicates an average of 5 cm® of CO (STP) per 100
cm® of graphite. This suggests that the oxygen content has not changed
appreciably; however, more samples from graphite for the core bars and
70

lattice are being tested to make reasonably certain what level of tenacious-
ly held oxygen can be expected in the MSRE graphite moderator.

Lattice Constants

 

Precursory measurements of lattice constants have been made on samples
from two bars of the MSRE graphite, grade CGB. X-ray diffraction indicated
these to be 2.464 A for a, and 6.T46 A for cg. The patterns indicated a
well-graphitized material with a small amount of amorphous material. The
lattice constants of the nonporous impregnating phase were found to be
2.466 A for a, and 6.7L0 A for cy. There were also indications that there
is some turbostatic structure present in this nonporous impregnating phase;
that is, there is an orderly arrangement of atoms in the layer planes, but
the planes have irregular azimuthal angles relative to each other. The
diffraction patterns for both the bulk graphite and the nonporous impreg-
nating phase were obtained on uncrushed material in order to minimize me-
chanical deformation of the lattice constants.

Reliable measurements of the lattice constants for the other micro-
scopically visible structural phase, the cellular-like impregnating phase,
have not been obtained because it has not been possible to get enough pure
sample of this material. Additional work will be necessary before typical
lattice constants can be assigned for the MSRE graphite.

otructural Integrity of Retainer Ring and Lattice Bars

 

The bars for the MSRE retainer ring and lattice bars were selected
and/or fabricated to have high structural integrity. A spare bar for the
retainer ring and six spare bars for the lattice bars have been received.
These were radiographed since they should be representative of the material
used.

The spare bar for the retainer ring was ummachined and was nominally
2-1/& in. square and 57 in. long. It was a good bar except for two very
tight cracks, 1-3/4 and 5-1/4 in. long.

The lattice bars were fabricated with higher permeability than the
core bars in order to secure more structural integrity. The six spare
lattice bars had been machined to 1- by l—5/8—in. Cross sections and were
57 in. long. Three bars had no radiographically visible cracks, and three
bars had tight cracks. One bar had a 7/8—in.-long crack; another bar had
two cracks (3/8 and 2 in. long); and the other cracked bar had three cracks
(3/8, 3/4, and 1-1/8 in. long). There were slight density variations in
the bars. The radiographs of gll six spare lattice bars had small low-
density spots in them that are probably voids partially or completely
filled with impregnants.

The overall radiographic examination of the spare bars indicates that
structurally perfect bars for the MSRE retainer ring and lattice bars were
not fabricated, but this goal was approached closely.

Thermal Conductivity of Grade CGB Graphite

 

A program has been initiated to determine the thermal conductivity of
grade CGB graphite. The radial heat flow apparatus is being used to measure
the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the extrusion direction on a
specimen with a bulk density of 1.82L4 g/cm3. The specimen for this appa-
ratus consists of a 9-in.-tall stack of 2-in.-0D, 3/8-in.-ID, l-in.-thick
disks. The radial temperature gradient 1is produced by a dc-heated, l/h—
in.-diam carbon rod located in the axial hole of the specimen. The speci-
men is enclosed in a 20-in.-long cylindrical muffle heater, and flat end
heaters are provided to eliminate axial heat flow within the specimen.
Temperature measurement and control are effected by Pt vs Pt - 10% Rh
Thermocouples with advanced commercial instrumentation. This apparatus
was previously used to determine the thermal conductivity of INOR-82 and
of U0> and Armco iron.®

The results obtained to date on the CGB specimen in the radial heat
flow apparatus are given in Table L.k.

where R 1s the thermal resistance in w'lcmoC. It should be stressed that

these results are considered tentative and are subject to change pending
the outcome of remeasurement of the radial positions of the thermocouple
wells after the experiment. The 1nitial measurements of these radii were
questionable because of the difficulty in determining the true radial
distance to the center of the B/M-in.—deep thermocouple wells. The final,
accurate measurements will be made by sectioning the two measuring plane
disks directly above the bottom of the thermocouple wells.

Radial Heat Flow Method.

In addition to the measurements in the radial heat flow apparatus,
measurements of the thermal conductivity of the same CGB graphite will be
made in a longitudinal comparative-type apparatus that is being developed.
This apparatus should be capable of determining the thermal conductivity
of small (l-in.-diam) cylindrical specimens over the range 30 to 100°C
with an anticipated precision of il% and a probable accuracy of i}%. The
system is currently being evaluated using a 1/4-in.-thick 1l-in.-diam Armco
iron specimen. If the above accuracy can be attained, the apparatus will
be used to measure the thermal conductivity of the 1.824 g/cm® CGB speci-
men and a CGB specimen of different density, both parallel and perpen-
dicular to the extrusion direction. The electrical conductivity of CGB
graphite will also be measured over the range 30 to 1400°C in both di-
rections.

If all these measurements are successful, it should be possible to
predict the thermal conductivity of this type of graphite of various densi-
ties over the temperature range 30 to 1000°C. 1In addition, a number of CGB
specimens have been irradiated, and tests are planned on these in the longi-
tudinal comparative-type device.

Effect of Irradiation on Grade CGB Graphite

 

Samples of graphite (grades CGB and AGOT) have been irradiated in the
B-8 core position of the ORR. This was done to obtain comparative data on
the effect of irradiation on dimensional stability, electrical resistance,
modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity. To
date all the measurements have been made except the thermal expansion,
thermal conductivity, and modulus measurements in the transverse direction
of grade CGB.
73

The specimens were lrradiated in a capsule in the ORR for one cycle.
The specimens were heated only by gamma heat; thus, the temperature was
not controlled but was monitored by thermocouples. The irradiation temper-
ature generally varied about *30°C from the temperatures reported. Nickel,
nickel covered with cadmium, and neptunium monitors were placed along the
length in all four corners. Figures 4.8 and 4.9 give the dimensional-change
results compared with other grades of graphite. 1In directions both paral-
lel to and normal to the extrusion axis, grade CGB demonstrates a greater
contraction than other grades of graphite. Without additional data at
greater exposures, it cannot be determined whether the increase is due to
a difference in the rate or in the zero intercept.

The change in electrical resistivity by irradiation saturates at a
relatively low dosage; thus, the results are plotted vs temperature in
Fig. 4.10. The lack of temperature dependence and the small change 1in
resistivity in the transverse direction are in general agreement with the
literature.’ The greater fractional change in resistivity of grade AGOTL
over CGB 1s compatible with the differences in dimensional changes. It
has been previously reported7 that graphites with greater crystallinity
experience greater changes in resistivity and are more dimensionally stable.

Modulus measurements were made from actual tensile tests of the ma-
terial. The gripping arrangement in tests on control specimens with strain
gages indicated alignment to be within the accuracy of the gages. The

grips, however, did not have adequate strength to break the stronger irradi-
ated specimen. Therefore, moduli measurements were all that could be ob-
tained from the tests. The irradiated material did not demonstrate the
nonlinear stress-strain behavior characteristic of the controls, but acted
more like a truly elastic material. The change in modulus, like resis-
tivity, saturates with low dosage; therefore, the moduli values are again
plotted vs temperature in Fig. 4.11. There is some scatter, but it appears
that the change in modulus is not affected by temperatures from 200 to
600°C. Since there is not a direct control for comparing the change in
modulus, the values have been averaged and ratios are given in Table L.5.

Manufacture of MSRE Control Rod Elements

 

A total of 160 MSRE control rod elements were manufactured by Westing-
house Atomic Fuel Department. The elements are gadolinium oxide - aluminum
oxide bushings clad with Inconel, as shown in Fig. 4.12. They are about
1-1/2 in. long with an ID slightly larger than 3/4 in. and a wall thick-
ness of about 3/8 in. Each element contains three 70% gadolinium oxide -
20% aluminum oxide bushings made by pressing and sintering prereacted
powder. The use of prereacted powder was developed at ORNL® to minimize
shrinkage during sintering due to a reaction between Al-05 and Gd»05.
Prototype bushings were made by pressing and sintering without prereacting;
but dimensional control required subsequent grinding, and the bushings were
found to react with water. Therefore, the production elements were made
using prereacted powders.

The manufacturing process for the bushing consisted in mixing the
Al504 and Gds05 powder and prereacting at 1700°F. The reaction products
were crushed, ball milled, sized, pressed into a bushing, and sintered at
1450°F. Each bushing was then given a thermal shock test by heating to
1400°F and quenching in water. After grinding, the bushings were visually
77

inspected for any chips or cracks. Bushings were rejected if they had

chips greater than 1/8 in. in dimension or greater than 1/52 in. in depth.
Each bushing was weighed and dimensionally inspected. Three bushings were
then selected for each control element in order to obtain proper stack height
and total weight of Gds03. The Gds05 content was computed from the weight

of the bushing and the content of Gds0s which was determined spectrographi-
cally for each batch.

The top closure was welded to the outer and inner walls by the auto-
matic tungsten-arc, inter-gas shield process (TIG). The bushings were
heated to 1500°F to drive off absorbed gases. This heat treatment was
found necessary because some of the first elements bulged owing to gas
pressure buildup during heating after canning. The bushings were then
loaded into the can, and the bottom closure was pressed on in a helium
atmosphere. The final two bottom closure welds were then made by the TIG
process. It was discovered that if the top welds were made last, the final
seal weld would blow out owing to the increased pressure inside the element
caused by the heat of welding. Possibly because of the difference in joint
design, bottom welds could be made last without weld blowout.

After a preliminary dimensional inspection, helium leak check, and
fluorescent penetrant inspection, the elements were heated to 1700°F in
alr in order to preoxidize the Inconel to prevent self-welding of the top
closure of one segment to the bottom closure of the next in the reactor.

The elements were numbered and dimensionally inspected using special "go
no-go" type gages.

The control elements were x rayed as part of receiving inspection.

This inspection showed that 51 of the bushings contained cracks that proba-
bly were formed during welding or preoxidation. Since it was previously
demonstrated® that cracked bushings would not affect the mechanical oper-
ation of the elements, they were accepted.

5. RADIATION CHEMISTRY OF THE MSRE SYSTEM

Experiment ORNL-MTR-47-3: Examination of INOR-8, Molybdenum,
and Pyrolytic-Carbon Specimens

 

 

In each of the four ORNL-MTR-47-3 capsules,® small specimens of
INOR-8, molybdenum metal, and pyrolytic carbon had been attached to the
central graphite blade by wires so that these specimens would be partially
submerged in the pool of fuel salt and partially exposed to the cover gas.
A detailled visual, petrographic, and metallographic examination of these
specimens has recently been completed. The metal specimens were visually
examined and photographed before and after removal of adhering fuel salt
in a boiling, saturated aqueous solution of ammonium oxalate. (Unwashed
halves of metal coupons from two capsules were preserved for metallographic
examination in case the oxalate treatment affected surface films; no effect
of the solution was noted.) The carbon specimens were merely brushed to
remove adherent salt. The cleaned samples were weighed, and their dimen-
sions were determined with a micrometer. Gamma spectra were obtained from
both the specimens and the oxalate wash solutions. Vertically cut cross
sections of the specimens were mounted in plastic, polished, and examined
metallographically.

Visually and photographically, the INOR-8 specimens appeared undamaged,
although brittleness was noted in the INOR-8 wires used to attach the
specimens to the graphite blades. The INOR-8 specimen from capsule 8
(high temperature and flux, fuel-impregnated graphite boat) showed the
largest weight and dimension changes; 1t lost 16 mg (or 6%) of its weight,
its length decreased by 2%, and its thickness decreased by approximately
10%. Metallographs confirmed a thickness decrease (approximately 1.5 mils,
or 7%, for all specimens) and further revealed apparently carburized layers
1 to 2 mils thick pocked with voids on both flat sides of the specimens
from capsule 16 (Fig. 5.1). The interior metal had a microstructure that
suggested carburization to a lesser extent. This metallographic informa-
tion from INOR-8 irradiated in close proximity to graphite is to be con-
trasted with that from the capsules of ORNL-MIR-47-4, where the INOR-8
was separated from the graphite core by an annulus of fuel salt. The
INOR-8 from ORNL-MTR-47-4 showed no void formation, carburization, or
other indication of damage. Differences in temperature between the two
experiments may also be partly responsible for the difference in the
behavior of the metal. In ORNL-MTR-47-3 the temperature in the vicinity
of the metal, salt, and graphite was estimated to have been about 800°C.°~
In ORNL-MIR-47-4 the temperatures of the metal- and graphite-salt inter-
fac%s,Brespectively, were estimated to have been about 600°C and 680 to
760°C.

Molybdenum specimens from capsules 3 and 8 appeared visibly much less
corroded than those from capsules 15 and 16, in which the submerged molyb-
denum edges were corroded to a knife-blade shape. (Capsules 15 and 16
were exposed to lower temperatures and flux but developed relatively high
CFs contents, with free fluorine as an inferred intermediate.) The sample

from capsule 15 lost 39 mg (or 15%) of its weight, 2% of its width, and
1/3 to 1/4 of its thickness. A photograph of the similarly corroded
specimen from capsule 16 is shown in Fig. 5.2. No films were visible,
upon metallographic examination, but large rounded corrosion pits, leaving
Jagged edges where they Joined, were observed, particularly on the salt
side. The thickness of the molybdenum specimens from capsule 16 (origi-
nally 20 mils) varied from 7.5 to 13 mils; this specimen showed evidence
of intergranular corrosion at the thin end. Specimens from the other two
capsules were of uniform thickness, within 10% of the original, but were
filmed (carbide or oxide?) on both sides. Since the specimen thicknesses
remained uniform while the layer thickness varied from 1/2 to 1 mil, the
surface layers may have been reaction products rather than deposited films.
Since molybdenum shows no evidence of corrosion in MSRE fuel melts out-
of-pile and the severely corroded 47-3 specimens were those from the
capsules which generated significant quantities of CF,, it is considered
likely that the corrosion in-pile resulted from radiolytic fluorine gen-
eration during reactor shutdowns in the course of the in-pile exposure.

Three of the carbon samples showed no abnormalities in the metallo-
graphs or in dimensions, except that of a thin, unidentified black film
on the specimen from capsule 16. The thickness of the sample from capsule
15, however, decreased 7 to 12 mils, and one spot of the metallographic
cross section showed a separation of several layers of pyrolytic carbon
at the surface. The rest (more than 95% of the section appeared normal
metallographically, with the usual incidence of cracks parallel to the
carbon layers. The observed damage in this carbon may be related to the
high yield of CF, 1n the cover gas from this capsule; however, the possi-
bility of mechanical damage during dismantling may not be excluded.

Photographs of all 47-3 specimens before and after cleaning are
available.%>° The metallography of INOR-8 sections from the 47-3 capsule
walls 1s in progress.

Gamma spectra of the molybdenum and carbon specimens showed ratios
of ruthenium activity to zirconium-niobium activity that were 2 orders of
magnitude higher than those for the oxalate wash solutions or bulk salt
samples. OStrong Co®Y activities in the INOR-8 samples masked other activ-
ities, but the ratio of ruthenium activity to zirconium-niobium activity
in their wash solutions was at least a factor of 10 greater than that for
bulk fuel salt. This plating of ruthenium on carbon and metal is in
accord with expected behavior for a noble metal in a reduced or only
slightly oxidized fuel melt.

Postirradiation Examination of Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4

 

Four of the irradiated capsules from experiment ORNIL-MTR-47-4 con-
tained, as has been described earlier,® l/2—in.—diam cylindrical cores
of graphite which were surrounded by 25 g of fuel (containing 1 g of
uranium) whose composition was LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (70-23.3-5-1-0.7
mole %) . The frozen fuel in these capsules had generated Fo gas sufficient
82

to produce pressures of several tens of atmospheres during the postirradi-
ation decay period. This assembly also contained two smaller capsules

of INCR-8 that contained 1/2-in. diam cylindrical crucibles of graphite
filled, to within about 1/4 in. of the top, with fuel. These two capsules,
because of differences in fuel composition and flux, differed by a factor
of 6 in power density. The higher-powered capsule produced fluorine in

a quantity sufficient to give about 30 atm of F, during the five-month
postirradiation period; the other capsule produced none.

Nonvolatile Constituents in Graphite

 

Large pieces of sample (0.8 g or more), for which the ratio of mass
to surface area originally exposed to the salt was similar to that for
the entire core of the MSRE, were analyzed chemically to produce the data
shown in Table 5.1. These data, some of which have been presented before,
show that of all constituents of the fuel, uranium, lithium, and molybdenum
were selectively concentrated in the graphite; analyses from capsule 36,
whose fuel was removed by melting, were not notably different from the
others. The mechanism by which deposition in the graphite occurred is not
known; but subsequent examinations, including metallography, agreed with
the chemical analyses that it was not by penetration as fuel. Tests by
chemical leaching and by metallographic examination showed that there was
no deposition of uranium in or on the metal (INOR-8) capsule walls.

Circular cross sections of the graphite cores were activated in the
ORNL Graphite Reactor at a flux of 5 x 10! neutrons em™° sec™! for & hr.
Contact autoradiography before and after the activation showed that the
uranium was in the outer rim, and gamma spectrometry provided a measure
of the amount present. The results by activation analyses are compared
with those by chemical analyses in Table 5.2. The chemical analyses
suggest a correlation of deposited uranium with power level (or perhaps
with the consequent rate of F, generation after irradiation). Analysis
by neutron activation, which should probably be preferred because of the
simplicity and directness of the technique, do not support such a corre-
lation. Both analyses, however, show the deposition to be substantial;
1T the graphite contains 1 mg of uranium per gram, it has taken up about
0.5% of all uranium in the capsule.

Contact autoradiography showed a high concentration of radiocactivity
from fission products (presumably mostly from daughters of gaseous prod-
ucts) to a depth of about 0.2 mm in the periphery of the graphite cross
sections. Neutron activation did not appreciably affect this radio-
activity; this indicated that the uranium was in the same region as the
fission products.

Autoradiography of specimens from the graphite of capsule 36 (from
which the Fjp-deficient fuel was removed by melting) also showed activity
concentrated in a thin layer on the outer surface of the graphite; however,
Tthe graphite from this capsule showed a faint, but definite, penetration
of activity halfway to the center. It seems unlikely that this additional
penetration, not observed in graphite from the other capsules, occurred

during high-temperature in-pile operation or as a consequence of reactor
shutdowns. A barely credible theory is that the large quantity of radio-
lytic fluorine produced after its removal from the reactor generated
substantial amounts of a fission product fluoride, which volatilized into
the graphite during the salt meltout procedure used only for capsule 36.

A closer resolution of the uranium distribution was obtained from
x radiography by a technique (recently developed in the ORNIL Metals and
Ceramics Division)’ in which the interference from fission product activity
is negligible. The main deposit of uranium penetrated the graphite to a
depth of less than 0.05 mm; however, there were also fringed prolifera-
tions that extended perhaps three times as deep. Facilities for attempted
identification by x-ray diffraction are nearing completion, but nothing
1s yet known of the chemical form of the uranium in the graphite.

1t seems clear that uranium is deposited in the outer layers of the
graphite but not on or in the metal wall and that uranium, lithium, molyb-
denum, and other metallic constituents of INOR-8 are deposited in the
graphite in preference to beryllium, zirconium and thorium. Mechanisns,
such as oxidation to UFg or reduction to UF3 and to uranium and formation
of UCz, for which the situations resulting from F, release might provide
appropriate conditions can be imagined. None of the mechanisms, however,
predict in detail the observed behavior, and they all appear less applicable
at high (reactor-operating) temperatures where no off-equilibrium behavior
has been demonstrated. Additional experiments are necessary to decide
85

whether these deposition phenomena can be a problem in the MSRE or are an
artifact of our present experimental procedures.

Metallographic Examination of the Graphite

 

The autoradiography and x radiography of the graphite cores mentioned
above were performed on specimens that had been mounted and polished for
metallographic observation. Under the metallographic microscope, there
were no signs of radiation damage, chemical alteration, penetration of salt,
nor even of the ~3 wt % concentration of uranium that apparently existed
in a 2-mil layer at the surface of the graphite. These results were the
same for the four graphite cores in the assembly, with the exception that
a shiny film, quite apparent to the eye, that had appeared on one of the
specimens was also clearly depicted on the surface of the graphite in the
metallographs of that particular core. This O.l-mil-thick film, which
almost certainly arose when this particular specimen was heated to 1000°¢
under vacuum to recover any residual xenon, was identifiable only as prob-
ably metallic from its metallographic appearance. However, the container
from the 1000°C bakeout was stainless steel; and in accord with recent
results® on the volatility of components from stainless steel, the film may
well have been volatilized manganese and chromium.

The single graphite specimen that showed structural damage was that
from the small crucible-type capsule which had generated a large amount of
radiolytic fluorine in the postirradiation period. Metallographs of the
upper lip of the crucible, which projected into the gas phase, showed a
spongy, severely corroded structure. No damage was discernible in the
graphite from the similar low-power capsule, which had generated no fluo-
rine. The one case of graphite damage observed in ORNL-MIR-47-4 is there-
fore ascribed to fluorine attack eilther during the postirradiation period
before gas sampling or during startups after reactor shutdowns in the course
of the in-pile operation.

Implications of Uranium Deposition for the MSRE

 

During normal high-temperature operation of the MSRE, the reduction of
the fuel to the extent required for uranium deposition on graphite is con-
sidered extremely improbable. However, precautions must be observed to
prevent the radiolysis and consequent reduction of the solid fuel; if the
fluoride deficiency of radiolyzed fuel is not replaced, deposition of ura-
nium on metal or graphite may be expected on remelting. In practice, the
problem is most simply solved by maintaining the temperature of a fuel
exposed to radiation above 200°C; the rate of back reaction of radiolytic
products 1s so rapid above this temperature that net radiolysis is negli-
gible even in a high radiation flux.

If a different mechanism (e.g., fission recoil) were operative to
yield uranium deposition proportional to neutron dose, the 47-4 results,
when extrapolated to the MSRE, give small cause for concern. After 10%
burnup the temperature of the graphite would be slightly raised, and the
rate of fuel addition might have to be slightly decreased to allow for the
extra uranium in the core (~1 kg).
86

Deposition of appreciable uranium on the graphite is likely to have
an adverse effect on the life of the graphite, the long-term performance,
and the acceptance of a large molten-salt power reactor. TFor these
reasons the uranium-deposition problem is receiving high priority in
planned examinations and in-pile tests.

Postirradiation Examination of Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-5

 

Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-5 contained, as described in previous reports
in this series,”’ *1 two capsules (3 and 4) equipped to sample the gas
phase above the salt during and after operation in-pile. The results,
which disclosed that small quantities of CF, but no fluorine were evolved
during the high-temperature operation of these capsules but that copious
quantities of F, were evolved from the fission-product-bearing salt at
temperatures below lOOOC, have been described. Behavior of these cap-
sules during the seven reactor shutdowns during irradiation, which has
not previously been reported in detail, is described in this report.
This assembly also contained four additicnal sealed capsules. Two of
these were designed to provide extremes in the ratio of graphite-to-
metal areas to which the fuel was exposed. Capsule 1 had a graphite
liner and a graphite core with a total salt-graphite interface area of
27 cm®; the liquid extended above the liner and flooded 7 cm?® of INOR-8
wall. Capsule 2 had only a small disk of graphite (1 cm?® of graphite-
fuel interface) and provided 46 em?® of metal-fuel interface. The other
two capsules were of smaller diameters. They each contained a mounted
graphite (AGOT) bar (3 g) that had been prepermeated with fuel; no
other fuel was added, so that these capsules, initially at least, exposed
no metallic surface to the salt. For the first five months following
the in-pile irradiation, the assembly could not be dismantled without
disturbing the investigation of Fy evolution from the capsules equipped
for sampling. The four sealed capsules in the assembly were punctured,
and the cover gas was analyzed as soon as the rate of F, evolution in
the swept capsules diminished to the point that it was difficult to
measure changes. After the capsules were punctured for sampling of the
gas phase, they were all opened for examination of the salt, graphite,
and metal.

Fluorine Evolution from Capsules 3 and 4 During Reactor Shutdowns

During each of the seven reactor shutdowns in the course of the in-
pile exposure of the ORNL-MIR-47-5 assembly, the pressure rises due to
radiolytic-fluorine generation were followed in capsules 3 and 4. The
results for the first shutdown have been discussed previously.ll The
pressure data for capsule 4 for all shutdowns, corrected to 32°C, are
shown in Fig. 5.3. The data are fragmentary for some shutdowns, during
which ORNL personnel were not in attendance at the MIR. The induction
periods, G values (molecules of F, evolved per 100 ev of decay energy
absorbed), power density before shutdown, and cumulative fluorine losses
by the salt are shown in Table 5.3 for both capsules.

Fig. 5.3. Pressure Rise in Capsule 4 During Reactor Shutdowns.

Behavior of the two capsules was clearly different from one shutdown
to the next. Induction periods longer than the reactor shutdown were some-
times observed, while in at least three cases no induction period was
observed. The G values varied, excluding the cases where no Fp was evolved
at all, from about 0.005 to 0.03; there seems to be one case (Fig. 5.3,
shutdown no. 4) where the G value changed appreciably during a shutdown.
This inherent variability must be considered when attempting to explain
differences in behavior of capsules with different geometries, power levels,
and radiation histories. This variable behavior suggests that some uncon-
trolled variable, perhaps differences in crystallite size or character, 1s
an important factor.

Analysis of Gas from Sealed Capsules

 

The 47-5 assembly was dismantled according to the procedure developed
for the 47-4 experiment, except that the sodium was melted out of the tank
as rapidly as possible (2 hr) and the temperature was not allowed to exceed
150°C, in an effort to minimize the back reaction of fluorine with reduced
salt and graphite at elevated temperatures. The gas samples were taken
into prefluorinated, evacuated nickel sample cans using the previously
described O-ring-sealed capsule punch and metal gas handling system. The
samples were analyzed by J. C. Horton of ORGDP with a prefluorinated spec-
trometer.

Analyses of the gas drawn from these four capsules are shown in Table
5.4 along with some details of the in-pile exposures. It is clear that the
three capsule geometries yielded very different quantities of F, and CF.;
capsule 2 yielded about 39 cm® of F, and 70 cm® of Cly; capsule 1 yielded
about 2.5 em® of Fy and 0.6 cm® of CFs; and the small capsules yilelded
neither gas. The notion that salt-metal interface area affects radiolytic
generation of F, from solid salt appears absurd. The possibility that
graphite surfaces somehow catalyze back reactions or otherwise slow the
generation process seems almost equally unlikely. It seems more plausible
to ascribe the pronounced difference in behavior to large differences in
cooling rates of the fuel and to consequent differences in crystallite size
and degree of stress introduced into the crystallites. The small capsules,
with the gas envelope around the fuel, cooled most slowly and, perhaps,
produced least readily damaged fuel. Capsule 2 clearly should have cooled
most rapidly.

The yields of krypton and xenon (Table 5.4) in capsules R and F were
uniformly less than those calculated from burnup. Although uncertainties
in the burnup calculations may be as high as 20%, it is thought that experi-
mental errors in mass analyses of low-concentration constituents account
for the larger discrepancies. In spite of these uncertainties, the contrast
is clear between the xenon yields of capsules R and F (46 and 81% of theo-

retical) and those of capsules 1 and 2 (<0.05 and 1.7% of theoretical);
normal xenon ylelds are apparently observed when the capsule gas contains

no fluorine, but low yields are obtained when the gas contains Fo or large
amounts of CFy.

Visual and Photographic Examination of Capsules

 

After the gas in the sealed capsules was sampled, all six of the 47-5
capsules were cut open. The four large capsules were opened by sawing a
ring around each capsule Jjust below the top weld and 1lifting out the
thermocouple well assembly. A vertical saw cut just through the capsule
wall was then made along the line of intersection of the capsule wall with
a blsecting vertical plane. The two capsule halves were pried apart,
exposing the contents.

The two smaller capsules were opened by a simpler procedure. The
bottom 1/4 in. of each capsule was cut off with a tubing cutter. The fuel-
impregnated AGOT graphite rod was then manipulated loose with a pair of
tweezers. The graphite specimen from capsule R was broken in the course
of loosening it; therefore more care was used with the specimen from capsule
F, and it was recovered intact.

The capsule components were examined visually and photographically
through a Kollmorgen periscope. oome of the more noteworthy observations
on each capsule are discussed below.

Capsule 1. Figures 5.4 to 5.6 show views of the outside of the graphite
crucible, the inner surface of the capsule, and the top of the graphite
crucible and central rod (magnified 1.5X). The outer surface of the
graphite appeared undamaged for the most part. A faint silvery film was
barely visible on most of the cylindrical surface and on the top flat sur-
face of the crucible. The top outer edge of the crucible appeared slightly
roughened and beveled; a ring of black material on the inner capsule wall
at this level suggested that a thin layer of graphite had torn away from
the crucible lip and stuck to the wall. Of particular interest is the fine
black film (obscured by cutting chips) above the salt liquid level on the
capsule wall. A carbon film of such appearance might be the product of CF,
radiolysis. Nearly half the area of the capsule wall adjacent to the cru-
cible was covered with a dark salt film, presumably volatilized salt that
had condensed in this cooler region.

Capsule 2. ©deveral views of the capsule, salt, INOR-8 inserts, and
graphite wafer are shown in Figs. 5.7 to 5.9. This capsule generated
copious quantities of Fp and CFy; after shutdown. On segmenting this capsule,
the graphite wafer was found to be cracked into two pieces. It appeared
rough on the edges and covered with adherent scale. A later weighing of

the two pieces showed that the weight of wafer had increased 46 mg. The
welght of carbon lost to the CF, found in the cover gas was 38 mg; the
original wafer weighed 536 mg. A slight radial bulging of the wafer is
perceptible in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8. It is expected that further tests will
confirm appreciable damage to the graphite wafer.

Silvery films were observed on the central metal inserts and on the
adjacent salt. One large and several small gas bubbles in the salt at the
bottom of the capsule are discernible in the photographs. The capsule wall
above the fuel looked dirty, with areas of adherent scale, small droplets,
and a fine black film in the upper regions.

The contact angle of salt on metal was 70 to 90° in the gas bubbles
and about 90° for the top surface. Just above the top meniscus of black
fuel salt, a floating cover of pale salt or scum with a much lower contact
angle was visible, particularly at the left side of the meniscus in Fig.
5.8. In this area, translucent blue, white, and gray beads of salt could
be observed above the fuel surface.

Capsule 3. 1In Figs. 5.10 to 5.13 are shown the more interesting
aspects of the capsule 3 components. The salt-metal interface was covered
with gas bubbles, a large one near the bottom reaching a diameter of about
1/4 in. and penetrating from the wall to the graphite. The contact angle
of salt on metal appeared to be near 90° and that on graphite somewhat
less. The metal wall was speckled with a design of greenish and white spots
corresponding to the bubbles; darker areas were adjacent to salt. ©Sone of
the white areas appeared to be slightly pitted. A silvery film was noted
on the top surface of the graphite specimen and on the outer surface of the
salt. In Fig. 5.13, a dark scale on the sides and bottom of the graphite
is distinguishable. The top outside edge of the graphite looked slightly
ragged, as 1f corroded.

Capsule 4. The condition of capsule 4 components is shown in Figs.
5.14 and 5.15. A relatively heavy, silvery film covered both graphite and
adjacent salt. In an area near the top of the graphite, the complete film
remained with the salt on cleaving open the capsule, leaving a roughened
graphite surface. OSeveral small gas bubbles in the salt at the bottom of
the capsule showed contact angles of near 90°. The contact angle of the
top surface could not be cl%arly observed because of a pale gray-green scum
but appeared to be about 50 . The capsule wall above the salt had the
usual appearance, with a fine black film near the top. A few droplets of
volatilized salt were visable.

Capsule R. Figures 5.16 and 5.17 show the droplets of salt which pre-
sumably volatilized out of the impregnated graphite rod. A dark coating
covered the interior wall of the capsule except where the droplets were
located. The contact angle of the salt against the metal surface was about
120°, distinctly nonwetting. The graphite rod retained its original ap-
pearance. A later weighing of the rod showed that it had lost 193 mg, or
30%, of the original fuel charge.

Capsule F. Figure 5.18 shows the capsule F components after segment-
ing. A few small droplets of salt and a dark crust, probably consisting
of very small droplets, were visible in the bottom end of the capsule.

The side walls were covered with a thin black film. The graphite rod was
not visibly damaged and had lost 228 mg, or 45%, of its original fuel
charge. Analyses of the salt droplets from capsules R and F are planned
to confirm the conjectured volatility mechanism by which they were formed.

Preliminary Examination of the Fuel

 

Small samples of fuel were chipped or filed from the ingots for survey
by gamma spectrometry and chemical microscopy. The samples were generally
selected from the outer surface in an effort to include unusual films and
deposits. Such a selection was not the best for providing well-crystallized
fuel phases for recognition under the microscope; and, accordingly, the
results were less informative than those from some of the previous examina-
tions.

Petrographically, LioBeF, was again found, but the color was described
as brown or olive-drab. A phase thought to be Li,ZrFg appeared to be pink-
yellow. The more strongly reduced fuel contained uncharacterizable phases
that were red, blue, and green-olive. Frequently encountered opaque material
probably came from the films. No uranium compounds were definitely recog-
nized, and a well-crystallized birefringent phase with a high index, found
in capsule 2, was not identified. Such results emphasized the need for
examination by x-ray diffraction.

The weighed samples will be studied in detail by gamma spectroscopy
techniques when the shielded instruments are available in the High Radia-
tion Level Examination Iaboratory. Preliminary checks showed that the
cerium-praseodymium activity accompanied that of the zirconium-niobium and
was only slightly less. In the samples from nonreduced fuel the ruthenium
98

activity was about one-tenth that of zirconium-niobium; these activities
were nearly equal in samples from reduced fuel, which indicates that
ruthenium might be a significant component in some of the films.

Neutron-Flux Determinations

 

Since cobalt dosimeter wires were omitted in the assembly of the 47-5
experiment, the upper INOR-8 lugs which supported the capsules were used as
dosimeters. The cobalt content of three lugs from identical blank capsules
was determined by neutron activation analysis to be 0.091 # 0.001% Co°°?.
The Co®® content of the six irradiated support lugs was measured, and the
average flux was calculated usin% a cross section of 37 barns for Co°? and
a halflife of 5.27 years for Co® The results are given in Table 5.5.

aThe flux in the center of the fuel region was taken as 80% of the flux
at the lug. The losses were 3.7% through the capsule wall, 13% through the
fuel annulus, and the remainder through the sodium bath.

bA 10% loss of flux was assumed, since the loss in fuel is much lower.

Plans for In-Pile Experiment ORNL-MTR-47-6

The sixth in the ORNL-MIR-47 series of irradiation experiments in
support of the MSRE i1s in construction, with irradiation in the MIR sched-
uled to begin in April or May of 1964. The main purposes of this experi-
ment are to learn whether CF, is generated from molten salt under irradiation
and to demonstrate that uranium does not deposit on graphite under molten-
salt reactor operating conditions.

Previous experiments in this series had shown the formation of free
fluorine and CF, in irradiated capsules containing fluoride salt fuelg.12-14
Subsequent experiments with purged capsules indicated that these gases
99

were released in significant amounts from cold frozen irradiated fuel only.
Tests indicated that an elevated temperature well below the liquidus temper-
ature of the fuel was sufficient to inhibit the generation of fluorine.
However, some questions arose concerning the generation of CF, from molten
fuel under irradiation since the radiolytic decomposition rate of CF, may
be high. In previous experiments, gas samples were taken from helium which
had been kept static within the capsule for one to several days to build

up a measurable concentration of CF, prior to sampling. If the radiolysis
of CF, were rapid, these samples would not have been representative of a
dynamic system, and the data would be subject to reinterpretation.

An additional problem that requires investigation was the presence of
deposited uranium (composition uncertain) in the surface of the graphite
specimens within some of the capsules. This deposit is believed to have
been a consequence of radiolysis during reactor shutdowns and incomplete
recombination with fuel during subsequent startups.

To answer the questions of CF, generation and radiolytic decomposition,
it is necessary that gas saaples be taken from the capsule cover gas by a
continuous purge at a relatively high flow rate (to 5000 cm?/hr) and that
any CF, be concentrated in a trap for later analysis.

In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of uranium deposition on
graphite, it will be necessary to avoid the generation of fluorine, which
is now known to occur when the irradiated fuel is allowed to freeze. To
this end, the capsule fuel will be maintained molten throughout the entire
irradiation test period, regardless of reactor power fluctuations or
shutdowns. In addition, either the capsule must be sectioned and the
graphite removed immediately following the irradiation, or it must be main-
tained at an elevated temperature (200°C or higher) until disassembly.
Avoidance of fluorine generation from frozen fuel will also be necessary
for an unbiased estimate of the effects of the molten fissioning fuel upon
molybdenum corrosion specimens which will be included in the test; the
presence of gaseous fluorine would surely cause substantial attack upon the
molybdenum, particularly at elevated temperatures.

Four capsules, two equipped for gas sampling, will be irradiated in
this experiment. These capsules, Fig. 5.19, will be mounted vertically in
a water-cooled plug designed for the MIR HB-3 beam hole. FEach capsule will
be equipped with a heater element to maintain the fuel molten during reactor
shutdowns. The heaters are in the form of hollow copper cylinders shrunk
over the capsules with electrical heaters embedded in the copper wall. The
capsules will be cooled during irradiation by individual water Jackets which
surround the copper heaters. An annular gas gap between the heater and the
water jacket will provide insulation to maintain the high fuel temperatures.
Instrumentation will consist of 1/16-in. sheathed thermocouples, one in a
central well in the capsule, four in holes near the inner wall of the heater,
and one in the inlet and outlet water lines of the water jackets. A con-
tinuous flow of a helium-nitrogen mixture will pass through the gas gap
between the heater and cooling Jjackets. The gas composition can be varied
to change the thermal conductivity as a means of temperature control. The
capsules are of INOR-8 (1 in. OD x 2.615 in. long) and will contain approx-
imately 25 g of fuel salt in which 1s submerged a l/2—in.-OD CGB graphite
core.

The two capsules without provisions for gas sampling will be identical
to the others except for the top configuration and the inclusion of three

molybdenum corrosion specimens (1/8 x 1 x 0.020 in. thick).

The specimens

will stand in equally spaced slots in the bottom plate so that the 1-in.
dimension is vertical and the l/8-in. dimension is oriented in a radial
direction with one edge against the outer INOR-8 wall.
101

A wide range of capsule temperature and power will be available by
varying the gas-gap purge composition by use of the capsule heaters and
by movement of the experiment assembly within the beam hole. The 13 in.
of travel available provides a variation in fission power density by a
factor of approximately 5. By this means and by choice of the fuel com-
position within individual capsules, power densities from 9 to 55 w/cm3

and temperatures from below the freezing point of the fuel to above 800°C
can be achieved.

The gas purge system and sample station are designed to detect the
release of CF; from fissioning fuel and, if measurable, to determine the
radiolytic decomposition rate of CF,. Each purged capsule is connected
to a once-through purge system which has a continuous range of flows from
50 to 5000 cm3/hr. To detect CF,; release, helium will be passed through
a capsule and then through a ligquid-nitrogen-cooled molecular sieve (which
will retain all gaseous components except helium) before it is discharged
to the MIR off-gas. After an adequate collection time (about 12 hr) the
purge will be stopped, the molecular sieve will be isolated and heated
to 300°C, and then the gases which were collected in the sieve will be
transferred to a small evacuated stainless steel sample bottle. The sample
will then be analyzed by mass spectrometry for CF, and other gases.
Provision is also included for the direct measurement of the radiolytic
decomposition rate of CIy by passing a known CF,-He mixture through one
side of a thermal conductivity cell, through the capsule, and then through
the second side of the thermal conductivity cell. A change in conductivity
will indicate the decomposition of CF,.

Gamma Irradiation of a Simulated MSRE Fuel Salt
in the Solid Phase

 

The discovery of fluorine gas in molten-salt capsules after irradiation
in the MIR'” has caused us to study the effects of radiation on the decom-
position of fluoride salts at low temperature. Part of the experimentation
designed to explore the generation and "recombination'" of fluorine gas
included the effects of gamma irradiation on such phenomena. A capsule
experiment using salt of a composition simulating the molten-salt reactor
fuel was designed. Operation of the experiment under gamma irradiation,
reported below, is described in greater detail elsewhere.®®

Experimental

 

Thirty-five grams of powdered fluoride salt (Table 5.6) of a composi-
tion and purity simulating MSRE fuel was placed in a 25-ml all-welded
INOR-8 autoclave.l? The all-welded autoclave, shown in Fig. 5.20, had
been prefluorinated at 95°C prior to the salt addition, and all loading
operations were carried out in a dry box under a helium atmosphere. The
solid salt was melted to cover 24 graphite spheres (Table 5.7) and left
a free space of about 7 ml in the autoclave at room temperature. There
was an additional 23 ml volume in external connecting lines, gages, valves,

etc. The autoclave was fitted with l/8—in. nickel tubes to provide access
for continuous monitoring of autoclave pressure and to permit removal of
gas from the autoclave for analysis. Four attached evacuated 50-cm’
INOR-8 tanks permitted withdrawal of the gas from the autoclave and its
replacement by helium flush gas.

The autoclave was irradiated in the Chemical Technology Division Cob9
facility from February 18, 1963, until December 23, 1963, receiving a
total exposure of 7391 hr, with a dose rate of 0.45 x 10°° ev hr-1 g-1.
The test was begun with pure helium in the gas space over the solid salt.
The gas pressure was then monitored for any subsequent change in pressure,
which indicates the generation of F, gas and any subsequent recombination.
For the initial 600 hr at ambient temperature (~60°C), there was no sig-
nificant change in pressure. During the next 1271 hr, the pressure
increased. Mass spectrographic analysis showed that a sample taken at
this time (Table 5.8) contained an appreciable amount of fluorine gas and
small amounts of CF,, COIy, SiF,, COs, and oxygen. Calculations based on

Tthe gas yield and observed pressure rise and dose rate indicated that after
the initial induction period, gas was generated at an average Gp_ of 0.035
molecule of Iy per 100 ev. After irradiation at various tempera%ures up

to llOoC, 8 second sample was taken. Results from this sample confirmed
the first.

After further buildup of pressure during irradiation at llOOC, the
temperature was increased to 15000, resulting in a steady pressure decline
until the original (helium) pressure was reached. The third sample was
withdrawvn (hour 4412), and the autoclave was purged. The sample contained
essentially pure helium (~100 ppm Fy, no CF,, etc.). Further experiments
were then conducted at temperatures between 110 and 150°C in the presence
and absence of the source in order to examine generation and recambination
effects, and a final sample was taken.

Discussion

 

1t was evident from the observations that essentially pure Fo gas was
produced by the gamma irradiation of solid simulated MSRE fuel salt in the
presence of graphite. In the absence of irradiation or at suitable temper-
atures, even in the presence of irradiation, the gas disappeared at a
measurable rate, presumably recombining with the salt.

The generation of Fp appeared to require a substantial induction
period, originally and after complete (sample 3, 150°C) recombination.
Similar induction periods and some production of Fo- have been reported,
in the case of neutron-irradiated IiF, as summarized by Billington and
Crawford.1®
105

In our experiment the threshold appeared at a specific dose of 2.7 x
1022 ev absorbed per gram. This is somewhat more than an order of magnitude
less energy than appeared to be the threshold for various effects in the
neutron irradiation experiments cited above.l®

The generation of F, appeared to reach a steady-state rate of about
6+ psi per 1000 hr, corresponding to a Ggp_ of 0.05 molecule of F, per 100
ev absorbed (0.03 to 0.07). Such values &F Gp, are consistent with the
previous in-pile capsule experiments.l5 At temperatures below llOOC,
the rate appeared to increase somewhat with temperature, but data are
inadequate for a firm conclusion.

The gas recombined completely at 150°C and appeared roughly to balance
production and recombination at 130°C. Increases in temperature from
110 to 130°C and from 130 to 150°C in the absence of irradiation each
appeared to increase the recombination rate about threefold. No influence
of pressure on this recombination was convincingly demonstrated though
rates were perhaps lower at the lower partial pressures of F,. Until the
autoclave is opened and the contents are examined, no conclusions can be
drawn as to the possibly important effects of the physical condition
(cracks, crystal size, etc.) and geometry of the salt cake on the rates
of Fo generation and recombination.

No reaction of Fp with graphite was evident. The traces of CO,, CF,,
and COFp could come from traces of organics or from CO, picked up in
handling the sample. There was sufficient oxygen in the original salt to
account for the observed excess oxygen.

Fluorine Evolution from Solid Fluoride Salts Under
lrradiation by Van de Graaff Electrons

 

 

Investigations of fluorine evolution from solid, MSRE-fuel-type salt
under fast-electron bombardment were continued to establish whether irra-
diation of the solid salt results in evolution of enough fluorine to explain
The amounts found in capsules after tests in-pile and to evaluate GFz as
a function of irradiation dose and dose rate. Lithium fluoride was also
tested for fluorine evolution under fast-electron bombardment.

Experimental

 

The equipment, method, and procedures for this investigation were
essentially the same as those described previously.l9 In brief, a salt
sample was exposed to Van de Graaff electrons in a series of exposures
lasting a few hours (mostly 1 to 2) until the desired total dose in the
salt was accumulated. The fluorine generation during each exposure was
evaluated from measurements of the amounts of fluorine within the irra-
diation cell before and after an exposure and from the results of control
experiments. Some of the conditions employed in experiments are summa-
rized in Table 5.9.

Fig. 5.21. Corrected Rate of Fluorine Formation per 1.09 ua-hr
Electron Irradiation.

Out-of-pile controls indicated that the loss of fluorine during a
radiation exposure averaged 70, 51, and 18 ug in experiments 9, 4, and
5a respectively. Coatrol experiments in which the cell without salt was
irradiated showed that fluorine was released at a low rate during exposure.
Corrections deduced from the results of the control experiments have been
applied to the results shown in Figs. 5.21 and 5.22 to obtain more accurate
values for fluorine evolution. The G corresponding to a rate of 200 ug
per 1.09 pa-hr is 0.016. That for anyzother point may be found from this
relation. The maximum GFz observed was 0.02.

No steady-state evolution rate occurred in experiment 9. With
increasing dose and at the constant initial dose rate, the evolution rate
increased initially, passed through a maximum, and then decreased signif-
icantly. At the subsequent higher dose rate, the evolution rates passed
through a minimum and then through a second maximum. The initial evolu-
tion rates were significantly greater than those observed in the previous

DOSE IN SALT (Mev/g)

Fig. 5.22. Total Fluorine Evolved During Electron Irradiations.

experiments in which the salt was exposed at higher dose rates (approxi-
mately 1.8 times higher).

No fluorine evolution was detected in two experiments with ILiF in
which the total doses were 1.4 and 2.6 (x 101%) Mev/g and the dose rates
were 8.6 x 10%°® and 1.6 x 107 Mev hr-! g~!. In fact, a slow rate of
uptake on the LiF was indicated by the corrected results. This uptake
amounted to 4 to 6 ug per 8.3 x 101° Mév/g in one experiment and 10 to
20 pg per 8.3 x 1016 Mev/g near the end of the other, lower dose-rate,
experiment.

Discussion

 

The differences between the initial rates of fluorine evolution in
experiment 9 and those in the previous, higher intensity experiments 4
and 5a are considered significant and evidence that, up to a dose of 4
to 5 (x 1017) Mév/g, the GF values increase with decreasing dose rate
within the dose rate range %nvestigated. As previously suggested,lg the
results of the final two exposures in experiment 4 indicate a similar
effect. The effect of dose rate on Gp, at doses above about 5 to 6
(x 1017) Mev/g cannot be evaluated from the data.
109

The changes in evolution rate with increasing dose observed in experi-
ment 9 have led to a reconsideration of the data for experiment 5a. It
was previously believed!® that the evolubtion rate had reached an approxi-
mate steady-state value before the experiment was terminated. It now
seems likely that further changes in the rates would have occurred in
both experiments 5a and 4 if the radiation exposures had been continued.

Although Gn_ values found in this work are in the neighborhood of
those found by oThers in in-pile capsule experiments,zo they are signif-
lcantly lower than some of the reported values. They are also less than
some of those found by Compere and co-workers®l in the exposure of MSRE-
type salt to cobalt gamma rays, but about the same as the maximum
values reported by Rainey and co-workers<? for X-ray 1lrradiation of the
salt. The dose rates and doses in these different type experiments
differed appreciably from the initial ones; and, in view of the results
of the Van de Graaff experiments, it is considered likely that the dif-
ference between reported yields resulted, in part at least, from these
differences in dose rate and doses. The initial dose rate in experiment
9 was about 4 x 101 Mev g1 hr~t, while those in the gamma ray<! and
x-ray<? work were about 4.5 x 10%2 and & x 10%2. The maximum doses in
the latter experiments were about 3 x 1017 and 7 x 1017 Mev/g. The
intensities in the capsules in-pile varied from one capsule to another
and, within a given capsule, with cooling time. By use of the experi-
ment labeled 65 w/cm3 in Fig. 5.3, Ref. 20, for comparison and example,
it can be estimated from the data given in the figure that the intensities
in the salt in this capsule were about 8 x 101%, 5 x 101%, and 4 x 1014
Mev gt hr-% after 11.4, 23.4, and 38.4 days of cooling. It can also be
estimated that the doses at the same times were about 4 x 107, 6 x 1017,
and 7 x 1017 Mev/g. The reported Gp, values were as high as 0.07 in the
cobalt irradiation.?l For the capsule in-pile at temperatures of 30 to
36°C, they were about 0.04 from about 11 to 40 days but were below 0.04
at the later times.=<0

In general, the results of the electron irradiations of MSRE salt
appear consistent with the kinetic picture of salt radiolysis suggested
by Blankenship and co-workers.<° However, the results of the present
work suggest that the rates of their proposed diffusion and recombination
steps are probably dependent upon radiation intensity. The occurrence
of a maximum in the evolution rate curve of experiment 9 is an additional
indication that back reaction with defects (produced by the loss of
fluorine) in the MSRE fuel is an important factor in limiting the amount
of fluorine evolved. The concentration of these defects must increase
as fluorine is evolved so that a leveling off of the amounts of evolved
fluorine would be expected if back reaction is important. In addition,
or alternatively, the increase in crystallite size which has been
reportedl9 for some Van de Graaff samples may also be important in reducing
the rate of fluorine production and/or diffusion to the surface.

The increase in fluorine-evolution rates which occurred after a dose
of about 108 Mev/g suggests that some marked change occurred in the salt
in this dose range. The nature of the change is unknown.
110

Experiments are continuing to elucidate the factors involved in the
evolution of fluorine from fuel salt.

Little can be said about the absence of fluorine evolution from LiF
under irradiation in this work except to note that this finding agrees
with the x-ray irradiation result of Rainey and co-workers<? and confirms
their suggestion that fluorine evolution under irradiation differs markedly
for different salts. The mechanism by which fluorine was taken up by the
salt during irradiation in unknown.

Effect of Soft X Rays on Solid Fluorides

 

The study of the liberation of fluorine from metal fluorides during
exposure to X rays has been continued. Preliminary work on an MSRE fuel-
type salt was reported previously.22

The fuel salt used in these experiments consisted of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-
ThF,-UF, (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) . Table 5.10 summarizes the results of
irradiations performed to date.

The test salt was found to contain a wide range of particle sizes.
A fine fraction (<0.002 in. diam) of the fuel salt was irradiated to a
dose of 1.4 x 10%° Mév/g without evidence of decomposition. The salt was
fluorinated at about 85°C and reirradiated. Volatile fluorine compound s
were liberated with a G value of 0.02. A coarse fraction (0.023 to 0.033
in. diam) of the same salt, after a similar fluorination, liberated
products with a G value of 0.002.

As further indicated in Table 5.10, other irradiations have been con-
cerned primarily with the simpler component fluorides of the fuel salt.
Thorium fluoride, which had been prefluorinated to exhaustion at 160°C,
liberated fluorine as well as other volatile products with a G value of
about 0.005. Under similar conditions, zirconium fluoride showed no
evidence of radiolysis. Lithium fluoride, difficult to irradiate to a
high total dose because of its low mass absorption coefficient, did not
generate any volatile fluorine products. After fluorination at 16000,
the MSRE solvent salt, 6LiF:BeF,.ZrF,, liberated CF, and COF, with G
values of about 0.02.

Results to date indicate that x-ray irradiation is a useful source
of energy for the study of radiolysis of metal fluorides and that the
composition of the salt is an important parameter. It may be concluded,
at least qualitatively, that the rate of fluorine liberation is a function
of particle size or surface area and that the presence of impurities
which are easily fluorinated inhibits the liberation of fluorine.

Other parameters which are included in the continuing studies are
crystallite size, temperature, dose rate, x-ray energy, and impurity
content.

Phase Equilibrium and Solubility Studies Among Fluorides

 

The System LiF-BelF,-Zrk,

 

Knowledge of this important system, the solvent base of the MSRE
fuel, has been greatly extended by application of visual methods for
obtaining liquid-solid transition data. Determination of the phase dia-
gram of the system (Fig. 6.1) is now nearing completion. Invariant
equilibria, insofar as they are known, are listed in Table 6.1. The new

data were obtained preponderantly in the subsystem BeF,-ZrF,-2LiF-ZrF,.
Equilibria in this composition region proved to be most difficult to
determine quantitatively, since (1) it is very difficult to remove minor
amounts of contaminant oxides from viscous BeF,; melts, and (2) crystalline
Bel's is often nucleated very slowly from mixtures in which it is the
principal component. For these reasons, equilibria are least well esta-
blished in the BelF, apex of this system. The ORNL liquidus data in this
composition area, as well as those obtained for corresponding compositions
in the recently completed investigation of the system NaF—Bng-ThF4,l
those reported for the system NaF-BeF, by Roy, Roy, and Osborn,2 and those
reported for the system LiF-BeF,-UF, by Eichelberger et al.,> are in
disagreement with the conclusions of Novoselova and co-workers.%
Novoselova contended that in the system NaF-BeF,, BeF, crystallizes as

the equilibrium primary phase according to curve A and as a metastable
phase according to curve B of Fig. 6.2. Novoselova inferred this behavior
from heating and cooling curves and not from direct observation of crys-
talline BeF, in these samples. She also reported earlier”® that quartzlike

BelFo> begins to melt at 54500, but melts only partially, and that complete
fusion was not observed at temperatures below 800°C. She noted that
quartzlike BeF, could be melted below 580°C but would resolidify on
further heating. No mention of atmosphere control at high temperatures
is made in the Russian reports. Although ammonium fluoroberyllate was
used in the preparation of the materials, the phenomena described appear
to be related to the presence of an oxide impurity. Commercial BeFs
frequently contains approximately 1% water, which is difficult to remove
by usual methods; the solubility of BeO in melts at elevated temperatures
is low (approx1mately 1000 ppm at 600°C). It appears, therefore, that
the Russian workers may have observed crystallization behavior involving
contaminant oxides rather than pure fluorides along curve A. Determinations
of the melting point of BelF, have been made at this laboratory by several
means: (1) by thermal gradient quenching of the pure materials,® (2) by
extrapolation of BalF,-Bel's liquidus points obtained from gquenching data,7
116

and (3) by direct observation of the melting-freezing behavior under
helium atmospheres containing less than 100 ppm H»O. In the two former
experiments, the melting point was determined to be 548°C. In the latter
experiments, the material began to soften at approximately 55OOC, melted
to a clear, viscous fluid which remained clear and transparent to temper-
atures as high as lOOOOC, and retained its clear glassy appearance during
subsequent cooling to room temperature. We have concluded from these
experiments that the equilibrium melting point of BeF, is 548°C and that
observations of higher melting transitions are related to impurities in
the salt.

A strange phenomenon was observed in mixtures of BeF,-ZrF, and in
mixtures of LiF-BeF,-ZrF, containing less than 15 mole % IiF at tempera-
tures as much as 200°C above the liquidus. Globules coalesced on the
bottoms of vessels containing these mixtures; as the temperature was
increased, the globules gradually enlarged and rose to the surface of the
liquid as gas bubbles (presumably as a vapor rich in ZrF,). The assump-
tion that the globules were vapor pockets at all times is unsatisfactory
because the quenched melts appear to contain two kinds of glassy particles,
as though two immiscible liquids were preserved by the rapid-freezing
process. The appearance of spheroidal and devitrified glass led to the
inference that, at equilibrium, certain liquid mixtures of IiF-BeF,-7ZrF,
and Bel'o-Zrl,; were comprised of two immiscible liquids.8 The new data
on the coalescence of globules and the appearance of gas bubbles cause
this Inference to be doubtful, although they do not preclude its validity.

Crystallization of the MSRE Fuel

 

The crystallization behavior of MSRE fuel and other fluoride melts
has been under study for some time. Previous reportsg’lo have indicated
the behavior of melts containing ThF,, and preliminary studies of the
present MSR fuel composition have been reported.ll A more detailed study
of crystallization reactions has now been made of mixtures whose composi-
tions approximate those of the MSRE fuel. The results of petrographic
examinations of the equilibrium phases in an equilibrated mixture containing
1 mole % UF,; but otherwise corresponding to the proposed MSRE fuel, LiF-
BeF,-ZrF,-UF, (65-29.1-5-0.9 mole %), show the following crystalllzatlon
sequence. On cooling the liguid mixture to +34°C crystalline 2LiF-Bef's
15 formed This phase continues to precipitate on further cooling, and

431° C, 2LiF-ZrF,; begins to crystallize; the onset of crystallization
by the tertlary phase, 7ILiF:6UF,;, begins at 416°C. The liquid portion
of the mixture decreases but is present down to temperatures as low as
~350°C. When completely frozen, the fuel at equilibrium should be com-
posed of crystalline 2LiF-BeF,, 2LiF-Zr¥F,, 7LiF-6UF,, and BeF, in volume
fractions 0.735, 0.204, 0.032, and 0.029 respectively. The usual cooling
paths for LiF-BeF,-7rF,-UF, mixtures of compositions similar to the MSRE
fuel involve a glassing of the BeFs-rich liquids that are low melting and
thus the last to freeze. Hence, crystals of pure BeF, are generally not
expected; rather, the last liquid solidifies as glass which incorporates
variable amounts of the phases listed above with BeF,.

Solubility of Uranium Trifluoride in a Reduced MSRE Fuel-Salt Mixture

 

Low concentrations of UF3 may exist in the MSRE fuel salt as a con-
sequence of the chemical equilibrium established during the corrosion of
the INOR-8 surfacel? and/or the depletion of the fluorine concentration
of the melt by a radiolytic process. 13 As a part of continuing studies
of the chemical behavior of UFz as molten fluoride mixtures, measurements
of the solubility of UF3, in the MSRE fuel salt mixture have been made.

Trivalent uranium was prepared in situ by the addition of zirconium
metal turnings to fluoride mixtures Eahtaining UF',. An approximately
50% excess of zirconium over the amount required for stoichiometric reduc-
tion of all UF,; to UF; was used. The presence of UF3 as a primary phase
in cooled samples of these melts was established by petrographic observa-
tions and by x-ray-diffraction data.

Values for the solubility of UF3 in the fluoride mixtures were
obtained by chemical analyses of filtered salt samples withdrawn from
the melt at selected temperatures. Analyses for trivalent uranium were
made by an indirect hydrogen-evolution method that did not necessarily
distinguish trivalent uranium from other reducing agents (but no others
should have been present), and analyses for total dissolved uranium in
the salt samples were made by a well-established analytical method. For
these highly reduced melts, values of total uranium represent maximum
values for trivalent uranium concentrations.
118

The results of UF3 solubility determinations in the mixture LiF-BeF,-
ZrF,-ThF,-UF,; (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) over the temperature range 550 to 700°C
have been reported.l4 This fluoride mixture composition was previously
proposed as the MSRE fuel and was used in the in-pile test program.lt2s16
The UF3 solubilities ranged from about 0.1 to 0.7 mole % at 550 and 700°C
respectively. The heat of solution, calculated from a semilogarithmic
plot of solubility vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature, was
21.6 kcal/mole.

Values for the solubility of UFs3; in the currently proposed MSRE fuel
mixture, LiF-BeFo-ZrF,-UF,; (65.0-29.17-5.0-0.83 mole %), have now been
obtained and are shown in Fig. 6.3. The reported values of the U°T con-
centrations at the higher temperatures very nearly correspond to values

a Reduced MSRE Fuel Salt Mixture.

of the total uranium concentrations; the cause of the poorer agreement

at the lower temperatures is not understood. The presence of graphite

in the reduced MSRE fuel mixture was found to have no effect on the UlF;j
solubility. For this test a cleaned graphite cylinder was submerged in
the "reduced" fuel mixture, and filtered salt samples were again with-
drawn for chemical analyses. Values for the concentrations of total
dissolved uranium were in good agreement with those obtained prior to

the graphite insertion. The values for U+ agaln appeared to deviate
from those for the total uranium concentrations at the lower temperatures.

Although the values for the total uranium concentrations in the MSORE
fuel mixture have been assumed To represent maximum values for Ul solu-
bility, they are, nevertheless, considerably lower than those predicted
by analogy with rare-earth and plutonium solubilities in LiF-BeF, mixtures.
Whereas the apparent solubility of UFs; in the MSRE fuel mixture at 600°C
is 0.22 mole %, the solubility of PuFs in IiF-BeF, (63-37 mole % at
600°C was reported®’ as 0.43 mole % The solubility of CeFs; in the same
solvent was reportedl8 as 0.55 mole %. The effect of the solvent composi-
tion on Pul's3 solubility was shown to be large in LiF-Bel', and NaF-Bel's
melts.t? Studies in progress should reveal the effects of solvent com-
position on the solubility of UFsj.

otablility of Uranium Trifluoride in Molten Fluoride Solvents

 

Quantitative information on the disproportionation reaction
4LUF5 = 3UF, + UY

for UF3; both 1n the pure state and in a molten fluoride solution is at
present scanty and conflicting. For instance, estimates of the difference
in the free energies of formation of UF3 and UF,; vary from 76 to 92 kcal/
mole, corresponding to a variation by a factor of 101% in the calculated
value of the equilibrium constant of the above reaction at 1000°K. An
investigation of the relative stabilities of UF; and UF, in fluoride
solutions is therefore being directed toward obtaining values of the
equilibrium quotient for the disproportionation reaction as a function

of temperature and solvent composition.

Experimentally, the disproportionation quotient is more conveniently
derived from measurements of the equilibrium quotient (Q) for the reaction

in a given solvent results in values for Q at 800°C of about 10=% a+m2 in

[iF-BeF, (70-30 mole %) and about 10-2 atm? in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %)
solvents. At low UF3 concentrations (x3 < x,) with 1 atm of hydrogen,
the equilibrium concentration of HF in these systems at 800°C should be
in excess of 10™% atm (100 ppm) .

bouipment has been built in which a UF,-containing melt can be
purged with hydrogen and the concentration of HF in the effluent stream
determined with a lower limit of ~20 ppm. In order to approach the equil-
librium point from both directions, provision is made for introducing
HE' into the hydrogen purge stream.

Two series of experiments have been carried out over the temperature
range 670 to 810°C to establish the equilibrium data for pure UF, using
(1) vacuum-distilled UF, converted in situ to 5% UFs and (2) an intimate
mixture of UF,; and UFs (28-72 mole %) . Both samples gave Q values differ-
ing by less than 20% over the temperature range studied, but the detailed
interpretation of the data is complicated by the ability of UFs3 to take
UFy into solid solution. Nevertheless, from the equilibrium data and the
free energy of formation of HF (65.8 kcal/mole) the difference in the free
energies of formation is found to be FUF3 - FUF4 = +80 + 1 kcal/mole at
1000°K.

Crystal Structure of 6LiF-BeF,.ZrF,

 

Crystals of the stoichiometric compound olilg Bel o+ ZrF, appear as a
primary phase in solidified MSRE fuel solvent.'? The structure of this
ternary compound may be useful in the explanation of radiation damage and
postirradiation behavior of MSRE fuel and in understanding the solubility
relations in fluoride-fuel systems. For these reasons, and because the
stereochemistry of metal ions displaying eightfold coordination is cur-
rently of interest,ZO a, complete crystal-structure analysis of 6LiF:BeFs-
Zr¥, was undertaken.

This substance is tetragonal, having a centrosymmetric unit cell of
dimensions ay = 6.57 A, co = 18.62 A; the space group is T4y /amd - Diﬁ.
There are four formula weights per unit cell.

Partial three-dimensional photographic x-ray intensity data were
collected. The structure was solved by the heavy atom technique with
the alid of Patterson, electron density, and difference syntheses projected
down [010]; the atomic parameters were refined by least-squares adjustment.

Coordinates and thermal parameters of the ions are shown in Table 6.2
and the contents of one unit cell are illustrated in Fig. 6.4. In this
figure, ions in the immediate enviromment of one zirconiium ion and of one
beryllium ion are shaded in order to accentuate significant features of
the coordination of these metal ions.

Fig. 6.4+ Perspective Drawing of the Structure
of LigBelF,ZrFg.
123

Both the Be®' and Zr*' ions have discrete coordination polyhedra.
The beryllium ion is surrounded by four equidistant fluoride ions at
1.57 A, forming a nearly regular tetrahedron. In this respect the beryl-
lium coordination is similar to that in LigBeF4,2l another primary phase
in the LiF-BeF,-ZrF, system. About the zirconium ion there are four
fluoride ions at 2.07 A and four at 2.16 A arranged as two interpenetrating
tetrahedra with a common center; these eight fluoride ions form an irreg-
ular dodecahedron. This type of eightfold coordination is common for
early transition-metal ions,ZO including that of the zirconium ion in
K27rFe.“? The other eight-coordination polyhedron frequently observed
is the square antiprism exhibited by ZrF, itself.=3

Lithium ions in 6LiF-BeF,:ZrF, satisfy electroneutrality and serve
to connect the polyhedral ions described above but do not appear to have
additional important stereochemical significance. Thus the formula
should be written LigBeF,ZrFg.

The structure is not closely packed; the possible significance of
the free spaces i1s under continuing study.

Core and Blanket Fluids for Future Reactors

 

Studies leading to the specification of core and blanket salt com-
positions for molten-salt fast-breeder reactors have previously been
reported.24:25 Interest in this type of reactor has also been manifest
in eastern EurOpe.26 The ORNL studies have been continued with emphasis
on fuels based on uranium trichloride.

Chlorides as Fast Reactor Fuels

 

Uranium tetrachloride should be quite soluble in any of several
chloride solvents at temperatures markedly below 500°C. Nevertheless,
this solute is considerably less stable with respect to reduction to the
trichloride than is UF, with respect to UFs; and, consequently, UCl,
should be a strong oxidant and an aggressive corrosion agent.24 Uranium
trichloride, in contrast, promises, from the available thermodynamic data,
to be much less agressive. Newton,27 for example, has calculated that UCls
should be stable in contact with metals as active as iron. While the case’
is likely to be somewhat less favorable in practice, it seems likely that
UCls (and PuCls) must be the ma jor fissionable metal compounds in such
fuels. Unfortunately, their phase behavior is likely to prove less suit-
able than that of the tetrachlorides.

Relatively little is known of phase behavior in chloride systems from
which suitable fuels may be chosen. Some information concerning binary
systems of UCls and PuCls; has been reported by Barton?® of ORNL and by
Leary29 and his associates at the Los Alamos Scientific Iaboratory. From
Tthese relatively simple binary systems, the behavior of relatively simple
ternary systems was estimated.’® It seems likely that sufficient solu-
bility of the chlorides can be obtained at 550°C in solvents such as
124

NaCl-KC1l or NaCl-MgCl,. A diagram predicted for NaCl-KC1-PuCls from the
known limiting binary systems is shown as Fig. 6.5 as an example of
behavior to be expected.

A study of phase equilibria in systems with UCls; as a component has
been started. Initial attention has been focused on the KC1-UCls binary.
Most of the effort to date has been expended on methods of preparing
pure oxide-free UCL3-KCl mixtures. After a survey31 of methods for pre-
paring uranium chlorides, hydrochlorination of uranium metal was tested.
Considerable difficulty was encountered, both in keeping the system free
from water and in obtaining consistent analytical results. An attempt
to produce UClz in the presence of molten KC1l did not yield the expected
molten mixture of UCl3-KCl; analytical results indicated that nearly 90%
of the uranium was in the tetravalent state. Reduction of UCl, in molten
KCl by means of hydrogen, however, appeared to give a 65 to 90% reduction

stability of UCls toward oxidation or disproportionation in molten alkali
chlorides with the corresponding tendencies in the pure state.

Fluoride Salts for Use as Blanket Fluids: The System NaF-KF-ThF,

 

In contrast with the requirement that moderator materials be absent
from the core, a static molten blanket for use in a molten-salt fast-
breeder reactor could be composed of fluoride salts. It should exist
as a homogeneous fluid at temperatures of 550 to 600°C. In continuing
investigations of the system NaF-KF-ThF,, it was discovered that this
criterion is met by several ternary mixtures containing 60 to 70 mole %
NaF and 20 to 28 mole % ThF,. A thorough investigation of this important

portion of the system is now under way. The results of the current inves-
tigation are shown in Fig. 6.6. The lowest-melting eutectic is located

at a composition of about 68 mole % NaF, 6 mole % KF, and 26 mole % ThEF,
and melts at about 562°C. A salt mixture of this composition contains

65 to 70 wt % ThF,;, has a density of 4.6 g/cmB, and at temperatures above
the liquidus contains about 2400 g of thorium per liter. As in the
analogous system, NaF-KF-UF4,32 a l:1:1 ternary compound markedly influ-
ences phase behavior in the low melting region of the system.

The ternary compound NaF:KF-:ThF, melts incongruently at about 713°C
to 7(NaF-KF¥) *6ThF,; and liquid. The large primary phase field of the
Ternary compound relative to that of 2NaF-ThF, is probably due to the fact
that a large fraction of the K* ions (radius, 1.33 A) in NaF-KF-ThF, can
be replaced by the smaller Na™ ions (radius, 0.98 A), while for 2NaF-ThF,
the converse is not possible. Although 7NaF-2ThF, does not appear as a
primary phase in the binary NaF-ThF, system, it has a relatively large
primary phase field in the ternary system because it forms a very exten-
sive, 1f not complete, solid solution with the compound 7KF-2ThF, .

FPhase Separation of Molten Halides and ILead

 

Application of direct heat transfer between molten salts and lead
would be advantageous in many respects, but the process requires a good
separation of the liquid phases after intimate contact. The ease of this
separation will depend on the tendency of the liquids to form dispersions.
The stability of such dispersions will depend on the surface properties
of the phase interfaces; impurities such as oxides might have important
effects. To scout the behavior of molten halides and lead under agita-
tion, a simple apparatus was built out of quartz. Gases for sparging
and stirring were supplied from an existing manifold. The gas inlet tube
ended in a nozzle and could be moved up and down through an O-ring seal;
this enabled gas to be released below the surface of molten lead. The
salt-lead mixtures in the quartz tube were heated with a gas burner to
about 500°C.

NaCl-KC1 (50-50 mole %) and ILead. Sparging with 100 ml/min of dry
helium below the lead surface produced 0.5- to 2-mm lead droplets, which
were thrown approximately 1 cm upward into the salt. A few of the drop-
lets persisted thereafter for a maximum of 5 sec on the lead surface
before they coalesced with the pool of lead. Trapped gas bubbles on
the lead-salt interface showed a wetting contact angle between salt and
lead (© < 90°). This conformed with contact angle measurements of
sesslle drops of the same salt on other oxide-free metals. This means
that the adhesion force between salt and lead is relatively large and
might explain the observed delay in the coalescence of the lead droplets
on the lead surface. ©Sparging with a dry Os-He mixture changed the
appearance of the salt from transparent water-white, into red-brown (tea
color). Supposedly, the color change was associated with lead oxide
dissolved 1in the salt. OSubsequent sparging with helium containing hydro-
gen reduced the lead oxide and produced a black cloudiness (lead suspension).
After 5 min of continuous bubbling with helium, the salt again became
transparent, indicating a complete coalescence of the finely dispersed
127

lead from the salt. The presence of saturating amounts of lead in PbCl,
(2 x 1072 mole % at 600°C)3> gives a marked discoloration in a PbClo
melt. Accordingly, the absence of any change in color of the NaCl-KC1l
melt in contact with molten lead indicated a very low lead solubility.

LipBely, and Iead. ©Sparging with dry helium below the salt-lead inter-
face caused small lead droplets to be thrown upward into the salt. However,
little or no delay in the coalescence of these droplets with the bulk of
the lead was observed. From sessile-drop experiments it had been found
that the contact angle between Ii BeF, and several oxide-free metals is
nonwetting (6 2 90°). Extrapolating these results to lead supports the
hypothesis that the adhesion between LisBeF, and lead is smaller than
that between the chlorides and lead. Thus, in accord with the observation
a smaller delay in the coalescence of lead might be expected. Sparging
with an oxygen-hellium mixture gave different results from those obtained
with the chlorides; the fluoride melt became milky, and finely divided
white particles and deposits were observed. This was attributed to the
formation of BeO by the reactions

 

Pb + %Og - PbO,
PbO + Bels — BeO + PbFs,.

Subsequent sparging with helium containing hydrogen gave no continued
or dramatic blackening of the salt phase, although there was a dark
color that may have been formed from PbF,. Closer examination of the
salt phase by means of x-ray diffraction indicated the presence of
several wt % of PbF, in the frozen melt. However, even in the presence
of oxides, the coalescence of the visible lead droplets was rapid; this
seemed well ascertained even though, due to the milky appearance and
gradual attack of the quartz tube, the visibility eventually became
rather poor.

The present results indicate that it may be possible to separate
dispersions of the salts and lead even in the presence of oxides.

Removal of Moisture from MSR Graphite

 

Any water vapor which is present in the MSRE core system will react
with the molten fluoride fuel mixture to produce HF and ZrO,; it is,
therefore desirable, if not essential, that the ingress of water to the
MSRE fuel system be minimized. The moderator graphite is one obvious
source of such water, and the MSRE startup program includes plans for
removal of water by heating the completed, but empty, reactor core to
650°C while helium gas 1s circulated through it. (An additional long-
term cleaning of the reactor core by circulating a uranium-free salt
mixture will be conducted before the actual fuel salt is added to the
system.) A brief study has been made to determine the quantity of water
which can be removed from the MSRE graphite, and other graphites, by
purging with helium.
128

This study has been made on short (6 to 12 in.) pieces of graphite
having the same cross section as the MSRE moderator elements. Each piece
was enclosed in a close-fitting Inconel can (see Fig. 6.7) which was
mounted in a furnace and connected to a system for recirculation of helium
gas over the specimen and through magnesium perchlorate and a dry-ice
cold trap in a drying train. The water vapor content of the helium
emerging from the graphite was measured continuously with a Meeco moisture
analyzer as the temperature of the graphite was raised at controlled,
constant rates (5-65°C/hr) to 700°C.

Earlier tests®* with AGOT and TS-281 graphites (both much more perme-
able than the MSRE moderator graphite) showed that physically adsorbed
water and what appeared to be chemisorbed water could be removed by
purging with helium. Water vapor was shown to readsorb readily from
moist helium on such graphite blocks during 2-hr exposure periods. Similar
observations have also been made on other grades of permszable graphite;
the behavior of a typical material (CS-312 graphite) is shown in Fig. 6.8.

The chemical specification for MSRE moderator graphite limits per-
missible oxide contamination to 30 ecm® of CO (STP) per 100 cm® of graphite
when evolved gases are held in contact with the graphite specimen while

heating to 1800°C. This test does not include water, which would be
removed by evacuation at room temperature. If this quantity of CO is
initially present in the assembled reactor moderator as water vapor, then
approximately 465 g of H»,0 would be available for reaction with the fuel-
salt mixture. This amount would be equivalent to about 100 ppm of oxide
ion in the fuel-salt mixture.

Before the actual MSRE graphite became available, a section of a
development test bar was supplied as representative of MSRE graphite.
As indicated by Fig. 6.9, essentially no water was removed from this bar
by the purging treatment. Moreover, when the graphite was exposed to
molist helium, very little water was physically adsorbed and essentially
none was chemisorbed by this graphite. Exposure of the graphite to moist
helium for periods up to 12 hr failed to produce evidence for chemisorbed
moisture. (The insets in Fig. 6.9 illustrate removal of water on purging
at room temperature.) To provide a test under extreme conditions, the
graphite block was immersed in water for 1 hr, was allowed to drain at
room temperature, and was then heated to 100°C while purging with helium.
Upon subsequent heating to 700°C while purging with helium, some evidence
of chemisorbed water removal was noted (see Fig. 6.10). However, a sub-
sequent exposure of the graphite block to moist helium for 4 hr again
falled to show any chemisorption of water vapor.

GRAPHITE TEMPERATURE (°C)

Fig., 6.11. Removal of Moisture from MSRE Graphite (Grade CGB)
by Helium Purging While Heating to 700°C.

heating to 700°C corresponded to only 1.32 cm® of water vapor per 100 cm”
of graphite. It is of interest that results obtained by outgassing three
graphite samples from the same moderator element in accordance with the
graphite specifications were 11.9, 1.5, and 1.3 cm® of CO (STP) per 100
cm® of graphite.35 The agreement between the two concordant outgassing
results and the amount of chemisorbed water removed indicates that the
MSRE graphite will contain less than 2 cm’® of CO per 100 cm® of graphite
and that it will release this oxygen in the form of water vapor during
the planned pretreatment. The total amount is, of course, less than 10%
of the amount permitted by the specifications.

On the basis of these data, the unclad graphite moderator for the

MSRE should not release obJjectionable quantities of water vapor into the
reactor core system. Whereas quantities of adsorbed moisture found in
as-received graphites have been small, the helium purge treatment that
1s planned during reactor startup operations should provide an effective
means for its removal. Furthermore, there should be little or no con-
tamination to the graphite moderator by moist air during possible main-
tenance operations on the reactor core. Additional studies of moisture
removal from rejected MSRE moderator elements will be made to provide a
broader base for these conclusions.

Interfacial Behavior of Fluorides with Graphite and Metals

sessile drops was continued.?® Salts other than MSRE fuel salt and
LioBeFy and surfaces other than graphite, including nickel, copper, gold,
and platinum were used.

The absence of a measurable temperature dependence of the contact

tension and density on the drop shape. The temperature coefficient can

with this temperature dependence of the contact angle were about equal to
the accuracy of the measurement.

The cosine of the contact angle between molten fluorides and graphite
1s plotted against surface tension at the melting point of the salts in
Mg. 6.12. The experlmental points can be represented by a straight line.
Ellefson and Taylor measured the contact angle between NaF and graphite,
6 = 135° at 994 °C, while © ® 125° at 1024°C was measured at ORNL in 1956.
Points representlng these values in Fig. 6.12 are below the line, and
Ellefson's measurement differs the most from the relation proposed here
between cos O and surface tension. The plot of cos 6 vs surface tension
in Fig. 6.12 1ndlcates that Tthe change from nonwetting to wetting, in the
sence of © > 90° to © < 90°, takes place at a surface tension of about
190 dynes/cm (at the meltlng point). This conclusion may be of importance
when predicting the permeation of fluoride melts into graphite.

In a previous report36 Tthe decrease of the contact angle between
graphite and fuel salt or LisBel, in moist helium was mentioned. Ten

and graphite from 150 to 20° within 1 hr. A similar behavior was Ffound
for LiyBelF,. However, the contact angle between graphite and fluoride
salts not containing beryllium or other salts reactive toward water did
not alter much in the presence of water. For instance, the contact angle
between the eutectic mixture LiF-NaF or the ILiF-NaF-KF eutectic and
graphite did not change in helium containing 200 ppm of H,0. Extended
exposure at 700°C to helium containing more than 1000 ppm of H,O decreased
the contact angle of these salts slightly (10°).

Permeation of Graphite. 1In contrast to what was observed earlier,36
the wetting of graphite by LioBeF, and fuel salt in the presence of water
vapor did result in permeation of salt into the porous AGOT graphite.
Breaking of the graphite sample and inspection of the new surface with
a stereoscopic microscope showed small amounts of salt present at different
places in the interior of the graphite. However, the amount of salt in
the pores was small and did not show on a metallographic examination.

A similar, small amount of wetting KC1 (6 = 68°) was found in porous AGOT
graphite. In only one case was an appreciable permeation into graphite
observed. This occurred when a moist helium-oxygen mixture (20 ppm Ho0
and 10% 0Oz) instead of moist helium was passed over a drop of fuel salt.
Figure 6.13 shows the metallographic cross section of the wetting edge

of the frozen fuel salt of this drop on AGOT graphite.

Table 6.4 gives the measured contact angles between several salts
and oxide-free metals in a pure helium atmosphere, together with the
surface tensions of the salts.

In Fig. 6.12, cos © on platinum 1s plotted vs surface tension at
the melting temperature of the salts, also indicating a linear relation
between surface tension and cos ©. The contact angles between molten
fluorides and the metals are 10 to 20° smaller than on graphite. The
change from nonwetting to wetting on metals appears to occur at a surface
tension of 210 dynes/cm rather than at 190 dynes/cm, as on graphite.

The value of the contact angle depended heavily on the condition of
the metal surface. If oxide was present on the metals, the contact angle
wa. s OO, and complete spreading ensued. However, when the oxide layer was
removed before formation of the sessile drop (by hydrogen treatment at
high temperatures for nickel and copper and by heating to ~800°C for gold
and platinum), the value of © was >0. As on graphite, the high-surface-
tension fluorides show a nonwetting (6 > 90°) contact angle on metals.

This was an unexpected result because some nonfluoride salts with high sur-
face tension, which did not wet graphite, were reported37 to wet metals
(Table 6.5).

When hellum contalning oxygen was passed over the drops, spreading
occurred (6 = 0°). In situ treatment with H2 at 700°C in the case of
nickel and copper and simple heating to ~800°C for gold and platinum gave
again an increase in the contact angle, although the initial high contact
angle was not always reached. This was especially true for Li,BeF, and
fuel salt, where stable oxides might have formed from traces of moisture
present in the oxygen gas. Figure 6.14 shows this reversible spreading
and recoalescence for Ii,Bel, on gold.

 

Often the place where the drop had been sitting in the beginning was
not wet when the salt had spread. The presence of the drop had prevented
the formation of an oxide layer on that place. In other cases the salt
covered the metal completely, but the salt contracted thereafter, first
into a "doughnut," around the place where the drop had been sitting in the
beginning. IFurther removal of the oxide layer led then to further recoa-
lescence and formation of a drop.

Hi'-H»,0 Equilibria with Molten Fluorides

 

The reaction

H20(py + 2F = Q=" + ZHF(g) (1)

(soln) (soln)
is responsible for oxide contamination of melts exposed to water vapor.
The reverse of this reaction is used in the HF-H, purification process to
remove oxide contamination. A knowledge of equilibrium quotients for this
reaction at temperatures and in solvents of interest would be valuable in
several ways. If the fluoride melt is saturated with a metal oxide, the
reaction may be written

2 _ 2
H20(p) * % MFX(SOln) = = MOX/Z(C) + 2HF (2)

where (c) is the crystalline solid state and (g) is the gaseous state.

For this system the equilibrium is a function only of P o> & measur-
able quantity, and the activity of ME.., whose concentra%gon fs known, in
the melt. As described in more detail elsewhere,38 measurements of equi-
libria in oxide-saturated melts, coupled with data from other investigators
on the corresponding reaction for the pure metal fluoride, have given the
activity coefficients listed in Table 6.6.

In addition to thermodynamic data on metal fluorides in IiF-BeF,; melts,
the investigation of HpO-HF equilibria should provide information to opti-
mize the HF-Hp purification procedure for oxide removal. Further, since
from Eq. (1) the quotient BHF/BH2O should be inversely proportional to the
oxide ion concentration

at a given temperature and melt composition,* then the measurement of
P2HF/PH2O in equilibrium with a melt could provide a needed means of oxide
analysis at the low oxide concentrations (<0.06 mole/kg) encountered in
these melts.

The experimental procedure consists in sparging the melt under inves-
tigation with a stream of hydrogen gas which is presaturated (by bubbling
through aqueous HF solution) with small amounts of HF and H,0. The efflu-
ent gas from the molten salt is analyzed for HF (by alkalimetric titration)
and for H,O0 (by Karl Fischer titration).

It has been observed during sparging with such dilute gases (PHF and
PH,0> <0.03 atm) that the quotient PﬁF/Pﬁ 0 in the effluent gas is nearly
independent of the influent gas composition and of the flow rate; equilib-
rium between the liquid and gas phases is, apparently, reached very rapidly.
1f, in the removal of oxide from a melt by HF sparging, it can be assumed
that the effluent gas composition at any time corresponds to the PﬁF/Pﬁgo
value 1n equilibrium with the oxide remaining at that time, then the
following mathematical analysis of the purification process is possible.

The relation between the decrease of the dissolved oxide ion concen-
tration (-d[0%7]) and the volume of sparging gas passed (dV) is

Removal of Dissolved Oxide from 2LiF<BeF, at 600°C. P
1s the initial partial pressure of HF. The dashed line
represents 100% concentration of HF to produce H,O.

It is apparent from these calculations that the efficiency of oxide
removal by HF treatment can, in principle, be high. While the efficiency
in terms of moles of oxide removed per mole of HF passed is greater at the
high partial pressures of HF, the efficiency of HF utilization is predicted
to be >50%, even at inlet pressures of 0.05 atm. These high estimated
efficiencies result mainly from the estimated low value of Qo (5 x 10~%
mole, kg~t, atm) in 2LiF-BeF, at 600°C. If Qp 1s larger than this estimate,
the efficiency of HF sparging would be correspondingly decreased.

These high efficiencies also depend upon a further condition, that is,
that no appreciable OH 1is present in the melt as a result of the reaction

HE + 0°° = QH + F~. (7)

The importance of this reaction has not yet been fully determined. If it
should be true that, during HF-H, sparging, [OH"] is significant compared
to [02‘], then the minimum sparging volumes indicated in Fig. 6.15 will be
increased. A full mathematical treatment of this case has not yet been
worked out, but the nature of the effect is shown by imposing the simpli-
fying restriction that the effluent partial pressure of HF (PHF) be held

constant (which is an increasingly good approximation as sparging proceeds).
Then 1t can be shown that

[70%-], [£0°"],

141

(wherein Qo is equal to KOH702—/[F’]7F_7OH_, KOH being the equilibrium
constant for the reaction in Eq. 7). The predicted sparging volume is seen
to be given by two terms. The first is that predicted by Eq. 6 as [0°~]
becomes small, and the second is that resulting from any [OH™] which is
formed during sparging. The ratio of the latter to the former quantity

is simply Pgp/Qog, which equals the ratio [OH-]/[0%-]. The possible forma-
tion of OH™, is a matter of conslderable interest, not only because it
would affect the ease of oxide removel, but also because its formation
renders more difficult the subsequent stripping of HF from the melt, involv-
ing as it would, reversal of the reaction in EKq. 7. OSparging experiments
are planned fram which Qog, 1f appreciable, may be estimated and from which
Qo may be determined with better accuracy and as a function of temperature
and melt composition.

F'or the present, the above calculations suggest that HF sparging
efficiencies in removing dissolved oxide can be rather high. It is of
particular interest to note that at very low oxide concentrations, there
is predicted a logarithmic decrease in the oxide content of the melt with
the volume of sparging gas passed (Eq. 8). If such behavior can be
realized 1n larger-scale purifications, it would seem advantageous to fil-
ter melts prior to HF treatment in order to remove suspected oxide solids
which otherwise might reduce this sparging efficiency because of low dis-
solution rates.

1t appears as well, from the present results, that oxide removal by
HE' sparging could be followed by side-stream analy51s of the effluent gases
for HF and HoO content. Values of the quotient P would be a useful
measure of the oxide content of the melt. While %Ee D Oportlonallty con-
stant QO (Eq. 3) is not yvet well known for all the conditions of interest
to the operation of the MSRE, values of PﬁF/PHgO for 2ILiF-Bel's melts satu-
rated with BeO have been measured at temperatures from 500 to 700°C. These
results, summarized in Iig. 6.16, represent the lower limits of this quo-
tient, correspondlng to the maximum oxide content of these melts. Present
crude estimates suggest that Pz /PH 0 should be more than ten times larger
for ZrOs-saturated melts of the MSR% composition than for BeO-saturated
melts.

Removal of Sulfates from 2LiF-Bel,

 

In previously reported studies of sulfate removal in the purification
of 2LiF-Bel'p, melts, it was found that the difficulties of low removal rates,
incomplete removal, and serious corrosive attack of the containing vessel
all could effectively be overcome by reduction of the sulfate with beryllium
metal prior to HF-H> sparglng

In continued study of this procedure, three experiments were performed
in which the hydrogen flow rate, the HF flow rate, and the sulfur content
were separately varied with temperatures, and the amount of melt was held

approximately constant. In each test, only a small excess of beryllium
over the amount required for sulfate reduction

4Be + 807" == 4BeO + 527

was used. The same nickel container and melt were used in all three tests.
As a means of determining the amount of corrosion taking place within the
vessel, a nickel rod inserted into the melt was withdrawn from time to time

for inspection.

The course of each test is indicated in Fig. 6.17, wherein the amount
of sulfur removed as Hob is plotted as a function of time. The conditions
employed in each test are listed in Table 6.7. 1In each case, an initially
constant rate was found which appeared to be proportional to the H, flow
rate but independent of the HF flow rate and the sulfur concentration
(Table 6.7). In each case, when the amount of sulfur remaining was ~600
ppm (~0.02 mole/kg), a logarithmic decay of the H»5S evolution rate began.
The half-time for sulfur removal in this region (4 to 6 hr) was inversely
proportional to the Hy flow rate. The half-time was clearly not greatly
affected by the initial sulfur content or by the HEF flow rate.

These tests involved sulfur concentrations two to four times those to
be encountered in the MSRE raw materials. The sparging times required were,
nonetheless, only 20 to 40 hr. Examination of the nickel rods exposed to
the melts during sulfur removal showed no detectable attack of the metal.

A light deposit of black material was noted at the position of the melt-gas
interface and at the upper (cooler) end of the rod. In one case, metallic
dendrites were found deposited on the rod at the melt-gas interface. They
were magnetic and presumably were nickel metal. Of the total amount of
sulfur added in the three tests, ~90% has been recovered as H,S; ~93%
apparently could have been removed by extended sparging. The remaining 7%
(~70 mg of sulfur), presumably lost by corrosion reactions, is thought to
have been deposited principally in the cool parts of the exhaust line.
However, this 1s yet to be determined.

As discussed previously, 1t 1s desirable elther to maintain the ratio
of HyS/H, in the gas phase below that required for NiS formation (~0.001
at 600°C) or to maintain the temperature below 645 C to avoid formation of
the Ni-NiS eutectic thought to be responsible for sulfide embrittlement of
nickel. In the present tests, both these conditions have been met; hence
the evident low corrosion is not surprising. It 1s most encouraging,
however, that these conservative conditions still permit satisfactory
removal rates. |

As yet, insufficient data have been collected to explain the curious
rate behavior observed in these tests: (1) an initial constant rate of H,S
evolution which is proportional to the Ho, flow but independent of the HF
flow or the sulfur content; and (2) a logarithmic decrease in the HsS evolu-
tion rate, the half-time of which appears to be affected only by the H>
flow rate. Further tests involving admixture of He should show whether or
not Hy flow or total gas flow 1s rate controlling. In addition, tests at
lower HF flow rates are desirable, since at some point this variable is
expected to be controlling.

For the present, it is tempting to speculate that the initial rate
involves reaction of a solid, perhaps Beo or NiS. Nickel sulfide is a
possible such solid since, during the period of constant Hpb-evolution rate,
the st/Hg ratio 1s only about twice that reported4o for the equilibrium

Ni + H,S = NiS + H,

at 600°C. If NiS solid is present, then when it is completely removed by
reaction, the HzS/H2 ratio would fall. During the subsequent decrease in
rate, it seems likely that the rate-controlling process would involve
reaction of a decreasing amount of sulfide, either dissolved or as finely
dispersed solids. If the sulfide is dissolved, the previously saturating
solid (presumably BeS or NiS) yields a sulfide concentration of ~600 ppm
(~0.02 mole/kg). This is in apparent disagreement with the last reported
experiment involving beryllium reduction, wherein the maximum dissolved
sulfide concentration appeared to be ~100 ppm (~0.003 mole/kg) at the same
temperature. However, a filtered sample taken early in the first of the
present tests showed 820 ppm total sulfur.
146

Perhaps the most important implication of the present results is that
when sulfate was reduced to sulfide prior to its removal, the maximum
HQS/H2 ratio attained in the exit gases was of the order of 0.0005. This
in turn indicates that for a given initial sulfur content, a fairly large
volume of sparging Hp, would be required; for example at 600°C it appears
that at least 1500 std liters of H; are required to remove 1 g of sulfur
from 2LiF-BeF,; as HpS. The Hy volume indicated by this condition is a
lower limit since the logarithmic behavior of the H»S evolution rate below
600 ppm would, of course, require considerably larger volumes.

At temperatures higher than 600°C, sulfur should be removed more

rapidly because both the limiting H2S/H2 ratio should increase and the half-
times of the latter removal stages should be lower.

Fluoride Salt Production

 

The primary function of the fluoride production facility is the prep-
aration of fluoride fuel, flush, and coolant salts for the MSRE. Some
26,560 1b of fused fluoride mixtures will be required for one complete
reactor loading. The first production mixture is to consist of 15,300 1b
of the mixture Ii’F-BeF, (66-34 mole %) to be used as coolant- and flush-
salt mixtures in prenuclear test operation of the reactor system. These
mixtures will be chemically identical but will differ in ILi® concentration;
raw material batches having the highest Ii® concentrations will be used to
make the coolant-salt mixture. Approximately 5800 1b of coolant mixture
will be prepared to fill a required volume of about 42 ft3. The required
volume of flush salt is about 73 ft°, for which the remaining 9500 1b of
binary salt mixture will be prepared. These production estimates include
a calculated 10% excess to allow for the usual contingencies. The reactor
fuel-salt mixture will be made from a LiF-BeF,-7rF, solvent mixture to
which UF; will be added as the eutectic mixture IiF-UF, (73-27 mole %).
The overall composition of the fuel-salt mixture will be LiF-BeFo-ZrF,-UF,
(65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9 mole %) ; fissionable U237 will comprise about one-third
of the total uranium content. Some 11,260 1b of the fuel mixture will be
prepared for the first reactor loading of 73 ft°.

An important secondary function is the production of fluoride salt
mixtures for use in other molten-salt research programs, in engineering
Ttests connected with MSR development programs, and in fuel reprocessing
studies requiring the use of fused salts. During 1963, approximately 470
kg of fluoride mixtures containing LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, was brepared, by
operation of the large production facility, for chemical research programs
and experimental engineering tests related to the molten-salt research
program. An additional 435 kg of the mixture NaF-ILiF-ZrF, (37.5-37.5-25.0
mole %) was prepared in this facility for use by the ORNIL Chemical Technology
Division in pilot-plant studies of reactor fuel reprocessing schemes. A
total of 120 kg of various fluoride mixtures was prepared in smaller batches
for use by other ORNL groups and for subcontract work on corrosion at the
Battelle Memorial Institute.
147

Production Process

Fluoride mixtures are prepared from high-quality fluoride salts in
two batch-processing units, each having a capacity of about 2 ft3>. Raw
materlals are assembled in a central handling area, weighed into appropriate
batch sizes in a well-ventilated hood enclosure, and transferred to a
furnace assembly by a vibratory conveyor. Because of the toxicity of
fluoride salts and of beryllium fluoride in particular, this area is iso-
lated from other working areas by shower facilities and alr locks. Person-
nel working within the area wear fully protective, plastic, fresh-air suits
to avoid exposure to hazardous chemicals. This area is shown in Fig. 6.18.

Since fluoride production for the MSRE will require large quantities
of each mixture, a single premelting furnace, shown in Fig. 6.19, was
installed to provide molten raw-material charges for each of the two pro-
cessing units. By coordinating the operation of this facility with the
production cycles of the processing units, a semicontinuous operation can
be achieved. Time periods previously required for cooling and reheating
The salt treatment vessels will be eliminated by this processing technique.

The molten raw-material mixtures are transferred by gas pressure into
the batch-processing units, one of which is shown in Fig. 6.20. The melts
are sparged with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride admixed with hydrogen to remove
oxides as water vapor and sulfur impurities as H3S. Sparging by hydrogen
alone is used in a subsequent treatment to reduce structural-metal cations;
a final helium stripping operation removes residual quantities of HF. The
melt is then transferred through a sintered nickel filter into a nickel
storage container and allowed to cool.

Raw-Material Procurement

 

All raw materials required for the first complete reactor loading and
additional Ii’F for the planned replacement of the flush salt and fuel
mixture are on hand at the production facility, with the exception of
enriched UF,, which is readily available. The actual quantities (1b) are
as follows: Ii’F, 22,000; BeFy, 12,000; and ZrF, (Hf-free), 2300.

IiF Densification

 

As previously reported4l the Li7F, as received, was found to have a
low bulk density which would not permit a full loading of the premelting

furnace. Furthermore, the material was extremely dusty; dry loading
operations would have been accompanied by large losses of Ii’. Subsequent
examination showed that it also contained substantlal amounts of unconverted
IiOH and/or water. Densification by heating to 650°C had appeared promising
in laboratory tests. Intermediate-scale tests were made with the use of

a cylindrical nickel vessel, mounted horizontally in a tube furnace and
equipped with a rotating vane agitator for the contents. The apparatus
simulated existing production-scale equipment, see below, in which it

seemed possible to treat the 22,000 1b of IiF. For the intermediate-scale
tests, approximately 1 kg of IiF was loaded into the vessel, the agitator
was started, and the temperature was slowly raised while a sweep gas was
being passed through the system to remove evolved water. Anhydrous HF was
mixed with the helium sweep gas while heating to about 200°C to convert
LiOH, either 1n1t1ally present or formed by pyrohydrolysis, to LiF; other-
wise, heating to 650°C in a helium stream would permit the LiOH to be fused
with the LiF to give an intractable mass.

Actual production operations are now in progress, beginning with the
densification step. Batches of Ii’F (75 to 140 kg each) are being pro-
cessed in equipment that had been used earlier in the conversion of ZrCl,
to ZrF, by treatment with anhydrous HF at elevated temperatures. This
equipment, shown in Fig. 6.21, is a horizontal Monel reaction vessel
(17 in. in diameter by 8 ft long) that is equipped with a full-length
agitator and a heating Jjacket. Material which has been heated to about
500°C by the densification procedure has an acceptably increased bulk
density of about 1 g/cm3 and is a free-flowing, usable powder.

Development and Evaluation of Methods for the
Analysis of the MSRE Fuel

 

 

Electrochemical studies of the MSRE fuel were initiated to determine
whether those methods could be used for possible direct analysis of
metallic impurities. Cursory investigations were made on the use of
electron spin resonance (ESR) to determine the oxidation states of uranium
(U°F and U**) in the fuel salt. The modification and testing of analytical
methods for the analysis of the fuel were continued using the "mockup"
hot-cell facility.

Electrochemical Analyses

 

Electroanalytical methods are adaptable to in-line analyses and appear
to be especlally attractive with regard to the direct analysis of impuril-
ties (e.g., corrosion products) and other electroactive species in the
molten MSRE fuel. Previous work%<:%3 on the voltammetry of iron in molten
fluorides demonstrated the applicability of this electroanalytical tech-
nique to the problem. The rapid-scan voltammetry and anodic—strigging
voltammetry of nickel in molten fluorides have also been studied.

In order to investigate the current-potential characteristics of the
electroactive species expected to be present in the MSRE fuel, a cell
assembly was constructed, and the necessary electrodes were fabricated.

The assembly42 consists of a graphite cell approximately 2 in. in
diameter and 4—1/2 in. long which contains the melt; a quartz jacket
approximately 2—1/2 in. in diameter and 10 in. long with a removable cap
for maintaining a controlled atmosphere over the melt; a 3-in.-ID resis-
tance furnace; a furnace-temperature control; and a melt-temperature
monitoring system.

A pyrolytic-graphite electrode*? (PGE) coupled with a platinum quasi-
reference electrode comprised the measuring system, while a third platinum
electrode isolated in a separate porous-graphite inner compartment of the
main cell served as a counter electrode. In previous works%3, %% the PGE
was prepared by brazing an 18-gage platinum wire directly to pyrolytic
graphite at high temperature under vacuum. The graphite was then machined
to a 1/8-in. diameter, and a boron nitride insulating sheath was pressed
to fit around the graphite. Graphite electrodes prepared for the present
152

work by the above technique proved to be unsatisfactory owing to the
inability to machine to tolerances close enough to obtain a consistently
tight fit between the graphite and boron nitride. To eliminate this
difficulty, a standard tapered hole was drilled in the boron nitride which
was then fitted to the pyrolytic graphite machined to the same taper.
Any extension of either material beyond the other was machined off. In
this manner a tight fit was obtained. This method also eliminates any
strain on the braze Jjoint between platinum and pyrolytic graphite during
the fitting operation. One of the electrodes, prepared in the above
manner, has been in the molten-salt cell for about three weeks and still
appears to be performing satisfactorily.

A sample of MSRE fuel solvent having the composition given in Table
6.8 was loaded into the graphite electrolytic cell and was fused. The
temperature is being controlled at 500°C. The melt appeared to be cloudy
but cleared up after remaining in the molten state for about one day.
Calculations indicated that about 520 ppm of the oxygen in the melt should
be present as insoluble Zr0O,, and it is supposed that this ZrO, settled
upon standing.

The prototype of a new fast-scan controlled-potential polarograph is
being used for obtaining current-potential curves in the MSRE fuel solvent.
The instrument appears to be compatible with the characteristics of the
molten-salt system since current-potential curves obtained from the instru-
ment and the ORNL model Q-1988 (adapted for fast scan) are camparable.

Current-potential curves obtained with the PGE indicated that the
cathodic limit of the melt was at -1.2 v vs the platinum quasi-reference
electrode. No anodic limit appeared in the case of scans to +3.0 v.

Before investigating the current-potential characteristics of various
electroactive species in melts, it is desirable to determine the approxi-
mate potential at which a particular specie may undergo oxidation or
153

reduction. For this reason the decomposition potentials of several pure
metals in the MSRE fuel solvent were determined. Table 6.9 lists the
experimental decomposition potentials of several pure metals vs the
platinum quasi-reference electrode in three different molten salts.

dvalues obtained after partial cleanup of melt. Reruns with other
metals were not made.

The only comparisons that can be made between the MSRE fuel solvent
and the other two melts are the relative potentials within a particular
melt. This is due to the fact that the arbitrary zero potential of the
platinum quasi-reference electrode may be different for each melt. This
became more evident after a partial cleanup of the MSRE melt was made.

The cathodic limit shifted to about -1.5 v, and a rerun using the nickel
electrode showed a decomposition potential of about +0.1 v (a negative
shift of 0.3 v in each case). The separation of the potentials for iron
and chromium in the MSRE melt should be noted as compared to the other two
melts.

Future plans include the investigation of the current-potential
characteristics of chromium, a corrosion product in the MSRE fuel.

Oxidation States--Uranium

 

A feasibility study of the possible determination of U(III), U(V),
154

or both in the MSRE fuel by ESR or fluorescence measurements was started.
Prior studies have shown that U(III) fluoride alone or U(III) in single
crystals of alkaline-earth metal fluorides has an ESR absorption and that
both U(IIT) and U(IV) can be detected in the 0.1 - 5% range in thorium
oxide by ESR methods.%*?~ 20 Likewise, prior work”1~°° indicated differences
in the near-infrared fluorescence of these ions in similar types of crystal
hosts.

The ESR spectra of powdered MSRE-like samples containing 4.1% UQII)
with 0.8% U(IV), 0.65% U(III) with 0.91% UQ@V), 0.32% U(III) with 0.92%
U(V), and 0.0% U(III) with 5.7% U(IV) were obtained at about 293 and 77°K.
A signal attributable to U(III) was observed at 77°K for samples containing
this species. The U(III) ESR signal varied in magnitude approximately
with the U(III) concentration in preliminary scans. The detectability
should be at least 250 ppm under controlled conditions. In addition to
this absorption, other inflections were noted for the recorded derivatives
of the ESR spectra, one of which may be U(IV). Room-temperature spectra
also showed changes in ESR spectra with composition, but the inflections
have not yet been correlated satisfactorily with composition. In addition
to these two ions, iron, chromium, or nickel ion impurities may contribute
to the total ESR spectra. The ESR spectra of samples high in each or all
of these latter ions will be studied next.

Attempts to observe the near-infrared fluorescence of uranium in
fluoride eutectic powders or as pure U(III) fluoride using a Perkin-Elmer
112 spectrometer with calcium fluoride optics or using a Cary model 14
spectrophotometer with its fluorescence accessory have been unsuccessful
to date.

Methods Development

 

Chromium. The amperometric method for the titration of Cr(VI) with
ferrous sulfate’® has been evaluated. Application of the method has been
Tested in the mockup facility with sulfuric acid solutions of nonradio-
active MSRE salt samples. The precision of the remotely performed analysis
is 1.6%.

lron. The statistical evaluation of the determination of iron in
MSRE fuel has been completed in the mockup cell. The bathophenanthroline"’
extraction method was employed. The complex was developed by the stepwise
addition, while mixing, of 2 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride; 4 ml of
3 M sodium acetate; and 4 ml of 0.001 M bathophenanthroline to a test
portion of sulfuric acid solution of MSRE salt. The iron-bathophenanthroline
was extracted into 15 ml of carbon tetrachloride. The organic layer was
drained into a cuvette, and the absorbance was measured against a reagent
blank prepared in the same manner. The absorbance was obtained by means
of a remotely operated filter photometer fitted with a 534-mp filter. The
iron content of the test sample was obtained by comparing its absorbance
with a standard curve prepared in the same manner. Test solutions con-
taining iron concentrations as low as 0.5 ug/ml can be determined by this
method. The relative standard deviation of the method is 2%.
155

Molybdenum. The determination of molybdenum in MSRE fuel by the
thiocyanate method’® has been evalusted in the mockup. The camplex was
developed by the stepwise addition, while mixing, of 1 ml-of ferrous
ammonium sulfate; 3 ml of 10% potassium thiocyanate, and 3 ml of 10%
stannous chloride. The molybdenum-thiocyanate complex was extracted into
15 ml of isocamyl alcohol. The organic layer was transferred to a cuvette,
and the absorbance was measured against a reagent blank prepared in the
same manner. The absorbance was obtained with a remotely operated filter
photometer fitted with a 462-mp filter. The molybdenum content of the
test sample was obtained by comparing its absorbance with a standard curve
prepared in the same manner. Test solutions containing molybdenum con-
centrations as low as 1 pg/ml can be determined by this method. The
relative standard deviation of the method is 2%.

 

Uranium. The controlled-potential coulometric titration has been
applied to the determination of microgram quantities of uranium in MSRE
salt. A titration cell which includes an S.C.E. reference electrode, a
separated electrode of coiled platinum wire contained in 0.5 M HS0O4, and
a Teflon sleeved platinum wire to connect to the mercury was designed for
this method. A test solution representing approximately 500 pg of uranium
was added to the cell, which contained 3 ml of mercury and 4 ml of 0.5 M
Hp504. The solution was deaerated for 10 min while stirring. Essentially
complete elimination of interference was accomplished by a prereduction
at 0.075 v, positive polarity. The U(VI) was then reduced to U(V) at
0.325 v, negative polarity. The progress of the titration at the 10-
microequivalent range was followed by an ORNL model Q-2564 high-sensitivity
coulometer and continued until the potential was reduced to approximately
5 pa. The readout voltage due to the titration was read from an attached
potentiometer. When the MSRE fuel is dissolved in sulfuric acid, the
titration of uranium can be performed without any prior separation.
Application of the method to the l-microequivalent range of uranium will
be tested. In the analysis performed remotely on nonradiocactive materials,
a relative standard deviation of 0.8% was obtained.

Oxygen. Investigation of the determination of oxygen with the modi-
fied Ieco analyzer59 is being continued. Current calibrations indicate
an approach to quantitative recovery of microgram gquantities of oxygen
from UO, samples; but sufficient data have not yet been obtained for a
conclusive evaluation of the technique for application to MSRE fuel
samples.

Mockup of Hot Cell

 

Redesigning of the copper-ladle sampler to be used to sample the fuel
necessitated the rejection of a shearing device that was to be used for
cutting the attached stainless steel wire and the promotion of a modified
tube cutter. The revised ladle has only two slots (1/4 by 1/2 in.) to
facilitate the filling and draining of the molten salt; otherwise it is
completely enclosed. It was desired that the ladle be cut in two at
approximately the midpoint of the slots to obtain the proper form needed
156

in the pulverizing operation. To accomplish this, the tube cutter was
fitted with two cutter wheels in parallel so that the one cutter wheel
maintained the tension and alignment while the second cutter wheel was
passing through the filling and draining slots of the ladle. A motor
and clamp were added to hold and revolve the ladle while the tube cutter,
on 1ts attached platform and held stationary by a rod on the motor mount,
cut the ladle. This motorized tube cutter has been tested and is consid-
ered functionally satisfactory.

The improved versions of the Pulverizer-Mixer Aligner and the Powder
Transfer Device were fabricated. The Pulverizer-Mixer Aligner consists
essentially of a vise with special jaws designed to align or clamp the
pulverizer-mixer. The Powder Transfer Device is a mounted orbital sander
with a clamp on the face plate. The clamp is designed to hold the
pulverizer-mixer and attached polyethylene bottle during the action of
transferring the sample.

The weakness of the Transport Container Decoupling Device has been
corrected with a new motor and gear box along with some overload protec-
tion. The device consists of a reversible motor and gear box with a
hook on the shaft to suspend and turn the main body of the transport con-
tainer, and a key (mounted on an elevator) to hold the plug stationary
by 1ts slotted bottom. A 100 in.-1b torque slip clutch has been attached
to the key on the elevator to protect the gear box from too large a force.
Installed also, are a microswitch to cut off the power when an overload
has occurred and an override switch to reset the microswitch and slip
clutch.

The testing of all the equipment necessary to bprepare the fuel sample
for analysis has been in progress. Simulated fuel samples in copper ladles
are received 1in the transport container. They are handled and treated
remotely until the solidified fuel salt is in a powdered and homogenized
form ready for analysis. All the equipment appears to function satis-
factorily.
