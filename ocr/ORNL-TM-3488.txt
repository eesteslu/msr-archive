MASS TRANSFER EETWEEN HASTELIOY N AND HAYNES ALIOY No. 25
IN A MOLTEN SODIUM FLUOROBORATE MIXTURE

 

J. W. Koger and A, P. Litman®
. ABSTRACT

The compatibility of Haymes alloy No. 25 and Hastelloy N
with fused NaBF,-8 mole % NaF was determined in the range
605 to 460°C, The cobalt~base alloy was inadvertently
- incorporated in the Hastelloy N thermal convection loop and
was exposed to the fluoroborate salt mixture for 3660 hr.
' The Haynes alloy No. 25 suffered damage by selective
~ leaching of cobalt and chromium, which migrated to the
- Hastelloy N, The mechanism of corrosive attack was activity-
gradient and temperature-gradlent mass transfer. Haynes
alloy No. 25 is more suscepmlble to attack by the fluoroborate
~mixture than Hastelloy N. The presence of the small amount
of Haynes alloy No. 25 in the system did not compromise later
experiments on the monometalllc Hastelloy N system. Penetra-.
tion of deEOS1ted cobalt corresponded to a diffusivity of
5,6 % 1071° em /sec in Hastelloy'N at 465°C

 

s INTRODUCTION

Two thermal convectlon loops, NCL-13 and -14 began operation in
October 1967 to determlne the compatlbillty of standard and titanium-

"modlfled Hastelloy N alloys W1th NaBF4—8 mole % NaF salt, a candidate

secondary coolant for molten-salt reactors. The loops, which are

_plctured in Fig. 1, operated w1th maxjimum temperatures of 605 C and
”1nduced temperature dlfferences of 145°C | '

~Both' the heated and cooled sectlons of the loops contalned removable

:Hastelloy N SpeC1mens._ These speclmens were w1thdrawn perlodlcally

along w1th salt samples to follow corrOS1on processes as a functlon of

’5time.' After ‘some 4000 hr of operatlon, the Hastelloy N spe01mens in

the hottest and coldest reglons of the loops were removed and sub jected

“to detalled metallurglcal analy81s.- Portlons of the speC1mens were

sent for microprobe analysis to determine possible composition gradients

~due to mass transfer. In1t1al results showed ‘that a large amount of

cobglt had depos1ted on both the hot and cold 1eg specimens, The source

-of the cobalt was traced to the 1/8-in.-d1am rods that held the removable

speC1mens. These rods were determlned to be Haynes alloy No. 25 rather
than the specified Hastelloy N Further investigation revealed that

the source of the Haynes alloy No. 25 was a misidentified storage carton.
The specimen hanger rods were replaced with HastelIOy'N'and the experi-
ments were continued.

We have taken advantage of the situation to obtain 1nformation on
the corrosion of cdbalte and n;ckelébase alloys simultaneously exposed
to & molten fluoroborate salt. Further details on the compatibility of
Hastelloy and otheriallbYvaith fluroborate salts have been reported.> -t

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The test devices used in the experiments were thermal convection
loops in a harp configuration, with surge tanks atop each leg for sample
and speéimen access, The flow was generated by the difference in
density of the salt in the hot and cold legs of the loop, and the salt

flow velocity was approximately 7 £t /min,

Loop Fabrication

The loops were fabricated from 0.606-in.-ID Hastelloy N tubing with
a 0,072-in. wall thickness. The annealed material, heat 5097, was
TIG welded to Specifications PS-23:and PS-25 and inspected to MET-WR-200
‘specification. The finished loop was stress relieved at 880°C for 8 hr

in hydrogen.
Salt Preparation

The fluoroborate salt mixture used in the test program.was furnished
by the Fluoride Processing Group of the Reactor Chemistry Division, and
its compositioh béfore test is given in Teble 1. To mix and purify
the salt, the raw materials were first heated in a nickel;lined'vessel
to 150°C under vacuum and held for 15 hr. Then the salt was heated to
- 500°C, agitated with helium for a few hours, and transferred to the fill
vessel. At 600°C, the BF3; pressure is approximately 200 torr.

"loop.Operations

The loops were heated by'pairs of clamshell heaters placed end to

end W1th the input power controlled by silicon controlled rectifier
'units and the temperature controlled by a current proportioning controller.
"The loop temperatures were measured by Chromel vs Alumel thermocouples
~ that had been spot welded to the outside of the tubing, covered by a
" layer of quartz tape, and then'covered with stainless steel shim stock.
Tubular electric heaters cbntrolled by variable autotransformers

furnished the heat to the cold leg portions of the loops.
Before filling with salt, the loops were degreased with ethyl

alcohol, dried, and then heated to 150°C under vacuum to remove any traces

- of moisture. A helium massiSpectrometer leak detector was used to check

for leaks in the system. . |

The procedure forlfillinglthe loops consisted of heating the loop,
the salt pot, and all comnecting lines to approximately 550°C and
applying helium pressureto;the salt supply vessel to force the salt into

the loop. Air was continuonsly‘blown on freeze valves leading to the dump

~and flush tanks to prov1de & pos1t1ve salt seal.

All fill lines exposed to the fluoroborate salt were Hastelloy N.
All temporary connections from flll_line to loop were made with stainless
steel compression fittings., S .

‘The first charge of salt was held for 24 hr in the loops at the

a,max1mum operation temperature and then dumped. This flush salt charge

- was intended to remove ‘surface. oxides or other impurities left in the
.~ loops. The loops were then refilled with fresh salt, and operat1on began.
i_,fOnce the 1oop was filled the heaters on the cold legs of the loops
_-Eiwere turned off. As much 1nsulation was removed as necessary to obtain
i;_the prOper temperature difference by'exp031ng the cold leg to ambient
. air. Helium‘cover gas of . 99 998% purity and under slight pressure

| (approx 5 ps1g) was maintained over the salt in the loops durlng operation.

Each loop contained lA Hastelloy'N specimens 0. 75 x 0. 38 X 0.030 in.,

'”f'each with a surface area of 0.55 in.? (3.5 em ) Seven specimens were

attached at different vertical posztions on l/B-in. rods (later found

to be Haynes alloy No. 25). This array could be placed into or removed
 

 

 

- from the loops during operation by means of a double ball valve
arrangement, One rod was inserted in the hot leg and another in the
cold leg of each loop. The surface area of the rod exposed to the salt
was one-ninth that of the loop. The compbsition of the Hastelloy N

loop tubing is compared with the nominal composition of Haynes alloy No. 25

in Table 2.

The loops were operated at a maximum température of 605°C and a

TEST RESULTS

Preliminary results of analyses from rods and specimens of both
loops (NCL-13 and -14) were identical., Thus, we completed detailed
analyses only on the materiasls from NCL-13, ;

Haynes Alloy No. 25 Samples

After 3660 hr of salt exposure and discovery of the material mixup,
samples of the 1/8-in. Haynes alloy'No. 25 specimen holder rods were
taken from various positions and analyzed in detail. Figure 2 shows

appreciable cobalt. There was an average of 1.8 wt % Co in a band
6 pm thick on the hot leg specimen and 7.3 wt % Co in a band of the
same thickpess on the cold leg specimen. These results were substantia-
ted by qﬁalitative x-ray fluorescence mgasurements,‘which showed more
cobalt than iron (approx 5%) in a band near the surface. Laser spectro-
graphic analysis showed substantial cobalt at depths less than 20 um
into the material. The amount of cobalt in the Hastelloy N specimen
located at the bottom of the_cold leg (approx 465°C) was determined as
a function of position by microprobe and is given in Fig. 8. A cobalt
composition gradieht in hot leg specimens, obtained by the microprobe,
was not well defined and will be discussed later,

Using the penetration curve of Fig. 8, we determined the diffusion
coefficient of cobalt in-Hastelloy'N. A constant surface concentration

of cobalt was assumed to integrate Fick's second law,

SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS

The chemical and metallurgical analyses show that chromium and
cobalt were leached from the Haynes alloy No. 25 at all test temperatures.
Although the percentage of chromium lost was greater than that of cobalt,

the total mass of chromium lost was less. The cobalt and chromium

migrated to_the_Hastelloy N specimens and loop piping. There was also

some -evidence of highly locelized nickel transfer from the hot section
to the cold section of the Hayhes alloy No. 25 rod. Iron deposited on
the Haynes alloy No. 25 in the cold section and was probably supplied |
by the leaching of iron from the Hastelloy N 1oop'piping by the salt.
Attack of Haynes alloy No. 25 by BF3 in the vapor phase as evidenced
by'loss of alloy constltuents was less severe than the salt corrosion,
However, more dlscoloratlon and surface roughening were noted on the
samples exposed to the gas. The Haynes alloy No., 25 suffered much more
damage than the Hastelloy'N in the vapor phase, Haynes alloy No. 25
appears to be more suSceptible_to attack by the fluoroborate mixture
than Hastelloy N. -

~  DISCUSSION

Prior Studies

Past work!® at ORNL measured the chemical corrosion of various
materials under the condltlons exPerlenced durlng the fluorinatlon of

r'molten-salt fuels in the Flnorlde Vblatllity Process. The salt used

was equimolar NaF—ZrF4 contalning O to 5 mole % UF,. Several'cobalt-

:_contalnlng alloys were tested at 600 + 100°C, and ‘the behavior of those
 with less than 20 wt % Co wa.s 31mllar to that of Hastelloy'N However,

as the cobalt content exceeded 20 wt %, the alloys showed a much greater

1tdegree of attack than Hastelloy'N

In a recent testl* at ORNL, samples of various materials including Kﬁij
Hastelloy N, Haynes alloy No. 25, and graphite were placed in the vapor
and 1izuid zones of a vacuum distillation experiment that used a
LiF~-BeF,-ZrF, salt. The temperature ranged from 500 to 1000°C over a .
period of 4300 hr in the molten salt and 900 to 1025°C for more than 300 hr
in the vépor. The Haynes'alioy'No. 25 was the most heavily corroded of
the metals tested and was also brittle at the end of the test. Fracture
of one Haynes alloy No. 25 specimen caused a loss‘of some of the other
specimens during the experiment. Figure 9 shows the Hayhes alloy No. 25

specimens before and after test.

alloys were exposed to molten fluorides under highly oxidizing conditions,

Hastelloy N was much morejcorrosion resistant,

Corrosion Mechanisms

In polythermal flowingwsaltrsystems, corrosion commonly involves
temperature-gradient mass transfer, Figure 10 shows a schematic of

this process. For monometailic systems, the constituents of the salt

or impurities may react w1th one or more constituents of the loop

mater1al to form salt-soluble compounds. For example, the following
reactions may occur in a salt containlng UF, and FeF, exposed to
Hastelloy N; e
UF, + Cr - CrF, + UF; , | (1)
‘FeFy + Cr - CrFp + Fe . . (2)

The equilibrium constant:ofﬁCorrosion reaction {1) is temperature
dependent. Thus, when the salt is forced to circulate through a tempera-
ture'gradient products from the reverse reaction may deposit in the

cooler regions of the system. Since the equlllbrlum constant for the

" chemical reaction 1ncreases-w1th increasing temperature, the chemical

activity or concentration of the attacked element in the container mate-
rial will decrease at hlgh temperatures and 1ncrease at low temperatures;

that is, in the hotter regions the alloy surface becomes depleted and

metal from the 1nterlor of the wall dlffuses toward the surface, and in
- the colder regions. the alloy surface becomes enriched with the diffusing
' -fmetal There is, of course, an’ 1ntermediate temperature at which the’

- initial surface composztlon of the structural metal and the attacked ele-
 ment is in equllibrium w1th the salt If the temperature dependence of the

at which the metal diffuses into the cold region wall. Many examples -
of temperature-gradient mass transfer by fluoroborate salt systems
contained in Hastelloy N were cited in the introduction.

In the system under study — Haynes alloy No. 25-Hlastelloy N-
fluoroborate salt — an additional mass<transfer mechanism is present
which is termed dissimilar-alloy or activity gradient mass transfer. While
this has been studied in detail for several alkali metal systems, little

. the presence of different alloys'in the same fluid and is not contingent

on the presence of a temperature gradlent Figure 11 shows a schematic
of this process. The sequence of events in dlSSlmllar—alloy'mass
transfer involves removal of an element from one material and deposition
on a second material; that is, movement from a region of high activity
_to‘one of low activity. Examples of dissimilar metal interactions are

actions become very compllcated

In the present studies, chromlum‘and cobalt were removed from the

'Haynes alloy No. 25 by'reactlon with salt and were deposited on the
Hastelloy N.  This occurred because of the smaller concentration of those

elements (lower activity) in the Hastelloy N, This activity gradient

mechanism would have occurred without artemperature gradient. However,

the effect of the temperature gradient was also evidenced by heavier
deposition of chromium and cobalt on the colder Hastelloy'N surfaces.
Asrmentioned earlier, ne large cobalt concentration gradient could
be obtained from the Hastelloy N hot leg specimens, and more cobalt was
found on the cold leg spe01mens than in the hot leg. Thus, it appears

‘that the net result of the cobalt depositing on the Hastelloy N due to
_the activity'gradient ﬁechanisﬁ.and the cobalt mass transfer due to the

removal. However, this gradient may not be as large as expected and may
disappear if the chromium diffuses to the surface as fast as it is removed
and possible even at a slightly higher rate.l? However , the chromium
gradient was almost completely masked in this system for the above reasons
and by the chromium deposition from the Haynes alloy No. 25 back to the
hot leg. As mentioned ea.r]ier, the microstrucﬁure (Fig. 8) does show
evidence of some depletion at the edge of the specimen, but the overall
chromium composition of the specimen showed little change. Nickel and
iron, if removed from the Hast'elloy.N, would be predicted to depoéit on
the Haynes alloy No. 25 by virtue of the activity gradient mechanism,

. This was not observed experimentally, although the effects may have been

swamped by the greater rate of ‘chromium and cobalt transfer.

Significance'of Haynes Alloy No. 25 in the
Hastelloy N Test System .

The solid line at Fig. 12 shows the time dependence of experimental
weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens exposed to salt in loop NCL-13.
Note that all specimens showed a net weight gain during the first 200 hr,
As mentioned earlier, in pemperature;gradient mass~=transfer systems
specimens in_hot‘portions ef the loop are expected to lose weight while
those in the cold secﬁicnjshould gain weight. chever,.after this
initial period of weight gain the samples in the hot leg started losing
weight, while the cold leg specimens continued to gain weight. This
initial weight gain lends credence to the idea that most of the cobalt
that transferred from.the"Heyees alloy No. 25 did so initially. It is
noted that our experlmental.welght changes reflected this deposition
from the Haynes alloy No. 25. The actual weight loss in an all
Hastelloy N syetem.would be larger and the actual weight gain would be
smaller, Thus, a constant factor was calculated and subtracted from
all our welght changes, resultlng in the dotted line. This constant
factor was calcelated u31ng an iterative trial-and-error method to obtain

a mass balance on the syetemefieting the following equation:

CONCLUSIONS

1. Haynes alloy No..25 in the fluoroborate salt-Hastelloy N alloy
test system suffered damage by loss of significant amounts of cobalt
and chromium, which migrated to the Hastelloy N by virtue of activity-
gradient and tempereture-gradient mass transfer,

.2. Haynes alloy No. 25 is more susceptible than Hastelloy N to
attack by the fluoroboraste mixture.

3. Because of the relatively small emount of Haynes alloy No. 25
in the system (one-ninth the surface area of Hastelloy'N), the early
presence of this material did not compromise, beyond the normal 10%
variation in quantitative data, experiments on the preeent monometallic

Hastelloy N'system.
