'THERMAL STABILITY OF TITANIUM-MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N AT 650 AND 760°C

C. E. Sessions and E..E. Sté,nsbury1

ABSTRACT

We have investigated the influence of small titanium
~ additions on the thermal stability of Ni-12% Mo-7% Cr-0.07% C.

' The mechanical properties at 650°C (tensile tests at 0.002/min
strain rate and creep tests at 40,000 psi stress) were mea-
‘sured for four heats of this alloy'w1th titanium contents
from 0.15 to 1.2%. Solution annealing temperatures were 1177 -
“or 1260°C, and subsequent precipitation heat treatments were
conducted at 650 and 760°C. Titanium increases the stebility
of a complex MC-type carbide. At low titanium levels the
MC carbide is stable at 650°C but is unstable at 760°C, where
an MpC-type carbide is precipitated, resulting in inferior
properties. For the higher titanium concentrations the
MC carbide is stable on aging at 760°C and results in excel-
lent properties after a solution anneal at 1177°C. However,
high-titanium alloys are significantly less ductile if they
are solution amnealed at 1260°C and aged at either 650 or
760°C. The heat with the lowest carbon content (0.04% C)
was most resistant to property ‘changes on aglng up to
10, 000 hr at both 650 and 760 c.

 

INTRODUCTION

We are concerned'witﬁfmbdifying the composition of Hastelloy N for

better perfbrmance as a material for a mplten-salt thermal breeder reac-

. tor w1th an expected llfetlme of 30 years or more. The ex1st1ng
| Hastelloy N developed primarlly at Oak Ridge over the past 10 to

12 years functioned well in an 8-Mw(t) reactor built five years ago and

ff0perated over the past three years.2 However, this reactor operated at

650°C, and-when it was construéted very littlé was known about the
problem of high-temperature irradia.tion da.ma.ge‘ to this alldy. Since
that time we have observed® damsage by thermal neutrons on meny mate-
rials, including nickel-base alloys such as Hastelloy N, in which a
larger deterioration in properties is observed than in most iron-base
alloys. -Thus , an alloy with greater resistance to radiation damage is
needed. )

. We found that small additions of reactive elements, notably tita-
‘nium, can significantly enhance the ﬁostirradiation'creep-rupture life
and ductility.4 Thus, we have proceeded with the development of &
modified Hastelloy N conteining titanium. This report represents the
phase of the program concerned .with the effect of thermal and mechani-
cal treatment on the creep and tensile behavior of these experiménta.l

specimen was designed. Specimens were solution annealed in.argon end
aged in stainless steel capsules that had been evacuated and backfilled
with argon. Conventional tensile measurements were carried out ﬁsing
an Instron tensile machined equipped with a specimen furnace. Two
Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples were used with a proportioning con-
troller to keep the test specimen Va.t 650 = 3°C.

The mitrostructures developed during aging were studied by optical
and electron transmission miecroscopy, extraction replication, and
scanning 'microscopy. In addition, precipitated phé,ses present in cer-
tain alloys were identified by x-rey diffraction using the Debye- |
Scherrer technique on precipitates extracted electrolytically with a
methanol-10% HC1l solﬁ;tion.r Details of the microstructure exsmination
have been répbi'ted,5 ‘and the alloying effects of titanium have been
summarized.® We shall concern ourselves here with the detailed mechani-
cal property response to heat treatment and a limited discussion of
’ miérostructures revealed in optica;l meta.llbgraphy.

Because of the large number of variables 1ncluded in this study
and the attempt to measure ‘the ccmplicated and very subtle differences

introduced by titanium.addltions, these experiments were statistically

designed as a full factorial replication7.including the variables in
Table 2. The purpose of this experimental design was to prcvide better
evaluation and separation’ofrthe'influence of the specific variables on

the tensile property response. Results of these statistical analyses

" have been discussed previously.®

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Typical results of the influence of preage thermal-mechanical
treatment, aging time, and temperature‘on the tensile and creep proper-
ties at 650°C will be presented first. The phase identification'will
then be presented and discussed in light of the mechanical property
changes. Strength and ductility values for all specimens tested are
given in’the Appendix;r | ' '

- Effect of Preaging:onrthe Mechanical Properties

Flgure 2 shows the yield strength (0 2% offset) and total elonga-
tion values for the three preage treatments investigated. Solution
annealing 1 hr at 1260° C lowered the strength and increased the ductil-
ity at each titanium level as compared to a l-hr solution anneal at
1177°C. Prestraining 10% at room temperature after allphr 1177°C solu-
tion anneal doubled the hlgh—temperature yield strength and reduced the

T{'ductility by one-third The yield strength increased'with titanium

content for these unaged specimens, but the tensile ductility was not

| appreciably affected by the titanium content for these pretest

treatments.

Effect of Aging on Ductility

Changes in tensile elongation with aging time are shown in Figs. 3
through 5 for both aging temperatures. Aging at either 650 or 760°C
after a solution anneal at 1177°C enhanced the ductility at 650° °C for
the 1.2% Ti heat and decreased it for the 0.15% Ti heat. After a l-hr
solution anneal at 1260°C, the 1.2% Ti heat lost ductility on aging at
either aging temperature to the same extent as did the 1owest-titanium
‘level, 0.15%. Thus, the larger grain size or greater‘amcunt'of 501ute
in solid solution after the 1260°C treatment maede the high-titanlum
heat susceptlble to a detrimental aging reaction to which it was immune
~ after the 1177°C anneal. ,

The effect of prestraining on the aging behavior is shown in
Fig. 5. Samples were solution annealed 1 hr at 1177°C, prestrained 10%
&t room temperature, aged at either 650 or 760°C, and then tested at
650°C. The verietion in tensile ductility with aging time and titanium
was similar to that shown in Fig. 3 for samples not prestrained; how-

ever, the overall ductility was lower for the prestrained material.

AGING TIME (hr)

Fig. 6. Yield Strength Changes as a Function of Aglng Time and
Titanium Content for a l-hr Solution Anneal at 1260°C.

760°C the largest strength increase occurred for the 1.2% Ti heat.
The intermediate (0.45%) titanium heat exhibited the smallest change in
yield strength for aging at either temperature. The lower'yield

‘strength values in this 0 45% Ti heat were most likely due to the lower
carbon concentratlon for this heat (0.04% as compared to O. 07%) .

The changes in yleld strength for samples solutlon annealed at

'1177 ¢ before aging (not plotted) were comparsble in most cases to
*those shown in Flg.;6.- For the l 2% Ti heat solution annealed at 1177°C

and aged at 650°C, the yield strength at 650°C peaked at 46,000 psi
after 1500 hr aglng and exhiblted classical overaging by decreasing to

:.hi37 500 psi after lO 000 hr The increase in strength on aging the
1. 2% Ti heat at 760°C after the 1177 C solution anneal was appreciably

lower than for the 1260°C anneal ' The yield strength peaked:at
41,000 psi after 1500 hr and decreased to 37,000 psi after 10,000 hr.

 
 

10

The strength of the prestrained alloys did not increase on aging.
The 1.2% Ti heat actually showed a yield strength decrease with aging
time at both 650 and 760°C, and the inf.ermedia.te- and low-titanium
heats did not show any large cha;nge,in yield strength after aging.

1.2% Ti levels, as previously discussed, but the 1.2% Ti heat actually
deteriorated in uniform elongetion from 35 to approximately 26% with
aging time. Therefore, to account for the high total elongation
observed, the nonuniform elongation must have increased to compensate
for the observed decrease in uniform stré.ih. That is to say, for this
heat, which exhibited the maximum ductility after this particular treat-
ment, we found & change in the stress-strain relationship induced by
precipitation. The change corresponded to an increase in yield strength,
an increase in reduction in ares., and an increase in total eloriga.tion;
however, it corresponded to a deérease in ultimate tensile strength and

uniform elongation.

are similer for the various heets as solution annealed at 1177°C.

Aging 1500 hr at 650°C increases yield strength more than at 760°C.
However, the'ductility decréase.on eging was approximately the same for
the two sging temperatures. These trends in streﬁgth and ductility
were found for heats 466-535, 466-541, and 466-548. For heat 467-548
(1.2% Ti) we measured the effect of using a higher solution anneal tem-
perature (1260°C) on the agihg response. Aging 1500 hr at 760°C
increased the room-temperature yield strength from 36,000 to 60,000 psi
and decreased the creep elongation from 68 to 42% strain. This change
in the room-temperature tensile behavior for the 1260°C solution anneal
was larger than that found after annesling at 1177°C. However, the
microstructural differences found for this high-titénium (1.2% Ti,
467-548) heat are significant and have been discussed previously.® The
point is that, regardless of the differences in microstructﬁre, the

room-temperature properties are similer.

Creep Properties After 3000 hr of Aging

The effect of titanium content on the creep properties of solution-
annealed and aged alloys was measured for 36 specimens. Each test was
conducted at 650°C and under 40,000 psi stress so that the rupture lives
and creep rates indicate the effects of aging. Creep ductility in these
tests reflected the influence of strain rate, which varied with the
strength of the alloy under this constent-load creep test. The ductili-
ties, rupture lives, and creep rates are given in Figs. 10 and 11 for

some of the treatments used.

Effect of Preage Treatments

For each alloy, except the 1.2% Ti heat, the lowest rupture life
and highest elongation corresponded to samples solution annesled at-the
higher temperature (i.e., 1 hr at 1260°C). In most instances the lowest
secondary creep rate, maximm rupture life, and minimum ductility corre-
sponded to the samples prestrained 10% at room temperature. |

Effect of Aging Temperature

In most cases (10 of 12 tests) the rupture life after aging 3000 hr
at 760°C was reduced by from 20 to 90% as compared with the unaged sam-

ples. Correspondingly, the'creep rates were significantly increased by a

 factor of 3 to_lQ,‘depending_on the alloy and heat treatment. The creep

ductility of the samples aged 3000 hr at 760°C ranged from 6't9 37%,

'Flg 11. Effect of Titanium Content and Heat Treatment on the '
40 OOO—psi Creep Elongation at 650°C.

The titanium content influenced the magnitude of the aging effect.
For most treatments, the alloy with the highest titanium content
exhibited the smallest property deterioration after aging. However,
‘solution annealing for 1 hr at 1260°C led to creep property changes on
aging that were quite significant for all levels of titanium.

Comparison of Tensile and Creep Results

Table 4 lists the heat treatments for each heat of material that
corresponded to the maximum and minimum property value found in creep
and tensile testing of the samples aged 3000 hr. Since three treatments
‘were included in this study-[i.e,, solution anneals of (1) 1 hr at 1177°C
(2) 1260°C, and (3) 1 hr at 1177°C plus 10% prestrain at room temperature]
the treatment that is not listed under either minimum or meximum in
Table 4 would result in properties intermediate between the minimum and

maximum values.

In each case the maximum yield strength and maximum ultimate ten-
sile strength at 650°C were found for the 10% prestrained samples. The
minimum yield and ultimate strengths were found for the 1260°C treatment.
The minimum and maximum tensile ductilities corresponded to the strongest
and weakest alloys in tensile tests, with one exception, the 0.45% Ti
heat.

In creep the maximum resistance to rupture (meximum rupture life)
corresponded to the prestrained sample in only two of the fbur heats,
but prestrained samples crept at & lower rate in three of the four cases.
Notably, the 1.2% Ti heat exhibited the minimum and maximum creep resis-
tance (as measured by the creep rate) for the 1177 and 1260°C anneals,
respectively. This indicates that creép of this higher titanium heat
was affected more by solution annealing treatment than by 10% cold
.working The minimum and maximum creep ductzllties of the other alloys
corresponded to the prestrained and to the 1260°C annealed material,

respectively.

Results for Aged Samples

The prestrained material aged 3000 hr at 650°C exhibited the
maximum yield strength for each heat. The minimﬁm yieid stréngth corre-
spdnded to either 1177 or 1260°C samples aged 3000 hr at 760°C; depending
on the alloy. The maximum ultimate strength was for prestrained samples
aged 3000 hr at 650°C with one exception, the 0.15% Ti heat. The lowest
ultimate strength (UTS) was found for the 1260°C treatment; at lower
tltanium level an aging treatment.of 3000 hr at 650°C caused the lowest
UTS, and at the higher titanium levels aging 3000 hr at 760°C caused the
lowest UTS. The rupture life was & maximum for prestrained samples
aged at 650°C, snd the treatment that produced the minimum rupture 1ife
differed for each alloy. An intereéting point is that the 0.15% Ti
heat gave both the maximum aﬁd.the minimum rupture life for'the'larger
grain size 1260°C treatment, depending on whether it was aged at 650 or
760°C.

Phases Idéentified in Aged Alloys

~ Table 5 lists the phases identified by Debye-Scherrer x-ray dif-
fraction analysis of electrolytically extracted precipitate particles
after 3000 hr of aging at the indicated temperatures. In the 0.15% Ti

‘heat a combination of MC and M.C type phases was present, but at 760°C

only the MpC carbide was found. At the intermediate titanium level

 (0.45%) only MC was present at 650°C, while at 760°C a weak trace of MC

and strong lines for M>C were found. At the highest_titanium level
investigated (1.20%) the MC structure was present after aging at either
temperature. Thus, we conclude that the higher titanium content has

stabilized the MC-type carbide at higher aging temperatures.

Initial Microstructures

 

The effect of solution annealing at 1177 or 1260°C on the grain

- size for three of the four alloys is shown in Fig. 12, Annealing 1 hr
at 1177°C did not produce & single-phase alloy for most of these heats.
In the alloys containing 0.15 and 1.2% Ti after an 1177°C anneal, large
stringers of second-phase particles were evident. The 0.27 and 0.45% Ti
heats were virtually single phase after the 1177°C heat treatment.

After 1 hr at 1260°C the grain size of each heat was 2 to 4 times that
found after the 1177°C anneal. Also, fewer preéiﬁitate particles and
stringers were present after 1 hr at 1260°C.

Microstructures Developed During Aging

Typical structures obtained.by interference contrast microséopy
are shown in Fig. 13. This figure compares the precipitate distributions
for samples solution annealed at 1177°C and aged 10,000 hr at either
650 or 760°C. These photographs were taken near the fracture sites of

tensile samples tested at 650°C after sging at the indicated temperatures.

After aging at 650°C the precipitate was generally finer, and the con-
centration of precipitate near grain boundaries appeared to be fairiy
heavy, particulafly for the low-titanium alloj. After aging 10,000 hr
at 760°C the precipitate was rather coarse, and the concentration of
precipitate near the grain bouhdary'was lower than fhat found at 650°C.
The precipitate within the grain boundary was also coarée, &s shown by
the micrographs of the 0.27 and 0.45% Ti heats in Fig. 13. Little pre-
cipitation occurred in.the'l.z% Ti heat, since the stringers evident in
Fig; 13 were actually present to some extent even before aging; this was
shown for the as-solution-annealed condition in Fig. 12.

Microstructures developed during aging 10,000 hr after a l-hr
solution anneal at 1260°C are shown in Fig. 14. These structures are
typical also of those developed in 1500 and 3000 hr of aging and indi-
cate a large variation in optical microstructure with titanium content.
Alloys with lower titanium contents exhibited relatively coarse precipi-
tate distributions. The 1.2% Ti alloy showed bands of precipitate
stringers after aging at 650‘C. Apparently, the stringers present
initially along the hot-working direction of the rod stock were not com-
pletely eliminated even though the material was solution annealed at
1260°C. During subsequent aging these residusl second-phese particles
coarsened. Thus, the 1bngitudinal cross section of these aged alloys
exhibited a banded structure, which is similar to that found in the cold-
worked rod before solution annealing. In the 0.45 and 1.2%'Ti heats
during aging at 650°C, however, some additional precipitation occurred
on both subgrain and grain boundaries. ' |

The microstructures developed at 760°C after e 1260°C solution

after the 1177°C anneal and 760°C age (Fig. 13). For the 1.2% Ti heat,

very little effect on the structure of the 0.15% Ti heat, but the 1.2% Ti
heat showed much more precipitate in the prestrained samples (Fig. 15)
than in samples aged without prestraining (Fig. 13). In the prestrained

(the platelets are actually a precipitete on stacking faults,?! as
mentioned prev1ously) This apparent enhancement in formation of
stacking fault precipitate produced by straining this 1.2% Ti alloy

" pefore aging is consmstent’with the effect of prior straining on forma-
~tion of stacking fault prec1p1tates in niobiumpdoped stainless steels

as reported by Silcock and ‘I‘unstall11 and Naybour.l? However, some
differences in the effect of strain on the tendency to precipltate on
stacking faults in steels and in this alloy are discussed in another

Fracture of Samples Tested in Creep

The fracture appearance of creep samples tested after solution

‘annealing at 1177°C and aging 3000 hr at 760°C is compared in Fig. 16.

The rupture lives (64, 135, and 1335 hr) and the total_elongation values
(9. 5 16.7, and 36.8%) of samples with these fractures increased progres-
smvely'with 1ncreasing titanium content. The - fracture appearance con-
firms the measured ductility trends, since the fracture mode exhibits a
trans1tion'w1th increas1ng titanium content from 1ntergranular fracture
for the O. 15% Ti heat [Fig. lﬁ(a)] to transgranular for the 1.2% Ti

heat [Fig. 16(c)]. The intermediate titanium content (O. 45% Ti) also

: _failed in a predOminantly transgranular fracture mode; however, the
“tips of the fractured grains [Fig. 16(Db)] show regions that appear to

have recrystallized during the creep test. Nevertheless, the creep
elongation of this O. 45% Ti heat after the 760° C heat treatment was only
16.7%, which indicates that the apparent recrystallization that occurred

 during creep testing at 650°C did not signlficantly enhance the ductility.
That is, other heat treatments of this 0.45% Ti heat yielded post-age
creep’ elongation values appreciably greater than 16. 7% even though they

, showed no evidence of recrystallization

In Fig. 16 it is- also apparent that the grain size is smallest for

“the 1.2% Ti heat. Although the fracture was primarily transgranular in

that heat, many intergranular cracks have opened up along the gage
lenéth'in_contrast to the alloys with lower titanium concentrations.

Apparently, the grain bonndary structure in the higher titanium heat

inhibits the propagation of”intergranular cracks even though the nuclea-

tion of cracks in this alloy is apperently quite easy.

Another comparison of fractures for creep tests after various aging
treatments is given in Fig._l? for three heats with different titanium
contents. The total creep elongations for the Sampies shown in
Fig. 17(a), (b), and (c) were 8.3, 42.1, and 24.5%, respectively. Thus,

the alloy with the intermediate titanium content [0.45% Ti, Fig. 17(b)]

was the most ductile of-the-three alloys, in contrast to the results in

Fig. 16. The grain size and the amount of precipitation evident at this

" magnification is greater in Fig. 17(a) and (c) than in Fig. 17(b). As

in Fig. 16, the incidence of intergranular cracks is higher in the most
ductile alloy, Fig. 17(b), than in the otheér materials. The fracture
mode is a mixture of transgranular and 1ntergranular fracture in
Fig. 17(a) and (c) and is ‘transgranular in Fig. 17(b) |

An influence of agingrtrme;at 760°C on the post—age fracture
appearance for the,0.45%*Ti heat is found by comparing Fig. 17(v)
(1500 nr at 760°C) with Fig. 16(b) (3000 hr at 760°C). These two sam-
ples from the same heat were both solution annealed at 1177°C; aged,

;_andithen.creep tested at 40,000 psi and 650°C. The creep properties
(5% hr rupture life and 42.1% elongation) for the sample aged 1500 hr

at 760°C [Fig. 17(b)] were-mubn:better-than-the properties (135 hr

~ rupture life and 16.7% elongation) obtained after aging 3000 hr at 760°C.

Similari&,-the fracture'appéaranoe'is more transgranular and the amount

of grain deformation is much greater for the samples aged only 1500 hr
[Frig. 17(v)]. .Although a s1gn1f1cant difference was found in creep
, properties after aging 1500 and 3000 hr at 760°C, the optical microscopy

did not reveal any 1arge differences in structure. This effect of aging

. time between 1500 and 3000 hr at 760°C is rather surprising since normally

aging follows a logarithmic rate, which would give small changes for &
factor of 2 difference 1n aging time, but it should change 81gn1ficantly

for a tenfold difference in aging time. NevertHeless, this observed

large difference in ereeﬁ'behavior between 1500 and 3000 hr of aging

 was confirmed by the tensile ductility for this 0.45% Ti heat, as

shown in Fig. 3, p. 7. The 650°C tensile ductility decreased from about
38 to 21% between 1500 and 3000 hr of aging at 760°C. Thus in the

0.45% Ti heat, ev1dently either the type of precipitate present or its

amount and distribution differed significantly between 1500 and 3000 hr

- of exposure at a temperature of 760°C (phases were not identified in the

samples aged 1500 hr).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the effects of titanium content, solution
annealing temperature, aging temperature, and aging time on the mechani-
cal properties of modified Hastelloy N at 650°C. In the solution-

- annealed condition the 0.002/min yield strength increased and the

ductility was approximately constant with increasing titanium content

from 0.15 to 1.2%. Aging“andtprestraining both generally increased the

~yield strength, but the changes in ductility during aging depended on

(1) alloy content, (2) amnealing temperature, and (3) aging temperature.

~ Phase identiflcation of electrolytically extraced precipitates indi-
eated two types of carbides present, An M>C-type was favored in heats
with low titanium contents_or elloyS'eged at the higher'temperature,
760°C; An MC-type carbide was favored at higher titanium contents or

'fbr'alloys'with'a given titanium coneentration aged at'the'lewer temper-

ature, 650°C. Thus, the titanlum.content determined the carbide type,

-: whether MaC or MC. The carbide type, its stability, and its morphology

'.'eubsequently influenced the deformation and fracture in creep and tensile

teets. Correlations of microstructures and high-temperature mechanical

| ﬁproperties as influenced by the carbon and titanium contents have pre-

1 :v1ously been investigated 14

Increasing ﬁhe titanium content resulted in improved post-age
properties. Apparently, the M:C carbide precipitate was mbre detrimen-
tal to ductility than was the MC carbide precipitate. However, certain
~distributions of MC carbides were also detrimental to the ductility.
This was indicated by the 1.2% Ti alloy, which lost ductility and
increased its strength on aging after.the 1260°C solution anneal. Since
~ only MC carbides were idehtified in this alloy, the strengthening and
 embrittlement are attributed to the precipitation on stecking faults.
Correlations of microstructures and mechanical properties for stacking
fault precipitates have also been made for stainless steels,?5,16
Inconel,l”? and Hastelloy N.18,19 |
| Several additional points should be made from these results.
The alloy with the lowest carbon content (i.e., heat 466-548) gener-
“ally had the lowest strength and highest ductility. This low carbon
alloy,rhcﬁevef, did shcﬁ a pronounced difference in aging response at
650 and 760°C, which we attribute to the fact that different carbides
were precipitated at the two aging temperatures (i.e., MC at 650°C and
MoC at 760°C). D

Overaging could be expected in most of these alloys before 3000 hr
at 760°C, as indicated from the peak in yield strength at 1500 hr in
Fig. 6, p 9.

The comparison of creep and tensile properties indicated that the

higher solution anneal, which increases the grain size and amount of

_solutelin solution, actually produces the lowest yield strength. The

weakest alloys in creep (as measured by the highest secondary creep rate)
were found for the 1177°C anneal, which produces a smaller grain size

relative to the structure prdduced at 1260°C. This dependence of low

- yield stfength on 1arge grain size and of low creep resistance on small

grain size is typical of the effects of grain size on the strength of

alloys at elevated test temperatures. At such temperatures, inter-

granular fracture rather than transgranular fracture is favored.

Of the treatments 1nvestigated cold working 10% at room tempera-

- ture after a l-hr solution anneal at 1177°C had the greatest effect on
raising the strength and lowering the ductility, both before and after

aging. An exception to this was found for the 1.2% Ti heat, which
exhibited the lowest post-age tensile and creep ductility after a 1260°C
solution anneal and 760°C ege.' Semples that showed this large ductility
loss had a high concentration of the platelet-type stacking fault
precipitate. ' '

The heat treatments 1nvestigated produced variations in the high-
temperature ductility between 5 and 50%, yet the significant p01nt is

that most of these treatments change the room-temperature properties
only slightly. The irony, however, is that these subtle microstructural

modifications caused bj titanium additions have affected the cfeep
behavior of this material even more than we found fram this systematic
look at tensile behav1or. However, testlng in creep does not give a
constant rate of defqrmation,'and_the strain rate sensitivity of the
ductility would have made it more difficult to separate effects'of‘aging
time and'temperature than it°has been for this tensile evaluation How-
ever, the creep properties follow similar trendS‘W1th precipitate type

" and distribution and are, in fact most important in reactor applica-
~ tions of this alloy. | |
