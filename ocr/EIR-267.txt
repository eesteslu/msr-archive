derent fraction being 82_. The length of the i1rradiation time
has an important role on the chemical states of radiosulphur.
An oxldation process concerning 82_ was observed as the irra-
diation progressed. The effect of post-irradiation heating
above and below the melting point of NaCl was investigated. By

55

high temperature heating an evolution of volatile S was
observed. After melting the preponderent form remains 82—
though an oxidatlon process occurs. The effect of temperature
irradiation on the sulphur distribution was also examined. At
low temperature irradiation the predominance of 82“ and S° was

observed.
The present work gives the preliminary results obtained on
n-irradiated NaCl, the simplest component of the molten
chlorides fast reactor, which project has been described
recently in various papers by Tabe et al.(l’z). As the
chlorides of U-238 and Pu-239 diluted by NaCl are the selec-
ted components for the fused salt reactor, the n-reactions of

chlorine must be taken into account.

In a relatively high neutron flux the most important nuclear

reactions of natural chlcrine are as follows:

But much more important from the point of view of the chemical

properties of the system, are the following reactions:

The description of the "chlorine burn-up" given by Taube(g)

gives a good illustration of all these processes.

During reactor operation an important part of the fission pro-
ducts are gaseous and can be removed continuously, cthers form

chlorides and remain in the salt, while cothers will precipitate
(1)

as metals . The excess chlorine produced in the system can

react with the strongest reducing agent present UCl, forming

5
UCl4 which in the pure form is highly corrosive.

At the same time it can be assumed that UClu will react
rapidly with any short-lived oxidising species produced under

the intense fission fragments irradiation of the salt.

If the calculations about the evolution of chlorine from the

ning tne sulphur. The (n,p) reaction on Cl will produce
at a mean concentration up to a few thousand ppM in the salt
which depends upon the isotoplc concentration of the chlorine
e.g. separated Cl-37. An interaction between UCl3 and sulphur
is expected to take place. It may be supposed that 358 leads
to the precipitation of U as US. An attack of structural

materials by 358 can also take place.

The chemical state of BbS in neutron irradiated sodium chloride

The aim of this’work 1s to give some information about the
sulphur chemical states formed in the NaCl lattice by

5501 (n,p)BSS nuclear reaction. For this reason we have per-
formed experiments concerning the influence of irradiation
time, and of the post-irradiation high temperature heating on

the chemical sulphur distribution.

The chemical state of radiosulphur obtained by the reaction
5501 (n,p)ﬁBS in the alkali chlorides has been the object of
many Studies(Bulj). However, the most recent studies have

proved that the alkall chlorides are systems of an unexpected

complexity. The complexities are coming from the presence of
a large concentration of hydroxide ions normally found in
alkali chloride crystals as a result of the hydrolysis of

the salt(lu’l5).
55

In addition, a large sensitivity of the

(11,12,16,17)

recoil S to experimental conditions was observed

Generally the radiochemical method used, involved solution of
the crystals before analysis, usually in an aqueous solvent.
This means that the relation of the crystal precursors to the
products found affer solution depends on the reactions of the
crystals species with the solvent or with point defects formed

by irradiation (e.g. V centres) during solution.

Recently interesting results concerning sulphur chemical states

have been published(lS’lg). 358-

Using different methods of
specles separation and especially non-aqueous medium it was
possible to identify the 82" and S° precursors but not those

no oxidation was observed in liquid ammonia-cyanide or agueous

solutlion in an acid medium even in the absence of both air

and carriers invariably lead to complete conversion of all

active sulphur into sulphate Since sulphide ions are
known to be stable in water it is concluded that point defects
produced by irradiation in the crystal can oxidise all sulphate

EXPERIMENTAL
Sodium chloride "Merck" reagent was heated for 60 hrs. at 200 °C
in an oven under the vacuum. The dried samples of 100 mg sealed
in evacuated (JLO_Ll torr) quartz tubes were irradiated near the
core of the "Saphir" reactor (swimming pool) for different

12n cmﬁgs_l and M,3-1012

Reactor irradiations were carried out at about (estimated only)

2_ =1

periods at a neutron flux of 5-10 n cm °s

150 °C and -186 °C. After irradiation the samples were 'cooled!

for 8 days to allow the decay of guNa.

The method of j5S~-speoies separation

 

The crushing of the irradiated ampoule was made in a special
device from which the air was removed by passing a nitrogen
stream containing oxygen of 10 ppM. After crushing, a gentle
stream of nitrogen was allowed to flow for about 10 minutes.
The gases evolved were collected in cooled traps of containing
0,1 NaOH solution.

The irradiated salt was dissolved in 2 m KCN solution containing
carriers of 82_, CNS 8032_, 8042—. For the dissolution care
was not taken to exclude the oxygen completely although the
nitrogen gas was passed continuously through the system. The
solution from the traps containing the gases evolved in the
system was oxidised with bromine and nitric acid in the presence
of Nazsou (5 mg in 3) evaporated and the sulphur was precipi-
tated as barium sulphate.

For the

sulphate precipitates corresponding to each S-species were

separated on the welghed paper disc in a demountable filter.
The dried separated precipitates were weighed and the activity
of the samples was measured under a thin-window Geiger counter.

All measurements were made in duplicate with and without alu-

Post irradiation high temperature heating

 

The sealed irradiated ampoules were heated in an electric oven
at 77000 for 2 hrs. and 830°C for about 5 minutes and then
crushed in a closed system under nitrogen stream. The descrip-

tion of the method used by us can be seen in Fig. 1

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

 

A comparison of the S-distribution obtained by us and by other
authors 1is given in Table 1. As can be seen the results are
practically the same using the cyanide method even if the con-
ditions of dissolution are different. Unfortunately it was not
possible to make a comparison of the irradiation conditions.

The dissolution in vacuo in an alcoholic cyanide solution gave
exactly the same distribution as the analytical method using

the cyanide and carriers. This shows that the carriers do not
affect the distribution of the active sulphur, on the contrary
theyprevent the oxlidation process that disturb the distribution.
The oxidising agents of sulphur can be Cl and Cl, entities which

species which by dissolution give the oxidised form. Dissolution
of the irradiated salt in the presence of a scavenger for Cl or

Cl. should avoid the oxidation. The experiments of Yoshihara(l6)

and Maddock(18)

showed that ethyl alcohcl can reduce but not
eliminate the oxidation. Using this solvent the zero valent
sulphur is lost. It was shown by Maddock that the cyanide
solution was doubly advantageous; to stabilise s as CNS  and

to act as a Cl or Clz_ scavenger.,

Effect of length of irradiation time

 

In order to find whether the irradiation time has any effect

on the behaviour of the radiosulphur the distribution of sulphur
as a function of the length of irradiation time was studied. The
results are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 2. The irradiation
time was varied between 2 and 99 hrs. As 1s seen in Table 2

S°7 remains the preponderent fraction independet from the irra-
diation time. This means that in a natural way the preponderent

5501 (n,p)BSS reaction can be 82".

state of sulphur following
Alternatively it can be supposed that a reduction of sulphur
takes place by capture of electrons arising from the discharge

of" F-centers,.

The results presented in Table 2 show that the sulphur distribu-
tion 1s influenced by the length of irradiation time. Thus the
yield of less than 20 per cent of oxidised forms for 2 hrs. of
irradiation increases to about 30 per cent for a longer time

(99 hrs). The increase of higher oxidation fraction is at the
expense of the sulphide. In the last case the fraction decreases
from about 70 to 50 per cent at the irradiation time mentioned
above. The fraction corresponding to elementary sulphur, about

10 per cent, seems to be not affected by the length of irradiation

time 1in the time interval studied by us.

It 1s remarkable that after 10 hrs. of irradiation the changes in
the chemical distribution of radiosulphur become rapid (Fig. 2).
As 1s seen the main effect of the irradiation time is the con-
version of part of the sulphide into the higher oxidised fraction.
This may be a consequence of radiation produced defects with oxi-

dising character.

It is also possible that either the concentration of the defects
responsible for the reduction of radiosulphur decreases with the
increase of the irradiation time or they are annihilated when new
traps are formed. The oxidation of radiosulphur with increase of
radiation damage concentration may be also due to the increase 1in
the positive charge on the sulphur as a result of interaction of
recolils with chlorine atoms. The same behaviour was found in the

case of post gamma irradiation K01(15>.

Even if the oxidising
process of radlosulphur can be attributed to the V-centers, the
presence of OH 1in the crystal must not be neglected. It was shown
that the sensitivity to the oxidation is enhanced by the presence
of OH suggesting that the radiolysis of OH can be responsible
for accelerating the oxidising process(21>. It must be added also
that in the target oxygen containing the product of radiolysis can
be an oxygen atom which acts as a deep electron trap. The electron
traps can be formed either by gamma radiolysis or be intially

present as crystal defects,

valency state 1t is possible to imagine only an electron trans-

neutral species. However, the interaction of chlorine entities

higher oxidation states. These entities in an oxidative hydrolysis

will produce sulphate and sulphite fractions.
13

Effect of post-irradiation heating

 

The effect of post irradiation high temperature heating (including
melting state) can be seen in Table 3 and 4, A comparison between
heated and unheated samples are made for irradiations of 2 hrs.
Table 3, 12 hrs. and 24 hrs. in Table 4. In Table % are also presen-
ted results on samples heated at a temperature below the melting

polnt of NaCl.

The results presented in Table 3 show that the high temperature
heating has only a slight influence on the 82— state, but 1t
affects the S° and higher oxidised forms (Souz_ + 8032_). A part
of radiosulphur was found under the volatile form. An escape of
radiosulphur from the crystals particularly at higher temperature
(T >400 O) was mentioned earlier(l7).

The proportion of volatile radiosulphur appears at the expense of
s and higher oxidised forms. The results show that with high
temperature heating above the boiling point of sulphur and above
melting point of NaCl the s® and 5t and/or SyClx receive suffi-
cient kinetic energy to migrate to the surface or even to escape

from the crystal and then collected as volatile radiosulphur.

Effect of irradiation time on post-irradiation melted sample

55

However, there are some differences in changes of S-chemical
distribution on heating below and above melting point of NaCl.

1t seems that for a relatively short time of irradiation (2 hrs)
only the sulphate and sulphite precursors account for the volatile

radiosulphur proportion,

The results presented in Table 4 show a change in the distribu-
tion of chemical forms of 358 for longer time of irradiation before
melting. On melting the s® value decreases up to 2% for a longer
time of 1rradiation and this corresponds to an increase of vola-
tile radiosulphur form. A slight influence of the irradiation

time on the yield of Sgd and higher oxidation forms may be also

observed.

However, the present data are not enough to give a definite picture
of these phenomena and we tried to represent in Fig. 3% the in-

55

fluence of irradiation time on the S-chemical distribution in
the post-irradiation melted NaCl. As is seen in Fig. 3 a slight
oxlidation process concerning Sg_ fraction occurs as the irra-
diation progresses. The increase of higher oxidation forms up

to about 10 hrs. 1s faster than the decrease of 82_ fraction.

It may be supposed that a part of s© passes to the higher oxi-
dation forms. However, a small and practically constant quantity
of 5° is found in the melt for longer irradiation time. The gas
evolution remains also practically constant. The oxidation process
concerning 82" tends to a pseudo-plateau value as the irradiation

progresses. This behaviour induces a pseudo-plateau in the increase

of the higher oxidation states yield.

It 1s possible that this arises from a significant decrease of
defects with oxidising character in melting process. Comparison
of these results and those presented in Fig. 2 shows that in the
melted sample the concentration of radiation damages has not the
same effect as in the non-melted sample. The supplementary infor-
mation about this can be obtained by studying the effect of high
temperature irradiation on the chemical distribution of radio-

sulphur.

Alternatively it 1s possible to suppose that in the melting state
the active oxidising agents have another nature than those in
heating below melting. The presence of oxygen can have a determinant
role 1in radiosulphur oxidation. At the melting point the formation
of sodlum oxides and consequently an oxidising environment may be

assumed.

Effect of reactor irradiation temperature on the chemical distri-

55

bution of S-species

The results obtalned on the chemical states of radiosulphur in
n-irradiated NaCl at about 423 K and 77 X are shown in Table 5.
The big proportion of active sulphur as 82- fraction for reactor
"normal" temperature (~150 OC) was confirmed by the last experi-

ments on the 32P obtained by 35Cl(n,u)BZP reactionCzB), The pre-
ponderent valence form was found to be phosphine. An evidence for

zero valent phosphorus was also obtained.

The low temperature irradiation (Table 5) leads to a distribution
of 5SS petween four valence states with the predominance of 82—
and S°. The results obtained by us for low temperature irradiation

agree with those obtained by J. Paptista and N.S. Marques for

KC1l single crystals(IS).

The comparison of results obtained by irradiation at~423 K and

77 K show that the higher oxidation fraction is lower (3 per cent)

for 77 K. It 1s remarkable that the sulphide fraction is lower

at 77 K than at U423 K. It is clear that the increase of &° form at

low temperature lrradiation is done at the expense of both sulphite

+ sulphate and sulfide fractions.

The low yield of higher oxidation forms may be explained by the
fact that an activation energy associated with some reaction to

f'orm SXCly presursors can prevent such kind of reaction.

The defects with oxidising and reducing character formed by low

temperature irradiation become important factors in determining the
sulphur precursors and thus the chemical distribution by dissolution.
it is possible to suppose that the low yield of higher oxidation

states 1s determined by the followlng reaction:

High temperatur irradiations (T >500 OC} are being looked at.
20

As in the low temperature irradiation as the F center concentra-
tion is higher a bigger fraction of higher oxidation states will
be reduced. It was shown that the thermal stability of F centers
(24)

1s markedly decreased in oxygen containing samples It may
be postulated that the bleaching of F centers leads to formation

of some oxygen centers with an oxidising action for sulphur.

The decrease of 82— fraction can be also explained by the pre-

sence of V centers as follows:

In conclusion the results obtained on the chemical distribution
of radiosulphur by dissolution may be explained by the existence
of crystal entities as 82—, SO, s¥ and/or SXCly and their inter-
action with oxidising and reducing defects formed by irradiation

or intially present in the crystals.
