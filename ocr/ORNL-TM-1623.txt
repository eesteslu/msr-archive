1. INTRODUCTION

) u L. ‘

One of the problems encountered during the early stages
of power Operation of the Molten Salt-Reactof»EXperiment wéé
that éome valves and filters in_tﬁe‘offfgas-syStem becéme‘
plugged. The plugs were analyzed and found to be of organic
COmposition. | - |

One possible éource of-organic material was the oil used
to lqbricate the salt circulating pﬁmp; If'indeedjthe pump 
were leaking oil inté the pump bowl, the maximum!credible"
Ieakage ﬁould be in the range of ls‘to 20 cc pérday;'

This experiment was designed to‘simuiate:the consequences
ofjthis maximum expected oil leakage and to test various
filter and adsorbent materials for removal of oil mist and

hydrocarbon vapors under these conditions. o &

filter materlals be conflned to those ea511y obtainable.

Materials tested were coarse nickel wool, Supreme #1 steel

and a M-S—A a1r.11ne Ultra Filter.

1nto the glass U- tube traps. This was tﬁe short fiber varlety

whlch packed very tlghtly when loading the traps._ Because the

pressure drop was in excess of 8 psig, thlS material was not

the three analysis points S-1, S-2, and S-3 rose to about
ten times previous levels. Obviously, much less cracking
had occurred in experiments 1 through 4. 'The average hydro-

carbon levels are summarized below:

; 3.3.1. Traps for experiments 5, 6A, and 6B contained
Supreme #OO steel wool in trap A, and Pyrex glass wool .~in
traps B and C. 0il recovery ranged from 68% to 72%:for.this
trap assembly. More efficient cracking of the oil resulted
in a decreased oil recovery. It should be noted that in each
of these runs only a small portion of the adsorbéble oil migt
reached trap C as shown in Table 1. f

3.3.2. Experiment 7 investigated the efficiency of a
commercial filter assembly. A M-S-A air line Ultra Filter
as shown in Fig. éfwas used. The particulate filter_element
is molded of a cellulose matrix with glass microfibers added
rto present a large capturing surface. The caftfidge holder..
is equipped with é drain plug through which 1iquids can be -
removed periodically. -

The M-S-A filter assembly was‘instélled in our apparatus,
replacing traps A, B, and C. |

4. CHARCOAL TRAP EFFICIENCY

The charcbal traps used‘in'ogr experiments were 1l-in.
I.D. glass Pyrex pipe packed with about 12 inchés of PCB
6X16 charcoal. |

Under reactor conditions, the decay of fission products
is expected to raise the temperature of a charcoal trap’of
the above dimensions to aboﬁt 100°c. Consequently, charcoal
traps were kepf at a\temperature of 100°C during our eiperi-
ments.

| A point of interest was the amount of hydrocarbons

necessary to saturate a known amount of charcbal at 100°cC.
Data for this investigatioh were obtainéd'simultanéously with
the filter material tests previously described. |

Charcoal trap #1 shown in Fig.-l was filled with a known

amount of charcoal. Sample'points S-1, S-2, and S-3 were
 

wi

-~

monitored with the hydrocarbon detector. .Saturation was

13

assuned when the hydrocarbon-level‘at S-2 started approaching

_.the level of S 1.

The first experiment madeuse of a packed_bed‘of'about 3 inches

of charcoal in a glass trap;,“The'weight of charcoal was
'approx1mate1y 6.0 grams per inch. The first evidence of satura-

- tion occurred at a total t1me of 30 hours. A second ‘test with

(

about 6 1nches of charcoal reached saturat1on in about 60 hours.

The hydrocarbon_levelratgs-l and S~2 averaged_700 ppm and 425

that as the heaVier-hydrocarbons were more strongly adsorbed

in the top of the trap, the 11ghter hydrocarbons were forced

carbons were forced out., Table 3,contains gas samples taken.

5. TESTING or MSRE PARTICLE FILTER
-Traps-A,-B,.and C mere“repiaced with a prototype of the

MSRE particle filter shown in Fig. 6. This filter was prepared

by personnel of the Reactor'Division. The filter consisted

of two‘Huyck_stainless'steel felt metal filters and a chamber

filled with long fiber:Fiberfrax. Pressure drop measurements

were made to determlne the maxXimum AP after the felt metal

filters were saturated w1th 0il mist. Measurements were made

using Hzo-and Hg manometers,

A further test was performed in which the felt metal
filters_were welded inside,a stainless steel pipe as shown
in Fig. 7. This assembly was placed inside a tube furnace
and tests were conducted at various temperatures.

L ,5.1.77Pressure Drop Data

Flgure 8 shows the pressure drop data obtalned from the

- MSRE partlcle f11ter test., After ‘24 hours the pressure

'g»remalned constant at 2 7 psig.' Attempts to blow the oil off

the felt metal fllters, by suddenly 1ncreas1ng the flow rate

.'of he11um to 8 liters/mln, were not successful The AP ‘would

-drop sl1ght1y, ‘when the flow rate was returned to 4 11ters/m1n,

but returned to its former level in less than 5 m1nutes.
The felt metal fllters were removed from the system and a

pressure drop across the Fiberfrax alone was determined. The

. 5.2, Pressure Drop Data of Felt Metal at
o ' - Elevated Temperatures

‘A filter assembly with the coarse and fine felt metal
filters welded in a stalnless steel pipe was fabricated as
shown in Fig._9. -The assembly was placed in a 5-in. tube
furnace. It was desirable to measure the AP of the felt
metal filters atfelevated temperatures, since during reactor
operations, the decay of fission products would possibly
raise the temperature of the fllter assembly. |

| Measurements at various temperatures were reproducible
as shown in Fig.p9, However, the maximum AP at 25 ¢ was
0.45 p51g compared w1th 2.7 ps1g measured in the previous
experiment. |

DOP measurements conducted by the Reactor Division on

the prototype-of'the MSRE particle filter showed'it‘to be

99. 98%:efficient. The welded filter assembly, when tested,
was only about 95%>efficient. Although there was no visible
ev1dence, cracks may,have been present in the welds of the
Welded.filterdassembly./

_ Thirty hours at 25°C were required before the felt metal
filters became saturated with oil mist. The transition'to the
maximum AP required oniy about one or two minutes. Upon
reaching maximum AP at room temperature, heat was applied to

the filter assembly. At a temperature of 150°C the AP

decreased sharply, returningaalmost to the minimum. When the

temperature was raised to 400°C and 600°C the AP rose slightly

in each Case but gave no indication of plugging. The rise in

AP associated with a rise in temperature can probably be attrib-

uted to an increase in the viscosity of helium. The viscosity

of helium at 25°C 1s_180 micropoises,’and at 600 C is 405

'micropoises. <

A total of 230 grams of Gulfspin-35 oil was inJected into

the heated reaction vessel during the prev1ous1y described

experiments. Upon termination of the experlments the reaction
vessel was cut apartforyvisual inSpection. The vessel con-
tained 0.5 grams of dry Carbon; no evidence of any liquid
hydrocarbons Was found., | |

The welded felt metal filter assembly was also cut apart;

again no liquid hydrocarbons were found

6.1. Excellent coOperation and much assistance ‘was

received from Messrs.-A S Meyer, C. M. Boyd and A.
'eHorton, of the Analytlcal Chemistry Division ‘who supplied

.and installed the hydrocarbon gas analyzer, assisted us with
cﬂthe 1nterpretation of the results, and analyzed many samples

_of gas and charcoal by the gas chromatographic procedure.

6 2. Continuous operation of the apparatus over the

.period of many days was made possible by the MSRE Operations
 section through their assignment of personnel for-taklng

data during the:evening'and night shifts.

| 6.3. The close cooperation and frequent discussions
with D. Scott,'Jr;, were ihvaluable in guiding the investi-
