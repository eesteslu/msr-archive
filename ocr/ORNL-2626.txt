MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY

- PART l. REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES X
L1 Concepruul Design Sfudles

and Nuclear Calculations

Further studies of the Interim Design Reacfor
have resulted in an improved fill-and-drain system
and alternate ways of transferring heat from the re-
actor fuel to steam. The revised fill-and-drain -
system retains the previously described after-heat
removal scheme, but the components have been re- .

designed tc make remote repair and removal feasible.

As now designed the entire heat removal system may
be removed or inserted from overhead wnhout dls- :
turbing the fuel circuitry. - : ' :

A simplified fuel-to-steam hent transfer sysiem is
being considered that eliminates intermediate heat
transfer fluids. The direct fuel-to-steam heat trans.
fer system used in conjunction with a Loeffler
boiler cycle allows contro! of the reactor and load
relationship with conventional steam cycle com- -
ponents. Preliminary cost studies based on @ 640-
Mw (heat) two-region homogeneous reactor were
made for several heat transfer cycles, including the
direct fuel-to-steam cycle, and it was found that -
the direct cycle gave the lowest first cest. A~
helium-cooled cycle gave the highest first cost, but
optimization of the reactor system would lower the
cost appreciably. S - ’

Nuclear calculations relative toa 30-Mw experl-
mental recctor with ¢ é-ft-dia core have indicated .
that the critical mass of the system ot 1180°F

would be 49 kg of U235 and the tofal inventory fora

system volume of 150 ft3 would be 65 kg of U%35,
After a year of operation, the critical mass would -
have increased to 61 kg, with ¢ net mtegrqted
burnup of 14.4 kg. Lo

Culcuhtlons of the mmal states of U”a-fueled
reactors were completed. Data were obtained for

critical mess, inventory, regeneration ruho, etc, for

core diameters ranging from 4 to 12 ft and thorium
fluonde concenfrations in the core of 2, 4, and 7
mole % for 600-Mw (thermal) reactors, Addmonal
caleulations covering a 20-yeur operating perlod
of the 8-ﬁ-d:a core with 7 mole % thorium showed

that, after five years, the reacter is self-sustammg. .

Calculations were also made of the fissions in the
blanket of the Interim Design Reactor. To date,
calculations covering only the first five years of

operation have been’ complefed but the fractlon of
fissions in the blanket appears to have stabilized"
at about 0,02. Methods for calculating the nuclear
characteristics of graphite-moderated, hetero-
geneous, molten-ﬂuorlde-sa It reacfcrs are bemg
developed. SR : . -
Gamma-ray energy cbsorpﬁon coefficients were
computed as a function of energy for 24 elements:

“hydrogen, earbon, beryllium, nitrogen, oxygen, -

magnesium, sodium, aluminum, silicon, sulfur,
phosphorus, argon, potassium, iren, calcium, copper,
molybdenum, iodine, tin, tungsten, platinum, lead,
thallium, ‘and vranium. The calculated values have
been assembled on paper tape for use with the
gamma-ray heating progrum Ghlmsr being wrmen for

the Orccle

- 1,2, Component Development and Testing

Development tests of salt-lubricated pump bear-
ings were continved. Satisfactory molten-salt
hydrodynamic bearing films were established in
two tests of an INOR-8 bearing and an INOR-8
journal. Slight rubbing marks found after extended
service are being investigated,. Equipment for test-
ing hydrostatic bearings with stationary pockets was
completed, and data on bearing loads and flows were
obtained in preliminary tests with water. Air en-
trainment encountered in preliminary dynamic tests
of a rotating-pocket hydrostatic bearing was cor-
rected, and the pressure distribution in the pockers
is being investigated. - : :

A conventional alummum bearing andan Inconel '
journal that had been lubricated with Dowtherm
“A" (a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and dlphenyl-
oxide) during 3200 hr of operation in a pump that’

- was circulating NaF-Z¢F .UF | at 1200°F was ex-
‘amined, . The clearence between the bearingand

journal had not changed ond there were only shghf

-~ indications of wear.

The oil-lubricated centnfugal-pump rotary element

~ assembly being operated in @ gamma-irradiation

facility ot the MTR had accumulated a total of

5312 he of operation and a gamma-ray dose rate to

the lower seal region of 9.3 x 10° r by the end of
the quarter. Samples of the bulk oil and the seal
leakage oil show that the viscosity has increased -
and that the bromine number has increased. The
 

increases have not been sufficient to affect oper~

ation, however. The acidity number of the oil in- -
dicates that little oxidation of the oil has occurred,
The test will be terminated when the dose to the
lower seal region has reached 1019,
Materials required for a motor suitable for long-
term operation at 1250°F in a radiation field are .
being investigated. Six coil assemblies that in-
corporate electrical insulation developed for use - -
-at high temperatures were received from the Louis-
Allis Company for testing. Suitable magnetic core-
materials and electrical conductors are being socught.
Fuel pump design studies that were confracted to

the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company and the .

Westinghouse Electric Company were completed,.
The results of both studies emphasized the need - .
for the development of salt-lubricated bearings. .
Various layouts of centrifugal pumps, both sump~—---
type and submerged, were suggested. :

A small, submerged, centrifugal pump with a
frozen-lead seal is being operated in evaluation
tests. During continuous isothermal operation of
this pump for 2500 hr at 1200°F, with ¢ molten salt
as the pumped fluid, there has been no leakage of
lead from the seal. A similar lead-sealed pump
with a. 3l/-m.-cl|a shoft is being fabrlcuted for test-
ing. -

Freeze-flange cnd mdented-seal-flcnge |omts that |

had sealed successfully in high-temperature molten-
salt lines were tested with sodium. Both joints -
operated successfully; there was no indication of -
sodium leakage. Two large freeze-flange joints
were tested in ¢ 4-in. line carrying o high-temper-
ature molten salt. There was no salt leakage, but
gas leakage of the flanges was slightly in excess
of the allowable 1077 em? of helium per second.
Modifications are now laemg made to improve the
gas tightness, .
Heater-and-insulation umts desugnecl for use en a
4-in. line were tested along with the large freeze
flange. The thermal loss from two units was found
to be about four times the heat loss from an equi-
valent length of "Hy-Temp pipe insulation 3 in.
. thick. -
’ Three commercmlly uvmluble expansion joints
were tested and found te be unsatisfactory for use
in molten salt or sodium lines.  Since the bellows
that failed in two of the tests were weakened by the
attachment of thermocouples, similor units Wlll l:e
tested wnthout thermocouples. -

. assembled

| " Data were obtained from which a plot of the sub-
limation temperature vs vapor pressure was pre-
~ pared, and the information was used in the design

of a thermal-convection loop for evaluating the heat
transfer performance of aluminum chloride gas.
Exposure of Inconel and INOR-8 specimens to
aluminum chleride vapor for 1000 hr showed that

* either material would be satisfactory for con-
_struction of the thermal-convection loop,

Construction and operation of forced-circulation
corrosion testiag loops was continued. - Of the |
thirteen facilities with operating loops, six are of
the new construction that gives maximum protection
against freezing of the salt in the event of power

failures, and the remaining seven loops have been
~ improved so far as possible without changing the

loop piping. Assembly of the first in-pile loop was
almest completed, and a second loop is l:elng

1.3. Engineeting Reseorch

The enthalpies, heat capacities, and heats of
fusion were determined for the mixtures NaF-BeF -
UF, (53-46-1 mole %), LiF-BeF ,-UF, (53-46-1 mole
%), NaCl-CaCl , (49-51 mole %), LiCI-KCI (70-30
mole %), LiCl-KCl (60-40 mole %), and LiCI-KCl
(50-50 mole %). Preliminary values were cbtained
for the surface tension of LiF-BeF -UF , (62-37-1

- mole %) over the temperature range of 460 to 750°C.

Apparatus for measurements of the coefficient of
thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, viscosity,
and electrical conductivity of beryllium-centaining
fluoride salt mixtures are being assembled.

The cause of a major discrepancy in heat balance
in the study of the heat-transfer coefficients of LiF-
BeF ,-UF , (53-46-1 mole %) flowing in a small-
dlcmeter lnconel tube is being investigated. A
pump system for investigating such longsange -
effects as film formation by comparison of heat- -

transfer coefficients is being constructed. ~ ~ §

. 1,4. Instrumentation and Controls

The results of a series of tests of Inconel re- ?‘f.(
sistance-type fuel-level-indicating elements have :
not been reproducible, as yet, but it has been
established that fuel 130 has sufficient resistance

to provide a useful milliwatt output from the probe., -

Polarization and surface tensicn effects are bemg
investigated as possd:le sources of fhe incons -
sustencues. ' - C
 

1.5. ‘Advanced Reactor Design Studies
Graphite-moderated molten-salt reactors fueled -
with low-enrichment material were studied, and the
results of preliminary calculations indicated that ~
initial enrichments as low as 1.25% U233 might be
used in a circulating-fuel system. Highly enriched
uranium weould be edded as makeup fuel, and such
reactors could probably be operated to burnups as

high as 60,000 Mwd/ton.

A simplified natural-convection melten-salt re-
actor for operation at 576 Mw (thermal) was studied
to determine the approximate size of compenents
and the fuel volume. Natural-convection power re-"
actors of this size are characterized by high fuel
volumes and large numbers of heat exchanger tubes.
Therefore it is expected that the initial cost of a
natural-cenvection reactor would be higher than that
for a forced-circulation system, and the large number
of heat exchanger tubes casts some doubt as to
whether the natural-convection system would
actually be more reliable than the forced-circulation
system. B

PART 2. MATERIALS STUDIES ’
2.1. Mefullurgy ﬁ

Two lnconel and four INOR-8 thermal-ccnvecﬂon
|oops, whlch circulated various fused-fluoride-salt -
mixtures, were examined. An Inconel loop which
operated 1000 hr at 1350°F with the mixture LiF- .
BeF ,-UF , (62-37-1 mole %) was attacked toa depth
of 3 mils. A loop operated previously with this
mixture at 1250°F showed approximately 1 mil of
attack over a similar test period. Operation of an
Inconel loop at 1050°F for 4360 hr,with the mixture
NaF-LiF-KF (l'l ,5-46.5-42 mole %) resulted in the -

formation of subsurface voids to a depth of 2 mils. :

~ No attack was evident in any of the INOR-8 loops
even after operation, in one case, for 314 hr.
Test results were also obtained for three Inconel
forced-circulation loops operated with fluoride -
mixtures. A loop which circuloted the mixture . .

* NaF-ZtF UF , (57-42-1 mole %) and also con- .~

tained a secondary sodium circuit showed maximum'’
~ attack to a depth of 1.5 mils in the salt circuit and
only slight surface roughening in the sodium cir- .-
cuits. No cold-leg deposits were present in either -
circuit. Mixtures of LiF, Ber, and UF, produced
attacks of 5 and 8 mils respectively in two other

~penetration of the graphite by the fuel.

loops operated for slightly more than 3000 hr at o
maximum hot-leg temperature of 1300°F.- .

INOR-8 samples removed frem a forced-circulation
loop that was shut down after 3370 hr of operation
for repair of a leak at a heater lug were found to have
no evidence of surface attack, Etching rates showed
slight differences between asereceived and as-tested
specimens. Operation of the loop has been resumed.
The mixture LiF-Ber-UF‘ (53.46-1 mole %) is
being circulated in this loop.’ The maximum wall --
temperature is 1300°F. The failure occurred at a
weld of the tubing to a heating lug adapter, and it
was found that the wrong weld material had been
used, ,

Routine msPechon of the INOR-B material now
being received has revealed that the quality is as
good as that of Inconel and of stainless steels made
to ASTM standards. The rejection rate for fully in-
spected welds is now about 10%.

A sodivm-graphite system was used to prepare .
Inconel and INOR-8 tensile test specimens for a
study of the effect of carburization on the mechanical
properties. The carburization at 1500°F caused in-
creases in both the yield and tensile strengths of

‘Inconel and decreased the ductility at room temper-

ature, For the INOR-B specimens, the yield strength
was increased, the tensile strength was slightly
decreased, and the ductility was greatly reduced. -
The changes were dependent on the amount of car-
burization. In similar tests ot 1250°F the carburized
specimens again showed a trend to lower ductility,
but some specimens were more ductile than control
specimens.
- In comparative tests of the carburization of INOR-8
by fuel 130-graphite systems, 3-mil surface cuts of
specimens exposed only to fuel analyzed 640 ppm
carbon, while similar cuts of specimens exposed to
fuel containing a graphite rod anclyzed 940 ppm
carbon.. Mechanical property tests showed the same
trends as those found for the specimens carburlzed
in sodium-graphite systems. - :

For a test of the penetratlon of graphite by fuel

- 130 a graphite crucible 4/ in. long with a tapered -

hole 0.43 in: ID and 3/ in. deep was loaded with the
fuel and tested in a vacuum at 1300°F. Radio-
graphs were made at 500-hr intervals to study the -

_ ‘At the end
of the first 500 hr test of a CCN graphite crucible,
there had been no penetration of the graphite, but o
disk of UO, had formed at the bottom of the tapered
hole that was 0.1 in. thick. Subsequent analyses .
 

showed that it contained 28% of the uranium =
originally present in the fuel, Further tests with
TSF in contact with fuel 130 have shown similar ©
precipitation of U, but to o lesser extent. Since -
the precipitation was least in the TSF graphite,
‘which is purer than the CCN grade, it is thought that
the precipitation may be caused by impurities in fhe
graphite. - =
The precipitation that occurred in fhese tests was
not observed in the carburization tests described
above. Further it is in contrast to the lack of 'pre-' :
cipitation in similar tests in which fuel 30 (NaF- -
ZrF ~UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %) was used. Metallagraphlc
exammahons of the crucible showed no ah‘ack end
no penetration of salt into the pores. B
Corrosion tests of pure silver and silver-base
brazing alloys in static fuel 130 showed silver and
its alloys to have very limited corrosion resistance.
On the other hand, gold-bearing clloys have shown
excellent carrosion resistance in fuel 130. '
A time-temperature-stress relationship was formu-
lated for the creep strength of INOR-8 to aid in
predicting long-time creep strengths. Heat-to-heat

" wvariation studies indicated a 0.14%-carbon-content -

heat to be appreciably stronger than two other INOR-S
heats containing 0.02 and 0.06% carbon. '

Eleven clloys with compositions bracketing the
maximum amount of each major alloying element of
INOR-8 have been vacuumeinduction melted and are
presently being aged at temperatures in the range of
900 to 1800°F. These alloys will be tested in order
to determine the effect of composition on sfructural
stability.

Specimens of commercially fabricated INOR-8 were
aged for 5000 hr ot test temperatures of from 1000
to 1400°F. These specimens exhibited no in-
stabilities in tensile tests that would be demmental
during long-time service.

Room- and elevated-temperature mechanical
property tests of INOR-8 weld metal both in the as.
welded and in the welded and aged conditions were
made and the results were compared with similar -
data for Hastelloy B and Hastelloy W. Aging
seriously reduces the room-temperature ductility of
Hastelloy B and Hastelloy W weld metal, while the
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal is improved. The
"influence of melting practice and carbide spherold-:
" izatien on the elevafed-temperature duchhfy of

INOR-8 is being studied. 2
The brazing of thick tube sheets is bemg studled.'
Promising results were obtained in a test braze of -

alloy. The brazing alloy was preplaced in annular |

" frepans in the tube sheet and fed to the joint through
‘three small feeder holes. Methods of joining

molybdenum and nickel-base matenals are also being
studled for pump application,

" 2.2, Radiation Damage |
The elecmcally heated mockup of the INOR-8

in-pile thermal-convection loop was operated under
simulated m-plle conditions. This experiment
served as a performance test for the various com-
ponenfs of the loop and indicated that madlflcahons
of the coocling«air injection system were required.
The in-pile mode! of the loop is being assembled.
Two flucride-fuel-filled graphite capsules were

.exammed that had been irradiated in the MTR fer

1610 and 1492 hr ot 1250°F The grapl'ute was un-
damaged

2,3, Chemistry

Phase equilibrium studies of fluoride-salt systems
containing UF , and/or ThF , were continved. Data
are being obtained on the NaF-BeF o~ ThF UF
system to provide a comparative bas:s for evaluahon
of lithium-base quaternary systems.

Studies have revealed the cause of low concen-
tration of uranium in 50-1b batches of LiF-BeF -
UF, (62-37-1 mole %) that were transferred from
250-|b batches. The first liquid to form when the
mixture is melted is the eutectic compositicn con-
taining 3.1 wt % uranium rather than the nominal
6.5 wt % uranium in the 250-1b batch. Thus the
composition of any partially molten batch must be
intermediate between that of the lowest melting
eutectic and the nominal composition of the liquid.
Complete me lting of the mixture is necessary to
maintain composition homagenerty ,

Extensive gradient-quenching expenmenfs were
completed on the LiF-BeF o~ ThE  system. Asa
result of these experlmenfs several modifications
were made in the preliminary phase diagram issued
previously. - Three-dimensional models of this
system and of the previously sfudled sysfem LrF- :
ThF -UF, were constructed. |

- The effects of divalent and trivalent fission-
product ions on the solubility of PuF, in LiF-Ber
mixtures was studied. The effect of the trivalent
ions was found to be sufficient to indicate that they
should not be allowed to build up in the fuel, but
 

the effect of the divalent ions was insignificant..
Data were obtained that provide a basis for the
use of trivalent ions in a scheme for reprocessing
fused-salt mixtures containing plutonmm. |

Solubility studies were made on several systems,
including argon in LiF-BeF, (64-36 mole %); HF in
LiF-BeF ., mixtures conimnmg 10 to 50 mole %
BeF ,; CeF, in NaF-LlF-BeF solvents of various
composihons, CeF,, LaF,, cnd SmF, in LiF-BeF .-
UF, (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %); CeF , and LaF simul-
tanecusly in LiF-BeF ;-UF , (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %);
and CeF, ond SmF s:muhcneously in LiF-BeF,- -
UF, (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %). An elementary mo&el
was stud:ed with which estimates can probably be -
made of the solubilities of the noble gases in media
of high surface tension to within an order of mag-
nitude, which is sufflcienﬂy accumte for reactor
applications. - SE S

Two methods of separating uranium from un=
desirable fission products in flucride-salt fuel
solvents are being studied. Experiments are in
progress in which a chromatographic type of =
separation of uranium and fissionsproduct rare
earths is effected by using beryllium oxide as the
column packing matericl. In other experiments
vranium precipitation upon the addition of water in
the influent gas stream is being investigated.

Tentative values were obtained for the activities
and the activity coefficients of nickel metal in
nickel-molybdenum clloys. The values were caleu-
lated from measurements of the electromotive force
of cells containing pure nickel and nickel-molybdenum
alloy electrodes in a bath of NaCl-KCl eutectic con-
taining S wt % NlClz.

Apparatus was set up for measunng the suface |
tensions of BeF, mixtures. Trial runs gave a value
of 195 dynes/cm at 425 to 450°C for LiF-BeF »UF,
(53-46-1 mole %) and 196 dynes/cm at about 480°C
for LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %). '

In the study of the chemical equilibria involved in
the corrosion of structural metals, the effect of
solvent composition on the equilibria

ICHF ,==22CrF, + Cr°
ond | |
'3Fe.F2;__.A_. 2FeF3 +Fe®

was investigated. The solvent LiF-NaF-ZrF‘ was
used because it permitted a continuous variation
from a basic to an acidic melt without interference

from precipitation. Increasing disproporticnation ot
was found with decreasing ZrF , content.

: Szml ar tests in solvents containing Ber which

is considered to be more basic than ZrF ,, showed -
that in an LiF-BeF, mixture containing 52 mole % -
BeF, the disproportionation of CrF, was roughly
comparuble to that in a solvent conta ining 35 mole
% ZrF ,. -These results confirmed the supposition

that BeF, mixtures are more basic than correspond-

‘ing ZrF  mixtures and that the extent of dispro-

porticnation of CrF is greater in the more basic
solvents. Expenments carried out with FeF, in the
same solvents showed no dlsproporhonahon.

Further measurements of the activity coefficients
of CrF, dissclved in the molten mixture NaF-ZrF
(53-47 mole %) were determined and equilibrium .
quotients were calculated. The results of the -
measurements of CrF, and the corresponding in-
vestigations of NiF, and FeF,, along with the
values for the actmties of chromlum in alloys, can
now be used in the study of corresion of Inconel -
and INOR-8 alloys. It is thought that the rate of
corrosion in these alloys is diffusion controlled.

Calculations were made of the amounts of
chromium metal which should be added to pre-
equilibrate a salt prior to a test in an Incenel loop.
The corrosion by a pre-equilibrated salt should de-
pend only on the hotstc-cold-zone transfer mechanism,
and the results should be indicative of long-term
coarosion rates in reactors.

Studies of chromium-diffusion in chromium-con-
taining nickel-base alloys were continued. It is
hoped that the results of these experiments will
provide a means for predicting the void penetration

- distances to be expected for a given set of cor-

rosion conditions.
An experimental study was made of the corrosion
of Inconel by aluminum chloride vepor in an all-

© metal system. The results indicated that the amount

of attack of Inconel can be expected to be pro-

. portional to the pressure of the aluminum chicride
~ vapor and that at 5 atm the corrosion after 300 hr
~ would be about 0.7 mil.
«activity of chromium is much lower than in Inconel,
~ should prove quite resistant to aluminum chloride
~ vapor, Other alloys selected on the basis of

INOR-8, in which the

chemical and structural considerations are to be

: fested.

The containment of aluminum chloride is of in-
terest because the gas has unique properties which
make it a heat transfer medium of potential utility

vii.

 
 

at high temperatures.  First, because of the large -
number of atoms per molecule, the heat capacity of
the gas is high. Further, because at high temper-
atures the major species is AlCl3 and at lower
temperatures the major species is Al ,Cl & cooling -
the gas in a heat exchanger will remove, in-addition
to the heat obtained from the temperature change, -
the heat from the dissociation reaction. Estimates
of the physical properties of the gas were made to -
provide a basis for the design of a thermalecon-
vection loop in which to test the heat transfer
characteristics and the corresiveness of the gas.

In tests of the penetration of graphite by molten:
salts, ‘it was found that NaF-LiF-KF penetrated to
greater extent than LiF-MgF,, as indicated by
weight gains.: The NaF-LiF-KF mixture has a lower
density and a lower viscosity than the LiF-MgF,
mixture. In both cases there was even penefrcmorl
to the center of the graphite rod.

* A new method of preparing chromous fluoride was
explored in wh:ch the reaction is

SnF, + Cr—>CrF, +5n

The chrdnium-cer:ta ining porﬁon obtained in the

vili

| experiment had the erystallographic properties of

pure chromous flocride. Improved methods for pre-
paring vanadium frlﬂuonde and ferrous fluonde were
olso deve Ioped

2.4. Fuel Processing

Sufﬁcnent luboraiory work has been done to con-
ﬁrm that fluorination of the fuel salts LIF-BeF .
UF, or LiF-BeF -UF ,~ThF , results in good
urumum recovery. Therefore the flucride volatili-
zation process, which was developed for hetero-
geneous reactor fuel processing and was used
successfully for recovery of the uranium from the
fuel mixture (NaF-ZrF -UF 4) circulated in the Air-
craft Reactor Expenmenf, appears to be applicable
to processing of fuels of the type now being con-
sidered for the molten-salt reactor.

Developmental work has been initiated on the -
processing of the solvent salt so that it can be re-
cycled., The recovery process is based on the
solubility of LiF-BeF, in highly concentrated
aqueous HF and the msolublhty of rare ecrth and
other polyvalent-e lement fluorides.

 INTERIM DESIGN REACTOR .

A study has been made of improvements and .
variations of the Interim Reactor Design described
in 0RNL-2634 and, briefly, in the previous quar-
terly report, ! )
an improved fill-and-drain system has been de-
signed, and alternate ways of transferring heat
from the reactor fuel to steam have been ‘cone.
sidered.

Fuel Flll-and Dram System o L
G. D. Whitman - - _
Design studies of the fuel flll-and-drcm system

for the interim design reactor were described pre- -

viously, 172 and further study of possible configu-
rations has resulted in a system that eliminates .
maintenance difficulties inherent in the initicl.
design. The original concept of pipes and water
walls resulted in a relatively low first cost sys-
tem; however, the components were not readily
accessible for repair. In addition the entire
system was contained in a gastight thermally in- -
sulated volume that complicated primary entry for -
maintenance operations, '

The new concept retains the after-heat removal
scheme, that is, radiant heat transfer to a boiling
water system, but the components have been re.
designed so that overhead accessibility makes
remote repair and removal more practical. The
fused sait is contained in a cylindrical tank into
which a number of vertical bayonet tubes are in-
serted. These tubes are capped at the bottom and
welded into the top of the vessel, which forms a
tube sheet. These tubes serve as the primary

after-heat removal radiating surface and contribute’

substantial nuclear poison to the geometry.

The water boiler, which consists of a. number of
mating double-pipe bayonet tubes projecting down-
ward from a combination water-and-steam drum, -
rests on the top of the drain vessel. The boiler .

tubes fit inside the tubes in the fuel vessel, and

Specifically, as described below, -

the combination 'fbrms a radiant heat exchange
system. This concept retains the double con-
tingency protection agamst fluid leakage from
either system.

Electric heaters and |nsulat|on are installed
around the fuel vessel for preheating. The boiler
tubes are flooded with water for after-heat removal,
and the rate of heat removal may be controlled by
the boiler ‘‘water rate’’ or by dividing the boiler
into sections which may be used in combinations
to control the rate and locatlons of heat removal
in the fuel vessel. =~ '

The entire boiler system may be removed or
inserted from overhead without disturbing the fuel
circuitry, A failed fuel tube could plug at the
tube sheet and only failure of the vessel walls
would necessitate complete removal of the system.

The drain system required for a 600-Mw (thermal)
molten-salt reactor system was considered, ond it
was found that four vessels 5 ft in diameter and
12 ft high-would be needed to contain the 600 3
of salt from the reactor. Each of the vessels
would be capable of removing 1.8 Mw of after heat

- within the practical temperature limitations of the

container materials.
~Criticality calculations were made at off-design

~conditions. The nuclear poison contribution of the

removable boiler tubes was neglected aond the

- bayonets projecting into the fuel tanks were con-
. sidered to be flooded with water. It was de-
- ‘termined that approximately 60 Ib of 1.5% boren

“steel would have to be placed in the system to

- give multiplication constants below 0.5 with the -

U235

. probable concentrations in the fuel salt.

Fuel-to-Steam Heat Transfer
‘M. E. Lackey

A dnrect fuel-to—steam heat transfer system has
_been studied for application in a molten-salt
power reactor. The complete heat removal sys-
“tem consists of four circuits in parallel to remove
the heat from the fuel and a single circuit to re-
move the heat from the blanket. Each of the cir-
cuits is separate and independent up to the point
where the superheated steam paths join chead of
the turbine. Each circuit has a sclt-to-sfeam heat -

exchanger located in the reactor cell and an evap-

orator and steam compressor located ad|acent to

the reactor cell.

A simplified flow diagram of the heat transfer '.

system is shown in Fig. 1.1.1. This system is
entirely free of sodium and its associated prob-
lems. The fuel-to-steam heat couple in coniuncé
tion with the Loeffler boiler cycle provides a ~
differential modu lating thermal block between the
fuel and the water which allows complete and

conventional control of the reactor und load re- - T

Compurutwe Costs of Severul Systems Rartee

G. D. Whitman

Prellmmary cost studies have been mcde for o

number of heat fransfer cycles for a molten-salt - |

power reactor, and the capital costs for seven

_ heat transfer systems are summarized in Table

1.1.1.. In all cases the system was assumed to

“include a fixed-size, two-region, homogeneous
reactor in which 640 Mw of heat was generated
and then transferred to o reheat-regenerative

- steam cycle. The steam conditions were set at

1800 psia and 1000°F reheat.

' “In all cases four parallel heat transfer loops

and four steam generating systems were coupled

~to the fuel circuit, and @ single heat transfer loop
"and steam generator were used in the blanket

circuit. Reheat was supplied by the fuel system
exclusively in all the systems. .

The reactor plant portion of the cost summary
included the shielding, containment vessel, in-
strumentation, remote maintenarice equipment,
auxiliary fluid systems, original fluid inventories,
and the chemical plant equipment, in addition to
the reactor and heat transfer circuitry. The con-
ventional plant costs included the costs of land,
structures, steam system (not including bonlers, -
superheaters, or reheaters), turbine-generator,
accessory electrical equipment, and miscellaneous
power plant equipment. -

The genercl expense item listed in Table 1.1.1
was assigned to cover the design and indirect
costs incurred during the construction and startup-
phases of operation. It was set at approximately
16.5% of the reactor and convenhonal plcmt sub-
total. C

MOL TEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT

easily certain design features were fixed, as pre-
viously described. More nearly optimized systems
would probably result in lower costs; however,

with the exception of the gas-cooled cycle, it was

not evident that optimization studies would sig-
nificantly alter the relative costs.

The Loeffler direct fuel-to-steam system gave
the lowest first cost. In this case the elimination
of a sodium circuit resulted in a net saving even
though the fuel-to-steam heat exchanger was more -
expensive than the heat exchangers in the sodlum-
coupled system.

The helivm-cooled cycle resulted in the highest

first cost. This was due primarily to the relatively

large amount of heat transfer surface required in
the fuel-to-helium and helium-to-water-to-steam
heat exchangers. This particular system would
probably be the most sensitive to optimization
studies. In particular, increasing the coolant gas
pressure and using gases other than helium could
reduce the size of the heat transfer equipment,
Differences in fuel volume will also be reflected
in fuel cycle costs, which are not included in
the capital costs shown in Table 1.1.1. A first
approximation, based on changes in fuel inventory
charges alone, indicate that each additional 100
ft3 of fuel volume would add about 0.06 mill/kwhr
to the cost. On the basis that each plant had the
same net electrical output, the maximum deviation
in the power cost contributed by the capital charge
was found to be approximately 1 mill/kwhr.

EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR CALCULATIONS
J. W. Miller

A 30-Mw experimental reactor is being con-
sidered that would have a 6-ft-dia core enclosed
ina g-in.-thick INOR-8 pressure vessel. Sur-
rounding the core there would be g §-in.-thick
layer of insulation, a 6-in.-thick air space, and
five 2-in.<thick boron steel thermal shields cooled
by 4-in.-thick layers of diphenyl.

Nuclear calculations indicate that the critical
mass at 1180°F would be 49 kg of U235, and the
total inventory for a system volume of 150 ft3
would be 65 kg of U235, After a year of cperation,

the critical mass would have increased to 61 kg,

with a net integrated burnup of 14.4 kg.
Approximately 7% of the neutrons would be
captured in the core vessel. This compares with
5% for the 600-Mw reference design reactor.
Weighting these numbers by the reactor power

levels, indicates that the heat-generation rate in

" the experimental reactor would be approximately

7% of the heat-generation rate in the reference
design reactor.
- Approximately 31% of the neutrons would escape

~ from the core vessel, and these would all be cap-

tured by the time they reached the fourth boron
steel thermal shield.

NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS
L. G. Alexander

Nuclear Characteristics of Homogeneous,
Two-Region, Molten-Fluoride-Salt
- Reactors Fueled with U233

The calculations entailed in the investigation of
initial states of U233.fueled reactors were com-
pleted, and it was discovered that serious dis-
crepancies existed between results obtained from
the Oracle program Compone and the UNIVAC

- program Ocusol, especially when the results were
 used as input for the Oracle burnout code, Sorghum.

The difficulty was traced to fluctuating end-point
fluxes generated by the Compone program. Ac-

- cordingly, the Compone cases were discarded,

and the series of calculations was completed with
the Ocusol program. Meanwhile, the defect in the
Cornpone program was remedied by the author,

W. E. Kinney, and the two programs are now in

fair agreement, as discussed below.
The results of the calculations are given in

Table 1.1.2, where critical mass, inventory, re-

generation ratio, etc., are given for a series of
cases covering core diameters ranging from 4 to
12 £t and thorium fluoride concentratiens in the
core of 2, 4, and 7 mole %. The regeneration ratio

"is plotted against the critical inventory for a

600-Mw (thermal) system in Fig. 1.1.2. The dotted
line in Fig. 1.1.2 is the envelope of the curves
shown and is the locus of optimum conversion for
a given inventory. As may be seen, the 8-ft-dia
cores are nearly optimum at all thorium concen-
trations, and initial regeneration raties of up to
1.08 can be obtained with inventories rcngmg up
to 1300 kg of U233,

The subsequent performance of the 8-ﬁ-dlu core

~with 7 mole % thorium was studied by means of

the Oracle code Sorghum. Extracts from the cal-
culated results are given in Table 1.1.3, where
inventories, absorption ratios, regeneration ratios,
etc., are given for periods of operation of up to

It may be seen that, although the regeneration ratio -

remains above 1,04 and therefore there is a net
breeding gain, it is, nevertheless, necessary to
add fresh U233 during the first five years to com-
pensate for the ingrowth of fission products and
nonfissionable isotopes. The annual edditions
amount to 118, 27.4, 10.8, 6.0, and 1.6 kg, re-
spectively, but less than 1,0 kg per year is . . -
required after five years, and the reactor is then

- self-sustaining. By the end of the second year.

the net integrated burnup (total inventory less .~ .-

total fuel ‘purchased) becomes negative.

blanket, together with spoce-averoged group fluxes
and leakage probabilities, were then used as in-
puts for further one-year Sorghum caleulations.

- The neutron source in Sorghum was also reduced

by the fraction of fissions occurring in the blanket.

In addition to providing information about the -
fissions in the blanket, this series of calculations
also provided a test of the usual method of operat-
ing the code. The case selected for study was

’ " the Interim Design Reactor with a core 8 ft in

diameter, a fuel salt consisting of 36.5 mole %
BeF,, 62.5 mole % LiF, and 1 mole % ThF‘, to-
gether with sufficient UF , to make the system
critical (about 0.25 mole %) . The case was run

~as Cornpone calculation 01045 and the resulting

data were used as input for Serghum calculation
01065. In the integration of the time-dependent -
difference equations, o time increment of 5 days

 
 

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT

was used until the time varicble corresponded to
one year of operation of the reactor; at this time,
the increment was increased to 30 days for the
next 20 years of reactor time. This is customanly
done to shorten the time required for the compu-
tation and is justified by the fact that, after the
first year, concentrations change slowly.

A second series of calculations was performed
as described above, except that the time incre-
ment was held constant at 5 days. After one year
of reactor operation, the concentrations predicted
by the Sorghum code were found to render the
reactor slightly subcritical (k = 0.9982 on Corn
pone 02045), even though the U233 in the blanket
was foken into account. The fraction of fissions
in the blanket was estimated to be 0.013. This
information, together with flux spectrum and leck-
age probabilities, was used as input for further
Sorghum calculations, etc., with the results shown
in Fig. 1.1.4, where the fraction of blanket fissions
is shown as a function of reactor operating time,
Also shown is a comparisen of two key parameters,

crmcul inventory and regeneration ratio, com-
puted in the two series of calculations. The cal-
culations to date cover only the first five years of
operation; however, the fraction of fissions in the
blanket appears to have stabilized at about 0.02.
A comparison between the two lower curves for
critical inventory shows satisfactory agreement

‘between the two methods of calculation, especially
since the top points of the discontinuous curve

represent the critical condition. Similarly, the
low points of the discontinuous curve for regener- .
ation ratio agree well with the smooth curve. How-
ever, it is not presently understood why the slopes
of the discontinuous curves differ so much from
the smooth curves, and it may be that the agree-
ment of the points is fortuitous.

Comparison of Ocusel und Cornpone Cclculuﬂons

As mentioned above, a mathematical defect in
the Cornpone program was dlscovered and hence
all prior Cornpene calculations were discarded.
After the error had been corrected, the program
was used to recompute an Ocusol case. A com-
parison of the results obtained from the two pro-
grams with identical input conditions is shown in
Table 1.1.4. It may be seen that, while there is
good agreement between the regeneration ratios,
there is a substantial difference between the

“critical inventories and that the Cornpone program

predicts the lower values.

The discrepancies have been resolved in favor
of Cornpone, which embodies a fourth-order approx-
imation to the difference equations, whereas
Ocusol uses only second-order approximations that -
result in an under-estimate of the absorptions in
the core. In order to achieve a neutron balance -
in Ocusol, the currents at the boundary of the core
are adjusted arbitrarily and are not computed from
the gradients of the flux. As a result, the leakages
are overestimated. In Cornpone; the fourth-order -
solutions satisfy the neutron balances to less than
one part in a thousand, and the b'oundary'currents
are correctly computed from the gradlents of the
flux.

The difference in the behavior of this feactor as
predicted by Sorghum calculations based on the
Ocusol and on the Cornpone soluticns are shown ~
in Fig. 1.1.4. It may be seen that the dlfferences
in regeneration ratio are negligible, but the cal-
culation based en Cornpone predicts a critical
inventory about 50 kg lower than ihut bused on
Ocusol '

Heterogeneous Reactors

~As mentioned in previous reports, graphite-
moderated, heterogeneous, molten-fluoride-salt

reactors show promise of achieving higher regener-

ation ratios for ¢ given investment in fuel than the

homogenecus reactors. As a result, attention has

been given to developing a reasonably reliable
method of calculation. The multigroup Cornpone

- program for Oracle was modified by W. E. Kinney
to provide a boundary condition of zero net cur-
rent in each diffusion group. Thus it is now pos-
sible to treat a heterogeneous unit cell in an
infinite lattice and to compute group disadvantage
factors which may then be applied to the group
cross sections in a homogeneized version of the
finite reactor. A program modifying the Cornpone
program to apply these factors has been written,

Gummu-Ray Heating Calculations

" Work on a program for computing the gamma-ray
heating in the core vessel and blanket of homo-
geneous, molten-salt reactors was resumed.
Gamma-ray energy absorption coefficients as a
function of energy for 24 elements were computed
from the x-ray attenuation coefficients listed by
Grodstein,? according to a procedure developed
previously.4 The defining equation is:

Hydrodyncmic Bearings. — The results of the first
ottempt to establish @ molten salt (LiF-BeF ,-UF ,,
62-37-1 mole %) hydredynamic bearing film have been
assessed and three additional tests with the same
combination of materials, an INOR-8 bearing and an
INOR-8 journal, have been made. A review of the
bearing installation procedure used for the first test.
revealed that the bearing had been. placed into the
test apparatus upside down. This error accounts
for the difficulty experienced in maintaining a
hydrodynamic film during bearing operation,

Testing of a second bearing and journal of INOR-,
8 was terminated on schedule at the end of a 500-hr
period of saﬂsfactory operation. Examingtion of
this bearing and joumal revealed o very small
amount of wear and a nearly unchanged surface
finish. Every indication points to the establishment
and mumfenance of a hydrodynamic film during
operation of this bearing and joumal. Fifty-seven
stops and starts were made during a S4-hr period
of the test. The remainder of the test was con-
ducted at constant conditions, that is, a shaft
speed of 1200 rpm and an applied radial load of
200 Ib. -A report? covering the flrst and second
tests was written. '

‘The same bearmg ‘and ;oumal were then assembled
for a third test to investigate the effect of repeated
operation. The third test covered a period of 284
“hr during which 37 stop-start tests were performed
The last 100 hr of operation were at constant con-
ditiens:  shaft speed, 1200 rpm; applied radial load,
300 Ib. "Examination of the bearing and joumnal re-
vealed slight rubbing marks at each end of the
. bearing. ,

A fourth test with a new (third) bearing and
journal of INOR-8 in mclten salt at 1200°F is under
way to trace the cause of rubbing marks to either .
stop and start tests or to steady-load operation. It
is planned to continue the testing of the second -
bearing and journal at a later date.

Hydrostatic Bearings. ~ Fabrication of the hydro-
static bearing tester3 was completed and tests were
run on two hydrostatic bearings with water as the
lubricant. - During the first test, in which a radial

. clearance of 0.003 in. was used, the bearing and

journal experienced considerable wear, It was found
that the supply pressures for the four hydrostatic -
pockets differed from each other, instead of being
constant. The radial distribution of these pressures
was very similar to the redial distribution of the
volute pressures, which give rise to the load on the
bearing. As @ consequence, the bearing force tended
to be least in the direction of the greatest bearing
load. This difficulty was traced to four partitiens
which had been installed in the manifold supplying
the hydrostatic pockets. The partitions were re-
moved for the second test, which was conducted

~with @ second hydrostatic bearing having a radicl

clearance of 0.0075 in. For this test, additional
instrumentation was installed to pemmit indication
of the eccentricity of the joumal. This instru-
mentation consists of nozzles through which air
flows radially inward toward the cylindrical shaft
surface; the back pressure on the nozzle is a
function of the distance between the nozzle outlet
and the cylindrical surface. Further refinements in

- this technique of measurement appear to be de- .

sirable, _

In the second test, data were. obtamed at shaﬂ
speeds from 600 to 3000 rpm at various pump cir
cuit resistances in.an attempt to determine the
effect of varying the bearing load. Data on bear- .
ing Ioads and flows were obtained by measuring the
pressure in each bearing pocket and the pressure -
differential across each orifice. The secend bear-
ing and joumnal experienced slight wear of the type

. that might be expected to occur during stopping and

starting. At low speeds, during stopping and start- o

ing, no supply pressure is available to the hydro-
static pockets; thus contact between the |ournal

and bearing may be expected.

Rotating-Pocket Hydrostatic Bearings. ~ Static
tests were completed on the rotating-pocket hydro-
static bearing,4 and dynamic tests are in progress.
In the initial dynamic test it was found that there
was entrainment of air in the process water. This
problem has been sclved by the use of an external-
circuit that carries flow from the upper side of the
impeller-bearing region to the impeller suction -
through a stilling well. Anocther problem that is -

" being investigated is that of the pressure dis-
tribution in the pockets. The pressure distribution
obtained thus far in dynamic tests does not con-

‘form to that found in the static tests and pre-
dicted by the analytical studies. :

Bearing Mountings. ~ Two types of bearing mounts
ore being studied. One of these is ¢ column type
~of sleeve mount designed at ORNL that takes into
account the thermal expansion differences of the
-materials. - Plans have been made to test this mount

statically prior to applying it to an actual bearing
in a molten-salt system. Fabrication of a mount for

testing awaits a satisfactory solution to the problem

of brazing melybdenum to Inconel and to INOR-8.
The other type of mount being studied is a patented
fixture supplied by Westinghouse, Tests of this
fixture, designated *‘Thermoflex,’’ are under way.

Development Tests of Conventioncl Bearings
-D. L. Gray W. E. Thomas

Organic-Liquid-Lubricated Bearings. -~ The high-
temperdture sump pump being used to conduct a
demonstration of the behavior of Dowtherm “A""
(eutectic mixture of diphenyl and diphenyloxide)
as a bearing lubricant operated satisfactorily for a
period of 3206 hr. The pump circulated fuel 30 -
(NcF-ZrF -UF,, 50-46-4 mole %) at a temperature
of 1200°F the shaft speed was about 2600 rpm; the
temperature of the Dowtherm ‘‘A" supplied to the
bearings was maintained at 180°F, with approxi-
mately a 5°F rise through the test bearings. The
lubricant flow rate was 2 gpm. \

Upon completion of 3200 hr of operation, the
pump was disassembled, and the test bearings and
seals were mspected The double-row angular-

o

contact ball bearings (MRC-5309), which weré sub-
merged in the lubricant during operation, showed
no detectable wear or imperfections. The diametral

“¢clearance between the aluminum bearing and the

Inconel joumnal was found to be essentially the
same (0,0044 in.) as it was at the time of the
previous 100-hr inspection. Seal nose heights
were measured at the beginning and the end of @
2008-hr test period, and wear indications of 0.0016
in. on the upper seal and 0.0004 in. on the lower
seal were noted. Lower seal leakage averaged

2 cms/day during the operating peried, but the
upper seal leakage was essentially zero.

" The pump was reassembled and reinstalled in the
test stand and operation at the above-mentioned
steady-state conditions was resumed. After § hr of
operation, that is, an over-all total of 3206 hr of
operation, a building power interruption caused the
lube oil pump to stop. Within about 30 sec, it was
noticed that the drive equipment was heavily over-
loaded and that the pump speed had been reduced

- to zero. Upon disassembly of the pump it was

found that the pump shaft had seized in the aluminum
beaﬂng. It was further observed that the three oil-
supply grooves in the beanng were not covered by
the journal for approximately / in. Thusa path )
existed during the entire test for direct escape of
the pressure-fed lubricant to the region external to
the load-carrying film of the bearing. However, it
is believed that this bearing would have centinued
to operate for a longer period of time had the lube
oil pump remained in operation. The demonstration
was terminated after this incident and a final reporf
is being written.

Bearing and Seal Gomma lrrudwhon. - The o
centrifugal-pump rotary element assembly being
operated without an impeller in a gamma-irradiation
facility at the MTR had uccuz_hulated a total of 7
5312 hr of operation by the end of the quarter; during

- 4426 hr of the operating peried, the assembly has

been exposed to gamma irradiation. The accumu-
lated gamma-ray dose to the lower seal region has
reached approximately 9.3 x 10%r. 'The bulk il
has accumulated an upproxlmufe gamma-ray dose of
2.25 x 108+,

On June 12, 1958, a momentury power failure

- stopped shaft rotation and caused seal leakage of

53 em? in the following 24 hr. Durmg the succeed-

_ing 24 hr the leakage was 12 em3, after which the

leakage leveled off to the nomal 6 to7 cms/day. :

On June 23, 1958, an attempt was made to ac-

celerate the bulk oil radiation damage by reducing
 

 

the lube oil dilution factor. A total of 5430 cm?
of oil had been remeved from the lube oil reservoir
when the fow lube oil flow alarm halted rotation of
the shaft. Sufficient oil was then replaced to
permit stable operation, but subsequently operation
was stopped twice because of a low lube oil level.
The leakage of the lower seal increased during this
quarter from approximately 6 ml/day to approxi=
mately 60 ml/day. It is believed that the stoppages
may have confrlbuted to the mcreosed rate of Ieak-
:uge. "

It is planned to terminate the test when fhe lower
seal region has received a dose of 10'% r. This
should be achieved within three additioncl weeks,
The test unit will then be retumed to ORNL for
examination. :

Rad:oﬂon-Resistnnf Elecﬂ'ic Mofors for Use .

‘at High Temperutures
'S. M. DeCamp

The investigation of the materials that weuld be
required for radiation-resistant motors for use at
high temperatures has included studies of electrical
steels and high-strength low-resistance electrical
conductors, in addition to the studies of electrical
insulation previously reported.® This work is
directed toward the development of a motor suitable
for long-term operation at 1250°F in a radistion
field.

Six coil assemblies that incorporate the electrlccl
insulation system developed by the Louis-Allis
Compdny for use at high temperatures were re-
ceived early in September. These coil assemblies
(called **motorettes’’) are arranged on a steel frame
in such a fashion that the three separate aspects of
the insulation problem normally encountered in an
electric motor are properly simulated and can be
separately measured. These aspects of the problem
are usually referred to as *‘turn-to-turn,’’ *“coil-to-
coil,’” and *“coil-to-ground’’ resistance.

During the course of development work by the
Lovis-Allis Company it was found that a new wire
product (Silotex-N) made by Anaconda Copper
Company was superior to ceramic-coated wire at
elevated temperatures. Silotex-N wire is a nickel-
plated copper conductor covered with a glass serv-
ing. The wire is also coated with o silicone
varnish that is stable up to about 350°C. At this
temperature the silicone is driven off, and Si0, is
left as a residue. The glass serving appears fo be
a goed tum-to-turn insulation at high tempemtures
based on tests run by the Louis-Allis Company.

No tests have been run by ORNL to date.

The coil-to-coil and coil-to-ground insulation

supplied with the motorettes consists of mica that

was coated and impregnated with a medified ceramic
cement by the High Temperature Instrument Com-
pany. Again, preliminary tests by the Louis-Allis
Company at 1200°F indicate good results, After
the coils are wound, they are placed in the *‘slots’

" of the motorette with the mica as a slot liner (coil-

to-ground insulation) and as a coil separator (coil-
to-coil insulation). The whole assembly is then
impregnated with a ceramic compounded by the
Louis-Allis Company. All materials used in the .
motorettes appear to offer good insulating properties
at ¢ tamperature of 1200°F. Radiation resistance
has not been checked by test, as yet, but this re-
quirement was considered in the selection of ma-
terials, Testing of the motorettes by ORNL will
include assessing the effects of time at elevated
temperatures, thermal cycling operation during nu-
clear irradiation, and operation during nuclear irradi-
ation at elevated temperatures. .

A prellmmary investigation of magnetic coere ma-
terials for use at high temperatures indicates that
little progress has been made in this field. More
work on obtaining saﬂsfuctory magnetic stee! is
planned.. :

Operation of an electrlc motor at 'I250°F will
require electrical conductors with good mechanical
strength properties and low electrical resistivity.
Work is presently under way to detemmine types of

~ materials which might be considered for such an

application.

Design Studies of Fﬁel Pumps

Engineering study contracts for the evaluation of
various types of molten-fluoride-salt pumps and for
the preparation of preliminary design studies were
awarded to two companies late in the previous
quarter, and work on both contracts (Allis-Chalmers
Manufacturing Company and Westinghouse Electric
Company) was completed during this quarter,

The work by Allis-Chalmers took the form of a
feasibility study. Nineteen different types of pump
and drive combinations were evaluated, including
centrifugal pumps of the canned-motor type, similar
pumps with remote drives, positive displacement
pumps, jet pumps, and electromagnetic pumps. The
study resulted in a recommendation that two types
of centrifugal pumps be selected for further study:
(1) a pump with a vertical shaft and a free gas-to-
salt interface and a totally enclosed fan-cooled
motor drive; and (2) a turbo-pump energized by a
secondary fluid, possibly a barren-salt mixture that
were fabricated of Inconel.

 

is compatible with the reactor salt and the container
material. -

Three preliminary centrifugal pump layouts were
selected by Westinghouse for inclusion in their
report (a number of other, less applicable, layouts

were shown to ORNL engineers during the course of

the work). Two.of the layouts included in the re-
port showed pumps of the sump type (having a free
" liquid-to-gas interface in the body of the pump). -

Both of these layouts made use of a salt-lubricated -

lower bearing, while the upper bearing was lubri-
cated by a low-melting-pcint salt in a container
physically separated from the process salt. - Both
pumps made use of totally enclosed motors..

The third Wesnngh_ouse layout showed a sub-,
merged pump completely filled with salt that made
use of o motor designed for operation at high -
temperatures. Both the journal and the thrust
bearings were lubricated by the molten salt. The
motor windings were to be made with a specially
formed mica insulation system being developed by
Westinghouse for another reacter project. A sub-
merged pump of this type would have advantages in.
a molten-salt reactor in that (1) the heating of the
pump parts by fission gases would be eliminated and
(2) the pump could be made cons:derably smaller
than a sump type of pump. -

One of ihe primary purposes of these des ign

studies was to determine which particular elements

of a fuel pump should be selected for inclusion in
the development program. In this respect, both
-vendors emphasized the need for solt-lubrlcoted

bearings.

- The test loop in which the pump is operating con-

“sists of /a-m. sched-40 Inconel pipe with a small

surge tank at the top. Heat is applied by Calred
heaters controlled by Variacs, and temperatures are
measured and recorded by thermocouples and a
recorder. The pump, motor, and loop assembly is
shown in Fig. 1.2.2 without the heaters and thermo-
couples.

In preparatlon for filling, the loop piping was
heated to 1000°F, With the pump shaft rotating,
1100 g of pure lead was loaded into the pump
barrel; the chamber was about two-thirds full. The
remainder of the loop and the pump barrel were then
filled with fused salt mixture 30 (NaF-ZrF -UF Jd
and flow was started. |sothermal operahon was
established at 1200°F for the main loop, and the
temperatures of the pump barrel were regulated to
lead-to-fused salt interface temperature

Since the start of operuhon on June 13, 1958, the

. pump ond seal have operated continuously for 2600

 _hr. During the first 100 hr of operation, a slight

' " leakage of lead was observed. This was stopped

by adjusting the coolant flow, and no leakage has

- occurred since. A closeup view of the seal gland
while in operation is shown in Fig. 1.2.3.

ln order to further evaluute the possibility of a

lead-sealed pump, a lcrger model is being pre-
~pared for testing. A 3/-|n.-daq shaft, which will
~operate at 1200 rpm, w 1I be used in ¢ seal gland of

similar configuration. The peripheral speed of the

- shaft will be 1020 fpm compared with 190 fpm for

the smaller quel.

the average temperature cycle time for the 50-cycle
test was 60 min. Representative temperatures
measured during the test are listed in Table 1,2.2.
Both joints operated successfully; there was no
indication of sedium leakage. The separated joints
are shown in Figs. 1.2.6 and 1.2. 7 as they appeared
ofter the test.

The annealed - copper seal ring used in the freeze-
flange joint was identical to that used in the pre-
vious tests with molten salt. The gasket used in
the indented-seal-flange joint was made of annealed
Armco iron that was nickel plated to prevent oxi-

dation of the iron. This gasket material was also .

successfully tested with molten salt.
A detailed description of the large freeze-flange
joint for use in a 4-in.-dic line was presented

previously.® Tests of two of these joints were con-

ducted in a high-temperature loop that circulated

in Fig. 1.2.9.

A heater-insulation unit, designed for use on a
4-in.-dia line, was installed on the loop and tested
clong with the large freeze-flange joints. The -
heater-insulation unit is shown in Fig. 1.2,10. A
spacer is shown in Fig. 1.2.11. Two of the heater-
insulation units and one spacer, located between

1 and 1.6 x 10~8 cm®/sec for flange No. 2. During
the loop test, temperatures were measured at the
points indicated in Fig. 1.2,12. - Molten salt was
circulated at a flow rate of ~40 gpm. The salt
temperature was cycled 50 times between 1100 and
1300°F; each cycle was of 2 hr duration. Repre-
sentative temperatures mecsured during the test
are listed in Table 1,2,3.

There was no indication of salt leakuge durmg
the test, but gas leckage tests made on the flanges
while they were installed in the loop indicated -
leakage rates in excess of the maximum allowable
leakage rate of 10~7 cm? of helium per second.
The bolts on the special clamps around each joint
were tightened from eriginal loads of 180 ft-lb each
to approximately 400 ft-Ib each mthout upprecmble
improvement of the leckage rates."

The clamps were therefore removed from the
flanges, and additional bracing was welded to them
to permit higher loads. In addition, oxide was re-
moved from the clamps, and they were given an
oxidation-resistant coating. A special lubricent
containing graphite and molybdenum disvlfide in a
resin base was also coated over the surfaces of
the clamp and belts to reduce friction between
mating surfaces and thus provide a clamp of greater
efficiency. Two seal rings are being fabricated
from 25 aluminum. It is believed that the use of
these seal rings and e higher bolt loading will
provide a gas-tight joint. The thermal-cycle testing
will be repeated following these modifications.

Both of the joints were separated, after removal
of the clamps, and the inside surfaces of the
flanges were examined for signs of cracking caused .

HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

J C Amos
ALCI, Therm'ul-Convectipn Loop

A thermal-convection loop has been designed for
evaluating the heat transfer performance of aluminum
chloride gas. This gas has been suggested as a
possible low-pressure gas coolant which would |
_ eliminate many of the containment problems in-
herent in high-pressure gas systems. Aluminum
chicride gas is of interest for the molten-salt re-
actor concept because of the almost complete dis-
sociation reaction (Al Cl ""'"'*2A|C| ) that occurs
between 900 and 12008F This dlssocwhon pro-
cess is reversible and results in a large increase
“in the heat capacity of the gas over the temperature
range presently considered for the molten-salt re-
actor fuel (see Chap. 2.3, *“Chemistry,”’ for dis-
cussion of ‘*Gaseous Aluminum Chleride as a Heat

Exchange Medium®'). Operation of a thermal-
convection loop should provide an initial qualitative

‘evaluation of the effect of dissociation on the heat

transfer characterishcs of this gas.

The small-scale apparatus shown schemaﬂcully
in Fig. 1.2.19 was assembled to obtain a subli-

- mation temperature vs pressure curve for aluminum
chloride and to provide preliminary compatibility

data for-the gas in the container materials of
principal inferest. A plot of the temperature vs
vapor pressure data is presented in Fig. 1.2.20.
Incenel and INOR-8 corrosion samples installed in
the test apparatus were exposed to aluminum
chleride vapors for 1000 hr. Visual and metallo-
graphic examination disclosed intergranular attack

~ to a maximum depth of 2 mils at the high-temperature

(1200°F) end of the Inconel specimen and grain-
boundary penetration to a depth of 0.5 mil at the -
high-temperature end of the INOR-8 specimen. The ° |

DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION OF
MATERIALS TESTING LOOPS '

Forced—Circr:uliilﬂilen Loops
J. L. Crowley

Construction and operation of forced-circulation
corrosion testing loops was continued. Operation
of seven new loops was started during this peried,
and three loop tests were terminated, By the end
of September, 13 loops were in operaticn and one
loop was ready to be filled, Nine of the operating
loops are constructed of INOR-8 and four of Inconel,
A summary of operations as of Sepfember 30, 1958,
is presented in Table 1.2.5.

Of the three terminated loops, one was an In-
conel loop (93771}, one an INOR-8 loop (9354-2),
and the other an Inconel bifluid loop (designated
CPR). The decision was made to terminate loops
9377-1 and 9354-2 after the power failure on April
6 caused their failure, 12 The CPR loop was termi-
nated after completion of a year of operation to

provide space for an additional loop (see Chap. 2.1,
“Metallurgy,’’ for results of mefallurglcal exami-
nations).

Other than minor occurrences involving individual -

loops, there were only two incidents during the -
_quarter that affected all loops. The first was a-
building power failure on August 5 of less than 1
min duration that affected seven operating loops.
At this time, while an extensive emergency elec-
trical system was being installed, all loops were
equipped so that momentary power failure would
automatically place them on isothermal operation.
Five of the loops did resume operation isothermally
after the power was reapplied. On two loops,
9354.5 and 9344-2, the pump drive motors tripped
out on overload when required to restart under the
load of the magnetic clutch and the pump. These
two loops were partially frozen when circulation
was not maintained but were both successfully
thawed and placed back into operation. The over-
load breakers on all motors, although sized accord-
ing to proper electrical code, were increased to
carry a larger startup cumrent. :

The other incident that affected all loops was a
changehouse fire across the street from where the
forced-circulation comosion loops are located.

The fire destroyed the poles supplying an alternate
power source to the building and also threatened to
spread to the operating area. All operating loops on
that side of the building were placed on iscthermal
operation in preparation for dumping. [t was not
necessary to dump, however, and the loops were
returned to normal operating conditions after the
danger was past. _

Orders were placed for the fabrication of three
INOR-8 loops and two Inconel loops. One INOR-8
loop will be used as a spare and two Inconel loops
will replace two presently operating loops sched-
uled to be terminated.

Of the thirteen facilities with operating loops,
six are of the new design, which gwes maximum
protection, as described previously.'2 The re-
maining seven are in various stages of improved
protection that could be provided without dlsturbmg
the Ioop plplng.

In-Pile Loops

J. A. Cenlin P. A. Gnadt

Aﬁsembly of the first MSR in-ﬁile Ioo;S will be -
completed by November 1, and the loop is sched- -
vled for insertion in the MTR December 1, 1958

42

(MTR cycle 113). A second loop is being as-
sembled, and parts for a third loop ‘are being fabri-
cated. The second loop will provide additional

" data and serve as o backup loop in the event of a

failure of the first loop. The instrumentation and

~controls required for loop operation are bemg pre-

* pared ot the MTR.

The schedule for operation of the second loop

- will be determined by the success of the first loop
- and the outcome of pump fests presently under way,
. as described previously. 13 |n these tests, two

' methods have been tested for starting the loop in
" the reactor. The first method consisted of filling
. the loop during assembly, freezing the salt, and

- then thawing it out after insertion in the reactor.

It was demonstrated in four successive tests with
the first prototype pump that progressive meltout
from the pump to the nose coil could be achieved

~ without damage to the loop. During meltout, how-

ever, pump speed perturbations occurred, and
several hours after the fourth meltout the pump
seized. Investigation showed a large accumulation

“of salt in the intermediate region between the sump

and bearing housing and salt in a granular form
mixed with oil in the copper rotor region. Although
x-ray examination indicated that salt had collected
in the intermediate region without the concurrent
meltout procedure, melting out of 1he loop was
probably a contributing factor.

A second method of starting the loop in the re-
actor was found to be satisfactory in a second
prototype pump test. The original filling system,
which consisted of an integral fill tank that was
heated and drained into the pump after installation
in the reactor was modified by chenging the in-
ternal passages of the pump to acccommodate the
high surface tension of the salt., This system was
incorporated in the first loop.

The appearance of salt in the region bei'ween the
sump and bearing housing in both the first and
second prototype pump tests presents a further
difficulty. The melting and thawing of the loop in
the first test was thought to have been a con-

‘tributory cause; however, the salt deposit appeared

again in the second pump test-but to a lesser degree.
This salt transfer is not understood, but is be-
lieved to be, in part, a function of the suspected
high surface tension of the fluid. At present the
second prototype pump, similar to the pump used

in the first loop, is being tested to determine the

effect of this phenomenon on long-term operation.
A third test of a modified pump is being set up in
an attempt to correct the situation. Modifications
indicated by these tests will be incorporated in

 

" PERIOD ENDING OCTOBER 31, 1958

the pump of the second loop. Since censtruction of

the first loop is beyond the point that would permit
pump modification, the period of in-pile operation

will be based on the duration of the pump life test
presently in progress.

**Previously reported results repeated for completeness. S
repeated in Table 1,3.1.  Measurements of the

solid state have not been completed for the three

LiCI-KCl mixtures studied in the liquid state, .
The results of initial measurements of the mix-

ture LiF-BeF,-UF , (53-46-1 mole %) were some-

what erratic. Spemflcolly, the enthalpy values

were observed to be a function of the hecmng-
cooling cycle history of the sample. Thus, for
samples heated to 450°C and suddenly quenched

in the calorimeter, an average enthalpy of 225 cal/ g
was obtained. Data for four samples measured ot
500°C resulted in an average enthalpy of 220 cal/g,
a value less than that for the original measurements
at 450°C. Since BeF2 and mixtures containing
large percentuges of BeF,, are known to form
glasses, it was suspected that the anemalous be-
havior was associated with this phenomenon. Ac-
cordingly, the samples were remeasured with slower
cooling in the calorimeter (100 min to equilibrium

in comparison with the normal 20 to 30 min). The
slower cooling rate was uchleved by msertmg an
msulchng liner within the cavity of the copper._

block. Under these conditions, the enthalpy values

were temperature-consistent and of higher magni-
tude. Since the observed enthalpy is the energy
difference of the salt between the two given tem-

peroture Ievels, the higher values indicate a lower |

final energy state and hence a more stable form,

Evidence obtained by varying the heating rate and -

paﬂern in attaining the initial sample temperature
suggests that the upper energy state was |denhca| )
for all the samples, ' The results presented in’® =~
Table 1.3,1 for Ber-contalnmg mixtures are
based on the slow-cooling data.

The enthalples and heat cnpacmes of the LICI-

- KCI mixtures are compared in Table 1.3.2¢en a

gram-atom basis with results obtained by Douglas

" ond Dever! at the Naﬂonal Bureau of Standards
for the eutectic mixture LiCl-KCl (59-41 mole %). .

It is of interest to note the change in the tempera- -

ture dependence of the heat capacity with decreas-
ing LiCl content in the mixture. Between 500 and
800°C the heat capacity of the 70-30 mixture de-
creases by 5.7%, that of the 60-40 mixture by only
- 0.3%, and that of the 59-41 NBS mixture by 3.5%,
while that of the 50-50 mixture increases by 9.7%.
Additional data will be required for verification of
this indicated effect of composition.

750°C. Three tubes that differed in inside diam-

eter were used, |t is felt that a major source of

the observed scatter of the data is the uncertainty

in the tube-tip inside diameter as a result of pro-

gressive plugging during a test series. Future

studies will include measurement of other salts of

known surface tension and noncorrosive nature in
order to isolate the plugging effect and to estab-

~ lish accuracy limits for this technique.

Appuratus Fabrication and Calibration

The uppc:rc:tus2 for direct measurements of the
coefficients of thermal expansion of beryllium salt
mixtures has been fabrscated and is being as-
sembled. The equipment? for determining the
thermal conductivity .of the beryllium salts is being
fabricated. The thermal gradient, and hence the
heat flux, at the ends of the cylinders is to be de-
termined from temperature measurements made at @
large number of positions within the cylinders.
~ Since it was not found to be feasible to locate the
thermocouples ccaxially, interpretation of the ther-
mal profile under conditions of heat exchange at
~ the cylinder walls becomes difficult. It is planned
to analyze statistically the experimental tempera-
ture data from the initial measurements so as to
ascertain the thermocouple Iocatlons that yield
maximum heat flux precision.

Efflux-cup viscometers are being calibrated that
have larger volumes than the viscometers used
previously.2 It is believed that effects such as
“*surface-humping’’ will be sufficiently reduced to
allow more precise measurement of the viscosity
of the beryllium salts. Apparatus for the determina-
tion of the electrical conductivity of the beryllium
salts is being assembled.

MOLTEN-SALT HEAT-TRANSFER STUDIES
| Fo E.'LynCh s

Heat balance difficulties have been experienced
in the evaluation of experimental data on the hect- _
transfer coefficient of LiF-BeF -UF (53-46-1
mole %) flowing through an elecmcol-reslsfunce-
heated small-diameter Inconel tube. Specuflcally,
the measured electrical heat input has been ob-
served to be only one-half the convective heat
gained by the salt, as calculated from temperature

- and flow rate measurements. A check made with

recalibrated instruments and with additional instru-

" ments indicated that the power measurements were

not the cause of the discrepancy. New, precali-
brated thermocouples have been installed, and the
weigh-beam flow-measuring devuce has been re-
checked. A second series of runs will be mmuted

‘shortly under conditions that closely c:pproxlmate

those of the earlier experiments.

The molten-salt pumping system is belng as-
sembled. Since it is the purpose of this study to
determine whether effects such as surface film
formation occur after long exposure of the metal to
the beryllium salt, it is sufficient to obtain rela-
tive values of the heat-transfer coefficient. Itis
now planned, however, to include an experimental )
turbine-type flowmeter in the loop and also to de-
termine the flow from the pump calibration, so that -
if the flow values obtained by these two methods
consistently agree, an estimate of the heat-transfer
coefficient can be made. The system will contain .
an INOR-8 test section, if available, in addition to
the Incone! test section. The two test sections
will be located in adjacent legs of the loop, and a
three-electrode heating scheme will be used. 1t
will also be necessary to include a heat exchanger'
to control the system temperature. ‘

LOW-ENRICHMENT GRAPHITE-MODERATED
 MOLTENSSALT REACTORS

H. G MacPherson ‘

A rough survey of the nuclear charoctensﬂcs of
graphite-moderated reactors utilizing an initial com-
plement of low-enrichment uranium fuel has been-

‘made. The pertinent characteristics of a number
of such reactors are presented in Table 1.5.1, It
may be seen that reactors could be constructed

that would operate with fuel enriched initially wuth '-

as little as 1,25% U235; initial conversion ratios
as high as 0.8 could be obtained with a fuel en-

richment of less than 2%. Highly enriched uranium
would be added as make-up fuel, and such reactors

could probably be operated to burnups as high as
60,000 Mwd/ton. The total fuel cycle cost would
be approximately 1.3 mills/kwhr, of which 1.0 mill
would be the cost of the enriched U?33 that would
be burned up.

The three-phase corrosion testing program, previ-
ously described,! for which Inconel and INOR-8
thermal-convection and forced-circulation loops are
utilized, was continved. During the quarter, cor-
rosion studies were completed of two Inconel and
four INOR-8 thermal-convection loops. Examina-
tions were also completed of three Inconel forced-
circulation loops, which were the first loops oper-
ated in the third phase of the corrosion testing
program. Samples removed from an INOR-8 forced-

circulation loop that was temporarily shut down for

repair of a leak were also examined. A number of
new forced-circulation loop tests were started; the
present status of all such loop tests now in oper-

ation is given in Chap. 1.2 of this report,

Inconel 'Thefmul-Convéctflon Loop Tests

One of the two Inconel thermal-convection loops

~ examined was operated as a supplement to the first

phase of corrosion testing of Inconel in contact

with fused-flucride-salt mixtures. Loop 1222 circu-
lated salt mixture 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF ,, 62-37-1

mole %) for 1000 hr at @ moxlmum hot-leg tempera-
ture of 1350°F, and it wos attacked to o depth of

3 mils in the form of intergranular voids {Fig. 2.1.1).
Previously,? loop 1178 had circulated the same salt
mixture for 1000 hr at 1250°F ‘and was attacked to o
depth of 1 mil, Comparison of the results from the

two loop tests emphasizes the effect of operating

temperature on depth of corrosion in Inconel sys-

tems. The 100°F increase in the maximum operating

temperature coused an increase in the depth of at-

. tack from 1 to 3 mils in the 1000-hr pericd.

The second Inconel thermal-convection loop (1207)
that was examined was the first that had operated

for an extended peried of time, It circulated salt
‘mixture 12 (NaF-LiF-KF, 11.5-46.5-42 mole %) for
4360 hr at @ maximum temperature of 1050°F. The
“attack in loop 1207 was in the form of voids to a

depth of 2 mils,

‘Results of Examination of Samples Removed
from INOR-8 Forced-CnrcuIahon L -
~ Loop 9354-1

On July 29, 1958, cfter successful compleﬂon of
3370 hr of operation, loop 9354-1 was temporarily
shut down to permit the repair of a small leak ina
lug adapter near the hottest section in the loop.
The cause of the leak was traced to g probable de-
fect in the material used in fabricating the loop
{see subsequent section of this chapter on “Welding
.and Brazing Studies’').. The loop was constructed
of ‘/-ln.-OD 0.045-in.-wall INOR-8 tubing and it
cnrculated salt mixture 126, The maximum loop
wall temperature was 1300°F and the minimum fluid
temperature was 1180°F, The salt flow rate was
2.5 gpm and the Reynclds number was 2000,

'The damaged section, which was about 1 ft leng
and which is shown in Fig.2.1.6, was removed from
the loop, and 2-in. samples were cut fromthe tubing
on both sides of the lug adapter. Metallographic

interior, as shown in Fig. 2.1.7. This effect indi-
cates a faster etching rate of the boundaries near
the surface and is presumably due to a slight dif-
ference in the chemical composition ¢f the region
near the surface.  As may be seen in Fig. 2.1.8,
this surface effect is not apparent in as-received -
samples of the tubing used for the loop. The loop
was repaired by replacing the domagé'd section,
and it has again been placed in operation.

Material Inspection
- G. M. Tolson ~ J. H. DeVan

Routine inspection of the INOR-8 material now
being received has revealed that the quality is as
good as that of Inconel and of stainless steels
made to ASTM standards. The high rejection rate
previcusly found for INOR-8 welded and drawn tub-
ing is felt to have been due to poor welding quality
of the heat of INOR-8 from which the tubing was
made. The rejection of seamless INOR-8 tubing, with
defects greater than 5% of the wall thickness used
as criteria for rejection, is running well below 10%.

Fully inspected welds made on INOR-8 material
show a rejection rate of about 10%, which compares
favorably with the rejection rate of welds made on
Inconel and stainless steels. Evaluation tests were
made of thermocouple spot welds to INOR-8 tubing.
Although nondestructive testing did not reveal any
rejectable spot welds, metallographic examinations
showed microcracks in some spot welds.

Table 2.1.4. The results of tensile tests of similar
specimens and control specimens in air at 1250°F
are presented in Table 2.1.5. In general, the carbu-
rized specimens show lower ductility than that of
the control specimens. Exceptions to this trend
were found, as indicated in Table 2.1.5, for some
of the carburized INOR-8 material and for a heavily
carburized Inconel specimen that had been exposed
for 40 hr ot 1600°F in the sodium-graphite system;
the carburized pieces were more ductile than the
control specimens, These results were verified by
duplicate tests, and therefore the results of the

duplicate tests are also included in Table 2.1.5..

an average bulk densuty of 1.90 g/Cm was de-

gassed at 2370°F for 5 hr in a vacuum of Tto3p,

cooled to room temperature, and blanketed in argen.
The crucible was exposed to room atmosphere for
approximately 3 min in order to weigh it. During
all other preparations for the test, the crucible

was either sealed under an argon atmosphere or
was under a vacuum of <0.1 p. Sufficient fuel 130,
13.70 g, to fill the crucible to a depth of 3 in. at
1300°F was cast into the graphite. The loaded
crucible was tested in an inert-arc welded Inconel -
container. | '

Radiographs were used to monitor the location of
the fuel in the graphite so that the test could be
terminated if the fuel threatened to penetrate the
crucible walls. Such a radiograph revealed at the

end of 500 hr a 0.1-in.-high disk in the bottom of

‘the graphite. crucible that was relatively opaque to

the x-rays (see Flg. 2.1 J1). The remainder of the

“fuel was less opaque to the x-rays than it had been

at the beglnmng of the test. Subsequent examina-

“tion of the disk revealed that it contained UOz, the

62

disk contuined ~40 wt %l-U as compared with 7.03

wt % U in the as-received fuel. The uranium con-
tent in the disk amounted to 28% of the total amount
of uranium criginally in the fuel 130 charge; stated
in another way, the uranium concentration of the
fuel cbove the disk hcd decreased to 59% of its
original value.

Petrographic examinations of the fuel used for
this test did not reveal oxide contamination. The
fuel remaining in the batch from which the test
quantity was taken is being analyzed for oxygen.
This same source of fuel was used in a 2000-hr

~ static test at 1300°F, described in the preceding

section, in which the fuel was exposed only to
INOR-8. A radiographic examlnuhon of the fuel at

the end of that test did not reveal any precipitation

of uranium.

Different grades of grophlte and dlfferent fue Is
are being used in further tests of the compatibility
of fuels and grephite. Radiographic examinations
of systems now being tested, in which TSF graphite
(average bulk density, 1.67 g/cm?) is used to con-
tain the fuel 130, have also revealed uranium pre-
cipitation, but the quantities precipitated are less

'PrecioUSfMetqloBusé Brazing Alloys in Fuel 130
| D. H. Jonsen |

Five snlver-base brazing materials ranging in com-

position from pure silver to alloys with 42 wt % Ag
were tested in static fuel 130 for 500 hr. It was ex-
pected on the basis of thermodynamic considerations
that silver would show goed corrosion resistance to
beryllium and lithium fluorides, but, as shown in
Table 2.1.8, deep subsurface voids (as deep as 50
mils in the case of pure silver) were observed in all
the silver-containing alloys.

A gold-base alloy (75% Au-20% Cu-5% Ag) was
also tested in fuel 130 under the same conditions as
those used in the tests of the silver alloys. No cor-
rosion was found on this alloy after the test. Three
‘other gold-base alloys are being prepured for testing
in fuel 130.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF INOR-8

"R. W, Swindeman - D. A. Douglas

Short time (less than 10,000 hr) creep data for
INOR-8 obtained through tests in air conducted by
the Haynes-Stellite Company and tests in fuel 107

(NaF-LiF-KF-UF,

11.2-45.3-41-2.5 mole %) con-
ducted ot ORNL are presented in Fig. 2.1.12. Speci-

" mens tested by Haynes-Stellite were annealed 8 min

at 2150°F; ORNL specimens were annecled for 1 hr
at 2000°F. Cross plots of log t vs 1/T, where ¢t is
the time fo 1% strain and 1/T is the reciprocal of

 the.absolute temperature, yielded the straight lines

shown in Fige. 2,1.13. These parallel strmght lines
indicate that the equation proposed by Dorn? would
best represent the time-temperature-stress relation-
ship of this matericl. The slopes of these lines
yield an activation energy for creep of 76,700
cal/moles°K for INOR-8 sheet in the fused-salt
environment. A plot of various stress functions
against In [(1/¢) e76¢700/RT) revealed that the

stress dependence is of the form eB% ", where ¢

‘is the stress and B is a constant. A plot of the

data based on the equation

A honzontal line, representing the value of
In[(1/1) e H/RT] when T is 1200°F and ¢ is
10,000 hr is included on Fig. 2.1.14. The stress
corresponding to 1% strain as given by this curve

is approximately 9600 psi. -Extrapolation of the log
curve for 1200°F in Fig. 2.1.12 to 10,000 hr yields
about 11,000 psi. Thus it would appear that a stress
value of 9600 psi can be used as a conservative
estimate of the metals creep strength for the 10,000-
hr life. The results of longer tests may permit this

- value to be revised towards the 11,000-psi figure.

~ An investigation is also being made of the vari-
ation in creep properties of specimens subjected to

_identical conditions of stress and temperature.

Creep curves obtained in this investigation are
presented in Fig. 2.1.15. The data was obtained

in air at 1250°F in duplicate tests for two different
stresses, 20,000 and 25,000 psi. The greatest dif-
ferences appear to be in the rupture life and elonga-
tion rather than the creep rate. Data for all tests
completed thus far on INOR-8 in air are compiled

in Fig. 2.1.16. The variation of the

In [(1/4) e76+700/RT]

term at each stress level is an indication of the
reproducibility of the results. The Haynes-Stellite
date were obtained in short-time tests (times of

less than 100 hr), but the ORNL date include values
obtained at times up to 5500 hr.

The variations in the properties of samples taken
from different heats of the alloy are also of interest.
Creep curves obtained at 1300°F and 20,000 psi for
three different heats of INOR-8 (SP-16, SP-19, and
M-1) are shown in Fig. 2.1.17. The specimen from
heat M-1 was appreciably stronger than those from

‘the other two heats, probably because of the higher

carbon content (0.14%) of heat M-1. The strengths

WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES

- G. M. Slaughter

Mechanical Properties of Weld Deposits, —Studies
of the mechanical properties of INOR-8 weld de-
posits were continued. A vacuum-melted experi-
mental heat of this material (ORNL heat 30-38)
was found to have room- and elevated-temperature
properties comparable to those of commercial heats
fabricated by Haynes-Stellite and Westinghouse, 1%
and the ductility ot 1300°F and above was still
marginal. Thus conventional vacuum-melting did
not overcome the ductility problem. In order to de-
termine the influence of carbon on the mechanical
properties of INOR-8 weld metal, weld test plates
were constructed with the use of a high-carbon
(0.16% C) filler metal. The tensile strengths of
these welds were significantly higher than those of
conventional INOR-8 welds, but the room-tempera-
ture ductilities decreased considerably. The weld
metal properties of both Hastelloy B and Hastelloy
W were also determined in order to obtain compora-
tive data for other nickel-molybdenum alloys.

Plots of the as-welded tensile strengths ond duc-
tilities of INOR-8, Hastelloy B, Hastelloy W, and
Inconel weld metal are shown in Fig. 2.1,18. It

is evident for INOR-8, probably as a result of partial
spheroidization of the eutectic carbides,

~ The influence of carbide sphercidization is being
studied further, and high-temperature stabilization
treatments of weld metal are under investigation.

Mechanical property studies of INOR-8 welded

‘joints, both in the as-welded and aged conditions,

are also being conducted.

Filler Metal Modification Studies. = Since the
ductility exhibited by INOR-8 weld metal gt tem-
peratures of 1300°F and higher is marginal, @ pro-
gram has been initiated to determine the factors
that influence ductilityand to develop procedures
for improving it. Three heats of INOR-8weld metal
have all shown approximately the same ductility,
that is, 10% or less in a 1-in. gage length in the
1300 to 1500°F temperature range. Hastelloy W,
however, has ¢ minimum elongation of 20% in this
range.

Personnel of the International Nickel Company
have indicated that they think the trouble probably
results from trace elements in the 0.009 to 0.000]
wt % range. The use of proper addition agents
during the melting of the ingot and the proper timing
of the additions are extremely important in removing
or neutralizing these trace elements, Accordingly,

70

melts containing recommended quantities of manga-

ese, silicon, aluminum, titanium, magnesium, and
boren have been made.  The ingots are being fabri-
cated into filler wire for the preparation of all-weld-

 metal specimens for room- and elevated-temperature

testing. - Heats of filler metal have also been made
that contain additions of a commercially available -
aluminum-titaniumenickel master alloy.: -

One experiment was conducted which verifies 1he
premise that minor modifications in filler metal -
composition can result in major changes in elevated-
temperature mechanical properties. A special ingot
of INOR-8 filler metal was prepared in which most
of the nickel and all the chromium were added as
Inconel inert-arc welding wire. This Inconel wire,

‘designated Inco No. 62 (elongation at 1500°F of

70%), also contains 2% columbium to prevent hot
cracking in the weld deposit. The mechanicali
properties of this modified INOR-8 weld metal in
the 1200 to 1500°F temperature range were superior
to those exhibited by conventional INOR-B as is
shown in Table 2.1.12.

As was previously mentioned, the improvement in
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal upon aging appeared
to be associated with the spheroidization of eutectic
carbides. Therefore special heats of INOR-8 having
no carbon and 0.03% carbon have been prepared and
will be fabricated into filler wire as @ means of de-
termining the welding characteristics and mechani-
cal properties of lower-carbon-content weld deposits.

Results of Examination of INOR«8 ForcedsCircue
lation Loop Weld Failure, — An INOR-8 heater lug
section of forced-circulation loop 9354-1 failed
during service. The component and the location of
the failure are shown in Fig. 2.1.22. Metallographic
examinations of the failed area and adjacent areas
revealed profuse cracks in the INOR-8 adapter near
the lug-to-adapter weld, with the cracks resembling
those frequently observed in the heat-affected zones
of the crack-sensitive heat SP-16 material.'?

Chemical analyses of the adapter material re-
vealed it to be a high-boron, low-carbon heat of
INOR-8 and confirmed the suspicion that heat
SP-16 material had been inadvertently substituted
for the recommended heats of INOR-8. It is thought
that the cracks initiated during welding and propa-
gated to failure during service,

Brazing of Thick Tube Sheets for Heat Exchungers
o G. M, Siaughter '

The construction of heat exchangers for molten-
salt power reactor applications poses a variety of

problems, For example, it is probable that the tem-

perature and pressure conditions in some of the heat
exchangers will necessitate the use of relatively
thick tube sheets (thicknesses of 4 to 6 in. or
greater). Present practice and fabrication proce- -
dures for constructing high-integrity tube-to-tube

71

 
 

MOLTEN-SA LT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT

“sheet joints in sections of this magnitude may not
" be adequate for o molten-salt environment. The un-

avoidable notch obtained in the conventional welded

* tube-to-header joint is undesirable in several ways.
First, it may act as a starting point for crack propa-
gation in the welds during cyclic service. Also, the

- notch may act as a crevice and thereby increase the
possibility of stress-corrosion cracking, It is evi-
dent that the technique of back-brazing of the tube-
to-header joints would remedy these conditions by
eliminating the notch. Brazing would also improve
heat transfer and decrease the possibility of a leak
through a defective tube-to-header weld, since the
leak-path would be significantly increased.

Although considerable experience exists inbrozing

small diameter tubes into relatively thin tube sheets, . -

little is known of the problems associated with -
adopting these techniques to heavy sections. Ac-
cordingly, a preliminary experiment has been con-.
ducted to determine the feasibility of back-brazing
joints in thick tube sheets. A brazing procedure
was vutilized which had proved useful in fabricating
simulated components containing l‘é-in.-thick tube
sheets. |

As may be seen in Fig. 2.1.23, the brazing alloy
is preplaced in annular trepans in the tube sheet
and is fed to the joint through three small feeder
holes. Melting of the brazing alloy therefore does
not take place until the joint has attained the tem-
perature where wetting can occur, _

In an effort to extend this technique, a speci-
men was prepared that consisted of a %-in.-OD,
0.065-in.~wall Inconel tube brazed into @ 5-in.-thick

mize stresses during welding. As may be seen in

Flow of the alloy along the joint was evaluated
from metallographic examination of numerous sec-

tions of the sample. A photomicrograph of the flllet _

‘on the braze side of the tube sheet is shown in
Fig. 2,1.25, while the joint on the weld side of the
tube sheet is shown in Fig. 2.1.26." On the basis
of these observahons it can be concluded that fiow
was probably continuous along the entire 5 in. of
the joint and around the entire 360 deg of the cir-
cumference. Also no cruclung of the brnzlng ctlloy
was noted :

In- vnew of the promising resulfs of this expen-
ment, ¢ more comprehensive evaluation program is .
planned. Two é-in.-dia, 5-in.-thick tube sheets
containing five fubes are presently being machined

to determine the influence of section size on braze-

metal preplacement procedure. It is probable that
these experiments may suggest modifications in
joint design and brazing procedure. In additien,
other factors must also be studied if these experi-
ments show promise. For example, the minimum
rate-of-rise to brazing temperature to achieve satis-
factory flow during brazing of heavy tube sheets
will be affected by the choice of materials and the -
brazing atmosphere. This rate should be determined

for the base material and brazing olloy compesitions

of interest, Further, the influence of time and tem-

~ perature on the diffusion of microconstituents from
the brazing alloy into the tube walls ond to a lesser
‘extent into the tube sheet must be determined. Since
it is reasonable to expect that the base metal me-
- chanical properties will be affected, the nature of
 this effect must be known if back-brazmg is to be
-~ utilized.

Fabrication of Pump Components
G+ M. Slaughter

The problems associated with joining a mo-
lybdenum extension to an Inconel shaft for a pump
application are being investigated. The widely
different coefficients of thermal expansion (that is,

‘molybdenum, 2.7 x 10~¢ in./in./°F; Inconel,
~ 6.4 x107% in./in./ °F) present a condition of very
“high stresses during service. One methed of at-

tachment proposed by the Pump Development Group
was to utilize molybdenum fingers brazed to the
inconel shaft around the shaft periphery, The
amount of stress built up in each brozed lap joint
would thus be influenced markedly by the size of
the molybdenum fingers.

In order to test this proposed method, several mo-
lybdenum-to-Inconel brazed joints were fabricated

INOR-B THERMAL-CONVECTION LODP |
FOR OPERATION IN THE LITR.

: 'W. E. Browning, Jr.
W. H, Monfsomerv R. P. Shields

The electrically heated mockup of the INOR-8 in-
pile thermal-convection loop, previously described,!
was operated under conditions simulating those ex-
pected in the LITR. Operation of the mockup dem-
onstrated that the ports for the injection of cooling
air would have to be more widely distributed around
the loop to prevent cold spots that would be at tem-
peratures below the melting point of the fuel, The
fuel-filled mockup was operated for 771 hr at tem-
peratures ranging from 450 to 750°C, with axial
temperature differences as high as 250°C. The
following situations that will be encountered during
in-pile operation were simulated: melting the fuel,
reactor shutdown, reactor startup, reactor operation
up to one-half power, emergency shutdown required
by stoppage of fuel flow, adjusting the differential
temperature to desired value by altering distribution
of cooling air. Operation of the mockup served as
a performance test for the various components of
the loop. The experiment was terminated by a leak
in the fuel tube near an electrical contact which
conducted electrical current to the loop to simulate
fission heat. This contact, which is not a part of
the in-pile loop, had preduced higher then normal
temperctures. The mockup loop is being examined
for evidence of corrosion and for further information
as to the cause of the leak.

The in-pile model of the loop is bemg assembled,
and the required modifications in the cooling air

supply have been made. The loop was fabricated -

of INOR-8 and is to be filled with the fuel mixture

LiF-BeF,-UF, {62-37-1 mole %). Operation of this
loop wuli test the compatibility of this combination
of fuel and container material under radiation con-

ditions.

graphite capsules, described previously,? were en-

closed in Inconel containers and were filled with

the fuel mixture Li F-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %).
The preliminary exominations have indicated that
the graphite was unaffected by irradiation while ex-
posed to the fuel mixture, The graphite was wetted
by fuel in the irradiated capsules, but was not wetted
in similar unirradiated control capsules. A section
through one of the irradiated capsules is shown in
Fig. 2.2.1, and Fig. 2.2.2 shows a similar view of
an unirradiated control capsule that had been held
for 3389 hr at 1250°F. The irradicted fuel dissolved
more rapidly in water used in cleaning than did the
unirradiated fuel.

These preliminary examinations have indicated
that a fuel-cooled graphite moderator would not be
limited by damage to the graphite by fluoride fuel.
Further detailed examinations of the capsules and
fuel mixtures are under way.

cally pure compounds in the ternary system. The
compound LiF«2ThF ,, however, con take as much

as 5 mole % BeF, intc solid solution and 3LiF:ThF,
can take as much as 11 mole % BeF,. Moreover, the
introduction of BeF,uinto the structure of 3LiFsThF,
apparently causes encugh distortion of the lattice
for some 7LiF«6ThF also to be taken into solid so-
lution. Thus a roughly triangular area of homo-

compositions 67 ‘mole % LiF=11 mole % BeF,-22

established that there is practically no solid so-

lution of 7LiF«6ThF , in 3LiFsThF, in the binary

System LiF-ThF,. The nature of the solid solutions

in the ternary system is not known, but obviously
such solid solutions are not of the substitutional
type. With the i lncreoses of 7L|F-6ThF in
3L|FoThF in the ternary system, the refrochve B

birefringence is lowered. The lines of the x-ray

ently exists only as the pure ‘compound in the “
ternary system, and there is no evidence that it
enters into solid soluhon wnth any of the LiF-ThF,
compounds.

the following modifications in the preliminary die-

Data 'wefet' obtained on the éffeot of CeF. and

BaF, on the solubility of PuF, in LiF-BeF, (63-37

mole %), and the solubility of pure PuF, in the

solvent was determined at two temperatures. The
effect of CeF, on the solubility of PuF, is of
interest as an exomple of the possible effect of tri-
valent elements resulting from the fissioning of plu-
tonium in a plutonium-fueled fused-salt reactor. The
possibility of precipitating PuF; in the form of o
CeF ;-PuF, solid solution, along with trivalent
flsswn-product fluorides of Ilmuted solublllty, is
also of interest as one step in ¢ reprocessung
scheme.

The effect of BoF on PuF3 solublllfy is of in-
terest as an exomple of the possible effect of di-
valent fission-product ions. The data are shown
graphically in Fig. 2.3.6, along with prewously re-
ported data for ThF ,-containing mixtures.’ The

fraction of F’uF3 in the solute mlxture -Two of the
four data points obtained with a 1:1 molar ratio of
CeF to PuF added to the LlF-BeF (63-37 mole %)
mlxture agree qunte well with the theoreﬂcol curve,
while four of the five points obtained with a 5:1
molar ratio of CeF, to PuF, lie reasonably close to
the theoretical curve. The reason for the divergence
of the results in the other three experiments is not
clear. . ,

Similar plots of CeF, solubility values based on
preliminary analytical data show even poorer agree-
ment with theoretical curves obtained with the use
of data reported by W. T. Ward® for the solubility of
CeF, in LnF-BeF (62.4-37.6 mole %). Analytical
methods for determlmng cerium in the presence of
plutonium in mixtures of this type are being studied
and it is hoped that a better correlation between
theoretical and experimental values will be obtained
with later analytical results. It seems reasonably -
safe to assume that Eq. 1 holds well enough for

-mixtures of this type.

Data in Fig. 2.3.6 show that the solublllty of
PuF in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) con be reduced

from 0 1510 0. 026 mole % at 500°C by dissclving

0.75 mole % CeF, in the mixture at a higher temper-
ature before cooling to 500°C. The calculated con-
centration of CeF, remaining in solution at 500°C
is 0.14 mole %. By going to a lower temperature
(the liquidus temperature for the solvent is about
458°C) or a higher- cerium-to-plutonium ratio, the -
recovery of plutonium from used fuel could undoubt-
edly be improved, but it would be difficult to recover
more than 90% of the plutonium by a single operation
of this type. By reheating the filtrate and adding
more CeF, to the mixture, followed by a second
cooling and filtration operation, further improvement
in the efﬂcuency of plutonwm recovery could be
obtained. ‘
The data in Fig. 2.3. 6 seem therefore to prowde
the basis for a suitable reprocessmg scheme for -
fused-salt mixtures containing plutonium. Concen-
tration of the plutonium by precipitation would

the plutonium, possibly by fluorination. The effect
of trivalent fission products on the solubility of
PuF, is large enough so that they could not be
ollowed to build up to high concentrations, and
some of them probably should be removed cnyway to
reduce nuclear poisoning. .
Comparison of the PuF, solubility data for mix-

tures containing ThF, and BaF, with the values ob-

toined in the absence of additives, as shown in.
Fig. 2.3.6, seems to indicate that ThF, may reduce
the solubility of PuF, slightly at the lower end of
the temperature range mveshgated while the solu-
~ bility in BaF ,-containing mixtures is about the -
same as that in the ThF ,-containing solvent at
about 500°C and significantly less at 650°C. In
neither case is there sufficient data to be con-
clusive and additional experiments are planned, but

the very odd. behavior of the solubility curve for

BaF ,-containing mixtures may indicate that iso-

solvent are not linear, although they apparently are
Vinear for the system CeF ;-PuF ;-solvent and for @
number of similar systems investigated by Ward

et al.” Phase behavior in the system BaF o~PuF,
has apparently not been investigated, but |t is very
likely similar to that in the system Ban-UF
According to these investigators, UF, dissclves in
solid BaF, to the extent of about 50 mole %, while
BaF, dlsso!ves in UF; to the extent of sbout 20
mole %. The residue from one of the filtration ex-
periments with BaF,-PuF; mixtures was found by
micrescopic examination to contain PuF, that hed
optical properties that were altered sufficiently to
indicate that it may have contained as much as 10
mole % BaF,. It should be noted that, although the
concentration of BaF, remained relatively constant
in the filtrates end indicated that the amount added
was soluble in the temperature range investigated,
the molar ratio of Pqu to BaF, present in the un-
filtered mixtures varied considerably (from about 1.0
to 1.9). Since the concentration of barium in these
mixtures is far in excess of the concentration of di-
valent ions that would be produced in a power re-
actor, it seems clear that this type of fission
product would not significantly affect the solubility
of PuF, in the fuel mixture.

Comparisons of the solubilities of helium'3 and of
argon in LiF-BeF, (64-36 mole %) with their solu-
bilities in other solvents previously studied have
indicated o number of similarities and one differ-

ence. The similarities include (1) conformity to . .

Henry's law, (2) increase of solubility with in-

creasmg temperature, (3) decrease of solublhty with
increasing atomic weight of gas, and (4) increase in

the enthalpy of solution with increasing atomic
weight of gas. The difference is the value of the
entropy of solution in the LiF-BeF, mixture. While

~all the entropies of solution for helium, neon, orgon,_';
and xenon in NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %) were quite
small, about -1 eu, fhe entropy values for helivm - .
and argon are ~3.73 and —3.95, respectively, in the

The solubility of HF in LiF-BeF, mixtures was

determined as a function of temperature, pressure,

. and solvent composition. The composition was
‘varied from approximately 10 to 50 mole % BeF,, at

constants were obtained that agreed with each other
to within £5%. The averages of the 800 and 900°C
‘data at 31 mole % BeFé are believed to be low,

possibly because of consistently reproducible errors :

in the temperature measurement as a result of a de-
fective thermocouple. The values obtained at this

A Simple Method for the Estimation of Noble Gas
~ Solubilities in Molten Fluoride Mixtures

M. Blander G. M, Watson

The solubilities of noble gases in liquids may be
" interpreted with the use of a mode! similar to that
described by Uhlig.'8:1? Although the model is
elementary, it yields an interesting correlation with
experimental data. If the gas does not interact with

the liquid in which it is dissolved, the free-energy

change upon solution is related to the “‘surface’’
energy of the hole created by the gas molecule or
atom. The solubility of such a gas in a continuous
fluid medium can be shown to be given by the re-

where K_ is the equilibrium ratio of the concen-
trations in the liquid (C,) and in the gas phase
(C ), r is the radius of the gas atom (in Angstroms),
is the microscopic surface tension of the sol-
vent (in ergs/ c_rnz), R is the gas constant (in
cal/mole:°K), and the number 18.08 is the resultant
of the factors (6.02 x 10%3) (477 x 10~16) (2.39 x

face free energy (in cal/mole of @ mole of spherical

interesting to speculate that it behaves as if it were

The area of the holes is af least as large as the

“surface area of the spherical gas molecules, and |

because of thermal motions the hole would be ex-
pected to be larger than the gas atom.  The radii of

high. Values of K_ are listed in Table 2.3.7 that

predicted. This order of solubility has not often
been experimentally cbserved, since most liquids
have surface tensions so low that other solution: -
effects predominate. The difference between the
calculated and experimental values is in the di-
rection expected if the estimated size of the hole is
too small (except for argon in NaF-KF-LiF).

 The last column of Table 2.3.7 shows a trend in
the ratio of the experimental to the calculated
values of the Henry's low constants. An approxi-
mate calculation indicates that this trend can be .
explained if the polarization of the noble gas atom
by the highly ionic salt medium is taken into ac-
count. ’

It may be concluded from these calculations that
estimates can probably be made of the solubilities
of the noble gases in media of high surface tension
to within an order of magnitude. This accuracy is
satisfactory for reactor applications.

Chemi'cdl Reactions of Oxides with Fluorides

in LiF-BeF2
J. H. Shaffer

An effective means for separating uranium from
undesirable fission products is required in order to
develop a suitable reprocessing scheme for fused-
solt nuclear reactor fuels. Experiments described
previouslyzl demonstrated that uranium can be sepa-
rated from rare earth fluorides, such as Cer, in the

simple binary solvent KF-LiF. In these experiments
uranium was preferentially precipitated as Uo, by
the addition of calcium oxide to the fused salt mix-
ture.  In the presence of BeF o+ Uranium probably
can be separated from eerium cnd cerium oxides,
but apparently oxides of cerium and beryilium will
coprecipitate after the precipitation of yranium is
essentially complete. - :
In practical applications the addmon of calcium
oxide to precipitate uranium is objectionable. Con-
tamination of the fue! with calcium fluoride might
induce serious complications, such as increasing
the melt liquidus temperature. However, two alter-
nate methods of uranium separation are being in-
vestigated. First, beryllium oxide may be substi-
tuted for calcium oxide to precipitate uranium and

the rare earths. The primary advantage of this sub-

stitution is that no foreign constituent is introduced
into fuels containing beryllium. The results of pre-
liminary expenrnents with the use of beryllium oxide

~ have been reported. 22 A second method would em-

ploy a precipitant which would form o volatile
product. Reagents of this class might be water,
boron oxide, and silicon dioxide. , :

Precipitations with BeO. - A chromatographlc
type of separation of uranium and fission product
rare earths might be effected by using beryllium
oxide as the column packing material. Separations
of this type would yield a purified solvent as the
column effluent and would provide a means of con-
centrating the uranium in the column for subsequent
recovery. Pertinent information for this process in-
cludes knowledge of reaction rates, optimum particle
size of BeO, column recovery techniques, etc.

The rate of reaction of UF ; with a onefold excess
of BeO as o function of the particle size is illus-
trated in Fig. 2.3.16. Experimenta! results indicate
that the reaction of UF , with solid BeO is surface
controlled. Further experiments are in progress to
determine additional characteristics of the ex-
traction process. lt is planned, for the next series
of experiments, to use actual columns packed with
BeO and to force the liquid LiF-BeF ,-UF, mixture
to flow through the columns to determine the amount
of yranium extracted per pass. B

Surface Tensions of BeF, Mixtures
B J Sturm

Experlences in pumpmg L|F-BeF UF melts led
to interest in the surface tensions of BeF mix-
tures, and prellmmary measurements have been
made. For these measurements a Cenco-DuNouy
interfacial tensiometer?4 was used to measure the
force required to pull a platinum ring out of the
melt. Since the measurements were mode with the
liquid surface exposed to air, the results are ap-
proxlmate.

 

24podyct of the Cenco Sccentlhc Company.

A trial measurement of LiF-BeF -UF (53-45-1
mole %), with poor temperature control, gave a sur-
face tension of 195 dynes/cm ot 425 to 450°C.
Measurements of ¢ melt consisting of LiF and BeF
(63-37 mole %) gave 196 dynes/cm at about 480°C.

The surface tension of the liquid can affect the
drainage behavior, and the level of a liquid in a
capillary is directly proportional to the surface
tension and inversely proportional to the density.
Therefore a comparison of the rise in a 2-mm-ID
capillary is indicative of the validity of the results.
Such a comparison is presented in Tuble 2 3.10 for

two melts and for water.

Dlsproportionatlon of Chromous Fluonde |
' B. J. Sturm

Chromous fluoride in solution with fused alkali
fluorides disproportionates into trivalent chromium
and chromium metal (see the following section). In
an attempt to demonstrate this reaction in concen-
trated solutions, and also to prepare compounds of
NaF and CrF,, nickel capsules containing mixtures
of sodium flucride and chromous fluoride (NaF-CrF,,
50-50 and 67-33 mole %) were heated to 1000°C.

For capsules maintained at the elevated temperature
for 2 hr and cooled slowly, x-ray diffraction showed
sodium hexafluochromate (lI1) to be the principal
phase.. Capsules heated for only 2 min and -~
quenched on a copper plafe contained only a trace
of sodium hexafluochromate (ll1), the principal
phase being one regarded as sodium trifluochromate
(I1). The rapid cooling and quenching did not allow
time for disproportionation; the product was NaF-CrF
instead of 3NaF-CrF,.

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT
“ Ce** for fluoride i ions is appcrent from the decreas-
mg stability of Cr***. ,

. Similar experiments at lower temperatures ond
lower dilutions of chromium ion consistently showed
the same trend. Because of minor quantitative dis-
crepancies, which appeared presumably as a result
of analytical difficulties, the numerical results are
- mainly of qualitative interest and have been omitted

from this report.  The same is true of numerous
trials involving the addmon of CrF,, with no chro-
mium metal or Cr*** initially present, to check the
reaction 3CrF, —> 2CrF3 + Cr° Increasing dispro-
portionation (more CrF,) with decreasing ZrF,
content was quite evident. Since the chromium
metal was deposited on the nickel walls at an ac-
tivity of less than unity, the ratios of CrF, to CrF
were higher when only CrF, was added than for the
equilibrium values in the presence of excess chro-
mium metal.

- Tests were also made in solvents containing -
BeF,, which is considered to be more basic, or less

acidic, than ZrF,, since it is a better fluoride donor
for furnishing fluorides for complexing. An appre-.
ciable amount of disproportionation, CrF,/CrF, =
0.15 for 2 wt % Cr ot 800°C, wos found in LiF-BeF,
(48-52 mole %). This is roughly comparable to the
amount of disproportionation in the 35 mole % ZrF
solvent. In another BeF, mixture (LiF-BeF,-ThF,,
67-23-10) the effect of ThF , (acidic) was more than
counterbalanced by the mcreased LiF (basic) con-
tent to give & net increase in the complexing of
CrF,. Here the equilibrium CrF,/CrF, ratio was
about 0.4 ot 800°C with 2 wt % Cr; thus the solvent
containing ThF, has about the same complexing
tendency as the 15 mole % ZrF, solvent. These
results confirm the supposition that BeF, mixtures
are more basic than corresponding ZrF, mixtures
ond that the extent of disproportionation is greater
in the more basic solvents. Numerous auxiliary
trials were made to ensure that solubility limits
were not exceeded and to explore the effect of lower

dilutions and temperatures; the results were in good -

qualitative agreement with the foregoing conclu-
~ sions. Quantitative discreponcies, such as a lack
of material balance, were found that appeared to be
due to experimental difficulties, particularly with
respect to analyses.

Ferrous Fluorides. -~ Experiments similar fo those

with ‘chromium fluorides were also carried out with

FeF and FeF, in the same solvents. No dispro-

,pomonahon of FeF, was detected in any of the sol-
vent compositions at either 600 or 800°C. In the

96

course of these experiments it was noted that the

solubility of FeF, in LiF-NaF-ZrF, (27-18-55

‘mole %) 1s44wt%Feut800°Cond03w170t

600°C; in LiF-NaF-ZrF , (32-21-47 mole %) the
solubility is 0.4 wt % at 600°C. For comparison the
solubility of FeF, in NaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %) ot
600°C is 0.4 wt %, as determlned by electrometric
measurements, 25 and 0.26 wt %, as de?ermmed by
an earher filtration experrment.2

Achvity Coefficients of CrF, in NaF-ZeF,
' C. M. Blood

The activity coefficients of CrF, dissolved in the
molten mixture NaF—ZrF (53-47 mole %) at 850°C
were determined and reported previously. 27 The re-
sults of experimental measurements at 750°C are
summarized in Table 2.3.12. The tabulahon gives
the experimentally determined partial pressures of
HF and mole fractions of CrF,, together with the
resulting equilibrium quotients. In each case the
partial pressure of hydrogen was determined by sub-
tracting the partial pressure of HF from the meas-
ured total pressure, which was kept essentially
constant and very close to 1 atm. The equilibrium
quotients are also shown graphically as functions of
the mole fraction of CrF in Fig. 2.3.19. '

Examination of the results indicates thct, wnhm
the experimental precision, the results are inde-
pendent of the mole fraction of CrF, over the range
from 1 to 10 mole %. If the extrapolation of the
values of K_ is valid to infinite dilution, as shown

~in Fig. 2.3. 19 the activity coefficient of CrF, is

the activities of chromium in alloysz can now be
applied to the study of corrosion of Inconel and

corrosion is diffusion controlled. Experiments
might be carried out where corrosion would be in-
duced by the passage of HF-H, mixtures through
salts in contact with the alloys. By controlling
composition of the gas mixture it may be possible
to attack the chromium without significent effects
on iron or nickel corrosion. h

Studles of chromium dlffuswn in chromlum-con-

being developed for the depletion-method experi- -
ments that are based on the rate of loss of Cr3! (as

clloy being studied. The pots used in previous -
tests were costly, und the experlmental procedures
for their use were complicated. They were designed

are being designed to replace the pots, and equip-
ment for testing several capsules simultaneously is

"being developed.

The constant-potential method was utilized further
to prepare 'spe'cmie'ns for the study of the distri-
bution of Cr®? within the alloy. In these investi-
gations, measurements are made of the gain of Cr31
by a metal specimen exposed to molten salt con-
taining a dissolved amount of chromium 51 (as
Cr***) that remains constant with time. |t has been
found that the results obtained by this method are
extremely sensitive to the manner in which the
specimens are prepared prior fo the experiment.

The diffusion coefficients resulting from initial
experiments, which were conducted with specimens
which had been polished but not hydrogen fired,
were one to two orders of magnitude higher than
those obtained with specimens that had been pol-
ished and then hydrogen fired at 1100 to 1200°C for
3 hr. This information is of importance with respect
to the use of tracers in corrosive media, since o
large portion of the dynamic corrosion studies at
ORNL are conducted in nonhydrogen-ﬂred con-
tainers. ‘

The over-all diffusion coefﬁcuents obtained to
date, mcludmg data obtained b! Gruzin and
Fedorov3? and by Price et al.,*4 are presented as
log D vs 1/T plots in Fig. 2. 3 21. Little signifi-
cance is attached to the low values for the hydro-

f gen-flred specimens tested at 640 and 675°C, since

the radioactive count of the Cr3! was virtually at
background level for these measurements. '
The coefficients indicated at 750, 700, and 640°C
are based on the results of two or more determi-
nations at each temperatyre. The data from which
they were obtained are plotted on Fig. 2.3.22. The

~ straight lines indicate that, with the exception of a
‘small discrepancy around zero time, the square-root
‘time law utilized for the calculations is valid.

Equnpment for sectioning specimens by electro-

polishing techniques is now being developed jointly
with members of the Dynamic Corrosion Group of the
~ +ORNL Metallurgy Division. . The technique thus de-
- veloped will be used for tracer studies of chromium

diffusion phenomena in thermal-convection loops. It

energies of formation. The three polished Inconel
strips that were tested lost about 1% in weight in -
500 hr and were covered with a du!l coating, which
was identified by x-ray diffraction examingtion as
mainly Ni,Si. Large amounts of chromous chloride
and ferrous chloride, identified by x-ray and spec-
trographic examinations, were found in the aluminum
chloride in the part of the apparatus that constituted
the reservoir. This aluminum chloride reservoir had
been held at about 180°C during the test in order to
maintain a pressure of aluminum chloride of about

1 atm. A small amount of nickel was also found by
analysis to be present in the aluminum chloride in
the reservoir. A white coating on the fused silica

‘was identified by x-ray dlffrocﬂon as an ulummum

silicate.

A further corrosion exper;ment was carried out
with an all-metal system in order to avoid the for-
Purified aluminum chloride gas
was malntameg in contact with the walls of an In-
conel tube for 300 hr at 720°C. ‘A copper metal
 

reservoir containing aluminum chleride, which was
attached to the Inconel tube, was held at about
150°C to maintain a pressure of aluminum chloride
of about 125 mm Hg during the test.

Metallographic examination3® of the metal showed
the complete absence of subsurface voids. A photo-
micrograph of the test specimen (Fig. 2.3.23) shows
very large grains 1o @ depth of about 10 mils in com-
parison with the untreated fine-grained Inconel!
sample (Fig. 2.3.24). The grain growth, as well as
the irregular nature of the surface, is probably a re-
sult of the heat treatment or hydrogen firing rather
than the corrosive attack. Chemical analysis of the
contents of the reservoir showed 3.0 mg chromium,
0.2 mg iron, and 0.5 mg nickel. As expected, chro-
“mium was attacked to a much greater extent than
iron or nickel. The chromium in the reservoir repre-
sents attack on the lnconel of the equivalent of

Significonce of Expefimento'l"Resuhs

The existence of a reservoir of aluminum chloride
at o temperature of 150 to 200°C in a corrosion test
is unfavorable because the relatively cold reservoir
allows condensation of NiCl, and FeCl,. In future
tests the container will be maintained ot 650°C on
one end and 450°C on the other end to duplicate
actual conditions in a reactor. Al so, the aluminum

chloride pressure will be maintained at about 5 atm.
.Even though it is expected that CrCl will condense

at 450°C from clloys containing chromuum, the

- slight attack on Inconel found in the all-metal test
.described above is very encouraging. INOR-8, in

which the activity of chromium is much lower than
in Inconel, should prove quite resistant to cluminum
chloride vapor. The corrosion of a number of
metals, including nickel, steel, stainless steel,

_, _'_INOR-B ‘and Inconel, is under study.

however, in the practical use of aluminum chloride
is a choice of a suitable contginer material so as to

The reactions of importance in corrosion of metals
by aluminum chloride vapor are

For the case of a reactor operating at 650°C with
the temperature of the heat exchanger at 450°C,
equilibrium constants may be calculated for the
equations given above for various components from
volues of free energies of formation given by
Glassner.3® The principal uncertainty in such cal-
culations is the extent of absorption of aluminum
metal into the surface of the container as a solid
solution. :

Equation 3 should be the important reaction for

" most components of structural metals because the

pressures of MCl, calculated from this equation are
higher than those calculated from Eq. 1. The equi-
librium pressure of AICI in AICI, at 5 atm and

650°C in contact with aluminum metal is about 0.28

‘mm Hg. The equilibrium pressure of AlIC! calcu-

lated from Eq. 3 for Fe, Cr, and Ni under the same
conditions is very much less than 0.28 mm Hg.
Hence, disproportionation of AIC| should occur only
by the process of cbsorption of aluminum metal into
the surface of the container. When this occurs there
‘should be a reduction in pressures of MCI2 by re-
action with the aluminum in the container.

The equilibrium pressures of AIC| and MCl,, at
450°C are less than those at 650°C. Thus, trcnsfer

of metal from the reactor core to the heat exchanger

should take ploce.

‘Another important factor is the vapor pressure of

the equallbrlum pressure from Eq. 3, MCl, should
deposit in the heat exchanger. Therefore, suitable
metals for containing AICl, vapor should have the

“following characteristics: (l) a low oxidation-re- -

duction equilibrium pressure for the metal chicride
at 650°C and (2) a vapor pressure for the metal

Asrructural Metal Considerations

- Considerations of various possible components of
structural metals has led to the following generall-
zm‘lons '

Chromium. — A high chromium content may be un-
desirable because the equilibrium pressure of CrCl
at 650°C over an alloy such as Inconel or INOR-8 is
much higher than the vapor pressure of CrCl, ot
450°C. The deposition of CrCl, on the cooler walls
of the heat exchanger might interfere with heat
transfer. |

lron. — The equilibrium pressure of FeCl
somewhat less than that of CrC'II2 but the vapor
pressure3? of FeCl, at 450°C is higher than its_
Iron would therefore
be expected to deposit in the heat exchanger as =
metal (Eq. 3) and not serlously interfere with hea!
transfer.

Nickel. — The equ:llbrlum pressure of N|Cl at
650°C is less than that of FeCl,. The vapor pres—
sure of NiCl, at 450°C is probably high enough to
preclude deposition of NiCl, in the heat exchanger.

Manganese. — Manganese appears to be an unde-
sirable component because of a very hlgh equnhb-
rium pressure of MnCl.,.

Molybdenum. — The equilibrium pressures of mo-
lybdenum chlorides are very low. Molybdenum
should be ¢ sutlschtory component of a container
metal. : :

These generallzcmons are based solely on equi-

librium considerations and have no relation to rates

of corrosion. After initial attack on the surface of
an alloy the rate will probably be diffusion con- -
trolled, and it could be very slow. |

GASEOUS ALUMINUM CHLORIDE AS A HEAT |
EXCHANGE MEDIUM

- M. Blander R. F. Newton

Aluminum chloride has favorable and unique prop-
erties which make it, as a gas, a heat transfer -
medium of potential utility at high temperatures.
Gases ordinarily fransfer heat because of the lower-
ing of their heat content upon cooling from a temper-
ature T to a temperature T'l in a heat exchanger
occording to the equation

T
2
Hy—H,= fT‘ C, dT ,

where H 2 = H ) is ‘tﬁé: heat content increment and C

is the heat capacity of the gas at constant pressure.

Aluminum chloride exists as a dimer Al Cl; at low-
temperatures and as a monomer AICI, at high tem-
peratures.  Because of the large number of atoms -
per molecule the heat capacity of the gas is high.
Values of the heat capacities, of Al,Cl, and of
AICl, were estimated theoretically by statistical
mechanical methods, 38 from the infrared vibrational
frequencies measured or estimated by Klemperer.3?

heat capacity of AlCl, was half that of Al CI,
which was equwalent to assuming that the heat co-

pacity of AICl, is 2] cal/mole:°C. Table 2.3.14

~ presents compan sons of the heat transferred per
‘mole of Al CI & co o and He for various temper- .

ature mtervuls. On thls basis alone, it may be seen

from Table 2.3.14 that the heat transfer capacity of
AlCl, is high. A further mode of heat transfer is

possible, however, since at high enough temper-

‘atures the major gaseous species is AlCl, and at

lower temperatures the major species is Al ,Cl .
Cooling the gas in a heat exchanger will remove, in
addition to the heat obtained from the temperature
change, the heat from the reaction

The heat content as a result of the dissociation re-
action was calculated by using a value of 29.6 keal

for the entropy change,*? and the data are presented

Table 2.3.14 for the stated temperature intervals. In
column 6 of Table 2.3.14 are listed the sums of the
heat changes resulting from cooling and the heat
contribution from the dimerization. Since the number
of moles of gas molecules in a forced-circulation
loop is greater thon that calculated if it is assumed
that the gas is all Al,Cl, the values of the heat
changes must be ad;usied to obtain the heat change
of the gus per mole of gas molecules. A crude ad-
justment can be made by dividing the heat change of
column 6 by the number of moles of gas molecules
at the average temperature of the interval stated.
These values are listed in column 7 of Table 2.3.14.
The large values of the heat transferred by this
cycle of association and dissociation further en-
hance the possible utility of aluminum chloride as
heat transfer medium.

No measurement of viscosity or thermal conduc-
tivity of AICI, or Al Cl appears to have been
made. Values for these properties are needed in
design of thermal-convection loops for the equilib-
rium mixture of these gases. Accordingly values for
these properties have been estimated for the gases
at 500 and 1000°K and at 1 atm pressure. These
- approximations are not claimed to be accurate and
.are presented only to serve as rough working figures
for engineering calculations. ‘

The calculations were performed as suggested by

which exhibit the largest change of composition
with temperature, and hence at temperatures at

cal”’ heat of association.: Such results are a con-
sequence of the theory and lead to the result that
within the range that the ‘‘chemical’’ heat is
aval_lable, the average effective heat conductivity
is about 80% of the maximum valve., Thus the
most effective temperature range for the utilization
of AIC|, as a heat transfer medium is limited to_
temperatures for which the composition of the
vapor still has on appreciable fraction of both
monomer and dimer (that is, at least 5% of either).
The effective thermal conductivities and effective
heat capocrtles are not very different from the
“frozen' values outside this range. -

tions. Although an ettempt was made to be con-
servative in these estimates, they should be used

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT

2.4, FUEL PROCESSING -

‘M. R. Ben_neﬁ -

" D. 0. Campbell

G. I. Cathers

Chemical Technology Division -

 Chemical processing of the fuel and blanket salts
of a molten-salt reactor will be required in order to

- remove the neutron poisons and fransuranic elements

and to prepare the fissionable materials ond the
solvents for recycling. The fluoride volatilization
process, which was developed for heterogeneous re-
actor fuel processing and was used successfully
for recovery of the uranium from the fuel mixture
{NeoF-ZsF ‘-UF 4) circulated in the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment (ARE), appears to be applicable to
processing fuels of the type now being considered
for the molten-salt reactor.! Sufficient laboratory
‘work has been done to confirm that fluorination of
the fuel salts LiF-BeF ,-UF , or LiF-BeF ,-UF ,-ThF,
results in good recovery of the uranium.
Developmenta] work has clsc been initioted on
the processing of the solvent salt to prepare it for
recycling. The salt-recovery process is based on
the solubility of LiF-BeF, in highly concentrated
aqueous HF (70-100%) andzthe insolubility of rare-
earth and other polyvalent-element fluorides,? which
results in the recovered salt being decontaminated
from the important rare-earth neufren poisons.

FLOWSHEET FOR FLUORIDE VOLATILITY
AND HF DISSOLUTION PROCESSING OF
MOLTEN.SALT REACTOR FLUIDS

A tentative flowsheet for application of the fluoride
volatility and HF dissolution processes to molten-
salt reactor fluids has been prepared (Fig. 2.4.1).

In this system the uranium is separated from the salt
as UF6 before HF dissolution of the salt, although
the reverse system also seems to be feasible. The
LiF-BeF, salt is then dissolved in concentrated HF
(>90% Hg) for separation from the rare-earth neutron
poisons. The salt is reformed in @ flash evaporation
step, from which it proceeds to a final makeup and
purification step. This last step would perhaps in-
volve the H, and HF treatment now believed to be
necessary for all salt recycled to a reactor,

Some of the specific features of the process are to
be investigated. For example, a high sclubility of
UF, in aquecus HF would eliminate the need for
the volatilization step, except for final recovery.
This possibility appears to be unlikely, however, in
view of the low solubility of many fri- and quadri- -
valent elements. The solubilities of corrosion-
product fluorides are to be determined; a method for
recovering thorium from the waste salt is needed;
and a study is to be made of the behavior of plu- -

“tonium, neptunium, and prefactinium in the process
steps. Experience in the laboratory and in ARE

“volatility pilet plant operations® has shown that the
recycled UF is highly decontaminated from plu-
tonium, ‘

EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF
VOLATILITY STEP

A series of small-scale flucrinations was carried
out with a 48 mole % LiF-52 mole % BeF , eutectic
mixture containing 0.8 mole % UF‘. (MSR fuel will
contain frem 0.25 to 1.0 mole % UF ,, depending on
the operating time.} The eutectic salt was used in-
stead of the fuel salt in order to permit operation at
lower temperatures. Fluorinations at 450, 500, and
550°C indicated that the rate of uranium removal in-
creased with the temperature (Table 2.4.1). It is not
known whether the increased fluerination time ap-
pdrently required for quantitative uranium recovery ot
the lower temperature was compensated for by a
decreased corrosion rate,

The thorium-centaining blanket salt cannot be pro-
cessed at so low a temperature as that used to
process the fuel salt. The uranium concentration in
the blanket, however, is very low; it has been esti-
mated that with continuous processing at the rate of
one blanket volume per year, the blanket salt
(LiF-BeF ,-ThF , 71-16-13 mole %) will contain
approximately 0.004 mole % UF , after one year and
0.014 mole % UF , after 20 years.4 Fluorinations of

SOLUBILITIES OF LiF«BeF, SALTS
' "IN AQUEOUS HF

Initial measurements of the seolubilities of LiF
and BeF,, separately, in aqueous HF solutions indi-
cated that both materials are soluble to an appre-
ciable extent in solutions containing 70 to 90 wt %
HF (Tobles 2.4.2 and 2.4.3). In general, LiF is
more soluble than BeF, at higher temperatures, but
the effect of temperature on BeF, solubility was not
definitely established. In fact, it is thought that
some of these preliminary values for beryllivm
solubility are too low. The LiF solubility decreases
rapidly as water is added to anhydrous HF, and the
BeF, solubility increases from near zero; the solu-
bilities are roughly the same in 80 wt % HF, being
about 25 to 30 g/liter. The BeF, was quite glassy
in appearance and was slow in dissolving. The
solubility values reported for LiF in Table 2.4.2,

except those at 12°C, were obtained after refluxing

HF over the salt for 3 hr. No further measurements
were made with LiF or BeF, alone, since the solu-
bilities of the two cornponents together were of
primary importance,

The BeF ., solubility was measured in nommal 70
80, ond 90 wt % HF containing a known amount of
LiF that was below the solubility limit. The results

of these measurements (Table 2.4.4) show a marked

increase in BeF, solubility with LiF present, as

compared with the results given in Table 2.4.3.
Values obtained for the solubilities of LiF and

BeF, in solutions saturated with both saltsare

be more aﬁpcrent in more: dilute H.F mwl'lere the LiF
solubility is lower and the BeF, solubility is higher.

Because of the increase in BeF2 solubility in the

higher HF concentrations when LiF is present, the
90 to 100 wt % HF range was studied further. It was
expected that the more nearly anhydrous system::
~would present fewer complicatiens resulting from -
hydrolysis. The solubilities obtained in 90 to 100
wt % HF saturated with both LiF and BeF, are pre-
sented in Table 2.4.6. Measurements were mude at
the reflux tempergtures indicated, at 12°C, and ot
~80°C; in some cases, the measurements at ~60°C
were probably taken without the system being at
equilibrium. The BeF, solublllty is appreciable
even in anhydrous HF m the presence of a large
concentration of LiF, in marked contrast to the
solubility in the absence of LiF. Thus solubilities

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRESS REPORT

" high enough for a workable processing system are

available even in anhydrous HF, provided the LiF
concentration can be malniumed at the saturation
value, _ _

The effect of temperature on the solubilities is
complicated by the interaction between the two con«
stituents. LiF is less soluble at lower temperatures.

| However, the change in solubility of BeF with

temperature is less obvious, with an upparent in-
crease in solubility at =60°C compared with 12°C,
especially at the higher HF concemrahons.

The fuel salt w:ll contain 48 wt % LiF and 52 wt %
, so the highest fuel solubilities should be ob-
tama le with the HF concentration for which. the
LiF and BeF,, solubilities are about the same, that
is, cbout 90 wt % HF. In order to check this ob-

_servation, solubility measurements were made in

80, 90, 95, and 98 wt % HF solutions for an LiF-
BeF, (48.52 wt %, 63-37 mole %) salt containing
about 0.1 mole % ZrF ,, 0.2 mole % mixed rare-earth
fluorides (Lindsay Code 370), and trace fission
products. The salt was crushed; it was not ground
to ¢ powder. Average particles were flakes about
10 mils thick and 50 te 100 mils ocross. The so-
lutions were sampled 15 and 60 min after salt
addition to permit an estimate of the rate of disso-
lution. The results (Table 2.4.7) indicate that an
appreciable concentration is reached rapidly, but
that the solutions are not saturated, especially with

-respect to BeF,, in less than several days. These

~ results also demonstrate that the fused salt bes

haves similarly to the two componenfs odded ine

dividually.

The aqueous HF soluhons of the salt were fll-
tered through sinfered nickel and radiochemical
analyses were made in order to determine the
fission-product solubilities. The results, pre-
sented in Table 2.4.8, show that rare earths, as
represented by cerium, were relatively inscluble in
the HF solution and were therefore effectively
seporated from the salt. The solubility decreased
as the HF concentration was increased. The total
rare earth (TRE) and trivalent rore earth (except
cerium) analyses do not show this separation be-
cause of the presence of the yttrium daughter of

_strontium. - No rare earth activity other than cerium

was detected in the HF solutions. The slight
apparent decontamination from strontivm is not
understood; strontium is expected to be fairly
soluble in these solutions. Cesium is known to be
soluble, but the solubilities of other neutron poisens
have not yet been investigated.

Thus, the rare earths, as represented by cerium,
are removed from LiF-BeF,, salts by dissolution of
the salt in an aqueous HF solution; and strontium
ond cesium are not. The rare-earth solubility in
HF suturated with LiF and BeF, increases from
about 10~4 mole % in 98 wt % HF to 0.003 mole % -
in 80 wt % HF, based on the amount of LiF + BeF,
dissolved; the reactor fuel will contain rare eurths
at a concentration of about 0.05 mole %. '
