MSRE OPERATOR TRAINING AND OPERATING TECHNIQUES

R. H. Guymon

ABSTRACT

The MSRE was a unique, fluid-fuel reactor that operated successfully
at ORNL from 1965 through 1969. MSRE operators and supervisors, mostly, -
veteran ORNL employees, were trained and examined within the Molten-Salt
Reactor Program. Formal training sessions were held at the beginning of
prenuclear testing, just before initial criticality and before the ap-
proach to power. Training of replacements and retraining of operators
was a continuing effort. This report describes the training, the infor-
mation provided for use by the operators, operations planning and adminis-
tration, and the use of procedures. Recommendations by the author (former
MSRE operations chief) conclude the report.

1. INTRODUCTION

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program was the development
of a practical breeder reactor in which the fissile and fertile materials
are incorporated in a molten mixture of fluoride salts.l! A major step in
that development was the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), a 7.4-MW
reactor that operated at ORNL from 1965 through 1969. The main purpose
of the MSRE was to demonstrate that the desirable features of the molten-
salt concept could be embodied in a practical reactor that could be con-
structed and maintained without undue difficulty and one that could be
operated safely and reliably. This purpose was accomplished, as the MSRE
operated for long intervals and with a high overall availability.?s3

Among the factors contributing to the success of the MSRE were the
very thorough preparations for operation, including careful selection and
training of operating personnel, and the disciplined manner in which the
operation was planned and conducted. It is the purpose of this report to
describe these aspects of the MSRE. Only brief descriptions of the physi-
cal plant and its history are included, since these have been widely re-

ported.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MSRE

The MSRE was a single-region, graphite-moderated, thermal reactor
which produced heat at a rate of 7.4 MW(th). The fuel was UF, (originally
235y and later 233U) in a carrier salt of LiF-BeF,~ZrF,. At the operating
temperature of 1200°F, this salt was a liquid with good physical proper-
ties ~~ viscosity, 8 centipoise (about like kerosene); density, 135
1b/£ft3; heat capacity, 0.57 Btu/lb °F; and a very low vapor pressure .of
<0.1 mm Hg. The liquidus temperature of the fuel salt was 813°F, so the
equipment and procedures had to be designed to prevent freezing. The salt
also had to be protected from contact with air to minimize corrosion and
accumulation of oxides.

The design conditions for full-power operation are shown in the flow

diagram (Fig. 1). The general arrangement of the plant is shown in Fig. 2.

In the reactor primary system, the fuel salt was recirculated by a sump-
type centrifugal pump through a shell-and-tube heat exchanger and the re-
actor vessel. The heat generated in the fuel salt as it passed through
the reactor was transferred in the heat exchanger to a molten LiF-BeF;
coolant salt. The coolant salt was circulated by means of a second sump-
type pump through the heat exchanger and through the radiator where the
heat was dissipated to the atmosphere. The rate of heat removal was con-
trolied by using either one or two blowers and by adjusting doors in the
radiator air stream and dampers in a bypass stream. Drain tanks were pro-
vided for storing the fuel and coolant salts at high temperature when the
reactor was not operating. Drain and transfer lines included freeze valves,
where salt could be frozen or thawed to block or permit flow. The salts
were drained by gravity, and were transferred back to the circulating sys-
tems by pressurizing the drain tanks with helium. Electric heaters were
used to keep the salt molten in the tanks and to preheat the piping system
before filling. Diesel~powered generators provided emergency power for
heaters and salt pumps. The salt systems normally operated with the cover
gas at 5 psig.

Most of the fission products remained in solution in the fuel salt.
One class, known as "noble metals,'" deposited on graphite and metal sur-
faces. The gaseous fission product s, krypton and xenon, were removed con-
tinuously from the circulating fuel salt in the fuel pump tank. There they
transferred from the liquid to the helium cover gas and were swept out of
the tank by a small purge stream. This stream passed through holdup piping,
a filter, and long, water-cooled beds of activated carbon. The passage of
krypton and xenon through these beds required days to weeks, by which time
all the radioisotopes but the ®3Kr had decayed so that the stream could be
safely diluted with air and discharged to the atmosphere.

The fuel and coolant systems were provided with equipment for taking
samples of the molten salt while the reactor was operating at power. The
fuel sampler was also used during operation for adding small amounts of
uranium or plutonium to compensate for burnup. An array of graphite and
metal specimens at the center of the core was removed and replaced peri-

odically during shutdowns.
The negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of the fuel and
graphite moderator made nuclear control of the system very simple. How-
ever, three control rods were provided for adjusting temperature, compen-
sating for buildup of fission products, and for shutdown.

Instrumentation was installed to adequately monitor all variables and
to automatically handle any anticipated malfunctions. This, together with
collection of much data by an on-line computer, made it possible to operate
with a minimum operating crew,

Because of the fission-product activity, the fuel-salt equipment was
contained in heavily shielded cells that were kept sealed except when main-
tenance was being done with long-handled tools through openings in the cell
roof. The fuel off-gas system was also shielded and contained. Radiation
zones were established around the coolant salt system and a few other lo-
cations, but normal operation of the reactor did not require entry into
these zomnes.

Although not shown in Fig. 2, the plant included a simple processing
facility for treating full 75-ft3 batches of fuel salt with hydrogen fluo-
ride or fluorine gases. The hydrogen fluoride treatment was used for re-
moving oxide contamination from the salt as H,0 vapor; the fluorine treat-

ment, for removing the uranium as gaseous UF6.

3. CHRONOLOGY

Design of the MSRE was started in the summer of 1960. Construction
of the primary system components and modifications of an existing building
to house the MSRE began in 1962 and by mid-1964, installation of the
salt systems was completed.8

Early in the design and development of the MSRE, some of the engineers
involved were assigned to become members of the operating staff. As design
and construction progressed, these engineers made periodic reviews and in-
spections to assure that proper consideration was being given to opera-
bility. They also began writing procedures for checkout and operation of
the systems and components. The engineer who was to head the operations

staff was given the responsibility for detailed planning of the training
program, and he and the other engineers prepared the instructional material.
As indicated on Fig. 3, the initial operating staff was assembled by July,
1964 and basic operator training was started on July 6.

As construction was completed on more parts of the plant, the effort
spent on checking, calibrating, and testing increased. In late September,
operations were placed on a 24-hour, 7-day basis with four rotating-shift
crews. Flush salt was added to the fuel flush tank, coolant salt was added
to the coolant drain tank, and auxiliary equipment was put into operation.
The fuel and coolant circulating systems were filled with salt and the
plant was operated during most of January and February, 1965. The loops
were then drained to hydrofluorinate the flush salt, to load fuel carrier
salt, and to complete other preparations for zero-power nuclear operation.
During this precritical shutdown, several weeks were spent in advanced
training of the reactor operators, with emphasis on nuclear aspects, and
the administration of comprehensive certifying examinations by Molten-Salt
Reactor Program supervision.

Criticality was attained on June 1, 1965 and the zero-power nuclear
experiments were completed during that month. The reactor was then drained
for completion of shielding and containment provisions and minor modifi-
cations. During this shutdown, the operators underwent additional training
and testing with emphasis on power operation. Nuclear operation was re-
sumed in December, 1965. After some difficulties with the fuel off~gas
system were overcome, full power was attained in May, 1966. By December
of that year, the planned program of startup testing had been completed
and solutions had been found to the various problems that had arisen. As
indicated in Fig. 3, the reactor was at full power a large percentage of
the time for the remainder of the operation with 235U, which ended in
March, 1968. During the 5-month shutdown in 1968, core specimens were
changed, various maintenance was done, the flush and fuel salts were pro-
cessed to remove the uranium, and a charge of 233y fuel was added to the
fuel carrier salt. During these months, time was available for guided
self-study by the operators, and before nuclear operation was resumed, they
were reexamined.

Criticality was attained on October 2, 1968 and on October 8, USAEC

Chairman Seaborg took the reactor power to 100 kW, marking the first time

Chronology of Operator Training and Reactor Operation.

 

 

 
that any reactor had been operated with 233y fuel. After completion of
rod-calibration and other tests, the reactor was taken to full power in
January 1969. Investigations of the effects of gas circulating with the
fuel involved revisions to permit operation of the fuel pump at reduced
speed. Power operation continued until the first of June when the loops
were drained to change the core specimen array and to make preparations
for some special expefiments. |

The remainder of the operation involved extensive sampling, gamma
scanning, and varying of operating conditions to study the distribution
of fission products and tritium. Consideration of the limited funds
available to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, the fact that the primary
goals of the MSRE had been achieved, and the funding needs of other molten-
salt breeder development led to a decision by program management to termi-
nate the MSRE operation. Accordingly the reactor was shut down on Dec. 12,

1969 and within 2 weeks the operating staff was disbanded.

4. OPERATING PERSONNEL

The initial operating staff was comprised of four crews, each con-
sisting of two engineers and three technicians, all under the supervision
of an operations chief and assistant operations chief, and augmented by
two day-shift technicians. Long-range planning, analysis of data, mainte-
nance coordination, and design changes were handled mostly by other groups
within the MSRE QOperations Department, whose original organization is out-
lined in Fig. 4. In addition to those shown, personnel of other ORNL di-
visions such as chemical analysis groups, health physics, industrial hygiene,
metallurgy, chemistry, instrumentation, computer programming, and maintenance
forces contributed significantly to the MSRE.

After the completion of the nuclear startup tests, the shift crews
were each reduced to one engineer and three technicians. Later, after the
operation became more routine, each crew was further reduced to 3 tech=-
nicians. On day shifts or when special experiments were being run this

3-man crew was augmented by an engineer and 1 or 2 technicians.

Turnover in personnel was moderate; between July 1964 and December 1969
3 engineers and 5 technicians joined the operations group and 10 engineers
and 4 technicians left the group.

The duties of the original operating staff were as follows.

The Operations Chief was responsible for organizing and training the
operations staff., He participated in long-range planning, general policy
decisions, and safety reviews of the reactor. He (or the Assistant Opera-
tions Chief) was responsible for the execution of the daily experimental
program and decided on the course of action to be taken in case difficul-
ties prevented carrying out the planned program.

The Assistant Operations Chief, in addition to substituting for or as~
sisting the Operations Chief in the above, investigated special operational
problems encountered, reported on operational activities at planning meet~-
ings, and directly supervised the activities of the day-shift technicians.
The Operations Chief and Assistant Operations Chief were on call at all
times. There were frequent communications between them and the evening
and midnight shifts and all shifts over the weekends.

The day-shift technicians helped in special experiments, helped take
routine samples, maintained records of chemical analyses, filed other data,
maintained operating supplies including log forms, check lists, etc., and
provided vacation relief for the regular operators.

Each Shift Supervisor was responsible for coordinating and overseeing
all operations and maintenance on his shift., It was his duty to carry out
all shift instructions, to maintain an overview of the plant with special
alertness for anomalous conditions, and to keep all members of his crew in-
formed of changes in equipment, plans, or operating procedures. He was re-
quired to be especially familiar with all equipment and operations so as to
be able to react promptly and effectively to any emergency.

The Assistant Shift Supervisor assisted in the foregoing duties and
handled special tasks such as the numerous tests required during the start-
up phase of the MSRE.

The three technicians on each shift rotated through three different

assignments; building-log, control~room, and utility. The building-log
11

technician was responsible for taking all routine data except the control-
room log. During each 8-hour shift, he made 2 complete rounds of the re~
actor site and was responsible for noting any abnormalities or departures
from the recommended maximum and minimum limits shown on his log sheets.
The control-room technician took the control-room log, calculated and plot-
ted important data, and was responsible for the operation of the reactor
from the control room. He kept a written record in the console log of all
occurrences during his shift. The utility technician was responsible for
sampling and miscellaneous tests and duties as requested. Because the
three assignments were rotated, each operator had a good understanding of
the overall operation and a familiarity with each job.

In the final organization, one of the three technicians on each crew
was designated Chief Operator and assumed most of the duties of the previ-
ous shift supervisor. Candidates for Chief Operator were given additional
training and examination before being given responsibility for the shift.
Six technicians were certified as Chief Operators so that vacation relief
could be handled. An engineer was assigned as shift supervisor on the day
shift to handle the extra work assoclated with coordinating special tests
and scheduled maintenance.

The educational background and previous experience of the original
staff plus those who were later added are summarized in Fig. 5.

All of the supervisors had BS degrees or equivalent. Two were reactor
school graduates. Five had majored in chemical engineering, 2 in nuclear
engineering, 2 in mechanical engineering, and one each in electrical engi-
neering, marine engineering, electronic engineering, and chemistry. Two
of the shift supervisors came to MSRE as new hires, having just received
BS degrees in nuclear engineering. The others had a minimum of 7 years of
prior experience in design and/or development. The average period of prior
employment by Union Carbide was 13 years (including the new hires).

Most of the technicians had at least 2 years of college (average 2.6)
and a minimum of 4 years design or operating experience (average, 12) be-
fore coming to the MSRE. The average period of prior employment by Union

Carbide was 12 years.

5. TRAINING

Although most of the MSRE operating staff had had considerable previ-
ous experience and several had an intimate familiarity with some parts of
the plant, all were required to participate in a training program leading
to examination and certification. Because of the unique nature of the
MSRE, the content of the training program and examinations was determined
by Molten-Salt Reactor Program personnel.*

The goals of the training program were to instill in each operator
and supervisor the proper attitudes, a good basic knowledge of the entire
plant, an adequate understanding of every phase of the operation, and a
familiarity with the procedures that he would be following. The approach
used at the MSRE, chosen on the basis of past experience, was a combina-
tion of formal training, self-study, and on-the-job training. Maximum ad-
vantage was taken of the special knowledge of members of the staff, by us-
ing them as instructors for the subjects in which they were experts. Other
instruction was given by members of ORNL's Health, Health Physics, Instru-
mentation and Control, Reactor Chemistry, and Chemical Technology Divisions.

The initial period of formal training began when the staff was first
assembled in July 1964. The second formal training period (called pre-
critical training) followed the initial flush-salt operation. After the
zero—power experiments, the reactor was again shut down and in the fall
of 1965 we had the third formal training period (called prepower training).
In 1967, before technicians were certified as Chief Operators, they were
given special training. Prior to the beginning of operation with 233U fuel
in 1968, extra time was allocated to all operators for self-study but there
were no formal training sessions.

As indicated in Table 1, a total of approximately 350 hours was spent

in formal training on various topics. In addition, considerable time was

 

*Although the details of training and examinations were not subject to
outside approval, the entire operation of the MSRE, including operator
training, procedures, etc., was reviewed periodically by the ORNL Reactor
Operations Review Committee. There was also an annual safety review by an
AEC~0ORO committee and the Operating Safety Limits required AEC approval,

Initial Training

 

The initial training period lasted several months. Most of the time
during the first few weeks was spent in classroom sessions with some self-
study periods and tours. Later, less time was allocated to classroom in-
struction and more time was spent in checking out flowsheets, labeling
equipment, lines, valves, and switches, shakedown of equipment, and self
study.

Assignments had been made at least a month in advance and time had
been allocated for the instructors to prepare for the training sessions.
As this was the first step in the development of the operating crew, the
teachers were instructed to cover all information which might be needed
by all operating personnel, but to present it so that it could be under-
stood by newly-hired operators who knew nothing about the reactor. All
sessions were held in a conference room at the reactor site where a black-
board, slide projector, and opaque projector were available. Future oper-
ators and supervisors attended all sessions; other project personnel at-
tended those sessions pertaining to their future responsibilities at the
MSRE.

The schedule followed for the first 4 weeks and the instructors for
the lecture periods are given in Appendix A. The first session was an in-
formation and orientation meeting coﬁering such items as organization
charts, schedules, and plans. This was followed by a general description
of the reactor emphasizing the functional interrelationships, and omitting
nonessential detail. Drawings of the building and general equipment lay-
out were then discussed, followed by guided tours. Instruction then turned
to the design of the various systems and equipment, interspersed with ses-
sions on the basic subjects of molten-salt chemistry, reactor physics,
health physics, and industrial hygiene. Beginning on July 15, emphasis
was switched from details of design to methods of operation. The startup,

normal operation, shutdown, and unusual operation of each auxiliary system
16

was covered. This was followed by instruction on the actual startup of
the reactor, including heatup, addition of fuel salt, filling the reactor,
and going to power.

During the period from July 21 to July 28, classroom training was held
only in the mornings with self-study and equipment checkout in the after-
noons. In the morning sessions, training on control circuits and instru-
mentation was started and subjects not completed in the first 2 weeks were
covered. In the afternoons, the staff was divided into four groups and
each group was assigned certain systems to check out flowsheets. Phase 1
of the flowsheet checkout involved a thorough check to assure that the
flowsheets agreed exactly with what had been installed. When a group had
finished checkout of a system, they were considered experts and in Phase 2
provided detailed guided tours of their systems to all other operators,
(Instructions given to the operators are reproduced in Appendix B.)

During the following 3 days, the assistant operations chief and the
4 shift supervisors spent full time at the Oak Ridge Research Repctor ob-
serving a startup. The remaining crew had classroom discussion, equipment
study in the field, and visited moltenw=salt test loops.

On August 3, 1964, all trainees were given their first test, containing
153 questions with 2-1/2 hours allocated to complete it., This first test,
made up mainly from questions noted during the training sessions, was not
intended as a qualifying examination but rather as a guide to each indi-
vidual as to his relative progress. On this, as well as later tests, it
was felt that there should be definite answers to all questions. Therefore,
multiple choice, true/false, matching, and filling blanks were used where
possible. A test of this type minimizes misunderstanding of the questions
and allows coverage of a wide variety of subjects in a reasonable time.

No intentional trick or catch questions were used. Where conflicting in-
formation was given in different sources or where the exact answer was not
important, a range of answers was accepted. In the assignment of credit
for each question, an attempt was made to weigh the difficulty and/or im-
portance of the question. The time allocated was considered to be adequate
for most people to finish. The distribution of grades on the test for the

23 engineers and technicians who took it are shown in Fig. 6.

The papers were graded promptly and were returned for self-evaluation
by each individual and further study. Although this was the primary pur-
pose, comparisons were made of average grades in various subject categories
in an attempt to determine which areas needed the most additional training.
The results, listed below, showed that the trainees had learned the physi-
cal layout rather well, and showed little difference in proficiency among

the other subjects.

From August 4 to August 18, 1964, 2 to 4 hours each day were spent
on training sessions emphasizing control circuits. The rest of the time
was used for self-study and operational duties. Self-study consisted of
studying available documentation as well as tracing out lines, studying
equipment in the field, and becoming familiar with the area. Operating
duties included such items as checkout, calibrating and operating equip-
ment, making up log forms, procuring supplies, and labeling panel boards.

All operating personnel attended all sessions of a special MSRP In-
formation Meeting on August 18 and 19, 1964. The meeting recognized the
completion of MSRE construction as an important milepost and the papers
presented there gave a comprehensive picture of the development of molten-
salt reactor technology up that point. (The papers were issued as an ORNL

report, reference 9.)
19

The period between August 20 and late September 1964, when rotating-
shift work started, was spent largely on operating duties. Formal train-
ing consisted of some additional control circuit instruction and a thorough
review of the fuel, coolant, and all auxiliary systems. Each system was
assigned to an operations engineer and sufficient classroom time was allo-
cated to cover all information pertinent to operation of the reactor. Top-
ics covered included normal startup, normal operation, unusual or special
operations, normal shutdown, operating limits, associated instrumentation
and operation prior to criticality. A short quiz was given after each ses-
sion to determine progress.

During the prenuclear operation and testing, nearly all of the reactor
equipment was operated except for the heat-removal equipment, containment,
and control rods. This valuable on-the-job training was supplemented by
informal training by shift supervisors and day persomnel. To stimulate
self~study, each person was asked to submit a list of questions and an-
swers which he felt were important. These were reviewed to eliminate dupli-
cation, other questions were added to fill in gaps and the final compila-
tion of 569 questions and answers plus a separate group of 42 questions and

answers on nuclear characteristics were issued for study.

Precritical Training and Certification

In March 1965, when the reactor was shut down for completion of prep-
arations for zero-power nuclear tests, the operating personnel were taken
off shift for intensive training, examination, and certification. All re-
ceived two weeks of formal training in which radiation safety and nuclear
instrumentation and control were stressed. The engineers were given an
additional week of formal training, with emphasis on nuclear aspects of
the MSRE and discussions of the zero-power physics experiments. The sched-
ule for this session is given in Appendix C.

Two steps were taken to develop some familiarity with and proficiency
in nuclear testing and operation. First, each person participated in a
criticality experiment at the ORNL Pool Critical Assembly (PCA). Second,

a realistic simulation of the MSRE was set up and was used extensively.
20

The MSRE simulation made use of a TR-10 analog computer set up in the
MSRE control room, with input signals from the control-rod position indi-
cators. Outputs representing log count rates, log power, period, and lin-
ear power were sent through the actual instrument and control channels,
including displays in the reactor control room.l® Thus it was possible
for each operator to practice taking the reactor critical, using the same
procedures and controls and reading the same instruments that would be used
later in the actual experiments. To further familiarize personnel with the
controls and response of the MSRE each crew was given a set of "experiments"
or problems relating to predicted criticality, rod worth, etc., that they
were required to carry out on the simulator.

On April 13, 1965, all operators were given a qualifying examination
containing 300 questions and lasting 7 hours. An additional test, con-
taining 57 questions and lasting 1 hour, was given to the shift super-
visors and assistant shift supervisors. An outline of the tests and sample
questions are given in Appendix D. Before the tests were graded, passing
grades for each subject were established by the MSRE Department Head and
the MSRE Operations Chief. A breakdown of the various categories and the
number of persons failing to meet the standard is given in Table 2. The
overall tests grades are plotted in Figs. 7 and 8 along with a weighted
average passing grade,

After the tests had been graded, each person was examined orally by
the department head and the operations chief to verify that his test scores
accurately reflected his understanding of each subject. In addition, vari-
ous situations were posed and questions asked to determine how the operator
would react under unusual circumstances. During the oral examinations,
subjects apparently needing additional study were noted and were pointed
out to the individual so that self-improvement could be made. If the exam-
iners judged the person to be qualified, he was formally certified. 1If
not, he was given further time for self-study and informal instruction.

He was then reexamined and in most cases showed sufficient improvement to
be certified.

Before startup at least one shift engineer and 2 technicians had been
certified on each shift. Uncertified persons were not permitted to operate
any of the controls relating to nuclear operation except in the presence

and under the supervision of a certified operator.

Criticality was attained on June 1, 1965. During the zero-power runs
very little time was available for any training other than that gained from

carrying out the detailed experimental procedures.lls12

Prepower Training

In September and October 1965, during the shutdown prior to approach
to power, each operator was given a week of formal instruction. (Since it
was not possible to leave the reactor unattended, two training sessions
were provided, with half of the operators in each.) The subjects covered
and time spent on each are given in Appendix E. The session included some
review coupled with detailed instruction on the operation of equipment and
systems not in use during the previous operational period.

Provisions were also made to allow each operator to practice simulated
power operation, using two TR-10 analog computers connected to the reactor
controls and instrumentation.!® Inputs to the computers were signals indi-
cating the actual positions of the rods and radiator doors and the actual
pressure drop of the cooling air across the radiator. The outputs indi-
cated on the reactor instrumentation were linear power, log power, log
count rate, period, fission chamber position, reactor inlet temperature,
reactor outlet temperature, radiator salt outlet temperature, radiator salt
AT, and radiator heat power (flow times AT). The operators practiced
taking the reactor critical and raising and lowering the power using manual
or automatic load control. Simulator problems were solved such as deter-
mining the power level with various load system configurations, determining
the heat capacity of the loop, and determining the temperature and power
coefficients of reactivity.

Prior to startup for power operation, a 2-hour written examination
was given to all operators and an additional one-hour examination was given
to the engineers. The distributions of grades for these examinations are
given in Figs. 9 and 10. Sample portions of the exaﬁinations are given in
Appendix F, As was done on the pre-critical certifying tests, each person
was examined orally before he was certified for operating the reactor at

power,

Training of Chief Operators

The reduction of the operating crews to three men each had been care-
fully considered from the standpoints of safety and effectiveness and was
judged to be feasible. (By mid-1967, equipment difficulties encountered
during early operation had been overcome and the test program was well into
its sustained high-power operation phase, so that unusual demands on the
operating crews on other than the day shift had been minimized.) It was
recognized, however, that the technicians who were to take over the super-
vision of the crews would need some special training for their new duties.
Six candidates for Chief Operator were chosen on the basis of their past
experience and test grades, and the opinions of the shift supervisors, as-
sistant operations chief, operations chief, and operations department head.
These technicians were given the additional instruction outlined in Appen-
dix G. Training was on an individual basis and to some extent was tailored
to the individual's need. Emphasis was placed on duties previously handled
by the shift supervisors, such as trouble-shooting, tracing out control
circuits, etc. After instruction, each candidate was given charge of a
shift for one or two weeks with an original shift supervisor on duty but
acting only as adviser. They were then given a 2-1/2-hour closed-book
written examination and a 1-1/2-hour open-book written examination. Sample
portions of these examinations are given in Appendix H. All 6 candidates
passed and after oral examinations, all were certified as qualified Chief
Operators.

It appeared that considerable benefit was gained from this training.
Therefore, it was subsequently given to ali the other operators. No exami-

nation was given to the others, however.

Training Before 233y Startup

The 5-month shutdown that followed the end of extended operation with
2357 fuel and preceded the 233y startup experiments was recognized as an
appropriate time for refresher training of the operators. Instead of train-
ing sessions attended by the entire staff, however, a program of self-study

and small-group study was initiated. The schedule was rather flexible to
28

permit other jobs to be carried on, but a date was announced on which all
members of the operating staff were to be reexamined. The nuclear aspects
section of the Operating Procedures!! was revised to show the calculated
reactivity coefficients and other characteristics with 233y fuel and a
memorandum summarizing the changes was issued. As an aid in review of all
systems, a 74-page programmed instruction manual was prepared. Prior to
startup with 233y, a comprehensive review test was given to all operators,
The distribution of grades on this test is shown in Fig. 1l1. The results
of the tests were discussed with each operator and each was required to do

more studying of subjects in which they appeared weak.

Other Training

From the standpoint of keeping in practice, it would have been bene-
ficial if each operator could have filled and started up the reactor, shut
down and drained the reactor, and done all other operations periodically.
However, with the MSRE, which was on line most of the time, this was not
possible. The various job categories were rotated among the operators to
help distribute the experience and, whenever there was opportunity, each
operator was required to take the reactor critical and subcritical and to
raise and lower the power as well as ﬁost of the other routine operations.
Occasionally in slack periods, problems were assigned for each crew or each
individual to solve. Typically these involved radiation and health physics,
reactivity changes and other topics that were important but were seldom en-
countered in routine operation. Information regarding changes in plans or
equipment were usually communicated to operating personnel by means of
Shift Instructions and changes in the Operating Procedures. (See Chapter
8.) Each Shift Supervisor or Chief Operator was responsible for assuring
that all persons on his shift were familiar with all changes and that they

remained adequately trained to run the reactor.

Training of Replacements

During the five years of reactor operation, 3 engineers and 5 tech-
nicians were assigned to the MSRE for training and use as operators. Their
training was on a person-to-person basis, with instruction by members of
the MSRE staff. The program outlines which were followed for group train-
ing were used as guides. Considerable time was provided for self-study of
the various sections of the MSRE Design and Operations Report, semiannual
reports, flow sheets, control circuits, etc. When training was complete,
each of these operators was given the same series of tests and oral reviews
that had been used with the main group. The elapsed time between arrival
at the MSRE and final testing varied from 3 to 8 months depending upon need
for replacemént, availability of instructors, background of the individual,

and the extent of his other duties.

Equivalence to AEC Examination

In their annual safety review of the MSRE in September 1968, the USAEC-
ORO committee suggested that the MSRE operator examinations be reviewed to
assure equivalence with the requirements for non-AEC reactor operators (ref.
13). At their suggestion, an ORNL employee who administers tests for the
AEC's Division of Reactor Licensing reviewed one of the three major tests
that had been used at the MSRE. It was his opinion, based on this one test,
that the MSRE operator testing was adequate and equivalenﬁ. However, he
suggested that if other operators were to be certified, new tests should be
prepared conforming more directly to the AEC guidelines. A test was made
up using 10-~CFR~5>5, the AEC Licensing Guide,!l" and suggestions from the
examiner. This test, designated "™SRE Operator's Examination — May 1969,"
is given in Appendix I. One engineer, who was in training at the time, was
given the MSRE Precritical, Prepower, and Pre-233y examinations, and then
took the May 1969 examination and an oral operational test before certifi-
cation. Twelve hours were allocated for taking the operator's sections
(A-~G) of the May 1969 examination and 9-1/2 hours for taking the shift
supervisor's section (H-L). He passed all tests, but certification was
based, as with past operators, on the more inclusive MSRE tests, informal

review, and oral questioning.
31

6. OPERATION OF THE REACTOR

Although the goal of the training program at the MSRE was to make all
operators capable of operating the reactor without instructions or proce-
dures if need be, the practice was to follow detailed written instructions
to the maximum practicable extent. The intelligence, interest, and capa-
bility of the operators was recognized, however, and in all instructions
an attempt was made to give the reason for as well as the details of the
required actions. In return, it was each operator's duty to provide feed-
back. For example, he was expected to provide an explanation, if known,
for all log notations which were not self-explanatory and for any devia-
tions from normal or expected events. Suggestions, including unproved but

credible theories to explain observed events, were encouraged.

Planning

Operation of the MSRE followed a published test program,l®,16 and the
objectives of each run were worked out in advance among the engineers, chem-
ists, physicists and directors of the Molten~Salt Reactor Program. Most of
the day-to-day, detailed planning was done in planning meetings held at the
reactor site. Originally held each day, these meetings later came to be
held at intervals of 1 to 3 times per week, depending upon the need. All
technical personnel on duty at the reactor plus representatives of sup-
porting groups attended these meetings. (The MSR Program Director was usu-
ally present also.) A member of the operations group (usually the Assist-
ant Operations Chief) began the meeting by reporting on the previous peri-
od's activities. Others added to this any other pertinent events, analyses
made, maintenance status, etc. Tentative plans were then presented and
discussed. Often a smaller group remained to work out details or to dis~
cuss problem areas. In cases where there was uncertainty or conflicts (be-
tween experimenters, or between maintenance and operation, for example) the
MSRE Department Head usually made the final decision. The meetings started
at 11:00 a.m., which allowed ample time before to digest most of the previ-

ous period's work and sufficient time afterward to prepare detailed shift
32

instructions, obtain materials needed and make the necessary plans to carry

out the program for the following period before the end of the day shift.

Instructions to and Communications with Operators

Shift Instructions were prepared each weekday by a member of the ope-
rating group (usually the Assistant Operations Chief or the Operations
Chief). These were based mainly on decisions reached in the planning meet-
ings. A general information section outlined the plans and provided other
information of interest to the shift personnel. The instructions sometimes
were very specific, such as a detailed check list; at other times they re-
ferred to a separate procedure such as a section of the Operating Proce-
dures!! or a test memo. If the instructions were to be followed for longer
periods, instead of being repeated each day in subsequent shift instructions,
they were usually put in the Permanent Shift Instructions. The Permanent
Shift Instructions were reviewed periodically and appropriate sections were
incorporated into the Operating Procedures, The shift instructions could
override the operating procedures or test memos. If difficulties prevented
following the prescribed program, the Chief Operator, Shift Supervisor, As-
sistant Operations Chief, Operations Chief, and/or Operations Department
Head decided what alternatives to follow. Typical examples of Shift In-
structions, Operating Procedures, and Test Memos are given in Appendix J,

A master up~to-date copy of the Operating Procedures was maintained
in the operations office. To avoid confusion, changes in this master copy
were entered only by the Operations Chief or Assistant Operations Chief.

All personnel were required to be familiar with these changes and records
were maintained indicating this. The master copy or a copy corrected to
agree with the master was used for all operations. Control-room log and
building log forms were a part of the Operating Procedures. Current limits
were indicated on these for each variable as well as the frequency for re-
cording variables. The first few pages of the control-room and building
log forms are shown in Appendix K. Before starting a log (or check list)
the operator was required to correct his copy of the form to agree with

the master. If variables were found out of limits, they were corrected

or reported to the Shift Supervisor or Chief Operator. He decided on the
33

course of action to be taken either independently or after contacting ap-
propriate day personnel. During transient conditions, such as at shutdown
or startup, when the appropriate log limits were changing rapidly, shift
personnel were expected to decide on what limits were proper and what equip-
ment should be operating at the time.

Test Memos were detailed procedures which were written for more in-
volved speclal tests. These required the approval of the MSRE Operations
Department Head, the Operations Chief, and others as designated by the Ope-
rations Department Head.

There was, of course, an oral exchange of information and instructions
at shift change between the crew leaving and the one taking over.* Every-
one was required to read the shift instructions and console log as soon as

possible after reporting for duty.

Data Taking and Record Keeping

One of the primary records of the MSRE operation was the Console Log,
which was essentially a chronological narrative of events. The time was
recorded at the start of each entry and the initials of the person making
the entry were put at the end. A status and summary entry was made at the
end of each shift. Practically all operations events were noted, but only
the most important maintenance items. (Other maintenance was reported on
the completed work requests or by memos.) Copies were made of the console
log sheets and distributed daily to interested personnel. The originals
(in bound books) were kept in the operations files at the site.

As mentioned previously, almost all variables were recorded on the
building log or controel room log forms. These were arranged by areas to

facilitate recording of data. Completed copies of these were filed in the

 

*
Crew members were required to be at the control room, ready for duty,
6 minutes before the nominal shift change. (They received 0.1 hour overtime
pay for this.)
34

operations files along with completed check lists, operating procedures,
and test memos. Recorder charts were marked at least once each shift and
were removed and filed daily.

The bulk of the data were logged by an on~line digital computer
(Bunker-Ramo Model 340),l7 which monitored all of the important variables
and recorded these on magnetic tape every 5 minutes. In addition, it typed
out an hourly log, an 8-hour log, and a daily report. 1In case a variable
went out of limits, an annunciation occurred and the value of the variable
was typed out by a typewriter located in the main control room. When any
of certain important variables went out of limits, it initiated a fast scan
which increased the frequency of recording of a selected group of variables
to 4 times per second. A fast scan could also be initiated by the operator.
Variables could be trend-logged or plotted if desired. Data typed out by
the computer was removed and filed each day. Magnetic tapes were removed
daily and then transferred to record tapes which held several days' data.

These were filed at the reactor site.

7. APPROVAL OF MAINTENANCE AND DESIGN CHANGES

The forms used in connection with maintenance and design changes are
included in Appendix L. Anyone knowing the need of maintenance could initi-
ate action by filling out a Punch List form. If the job was small, the
work was completed without any additional paper work. No formal record
was kept of work done in this manner. If the job was more involved, a Work
Request was issued. This had to be approved by the Operations Chief or
Assistant Operations Chief. 1In either case the Shift Supervisor's approval
was necessary before work was started. He was responsible for making neces-
sary changes in the system and tagging out necessary valves or switches to
assure safety of the reactor and personnel. After maintenance waswcomplete,
he checked out the job before removing the tags and putting the equipment
back in service. The completed work requests were retained as a record of
what was done.

Proposed modifications which could produce significantly different

characteristics or functions in any component or system (such as piping,
35

instrumentation, switch settings, etc.) were initiated using a "Change
Request' form. The MSRE Operations Department head reviewed all change

requests and determined what other reviews were necessary.
8. INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO OPERATORS

Documents are listed in this section which were useful in the training
of operators or were used by them in the operation of the MSRE. A brief
description of their content and how they were used is given where appli-
cable. The approximate date of issuance is also given when this is thought
to have been pertinent to the training program or operation of the reactor.

Design and Operations Report

The need for documentation of reactor design and preparations for ope-
rations, was recognized very early by the MSR Program Director, who issued
a memorandum in July, 1962 assigning responsibilities for writing parts of
a Design and Operations Report. Table 3 lists the subjects and the dates
when the wvarious parts were eventually published.

Part T -'Design” described the mechanical and electrical portions of
the reactor. Flowsheets, electrical one-line drawings and equipment details
were given. Bases for design or design calculations were not included. A
rough draft of Part I was available for the initial operator training and
proved to be very helpful. The report was issed at the time of the zero-
power experiments and although it was not kept up to date, it was neverthe-
less referred to frequently during subsequent operation.

Parts IT-A and II-B — Nuclear and Process Instrumentation!®;1° de-
scribe the instrumentation layout, individual instruments or systems, con-
trol circuitry and other details. Unfortunately, these were not available
for use in training and it was necessary for the instructors to search
through drawings and unpublished information to prepare for the training
sessions. The students had to take very good notes and had to search for
information if needed later. Section II-A was used for reference after its

publication near the end of 2335y operation. Section II-B was not published

until after the conclusion of MSRE operation.

Part IITI — Nuclear Analysi520 described the predicted nuclear charac-
teristics, rod worth, coefficients of reactivity, poisoning effects of fis=-
sion products, kinetics of operation and adequacy of biological shielding.
It was the first part published and was available for all of the training
periods. Although it was not kept up to date, it was used occasionally for
reference during operation.

Part IV — Chemistry and Materials was expected to include in a form
convenient for the operators: (a) a summary of salt chemistry (phase dia-
grams, effects of moisture, oxygen, etc.), (b) a description of the chemis-
try of water systems (acceptable limits, suggested analysis, and effect of
activation), (c¢) a listing of the properties of lubricating oil for the cir-
culating pumps (analysis required, acceptable limits, etc.), (d) informa-
tion on the metallurgy of INOR-8 and stainless steel, (e) a discussion of
graphite, (f) explanation for keeping the oxygen and water content of helium
cover gas low, and (g) a discussion of fission products. This part of the
Design and Operations Report was never prepared.

Part V — Safety Analysis?l! described some of the more important sys-
tems, controls, and instrumentation. Plant layout, site features, con-
struction, startup and operating plans were covered. Various possible ac-
cidents were discussed and the consequences delineated. This was available
for most of the training and was extremely valuable. The operations copy
was updated periodically and used regularly during operation. Prior to
operation with 233y fuel, another safety analysis report22 was published,
which provided a basis for operator training and was a useful reference.

Part VI — QOperating Safety Limits2326 tabulated the absolute limits
within which the reactor had tobe operated. This was available before
criticality and was used for instruction. Three revisions were issued.,

Part VII — Fuel Handling and Processing Plant covered all aspects of
the fuel processing plant, (design, hazard analysis, operating procedures,
etc.) and was useful in training operators and for running the chemical
processing plant. The original version?? was issued at the time of the
hydrofluorination of the flush salt in 1965 and a substantially revised

version’ was issued in preparation for the processing in 1968.
Part VIIT — Operating Procedures!! provided most of the information

necessary for operation. A simplified description of basic nuclear facts
38

and nuclear characteristics of the MSRE was given. Methods of startup,
operation, and shutdown of all systems were covered with detailed check
lists. Special and unusual operations were described and attempts were
made to anticipate any troubles which might have developed and suggest cor-
rective action. For instance, each annunciétor was listed. Things which
could cause the annunciation, control actions which would occur and sug-
gested operator actions were tabulated. Data sheets, logs, and check lists
were included and the methods.of taking data and its storage was covered in
detail. The methods used for getting maintenance done safely and for making
modifications to the system or approved documents was described. A rough
draft of this was available for the initial training. This report was is-
sued in a bound edition (two volumes) to the recipients who did not desire
or need to be notified of changes. Others, inciuding all operators, were
issued loose-leaf editions and they were sent copies of revised sections

as they appeared. The master copy was updated as changes occurred.

Part IX — Safety Procedures and Emergency Plans?8 provided procedures
and background information to assist personnel in anticipating, preventing,
and handling emergencies such as fires, release of beryllium, or increases
in radiocactivity, This procedure was availlable before criticality and was
used for training operators. Operators' copies were updated periodically
but a formal revision was not issued.

Part X — Maintenance Equipment and Procedures?? gave general proced-
ures for doing remote maintenance. The reactor operators were not normally
involved in maintenance except to prepare the system and assure that ade-
quate safety precautions were followed.

Part XI — Test Programl5 described the program for the shakedown of
equipment, approach to criticality, and power operation. Various special
tests and experiments were described. Details of experiments were not
given in the report itself, but test memos, numbered to correspond to the
sections in the test report, did give details. These were written and ap-
proved before the experiment or test was started. Operation with 233y
fuel was conceived and planned after the original program was underway and

a separate document!® was issued to outline this phase of the program.
39

Part XII — Lists was to give a ready reference or index to all reports,
drawings, and other information. Such things as a cross reference index to
drawings were to be included. It would have been very valuable during de-

sign, construction, and all stages of operation, but it was never prepared.

Other Reports

Progress reports of the Molten Salt Reactor Program were issued semi-
annually. Informal reports'covering progress in most areas of the program
were also issued monthly. Copies of these, as well as topical reports on
molten—-salt work done at the reactor or elsewhere, were maintained at the
site. Copies of other pertinent reports such as ORNL and Reactor Division
Safety Procedures, Health Physics Procedures and ORNL Standard Practice
Procedures were also available. A Daily Report was issued covering all
known events of importance at the MSRE and a tabulation of important items
such as number of hours critical, total power produced, operating condi-

tions, etc. (See Appendix M.)

Drawings

A stick file was maintained with the latest revisions of flowsheets,
instrument application drawings, block diagrams, control circuit schema-
tics, annunciator schematics, heater schematics, heater and thermocouple
location drawings, electrical on-line drawings, and a few layout drawings.
These were updated whenever a change was made in the system. The trans-
parencies were revised periodically and new revisions put on the stick
file. Microfilm negatives of these drawings and all other MSRE drawings
were maintained at the site. A reader-copier was available for quick view-

ing or obtaining copies of any drawing.
Miscellaneous

(1) Calibration curves and other operational information on equip-
ment or systems was maintained in a loose~leaf notebook in the operations

office. These were updated as new information was accumulated.
40

(2) Copies of manufacturers' bulletins and instructions for all
equipment were maintained in the maintenance office.

(3) Switch tabulations giving the setpoints of all switches were kept
up to date.

(4) Two thermocouple tabulation books were maintained which gave the
readout location of each thermocouple. One was indexed according to thermo-
couple number and the other according to readout instrument number. Ac-
curate records on this were necessary because there were approximately 1000
thermocouples which were routed through a patch panel to the readout devices.

(5) The latest copies of the instrument tabulations, instrument speci-
fications, line schedules, and design data sheets were available.

(6) Up-to-date information regarding the computer including the "‘Com-
puter Manual for MSRE Operators”30 was kept in the computer room located
next to the main control room.,

(7) The main control board was a graphic panel and was very helpful
to the operators. Most of the control circuits were depicted graphically
on a jumper board. Indicator lights provided the operator with information
on each contact in the control circuits. Plug-type jumpers could be used
to bypass some of the interlocks. The jumper board reduced the need for
behind~the-board jumpers. All jumpers at the MSRE were used only under

strict administrative control.

9. RECOMMENDATIONS

The following recommendations are based on the author's experience
gained during operator training, startup and operation of the MSRE. The
intent is not simply to criticize the way things were done at the MSRE but
to try to share recommended techniques with other operators and to point
out possible pitfalls. In general, only those items which directly af-
fected training, preparation for operation, or actual operation are in-
cluded.

A. The MSRE Design and Operations Report was intended to cover all
phases of the reactor and to avoid duplication as much as possible. There-
fore the Operating Procedures, Part VIII, did not cover descriptions of the
systems, equipment, or instrumentation. To learn what was needed for ope-

ration, the operators had to read through much information which was not
41

pertinent to operation. All other parts of the Design and Operations Re-
port should have been abstracted and the information needed for operation
should have been repeated in the Operating Procedures or in a Training
Manual.

B. A special set of drawings needs to be made for use by operators.
Since these would be repeatedly referred to, more than normal effort should
be spent in proper layout, cross-referencing, etc. Most of these need to
be reduced to 1ll- x 17-in. size as were the flow sheets at the MSRE. Some
specific examples are given below.

(1) TFlow sheets should be similar to those issued for the MSRE.
They should include line numbers and names, equipment num-—
bers and names, simplified instrument numbers, locations of
lines and equipment, direction of flow, normal flow rates,
normal temperatures, normal pressures, relative elevations

when important, and normal and fail position of valves.

To avoid unnecessary confusion, most data on components,
cross~references, and approval signatures could be on a
separate sheet rather than on the drawings. Such things
as line sizes, the number of thermocouples or heaters on a
line or equipment, flanges and leak detectors, etc., would

not need to be included.

Considerable effort should be taken to include all items

needed in routine operation but to make these as simple as

possible,

The MSRE flowsheets were made so that lines extending be-
yond the edge of one drawing matched the next drawing. In
other words it was possible to fasten the flowsheets to-
gether and end up with a large drawing of the entire plant.

This is desirable as it facilitates tracing lines.

(2) Although flowsheets, as described above, supplied most of
the day-to-day needs of the operators, there was often a
need to know more detailed flowsheet type information.

Drawings showing this should be made using the simplified
(3)

(4)

(5)

42

flowsheets as a starting point so that the orientation on
the drawings is the same. Details of instrumentation loops,
like given on the instrument application diagrams, should be
added along with any instrument valving and valve numbers.
Control and annunciator circuit numbers should be given from
all sensing elements as well as to all valves and equipment
such as pumps. Line sizes and flanges should be shown along
with the flange leak detector lines. Approximate location
of thermocouples should be indicated. These drawings would
be the starting point for most trouble-shooting.

Four types of control circuit drawings were provided for the
MSRE. Examples of the three used most by operating personnel
are shown in Fig. 12. No one type was entirely satisfactory.
The block diagrams were probably the easiest to use when
learning the circuits but they were not sufficient for ope-
rating the reactor since they did not readily show all the
control actions that occur, the switches that initiate the
action, relay numbers, jumper board lights, etc. The engi-
neering elementaries supplied most of the information neces-
sary but were difficult to use. The jumper board drawings
lacked detail and cross-referencing. These three if com-
bined as shown in Fig. 13 should be much more useful to the
reactor operators. Switch setpoints should not be shown
but should be tabulated similar to the MSRE Switch Tabula-
tion3! with provisions for keeping a master copy up to date.
Simplified electrical distribution drawings were needed
showing all switches, bfeakers, indicators, recorders, etc.
Control power for the breakers should be shown. Control
circuits and switch tabulation similar to that described
above would be helpful.

Combination heater and thermocouple drawings as used at the
MSRE were very helpful. These showed the approximate loca-
tion of the heaters and the thermocouples. Isometric draw-

ings could have been used to advantage in some places.

C. Early in construction certain drawings and documents such as
flowsheets and most sections of the Design and Operations Report should
be assigned to personnel who are responsible for keeping these up to date.
Most of this should probably be assigned to future operating personnel.

D. During preparation for operations, a table was made listing all
known variables in alpha-numerical order. Columns were provided for indi-
cating the readout instrument number and location, the function of the
variable, the normal value, the alarm and control setpoints and proposed
logging frequency. Members of the design and development groups were con-
tacted to determine recommended initial conditions. This provided a very
good starting point for making up the various logs and aided in writing
operating procedures. Design and development personnel should be responsi-
ble for advising operations of any recommended additions or changes in
these.

E. Flowsheets and circuit elementary drawings should always precede
piping and wiring drawings. These should be approved by operations person-
nel. Operations personnel should follow construction or construction per-
sonnel should be thoroughly familiar with operating criteria. All lines,
valves, wires, and equipment should be labeled as they are installed.

F. During design of the MSRE, it was thought that extreme flexi-
bility would be needed for thermocouples and their readout instruments.
During operation it was obvious that the flexibility provided by the patch
panel was not necessary for a good part of the thermocouples. To keep
track of the over 1000 thermocouples at the MSRE presented a difficult prob-
lem but the system of two log books described earlier adequately solved the
problem.

G. The operating crew should be at the site long before the cells
are closed so that they can become familiar with the physical layout. A
model of in-cell equipment is valuable for operation and maintenance.

H. The desire of non-operating personnel to know the status of the
reactor often led to confusion in the control room especially at the start
of the work day. This was alleviated by posting a short report on the
control-room window giving the major happenings for the last 24 hours, the
important problems encountered and the present plans. Copies were also

made of the console log sheets each morning and placed in convenient locations.
46

I. The use of simulators for operator training was found to be very
useful. The value of this was enhanced by having the operator sit at the
reactor console, use the actual control switches, and refer to the regular
reactor instrumentation. Perhaps additional training could be done by
simulating failure of some of the control and/or safety instrumentation.

By running tests where the system is maloperated, the simulator would very
dramatically illustrate the consequences. |

J. Often it is difficult for the shift supervisor to find time to
thoroughly review the building log. To aid in this, a cover sheet was pro-
vided. The person taking the log listed items out of limits or items re-
quiring attention. (See Appendix K.)

K. Limiting the number of people who are authorized to change ope-
rating procedures is recommended. Keeping everyone informed of the changes
was cumbersome. These were entered in an operating procedures change book
and at first it was the responsibility of the shift supervisor to keep all
operators on his shift informed. Vacations and other leave made it diffi-
cult to be sure that all had been notified. Places were then provided in
the Operating Procedures Change Book for each operator to sign when he had
read and understood the change. This worked fine except that often there
was too much lag time. In reviewing the difficulty, it.was decided that
many of the changes were on check lists or for some other reason did not
need to be known by everyone. Therefore, only important changes were en-
tered in the Operating Procedure Change Book. Reading of these was strict-
ly enforced.

L. Graphic panels showing important flowsheets with valve position
and equipment status and jumper boards showing important control circuits
and their status were very helpful to the operators.

M. The tagging system used at the MSRE worked very well. All wvalves
. and switches, which if inadvertently operated could cause harm to personnel
or to the reactor, were tagged. The tags used are shown in Fig. 1l4. The
valves or switches were not operated without removing the tag which required
the approval of the shift supervisor on duty. Most of these were attached
as specified in the startup check lists. 1In general, we did not tag valves

or switches which were operated regularly.

"Do Not Operate'' tags were used for tagging out valves and switches
for maintenance and special procedures. As indicated in Fig. 15, space
was provided on these for additional information. The white paper was re-
moved and attached to the maintenance work order or special procedure.
This aided in assuring that all tags were removed when the work was com-
plete. In general, the requirement to remove the tag was to have the shift
supervisor's permission. It was his responsibility to see that the work
was complete and that it was safe to operate the switch or valve.

N. The system used in selecting instrument, heater, and valve num-
bers at the MSRE was an aid to training and operation. Each system was
assigned a series of numbers (i.e., fuel system is 100 to 200). Any valves
in the line, instruments attached to the line or heaters installed on it
were numbered accordingly. (i.e., HV-522A was a hand valve in Line 522,
PS~-575C was a pressure switch attached to line 575, H-101-2 was a heater
on line 101, and TE-103~1 was a thermocouple on line 103.)

0. The training instructors were engineers and scientists who, in
most cases, were very familiar with their subject. However, some did not
understand the needs and the limitations of the operators and most had no
experience as teachers. It would be better if a few skilled instructors
were used, with the experts present to answer questions that the instructor
could not handle, These Instructors should be given some prior training
on such things as theory of learning, lesson planning, and methods of
presentation,

P. A training manual should be written. This would have been help-
ful in the early training and would have saved considerable time in train-
ing replacements. This manual should be updated as changes are made.

Since much of the nuclear, health physics, and general engineering
training needed is common to most reactors, avallable informatlon such as
the programmed instruction manuals published by the ORNL Operations Di-
vision32,33,3%,35,36 ghould be put to use. However, this should be care-
fully reviewed and the appropriate sections made a part of the training
manual for the particular reactor. The reactor design, instruments in-
stalled, and methods of operation should be covered from the operator's
viewpoint, To aid in learning and in handling emergencies and unusual oc-

currences, the reason for the various features should be stressed.

Instructions should be included for manipulative training and for
aiding the trainee in becoming familiar with the physical layout. Photo-
graphs of operating areas would be helpful.

Detailed outlines of tours and oral instruction should be provided.
Operating techniques such as changing chart paper, log-taking, etc.,
should be included.

The manual should be designed for the least educated operator and
should advance this person to the étage needed to operate the reactor.
Additional sections should be provided for the supervisors including the
art of supervision.

This manual would probably be more valuable if put into the form of
programmed instruction. Review tests should be included at the end of

each section.

Using a copy of all flowsheets and all instrument application drawings

needed for the system being checked, proceed as follows:

1.

2.

3.

4.

NOTE:
(a)
(b)
(c)

(d)
(e)
(£)

Trace all lines and equipment including instrumentation at least
to the primary sensing element.

Mark flowsheets and instrument application drawings with yellow
pencil as lines are traced. Do not miss anything.

Change flowsheets and instrument application drawings to agree
with the actual installation. Use green pencil for deletions
and red pencil for additions,
Tag all lines, instruments and equipment at locations where perma-
nent tags are needed. (Use round tags and green pencil. Tags
should be exactly like desired permanent label. Line numbers
should not be preceded by any symbol. Hand valves should be
labeled V-501, V-944, etc. Control valves should be HCV-516,
PCV-522, etc, Instruments should be PI-500, FI-933, etc.)
Some special things to look for are given below:
Location of tees, sample valves and capped lines.

Double lines and containment extensions.

Instrument valves not shown or numbered, hand valves and
check wvalves.

Leak detector lines.
Areas where items are located.

Be on the lookout for any faulty construction, or errors in
design or construction which might cause mal~operation.
58

Second Phase

Using a copy of the small size flowsheets:

1. Trace out lines under the direction of the "system flowsheet
experts."

2. When completed, return to conference room for self-study until

the other group has returned. Then continue to next flowsheet
checkout.

NOTE: It will not be necessary to trace every line to check for tees,
sample valves, etc., however, each person should be familiar
with each system when the checkout is finished.

Appendix D
PRECRITICAL EXAMINATIONS

In April, 1965, six weeks before the beginning of nuclear operation,
written examinations were administered to all MSRE operators. This ap-
pendix reproduces the instructions and the schedule issued just prior to
the examinations. Some representative questions and problems are also

included. (The complete examination covered 43 pages.)
Instructions

This examination is to be given in five periods plus one extra period
for the engineers. Various type questions are asked throughout. True-
false questions are worth one point (+1) if right, zero (0) points if not
answered and minus one (—1) if answered wrong. All other types have dif-
ferent values as noted to the left of each question number. A summary of
the exams and time allocated for each period is given in the attached
table.

It should be noted that the value of the question or the number of
blank lines left for answers does not necessarily indicate how many correct
answers there are. For instance if there are 3 things which turn off the
control-room air conditioner and 5 lines are left, the question may still
be worth 1 or 2 points.

There are some questions which are marked extra credit. Skip these
until all other questions are answered. Then if time permits go back and
complete these. It is more desirable to answer the required questions right
than to answer the optional ones.

Be sure to read all instructions throughout the test.

In general, it is felt that the meaning of each question is clear. Put
down the best answer that you know, based on your understanding of it. Do
not ask for assistance. If you feel it is necessary to explain your answer,
do so. Credit will be given if a question is not clear, however, no credit
will be given if it appears that the question was clear and the intent was
changed by your explanation even though your answer to your explanation is

correct, i,e., you cannot make up your own questions.
64

When finished be sure your name and date are on the first sheet and
your initials are on the bottom of each sheet. Do all calculations, ex-
planations etc. in the margin or on the back of the examihation sheets.
Turn in your papers promptly when requested. The next test period will
start promptly at the time indicated in the tables. If you are late,

you will not have as much time for that test period.

GENERAL TINFORMATION

I

It seems that whatever is causing bubbles in the fuel system remains
with us. Note that WR~-2947 has raised OFT level alarm and action set-
points to 30 and 35%. We will operate the FP between 50 and 59% level
on the No. 1 bubbler (switch position No. 2). These new limits are
marked in the control room log. The lowering of FP level is for two
reasons — the most important being to keep the foam away from the off-
gas connection. The other being to lengthen the time interval between
OFT burps.

The most important disadvantage of the above changes comes when
we have a FP stoppage for some reason. The resulting FP level will be
much lower than necessary to restart the pump. The OFT must then be
partially emptied to get the FP level to ¢64%. With the FP on and
&8% worth of bubbles circulating, the FP level is out of limits (i.e.,
>59%). Care must be taken to avoid reheating the system too rapidly
and causing level to increase even more. The recovery could take

several shifts. See instructions in Permanent Shift Instructiomns.

December 13, 1968

In the event an FP stoppage (and scram if at power) requires transfer

of salt from the OFT to restart, follow the general plan below.

1,
2,

Transfer only enough salt from the OFT to restart the FP per 9I.

While awaiting transfer, begin turning up system heaters (if load and
rod scram has occurred). Bring up to normal temperature.

Restart the FP and bring the reactor critical to 1 kW per 5J.

Add nuclear heat up to 100 kW as necessary along with electrical heat
to maintain FP level at 65% until system temperature reaches 1210°F,
This may take several shifts. At this time you can return to power or

whatever condition called for in shift instructions.

5J CRITICALITY AND POWER OPERATION

The fuel and coolant salt will be circulated subcritically in the
loops until power operation is desired, at which time the control rods
will be withdrawn to obtain criticality.

During normal power operation, manual load control and servo rod
control will be used. However, manual rod control may be used if neces-
sary. Automatic load control will be used only for special tests for
which detailed instructions will be supplied.

The first section is written for use as a "Quickie" check list for
recovery of temperatures after a rod and load scram. After recovery is
made, the reactor will be taken subcritical and the normal pre-power
operation checks of Section 2 completed.

Any time the power is reduced below ~ 200 kw, the entire preparation
(Section 2) check should be completed.

This procedure is corganized as follows,

1. Quick recovery of temperature check list.
2. Preparation for power operation.

3. Starting power operaticn using rod servo,

3 STARTING POWER OPERATION USING ROD SERVO

The shim rods will be withdrawn manually while the servc con-

troller manipulates the regulating rod to attain criticality and controls

the power at the setpoint.

To increase the nuclear power, the flux demand will be increased.

This may cause the regulating rod to withdraw until the regulating-rod

1limit is reached. The limit can be changed by operating the regulating-rod

drive switch or the shim rods can be manmually withdrawn which will
cause the regulating rod to insert.

As the flux demand is increased, the nuclear power may cause the
system temperatures to rise necessitating removal of heat at the
radiator., Number one blower will be started and the resultant AP
across the radiator will cause the bypass damper to open if damper
controcl is on automatic.

Before pushing the run button, the power should be between 0.5

and 1 Mw; both range selectors should be in the 1.5-Mw range, and
the temperature demand setpoint should be slightly higher than the
outlet temperature. The regulating rod should be in the center
portion of its useful range and not at either the insert or withdraw
1imit. When the reactor is switched to the "run" mode, the range
selector will be sealed in the 15-Mw range, and the rod-control
circuitry will be changed frum flux servo to temperature servo.
Under these conditions, the regulating rod will be automatically in-
serted or withdrawn to maintain the reactor-outlet tempersture con-
stant. The temperature can be changed by adjusting the temperature-
demand setpoint.

Operation at full power will be reached with both doors open,
both blowers in operation and the bypass damper closed. If the regu-
lating rod reaches the withdraw limit, No., 2 and No. 3 rod will have
to be manually withdrawn or the limit will have to be raised. When
critical, Rod 2 and 2 should always be withdrawn the same amount
(within % inch of each other). Rod 1 should be kept at least L inches
below Rod 2 and 3 and within the range of 8 inches and 39 inches
withdrawn,

Transient Flowrate Measurements

Submitteﬂwﬁtwmwved Progeltirfos
Submittedd /. &,A ;bszﬂﬂpproved

Approved for use -

 

Introduction
Measurements will be made to determine the fuel and coolant salt flow
rates during startup and coastdown of the circulating pumps. The transient
behavior of the fuel void fractions as indicated by the gamma-ray densito-
meter will also be measured.
Purpose
Information on the transient salt flow rates and void fractions during
pump startup and coastdown will be used to interpret results of the tests
of flow on reactivity (see MSRE Test Memo 3.2.4.5).
Description
These tests will be run with the reactor subcritical and essentially
at thermal equilibrium. For the coolant loop tests, salt flow rate and
pump speed will be monitored, and for the primary loop tests, pump speed
and fuel density (from the gamma-ray densitometer) will be monitored.
Special Equipment and Preparations
Since the pump startup time is quite short, a multichannel oscillograph
recorder will be used to monitor the outputs of the coolant salt venturi
differential pressure cells directly, and both primary and coolant pump speed.
The data logger will be used in the continuous fast scan mode to also record
coolant flow rate, pump speeds, and fuel density, as well as certalin loop
temperatures for reference.
Procedures
1. Set input power to loop heaters so that a constant temperature
(nominally 1200°F) is maintained with both circulating pumps
running.
2. Jumper the control interlock so that the fuel pump may operate with
the coolant pump off.
118

Put the logger in the continuous fast scan mode, and monitor
coolant flow and pump speed on the oscillograph.

Shut off the cooclant pump.

After the flow transient has died out, restart the coolant pump.
Monitor primary pump speed on the oscillograph (also densitometer
signal if possible). Put logger in fast scan mode.

Shut off the fuel pump.

Restart fuel pump after flow trangient (i.e. pump speed and
densitometer signals) has settled out.

Repeat 7 and 8 after waiting various intervals between starts

to see if there is any burping effect detected on the densitometer.

scan sequence input 57 (replacing LT-599(OFT)).

 

Connect outputs of the coolant salt venturis'
d/p cells and cooclant circulated pump speed

transmitters to a multi-channel oscillograph.

 

Set input power to loop heaters so that a
constant tempersture (nominally 1200°F)
is maintained with both circulating pumps

running. (reactor sub-critical)

 

Put the data logger in the continuous

fast scan mode and start oscillograph.

o
0800 3/25/68

The power operation of the reacztor for Run No. 1l was discontinued
at 0100, 3/25/68, by a rod and load scram as planned., After 8 minutes of
subcritical operation, the reactor was returned to reduced power operation
to recover the temperature lost during the scram transient, The power was
then reduced to 10 kw and is continuing at that level and at 1210°F.

Dynamics tests were completed at full power and at 2.5 Mw. The tests
at 2.5 Mw were run because the ternary sequence used in the previous tests
had not been correct. The power was reduced to 2.5 Mw for about 3 hours for
these tests; otherwise the reactor ran at full power until the scheduled
power reduction this morning. There was difficulty in returning to temperature
servo after the dynamics tests, The trouble, which was found to be faulty
contacts on Relay KA-1T70B, was corrected.

Testing continued on the offgas sampler thermal conductivity cells to
determine the effect of the flow rate through the absorber bed. The results
were too erratic to form any conclusions.

MG-3 was found running but off-line three times with no apparent
reason, Normal operation was restored each time without difficulty.

There were two computer outages during the weekend but the computer
was restarted after about 1/2 hour in both cases.

The equipment to be used in gamma scanning the heat exchanger arter
the shutdown was calibrated on a mockup of the heat exchanger and a 50-curie
i927nsource. The gamme scen is to be done with a Ge(Ii) diode to determine
the concentrations of the various fission products that are deposited on <The

heat exchanger tubes.
