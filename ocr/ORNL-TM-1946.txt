 REVIEW OF MOLTEN SALT REACTOR PHYSICS CAICULATIONS
1. INTRODUCTION

" This review of the physics'Of'the-Molten“Salt'Breeder’Reactor vas
undertaken for the purpose of providing an independent check of as many '
aspects &s possible of the calculations already'made. We have not at-
tempted any further optimization. Instead we chose & design of the core
and blanket regions for which calculations had already been made, and

subjected this design to our analysis. Our primary interest was in the
tbreeding ratio of the equilibrium reactor. a

- The design we chose is essentially ‘the one presented as the refer-
ence case in ORNL-TM-lh67 (Ref. 1). It is a 1000 Mw(e) power ‘plant with
a single core, separate fissile end fertile streems, and without pro-
vision for rémoval of 33Pa from the fertile stream | et

The previous calculation for this design is known as Cese 555 in &
series of calculations by the OPTIMERC code.” Insofar as possible we

" attempted to specify the samé-gedmetry'and composition as case 555,

resisting suggestions that this cese 1is already obsolete, 50 ‘thet &
velid comparison could be made between the two calculations. For some
regions, particularly for the lower blanket and plenum, ‘the specifica- ‘
tions. for case 555 were’ not detailed enough for our calculations, or |
appeared to- leave out certain components.. To fill in’ these gaps we

7'-'obtained additional layout drawings and dimensions from the group work-
'“f.ing on the design of the molten salt reactors.2 o

Our review covered: six. principal areas: cross section selection,

j;sfission product treatment, multigroup cell calculations, two-dimensional
**freactor criticality calculations, equilibrium depletion calculations,'
Vg:fand start up depletion calculations. In each erea we attempted to choose
.:ifmethods ‘and’ data which were as independent as possible from those used -
'previously. However, in a number of instances we used the same methods
j-because alternate computer codes were not available, and for many nuclides
Cve used essentially the same cross section data because they seemed most

likely to be correct. =~
The cross‘sections selected.were mainly those that havetbeen'as--

sembled over & period of years for use in reactor ‘evaluation studies.
We reviewed carefully the situstion with regard to 233U whose Cross
sections always turn out to be the most important single factor in deter-
mining the neutron economy of thorium cycle reactors. ‘Weialso reviewed ,
the dats for several other nuclides which are important to the MSER.
These included Tea Ii, 6Li, Be, F, C, and Th. | | o

We reviewed the fission product chains and chose to treat 32 nuclides
explicitly in each of the fluid streams. The remainder of the fission
products which were lumped together as & single pseudo-element gave a
totel fractional absorption of 0 005 per neutron absorbed in fuel. .

) Our basic cross section set consists of the 68 energy group library
for the ‘M-GAM code, used to generate broad-group cross sections above_

‘ 1.86 ev, plus the 30_group_library for the THERMOS code,.from-which_the_. \

broad group cross sections below 1.86 ev‘are obtained. TheﬂMpGAM'cala
culetion gives a spectrum for the typical reactor cell and averages the
cross'sections over this cell. The heterogeneity'of the cell for neutron
energies_above 36 kev was taken intofaccount by & separate transport’cal-
culation of the flux distribution within the cell. Self~shielding end
heterogeneity effects in the resonances of 233Pa; 23 236U end Th were
computed in the M-GAM code by the Adler, Hinmen, and Nordheim.(narrow
resonance approximation) method. The THERMOS calculation gives en in-
tegral-transport solution to the group fluxes in & one-dimensionsl repre-
sentation of the cell, and averages the cross sections over the spectrum |
and over the cell. 1In the MPGANFTHERMOS calculations ve reduced the -
cross sections to a‘setrconsisting of;five fast groups and four thermal.
groups. We did one calculetion for the nuclides in & core cell end &
second”one for the-blanket_region.~ The_prerious-calculations.had elso
employed the M-GAM-THERMOS code but had incladed somenhat different ap-
proximations as to cell geometry, particularly with regard to the hetero-
geneity in the resonance absorption by the thorium._ . 3

7 we made & two-dimensional nine-group calculstion .of the entire
.reactor using the microscopic cross sections calculated by the M;GAM-
THERMGS code and the nuclide densities speclfied for the reference case..

This calculation was. done with the ASSAUDT code., - Considerable effort

was mede to represent realistically all of the blenket areas, structure,
- reflectors, and pressure vessel, as well as the core. The previous cel-
: culations made use, of ‘the MERC code which synthesizes the flux distri-
' bution from one-dimensional celculations in the radiel end exiel direc-

tions. After determining the_mulgiplication factor-for.the specifed
core ‘composition, we changed the .33U concentration'to obtein criticality.

VWith this calculation ve. could examine the neutron balance for the various

regions end the power distribution. e ,
B Using the reaction rates (one-grOup microscopic cross sections)
obtained in the ASSAULE code calculation we did an equilibrium point-r,

‘depletion calculation. . We used the LIM code, modified to do calculations
of separate fertile and fissile streams with transfer of bred fuel from .

the fertile to the fissile stream, to calculate processing loss end fuel

7, removal based on average concentrations, and to give specified cycle
~times. Fram the calculation vith this code ve obtained the equilibrium

cycle neutron balance and the equilibrium.breeding ratio._ The cycle
times for fissile and fertile streams, end the removal rates associated
with reprocessing vere taken from TMklh67 Previous calculations had

o used the MERC . code to obtain this equilibrium.neutron balance.

To check the assumption that the performance of the reactor can be
adequately represented by an eqnilibrium cycle, we. also. calculated the -

;heavy-element cnncentrations for e 30-year reactor history, starting with
- 93% *Pu -8 238 a5 the initial fuel naterial. Mo calculations of this
,;W'type had been done previously ' |

Summary of Results | R |
The mcstléignificant difference between the results oflour calcula-
tions and preVious ones was in the‘reeCtivity of the reference design;’
Using the reference composition we dbtained gk eff of 0.95. An additional
149 233U was required to achieve criticelity, holding ell other concen~-
tretions constent. The discrepancy in k_ ff is entirely traceeble to the
values used for thorium resonance integrel. We calculated the resonance
integral for the geometry of'the'reference_design and obtained 36.5 barns.
In the OPTIMERC caltulations'it hed been found'convenient to use the same
resonaence integral for all geometries being considered, the value assigned-
was 30 1 barns. | o o : '
" Our calculations agreed with the previous ones to within 0.01 in
breeding ratio a&s shown in Tables 2. 1 and 2.2. . waever, there were &
number of individusl differences of 0. OOl'to 0.005 in the neutron balance.'

 "ca1culeted with a. composition which gave & harder spectrum than the

_would have been if the reference composition had been used.' The total
1result for the 1. of 233U‘was an increase of 0. 002 in breeding ratio for

our calculations compared to the previous ones.

2;, The average M of 3SU‘vas 1.971 compared with 1. 958 in the o
previous calculations. "We believe that the new Cross sections are .f.
_ 1ikely to be better for this nuclide. The result was en increase in
, breeding ratio of 0. 00l. e o

3. we uséed a lowerrcross section for 23hU in accordance with the
-recommendations of the latest edition of BNLr325-- As & consequence,

more of the 23&U wes removed with the excess uranium, and there ‘were
fewer absorptions in,

235 : 236 237ﬂp ‘The net result appears
,to have been an increase in breeding retio of less than 0. 001.

| b4, We did not include eny 238U‘production in: ‘our calculation |
‘since it did not seem appropriate. 'Any other trans-uranium isotopes

-beyond 37Np should not lead to a net loss since they could probably

be separated and sold if there were eny tendency for them to accumulete.' |

An increase in breeding ratio of 0.001 resulted. o L
5. Parasitic ebsorptions in cerrier salt (other than Ld) were L
' lower because of the increased.fissile loading in our calculation. An ,
 increese of 0.003 in breeding ratio occured.,1 | ‘ -

6. Parasitic ebsorptions in graphite vere lower for the same resson. |

An increase of 0.004 occured.

. 7. The previous calculations omitted the INOR tubes in the lower
blanket. Although there is & possibility of reducing the effect by
redesign, the current design gave 8 breeding ratio 1oss of 0. 005 to
absorptions in the INOR. . : : '

8. Our calculetions gave an increase in breeding ratio of 0 003
from,lower fission product sbsorption. About one-half of this difference
ceme from nuclides which were allowed to recycle in the GPTIMERC calcula-

_d-; tion although‘belonging to chemical groups which are actually thought b0
' ;Fbe removed in reprocessing. It may be that the previoiis calculations

vere Justified in introducing & measure of conservatism at this point.
:_The remainder of the difference is associated with the higher fissile
- inventory in our calculations. o ' .

. 9. The previous calculations ‘used & 7Li content in the makeup of -
99 997% together with a cost of $120 per kg.. In reviewing the basis forl

'f this choice we find that the‘published AEC price schedule is for 99 990% ,

_7Li at this"price.'l More'recently it has'been“concluded by those working
'on molten galt reactor design that it would be reasonable to assume that
99, 995% Li could be obtained in large qnantities at $120 per kg.a”*ws

have followed this latter assumption end used 99.995% 'Li in our calcu-
lations, leading to a decrease in breeding ratio of 0 OOQ In addition,
the previous calculations neglected the production of - 6Li in the core

~ from n,a:reactions‘in beryllium; This source of 6Li gave ‘an additional '
0.003 ‘decrease in breeding ratio. '

10. We obtained a 10% higher neutron production from the Be(n, 2n)
reaction then in the previous calculations.- ‘The difference ceme from-
our taking into account the heterogeneity of the cell in the high-energy

‘range. The effect on breeding ratio was an increase of about 0.001.

Although our calculations gave & net increase in breeding ratio of
elmost 0.0l ‘compared to the previous ones, it should be kept in mind
that this increase-in breeding ratio: was accompanied by ‘an increase in
fissile. inventory., Indeed, the. increase in breeding ratio is about what.
one would expect. frcm the change in fissile inventory alone, so that
other increases and: decreases have approximately canceleed. A.subsequent

' re-oytimization would probably lead to & somewhat lower breeding retio

‘and lower- inventory.; )

Teble 2.3 shows & comparison of the two sets of calculations with
resgpect to spacial- distribution of neutron absorptions., There 1is generally
gpod'agreement._ H0wever, the how values of leakage obtained in our calk

. The power distributions obtained in the two-dimensional ASSAULT
calculations agreed very closely with. those of the one-dimensional OPTIMERC

'{anlculations (Table 2. 1) with the exception of a slight increase near

lthe central control channel which vas not included in the OPTIMERC cal-.

o culations.

: When the reactor WaE started up on 235U fuel, sale of fuel started
| after four months because the inventory requirements are lese for 233U

"'than for 2350. The breeding retio was above unity after 18 months;, al-
o though some isotopes did not approach their equilibrium value for about

:;‘10 yeers.. The 30-year present-velued fuel cycle cost vas only 0.02 mills/
kuhr(e) higher than the equilibrium fuel cycle cost. The 30-year average
of the breeding ratio was 0.013 lower than the equilibrium value.

.Recommendations

The OPTIMERC calculations have clearly provided & valuable and
reasonably accurate assesment of: the design configuration for the molten |
- salt reactor. Eowever, based on the results of our independent calcula- N
tions, we believe that there ere several points on which & more precise
treatment of the physics would help future 0ptimization studies. These,,
points are listed below, roughly in the order of their importance. o

1. The OPTIMERC code should be. provided with a’ neens of varying
the thorium resonance cross sections es fertile stream concentretion |
and geometry are changed. It is not likely to prove sufficient to re-
calculate the fissile (or fertile) loading for criticality of the final '
| reference design since the optimization procedure is affected in & com-r~

fplex manner by gross changes in cross eections. | - . o
; thimization of the thicknesses of the axial and radial blankets
':should be rechecked using & calculational model that agrees with 8 two-_
-"dimensional ASSAULE calculation for & base case. - i

| 3. The 6Ld production from beryllium should be. included. Another
-look at the Ii concentration in ‘the makeup 11thium may be in- order,

'1,elthough this is admittedly an area in which high precision is not possible._

L, OQur cross sectione for 3hU and 2350 are probably better than

'those previously used and ‘should be considered in future calculations.

5. It would be desirsble if OPTIMERC could be modified to allow
multiple thermel groups, pgrticulerly-so that & more“correct_celculetion
could be made of the § of U as & function of fuel composition. As

'rin the case with the thorium cross sections, the optimization cannot be
carried out successfully 1f_this,varietion-is not built in to the code. -
If it is too difficult to provide for multiple thermal groups, then 1t

may be preferable to reduce the thermal cut-off fram 1. 86 ev to about
1.0 ev, LT ;.17 o SR |
‘6. Heterogeneity effects should be included in the high energy
region. - e C ' R '

As ‘an added comment, it would be 1n order 1n the future for the

reference design, s given by OPTIMERU, t0.be checked by e complete |
celculation 1n which the cross eection reduction is redone for the re-

ference composition,,_

3. CROSS SECTIONS

For the most pert the cross'sections'used both in this review and
in previous'molten galt breeder reactor design studies are the seme.
The cross section date used heve been eccumulated over’ a period OL about
five yesars and regularly used for reactor evaluation studies. In this
regard they have proven to be reasonably accurate in ccxnparison with |

‘experiments and calculations by others. A sunmary of the basic thermal ‘

neutron cross section data used in this review and their experimental

~ sources are given in Teble 3.1. Table 3.2 lists the resonsnce‘fission;'.' '

end absorption integrals and the date sources for the same nuclides.
There are some small differences between the thermal neutron Cross.
sections for some nuclides in this review and in the previous design |

studies. These differences are primarily e result of the issuance of R
Supplement II of ENL-325 (Ref. 1) which recommends some renormalizetionf

~ of previously accepted cross section values. ‘The differences ere shown
in Table 3.3. Of these differences only those in 233U 235U and 23h

ere significent in the MSER and leed to a slightly higher breeding ratio.:

The use of 2200 m/sec v of 2. 503 rather than 2.500 for 3U is con-

sistent with the BNL-325 (Ref. 1) recommended value for the prompt v

of 2.497 * 0.008 and & deleyed neutron.fnaction of 0. 00264, The 3 of

2.295 at 2200 m/sec for 33U is within the uncertainty range for this

-nuclide although not necesserily more accurste than the value of 2.292

used in the previous calculstions. : _ - )
235U 2200 m/sec dste have been renormalized a8 recnmmended in |

_'BNL-325, the primary result being a slightly higher a (0.175 ve O. 171;),

4. ,FISSION'ERODUCT_TREAIMENT |

The MERC calculation includes ~125 fiseion product nuclides in ex-

tplicit chains, However, many of these nuclides make - extremely small
',contributions to the overall fission product poison fractinn. To facili-
- tate our ASSAULT and L™ calculations, it appeared desirable to include
'these small contributions in one or. more pseudo—elements, with only the

more important nuclides being treeted explicitly 7
The long fission product treatment used in the advanced converter
study (ORNL- 3686) was chosen 8s the besic complete"‘fission product

‘description. This. description ie pictured in Fig. k.1. -

Since the fluid-fusl system in the MSER allows some of the fission
products to be stripped as,gases:or be removed in fuel processing,;the
above treatment needs to be modified to include those-effects. The
modifications made are discussed below. - L

99Mb half life is only 66, 5 hr, it vas assumed that the 99mn fission

7'2 135.Xe The assumptions of the MERC studies stated that & poison

| 'fraction of 0. 0050 (fractional loss per neutron absorbed in erl) would
'df*; be assumed for l35Xe to- allow fer any absorption ofrxenon and krypton by

‘faigraphite. Since this assumption determines the 35Xe concentration, the
r41351 precursor 1s not included in the chains. " -

5, CELL CAI.CULATIONS

o The infinite-medium code MFGAM'was used to calculate spectra and to
obtain energy-averaged cross -sections for neturons from 10 Mbv to l 86 ev.
Two of these celculetions were made, one for the typical core cell, shown
- in Fig. De l end the other for a homogeneous cell representing the blanket
| ccmposition. Two subsidiary calculations were done first to provide input
'5informetion for the M-GAM calculetion' & calculation of high energy intra-
cell flux ratios and = calculation of effective chord length for the
resonance absorbers. The intra-cell flux ratios were obtained for the
energy groups between 10 Mev and 30 kev, by'means of & one-dimensional
celculation of the cell in Sh approximation to the transport ‘equation.
The code ANISN’was‘used Thirty group cross sections were obtained through
use—of GAM-Il to reduce the 9h group library date. The cell was approxi--
mated by & series of concentric ennuli es ghown in Fig. 5.2 and described
in Tebles 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. The calculated: ratios of region flux to

cell flux are shown in Teble 5.k. The velues eppeering in Table 5.4 were

averaged by volume end density to obtain the. proper factors for input by
‘nuclide to the NLGAM celculation.

The effective resonance integrals for the resonance absorbers ere
calculated in the M-GAM code by'means of the narrow resonance and infinite
mass approximations. Heterogeneity effects are accounted for by specifying
the effective chord,length of & sphere, infinite cylinder, or infinite i
sleb which gives the same collision probabilities as the actual region

containing the resonance sbsorber. Since the fissile and fertile streem *f-‘

: regions of tke MSBR cell (Figure 5. l) do not correspond to & lattice of ,

1one of these simple shapes, & calculetion of the collision probabilitieS':_Vl-

C was reqnired. We used e three-dimensional Monte Carlo code in which the
,_'nentron histOries were sterted with random position and direction within

- the material for which the collision probability was to be calculated.
giThe fraction having 8 first collision in each of the materials was computed

for several values of its total CPOSs section. The fissile stream regions

in the core cell corresponded to an infinite cylinder with redius of 2.87
t 0.07 em with 95% confidence. This value was used for the isotopes,

~ of these dips and elastic resonances to the second and third dips. The

behavior in the lethargy range from 10.5 to 13 is caused by thorium
absorption. Thorium has‘four large resonances,which correspond in_lethargy
to the four dips appearing in this renge. The fluctuastions are always .
much more pronounced in the blanket calculation.thanlin the cell calcule-

- tion because the average densities of fluorineaand thorium are much greater

in the blanket than in the core.
THERMOS is & one-dimensional integral transport code which calculates

~ the scalar thermal neutron spectrum as & function of position. ' The basic

THERMOS data consists of & thirty group library tepe. These fine groups
are then averaged over the spectrum and over the cell to obtain broad
group cross sections. In the present calculations four broad group thermal
cross sections were‘generated_with energy_limits as follows: 0.005 ev to
0.06 ev, 0.06 ev to 0.18 ev, 0.18 ev to 0.77 ev and 0.7 ev to 1.86 ev.

~ The one-dimensional genmetry of THERMOS makes necessary the desgcrip-
tion of the cell es a series of concentric annular rings. The core cell
description for TEERMOS was identical to that previously described for

- ANISN with one exception. Experience has shown that to obtain proper

fluxes in THERMOS the unit cell should be enclosed in & region celled a

‘heavy scatterer This region consists of a heavy nuclide whose only

reaction is scattering The unit cell as shown in Fig. 5 2 end -described
in Tebles 5.1, 5.2, and 5 3 was enclosed in such & region for the THERMOS

calculation.

The temperature of all materials in the cell and the blanket was

'assumed to be 900° K._”

The Spatial variation of the flux in two of the fine groups is shown

'in ‘Fig. 5.4 (energies. of.o_oe-o 03 ev and 0.07-0. 08 ev) _ The spatial

veriation is clearly quite small. Fig. 5.5. shows the energy distribution

6. TWO-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS

The reactor was described in R;ngeonetry-as shown in-Fig._6;l.

(ALl dimensions on this figure ere in feet.) Forty-eight mesh lines
were used in the radial direction and 67 exially. The region compositions
are listed in Teble 6. l and the main core densities are listed in Table
6. 2. Region 11, the center control rod, wes treated es & typical fuel
cell (Figure 5.1) with the fuel stream replaced by grephite. 'iﬁ“the

~ lower axiel blanket (region 12), each fuel tube WES considered to be
100% INOR-8 between the core and the .lower plenum. Region 18 is &
vacuum region which i used to impose & "black"'boundary condition on
the edjacent fuel end INOR bounderies. Region 19 is an annulus of fuel
'representing the four sets of entrance end exit fuel pipes at the bottom
of the reactor. Where possible, reactor dimensions and volume fractions
were made the same as in the previous celculstions (case 555).

- The nine-group neutron diffusion equations were solved with the
ASSAULT code.l A value of kegr = 0.95 vas obteined. The decrease in
kepse Of 0.05 compared to the -previous calculations is entirely attribut-
eble to & 21% higher thorium resonance integral used in our calculations.

A fuel search celculation was then made on the 2330 concentration
in the fuel stream until the reactor was Just critical.- 233U concen-
tration increase of 13.9% waes required to raise kepp to unity. A region-
by-region neutron balence for the critical configuration is given in
Tsble 6.3. Only sbout 0.006 of the absorptions per fissile absorption
occur outside the sﬁrrounding blankets, indicating optically thick blenkets.
In fact, the axisl leskage is s0 small that the axisl blankets could be 1
made somewhat thinner without affecting the neutron economy However,
about 0.005 neutrons absorbed in the lower axial blanket are captured
by INOR. This loss in breeding ratio might be avoided if it is possible
to extend the graphite fuel tubes below the core about 6- 12 in. before
making the transition to INOR.

The power density is very neerly in s Jb distribution radially-and
e cosine distribution axielly, as shown in Fig. 6.2 end 6.3. The radial
distribution corresponds to the mid-plane of the core, end the axial tra-

7. DEPLETION CALCULATIONS

The previous celculations used the MERC code which obtains equilibrium
reaction rates and equilibrium concentrations automatically. ‘The concen-
trations are obtained frcm the ERC portion of. ME:RC which solves directly _
the coupled equations of the equilibrium condition for e circulating fuel
reactor. Since we wished to make an independent check on the velidity
of the solution, and had no other code available;which‘solves the same
'problem, we made extensive modifications to an existing code. We took
the LTM code, which does & multigroup point-depletion calculation of the
equilibrium cycle for & solid-fuel reactor, and changed it to do & one-
group, point-depletion calculation of the fluid fuel cycle. This required
thet the code use average.streem densities for losses snd‘removals, that
it permit specification of separate cycle times for the two streams, and
that the nuclide chains be modified to include all of those discussed in
section & of this report. |

We used the one-group cross sections (microscopic reaction rates)
obtained from the ASSAULT calculation for each nuclide in each stream,

The removal of fission producte wes treated as indiceted in section 4.
Losses of uranium isotopes were assumed to be 0.001 per reprocessing ,
cycle, loss of 33Pa vas assumed to be 0.00001 per cycle, and 237Np was
assumed to be.removed completely each cycle. Complete transfer of uranium

isotopes from the fertile to the fissile stream at the end of each fertile

stream cycle was assumed. ; _

Teble 7.1 gives the resulting neutron balence. The gross (nuclear)
breeding retio is 1.062 compared with 1.05k previously obtained (ORNL-
TM-1467, celculated from Teble 8). | |

Previous calculetions have made the tacit assumption that the equilib-
rium fuel cycle can be used to represent the reactor history though it
is known that some molten salt reactors might have to be started up on
& uranium fully enriched in 35

In order to check the validity of the equilibrium assumption, we did
8 time-dependent depletion calculation for the heavy nuclides over & 30-
ryear reactor history, sterting with a 93% 235y - % 238U fuel. We held
the thorium concentration constent end varied the fissile concentration tol

maintain criticality. ILeakage and parasitic absorptions were held con-
stent at the velues determined hy'the'DTM'calculation, and the heavy
nuclide reaction rates were obtained from the ASSAULE calculations. We
assumed complete removal of plutonium isotopes -on each cycle.

Flgures T.1, 7.2 and T.3 give,a picture of the approach to equilib-
rium. - The net breedingaratio, asfdefined in Fig. 7.3, 1is the quentity
of fissionsble materisl produced less the amount lost divided byithe
amount consumed‘in nuclear reactions. This quantity reeached on equilib-
rium velue of 1.054 and was 1.041l when aversged over'the 30-year history.
It isrnoteworthy that sale of surplus,fissionable materisls started after
only four months of operation, aslthough the breeding ratio-did,not reach'
unity until after about two years of operation. The difference{of one',
and one-half years was caused by & reduction of fissile inventory to
- meintein eriticality es the reactor shifted from 235U’to 233U "It should
also be noted that the 236U concentration went through3§ maximum eerly

in the reactor life and then decreased following the U concentration
decresse instesd of gradually'building up toward equilibrium as fre-
quently- assumed. - ‘

A good measure of the suitability of equilibrium calculations-is the
comparison of present-valued costs over the 30-year history with those
for the equilibrium cycle. These are shown in Teble 7.2, with the fuel
.yield and inventories teken from our calculstions, and the other costs

from ORNL- TM-1467.1
