Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor (MSR)
Program is the.development of nuclear reactors that
use fluid fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile
materials in suitable carrier salts. The program isan
outgrowth of the effort begun over 20 yearsago in the
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) Program to
make a molten-salt reactor power plant for aircraft.
A molten-salt reactor, the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment, was operated at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory in 1954 as part of the ANP Program.

. The major goal now isto achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while
simultaneously conserving and extending the na-
tion’s fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor
would be ?*UF, dissolved in a mixture of LiF and
BeF:, but **U or plutonium could be used for
startup. The fertile material would be ThF4dissolved
in the same salt ot in a separate blanket salt of similar
composition. The technology being developed for the
breeder is also applicable: to high-pcrformanoe
converter reactors.

- A major program activity through 1969 was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

(MSRE). This reactor was built to test the types of

fuels and materials that would be used in thermal
breeder and converter reactors; it also provided
operation and maintenance experience. The MSRE

- operated at 650°C and produced 7.3 MW of heat.

The initial fuel contained 0.9 mole % UF., 5% Z1F.,,
29% BeF, and 65% "LiF; the uranium was about 33%
33U, The fuel circulated through a reactor vessel and

an external pump and heat exchange system. Heat

produced in the reactor was transferred toa cooiant

- salt, and the coolant salt was pumped through a

radiator to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. All
this equipment was constructed of Hastelloy N, a

 nickel-molybednum-iron-chromium alloy. The reac-

tor contained an assembly of graphite moderator

"bars in direct contact with the fuel.

Design of the MSRE was started in 1960,
fabrication of equipment began in 1962, and the
reactor became critical on June 1, 1965. Operationat

low power began in January 1966, and sustained
power operation was begun in December 1966. One
run continued for six months, until stopped on
schedule in March 1968.

- Completion of this six-month run ended the ﬁrst'
phase of MSRE operation, in which the objectlve was
to show, on a small scale, the attractlve features and
technical feasibility of these systems for commercial
power . reactors. The conclusion was that this
objective had been achieved and that the MSRE had
shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be operated
at 650° C without corrosive attack on cither the metal
or graphite parts of the system; also the fuel is
stable; the reactor equipment can operate satisfactor-
ily at these conditions; xenon can be removed rapidly
from molten salts; and when necessary, the radioac-
tive equipment can be repaired or replaced ,

The second phase of MSRE operatnon began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous
F.. In six days of fluorination, 221 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded into

“absorbers filled with sodiun fluoride pcllets The

~ decontamination and recovery of the uranium were

very good.
After the fuel was processcd a charge of *’U was
addcd to the original carrier salt, and in October 1968

~ the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate

on 2**U. The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE

. with the ¥>U were close to the predictions, and the

vii

reactor was quite stable. In September 1969, small
amounts of PuF; were added to the fuel to obtain
some experience with plutonium in a molten-salt
reactor. The MSRE was shut down permanently
December 12, 1969, so that the funds supporting its
operation could be used elsewhere in the rescarch and
development program.

Because of limitations on the chemical-processing
methods available in the past, most of our work on
breeder reactors was aimed at two-fluid systems in
which graphite tubes would be used to separate

 
 

 

uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing

viii

fertile salts. However, in late 1967 a one-fluid breeder

became feasible with the development of processes
that use liquid bismuth to isolate protactinium and

remove rare earths from a salt that also contains

thorium. Our studies showed that a one-fluid breeder
based on these processes can have fuel-utilization
characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid
design concepts. Since the graphite serves only as
moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a
scale-up of the MSRE. These advantages caused a
change in the emphasis of the program from the two-
fluid to the one-fluid breeder; most of the design and
development effort is now dlrected to the one-ﬂuld
system.

In the congressional authonzatlon report on the
- AEC’s programs for FY 1973, the Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy recommended that the molten-salt
reactor be appraised so that a decision could be made
about 'its continuation and the level of fundmg
appropriate for it. Consequently, a- thorough review
of molten-salt technology was undertaken to provide

information for an appraisal. A significant result of .

- the review was the preparation of ORNL-4812, The
Development Status of Molten-Salt Breeder Reac-
tors. A subsequent decision was made by the AECto
terminate work on molten-salt reactors for budgetary
reasons; in January 1973 ORNL was dlrccted to
conclude MSR development work. -

In January 1974, the AEC program for molten-salt
reactor development was reinstated. A considerable
effort during 1974 was concerned with assembling a
program staff, making operational a number of
development facilities used previously, and replacing

a number of key developmental facilities that had
been reassigned to other reactor programs. A
significant undertaking was the formulation of
detailed plans for the development of molten-salt
breeder reactors and the preparation of ORNL-5018,

Program Plan for Development of Molren-Salt

Breeder Reactors., |
During 1974 and 1975, work in the Molten-Salt

Reactor Program was devoted to the technology .

- needed for molten-salt reactors. The work included

conceptual design studies and work on materials, the
chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, fission-product
behavior, processing methods, and the development

of systems and components. The most important

single aspect _of the program was work on the
development and demonstration of an alloy that is

suitablé for the primary circuit of an MSBR and has -

adequate resistance to tellurium-induced shallow
intergranular crackmg, which was first observed in
MSRE surveillance specimens. A second important
area consisted of studies of the chemical iriteraction
of tritium with the MSBR secondary coolant, both in
laboratory chemistry studies and in a large engineer-

ing facility (Coolant-Salt Technology Facility). -

These studies culminated in the demonstration of an
adequate basis for management of trltlum in a 1000-
Mw(e) MSBR.

In February 1976, ORNL was directed by ERDA
to again terminate the Molten-Salt Reactor Program
for budgetary reasons. Work during the remainder of
FY 1976 was directed toward completion of short-
term work in the Program, reporting of associated

information, and the assignment of the MSRP staff

and experimental facilities to other ORNL programs.

 
 

 

 

Summary

PART 1. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
"~ J.R.Engel

L. Systems and Analysis

The investigation of tritium behavior in the MSBR
reference coolant salt, NaBFs-NaF eutectic, is
continuing in the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility
(CSTF). Results have been evaluated for three short-
term tritium-addition tests, and preliminary results
have been obtained for a steady-state test that is still
* in progress.

- The buildup rate of tntlum in the salt during the
short-term (10-hr) additions indicated that 50-60%
of the added tritium was being trapped in the saltina
chemically combined form. However, subsequent
evaluations of the total tritium flow through the
CSTF off-gas system indicated that additional
tritium was being accumulated somewhere in the
system and released. to .the salt after the additions
were stopped. The extra material may have been
temporarily accumulated in the loop walls as
elemental ‘tritium. The concentrations of elemental
tritium in the saltimmediately after each of the short-
‘term -additions were estimated from the concentra-

tions of elemental tritium in the off-gas samplesand

an assumed value for stripping efficiency in the pump
bowl. The results, in conjunction with the measured
concentrations of combined tritium in ‘the salt,
indicated that the ratio of combmed-to-elemental
' tntlum in the salt was about 300 to 500.

- Before the fourth (steady-state) tritium addition
test, equipment was added to the CSTF to permit
direct: measurement -of the partial pressure of

tal hydrogen in the loop walls is thought to be the
rate-limiting. process.) After about four weeks of
tritium addition, the sample results indicated that 96
to 99% of the tritium leaving the CSTF was being
removed in the loop off-gas, and only'1 to 4% was
permeating through. the loop walls. The overall
material balance on tritium flow rate appeared to be
between 0.89 and 0.97. Measurements of the partial

~ pressure of hydrogen in the salt (0.43 Pa) were

reasonably consistent with the apparent partial
pressure of elemental hydrogen in the pump-bowl gas
space, as indicated by the observed concentration of
elemental tritium in off-gas samples. Use of the
measured partial pressure with the measured tritium
concentration in the salt gives a value of 4700 for the
ratio of combined-to-elemental tritium in the salt. If
this concentration - ratio were attained in the
reference-design MSBR, only ~3.5 Ci/d of tritium
would be released to the steam system and, hence, to
the environment.

The development of a 123-energy-group neutron
cross-section library, based on ENDF/ B, Version 1V,
wascompleted. The library includes cross sections at
four temperatures from 300 K to 1200 K for several
fuel-moderator ratios that are appropriate to the

reference-design - MSBR. Further processing to

produce few-group cross sections for multidimen-
sional diffusion-theory calculations of the reactor
performance were delayed by difficulties with the
relevant computer codes. However, estimates were
obtained for the flux spectrum and the flux density in
both the reactor and the reactor vessel of the

- reference-design MSBR. While the work required to

hydrogen'in the saltand to provide data on the rate of

hydrogen permeation through the loop walls. These
additions were designed to provide alldata necessary
for an overall hydrogen (and" tntmm) materxal
balance.

The attainment of steady-state conditions reqmred
considerably more time than had been projected
from the short-term tests. (Accumulation of elemen-

ix

“complete ‘the cross-section - processing and the
performance calculations has been identified, it will
not be done because the MSR' program will be

terminated at the end of FY 1976. _

" The estimated helium concentration in the Hastel-
loy N pressure vessel of an MSBR after 30 full-power .
years, due principally to two-step *Ni(n,y) *Ni(n,a)
reactions, is 38 ppm at the inner surface. The con-
centration. would decrease by about 500% for

 
 

 

each centimeter of penetration into the vessel wall,
which is expected to have a thickness of about 5 cm.

The calculated steady-state concentration of >**U
in the uranium in an MSBR is 20 ppm if protactinium
is removed from the salt on a 10-day cycle and if no
2%Th is present. (About 15 years would be required to
approach equilibrium.) Approximately 27% of the
2324 results from (n,2n) and (v,n) reactions in ***U,
and the remainder is due to similar reactions in ¥
A concentration of 23 ppm *°Th in thorium would
double the steady-state concentration of ***U.

Neutron-flux monitors were provided for two
additional in-pile irradiation capsules, TeGen-2 and
TeGen-3. The irradiated wires were recovered from
TeGen-2 and are being analyzed and TeGen-3 is still
being irradiated. '

The development of simplified hlgh-temperature
structural design methods, which could be applicable

to MSBR design, is continuing, principally for other

reactor programs. Some cases have been identified in
which the simplified, elastic-analysis rules are
- nonconservative in comparison with more accurate
(and more expensive) inelastic analyses. Potential
sources of the lack of conservatism are being
investigated. Some of the data (thermal transients
and material properties) have been obtained to
estimate the magnitude of thermal ratchetting and
creep-fatigue damage that might occur in an MSBR.
These estimates will indicate the applicability of the
simplified design procedures to Hastelloy N.

2. Systems and Components Dévelopment

A Jarger diameter impeller was installed in the salt
pump of the Gas-Systems Technology Facility, and
additional water tests were made. The amplitude of
the pump shaft oscillations was acceptable; however,
the hydraulic imbalance between the volute and
impeller, caused by operation far from the pump
design point, resulted in unacceptable deflections of
the shaft. Extensive pump modifications would be
required to meet the loop design requirements. It
appears that the back vanes installed on the larger
impeller overcompensated for the shaft seal leakage
and reversed the direction of the flow. Because of the
termination of the MSR Program at the end of FY
1976, the loop has been drained and put in standby
condition.

Another trans:ent - tritium addmon test was

~ completed on the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility,
and a long-term steady-state test is in progress.
Several changes were made in the sampling systems
for the loop off-gas and for the enclosure ventilation

air to improve the reliability of the data and to permit

the collection of data that will allow the evaluation of
tritium material balances for the system. Operation
of the facility has been highly reliable.

The forced-convection loop, MSR-FCL-2b, has
accumulated 4000 hr of operation with MSBR
reference fuel salt at design conditions (566°C
minimum, 704°C maximum; 2.5 and 5.0 m/s salt
velocities), with the expected low corrosion rates in

" standard Hastelloy N. Additions of NiF, were made

in preparation for determining the corrosion rates for
this alloy at higher U**/ U*" ratios. Increases in pump
power, which previously had accompanied increases
in the oxidation potential of the salt, were again
observed at each addition. These tests were inter-
rupted by two successive loop piping ruptures that
resulted from salt freezing in the loop during off-
normal conditions. Modifications were made in
conjunction with the loop repairs to reduce the
possibility of future similar failures. Because of the
decision to terminate the MSR Program at the end of
FY 1976, the corrosion studies with standard

' Hastelloy N were discontinued; tests are now in

progress to examine the corrosion of Hastelloy N
modified by the addition of 1% niobium.

Construction of two additional forced-convection
loops, MSR-FCL-3 and 4, is being stopped because
of cancellation of the MSR Program.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY
3. Fuel-Salt Chr;misny )

Measurements were made of the solubility of Li;Te
in molten Li:BeF over the range from 500 to 700°C.
Li;Te was prepared using a mixture of stable
tellurium and ‘*"Te tracer. Salt that had been
equilibrated with the solid Li.Te was sampled, and
the tracer was counted using a lithium-drifted
germanium detector. The most recent data indicate a
solubility below 10~° mole fraction at 700°C.

Spectrophotometric studies of lithium telluridesin
molten LiF-BeF, mixtures were continued. This
work has progressed to the point where three
tentative conclusions can be made: (1) Li;Te is quite
insoluble in LiF-BeF, melts; (2) the light-absorbing
species in LlF‘fBCFZ melts apparently can be
represented as Te," ; (3) although the results are not
conclusive, it is reasonable to expect the Te; ion to
exist in molten-salt solutions.

In other spectral studies, the pressures of tellunum
due to the equilibrium 2LiTe; = Li;Te + */2 Tea(g)

were determined over the range from 500 to 750°C.

Previously determined vapor pressures for pure

 
 

 

 

 

 

tellurium were used to calibrate the system. The
measured equilibrium pressures of Te: over LiTe;
were only about a factor of 1.5 lower than the vapor
pressures of Te: and can be represented by the

equation In P(mm Hg) = 15.938 - 12,720/ T(K).

Evidence for a slightly volatile lithium telluride was
found at temperatures around 1000°C.

Electrochemical studles were initiated on the
lithium tellurides Li,Te and LiTe; in LiCl-KCl
eutectic at 400°C. Both of these tellurides were
insoluble in the melt at this temperature. Cathodiza-
tion of a tellurium electrode did show that a one-
electron process was occurring. It was also observed
that the presence of moisture in these systems led to
the formation of colored soluble species.

Studies of the equilibrium UF«(d) + /2 Ha(g) =
UFs(d) + HF(g) in molten LiF-BeF, mixtures were
continued using a spectroscopic method. Initially,
the molar extinction coefficient for UF; was
determined in LiF-BeF; (66-34 and 48-52 mole %).
Values of the quotient for the above equilibrium were
then determined in the two solvents over the range
from 500 to 800° C, The quotients in the 66-34 mole %
solvent were essentially the same as those measured
previously by Long and Blankenship; however, those
in the 48-52 mole % solvent were about 10 times
greater than those determined by Long and Blanken-
ship. The change in the present values with change in
solvent composition is consistent with expectations
based on prior studies of similar equilibria.

4. Coolant-Salt Chcmxstry

Raman and F NMR spectroscopy were used to
study the hydrolytic behavior of Na3;B;F¢Os since this
compound appears to be the stable . oxygen-
containing species in NaF-NaBF. (8-92 mole %)
when the total oxygen concentration is low. The
results showed that Na;B;F¢O; and NaBF;OH
reversibly interconvert in the presence of water.

Assuming that this is also true in molten NaF-NaBF,, -

5. Development and Evaluation
‘of Analytical Methods

‘The monitoring of U*'/ U** ratios, which reflect the
oxidation potential of the fuel salt, was continued
during this period for one forced-convection loop,
four thermal-convection loops, and eight creep-test
machines. Forced-convection loop FCL-2b, after a
shutdown period, was recharged with new salt and is
back in operatlon The U*/U* ratio at startup was
about 5.3 X 107, Thermal-convection loops NCL-
21A and -23 continue to operate at stabilized redox
conditions. Thermal convection loops 18C and 24
have shown a gradual decline in the U*"/U* ratio,
which is presently about 1.7 X 10? and 80 respectively.
The U*/ U™ ratios for the eight creep-test machines
are presented in tabular form. Generally, the melts
have tended to become more reducing with time.

The results from the third tritium injection
experiment at the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility
are similar to those from the first two experiments.
Most of the tritium occurs in a water-soluble or
combined form. Very little tritium in the off-gas was
in the elemental form. A fourth tritium injection
experiment is now under way.

Voltammetric measurements were made In

molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, following additions of LiTe;

and CriTes compounds in an effort to identify soluble
electroactive tellurium species. No voltammetric

evidence of such compounds was obtained. Electro-

a poss1ble mechanism for trapping of tritium in the

melt is postulated

_ Studies of the vapordensity in the system BFs-HzO
were continued.” At - temperatures above 200°C,
‘BF3:2H;0 is completely dissociated. Below 200°C,
association in the vapor phase becomes pronounced,
and, with sufficient BF3-2H,0 in the system, a stable
liquid phase is formed. The- vapor pressure of ‘the
liquid reaches 1 atm at about 200°C. Attempts to
determine equlhbnum constants for the vapor-phase
reactions are in progress. : :

chemical studies were carried out on the tellurium
species generated in situ in molten LiF-BeF>-ThF,
when a tellurium electrode is cathodized. The results
indicated that the species generated is of the type
Ten (M = 1) and appears to be unstable under the
existing experimental conditions.

Voltammetric studies were initiated on two
anodic waves that are observed at a gold electrode in
molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, and also in melten LiF-BeF-
ZrF.. Although the results are tentative, it is believed
that these waves are associated with oxygenated

species in the melts. The first wave possibly conforms

to the oxide — peroxide electrode reaction, and the

second wave represents the continued oxidation of

peroxide species ultimately to oxygen gas. Noise on
the diffusion current plateau indicates gas-bubble
formation at the electrode surface.
. PART 3. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT
) 6. Development of Modified Hastelloy N
Tubing of 2% titanium-modified Hastelloy N was
produced in a pilot run using the fabrication schedule

 
 

 

for austenitic. stainless steels. One commercial 2500-
Ib melt of Hastelloy N modified with 2% titanium and
1% niobium was fabricated successfulily into several
bar configurations. Eight small commercial alloys
containing 2% titanium and various amounts of
niobium were melted and fabricated into '/-in.-thick
plate. Laboratory alloys containing up to 4%
niobium were prepared and converted to '/e-in.-diam
rod for evaluation.

'Various types of tests were run in which spec1mens
were exposed to tellurium-containing environments.
The source of tellurium that is most representative of
tellurium in an MSBR appears to be a mixture of
Cr3Te* plus Cr'TeS. Examination of specimens
exposed in these various screening tests indicated
that alloys containing from 0.5 to 2% niobium are
most resistant to intergranular cracking by tellurium.
Mechanical property tests showed that these alloys
have slightly lower creep strength than 2% titanium-
modified Hastelloy N, but higher strength than
standard Hastelloy N. Postirradiation creep tests
showed that the niobium-modified alloys have
excellent properties after irradiation at 650°C,
acceptable properties after irradiation at 704°C, and
poor properties after irradiation at 760°C.

A fueled capsule containing pins of 2% titanium-
modified Hastelloy N, 2% titanium plus rare-earth-
element-modified Hastelloy N, and Inconel 600
revealed that all three materials were embrittled
intergranularly by exposure to tie fission-product
containing salt. Two other fuel capsules (six
materials) are in various stages of assembly and
irradiation.

7. Fuel Processing Materials Devélopment

A thermal-convection loop constructed of Ta-10%
W is being operated to evaluate the compatibility of
this alloy with fuel salt. Several graphite capsules
containing various bismuth-lithium solutions and
either molybdenum or Ta—10% W specimens were
heated for 1000 hr at 600 or 700°C. All capsules
demonstrated excellent compatibility although some
important differences were noted between - the
various capsules.

8. Chemistry of Fluorination and
Fuel Reconstitution

Studies of the chemistry of fuel reconstitution were
resumed. A test of the effectiveness of smooth
platinum for catalyzing the hydrogen reduction of

xii -

U™ to U* in small gold equipment has shown that

smooth platinum sheet of limited surface area would
provide appreciable catalytic activity in the hydrogen
reduction column of the Fuel Reconstitution
Engineering Experiment. Niobium is an important
fission product with volatile fluorides and would be
carried from the fluorinator to the fuel reconstitution
step. Studies of the hydrogen reduction of NbF,
showed that in the absence of granular platinum, the
NbF, was reduced slowly to Nb°. In the presence of
granular platinum, the rate of NbF4 was rapid for the
first 2 hr and decreased to a value similar to that
experienced in the uncatalyzed reaction. The reason
for this behavior is being sought, since, if it is due to
poisoning of the platinum, it has significant implica-
tions for the use of platinum mtalysts in a reactor
processing plant.

9. Engineering Development
of Processing Operations

Two additional runs were made in Metal Transfer
Experiment MTE-3B. These runs were made using
agitator speeds of 4.17 and 1.67 rps to determine the
effect of agitation on the transfer rate of neodymium
from the fluoride fuel salt to the bismuth-lithium
stripper solution. Prior to these rums, it was
determined that the previously observed entrainment
of the fluoride salt into the LiCl resulted from
operation of the agitators at 5 rps. This was
unexpected since no entrainment was seen ‘in
experiment MTE-3 under similar conditions. Tests
showed that no entrainment occurred at agitator
speeds up to 4.58 rps. Before the two additional (and
final) runs were made, the LiCl and bismuth-lithium
solutions, contaminated with fluoride salt, were
removed from the process vessels and replaced with

“fresh Li1Cl and bismuth-lithium. Results of the two

runs show that the rate of transfer of neodymium was

increased by 300 to 400% when the agitator speed

increased from 1.67 to 4.17 rps. However, overall
mass-transfer coefficients for neodymium were lower
than predicted by literature correlations, partlcularly
at the LiCl-bismuth interfaces.

Students from the MIT School of Chemical
Engineering Practice have completed measuring
water-side mass-transfer coefficients in three stirred,
nondispersing, water-mercury contactors. A wide
range of agitator diameters and speeds was covered in
these measurements. These measurements have
provided a great deal of data covering a wide range of

physical parameters which will be useful in develop-

ing correlations to be used for estimating mass-
transfer rates in large-scale nondispersing stirred

 
 

 

 

contactors required in the MSBR reductive extrac-
tion processes. :

A fifth run was made with autoresistance heating
test AHT-4 using a different cooling procedure. This
run demonstrated that the main problem is the
plugging in the unheated end of the salt inlet tube
(electrode). A new electrode has been designed to
alleviate this problem. Eight cooling tests were made
with the Frozen Salt Corrosion Protection Demon-
stration equipment prior to the introduction of
fluorine. The purpose was to define the conditions
under which a satisfactory frozen salt film could be
formed. The fluorine inlet (inner) tube plugged
before the outer wall of the tube was cold enough to
form a satisfactory film. During the sixth test, air
oxidation resulted in a leak in the cooled tube. A
second smaller tube was fabricated with a separate
fluorine inlet tube, but a satisfactory film was not
formed in the first two tests using argon coolant.

During this report period a preliminary hydrody-
namic test of the experimental equipment for the fuel
reconstitution engineering experiment (FREE) was
successfully completed in which salt flow through the
system was maintained under simulated experimen-
tal conditions. A calibration of the UFs metering

system was completed; a gas density cell used for
measuring concentrations of UFs in argon was
calibrated; and apparatus for producing known
concentrations of HF in hydrogen was developed and
was used to calibrate the gas density cell for
measuring concentrations of HF in hydrogen.

PART 5. SALT PRODUCTION

10. Production of Fluoride Salt Mixtures
for Research and Development

Three 150-kg batches of fuel-carrier salt were
produced in a new copper-lined treatment vessel and
vessel head. The first two of these batches were of
significantly improved purity because the copper
linings reduced vessel corrosion products.

A total of 1975 kg of salts (of various composi-

* tions) were produced since activation of the facility in

1974. Of this, 678 kg are stored for possible future
use. .

Since the program has now been ended, all
production areas are decommissioned and decon-
taminated. All materials and equipment are appro-
priately disposed of.

 
 

 

Part 1. MSBR Design and Development

J. R. Engel

The overall objective of MSBR 'design and

development activities is to evolve a conceptual -

design for an MSBR with adequately demonstrated
performance, safety, and economic characteristics
that will make it attractive for commercial power
generation and to develop the associated reactor and
safety technology required for the detailed design,
construction, and operation of such a system. Since it
is likely that commercial systems will be preceded by
one or more intermediate-scale test and demonstra-
tion reactors, these activities include the conceptual
design and technology development associated with
the intermediate systems.

Although no system design work is currently in
progress, the ORNL reference conceptual design' is
being used as a basis to further evaluate the technical

characteristics and performance of large molten-salt -

systems. A major effort in this regard is the
evaluation of tritium behavior in the Coolant-Salt

Technology Facility and the extrapolation of those

results to the MSBR. Early results indicate that the
reference coolant salt, NaBF.-NaF eutectic, will
permit limitation of the tritium release to a few curies
per day.

Additional core neutronics calculations are being
made for the reference MSBR, using nuclear data
from ENDF/B, Version IV. These calculations will
provide updated estimates of the nuclear perfor-

mance, as well as additional information on core

characteristics. Analogous methods and data are

‘employed to prowde support for mpnle nrradlanon
work.
" Analytic studies are in progress to assess the

potential significance of thermal ratchetting and
creep-fatigue considerations in the design of Hastel-

loy N components for operatxon at hlgh tempera-

tures.

The Gas-Systems Technology Facility is an
engineering-scale loop built for use in the develop-
ment of gas-injection and gas-stripping technology
for molten-salt systems and for the study of xenon
and tritium behavior and heat transfer in MSBR fuel
salt. The facility was operated briefly with water to
measure loop and pump characteristics that would be
required for the performance and analysis of
developmental tests with fuel salt. This facility is now

shut down and in a standby condition.

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility is being
operated routinely to study processes involving the
MSBR reference-design coolant salt, NaBFs-NaF
eutectic. Tests are currently in progress to evaluate
the distribution and behavior of tritium in this
system.

Candidate MSBR structural materials are exposed
to fuel salt at reference design temperatures and
temperature differences (704°C maximum and
139°C AT) and at representative salt velocities in
forced-convection loops to evaluate corrosion effects
under various chemical conditions. These opera-
tions, which are principally in support of the
materials development effort, also provide experi-
ence in the operation of molten-salt systems and data
on the physical and chemical characteristics of the

“salt. At present one loop, MSR-FCL-2b, which is

made of standard Hastelloy N, is in routine operation
as part of a study of the corrosion of Hastelloy N
containing 1% niobium. Constructlon of a major
fraction of two other loops was completed before

‘work on them was discontinued because of the

decision to terminate the MSR Programat theend of
FY 1976.

 
 

 

 

1 Systems and Analysis

J. R. Engel

1.1 TRITIUM BEHAVIOR
IN THE COOLANT-SALT
TECHNOLOGY FACILITY

J.R.Engel G.T. Mays

Experiments to elucidate the behavior of hydrogen

(tritium) in MSBR coolant salt are continuing in the
Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF). To date,

three relatively short transient tests have been
performed, and a longer steady-state test is currently
in progress. In all these tests, a substantial fraction of

the tritiated hydrogen that was added to the salt has

been retained in the salt in a chemically combined
form that was slowly removed from the system by
transfer to the loop cover gas. This retention

- significantly reduced the amount of elemental

hydrogen that was available for transport through
the loop walls.

Preliminary results of the first two transient tcsts
were presented in the previous semiannual report.’
Additional results for these tests and for the third
transient test are presented in the next two sections
(1.1.1-1.1.2). Preliminary results are also presented
for the steady-state test that is in progress. Extrapola-
tion of these results to the reference-design 1000-
MW(e) MSBR indicates that tritium migration to the
steam system (and hence to the environment) would_
be less than 10 Ci/day (370 GBq/d).

' l.l.l Analysis of Experiments
- Tland T2

. I'n. experiment T1 it was previously reported? that
the apparent half-life for removal of water-soluble

~ (combined) tritium from the salt was 9.2 hr. This

value, when incorporated into the buildup of
combined tritium in the salt during the addition
phase of the experiment, implies a trapping efficiency
of 85%. After the results fromexperiments T2and T3
were analyzed and. after the apparent trapping
efficiencies of 50% and 55%, respectively, were
calculated, the trapping efficiency of experiment T1
was reexamined. Depending on the inventory at the
end of the addition period and on how the data for
the subsequent salt samples are extrapolated back to
the end of the addition period, a half-life of 12 hr for
removal of tritium from the salt could be determined.
This would lead to a trapping efficiency of 60%,

which is more nearly consistent with the trapping
efficiencies for experiments T2 and T3.

In test T2, because of a greater number of sample
measurements and less scatter in the salt data during
the removal portion of the experiment immediately
after the addition period, a more reliable estimate of
the half-life for removal of tritium from the salt could
be made. For experiment T2, a 12-hr half-life also
was determined. Even though the data from the
second experiment suggested the presence of one or
more other mechanisms for removal of tritium from
the salt with significantly longer time constants, the
extraction of these time constants was not attempted
because of the scatter in the data at longer times.
Consequently, a single first-order process with a 12-
hr half-life was used to describe both the removal of
tritium from the salt and the initial buildup. If the
longer time constant or constants could be extracted,
the half-life for the short-term process would be less
than 12 hr. However, neglecting the longer time
constant and using only the 12-hr half-life provide a
reasonable basis for calculating the expected rate of
tritium buildup in the salt. The comparison of
calculated and observed inventories (Fig. 1.1) as
functions of time during the addition period illustrate
reasonable agreement. Improved agreement would
be expected if additional time constants were
factored into the calculation.

Based on the off-gas flow rate and the measured
concentrations of water-soluble tritium in the off-gas
during experiment T2, approximately 65 mCi (2.4
GBq) of water-soluble tritium had flowed through
the off-gas system during the first 240 hr after the
start of the experiment. However, only about 50 mCi
(1.8 GBq) could be accounted for in terms of water-

soluble tritium released from' the salt during the

addition and the inventory in the salt at the end of the
addition. Part of this discrepancy can be explained by
a fewapparently high off-gas sample results that were
used in evaluating the integrated tritium off-gas flow.
However, the magnitude of the discrepancy and the
long time constant for tritium removal from the salt
suggest that the water-soluble form of tritium
continued to appear in the salt (and to be stripped out
in the off-gas) after the deliberate tritium addition
was stopped. It is suggested that some of the added
tritium temporarily accumulated in a reservoir other
than the salt (possibly as elemental tritium in the pipe

walls) and then transferred back into the salt when
the salt concentration had decayed to a sufficiently
low level.

1.1.2 Analysis of Experiment T3

In experiment T3 approx1mately 49 mCi(1.8 GBq)
of tritium were added in 30.5 cm’ of gas durlng the
9.87-hr addition period. Immediately prior to the
start of the third test, single samples of the salt and
off-gas indicated the following tritium concentra-
tions:

In salt 1.6 nCifg (59 kBq/kg)
In off-gas, elemental 0.42 pCi/cm®  (15.5 kBq/m3)
In off-gas, combined . 38 pCifem® (1.4 MBq/m®)

These concentrations are comparable to those

obtained at the end of both the first and second

experiments. The sample results for experiment T3

(Fig. 1.2) are presented without correctxons for any
baseline concentrations.

The tritium concentration in the salt peaked at40
nCi/g (1.5 MBq/kg) at the end of the addition period
and decreased in a manner similar to that observed in -

experiments T1 and T2. If two first-order processes
for removal of tritium from the salt are assumed, as
suggested by the data, the apparent half-lives for the
processes are 8.7 and ~ 108 hr. These processes lead
to an apparent trapping efficiency of 55% for the salt.
Recalling that the apparent efficiencies in experi-

ments T1 and T2 were 609% and 509%, respectively, the

trapping efficiencies for the three experiments are
reasonably consistent.

Using the 8.7 and 108-hr values for the half-lives,a
comparison was made between the calculated and
observed inventories as functions of time during the
tritium addition (Fig. 1.3). The two processes
associated with these half-lives provide a reasonable
description of both the buildup and decay of tritium

- concentration in the salt.

Elemental tritium in the off-gas reached a

- maximum concentration of 40 pCi/em® (1.5

MBq/m®), which was significantly higher in relation
to the tritium concentration in the salt than in test T2.
The concentration of elemental tritium in the salt,
inferred from the elemental tritium concentration in
the off-gas, was 0.1 nCi/ g (3.9 kBq/kg), which led to
a ratio of 380 for the combined-to-elemental
hydrogen in the salt.

The concentration of water-soluble tritium in the
loop off-gas at the ‘end of the addition period was
10,200 pCi/cm’ (~380 MBg/ m®). This result was also
significantly higher than the tritium concentration in

" the salt at the comparable time during experiment

T2. Two first-order time constants were extracted
from the time variation of the concentration of water-
soluble tritium- in the off-gas. The half-life of the
more rapid process ranged from 7 to 15 hr, while the

half-life for the longer process was about 70 hr.

About 150 hr after the start of the third addition,
37 mCi (1.3 GBq) of tritium in the water-soluble form

 
 

 

 

had passed through the off-gas system while only 25
mCi could be accounted for from salt-sample results.
Again, the indication is that of a tritium inventory
that is not revealed by salt samples. '
Measurements of the tritium concentration in the
exhaust air from the loop enclosure of the CSTF were
made shortly after the end of the addition period in

an attempt to determine the rate of tritium permea-
tion through the loop walls. These measurements
were invalidated by simultaneous operations to
dispose of excess tritium from the addition station by
venting to the loop enclosure at the end of the third
addition. When the loop sample results had reached
previous baseline values, the loop sampling fre-

quency was reduced and several tests were made to
develop a method for determining the rate of
permeation of tritium through the loop walls.
Tritium was added to the loop enclosure and to one
of the cooling shrouds on the loop piping while
samples of the ventilation air were analyzed for
tritium content. These tests led to the use of an air-
sample tap in the discharge line from one of the
coolers and to modification of the cooler inlets to
supply fresh air (instead of air from within the
enclosure) to that cooler. The results indicated that
the tritium concentration in the air leaving the cooler
would be readily and accurately measurable if
anticipated loop-wall permeation rates were experi-
enced.

Immediately after the end of the tritium addition
phase of test T3,
obtained to determine if the addition tube (or a
similar device immersed in the main salt stream)
could be used to measure the partial pressure of
elemental hydrogen in the circulating salt. The

addition tube was evacuated several times and then -

“isolated”; it was expected that any pressure rise
within the isolated tube would be due to hydrogen
partial pressure in the salt, but the pressure did not
reach a steady value. It was subsequently determined
that stray inleakage (presumably of air) was
occurring and that the rate of inleakage.was not
sufficiently consistent to permit the extraction of
meaningful data about the hydrogen partial pressure.

However, it appeared that a sufficiently leaktight °

device could be used to measure hydrogen partial
pressure. Therefore, a partial-pressure probe was
constructed and installed in the CSTF for experi-
ment T4.

1.1.3 Analysis of Experiment T4

The fourth tritium experiment—a steady-state
experiment—in the CSTF is in progress. This
experiment was started on February 3, 1976. Data
~ are still being accumulated, and results obtained thus
far are preliminary. The operational and experimen-
tal conditions for this test are described in Sect. 2.2.

An attempt was made to start this experiment on
January 27, 1976, with trxtlated hydrogen being

o added to the loop at 6 cm Y(STP)/ hr. This attempt

was discontinued when the bypass rate of tritiated
hydrogen into the vacuum guard chamber surround-
ing the addition probe was found to be significantly
greater than had been observed during previous
tritium tests. This bypass rate was about 14 times the

rate at which tritium was reaching the circulating salt. -

some preliminary data were

Flow tests to measure the leakage as a function of
addition-tube pressure indicated that, for an
addition-tube pressure of 35 kPa (5 psia), the bypass
rate would be 1.5 cm’(STP)/ hr, approximately equal
to the addition rate to the salt, which was considered
tolerable.
Prior to the attempted addition on January 27,

samples from the CSTF showed the following tritium
concentrations:

Tritium in the salt: <i to 8 nCi/g (<40 to 300
kBq/kg)

Water-soluble (combined) tritium in off-gas: 20 to 50
pCi/cm’ (0.7 to 2 MBq/m?) |

Elemental tntnum in off-gas: 5 to 17 pC1/ cm’ (0.2 to
0.6 MBq/m’)

Elemental tritium in cooling-duct air:
ground*

~Back-

Those pretest samples taken on February 3, prior to .
the actual start of the test, were biased by the tritium
added on the January 27 attempt

- The tritium concentration in the salt (Fig. 1 4) rose
in a manner similar to that observed in previous tests
to 500 nCi/ g (~20 MBq/kg) about 2.5 days after the
start of the addition. The tritium concentration
subsequently rose to a value of 700 nCi/g (24.5
MBq/kg) (£10%).

The concentration of water-soluble tritium in the

- off-gas increased to a value of 150,000 pCi/cm’ (5.5

GBg/m®) about four days after the start of the
addition. It then gradually increased to 180,000 to
190,000 pCi/cm® (6.7 to 7.0 GBg/m®). This corre-
sponds to a flow rate of 22 to 23 mCi/ hr (0.22t00.23
GBq/s) of tritium or 1.5 to 1.6 cm’/hr of total
hydrogen (at 5600 ppm tritium in hydrogen) in the

- off-gas in the water-soluble form.

The elemental tritium concentration in the off-gas

~ showed irregular behavior and scatter for about one

day following the start of the addition before

~ increasing in an orderly fashion to a value of 22,000

pCi/cm’ (~0.8 GBq/m’). This irregular behavior was
not entirely unexpected and may have been due to
conditioning of new piping in the off-gas system that
had been installed prior to this experiment. A
somewhat similar phenomenon occurred during the
first tritium addition experiment. The concentration
of elemental tritium in the off-gas subsequently
decreased to a value between 10,000 and 11,000
pCi/cm’® (0.37 GBq/m’ and 0.41 GBq/m’). There-

" Fig. 1.4. Tritium concentrations at various points in the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility during experiment T4,

fore, elemental tritium is appearing in the off-gas
system at a rate of 1.2 to 1.32mCi/hr (~12.5t0 13.6
MBq/s) or 0.08 to 0.09 cm’/hr total hydrogen.
Measurable concentrations of tritium were ob-
served in the first sample of air taken from the loop

- cooling duct 2 hr after the start of the experiment.

Since then, the concentration has varied between 0.2
and 0.8 pCi/cm’ (7 to 30 kBq/ m’). These concentra-
tions correspond to a net flow of 0.2 to 0.8 mCi/hr
(2.1t0 2.2 MBq/s) of tritium 0r0.013 t0 0.054 cm®/ hr
of total hydrogen through the walls of the loop piping
and pump bowl. Thus the total flow rate of tritiated
hydrogen -out of the CSTF is from 1.6 to 1.75
cm’(STP)/hr via the off-gas system and permeation

of the metal walls, with 96 to 99% of the total bemg

removed through the off-gas system. .
Measurement of the bypass rate of hydrogen
around the addmon probe indicated an average rate
of ~1.2 ¢cm’/hr. Tritiated hydrogen is being con-
sumed (addition rate to loop plus bypass rate) at ~3.0

cm’/hr. Thus, with 1.6 to 1.75 cm®*(STP)/ hr being
removed from the CSTF, 89 to 97% of the tritium
that is fed to the addition probe can be accounted for.
The measured concentration of elemental tritium
in the off-gas corresponds to a partial pressure of 0.2
Pa (1.5 pm Hg) for elemental tritiated hydrogen in
the pump bowl gas space. This value compares
favorably with the measured hydrogen partial
pressure in the main circulating salt stream, 0.43 Pa
- (3.2 pm Hg). If the liquid in the pump bowl is
assumed to be in equilibrium with the gas phase, the
change in the hydrogen partial pressure between the
salt in the loop and that in the pump bowl may be
used to estimate the solubility of elemental hydrogen
in the NaBF,-NaF mixture. For the nominal flow
rate of salt through the pump bowl, 15 gpm (0.95 X
107 m’/s), the solubility coefﬁcwnt for elemental
hydrogen would be 1.7 X 10™"® atm (atom/cm®)”’,
compared to an earlier estimate -of 4 X 107",
Conversely, if the earlier estimate of solubility is

 
 

used, the salt flow rate through the pump bowl is 36
gpm (2.3 X 10”® m?/s). Since both values are within
reasonable limits, the solubility of hydrogen cannot
be defined more precisely from these data.

A similar analysis of the data for combined tritium

-(hydrogen) in the off-gas indicates a hydrogen partial

pressure of 8.3 Pa (62 um Hg) in the gas phase,
assuming ideal-gas behavior and one atom of tritium
or hydrogen per molecule of compound. If this value
represents equilibrium between the liquid and gas
phases, the solubility coefficient for the water-soluble

hydrogen form is 1.7 X 10 atm (molecule/cm®

salt)”. This is close to the value of 1.1 X 107
estimated for the solubility of HF, which is one
possible form of the water-soluble compound.

The apparent rate of hydrogen permeation
through the loop walls, based on the observed tritium
concentration in the loop cooling duct, is between 0.7
and 2.7 X 10 ¢cm*STP)/m?:s. If the hydrogen
partial pressure in the saltis0.43 Pa, this rate requires
the effective permeability of the loop piping to be
between 10 and 50 times lower than that of bare
metal. A reduction of this magnitude would be
consistent with the presence of an oxide film on the
exterior metal surfaces.

Based on the measured concentration of water-
soluble tritium in the salt (700 nCi/g) and the
measured partial presure of elemental hydrogen (0.43
Pa), the ratio of the concentration of total hydrogen
in the water-soluble (combined) form to that in the
elemental form is ~4700. If this concentration ratio
were established in the coolant salt of an MSBR and
for the following conditions:

1. removal of combined tritium from a 109 salt
bypass stream (8000 gpm) with 80% efficiency;
2. no sorption of HT or TF on the core graphite;

3. reference value of 107 for the U**/ U™ ratio in the
pnmary salt; :

4. bare-metal permeablllty for the steam tubes (no
-oxide film);

about 3.5 Ci/day (1.5 MBq/s) of tritium would enter
the steam system and be released to the environment.

- This release rate of tritium to the environment would
~ be within the range of release rates from pressurized-

water reactors (PWRs) currently operating. The
release rate of tritium for the MSBR includes the
entire fuel cycle, while that for PWRs would be about
80 Ci/ day if releases associated with fuel reprocessing
were included. '

1.2 NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS

H.T. Kerr ° E.J. Allen D. L. Reed

The neutronic analysis efforts during this reporting
period have focused primarily on the processing of
cross section data for MSBR performance evalua-
tions and for investigation of specific related
problems. Some work has been done in support of in-
reactor irradiation experiments.

1.2.1 Cross Section Processing
for MSBR Calculations

Neutron cross sections from the ENDF/B-IV data
files* have been processed to form a 123-energy-
group library with thermal scattering matrices for
tempe-atures ranging from 300 K to 1200 K. This
libraty includes all nuclides of interest to the MSR
program and will serve as a data base for all
subsequent neutronics analyses. In addition to the
ENDF/B-IV data, graphite cross sections obtained
from General Atomics Company have been in-
cluded.’ The cross section data available in this base
library must be further processed for each unique
application. Significant changes in the fuel salt
composition or in the fuel-moderator cell design can
strongly influence the effective cross sections,
particularly for strong absorbers such as **’Th.

The core of the reference design MSBR is divided
into two major zones." Zone I is characterized by
approximately 13 vol % fuel salt, and Zone II is
characterized by approximately 37 vol % fuel salt.
Each of these two major zones contains two unique
fuel-moderator cell designs (Fig. 1.5). The cylindrical -
equivalent of each cell design is also shown.
Neutronic calculations based on one-dimensional
neutron transport theory were done for each
cylindrical cell to produce cell-averaged 123-energy-
group neutron cross sections for the salt constituents
in each fuel channel and for the graphite. Spectrum-
averaged capture and fission cross sections for some

‘isotopes are summarized (Table 1.1); the strong

dependence on fuel channel dimensions is apparent.
However, volume averaging the cross sections for
both fuel channels in cells having the same total fuel
salt fraction gives total cell-averaged cross sections
that are not very sensitive to fuel channel dimensions.

. Therefore, cell-averaged cross sections for a nominal

fuel salt composition are primarily dependent upon

_the volume fraction of fuel salt in the cell.

 

*ENDF/B-1V is the Evaluated Nuclear Data File, Version IV,
and is the national reference set of evaluated cross-section data.

As originally conceived, the cell-weighted cross
sections previously described were to be used in a
123-group one-dimensional transport theory calcula-
tion of an MSBR. Neutron energy spectra produced
in this calculation were to be used to collapse the

‘isotopic cross sections in each core zone into a few
groups (nominally 9) of a form suitable for
multidimensional performance calculations. How-
ever, considerable delays have been encountered with

~ the transport calculation in the AMPX code.* First,
several program errors -were discovered which
necessitated re-running all the cell calculations. Then
the observation was made that the calculated radial
flux profiles in the one-dimensional reactor model,
particularly in the reflector and reactor-vessel
regions, were strongly dependent on the initial flux
guess used to start the iterative procedure. This
unacceptable situation results from the use of

convergence criteria in AMPX which are not suitable -

for one-dimensional reactor flux calculations in

regions having very low neutron source densities.

Program modifications are being made to incorpo-
rate suitable convergence criteria, and alternate
computational schemes are being considered.

'1.2.2 MSBR Peiformanoe_'Calculations

Multidimensional performance calculations for
the reference design MSBR require collapsed, few-
group cross-section data for each zone of the reactor.
However, for the reasons previously given (Sect.
1.2.1), the appropriate cross sections are not

available. This fact and the planned termination of
the MSR Program at the end of FY 1976 will -
preclude completion of the performance calcula-
tions. .

1.2.3 Helium Production in
the MSBR Vessel

The mechanisms for helium generation from nickel
in Hastelloy N (ref. 5) are: (1) thermal-neutron
capture in **Ni followed by thermal (n,a) reactions in
the product *Ni and (2) direct, high-energy (n,a)
reactions in *Ni. At moderate neutron fluences

. (below about 10** neutrons/cm® with the nominal

neutron energy spectrum expected in the MSBR

~ vessel), the concentration of helium in Hastelioy N

due to the two-step, thermal process is adequately
represented by

Hen(l‘)-'= l =2 (@M‘)2 *

‘where N is the atom fraction of **Ni in the alloy, o1 is

the effective, spectrum-averaged c¢ross section for
**Ni(n1,%)"Ni reaction, o is the effective spectrum-
averaged cross section for *Ni(n,a)**Fe reaction, qb is
the total neutron flux, and ¢ 1s time.

 

*At very high ncutron fluences, the helium concentration is
lower than this equation indicates because burnup of **Ni causesa
reduction in the rate of production of *Ni and the *Ni
concentration approaches an equilibrium value.

 
 

 

The dependence on the square of the fluence results
from the fact that the intermediate nuclide, >’Ni, must
be generated by neutron captures: The comparable

approximation for helium concentration due to the -

high-energy, (n,a) process is

He,(t) =Nos ¢t ,

10

where o; is the effective, spectrum-average'd Cross

section **Ni(n,a)*’Fe reaction.

The ratio of these two concentratlons is a linear
function of fluence. Thus the high-energy process is
the dominant source of helium at low fluences, and
the two-step thermal process becomes dominant at
higher fluences. These relations also indicate that
changing the neutron flux spectrum (e.g., reduction

of the thermal component) would change the relative

importance of the two processes, as well as the total

helium concentration that would be generated in a.

given time period.

‘Cross sections for the *Ni(n,7) reaction are fairly
well known, and available information for the
**Ni(n,a) cross sections indicates that a value of 13 b
(13 X 10 m? at 2200 m/sec is reasonable. The
neutron fluxes in an MSBR have been calculated
with several different computational models and are
generally in good agreement for the fueled regions of
the reactor. However, calculating neutron fluxes in
the reactor vessel is a particularly difficult problem
because the codes avdilable for the source-type
problems are not designed for neutron flux conver-
gence inzones of low nuclear importance. A 20-group
S transport calculauon with special convergence
criteria was done.

' By combining the available cross-section data for

nickel with neutron fluxes from this calculation

estimates were made for the amount of helium
generated in the reactor vessel during the reactor
lifetime. The spectrum-weighted cross sections and
flux information used to estimate the helium
concentration at the inside wall are summarized
(Table 1.2). Using these values, calculated maximum
helium concentration in the vessel is 38 ppm.* About
90% of the higher concentration is associated with the
two-step thermal process discussed above.

- Although some uncertainty exists in the helium
concentration calculated at the inner surface of the
vessel, the calculated flux has a steep radial gradient

 

*Neutron captures in boron, Wthh may be present at low ppm
levels as a trace contaminant in the alloy, would add a small
amount to these concentrations.

helium concentration by a factor of about five for
each centimeter of penetration into the vessel wall.
Thus the concentration of helium in the Hastelloy N
vessel wall appears to be acceptably Tow.

124 Production of **U in the MSBR

".Uranium-232 has a decay chain that approaches
equilibrium over a several-year period; the nuclides
in this chain emit high-energy=alpha particles and
gamma rays. The alpha particles, in turn, may react
with other nuclides to produce neutrons. As a result,
shielding and handling costs of reactor fuels increase
as the 22U content increases. Increasing the content
of 22U in fuels of conventional reactors for which
reprocessing and refabrication are required raises the
cost by which these processes are performed and
lowers the value of the discharged fuel. In the absence
of light nuclides which can undergo (a,n) reactions,
the principal radiations from the standpoint of
shielding are the 2.6-MeV gamma from **T1and the

 
 

Non =
22 _ 05¢fh5,

 

 

 

2.2-MeV gamma from *'’Bi. However, in the presence
of light nuclides (e.g., F, Be, and Li), as may be the
case for MSBR fuel, a significant neutron source
would also be present.

The *U productionin the reference des1gn MSBR
was examined to determine the concentration of **U
that would be present in the MSBR. Decay of **U is
not a direct problem for fuel used in the MSBR
(because no fabrication is required), but the content
of this isotope in excess bred fuel could affect
handling and shipping costs. The five processes by
which **U can be produced are

. yan

For the 2Th:U ratios (~56) expected in the
MSBR, the (n,2n) reaction in **Th is more important.
than the (n,2n) reaction in ***U. However, removal of
the protactinium isotopes by fuel processing on a 10-
day cycle greatly reduces the production of ***U from-
*Th reactions. Asa consequence, the net production
rates of U from the two (n,2n) processes may be
comparable in an MSBR. =

Solution of this expression for the reference design
1000 MW(e) MSBR with a ten-day processing cycle
for protactinium removal and no >°Th leads to an
equilibrium concentration of 20 ppm for 2y in total
uranium. Of this amount, 27% is produced by
reactions in ***U. The *?U source from ***Th would
about equal the combined source from >**Thand **U
at a concentration of 23 ppm **Th in thorium.
Thorium-230, which is a decay product of **U, is
present to about 17 ppm in natural uranium. Thus, if
* the thorium to be used in a reactor is obtained from

mineral deposits that also contain uranium, such
thorium could contain a significant amount of 2*°Th.
The Th:U ratio in Monazite sands, a major thorium
resource, is typically about 20. Hence, thorium from
such depos1ts could be expected to contain only
about 1 ppm *°Th—an insignificant concentration
from the standpoint of **U production. However, in
the absence of a large thorium industry, initial
demands for thorium conceivably could be met by
material recovered from uranium mill tailings, where
the Th:U ratio in the raw ore could have been 0.2 or
less. (The uranium ores at Blind River in Canada, for
example, have Th:U ratios of about 0.2.) Hence the
2°Th content could exceed 100 ppm, which would
raise the equilibrium ?*?U concentration to about 107
ppm in total uranium in an MSBR.

1.2.5 Neutronic Analyses
of TeGen Experiments

The neutronic analysis for the TeGen experiments,
as descnbed in the previous semiannual progress
" report,” was based primarily on a flux mapping
experiment in the ORR poolside and on flux
monitors included in the TeGen-1 experiment. Flux
monitors have now been loaded into the TeGen-2 and
TeGen-3 capsules and will provide additional data
for characterizing the TeGen experiments.

The flux monitors in both TeGen-2 and TeGen-3
are identical and consist of two natural iron wires and
two vanadium—cobalt (0.215 wt %) wires. One wire of
each type is placed on the side of the fuel specimen
toward the reactor core, and the other wire of each
type is placed on the side away from the reactor core.
The iron wires are 343 mm long and extend along the
entire length of the fuel pin region. The vanadium-
cobalt wires are 76 mm long and are located only
along the middle fuel pin.

The flux monitors have been recovered from the.

are currently necessary, are required to show that
code requirements are met. Analytical investigations
to extend the range over which simplified ratchetting
and creep-fatigue rules may be used to show
compliance with code requirements are being made
under the ORNL High-Temperature Structural
Design Program, which is supported in part by the
MSR Program. Modeling procedures for applying
the simplified ratchetting rules to geometries and
loadings prototypic of those encountered in LMFBR
component designs are to be identified. Then the
conservative applicability of these ratchetting rules
and procedures and of elastic creep-fatigue rules will
be demonstrated and placed on a reasonably sound
engineering basis. Finally, an assessment will be
made of the applicability of the simplified design
methods to Hastelloy N under MSBR design
conditions, and the importance of thermal ratchet-
ting in an MSBR will be determined.

The detailed plans for achieving the stated
objectives were ngen in a previous progress report.’
The basic approach is to perform a relatively small
number of carefully planned and coordinated
rigorous elastic-plastic-creep ratchetting-type anal-
yses of several geometries. Each geometry is
subjected to the axial, bending, thermal-transient,
and pressure loadings described in Table 1.7 of ref. 9.
Several two-dimensional cylindrical shell problems
are being analyzed at ORNL using the PLACRE
computer program,’® while three-dimensional
nozzle-to-shell problems are being analyzed by
Atomics International and Combustion Engineering
using the MARC computer program.* Each inelastic
analysis will include a complete code evaluation for
accuraulated strains and creep-fatigue damage. Also
associated with each inelastic analysis are a number
of elastic analyses to provide the input parameters

‘required to apply the various simplified ratchetting -

rules and procedures and elastic creep-fatigue rules.

The inelastic analysis results for the nine axisym-
metrical shell cases have been tabulated and

compared with the results of the Code Case 1592-3 -

elastic creep-fatigue rules. The elastic rules were
found to be conservative in all cases for combined
creep-fatigue, but the creep damage components
were not conservative for the notched cylinder and
the stepped cylinder, compared to the predictions of
the inelastic rules. One-dimensional inelastic anal-
yses simulating various locations in the shells are now
being performed.

Both of the three-dimensional 1ne1ast1c analyses of
nozzle-to-shell configurations are under way again
after various problems, including cost overruns,
temporarily stopped the work. Combustion
Engineering has completed an analysis of three of the
five thermal downshocks to be applied to the nozzle-
to-cylinder configuration, and Atomics International
is approximately halfway through the analysis of the
one thermal downshock to be applied to the nozzle-
to-spherical shell configuration.

1.3.1 Circular Cylindrical Shells*

Results for the nine circular cylindrical shell cases
of this study have now been tabulated, and the results
of Code Case 1592-3 elastic rules have been
compared with the inelastic results. The elastic
fatigue damage rules have been found to be
conservative in all cases studied. Both the elastic
ratchetting rules and the elastic creep-damage rules
have been found to be nonconservative in some cases.
There are two types of geometries in which

nonconservatism has arisen—at a notch in a pipe wall

and in the thick-walled portion of a shell mvolvmg a
stepped-wall thickness.

Work is now under way to carry out one-
dimensional inelastic analyses simulating various
locations in the nine circular cylindrical shell cases. It
is expected that these simulations will throw further
light on the nonconservatism found.

1.3.2 Nozzle-to-Spherical Shell Attachment?

The project on three-dimensional inelastic analysis
of a nozzle-to-spherical shell attachment was
discontinued for approximately five months because
of funding problems associated with computer costs.
It was reactivated early in November, but the scope
has been reduced from a five-cycle to a one-cycle

inelastic analysis. The elastic thermal stress analysis
and- the full-scale inelastic analysis are now being
continued. .

‘At this tlme 26 thermal load incrementsand 1 zero
load increment have been completed. The tempera-
ture in the entire thin-walled nozzle section of the

“attachment reached 427° C(800° F) at the twenty-first

increment. The maximum temperature in the
structure at the twenty-sixth increment is 576°C
(1036°F). There are approximately six more incre-
ments to complete the thermal down-transient.
Problems associated with the number of increments
which could be submitted at one time, computer
hardware and system problems, and problems
associated with the error messages in the MARC
program have slowed the rate of analysis, but these
problems have been resolved.

1.3.3 Nozzle-to-Cylinder Intersection?

This investigation involves a detailed inelastic
analysis (elastic-plastic and creep analysis) of a
nozzle-to-cylinder intersection. The geometry of the
intersection is that of the primary inlet nozzle of the
intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) for the fast-flux

- test facility (FFTF).

Cyclic thermal and mechanical loading will be
repeated until the strain-stress history shows a
repetitive pattern or steady-state response. A
maximum of five cycles will be done. The inelastic
analysis has been performed for the first three cycles.

1.3.4 Inelastic Analyses of MSR
Piping Subjected to Internal
Pressure and Transient
Temperature Cycles

The temperature histograms for two of the most
severe thermal transients that might occur in an
MSBR have been obtained to serve as a basis for
evaluating the magnitude of thermal ratchetting and
creep-fatigue damage that might be expected. One of
the transients results from a 60% decrease in load
demand from full power operation in just 3 sec. The
maximum thermal downshock rate during this event
is only 3.3°C/sec (5.9°F/sec), and 120 such events
might occur over a 30-year life. The other event
considered is a control-rod scram, which resultsin a
maximum thermal downshock rate of 19.3°C/sec
(34.7°F/ sec). This rather severe transient is expected
to occur no more often than once each year.

Creep-rupture data and creep curves for Hastelloy
N at 593, 704, and 816°C (1100, 1300, and 1500°F)
have also been obtained. When cyclic stress-strain
data are obtained for Hastelloy N, solution of the

14

sample problems will proceed. Results from the

sample problems will be examined to determine
whether thermal ratchetting and/or creep-fatigue
damage will be significant problems-in an MSBR.

2.1 GAS-SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY FACILITY
R. H. Guymon

The Gas-Systems Technology F acility (GSTF ) was
operated for a short time during this period to obtain
more information on the salt pump problems.
Previous tests had indicated that the pump shaft
oscillations might be reduced if the operating speed
was not close to the critical speed.' This could be -
accomplished by using a larger impeller and
operating at lower speeds. Therefore a 330-mm-diam
impeller was finish-machined from an existing
casting to replace the old 298-mm-diam impeller.
Back vanes were also installed on the upper surface to
reduce the fountain flow. After final balancing and
installation of the pump rotary element, the loop was
refilled with water and testing was resumed on
October 2, 1975, This impeller developed the desired
loop flow rate at significantly lower speed (Table 2.1).

The amplitudes of the shaft oscillations were
smaller with the larger impeller, but the deflections
were greater. At 1509 rpm with the 330-mm-diam
impeller, the deflections varied between 1.5 and 2.2
mm fromi run to run and at times showed definite
signs that the rotary element was rubbing against
stationary parts. The reasons for the variations under
apparently identical conditions are not known. The
deflections are high because of the performance
mismatch between the impeller and the volute. This
mismatch resulted from pump design modifications
made in an effort to use an existing pump.?

_ The operating characteristics of an MSRE coolant
pump would be satisfactory for the present require-
ments of this loop, and the shaft oscillations and
deflections should be low. Therefore, consideration
was given to converting the Mark 1l pump into a
coolant pump. This could be accomplished by
installing an available coolant-pump volute in the
Mark Il bowl and using a coolant-pump impeller.
The bow] could also be shortened so that an existing
. short-shaft rotary element could be used. The cost of
these modifications was estimated at $104,000.

The effectiveness of the impeller back vanes in
reducing the fountain flow was determined.* With no
- gas flow to the bubble generator, the rate of off-gas
flow from the bubble separator was about ! liter/ min
when the water level was below the centerline of the
pump volute and a few tenths of a liter/ min at levels

about 100 mm above the centerline of the volute. This
was thought to be due to a reverse fountain flow
injecting gas from the pump bowl into the loop,and it
would indicate that the impeller back vanes are too
long. The water flow rate in the fountain area was
0.38 m’/min at a pump speed of 1500 rpm, based on
gas-flow material balances in the pump tank.
However, these tests do not provide information to
differentiate between fountain flow and reverse
fountain flow. Operation at lower pump speeds gave
a lower fountain flow rate. This would be expected
for normal fountain flow because of the lower head
developed. However, changing the speed could also
affect the reverse fountain flow by changing the ratio
of the pumping efficiency of the back vanes to that of

" the main impeller vanes. It might be possible to

determine whether the flow is normal fountain flow
or reverse fountain flow by running tests at different
heads but at the same salt-pump speed or at dxfferent
liquid levels in the pump tank.

Work restarted on fabrication of components
required for salt operation was stopped because of
the planned termination of the MSR Program at the
end of FY [976. The loop has been drained and put in
standby condition, and all records and parts have
been stored. -

2.2 COOLANT SALT TECHNOLOGY
FACILITY

A. N. Smith

A third transient tritium addition test was
completed by the end of October 1975. The loop was
then shut down to (1) install a probe to measure the
partial pressure of hydrogen in the circulating salt, (2)
revise the off-gas sample system, and (3) install a
cooling-air sample system to measure pipe-wall
permeation. Operation of the loop was resumed on
January 16, 1976, and a steady-state tritium addition
test was started on February 3, 1976. At the end of the
report period, the steady-state test was still under
way, and work on the fabrication of a second
hydrogen addition tube had been started. The first
tube, now in service, developed a leak, which makes it
unsuitable for use in subsequent planned tests. The
data accumulated thus far indicate that improvement
is still needed in both the salt and air sampling
procedures; efforts are being directed toward this
end.

2.2.1 Loop Operation

The loop was in operation at the beginning of the
report period, and operation continued until Novem-
ber 4, 1975, when the system was shut down to make
equipment changes related to the tritium tests (Sect.
2.2.3). Operation was resumed on January 16, 1976,
and continued throughout the remainder of the
report period at 540°C with other basic loop
operating conditions described previously.” The
operating experience with the off-gas cold trap
continues to agree with the previous experience.’ The
off-gas system has operated without any sign of
plugging, indicating that the salt mist filter’ is
effective. As of 0800 on February 29, 1976, the loop
had accumulated 5673 hr of salt circulating time since
being reactivated in December 1974.

2.2.2 Tritium Tests

A third transient tritium addition test (Test No.
T3), similar to those described previously,® was
started on September 16, 1975. Data for calculation
of the amount of added gas are shown (Table 2.2).
The tritium concentration in the salt declined to
about background levels approximately 300 hr after
the addition was stopped, and the concentrations in
the loop off-gas continued to decline for several more
days. A few additional salt and off-gas samples were
obtained during the next four weeks while experi-
ments were performed to determine the nature of the
planned system modifications. The analyses of these
samples showed no significant changes from earlier
results. The CSTF was then shut down on November
4, 1975, to make the modifications.

On January 27, 1976, an attempt was made to start
a steady-state tritium addition test by pressurizing
the tritium addition tube to an absolute pressure of
550 kPa. The test was discontinued when it was noted
that the bypass into the vacuum annulus surrounding
the tritium addition tube was about 1400 times higher
than the rate which had been observed during the
previous tritium tests. Under these conditions, the
hydrogen bypass rate was about 14 times hlgher than

the planned rate of input into the salt (84 cm’/ hr vs 6
cm’/hr). Tests indicated that the bypass rate
decreased rapidly with addition tube pressure,and at
an absolute pressure of 35 kPa, the leak rate was
about the same magnitude as the permeation rate
into the salt. A bypass rate of this size would be
tolerable; so the steady-state test was started on
February 3, 1976, with a nominal absolute pressure in
the tritium addition tube of 35 kPa.

The basic plan for the steady-state test is to add
tritiated hydrogen to the circulating salt at a
relatively constant rate long enough for the tritium
concentration in the salt and the rate of transfer of
tritium to the two sinks (off-gas and permeation

-used, and various schemes are being considered
. for increasing the tritium concentration, such as

reducing the cooling-air flow and raising the
. concentration of tritium in the addition gas.

6. The data from the hydrogen partial-pressure
probe indicate that the partial pressure of
elemental hydrogen in the salt is quite low (less
than 10 um Hg), which is generally in agreement
with the low concentration of tritium found in the
cooling-air samples and also with the concentra-
tions of elemental tritium found in the off-gas
samples. Plans are being made to verify the
hydrogen pressure probe readings by usmg a
,mass-spectrometer leak detector machine.

Test results are discussed in Sect. 1.1.3.

At the end of the report period, the tritium levelsin
the salt, off-gas, and cooling air appeared to be at
steady state. The plan is to continue the test long
enough to examine various schemes for improving or
verifying the data for tritium concentration in the
cooling air and in the salt and to provide better
estimates of the tritium material balance, trapping
efficiency, and mass-transfer processes. In the
meantime, a new tritium addition tube is being
fabricated for subsequent tests. These will be
designed to show variations in trapping efficiency as
a function of the gas addition rate and the presence of
chemical additives in the salt.

2.2.3 Equipment Modifications

During the loop shutdown beginning November4,
1975, the test equipment was changed to improve the
quality of the data and to provide additional data.
The following is a summary of the changes:

1. Hydrogen Pressure Probe. A probe was

- inserted in the main salt stream at a point about 1.25

m downstream from the salt pump discharge to
measure the partial pressure of elemental hydrogenin

the salt. The probe consisted of a sealed Hastelloy N

tube, 12.7 mm OD X 1.1 mm wall, connected to the
necessary valving and instrumentation to permit
pressure readings inside the probe in the range of 0.01

to 100 Pa (0.1 to 1000 um Hg). Since this probe is

completely submerged in salt, its response should
depend only on conditions in the salt. ,
2. Off-Gas Sample System. Several changes were
made for the purpose of improving the reliability of
the sample system and the quality of the sample data:
(a) A salt mist filter was fabricated from porous
copper sheet (made from pressed and sintered copper

18

powder) with a porosity of 0.23 and.a pore hydraulic
radius of 6.0 um. The filter, housed in a Hastelloy N
body, was installed at the inlet to the gas sample line
with a heater and insulation to permit operation at
540° C and was oriented such that trapped salt could
drain back to the off-gas line. (b) A 3-way Monel
valve was installed in place of the 3-way glass
stopcock immediately upstream of the first tritium
pretrap. The glass unit had some leakage and
condensation of fluid and also. was not suited for
operation at the higher temperature now being used.
(c) The temperature of the gas sample line from the
salt mist filter to the inlet to the first tritium pretrap
was increased from 150 to 200°C. This change wasto
minimize the condensation of fluids in the gas sample
line. Such fluids, collected in the sample lines, were
probably partly responsible for some earlier erratic
sample results.

3. Exhaust-Air Sample System. Equlpment was
installed for collecting samples that can be used to
estimate the rate at which tritium is being lost due to
permeation through the loop pipe walls. A sample
tap was installed in the air line coming from the lower
loop cooling duct (Fig. 2.2); this tap was connected to
a diaphragm pump that circulates sample gasat a rate
of about 1700 cm®/min and vents the gas into the

loop enclosure. At the pump discharge, where the

pressure is controlled at an absolute pressure of 140
kPa, a 100 cm’/min side stream is taken off for
tntlum trapping. The sample stream is mixed with 20
cm’/min of humidified helium, and the combined
streams are passed through a CuO furnace to convert
the tritium to tritiated water and then through a
water trap and a cold trap to collect the tritiated
water. The tritium content is determined by scintilla-
tion counting in a manner similar to that used for the
off-gas samples. The air intakes to the lower cooling
duct were extended so that the air is drawn from
outside the loop enclosure, thus avoiding contamina-
tion of the air samples by extraneous tritium which
might be in the enclosure. The flow of air through the
cooling duct is determined by sampling the air stream
while adding a known flow of tritium to the air inlet.

In the original design of the tritium addition
system, a vacuum pump maintained a low pressure
(less than 75 Pa) in the vacuum annulus surrounding
the addition tube. The discharge gas from the
vacuum pump was vented into the loop enclosure and
was eventually discharged to the stack along with the

- loop ventilation air. Thus the air exhausted from the

loop enclosure normally contained a small amount of
trittum from the vacuum annulus in addition to the

 tritium that permeated through the loop pipe walls.

specimens were exposed to fuel salt at typical MSBR
operating temperatures. During the test, 18 corrosion
specimens were exposed to salt at velocities up to 3
m/sec at three different temperature levels—565,
635, and 705°C. As expected, corrosion rates were
low throughout the test period and <3 um/year (0.1
mil/year) during the final 1000-hr increment of the
test. A detailed discussion of the corrosion results is
presented under Salt Corrosion Studies (Sect. 6.6).

On October 6, a series of NiF; additions to the loop

salt was begun to increase the U*/U* ratio. It was

planned to increase the U**/ U ratio from the earlier
equilibrium value of about 100 to a new level of about
1000 and then to evaluate corrosion rates at the
higher level, which reflects a more oxidizing
condition in the salt. The NiF; was added by
dropping small pellets of NiF-fuel carrier salt (50-50
wt %) from a sealed air lock, via a ball valve and riser
pipe, to the fuel-salt surface within the auxiliary
pump tank. During the additions, the loop was
operated isothermally at ~695° C with a pump speed
of 4000 rpm to provide a salt flow rate of about 12

liters/ min. Four separate additions of 0.8 g of NiF:

were made between October 6 and October 21,

followed by a final addition of 1.6 g on November 3, -

1975 (4.8 g total addition to the 14-kg salt inventory).
The work was interrupted at this time by operational
problems, but the limited observations made are
described below. '

The effects of NiF; additions were similar to those
observed in September and October 1974, when fine
NiF; powder was added to the salt inventory of FCL.-
2b. Immediate pump-power increases of 8 to 10%
were again noted with each 0.8-g addition. The salt
level in the auxiliary tank decreased with each NiF;
addition, which suggests that NiF, affected the salt
surface tensionand may have thereby reduced helium
ingassing in the pump bowl. During the first four
NiF; additions of 0.8 g each, the salt level dropped
about 1’ mm immediately after each addition. A
1';mm level change represents an apparent salt
density increase of about 1%; therefore, density
change of the pumped salt should account for only
about one-tenth of the pump-power increases noted,
and the remaining power increase is believed to be
due to increased drag forces on the pump impeller.
The final addition of 1.6 g of NiF; resulted in a 14%
increase in pump power and a larger-than-expected
level drop of 12 mm at the auxiliary tank.

Each NiF. addition to the salt resulted in an

immediate increase in the U*/U* ratio, which

reached a maximum in a few hours, followed by
asymptotic decay; e.g., the first addition increased

20

~ the ratio from ~ 100 to >>1000, but after three days of

isothermal operation at 695°C, the ratio had
decreased to 130. Similarly, the fourth addition
increased the ratio from ~250 to 10,000, but it had

“dropped to 200 after eight days. Just prior to the final

1.6-g NiF; addition on November 3, the U*'/ U** ratio
was 150. Two hours after the 1.6-gaddition, the ratio
was 2.6 X 10*, and a day later the ratio had fallen to
4.8 X 10°. No further readings were obtained because
of a salt leak in the piping system which occurred on
November 5, 1975. The plan to run a corrosion testat
a high U*/U* ratio was abandoned at this time.
The loop did not accumulate any significant

~ operating time between November 5, 1975, and

February 18, 1976, because of salt leaks that occurred
on November 5 and December 10, 1975. Both leaks
resulted from tube ruptures during reheating opera-
tions immediately after transfer from AT to isother-
mal operation of the loop.

Salt freezing had always occurred in the coolers of
FCL-2b after a loop scram* because of the large mass
of air-cooled metal within the cooler housingand the
relatively small mass of hot salt withih the cooler
coils. This had not caused significant problems
during the past 20,000 hr of operation, other than
delaying resumption of salt circulation for a few
hours while gradual remelting occurred. However, in
each of the two recent shutdowns where leakage
occurred, salt froze in another portion of the loop not
monitored by a thermocouple, in addition to the
known freezing in the coolers. Since the second
frozen area was not apparent to the operators during
either incident, normal operating and remelting
procedures were followed which resulted in salt
liquid expansion and pipe rupture between the frozen
coolers and the unsuspected salt plug.

The salt leak of November 5, 1975, occurred in a
resistance-heated section of the loop piping (PR
heater No. 2). The location and cause of the frozen
area which precipitated this failure are not definitely
known, but the cold spot was probably at metallurgi-

cal station No. 2. The salt leak of December 10, 1975,

occurred at metallurgical station No. 3, where an
adapter (for line S08) is saddle-welded to 19-mm-OD
X 1.8-mm-wall tubing. The cause of the frozen area
related to this leak was a 10-cm-long uninsulated
portion of a salt drain line (S-112). Insulating this
portion of line had been overlooked during prior

procedure, which stopped the pump. This provides
more heat energy to the cooled metal within the
cooler housing via the flowing salt. Also, the cooler
housing was modified by adding internal thermal
insulation and electric heaters to reduce the mass of
cold metal to which the salt-containing cooler coil
can transfer heat. Thirdly, an automatic solenoid
valve was added to turn off auxiliary cooling air to
the resistance-heating lugs on the main heaters aftera
scram or whenever the main heaters are deactivated.

Piping replacement and modification were neces-
sary after each of the two incidents of salt leakage.

corrosion specimens were installed in the three

After the specimens were inserted, the loop was
operated isothermally at about 700°C over the
weekend and was brought to design AT conditions on
February 23. Operation is continuing, and removal
of the corrosion specimens for their first examination
is planned after 500 hr of AT operation.

lines were replaced with 9.5-mm-OD lines because

the original lines were too small and had hampered
operation and repair functions. A néw, larger
standard Hastelloy N fill-and-drain tank was also
installed because the original tank had a marginal
capacity.

The loop repairs and modifications were com-
pleted in February 1976, and 20.25 kg of new fuel salt
mixture was transferred to the new Hastelloy N drain
tank. The salt was sampled after transfer into the
drain tank, and impurity levels were found to be low,
which indicated that the new salt was in good
condition. ,

The loop piping was filled with salt on February
- 18. After the salt circulated isothermally for 3 hr, the

oxidation potential of the salt was measured

electrochemically and found to correspond to a
U*/U* ratio of about 4600. The U*/U* ratio
dropped rapidly, as had been the previous experi-
ence, and decreased to a value of about 500 after two
days’ operation at design conditions and full AT.
A scram test from AT operation was imade to verify

that the recent design modifications would prevent

salt from freezing in the coolers. The test was
successful and showed that the original scram circuits
functioned and that the newly added automatic
features worked as planned; that is, the pump speed
reduced from 4000 to 2000 rpm, the guard heaters on

16-12-0.3 mole %) was measured in one of the
resistance-heated sections of MSR-FCL-2b. Heat
transfer data were obtained over the following range
of variables: Reynolds moduli, 1540 to 14, 200;
Prandtl modauli, 6.6 to 14.2; heat fluxes, 142 to 630
kW/m? salt velocities, 0.5 to 2.5 m/sec; and fluid
temperatures, 549 to 765°C.

Fllm coefficients ranged from 1.32 to 11.8
kW/m?*K at Nusselt moduli of 11 to 102. There was
satisfactory agreement with the empirical Sieder-
Tate correlation’ in the turbulent region at Reynolds
moduli from ~8000 to 14,200 (Fig. 2.3). Between
Reynolds moduli of ~2100 and 8000, the experimen-
tal data follow a modified Hausen equation,® which is
normally applicable to the transition region between
laminar and turbulent flow. The extended transition -
region is probably due to the high viscosity and large
negative temperature coefficient of viscosity of the
fuel salt. Hydrodynamic stability theory predicts the
possibility of such an extension when heat is
transferred from a solid interface to a fluid whose
viscosity decreases with temperature. Insufficient
data were obtained in the laminar flow region to
allow any conclusions to be drawn. The results of
these experiments are snmlar to those obtained in
FCL-2 with coolant salt’ (NaBF -NaF: 92-8 mole %)
and indicate that the proposed fuel salt behavesasa
normal heat transfer fluid.

and FCL-4

All components for FCL-3 and FCL-4 are on hand
except the finned-cooler sections, which were to be
fabricated of titanium-modified Hastelloy N tubing.
Components received during this report period
include the resistance-heater lugs, loop shielding, two
ALPHA-pump bowls, FCL+4 control panels, and
parts for four ALPHA-pump rotary assemblies.
Assembly of the electrical power supply and auxiliary
piping for FCL-3 progressed as far as practical in the
absence of tubing for the salt loop. Assembly work on
FCL-4 electrical power supplies and auxiliary piping
was continued for most of this reporting period.
However, the FCL-4 assembly work has now been

stopped because of the decision to terminate the

MSR Program at the end of FY 1976.

Part 2. Chemistry

L. M. Ferris

Chemical research and development related to the

design of MSBRs have concentrated on fuel- and

coolant-salt systems chemistry and the development
of analytical methods for use in these systems. This
work is presently bemg phased outalong wnth the rest
of the MSR Program.

The chemistry of tellurium in fuel salt has been
emphasized because this element is responsible for
the shallow intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N.
Preliminary measurements of the solubility of Li;Te

that an oxidant such as water vapbr could generate
more soluble and colored species. )

Work on several aspects of coolant-salt chemlstry
was continued. It was shown that Na;B;FsO; is the

~ stable oxygen-containing species in the system NaF-

in molten Li;BeFs; confirmed the expected low

solubility. High-temperature spectroscOpy was used

to study the behavior of tellurium species in molten
'LiF-BeF, mixtures. The results of these studiesare in
agreement with the measured low solubility of Li,Te,
and they show that the soluble species can probably
be represented as Te," Spectroscopy was also used

to determine the equilibrium tellurium pressures for

the reaction 2LiTe; = Li.Te + % Te,, but the method

could not be used for similar studies with nickel and

chromium tellurides because of their very low
dissociation pressures. In other spectroscopic work,
equlllbnum quotients for the reaction UF(d) +
/aHa(g) =
BeF, mixtures and in MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF;-

UF;(d) + HF(g) were determined in LiF-

ThF, (72-16-12 mole %)- The values obtained '

generally are_in agreement with those obtained
_prevmusly by other workers usmg a dxfferent
method.

Electrochemxcal studles of 11th1um tellurldes
. _c_qnf irmed the low solubility of both Li,Te and LiTe;
in LiCI-KC! eutectic at 400°C, but they did indicate

23

NaBF:-B;0; at low oxygen concentrations. This
compound reversibly interconverts with NaBF;OH
in aqueous systems, a situation which is probably
also the case in the coolant salt. Based on this
assumption, a plausible mechanism for trapping
tritium from an MSBR in NaF-NaBF, coolant salt
has been postulated. Vapor density studies of the
system BF;-HO were also continued. It was shown
that BF;-2H,O is completely dissociated in the vapor
phase at temperatures above about 200°C. Below
200° C, association occurs, and a stable llquld phase
can be formed.

Monitoring of U*/U* ratios in several forced-
convection loops, thermal-convection loops, and
creep-test machines was continued. Data were
obtained during the third tritium injection experi-
ment at the CSTF. The results were similar to those
from the first two experiments in that most of the
tritium was found in a water-soluble or combined

form. Electroanalytlcal studies indicated that LiTe; -

and 'Cr;Tes are insoluble in MSBR fuel salt.

-Cathodlzatlon of a tellurium electrode in the

presence ‘of fuel salt apparently produced a species of

- the type Te. . (n = 1), which was unstable under the

experimental conditions. Some evidence for oxide
and/or peroxide species was obtamed in other
electrochem:cal studres

3.1 SOLUBILITY OF LITHIUM TELLURIDES
IN FLUORIDE MELTS

D. Y. Valentine A. D. Kelmers

It has been demonstrated that fission-product
tellurium is the agent responsible for the shallow
intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N surfaces which
was observed in the MSRE.' However, the state or
states in which tellurium is actually present in the
LiF-BeF,-ThFs-UF,(71.7-16-1 2-0.3 mole %) fuel salt
~ under reactor operating conditions remains to be
determined. The hthlum-tellunum system was the
first to be mvesngated The two species that are
known to exist in the Li-Te system, Li;Te and LiTe;,
have been prepared. VLITC‘:‘; undergoes disproportion-
ation to Li;Te and Te quite easily’ and thus does not
lend itself to dynamic solublllty measurements. On
the other hand, Li;Te¢ is quite stable and was used
here to make the first tellurium solubility estlmates
Molten Li;BeF, was used instead of the thorium-
contammg fuel salt since the density of Li;Te (3.4
g/cm ) is similar to the density of the fuel salt (3. 75
g/ cm®). However, Li;BeFs hasa density of 2.2 g/ cm’,
which is probably sufﬁclently different fromLi;Te to
- prevent the suspension of Li;Te partlculates in the

' melt.

The solubility study was carried out in a closed
nickel vessel completely lined with POCO-AXF-5Q
graphite. The various parts are shown before
assembly (Fig. 3.1). Openings in the graphite liner lid
_accomrnodate a thermocouple (TC)well and a sparge
“tube, both Y4-in.-OD, also made from POCO-AXF-
' 5Q graphite. The TC welland sparge tube were joined

to the top of the nickel pot by brazing a tantalum ring

between the graphite and the nickel pot. Design of the
graphite parts and the graphite-Ta-Ni joint was
contributed by H. C. Cook of the Metals and
Ceramics Division. The brazing techniques were
developed by J. F. King of the Welding and Brazing
Laboratory, Metals and Ceramics Division. This
type of joint is reported to withstand temperatures up
to 1150°C.* It has been in continuous use in this
experiment for many weeks over a temperature range
- of 500°C to 800°C without showing signs of failure.
- Two stainless steel ball values welded to the top of
the pot allow samples to be taken with filter sticks.
The filter sticks were also made of POCO-AXF-5Q
graphite. A screw cap on the end of each filter stick

24

holds a graphite frit disk in place.* The pore size of
the frit is about 150 u. The filter stick, frit, and screw
cap are shown in the foreground of Fig. 3.1. Thefilter
stick (%-in~OD, Yie-in.-ID) was found to be

-extremely strong. An enlarged chamber behind the
frit holds the sample. The filter stick is admitted to

the melt through a Teflon sleeve above the ball valves
on the pot top. A Swagelok fitting is used around the
filter stick, allowing it to pass into the pot througha
closely fitting Teflon sleeve. In addition, an over-
pressure of argonis maintained while the filter stick is
being lowered into the melt, assurmg that contamina-
tion of the melt from ingress of air does not occur.

Enriched (95.07%) 122Te was purchased from
Isotope Sales Division, ORNL. Irradiation of this
isotope in the Bulk Shielding Reactor for 48 hr
produced '?"Te having a half-life of 117 days. This
isotope emits a 159-keV gamma ray suitable for
counting with a lithium-drifted germanium detector.
The '*"Te was melted with natural tellurium (purity
99.999+ wt % from Alpha Ventron Products Co.)ina
tungsten crucible. The tracer-labeled tellurium (Te*)
was then used to prepare Li;Te* in the same tungsten
crucible by melting the lithium on the surface of the
Te* and slowly raising the temperature until reaction
occurred. The Li;Te* product was then ground and
sintered to evaporate any excess reactants and
bottled for removal to the counting facility. The
dilution and subsequent preparation of Li;Te* were
carried out in an argon atmosphere vacuum box
equipped with a heater designed especially for use in
vacuum boxes. | o

After the vessel top was welded into place, the
empty vessel was installed in the vacuum-argon
system and heated under vacuum to 800° C to test the
weld joints. The graphite parts had previously been
outgassed at 1000°C for 24 hr under vacuum. The
evacuated vessel was then transferred to the argon
atmosphere box, where it was loaded through the ball
valves with Li;Te* followed by Li;BeF.. The vessel
was then replaced in the argon~vacuum system and
heated while maintaining a 50 cm ?/ min argon sparge
flow. The furnace temperature was controlled by an
Electromax II controller to *1°C. The entire
assembly is shown in Fig. 3.2.

 

*The frit was supplied by J. M. Robbins, Metals and Ceramics
Division.

Samples were taken at temperatures between
500°C and 700°C. No wetting of the graphite by the
salt occurred, and the filter sticks could be withdrawn
smoothly. After a sample had been taken, the filter
stick end cap was unscrewed, the frit removed, and
the body of the filter stick encapsulated under
vacuum in a quartz tube. The tube was then heated in
a furnace to about 750°C, allowing the sample to
flow by gravity into a quartz cup in the bottom of the

 

tube. T he sa_mplé did not adhere to the quartz; so
uniformly shaped sample buttons were produced
which were then weighed and counted.

The 159-keV gamma rays from the '*"Te tracer

‘were detected with a high-resolution lithium-drifted

germanium detector (10% relative efficiency). A

used to acquire the energy spectra and subsequently

few samples were counted at two source-to-detector
distances (0 cm, directly on the detector endcap, and
30.5 cm, a distance at which the photon detection
efficiency was accurately . known from previous
calibrations) to establish the efficiency at closer
geometries. Subsequent samples were counted at 0

branching ratio are supplied to the computer in the
form of an isotope table and are used in the activity
calculation (corrected to any arbitrary reference date
and time). The only correction not automatically
applied by the program is that resulting from self-
absorption in the sample. However, the gamma-ray
attenuationlength? for Li;BeF, isabout 3.6 cmat 159
keV, and since the samples are small (less than 0.5
cm), this correction” does not exceed 10%. -In
addition, the: production of sample buttons of
consistent size and shape facilitated this correction.

solubility below 10~ mole fraction at 700°C. It is
suspected that particulates of Li;Te may have
contaminated the first measurements. The melt has
been examined for possible oxidation, and no
evidence of an oxidized tellurium species was seen.
Samples will continue to be taken until reproducibil-
ity can be achieved, which presumably will indicate
that any particulate settling process has been
completed. The melt will also be exammed for

32 SPECTROSCOPYOF TELLURIDE
" SPECIES IN MOLTEN SALTS
B. F. Hitch L. M. Toth

Spectrophotometric studies of lithium telluridesin
molten salts have continued. Several experiments
involving the addition of tellurium compounds to

LiF-BeF; (66-34 mole %) mixtures have been

conducted using a diamond-windowed graphlte cell.
The primary objectlve of these experiments is to
identify the anionic tellurium species presént in
fluoride melts at 500~700° C which absorb in the 200-
to 2500-nm range.

When Li;Te was equlhbrated with LiF-BeF: melts,
the diamond-windowed cell was used in the conven-
tional manner with the atmosphere above the meltin
contact with the atmosphere inside the furnace.
However, when LiTe; was used as a solute, the entire
cell was encapsulated in quartz and the cell-capsule
assembly was positioned in the furnace such that the
entire unit was isothermal to prevent mass transport
of Te; to the cell walls by the decomposition reaction:

2LiTe; — Li,Te + /zTez(g) - (l)

‘In LiF-BeF; melts, leTe did not show any
absorbance except in one case where a small (0.1

absorbance unit) broad band appeared at approxi- -

mately 470—480 nm. This band disappeared when the
cell was evacuated, indicating that the absorbing
_ species was probably notdue to Li;Te but instead toa
- -species of greater tellurium activity which was
present in Li;Te; that is, the Li;Te was not
stoichiometric and may have contamed a shght
excess of tellurium.

Additions of LiTe; to L1F-Ber mixtures gave a
small band (0.2 absorbance unit) at 450 nm which

.~ remained stable. Previous work in chlorides indi-

cated that maximum absorbance was obtained with
solutions in which the lithium—tellurium stoichiome-
try was approximately one. Thus a Li;Te addition

27

was made to the LiF-BeF; mixture containing LiTe;
which shifted the lithium—telurium stoichiometry to.
45-55 at. %. After the Li;Te addition, a very large
band (2 to 3 absorbance units) at 465 nm was
observed (Fig. 3.3) which remained stable during two
weeks of measurements. The color of the solution
was deep orange. Following these measurements,
enough tellurium metal was added to return the
lithium—tellurium stoichiometry to 25-75 at. %
(LiTe;). The absorbance decreased slightly, but not
to the original 0.2 absorbance unit seen for the melt in
contact with LiTes. The anomalous behavior of LiTe;
may arise from slow kinetics involved in its
equilibration with melts.

These results suggest that the most soluble
tellurium species in LiF-BeF; (66-34 mole %) melts
under isothermal conditions is an ion such as Te;* or
Te. Our work in chloride melts,” the work of
Bamberger et al,® and recent electrochemical
studles7’8 support the interpretation.

Currently, preparations are being made to care-
fully titrate a fluoride melt containing Li;Te with
tellurium metal and to locate the lithium—tellurium

information will establish the stoichiometry of the

solubility and absorption coefficient.

The following tentative conclusions are drawn: (1)
Li;Te does not appear to be soluble in LiF-BeF:
melts, or, if it is soluble, the Te*” ion does not absorb
in the region investigated. (2) The light-absorbing
species present in LiF-BeF; solution (as well as in

Te,” (e.g., Te  or Te;’), based on our titration
measurements. Although solid compounds such as
LiTe or Li;Te; have not been observed in phase
diagram studies,’ the stability of a Te,™ ion in melts

could easily be explained by solvation effects. (3) The -

experimental results have not been sufficiently
consistent to establish that the Te; ion exists in
molten-salt solutions as a light-absorbing species. It
is, nevertheless, reasonable that it should occur as
one of a series of colored ions derived from the Te
ion in the following manner:

Te + Tex; = Tes

3.3 DECOMPOSITION PRESSURE OF LiTe;
B.F. Hitch L. M. Toth

In spite of frequent reference to LiTe; asa source of
tellurium in MSR experimental work,”* no
equilibrium data are available for its decomposition
reaction:

2LiTes ~ Li;Te + % Tex(g) . )

As a result, Te; pressures over LiTes (either solid or
liquid) have been a matter of considerable conjecture.
The relatively high Te, pressures (as indicated by the
characteristic yellow color over LiTes at tempera-
tures greater than 600°C) could be determined for
an isothermal LiTe, system by means of absorp-
tion spectroscopy; a Cary 14-H spectrophotometer
measured the Te; pressure over LiTe; by monitoring
the 4130-A band of Te; vapor.

Approximately 155 mg of LiTe; wasloaded (under
an inert atmosphere) into a shallow tungsten
crucible, which was, in turn, placed in a 1-cm silica
cell, which was evacuated before being sealed off. The

crucible was necessary to prevent attack of the silica
by Li;Te formed during the decomposition. The
absorbance of Te; vapor over molten tellurium metal
was similarly measured; and the absorbances were
related to known vapor pressure data.® This
calibration enabled the conversion of the absorbance
data for Te; over molten LiTes to pressures and also
permitted determination of the molar extinction
coefficient (e = 3232+ 132 £ mole™' cm™") for Te: (Fig.
3.4). The upper curve gives the values for the vapor
pressure of pure tellurium. The equilibrium pressures
of Te; over molten LiTe; are given by the lower curve
and can be represented by the equation In P{mm Hg)
= 15.938 — 12,720/ T\°K). As seen, the pressures of
Te, over molten LiTe; are quite high, being only
about a factor of 1.5 lower than the vapor pressures
for pure tellurium. This technique is applicable only
to tellurides. with similarly high Te; decomposition
pressures; therefore, decomposition pressures of

- chromium and nickel tellurides cannot be measured

spectrophotometrically. -

Earlier measurements by this technique indicated
somewhat lower pressures of Te; over LiTes. The
observed pressures decreased continuously with

prolonged exposure at 700° C with the simultaneous
appearance of silica attack in the vapor space above
the crucible. Since Te; does not attack silica, even at
1050°C, probably one of the lithium tellurides has
some slight volatility at these temperatures. The
experiments reported above were performed at lower
temperatures to avoid this attack.

This study will be concluded with a determination
of the Te; pressure over a solid mixture of Li;Te and
LiTe;, which will provide an equilibrium constant for
Eq. (1). With this constant and the above data for

molten LiTe;, the activity coefficients for Li:Te

mined.

3.4 POROUS ELECTRODE STUDIES IN
MOLTEN SALTS—ELECTROCHEMISTRY
OF TELLURIUM IN THE LiCl-KCl
'EUTECTIC SYSTEM

F. A. Posey |

Our previous studies have established the capabil-
ity of the packed-bed electrode of glassy carbon
spheres for monitoring electroactive species in
molten salts by use of voltage-scanning coulometry
techniques.'' It has been generally established that
intergranular attack and subsequent embrittlement
of the structural material of the MSRE was caused by
fission-produced tellurium. It would therefore be
highly desirable to establish the solubility and the
valence state of tellurium species present.in the
MSBR fuel salt. The complex behavior of tellurium
species derived from the apparent dissolution of
Li.Te and LiTe; in various molten salts has been
amgiyudemonstrated by spectrophotometnc stud-
ies.

An electrochemical study of these tellurides in the

H. R. Bronstein

LiCl-K Cl eutectic was initiated to provide additional

information which would help in the elucidation and
interpretation of the results obtained spectrophoto-
metrically. Of almost immediate impact was the
observation that the addition of Li,Te to the highly
‘purified and dehydrated LiCI-KCl eutectic melt
(400° C) produced no color, as was observed in
previous spectrophotometrlc studies.®*? A volt-
ammetric scan showed no species attributable to the
dissolution of Li;Te. This means that Li;Te is not
soluble in this solvent at 400°C.

Next, LiTe; was added to the melt. No color was
- observed and no trace of soluble tellurium species
‘was detected by volt-ammetry. Again, the conclusion
must be that LiTe; also is not soluble in this solvent at

400° C. Removal of the carbon addition cup revealed
that the LiTe; had decomposed and had deposited
metallic tellurium on the outer surface surrounding
the holes in the cup. In light of the above results, the
decomposition of LiTe; releasing metallic tellurium
can probably be written as

TC3- - TC— + Tez .

Cathodization of an accurately weighed tellurium
electrode produced no color formation around the
electrode. From the coulomb accumulation and
weight loss of the electrode, a sone-electron process
was derived, in agreement with the finding of D. L.
Manning in fluoride melts.® The lack of color on
cathodization 1s also in agreement with that of
Plambeck."”

Our experiments, along with those of Plambeck
have shown that, not only are the lithium tellurides
insoluble in the LiCI-KCl eutectic at 400°C, but also
in highly purified melts the reaction products are not
present which lead to colored solutions.

These colored solutions may be due to interaction
of the tellurides and trace amounts of moisture
present as a contaminant in the melt. To. test this
premise, LiCl-KCl eutectic-Li;Te mixtures were
contaminated with varying quantities of moisture
and melted in sealed quartz tubes. As anticipated, the
tube with the largest contamination of moisture
developed the darkest color, whereas the least
contaminated melt had the lightest color. However, if
true solubility of tellurides should occur in other
melts, colored solutions could arise due to the
presence of polytellunde ions such as those observed
for the polysulfides

(66-34 mole %) and (48-52 mole %). Details of the
procedure have been given previously. 13

‘Since the spectroscopically measured UF;and UF,
concentrations are directly dependent on their molar
extinction coefficients* (e), it was necessary that
accurate values be known for both the uranium ions
in solution. Although e values have already been
reported'® for UF4, no corresponding values exist for
UF; at 360 nm (which is the wave length used to
monitor the UF;). Therefore, the equilibrium study
was interrupted to obtain these data. ,

The reduction of a dilute UF, solution w1th
zirconium metal was found to be the most satisfac-
tory procedure for obtaining UF; excitation coeffi-
cients. By preparing UF, solutions of known
compositionn and reducing all the UF, to UF; with
excess zirconium, an accurate determination of €,
at 360 nm was possible. At the same time, the

presence of trace Zr*' ion (<0.1 M) in solution, either .

as a result of the reduction or intentionally added,
served to getter any trace oxide ion which would
otherwise precipitate UO; and upset the accuracy of
the analysis.

-Surprisingly, solutions of pure UF; were stable up
to 700°C with respect to carbide formation in the
graphite spectrophotometric cell; therefore, it was
possible to perform the calibration on pure UF;
solutions.. Above 700°C, loss of UF; was observed
(with the presumed formation of UC:), and it was
then necessary to extrapolate back to the time where
the instability occurred in order to obtain an estimate
of the absorption coefficients at higher temperatures.
Consequently, the high-temperature calibrationdata
are not as good as those at the lower temperatures.

Values of ess0 apparently decrease somewhat with
increasing temperature, but the magnitude is within
the present experimental error. The average values
for the two solvents LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and
(48-52 mole %) were found to be 1030 (for
500~750°C) and 1155 £ mole™ ¢cm™ (for 400~750°C)
respectively. A discrepancy in the calibration
experiments for the latter solvent led to a rather high
(£10%) error. These experiments will be repeated if
time permits at the end of the H, reduction studies.

Equilibrium quotients at a given temperature were
determined by sparging the system with a fixed
HF/H: gas ratio for a day or more until the UF./ UF;

ratio became constant. This length of time was also -
- necessary to obtain consistent HF analyses from the

furnace inlet and outlet gas streams because of the
very low HF/H; ratios (107 to 10°%) which equili-
brated very slowly with the fumace and gas lines as
well as with the melt.

4.1 HYDROLYTIC BEHAVIOR OF Na;3B3Fs0;
L. Maya

The hydrolytic behavior of Na;B;F¢O; was studied
by means of ’F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and Raman spectroscopy to clarify the possible
mechanisms of the conversion of this species into
hydroxide. The compound Na3;B;FsO; appears to be

the stable oxygen-containing species at relatively low

oxide concentrations (3-15 mole % B:0s) in the
system NaF-NaBF,-B,0O;. These compositions ap-
proach that of the coolant melt, although the latter
contains a lower oxide concentration. This finding is
of significance since tritium trapping by coolant melt

probably involves an equilibrium between oxide and
hydroxide species. A knowledge of the nature of
these species and their chemistry would provide
further understanding of the trapping process.

The Raman spectrum of a 0.66-M solution of
NaiB;3FsO; is given (Fig. 4.1). It was concluded that
the lines at 875 and 760 cm™' were due to H3BOs and
BF;OH resulting from the depolymerization of the
B3FsOs* ion as described by the following sequential
reactions: ' ,

This situation is not surprising since tetraborate is
depolymerized in water into H;BO; and B(OH), .
Hibben' observed such behavior on the basis of
Raman spectra.

The stoichiometry of the depolymerization re-
quired that sodium fluoride, which was not observed
in the Raman spectrum, would be formed. This
suggested that boric acid, sodium fluoride, and
sodium hydroxyfluoroborate that were dissolved in
equivalent proportions should generate the same
spectrum as aqueous Na3;B3;FsOs. This was found to
be the case; furthermore, evaporation of the solution
yielded pure Na3;B3FsO;, as established by elemental
analysis, infrared spectroscopy, alkalimetric titration
and the x-ray powder diffraction pattern. - This

33

experiment proved the reversibility of the equations
described above and gave an alternate and simpler
method of synthesizing the complex salt. In spite of
the apparently straightforward chemistry described
above, closer scrutiny of the Raman spectrum
revealed some inconsistencies. Pure NaBF:;OH
absorbs at 763 cm™', and the 760 cm™' band actually
observed appeared to be asymmetric. A band at 610
cm™' was also detected. The intensity of this band
proved to be temperature dependent, increasing at
lower temperatures. This suggested the presence of
more species than originally assumed. The "F NMR
spectrum (Fig. 4.2) revealed a considerable propor-
tion of species containing an F/B ratio of 2.0. The
spectral evidence indicates that the equilibria

completely to the right and that there are consider-
able amounts of BF(OH), and B:;Fs0;> ions
present. Analysis of the 760 cm™ band with a curve
resolver revealed two components at 763 and 753

cm”', the first being due to BF;OH', as assigned on

the basis of pure NaBF;O0H, and the second due to
BF:(OH),; . This gives an additional point to the
correlation of the v, band frequency of partially
substituted fluoroborates with the degree of substitu-
tion. Thus, BF,™ absorbs at 770 cm™', BF; OH at 763

~cm”', BF2(OH); at 753 cm ', and B(OH), at 745

cm™'. Similarly, analysis of the '"F NMR signal at
—29.6 ppm (& referenced to CsFe) revealed two
signals, one due to BF:(OH) and the other
apparently due to the B;Fs0;”". The presence of
B3F¢0;” is confirmed by the band at 610 cm™ in the
Raman spectrum. This line corresponds to the line at
595 cm™ observed in the spectrum of the solid.

A semiquantitative material balance, based on the

intensities of the ’F NMR and a calibration of the -
B(OH); and NaBF;OH lines in the Raman spectrum,

gives the following approximate distribution for a
solution 2 M in boron prepared by dissolving
equimolar amounts of NaBF;OH, NaF, and H;BOa:

Free fluoride is not shown in the spectrum given in
Fig. 4.2. It absorbs at about —44 ppm and is not
resolved” from BF(OH);; thus, among other
uncertainties, it is a potential source of error in the
material balance.

Having established that Na;B;FsO; and NaBF;OH
interconvert reversibily in the presence of water, it is
possible to assume that a similar mechanism operates
in the melt. This led to the postulation of a number of
plausible reactions which could take place in the melt
involving these species, hydrogen (tritium), and
dissolved metal fluorides.

Evaluation of the constant K; would lead to a
quantitative description of the system. A.more
practical qualitative observation based on this
expression is that tritium trapping will be favored by
relatively high concentrations of oxide and/or metal
fluoride in the salt along with a relatively high value
for the partial pressure of water.

4.2 VAPlOR DENSITY STUDIES IN
THE SYSTEM BF;-H;O

L. Maya S. N. Russell*

In the last report,’ it was stated that dissociation of
BF3:2H,0 is complete at 400°C. The present set of
experiments was aimed at establishing the tempera-
ture threshold at which association or condensation
of the vapor species takes place. These experiments

~ showed that at about 200° C there is a departure from

complete dissociation. This. departure becomes

pronounced at 150°C, and, with increasing amounts
of BF3:2H;O, a stable liquid phase is formed, givinga

saturation vapor pressure which remains constant -

with varying amounts of BF3-2H,0. This behavior

was unexpected, in view of the report’ that BF;2H,O

decomposes upon distillation; however, that work

was done in glass in an open system. This finding led

to a series of experiments to obtain a set of saturation
vapor pressure data at different temperatures (Table

gradual decline and are presently about 1.7 X 10°and
80 respectively. |

Forced convection loop, FCL-2b, has been
charged with new salt and is back in operation aftera
shutdown period. The U**/** ratio is presently of the
order of 5.3 X 10°, which indicates that the melt is
oxidizing. Probably the ratio will decrease rapidly as
the melt comes in contact with new metal surfaces
that have been installed in the loop.

The measurement of U**/ U ratios were initiated
in November on eight creep-test machines located in
Building 2011. Since the initial measurements, the
melts have tended to become more reducing. For
comparison, first measurements and present
U*/U*3 ratios are shown in Table 5.1. Tellurium as

5.2 TRITIUM ADDITION EXPERIMENTS
IN THE COOLANT-SALT
TECHNOLOGY FACILITY

R.F. Apple

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) is
being operated for testing NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %)
for its suitability as a possible secondary coolant. In
cooperation with loop engineers and technicians, the
Analytical Chemistry Group is trying to determine
the fate and distribution of elemental tritium when it
is added directly to the salt to simulate, at least in
part, the predicted transport of tritium in the coolant
system via diffusion through the primary heat
exchanger. The methodology and the results from the
first two tnnum injection experiments were described
previously.' This section presents the results of the
third tritium injection experiment.

“About 80 mCi of tritium (diluted about 1:1000 with
protium) was introduced into the salt overa period of
about 11 hr beginning at 0900 hours September 16,
1976. Tritium concentrations were measured in the
cover gas and salt from the beginning and for several
days thereafter (Table 5.2).

Preliminary evaluation of the data indicates that
about half of the injected tritium experienced
significant hold up in the salt but was eventually
removed in the off-gas stream. Very little tritium in
the off-gas was in the elemental form. The majority
was in a water-soluble or combined form which is
advantageous from the standpoint of tritium trap-

- ping by the salt. Also, there appears to be evidence

that at low concentrations some of the tritium which
is captured by the salt has a tendency to escape on
standing. A general discussion of the behavior of
tritium in the CSTF and 2 more complete analysis of
the injection experiments are given elsewhere.’

A fourth tritium injection experiment now
under way uses improved gas addition and sampling
techniques. Tritium will be added in this experiment

5.3 ELECTROCHEMICAL STUDIES OF
TELLURIUM IN MOLTEN

LiF-BeF>-ThF, (72-16-12 MOLE %)
'D. L. Manning  G. Mamantov

Tellurium occurs in nuclear reactors as a fission
product and results in shallow intergranular cracking

38

in structural metals and alloys.’ Efforts were
continued to characterize this substrance electro-

- chemically and to ascertain the feasibility of in situ
monitoring by electroanalytical means.

Tellurium screening studies were carried out in
cooperation with J. R. Keiser of the Metals and

Ceramics Division. As previously reported,® lithium

telluride, Li;Te, was added to molten LiF-BeF:-
ThF,, which was contained in a cell equipped with
viewing ports in addition to the electrode ports.
Subsequent voltammograms did not reveal any
waves that could be attributed to soluble electroac-

tive tellurium species. Chemical analysis indicated

ThF, following standard additions of Li:Te and
LiTe; compounds under these conditions. It appears
that these tellurides are, for the most part, relatively
insoluble and/or thermally unstable under these
experimental conditions.

In the absence of meaningful voltammograms,
experiments were initiated to determine the decom-
position potential of elemental tellurium (mTe + ne”
— Ten," ) relative to the half-wave potential of the
U(V) — U(ID) electrode reaction. This should
provide some insight on the reducing power
[U(IV)/ U(I1I) ratio] required to favor the existence
of tellurides (if stable) over elemental tellurium in
MSBR fuel salt. For these experiments, the molten

- LiF-BeF>-ThF, was contained in a pyrolytic boron

<5 ppm tellurium in the melt. Following cleanup of

the cell and recharging with LiF-BeF.-THF,,

standard additions of LiTe; were made in the form of
pressed pellets. The pellets disappeared more rapidly
from the melt surface than did the Li,Te pellets. A

greyish film having a metallic appearance formed -

on the surface. Subsequent voltammograms did not -

show any significant changes over background scans.
The equilibrium potential remained the same, which
was different from the Li»Te additions where the melt
became more reducing. This means that LiTes is not
stable under our operating conditions. Bamberger et
al.” showed that isothermal conditions were neces-

sary to hold the characteristic color for any length of

time in experiments on spectral measurements of
what was reported to be LiTe; in LiF-BeF,. Under -

nonisothermal conditions the color quickly disap-

peared with evidence of tellurium metal formation.

Since our conditions are nonisothermal, the LiTe;
probably decomposed immediately after contacting
the melt. The greyish film having a metallic
appearance that was noted on the melt surface
apparently tended to short out the electrodes after
a few hours because the voltammograms became
extremely noisy and nonreproducible. However,

there was no change in the equilibrium potential.
Thus, we have been unable to detect stable
electroactive telluride species in molten. LiF-Bek-

nitride cup. The holder for the small tellurium pool
electrode (Y-in.-diam) was fabricated from
spectrographic-grade graphite. Cathodic polariza-
tion curves recorded on the tellurium pool electrode
right after dipping into the melt at ~650°C and for
the next hour or so revealed a decomposition
potential of about +1.15 V vs the melt limit. It was
observed that ~100 mg of tellurium volatilized from
the graphite holder in approximately 1 hr. The half-
wave potential for the U(IV) — U(III) electrode
reaction relative to the melt limit is ~ +0.75 V. Thus
the decomposition potential of tellurium relative to
Eyp for U(IV) — U(III) reduction is of the order of
+0.40 V, which corresponds to a U(IV)/ U(III) ratio
of ~150at 923 K (650° C). From these measurements,
it appears that a relatively reducing melt is required
to favor the existence of stable telluride species over
elemental tellurium in molten LiF-BeF>-ThF,-U(IV)
at 923 K (650°C). ,

In a second experimental setup located in J. R.
Keiser’s laboratory and with Keiser’s cooperation, we
are monitoring the U(IV)/ U(11I) ratio in molten LiF-
BeF:-ThF: following additions of tellurium as
Cr3Tes. With the U(IV)/ U(111) ratio at a stable value
of ~110at 978 K (1300°F), a standard addition of 105
mg of Cr;Te, was made. This addition resulted in no
change either in the U(IV)/U(IIl) ratio or shape

of the voltammograms over a two-~day monitoring
period. A second addition of 1.00 g of CrsTes was

then made, which resulted in an increase in the
U(IV)/ U(III) ratio from ~110 to 220. This effect has
been observed previously and is believed to be due to
slight moisture contamination during addition
procedures. Within three days the U**/ U’ ratio had
decreased to about 90 and appeared to stabilize at
about this value. No change in the characteristics of
the voltammograms (new waves, etc) was observed

 
 

following the larger addition, although the U(IV)/
U(IH) ratio appeared to level out at a somewhat
lower value. Metal specimens present in the cell will
be removed and examined for tellurium effects.

In order to obtain additional information on the
formation and stability of tellurides under noniso-~
thermal conditions, studies were conducted on the
telluride species produced in situ from cathodizing
elemental tellurium (mTe + ne” — Te,™ ). Chronopo-
tentiometric and double potential step experiments
conducted at a tellurium pool electrode contained in
a graphite cup revealed that the telluride species
generated does not appear to be stable at ~650°C.
Instability was indicated from the chronopotentio-
metric experiments by comparing the ratio of the
forward and reverse transition times.® Generation of
a stable but insoluble substance yields 77/ .= 1; for a
soluble and stable species, 77/ 7, = 3 is predicted. For
an unstable species, on the other hand, the value of

‘7/7, should be greater than three. For these

experiments, the current was reversed ata time t <7z,

however, the above conclusions remain valid as long
as t < 75 Potential-time curves recorded at the
tellurium pool electrode produced a value of 74/ 7, >3
in all the runs, indicating that the telluride species
generated is not stable, at least within the time frame
of the experiment (seconds).

- In the double potential step’ expenments, the

anodic—cathodic current ratio (i./i.) is plotted vs a -

function of time [ F(#)] during which the potential step
is applied and removed. For a stable system, i,/i.= 1
when F(?) is extrapolated to zero. For the generation
of an unstable species, i,/ i. < 1; this was observed for
the tellurium experiments.

Plots of log i vs E from potential step experiments
revealed an n value close to unity. The validity of n
-value determinations by this method is discussed by
Armstrong et al.'"’ and Bacarella and Griess."' Thus if
n = 1, the telluride generated can be represented as
mTe + ¢ — Ten (m = 1). Bronstem using a
different method, also obtained an n value of unity
from polanzatlon studies of tellurium in molten
chlorides. -

A stable telluride of the type Te. should exhibita
color when dissolved in the melt.” In an effort to

observe this effect, we cathodized elemental tellurium

in molten LiF-BeF; at ~480° C. The melt was held in
a quartz tube to permit visual observations. When a
current of ~150 to 300 mA was applied for several
seconds or longer, a dark brown substance was
observed streaming from the tellurium electrode;
however, the material appeared insoluble, and a
colored melt was not produced. After the material

39

diffused away from the electrode a short distance (~1
cm), the color could no longer be seen. These results
also indicate that we are generating an unstable
species that under nonisothermal conditions under-
goes a decomposition reaction. Reasonable reactions
are as follows:

2Te™! — Te,”

Te;” — Te* + Tet (m = 1)

ITen — Te” + Cm-1D Tet(m>1)

The Te® does not appear to be soluble in fluoride
melts, at least to the extent that voltammetric
detection is feasible.

54 ELECTROCHEMICAL STUDIES OF ‘_
OXYGENATED SPECIES IN
MOLTEN FLUORIDES

D. L. Manning

Voltammetric anodic scans at a gold electrode in
molten LiF-BeF>-ThF, (MSBR fuel solvent)and also
in molten LiF-BeF:-ZrFs (MSRE fuel solvent)
revealed two anodic waves at peak potentials ~1.05,
1.3 V and 0.85, 1.2 V vs an iridium quasi-reference
electrode (Ir QRE) respectively. Noise is encountered
on the diffusion current plateau of the second wave,
which is indicative of gas-bubble formation at the
electrode surface. The waves are irreversible at slow
(0.1 V/sec) scan rates. Although the results are
tentative, these waves are probably associated with
the oxygenated species in the melts. :

A calculation of the n value for the first anodic
wave from the ratio of the volt-ammetnc ip/ v to the
chronopotentxometnc ir'? and also the chronoam-
perometric ir"? revealed a value of approximately
unity in both melts. Scan rate studies of the first wave
in LiF-BeF,-ThF, revealed a decrease in the i,/ v
value of ~30% over the range of 0.1 to 5 V/sec. A

G. Mamantov

possible mechanism that reflects this behavmr

involves a charge transfer followed by dimerization."’
If it is assumed that the wave is associated with
“oxide” in the melt, a likely reaction could be

O -le— 0O

200 — O

" which would account for the one-electron charge and

dimerization. Efforts to carry out similar measure-
ments in LiF-BeF:-ZrF: were hampered by a small

 
 

 

 

 

prewave at the foot of the first anodic wave which
became very large at the faster scan rates. The peak
current (i) of the prewave was roughly proportional
to v (scan rate), which is indicative of adsorption of
product (probably Q) at the electrode surface. It is
not clear why this adsorption effect is so pronounced
in LiF-BeF;-ZrFs.

If the first anodic wave represents the oxidation of
oxide to the peroxide, the second anodic wave must
represent the continued oxidation to superoxide and
ultimately oxygen gas. The noise on the diffusion
current plateau of the second wave is indicative of gas
formation at the electrode surface. The reactions are

complex; however, the overall n value for the second -

wave should be 2 (assuming O,* = 2e — O).

For chronopotentiometry, the magnitude of the
transition time, 71 and 7 for the stepwise oxidation of
a substance involvingn=1landn=2, respectively,
results’ in a ratio of transﬂmn times 71/ 72 = 8. The
‘experimental data from chmnopotentiograms re-
corded on both melts were in reasonable agreement
W1th the predlcted value.

- If the second anodic wave is a perioxide oxidation
wave, the addition of peroxide to the melt should
result in a pronounced increase in the i, of the wave.
We added 600 mg of Na,O: to the LiF-BeF,-ZrF,
melt. The first interesting observation was a 200-mV
anodic shift in the equilibrium potential (more
oxidizing) over a period of a few minutes and, then,a
gradual return to about the original value within a
few hours. A pronounced increase was observed for
the second anodic wave height. At faster scan rates
(~5-50 V/sec) the second wave is split, and a small
post-wave can be observed. This led us to believe that
we were seeing the intermediate peroxide — superox-
ide step and that the small post-wave was due to the
superoxide oxidation. - To check this further, a
standard addition of sodium superoxide, NaQ,, was
made, and a pronounced increase in the peak height
of the post-wave was observed, which supports our
belief that the wave is due to superoxide oxidation.

It is also worth noting that a new cathodic volt-
ammogram at ~-0.5 V vs Ir QRE was detected
following the Na,O. addition. The wave apparently
- involves a one-clectron step. Although it is interest-
ing to speculate on various electrode reactions, at
present it can only be said that the wave results from

40

the reduction of peroxy and superoxy species. The
value of the reduction potential [~—400 mV more
negatwe than that for N1(II)] for this process is
surprising.

After one day the wave heights of the volt-
ammograms had diminished, and after about four
days the effect of the Na,O. was no longer detected.

“The reason that an increase in the first anodic wave

(believed to be due to oxide — peroxide) was not seen
as the peroxide decomposed (207, — Oz + 207) is that
the melt may have already been saturated with oxide.
The fact that the second anodic wave increased upon
adding Na,O: supports our belief that this wave,
although complicated, is due to peroxide oxidation.
~ These observations continue to be encouraging.
The reproducibility of the curves for a given set of
conditions is generally good. It is believed that a
significant step has been taken toward the capability
of in-line monitoring of the oxide level in fluoride
melts under favorable conditions. '

Part 3. Materials Development
H.E McC_cl’y'_‘

The main thrust of the materials program is the |

development of a structural material for the MSBR
primary circuit which has adequate resistance to
embrittlement by neutron irradiation and to shallow
intergranular attack by fission product penetration.
A modified Hastelloy N containing 2% titanium has
good resistance to irradiation embrittlement, but
does not have sufficient resistance- to shallow
intergranular cracking by tellurium. It appears
necessary to modify the alloy by the addition of
niobium to impart better resistance to cracking.
Laboratory programs to study Hastelloy N-salt-
tellurium interactipns are being established, includ-
ing the development of methods for exposing test
materials under simulated reactor operating condi-
tions. Surface-analysis capabilities have been im-
proved so that the reaction products in the affected

grain boundaries can be identified.

The procurement of products from two commer-
cial heats (8,000 and 10,000 Ib) of 2% titanium-
modified Hastelloy N continued. Some of the
seamless tubing was received and was of good
quality. The products are being used in all phases of

the materials program One 2500-1b heat of 2%

41

titanium plus 1% niobium modified Hastelloy N was
procured as several bar products. Small, 50-1b
commercial melts of several niobium—titanium-
modified alloys were obtained and were mcludcd in
all phases of the program.

" The work on chemical processing materials is
concentrated on evaluation of graphite for use in
reductive extraction steps involving molten salts and
liquid bismuth. Capsule tests are in progress to study
possible chemical interactions between graphite-
metal systems and bismuth-lithium solutions and to
evaluate the mechanical intrusion of these solutions
into the graphite. :

Some of the effort during this reporting penod was
expended in reestablishing test facilities. Six thermal-
convection loops are in operation in the new loop
facility, which will accommodate at least ten loops.

The mechanical property and general test facility is

partlally operational, but numerous test fixtures
remain to be assembled and tests started. An air lock
has been added to the general test facility to make it

‘more functional, and plans were partially developed

for further expansion of the facility.

6. Development of Modified Hastelloy N
H. E. McCoy

The purpose of this program is the development of
metallic structural materials for an MSBR. The
current emphasis is on the development of a material
for the primary circuit, which is the most important
problem at present. Material for the primary circuit

will be exposed to a modest thermal-neutron fluxand

either added to salt or sealed in evacuated quartz vials
to provide a source of tellurium. Several experimen-
tal alloys have been exposed to tellurium, and the
extent of intergranular cracking was evaluated

. metallographically. Essential to this program are
" adequate techniques for identifying and characteriz-

to fuel salt- that contains fission products. A

modification of standard Hastelloy N will probably
be a satisfactory material for this apphcatlon An
alloy that contains 2%
quately resist 1rradnatlon embrittlement, but the 2%

titanium does not impart adequate resistance to
intergranular embrittlement by tellurium. Additions
of 0.5 to 2% niobium are effective in reducing
tellunum-mduced shallow ‘intergranular cracking,
but the effects of neutron irradiation on alloys

titanium appears to ade-

containing niobium have not been characterized

fully., Obtaining this information has been a major
part of our work during this report period. Increasing
the chromium concentration from the present 7% to
between 12 and - 15% may also be beneficial in
preventing tellurium-induced shallow intergranular
attack. Currently, factors associated with production
of the 2% titanium-modified alloy in commercial
quantities are being studied, while smaller heats are
being made of Hastelloy N containing additions of
niobium alone as well as additions of niobium and
rare earths to 2% titanium-modified Hastelloy N.
These materials are being evaluated.

Two large heats, one 10,000 Ib and the other 8 ,000
Ib, of the 2% titanium-modified alloy have been
melted by a commercial vendor. Product shapes

mcludmg plate, bar, and wire have been obtained for

use in the alloy development program. Tubing is
currently being produced by two independent routes.
The various product forms from the two large heats
are being used to fabricate the salt-contacting
portions of two forced-circulation loops. One 2500-1b
heat of an alloy modified with 2% titanium-1%
niobium was produced and converted to bar pro-
ducts.

- Laboratory methods for studying Hastelloy N-
salt-tellurium reactions are under development.
Methods must be developed for exposing candidate
structural materials to simulated reactor operating
conditions. Tests are being run in which specimens
are exposed at 700°C to the low partial pressure of
tellurium vapor in equilibrium with tellurium metal
at 300° C. Other tests involve metal tellurides that are

ing the reaction products. Several methods for the
analysis of surface layers are under development.
Materials that are found to resist shallow inter-
granular cracking in laboratory tests will be exposed
to fissioning salt in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor
TeGen fueled-capsule series. Three sets of fuel pins
have been filled with fuel salt and areat various stages
of evaluation. These pins are made of alloys modified
with titanium, chrormum moblum and tltamum
plus niobium.

OF EXPERIMENTAL ALLOYS

6.1.1 Production Heats of 2% _
Titanium-Modified Hastelloy N L

~ One of the activities in the materials development
program has been the production scale-up of 2%
titanium-modified Hastelloy N, a candidate structur-
al material for the prrmary circuit of an MSBR. As
reported previously,' two large heats of the alloy, one
10,000 1b and the other 8,000 1b, have been produced
by a commercial vendor. These heats have been used
to establish processing parameters for producing
plate, bar, and wire; and recent emphasis has been
placed on processing seamless tubing. Mill products
from these heats are being used in the general
experimental program, with a principal use being the
construction of two forced circulation loops designed
for studying the compatibility of the alloy with fuel
salt.

Two routes have been taken, one by the vendorand
the other by ORNL, for the fabrication of seamless
tubing, with the starting stock in both cases
originating from the 8,000-1b heat of the alloy (heat
No. 8918-5-7421, generally designated as 75421). The
vendor’s route included forging and turning six

- pieces of bar, each 4.5 in. in diameter by 6 ft long;

production of a tube hollow by trepanning to a 4.5-in.
OD X 0.5-in. wall by a subcontractor; tube reducing
(pilgering) in three steps with intermediate anneals to

 
 

 

2.0-in. OD X 0.083 and 0.095-in. wall; and drawing to

annealing 0f 0.312-in.-diam barand 0.125-~and 0.095-

in.-diam wire, the three tube-reducing operations by

the vendor were initially confined to one tube hollow
to determine if fire cracking would remain a problem.-

The intermediate annealing temperature . .was

1121°C, followed by water quenching. Annealing of

the hollow between each tube-reducing operation

was preceded by the annealing of a sample which was

then  liquid-penetrant inspected for evidence of
crackmg With this procedure the hollow was taken

through - the tube-reducmg steps and annealing
treatments with no major problems. At this stage,

approximately 24 ft of 2.0-in. OD X 0.187-in. wall
stock was available for-further processing. One-haif:

of this quantity, or 12 ft, was then tube reduced to
1.25-in. OD X 0.095-in. wall X about 36 ft at the

facilities of the subcontractor and was then returned

to the vendor for annealing. The tube was cut into
four lengths, each about 9 ft, and returned to the
subcontractor for the pilot drawing run to final sizes.

The reduction schedule by plug drawing and
sinking for the four lengths of 1.25-in. OD X 0.095-in.

wall tubing closely followed that for stainless steel

(i.e., approximately 25% reduction of area per pass).

The schedule was designed to cover three of the four

finish sizes required. The drawing and sinking
operatlons were performed on a 15,000 1b draw
bench. - Commercial - lubricants were used. The
lubrication practice consxsted of applying Houghton
Plastlc ‘No. 467 to the outside and inside surfaces,
then drying for about 30 min. During the actual
draw, a lubricant, G. Whitfield Richards EPHA, was

flowed over the outside diameter before the tube

entered the die. The tubing was degreased and
‘annealed at 1394 K (ll2l°C) after each draw.
Annealing was carried out in a continuous,
hydrogen-atmosphere ~furnace without water
quench. The overall annealing cycle was slightly

- under 20 min. once the tube entered the furnace, with

time in the hot zone being about 6 min. As with
earlier practice, a 12-in. sample was cut from the
tube, degreased, annealed, pickled, and then visually
and liquid-penetrant inspected before committing

the balance of the tube to these operations. Hardness -
~ measurements were made before and after annealing.

With the procedure outlined above, the quantity of
tubing indicated in Table 1 was produced from the

after annealing.

A final annealing temperature of 1450 K (1177°C)
has been specified for mill products of the alloy,
including tubing. In the production of cold drawn bar
and wire, the vendor preceded the 1450 K (1177°C)
anneal with a 1394 K (1121°C) anneal since it was felt
that the prior lower-temperature anneal helped to
minimize fire cracking. To determine if there were
any difference between a direct 1450 K (1177°C) and
a combined 1394 K (1121°C) plus 1450 K (1177°C)
final anneal for the tubing, the two lengths of 0.750-
in. OD X 0.072-in. wall tubing were annealed both
ways. ‘No cracking was observed in either case by
liquid-penetrant inspection. These lengths were also

~eddy-current inspected at the facilities of the

subcontractor and were compared against an 0.005-

‘in.-deep transverse notch filed in one of the tubes.

Three indications within a length of about 4 in. were
found in the center of the tube given the direct
1177° C anneal, The “defect” section was cut from the
tube - and inspected radiographically against a
penetrameter with an 0.010-in.-diam hole and an

| 0.010-in.-wide notch. No flaws could be found in the

section. Remspectlon with hquld penetrant again
showed nothing. In addition, a Y-in.-long ring was
cut from each of the annealed tubes and was crushed
flat with no evidence of cracking. |
The tubing from the pilot drawing run has been
received at ORNL. Prior to delivery, the various

lengths were hydrostatically tested at 1000 psi; they

passed successfully. Since receipt, additional inspec-
tions have been performed. A 6-in. length of each size
of tubing was cut, split:in half longitudinally, and

- liquid-penetrant (red-dye) inspected on both ODand

ID; no flaws ‘were found (Fig. 6.1). Metallographic

tubing from the pilot run was ultrasonically inspected
and compared against standards of standard Hastel-
loy N with an 0.004-in.-deep notch. No indications
greater than those from the notched standards were
observed. '

Following completion of the pilot drawing run, the
remaining tube hollow stock was committed to the
production run. The stock was tube reduced to 2.0-in.
OD X 0.187-in. wall by the vendor, annealed, then

further tube reduced by the subcontractor to the two
previously mentioned sizes, 1.25-in. OD X 0.095 and
0.083-in. wall. (The lighter wall stock is scheduled to
finish at 1.00-in. OD X 0.065-in. wall by drawing.) At
this stage, inspection of both cold worked (as tube
reduced) and annealed specimens showed the ODsto
be free of flaws, but borescopic examination of the
IDs indicated questionable areas. Subsequent metal-
lographic examination of these areas revealed the
presence of cracks generally between 0.001 and 0.008

 

 

 
 

 

in. deep with several between 0.012 and 0.018 in.
deep. These cracks were oriented parallel to the tube
axis, and they varied from about 0.125 to 0.5 in. in
length. A total of ten lengths of each of the 0.083-in.
and 0.095-in. wall stock were involved in this
evaluation. _

Since the pilot drawing run had been accomplished
without difficulty, the incidence of ID cracking
during the production run cannot be satisfactorily

explained at present. Several options are open forthe

completion of the production run: (1) hone the IDs of
the tube-reduced hollows to remove defects before
proceeding with the drawing operations or (2)
commit a portion of the lot to final drawing with no
ID conditioning. If the flaws do not propagate and
remain a constant percentage of wall thickness, their
depth at finish should be mostly within the inspection
criterion of 3% of the wall thickness or 0.004 in.,
whichever is greater. If the flaws do propagate, the
balance of the lot will be available for ID condition-
ing prior to drawing. Option 2 is preferred.

As described in the previous progress report,' the

second route to obtain seamless tubing involved hot
extrusion of tube shells from billets machined froma

forged bar of heat No. 75421, followed by cold .

drawing by an outside source. The extrusions were
made with moderate success but required condition-
ing of the IDs to eliminate hot tears. This problem
was felt to be caused by inadequate glass lubrication
during extrusion. To test this assumption, two more
extrusions were made using MoQ; as the lubricant
rather than glass. The billets were prepared from the
same heat of the alloy with a molybdenum tube lining
the IDs and a plasma-sprayed molybdenum coating
on the ODs. These billets were extruded at 1250°Cto
tube blanks, 1.625-in. OD X 1.0-in. ID, or an
extrusion ratio of approximately 10 to 1. After
removal of the residual molybdenum, the surfaces of
the extrusions were found to be significantly
improved. These tube blanks were scheduled into the

redraw activities of the outside source. However,

definitive results were not obtained on the redraw
characteristics of these extrusions since the alternate
approach to obtain tubing was terminated at this
point. All tube processing effort was then directed
toward the routing of the first vendor and his
subcontractor in view of their success with the pilot
drawing run. _ o

commercial vendor for a more complete characteri-
zation of alloys within this system. Chemical analyses
are given in Table 6.2. Niobium additions to the 2%

- titanium-modified Hastelloy N base are being

studied for enhancing resistance to tellurium embrit-
tlement. Eight of the alloys :(heats 76025 through
76032) were 50-1b vacuum induction plus vacuumarc
remelted heats with niobium levels between about 0.5
and 2%. Four of these alloys contain different levels
of the residual elements iron, manganese, and sili-
con, which are important because of their beneficial
effects upon oxidation resistance. The eight heats
were successfully converted to '/;-in.-thick hot-rolled
plate, approximately 30 1b per alloy, which is
presently being prepared for weldability evaluation.
Wire and rod are being processed at ORNL from
strips cut from the plate to provide material for
weldability, salt corrosion, tellurium compatibility,
and mechanical property tests.

The ninth alloy (heat 76902) was a 2500-Ib vacuum
induction plus electroslag remelted heat of nominally
1% niobium—2% titanium-modified Hastelloy N.
Product received included 247 Ib of %;¢-in.-diam bar,
538 1b of ¥s-in.~diam bar, 566 1b of 1Y¢-in.-diam bar,
and 610 1b of 4-in.-square bar. Several billets have
been cut from the 4-in.-square bar for hot rolling a
small quantity of Y»-in.-thick plate for weldability

studies. Wire and mechanical property specimens are

being prepared from the *fi¢-in.-diam bar.

6.2 STABILITY OF VARIOUS
MODIFIED HASTELLOY N ALLOYS
IN THE UNIRRADIATED CONDITION

T. K. Roche H. E. McCoy J. C. Feltner

The study of the stability of niobium, titanium, and
aluminum containing modified Hastelloy N with
respect to intermetallic precipitation has continued.
The objective of this study is to define the upper limits

-of these elements that can be added to Hastelloy N

and still maintain a reasonable degree of stability.

~ The stabilities of a number of alloys, including

laboratory, semiproduction, and production heats,
‘containing varying amounts of the elements under
‘consideration were determined by hardness, tensile

_ properties, creep-rupture properties, and microstruc-

tural evaluation. From results reported in the
previous progress report® for titanium-aluminum-

modified Hastelloy N,? it was possible to propose

gamma-prime solvus temperature boundaries at 650

- and 704°C as a function of titanium and aluminum

Products of nine heats of niobium-titanium-

modified Hastelloy N have been received from a

concentrations. During the present report period the
locations of these boundaries have been refined, and

the 800°C boundary has been proposed. This has
been possible through the accumulation of additional
creep-rupture, hardness, and tensile data on earlier
alloys and the evaluation of new compositions.
Mechanical property data for pertinent alloys are
presented in Tables 6.3 and 6.4, and these data have
been analyzed as a unit in arriving at the proposed
gamma-prime solvus at 650, 704, and 800°C (Fig.
6.2). T : L
The mechanical property data in Tables 6.3and 6.4
were grouped according to alloy stability at the
various temperatures. At a given test temperature,
unstable alloys show creep rates between one and
three orders of magnitude less than the creep rates of

_stable alloys, and the rupture lives of unstable alloys

are significantly longer than those of stable alloys. In
the case of hardness and tensile data, instability or-
age hardening results in an increase in hardness and -
strength and a decrease in ductility relative to values
for annealed material. This study has shown that the
2% titanium-modified Hastelloy N alloy can contain

47

up to about 2.2% titanium with 0.4% aluminum and
still retain reasonable stability.

6.3 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF
MODIFIED HASTELLOY N ALLOYS IN
THE UNIRRADIATED CONDITION

T. K. Roche J. C. Feltner B. McNabb

The determination of reference mechanical prop-
erty data has continued for the various heats of
modified Hastelloy N alloys being evaluated. These
data include room- and elevated-temperature tensile
properties and creep-rupture properties in air at 650,

- 704, and 760°C and serve as a reference for

comparison with the properties of standard and other
modified Hastelloy N alloys both in the unirradiated
and irradiated conditions.

Several of the heats of 2% titanium-modified
Hastelloy N which have been factored into the
program include two production heats (74901 and
75421) and six semiproduction heats (74533, 74534,

- During this report period, creep-rupture tests were
completed for heat 75421 at three stress levels for

each of three test temperatures. The specimens were
prepared from a Ys-in.-diam bar of the alloy and were

elongations for this heat and the range of these values
determined for the other heats of this series. At 650°C
the rupture behavior of heat 75421 falis on the lower
side of the range. At 704 and 760°C the rupture
behavior of this heat is more within the established
range. In all cases the 29, titanium-modified alloys

- exhibit longer rupture times than standard Hastelloy

N tested under the same conditions.

with these data are the properties for two earlier heats

(heats 471-114 and 471-583) of 2% titanium-modified

Hastelloy N and typical properties for standard
Hastelloy N. From the tabulation, it can be seen for
any one alloy that increasing temperature within the
temperature range of 650 to 800°C has a greater
effect in reducing the ultimate tensile strength than
the yield strength. In fact, the yield strength of any
one alloy remains relatively constant in this temper-
ature range, but there are heat-to-heat variations
which result in a spread from 40.0 to 29.0 X 10° psi.
The data are presented in the general order of

decreasing yield strength of the various heats at

elevated temperature and there is an apparent
correlation between yield strength and titanium
content in the range of 1.8 to 2.19%. Note that the two
lanthanum-containing alloys (heats 474-534 and 474-
558) show the highest yield strengths. In making this
correlation, other variables which also influence
tensile properties have not been considered.

All the alloys show a decrease in ductility (rupture
elongation) at elevated temperature relative to the
value at room temperature, a characteristic of nickel-
base alloys. The magnitude of this decrease and the
rate of recovery as temperature increases vary from
heat to heat. As with creep-rupture properties, the
tensile properties of the 2% titanium-modified alloys
are higher than those of the standard alloy.

Niobium-modified Hastelloy N seems to have
good Tresistance to tellurium embrittlement, and a
new scries of laboratory alloys based upon Ni-12%
- Mo-7% Cr-0.2% Mn-0.06% C containing between 0
and 1% mobxum in 0.20% increments was prepared for
a closer evaluation of radiation damage resistance.

Creep-rupture tests on unirradiated specimens are
under way in air at 650° C to establish baseline data.
Limited results obtained thus far show that these
alloys have shorter rupture lives at 650°C than 2%
titanium-modified Hastelloy N.

H. E. McCoy T. K. ‘Roche

Tests have been made on a number of alloys, but
the main emphasis during this report period was on
alloys modified with niobium. Prior tests on these
alloys measured the properties with the material heat
treated to produce a fine grain size. We later learned
that such anneals did not produce optimum proper-
ties in Hastelloy N, but our work had shown that the
addition of about 2% titanium resulted in excellent
resistance to irradiation embrittlement; so we did not
continue investigation of the niobium-modified
alloys. Recent observations concerning the excellent
resistance of the niobium-modified alloys to embrit-
tlement by tellurium offered added incentive to more
fully investigate the irradiation embrittlement of the
niobium-modified alloys.

Experiment ORR-233 was run for the explicn
purpose of irradiating alloys currently on hand which
contained niobium.* The individual tensile speci-
mens were mounted in clusters of three inside a small
heater (Figs. 6.3 and 6.4). The temperature was

diation creep prdpetties' measured to date are
summarized in Table 6.8. The stress-rupture proper-
ties at 650°C of several of the alloys are shown

graphically in Fig. 6.5. All specimens irradiated at |

650° C had rupture lives in excess of those of standard

Hastelloy N in the unirradiated condition. The-

fracture strains were quite high and generally fell in
the 10 to 20% range. Irradiation at 704° C caused a
pronounced déterioration of the properties of the

alloys modified only with niobium. The alloys
containing 1 to 2% niobium were affected less, and

- their properties are still acceptable after irradiation at

this condition. After irradiation at 760°C, only the
alloy containing 2% moblum retained acceptable
properties. -

- Alloys 303 and 413 (Fig. 6.5), which contained
niobium and titanium additions, had excellent
postirradiation properties after irradiation at 650,

 
 

 

704, and 760° C. However, these alloys do not have
good resistance to embrittlement by tellurium. .
The results from three of the niobium-modified
alloys are shown in more detail in Figs. 6.6 and 6.7.
The stress-rupture properties in Fig. 6.6 show thatall
three alloys had good rupture properties after
irradiation at 650° C, that alloys containing 1 and 2%

‘niobium retained good properties after irradiation at

760°C.

The minimum creep rates for these three alloys are
shown in Fig. 6.7. One problem in this comparison is
that the specimens tested in the unirradiated
condition were simply annealed I hrat 1177° Cbefore

testing, but the irradiated specimens were annealed 1 .

hr at 1177°C and then. held at the indicated

temperature for 908 hr during irradiation before

creep testing. The latter -treatment precipitates
carbides and generally increases the creep rate by
removing alloying elements from solution. In the
unirradiated condition, all three alloys have about
equivalent creep rates and are stronger (have lower

* creep rates) than standard Hastelloy N. The limited

data on alloy 21543 (0.7% niobium) show that the
creep rate was increased by irradiation and that the
increase was greater as the irradiation temperature
was increased. Alloy 237 (1% niobium) exhibited a
slight increase in creep rate due to irradiation at 650
and 704°C, but a greater increase when irradiated at
760° C. The creep rate of alloy 298 (2% niobium) was
not altered detectably by irradiation at any of the
three temperatures. . .

Alloys 345 and 348 contained additions of niobium”

. and silicon and the resistance of these alloys to

tellurium embrittlement was excellent. However,
these alloys had very poor postirradiation properties

(Table 6.8). This result was anticipated because of the
role of silicon in promoting the formation of coarse
MsC-type carbides rather than the finely dispersed
MC-type carbides formed in the absence of silicon. It
is not known whether the good resistance of these
alloys to tellurium embrittlement was from the
presence -of niobium or silicon or both, but these
postirradiation results show clearly that silicon levels
in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 cannot be tolerated because
of the effects on the mechanical properties.

- These postirradiation creep data have shown that
the niobium-modified alloys have adequate resist-
ance to embrittlement by neutron irradiation. Some
further work is needed to optimize the niobium level
and to define the maxxmum allowable service

TW.(-) lar-gely. independent studies are in progress

concerning the microstructure of nickel-base alloys.
‘One study is funded by the Molten-Salt Reactor

Program - and involves alloys of direct Program
interest. In the other study, which is being done by an
ORAU student, simpler alloys are being investigated
to obtain more basic data. However, both programs

contribute to our understanding of nickel-base
alloys, and research data from both programs are
included in this report.

6.5.1 Production of 2%
Titanium-Hastelloy N Alloys with
Uniform Carbide Distribution

VD. N. Bl_'aski J. M. Leitnaker G. A. Potter

Introduction. Improved properties, especially
those related to irradiation resistance, have been
achieved by adding about 2 wt % titanium to
Hastelloy N.* However, this new alloy demonstrated
large, and as yet unexplained, variations in postirra-
diation creep properties.’” Metallographic examina-
tion showed that the microstructures of the irradiated
samples were quite inhomogeneous, The purpose of
this investigation was to develop metallurgical
techniques that could be used to produce a homo-
geneous microstructure in 2% titanium-Hastelloy N.
Specifically, the goal was to remove the carbide

_stringers from the alloy and to redistribute the

carbides uniformly throughout the microstructure.
With this accomplished, it was hoped that both the
mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the
alloy could be simultaneously optimized. Further-
more, it should be expected that the principles
developed in reaching this goal would be generally
applicable to most structural alloys.

 
 

 

The “memory effect,” that is, how carbides
reprecipitate into stringers after normal solution
annealing and aging treatments, will be discussed
first, after which the results of various experiments
aimed at producing uniform carbide d1stnbut10n will
be presented and discussed.

The Memory Effect. The microstructure of
titanium-modified Hastelloy N consists of two
phases: (1) a face-centered-cubic, nickel-rich matrix
and (2) face-centered-cubic, MC-type carbides,
where M is a combination of primarily molybdenum,
titanium, chromium, and iron.* Invariably, the

carbide particles lie in stringers or lines parallel to the

principal working direction, as illustrated in Fig.
6.8a, which shows a polished and etched longitudinal
section of swaged 0.25-in.-diam rod from alloy 452.
The chemical composition of alloy 452 (Table 6.9)
shows that this alloy contains 0.048 wt % carbon—an
amount sufficient to provide good strength proper-
ties to Hastelloy N. When samples of alloy 452 were
solution-annealed for 1 hr at 1177° (a standard
annealing treatment used for Hastelloy N), most of
the carbides were dissolved into the matrix (Fig.
6.8b).  Recrystallization and growth of the cold-
worked microstructure have also taken place, as
evidenced by the larger, equi-axed grains. The grain
boundaries were nonlinear—probably caused by the
pining action of remaining carbides during the grain
growth process. When the samples were aged for 160
hr at 760° C, carbides precipitated out in the matrix
(Fig. 6.8c). Precipitation of carbides occurred
predominately in areas where they existed before the
solution anneal at 1177° C and hence demonstrated
what is called a “memory effect.”

A clearer picture of what happened in the
microstructure of alloy 452 during aging is given in

shows that fine MC-type carbides precipitate outina
stacking fault morphology® along (111) planes. The
large “primary” carbide (one that did not dissolve
during the solution anneal) has a geometric shape
and may have punched out prismatic dislocations
which initiate the growth of stacking fault precipitate
ribbons. However, it will be shown later that primary
carbides are not required to produce stacking fault
ribbons in 2% titanium Hastelloy N. Also, precipita-
tion did not always occur in ribbons. Frequently
carbides precipitated on dislocations lying along the
(111) planes and formed thin, separate platelets
instead of ribbons (Fig. 6.10). Analyses by both
selected-area electron diffractions of thin foils and x-
ray diffraction of electrochemically extracted precip-
itates showed that all the carbides, regardless of
morphology, were of the fcc, MC type.

The main point in defining and trying to under-
stand the memory effect in titanium-modified
Hastelloy N is that this effect must be overcome in
order to fabricate an alloy without carbide stringers.
As long as the memory effect was occurring, it was
virtually impossible to get rid of carbide stringers.
The general approach to eliminating the memory
=ffect was to ensure that the carbides were dissolved
and in solution during the fabrication process. This
could be carried out in two ways: (1) lower the
carbon content of the alloy and continue to use the
same fabrication schedule or (2} maintain a carbon
content of ~0.05 wt % but adjust the fabrication
parameters so that the carbides remain in solution
during fabrication. Both of these approaches were
investigated.

Influence of Carbon Content. The first step in
adjusting the carbon content of the alloy was to
estimate the solubility of carbon in 2% titanium-
modified Hastelloy N at 1177° C. Using precipitation
extraction data from aged samples, the amount of
carbon soluble in the alloy at 1125° C (~50° C below
the desired annealing temperature) was calculated to
be 0.045 wt % carbon. Thus a 2% titanium-modified
Hastelloy-N alloy with less than 0.045 wt % carbon
should be free of carbide particles at 1177°C. Alloys
451 and 453 were prepared with carbon contents of
0.017 and 0.035 wt % respectively. They were
fabricated into 's-in.-diam rod actording to the
fabrication schedule (Table 6.10). With the lower
carbon content alloys, the solution anneal conducted
at 1177° Cafter hot swaging was expected to dissolve
the carbides. With the carbides in solution, no

stringers were expected to form durmg the remaining

cold swaging steps.

Unfortunately, both alloys contained carbide

stringers after fabrication was complete, as demon-
strated by the microstructure of alloy 451 (0.017 wt %
carbon) in the as-swaged condition (Fig. 6.11a).
However, when a sample of alloy 451 was given a 1-hr
solution anneal at 1177° C, almost all of the carbides

- were dissolved (Fig. 6.11b). Moreover, aging for 223

hr at 760° produced no carbide stringers (Fig. 6.11c).
Instead, tiny carbide particles precipitated out on

grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and preferen-
tially on crystallographic planes. These details were

more apparent with the electron microscope. Figure
6.12 shows MC-type carbides in a grain boundary of

the aged sample of alloy 451. Figure 6.13 shows small
MC platelets located near the center of a grain in the

sample. Trace analysis showed that the plateletsall lie
on (111) planes. Note that one of the thin MC
platelets also lies in the (l 11) foil plane. These results

show that the memory effect must have been present

‘during fabrication of alloy 451 but was eliminated

when small samples of the same heat were solution-

“annealed for 1 hrat 1177° C after swaging. Assuming

that the fabrication furnaces were at the correct

‘temperatures, the solution annealing time necessary

to dissolve the carbides must be sensitive to the mass

- of material being treated. Intuitively, this is reason-

able and has actually been observed repeatedly
throughout the investigation. The results for alloy
453 were similar to those for alloy 451 except thata
final | hrat 1177° Cdid not remove the memory effect
from that alloy Higher annealing temperatures or

longer times at 1177°C would be requnred to produce
"a uniform carbide distnbutlon in this 0.035-wt %

carbon alloy.
The rate of carbide dissolution was determined

quantitatively for both alloys 452and 451 by solution

annealing at 1177° C at different times and then using

the electrochemical extraction techniques to measure

66

the quantity of undissolved carbide left in the

microstructure (Fig. 6.14). Small samples of both

alloys were annealed at 1177°C for timesup to8 hrin

an argon atmosphere and were then analyzed for the
amounts of carbides remaining. In the case of alloy
451, at least 1 hr was needed to reach whatappears to
be an equilibrium amount of precipitate remaining in

than foralloy 451 for all annealing times investigated.
Its higher carbon content also made carbide
resolution sufficiently sluggish to enable the memory
effect to operate for annealing times up to at least 8
hr. This meant that longer times at 1177° C or higher

temperatures would be needed to eliminate the

the alloy. For times greater than about 1 hr,
essentially all of the carbides were dissolved into the.

matrix. However, small amounts of carbide precipi-
tate were extracted at even the longest annealing
time. It is possible that some precipitation (<0.1 wt
%) can occur upon cooling the sample after solution
annealing. There is also the possibility that a very
small amount of other insoluble inclusions present in
the alloy were being collected. _ '
Another important point concerning the removal
of the memory effect in 2% titanium Hastelloy N is
that once the carbides dissolve, additional time is
required for the carbide-forming elements to diffuse
away from stringer areas. If the elements are not
given sufficient time to disperse, they will reprecipi-
tate in a stringer morphology. The relation of time
and carbide dissolution is clearly illustrated by the
electrochemical extraction data on annealed samples
of alloys 451 and 452 (Fig. 6.14). The data for alloy
452 show that its higher carbon content resulted in
greater amounts of carbides in the microstructure

memory effect from alloy 452.

Influence of Fabrication Parameters. The previous
section indicated that 2% titanium-Hastelloy N alloys
with less than ~0.035 wt % carbon could be

fabricated by the existing shop fabrication schedule

shown in Table 6.10 for alloy 451. Usually, however,
carbon contents from 0.050 to 0.060 wt 9 have been

- used in the alloy development program to obtain
- good mechanical properties. Therefore, experiments

were conducted to determine how to alter the
fabrication process so that the memory effect would
be eliminated when the alloy carbon content was near
0.050 wt %. In fabricating alloy 452, doubling of hot
swaging reheat times as well as the time of the
homogenizing anneal (Table 6.10) was unsuccessful
in removing carbide stringers from the microstruc-
ture (Fig. 6.8a). Therefore, samples of the as-swaged
alloy 452 were solution-annealed for 1 hr at 1177,
1204, 1260, and 1300° C, respectively, in an attempt to
dissolve the MC-type carbides. These samples were
then aged at 760°C for 160 hr to reprecipitate the

~carbides. The results of the solution annealing

experiment are shown in optical metallography (Fig.

- 6.15). Solution annealing at 1177°C (Fig. 6.15a) and

at 1204° C (Fig. 6.15b) did not eliminate the memory
effect, and many carbides reprecipitated in areas
originally containing stringers. However, the anneals
at 1260°C (Fig. 6.15¢) and at 1300°C (Fig. 6.15d)
successfully removed the carbide stringers. Instead of
stringers, the higher solution anneals produced a fine
Widmanstatten structure of MC-type carbides within
the grains. The habit planes for carbide precipitation
were the matrix (111) planes. The relationship
between MC and matrix was epitaxial, that is,
(11 Dmc ||(11D)maix. MC-type carbides were also
found in the grain boundaries. Much of the
precipitates in the sample annealed at 1204°C (Fig.

~ 6.15b) had the Widmanstatten morphology, but

many of the carbides concentrated in prior stringer
areas. This observation strongly suggested that while
most of the carbides were dissolved at 1204°C, a 1-hr
annealing time at this temperature was not sufficient

“to permit adequate homogenization of the carbide-

forming elements throughout the matrix. These
results confirm earlier statements on solution-

- annealing which stress the importance of not only

dissolving the carbides but also allowing the carbide-

forming elements to disperse uniformly. The experi-
ments by Bradley and Leitnaker, to be discussed in
the next section of this report (Sect. 6.5.2), indicate
that molybdenum is the controlling element that
must be dispersed. |

From the result of the preceding experiments, it

was possible to design a new fabrication schedule that
produced a microstructure without stringers in an
alloy containing ~0.050 wt % carbon. The pilot run
of this new schedule is given in Table 6.10 for alloy
450 (see Table 6.9 for chemical composition). Thearc
cast ingot was 1.0 in. in diameter by ~6 in. long and
was canned in type 316 stainless steel having a 0.120-
in. wall thickness. The purpose of cladding the
material was to minimize decarburization during

processing at high temperatures in air. The as-cast.

ingot contained irregular-shaped grains with numer-
ous patches of carbide particles (Fig. 6.162). Hot
swaging was conducted at 1177°C, as before, but the
reheat times were held to !5 min. After hot swaging,
the microstructure contained a fine grain structure
with carbides in the grain boundaries (Fig. 6.165).
Areas lacking in carbides experienced more grain
growth, and hence a duplex grain structure was
produced. ' '

The swaged rod of alloy 450 was annealed at
1260° C for 1 hr which dissolved most of the carbides
and produced large recrystallized grains (Fig. 6.16¢).

However, enough carbides remained to justify an

additional anneal of 1 hr at 1300°C. The samples
were quenched in water after the 1300°C anneal to
prevent precipitation of carbides during cooling. This
latter anneal was effective in dissolving essentially all
of the carbides (as shown in Fig. 6.16d). The
discrepancy between the results of a 1-hr anneal at
1260° C foralloys 452 and 450 again apparently lies in
the differences in amounts of material annealed.
Thus the annealing practice must be controlled
closely with this alloy to obtain reproducible results.

The final three micrographs in Fig. 6.16 show the
material after cold swaging (Fig. 6.16¢), after a
subsequent stress relief anneal for 15 min at 1177°C
(Fig. 6.16f), and after final cold swaging (Fig. 6.16g).
During these final steps the grain size was reduced
through cold work and recrystallization processes.
Some carbides were precipitated in the grain
boundaries, but no stringers were observed. As final

proof that the memory effect had been eliminated,an

as-swaged sample was aged at 760° C for 168 hr. The
microstructure after aging did not contain stringers
but displayed a fine Widmanstatten structure of thin
MC platelets lying epitaxially on the (111) matrix
planes (Fig. 6.16A).

Precipitate extraction data from samples selected
during the fabrication of alloys 452 and 450 are
compared (Fig. 6.17). These data show, in a different

" way, how the memory effect was removed from 29

titanium Hastelloy. Both alloys contained ~0.050 wt
% carbon, and the cast ingot contained a nominal

amount of carbides. Some precipitation occurred

during hot swaging, and the total for both alloys
increased: Solution annealing was the critical step in
eliminating the memory effect, since substantially
more carbides were dissolved in alloy 450 because of
higher annealing temperatures. The extracted
amounts of carbides remained essentially unchanged
for both alloys after solution annealing. A high-
temperature anneal would effectively remove string-
ers from both alloys after fabrication was completed,
but the material would end up with a very large grain

‘'size. By performing the high-temperature anneal

early in fabrication, it is possible to produce some
grain refinement during later steps involving cold
work and recrystallization. Alloy 450 is currently

‘being tested to determine its resistance to radiation

damage and also its resistance to embrittlement by

tellurium. o |
Conclusions. The following conclusions have been
reached as a result of work discussed above:

1. Carbide stringers form in 29 titanium-
Hastelloy N alloys, as in many other structural
materials, during fabrication from the original
castings. A memory effect has been observed in the
solution-annealed and aged 29 titanium-Hastelloy N
alloys where carbides reprecipitate in areas that
originally contained stringers. '

2. The memory effect was eliminated, and a
uniform distribution of carbides was produced in
alloy 451 by lowering the carbon content of the alloy
from ~0.050 to 0.017 wt %. The standard 1 hr at
1177° C solution-annealing temperature was used.

3. The memory effect was eliminated in 2%
titanium-Hastelloy N alloys with ~0.050 wt %:.
carbon by increasing the solution-annealing tem-
perature to ~1300°C.The high-temperature anneal

.was given early in fabrication to help maintain

a reasonably small grain size in the final material.

4. To remove the memory effect (carbide string-

ers), a solution-annealing treatment must:

a. dissolve most of the carbides,

b. be of sufficient duration to allow the carbide-
forming elements (especially molybdenum) to
disperse, by diffusion, uniformly throughout
the alloy, and

6.5.2 Carbon Behavior in
Ni-Mo-Cr-Ti Alloys

D.J. Bradley  J. M. Léitnaker

To understand and predict the properties of
titanium-modified Hastelloy N, a basic study in the
phase relationships has been undertaken. The
primary manpower funding for this portion of the
project is an ORAU Fellowship. The program is
divided into two parts: (1) preparation and character-
ization of specimens and (2) determination of the
phase relationships in the matrix and the precipitate.
The base aYloy has been divided into three suballoys
having the compositions (1) Ni-14% Mo—2%
Ti-0.1% C, (2) Ni-8% Cr-2% Ti-0.1% C, and (3)
Ni-2% Ti-0.1%C. A limited amount of work hasalso
been done with alloy 472-503, a small commercial

heat of 2% titanium-modified Hastelloy N, Three

~areas have been investigated as part of the sample

preparation and characterization portion of this
study. They are decarburization, precipitation rate,
and homogeneity of the material.

Decarburization is thoughttobea surface reaction
of the type

Ozabsorbed) + 2Cisolid sotutiony = 2CO .

In principal, this reaction can be easily controlled by
controlling the environment around the sample.
However, experience has shown that this is not a
simple task. Our work with decarburized samples has
shown a considerable variation of the lattice
parameter of the MC-type precipitate as a function of
bulk carbon concentration (Fig. 6.18). This can be
explained in terms of a lowering of the carbon

" activity, resulting in a carbon-deficient MC lattice.

Similar behavior can be expected from other alloys,
which explains the wide range of lattice parameters of
precipitate found in this system earlier.’ The carbon-
deficient MC phase identified in our samples is
probably not the equilibrium phase for the given
temperature and bulk composition, buta result of the
carbon sink at the surface. Long-term reannealing of
the decarburized material could then result in the
formation of a precipitate with an equilibrium
composition, which would not necessarily be MC..
Future experiments should show whether these

- suppositions are correct and should yield the exact

relationship between the metal-to-carbon ratio and
precipitate lattice parameter.

The furnace in which the decarburization took

place has been extensively modified. Decarburiza-
tion can be properly controlled now and possibly

used to advantage. Rather than using O, to
‘decarburize, a mixture of Ha(g) and CHa(g) will be
flowed through the furnace to prevent decarburiza- .

tion.

Homogeneous Alloys. The alloys used in this study
were fabricated in the usual manner with intermedi-
ate heat treatment at 1177° C. Subsequent metallo-
graphic examination revealed MC-type precipitate
stringers parallel to the workingdirection (Fig. 6.19).

These stringers represent a very inhomogeneous

distribution of the alloying elements; the precipitate
morphology can likely be better controlled if the
alloying elements are distributed more homogene-
ously. To thisend, alloys were annealed at 1260° C for
16 hrand then aged for 100 hrat 760° C. Previously, it
had been determined that 4 hr-was sufficient to
dissolve the stringers at 1200°C, The samples aged at
760° C were then examined metallographically (Fig.
6.20a—c).As the photomicrographs reveal, the string-
ers are now only present in alloy 1. The matrix of
alloys 2 and 3 contains small, evenly distributed MC-
type precipitates, but in alloy 2-a high density of
carbide stringers is evident. The alloy containing
molybdenum appearsto have a “memory effect” even
after 16 hrat 1260° C. A high-carbon sample of alloy
472-503 has also been examined, and the memory
effect was found to be still evident after 50 hr at
1170°C (Fig. 6.21). The conclusions are that

- molybdenum is responsible for the memory effect
and that, once formed, stringers in molybdenum-
containing alloys are extremely difficult to remove.

Precipitation Studies. Another part of the present
characterization studies has centered on the rate of
precipitation. Originally all the samples were cooled
in the cold zone of the furnace. Nonreproducible
solubility data and discrepancies from expected
behavior led to the postulation that precipitation was
occurring on cooling. To verify this postulation, two
sets of samples were annealed at 1200° C (Table 6.11).
One set was cooled by being pulled into the furnace
cold zone, and the other was cooled by dropping into

~ “Table 6.11. Effect of cooling rate on precipitation

an H,0-10% NaCl solution. The quantity of
precipitate would contain approximately 20 to 40%
of the carbon in the alloy. Thus, cooling in the cold
zone is not fast enough for measurement of
solubilities or the rate of solution of precipitates.
Our exploratory work on the solubility of carbon
does not appear to correlate with literature values.
Results reported by Stover and Wulff® on the nickel-
titanium-carbon system indicate that above 800°C,
an alloy containing less than approximately 2.5at. %

titanium cannot precipitate TiC even in the presence

of graphite. Alloy No. 3 contained only 2.3 at. %
titanium; yet TiC was identified in a precipitate
formed at 1170° C. Unfortunately this alloy appeared

o contain at all temperatures approximately 0.15 wt

% precipitate, which was amorphous (Table 6.12).
This amorphous material, which is now being
analyzed, has clouded interpretation of the present
results. New alloys are being prepared which should
not contain this material. _ _

Alloy No. 2 also appeared to contain ~0.15 wt %
amorphous material (Table 6.12). X-ray diffraction
of the precipitates yielded only weak TiC peaks. In

one case, no detectable diffraction occurred. Assum-
ing that the nondiffracting material in both alloys 2
and 3 was not TiC, the solubility of carbon in each
alloy is greater than 0.10 wt % at 1260°C. At 760°C
the solubility of carbon in alloy 2 was=0.05 wt %and
in 3 was >0.1 wt %.

The precipitate from alloy No. 1 gave large, sharp
diffraction peaks, even with very small amounts of
material. If it is assumed that the material was
stoichiometric TiC (Table 6.12), the solubility of
carbon was ~0.08 wt % at 1260°C. The precipitate
formed at 760°C could not be stoichiometric TiC,
since 0.73 wt % precipitate would require a bulk
carbon concentration of 0.14 wt %, and the alloy
contained 0.10 wt % carbon. Previous investigators
estimated that in titanium-modified Hastelloy N the
precipitate was approximately 60 wt % molybde-
num. : ,

A limited amount of work was also done on the
effect of the alloying elements on the matrix lattice
parameter (Table 6.13 and 6.14). It is hoped that
changes in the lattice parameter of the matrix can be
correlated with precipitation. Unfortunately, the

6.6 SALT CORROSION STUDIES
J._R. Keiser |

Studies of the corrosion resistance of potential
MSBR containment vessel materials (modifications
of Hastelloy N) have been carried out in both thermal
convection -and forced circulation loops. Results

| E J. Lawrence

- indicated a limited amount of mass transfer of

chromium from the hot to the cold portions of the
Hastelloy N systems, but the overall resistance of
Hastelloy N to molten fluoride salt corrosion is very
high. Unfortunately, Hastelloy N has been found to
be susceptible to irradiation embrittlement and to
grain boundary attack by fission products. Conse-
quently, investigations were begun with different
commercial and experimental alloys containing
compositional modifications to-Hastelloy N in order
to find materials that provide sufficient resistance to
the detrimental effects of irradiation and fission
products. Since it is necessary to ensure that these

‘new or modified alloys are resistant to fluoride salt

corrosion, most of the loops now in operation are
being used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of
these various materials. The status of the operating
thermal convection loops is given in Table 6.15. In

addition to these five loops, three others have been
built and are in varying stages of final preparation.
Because of the anticipated termination of the
program, these three loops will not be put into
operation.

6.6.1 Thermal Convection Loop Results

~ Thermal convection loops provide a very good
experimental tool for measuring the corrosion rate of
a material exposed to a corrosive medium under an
imposed temperature gradient. Removable speci-
mens permit periodic examination to determine
weight changes, and electrochemical probes permit
on-line measurement of the oxidation potential of the
salt and the concentration of impurities in the salt.

Thermal convection loop 23 is constructed of
Inconel 601, a material that has shown good
resistance to grain boundary attack by tellurium.
However, results have shown that Inconel 601

undergoes extensive corrosion in fuel salt, making ita

material with little prospect for use in an MSBR.
Because of the extensive corrosion which this alloy
has undergone by reaction with fuel salt, the U**/ U*
ratio of the salt has fallen to about 4, the most
reducing Ievel ever achieved in a loop. As reported
previously'™ it was decided to use this very reducing

salt to try to reproduce the results of Toth and

Gilpatrick,'' which predict that under the operating
conditions of this loop and in the presence of
graphite, UC; would be formed by the reaction

4UF; + 2C - 3UF + UC; .

In the first attempt to produce this reaction, pyrolytic
graphite was exposed to the salt for 500 hr, and no
UC; was found. In the second attempt a less dense
graphite was used and a new phase was detected
through x-ray examination. This phase was tenta-

tively identified as uranium oxide. A third set of

graphite specimens which has been kept free of
moisture is now undergoing a 2000-hr exposure and
is scheduled to be examined in March 1976.

Hastelloy N thermal convection loop 21A, which
contains MSBR fuel salt, has been used to obtain
baseline corrosion data. Sixteen Hastelloy N speci-
mens have been exposed a total of 10,009 hr.
According to theory, the weight change of these
specimens due to mass transfer of chromium, AM,
per unit area during time ¢, should be given by

AMx< C,\/Dt,

where C, is the initial concentration of chromium in
the alloy and D is the diffusivity of chromium in the
alloy. Figure 6.22 shows a plot of experimentally
determined weight ‘change, AM, vs the /1 for a
specimen near the hottest point of loop 21A, The
good fit of the data to a straight line provides further
evidence of a diffusion-controlled corrosion mechan-
ism. A new set of specimens fabricated from 1%
niobium-modified Hastelloy N has been inserted into
the loop and will be used to obtain corrosion data for
that alloy. ‘

Thermal convection loop 31 is constructed of type
316 stainless steel, has 316 stainless steel specimens,
and contains LiF-BeF; (66-34 mole %) salt. For the
first 1000 hr of operation, this loop was used to gather
baseline corrosion data with “as-received” salt.
Subsequently, reductant (beryllium) was added to
the salt at the level of about 0.1 mg Be/cm? salt. New
specimens were then inserted, and the corrosion rate
has been measured for stainless steel in this reducing
salt. Addition of beryllium made the salt quite
reducing, but once the source of beryllium was
removed, species in the salt were no longer in
equilibrium and the salt became progressively more
oxidizing with increasing time. While the source of
berylhlum was in the salt, the corrosion rate was
extremely low. However, after removal of the
beryllium the specimen in the hottest position
showed a pattern of increasing weight loss as a
function of time. The increasing corrosion rate was

the first six months of 1975 to obtain baseline
corrosion data under conditions where the U*'/ U**
ratio was about 100. A maximum corrosion rate of
~2.5 mg/cm’year (—0.11 mil/year) was reported
after a total of about 3200 hr of a planned 4000-hr

566, 635, and 704°C the corrosion rates were 0.0,

~ —0.2, and —2.3 mg/ cm®-year respectively. This rate of

corrosion is well within the limit that could be
tolerated in an MSBR.

It was planned to adjust the U*'/U* ratio of the
salt upward to 1000 by means of NiF: additions

- followed by a 4000-hr corrosion test in the more

oxidizing salt. Several NiF; additions were made,
and the U*/U* ratio did increase; but another leak
occurred before the ratio reached 1000. This leak was
repaired, but shortly after operation was resumed, a
third leak occurred. Because of plans to terminate the
MSR Program, it was decided to forego further

‘testing of standard Hastelloy N and to use the loop to

gather baseline corrosion data on 1% niobium-
modified Hastelloy N, an alloy that shows improved
resistance to tellurium grain boundary -attack.
Specimens were inserted at the end of February and

- will be removed periodically for exammatlon

mens exposed to LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) salt at the indicated -

temperature. Surfaces areas of the specimens were approxi-
mately 3.4 cm?.

After each of the three leaks, a section of tubing
containing the failure was removed, and new tubing
was welded into place. These failed sections were
examined metallographically. Figure 6.25 shows the

‘appearance of the '-in.-OD tubing at the site of the

first leak. This leak occurred at a 90° bend on the
outermost portion of the tubing. Examination of a
transverse section of the tube (Fig. 6.26) showed
extensive cracking in the vicinity of the leak, and the

of the failﬁre shown in Fig. 6.25. Inside diameter of tube on the lower side and

 
 

 

longitudinal section (Fig. 6.27) showed that these
small cracks ran parallel to the axis of the tube. The
presence of a shorted heater and a burned-out
thermocouple on the section of tubing where this
failure occurred provides additional support for the
conclusion that this failure resulted from a combina-
tion of excessive temperature and low stress for an
extended time. This leak possibly could have been
avoided if the tubing had been annealed after bending
or if the temperature had been maintained in the
desired range. This contention is further supported
since sections of the failed tubing which had not been
severely stressed during bending did not show
cracking and since examination of a nearby 90°
elbow that had been operated at the proper
temperature showed no cracking even in the most
severely deformed regions. However, the length of
tubing involved would have made annealing difficult,
and changing the thermocouple would have required

~drainage and shutdown of the loop.

- The second failure occurred ina straight sectlon of
res1stance-heated tubing; the appearance of the failed
section is shown in Fig. 6.28. Transverse and

80

‘Jongitudinal sections of the failure (Figs. 6.29 and

6.30 respectively) show a single crack. The transverse
view shows evidence of necking or reduction of area
indicative of a fairly large stress. A high stress could

" have occurred during heating of this region if salt

were trapped there between two frozen salt plugs.
The third failure occurred at a weld joint in one of
the specimen access positions (Fig. 6.31). Metallo-
graphic examination of the failure showed one
crack, which probably occurred when a high stress
again resulted from heating trapped salt (Fig. 6.32).

. As reported by Huntley in Sect. 2.3.1, modifica-

tions have been made to the loop to prevent develop-
ment of frozen sections.

in. long X ' in. wide X 0.035 in. thick have been
exposed to flowing steam (approximately 1000 1b/hr)
for 21,000 hr. The various alloys of modified
Hastelloy N have thin, adherent oxides, with no
evidence of spalling. Some of the Croloy type steels
are beginning to develop blisters and some of the
blisters have cracked, but none of the specimens have
spalled at this time. The weight changes had
increased approximately 0.5 mg/cm’ overa period of
4,000 hr, as reported previously,'? but they decreased
during the last 2,000 hr (two weighing periods), until
some of the specimens are approaching the rates
previously established. Some of the specimens have
weight changes still slightly above the previous rates,
but apparently some of the deposited materials are
being removed. | |
The weight change behavior correlates well with
the steam quality and with observations by Bull Run
engineers. Several leaking condenser tubes were
sealed off during the ten-week shutdown in the latter
part of 1975, and the steam quality improved
considerably. No condenser leaks had been experi-
enced before 1974, but several occurred during 1974

and 1975. During the shutdown the condenser tubes
were ultrasonically inspected, and any tube whose
wall thickness had been reduced by 35% was sealed
off on both ends. The condensers were sized such that
a certain percentage of the tubes could be sealed off
and the condenser still perform satisfactorily. The
condenser tubes are constructed of admiralty brass,
and corrosion occurs near baffles in the regions
where droplets can form and then evaporate. This
leads to an increased concentration of impurities -
(such as chlorides) and can cause corrosion even
though the bulk concentrations may be in the low
parts per million or parts per billion range. The
manufacturer of the condensers has made some
recommendations to remedy the problem, such as
water injection to wash the tubes in this area. The
effect of plugging some of the condenser tubes is to
shift the position of the vapor-to-droplet area of high
corrosion to another location in the condenser, thus.
exposing areas of the tubing that have had less

‘corrosion and exposing the corroded areas to a less

corrosive condition. Some experimental condenser
tubes of Cu-10% Ni do not exhibit as much

 
 

 

susceptibility to this type of corrosion as the
admiralty brass. These have been proposed for
replacement tubes and should relieve the problem.
Two heats of standard Hastelloy N tubing (N1
5095 and N2 5101) are being evaluated in the stressed
condition from 28.0 X 10° to 77.0 X 10> psi. The
specimens of both heats in the annealed condition (1
hr at 1177°C) have shorter rupture times in steam
than in argon. Specimens of heat N1 5095 tested in
the as-received condition and stressed below 50.0 X
10° psi in steam have rupture times equal to those of

84

specimens tested in_argon. Figure 6.33 shows the
stress-rupture properties of heat N1 5095. As
reported earlier,” flaws in the specimens may have
contributed to the scatter, but at stresses <50.0 X 10°
psi, where wall thicknesses are heavier, there appears
to be no significant effect of steam on the rupture
time. Two of the specimens stressed at 28.0 and 40.6 X
10’ psi have an accumulated 15,000-hr exposure to
steam at 538°C without rupture, and three others at
slightly higher stresses have from 10,000 to 11,000 hr
of exposure. Figure 6.34 shows the stress-rupture

annealed condition tested in steam have shorter
rupture times than specimens tested in argon.
Specimens in the as-received condition tested in
stecam have rupture times equal to or greater than
specimens tested in argon. The longest rupture time
of this heat to date was 12,000 hr for a specimen
stressed at 48.8 X 10’ psi in steam at 538°C.

The minimum creep rates of both heats of material
were plotted as a function of stress (Fig. 6.35). The
creep rates are calculated from plots of diametral
strain, AD/ D, vs time, which are based on measure-
ments of the internal diameter of the specimens at
1000-hr intervals. There is considerable scatter in the

data because of difficulty in measuring the internal

diameters at the point of maximum strain, but the

figure is useful as an indication of the strain rates -

expected in this stress range. Buildup of scale on the
inside diameter exposed to steam also contributes to
the inaccuracy of this method since the apparent
strain is reduced as the scale thickens,

6.8 VAPOR PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS
~ OF METAL TELLURIDES

S.L. Bennett  J. Brynestad

Screening tests were performed to establish
whether standard and modified Hastelloys are

85

embrittled by exposure to tellurium activities defined
~ by the system NisTea(s) + Ni(s) at 700°Cand 750°C; a
knowledge of the tellurium activity (i.e., vapor
‘pressure) under these conditions is important.
Arrangements were made to attempt to obtain vapor
pressure measurements over the two-phase system of
nickel plus NisTe; at 700° C by mass spectrometry at
Y-12. However, the sensitivity of the instrument was
far from satisfactory; a temperature of 850°C was
required in order to begin to observe the species Te
and Te,. The experiment did confirm, however, that
tellurium monomer and dimer are the only gaseous
species present in this system, in accordance W1th the
observations of Weaver and Redman."

Since measureable weight losses were observable
with the Mettler Recording Vacuum Thermoana-
lyzer at about 800°C and above, quantitative vapor
pressure measurements are being made by this
technique. The Knudsen effusion equation,

Py, =(mq, [44.33 at) (T/Mz, )' 1, )

relates the partial pressure of the species to the mass
of that species of molecular weight M which effuses in
time ¢ through an orifice of effective area a at
temperature 7. A similar expression can be written in
terms of the Te monomer. The dissociation equilib-
rium

Texg) = 2Te(g) , @

for which the equilibrium constant K, = Pr’/ Pte.,
must be simultaneously satisfied. Letting m=mr., +
mre, one can derive the relationship

Py, = {[Kp/8 +(m/44.33 at)(T/MTez)l 12112

—&,/9'2Y . 3

That is, the partial pressure of one species can be
expressed in terms of the experimentally measured
total mass loss m and the equilibrium constant. The
equilibrium constant as a function of temperature is
calculated from Eq. (4):

—RT9K, = D® + T2IGs° ~ Ho) T,
- (G’ - Ho°)/T]Te2} , 4
where the (Gr HoO)/ T terms are the' free energy

functions' and Dy’ is the enthalpy of dissociation of
Te; at 0°K.'¢

 
 

86

The samples are contained in tungsten liners inside
a high-density graphite (POCO Grade AXF-5Q)
Knudsen cell. The effective orifice area is the product
of the cross-sectional area, measured by a photomi-
croscopic technique, and the Clausing factor, the
latter being a function of the ratio of the length to the
radius of the orifice."”
? Silver was vaporized over the temperature region
' 975 to 1320°C, representing a pressure range of 2'/;
orders of magnitude. The derived enthalpy at 298°K,
AH»s5", of 67.0 kcal mole™ is in good agreement with
the literature value of 67.9 kcal mole™,"® verifying the
temperature measurements and the general tech-
nique. :
So far, three experiments have been done with th
system Ni;Te: plus nickel over the temperature
region of 800 to 1000° C with various effective orifice
! areas. The logarithm of the calculated Te, partial
pressures vs reciprocal temperature is shown in Fig.
6.36. If the orifice area is too large, then equilibrium
may not be achieved, and the calculated pressures
may be too low (Fig. 6.36). Reducing the effective
- orifice area by a factor of 10 resulted in Te; pressures

the effective orifice area an additional factor of 2.5,
the Te: pressures remained unchanged within
experimental error. Hence it seems that equilibrium
has been achieved in the latter two experiments; some
confirmatory experiments are planned for even
smaller effective orifice areas. If we tentatively accept
the data obtained with an effective orifice area 0f 2.91

extrapolation of the data to 700°C gives Pr1e. = 8 X

6.9 OPERATION OF
METAL-TELLURIUM-SALT SYSTEMS

J. R. Keiser E. J. Lawrence

The intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N which
was observed in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
has been shown to be caused by the fission product
tellurium. Because the rate of cracking observed in
the MSRE might not be acceptable over the 30-year
design life of an MSBR, it was concluded that the
MSBR primary containment vessel material should
have improved resistance to grain boundary attack
by tellurium. To evaluate various alloys and
modifications of Hastelloy N for their resistance to
tellurium attack, it was necessary to develop tests that
would simulate the appearance of tellurium as a
fission product in the fuel salt of a reactor. Five
experiments are now being conducted to learn more
about the behavior of various tellurium compounds
in salt and to determine the effect of these telluride-
salt mixtures on potential containment vessel materi-
als.

6.9.1 Tellurium Experimental Pot No. 1

This system was built to evaluate the use of lithium
telluride asa means for adding tellurium to salt which
would simulate the production of tellurium by
fission. The pot was constructed to permit periodic
additions of salt pellets containing small, measured
amounts of lithium telluride.

For the first experiment, Li,Te was used in the
pellets that were added to the LiF-BeF.-ThF, salt in
the pot.” No evidence of a soluble tellurium
specimen was found by either chemical analysis or
electrochemical examination.*® A second experiment
was conducted using the reportedly more soluble
lithium telluride, LiTe;. After the pot had been
drained, cleaned, and fresh salt added, three pellets
containing a total of about 0.1 g of LiTes were
inserted. During the following three weeks, electro-

 
 

 

 

chemical examinations of the salt by D.L. Manning

87

~ mechanism, electrochemical probes, and five access

of the Analytical Chemistry Division revealed no

indication of a soluble tellurium species. Since other
experiments had shown that metal specimens could
be embrittled by tellurium even when tellurium levels
in the salt were below chemical detection limits, a
Hastelloy N tensile specimen was inserted into the
salt and three additional LiTes-salt pellets were
added. After about 500 hr the specimen was removed
from the salt, tensile tested to failure, and examined
metallographically. Intergra.nular cracking, most
probably due to tellurium, was found, indicating that
'a mechanism exists for transport of tellunum or
LiTe; through the salt.

1692 Chromium Telluride Solubility Tests
The originz«il purpose of this test pot was to
measure the solubilities of CraTes and Cr,Tes in LiF-

BeF,-ThF salt. First,additions of CrsTe, were made,
and later additions of Cr,Te; were added. Appropri-

ate salt samples were taken at various temperatures,

together with follow-up double checks with filtered
samples; the results showed that, within the limits of
chemical analysis, these compounds were not soluble
in salt. However, Hastelloy N specimens exposed to
these chromium telluride-salt - mixtures, when
strained, cracked intergranularly and showed evi-
dence of tellurium on crack surfaces when examined
with Auger electron spectroscopy. Cons_equently, it
was decided to expose additional specimens for

Auger studies. Eight specially prepared specimens

were inserted in the Cr,Te;-salt mixture, and one was
removed every 24 hr. The examinations of these
specimens are described in Sects. 6.10 and 6.11.

. Because of the high rate of attack on specimens in

ports for insertion of specimens. In late February the
pot was filled with about 44 kg of LiF-BeF-ThF,
salt, and a mixture of Cr;Tes and CrsTes was added.
Specimens of 19 alloys have been inserted for a 250-
hr exposure, with duplicate sets in the salt and vapor
regions. Further studies of potential containment
materials will be carried out during the next few
months. :

6.9.4 Ni:Te; Capsule Test
Results ‘feported by Brynestad”' indicated that a
Hastelloy N specimen exposed to vaporabove Ni;Te;
+ nickel for 1000 hr .at 700°C did not show

mtergranular cracking. This suggests that the NisTe;
+ nickel system has a tellurium activity at which

* Hastelloy N is not attacked. To further evaluate this

~and examined metallographically.

the salt containing Cr,Te;, a second test was started

using Cr;Tes, which has a lower tellurium activity.

- Several modified Hastelloy N alloys with different

combmatlons of niobium, titanium, and chromium

were exposed to the salt-CriTes system, Eight
-standard Hastelloy N specimens for Auger studies
“were exposed to the salt and one was removed every
48 hr for the purpose of gainifig information about

the rate of tellurium attack. All specimens were

“submitted for examination, and the results are given
in Sects 6.10-6.12.

6.9.3 Tellunum Screemng Test

A large pot has been constructed for exposing a
large number of specimens to a salt-tellurium system
in order to compare the resistance of various alloysto
tellurium attack. The pot is equipped with a stirring

potentially significant result, a test was designed to
expose Hastelloy N tensile specimens to salt

containing Ni;Te; + nickel. A capsule was built and

filled with LiF-BeF,-ThF, salt. A mixture of 62at. %
nickel-38 at. % tellurium which had been given a
high-temperature anneal to promote formation of
NisTe; was added to the capsule, and four Hastelloy
N specimens were inserted. One specimen was
removed after 1000 hr at 700°C, strained to failure,
Contrary to
Brynestad’s earlier results, extensive intergranular
cracking was found. At present, the Ni;Te; + nickel

mixture is being checked to be certain it contains no

unreacted tellurium which would give an anoma-
lously high tellurium activity, If the telluride checks
out satisfactorily, it must be concluded that even the
low tellurium activity associated with nickel+ Ni;Te;
causes intergranular attack of Hastelloy N.

6.9.5 Chromium-Tellurium-Uranium
Intcractlon Experiment

The research effort to solve the problem of

 tellurium intergranular attack of Hastelloy N has

been almost solely concerned with the development
and testing of new alloys The four experiments

previously descnbed in this section are part of the
alloy testmg program. The possibility of a chemical

change in the salt which could alter the extent of

~attack by tellurium is another manner in which this

problem may be 'approachcd It has been suggested
by Brynestad that since the chromium activitycanbe

- controlled within a certain range by the U*/U*

ratio, it might be possible to control the telluriuin .
activity by the reaction:

In this equation, “CrTe” is used to denote a telluride
species having activity low enough not to promote
intergranular cracking.

To check. this hypothesis, a salt pot was bmlt
equipped with electrochemical probes, and filled with
MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF.-UF.). The oxida-
tion potential and the impurity content of the salt
were monitored.* Additions of CrF2 and CrsTes were

‘made, and a Hastelloy N specimen was exposed for

500 hr to salt with 2 U*/U* ratio of .about 90.
Metallographic examination of the specimen after

~ deformation showed extensive cracking. To lower

the oxidation potential of the salt, a beryllium rod
was immersed in the salt for an hour, after which time
the U"'/ U™ ratio had decreased to about 7. Another
specimen will be exposed to the salt-telluride
mixture, and a comparative evaluation will be made
of the extent of intergranular attack.

6.10.1- Sample History

A piece of thin Hastelloy N (heat 5075) sheet was
attached to a strap on the fourth group of surveil-

lance specimens which was exposed to the MSRE

core 7203 hr at temperatures above 500°C. The
material was rolled to a thickness of 100 pm and
annealed 0.5 hr at 1180°C prior to insertion in the
MSRE. The chemical composition of the material is
given in Table 6.16. The total thermal neutron
fluence is estimated to have been 5.1 X 107
neutrons/cm’, and a detailed account of the thermal
and radiation history of this group of surveillance
specimens can be found in ref. 22. About 6000 hr of

~ the exposure was at 650°C, and 3000 hr was in

contact with fuel containing fresh fission products:
The foil was wrapped around a thicker HastelloyN

- strap to hold it in place; thus the outside of the foil

. the test reactor was terminated revealed that all

surfaces in contact with the fuel salt were embrittled
to depths of 100 to 250 zm. Investigations of samples
from the MSRE and bench tests gave strong support
to the hypothesis that the fission product tellurium
caused the embrittlement by diffusion preferentially

-along the grain boundaries where it caused grain

boundary embrittlement.* However, it was not

possible at that time to provide conclusive direct
evidence that tellurium caused the observed embrit-
tlement.

A piece of Hastelloy N foil about 100 um thick
which had been attached to one of the surveillance
assemblies was severely embrittled by exposure in the
MSRE; this accurrence provided an opportunity to

- use recently developed high-résolution Auger elec-

tron spectrosoopic techniques to ‘determine the

_ composition of the grain boundaries in some detail,
as described below.

was exposed to flowing salt and the underside to salt
that flowed less rapidly. The foil was severely
embrittled and broke while being removed from the
strap. Micrographs of the foil are included in ref. 22.
In some bent areas, cracks formed which often
extended completely through the foil. The sample
used in this study was from a straight unstressed
region which presumably had few, if any, open
cracks. Detailed examination confirmed that thearea -
examined was indeed a fresh fracture not previously
open to air.” The size of the sample was about 0.3 cm
wide X 1 cm long X 100 um thick. The sample
radioactivity was less than 1 R/hr at contact.

6.10.2 Sample Fracture and Analysis Techniques

The sample was extremely brittle and was
therefore easily fractured by applying a bending force
in the protective ultrahigh vacuum environment of
the Auger analysis system. The residual gas pressure
in the system was below 1 X 107'% torr at the time of
fracture, and the release of helium as the sample
fractured was monitored to provide an estimate of

the concentration of helium in the grain boundaries.

The system used for these studies has been descrlbed
. previously.** -
The Auger analysis of the sample began Wlt_hm a

few minutes after the fracture to avoid errors due to
absorption of gases on the fracture surface. An
electron beam about 5 um in diameter with a current
of ~0.5 pA at 4 to 10 keV was used for these
measurements.

6.10.3 Observations

Figure 6.37 shows the helium partial pressure in
the system during the time of the fracture. Under the
conditions of this measurement the initial increase in
helium pressure times the volume of the system gives

‘the amount of helium released. The exponential

pressure decay after the fracture is simply the

characteristic system pump down for helium after
admission of the gas pulse and is in agreement with
the previously measured rates. The amount of gas

released was enough to fill 3.4% of the grain.

boundary sites exposed if we assume a surface

roughness factor of two (i.c., the actual area of the

fracture is assumed to be twice as large as the cross
section of the sample since the fracture surface is not
smooth and planar).

_carbide precipitate particles. There is no evidence of
deformation in these micrographs. The fracture is
apparently along the interface between the matrix
and the carbide precipitates rather than through the
carbides. This was confirmed by the change in the
composition as a function of depth below the
exposed fracture surface.

Several types of Auger analyses were made
including (1) two-dimensional elemental maps,

" which can be directly compared with scanning
electron micrographs; (2) line scans, which are
graphic outputs of the Auger signal strength as a
function of position along a line across the sample;

- and (3) complete Auger spectral analysis in a selected
area of the sample surface. These measurements
become progressively more quantitative in the order
listed. Reference 23 has a complete set of the maps,

show similar distributions, while the nickel map
shows a distribution somewhat complementary to
that of molybdenum and tellurium. This is best seen
in the central region slightly to the right and left of the
area labeled 1. The similarity of the tellurium and
molybdenum distributions and the complementary

“nickel distribution is easily seen in the line scans

to remain on the observed surface while others are partially pulled out and still others appear to have adhered to the other half of the
fracture interface. This would be expected when the adhesion of the particles is more or less equal between the grain on either side of
the boundary. This adhesion is quite likely a function of crystallographic morphology, depending perhaps on the details of tellurium
embrittlement as well as the mechanical properties of the embrittled interface. None of the particles appcar to be fractured; instead,
they have separated from the matrix. The particles in this region appear to be more or less equiaxed, while those shown in Fig. 6.38

6.10.4 Discussion of Observanons

 The release of helium from this sample when it
fractured was estimated to be sufficient to fill about
3.4% of the grain boundary sites exposed by the
fracture. The most likely sources of this helium is the
"“B(n,a)’Li reaction. Boron is present in the grain
boundaries of the Hastelloy N as the result of the
melting practice and heat treatment of the alloy prior
to irradiation and will also be concentrated in the
carbides formed during irradiation. This amount of

helium should not be enough to cause the observed
intergranular embrittlement at room temperature. If
it were, severe embrittlement would have been found
throughout the entire thickness of surveillance

- samples and other Hastelloy N parts from the

MSRE. This was not the case, and it can be

~ concluded that this level of helium in the grain

boundaries is not. severely detrimental to the
mechanical properties at room temperature.

. The fracture surface was completely intergranular.
There was no reduction of area at the fracture site,
and no significant plastic deformation was apparent
in the scanning electron micrographs. The appear-
ance of the fracture surface suggests that the grain
boundaries were filled with precipitates and that the

fracture occured between the precipitates and the

the particles were retained in the surface examined.
These areas are rich in molybdenum and carbon
(Table 6.17). In some areas, some particles have
apparently been pulled from the surface examined
(Figs. 6.38f and 6.39¢). Areas such as these tend to
have somewhat less molybdenum and carbon and to
be richer in nickel; hence the complementary nature
of the elemental images and line scans reveals the

precipitate particles. There is no doubt that these
precipitates are carbides since the fracture surfaces
are rich in molybdenum and carbon and the
concentrations of these elements remain high after
sputter etching (Table 6.18 and Fig. 6.43) which
indicates an average bulk composition in the vicinity
of the fracture surface consistent with the presence of
large amounts of carbide precipitates. The presence
of the carbides in the boundaries reduces the ductility
and tends to promote intergranular fracture, but not
to the extent observed here. Many samples of
standard Hastelloy N, including both irradiated and
unirradiated control samples, have grain boundaries
containing carbides and still retain elongations
greater than 30% and reductions in area greater than
209 (ref. 22). Many of the samples exposed in the
case of the MSRE show extensive intergranular
surface cracking while maintaining good overall
ductility, a fact which further supports the argument
that the carbide precipitation in the grain boundaries
is not the cause of the observed embrittlement. This
last observation also argues that a combination of
carbide precipitation and helium generation does not
cause the observed embrittlement. :

The Auger electron spectrum from the fracture
surface, Fig. 6.42a, shows the presence of large
amounts of tellurium. The concentrations reported in

‘Table 6.17. are based on the assumption of uniform

 
 

 

composition in the substrate. In the case of a

monolayer or less of contaminant on an interface that

is torn apart during the sample fracture, the
concentrations obtained would be too small by more
than a factor of 2. In this case the real concentration
at the interface could be substantially greater than 30
at. %. The composition-depth profile in Fig. 6.43
shows that the very large tellurium concentration on
the as-fractured surface does not extend into:the
bulk; thus, tellurium is present in large amounts on
the fracture surface but is concentrated very strongly
at the grain boundary interfaces and may indeed be
present as a fractional monolayer at the grain
boundary. It is known from previous experiments®*
that grain boundaries in Hastelloy N can be
embrittled by tellurium at levels below those
observed here. No other fission products or other
embrittling agents were detected on the fracture
surface, and one must conclude that tellurium does
cause the observed intergranular embrittlement of
Hastelloy N in the MSRE.

6.11 HIGH-RESOLUTION FRACTOGRAPHY
OF HASTELLOY N ALLOYS
EXPOSED TO TELLURIUM

D. N. Braski

This investigation is aimed at providing additional

information concerning the mechanism of tellurium

embrittlement of Hastelloy N alloys. Of particular
interest were the fractographic details of samples

exposed in several different ways to tellurium. These

details were revealed by use of a modern transmission
electron microscope with a high-resolution scanning
attachment. The results for two standard Hastelloy N
(heat 405065) samples are presented first, followed by
the results for two modified alloys. Although
different delivery systems were used, the same
“tellurium source, CriTe4 at 700°C, was used in all

tests. After exposure to tellurium the samples were

tensile tested to failure at room temperature. During

the test a number of cracks opened up along the gage

~ lengths of the samples. The number and depth of
cracks were measured optically on metallographi-
cally prepared sections. Table 6.19 lists the alloy, heat
treatment, and tellurium exposure for each sample.

Details of the exposure tests may be found in Sects.

- 6.9 and 6.12. _ . _

The first sample, 7943, was actually a smaller
Auger spectroscopy specimen that was exposed for
190 hr to molten salt saturated with CriTes. A high-
temperature solution anneal was previously done on

95

this sample to grow large grains for the Auger studies.
After testing, the fracture mode was observed at
relatively low magnification to be intergranular (Fig.
6.44q). Tellurium was detected in area X by both
Auger and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
(EDS). Higher-magnification micrographs of area X
are shown in Figs. 6.44b and c. The nodular features
present on the surface were similar to those observed
“in other materials that failed from stress corrosion or
hydrogen embrittlement.® These nodular features
were probably corrosion products that contained
tellurium. Several faceted areas were also observed at
points A and B in Fig. 6.44c. Faceting is characteris-.
tic of brittle failure and has previously been observed
" in iron-tellurium alloys.”” Figure 6.44d is a higher-
magnification fractograph taken of area Y, in which
no tellurium was detected. This area displayed some
ductility during fracture, as evidenced by the dimpled
. surface caused by microvoid coalescence. The
microvoids were initiated by the particles located at
the bases of the dimples. These particles were
probably the MsC-type carbides that are usually
found in the grain boundaries of this alloy.
Standard Hastelloy N was also exposed to the
vapor above Cri;Te, at 700°C in a closed system (see
SN 13515 in Table 6.19 for conditions). The fracture
mode for this sample was complicated and difficult to
analyze. The central areas were dimpled (Fig. 6.45a).
Areas near the edge of the sample showed mixed
modes of fracture (Figs. 6.45b, ¢, and d). Near the
~ specimen edge in Fig. 6.45b, the first area resembles a
cleavage fracture with small steps. For the area
further in, the mode shows characteristics of ductile
fracture as evidenced by the dimples. At the base of
these dimples is unusual microfaceting (Fig. 6.45¢, at
X and what appears to be a second-phase or cor-
~ rosion product (Fig. 6.45¢ and d, at Y. This latter
~area also shows an unusual geometric faceting.
- Other, more conventional looking particles were
found in the same area (Fig 6.45b at Z); these may be
MC-type carbides or possibly corrosion. product.
Information on the composition and- structure of
these phases has not yet been obtained. Initial EDS
analyses did not detect any tellurium in any of these
~ areas, but that does not preclude the possibility of
small concentrations being present. _
Faceting has now been observed in both standard
Hastelloy N samples using two different tellurium
delivery systems and therefore may be a characteris-
" tic of tellurium embrittlement in this material. As
. mentioned previously, Rellick et al.>’ found extensive
faceting in an iron-tellurium alloy which was cooled
slowly from an austenitizing temperature of 925°C.

However, Henry et al.?® observed faceting in nickel
fractures after thermal treatments between 650 and
800°C. There was no tellurium present in the system
of these workers; they attributed the faceting to the
absorption of oxygen in the grain boundaries. Since
decarburized layers have been observed in some of
our Hastelloy N samples, it is possible that oxygen as
well as tellurium influenced the fracture mode near
the surface. Other evidence in support of this idea is
presented in Fig. 6.46. This micrograph was taken
from a transverse section of pilgered (tube-reduced)

205 titanium-Hastelloy N which had been heated at-

538°C for 6 hr and air cooled. This particular
treatment caused fire cracking of the material. Note
that the mode of cracking through the decarburized
layer was mixed transgranular and intergranular,
while it was entirely intergranular beyond the layer.
The difference in fracture in this case was probably
caused as much by the absence of carbides in the

grain boundary as by the presence of absorbed

oxygen. Thus, decarburization can be a factorin the
fracture mode of thermally treated Hastelloy N and
should be considered when interpreting the present
investigation.

The fractures of two modified Hastelloy N alloy
were compared. The first,alloy411, contained 1 wt %
niobium and was considerably more resistant to
tellurium attack than the second, alloy 413, which

‘contained 1 wt % niobium plus 1 wt % titanium

 

99

(Table 6.19). Both alloys demonstrated intergranular
fracture modes in the central portions of the samples
(Figs. 6.47a and b). One normally associates low
ductility with intergranular fracture, but alloys 411
and 413 had total elongations of 54.8% and 45.8%
respectively. The fracture surfaces illustrate this
ductile behavior by the dimpling on surfaces normal
to the tensile load and striations on the surfaces
parallel to the tensile load. The striations are
characteristic of an extended slip process or glide.
The areas more affected by the tellurium were at the
outside edges. Figure 6.48a shows fractographs of an
area near the edge of the 411 sample. The fracture
mode was also intergranular, but the surface features
reflect a more brittle behavior. Higher magnification
of this area showed the absence of dimples and the
presence of corrosion products (Fig. 6.485). The tiny
holes in this surface (Fig. 6.48¢) were created by the
pullout of carbide particles or possibly a corrosion
product. Tellurium was not detected on the surfaces
in Fig. 6.48 using EDS. Examination of alloy 413
near the outside fracture edge revealed a tendency for
this material to fail along the precipitate-matrix
interface of the grain boundary (Fig. 6.49). This series
shows an array of dendritic precipitates lying on the
grain boundary which were aligned preferentially in
crystallographic directions. The angles between

intersecting (111) planes. These are the habit planes
for the MC-type carbides which are found in the
alloy, where (111) MCJ|| (111) matrix. Evidence
suggests an epitaxial relationship between the
dendrite particles and the matrix (Fig. 6.49a). The
dendrite particles were found to end abruptly at the
ttvin boundary. Close inspection of the twin band
showed that similar particles were originally present

but were retained in the mating fracture surface. The

orientation of the peaks of the dendrite pyramids in
the twin band was opposite to those in the adjacent
area (Fig. 6.495). Since no tellurium was detected by
EDS in any of the areas in Fig. 6.49, one might
presume that only extremely small amounts of
tellurium are needed to weaken the grain boundaries.
This conclusion agrees with Auger spectroscopy
studies® that find tellurium in small quanties (<10 at.
%) and monolayer thicknesses on tellurium-exposed
Hastelloy N fractures. »

In summary, high-resolution scanning electron

microscopy has characterized the fracture surfaces of

several Hastelloy N samples which had been
embrittled by exposure to tellurium at 700°C. The
central regions, which were apparently not affected
by the tellurium, generally demonstrated a highly
ductile intergranular failure. Regions near the outer
edge (the specimen surface} were affected by the

tellurium exposure and failed in a brittle intergranu-
lar mode. Minute features of the fracture surface in
this latter region varied among alloys; these features
included microfaceting, cleavage, and a number of
unusual second-phase particles and corrosion prod-
ucts. The observation of faceting in Hastelloy N is
particularly interesting because it has been seen by
other investigators in iron-tellurium alloys. The
effect of oxygen, either absorbed in the grain
boundary or involved in decarburization, may also
have influenced the fracture mode at the outer edge.

 Tellurium was detected by EDS on the fracture

surfaces of one 405065 sample exposed to molten salt
plus CrsTes, but was not found in the same alloy
exposed to Cr;Tes vapor or the tetanium-modified or
titanium plus niobium-modified alloys.

6.12 METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF
SAMPLES EXPOSED TO TELLURIUM-
CONTAINING ENVIRONMENTS

Samples of modified Hastelloy N were exposed to
tellurium-containing environments. These samples
were deformed to failure at 25° C, a procedure which
forms surface cracks if the grain boundaries are

brittle; a metallographic section of each sample was
prepared to permit determination of the extent of
cracking. These tests have two objectives. The first is
to develop a method for exposing samples to
tellurium to produce a reaction rate comparable to
that anticipated for an MSBR. This rate is thought to
be a flux of tellurium of about 10'°atoms cm™ sec™".
The second objective is to compare the cracking
tendencies of various alloys of modified Hastelloy N.

The method used for crack counting and measur-
ing was described previously, and data were
presented for ,several alloys.”® The experimental
conditions associated with the experiments to be

discussed in this report are summarized in Table 6.20.
The chemical compositions of the alloys studied are
givenin Table 6.21. In all cases the sample was a small
tensile specimen Y4 in. in diameter by 1.78 in. long

long. Unless specified otherwise in Table 6.21, the
specimens were annealed 1 hr at 1177°C in argon
prior to exposure to tellurium. The results of crack
measurements and data resulting from tensile tests at
25°C which were used to open the embrittled grain
boundaries are shown in Table 6.22.
Photomicrographs of the samples from experi-
ment 75-11 show that the extent of reaction for these

samples was within expected limits with no visible
reaction products on any specimens (Fig. 6.50). The
crack severity varied among the five specimens, with
the standard alloy (heat 405065) and one
titanium—-lanthanum-modified alloy (heat 474-534)
showing extensive cracking and the other three alloys
showing much less cracking. Inconel 600 was
observed previously to be more resistant to intergran-

ular cracking than standard Hastelloy N. The

variations among the three heats of modified
Hastelloy N are probably insignificant.

Experiment 75-12 was an evaluation of the
influence of grain size on the depth and frequency of
intergranular cracking. Samples of standard Hastel-
loy N (heat 405065) were made from Y-in.-diam
swaged rod and were given various annealing
treatments prior to exposure for 250 hr at 700°C to

the vapor above tellurium at 300°C. The specimens .

were then strained to failure at 25°C and sectioned

metallographically to determine the extent of -

cracking (Table 6.23). Photomicrographs of the
strained portions of the specimens (Fig. 6.51) can be
compared with etched views of unstrained portions
of the same specimens (Fig. 6.52). Such comparisons
show qualitatively that the frequency of cracking
decreases and the depth of cracking increases with
increasing annealing temperature (or increasing
grain sizes).

These trends may be defined quantitatively (Fig.
6.53). With small grain sizes the number of cracks is

proportional to L™"", and at larger grain sizes the

number of cracks is proportional to L%, (L is the

108

mean distance between grain boundaries.) The depth
of cracking goes through a slight decrease with the
first few low-temperature anneals but then increases
with increasing grain size. In the intermediate range
- of grain sizes the crack depth (average and maxi-
mum) is proportional to L. |
The specimens in experiment 75-13 were exposed
for 1000 hr to the vapor above tellurium metal at
* 300° C. This experiment is compared with a compan-
ion experiment (75-10) which operated for only 250
hr*® (Table 6.24). The comparison is made on the
basis of the product of the crack number and average
depth. The ranking of the alloys on the basis of this
parameter is similar for the two experiments. Alloy
413 looks considerably worse in the longer experi-
ment. There is a very distinct break between the
alloys modified with 2% or less niobium and those
containing various titanium and niobium combina-
tions. The alloys containing only niobium look far
superior to those containing niobium and titanium.
Photomicrographs of these specimens clearly reflect
the beneficial effects of niobium (Figs. 6.54 and 6.55).
Experiments 75-14 and 75-15 exposed specimens
to fluoride salt containing CriTes. Heat 405065, of
standard Hastelloy N, cracked more severely in
experiment 75-14 than did alloy 470-835, of modified
Hastelloy N (Fig. 6.56 and Table 6.22). Both
specimens showed some evidence of very shallow
surface reaction layers. In experiment 75-15 two
specimens were exposed, one containing nominally
1% niobium (alloy 411) and the other containing 1%
niobium and 1% titanium (alloy 413). The alloy

containing only niobium was more resistant to
intergranular cracking (Fig. 6.57). However, both
alloys formed surface reaction products and did form
cracks. '

In experiment 75-16, specimens of several alloys
were sealed in a capsule with CriTeq at 700°C and
exposed to the vapor above the Cr;Te4 for 1000 hr,
The appearance of the specimens after removal from
the capsule (Fig. 6.58) and the high weight gains
(Table 6.22) are indicative of the relatively high
reaction rate. Further investigation revealed that this
lot of Cr3Tes had not been sufficiently homogenized
since sufficient tellurium was present to be detected
by x-ray diffraction. Thus the activity of tellurium in
this capsule would have been quite high, resulting in
the observed high reaction rates. The extent of
cracking was quite severe in this experiment, how-
ever there were detectable differences among the

116

sections of several of the specimens are shown in Fig.
6.60. The depth and frequency of cracking vary
markedly in the various alloys.

In experiment 75-17 a standard Hastelloy N
specimen was exposed for 649 hr at 650°C to salt
containing LiTes. Electrochemical probes in this melt
failed to indicate the presence of a soluble tellurium
species, but the Hastelloy N specimen was embrittled
sufficiently to form intergranular cracks (Fig. 6.61).
. Experiment 75-18 used tellurium metal as a source
of tellurium, as was done in several other experi-
ments; but the tellurium activity was not reproduci-
ble, probably because the temperature of the

tellurium metal at 300° C could not be controlled. In

experiment 75-18, there was little evidence of

“reaction of the tellurium with the specimens. The

various alloys. The alloys are ranked on the basis of

the product of the number and depth of cracks (Table
6.25). The alloys containing additions of 0.45 to 2%,
niobium showed less extensive cracking, as did
Inconel 600 (alloy 600600). Alloys containing
titanium and various amounts of rare earth elements
showed somewhat more cracking. Photomicro-
graphs of the unstressed portions of the alloys show
reaction layers of varying thicknesses on all speci-
mens (Fig. 6.59). Photomicrographs of the strained

specimens after exposure (Fig. 6.62) had the same
colorations present before insertion into the capsule,
and the weight changes were extremely small (Table
6.22). The limited supply of tellurium into the region
of the capsule where the specimens were located
probably accounts for anomalous behavior of this
entire group of specimens.

Experiment 75-19 was run to examine the
influence of chromium content on the extent of
cracking in the basic Hastelloy N alloy. Four alloys

" containing from 7.4 to 14.5% chromium were

exposed to salt containing Cri;Tes for 500 hr at

Table 6.25. Ranking of alldys from experiment

700°C. The crack statistics (Table 6.22) and the
photomicrographs (Fig. 6.63) show that there wasno .

detectable influence of these variations in chromium
concentration on the severity of cracking.

In experiment 75-20, standard Hastelloy N was
exposed to salt containing NiiTe; at 700°C. The

crack statistics (Table 6.22) and the photomicro-

graphs (Fig. 6.64) show that the rrmtenal was

embrittled by the exposure.

In experiment 75-21, standard Hastelloy N was'
exposed to salt containing CriTes for 500 hr at
700°C. The specimen was positioned partly in the salt
and partly in the vapor. The sample cracked
extensively, with the cracking being much greater in
the portion exposed to salt (Table 6.22 and Fig. 6. 65).

In experiments 75-22 and 75-23, three alloys were
exposed to the vapor above Ni+ Nis;Te;for 2500 hrat
700 and 750° C respectively (Fig. 6.66). The cracking
statistics (Table 6.22) indicate several trends that may
or may not be significant. The frequency of cracking
is slightly less for all three alloys when exposed at

750° C compared with 700° C. The depth of cracking

appears greater at 750° C for two alloys and less for
one alloy. A clear trend at both conditions is that
alloy 295, which contains 0.85% niobium, formed
fewer and shallower cracks than the other two alloys
(Figs. 6.67 and 6.68).

In experiment 75-24, nine alloys were exposed for
287 hr at 700° C to the vapor above tellurium metal at
300°C. These specimens all exhibited small weight
gains and shallow crack formation (Table 6.22). The
alloys are ranked in Table 6.26 on the basis of the
product of crack frequency and depth. Alloys 450

and 518 had the poorest resistance to cracking. All

 the alloys with niobium additions but not titanium

had good resistance to cracking. No systematic
variation with niobium content was detected,
probably because of the very limited extent of
cracking in this rather short exposure. Alloys 523 and
524, which contamed more than the normal 7%
chromium, did not appear partlcularly good in this
test. Typical appearances of the specimens from this
experiment are shown in Fig. 6.69. |
‘Although these experiments involved several
techniques and methods for exposing specimens to

~ tellurium-containing enwronments they lead to four
- important conclusions. : S

1. Hastelloy'N modiﬁed' with about 0.5 to 2%
niobium has good resistance to embrittlement by
tellurium.

. Hastelloy N modified with niobium and titanium

has poor resistance to embrittlement, indicating
' that titanjum counteracts the beneficial effects of
- niobium.

. Although Inconel 600, whi_ch contains 16%
chromium, exhibited good resistance to tellurium
embrittlement, Hastelloy N modified to contain
15% chromium was not resistant to embrittlement
by tellurium.

. Although a soluble tellurium species was not
detected by electrochemical techniques in any of
the salt-telluride mixtures, standard Hastelloy N
was embrittled in all such systems.

6.13 SALT-TELLURIUM CREEP STUDIES
T.K.Roche  B. McNabb  J. C. Feltner

The eight creep-rupture machines for testing in
MSBR fluoride salt (LiF-BeF:-ThF:-UF,, 72-16-
11.7-0.3 mole %) are all now in operation. The test
program has been set up to run duplicate tests on
eachalloy, one specimen being tested in clean saltand
the other in tellurium-containing salt to obtain an
indication of susceptibility to embrittlement while

under stress in the presence of tellurium. Tellurium is
supplied to the salt by additions of milligram
quantities of Crs;Tes through valves in the top of each
salt chamber. Provision has been made for salt
sampling during the course of a test by drawing a
small quantity into a copper tube that can be inserted
into- the chamber and pushed below the salt level.
Also, these machines have been equipped with
electrochemical probes for making voltammetric
measurements to monitor U**/ U ratios of the salt
(Sect. 5.1, this report).

- At present, all tests are being carried out at 650°C
and 30.0 X 10’ psi. The alloys include both titanium-
and niobium-modified Hastelloy N. Two tests have

‘beeri completed on specimens of 2% titanium-

modified Hastelloy N (heat 74-533). A test in clean
salt and its counterpart in tellurium-containing salt
were discontinued after 4175 hr and 2380 hr
respectively. Approximately 150 mg of Cr;Tes was
added to the tellurium-containing salt test in a series
of three additions. About this same quantity hasalso

been added to other tests in progress. The salt from
these tests has been sampled for analysis, but resulits
are incomplete. Time-dependent strain measure-
ments recorded for tests completed or still in progress
in the salt environment are presented in Table 6.27.
The differences observed for any one alloy either with
or without tellurium being present are not considered
significant. The most significant part of these tests
will be the posttest metallographic examination to
determine the crack severity.

6.14 SALT PREPARATION,AND FUEL PIN

FILLING FOR MSR PROGRAM CAPSULE
IRRADIATION EXPERIMENT TeGen-2

M. R. Bennett A D Ke]mers

Fueled irradiation expenments were mmated in -
1972 to investigate the behavior of fission products,

particularly tellurium, on structural materials being

considered for the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor. The
fuel pins were made of 4-in, lengths of '/;-in.-diam
tubing of the various alloys under investigation and -

were filled with fuel salt containing **U. Preparation

750°C for 2500 hr (expenmcnt 75-23) and strained to failure. (a) Alloy

of these fuel pins required that a suitable sait charge
‘be prepared and transferred into the fuel pins and

_that the fuel pin be separated, sealed, and inspected

for subsequent irradiation. Because of the use of **U,

. these pins were prepared in a glove box in the
Plutonium Laboratory of the Metals and Ceramics
Division. .

-The first fuel pms were prepared in 1972, but the
MSR Program was discontinued before the pins were
irradiated. The glove box was retained, but much of
the equipment was disposed of. When the MSR
Program was reinstated in 1974, the facility for

preparing the fuel pins had to be rebuilt. The original
design for the salt preparation vessel was used, but
the design of the salt receiving vessel was modified
considerably. _

One batch of salt was prepared for filling several
pins. The individual sets of pins (six each) were
assembled in the salt receiving vessel by C. K.
Thomas and J. W. Woods of the Metals and
Ceramics Division. The operating work associated

129

with the salt preparation and filling the pins wasdone -

by W. B. Stines and W. H. Miller of the Metals and
Ceramics Division. Various chemical analyses of the
salt were performed by members of the Analytical
Chemistry Division. The filled fuel pins were made
available to C. R. Hyman of the Reactor Division for
assembly into an irradiation capsule.

The following material will cover the preparation
of the salt and the filling of the fuel pins for TeGen-2.
There are several other experiments in this series, and
some of the details concerning these experiments will
be discussed in Sect. 6.15. -

6.14.1 Salt Preparation

The fluoride fuel mixture for the TeGen-2
experiment was prepared in a nickel reaction vessel

fabricated from a 10-in. length of 2Y-in. IPS,
schedule 40 pipe in accordance with Dwg. M-10613-
RM-004E (Fig. 6.70). Following receipt of the vessel,
it was installed in the glove box furnace well (Fuel
Cycle Alpha Facility, Building 4508). A schematic of
the apparatus isshown in Fig. 6.71, and a photograph
of the gas delivery system is shown in Fig. 6.72.
Preparations were then made for loading the fuel
mixture. The total fuel mixture (714 g) consisted of
600 g carrier salt, "LiF-BeF,-ZrF, (65.4-29.6-5.0 mole
%); 73.0 g 2**UF,, and 41.1 g **UQ,. The carrier salt
contained “hafnium-free” (<20 ppm) ZrF. and
isotopically pure (99.9+%) "Li. The **UO; contained
less than 7 ppm #*U.

The following procedure was used to minimize
contamination of the glove-box and component
equipment duringaddition of the UF,sand UVQ,. Four
6-in. lengths of 5-in.-OD metal tubing were inserted
into appropriate lengths of flexible tygon tubing and
taped together securely. These, in turn, were taped
securely to polyethylene bottles, two containing the
carrier salt (half, or 300 g, in each bottle) and the
remaining two bottles containing the UF, and UOQO,.
By then adding the contents of each bottie through
the large riser of the receiving vessel in the order (1)

carrier salt, (2) UO,, (3) UF,, and (4) carrier salt, the

UF, and UO; were effectively “scrubbed” from the -

inside walls of the riser and covered with a layer of
carrier salt. :

After the riser-tube was recapped, the salt mixture
was heated to 600° C (melting point of 450° C) under
~200 sccm argon flow and sparged for I hr in
preparation for electrochemical measurements of the
oxide content of the salt by personnel of the
Analytical Chemistry Division. The oxide measure-
ment was done by retracting the sparge tube and
lowering a gold-iridium electrode to a depth of ', in.
into the molten salt. The volt-ammograms obtained
from these measurements were for calibration of an
experimental oxygen procedure and were not used in
the TeGen-2 preparation.

- 6.14.2 _Hydroﬂuorination

After the voltammetric measurements were made,
the sparge tube was lowered into the salt mixture, and

a 36-hr hydrofluorination was carried out at 600°C
using a HF-H: (20-80 mole %) mixture at a flow rate
of 500 sccm. The procedure stipulated a hydrofluori-
nation time of 48 hr; however, time scheduling
necessitated reducing this to 36 hr. At the end of this
time, the HF and H; flows were cut off, and the salt
was sparged with argon at about 500 sccm for 12 hrto
remove dissolved HF. Two samples of the salt melt
(one filtered and one unfiltered) were then taken and
submitted to the Analytical Chemistry Division for
an isotopic uranium assay, measurement of the

231 /%*U ratio, and determination of the concentra-

tions of total U, Fe, Ni, Cr, and oxide.

The analytical results for the uranium inventory
(Tables 6.28q, b,and c)were in excellent agreement
with the theoretical values, showing less than 10%
deviation. The discrepancies observed in the iron and
total oxide analyses are difficult to evaluate. It
appears unquestionable, however, that oxidation
occurred at some point during analysis of the No. I

samples since the No. 2 samples with considerably
lower oxide values were duplicates taken five days
later. ' - T T 1
In both cases the oxide content was too high to
continue with the next step in the operational
procedure, and further hydrofluorination was
required. The salt mixture was therefore reheated to
600° C under argon flow and hydrofluorinated with
HF-H; for-an additional 24 hr using the conditions
previously employed. Again, samples of the salt melt

were taken before and after the hydrofluorination.
As before, extreme care was taken during and after
the sampling to preclude the possibility of contact
with air; the results are shown in Table 6.29.

A comparison of the analytical data given in Table
6.29 with those obtained earlier (Table 6.28) gives
further support to the speculation that the discrepan-
cies in the data probably resulted from sample
contamination, probably with moisture, during
analytical procedures. The oxide content of both

samples taken prior to additional hydrofluorination
was lower by a factor of about 2 than that obtained
from identical samples taken previously from the
same salt. Also, the observation that the oxide
content remained relatively constant after an
additional 24 hr of hydrofluorination is difficult to
accept as valid, and it seems highly probable that the
actual oxide content of the final salt mixture was less
than 300 ppm.

6.14.3 U*/U* Ratio Adjustment

The U*'/U* ratio was adjusted by heating the salt
mixture to 700°C under argon flow and then
introducing hydrogen at 500 sccm for 6 hr. At the end
of this time, the hydrogen flow was cut off, and the
salt was sparged for 1 hr with argon at about 200

sccm. Preparations were then made for evaluation of
the U*'/ U’ ratio by retracting the sparge tube above
the salt level and lowering the gold-iridium electrodes
into the melt to adepth of s in. Analytical Chemistry
Division personnel then made volt-ammogram

* recordings. A final U*'/ U value of 58 (1.72% of the

total U as U*") was obtained, which was within the
desired range of 1.0 to 1.8% of the total U as U™
After retraction of the electrodes from the melt, the
salt mixture was cooled to room temperature under
argon and maintained in storage status for subse-
quent transfer to fuel pins.

6.14.4 Preparation of Salt Fill Vessel

A drawing of the assembled salt fill vessel is shown
in Fig. 6.73. The vessel is shown in two different
stages of assembly in Figs. 6.74 and 6.75. The salt is
first transferred to the short vessel in the center and
then pushed by gas pressure into the individual fuel
pins, with the overflow going into the long vessel. The
top Y2 in. of the salt from the fuel pins is then blown
back to the initial vessel where the salt can be
analyzed. The outer flanged vessel remains in place,
but a new inner assembly is made for each filling.

‘In preparation for receiving the salt transfer from
the salt preparation vessel, the salt fill vessel was
pretreated with hydrogen. The salt fill vessel was
heated to a temperature of 665°C under an argon
flow of about 200 sccm. The operational procedure
stipulated a pretreatment temperature of 700°C;
however, because of failure of one of the Calrod
heating units, the maximum temperature obtainable
was 665° C. The argon flow was cut off, and hydrogen
was allowed to flow through the vessel and pins at
about 500 sccm for 4 hr. At this time the hydrogen
was cut off, and the vessel was cooled to room
temperature under argon. All valves and connections
were then closed off. '

6.14.5 Salt Transfer

With both the salt preparation vessel and the salt
fill vessel at room temperature, a preshaped /s-in.-
OD nickel salt-transfer line was connected between

 
 

 

 

 

133

 

Fig. 6.73. Salt fill vessel.

the sparge tube exit of the salt preparation vesseland
the salt transfer inlet line to the salt fill vessel (Fig.
6.76). A 750-W Calrod heating unit was fastened
securely to the salt-transfer line, and the entire
assembly was then heavily insulated. With argon
flowing through, both vessels and the salt-transfer
line were heated to 650° C in preparation for the salt
transfer. The objective in this part of the procedure
was to transfer about 85 cm’ (203 g) of the salt
mixture from the salt preparation vessel into the
receiving reservoir of the salt fill vessel. A conductiv-
ity probe was positioned at a predetermined level in
the receiving reservoir to monitor the salt level.
Contact of the rising salt with the probe was indicated

by a red light on the instrument panel. At this point,

argon was allowed to flow through the bypass line
~ leading to the salt preparation vessel at a rate of
about 100 sccm (under 5 psig pressure). After the vent

valves of the salt fill vessel were opened, the bypass

valve to the salt preparation vessel was closed. Salt

was then observed to transfer as evidenced by

~ “smoking” of the insulation. Within about 1 min, the
red light went on, indicating completion of the
transfer. The argon flow was cut off, and the
appropriate valves were closed. A determination of

the salt level in the receiving reservoir was then made
by raising the probe and measuring the point at which
the red light went off. This was shown to be s in.
above the specified level, or the equivalent of a 7.6
cm’ excess of salt. The total transfer was thus about
92.5 cm?, which was less than 10% deviation from the
stipulated transfer volume of 85 cm”’.
In preparation for salt transfer from the receiving
_reservoir into the fuel pins, the temperature of the salt
fill vessel was reduced to 600°C, and argon was
flowed at a rate of about 25 sccm through the bypass
line leading to the receiving reservoir. The bypass line
valve was then closed, at which time the pressure
slowly increased to 5 psig. After a few minutes, the
pressure decreased slowly to zero, indicating comple-
tion of the transfer. This was confirmed by lowering
the conductivity probe into the receiving reservoir to
a position about ‘s in. from the bottom of the vessel
and observing that the red light failed to go on. All
valves on the salt fill vessel were then closed, and the
salt was allowed to equilibrate in the fuel pins for 24
hr at a temperature of 600°C. -
After 24 hr of equilibration, preparations were
made for transfer of excess salt in the upper regions of
the fuel pins into the electrode cup of the receiving

reservoir for final evaluation of the U*'/ U*' ratio. At
a temperature of 600° C,argon was flowed at a rate of
about 25 sccm through the bypass line leading to the
fuel pin overflow reservoir. The bypass line valve was
then closed, pressurizing the overflow reservoir to
about 5 psig. In less than | min, the pressure dropped
to about 0.1 psig, indicating that the salt had
transferred and that argon was bubbling up through
the salt in the receiving reservoir. The argon flow was
then cut off, and all valves to the salt fill vessel were
closed. After lowering the iridium electrode ‘2 in. into
the salt in the receiving reservoir cup, final determi-
nation of the U*/ U ratio was made by Analytical

Chemistry Division personnel. Interpretation of the
volt-ammograms obtained gave a U"/U’" ratio of
200 (0.5% of the total Uas U’"). It seems possible that
hydrogen pretreatment of the salt fill vessel and fuel
pins at the lower temperature (665° C) than the 700°C
stipulated in the operating procedure may have
contributed somewhat to the reoxidation of some of
the U™, , _

It was decided to make a second measurement of
the U*/U’" ratio since there was some uncertainty as
to the proper functioning of the instrumentation
during the volt-ammogram recordings. This was
done under the same conditions as the previous

determination. A U*'/U" ratio of 205 (0.49% of the
total U as U*") was obtained, which is in excellent
agreement with the initial value of 0.50%. Since this
value was considered acceptable, the salt fill vessel

~was cooled to room temperature under argon for

subsequent disassembly. All valves and connections
were closed, and the gIove box was then decontami-
nated '

6.15 SALT PREPARATION AND

FILLING OF TeGen-3 AND 4
H.E. McCoy  W. H. Miller
B. McNabb W. B. Stines

- The same salt prepared for the filling of TeGen-2
was used to fill the fuel pins for TeGen-3 and 4. The
same basic procedure was also used for transferring
the salt from the preparation vessel into the fuel pins,

but some changes were made which shortened the

“time required.

During the interval between the ﬁlhng of the pins
for TeGen-2 and for TeGen-3, the salt in the

- preparation vessel was under a positive pressure of

argon. Before the pins for TeGen-3 were filled, the
transfer line and the salt fill vessel (including the fuel

pins) were purged with hydrogen for 4 hr at 700°C.
~ The salt preparation vessel was then heated, and

approximately 100 cm? of salt was transferred into
the receiving reservoir. At this time the U/ U* ratio
was determined to be 0.001. The salt was transferred
into the pins and allowed to remain at 600° C for 8 hr.
The sample blown back for analysis did not indicatea
detectable change in the U*'/U* ratio. Although the
salt was more oxidizing thandesired, it was judged to
be suitable for these experiments. The salt fill vessel
was disassembled, the pins separated, closure welds

made, pins radiographed and leak checked, and the
pins given to the Reactor Division for assembly into
the irradiation capsule. |

It was decided that prior to filling the pins for
TeGen—4 the salt remaining in the preparation vessel
would be retreated with hydrogen to increase the
U**/U* ratio. Since the new salt fill vessel and the
transfer line were to be pretreated with hydrogen
also, the entire system was heated and pretreated with
hydrogen for 4 hr at 750°C. The U**/ U*" ratio in the
salt preparation vessel could not be determined,
probably because a conductive film had formed on
the surface of the salt. Approximately 100 cm’ of salt
was transferred to the salt fill vessel where the
U**/U* ratio was determined to be 0.010. The salt
was then transferred into the individual pins, held at
600°C for 8 hr, and partially transferred back to the
receiving reservoir. The U*/U* ratio was deter-
mined to be in the range 0 0.013 to 0.010. The salt fill
vessel was disassembled, the pins separated, closure
welds made, pins radiographed and leak checked,

and pins given to the Reactor Division for assembly

into the irradiation capsule.

6.16 OPERATION OF TeGen-2 AND -3
‘ C. R. Hyman

TeGen-2 and -3 are the second and third ORR
poolside experiments designed to irradiate prospec-
tive MSBR vessel materials. The experiments were
designed to produce a fission product inventory of at
least 5 X 10" tellurium atoms/cm? at the metal-to-
salt interface, together with a representative mix of
other fission products. The test device is an
irradiation capsule containing three Y:-in.-OD X
0.035-in.-wall, 4-in.-long tubular fuel pins, partially

filled with fuel salt. The three fuel pins in TeGen-2 _

were 2% titanium-modified Hastelloy, Inconel-600,
and titanium—lanthanum-modified Hastelloy for the
top, middle, and bottom fuel pins respectively. In
TeGen-3 the three fuel pins were 2% titanium—",%
niobium-modifed Hastelloy, 2% titanium-1%
niobium-modified Hastelloy, and 1% titanium-1%
niobium-modified Hastelloy for the top, middle, and
bottom pins respectively. The fuel pins were filled
with approximately 7.14cm’ of fuel salt, leaving a 'f>-
in. void at the top of the fuel pin, which was backfilled

o

 
 

 

 

 

 

with helium after salt filling. The fuel salt was a
mixture of LiF-BeF;-ZrF,-***UF-**UF, (63.5-29;0-
SOIOISmole%)

The fuel pins were arranged vertically inside a
double-walled type 304 stainless steel vessel. The void
between the fuel pins and the inner wall of the vessel
was filled with NaK for improving heat transfer. A
schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 6.77.
Small design changes were made in TeGen-2 and -3,
which should be noted. Small hubs were attached to
the end plugs inside each fuel pin, and four foils 0.005
X 0.125 X 0.375 in. were attached to each hub. The
bottom hub was solid and was0.265 in. in diameter X

137

0.125 in. thick. The top hub was 0.267 in. in OD X

-0.135 in. in ID X 0.125 in. thick. The foils and hubs -

for each fuel pin were made of the same material as
their respective fuel pin. The foils were included to
provide samples that could possibly have sufficiently
low activity for Auger analysis.

The capsules were instrumented with four
Chromel-Alumel thermocouples per fuel pin. One
electrical resistance heater was wrapped around each
fuel pin, with the heaters positioned to minimize axial
temperature gradients. The heaters also maintained
the fuel pins abouve 150° C during periods when the

- reactor was shut down and while the capsule was

irradiation but prior to hot cell disassembly. Fission
product decay radiation in frozen salt (<150°C)
causes dissociation of the fuel salt components at a
faster rate than recombination at that temperature.
At temperatures higher than this," recombination
exceeds evolution, and no net fluorine is generated.

The design operating temperature for the speci-
mens was 700°C at the salt-to-metal interface, and
this temperature was maintained as uniform as
possible over the length of the capsule throughout the

138

 

 

irradiation. Bulk temperature control was main-
tained by adjusting the experiment position with
respect to the reactor by means of the movable track
on which the experiment was placed in the ORR
poolside facility. This movement changed the
neutron flux at the experiment and thus varied the
fission heat produced. Fine temperature control and
uniform axial temperatures were attained by heater
power adjustment. A more complete description of
the experiment design may be found in an earlier
report.”’ Figures 6.78 and 6.79 are pictures of TeGen-

6.16.1 Operating History of
TcGe_n-Z and -3

TeGen-2 was installed into the ORR poolside
irradiation facility position P4A on November 3,
1975, and full-power irradiation began on November
4, 1975. The experimental assembly was irradiated
for a total of 1492 hr but was retracted away from the
reactor several times during this period. Irradiation
was ended on January 21, 1976, at which time the
experimental assembly was retracted to 16 in. away

from the face of the reactor. Since TeGen-3 was ready

during or after transfer of the NaK to the experimen-
tal assembly. To prevent this problem in the future,a
larger NaK carrier will be used and a better procedure
followed in filling the carrier from the source tank.

TeGen-3 was inserted on January 28, 1976, and
began full-power operation at design temperature on
January 30, 1976. Since that time, TeGen-3 has been
operating at design temperature. There have been
periods when the temperatures indicated by the
safety thermocouples Te-113, -114,-115 (Fig.6.77)at
the. bottom of the primary containment have
oscillated rather severely. The amplitudes of the
oscillations have been as high as 100°C, which is

removed, the gas lines of the TeGen-2 capsule were
cut one day before transferring it to the hot cell.
However, during this time the heater and thermocou-
ple instrumentation remained intact, and the heater
power kept the capsule at >150°C. On January 28,
1976, TeGen-2 was transferred to the ORR hot cell

retained.

At one time there was a 200° C drop in the readings
of the safety thermocouples of TeGen-3. The reactor

~and experiment were operating under unusual
- conditions when the drop occurred. The previous two

removing the capsule and transferring it to the hot -

cell, it was necessary to depressurize the gas systems
in the capsule. The secondary (argon) gas system was
depressurized with no problems, but the primary
(helium) system could not be depressurized. The lines
leading to and away from the capsule were depressur-
ized so that if only one plug existed, the capsule
would depressurize. Forward purging and back
purging were attempted, but the plug was not cleared.
Finally the gas lines were severed and welded. The
next day the capsule was transferred to the hot cell,
where dissassembly began. No unusual events or
physical characteristics were observed when the
experimental assembly was dismantled. The pins
appeared to be intact. ' |

TeGen capsules experienced temperature oscillations
that were probably due to NaK currents inside the

- primary containment. These currents were undesir-

able because they cooled the bottom of the capsule by
convection. The bottom fuel pin had an axial
temperature difference of approximately 70°C, and
the safety thermocouples were 50° C cooler than the
lowest thermocouple on the lower fuel pin. To
alleviate this problem, TeGen-3 was constructed with
a baffle positioned on the bottom of the lowest fuel
pin. However, the temperature distribution was
worse, with an axial gradient of 200° C on the bottom
fuel pin and the safety thermocouples about 100°C
cooler. These data, in addition to the oscillating
pattern observed, suggest that NaK currents may still
exist in the capsule. In any event, the temperature

~ abberations noticed have not posed any threat to the

The most likely cause of the plug inthe primary gas |
line was impurities in the NaK system. The carrier - -

used to transfer the NaK from the source tank to the
capsule filling apparatus was not filled with the
required amount of NaK and thus had to be refilled

two more times. In addition, the procedure for filling

the experimental assembly with NaK from the carrier
had to be done twice before the NaK fill was
completed. It is possible that during the filling of the
“carrier from the source tank, air may have been
introduced into the NaK. This would have formed
metallic oxides, which could have plugged the lines

‘experiment or to the reactor.

"~ 6.16.2 Data Analysis for
. TeGen-2 and -3

Tables 6.30 and 6.31 give typical operating data for
TeGen-2 and -3. The average temperature of TeGen-
2 over the length of the capsule was 693.7°C, which
corresponds to a fuel-salt to fuel-pin interface
temperature of about 700°C. In TeGen-3 the average

temperature is 677.3°C, and the corresponding.

~ interface temperature is a_pproxima_te_ly 684°C. The

‘maximum temperature variation occurs in the

~bottom fuel pin in each capsule. This variance occurs

because of NaK currents existing in the primary
containment. Even though TeGen-3 had a baffle to

- This last condition represents negligible gamma and

fission heat. 1

Figure 6.83 presents the design temperature
distribution in the fuel region of the pins where the
fission heat production is considered the major
source of heat flux. Figure 6.84 presents the

_temperature distribution in the heater region of the
pin and assumes no fission heat and an average heat -

rate of 26.5 W/g in the region of the heaters,
thermocouples, and NaK. The maximum amount of
power that a heater must produce was estimated from
the 26.5 W/g mentioned above to be approximately
300 W/heater. The actual heater power used during
operation was much less because of the conduction of
fission heat from the ends of the fuel pins.:

Figure 6.85 gives an estimate of the relative radial
temperature profile for the top, middle, and bottom
fuel pins respectively. Although exact temperature
distributions are not known, the differences in the
respective fission reaction rates in the fuel pins cause
the centerline temperatures of the middle and bottom

fuel pins to be higher than for the top fuel pin. As a
result, the temperature gradients in the fuel pins
differ substantially, radially as well as axially, and
therefore may influence the corresponding fission

_product deposition rates on the surfaces of the fuel

pins. This occurs in spite of having the same
temperature along the outside of the fuel pins. Note
that the temperatures at the surfaces of the fuel pins
are the respective averages of the lower three.

These thermocouple readings represent actual fuel

calculated as 163, 258, and 173 W for the top, middle,
and bottom fuel pins respectively. These were
calculated knowing heater powers, gamma heats,
thermal conductivities, temperatures, and several
other parameters and iterating the GENGTC fission
heat values to calculate the observed temperatures.
Values produced by this method of evaluating fission
rates will be compared with those produced from
neutronics support of TeGen-2.

The tellurium production was calculated from the
above estimates of fission heat rates. Assuming a
yield of 0.04 stable tellurium atoms per fission,
tellurium inventories of 1.21 X 10'%, 1.92 X 10", and
1.29 X 10" tellurium atoms were produced in the top,
middle, and bottom fuel pins respectively. Assuming
a surface area of 29.7 cm’ in contact with the saltand
an even deposition rate on all surfaces, the tellurium
deposition should be approximately 4.07 X 10'¢,6.46
X 10", and 4.34 X 10" tellurium atoms/cm?’ for the
top, middle, and bottom fuel pins respectively. These

values compare favorably with the design level of 5 X
10'® atoms/ cm’, More-detailed tellurium production
estimates will be made when the flux monitors from
the experiment are analyzed.

6.16.4 Future Irradiations

Future irradiation of capsules will be very similar
to that of capsules run previously in this series.
However, the baffle structure placed in the bottom of
the primary containment will be eleminated because
of the temperature profile and fluctuations seen in
TeGen-3. In future experiments, fine quartz wool will
be placed between the primary and secondary
containment to reduce heat radiation from the
bottom of the capsule. This insulation should reduce’
the heat loss and thus raise the temperatures in the
lower end of the capsule. The heater coils will be
arranged as they were in TeGen-2. -

6.17 EXAMINATION OF TeGen-2
B. McNabb  H. E. McCoy

The TeGen experiments were designed to evaluate
the resistance to cracking of several materials of

January 28. The operé_tting conditions of TeGen-2 are

reported in detail in Sect. 6.16.
Visual inspection of the disassembled equipment
showed the parts to be unchanged in their appearance

- after the irradiation. The top and bottom fuel pins of

interest to MSBR when they are exposed to molten -

salt containing fission products. The ';-in.-OD fuel -

pin is made of the material being evaluated. TeGen-1
containment materials consisted of type-304 stainless
steel, standard Hastelloy N, and Inconel 601. As

reported previously,’”** of the three materialstested,

Inconel 601 was the most resistant to cracking.
TeGen-2 is almost identical in design to TeGen-1,

~ but the fuel pin materials were 2% titanium-modified
- Hastelloy N heat 74533 (top fuel pin), Inconel 600

(middle fuel pin), and 2% titanium-modified Hastel-
loy N plus 0.013 lanthanum (bottom fuel pin). The
chemical compositions are given in Table 6.32. The
irradiation of TeGen-2 (approximately 1578 hr at
700°C) was concluded on January 26, 1976, and
disassembly in the ORR hot cells was done on

modified Hastelloy N (pin 2, heat 74533, and pin 6,

‘heat 74534, respectively) had a slight gold tint, and

the middle pin (pin 4, Inconel 600) had a silver tint
after annealing but before assembly in the experi-

- mental equipment. The top fuel pin had a small
" “scratch along its length, probably from a sheathed

thermocouple pulled across it during disassembly.
The small scratch did not affect the tensile properties
of rings cut from the pin and tensile tested, and it was
undetected in subsequent metallographic examina-
tion. After disassembly, the fuel pins were heated ina
small furnace 150° C or higher to prevent evolution of
fluorine from the fuel salt. The pins were maintained
at this temperature except during transfer to the High
Radiation Level Examination Laboratory
(HRLEL), during gamma scanning and measuring,

Each of the fuel pins had a spike of activity at the
top of the fuel salt; Fig. 6.88 showsa plot of activity vs
energy at the peak of the spike. Some of the fuel salt is
present in each of the scans at the top of the salt, as
shown by the high **La peak at 1.596 MeV in the first
three scans. These scans are similar to those at the
middle of the salt, except that the activity is slightly
higher at the peak. The fourth scan in Fig. 6.88 was
made on the third spike above the salt in the gas
plenum on pin No. 2, shown as point 11 in Fig. 6.86.

gas space. This curve is similar to the ones at the
bottom of the salt of the middle and bottom pins,
except for the lathanum peak, shown in Fig. 6.87.
The differences in these scans and the reason for
deposition in layers, leading to spikes of activity in
the gas space in the top pin, are not understood at this
time. Analytlcal Chemistry samples were taken from

these various areas, and the results may help to
explain the counting data.

Scans were taken in the gas space of each of the fuel
pins, but the peaks are similar to the one shown in

Fig. 6.88, scan 11, except that the activity was much

lower in areas not on activity spikes. Scans were also
made at the middle of the fuel of each pin, but they
were very similar to scan § at the bottom of the No. 2
fuel pin shown in Fig. 6.87. Analytical Chemistry has
a multichannel analyzer with a germanium detector
that can better separate the peaks of the different

fission products, and these analyses will better define

which elements are present.

The fuel pins were measured in HRLEL for

diametral change by using a V-block and dial gage
arrangement. Table 6.33 shows the changes in
dimensions to be very small, with a maximum  of
0.3% increase in the diameter in the gas space of pin 2
at the top. Prior to measuring, the pins had been
maintained at 150°C in a furnace, removed, and then
allowed to cool. It is possible that they were still
slightly warm when measured. An unirradiated
control pin measured in the same way showed a slight
negative change, -0.10%, and it had not been heated
previously. These changes are very small and are
probably not significant. The pins were sectioned in
the same manner as TeGen-1 by gripping the pinina

rotating chuck and using an abrasive cut-off saw, The
sections cut and their respective depositions are
shown in Fig. 6.89. The salt surfaces, or menisci, were
photographed during sectioning (Fig. 6.90). The salt.
level varied in pin 2. Since the salt level was higher in
pin 2 due to the void at the bottom, pin 2 was
photographed after cut A-2, and pins 4 and 6 were
photographed after cut A<4. The surfaces look
different for each of the pins, as did TeGen-1, but the
~-reason for these differences is not known. It could
possibly be related to slightly different cooling rates
for each fuel pin during solidification as they were
removed from the irradiation flux. Chemistry
- samples of the salt were taken from the surface of
each of the fuel pins, and the results of these analyses
may help explain these differences.

The pins were sectioned through cut A-7 from the
top of the pin, then reversed, and section C-1 placed
in the rotating chuck and the bottom end cap cut off
with ring A-16 still attached so that the foils could be
removed without damage; then cuts A-16 through A-
8 were made. The top pin (No. 2, heat 74533) had a
void at the bottom of the pin, and no salt was around
the foils welded to the hub. Figure 6.91a shows a
photograph of the bottom hub and foils surrounded
by the tube (segment A-16). There is no salt around
the foils or in the bottom of the pin on top of the end

the salt that rested on top of the hub in Fig. 6.91a.
Note the particles lying on the hub (Fig. 6.91a) and
the matching impressions in the salt(Fig. 6.915). The
salt receded from the bottom area in a meniscus, and
the saw accidentally cut into it part of the way
around. Itis not understood how this void could have

152

occurred, removing the salt so cleanly from the area
of the foils and raising the entire volume of salt
greater than s in. higher in the tube. X-ray
photographs were taken of the fuel pin before it was’
installed in the experiment, and there was not a void
in the bottom of the pin at that time. The fuel pins
were maintained at 700°C approximately 1600 hr,

and the salt would most certainly have been molten
during that time. Figure 6.91c shows the next ring
above the bottom of the salt shownin Fig. 6.915 after
it was cut off with the abrasive cut-off saw. (The salt
with saw markings in it and bubbles around it is still
in the ring.) The bubbles were very light green,
contrasted with the dark green of the rest of the fuel
salt. Evidently, some of the salt was melted by the
heat generated by the uncooled cut-off wheel (/5 in.
away) while cutting the back side of the ring. Some
bubbles were noted in the cutting of each ring near
the bottom, but not as many formed near the top of
pin 2, and very few were noted in cutting the other
two fuel pins. Fuel pin 2 (top) and fuel pin 6 (bottom)
are almost identical in composition, and the same
batch of salt was used to fill all the fuel pins; so this
variable behavior is not understood. Pin 6 (heat
74534) contained 0.01% lanthanum, but this should
not change the thermal conductivity appreciably, and
the salt was well mixed by sparging with hydrogen
and argon before the fuel pins were filled.

‘Some of the A rings (Fig. 6.89) were tensile tested
on an Instron tensile machine in the Building 3026D
hot cells. The ring fixture was modified so that the
ring could be held in place. Figure 692 is a
photograph of the fixture with a 0.5-in.-diam X 0.35-
in.-wall X /¢-in.-long ring in place and the top clamp
partially rotated to hold the ring to prevent its sliding
out. During testing, as the two halves of the fixture
were pulled apart, both clamps were rotated to the
closed position. This modification worked well and
alleviated the problems encountered in testing of
TeGen-1 rings. Tensile data for the top, middle, and
bottom irradiated fuel pins are given in Tables 6.34,
6.35, and 6.36 respectively. An arbitrarily assumed
gage length of 0.5 in. was used in the calculation of
the yield strength and the uniform and total
elongations. The values given in the tables are not
absolute values but are useful for comparisons within
the series. The yield strengths appear to be slightly
increased and the elongations and reductions in area
slightly decreased by the irradiation and exposure to

fission products. The elongations are still approxi-
mately 20% (except for some rings that had small
notches accidentally sawed in them), which is

acceptable. These changes are due to the combined
effects of being at 700°C for approximately 1600 hr
of exposure to the thermal neutrons and of the
shallow cracking caused by the fission products.
The rings were numbered consecutively from the
top of each fuel pin (Fig. 6.89). The fuel salt level was
higher in the top pin (approximately at ring A3) than

the middle and bottom pins (approximately at ring

A6) due to the void at the bottom of the top pin
elevating the salt. As discussed previously, **** the
most severe cracking in the MSRE occurred near the
salt-to-gas interface in the pump bowl. In the
standard Hastelloy N pin in TeGen-1, the ringsat the
top of the gas plenum (A-1 and A-2) cracked almost

as severely as at any other location (approximately
2.0 mil deep).‘ Figure 6.93 shows photomicrographs

of the top pin (modified Hastelloy N, heat 74533)
rings after tensile testing at 25° C. Rings A-1 (top) and
A-16 (bottom) did not develop cracks. Both rings
were shielded to some extent by the foils welded to
the hub in the center (Fig. 6.91a). (Ring A-16 was
later cut from the area surrounding the foils.) Ring A-
1 was surrounded by similar foils at the top or gas

space of the same fuel pin. As previously noted, the

void at the bottom of the pin would indicate that both
rings (A-1 and A-16) were in a gas space not exposed
to the fuel salt. Ring A-2 (Fig. 6.91b) was just above
the salt level, ring A-3 (Fig. 6.91¢) was at the surface

of the salt, ring A-8 (Fig. 6.91d) was at the middle of
‘the salt, Ring A-2, justabove the salt surface, appears
to have deeper cracks than the other rings.

Rings of the middle pin (Inconel 600, heat NX
3752), after tensile testing at 25° C, are shown in Fig.
6.94. Ring A-1 was at the top of the gas plenum, ring
A-5 was just above the salt, ring A-6 was at the
surface of the salt, ring A-8 was at the middle of the
salt, and ring A-16 wasat the bottom of the salt. Ring
A-1 (Fig. 6.944) at the top of the gas plenum did not
crack on the inside (exposed to gaseous fission
products) or on the outside exposed to NaK. Rings
A-15 (Fig. 6.94b), A-6 (Fig. 6.94c), and A-8 (Fig.
6.94d) cracked on both the inside, exposed to saltand
fission products, and on the outside, which was
exposed to NaK. Ring A-16 (Fig. 6.94¢) did not crack
as severely on the inside as the rings near the top and
middle of the salt and did not crack on the outside,
exposed to NaK. Unless there was a severe tempera-
‘ture gradient along the length of the fuel pin, no
explanation for this varied behavior can be given at

this time.

- Rings of the bottom pin (modified Hastelloy N,
heat 74534) tested at 25°C are shown in Fig. 6.95.
Ring A-1(Fig. 6.952) was located at the top of the gas
plenum, A-5 (Fig. 6.95b) was just above the salt
surface, A-6 (Fig. 6.95¢) was just below the salt
surface, A-8 (Fig. 6.95d) was at the middle of the salt,
and A-16 (Fig. 6.95¢) was at the bottom of the salt.
Again, note that ring A-1 at the top of the gas plenum
did not crack, as it was probably masked to some

extent by the foils. Ring A-16 at the bottom of the salt
appears to have the most severe cracking of any of the
rings, which is opposite to the trends noted in the
middle and top pms

The cracking in the Inconel 600 pin has slightly
different characteristics than the cracking in either of
the modified Hastelloy N pins. In our experiments
with Inconel 600 exposed to tellurium-containing
environments, some heats of Inconel 600 were
observed to crack, and other heats in the same
capsule did not. All the heats had almost identical
chemical compositions, and it appears that 15%
chromium is borderline for crack resistance in this
alloy. Inconel 601 with 23% chromium resisted
cracking much better in TeGen-1 than Inconel 600
did in TeGen-2.

Analytical chemistry samples were taken from
each fuel pin in the B sections (Fig. 6.89; designations
are from top to bottom). Specimen B-1 was from the
gas plenum, B-2 was from near the salt surface and
B-3 was from near the bottom of the salt. Fuel salt
from the A rings containing the surface of the salt in
each fuel pin was mechanically pressed from the rings
and sent for analysis. This surface salt probably
contained the elements causing the spike of activity in
this region. These chemistry samples should help in
understanding the distribution of the fission products
along the length of the fuel pins and the reason for the
different cracking behavior in different areas of the
fuel pins.

. Also being investigated in the TeGen series of
experiments are otheralloys which are more resistant
to tellurium attack in our experiments and which
should be more resistant to fission products. Some of
these alloys were included in TeGen-3, scheduled for
completion of the irradiation period in mid-March,
and in TeGen-4, scheduled for insertion in the ORR
in mid-April.

The - processes that are being developed for
isolation of protactinium and removal of fission
products from molten-salt breeder reactors require
materials that are corrosion resistant to bismuth-
lithium and molten fluoride solutions. Past experi-
ence has indicated that although the solubilities of
iron-base alloys in bismuth are low, they mass
~ transfer rapidly in bismuth at 500-700°C. The most

promising materials for salt reprocessing are mo-
lybdenum, Ta—10% W, and graphite.

Molybdenum has been tested in a wide range of

bismuth-lithium solutions for up to 10,000 hrand has

shown excellent compatibility. Thermodynamicdata -
and literature reports indicate that molybdenum will

also be compatible with molten fluoride mixtures.
Tantalum—10% tungsten also has excellent com-
patibility with bismuth-lithium solutions, but tests

are required to demonstrate its compatibility with

molten fluoride salts. A thermal convection loop was
constructed of Ta—109% W, and a 3000-hr test at
600~700° C with LiF-BeF;-ThFs-UF.(72-16-11.7-0.3
mole %) was initiated.

Graphite has shown excellent compatibility with
both bismuth-lithium solutions and molten salts.
Although no chemical interaction between bismuth-

lithium solutions and graphite has been found, the

liquid-metal solution tends to penetrate the open
porosity of graphxte Graphite exposed to Bi—2.4 wt
9% (42 at. %) Li in a molybdenum thermal convection

loop for 3000 hr at 600-700°C picked up large

quantities of bismuth and small quantities of

molybdenum. Recent tests have focused on evaluat-

ing the extent of dissimilar material interaction in
MO-(BI-LI)-C and (Ta~10% W)—(Bx-L:)-C systems

Tantalum—10% tungsten tubmg of 0.875-in. OD X
0.050-in. wall was fabricated from 3.5-in.-diam rod -
using extrusion and tube drawing techniques. This .

-material was then used 1o fabncate a thermal

- convection loop (Fig. 7.1). The, loop contains

Ta-10% W tubular and tensile specimens in the
vertical hotand cold leg sections. The loop surge tank
located above the hot leg is also constructed of

Ta-10% W, and the fluoride salt fill tank connected

to it is made of nickel. Tantalum resistance heaters
are used to heat the vertical hot leg, portions of the
two horizontal crossover lines, and the surge tank.
Calrod resistance heaters were used in other areas.
The entire loop system was heated to 700°C before
salt was transferred into the loop. After flow was
established, the Calrod heaters were turned off;
however, they will subsequently be used when the

loop is drained. The loop is circulating the salt

mixture LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16-11.7-0.3 mole
%) and has the temperature distributions shown in

. 7.1.2 Dissimilar Material Tests
It was previously found that mass transfer of
molybdenum to graphlte occurred in a thermal

_' * i convection loop test' after 3000 hr at 600-700°C.
~ Since various components of a chemical processing -

system might well be constructed of graphite and a

- refractory metal, tests were begun to evaluate the
‘extent .of interaetion of such dissimilar materials

~ when they are both in contact with the same solution.

 Four test variables were 1nvest1gated (Table 7.2).

Molybdenum or Ta—109, W specimens were heated

. for 1000 hr in 2 graphite crucible containing bismuth-

lithium at 600 or 700°C. A summary of the results
obtained are shown in Tables 7.3 and 7.4, and typical
metallographic results are shown in Fig. 7.2.

The conclusions that can be drawn from these
results are that (1) the extent of interaction was slight

Part 4. Fuel Processing for Molten-Salt Reactdrs_

J.R. Hightower, Jr.

Part 4 deals with the development of processes for
the isolation of protactinium and for the removal of
fission products from molten-salt breeder reactors.
Continuous removal of these materials is necessary
for molten-salt reactors to - operate as high-
performance breeders. During this report period,

determined that the previously observed entrainment

" of the fluoride salt into the LiCl resulted from
. operation of the agitators in the contactor vessel at 5

work on the chemistry of fuel reconstitution was

resumed, and engineering development progressed
on the metal transfer process for rare-earth element
removal, on continuous fluorinators for uranium
removal, on fuel reconstitution, and on salt-bismuth
contactors to be used in reductive extraction.
Studies of the chemistry of fuel reconstitution were

resumed. A test of the effectiveness of smooth

platinum for catalyzing the hydrogen reduction of
U’ to U* in small gold equipment has shown thata
smooth platinum sheet of limited surface area would
provide appreciable catalytic activity in the hydrogen
reduction column of the Fuel Reconstitution
Engineering Experiment. Niobium is an important
fission product with volatile fluorides and would be
carried from the fluorinator to the fuel reconstitution
step. Studies of the hydrogen reduction of NbF,
showed that in the absence of granular platinum the
NbF, was reduced slowly to Nb°. In the presence of
granular platinum the rate of NbF, was rapid for the
first 2 hr but decreased to a value similar to that
experienced in the uncatalyzed reaction thereafter.
The reason for this behavior is being sought, since, if
it is due to poisoning of the platinum catalyst, it has
significant implications for the use of platinum
catalysts in a reactor-fuel processing plant.

Studies in Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-3B
were continued. In this experiment, all parts of the
metal transfer process for rare-earth element removal
are demonstrated using stirred, nondispersing
contactors and salt flow rates that are about 1% of
those required to process the fuel salt in a 1000-
MW(e) MSBR. During this report period, it was

168

rps. The entrainment was unexpected since none was
seen in experiment MTE-3 under similar conditions.
Tests showed that no entrainment occurred at
agitator speeds up to 4.58 rps. Also during this
period, two additional runs were made at agitator
speeds of 4.17 and 1.67 rps to determine the effect of
agitation on the transfer rate of neodymium from the
fluoride fuel salt to the Bi-Listripper solution. Before
these runs were made, the LiCl and Bi-Li stripper
solution, contaminated with fluoride salt, were

removed from the process vessels and were replaced

with fresh LiCl and Bi-Li. Results of the two runs
show that the rate of transfer of neodymium
increased 300 to 400% when the agitator speed was
increased from 1.67 to 4.17 rps. However, overall
mass-transfer coefficients for neodymium were lower
than predicted by literature correlations, particularly
at the two LiCl-bismuth interfaces. An increase in
mass-transfer rates at these two interfaces would be
required for reasonably sized process equipment to
remove rare earth elements from a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR. Obtaining the desired increases at these
interfaces could be achieved by dispersing the LiCl
and bismuth since entrainment of bismuth into LiCl
would not be as serious as entraining bismuth into the
fluoride salt that returns to the reactor.
Mechanically agitated nondispersing salt-metal
contactors of the type used in experiment MTE-3B
are of interest because entrainment of bismuth into
the fuel salt returning to the reactor can be minimized
since very high ratios of bismuth flow rate to salt flow
rate can be more easily handled than in column-type
contactors and since these contactors seem more
easily fabricated from molybdenum and graphite
than column-type contactors. Mass-transfer studies
using water and mercury to simulate molten salt and

 
 

 

bismuth are being done to determine how to

extrapolate results of mass-transfer measurements in
a small salt-bismuth contactor to the large sizes that
would be used in a fuel processing plant. During this
report period, mass-transfer-coefficient measure-
ments were completed for three stirred, nondispers-
ing water-mercury contactors, covering a W1de range
of agitator diameters and speeds.

- which also serves as an electrode for autoresistance

A nonradioactive demonstration of frozen—salt ‘

corrosion protection in a continuous fluorinator
requires an internal heat source not subject to attack
by fluorine. To provide such a heat source for future

fluorinator experiments, studies have continued of -

autoresistance heating of molten salt in a fluorinator
mock-up. These tests have shown that a major
problem with the present design is plugging that
occurs in the unheated end of the salt inlet tube,

-

heating. Preliminary testing of the effectiveness of
frozen-salt films for protecting against fluorine
corrosion has continued.

The uranium removed from the fuel salt by
fluorination would be returned to the processed salt
in the fuel reconstitution step. The equipment is being
installed for an engineering experiment to demon-
strate the fuel reconstitution step. During this report
period the salt metering system was tested by flowing
salt at the design flow rate [100 cm’/min (1.67 X 107
m’/ s)] through the process vessels. Also, the UFs
supply system was tested and calibrated, and the two
gas density cells for off-gas analysis were calibrated.
The equipment now works sufficiently well that gold-
lined equipment can be installed and the fuel
reconstitution step demonstrated.

8. Chemistry of Fluorination and Fuel Reconstitution

M. R. Bennett

An initial investigation' of the reaction

2UFs(d) + Hy(g) — 2UF4(d) + 2HF(®) (1)

indicated that the reaction rate was low. Subsequent-
ly, it was shown™ that.the reaction follows zero-

order kinetics with a rate constant of 1.35 milli-

moles/hr and that the reaction can be catalyzed by
platinum. A series of experiments at 550°C (823 K)
has been begun to test the catalytic activity of
platinum in forms that could be used in the fuel

A. D. Kelmers

Hydrogen was introduced at 20 cm®/min (3.3 X 107
m’/s), and samples were taken at 10- or 15-min
intervals. The resulting data (Fig. 8.1), when
normalized and plotted as In (Uo.")/(U/’") vs time,

gave a straight line, suggesting first-order kinetics for -

the catalyzed reaction with a half-life of 65 min.

- Additional tests are planned to evaluate the effect of
“hydrogen partial pressure and UFs concentration on

Reconstitution Engineering Experiment (FREE)

reduction column and to investigate the order of
reaction of the catalyzed reaction. In the previous
tests the catalyzed reaction was so rapid that only one
sample could be taken before completion of the
reaction.

During this report period the experimental facility
in Building 4501 was reactivated. After the first tests,
problems were encountered with plugged lines in the
UFs generator system. The plugged lines were
replaced, and additional heating tapes and insulation
were used to prevent the occurrence of cold spots in
the generator system. _

To evaluate the catalytic activity of smooth
platinum, a 1.25-in.(31.8-mm)-diam disk of e
in.(1.6-mm)-thick platinum sheet was pressed into a
1.75-in.(44.5-mm)-diam by ’-in.(24-mm)-thick
gold disk so that only the surface of the platinum
(area, 8.6 cm?) would be exposed to the molten fuel

salt. This disk was placed in the bottom of the gold -

reaction vessel; 0.200 kg of fuel salt, LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %), containing about 1 wt % uranium
as UF, was added; and the system was hydrofluori-
nated for 24 hrat 600° C (873 K) to remove any oxides
present. Gaseous UFs was then introduced to yield a
final UFs concentration of about 2 wt %. The
temperature was reduced to 550°C (823 K), and
hydrogen was bubbled into the salt at 10 cm’/min

- (1.67 X 107 m’/s) through a Y/4-in.(64-mm)-diam dip

tube. The melt was periodically sampled. At the end
of 2 hr, all the uranium was reduced to UF..
Apparently even smooth platinum of limited surface
areca affords appreciable catalytic activity; thus
platinum sheet that could readily be incorporated in
the FREE experiment should provide adequate
catalytic activity in an MSBR processing system..
To determine the reaction order of the catalyzed
reaction, two tests were carried out (test 16 UR with

- 2.04 wt 9% U™ and test 17 UR with 3.54 wt % U**).

the reaction kinetics to try to determine if the reaction
exhibits true first-order kinetics or if it is pseudo first-
order because of an excess of one of the reactants in
these first experiments. First-order kinetics might be

"expected of a reaction that is diffusion limited. This

could be diffusion of a reactant to the catalytic site or
diffusion of an active species or product from the
catalytic site.

In addition to uranium, fission products that
remain in the MSBR fuel salt and have fluorides that
are volatile at 500—-600°C (773-873 K) will be
removed from the fuel salt by fluorination and will
appear in the fuel reconstitution step. Therefore, it is
of interest to establish the chemistry of typical fission
product fluorides; in particular, it would be desirable
to know if the zero-order kinetics and concomitant
low hydrogen utilization observed for UFs is unique

or represents a general case. Niobium, one of the
major fission products, should be volatilized as NbF;
from the fluorination step and would then react with
the UF, in the fuel reconstitution step for form-
soluble NbF,. Previous work* has shown that the
reaction '
NbF.(d) + 2H, = 4HF + Nb°
proceeded very slowly at 700°C (973 K) in ngBeF4
According to Baes,’ under these condltlons, Nb*(d)
should be in equilibrium with Nb% that is, no
intermediate oxidation states should exist.

A series of tests was carried out using the gold
reactor and apparatus previously used for the
uncatalyzed UFs reduction experiments. In these
tests, 200 g of fuel salt and about 4 g of niobium metal
chips were placed in the reactor and hydrofluorinated
at 600°C (873 K) with anhydrous HF both to remove
oxides from the salt and to form dissolved NbF.. It
had been previously shown® that reaction of HF and
Nb° proceeds slowly. In four experiments, melts
containing 0.33 to 1.1 wt 9% NbF, were prepared. The

tube. The melts were periodically sampled, and the

off-gas was scrubbed to trap HF, which was
subsequently determined as fluoride ion by a specific-
ion electrode. The reduction reaction proceeded very
slowly. Scatter in the molten-salt solution analyses
prevented use of those data; however, the measure of
the HF evolution was useful. After normalization to
correct for an initial surge of HF generated when
hydrogen was initially admitted to the reactor, the
data from all four tests gave a single line of slope of
0.208 millimole niobium reduced per hour when
plotted in the form for zero-order kinetics (Fig. 8.2).

- Thus it appears that the reduction of NbF, is similar

to that of UFs. /
A fifth test was then carried out with granular

platinum. The generation rate of HF was increased -

for the first 2 hr and then fell to a value similar to that

recorded for the uncatalyzed condition. The quantity
of HF evolved during the ﬁrst 2 hr was equwalent to
that for the reaction

Possibly an intermediate oxidation state, such as
NbF;, may be metastable and may offer a kinetic
barrier to the complete reduction to Nb®, Conversely,
the platinum catalyst may be poisoned by the
reaction products; so the apparent generation of HF
equivalent to the reduction to NbF; may be
coincidental. If the platinum catalyst is poisoned by
fission products, this could have significant implica-
tions for its practical use.

9.1 METAL TRANSFER
PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

H. C. Savage

. The metal transfer process for the removal of rare-

ecarth-element fission products from Molten-Salt
Breeder Reactor (MSBR) fuel salt is being studied in
engineering scale experimental equipment des1gnat-
ed MTE-3B.' The experiments carried out in MTE-
3B are to determine the rate of removal of
representative rare-earth elements from molten-salt
breeder reactor fuel salt (LiF-BeF;-ThF,, 72-16-12
mole %) and to measure the overall mass-transfer
coefficients between the salt and bismuth phases i in
the mechanically agitated process vessels.

Results obtained from the first two experiments
using the rare-earth element neodymium (Nd-1 and
Nd-2) have been reported.' During these experi-
ments, fluoride fuel salt was unexpectedly entrained
into the lithium chloride in the mechanically agitated
contactor. Agitator speeds of 5 rps were maintained
throughout both runs Nd-1 and Nd-2, duplicating
conditions that were previously used successfully in
similar equipment.?

During this report period, it was determmed that
entrainment occurred when the agitators were
operated at a speed of 5 rps but would not occur at
lower speeds (up to 4.6 rps). The lithium chloride,
contaminated with fluoride salt, was removed from

~ the process vessels along with the lithium-bismuth in

the stripper vessel. Purified lithium chloride and
lithium-bismuth were added to the system, and two
additional experiments were completed. These
experiments were to determine the effect of agitator
speed on the removal rate and overall mass-transfer

coefficients across the three salt-bismuth interfaces
for the rare-earth element neodymium. In one run
(Nd-3) the agitator speed was maintained at 4.17 rps.
In the second run (Nd-4) the agitator was maintained
at 1.67 rps.

' Results obtained in these two expenments (Nd-3
and -4) are given in the following sections.

'9.1.1 Entrainment Studies in
Experiment MTE-3B

Based on previous studies in a- water-mercury
system,’ it was concluded that entrainment of
fluoride salt into the bismuth and LiCl phases in the
mechanically agitated contactor would occur if the
agitators were operated at speeds of 5.0 rps or higher.
However, in the first metal transfer experiment,
MTE-3, entramment was not observed at 5.0 rps but
was seen at 6.7 rps.”

Since fluoride salt entrainment occurred at an
agitator speed of 5 rps in experiment MTE-3B, tests
were made to determine the maximum allowable

agitator speed that could be -used in experiment

MTE-3B without entrainment. These tests were
conducted by operating the agitators in the contrac-
tor at several different speeds (3.3, 4.2, and 5,0 rps)
for times periods ranging from ~50 to ~140 hr.
During each test at constant agitator speed, samples
of the LiCl were réemoved from the contactor and
analyzed for fluoride content since an increase in
fluoride ion concentration would indicate entrain-
ment of fluoride salt into the LiCl. Resultsare shown
in Fig. 9.1, in which the fluoride ion concentrationas
a function of time is plotted for each agitator speed.

represents the amount of entrainment that occurred
over a period of ~250 hr during runs Nd-1 and Nd-2.
The sequence of agitator speeds shown in Fig. 9.1
represents the order in which the tests were run.

~ Entrainment is clearly indicated in the ~50-hr test at

5.0 rps. At agitator speeds of 3.3 and 4.2 rps, no

entrainment (within experimental limits) appears to -

have occurred over the ~200-hr combined test
periods.

It was concluded that future experiments could be
carried out at agitator speeds up to about 4.6 rps
without entrainment. It was also concluded that
periodic determination of fluoride ion concentration

in the LiCl to verify that no entrainment was

occurring could be done rapidly and would be
desirable in future experiments. For this purpose an

Orion Model 801A pH/mV meter* equipped with

specific-ion (fluoride) electrodes was obtained for
these experiments. This very accurate meter can also

be used to continuously measure and record the EMF

(~250 mV) between the two bismuth phases in the
contactor and stripper vessels containing different
concentrations of lithium reductant (~0.0015 and
~0.050 atom fraction lithium). Changes in' EMF
would indicate a change in the relative lithium
concentrations in these phases, with a resultant
change in the equilibrium-distribution coefficient for
neodymium between the salt and bismuth phases.
Determination of the overall mass-transfer coeffi-
cients is dependent on the equlhbrmm distribution
coefﬁc1ents

9.1.2 Removal of LiCl and Bi-Li
Phases and Addition of
Punfied Solutions

The lithium chlonde (contammated with ﬂuorlde
salt) in the contactor and stripper vessels and the
bismuth (depleted in lithium reductant) in the
stripper were removed without difficulty. The lithium
chloride and bismuth were removed by transfer into
an external receiver tank through a heated transfer

- line and dip tube extending into the process vessels. A
new chargmg vesscl was fabricated for subsequent

use in purification and addition of the lithium
chloride and bismuth-S5 at. % hthlum solution to the
process vessels.

‘Chemical analyses of the purlﬁed hthlum chloride -
“in the contactor and stripper indicated that the

 

*Orion Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.

173

fluoride ion content had been reduced from ~5 wt %
to ~0.15 wt %. The 0.15 wt % fluoride content of the
purified lithium chloride indicated that a heel of
~180 cm’ (out of an original inventory of ~6100 cm®)

~of the contaminated lithium chloride was not

removed from the process vessels. This amount of
fluoride (0.15 wt %) would not be expected to affect
the equilibrium-distribution coefficients for neodym-
ium or thorium at the LiCl/ bismuth interface in the
contactor.” Analysis of the purified bismuth-lithium

-in the stripper indicated a lithium reductant content

of 0.048 atom fraction Li—near the desired 0.050
atom fraction. However, the bismuth-lithium solu-
tion contained ~3000 ppm (wt) thorium—presuma-
bly from a precipitated thorium compound (ThBi,)
remaining in the stripper after removal of the
bismuth, which was saturated with thorium as a
result of the fluoride salt (LiF-BeF;-ThF,, 72-16-12
mole %) entrainment during runs Nd-1 and Nd-2. No
adverse effect on the transfer of neodymium would be
expected by the presence of thonum in the bismuth in

~ the stripper.

Following the addition of purified LiCl and Bi-5
at. % Li to the process vessels of Metal Transfer
Experiment MTE-3B, two experiments were con-
ducted as described below. The quantities of salt and
bismuth solutions in MTE-3B are shown in Table 9.1.

9.1.3 Experiments Nd-3 and Nd-4

Two experiments, Nd-3 and Nd-4, were completed
in Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-3B. The experi-
ments were to measure the overall mass-transfer
coefficient for neodymium across the three salt-
bismuth interfaces in the metal transfer process and
to determine the effect of agitator speed on these
coefficients. For experiment Nd-3, an agitater speed
of 4.17 rps was maintained in the contactor and

- stripper vessels, and forexperiment Nd-4, an agitator
- speed of 1.67 rps was maintained. The experiments

were made over a period of two weeks in January

- 1976, during which the proccss cqulpment was
~operated continuously. -

‘Experiment Nd-3. Prior to the start of experxment

- Nd-3,2030 mg of NdF; (1450 mg Nd) containing 149
" mCi of “’Nd tracer (1 1-day half-life) were added to

fuel salt in the reservoir tank. This addition increased

- .the neodymium concentration in the fuel salt from 21
' ppm (wt), remaining after run Nd-2, to 34 ppm (wt).

- Run Nd-3 was started at the following conditions:

(2.0X 107 m*/s), temperature = 923 K. After 19 hrof
operation the fluoride salt circulation was stopped,
and the run was continued for a total of 108 hr, at
which. time the LiCl salt circulation was stopped
while agitation at 4.17 rps was continued for an
additional 57 hr. The salt and bismuth phases were
sampled throughout the run at 4- to 8-hr intervals for
TNd counting and total neodymium analyses to
determine the rate of transfer of neodymium across
the three salt-bismuth interfaces.

The purpose of the initial period of fluoride salt
circulation (19 hr) was to transfer neodymium
containing '“’Nd tracer into the fluoride salt in the
contactor. When this was accomplished, the fluoride
salt circulation was stopped. This procedure resulted
in an increased rate of change of Nd content in the
relatwely small volume of 3.1 X 10> m® vs 3.5%X 107
m’ in the contactor and fuel salt reservoir and
improved the measurements of overall mass-transfer
coefficients. When the LiCl circulation was stopped
(after 108 hr), neodymium transfer into the stripper
was stopped, and the equilibrium distribution of
neodymium between the saltand bismuth phases was
established. This procedure was required to deter-
mine the equilibrium-distribution coefficients for
neodymium for calculation of the overall mass-
transfer coefficients.®

Expenmcnt Nd-4. At the start of run Nd-4 the
agitator speeds were reduced from 4.17 rps to [.67
rps fluoride salt and LiClsalt circulation were at ~35
cm /mm (5.8 X 107 m*/s) and ~1200 cm’®/ min (2.0 X
10~° m?/s) respectively, and the temperature of all

phases was ~650°C (923 K) The fluoride salt
circulation was continued for 21 hr to replace the
neodymium and "*"Nd tracer in the fluoride salt in the
contactor which was extracted during run Nd-3. The
concentration of neodymium in the fluoride salt in
the contactor had been reduced by about 50% during
run Nd-3. The experiment was continued with LiC}

circulation for 110 hr. Agitation of all phases at 1.67 -

rps (without salt circulation) was continued for an
additional 55 hr, again to determine the equilibrium-
distribution coefficients for neodymium between the
salt and bismuth phases. Samples of all phases were
taken at about 4- to 8-hr intervals during the
experiment for 4"Nd counting and total neodymium
analyses.

9.1.4 Results

The neodymium concentrations in the fluoride salt
in the contactor and the bismuth—S5 at. % lithium in

the stripper during runs Nd-3 and Nd-4, based on

counting of the '*’Nd tracer, are shown in Figs.9.2 to
9.5. Neodymium concentrations in the bismuth-
thorium and LiCl phases in the contactor and
stripper are not included since the '“’Nd counting
data do not accurately reflect the very low neodymi-

‘um concentrations (<1 ppm) in these phases.

Concentrations in all phases, based on total neodym-
jum analyses using an isotopic dilution mass
spectrometry technique, will be used for the final
determination of overall mass-transfer and
equilibrium-distribution coefficients and will be
included in a final summary report.

The lines drawn through the data points in Figs.
9.2to0 9.5 represent the “best-fit” values for the overall
mass-transfer coefficients at the three salt-bismuth
interfaces in the experiment.
~ Based on analyses for total neodymium, about 140
mg of neodymium was extracted from the fluoride
salt during run Nd-3, and about 40 mg of ieodymium
was extracted from the fluoride salt during run Nd-4.
The operating time for both runs was essentially the
same (110 hr). Thus the rate of removal of
neodymium was reduced by about 300 to 400% when
the agitator speed was reduced from 4.17 to 1 67 1ps.
~ Results of five metal transfer process experiments
in which neodymium was used as the representative
rare-earth element fission product are shown in
Tables 9.2 and 9.3. One run, Nd-2, is not shown since
complete consumption of lithium from the stripper
alloy caused by entrainment of fluoride salt into the
lithium chloride precluded measurement of the
overall mass-transfer coefficients. Two of the runs
(EU-6 and EU-7) were conducted in experiment
MTE-3 during 1972, and three runs (Nd-1, Nd-3,and
- Nd-4) were conducted in experiment MTE-3B during
1975-1976.

As seen in Table 9.2, the overall mass-transfer,
coefficients increase with increasing agitator speed,
as predicted, with one exception—K; did not increase
in run EU-7 when the agitator speed was increased
from 3.33 to 5.0 rps. There is also good agreement
between runs EU-7 (MTE-3) and Nd-1 (MTE-3B)at -
agitator speeds of 5.0 rps. In runs Nd-3 and Nd-4

bismuth-5 at.
“however, are significantly lower than in run Nd-3 at

(MTE-3B) the overall mass-transfer coefficients were
decreased by about 300 to 400% when the agitator
speeds in the contactor and stripper were reduced
from 4.17 to 1.67 rps. Also, the overall mass-transfer
coefficient values at the fluoride sait/bismuth-
thorium interface (X} for all experiments in MTE-
3B are in the range of 50 to 100% of the values

predicted by the Lewis correlation, compared to the -
~15% of predlcted value observed in the two

experiments in MTE-3. The overall mass-transfer
coefficients at the LiCl/ bismuth-thorium and LiCl/
% lithium interfaces (K., K3),

4.17 rps than would be expected from the values at

5.0 rps seen in runs EU-6, EU-7, and Nd-1.

Because of the limited number of experiments and
the rather large variation in the experimentally
determined overall mass-transfer coefficients, a
meaningful correlation of the data for use in design of
a metal transfer process system foran MSBR has not
been possible. An increase in the mass-transfer rates
would be needed for reasonably sized process
equipment to remove the rare-earth-element fission
products from a 1000 MW(e) MSBR, in the case of
neodymxum at a rate of about 1.2 g-moles/day. For
run Nd-3 in MTE-3B, an increase of about 500% in
the removal rate of neodymium could be achieved if
the mass-transfer coefficients at the two LiCl/bis-
muth interfaces, K; and Kj, could be increased
(without increasing the transfer coefficient at the
fluoride salt/bismuth interface) to about 20% and

9.2 MASS-TRANSFER STUDIES USING
- WATER-MERCURY CONTACTORS -
G H.'Br'own,’ J. LR Hightower;' Jr.
Mechanically agitated nondispersing salt-bismuth

contactors are being considered for the protactinium
removal step and the rare-earth-clement removal step

~ in the reference MSBR processing plant flowsheet.

These contactors have several advantages over
packed-column salt-bismuth contactors:-

1. They can_'minimize entrainment of bismuth into
the fuel salt returning to the reactor,

2. They can be fabricated more economlcally from
graphite and molybdenum, and

3. They can be operated more easily with large flow
_ rate ratlos of molten salt.and bismuth.

Expenmental development of these stlrred contac-
tors has been carried out in two different systems, a
facility in which molten fluoride salt is contacted with
bismuth containing a dissolved reductant and a
“system in which mercury and an aqueous electrolyte
phase are used to simulate bismuth and molten salt.
In the first facility, mass transfer of uranium and
zirconium was studied in a single stirred contactor
 using actual process fluids.”” The studies with water
and mercury will allow many physicat parameters
(such as size and configuration of the contactor
vessels and agitators) to be examined at relatively
small expense over a wide range; then results
measured in the salt-bismuth facility can be extrapo-
lated to the larger contactor sizes that will be present

in the processing plant.

 

 
 

An electrochemical technique has been developed
to measure water-side mass-transfer coefficients in
water-mercury contactors. During this report period
an extensive set of experiments using this technique
has been done by a group* from the MIT School of
Chemical Engineering Practice to determine the
effect of agitator diameter and speed and of cell size
on the water-side mass-transfer coefficient i m square
water-mercury contactors.

9.2.1 Experimental Equipment and Procedure

- The electrochemical technique for measuring

water-side mass-transfer coefficients is based upon

the diffusion-limited reduction of quinone to
hydroquinone at the mercury surface in the water-
' mercury contactor:

0=® =0+2H +2¢ = H0-©—0H.

M

As has been discussed previously,'® reaction (1) can
be driven electrochemically in the forward direction
at the mercury surface (which acts as a cathode in an
electrochemical cell) and in the reverse direction at
another electrode (the anode of an electrochemical
cell) in contact with the aqueous phase of the water-
mercury contactor. The concentration of hydroqui-
none can be made much higher than the concentra-
tion of quinone, and the area of the anode can be
made much greater than the area of the mercury
surface. When this is done and an electric current is
passed between the two electrodes, the mercury
surface is polarized. The magnitude of the electric
current is then limited by the rate at which quinone is
transferred to the mercury surface, and the water-side

A diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown
in Fig. 9.6. The contactor vessels were Plexigias
boxes of square cross-section twice as deep as they
were wide; the agitators were flat-bladed turbines
having four blades, with one turbine centered in each
phase. The anode for each cell was made from 1.6-
mm-thick brass sheet, which was formed to fit the
inner perimeter of the cell and was suspended in the
aqueous phase. The anodes were plated with gold or
silver to resist chemical attack by the aqueous
solution.

. The potential of the mercury surface was con-
trolled versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE),
which was suspended in the aqueous phase while
current was passed between the anode and the
cathode. A potentiostat was used which was capable
of automatically varying the impressed voltage
between limits of +2 V(SCE)and -2 V(SCE) at rates
up to 1 V/min. The current through the cell was -
plotted vs the mercury surface potentlal on a
Hewlett-Packard X-Y plotter. -

The composition of the aqueous phase for all runs
was 001-0.05 M hydroquinone, 0.0002-0.001 M
quinone,ina 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution having
a pH of 7.0.

The cell was filled with an appropnate volume of
each phase, and a turbine was positioned at the
midpoint of each phase. The agitator drive was then
started and adjusted to the desired speed. The
variable voltage was increased from 0 to +1.0 V vs

. SCE at a rate of 0.5 V/min, and the cell current and

voltage were recorded automatically on the X-Y
recorder. The agitator speed was then adjusted to
another value, and the procedure was repeated untila
satisfactory range of agitator speeds had been
investigated.

A typical current-voltage recording is shown in
Fig. 9.7. In this figure, the cell current is recorded
over the range of 01 V vs SCE at different agitator
speeds. For each agitator speed, the cell current rises
at low voltages with increasing voltage and reaches a
constant value at higher voltages. This constant
current is the desired diffusion-limited current. The
diffusion current actually oscillates about an average
value because of turbulent fluctuations at the
interface. An average value of the diffusion current is
determined from the recordings, and this average
value is recorded and used for the determination of
the mass-transfer coefficient using Eq. (2).

Results of measurements in three contactor vessels '

are presented in the followmg section.

9.2.2 Experimental Results

Water-side mass-transfer. coefficients were
measured in three different Plexiglas cells, 102 cm X
102 mm, 203 X 203 mm, and 305 X 305 mm. In each
cell, two or three phase volumes were examined, the
volume of each phase being equal. For each phase
volume, several agitators with different diameters

~ were tested, one agitator being centered in each

phase. An finally, for each combination of cell size,
phase volume, and agitator diameter, several
determinations of limiting diffusion current were
made over a range of agitator speeds. Agitator speeds
were kept below that speed at which dispersal of the
aqueous phase into the mercury phase began.
Dispersal was detected by small droplets of water
leaving the mercury phase neéar the edge of the cell. A
summary of the experimental parameters is given in
Table 9.4.

All the mass-transfer data determmed in these
expenments are reported elsewhere.'' Reported here
are representative results which indicate the effect of
the experimental parameters on the water-side mass-
transfer coefficient,

Figures 9.8 to 9.10 show the mass-transfer
coefficients as a function of agitator speed for one
value of phase volume in each of the three cells. The
plot for each agitator diameter appears to be

- comprised of two regions. At low agitator speeds the

mass-transfer coefficient is proportional to the
agitator speed to the 0.7 power, and at high agitator
speeds the mass-transfer coefficient is proportional
to agitator speed to a power near 2. The change
between the two regions is fairly abrupt for small
agitator diameters, but as agitator diameter in-
creases, the change becomes more gradual. Data
from the water-mercury contactor are compared with

dibromoethane. This relation shows that the maxi-
mum agitator speed decreases with increasing
agitator diameter. Therefore, it is necessary to
determine the net effect of lower allowable agitator
speeds and increasing mass-transfer coefficients as
agitator diameter increases.

Although in all runs in the water-mercury
contactor the agitator speed was not increased to the
point where dispersion was seen, the maximum mass-
transfer coefficient measured for each agitator
diameter was plotted vs the agitator diameter on log-
log coordinates (Fig. 9.11). From this information, it
is seen that the maximum mass-transfer coefficient

182

generally increases with increasing agitator diameter.

If it is assumed that this maximum value is

proportional to the agitator diameter raised to some
power, the exponent in that relation probably falls in
the range 0.8-1.6 within the range of agitator
diameters investigated (64—270 mm).

Figure 9.12 shows all the data for the 89-mm-diam
agitator on a single plot. This figure shows that the

variables other than agitator speed and agitator

diameter effect the value of the mass-transfer
coefficient fairly significantly. Careful examination
of Fig. 9.12 shows that for a given cell size the mass-
transfer coefficient varies inversely with the phase

coefficient was measured as a function of agitator
speed, with an agitator in each phase. The test was
then repeated twice, first with an agitator in the
mercury phase only and then with the agitator in the
water phase only. The results indicate that at low
agitator speeds, agitation in the water affects the
water-side mass-transfer predominantly; whereas, as
agitator speed increases, agitation in the mercury
affects the water-side mass-transfer coefficient more
strongly than agitation in the water phase. Moreover,

These measurements have provided a great deal of
data covering a wide range of physical parameters
which affect mass transfer in stirred cells. Using the

‘electrochemical technique, the data have been
- measured with somewhat more precision than data
based upon transient experiments which have been

used exclusively in the literature. Because of this,

these data will be useful in developing correlations

that can be used to estimate mass-transfer rates in

Five test runs have been made, but a redesigned

9 3.1 Autoresxstanoe Hcatmg Test AI-IT-4

Operatmg experience from the first four runs of
autoresistance heating test AHT-4 indicated two
‘major problems in the forming and maintaining of a
satisfactory frozen-salt film in AHT-4: (Fig. 9.14).
The first problem is the tendency for the vertical test
section to cool faster and eventually restrict the salt
flow before the electrode side arm has an insulating
salt film, which will allow autoresistance heating to
be started. The second problem is in maintaining a
molten-salt flow through the unheated tip of the
electrode. Before modifying the electrode, a run

. (AHT 4-5) was made in which cooling of the vertical

test section was controlled to keep the wall tempera-
ture above that of the electrode side arm. After 82/3 hr
of cooling, the test vessel liquid level instrument

began to fluctuate, indicating incipient plugging. At
this time, most of the cooled section of the test vessel
was near a uniform temperature (648K), and
autoresistance heating was started in an attempt to
maintain a molten core, This attempt was not
successful, and electrode plugging was indicated bya
sharp rise in the gas-liquid separator liquid levels..
The gas lift was stopped when generating 490 W of
autoresistance heating did not clear the plug but did
‘result in a decrease in resistance, indicating electrical
shorting near the electrode. The final resistance was
0.10 Q and the average cooled wall temperature was
632K.

-From the results of run AHT 4-5, plugging of the
unheated end of the electrode appears to be the most
immediate problem. A replacement electrode has
been designed which incorporates heating to the tip
of the electrode. The electrode diameter has been
decreased by using z-in. rather than ¥-in. pipe, and

.the heater jacket diameter has been decreased by
using 1'-in. rather than 2-in. pipe. Using these
smaller diameters will increase the clearance between
the jacket and cooled wall from 1.8 in. (46 mm)to 2.1

186

in. (53 mm) to reduce the heating effect on the frozen-
salt film. The completely jacketed electrode will
permit installation of thermocouples at the tip of the
electrode to measure the temperature of the salt
entermg the test vessel

9.3.2 Frozen-Salt Corrosion Protection
Demonstration (FSCPD)

The equipment flowsheet for this demonstration is
shown in Fig. 9.15, and details of the test vessel with
the first cooled tube are shown in Fig. 9.16. Six
cooling test runs defined the conditions of tempera-
ture and cooling air flow necessary for the formation
of an adequate frozen-salt film (T: able 9.5). During
these tests a low flow of argon instead of fluorine was

‘used through the center of the tube. In the last four

runs, a small argon flow was maintained through the
transfer line from the delivery vessel to ensure an
open line for rapid salt transfer from the test vessélat
the end of the test. Transfer of saltat temperaturesas
close to the liquidus temperature (778K) as is
necessary in these tests is usually difficult. The salt

was transferred from the test vessel after three of the
runs. In one of these cases, the tube could not be

removed for examination, probably because of an -

unusually large salt ring formed above the salt level
from too high a sparge rate. The annular clearance
around the outer tube is 0.3 in. (76 mm). In the other
two cases the salt film was too thin to measure and
did not cover the metal at several points. The main
problem with this tube design was plugging of the

‘fluorine inlet tube at temperatures as high as 719 K.

Since this temperature is well above the solidus
temperature (623 K) of the salt, formation of a
suitable film was not possible.

Tests using the No. 1 cooled tube were ended when
a leak developed in the air cooling annulus of the
tube. The tube was cut off 5 in. (127 mm) from the
bottom, and this section was examined in the
Metallography Laboratory. Figure 9.17 shows the

 area where the failure occurred, the grain boundary

attack, and the nickel oxide that was formed. A
horizontal crack developed in the Y32-in.(0.8-mm)-
thick nickel inner [s-in. (9.5 mm) OD] tube. The

- The second cooled tube was desigried to be

~sufficiently small to permit the use of argon instead of
_air coolant to avoid nickel oxidation. Also, since
introduction of fluorine through the center of the

cooled tube is not required for this demonstration,
the test vessel dip tubes were modified as shown in

- Fig. 9.18. All three tubes are of ¥s-in.(9.5-mm)-OD
- nickel tubing, with the argon coolant inlet tube of %6~

in.(4.8-mm)-OD nickel. This cooled tube has only
13% of the cooled area of the first tube and will
require considerably less coolant flow. Air coolant
flow with the first tube had to be restricted to 90
liters/min (1.5 X 10~ m’/s) to maintain the bulk of

- the molten salt above 793K using the maximum

crack was about Y in. (6 mm) long (~20% of the

circumference). The crack was not near a weld but
occurred in metal that had been machined froma 1-
in. nickel rod. Figure 9.17 also shows that the
thickness of the tube was reduced to less than one-
half of the original thickness.

‘power on the vessel heaters. With the'second tube an
argon flow of 35 liters/min (5.8 X 107 mfs)

(proportionally three times greater) could be used
while maintaining a steady bulk salt temperature.
Two test runs were made with the second cooled
tube. In the first test the tube was cooled by anargon
flow of 35 liters/ min (5.8 X 10~ m®/s) for 3.8 hr. Salt
was then transferred from the test vessel, with the

9.4 FUEL RECONSTITUTION .
ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT -

R M. Counce

The reference flowsheet for processing the fuel'salt
from a molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) is based
upon removal of uranium by fluorination to UF as
the first processing step.” The uranium removed in
this step must subsequently be recombined with the
fuel-carrier salt before its return to the reactor. The
method for recombining the uranium with the fuel-

carrier salt (reconstituting the fuel salt) consists of
-absorbing gaseous UFs into a recycled -fuel salt

stream containing dissolved UF, according to the
reaction

UFe() + UFsq = 2UF5( . )

The resultant UFs would be reduced to UF, with
. hydrogen in a separate vessel according to the
‘_ reaction:

UFsi¢) + '/ Hag = UFq + HF,) . (6)

Engineering studies of the fuel reconstitution step

~ are being started to provide the technology necessary
- for the design of larger equipment for recombining

UFs generated in fluorinators in the processing plant,
with the processed fuel-carrier salt returning to the

reactor. ‘

- During this report period a preliminary hydrody-
namics test of the experimental equipment, in which
salt flow through the system was maintained under
simulated experimental conditions, was successfully
completed. A calibration of the UFs metering system
was completed; a gas density cell used for measuring

‘concentrations of UF; in argon was calibrated; and

apparatus for producing known concentrations of
HF in hydrogen was developed and was used to

~calibrate the gas density cell used for measuring

concentrations of HF in hydrogen. These operations
are discussed in the remainder of the report.

- 9.4.1 Hydrodynamxc Operat:on

The hydrodynamlc operatxonal procedure for the
experiment has been discussed previously.” During
this report period, five hydrodynamic experiments
were conducted: HR-1, HR-2, HR-3, HR-4,and HR-
5. The fourth and fifth experiments, HR-4 and HR-5,
resulted in salt being metered from the feed tank
through the UFs absorption vessel and hydrogen
reduction column to the receiver (Fig. 9. 19) at a
constant flow rate of approxnnately 100 cm 3/ min
(1.67 X 10°° m’/s).

In HR-1, the UFG absorption vessel and the
hydrogen reduction column were filled. The siphon
was primed in HR-2, and salt flow was started from
the feed tank. Run HR-2 ended abruptly when
plugging occurred in the effluent salt transfer line

191

from the hydrogen reduction column. A third run,
HR-3, did not get under way because of a plug in the
transfer line from thc feed tank to the absorption
vessel.

In run HR+4, the UF; absorption vessel and the
hydrogen reductlon column were filled in prepara-
tlon for. run HR-S. In run HR-5, a salt flow of 100
cm’/min (1.67 X 10°° m’/s) was started and was
maintained for 1 hr. The gas streams of UFs and
hydrogen were simulated by two argon flows. The
two argon flow rates of 180 std cm®/min (3 X 107
m’/s) simulate the stoichiometric gas flow rates of
UFs and hydrogen necessary to increase the UF,

‘concentration in the salt from 0.15 mole %in the feed

stream of the UFs absorption vessel to 0.3 mole %in
the efﬂuent stream from the hydrogen reductxon
column.

9.4.2 Calibration of the UFs
Metering System

The UFs supply system®' (Fig. 9.20) provides UF
at known flow rates to the UFs absorption vessel
during the operation of the experiment and to the
UF¢-Ar gas density cell for calibration purposes. The

_supply system contains a model ALF-500W Hastings
mass flowmeter which indicates and controls the UF

flow rate. Because the UF¢ flow rate is an important
experimental parameter, this flowmeter must be
calibrated before the experiment begins.

- The flowmeter was calibrated as follows. A steady

flow of UF was established to the main off-gas trap.

The UFs stream was then diverted through the
calibration trap, a packed bed of NaF pellets
maintained at 373 K. The flow of UFs through the
calibration trap was maintained long enough to
produce a loading of 0.2 kg UFs/kg NaF. The UF;
stream was then diverted back to the main UFs trap,

‘and the flow of UF;s stopped. The system was then

completely purged with argon. The calibration trap
was then removed and weighed again. The weight of
UFs loaded into the trap was determined by
subtracting the original weight from the final weight.
The flow rate of UFs was determined then by dividing
the weight of UFs by the length of time UF¢ flowed
into the calibration trap. This process was repeated
for several flow rates of UFs up to 560 std cm’/min

Gas Density Detector

Callbratlon of the gas density cell that is used in
determining the concentration of UF; in the argon
stream leaving the UF; absorption vessel requires
UF¢Ar mixtures of known concentrations. These
mixtures were provided by mixing separate UFs and
argon streams of known flow rates and feeding the
mixture to the gas density 'cell used for UFs-Ar

analysis. This gas density cell?? was calibrated for-

concentrations of 0—50 mole % UFs in argon (Fig.
9.21).

9.4.4 Calibration of the HF-H;
Gas Density Cell

Calibration of the gas density cell that is used in
determining HF concentration in hydrogen from the
hydrogen reduction column requires a supply of HF-
H:> mixtures of known concentrations. Since HF is
not otherwise required in the experiment, a means is
used for producing HF-H; mixtures which does not
require an HF supply and metering system. Fixed
concentrations of HF in hydrogen can be generated
by passing hydrogen gas over NaF-HF in a manner
such that the HF partial pressure is increased to the
dissociation pressure of the complex by using the
equilibrium

NaF-HF ~ NaF + HF . ™

In this system the HF partial pressure is a unique

function of temperature as long as both NaF-HF and
NaF are present. Consequently the concentration of
HF in the gas stream in equilibrium with the
NaF-HF-NaF mixture can be set by controlling the

temperature of the system.

The vessel for producmg hydrogén saturated with
HF (Fig. 9.22) is 1'/; in. (3.81 X 107 m) sched 40

Monel pipe 0.97 m long, mounted vertically with -
- standard 150-1b Monel flanges at either end. This

vessel was filled with a commercial grade of NaF-HF
in the form of '/s-in. (3 mm) right circular cylindrical
pellets.

Hydrogen was passed over the NaF-HF bed in this -

vessel at various temperatures at a total pressure of
I atm, and the concentration of HF in the resulting
mixtures was compared with values calculated from
published values of the NaF-HF dxssocmtnon pres-
sure.

The equilibrium conoentratlons of gaseous HF in

hydrogen over NaF-HF obtained from these g;;pcn-
and
Froning® for concentrations in the range of 1-50

mole %. In general, concentrations in this range =

occurred at temperatures approximately 50° C lower

than temperatures predicted from the work of
Froning® and approximately 75°C lower than
‘temperatures predicted from the work of Davis.”® In

Fig. 9.23, the experimental results are definitely
" closer to the literature values of HF over NaF- HF
~ than HF over other known NaF-HF complexes.”

The results of the HF saturator expenment have
shown reproducibility, although the error is such that
the flow rates in and out of the saturator are used as
the basis in calcu]atmg gas composmon leaving the
saturator,

.- Using the HF saturator to generate HF concentra-
tions in hydrogen, the analytical system for H,-HF

.‘ analyms was calibrated for concentrations of 0~50%

" HF in hydrogen. Thxs  gas analysis system has been
_-described previously.”? This calibration curve and
. pertinent operating conditions are shown in Flg
- 9.24. Also shown for comparison in Fig. 9.24 is a

calibration of the system for 0-50% nitrogen in

. hydrogen under the same operating conditions.

MIXTURES FOR RESEARCH
'AND DEVELOPMENT

F.L.Daley R.W. Horton*

At the beginning of this report period, the repaired
meltdown vessel was returned to service for produc-
tion of MSBR fuel-carrier salt. A total of 450 kg of
fuel-carrier salt was produced in three 150-kg batches
in the new copper-lined treatment vessel, which also
has a protective copper sheet on the inside of the
vessel head. Completed analyses on salt samples from
the first two production batches (FS-108 and FS-109)
show that impurities were present at levels much
lower than normal. The oxygen content of the salt
was below 100 ppm. These results point out the
strong effect of purification vessel corrosion products
on the quality of salt that is produced.

 

 

*Consultant, 7

197

During this report period, the decision to termi-
nate work on the MSR Program by the end of FY
1976 was reached. The need for salt during the
balance of the fiscal year was determined, and this
need was supplied while preparations to place the salt
production facility in a safe standby condition were
proceeding. At the end of the production period, a
total of 1975 kg of salt (of various compositions) had
been produced since activation of the facility in early
1974. Shipments to the program totaled 865 kg, and
678 kg have been stored for possible use.
~ All production areas were decommissioned and
cleaned to remove potential health hazards. Unused
materials and equipment were either set aside for
burial or were stored; some major property items
were transferred to the Reactor Division. A reporton
the final production and decommissioning activities
provides a reference for stored material and records

final comments on the performance of the salt

purification system.
