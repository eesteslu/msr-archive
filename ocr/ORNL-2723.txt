MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY

Part 1. Reactor Design Studies

1.1. Nuclear Calculations and Design Studies

The effects of fuel processing by the ion-exchange method at a
rate of once per year and at a rate of 12 times per year were compared
for the Interim Design Reactor fueled with U3, Processing st the
higher rate gave insufficient improvement in performance to offer a
substantial economic advantage.

The nuclear performsnce of a one-region, graphite-moderated,
unreflected, thorium-conversion, molten-salt-fueled reactor was
studied to evaluate the effects of processing the fuel at the rate
of once per year and 12 times per year, the effects of decreasing
the thickness of the core vessel and adding a blanket, and the effects
of using a grasphite core vessel and a blanket. The results of the
calculations indicated that the nuclear performance of the one-region
reactor fueled with U235 and processed by either the volatility or
ion~exchange methods at the rate of one fuel volume per year is com-
petitive with the best performance of the solid fuel systems, and
therefore the molten-salt reactor will yield lower over-all fuel costs
when the potential economies of continuous, chemical processing'of
the fluid fuel are realized. | |

fueled reactor were studied. 1Itfwasffouhd\thatiwith 13 mole % ThF) in

reactors, 5 ft in dlameter, with fuel volume fractions of 0.10 and
0.15% were studied. Results were obtained for reactors with power
levels of 125 and 250 Mv. It was found that the only reactor with
a doubling time less than 20 years was the 250-Mw reactor having a
fuel volume fraction of 0.10.

The effects of fast-neutron reactions in Be9 on the reactivity
of molten-salt-fueled reactors were studied. It was found that Be
is an appreciable poison in homogeneous, molten-salt-fueled reactors,
but it has negligible effect in graphite-moderated, molten-salt-
fueled reactors. . _ |

Work is continuing on the design of a 30-Mw, one-region, experi-

mental, molten-salt reactor.

1.2. Component Development and Testing
Tests of salt-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings were
continued in order to obtain operating data on which to base an
optimum design. Assembly of a thrust-bearing tester was nearly com-
pleted. An existing centrifugal sump pump is being modified for
service tesis of a salt-lubricated journal bearing,.and means for
flexibly mounting the besring to the pump casing are being investigated.
The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal being subjected
to an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has continued
to seal satisfactorily for more than 12,000 hr of operation. Operation
of an MF type of centrifugsal pump with fuel 30 as the circulated
fluid has continued to be satisfactory through more than 15,500 hr,
with the past 13,500 hr of operation being under cavitation damage
conditions. A small frozen-lead pump seal on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft
has operated since the first 100 hr of 7500 hr of operation with no lead
leekege. A similar seal on a 3 1/4-in.-dia shaft has operated 3600
hr, with an average leskage rate of 9 cms/hr. Operational data Suggest
that the seal should be redesigned to provide.better coolant control
and packing to decrease the snnulus between the seal and the shaft.
Construction work continued on the remote maintenance demon-

stration facility. 7The work is on schedule and is to be campieted by

June 30, 1959.

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing
loops continued in 15 test stands. Tests of two Inconel loops that
had operated for one year were terminated. Salt samples were removed
periodically from two loops that contain sampling devices.

The in-pile loop operated previously in the MIR was disassembled.
It was found that oil which had leaked.pest the pump shaft seal and
filled the oil trap on the purge outlet line was polymerized by radia-
tion, and the polymerized oil plugged the outlet line. The second
in-pile loop, which was modified to minimize the probability of purged
line plugging and activity release, was installed in the MTR on
April 27.

1.3. Engineering Research

The enthalpy, heat capacity, viseosity, and surface tension have
been experimentally Obtained for several additional fluoride salt
mixtures containing BeF, with varying amounts of UF), and/or ThF).
Altering the salt composition toward higher percentages of the high-
molecular-weight components resulted in substantial decreases in both
the enthalpy and heat capacity. The viscosity showed some increase
(of the order of 10%) as the percentage of UF), and ThF) in the mixtures

‘was increased. Initial flow calibrations of a full-scale mockup of

the pump system designed for the study of interfacial film formation
and heat transfer with Ber-containing salts have been completed;
assembly of the components is proceeding._ The flow characteristics

of the sinteredpmetal-fllled annulus of a double-walled tube have been
dbtained for two porosity conditions

1.4. Instruments and Controls

‘Work has'continued'on molten-salt-fuel level indicators. Two
Inconel "I tube—type elements were prepared for testing, and an
INOR-B element and test vessel are being constructed.

Six INOR-S pressure transmitters and indicating systems were
ordered for testing. These units are of the pneumatic-indicator type.

Part 2. Materials Studies

2.1. Metallurgy -

Corrosion studies were completed on four INOR-8 and four Inconei
thermal-cdnvection loops. Metallographic examination of the INOR-8
loops, three of which operated for 1000 hr and the other for one year,
revealed no observable attack. The Incconel loops, vhich represented.
three one-year tests and one 1000-hr test, showed intergranular void -
attack to depths renging from 4 to 15 mils. Twelve thermal-convection-
loop tests were initiated during this period. The scheduled tests of - -
two forced-circulation loops were completed, and one new forced-. |
circulation-loop test was started. ,

The effects of penetration of graphite by molten-fluoride-salt
fuels are being investigated in order to evaluate the problems
associated with the use of unclad graphite as a moderator. In static
pressure penetration tests at 150 psia and 13OOOF, partially degassed
graphite was penetrated throughout by fuel 30 (NaF-Zth—UFh) but was
not penetrated by fuel 130 (LiF-BeFE-UFh), as indicated by macroscopic
examination. Thermal cycling of the graphite that was penetrated
by fuel 30 did not result in damage to the graphite. Additional static
and dynamic tests are planned.

A series of tests was run to further investigate the precipitation
of urenium from fuel 130 held in a graphite crucible at 1300°F. The
results of these tests supported the previous conclusion that the
uranium precipitation was the result of the fuel reacting with oxygen
supplied by degassing of the graphite.

Severael brazing alloys were tested for compatibility with fuel
130. Coast Metals alloy No. 52 (89% Ni-4% B—5% Si-2% Fe) and pure
copper brazed to Inconel and INOR-8 showed good resistance to fuel
130 in 1000-hr tésts at 1300°F in a thermal-convection loop. The

- following brazing alloys showed some attack or porosity as a result

of similar exposure to fuel 130: General Electric alloy No. 81
(70% Ni—19% Cr—11% Si), Coast Metals alloy No. 53 (81% Ni-8% Cr-% Si—
b4 B-3% Fe), and a gold-nickel alloy (82% Au-18% Ni). |

A specimen of INOR-8 was examined for evidence of carburization
that had been exposed to fuel 130 for 4000 hr in a thermal-convection
loop hot leg at a temperature of 1300°F. The presence of a 10-in.
graphite insert in the hot leg of this loop did not cause carburization
of the INOR-8.

No new creep data for INOR-8 became availsble during the qusrter.
Creep tests are presently in progress at 1100 and 1200°F with the
fluoride salts of interest as the test environments, and these tests

are expected to run in excess of 10,000 hr.
The critical results obtained from rotating-beam fatigue tests

at 1500°F indicate that INOR-8 has slgnificantly better fatigue
resistance than Inconel. Creep and relaxation tests indicate that an |
unstable condition exists in the temperature range from 1100 to 14100°F.
There is some indication that a second phase appears which causes
contraction of the metal even under load.

Based on the results o; tensile tests conducted on specimens of
INOR-8 aged for 10,000 hr in the temperature rsnge of 1000 to lhOOQF,
it has been concluded that INOR-8 does not exhibit embrittling tendencies
that can be attributed to high-temperature instability. No significant
differences were found between the tensile properties of the aged
specimens and those of specimens in the annealed condition.

An effort is now being made to fabricate triplex heat exchanger
tubing containing a prefabricated porous nickel core. Porous nickel
tubes have been ordered from Micro Metallic Corp. to determine the feasi-
bility of cladding the material with Inconel and INOR-8. A sample piece

of porous nickel has ‘been incorporated 1nto the annular space formed

between two Inconel tubes for conductlng a preliminary cladding experiment.

Procedures are ‘being developed for fabricating INOR-8 material
ranglng in size from thln-walled tubing to heavy plate. The procedures

_ thus developed are being qualified in accordance with methods prescribed

by the ASME Boiler Code. , _
The effects of various deoxidation and purification processes
on the mechenical properties of INOR-8 weld metal are being studied

in an effort to improve the high-temperature ductility of INOR-8 weld
metal. Several heats of weld metal containing various additiﬁes were
cast and fabricated into weld wire for mechanical property evaluation. .
A method was developed for brazing graphite to Inconel. A |
commercially available brazing alloy composed of silver, titanium, and
copper was found that wet vacuum-degassed graphite. Such graphite-to-
Inconel joints were used in the fabrication of‘equipment,fcr;studying _
the penetration of graphite by molten salts in a dynamic, high-pressure

systen.

2.2. Chemlstry and Radiation Damage

A revised phase diagram for the system LiF-BeF -ThFh was prepared
that includes new data obtained frqm thermsl-gradient quenching experi-
ments. Quenched samples from experlments in which an equilibration
period of 3 weeks was used revealed that the area of single-phase
ternary solid solutions involving 3LiF-ThFu is greater than previously
reported. A phase diagram showing the progress made thus far in the
study of the NaF-BeF,-ThF) was also prepared, and the identity end
approximate locations of primary phases in the system NaF-THFhAUFh
were determined.

The SnF,-NH) HF,, system was investigated because of its potenti-
alities as a strongly oxidizing, low-melting solvent for reprocessing
fuels. Reliable data were obtained only in the range O to 40% SnF.

A 15 mole % addition of SnF gives a mixture with a meltlng point of

about lOO c.

Measurements were made of the solubility of Pu'F3 in LiF-BeF2~'
UF), (70-10-20 mole %). The solubility values obtained were all higher
than those obtained with.LiF-BeF2 mixtures having about the same LiF
concentration but no UFh'_

The possibility of separating LiF from the mixture LiF-BéF2 (63-
37 mole %) by adding NaF and decreasing the temperature was investigated.

In an initial experiment only 23% of the LiF remained in solution when

- the temperature of the mixture to which NaF was added at 700 C was

lowered to 490°C.

Tests were initiated for determining the rate of exchange in a
proposed method for decreasing the total rare earth content of molten

fluoride salts. The exchange reaction

SmF3 (a) + CeF3 (s)ﬁCer (a) + SmF3 (s)

is utilized by passing the salt through an isothermal bed of solid

salt is lowered to decrease the total rate earth content.

content, and then the temperature of the effluent

Two methods for separating uranium from fission products are
being studied. In one method the reaction of UF, with BeO to produce
UO2 is utilized. In the other method, the reaction of UFh with water
vapor produces U02. The sharpness of the separation with water vapor
may be advantageous in processing schemes. It is thought that a
process can.be developed that will eliminate the need for fluorine
and that will provide for the simultaneous removal of uranium and
thorium. A further step would be required to remove the rare earths.

Measurements were made of the solubility of neon in LiF-BeF,,
and 002 in NaF-BeFe.

In the study of the chemistry of the corrosion process, further
samples of melts from operating INOR-8 and Inconel forced-circulation
loops were analyzed for chromium. The chromium concentration in the
LiF-BeF -THFA-UFh mixture in the INOR-8 loop reached a plateau of
about 550 ppm after about 1200 hr of operation. The chromium concen-
tration of the same salt mixture in the Inconel loop inereased more
rapidly than in the INOR-B loop and after 1700 hr was still increasing.
These tests are continuing._ R '_

Most 1nvestigatlons of corrosion behavior depend on accurate
analyses for structural metal ions, and therefore anomalles in the
present analytlcal methods are being studled

 Tests of the permeabllity of graphite by molten fluoride salts

'have continued Three types of graphite that were specially treated

impregnation with L:'LF-MgF2 salt and were considerably resistant to
penetration by a typical reactor fuel. Unexpectedly high concentrations
of uranium in the center of the rods are being investigated.

The in-pile thermal-convection loop for testing fused-salt fuel
in INOR-8 tubing in the LITR was operated in preliminary tests out-of-
pile, and satisfactory circulation was obtained. Final assembly of the
loop system is under way. Two fuel-filled INOR-8 capsules were installed
in the MTR and are being irradiated at 1250°F.

A device for testing a proposed fuel sampling and enriching
mechanism was constructed and tested. It was found that the rate of

solution of solid UFu‘in LiF-BeF,, would be adequate for convenient

enrichment procedures. ° | |
The use of molten ammonium bifluoride as a reactant for preparing -

both simple and complex fluorides and the preparation of pure chromous

fluoride by the reactibn of chromiuvm metal with molten stannous

fluoride were studied.

2.3. TFuel Processing
Studies of the processing of molten fluoride salt fuels by the.

 

fluoride-volatility process were continued. Further measurements of
the solubility of neptunium (IV) in aqueous solutions saturated with
LiF-BeFe-THFh-UFh indicate that a solubility of the order of 0.0002
to 0.00005 mole % msy be expected in actual processing.

1.1. NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STUDIES

Nuclear Calculations

Effect of Ion-Exchange Processing of Rare-Earth Fission Products on
Performance of Interim Design Reactor Fueled with U233

It was reported previouslyl that substantial savings in fuel
burnup and inventory could be achieved in the Interim Design Reactor2
fueled with U™ by passing the fuel salt repidly through beds of
Ce‘F3 t0 remove the rare earth fission products. The effect of ion
exchange processing on the performance of the same reactor system
fueled with US> has now been studied. The results for two different
processing rates — once per year and 12 times per year — asre compared
in Pig. 1.1.1. Processing at the rate of once per year (1.7 ft3/day)
could be performed either by the fluoride-volatility method; or by
the ion-exchange method. Because of the high cost associated with the
discarding of carrier salt in the volatility method, it is not feasible
to use the volatility process for the higher rate.

It may be seen that processing at the higher rate gives only a
small improvement in performance. It is doubtful therefore that the
ion-exchange process offers any sﬁbst&ntial economic advantage in the
Interim Design Reactor system fueled with U-SS,

studied, and typicel results are presented in Table 1.1.1 and in
Fig. 1.1.2, where regeneration ratio, critical inventory, and net
cumuletive burnup are plotted as functions of time of operation.
Without processing, the regeneration ratio falls from 0.8 to 0.5 in
20 years. The fuel additions required to override fission-product
poisons are large; the critical inventory rises from 800 to 1800 ke
of fuel, giving an average specific power of only 0.4 Mw/kg. The
burnup is also large, averaging 0.45 g/Mwd.

Processing the fuel salt to remove fission products at the rate
of one fuel volume per year (2.5 ft3/day) stabilizes the regeneration
ratio at above 0.8. The inventory averages about 750 kg. The burn-
up is reduced to 0.21 g/Mwd. Increesing the processing rate to 12
fuel volumes per year (30 ft3/day) improves the performance only
slightly.

Although it is uncertain that a core vessel and blanket could
be incorporated into this reactor, it was of interest to evaluate
the nuclear benefits of such an arrangement. Accordingly, the thick-
ness of the INOR-8 reactor vessel wall was reduced to 1/2 in. for
the calculations, and a 30-in. blanket containing 13 mole % ThF; in
a mixture of LiF and BeFQ was added. The blanket system was processed
12 times a year by the fluoride-volatility method to remove U233,
which was added to the fuel salt. The fuel was processed 12 times
a year by the ion-exchange method to remove fission products. The
results of the- calculations are presented in Table 1.1.2, and the
performance 1s indicated in Fig. 1.1.2 by the lines labeled UZ3° 12,B.

-'The regeneration ratio averaged in excess of 0, 96 and approached 1.0
;in the steady state.. The critical inventory was not decreased
| significantly, but was shifted toward U233 in composition (90%). The
f;burnup was reduced to 0. 056 g/MWd, and the reactor was ‘practically
7k}f>self-sustaining. However, it was estimated ‘that the savings in mills
-'}7:per kilowatt-hour effected by reducing the burnup costs would be more
-ffthan offset by the additional capital costs of reactor vessel, ‘blanket
' 'msterials, pumps, processing equipment, and concomitant operating costs.

In a further extension of the calculations, the nuclear benefits
to be obtained by the use of a graphite core vessel (in place of INOR-8)
and fueling with U233 were studied. These changes are, of course,
impractical in the present state of technology. However, the study
was performed in order to define the limiting nuclear performance of
this particular core and fuel system.

The results of the calculations are presented in Table 1.l1.2, and
the performsnce is indicated in Fig. 1.1.2 by the lines labeled U-o-
12,B. The regeneration ratio is stabilized above 1.06, the average
inventory is sbout 650 kg, and the cumulative net burnup is slightly
negative, amounting to -250 kg of y?33 in 20 years. However, 76 kg
of this is required as increased inventory in the fuel salt to override
fission products and nonfissionable isotopes.

It is concluded that the nuclear performance of the one-region
reactor fueled with U235 and processed by either the volatility or
ion-exchange methods at the rate of one fuel volume per year is
competitive with the best performance of the solid fuel systems, and
therefore the molten-salt reactor will yield lower over-all fuel costs
when the potential economies of continuous, chemical proeessing of
the fluid fuel are realized.

Initial Nuclear Performance of One-Region, Graphite-Moderated, Graphite-
Reflected, Thorium-Conversion, Molten-Salt-Fueled Reactors

The initiel nuclear characteristics of a heterogeneous, graphite-
moderated and -reflected, one-regibn, molten-salt-fuéled reactor were
studied. The reactor considered in the study consists of a cyllndrical
core, 15 ft in dia and 15 ft high, surrounded by a 2.5~ -ft-thick graphite
reflector contained in an INOR-B pressure shell 1.5 in. thick. The
core is penetrated by cyllndrlcal fuel passages arranged in an 8-in.
trlangular lattlce parallel to the core axis. The resulting unit cells

- are hexagonal and 15 ft long This system: has been investlgated over

' a range of fuel volumetric fractlons in the core and at two concen-

trations of thorlum in the fuel salt., The initial nuclear character-
istics of the system, with an external fuel volume of 673 ft3 are

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

given in Tebles 1.1.3 and 1.1.L for the cases heving 13 and 7 mole %
TﬁFh‘in the fuel, respectively; Fig. 1.1.3 shows the regeneration ratio
as a function of the system inventory.

The modified Oracle program Cornpone was used to calculate the
multiplication constant and group disadvantage factors for the fuel
and graphite. The results were then used for complete reactor calcu-
lations in spherical geometry on s core having the same volume as the
cylindrical core. Mean, homogeneized densities (atoms/cmS) were used
for each element. ‘ |

It may be seen from Fig. 1.1.3 that, in the case having 13 mole %
ThF) in the fuel, a meximum regeneration ratio of 0.846 is obtained
at an inventory of approximately 1150 kg of U237, with 7 mole %_ThFh
in the fuel, an estimated maximum regeneration ratio of 0.798 at an

235

inventory of approximately 900 kg of U was obtained.

Nuclear Performance of Two-Region, Graphite-Moderated, Molten-Salt-
Fueled, Breeder Reactor

 

The nuclear performance of spherical, graphite-moderated reactors,
5 £t in diameter with fuel volume fractions of 0.10 and 0.15, was
studied. The fuel channels were 2.6 in. in diameter and were arranged
in an 8-in. triangular lattice. These reactors were surrounded by
2-in.-thick graphite core vessels and 30-in.~thick blankets.

The fuel consisted of 71 mole % LiF, 16 mole % BeF,, and 13 mole %
ThFh plus UFh' The blanket salt had the same composition as the fuel,
but no UFM'

The performance of these reactors over a period of 20 years was
calculated for power levels of 125 and 250 Mw. The processing rate

in all cases was 12 fuel volumes per year. The system volumes used

- for these calculations are shown in Teble 1l.1.5; only the heat exchanger

volume was increased for higher power levels.

The results of the calculations are presented in Tables 1.1.6 and
1.1.7 and are plotted in Figs. 1.1.%, 1.1.5, and 1.1.6. It may be seen
that the only reactor with a doubling time less than 20 years is the

250-Mw reactor having a fuel volume fraction of 0.10. For both cores,

the regeneration ratio drops off at the higher power level. This was
234 and U236

to be expected because of the buildup of U ; also, since
the processing rate was the same for all power levels, the concentration

of the fission fragments was increased at the higher power level.

racle Code MSPR-Cornpone 020
A revision has been made of the element absorption edit of Oracle

code MSPR~Cornpone 020, which now permits an immediate edit on paper

tape. Previously it was necessary to wait for'curve-plotter plectures.

It is now possible to compute_the'breeding ratio and prepare the input

for Sorghum as soon as the case is run.

The cross-section tape has been checked and corrected where

necessary, and an edit has been obtained for the cross sections.

There are 32 lethargy groups, with the last at 1180°F. Element US3S

has zero absorption cross sections in all groups. It must be combined
with one of the other U238
cross sections except absorption, to compose a complete set of cross

sections for U . The options permit the selection of a set of

options listed, which have zeros for all

absorption cross sections properly adjusted with respect %0 resonance
saturation and Doppler broadening. The numbers in parentheses indicate
the concenﬁration in mble % of U238Fh in mixtures of LiF and BeF2 such

lithium and beryllium fluorides and graphite (denoted by G in parenthe-

ses) are available.

Design of 30-Mw Experimental Reactor

Work is continuing on the 30-Mw, one-regioﬁ, experimental, molten-
salt reactor described in the previous report. The basic reactor
concept has remeined unchanged. More details of the equipment have
been developed, and various auxiliary system layouts are being studied.
A reactor site has been selectéd,fér désign purposes, end perspective
drawings of a test'feactdr buildingrhéve been prepared.

Thefbaydnét&type fuel-to-coolant heat exchanger is being redesigned
in an effort to'simplify'the fabrication problems. Design data for use
in laybut studies have been brépared for a U-tube, U~-shell, coolant-

sathto-steam superheater.

‘Fuel Drain System

The fuel drain system consists of four 2-1/2-ft-die vessels
approximately 20 ft long. These tanks will be suspended in a vertical
positibn and manifolded to the reactor with pressure-siphon drain
lines. Two drain vessels will be required to contain the fuel system
inventory, and each pair of tanks will have a separate system to isolate
it from the reactor. The two extra drain tanks will provide capacity
for a spare salt volume, which may be used for fuel system cleahing or
decontamination operations.

The vessels will be preheated and afterheat will be removed with
a recirculating gas system. This gas system, as in the case of the
reactor ges system, will include a blower, heater, and cooler packages
enclosed in a loop.

The drain system criticelity prdblem'is being investigated. A
multiplication constant of less than 0.5 was obtained for one drain
vessel presumed to contain the entire fuel system.UFh inventory in an
LiF~BeF2 salt mixture. As a further check, the U235 was assumed to
settle out in the vessel as an oxide compound, and multiplication
constants are being obtained for four different geometries of fuel
concentrate, with one edge reflected by the salt mixture. A maximum
multiplication constant has not yet been obtained, but, with the fuel
concentrated in a cube, the multiplication constant was 0.83. It is
believed that this value would increase slightly with further settling
of the fuel. The bottom section of the drain vessel will therefore be

made with a smaller diameter to reduce the potential hazard.

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Salt-Lubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings |

The sixth test of a journal bearing operating in molten-salt fuel
130 (LiF—BeF2-UFu, 62-37-1 mole %), as deseribed p:eviously,l was
terminated on schedule. During this test the temperature of the salt
was increased in 50°F increments from iEOO tollBOOQF. Performance was
satisfactory throughout the entire tesf, which was conducted at a -
constant journal speed of 1200 rpm and a constant radial load of 200'lb.,
The total operating time for this test was 192 hr. -

A seventh test was then performed with the bearing and journal used
in the fifth and sixth tests. This test also consisted of steady-state
operation at a journal speed of 1200 rpm and a radial load of 200 1b,
but start-stop operations were carried out three times at each test
temperature. The temperature was varied as in the sixth test from 1200
to 1400°F in 50°F increments. On attempting a second restart at the
1400°F temperature level, an increase in the power required was noted,
and the test was halted. The total operating time for this test was
216 hr. Inspection revealed a galled spot on the loaded side of the
bearing. |

The eighth test was conducted to study the effect of increasing
the bearing radial clearance (measured at room temperature) to 0.007
in. All bearings pre#iously tested had a radial clearance of 0.005 in.
Molten-salt fuel 130 at 1200°F was used for this test, and the bearing
radial load was varied from 50 to 500 1lb at each of two journal speeds,
600 end 1200 rpm. After 356 hr of operation, including 39 start-stop
sequences, a sudden increase in power halted the test. At the time the'-
power increase occurred the journal was operating at 600 rpm, and the

‘load was being increased from 300 to 400 1b; the load had reached 382 1b.
From the standpoint of minimum film-thickness, these conditions were the

most stringent yet imposed in these molten-salt-lubricated bearing

tests.
A carburized INOR-8 journal was used with an uncarburized INOR-8

bearing for the ninth test. The tester was started and stopped 260

times during a period of operation of 272 hr at 1200°F. The Jjournal
speed was 1200 rpm and the bearing'was loaded to 200 1b.  Both the
bearing and the journal were in good condition, with undamagea surfaces,
at the end of the test. The bearing is shown in Fig. 1.2.1 and the
journal in Fig. 1.2.2.

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings

Assembly of the thrust-bearing tester described previouslyl is
nearly completed. The thrust-load actuator is being given preliminary
tests prior to being fitted to the rotary portion of the tester.

Test of Pump Equipped with One Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing

Detailed design work is nearly complete on the modifications to be
made to a PK type of centrifugsl sump pump in order to replace the
lower oil-lubricated bearing with a molten-salt-lubricated hydrodynamic
Jjournal bearing. The external motor of the PK pump is being replaced
with an integral, totally encloéed motor. The configuration of the
modified pump is intended to simulate, in large measure, that of the
pump proposed for use in an experimental molten-salt reactor. Proposals
have been received for the fabrication of the motor and the pump shaft,
and purchase orders are being placed. An existing facility is being
prepared for tests 6f this pump. |

Bearing Mountings , . . . _
“Means are being investigated for flexibly'mounting INOR-8 Dbearings

_to INOR-B pump casings 80 that thermal distortion between the bearing

and the pump shaft journal can be accommodated. A diaphragm type of
mounting and a mounting that is somewhat similar to the Westinghouse
"Thermoflex" mount are belng.studied.

Mechanlcal Seals for PUmps

The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal2 being subjected
to an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has accumulated
an additional 1848 hr of 0peration since the previous report period, for
a total of 12,478 hr. The pump has been‘operating'at a temperature of
lEOOOF a shaft speed of 2500 rpm, and a NaK flow rate of 1200 gpm. The
maximum test-seal leakage rate was 3.5 cm /day, however, on an averaged
basis, the leakage is still negliglble. Two pump stoppages occurred —
one for reworking-the drive motor commtator and replacing the motor

brushes, and one as a precautionary measure during a power outage.

Pump Endurance Testing
3

An MF type of centrifugal pump has continued in operation,” and
has logged more than 15,500 hr (approximately 1 3/4 yr) of continuous
operation. No maintenance has been performed on the pump during this
period. During the last 13,&65 hr, a cavitation endurance test has been
under way with the pump operating at the steady-state conditions of 2700
rpm, 645 gpm, and 2,5-psig pump tank cover gas pressure at 1200°F. During
the quarter the pump was stopped five times. Two stops were momentary
and were caused by power outages. One stop was of 65 min duration for
replacing brushes in the motor-generator set. One stop was of 30 min
duration for celibrating the pressure-measuring devices. One stop was
for 60 min for freeing the system throttle valve that had become stuck.

started on June 13, 1958. The accumulated operating time is more than
T500 hr. Except for slight leakage of lead during the first 100 hr of
operation, there has been no further leskage.

~ The large lead pump sesl with a 3 1/k- in.-dia rotating shaft has
been operating for 3600 hr. Leskege of solid lead from the seal is
sporadic. The average leakage rate for the time qurated is 9 cm./hr.
Operational data suggest that the seal should be redesigned to prov1de
better coolant control and to incorporaté a short;7resilient packing to
decrease the annulus between the seal and the shaft. A detailed
description of the equipment was presented pre?iéusly.s At the present

tiﬁé, the operating conditions are the following

Design, Construction,-and Operation of Materials
_ - Testing Loops ‘
Forced-Circulation Loqps' I o
The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-tésting
loops was continued. Fourteen test loops are presently in operation,
two Inconel loops were terminated as scheduled during the quarter, and
one new Inconel loop was started. A loop fabricated of INOR-8 is
presently being installed. ' |
The two Inconel loops, designated 9344-2 snd 9377-3 in Table 1.2.1,
vere terminated after one year of operation. The facilities from which
these loops were removed have now been revised according to the latest
design6 for long-term operation. Of the 15 available loop facilities,
11 are of the improved design, and the remaining four loops are in
various stages of improvements. - |
Several momentary power failures caused interruption of power to
the loops during the quarter, but flow resumed in all the loops after
power was restored, and there were no freeze-ups. The power failures
that have occurred since the beginning of this'mblten-salt-reactor

| corrosion~-testing progrem and the results of such failures are deScribed

in Table 1l.2.2.
The loops designated MSRP-12 and 9377-5 in Table 1.2.1 contain

to replenish the inventory and thus raise the fluid level to the normal
height in loop 9377-5 after 27 samples had been taken. The molten salt
was introduced into the pump bowl through the pump flange without
interruption of the flow or operation of the loop. Analyses of the
samples removed from these loops periodically are presented in

Section 2.2.

In-Pile Loops
The in-pile loop which vas 0perated in the MIR during the previous

quarter was disassembled, and the cause of the partially plugged purge
line, whlch resulted in the release of activity, was determined. Oil

'which 1eaked past ‘the pump shaft seal and filled the oil trap on the

purge outlet line was polymerized by radiatlon, and the polymerized oil
plugged the outlet line. Chemical and metallogrephic analyses of the
fuel and contalner materlals have not been completed.

The ‘second 1n—p11e 1oqp was completed and inserted during the
MTR shutdown of April 27. Modifications were made to the internal

35

 
 

 

 

purge system to minimize the prdbabiliﬁy of purge line plugging. In
addition, changes were mede to the external purge system which should
eliminate the possibility of a repetition of the activity release.
These changes included the installation of a charcoal trap in the
purge inlet line to prevent vack-diffusion of fissiqn ges into un-
shielded lines. A prototype in-pile pump identical to that installed
in the second loop has accumulated over 3600 hr of satisfactory

operation.

1.3. ENGINEERING RESEARCH

 

Phy
Enthalpy and Heat Capacity

 

Determinations were made of the enthalpies, heat capacities, and
heats of fusion of three additional beryllium-containing fluoride salt
mixtures: salt 133 (LiP-BeF, -ThFh, 71-16-13 mole %), salt l3h (LiF-
BeF,-ThF) -UF),, 62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %), and salt 136 (LiF-BeF o~UF),, T0-
10-20 mole %). The results of these measurements are presented in
Table 1.3.1 as the constents a, b, and ¢ appearing in the correlating
equations,

vhere H is the enthalpy (cal/g); cys the heat capacity (cal/g.°C); and

T, the temperature (°C). The experimental enthalpy data for these three
mixtures, along with earlier‘resultsl for related mixtures, are summarized
in Fig. 1.3.1. It msy be seen by comparing the results for salts 133

and 136 with the curve for mixture 130 (LiF-BeFQ-UFh, 62-37-1 mole %)

that sltering the salt composition toward larger percentages of the
high-molecular-weight fluorides (TnF), and UF)) causes a substential
decrease in both the enthalpy ‘and heat capacity (on a unit weight basis).
Replacement of the LiF in sa.lt 126 (I.a.F-BeF -UFh, 53-46-1 mole %) with
NeF (mixture 123; NaF-BeF -UFh, . 3-l+6-1 mole %) results in similer,

though smaller, reductions in the enthalpy and heat capacity. This

effeet will be studied further in order to establish a general ‘correlation
for the prediction of enthalples and heat cepacities in the LiF-Ber-
UFh-ThF system.j'

Viscosity

The viscosities of salt mixtures 133 and 136 have been obtained
over the temperature range from 550 to 800°C with the "skirted" capillary
efflux viscometer previously described.2 . The viscometer cups used for
the measurements were those employed in the earlier studies with salts
130 and 134. Recalibration of these cups with the NalO,-NaNO,-KNO,
(40-7-53 wt %) mixture showed negligible changes in the kinematic

viscosity—efflux time relation. The results, correlated in the form

L = AeB/T ,

where u is the viscosity (centipoise), T is the temperature (°k), and A
and B are experimentally determined constants, are as follows:

Salt 133 A = 0.0526; B = 4838

Salt 136 A = 0.0489; B = 48LT

The data are plotted in Fig. 1.3.2 and compared with data from

measurements of salts 123, 126, 130, and 13&.3 The "high" results with
mixtures 123 and 126 will be rechecked with the new type of viscometer.
In Fig. 1.3.3, the data for salt 136 are compared with Mound Laboratory
results  for the same mixture that were obtained with a Margules design

viscometer consisting of two concentric Inconel cylinders. The outer

of the two cylinders contained the fused salt and was rotated at a fixed
speed with reference to the inner stationary cylinder. The viscosity
was determined from the torque exerted en the immer cylinder. The
reason for the discrepancy between the two sets of data has not yet been
established.' ' L

134 data are essentially identical with the results obtained for salt
130, except for a slight difference in the temperature dependence.

Heat~Transfer Studies

Flow calibration of the system designed for determining surface
film formation in molten-selt systems by heat transfer coefficient
measurements has been completed. A Tygon-coupled mockup was used, and
water was the working fluid. The test unit is shown in Fig. 1.3.5, and
the key components are indicated. The over-all system pressure drop
was obtained with a 100-in. mercury manometer connected at the pump inlet
and outlet lines. The data indicate a pressure difference of about 48 psig
for a flow of 2.8 gpm. This corresponds to a test-section Reynolds
modulus of 11,000 et 1200°F with a salt such as mixture 130 (LiF-BeF -
UF),; 62-37-1 mole %). Initial attempts to determine the flow rate vs
pump speed characteristic by a weight method were unsuccessful, and a
rotameter was used in the final calibration. A magnetic-pulse pickup
coupled with a Hewlett-Packard counter yielded the pump speed to within
+1 rpm over any lO-sec counting period. The charaéteristic curve obtained
was very nearly linear between 2000 and 6000 rpm, ranging from 1 to 3
gpm, respectively. | o - ' |

Hydrodynemic Studies

The pressure drop through the sintered-metel-filled annulus of a
double-valled tube has been determined.” A tube of this comstruction
has been proposed for use in steam-generation systems associated with
molten-salt power reactors. It is hoped to provide good thermal contact
between the low-pressure primsry salt and the high-pressure steam and
at the same time effectively isolate the two fluids in the event of a
wall failure. The sintered medium.wbuld.be filled with static helium,
at an intermediate pressure, vhich would give an indication of a breek
in either wall. | |

The results of this study of the flow of helium through two speci-
mens of doubleQwalled Inconel tubing containing sintered Inconel of
different porosities are given in Fig. 1. 3 6. The correlating lines

can be expressed by the equations:

0.979
= AP
Gg = 0.3’-!-_2 (P —IT)

for specimen 1, with a porosity of approximately 59%, and
0.960
¢, = oooh6( A1’)

for specimen 2, with a porosity of approximately 25%4. In these corre-
lating expressxons, Gg is the mass velocity based on the geometric
cross-sectional area (1b /fts), P is the mean helium density (1b /ft3),
AP is the pressure drop through the sintered material (1b /fta), and L
is the length of the sintered section. The experimental precision was
estimated to be +8%. The two curves in Fig. 1.3.6 are nearly parallel,
with slopes only slightly less than unity, and are in accord with the
statement of Darcy's law for the flow of gases in porous medis,

If it is assumed that the data follow Darcy's law exactly, the specific
'permeability coefficient, Bo, can be obtained for the two samples by
using the given porosities and mid-range values of Gg and 'P-AP/L. In
this manner, Bo vas calculated to be~62 x 10712 £t° for specimen 1 and
~164 x 10'11‘ £t2 for specimen 2, These results can be compared with B_
values of 216 x 10'12 ft2 for an unconsolidated sand of 37% porosity and
68 x 1o'lh £t° for consolidated small alundum particles with a 24%
porosity. In addition, the slope of approximately unity indicates that

the flow is in the laminar regime.

1.4. INSTRUMENTS AND CONTROLS

Molten~-Salt-~-Fuel Level Indicators

Visual and x-ray examination of a level probe used in the tests
described previouslyl have been completed. The probe appears to be in
excellent cbndition, both mechanically and electricelly. Disassembly
of the probe is in progress, and specimens have been sent to the
metallurgy department for corrosion examination.

Two new Inconel "I"-tube-type level elements have been completed
and installed in test vessels. Two identical level-measuring systems
are now com?lete, end prefilling checkouts of the systems are in progress.

Fabrication of an INOR-8 level element and test vessel is approxi-
mately 80% complete.

INOR-8 High-Temperature Pressure Transmitters

An order was placed with the Taylor Instrument Company for six
INOR-8 pressure transmitters and indicating systems. The units are
scheduled for delivery in early June.

The transmitter body will be febricated from INOR-8 plate. The
diaphragm material will be 0.005-in.-thick INOR-8 shim stock. The
menufacturer believes on the basis of preliminary tests that satisfactory
diaphragms can be made of this material. No unusual difficulties are
expected in the fabricetion of these units. |

The six units will be composed of three having e range of 0 to 50
psig, and three with a range éf'O to 100 psig. All units are of the
pneumatic-indicator type.

An examination of as-received specimens of tubing used for these loops
wes subsequently made, and similar cracks were detected in these
specimens. A typical flaw is shown in Fig. 2.1.2. The flaws were
apperently not detected by x-ray inspection of the‘tubing before loop
fabrication. Therefofe ultrasonic inspection of loop tubihg is now
being utilized to supplement existing inspection practices.

Inconel Thermal-Convection Loops

Three of the four Inconel loops for which metallographic exami-
nation results have been recently obtained were operated for one year,
while the fourth was operated 1000 hr. The exsmination results are

‘summarized in Teble 2.1.3. As indicated, the hot legs of all the
- Inconel loops operated for one year showed heavy intergranuler void

formation. Of particular interest is loop 1182, which circulated salt
126 for one year at 1350°F. Examination of this loop revealed heavy
intergranuler void formation to & depth of 15 mils, as may be seen in
Fig. 2.1.3. Chemical analyses of the salt showed no significant
changes in the impurity content. However, examination of the trap
ares, which was the coldest part of the loop, revealed a large quantity
of metallic particles. These particles are being analyzed.

General Corrosion'St&dies

Penetration of Graphite by Molten Fluoride Salts
The problems associated with the use of unclad graphite as a
moderator in a molten-salt reactor system are being studied. The

possibility exists that fuel salts would enter the pore spaces in the

graphite and create problems associated with (1) reactor fuel inventory,
(2) nhot spots, (3) effects from fission-ges release associated with
fuel in the pores, and (4) effects of thermal expansion of the salt

~as a result of thermal cycling of the reactor. The large volume change

which flﬁoride salts exhibit on melting could cause cracking or spalling

~of the graphite if sufficient pressure were built up by salt entrapped

in pores. , -
An exberimentai investigation has been étarted'to determine under
what conditions salts will penetrate graphite and to ascertain the
physical damage that might occur in the graphite as a result of thermal
cycling.- Both static-pressure and dynamic-pressure tests are beiﬁg

conducted. .

Stetic~pressure penetration tests have been made with graphite-
molten salt systems at 150 psia and 1300°F. In preparation'foi these
tests, grephite specimens were partially degassed by heating at 2372°F
for 5 hr in a vacuum of <4 u and then cooled to'roam‘temperature in
a pure argon atmosphere. When assembling the spparatus, the graphite
was exposed to room atmosphere for approximastely 5 hr. The apparatus
was then evacuated to < 12 # and held at 5729F for 15 hr to remove
lightly adsorbed contaminants.

In test, the graphite specimens were completely submerged in molten
salts at 1300°F, and a 150-psi pressure was spplied for 100 hr by using
an argon blanket gas. After the tests the specimens were examined for
penetrations of salt into the graphite by using radiographic, metallo-
graphic, and/or chemical analysis techniques. The specimens were also
weighed to detect weight changes. |

Both TSF and CCN graphite were tested individuelly in LiF-BeFe-UFh
(62-37~1 mole ¢, fuel 130). Macroscopic exemination of radiographs
of these graphite specimens did not reveal any penetration by fuel 130.
There was essentislly no weight gein (<0.01%) of the TSF grephite
specimen, but there was & weight gain of approximately 1% for the CCN_-
graphite specimen. Metallographic exsminations and chemical analyses
are being made to determine the location of the fuel 130 and/or resction
- products in the CCN graphite. The TSF grade will be examined in like
manner,

A static-pressure penetration test at 1300°F was also made with
fuel mixture 30 (N&F-Zth-UFh, 50-46-4 mole %) and CCN-grade graphite
to essist in evaluating testing techniques. Radiographic examination of
the graphite specimen used in this test indiceated that the fuel had

penetrated it throughout. The weight gain of the specimen indicated
that 29% of the calculated pore volume of the graphite had been filled.
Additionel static-pressure penetration tests are plsnned using fuel
mixture 130 with TSF, AGOT, and ATJ grades of graphite to evaluate

the effects of pressure and temperature on penetration.

A dynamic-pressure_penetration test apparatus has been devised
vhich allows the movement of fuel around the grasphite specimen to wash
avey reaction products that might form at the graphite surface end thus
plug pore spaces. This test equipment, which is further discussed
later in this chapter under "Welding and Brazing Studies,” is designed
to apply pressures up to 350 psia on the fuel side of the grephite
while the opposite side is being evacuated.

The CCN~-graphite specimen that wes penetrated by fuel 30, as
mentioned above, was thermslly cycled to determine whether thermal
expansion of the fuel 30 in the graphite pore spaces would cause
cracking or spalling of the graphite. During the thermal cycle, thermo-
couples indicated temperature changes from room temperature to lh36°F
near the outer surface and room tempersature to 779°F at the central
exis of the specimen within a 3-min periocd. In the first two minutes
of the cooling part of the cycle, the 1436°F outer surface temperature
was lowered to 842°F and the_779°F central temperature was lowered to
7529F. Radiographic and macroscopic examinations of the graphite
specimen at room tempera.ture did not revea.l any damage to it.

Since the volume expansions of fuels 30 and 130 from room temper-
ature to their melting temperatures are 17%: and ll%, respectively, the
lack of demage to the grephite suggests that ‘some penetration of molten
fluoride salts into the grephite pore spaoes might be tolerated. The

| ;specimen will be subjected to additional thermal cycles, and other
, penetration and thermal cycling tests of various txpes of graphite and .
- fluoride salts will be made.- '

Uranium Precipitetion from Molten Fluoride Selts in Contact with

Graphite

The fuel mixture LiF-BeF -UF), (62-37-1 mole %) was reported
previouslyl t0 have precipitated U0, in tests in vhich the fuel mixture
was contained in graphite crucibles at 1300°F. The graphite-salt
: systéms were tested in evacuated Inconel containers, and the précipitate
was observed by using radiographic techniques. In control tests under
similar conditions with two different batches of fuel mixtures in Inconel
containers without graphite crucibles, no UO, precipitate was detected

by raediographic examination.

2

To assist in determining the role of graphite in causing uranium
precipitation from graphite-fuel systems, a set of five tests was rﬁn
with different quantities of graphite and different salt—to;graﬁhite
contact areas. The tests were made concurrently at 1300°F, and the
.erl mixture used in each test was from the same batch. Graphite,
grade CCN, was used that had been machined and cleaned by sonic meens
in ethyl alcohol.

The test setups used are illustrated in Fig. 2.1.k, and the tests
are described below. In test A, the fuel was tested in the absence of
graphite in order to test both thé quality of the fuel and the assembly
methods used in fabricating all the test equipment. In test B, the
fuel was in contact with a large area of a large quantity of graphite
in order to establish a reference for uranium precipitation from the
fuel; the dimensions and configuration of the test duplicated those of
the standard graphite—fuel compatibility tests. In test C, the fuel
wveas tested in the presence of, but not in direct contact with, & large
quantity of grephite to determine whether the urenium precipitetion
was caused by degassing of the grasphite. In test D, the fuel was tested
~ in contact with & small area of & large quantity of graphite to determine,

in conjunction with the results of test B, whether the contact surface-
to-volume ratio for the graphite and fuel affected the quantity of
uranium precipitation from the fuel. In test E, the fuel was tested

in contact with a small area of a small quantity of graphite to
determine, in conjunction with the results of test D, whether the
quantity of graphite affected the gquantity of uranium precipitation
from the fuel. -
Radiographic examinations of each of the test setups at tota.l_-

accumilated test times of 5, 10, and 100 hr were made. No uranium
precipitation was observed for the control, test A (Fig. 2.1.4). A
small amount of uranium precipitation occurred in test E. A moderate
end epproximastely equal amount of uranium precipitation was found in
each of the other three tests. These results support the conclusion
arrived at previously2 that the uranium precipitation observed in
fuel 130 was the result of the fuel reacting with oxygen supplied by
degassing of the graphite. |

- Tests are in progress to determine whether a suitsble flush can
degas the graphite to such a degree thet it will contain fuel 130
without causing uranium to precipitate from the fuel.

Thermal-Convection-Loop Tests of Brazing Alloys in Fuel 130

A scheduled 1000-hr test of Inconel and INOR-8 lap joints brazed
with various alloys and exposed to fuel 130 in the hot leg of a thermal-
convection loop has been completed. Similar tests scheduled for 5,000-
and 10,000-hr periods are continuing. The configuration of these
thermal-convection loops and the manner in which the brazing alloys
ere incorporated in them was described previously.3 The brezing alloys

tested were:

The temperature of the circulating salt in the region of the test
specimens was 1300°F. B

Metallographic examination showed that a1l the brazing alloys had
good flowability on both Inconel end INOR-8 base metels. There was a
tendency for the formetion of diffusion voids in the fillets of the
joints brazed with the gold-nickel alloy. The General Electric No. 81
alloy was heavily attacked on Inconel base material. Coast Metals Nos.
52 and 53 were depleted at the fillet surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils,
Some slight cracking of the alloys occurred at the brazing alloy—base
metal interface. Pure copper showed good corrosion resistance and no

cracking.
Thermal-Convection-Loop Tests of the Cogpatibility of INOR-8, Graphite,
and Fuel 130 ‘
Fuel mixture 130 (Iar-sesa-urh, 62-37-1 mole %) was circulated in
an INOR-8‘thermal-convectionllooprcontaining a 10=-in. tube of TSF
graphite in the hot leg in order to ascertain whether the graphite would
cause carburization of the INOR-8. The loop operated for L4000 hr with
& hot-leg temperature of lBOOQF.
Metallographic examination of & loop section adjacent to the

‘grephite insert revealed that the carbide precipitates in the grain

boundaries were slightly larger near the selt-metal surface than
throughout the rest of the'specimen (Fig. 2.1.5); however, similar

precipitates have been observed in INOR-B tubing from corrosion 1oop

tests with no graphite present. _
Nﬁcrohardness measurements of the area 2 nils from the salt-metal

' surface were of the same magnitude as those dbserved in the rest of
'~ the specimen.t These values ranged randomly from 160 to 180 DPH.

A carbon content of 0. 037% was found by chemicel anaLyses of
two successive s—mil 1ayers taken at the inner surface of the INORuB

.tubing.r An’ additional series of layers to a depth of 35 mils was

anaxyzed and found to contain a range of carbon values from 0.01k to -

0. 026% Consequently, these different‘values are not considered to

be significant, especialLy in view of the 1arge quantities of inclusions

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

Creep Tests
Most of the creep tests presently being conducted in fused salts

are low-stress, long-time tests. The results of these tests will pro=-
vide accurate data in terms of stress, total strain, and creep rates
for INOR-8 et times in excess of 10,000 hr. None of the test specimens
feiled during the past quarter and therefore no data are available to
report. These experiments are being run at 1100 and 1200°F.

Fatigue Studies

The fatigue properties of INOR-8 at 1100 and 1500°F are being
studied at Battelle Memorial Institute under a subcontract from the
Metallurgy Division. A rotating-beam-type of test is used at
frequencies of 100 and 3000 rpm. The initial results reported were
for the 100 rpm and lSOOOF conditions. The data are summarized below:

 

Stress (psi) Cycles to Failure

: Thus, the stress to produce fatigue failure in 1 x lO6 ‘cycles is |

there is an initial peribd during which virtually no creep occurs. This
is followed by normal creep. In relexation tests, the load must be
increased during the early stages in order to maintain a constant strain.
These observations are important, since at low stresses the effects are
menifest over & thousand or more hours and the results in terms of creep
rete and total strain vs time measurements are attenuated.

The behavior pattern suggested that the metal migh} be contracting

‘88 & result of metellurgical instebilities., Isothermsl dilatometry

measurements indicate that there is contraction in certain heats of
INOR-8 but not in others, notsbly SP=-16 and SP-19. Metallographic
exeminations showed that those specimens which contracted contained
meny large esreas of second phase material. The stable heats had equi-~
axed grain structures with fine precipitates concentrated mainly in the
grain boundaries. There appear to be no significant differences in
either the major or minor alloying constituents in the heats examined,
except for the carbon content. However, stable heats have been found
that range from a special low-carbon melt up to heasts containing carbon
in excess of 0.1%. The specimens which contracted had carbon contents
vhich fell within this range.. Currently the contraction phenomenon is
being studied by means of resistivity measurements to determine temper-
eture-dependence and reaction rates. This study will be continued, since
ell heats have shown a plateau in the creep and relaxation values.

It is concluded from this group of tests and from the previous
testsh’5 of specimens aged for 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 hr that INOR-8
does not exhibit any embrittling tendencies that can be attributed to
high-temperature instebility. |

Triplex Heat Exchanger Tubing

Work is continuing on the development of techniques for febricating
2 heat exchénger tube made up of two concentric tubes with'a.porous
annulus between to permit'the pessage of a gas for leak detecﬁion. The
materials of construction presently being in#estigated are a ﬁorous
nickel coré cled on the outer and inner surfaces with Inconel or INOR-8.
Two methods .of incorporating the porous core into the snnmular space of
the concentric tubes are being considered: first, temping loose nickel
powder into the dnnulus and developing e porous core bonded to the
outer and imner tubes by suitable drawing and sintering operations; and,
second, bonding & prefabricated porous core to the outer and inner tubes
by suiteble drawing and-sintering operations. Results obtained by the

- first method were d.escribed'previous];y.6 Because of difficulties

encountered with an oxide layer being formed at the core-to-cladding
interface and causing poor bonding, fhis method of fabrication has
been discontinued in favor of the second method.

Porous nickel sheet is availeble from Micro Metallic Corp. in
four common grades, which differ in mean pore opening, as follows:

The sheet material has a density of approximately 50 to 60% of
theoretical, and 1/16-in.-thick stock cen be rolled into a 3/4-in.-OD
tube. Twenty-five feet of both grades E and G rolled into tubular
shape have been ordered for cladding studies.

An sttempt is presently being made to clad with Inconel a small,
semple, porous nickel strip received from Micro Metallic. The as-
received strip was ennealed for 1 hr at 1800°F and then bent around
the outside of a 0.625-in.-0D Inconel tube. The pdrous nature of the
reéultingiring can be seen in Fig. 2.1.7, which shows an enlarged |
view of the surface. Channeled spacers were tack-welded to the Inconel
tube adjecent to the porous ring to prevent slippage of the ring
during drewing and to provide a means of filling the annular space.
The assembly is shown in Fig. 2.1.8. An Inconel tube was placed over

+the assembly and the resulting triplex assembly was cold drawn from

1.000 in. OD x 0.500 in. ID to 0.855 in. OD x 0.468 in. ID, The tri-
plex assembly is now being prepared for sintering to promote bonding
of the porous ring to the Inconel cladding. A vacuum will be maintained
in the annulus of the triplex assembly during sintering. An evaluation
of the porosity and bond between ring and cladding will subsequently
be made.

Similar cladding experiments are to be performed by Superior
Tube Co. on Subcontract No. 1112. It is anticipated that these results
will help determine the feasibility of fabrication of a triplex tube

by a commercial vendor.

INOR-8 material up to 0.100 in. thick, and additional procedures are
being quelified for thicker sections in accordance with the methods
prescribed.by the ASME Boiler Cod.e.8

Several 1engths of 5-in. sched-40 pipe have been f&bricated from
1/4- in.-thick plate, and a welding procedure will be developed which
will be appliceble over the thickness range 1/8 to 1/2 in. A welding
procedure for 1/2-in. plate will also be developed, which will be
appliédble for thicknesses up to 1 in. The tests to be conducted
include reduced-section tension, side-bend, face-bend, and root-bend
tests, as well as radiographic and metallographic examinations.

It is expected that these welding procédures will be extremely
useful in febricating containment vessels end test components from
INOR-8. These procedures will serve also as en essential supplgmeht
to the mechanicel property data which are being accumilated for the
preséntation of INOR-8 as a case before the ASME Boiler and Pressure

Vessel Code Committee.

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8 Welds

Studies are continuing in an effort to improve the high-temperature
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal. These include the investigation of
techniques to deoxidize and purify weld filler metal during the casting
of originsal ingots. One promising method involves the use of & vecuum-
melted basic charge with additions of small quantities of aluminum,
titanium, mangenese, silicon, boron, and magnesium. Several different

 

heats of weld metal containing these and other additions have been cast
and febricated into weld wire. Analyses of these heats are presented
in Table:2.1.5, and analyses of commercial materials are included

for comperison. The mechanical property velues obtained to date for
these materiels are summarized in Teble 2.1.6, and properties of other
meterials are included for comparison. The results of the mechanical
property tests on these filler metals will permit an evaluation of the

relative merits of the various deoxidation and purification practices.

Fabrication of Apparatus for Testing the Compatibility of Molten Salts

and Graphite .
Equipment was fabricated which will be used by the General Corrosion

Group to study molten salt penetration of graphite in a dynamic, high-
pressure'system; Before this apparatus could be fabricated, it wes
necessary to develop & method of attaching an Inconel tube to a hollow
cylindricai graphite specimen and thereby forming a leaktight connection.
This was accomplished by brazing with a commercially availsble braze
alloy composed of silvér, titanium, and copper'that was found to wet
vacuum~degassed graphite.

The large difference in thermal expansion of the graphite and the
brazing alloy caused some shedr cracking in the graphite. However,
metallographic sectioning of sample Jjoints indicated that the cracks
were rather limited in length, and pressure testing of the completed
joint with air indicated no leakage other than that associated with
the inherent porosity of the basé graphite.

The graphite-to-lnconel assembly prior to brazing is shown in
Fig. 2.1.9, and the completed specimen is shown in Fig. 2.1.10. The
completed Inconél test rig with associated entry, drain, and purge lines
is shown in Fig. 2.1.11.

Phase Equilibrium Studies

The System LiF-BeF,-ThF,

A revised pha;e di;gram for the system LiF-BeF2-ThFh is presented
in Fig. 2.2.1 that includes data obtained by increasing the equilibration
period in thermal-gradient quenching experiments to three weeks. Quenched
samples from such experiments revealed that the area of single-phase
ternary solid solutions involving 3L1F}ThFh is greater than previously
reported;l’2 it occupies approximately the triangle indicated by cross
hatching in Fig. 2.2.1. Invariant equilibria in the system LiF-BeFa-ThFh

The revised diagrem shows that the composition LiF-BeF,-ThF) (67.5-
17.5-15 mole %; liquidus temperature, 50000) has a higher ThF) concentra-
tion than breeding mixtures of current interest, such as LiF-BeF ,-ThF),
(71-16-13 mole %); also the liquidus temperature is slightly lower. The
occurrence of the unusual ternary solid solution in this system provides
these breeding mixtures with an advantage; on cooling, the first solids
and lest liquid to freeze are much closer in composition that would be
the case if no solid solution ocecurred. A description of the crystalli-
zation process for the composition LiF-BeF —ThFh (67.5-17.5-15 mole %)
demonstrates this point. On cooling to 500°C, the two solid phases
3LiF- ThFh (composition located in triangular solid solution area) and
TLiF- 6ThFh coprecipitate on a boundary curve. As these two solids
continue to freeze upon further cooling, the equilibrium liquid decreases
in thorium concentration and leaves the boundary curve before reaching
the peritzctic point at LiF~BeF -ThFh (63 29.5-7.5 mole %, hSEOC) The
liquid then changes composition toward another peritectic at LiF-BeF -
ThF), (60. 5-36.5-3 mole %) and freezes completely in the vicinity of the
latter compositlon. Since the quantity of liquid remalning in the region

of the peritectic is much less than if no solid solution existed, most

of the solids formed on coollng LiF-BeF -ThFh (67 5-17. 5-15 mole %) will
'be formed between 500 end hSO C and tendencies toward segregation will

',2be reduced._rf*ii"

The System NaFuBeF uTth R _ L , . _
Evidence has continued to accumnlate on the extensive substitution

rof UFh for ThFu to give solld solutions in systems containing BeF2 ‘and’
‘alkeli metal fluorides. “The’ resulting solid solutions are compounds of

77

 
 

 

 

 

alkali metal fuorides with UFh and ThFh; they melt at considerably lower
temperatures than the corresponding thorium compounds. Accordingly, the
phase diagrams of ternary systems of an alkali fluoride with BeF2 and
ThFh are useful as guides to selections of converter-reactor fuel mixtures
from the otherwise extremely complex quaternary systems containing UFh

Progress toward completion of the phase diagram for the system NaF-
BeFE-ThFh is shown in Fig. 2.2.2. The composition of the single ternary
compound occurring in the system and the location of the boundary curve
separating the primary phese fields of ThF) and this ternary compound
have not been determined. The compositions that show the maximum solubility
of ThF), at 550°C are NaF-BeF,-ThF) (76-10-1h mole %) and NeF-BeF,-ThF)
(50-38.5-11.5 mole %). |

The System.NdF-ThFh-UFh

The identity and aspproximate locations of the primary phases in the
system NaF-ThFh-UFh have been determined. Because of the solubility of
UF), in compounds such as.hNaF-ThFh, 2NeF «ThF) , 3NeF.2ThF), and 7NhF-6ThFh,
there are no phase fields for pure binary thorium compounds in the ternary
diagram. |

The System SnF -NHhHF
The SnF -NHhHF system was investigated because of its potentiall-

 

ties as a strongly oxidizing, low-melting solvent for reprocessing fuels.
Liquidus temperatures were noted by visually observing precipitation
upon cooling. At temperatures higher than lBOOC, the solution bubbled
and formed a scum which not only interfered with observations but also
changed the composition of the melt. Therefore reliable data were .
obtained only in the range O to L40% SnF,. The compound NH)HF, melts at
12500, and a 15 mole % addition of_Sn'F2 lowers the melting point to
about 100°C. Further additions of SnF., increase the liguidus temper-
sture to 150°C for the mixture containing 40 mole % SnF.,.

Heating a mixture of 35 mole % NH) HF, and 65 mole % SnF2 resulted
in considerable evolution of gas and gave a melt with a liquidus temper-
ature of 2h0°c,_which 1s well sbove the melting point of SnF2 (218°¢).

The solidified product gave a simple but unidentified x-ray diffraction
pattern. Thus it appears that the sample was predominantly a new
compound. Petrographic results confirmed the presence of a new compound

and showed that still another unidentified phase was present to the

extent of about 10%.

Solubility of PuF. in Converter Fuels

Interest in the possibility of comverting US
Pu239 in molteﬁ-fluoride-salt fuels led to measurements of the solu-
bility of PuF3 in the mixture LiF-BeF,-UF) (70-10-20 mole %). The
apparatus and techniques were described previously.3 For the'first
solubility determination, weighed amounts of LiF, BeFe, UFL, and Pu'F3
were melted directly in the filtration apparatus and heated to a maximum
temperature of T16°C in a mixed atmosphere of argon and HF. The mixture
was theh cooled and equilibrated at 562 to 56700 for 105 min before
filtering at 567°C. Three other filtrates were obtained from a melt
that was pretreated by heating LiF, BeF2, and UFh in a platinum dish,
with NHLF-HF added to prevent hydrolysis, at a maximum temperature of
725°C for 30 min and cooling in an argon atmosphere. A plot of the
data in Table 2.2.2 as the log of molar concentration of PuF3 versus
the reciprocal of the absolute temperature indicated that the solu-
bility value obtained at 567°C was about 0.15 mole % too high to fit
the straight line through the points for pretreated melts. The reason
for this slight discrepancy is not known. All the Pu'F‘3 solubilities
obtained in LiF-BeF,-UF) (70~10-20 mole %) are higher than those
obtained with LiF-BeF2 mixtures having about the same LiF concentration

but no UFM.

precipitation of LiF; under favorable conditions about 70% of the LiF

which NaF was added to an LiF-BeF2 mixture at 70000 and cooled to 49000.
Analytical results on filtrates at 600°C and 490°C showed that only

SmF3 (a) + CeF3 (s)== CeF3‘(d) + smF3 (s) (1)
Experiments have shown that the exchange
Ce*F3 (a) + LaF3 (s)===eIeF3 (a) + Ce*F3 (s) (2) -

is an analogue of exchange (1). Thus.Ce*F3 (1abeled), which has
desirsble tracer charecteristics, can be used in exchange (2) to

approximate the behavior of SmF. in exchange (1).

3
A proposed method of salt purification utilizing exchange (1)
would be to pass the salt through an isothermal bed of solid CeF3 to

lower the Sm'F3 content and then to lower the temperature of the effluent
salt to decrease the total rare earth content. To determine the
feasibility of the method, information is regquired on the rate of
‘exchange. The first exploratory rate test was conducted at 50000 with
en agitated CeF,-LiF-BeF, melt (1500 ppm CeF,, 62 mole % LiF, 38 mole

% BeF2) to which an excess of La'F3 was added. Within 1 min, the CeF

content was decreased to 400 ppm; within 5 min the system was at

3

equilibrium (300 ppm CeF3) with respect to exchange (2). The second
test employed a 1li-in. horizontal column of 3/k-in. tubing packed with
100 g of +18 mesh LaF,. The packed colum was charged at 300°C with
LiP-BeF,, (62-38 mole %) containing 1000 ppm CeF3, and 12 g of melt,
not counting the holdup volume, was transferred through the LaF3 at
18 gpm with a pressure drop of 3 psi. The CeF3 content of the effluent
ranged from 80 to 30 ppm. Attempts to continue the experiment at a
later time with the same packing gave evidence thaet the liquid was |
bypassing the La'F3 (s) end that future tests with vertical columns
should give better performance.
Chemical Reactions of Oxides with Fluorides in Molten-Fluoride-Salt

The chemicel reactions of oxides with UFh in molten fluoride
solvents have indicated that uranium can be separated from fission

products by fractional oxide precipitation. As mentioned previously,

BeO and water vapor appear to be desirable precipitating agents because
they do not intro&uce'eXtraneous constituente into BeF2 mixtures.
Investigations have continued on the removal of uranium from solution
by reaction'of UFh with BeO in a column-extraction process and on the
fractional precipitation of uranium with water veapor.

Extraction of Uranium with BeO. The reaction of UFh with BeO to
produce UO has been studied in several experiments.8’9 Observations
of the reaction in a packed column show several interesting characteris-
tics. A eutectic mixture of LiF-KF (50-50 mole %) containing 1 mole %
UF), was twice passed unidirectionally through a smell column packed
with extruded BeO (1/16 in. in dismeter and 1/8 in. long) at 600°C.

The column contained spproximately three times the amount of BeO
required for converting the UF, to U0,. During the first pass, 34 .6%
of the uranium was removed from 2 kg of liquid mixture at an average
flow rate of 700 gpm under a pressure drop of 5 psi. A second pass
removed en additional 30% of the initial uranium from solution. How-
ever, the average flow rate during the second extraction was consider-
ably slower (30 gpm), since a pressure drop of approximately 15 psi
developed. A third extraction was not attempted.

Calculations based on the experimental data show that 16% of the
beryllium oxide in the column rescted with UFh It is interesting to
note, however, that only 18% of the reacted beryllium was present in
~the column effluent at the completion of the experiment. A similar
retention of BeFa, probably on the surface of the BeO pellets, was
'previously noted 1n the conver81on of Zth to ZrO2 | ‘

of water vapor with UFh has been demonstrated.8 In reprocessing
molten fluoride reactor fuels, however, the separation of uranium

from the fission-product rare earths would be a primary requisite.

An experiment has shown that the reaction of water vapor with CeF3

in LiF-BeF2 (63=-37 mole %) is too slow for detection by a fairly
sensitive radiochemical tracer technique (precision, < +0.2%). In

two subsequent experiments, water vapor was allowed to react at 60000‘
with UF), (1 mole %) in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) containing 1.25 wt %
C&F3. In each case, UO2 was formed without any detectable precipitation
of Ce203 or BeO. The uranium concentration in solution at the stoichi-
ometric point of the reaction was on the order of 100 ppm in each
experiment. o

The sharpness of this separation is very favorable from ﬁhe
standpoint of reprocessing schemes, and it points to a method for
removing uranium without using fluorine. It also leads to a method
for removing urenium and thorium simultanecusly that would permit the
rare earths to be selectively precipitated in another step that could
be followed by redissolution of the uranium and the thorium in
reclaimed berren solvent.

An experiment for studying the reaction of water vapor with UFh
dissolved in LiF-KF (50-50 mole %) indicated e much lower rate of
reaction as a result of strong complexing of both 0 and Uh+ ions
in the melt. A negligible quantity of HF was evolved, and x-ray
diffraction examinations of filtrate samples taken from the reaction
mixture showed the presence of KF-2H 0. Treatment with 8500 meq of |
water resulted in the precipitation of 64 meg of urenium from solution
and the evolution of 30 meq of HF. A comparison with the reaction of
-water vapor with UF) dissolved in LiF-NeF (60-40 mole %) is plenned

as a further study.

Gas Solubilities in Molten Fluoride Salts

Solubility of Neon in LiF-BeF2

The investigation of the solubility of neon in a mixture of LiF-BeF2
(64-36 mole %) has been completed at 500, 600, 700, and 800°C covering
the pressure range of O to 2 atm. As in all previous studies of the
solubility of noble gases in molten fluoride salts, Henry's law is
obeyed, and the solubility increases with temperature. The solubility
decreases withrincreasing atomic weight of gas, and the enthalpy of
solution incresses.

‘Henry's lsw constants for this system are (3.09 + 0.09) x 10
(.63 + 0.01) x 10'8, (6.80 + 0.09) x 10'8, and (9.01 + 0.15) x 107
moles of He per cm3 of melt per atm at 500, 600, 700, and 80000, respec-
tively. A heat of solution of 5880 cal/mole was calculated from the

temperature dependence of these constants.

Solubility of CO, in NaF~BeF,

The solubility of CO, in molten NaF-BeF,, (57-43 mole %) has been
examined at 500, 600, 700, and 800°C at pressures from O to 2 atm. The
experimental data illustrate the linear dependence of solubility with
saturating pressures. Henry's law constants, K, at these temperatures
are (7.93 + 0.36) x 10"8, (7.05 + 0.14) x 10'8, (8.32 + 0.08) x 1078
moles of CO2 per cm3 of melt per atm. Of all the gas solubility data
for molten salt systems obtained to date, these are the first to show
e nonlinear log K versus l/T plot. A minimum is observed on this plot
in the vieinity of 600°%. - o

Chemistry of the Corrosion Process

| Samples from Operating Loops

 

Periodic sampling of the melts in forced-circulation corrosion-
test loops, as described in the previous report,lo has continued.u_One”
loop is febricated from INOR-8 and the other from Inconel. Both loops
were charged with the salt composition LiF-BeF ,~ThF) -UF), (62-36.5—l—0.5
mole %) containing about 400 ppm of chromium, and the maximum wall
temperature is 1300°F. |

The chromium concentration in the INOR-8 loop (MSRP No. 12) reached
a. plateau at sabout 550 ppm after about 1200 hr of operation and has
maintained this level for the last 1000 hr. In the Inconel loop
(9377-5) the chromium concentration in the salt rose gradﬁally during
the first 400 hr of operation to a value of 550 ppm. The increase
was more rapid than in the INOR-8 loop but was uniform. However, after
the first 400 hr, the chromium concentration began increasing very
repidly, es indicated below:

Chromium
Time Concentration_
(hr) (ppm)
500 800
650 950
800 1100
1700 2000

Since sample removals decreased the quantity of salt in the loop,
more salt was added after 2250 hr to permit further monitoring. Samples
taken before and after the addition of 0.6 kg of fresh salt showed 2100
and 1900 ppm of chromium, respectively. The-loop was allowed to circu-
late for three days (72 hr) and sgein sampled, end 2050 ppm of chromium
was found; after 2600 hr, 2350 ppm of chromium was present. The latter

value may represent an approach to a steady-state level, but the chromium

Radioactive Tracer Analyses for Iron in Molten Fluoride Salts

Most investigations of corrosion behavior depend on accurate
analyses at low dilution of Fe'’ and other structural metal ions. For
example, the validity of chromium diffusion ekperiments in systems
consisting of a molten salt and a chromium alloy depends on the purity
of the salt with respect to NiF2 and-Fer. Both compounds form CrZF2
from chromium; for example,

+ CrP=—=0CrF, + Fe° .

FeF o

2

Experimental equilibrium constants show that the equilibfium.concen~
tration of FeF2 in the presence of chromium should be too low to detect.
However, analyses obtained in the diffusion experiments indicated that
FeF was present at concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 ppm in
NaF-Zth (53-47 mole %) which had been in contact with Inconel ([cCr 2=
0.16 wt fraction). This anomaly suggested that finely divided iron
might be passing through the sample stick filters under certain con-
ditions. To investigate this possibility, 800 ppm of labeled FeF, was
dissolved in a nickel container filled with NeF-ZrF) (53-47 mole %)
solvent and then completely removed from solution by reduction with
zirconium. Standard counting procedures verified that no la‘beled.Fe++
or iron was present in filtered.portions of the melt after the zirconium
addition, elthough an average wet analysis of 205 ppm of iron was
reported for the same meterial.- It seems definite that currently used

'procedures result in mlsleading results from.wet chemical anslysis and

that the presence of iron in the melt as sampled is not the explanation.
The discrepancy is. being investigated. s |

Vapor Pressures of Molten Salts

The lowering of the vapor pressure of CsF (vepor pressure, 83 mmlT
He) at 1000°C by 20 mole % additions of alkaline earth fluorides has
been measured as part of a study of the effect of cation size and charge
on the thérmodynamic properties of fluoride melts. The smallest cation
Mg++ (radius, 0.783) gives a lowering of 30 mm Hg; ca’t (radius, 1.063’),
26 mm Hg; and Ba' (radius, l.h3g), 18 mm Hg, following the expected
order. Ffeezing-point depressions that reflect the same effects are |

also being measured.

Permeability of Graphite by Molten Fluoride Salts

Permeability tests on various types of reactor-grade graphite with
molten fluoride salts have continued. In the routine procedure for -
impregnating graphite with a molten salt, the graphite samples were
degassed under vacuum at 900 to 95000 end then treated with a molten
salt, such as LiF-MgF, (67.5-32.5 mole %), while still held under
vacuum., After the graphite samples were completely covered with salt
the vacuum was relieved and a pressure of 15 psig of helium was applied
to the system for U8 hr. At the end of 48 hr, the pressure was
relieved, and the molten salt was transferred awsy from the graphite.

'In previous tests, graphite rods 3-in. long and 1/4, 1/2, and 1 in.
in diameterlhad been used. For routine testing, l-in.-dia rods have |
“been adopted. |
- By using welded container vessels, shortening vacuum lines, and
'ﬁsing extreme care in assembly, the efficiency of impregnation has beeﬁ
inereased, as indicated by an average weight gain of 12.5% campared.wifh
8.5% in earlier runs on reactor-grade TSF and AGOT graphite samples. |

88
 

 

 

The objectives of the current exploratory tests are to determine
(1) how effective salt impregnation of graphite is in preventing or
decreasing penetratioh‘Of possible molten~selt reactor fuels at the
maximm reactor temperature, (2) the degree of penetration into untreated
graphite of typical reactor fuels under forced impregnation (vacuum
and pressure) conditions at the maximum reactor temperature (1250°F),
(3) the degree of penetration of typical reactor fuels into untreated
graphite under normal reactor operating conditions (in a 1000-hr test
in a circulating-salt system), and (4) the distribution of the main
fuel components {uranium, thorium, and beryllium) in the grephite when
penetration occurs.

Samples of three special types of graphite were obtained from the
~ National Carbon Company for testing. These were identified as follows:
ATJ-82, ATI~82, and AGOT-82. The number 82 after each type refers to
a special process used by National Carban to meke impervious graphite.
Because of the geometry of the available samples, the rods were machined
to 3/ in. OD and 3 in. long. Attempts to impreghate these rods of
special graphite with L:ILF‘-M’gF2 in the usual manner gave the following
results. The ATJ-82 graphite showed a loss in weight of 0.9%. The
ATL-82 graphite showed a loss in weight of about 0.1%. The AGOT-82
graphite showed & gain of 2.0%, and samples of TSF graphite, included
for comparison, gained 5.5%.

The rods were then subjected to a 1000-hr sosking test at 12500F
under a static hellum.pressure of 1. psig: in stirred LiF-BeF 'UFh (62-
37-1 mole %). The ATJ—82 gained 0. 27. in weight, the ATL-82 gained
_O h%, the ACOT-82 gained 2 1%, and ‘the TSP gained 2. 8%. These gains
are based on the weights of the rcds before and after the 1000~hr test

and do- not include the forced-impregnation gains or losses.

_' - Tb determine the penetration of uranium.and beryllium into these
;rods, successive l/32-in. layers were machined from the rods and sub-
‘-mitted for chemical analysis. When the rods became too small to machine
- Without breaking, the ends were cut off end the center section was

submitted for analysis. Typical results are listed in Table 2.2. 3.

The cut numbers were assigned so that cut No. 1 was the first cut taken
on the rod, cut No. 10 was the last cut teaken, and "center" indicates
the remaining center section, which was also submitted for analysis.

It appears that the ATL-82 and ATJ-82 grapites are resistant to
forced impregnation with IiF-MgFe salt and are considerably resistant

to penetration by a typical reactor fuel. The most startling observa-:‘

tion, however, is the unexpectedly high concentration of uranium in the
center section of the ATL-82 and ATT-82 rods. Subsequent long-term
sosking tests of reactor-grade graphites TSF and AGOT in a fuel mixture
of the same IiF—BeFE-UEh composition also showed disproportionately
high urenium concentrations in the center in every case. Efforts are
being made to determine the mechanism of this phenomenon and to further
verify it.

An experiment was carried out to determine whether untreated TSF ,

graphite could be forcibly impregnated with the LiF-BeF,-UF) (63-37-1
mole %) fuel mixture of current interest by using vacuum and pressure
techniques at the maximum reactor temperature of 1250°F. Six TSF |
graphite rods were used in this experiment, and weight gains that
renged from 0.1% to 1.85% were obtained. To determine depth of

penetration, these rods were machined, as previously described, and

the machine cuttinge plus the center section were submitted for analysis.
In all cases, the bulk of the salt penetration was in the first and
second machine cuttings. However, it was noted again that, in genersel,
the center sections contained several times (occasionally 200 times)
more uranium than the last cutting taken at about 1/4 in. from the

center.

Radiation Damege Studies

INOR-8 Thermal Convection Loop for Operation in the LITR

The in-pile thermal-convection loop for testing fused-salt fuel
in INOR-8 tubing in the LITR was operated in preliminary tests outside
the reactor, and satisfactory circulation of the salt (LdF-BeFE-UFh, |
62-37-1 mole %) was obtainéd. Radiography of the fuel tube after these
tests demonstrated that no opaque material had deposited at the bottom,
as in a previous loop test.ll

Thermocouples have been installed on the fuel tube of this loop,
and the air annulus tube has been assembled around the loop. Detailed
examinations of the thermocouples were made, and complete records of
their condition, including individual photomicrographs of each thermo-
couple, are avellable. This examination record will be used to correlate
thermocouple performance during operation in the reactor with the
initial conditions of the thermocouples. The informetion obtained will
be useful in the construction of future in-pile loops.

Modifications were*made in the cooling-air control system at the
reactor to provide for 1ndividual temperature control of various portions
of the loop. After resistance-heating elements have been instelled end
the loop inserted in. the outer can, the loop will be operated in the

‘LITR.

Preparation of Purified Materials

Purification, Transfer, and Service Operations

The processing of small batches of various molten-fluoride-salt
compositions for use in corrosion tests, physical property studies,
and small-scale component testing decreased considerably during the
first half of this quarter. However, demands have gradually increased
during the past month, and a normasl rate of operation is now being
maintained. A total of 35 kg of mixtures not containing beryllium
and 85 kg of beryllium-containing mixtures was processed during the
quarter. Transfer and service operations to assist engineering groups
in handling high-temperature fluids were continued at a slightly

increased rate.

Fuel Replenishment Tests

A simple device for testing the proposed fuel sampling and
enriching mechenism'® was constructed snd tested. The device employs
two salt storage pots interconnected by & transfer line, with the
enriching device on one pot and the sampling device on the other pot.
The molten salt is moved alternately from one pot to the other with
semisutomatic controls by using differential gas pressures.

Solid, cast, UF, fuel slugs weighing 40 g each were introduced to
the dissolution pot in a copper basket end the salt, LiF-BeF, (50-50
mole %), was cycled between the two pots. The rate of dissolution was -
méasured by withdrawing and weighing the amount of UFu-remaining;l
samples of the solution were also taken for chemical analysis.

A h0-g slug of UF), dissolved in 20 cycles (1 1/2 hr), but it was
not completely dissolved in 15 cycles (1 hr). This rate of solution

Pure Compounds Prepared with Molten Ammonium Bifluoride

Molten ammonium bifluoride (mp, 125°C) has served as a reactant
for preparing both simple and complex fluorides.lB’lh Recent trisls
show that commercial chromic oxide is not noticeebly attacked by molten
ammonium.bifluoride Megnesium oxide is converted into NHhMng, which
can be decomposed into pure magnesium fluoride. Beryllium oxide
(ealcined at 900 °C) 1s also converted to an smmonium complex.

When commercial "00203" powder is treated for 1 hr with molten
ammonium.bifluoride, a small amount of oxide 1s left unchanged. The
reaction product haes an x=-ray diffraction pattern somewhat shifted from
that of KCoF3, so it is presumed to be NHhCoF3 |

Nickel oxide was found to be more resistent to attack than "00203
A l-hr treatment left almost all the oxide unreacted.

The oxides GeO,, UO,, ThO,, and Ce0, seem to react completely with
molten ammonium bifluoride, but the products have not yet been identified.

Vanadium pentoxide reacts with molten ammonium bifluoride to evolve
yellow fumes. Presumebly, vanadium pentafluoride is formed; it is
reported to react with moist air to forﬁ.yellow oxyfluorides.l5

| For all the reactions with oxides, at least a 100% excess of
ammonium bifluoride was used in order to form a mixture which was
sufficiently fluid to stir.

Reaction of Chromous Fluoride with Stannous Fluoride . .
The reaction of chromium metal with molten stannous fluoride pro-
vides a useful method of preparing pure chromous fluoride;lh.howéver, -
an excess of stannous fluoride can further oxidize the chromium. The .
predominant phase resulting from the reaction of equal molar portions -
of stannous fluoride and chromous fluoride is a compound thought to be

moles of stannous fluoride appears to be stable at the boiling pointbf
stannous fluoride (~700°C). At 1000°C, all the stannous fluoride .
volatilizes and leaves a residue of chromic fluoride. The probable _

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

Processing of molten-fluoride-salt reactor fuel by volatilization
of the uranium as UFy appears to be feasible. The barren LiF-BeF, can
be recovered for reuse by treatment with nearly anhydrous HF, in which
it is appreciably soluble, and in which rafe earth neutron poisons and
most other polyvalent element fluorides are insoluble. Development work
on the process has continued with a study of the behavior of neptunium,
which is possibly the most 1mportant neutron poison other than the rare
earths.l

Further measurements of the solubility of Np(IV) have indicated
that its solubility (Tsble 2.3.1) in aqueous HF solutions saturated
with LiF-BeF,~ThF) -UF), (61.5-37-1-0.5 mole %) will be considersbly less
than reported previously. Apparently the Np(IV) solubility is decreased
by the presence of excess'ThFh and UFL' The addition of nickel and
iron metals to solutions saturated with LiF, BeFa, and Nth also caused
a significant reduction in the neptunium solubility, except in anhydrous
HF. This is probably the result of reduction of Np(IV) to Np(III).

In a reactor'processing system the solution will contain much larger
amounts of rare earths, plutonium, uranium, and thorium than of nep-
tunium, and the container will be a metal, probably a nickel alloy.
Therefore & neptunium solubility of the order of 0.0002 to 0.00005
mole % is expected in actual processing.
