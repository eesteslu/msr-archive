Ethanol-Alkaline Hydroxide-Water Systems
Giorgio Peyronal (Univ. Milano, Italy)
Gazz. chim. ital. 79, T92-9(1949)

The zones of immiscibility of ag. alc. solns. of KOH and NaGH at 17°,
309, 60°, and 90° wers studied. KOH and NaOH showed considerably
different behavior. 1In the aqg. stratum, NaOH showed at satn. at all
temps. a greater degree of hydration than did KOH. This is contrary

to their behavior in pure aq. solns., and is explained by traces of
EtOH, which break the mol. assocn. of the NaOH. In pure satd. ag.
s0lns., these bonds between NaOH - 2 HoO groups are stable at room
temp. At 179, satd. solns. of NaOH are in equil. with the phase

3 NaOH - (3) EpO + EtOH, where only the No. (3) of the HpO mols. is
uncertain. Correspondingly zatns. of KOH are in equil. with the phase
KOH - 2 Hp0. 1In the upper alc. strata, there is for NaOH an extension
of the zone of the immiscibility whieh increases with rise in temp. for
both systems, but more strongly for NaOH than for KOH. This is explain-
ed by a breaskdown of the NaOB-EtOH assocn., which is affected more by
temp. than is the EtOH-KOH assocn. However, with KOH, this scission
takes place at 60°, because solid KOH - 2 EtOH m. at this temp. and
forms 2 strata. Between 60° and 90° no further dissocn. is evident 2
whereas, with NaOH, dissocn. continues progressively from 60° to 90°.
The results explain the different behaviors of NalOH and KOH in coned.
solns. contg. org. compds. with COO groups or OH groups, and the grester
tendency of NaOH to form addn. compds.

Investigation of the Hydrogen Bond of Aqueocus Solutions of Hydroxides by
the Method of Combination Scattering of Light

M. I. Batuev

Doklady Akad. Nauk S.5.5.R. 59, 715-18(1948)

In the spectra of highly concd. ag. solns. of KOH and NsOH (40 wt.-%)
there appears on the short-wave edge of the wide HoO band e sharply
prominent, although somewhat broadened line at 3630 cm.-l. This line
gradually fades with decreasing concn. (down to 0.5 wt.-%) and dis-
appears. In its place a faint band appears at about 3950 cm.-t. These
findings indicate that the quasicryst. structure is present in concd.
solns. and is destroyed with increasing diln. and dissocn. The OH ion
forms H bonds even in cryst. and quasicryst. lattices; therefore, it is
not a free ion. The high-frequency OH™ band is gbsent in the spectrum
of pure, distd. water kept in quartz vessels. The different chen.
nature of the OH groups of acids and of bases is spparent from the

fact that the optical evidence of the H bond appears at a higher fre-
guency in bases (4200-3600 cm.~1l) then in acids (3600-2800 cm."1).

W. G. Renshaw and J. A. Ferree
Corrosion T, #00-1 (1951)

In all of the expts. relating to air passivation, specimens were held in
air except at the instant when potential measurements were made. Where
passivation in HNO3, H3POL, or NaOH soln. was involved; specimens vere.
continuously held in these solns. after gctivation. Potential measure-
ments do not necessarily reflect practical experience in every case. The
measuring equipment used iz described, & wiring diagram is given for the
vacuum tube voltmeter, and further detalls of the tests. For general
corrosion resistance there is no better passivating agent than air, but
the surface must be clean and free from scale before passivation. This
is secured by the usual pickling treatment or by trestment with 20% warm
HEO3 soln. Stainless steel is not usually recommended unless the corYoO -~
sive medium handled is capsble of promoting and maintaining & passive
surface on the metal during service.

Concn. distributions were measured in the continuous countercurrent
dialysis of 20 wt.% NsOH in order to asdess 'the mass transfer in terms of
dialysis coeffs. appropriate to specific positions along the contact
path. For design purposes it is adequate to use an over-all coeff.

based on the logarithmic mean of the terminal conen. differences

between the lye and water cells. It was shown that the reduction of
relative resistance to transfer in the liguor films and in the membrane
will inerease the over-zll dialysis coeff. o

Chlorides of alkslil metals, made as pure as possible; are electrolyzed
in ag. soln. in an app. comsisting of a small cell (A) having graphite
snodes, an anode of Hg-Na amalgam having at least 1% Na, and an ag.
s0ln, of the pure chloride as electrolyte, and a much larger cell which
is divided into two parts, (B) and (C). An anode of graphite in ag.
chlorides is in (B), and an Fe cathode in NaOH soln. is in (C), which
is 2, 3, or 4 times larger than (B). The amalgam passes by gravity
from (&) to (B) to (C), a weir lying between (B) and (C) so that (C)
gets an amalgem of the highest Na content, and the amalgam in (C) is
spread over as large an area as possible. A pump passes the amalgam
from (C) to (A). The cell (B-C) runs at 10,000 amp. and 2.8-2.9 v.;
(C) at 300-500 amp. and % v.

BeO, AlpO3;, and LapO3 absorb HpO when melted and release it with eruption
upon solidification. The technique for the manuf. of artificial rubies
prevents HoO from interfering with the process in this manner. The same
phenomenon occurs slightly with ZrOp, but not at all with a mixt. of |
PrpoO3, Ndp03, and YbpO3 or with CaO, MgO, or Th0z. Since the temp. is
above 2000°, the Ho0 must be chemically bound to the oxide; consequently
g8se0us hydrnxide and hydroxide in soln. in the oxide melt must be %
present. The heat of formation of gaseous Be(OH)p and the heat of
volatilization of Be(0OH), aré caled. to Be approx. -47 kcsl. and -60
keal.; resp., from the data of Hutchison and Malm on the volatilization
of BeO in the presence of HpO vapor (CA 43, 5321h). Alp03 is more

Oxidation of Ni(OH)p by a current of air in the presence of NapSOj
increases with the amt. of NapS0g added up to a certain limit, sbove
which there is no further increase of the percentage of oxidation.

The pgreater the quantity of RapB80q used, the longer 1s the time requir-
ed for initiating the oxidation. Variation of the concn. of Ni(OH)s
does not vary the percentage of oxidation; hence, some definite compd
is formed Glucose retards the oxidation; sucrose, even more.

A method of producing an alkali metal hydroxide(I), e.g., NaOH, soln.
from Ca(0OH)s and an alkali metal halide (II), e.g., NaCl, by excha.nge
of ions comprises passing an ag. soln. of Ca{0H)p into contact with a
halide of a HpO-insol., strongly basic, anion-exthange resin (III) to
absorb OH ions and then tresting (IIT) with an ag. soln. of II of at
least 10 wt.% concn. to effect displacement of the absorbed OH ions with
formation of an ag. soln. of 5-15 Wt.% or more of I. III, which is a
quaternary ammonium base or a salt thereof, may be prepd. by the reaction
of a halomethylating agent (IV), e.g., chloro--or bromo-methyl methyl
ether, and the normally solid CgHg-insol. copolymers of monovinyl aro-
watic compds. (V), e.g., styrene, ar-methyl., ar-chloro-, or ar-
dimethylstyrenes, or vinyl-, or ar-methylvinylnaphthalenes, and a polyw
vinyl aromatic compds. (VI), e.g., divinylbenzenes, or -naphthslenes,
ar-divinyltoluenes, -Xylenes, or ~ethylbenzenes, which co-polymers may
contain 0.5-20% by wt. of VI chemically combined, e.g., interpolymerized
with V. Then the halomethylated vinyl aromatic resin is treated with a
tertiary amine (VII), prefersbly a tertiasry mono- or dialkyl N-substituted
alkancl or alkanediol amine by dispersion in a liquid, e.g., Ho0D, acetone
EtOH, at 25-100° for 4 hrs. to form s quaternary ammonium halide, which
is washed with HpO0, or preferably with an org. liquid, e.g., acetone,
EtOH, or dioxane, and then with HpO. VII may be dimethylethanolamine,
methyldiethanolamine, dimethylisopropanolamine, methyldiisopropanclamine,
and l-dimethylamino 2,3-propanediocl. The halomethylating reaction may
‘be carried ocut at room temp. or above in the presence of a catalyst, e.g.,
ZnClo, Zn0, SnCly, AlCl3, Zn, Suo, or Fe, while the copolymer is swollen
by, or dispersed in, an org. liguid, e.g., an excess of IV, that is less
reactive with IV than is the polymer. The method also may be used to
cone. weak (0.1-3%) ag. NaDH or KOH and to recover more cancd. NaOH from
waste liguor from pulp and pesper industries.

The stability of Fe(OH)o, Fe(OH)z, and Cr(OH),, prepd. by reaction of
FeS0y, FeCl3, Crp(SOy)3 with definite amts. of NaOH, was detd. in the
presence of nanelectroiytes, (peptizing agents, sugar, glycerol) and
electrolytes (pptg. agents, NapSO, MgSOy, Alg(SOL,) ). For peptizing a
metal hydroxide, sufficient nonelectrolyte must be presant tefore the
alkali is added to the metal salt. Also an excess of alkali, above that
needed theoretically for pptn. of the hydroxide, is necessary to obtain
the metal hydroxide in colloidal soln. When the NaOH concn. is increased
progressively, the min. ambt. of nonelectrolyte required to peptize a
given amt. of Fe(0H),; decreases gradually to a const. value. Glycsrol
is unsuitaeble for peptizing Fe(OH),, but it can peptize Cr{CH), even at
relatively high concns. Eowever, Fe(OH)g can be easily peptizéd by
glycerol in the presence of Cr(OH)3 The min. gquantities of NaOH and
sugar required for peptization of a mixt. of Fe(OH)3 and Cr(OH)3

greater than the sums of these reagents necessary to peptize like amt .
of the individual metal hydroxides. The mixed colloidal hydroxides are
more stable to ppin. by dialysis than are the individual hydroxides.
These observations point to the possibility of formation of a complex

The Cathodic Corrosion of Iron and the Formation of Crystallized Ferrite
at the Anode during Blectrolysis of Molten Sodium Hydroxilde

M. Doderoc (Inst. electrochem., Grenoble, France)

The electrolysis of molten NaOH between 500° and 750° leads under certain
conditions to c¢cathodic corrocsion and deposition of Na ferrite on the anode.
The cathodic corrosion is explained by assuming the formation of FeOoH-
ions and by a transfer of electrons from the soln. to the cathode, opposite
to the usual transfer. The formation of ferrite was assumed to result from
the secondary reaction which occurred after transfer of electrons from the
OH" and FeOoH™ ions to the anode. No corrosion occurred when as.c. was used.

Structural Study of the Dehydration of Magnesium Hydroxide
Julio Garrido
Ton 11, 453-64(1951); ef. CA 45, 9980a

Continuation of earlier work. To account for the x-ray spectra, 2 dif-
ferently oriented reciprocal lattices must be postulated. These 2 lattices
correspond to 2 orientations of the crystallites in which the (111) planes
are common to both. The 2 systems of crystallites are characterized as
orientation I with (110) of MgO parallel to (1010) of Mz(0H)s, (111} tc
(0001), and (100) to (1011), and orientation IT with (110) and (111) ss in
I and with (100) parallel to (1101). After dehydration at 50C°, 75-80% of
the crystallites are in orientation I. Rapid dehydrstion at higher temps.
(2.8, TOOO) produces supplementary spectra that do not correspond to the
Mg0 lattice; these spectra are found in positions corresponding to reflec-
tion with respect to the (111) plane of Mgl0. At still higher tewpsz. {20009)
the supplementary spectrs disappear and only the lines corresponding to
orientation I are found. The possible origins of the supplementary spactra
are discussed; a mechanism based on the existence of vacant lattice sites
iz considered most plausible. The product of the dehydration retains the
guperficial form and size of the original crystal; the individual crystal-
iites appear to be larger than 0.0001 mm., although some evidence points

to sizes of the order of 50 to 100 A. The way in which the bresking of
Mg=0 bonds leads preferentially to nuclei of orientation I is discussed.

Absorptlon of Carbon Dioxide by Solutions of Sodium Hydroxide and Sadium

The method described for the qtant. investigatian of the kinetics of
absorption during intensive mixing (with the magnitude of the phase
interface being unknown) is based on the maintenance of s const. phase
interface by the choice of temps. and concns. that correspond to the
const. phys. properties of the absorbent. If a high degree of turbu-
lence is assumed, the following relations hold for the absorption of
coz by NeOH and NapCO3 solns.: q = dw/e~. dt = 8p [KC + wn] / {KC + v,

/H}] in which g = rate of 5bsmrption per unit of time per unit of
interface surface; B = the hydrodynamic const. of the gas phase of the
const. of the rate of diffusion in the gas phase; p = the partial
pressure of C02; K = Kevy &7; Ko = const. of the velocity of the chem
reaction; vn = the hydrodynamic const.; A7 = the period of renewal of
the surface layer; C = the conen. of the chemically active component
of the soln.; H = the soly. coeff. Exptl. results showed that at high
turbulence the rate of absorption was proportional to the partial
pressure and that the concn. of the absorbent had a slight effect on
the rate of sbsorption. Under such conditions an increase in C result-
ed in a reduction of q in those cases in which an sbsorption process
and a slower chem. reaction were involved. It follows that the COp
dissolved in the vol. of the ligquid phase does not react.
