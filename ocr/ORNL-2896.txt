ABSTRACT

The phase equilibrium relationships for the systems limiting the
quaternary system LiF—Ber-UF4—ThF4 are described in detail along with
available information on the quaternary system itself. The implications

of the extensive solid solutions in the limiting systems are discussed

- and experimental information supporting the conclusions is presented.

The optical properties, crystallographic properties, and x-ray diffrac-
tion petterns for the phases occurring in these systems are tabulated..
Specific compoSitions of project interest to which references have been
made in the ORNL literature are given special attention. Reference is'
made to literature reporting properties of these materiais other than

those discussed in this report.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fluoride fused salts have attracted general interest for use in high-
temperature reactors because: (1) fluorine has a very low thermal neutron

1 (2) fluorides have low vapor pressures at tem-

absorption cross section,
peratures and compositions of interest,? (3) molten fluorides are very

resistant to damage by nuclear emissions,® and (4) there are no serious

corrosion problems between many fluorides and nickel-based structural ma—_

terial 2 Speczfically, uranium tetrafluoride, a flSSlle material, is of

1nterest because 1t lS the only nongaseous fluorlde of uranium which dces

a fertile material, is the only fluoride of thorium.% The fluorides PbF,,
BiF3, Li’F, NaF, ZrF,, and BeF, have sufficiently low thermal neutron ab-
sorption cross sections, vapor pressures, and melting points to allow their
use as diluents for the UF, and ThF,. However, PbF, and BiF; are unsuit-
able because the cations are readily reduced to the metallic state by
structural metals such as iron and chromium.? The lower thermal neutron
absorption cross section of Li7 as compared with that of sodium allows

the design of reactors which have a smaller holdup of fissile material

6

and superior breeding performance.

Fluid salt mixtures containing high concentrations of ZrF, are not

“regarded as attractive reactor fluids because of significant Vapor pres-

sure of ZrF, above 500°C. 1In a reactor system sublimation of ZrF, fol-

lowed by deposition as a solid limits the temperatures at which long op~
erating times are permissible. Comparable limitations do not occur in

mixtﬁres containing BeF, rather than ZrF,.7 Molten salt reactor systems
which are designed to operate at sufficiently high temperatures that al-
kali fluoride—ZrF, solvents containing 3040 mole % ZrF, can be employed
may offer advantages in the future, but present preference must be giVen

to BeF, on the basis of sublimation.® Consequently, mixtures containing

" 1i7F, BeF,, UF,, and ThF, which have liquidus values several hundred de-
*  grees below the ThF, and UF, melting points are the most promising core

! materials for a fused salt thermal breeder/converter reactor. A knowl-

edge of the liquidus values of such mixtures is necessary since as reac-
tor fluids they must remain wholly in the liquid state during reactor op-
eration. ILiquidus data alone are insufficient because mixtures ofnsolids

and ligquids will be formed during some fuel handling operations. A'khowi-

edge of the nature of the melting-freezing process, of the uraniﬁm-thorium‘ﬂ;

solids formed on cooling of molten mixtures is also necessary. Thus, the
Phase equilibrium relationships for the quaternary system must be under-
stood, especially near liquidus temperatures and at compositions which
may afford attractive core or blanket materials. Before the determina-
tions of the phase relationships cen be made in a quaternary system, the
14 limiting unary, binary, and ternary systems must be understood. All
these limiting systems for the quaternary system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, have

been reported and are described in detail in the body of this report along

¢ with the available data on the quaternary system itself. It is remarkable

g that these studies have not disclosed the existence of termary or of

quaternary compounds.

The majority of the information included in this report was derived

' in the High Temperature Phase Equilibrium Group of the Reactor Chemistry

Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Some of the-preliminary
studies of the phase equilibria in the limiting binary and ternary Sy S~

tems were begun as early as 1951.

has been made of the much more effective method of gquenching equilibrium
samples and identifying the phases by examination with a pdlarizing'light
micfoséope and by'x-ray diffraction technigues. ' |
| A ﬁhermal gradient furnace with a single moving thermocoupléllhis

used for equilibration in the temperature range 650-1200°C. Fiﬁerbthef
thérmal gradient furnaces, operating at a maximum temperature of 200°¢C,
inédrporate 18 thermocouples each. The independent readings from these
are used to determine a temperature calibration curve of the thermal gra-
dient within the annealing area of the furnace. Malfunction of a single
thermocouple becomes readily apparent. In quenching studies made at tem-
péfatures velow 900°C, sample tubes are distributed among the five fur-

ﬁaces_randomly, to achieve maximum reproducibility among ihdepéndent tem~

rperaturé readings. The region of temperature overlap, 650-900°C, is used

to monitor the single high-temperature furnace. In the absence of super-
cooling effects, the completely separate measurements in the thermal anal-
ysis furnaces agree within 5°C with those from the thermal gradient fur-
naces. This interlocking system, by which multiple thermocouples within
five of the furnaces and three types of furnaces are used, provides a
conﬁinuous check on the proper function of the eguipment.

The accuracy of the temperature measurements is limited by the char-
acteristics of the Chromel-Alumel thermocouples used.t* The invariant
point temperature data are so precise that a standard deviation of 1 or

2° is obtained.

2.2 Materials

The LiF used for this work was reagent grade obtained from Foote

~ Mineral Company and from Maywood Chemical Works. The UF, was a product

of Mellinckrodt Chemical Works. The ThF, was obtained from Iowa State
College and from National Lead Company. The BeF, was a product ofLBrush
Beryllium Company. No impurities were found in any of these matériéls )
by x-ray diffraction or microscopic analysis. Spectroscopic ahalySis in-

dicates less than 0.25 wt % impurities.

" Because thorium™- and uranium fluorides are easily converted to ox-

‘ides or oxyfluorides at elevated temperatures it was necessary to remove

small amounts of water and 0xygen as completely as possible from the

sterting materials. In a few cases the molten mixtures were treated with
anhydrous HF. For the vast majority of preparations, however, NH,F:-HF
was . added to the mixture before melting. As such mixtures are heated

the waterkevaporates from the system. Trace gquantities of oxide impuri-
ties are converted to products which have not yet been identified but
"16,17 yUpon further heat-
ing the ammonium "fluometallates" and the excess NH,F+HF decompose. The
products are metal fluorides and phe gases NHs and HF. These gases are
quantltatlvely swept from the system by dry helium. The samples were
melted and cooled to obtain thermal analysis data. The purified solids

were transferred to an argon-filled dry box which contained Ba0 as a des-

“iccant. They were ground to pass a 100-mesh screen and used in the

guenching experiments. The heating cycles were conducted in closed cap—

sules or under an atmosphere of dry helium or argon.

A Spec1al character can be ass1gned to the behavior of combinations

of the four compounds L1F Bng, ThF4, and UF4, for in this grouping are

to be found a pair of metal cations in the lowest and a pair in the high-
est atomic number range. It might, therefore, be expected that the di-

verse physical and chemical properties of these four components would

.. contribute 0 the occurrence of phase behav1or in which a W1de varlety '

The structure of BeF, is analogous to that of Si0,, as was predicted by
Goldschmidt319 all known modifications crystallize as Si0O,-type struc-
tures. Being similar to $Si0,, BeF, readily forms a glass upen cboling
from the liquid state. For this reason, establishing solid-state equi-
libria with BeFp, in which devitrification of this glass must be accom~
plished, is often a very slow process. | | |

equilibrium phase behavior of a
ternary system involving solid
solutions can be clearly and un-
anbiguously described only by an
extensive series of isothermal
sections, fractionation paths in
the primary phase areas, and tie
lines in the subsolidus regions.
Four isothermal sections which il-
lustrate the invariant and the
subsolidus phenomena are shown in
Figs. 23-26. The fractionation
paths for the primary phase areas
of the solutions may be found in
Fig. 27. Tie lines for three of
the subsolidus two-phase regions
are shown in Fig. 28.

of the three ternary invariant

points are listed in Table 10. The compatibility triangles associated

with these invariant points are shown in Fig. 29 and Table 10.

3.11 The System LiF- Bng—UF4—ThF4 (Selected Portions)

Detalled phase equlllbrlum studles ‘for an entire quaternary system
require such a vast amount of tlms and.money that they are usually com-
pleted over a number of years if at all. The system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,
18 no éxdeption in this respect, and consequently the experimental work

Was-diréstéd tbﬁsrd‘cdmpositisns”ﬁﬁisﬁ posses sufficiently low liquidus

and v1scos1ty values to be of prOJect interest.

'mllarltles between ths systems Bng-ThF4 and Bng-UF4, the
i ;ThF4 and LlF UF4;'and the systems L1F~BeF2—ThF4 and LlF Bng-

 

 

;*‘stqﬁFg‘ ave:béen dlscussed 1n Secs 3 2 3 5, and 3.8 of thls report. Wlthln
the systems UF4-ThF4 and LlF UF4—ThF4 extensive solid solutions are formed

between corresponding compounds. The existence of these similar systems

and of solid solutions between analogous compounds leads to the hypothesis

40

that UF, and ThF, are very nearly interchangeable in the quaternary mix-

tures with respect to their liquidus values and that the phase relation-

 

ships in the quaternary system'will be very much like those in the ternary
éystems IiF-BeF,~ThF, and LiF-BeF,-UF,. Four sections of constant mole
per cent IiF and BeF, were studied experimentally as a means of partially .
 verifying this hypothesis. These sections contain 70 LiF and 10 BeF,, | | ;
67.5 IiF and 17.5 BeF,, 70 LiF and 6 BeF,, and 65 IiF and 25 BeF, (mole b
| %). The first two sections include the compositions C-136 and BelLT-15
(see Appendix C). The experimental results of these experiments may be

found in Table 11. The ligquidus leues along the first three Jjoins are

 

nearly linear functions of the composition (Figs. 30-32). The deviation
from linearity in the fourth join (Fig. 33) is in the direction of lower

liquidus temperatures. The ThF,-containing end member has the maximum | - :

 

 

liQuidns ﬁemperature for all the joiﬁs, while the UF,-containing end
member has the minimum liquidus temperature for three of the four joins.
The solid solution 71iF-6(U,Th)F, is the primary phase for all the com-
positions on the joins listed above. The interchangeability of UF, and
Th¥, implies that a breeder blanket selected from the quaternary system
Oor its limiting systems will contain the maximum concentration of ThE,
for a given temperature only 1f no UF, is present. In other words, if
UF, is added an approximately equal amount of ThF, must be removed to
maintain the same liquidus temperature. |
Mixtures containing a maximum amount of Th¥, for a given temperature
are found in the system LiF-BeF,-ThF, (Figs. 9-11) up to 568°C. Above
568° the mixtures must contain no BeF,; thus they will be binary mixtures
of LiF and ThF,. | |
| Thé members of a second series contain a small total mole percentage
of UF, and ThF, (Table 11). They represent the breeder fuels, such as
C-134, BULT 4-0.5U, and BULT 4-1U. Compositions containing up to 5 mgiéi
% UF4 + ThE', in the range 30-38 mole % BeF, have iiquidus values cloéé to
those of the system LiF-BeF,. These compositiOns differ from the LiF- -
ﬁ;rBng‘binary mixtures in that their liquidus values are slightly Lower

and solid solutions containing UF, and ThF, precipitate as primary or

bOnly phases found in major quantity are given. Minor quantities of other phases resulting from
lack of complete reaction between solids or from trace amounts of oxide impurities are not noted.
Glasses or poorly formed crystals assumed to have been produced during rapid cooling of liquid were
found in those samples for which the cbserved phase is indicated as "liquid."
