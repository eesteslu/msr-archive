ABSTRACT

The phase equilibrium relationships for the systems limiting the
quaternary system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, are described in detail along with
available information on the quaternary system itself. The implications
of the extensive solid solutions in the limiting systems are discussed
and experimental information supporting the conclusions is presented. U
The optical properties, crystallographic properties, and x-ray diffrac-
tion patterns for the phases occurring in these systems are tabulated.
Specific compositions of project interest to which references have been
made in the ORNL literature are given special attention. Reference is
made to literature reporting properties of these materials.other than

those discussed in this report.

~ 1. INTRODUCTION

Fluoride fused salts have attracted general interest for use in high-
tempefature reactors because: (1) fluorine has a very low thermal neutron
absorption cross section,® (2) fluorides have low vapor pressures at tem-
peratures and compositions of i.n.terest,2 (3) molten fluorides are very

resistant to damage by nuclear emissions,
corrosion probleme between many fluorides and nickel-based structural ma-
terial.? Specifically, uranium tetrafluoride, a fissile material, is of
interest because it is the only nongaseous fluoride of uranium which does
not incur serious metal container corrosion and/or fuel inhomogeneity as

BiF3, Li’F, NaF, ZrF,, and BeF, have sufficiently low thermal neutron ab-
sorption cross sections, vapor pressures, and melting points to allow their
use as diluents for the UF, and ThF,. However, PbF, and BiF3; are unsuit-
able because the cations are readily reduced to the metallic'state by

absorption cross section of Ii”7 as compared with that of sodium allows
the design of reactors which have a smaller holdup of fissile material
and superior breeding performance.6

Fluid salt mixtures containing high concentrations of ZrF, are not
regarded as attractive reactor fluids because of significant vapor pres-
sure of ZrF, above 500°C. In a reactor system sublimation of Zng fol-
lowed by deposition as a solid limits the temperatures at which long op-
erating times are permissible. Comparable limitations do not occur in
mixtures containing BeFé rather than ZrF4.7 Molten salt reactor systems
which are designed to operate at sufficiently high temperatures that al-
kali fluoride—ZrF, solvents containing 30-40 mole % ZrF, can be employed
may offer advantages in the futuré, but present preference must be given
to BeF, on the basis of sublimation.® Consequently, mixtures containing
Li’F, BeF,, UF,, and ThF, which have liquidus values severallhundred de-
greesibelow the ThF, and UF,; melting points are the mdst promising éore
materials for a fused salt thermél breeder/converter reactor. A knowl-
edge of the liquidus values of such mixtures is necessary since as reac-
tor fluids ﬁhey must remain wholly in the liquid state during reactor op-
eration. Liquidus data alone are insufficient because mixtures of solids
and liquids will be formed during some fuel handling operations. A knowl-
edge‘of‘the nature of the'melting-freezing process, of the ufanium-thbrium

solids formed on cooling of molten mixtures is also necessary. Thus, the
phase equilibrium relationships for the quaternary system must be under-
stood, especially near liquidus temperatures and at compositions which
may afford attractive core or blanket materials. Before the determina-
tions of the phase relationships can be made in a quaternary system, the
14 limiting unary, binary, and ternary systems must be understood. All
these limiting systems for the quaternary system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, have
been reported and are described in detail in the body of this report along
with the available data on the quaternary system itself. It is remarkable
that these studies have not disclosed the existence of ternary or -of
quaternary compounds.

The majority of the informdtion included in this report was derived
in the High Temperature Phase Equilibrium Group of the Reactor Chemistry
Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Some of the preliminary
studies of the phase equilibria in the limiting binary and ternary sys-

tems were begun as early as 1951.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1 Techniques and Apparatus

The experimental techniques and apparatus used in the studies of
LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, phase equiiibria have been described in detaill else-
where.®"13 1In general, the data were obtained by thermal analysis of
slowly cooled melts and by quenching mixtures which had been equilibrated
at known temperatures. Commonly, fused-salt diagrams are based entirely
on information from cooling curves (temperature of the sample plotted as
a function of time). Changes in the slope of the cooling curve reflect
phase changes which occur on cooling, but.are prone to give misleading
or irrelevant indications because of the impossibility of maintaining

equilibrium during the cooling process. Consequently, predominant use

to monitor the single highﬁtemperéture furnace. 1In the absence of super-
cooling effects, the completely separate measurements in.the thermal.anal- .-

Because thorium!® and uranium fluorides are easily converted to ox-
ides or oxyfluorides at elevated temperatures it was necessary to remove
small amounts of water and oxygen as completely as possible from the
starting materials. In a few cases the molten mixtures were treated with
anhydrous HF. For the vast majority of preparations, however, NH,F-HF
was added to the mixture before melting. As such mixtures are heated

the watcer evaporates from the system. 'I'race quantities of oxide impuri-
ties are converted to products which have not yet been identified but

ing the ammonium "fluometallates" and the excess NH,F-HF decompose. The
products are metal fluorides and the gases NH3 and HF. These gases are
quantitatively swept from the system by dry helium. The samples were
melted and cooled to obtain thermal analysis data. The purified solids
were transferred to an argon-filled dry box which contained BaO as a des-

iccant. They wcre groﬁnd to pass a 100-mesh screen and used in the S

quenching experiments. The heating cycles were conducted in closed cap- TG

sules or under an atmosphere of dry helium or argon.

A special character can be assigned to the behavior of combinations
of the four compounds LiF, BeF,;, ThF,, and UF,, for in this grouping are
to be found a pair of metal cations in the lowest and a pair in the high-
est atomic number range. It might, therefore, be expected that the di-
verse physical and chemical properties of these four components would
contribute to the occurrence of phase behavior in which a wide variety
of phenomena would appear. The melting points of the components are
shown in Table 1.

Of the four components, only BeF, exhibits polymorphic transitions.

Two equilibrium compounds occur .in the system
LiF-BeF,, the incongruently melting compound 2LiF.BeF, and the subsolidus
compound LiF.BeF,. Unsuccessful attempts have been made by the authors
to produce the reported compounds 3LiF.2BeF,28 and LiF-2BeF,2° by devitri-
' fication of LiF-BeF, glass and by solid-state equilibration of mixtures
of BeF, and 2LiF-.BeF,. Because the special purification techniques de-
scribed earlier in this report were not used by other investigators??:28
reports of the existence of 3LiF.2BeF, and LiF.ZBng should be considered
tentative.

The optical properties, crystallographic properties, and x-ray dif-
fraction data for the compounds 2LiF.BeF,; and LiF.BeF, are listed in Ap-
pendixes A and B. The compositibns and temperatures of the two invariant

points and one upper limit of stability may be found in Table 2.

The phase equilibria in the system LiF-BeF,-ThF, (Figs. 9%-15) have
been described in a recent report.20 One aspect of the phase equilibria
in this system which is of significance is the formation of a solid so-
lution in which beryllium replaces both lithium and thorium in the
3LiF-ThF, lattice. The single-phase composition area for this solid so-
lution is limited as indicated in Table 7. This results in the forma-
tion of phases at the solidus whose compositions are not so diverse as

those which would have been formed if the substitutional solid solution

The equilibrium phase behavior which will occur in several selected
LiF-BeF,-ThF, compositions is described in Table 9.

When mixtures of LiF-BeF,-ThF, are cooled slowly from the liquid
state, equilibrium is rarely, if ever, achieved. In compositions C-127,
Cc-133 (or C-1lla), and BeLT-15, solids have been routinely observed in

the cooled melts which are indicative of nonequilibrium cooling.®”:66

3.11 The System LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, (Selected Portions)

Detailed phase equilibrium studies for an entire quaternary system
require such a vast amount of time and money that they aré usually cuuw-
pleted over a number of years if at all. The system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,
is no exception in this respect, and consequently the experimental work
was directed toward compositions which posses sufficiently low liquidus
and viscosity values to be of project interest.

The similarities between the systems BeF,;-ThF, and BeF,-UF,, the
systems LiF-ThF, and LiF-UF,, and the systems LiF-BeF,-''nt, and LiF-BeF,-
UF, have been discussed in Secs 3.2, 3.5, and 3.8 of this report. Within
the systems 1JF,-ThF, and Li¥F-UF,-ThF, extensive solid solutions are formed
between corresponding compounds. The existence of these similar systems

and of solid solutions between analogous compounds leads to the hypothesis
40

that UF, and ThF, are very nearly interchangeable in the quaternary mix-
turestwith respect to their liquidus values and that the phase relation-
ships in the quaférﬁary system will be very much like those in the ternary
systems LiF-BeF,-ThF, and LiF-BeF,-UF,. Four sections of constant mole |
per cent LiF and BeF, were studied experimentally as a means of partially N
verifying this hypothesis. These sections contain 70 LiF and 10 BeF,,
67.5 LiF and 17.5 BeF,, 70 LiF and 6 BeF,, and 65 LiF and 25 BeF, (mole
%). The first two sections include the compositions C-136 and BeLT-15
(see Appendix C). The experimental results of these experiments may be
found in Table 11. The liquidus values along the first three joins are
nearly linear functions of the composition (Figs. 30-32). The deviation
from linearity in the fourth join (Fig. 33) is in the direction of lower
liquidusttemperaturesL The ThF,-containing end member has the maximum
liquidus temperature for all the joins, while the UF,-containing end
member has the minimum liquidus temperature for three of the four joins.
The solid solution 7LiF+6(U,Th)F, is the primary phase for all the com-
positions on the joins listed above. The interchangeability of UF, and
ThF, implies that a breeder blanket selected from the quatérnary.system
or its limiting systems will contain the maximum concentration of ThF,
for a given temperature only if no UF, is present. 1In other'words; if
UF, is added an approximately equal amount of ThF, must be removed to
maintain the same liquidus temperature. '

Mixtures containing a maximum amount of ThF, for a given temperature
are found in the system LiF-BeF,-ThF, (Figs. 9%-11) up to 568°C. Above
568° the mixtures must contain no BeF,; thus they will be binary mixtures
of LiF and ThF,. : - |

The members.of a second series contain a small total mole percentage
of UF, and ThF, (Table 11). They represent the breeder fuels, such as
C-134, BULT 4-0.5U, and BULT 4-1U. Cdmpositions containing up to 5 mole -
% UF, + ThF, in the range 30-38 mole % BeF, have 1iquidus values close to
those. of the system LiF-BeF,. These compositions differ from the LiF- =
‘Bng binary mixtures in that their liquidus values are slightly lower

and solid solutions containing UF,; and ThF, precipitate as primary or

aThe uncertainty indicates the temperature difference between the quenched samples.

bOnly phases -found in major quantity are given.

Minor quantities of other phases resulting from

lack of comp_ete reaction between solids or from trace amouats of oxide impurities are not noted.
Glasses or poorly formed crystals assumed to have been produced during rapid cooling of liquid were
found in those samples for which the observed phase is indicated as "liquid."

metastable phases, and glass. Consequently the phase analysis of slowly

cooled melts cannot be relied upon to yield subsolidus equilibrium data.

Supercooling is also observed and so affects the thermal analysis that
this technique for studying heterogeneous equilibria cannot be used for
the system LiF-UF,-ThF,-BeF,.

It has been suggested that the uranium concentration in a molten
salt reactor might be increased by adding the eutectic mixture of LiF
and UF4.69 Consequently, phase relationships in the quaternary section
between 73 LiF-27 UF, and 64.75 LiF—4.15 ThF,-31.1 BeF, have bheen inves-
tigated. This join contains the fuel mixture 65 LiF-30 BeF,—4 ThF;—1

ing 73 LiF-27 UF, and 64.75 LiF-4.15 ThF,—31.1 BeF,. The results of
thermal gradient quenching experiments may be found in Table 1l. The
