SECTION II REACTORS FUELED WITH HOMOGENEOUS AQUEOUS
SOLUTIONS AND SLURRIES

Chapter 1 Introduction

The use of aqueous solutions and slurries to provide an even dispersion
of fuel atoms among moderator atoms was one of the earliest suggestions for
nuclear reactors.l The concepts in this section follow the early idea and
are thus distinguished by a common characteristic: fuel dissolved or
suspended to form a homogeneous aqueous solution, colloidal dispersion, or
slurry.

These concepts have been investigated by many workers. Especially
valuable as sources of detailed information are reviews by Lane et al.ls?
For engineering details of specific reactors, see the tabulations referred
to in the General Introduction to the catalog.

The title of the section defines generally how concepts have been
chosen for inclusion, but some explanation may clarify why certain related
concepts were excluded.

The term "homogeneous aqueous'" would strictly mean that the core must
be an aqueous solution or suspension throughout, with no solid moderator.

A few concepts in which the fuel solution is in contact with such a
moderator are included here, however, because of their small number and
their close similarity to the other concepts included. 'Aqueous" includes
light water, heavy water, and any water-containing solution or suspension.
Molten salts and liquid-metal solutions or slurries are discussed in
Sections III and IV respectively. Solutions and suspensions are here
defined to jinclude particle sizes from those of true solutions to particles
that can be made into a slurry--up to 500 mu in diameter. Aqueous
suspensions and slurries are included in this section because their
properties and behavior in a reactor resemble those of solutions and
because a well-agitated suspension or slurry is virtually homogeneous.
Fuels for these reactors thus range from pure Newtconian liquids to paste
fuels.

As in other sections, subcritical assemblies, exponential

experiments, test loops, and similar concepts will not be treated in a

separate chapter because they do not strictly fit the definition of reactors.
They will, however, be discussed wherever pertinent., The various critical
experiments that have been part of the development of reactors are examples.

Some reactors that embody concepts that strictly fit the definition of
homogeneous aqueous solutions or suspensions are discussed elsewhere because
they have some other distinctive feature.

Examples are pulsed and excursion reactors. The Russian pulsed reactor
is a high-flux research reactor, with an aqueous solution of enriched
uranium salt as fuel. The Solution Type Pulse Reactor (STPR) of Atomics
International (AI) has highly enriched uranyl sulfate solution for fuel.
Al's Kinetic Experiment Water Boiler (KEWB) is, as the name designates, a
"water boiler,”" but it is also a pulsed reactor that can sustain large power
excursions. All of these reactors will be described in Part III of the
catalog.

The concepts in this section are discussed in the three remaining
chapters:

Chapter 2 Research and Testing Reactors

Chapter 3 Non-Boiling Power and Breeder Reactors

Chapter 4 Boiling Power and Breeder Reactors
Most of the research and testing reactors in Chapter 2 are of the misnamed
"Water Boiler" type--the water does not boil. They were so named because of
the boiling appearance caused by radiolytic gas bubbles. Some others,
however, are included. Chapters 3 and 4 cover reactors designed to yield
power and to breed fuel. They differ in whether or not heat is removed by
boiling in the core.

Obviously, divisions between chapters are not always sharp-—-as between
Chapters 2 and 3. To a large extent the divisions are according to the
purpose of the reactor.

Table I3 lists the most significant homogeneous aqueous reactors with
thelr characteristics and applications. This section generally follows the

pattern used in the table.

Early History

Aqueous solutions of uranium salts were used to investigate atomic
fission not long after the discovery, by Hahn and Strassmann in 1938, that

neutron bombardment could break up the uranium nucleus, and after the

interpretation of the significance of their work by Meitner and Frisch."

Von Halban, Joliot, and Kowarski placed a uranium solution in a large vessel,
in the center of which was a source of neutrons. Around it they placed
devices to detect neutrons and count them as they were formed. When they
substituted for the uranium solution another that was very similar but
contained no uranium, they found that many more neutrons were produced when
the neutron source was placed in the solution of uranium.%,®

This experiment demonstrated that neutron multiplication would take
place in an aqueous solution of uranium salt; it was among the first sub-
critical or exponential reactors. Neutrons from a neutron source were
multiplied, but there was not a self-sustaining or chain reaction because
the neutron source was needed to maintain the reaction as well as to start it.

Von Halban and Kowarski continued their experiments in England using a
homogeneous suspension of uranium oxide in a vessel immersed in about a ton
of heavy mineral oil to serve as a reflector. Although this system was not
large enough to be itself capable of maintaining a chain reaction,
measurements made enabled the experimenters to show that a self-sustaining
system would be possible with between 3 and 6 tons of heavy water; they
also showed that, with enriched uranium, a self-sustaining reaction would
be possible in light water.

In this experiment, a suspension of uranium oxide and heavy water was
contained in a spinning sphere that kept the powder well mixed with the
fluid. It provided clear evidence that in a sufficiently large system a
chain reaction would be possible.’ Because the only feasible homogeneous
reactor using natural uranium would be one moderated with heavy water,
and sufficient amounts of D20 did not become available until 1943 for use
In reactors, early interest in homogeneous aqueous reactor systems was
purely academic. Even after the atomic energy program was well under way,
work was concentrated on heterogeneous reactors.! An important advantage
of heterogeneous reactors Is that fuel can be clad to prevent corrosion,
attrition, and escape of fission products.

Interest in homogeneous reactors was revived early in 1943, when a
supply of heavy water in U. S. and Canada was expected. However, slurry
reactors took precedence over the solution type because enriched uranium
was not then available in sufficient quantity. Furthermore, the only known

soluble salts of uranium of sufficiently low cross section to enable the

design of a reactor of feasible size and heavy water requirement were
uranyl fluoride and uranium hexafluoride. These compounds were considered
but rejected, principally because of hydrolysis of the UF6, corrosion,
meager solubility data, precipitation, and instability under radiation. A
second reason for the choice of a slurry reactor was the evidence that
decomposition of the heavy water would be more severe in a solution than
in a slurry. In the solution, fission fragments would be formed in
intimate contact with the water. They would, however, be formed inside a
solid particle in a slurry.! Finally, a slurry would have a higher fuel
loading than a solution. In spite of the emphasis on heterogeneous and
slurry reactors, however, many concepts for homogeneous aqueous reactors

were considered for research, power, and breeding.

Chapter 2 Research and Testing Reactors

The reactors taken up in this chapter are characterized by their
purpose—-—-to give experimental data, primarily through the nuclear radiation
they produce. They are thus distinguished from those experimental reactors
that are used primarily to obtain data for the design of a power reactor,
Such experimental reactors will be described in connection with the
pertinent power reactors. The USAEC Division of Technical Information has
defined a research reactor as '"any reactor whose nuclear radiations are
used primarily as a research tool for basic or applied research regardless
of operating power level. May include facilities for testing reactor
materials.”! Most of these research reactors are of the "water-boiler"

type, but there are several others.

Zero-Power Reactors

"zero power" deserve to be

A few reactors of extremely low power or
treated separately, rather than with power reactors as the subcritical
assemblies and critical experiments are discussed. They are reactors
useful in their own right rather than as part of the development of another
reactor. Zero-power reactors have been defined by the National Research
Council as experimental nuclear reactors operated at low neutron flux and
at a power level so low that not only is no forced cooling required but

also fission product activity in the fuel is sufficiently low to allow the

fuel to be handled after use without serious hazard.?

NASA Zero-Power Reactor

This reactor was planned for performing critical experiments,
measuring reactivity effects, serving as a neutron source, and being a
training tool. Varying core configurations of solutions of highly
enriched uranyl fluoride in light water would operate at a maximum power
of 10 watts.3 Two versions, NASA ZPR-I and NASA ZPR-II have been listed,
with the second described as an enlarged version of the first.“ The
power levels, however, apparently are the same. In December 1963, both
were being used for critical experiments, with 1959 being given as a
startup date for ZPR-I and 1963 for ZPR-II.! ZPR-I was described as
"eritical experiments for the NASA Test Reactor," ZPR-II as "NASA
Zero-Power Reactor II, solution type critical." Plans were for operating

both in the same building, but with only one reactor operating at a time,
Some of the data obtained from this reactor were used in a computer
program to compute the age of fission neutrons in water.?
The design of this reactor utilized earlier work at Oak Ridge on the

criticality of aqueous solutions of uranium-235 salts.5s7

Highly Enriched Homogeneous Reactor

This reactor,8 described by Brown, et al, of Westinghouse APD, is of
lower power than that of NASA. It contains an extremely dilute aqueous
solution of uranyl nitrate, in which the enrichment is greater than 90 percent.
It is contained in a stainless-steel tanmk, 72 inches high and 36 inches in

diameter.

Proserpine

This French "reactor" is actually a critical facility, but is in the
form of a small water boiler and thus is discussed here. It has been
described in several references.?»10 It is designed to study criticality
problems of plutonium solutions, and it utilizes a fissionable solution of
, in 0.5N H

plutonium sulfate, Pu(SO SO4 in light water. The reflector

4)2 2

is beryllium oxide and graphite.

Water Boilers

A "water boiler" is a small reactor with a core consisting of a
container of fuel solution. It is equipped with controls, reflectors,
heat-transfer system, and other auxiliaries as required. The fuel is a
soluble salt of uranium or plutonium; the moderator-solvent is light or
heavy water.

The core is a stainless-steel sphere, about one foot in diameter,
containing the fuel solution.!! Because a natural uranium light water
solution cannot be made critical, the uranium is enriched in U235. The
fuel solution is cooled by water circulating through coils inside the core.
Normally this cooling keeps the solution temperature below about 80°C and,
because the operating pressure is near atmospheric, no actual boiling
occurs. One water boiler, SUPO, was, however purposely operated under
boiling conditions in a stability study.!2

A fuel-handling system adds fuel solution to the core and recovers
solution expelled by any operation above design power. Hydrogen and

oxygen evolved in operating at relatively high power are catalytically
recombined and the water is returned to the core. The core is surrounded

by a graphite or beryllium oxide neutron reflector with a concrete shield
around the reflector. Control is by neutron-absorber rods usually containing
boron or cadmium, with passages or thimbles for the rods in the core or
reflector. Usually the reactors have experimental facilities, such as
thermal columns and beam tubes.l!!

The water boiler has evolved through many stages, 3-18 and various

types are now marketed by several manufacturers. 19520

The LOPQO Series

This water boiler, or LOPO-HYPO-SUPO concept, is the prototype for all
water-boiler reactors. It was important in World War II in that it
provided vital data for the atomic bomb project.

In all these reactors, power and breeding are not primary objectives.
LOPO originally was built '"to gain experience in the operation and control
of a chain-reacting assembly while using a minimum of active material...
Its main job was the mass production of neutrons..."?l

The "water boiler" at Los Alamos was planned in 1943 to test certain
theoretical calculations!3 when an enriched uranium supply seemed possible.
R. F. Christy was responsible for the critical-design calculations for this
reactor.1*»15,22 Christy's reactor design consisted of a noncorrosive
stainless-steel shell, one foot in diameter, containing enriched uranium
or plutonium as a water solution of a suitable salt, such as uranyl sulfate
or nitrate, with a neutron reflector of beryllium oxide bricks occupying
a cube of about four feet on an edge. The fuel solution circulated by
convection, and about 10 kw(t) was extracted by a coiled tube carrying
cold water through the inside of the reactor. Control was exercised through
a vertically moving control rod.

Preliminary plans and calculations for such an operation were completed
by September 1943, and a critical experiment, LOPO-CX, was carried out in
1943-44, Ten kilowatts was arbitrarily chosen as the operating level. It
appeared, however, more advisable to construct first a reactor of much lower
power, known as the Low Power Water Boiler (LOPO), because it eliminated
heavy shielding requirements and minimized the problems of uranium compounds
going out of solution, gas evolving from decomposition of the water by
fission fragments, and fission fragments contaminating the solution. The

plans for LOPO were completed in November 1943, assembly proceeded through
the spring of 1944, and the assembly went critical in 1944.13,2!

LOPO was one of the first aqueous-solution reactors using enriched fuel.
It used 14.5 percent enriched uranium (565 grams of uranium-235 as uranyl
sulfate) dissolved in ordinary water. The solution was contained in a
Type-347 stainless-steel sphere one foot in diameter, with a beryllium oxide
reflector and a cadmium control rod. The lack of a shield and cooling system
limited the heat power level of LOPO to 50 milliwatts.

LOPO was later modified to become the High Power Water Boiler (HYPO),
which went critical in December 1944, It operated at a peak power of about
6 kw. Major modifications included the addition of a shield and an internal
cooling system consisting of a single coil, which carried cooling water
through the core. Additional experimental holes were added, the uranyl
sulfate fuel solution was replaced by uranyl nitrate because an extraction
method to remove fission products was known only for the nitrate solution
at that time, and the control system was made more elaborate.21,23,2"4

Because higher neutron fluxes and more research facilitles than were
avallable from HYPO were desired, the reactor was further modified
starting in April 1949. Completed in March 1951, it became SUPO, the Super
Power Water Boiler. Major changes included an increase in operating power
level from 5.5 kw to a minimum of 45 kw by replacing the cooling coil by
three stainless-steel tubes, replacing the beryllium portion of the
reflector by graphite, changing the reactor solution from 15 percent
enriched uranyl nitrate to one of 88.7 percent enrichment, and adding new

experimental holes and vertical control rods.?3,25,26,27

Atomics International Reactors

Atomics International's 5-watt Water Boiler Neutron Source (WBNS) was
built and first operated at Downey, California; it went critical in 1952.
It was later converted to a 2.5-kw reactor, AE-6. The AE-6 was used as a
source of thermal neutrons to study nuclear behavior of heterogeneous
subcritical assemblies and the irradiate small samples in neutron fluxes
up to 1011 ne.utrons?./c:m?'/sec:.28"33

The fuel solution was contained in a one-foot diameter stainless-steel
sphere, initially with np cooling system (as in LOPO) because of the very
low power level, 1 to 2 watts, but cooling coils were provided in case of

higher-power operation. They were used in the later 2-kw operation. In the

loading sequence of the special fuel system, the total amount of distilled

10
water was added to the core tank, then the first aliquot of fuel (one-half
of critical mass). Next, gas was bubbled through the solution to mix the
. fuel and distilled water, and a part of the resulting solution was raised
into a mixing tank. The next measured aliquot of fuel was added and the
process repeated. The fission gases were disposed of by a special gas-
disposal systeﬁ with accumulator, gages, and valving. A graphite
reflector two feet thick, control rods, and a concrete shield were used.
Other Atomics International reactors similar to AE-6 include the
Livermore Water Boiler Neutron Source,3“»35 starting in 1953; the
University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Reactor and the
Armour Research Reactor, which went critical in 1956; the Danish Reactor-l
and the Japan Research Reactor of 1958, the Italian CESNEF Reactor of 1959; the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center Homogeneous Reactor, Washington D.C., which went
critical in 1961; and the Los Alamos Medical Reactor, which was scheduled
for construction starting in 1958 but apparently never went critical,1©s,36,37
The Armour Research Reactorl®232 was the first operating industrial
reactor in the U.S. It was operated by Illinois Institute of Technology in
Chicago and financed by 24 industrial users. It went critical on June 24,
1956. The reactor operated until 1958 at 10 kw power, an interim power
limit "pending the results of kinetic experiments ... carried out on an
identical machine by Atomics International for the AEC.3® The design for
the NAA Medical Reactor3? was similar to that of the Armour Research
Reactor, as were those of the AL Models L-54 and L-55.1°
Other reactors resulted from another Atomics International water
boiler type, the "Laboratory Reactor," beginning with the L-47 prototype,!®
a predecessor to the L-77. Reactors of this type are the University of
Wyoming Research Reactor and the Puerto Rico Reactor at the Puerto Rico
Nuclear Center, both of which went critical in 1959.
These L-77-type reactors are stainless-steel spherical vessels
containing a critical mass of 20 percent enriched uranyl sulfate fuel and
are controlled by cadmium-lead rods working through vertical thimble
tubes; lead is used as a reflector.16532,38,40 Flora comments that the
"Los Alamos 'Water Boiler' was chosen as a starting point since this
type of research reactor has more years of successful operating history
il

to its credit than any other type of research reactors.,

. The unit was so designed that the factory '"package" could be shipped

11
and assembled without difficulty and could be used in existing facilities
and without special staff. One L~-77, known as the DEMAG Reactor, was
operated at the Second Geneva Conference in 1958 as part of the commercial
exhibit., Another 1L-77 was included in the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission's
exhibit at Beirut, Lebanon, in its Atoms for Peace Program.l+2
Various modifications of this reactor were made, such as the 5-Watt

Laboratory Reactor“l»%3 or the Small 5-Watt Laboratory Reactor.*!

Other Water Boilers

Water-boiler research reactors, in addition to those of Atomics
International, include those designed at universities and miscellaneous
types. North Carolina State College at Raleigh was the first university
to design (R. L. Murray), build, and operate a reactor.“*" A water boiler
was chosen because details of this type were the first to be released by
the AEC, The North Carolina State College Reactor (NCSR or NCSCR), also
known as the Raleigh Research Reactor (RRR-1), went critical in 1953.32,%43
NCSCR-1,32 NCSCR-2,32 and NCSCR-4“46 were all the water boiler type; the
NCSCR-3, however, was a 10~kw pool type completed in March 1960. NCSCR-4
still is in use at North Carolina State, and a similar type is in use
at the University of Wyoming."7»>*8 The NCSCR reactors are substantially
the same as the original LOPO-HYPO-SUPO, except that a cylindrical core
is used instead of a sphere. The Utah Water Boiler reactor3? is a reactor
designed at the University of Utah and described by Borst and Mong, #9550
It is intended for a university wishing to operate with the utmost
simplicity and safety. More information on university reactors is given
in the records of the University Reactor Conferences.*’

Two French homogeneous aqueous reactors for special-purpose testing
have recently been reported.®! Few details are given. Alecto I and
Alecto II, at Saclay, France, operate at a few watts, with a maximum
thermal flux of 108 neutrons/cmzlsec. Alecto I, which became critical
in 1961, uses uranium nitrate solution in light water. Alecto II,
which became critical in 1962-63, uses a solution of plutonium nitrate,
also in light water. Both were designed, built, owned, and operated
by CEA (Centre d'Etudes Nucléaires de Saclay).

Miscellaneous water boilers on which there is little information are

the Chinese Homogeneous Research Reactor at Tientsin,>?:°3 and that of

the Gamma Corp., Mansfield, Massachusetts.5%

12
A modified form of the water boiler is the Test Tube Reactor developed
at Los Alamos.’® This reactor, so-called because of its cylindrical shape,
is related to the LAPRE-1 (Los Alamos Power Reactor Experiment Number 1)
which has also been called a '"test—-tube reactor.'" The fuel solution,
highly enriched uranyl sulfate or phosphate in light water, moves by
convection up a hot central tube and returns through the surrounding
annulus, which contains coolant coils. This reactor has a power rating
of 100 kw.

Babcock and Wilcox also designed a similar modified water boiler for
nuclear and engineering research.’® The design power was 50 kw, with
enough heat-transfer surface in the core to make higher power possible.

The solution-~20 liters of uranyl sulfate in light water--is in a

cylindrical container with a hemispherical bottom.

Irradiation and Testing Reactors

In addition to water boilers, other aqueous solution reactors have
been designed for diverse irradiation and testing purposes. Some are
operated at higher power than water boilers, and two are not strictly
homogeneous, in that they contain solid moderators.

Several aqueous—solution reactors were conceived as neutron
producers. An exploratory study of reactors for gamma irradiation in
food sterilization®’ indicated that homogeneous reactors have no advantage
over other types as irradiation sources for food sterilization if they
are used only for this purpose. If, however, they can be used both for
irradiation and power production, they have several economic advantages,
A meat-irradiation facility has been tentatively suggested in another

uranyl sulfate and copper sulfate in light or heavy water. It resembles
the Homogeneous Reactor Test. (See Chapter 3.)

The Homogeneous Research Reactor, also known as the Aqueous Homogeneous
Research Reactor, is a single-region reactor with 8 percent enriched uranyl
sulfate solution in heavy water as fuel-moderator-coolant. It was
Intended to operate at 500 Mw(t) or 125 Mw(e) and to produce a thermal

53,60 Tt was concluded that the design

flux of 5 x 10%° neutrons/cmz/sec.
could proceed on the basis of the assumed parameters. Successful operation
was eXpected, with no technological breakthroughs required but with many

attendant problems.61

13

A later study at Aeronutronic Systems, Inc., considered both
heterogeneous and homogeneous reactors for a flux of 2 x IO]'5 neutrons/cmz/
sec. A homogeneous Advanced Engineering Test Reactor (AETR) based very
largely on the design of the HRE, HRT, and the Homogeneous Research Reactor
was selected as preferable.®2 Removal of fission products and addition of
fuel would be continuous. To maintain the total contained excess reactivity
at a constant level, the solution, with 10 percent uranium-235, would be
contained in a stainless-steel sphere 8 feet in diameter.

A reactor suggested for high-flux irradiation in chemical processing
employs a subcritical zone for exterior circulation of fuel.®3 A
homogeneous aqueous solution of uranium phosphate is one form of fuel
specified. The fuel flows from the reactor to a cooling zone, and then
back to the reactor. The passages into and out of the reactor contain
neutron-absorbing material, like boron, to keep the material subcritical
outside of the reaction zone. This arrangement permits very high fluxes—-
above 1013 neutrons/cmZ/sec--and high heat generation--more than 20 Mw
per pound of fissile material. Several variants are described, with such other
fuels as gases, liquid metals, molten salts, or fluidized solids.

A high~-flux homogeneous reactor described by Hibshman utilizes
enriched uranyl sulfate in light water to give a power of 28 Mw.%" The
fuel is fed to the core and withdrawn through many inlet and outlet tubes.

Two reactors with aqueous solutions and solid moderators have been
suggested.

The ASTRA (Advanced Scientific Techniques Research Associates)

Advanced Engineering Test Reactor also used ideas from the Oak Ridge
Homogeneous Reactor Project. It, however, has a structural core. This
reactor contains highly enriched uranyl sulfate in heavy water solution,

and a moderator-reflector of graphite blocks.®>

The High Flux Research Reactor for Large-Volume Irradiations is an
engineering test reactor with a fuel-coolant sclution of uranyl sulfate
in light water. The solution is circulated through the graphite moderator

in parallel tubes. The reactor is designed to produce 120 M. 66

Evaluation and Status

As the water boiler is the most common research reactor, its future

possibilities have received the most attention. Breazeale®’ has compared

14

water-boiler and the swimming-pool reactors—-the two designs suitable for a
low-power research reactor. The water boiler, using a light-water

solution of uranyl sulfate and surrounded on all sides by a good reflector
like carbon or beryllium, will have a critical mass of less than 1 kg of
uranium-235. The swimming-pool type with 1l-kg critical mass would be
inflexible and, because of its small heat-transfer surface, could be operated
only at low power. But at 2-kg critical mass, the swimming-pool type has
greater power capability and flexibility than the water boiler of 1 kg.
Presumably, 2 kg enriched uranium is available for this extra flexibility;
moreover, it is easier to use a water shield with the swimming-pool reactor
than with the water boiler, which needs a shielded tube to carry off the
radiocactive gases.

Lane®® has pointed out that water boilers have limited use as research
reactors, although a few years ago they seemed to be promising competitors
to the swimming-pool and tank-type reactors. Some of the difficulties are:

a. The use of water as a fuel-bearing medium limits operating

temperature and neutron flux.

b. Severe corrosion, both from circulating solutions and radiation,

can damage equipment, resulting in such conditions as loss of
radioactive solution from a reactor tank. Such leakage
occurred in the Raleigh Research Reactor.

c. Unsafe conditions may result from excessive reactivity changes.

d. Hazards arise from the explosive hydrogen-oxygen mixture produced

by radiolytic decomposition of water.

e. Highly trained technical workers, especially chemists, are required.
Water boilers and similar solution reactors have many of the advantages and
disadvantages discussed by Lane in a recent work on aqueous reactors.®®

Solution reactors have generally fallen out of favor for research uses,
with few new ones being built. However, the water-boiler reactor at Walter
Reed Hospital went critical as late as 1961 and was in operation by the fall
of 1962.70s71 Also, in early 1963, the AEC announced that it planned to
issue a permit to the University of Nevada for construction of an Atomics

International Model L-=77 reactor.72

Circulation Zone

Reference: Canadian Patent 614,567 (British No. 834,371).

Originators: F. T. Barr and J. F. Black.

Status: Patent granted, Feb. 14, 1961,

Details: Thermal (could be intermediate), steady state, burner. Fuel-
coolant-moderator: 907 enriched U235 as uranium phosphate in HZO'
Horizontal core is surrounded by a graphite reflector, which may or may
not be ccoled. The solution is circulated through a flow path, through

a reaction zone, and on to a cooling zone. Inlet temperature: 350°F;
outlet: 650°F. So tﬁat the critical condition is not maintained through-
out the conduit, sufficient neutron-absorbing material (Li, Cd, or B) is
disposed circumferentially in the conduit leading into and out of the
reaction zone to establish a subcritical exterior circulation zone. This
neutron absorber may be horizontal rods or plates, clad with Al or stain-
less steel and located within the flowing solution. Reaction zone is
5-15 inches inside the closest absorbent. System pressure: 2000 psi;
flow rate: 400 gal/sec. Control: 3 rods of Cd, B, or Li, moving

vértically. This design is suitable for high-flux irradiation processing.

processing is another variation. Solid UO2 particles, 75-200 y, are
conveyed by a gaseous coolant-moderator--hydrogen (or DZO vapor). The
fluid UOZ_HZ is circulated similarly to the first design, but solids
are separated in a cyclone and are later repressurized before they are
returned to the system. Neutron-absorbing material at both ends of the
reaction zone is B or Cd. The system is primarily for conversion, but
can be adapted for breeding. UF6 with solid particles of carbon suspended
in it as moderator can also be used.

Aqueous Homogeneous Design

Reference: Canadian Patent 613,636.

Originator: H. J. Hibshman.

Status: Patent issued, Jan. 31, 1961.

Details: Several embodiments of the invention are described in the patent,
which is aimed chiefly at methods by which to obtain higher neutron fluxes
from homogeneous reactors by feeding fuel to and withdrawing it from the
core through a plurality of inlet and outlet fuel streams.

Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner. Circulating fuel-moderator-
coolant: solution of 93% enriched U02804 (could be nitrate) in HZO'

Inlet temperature at the bottom of the core: 300°F; outlet at the top:
400°F. Operating pressure: 1000 psig. The core has 4 conduits which
converge to form a quartered sphere, 1 ft in diameter. Shape may be
cylindrical or rectangular. Each of the conduits, constructed of carbon
steel, is circular (6 in. diameter) shaped outside the core and is
altered to form one of the quarters inside the core. An alternate design
describes cooling means for the conduits. Velocity of fuel: 6 ft/sec.
Each conduit is provided with external heat exchanger. Reflector: Be and
if desired, graphite. Control: negative temperature coefficient and fine
or coarse Cd or B steel safety rods. Power: 28 Mw.

Two alternate arrangements are described. In the first, a plurality
of pipes containing the fuel mixture converge in one critical zone and
diverge outside of this zone. The fuel is fed in continuously through the
3 pipes and is passed on to the heat exchangers. The area of criticality
may be defined by a solid moderator and control elements, to which
structure this alternate arrangement is particularly applicable; or a
liquid moderator (HZO’ D2

pipe circuits, similar to those for fuel, through the critical zone,

0, or hydrocarbons) may be circulated within

each circuit with cooling means.

A second arrangement comprises a fixed source of fuel within which a
plurality of pipes pass liquid fuel continuously through the zone, to heat
exchangers, and back to the core. The coolant (HZO’ D20, or hydrocarbons),
which may also be the moderator, passes through the fixed fuel in pipe
circuits. The coolant is also recirculated. Core material is stainless

steel, and D,0 may be used with or in place of reflector materials listed

Status: Submitted in response to AEC request for recommendations of a
concept for an AETR, March 1, 1957.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel: hot, pressurized,
acid solution of uranyl sulfate in D20, highly enriched in U235. Moderator-
reflector: 4 in. graphite blocks (sticks) with slots cut on each of the

openings between sticks are passages for the air cooclant. The blocks are
arranged in an octagonal shape, (7 ft high and 8 ft in diameter) supported
on a steel plate, all of which is surrounded by a cylindrical vessel
containing flowing demineralized water. It approximates a right circular
cylinder with a vertical axis of graphite. Twenty-four Zircaloy-2 vertical
fuel tubes, 5 in, diameter, are inserted into graphite structure from the
bottom. Fuel flows upward in the fuel tubes and downward through a
concentric flow separator in the center through gas separators to steam
generators, and then back to the core, pumped by canned rotor pumps. Inlet
temperature: 428°F; outlet: 479 to 503°F, Pressure: 1200 psia.
Reflectors: top and side reflectors, 2 ft thick. Internal neutron shield
of borated graphite is located just below the core. Control: negative
temperature coefficient. Nine vertical through-holes for testing reactor
fuel elements and assemblies at high temperatures and high thermal neutron
fluxes. Power: 220 Mw(t).

Status: Conceptual design, June 3, 1955,
Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel-moderator-coolant:
fully enriched solution of uranyl sulfate in HZO’ 30 grams per liter,
There is also a graphite moderator, which is fabricated in 4 in. x 4 in.
blocks. Reflector: 20-in.-thick borated graphite. Solution enters
core vessel at 100°F and a velocity of 25 ft/sec and circulates through
the graphite moderator in 24 parallel zirconium tubes. It leaves at an
average temperature of 145°C to external heat exchangers. Because a
conventional tube header would become critical, four manifolds at either
end of the reactor and four separate heat exchangers are used. Core
vessel: right-circular cylinder, 8 ft x 8 ft, enclosed in a concrete
shield. Experimental facilities: fifteen removable graphite
stringers——one of which permits irradiation of samples up to 16 in. x
16 in.--and up to forty-eight 4 in. x 4 in. beam tubes. Control:
through the negative temperature coefficient, alteration of fuel
concentration, and four vertical control rods. Design power: 120 Mw,

Chapter 3 Non-Boiling Reactors for Power and Breeding

The reactor concepts in this chapter include those in which a
homogeneous aqueous solution or slurry (suspension) is utilized as fuel.
These fuels were among the first to be suggested, but reactors employing
them have not been developed beyond the prototype stage. An excellent
description of aqueous solution and slurry reactors is given by Lane,
MacPherson, and Maslan.! Also valuable are reviews by Briggs and
Swartout? and by Brown and Morris.S3

These reactors can be classified in many ways-—--purpose, method of
heat removal, origin, materials used, etc. Table I (Chapter 1) 1lists the
different types and their applications.“ A useful classification is by
fuel utilization--burners, converters, or breeders. Breeders are either
one-region--consisting of a homogeneous solution or slurry; or two-region--
a core plus a blanket of fertile material. In the course of the Homo-
geneous Reactor Experiment series, the Homogeneous Reactor Project, and
the Los Alamos Power Reactor Experiments, groups of closely related
concepts were developed. Thus, they are discussed together, rather than
under their respective classifications. Other homogeneous aqueous
solution reactors are then grouped as burners, converters, or breeders.
The closely related concepts of non-homogeneous aqueous reactors and
colloidal fuels are briefly discussed, as there is little in the
literature concerning them. Slurry-fueled reactors are treated separately
in this chapter because of their special features. For boiling homo-

geneous aqueous reactors, see Chapter 4.

Early History

It is hard to determine who proposed the first homogeneous aqueous
reactor for power and breeding. Early in the Manhattan Project, aqueous
homogeneous solutions and slurries were considered as fuels for producing
plutonium but, as with research reactors, the need for enriched fuel and
large quantities of heavy water made heterogeneous reactors preferable
at the time. When enough of heavy water and enriched fuel became available,
aqueous solutions and slurries were studied for breeding and power
production. A group of chemists at the Clinton Laboratories, now the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, were active in planning homogeneous reactors

for research and breeding. In 1944, Nordheim reported on the potentialities

49
of a breeder reactor.® In an extensive experimental program, research
workers studied the choice of fuel, moderator, and cooling mechanism;
problems of corrosion, poisoning, and formation of radiolytic gases; and
most of the other aspects of reactor development.

Investigative work continued through 1945. At that time, such
difficulties as bubble formation, corrosion, solution instability, and
external holdup of fissionable material led to the decision to consider
heterogeneous reactors instead.® The early homogeneous aqueous reactor
designs are discussed under their respective classifications, and details
are given on the data sheets. Many of them utilized a heavy water solution
of sodium uranyl carbonate or uranyl sulfate as fuel. Thorium metal or
oxide was a common fertile material. They were cooled by circulating the
fuel solution to external heat exchangers.7’8

Major experimental efforts on power reactors apparently began in 1950
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time, members of the staff
began the design and building of a pilot plant for a fluid-fuel reactor,
Homogeneous Reactor Experiment No. 1, (HRE-1). Most of the later interest
in homogenecous aqueous sclution reactors arose after the successful
operation of HRE-1, which removed most of the previous concern that
difficulties in operation and limitations on power production would make
such reactors impossible. In spite of the many new reactor concepts based
on the HRE experiments that developed, HRE-1 and HRE-2 were the only

reactors built in the series.

HRE-1 and Related Concepts

Before the first Homogeneous Reactor Experiment (HRE-1), preliminary
pilot designs, were proposed and, after the success of HRE-1, a series of
related concepts followed.

HRE-1 came into being partly owing to the doubt that a high-powered
aqueous homogeneous reactor could be operated at all because of the high
gas production and consequent bubbling. The purpose was to investigate
circulating uranium solution at high enough power and temperature to
produce electricity from the heat released. Some of the nuclear and
chemical problems studied included not only the bubbling problem, but
also the corrosion of the reactor-core materials and the tendency of the

fuel solution to become unstable, causing either precipitation of

50

hydrolysis products from the fuel or formation of two fuel phases, one
being an extremely corrosive heavy liquid. Varying core arrangements
and supercharging with oxygen were considered as means of reducing
corrosion, and adding sulfuric acid made the fuel stable at higher

tem.peratures.9

Preliminary Work

Weinberg has described 20-kw(e) pilot model for designing larger
homogeneous reactors.l!® It was suggested that the long-range homogeneous
reactors would probably be moderated with heavy water but, since ordinary
water has a much smaller slowing-down length than heavy water, substitution
of ordinary water for heavy water would produce a scaled-down reactor.
This scaled-down model would reproduce all the essential features of the
full-scale plant; hence it would be ideal as a pilot plant. The pilot
model was to have 2 kilograms of 93.4 percent enriched uranyl sulfate in
ordinary water solution, and the reacting solution was to be pumped
through the reactor vessel and heat exchanger. High temperature (400°F)
and pressure (1000 psi) would be sufficlent to keep the bubble volume
manageably small and to give a 10 percent over-all power efficiency. A

heavy-water blanket as a reflector under 1000 psi surround the reactor.

The HRE Project

A full-scale reactor was not used at the start but rather a reactor
experiment, which is defined as:!!

..""a reactor in the research and development program, usually
producing less than 10 Mwt, designed for the limited purpose of
testing the technical feasibility of a reactor concept or some
unique reactor feature or piece of equipment. A reactor
experiment 1s built with the intention of making changes in fueling
structure, assoclated components, or other components of the
reactors."

According to another definition:!2

"A reactor experiment makes no attempt to incorporate features
which would be a necessary part of any fullwscale reactor.

Reactor experiments have, as their purpose, the testing of an idea
or a unique piece of equipment. As a matter of fact, a reactor

experiment is just one phase of the research and development

51

program and should be considered as such. The size is immaterial,

but, generally, reactor experiments will be small with generation

capability of less than 10 Mw. Indeed, the actual generation of
electricity is unnecessary unless it is a vital part of the
experiment."”

It was decided to build, at Oak Ridge, HRE-1, a 1000-kw, uranyl sulfate
reactor. The primary purpose was to determine whether stable operation at
the 20-kw/liter level was possible at all; all other considerations, like
ease of maintenance, corrosion, and chemical reprocessing, were almost
ignored because it was believed that the primary question could be
answered quickly, after which the experiment could be dismantled. The
core of HRE-1 was a Type-347-stainless-steel-sphere, 18 inches in diameter,
through which circulated a 0.17-molar highly enriched solution of uranyl
sulfate in ordinary water at 1000 psi, with an outlet temperature of
250°C. The core was surrounded by a 10-inch-thick blanket of heavy water.13-15

HRE-1 achieved its full power rating of 1000 kw on February 23, 1953,
becoming the second reactor to produce electricity. It reached a maximum
power of 1600 kw on January 29, 1954, It was dismantled two years after
it was built, largely because it had served its primary purpose and there
were no special provisions for maintaining it. It demonstrated that a
high-powered aqueous homogeneous reactor could be run stably, and it
resolved the original question whether gas production would make aqueous
reactors a priori unworkable.l® The HRE-1 concept, with heavy water
possibly substituted for ordinary water, was considered for submarine
propulsion.!’ For details on the design of HRE-1, see reference 18,

This experience led to a more ambitious experiment, HRE-2, also known
as HRT, the Homogeneous Reactor Test.19 It first achieved high-power
operation on February 8, 1958.13 HRE-2 had a Zircaloy core vessel and
the intention was to try thoria slurries as well as heavy water in the
reflector.?? During March and April 1958, while the reactor was being
operated at high power (maximum power of 6.3 Mw), a hole was melted in
the core tank after 30 minutes of operation at 6.3 Mw. The hole resulted
from an unsatisfactory hydrodynamic design of the core and the high-
temperature instability of the fuel. 1In addition to the hole, other
damage included severe local overheating of some metal surfaces. Hence,

more emphasis was placed on core design and hydrodynamics studies in the

52

development programs.?! See also references 22 and 23.

The core was inspected and, because the hole was inaccessible, nuclear
operation was resumed; core and blanket were operated together as a one-
region reactor. The core was repaired by patching in late 1960; by this
time there were two holes in the core vessel. HRE-2 attained a power
level of 5 Mw on January 4, 1961 with no indication of the chemical
instability previously noted. However, work on HRE~2 ended when the AEC
terminated the entire homogeneous program on June 30, 1961, After the
reactor was shut down, inspection revealed that one of the core patches
had failed.2%:23

After HRE-2 was shut down and before the Homogeneous Reactor Project
was terminated, several preliminary or conceptual design studies were made
of a 5-10 Mw experimental replacement reactor suitable for installation
in the existing HRE-2 facility with a minimum of system changes. This
design included a cylindrical core with a beryllium reflector surrounded
by a blanket of thorium pellets enclosed in a removable steel pressure
vessel. The fuel was a solution of 6.56 grams of uranium-233 per liter.26728

HRE-1 and HRE-2/HRT were the only reactors to reach the hardware stage,
unless the HRT mockup be also considered a reactor. Seven other reactors,
however, were conceived in the pattern of HRE~-1. In order of increasing
size, the nine are: HRE-1, HRE-2 as conceived, HTR (the Homogeneous
Thorium Reactor), HRE-2/HRT as built, HRT as conceived, HRE-3, HRE-4,

ISHR (the Intermediate~Scale Reactor), and TBR (the Thorium Breeder
Reactor). These concepts and closely related ones have been discussed in
several reports,29733

HRE-2 and HRT as conceived are related to the HRE-2/HRT actually built
(hereafter referred to as HRT): The development program for homogeneous
reactors as set forth in the original "Five Year Plan'" by the AEC called
for two intermediate development steps after the HRE-1: the HRE-2Z and
the HRT. It was decided, however, to extrapolate the HRE-2 to an
intermediate size, with a more-flexible experimental plant, compromising
between its original size and that for the larger HRT. 3"

The HRT design has been reviewed.3® The distinction between HRE, HRT,
and TBR (the Thorium Breeder Reactor) can be clarified by analogy with the
fast-breeder program. The Homogeneous Reactor Program resembled the

fast-breeder program in its general aspect of building a succession of

53
larger reactors ending in the "“ultimate" full-scale reactor. Analogous to
the EBR, EBR-~2, PBR sequence are the HRE, HRT, TBR. The final stage of the
Homogeneous Reactor Program would involve a full-scale breeder reactor.3°®

The HTR, or Homogeneous Thorium Reactor, preceded the HRT as a concept.
It was judged unnecessary to carry this intermediate-scale reactor to the
hardware stage, and it was therefore superseded by the Homogeneous Reactor
Test, HRT. The Homogeneous Thorium Reactor was planned to produce 65,000
kw(t) of which 16,000 kw would be converted to electricity. A blanket of
thorium, from which uranium-233 would be produced, was planned. The core
would not be as large as that for a full-scale reactor but the thickness
of thorium blanket and concentration of fertile material would be the same
as for a central power station of this type.37

The third phase of the homogeneous program—-presumably after HRE-1
and HRE-2 were conceived-~was the medium-sized Homogeneous Thorium Reactor
(HTR), a thorium breeder fueled with uranium-233 to produce 65,000 kw(t).37238
The HRE-2 concept was later modified to be more useful and more powerful
than HRE-1, with power levels of 10 megawatts rather than 3 megawatts
planned. It was more versatile, and by 1957 included a blanket system
with chemical-reprocessing equipment as part of the reactor. Thus it was
judged unnecessary to construct an intermediate-scale homogeneous reactor,
because the modified HRE-2 would provide most of the technological
information originally expected from the intermediate-size reactor.3?

At an earlier date, a stage intermediate between HRT and TBR was
considered. Research and design leading to construction of an intermediate-
scale homogeneous reactor was undertaken. The reactor was conceived of as
operating at a maximum of 40 Mw and to be of a size approaching that of a
full-scale reactor, i.e., with a core tank 8 to 10 feet in diameter,
compared to a diameter of 15 to 20 feet for a full-scale reactor."?

This Intermediate Scale Homogeneous Reactor (ISHR)“1:%2 went through
several variations. Its design was started in 1951-1952 to provide the
information necessary for reasonable extrapolation from the HRE to a full-
scale production reactor. Several types of blankets were considered for
the ISHR, especially fluidized thorium oxide."3 Further work was deferred
late in 1953, however, when it became evident from HRE-1 and the associated
development program that construction of a second homogeneous reactor

experiment would be more suitable.“"

54

Thus the ISHR, like HTR, was replaced by the HRT program, and the
sequence ran from HRE to HRT and TBR.

ISHR was intended to demonstrate nuclear, chemical, engineering, and
economic feasibility of an aqueous homogeneous solution reactor by actual
testing on a scale smaller than that of the final full-scale reactor. >
Some of the problems inherent in the power reactor but not apparent in the
HRE-1 or HRT might be expected to appear at this point.

The problem of core construction, for example, was considered with the
view of assuring feasibility of and economy in construction, stability of
flow, adequate heat removal from all points, low pressure drop (preferably
less than 15 psi), low gas holdup, and velocities near the walls consistent
with corrosion problems. Various core configurations were considered,
including straight-through and spherical shapes, but no specific choice
was made prior to 1953, the end of the effort on ISHR.*®

Designs based on the ISHR include the Cooling Tower Reactor,L+7 a

two-region converter,“8s%% a one-region breeder,SO a two-region breeder,51

and a three-region lithium converter.>?

The Thorium Breeder Reactor (TBR), was intended to develop the concept
of a thorium-uranium-233 breeder power station in sufficient detail to
provide the basis for detailed design by an architect—engineer.2

One design reported53 was for a power station, consisting of three
reactors, each delivering 100 Mw. They are spherical, two-region reactors,
with enriched uranyl sulfate solution in heavy water as fuel and a slurry
of thorium oxide in heavy water as fertile material.

In 1955, it was decided that, because of insufficient data, intelligent
study of a specific reactor was not possible and the original program was
modified to include a preliminary investigation of four variants of the
thorium breeder reactor, in the hope that advances in technology would
permit selection of one of them for further study later.>% The TBR design,
however, was set aside because of urgent work needed for the HRT.?3

HRE-3 was designed to provide operational and technical data and to
demonstrate technical feasibility of an intermediate-scale, two-region
aqueous homogeneous power breeder, but it was interrupted to apply
additional effort to problems encountered in slurry-fueled reactors, and,

to await resclution of problems that had arisen in operation of the HRT. 2226

HRE=-3 had been intended to study the two-region power concept on a small

55

scale, starting in 1961 with a 50-Mw prototype plant, with further development
depending on the success of the prototype.>’

In HRE-3, the fuel was uranyl sulfate solution in heavy water, with a
blanket slurry of thorium oxide in heavy water, a 50-Mw core, a 10-Mw blanket,
and an electrical output of 19 Mw,.>°

HRE-4 was a slurry-fueled reactor, which will be described under that

category.,

The Homogeneous Reactor Project

The ORNL Homogeneous Reactor Experiment Project (HRE) was reconstituted
in about 1951 as the Homogeneous Reactor Project (HRP) to study the
feasibility of a full-scale homogeneous reactor to produce plutonium°58
Many alternative designs were studied, and attention was given to such
problems as the behavior of solutions and slurries in reactors and corrosion
difficulties. For example, in 1956, members of the project reported on HRT
and five other possible designs: a U235 burner fueled with uranyl sulfate
in heavy water; two one-region U238-Pu converters, one fueled with uranyl
sulfate solution, the other with a slurry of uranium trioxide and plutonium
dioxide in heavy water; and two Th-—U233 breeders, a two-region and a one-region,
one fueled with solution, the other with slurry.®? Also a breeder with a
blanket of thorium oxide pellets was later suggested.3? Designs for two
other solution-fueled reactors were for power reactors producing 380 Mw(e).00,61
The project, along with the entire subject of fluid-fuel reactors, was later
evaluated, as described under "“Evaluation and Status."

A typical aqueous homogeneous reactor concept developed for evaluation
purposes is the Aqueous Homogeneous Breeder Reactor.®2 This concept resembled
many of the thorium breeders, with its aqueous uranyl sulfate solution as
fuel and a slurry blanket of ThO2 pellets. It especially resembles the
reactor described in reference 33, Special provisions were made in the
design of the blanket structure. A variation, in which thorium tetrafluoride
pellets replace the thorium oxide in the blanket, was suggested to obtain
higher fuel yields and lower fuel-cycle costs. Much of the claimed lower
cost would be due to less=expensive fuel reprocessing.53

Boiling was considered as a means to remove power from the thorium oxide
blanket of large two-region breeders like those studied by HRP, but it was

rejected in favor of circulating the slurry.®"

56

The LAPRE and Related Reactors

Two power=reactor experiments, somewhat analogous to HRE-1 and HRE=2,
were carried out at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. 1In Los Alamos
Power Reactor Experiments I and II (LAPRE-I and LAPRE-IT), the fuel
solution consisted of uranium oxides dissolved in aqueous phosphoric acid,®3-68

Phosphoric acid solutions of uranium have several advantages that make
them attractive as reactor fuels. Their low vapor pressure and high thermal
stability permit operations at higher temperatures than are possible with
other aqueous solutions. Still other advantages are the high hydrogen
density and low cross-section for neutron absorption, which permit the use
of small, compact reactors and low fuel inventories. There is, however, a
grave disadvantage., The extreme corrosivity of the acid solutions makes the
choice of containment materials very difficult and requires unusual pre-
cautions. LAPRE~T and LAPRE-II were designed to determine whether such
solutions were practical reactor fuels and to design reactors that could best
use them,

The cylindrical form of the LAPRE reactor vessels has led to the name

"Test=Tube Reactors" being applied to them,
LAPRE=T

LAPRE~T (originally designated DIR-P) was intended to be a compact,
high-temperature nuclear steam generator of simple and compact design, in
which the reactor and heat exchanger would be in a single vessel. Thus,
external circulation of highly radiocactive solution is avoided. The fuel
solution was a solution of highly enriched uranium trioxide (111 grams U235
per liter) in aqueous phosphoric acid containing 53 wt.%Z acid. The cylindrical
reactor had a critical zone above the cooling coils over which solution was
circulated by a pump. Oxygen overpressure was used. Below the coils was a
reservoir region, which contained a boron rod to prevent criticality and
permitted storage of excess solution. To minimize corrosion, the vessel and
all components exposed to the acid were gold-plated, except for certain items
made of or coated with platinum.66,%7

The reactor went critical in February 1956. A maximum operating
temperature of 390°C at about 150 kw was achieved before a failure in the
heat-exchange system ended the test, Inspection showed that the gold cladding
on one of the exchanger tubes had ruptured. No more tests were made and the

reactor was dismantled in January 1957, The experience, however, provided

valuable information for the design of LAPRE-II,66,67

57
LAPRE-II

LAPRE-II differed in several ways from LAPRE~I. A more concentrated
solution of phosphoric acid was used--95 wt.Z Instead of 53. The vapor
pressure of the resulting solution, even at 450°C, was only about 800 psi,
compared with 4500 psi for the LAPRE-I solution. Because of its reducing
properties, this solution attacks only slowly any metal below hydrogen in
the electromotive series. The lower vapor pressure of the LAPRE~II solution
permits a reactor vessel of thinner walls. Instead of pumping the solution
for cooling, circulation over the cooling coils was by natural convection.

An external annular reflector of graphite and beryllium was provided. Gold
cladding was again applied to exposed surfaces.®8,62

Operation of this experiment began in February 1959 and continued into
May of the same year. The maximum fuel temperature measured was 826°F. Full-
power operation was reached on April 22. The maximum power was 745 kw, at
745°F and 670 psi. The operation was satisfactory at widely varying power
demands, and the power was limited only by the capacity of the primary cooling
loop. The gold cladding was shown to be a possible answer to the corrosion
difficulty, but improvements in materials and fabrication methods are needed.
As an advanced concept, the use of impervious graphite as container material
was suggested, and in one reactor concept, such graphite would be material for
the common container and primary heat exchanger.68,63
A version of LAPRE-II, with a spherical core, increased power, and

other modifications were proposed for application to the DEW line.”’®

Sandia Phosphoric Acid Reactor

A model employing the LAPRE concept has been designed by Sandia
Corporation for remote locations or mobile units.’! It would generate from

100 to 1500 kw(e).

Other Homogeneous Aqueous Solution Reactors

Many concepts for aqueous reactors were developed after the success of
HRE~1, and some were developed even before the completion on this experiment.
A few were one-region converters or breeders, but most were one-region

burners or two-region breeders.

One-Region Burners

One~-region burners have received considerable attention as sources of

industrial power. Published concepts are similar in several ways. In nearly

58
all, for example, highly enriched uranyl sulfate solution in water is the
fuel, and a system pressure of 1000-2000 psi is usual.

Much of the earlier work was on mobile reactors.

A reactor to produce 250 Mw(t) was described in a 1950 report by workers
at ORNL.’2 It utilized enriched uranyl sulfate in light water and super-
heating steam by burning radiolytic gas, and it is otherwise similar to most
other burners., Two variations were proposed. Each differed from the
original only in such details as fuel enrichment and concentration.

Solution power burners have been considered for locomotion. A study
at the University of Utah found that a locomotive powered by a nuclear
reactor would be technically feasible.’?® The reactor would produce 30,000 kw
as steam at 250 psig to operate a 7200-hp locomotive., The reactor contains
a core of fully enriched uranyl sulfate solution within two hexagonal slabs,
Adjacent to each slab is a water reflector connected to heat=transfer tubes,
which penetrate the core. Water circulates through tubes and reflectors for
cooling. Control is by means of rods in the core. Likewise, a Russian
design for a locomotive, powered by a reactor fueled with a water solution
of a uranium salt, has been described.’" The economic feasibility of nuclear-
powered locomotives has, however, been questioned.’® A Wright-Patterson study
of 1959, concluded that, for aircraft and remote applications, in general the
problems of aqueous homogeneous reactors were not immediately surmountable, /®

Students at the 0Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology reported in a
term paper a design for a solution burner for ship propulsionc77 In the
generally conventional design, a spherical core with concentric inlet and
outlet was included because its flow pattern would be stable under the
rolling conditions aboard ship.

Three other reactor concepts, for producing power in remote locations,
developed by OSORT students were: a 10-Mw reactor;’8 "STUPQO"=-so named
because of an unsuccessful attempt to extrapolate the data of LOPO and SUPO; 7°
and an 80-Mw reactor.®% The first reactor is claimed to be unique in that
construction of a prototype is feasible without additional development. The
STUPO project considered a reactor with a maximum power of 10 Mw and
reliability for use in remote locations. The study concluded that feasibility
depended on whether 10 Mw of heat could be removed by natural convection,
Design power output of the 80-Mw reactor is 20 Mw(e), with an 80 percent plant
factor.

One-region burners include such utility types as the Wolverine Electric

Cooperative Reactor and those proposed by General Electric and Westinghouse,

59
The Foster Wheeler Company proposed in 1955 to construct an aqueous solution
reactor for Wolverine,®! but the project was cancelled in May 1958 because
new projections showed an excessive increase in cost. In December 1957
engineers from Oak Ridge, Sargent and Lundy, and Foster-Wheeler redesigned
the reactor, using highly enriched uranyl sulfate in heavy water, under
pressure to prevent boiling.82 Uranium-235 would have to be added periodically
to the reactor because of depletion of the original fuel by fission,83

The General Electric 100 kw(e) power plant had a circulating fuel
solution of highly enriched uranyl sulfate in light water contained in a
titanium~lined carbon-steel pressure vessel, which also served as a
reflector.8* The vessel was cylindrical, with a hemispherical bottom.
Control was by the temperature coefficient of reactivity of the core. The
proposal included a standard straight tube-and-shell heat exchanger. Many
of the details of this design were based on data from the Oak Ridge Homogeneous
Reactor Project. Westinghouse described a one-region 80,000 kw uranium-235
reactor, in which the fuel was a dilute uranyl sulfate solution.®> Corrosion
was the major consideration in selecting most of the design parameters.
Another Westinghouse concept of this type is described in reference 86,

Babcock and Wilcox considered both a non-boiling and a boiling solution
burner.8? The low-power non-boiling system consists of a uranyl sulfate
solution in a cylindrical vessel under an oxygen pressure of 1200 psi.

Heat exchange is through bayonet cooling tubes immersed in the solution.
Kasten and Claiborne®® studied fuel costs for spherical one-region
power reactors containing 90 percent enriched uranyl sulfate in either heavy

or light water and producing 25 Mw(e). The feed is also 90 percent
enriched, They concluded that the technology of this type was fairly well
developed as a result of the homogeneous-reactor program, and in fact

that the technology seemed sufficiently developed to warrant serious

consideration of the construction of these burner reactors.

One-Region Converters and Breeders

Some of the earliest concepts developed under the Manhattan Project
were of this type, usually with uranyl sulfate solution as fuel, with heavy
water as the moderator.®® A one-region breeder similar to HRE-1 was the
Homogeneous Power Reactor.?? It was fueled by a solution of plutonium-239

in heavy water, but few other details are available.

60

In 1950, the ORNL Long-Range Planning Group proposed a reactor for

power and plutonium production.?!

A solution of enriched uranyl sulfate
in heavy water flows through a spherical reactor into high-pressure
tubing, through the reactor shield, and into heat exchangers.

In 1952, the Large Scale Homogeneous Reactor concept was published at
Oak Ridge.%? 1In this reactor, designed for plutonium production, the
fuel was slightly enriched uranyl sulfate in heavy water, under a pressure
of 1000 psia. A similar reactor has also been proposed.93 Corrosion
was the chief difficulty with both.

A study of the economics of one-region breeders compared with two-
region breeders?“ showed that, for a three-reactor power station producing
375 Mw(e), the cost of power from a one-region reactor station would be
0.9 mills per kwh higher than that for the two-region station--7.1 mills
per kwh vs. 6.2 mills per kwh. In another study,>° one-region solution
reactors were compared with slurry reactors. A one-region spherical
solution reactor operating at 330°C and delivering 300 Mw(e) was found
to be competitive with slurry-fueled reactors.

A Russian reactor that is apparently a one-region converter has
been described in surveys of Russian reactors.2s97 In this homogeneous
reactor, designed as a prototype of a power station with high output,
uranium enriched to 0.9 percent U235, apparently as an oxide suspension
in heavy water, is the fuel. The pressure of the coolant is from 20 to
50 atmospheres, and the maximum temperature is 260°C. The power is from
1,150 to 2,000 Mw(t) or 280-500 Mw(e). In the design stage in 1960,
the reactor project was expected to require seven to eight years. For
this period, the consumption of natural uranium was estimated to be

306 tons, and of 0.95 percent enriched uranium, 43 tons.

Two-Region Converters and Breeders

Two-region solution reactors, some of which generally resemble the
Thorium Breeder Reactor of the HRE series, have received much attention
and many concepts have been published.

Several concepts were developed by workers in the Manhattan Project,%’99
In three of them, the fuel is enriched sodium uranyl carbonate dissolved in
heavy water. The fertile material is thorium metal, either in a slurry or
as rods. One, the Heavy Water Moderated U233 Pile, was designed to produce

100 Mw. A few others, generally similar in basic concepts, have also been

61
described.100,101

Wigner has described an unusual early concept.102 The core tank is a
U-tube, with cooling tubes that extend into it from both sides, with the
bottom portion free of these tubes. Pistons in each leg of the tube move
the solution from left to right alternately so that it comes in contact
with the cooling tubes. The U~tube contains a solution of a U233 salt in
heavy water, and a slurry blanket of thorium in heavy water surrounds the
bottom of the tube.

After World War II, and even before the completion of the HRE series,
work at Oak Ridge resulted in concepts designed for both breeding and for
electrical power.

An early power-breeder concept was developed at ORSORT. Imn the reactor,
a solution of U233 as uranyl sulfate in light water is the fuel and a
slurry of thorium tetrafluoride is the fertile material.l®3 Both core and
blanket are under 1000 psi. Students at ORSORT also developed a concept
for a reactor to produce both power and special isotopes.lO“

Two more ORSORT concepts were the Ultimate Homogeneous Reactor! 0> and
the High Temperature Homogeneous Reactor.19® The first was perhaps so
named because its purpose was to investigate the ultimate limitations of
aqueous homogeneous reactor technology and to assess, by means of a
design example, how far the homogeneous line of development could be
followed, After considering other types of reactors, the authors decided
on uranyl sulfate fuel; heavy water as coolant-moderator, with natural
circulation; and a blanket of a slurry of thorium dioxide in heavy water.
These conditions were chosen as best for higher core-power density,
higher thermal efficiency, and constant turbine steam conditions from no
load to full load in a 200-Mw breeder. The High-Temperature Homogeneous
Reactor differed especially in the fuel solution, in which uranium-233
trioxide and chromium trioxide form a solution in light water. The
pressure is also higher than usual--3500 psi. This high pressure permits
a higher outlet temperature of the solution. The design was for a plant
using two such reactors to produce a total of 290 Mw(e).

Work at ORNL produced concepts for power and breeding that had some
features that differed considerably from the earliest ideas. Visner, for

example proposed a two-region reactor without a core tank.!97 The uranyl

sulfate solution fuel is in the same contalner as the thorium oxide slurry

62

blanket. They are kept separate by operating the reactor as a centrifugal
separator, so that the solution remains in the center and the slurry at
the periphery. In the K-49 reactor,108 a solution of uranyl sulfate in
heavy water, rather than thorium metal or slurry, is the fertile material
in the blanket. A long-range concept developed at ORNL was the Thermal
Power Breeder.!9? It is a two-region breeder, in which uranium~233 as
uranyl sulfate is the fuel and a suspension of thorium oxide in heavy
water is the fertile material. This reactor is designed for steam
production in a power plant, with the additional feature of breeding more
uranium—-233.

Two other ORNL concepts aimed at power for commercial use were the
Project Dynamo concept and a reactor for central station power. Engineering
details for the first were developed by the Project Dynamo staff from an
ORNL concept.!1? Three such reactors, producing 450 Mw(t) each, were
designed for a power station. The fuel is a solution of uranyl (uranium-233)
sulfate in heavy water and the blanket a slurry of thorium oxide in heavy
water. One design for the central station power reactor utilized a
solution of uranyl sulfate in heavy water as fuel and a slurry of thorium
dioxide and uranium trioxide, also in heavy water, as fertile material,ll!
Power produced would be 100 Mw(e).

A two-region reactor developed at Oak Ridge was aimed at plutonium
production.!12 The blanket is a concentrated solution of natural uranyl
sulfate in heavy water. Plutonium of low plutonium-240 content could be
obtained by continuously processing the blanket solution. This reactor
experiment was planned to simulate reactor operations.

The Nuclear Power Group, composed of several private companies,
developed concepts for two-region power-breeder reactors. The group was
formed in October 1953 for broadening the scope of the previous nuclear
power studies by the individual companies--American Gas and Electric
Service Corporation, Bechtel Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Company,
Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and Union Electric Company of Missouri.
The initial objective was to select a reactor design that might be
constructed in the reasonably near future primarily to produce electric
power.113

Although the pressurized-water reactor seemed to meet thelr requirements

most closely, the Group conceived at least two homogeneous aqueous high-power,

63
blanket breeder concepts. One design consisted of a spherical core--6 feet
in diameter--of uranyl sulfate dissolved in heavy water. The core is
surrounded by a spherical blanket——2 feet thick-—of thorium oxide and uranium
slurry in heavy water.!1l* Uranium-235 could be used to start the reactor

and it could also be adapted to the uranium-238 - plutonium cycle. The
concentration, breeding gain, and reactor calculations were based on Oak
Ridge data,l1°7118 gpgq they were extrapolated to determine concentration

and power gain for this NPG reactor. Staff members at Oak Ridge also

alded NPG in completing this design, which is much like Oak Ridge designs.

By July 1957, the Nuclear Power Group, which now also included Central
Illinois Light Company, Illinois Power Company, and Kansas City Power and
Light Company, formed a joint study team with Babcock and Wilcox and
presented a conceptual design of a single-fluid, 150,000 kw(e) reactor
power plant developed by Babcock and Wilcox.112® To aveid the slurry
problems usually associated with homogeneous breeder reactors, a single-
fluid, two-region reactor with a blanket consisting of assemblies of beds
of thorium oxide pellets was selected. The assemblies would be periodically
rotated to equalize the breeding of uranium-233 in the pellet beds.

In developing the Homogeneous Aqueous Reactor (HAR) concept, British
workers studied many types before settling on the two-reglon power breeder,
similar in several ways to the Thorium Breeder Reactor proposed by ORNL.
More than one version of this two~region pressurized reactor have been
described, 120—123

A Japanese group considered an Aqueous Homogeneous Breeder Reactor
similar to that of ORNL.!2% The fertile material would be thorium oxide
slurry in heavy water so as to take advantage of Japan's abundant thorium
supplies.

A Russian non-boiling two-region reactor has been reported, but few
details have been given.l25 Plutonium is bred from a solution of a natural
uranium salt in heavy water enriched with plutonium produced in the same
reactor.

A concept for a Swedish two-region breeder is described in a French
patent.!?® It 1s claimed to have the advantages of both one- and two-region
breeders. Alternative fuels are a solution of uranyl sulfate, suspension of
uranium oxide, or solution of plutonium sulfate, all in heavy water. The

fertile material is either a slurry of thorium oxide, a slurry of uranium

64
oxide, or a thorium nitrate solution, also in heavy water. Means are
provided to exchange material between core and blanket and to separate

slurry into solids and liquid.

Non~-Homogeneous Aqueous Solution Reactors

Several reactor concepts that have been proposed include aqueous
solutions in a structured core in the presence of a massive moderator or
in a container.

Most of these will be included under "Semi-Homogeneous Reactors"
in Part II. One concept that will be covered here is the reactor in
which a uranium solution is contained in tubes. In a reactor designed
for power and for breeding uranium-233, a solution of uranium=233 in
heavy water is contained in tubes, around which a fertile slurry of
thorium=232 in (preferably) heavy water flows. The slurry extracts
heat from the fuel,!?7

Colloidal Fuels

Colloidal suspensions (sols) have been suggested as nuclear fuels,
No complete reactor concept has been developed, but workers at Ionics,
Inc., have proposed use of urania-thoria sols in water,!28 Particle
size is approximately 25 mu. They prepared such sols that were stable
for several hundred hours at 250-300°C., Because of their neutral
environment, very slow settling, and non-caking characteristics, such
sols are claimed to ameliorate the conditions of corrosion and phase
instability of solution fuels, and the settling, caking, and erosion
difficulties of slurries. No work, however, appears to have been done
on radiation stability or other properties that would be significant in

a reactor,

Slurry-Fueled Reactors

In general, aqueous-slurry (suspension) reactors are nearly defined
by their name. Many definitions have been given, but most differ only
in details. In this chapter, the definition of Lane, McPherson, and
Maslanl?9 will be used. Aqueous slurry fuels are suspensions of loose
and relatively independent clouds of joined particles (flocs) that are
large enough to settle. The particle size varies widely, depending on

the material, but 50 to 500 mp covers them gemnerally. They thus differ

65
from colloids, in which the particles are so finely divided that their
surface attraction forces exert a strong influence on the mechanical
properties of the material as a whole. Normally colloidal particles do
not settle out on standing.

Slurries attracted attention early as possible reactor fuels. In fact,
as mentioned in Chapter 2, Von Halban and Kowarski used a suspension of
uranium oxide in heavy water to demonstrate the possibility of a self-
sustaining nuclear reaction. Their several advantages include the
possibility of obtaining higher concentrations of fissionable material
and freedom from the corrosivity of acid solutions. Their use, however,
also has disadvantages, which include caking and settling of the solid
particles, erosion, and pumping difficulties. Solving these problems has
been a large part of the research and development on these reactors.

As with solution reactors, no commercial reactors using slurries have been
built, although several have been designed, and the feasibility of such
reactors has not yet been conclusively established.

The early history of slurry reactors generally parallels that of
solution reactors. There was early interest and extensive research, which
later diminished until the renewal of interest with the HRE project.

Lane, MacPherson, and Maslan have reviewed the early development.'

Workers at the University of Chicago, Columbia University, the Clinton
Laboratories and other laboratories studied the behavior of slurries,
difficulties of using them, and reactor concepts that could be based on
them, This research continued until near the end of 1944, when most of

it ended. Some continued, however, especially at the Clinton Laboratories.

The early work resulted in some reactor concepts, and provided
valuable information for later work under the Homogeneous Reactor
Project. One of the earlier concepts was for a homogeneous production
and power pile using a slurry of uranium oxide in heavy water.!30 The
slurry is pumped through pipes to heat exchangers or flash evaporators, then
back to the pile.

At Columbia, a general concept for a slurry reactor was reported in
1944,131 A slurry of slightly enriched (uranium=233) uranium trioxide is
suspended in heavy water and, presumably, cooled by circulation to
external heat exchangers. The power was estimated at 600 Mw. Other

concepts from the Manhattan Project included the Homogeneous Slurry Pileld2

66

and the Heterogeneous Slurry Pile.l33 Most of the other early slurry
concepts either closely resemble these concepts or have been incorporated

into later designs.

Slurry Development in the HRE Project

Before and during the Homogeneous Reactor Project, extensive
development was carried out at Oak Ridge on slurries and slurry reactors.
Such problems as the preparation of suitable slurries, prevention of
caking and settling, and determination of optimum particle sizes were
investigated, and designs for slurry reactors were formulated. Much of
this work is reported in the Quarterly Progress Reports of the Homogeneous
Reactor Project, particularly some of those for 1950-1952,134=-136

A reactor originally proposed in 1943, the Natural-Uranium-Plutonium
Producer, was considered by the Homogeneous Reactor Project in 1949.°20
In this one-region converter, the fuel is a slurry of natural uranium
oxide in heavy water. The alternative fuel considered was a solution of
uranyl fluoride in heavy water. For this fuel, the reactor would be
operated at high pressure., This concept was considered to offer the
possibility of being the most economical plutonium producer.

A slurry reactor was conceived as an alternative to the solution
breeder for central-station power described under '"Two-Region Converters
and Breeders."!l! It is a single-region breeder, with a slurry of
thorium dioxide and uranium trioxide in heavy water serving as fuel,
coolant, moderator, and fertile material. The power is rated at 100 Mw(e).

A one-region uranium-238 converter and power reactor was one of the
reactors evaluated in 1956 for possible large-scale development.®? 1In
this reactor, a slurry of uranium trioxide and plutonium dioxide in heavy
water is the fuel. It is designed for a conversion ratio of 0.88 and
production of 440 Mw(t), or 100 Mw(e) from the generating plant.

In 1956, nuclear characteristics were computed for more than 400
two-region spherical reactors having a slurry of thorium dioxide and
uranium-233 dioxide in the core and blanket.l37

After the solution-fueled reactors in the HRE sequency, HRE-4 was
designed as a slurry-fueled reactor.l3%:13% The purpose was to study
such aspects as criticality, effects of radiation on slurries, and
operational problems of a slurry-fueled reactor. It is a one-region

reactor fueled with a slurry of thorium dioxide and enriched uranium

67
dioxide in heavy water. The system is pressurized by boiling slurry in
the dump tank. The original design power level was 5 Mw(t). It was
planned to operate HRE-4 later with higher concentrations of slurry in
the blanket, concentrations approaching those in the blanket of a two-
region breeder. A later report!“0 refers to HRE-4 as a 100~kw critical
system, with a moderator of 80 percent heavy and 20 percent light water,
A reactor concept developed late in the Homogeneous Reactor Project
was a power breeder with a slurry core and blanket.®? The fuel is a
slurry of thorium dioxide and enriched uranium oxide in heavy water. The
fertile blanket is a slurry of thorium oxide in heavy water. This reactor was

designed for high power--1140 Mw(t) or 333 Mw(e).

ORSORT Concepts

Students at the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology designed slurry
reactors for generating electrical power. In the reactor for electrical
power in a stationary plant, the '"Homogeneous Power Producer,"!%1l the core
is a stainless-steel sphere, with concentric shells. It is cooled by
water circulating between the inner and outer shells. The fuel-moderator-
coolant-fertile material is a slurry of natural uranium in heavy
water. The plutonium produced remains as supplementary fuel. In another
slurry reactor for power, natural uranium trioxide, as a slurry in heavy
water, is the fuel.l“*2? Two reactors are combined to produce a total power

of 1000 Mw(t).

The PAR Reactor

The Dow Chemical Company and Detroit Edison worked on developing a
slurry reactor for power.l"3 It would be fueled with a slurry of uranium
oxide or oxyfluoride in heavy or light water, and it would have a graphite
core structure. It would be workable, but the need for expensive low-
temperature, low-pressure steam installations resulted in the abandonment
of this reactor.

The Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor (PAR) has been referred to as the
second, and last attempt in the U. S. to use the concept of homogeneous
aqueous fuels industrially.l“® The first was considered to be the Wolverine
solution reactor. Thus the authors disregarded the Dow-Detroit Edison
concept.

The PAR, also known as the Pennsylvania State Advanced Reactor, was a

68
one-region aqueous slurry type using uranium oxide fuel and thorium oxide
fertile material, with very fine particles—-under 5 u--suspended in heavy
water, which acts as both moderator and coolant. The slurry is pumped
through the spherical reactor vessel. It then goes to heat exchangers
for steam generation. The power for a reference design is 550 thermal

megawatts. ">

The PAR Project originated in November 1954, when Pennsylvania
Power and Light Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation joined
to survey feasibility of various reactor types for power generation.

The PAR Project, formally set up in August 1955, was part of the
Westinghouse commercial atomic power activities in Pittsburgh.!“® Shortly
after the start of the Project, Union Carbide Nuclear Company joined the
group to study the chemical-reprocessing problems involved.!"’

After two and a half years of the program, the AEC indicated
willingness to support the research and development leading to the design
of a plantyi"*8 in 1958, Pennsylvania Power and Light decided to abandon
the project, but decided to develop a final reference design. A small
prototype had been judged necessary before the final industrial design,
but it was abandoned because it was considered too expensive,l“?

A major effort on the project was directed toward finding solutions
to problems associated with transferring and circulating aqueous
slurries of thorium oxide at the concentrations and conditions of a
single-region homogeneous reactor.1%0 The world's largest test loop
for homogeneous reactors, capable of circulating 4000 gpm at the same
temperatures and pressures planned for the power plant, was used in

pumping slurry for 35,000 hours.

KEMA Reactors

The research laboratory of N. V. KEMA, the Netherlands, has instituted
a program to develop a suspension-fueled power reactor. The three steps
planned are: a subcritical assembly, a small-scale process reactor, and
a power-demonstration reactor.!>! To date, only the first two steps have
reached the concept stage.

The suspension-type reactor is known, together with its subcritical

69
assemblies, as the Aqueous Homogeneous Suspension Reactor, Arnhem Suspension
Reactor, BABYPOP, KSRT or KEMA Suspension Test Reactor, Subcritical
Homogeneous Suspension Reactor, Suspension Test Reactor, SUSPOP, or 250
kw Homogeneous Suspension Reactor.

KEMA chose a suspension reactor, although it had been abandoned in the
U. S., for several reasons.l®2»153 The homogeneous reactor with fissile
material distributed in heavy water needs no structured core and also has
a high power extraction. Fission products can be removed from the reactor
medium in a decontamination plant. No safety or control rods are required.
Also a high conversion rate of fertile to fissile material with low fuel-
fabrication and processing costs is possible.

The initial reactors were BABYPOP, and SUSPOP. BABYPOP was a zero-

power reactor in which uranium dioxide or U_O_ is suspended in light water.

Little has been published concerning it,1213b3t it apparently has most of
the features of SUSPOP, a subcritical assembly that would become critical
later if possible. SUSPOP is fueled with an aqueous homogeneous suspension
containing 20 percent enriched uranium as uranium dioxide.151,153,154 1¢
is moderated with light water and reflected by beryllium oxide and graphite.
R. C. N. (Reactor Centrum Nederland) owns SUSPOP, which KEMA has operated
since 1955 to investigate the flow behavior of a circulating suspension
reactor.

The second stage, or process reactor, is also known as the KEMA
Suspension Test Reactor. It has been designed as a one-region reactor
fueled with a suspension of 20 percent enriched uranium dioxide suspended
in light water.!®%"156 It is pressurized with hydrogen to reduce oxidation,
water decomposition, and stress corrosion. The design power is 250 kw.

This reactor is intended for investigating, under power-reactor conditions,
chemical and mechanical properties of the suspension, water decomposition,
and special purification systems that had been suggested. The power
density, temperatures, and suspension concentration are meant to equal
those in a normal power reactor. This reactor was originally scheduled

for construction after the zero-energy reactor had operated satisfactorily.

The third stage is intended to be a simplified power demonstration
reactor in which important reactor components--vessels, valves, pumps,

etc.—-would be investigated, as would the possibility of remote maintenance

of such an installation.

70

Other reactors were considered briefly.157 A heterogeneous suspension
reactor might use natural uranium if it were heterogeneous both geometrically
and thermally. A very concentrated suspension would flow through tubes
inside the reactor tank filled with heavy water. Just after leaving the
reactor the concentrated suspension would be diluted slightly so it could
easily flow through the external heat exchanger. A homogeneous reactor
comparable to SUSPOP, was also considered. It would use light water (in
dilute suspension only) as both moderator and suspension liquid for uranium
trioxide or U308°

In 1962 it was reported that work in SUSPOP was continuing, in
collaboration with teams at Harwell, Mol (Belgium), and Saclay (France) .18

Construction of the test reactor was under discussion.

Other Slurry Concepts

In addition to those concepts already discussed, other slurry-fueled
reactors have been considered in England, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and
Russia, with varying degrees of development taking place.

In developing the Homogeneous Aqueous Reactor (HAR), the British
Atomic Energy Research Establishment studied slurries and considered them
as possible fuels. In 1954, the two-region pressurized reactor, with a
solution of uranium-233 salt in heavy water and a blanket of thorium
oxide slurry, was chosen over the single-zone slurry reactor. The choice
was made because the single~region slurry and other reactors either
were less economic, required new developments, or had stability or
safety problems,!%9

Later, however, when the system again came under review, the physics
of a single-region slurry system were reassessed. The reactor is assumed
to be an unreflected sphere of 7 to 15 feet in diameter, containing a
slurry of thoria with uranium-233 in heavy water.1©0

The Atomic Energy Commission of Canada in 1953 made calculations on a
two-region, heavy-water-slurry fuel reactor to assess the benefits of a
moderate amount of plutonium enrichment.!®! They concluded that the matter
deserved further study. In one concept, the reactor is fueled with a
heavy-water slurry of natural uranium oxides enriched with plutonium, with

a fertile slurry of natural uranium oxide as a blanket. The reactor

consists of two concentric spheres, with the uranium oxide slurry between

71
the spheres, and the inner sphere containing the plutonium.

HR~1 and HR-2 are Czechoslovak reactors that are slurry-fueled. HR-1
is a 10-Mw one-region homogeneous reactor, in which the fuel is a
suspension of 15 percent enriched U308 in light water. HR-1 is an
experimental pressurized homogeneous reactor suitable for research work and
for obtaining practical manufacturing and operational experience in this
field.1%2 Experiments on the hydrodynamics of the suspension led to the
HR-2 concept.!®3 The basic concept of HR~2 is an arrangement in which the
slurry moves only in the vertical plane to eliminate precipitation of the
solid phase. The active zone, which is in the lower part of the reactor,
consists of two coaxial components. The suspension flows downward in the

outer part and upward in the inner. Work on this reactor was discontinued.l6"

Evaluation and Status

The extensive developmental programs on aqueous homogeneous reactors as
power and breeder reactors have been followed by several evaluations of
these breeders for industrial promise. Some evaluations of individual
types have been discussed previously in this chapter.

One of the earlier evaluations of these reactors was that made by
the General Electric Company in 1955. They found that these reactors
must be considered as a promising approach to expansion and development of
atomic power. 16>

In 1956, Foster Wheeler Corporation and the Pacific Northwest Power
Group reported they were considering the HRT or TBR type; Foster-~Wheeler
proposed building a two-region homogeneous thorium breeder for delivery in
1961 or 1962; the exact type was unspecified.3"

The program of the Homdgeneous Reactor Project was one of those
evaluated by the Fluid Fuel Reactors Task Force. In January 1959, the
Task Force decided to reduce work on fluid fuels and consolidate it into
one program at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with basic research to
be carried out for an undetermined period.!6®

This decision was made despite the more~favorable report by members
of a review and evaluation group at Argonne National Laboratory and the
opinion of Lane. The Argonne group concluded that aqueous homogeneous
reactors offer many advantages as plutonium producers, but they must be

considered as long-range possibilities because of present difficulties.1®”

72

In March 1959, Lane commented:
..""the consensus of those associated with the Homogeneous
Reactor Program is that, in spite of technical problems which
have been encountered since the inception of the program, the
potential of aqueous homogeneous systems is as great as it ever
has been. This conclusion is based on the most recent
information.168
In April 1961, HRT was permanently shut down and the fuel was processed
for recovery of uranium-235. Work on the aqueous homogeneous reactor
concept was terminated on June 30, 1961, although some research on aqueous
systems was continued under the Thorium Utilization Program, initiated at
Oak Ridge during the latter half of 1961.2% The thorium program is
related to the previous program to develop a thorium-uranium-233 breeder.!69
Another evaluation of thorium breeder reactors, made in 1961, concluded
that the Aqueous Homogeneous Breeder Reactor ranked first over the molten-
salt, liquid-bismuth, and gas-cooled types in regard to nuclear capability,
fuel-cycle potential, and status of development.®?
To date, the current status of developmental programs and the actions
by the Atomic Energy Commission and by industry indicate that the future

commercial development of aqueous homogeneous reactors—-either solution or

slurry--remains uncertain.

Originator: ORNL staff.

Status: Critical December 1957; permanently shut down, 1961.

Details: Occupied same building that housed HRE-1l. Thermal neutrons,
steady state, burner. Fuel-moderator: 937 enriched U235 as UOZSOA-CuSO4—
HZSO4 in D20. CuSO4 added to supress radiolytic decomposition of water.
Coolant: circulating fuel solution. Reflector: D20, 13,69 in. thick
between core tank and stainless-steel clad carbon steel pressure (2000
psi) vessel (60 in. ID); cooled by circulation through heat exchanger.
Average temperature for both fuel solution and moderator: 280°C;
pressure: 1700 psi. Core tank: inverted-pear shape (top section 32 in.
ID, spherical) of Zircaloy-2, 290 liters volume. Designed as two-region
reactor, but hole in core tank let fuel into reflector. Consequently run
as one-region. Control: no control rods; ratio of heat withdrawal from
reactor (power demand at turbine) automatically met by negative temperature
coefficient (~0.3% Ak/°C at 280°C). Normal control by dilution of fuel
with DZO' Power in core: 5 Mw(t). HRE-2 was built to answer questions
of reliability, performance, and maintenance in long-term operation.
Construction completed in April 1956. From then until December 1957,
non-nuclear tests were performed.

ORNL

Reference: CF-61-7-54; CF-59-8-110.

Originator: R. H. Chapman.

Status: Reference design report as a result of termination by AEC of HRP,
Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder (when blanket is used as
described here). Fuel-moderator-coolant: solution of U235 (presumably
highly enriched uranyl sulfate) in D20. Reflector: 4-in., thick Be
surrounding Zircaloy-2 cylindrical core tank (21 in, ID x 42 in. long).
Fuel enters tangentially through two "slotted-entry" headers on the
cylindrical portion of the tank with sufficient velocity to provide

proper cooling of the wall. At each end of the headers, the slots

direct some flow into the hemispherical ends; the major portion leaves
through an outlet on the top of the tank. An 8-in.-thick ThO2 pellet
blanket surrounds the Be. Fuel and blanket temperature: 280°C. Breeding
ratio: estimated at 1.07 for 6 in. blanket. Control: (probably) by
negative temperature coefficient. Power: 5-10 Mw. This design is for

an experimental reactor suitable for installation in the existing HRE-2
facility with a minimum of system changes.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, converter. Fuel-moderator:

2.5% enriched U235 as uranyl sulfate in D20. Solution temperature: 250°C.,
Both vortex and axial flow studied as possibilities. Core vessel:
spherical stainless steel, 6 ft in diameter. Maximum pressure: 1000 psia.

Status: Preliminary design, 1953; no further work.
Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner, converter, or breeder.
Based on the ISHR Single-Region design, the Cooling Tower Reactor differs
mainly in the method of removing heat from the solution. Fuel-moderator:
U02804 solution in D20 at 700 psia. Solution enters the packed or slotted
cooling tower at 482°F (250°C as in ISHR) and leaves at 416°F. A portion
of the D20 is evaporated into a recirculating gas stream, which is then
cooled. Part of the vapor is condensed in a heat exchanger producing
steam. The tower bed and the core are located in a horizontal pressure
vessel 10 ft in diameter and 30 ft long. The reactor may be used as a
breeder, or, by substituting HZO for D20, as a burner to produce power,

Fuel-moderator: 93.5% enriched U in dilute DZO solution of uranyl

sulfate, Fertile material: breeding blanket, 2 ft thick, of ThOZ-DZO
slurry. Other blanket compositions considered were: thorium for a
breeder, lithium compound to produce tritium, and uranium to produce
plutonium. Both solution and slurry are under 1000 psia pressure at
250°C. A modification of the ISHR Single-Region design, the core vessel
of the ISHR Two-Region Converter is a sphere, 4 ft diameter, of stainless
steel. Fuel enters at the bottom, where it is heated to 482°F, and
leaves at the top to return to the two-pass, horizontal, shell-and-tube
heat exchanger for cooling. An arrangement of screens in the core tank
and the small-diameter holes through the pressure shell from the breeder
material inlet and outlet headers provide efficient flow of fluids
through the wvessel. Cooling by thermal convection in the high-pressure
recirculating system makes fuel dumping unnecessary. Control: control
rod designs were considered but discarded on basis of self-regulation by

temperature coefficient. Power: core-48 Mw; blanket-9.6 Mw.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder. Fuel-moderator-coolant:
solution of UOZSO4 in D20 (no enrichment or isotope given). Fertile
material: blanket 2 ft thick of 3 equal-volume annuli of ThO2 pellets and
4 annuli of D20. Fuel solution enters core at 482°F through annular

nozzle fitted with vanes to give it a swirling motion, which stabilizes the
flow and prevents boundary-layer separation as the solution flows down
along the core-vessel wall. Fuel returns along the axis of the core and
exits at 554°F through a central nozzle leading to the pump, which
discharges into two heat exchangers in parallel. Fuel returns to the

core. Core vessel: 4.4 ft diameter x 14.6 ft long vertical cylinder of
Zircaloy plate strengthened by ribs and stiffeners. Blanket pellets
retained between Zircaloy-2 cylinders, concentric with the core vessel

and perforated by small holes to a porosity of 50%. DZO coolant flows

up from the bottom of the vessel, along the core vessel wall, and then
"percolates" through the 3 layers of pellets. Each layer is divided into
33 sections ("baskets") by Zircaloy plates. Blanket D,0 flows through
pumps and then heat exchangers, from which it returns to the blanket

inlet. Maximum allowable velocity for both fluids: 20 fps. Operating
pressure: 2000 psi. Reflector: D20, 5.5 em thick, surrounding blanket
and core. Control: assumed to be by negative temperature coefficient.

A station of four reactors would produce 3640 Mw(t) or 1000 Mw(e)=--910

Status: Conceptual design, 1950. No further work.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel-moderator-coolant:
solution of 93.4% enriched U235 as uranyl sulfate in HZO' Core: 6 ft
diameter stainless-steel lined, carbon-steel sphere. There are 6
horizontal shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Fuel solution is circulated
by canned rotor centrifugal pumps at 25,000 gpm and is introduced through
tangential inlets to the reactor core. The circular motion of the liquid
in the core drives the gas bubbles toward the vortex and reduces the
volume of vapor holdup in the core. A recombiner burns the gas to provide
heat for superheating the steam. Solution inlet temperature: 208°C;
outlet: 250°C. Reactor pressure: 2000 psia. Control: reactor is
expected to be self-stabilizing; consequently, no control rods included,

material are located in the same 6-ft—-diameter vessel. By use of a
rotational flow pattern, the reactor vessel is operated as a centrifugal-
type separator to locate the solution in the center and the slurry at the
periphery. However, some fuel may be with the slurry, and the density
distribution of the slurry may not be distinct. Two designs are given for
the core and flow pattern: 1) A fine slurry is recirculated from the
outlet in the wall of the cylindrical vessel. After heat is removed, it

is injected tangentically at the opposite end in a direction so as to
reinforce the rotational flow pattern. Direction could also be reversed
to top to bottom. Solution is circulated separately. 2) A coarse slurry
may be employed, for which the entire separation can be achieved near the
inlet on each pass in one second. One main circulating system is used

in either of two ways: slurry and solution could mix at the outlet,

pass through the heat exchanger together, and separate at the inlet; or

the sclution alone could be circulated and the slurry kept in the reactor.
Flow velocity for both designs (1 and 2): 20 ft/sec. No other data given.

Chapter 4 Boiling Reactors for Power and Breeding

In this chapter boiling reactors are defined as those in which the
heat of fission boils an aqueous solution or slurry in the core, so that
the rising steam condenses on a heat exchanger and returns to the core.
Here again, confusing nomenclature makes it necessary to distinguish these

' as described

reactors from several others of similar names. ''Water Boilers,'
in Chapter 2, ordinarily do not boil: the boiling appearance is due to
evolution of radiolytic gases. These reactors are cooled by circulating the
fuel solution. Such boiling-water reactors as the Experimental Boiling

Water Reactor are not homogeneous, and do not have fuel in solution., Also
excluded are those homogeneous aqueous reactors in which boiling takes

place in the blanket and not in the core., These reactors are discussed iIn
Chapter 3.

The boiling reactors in this chapter are of three general types: one-
region solution; one-region slurry; and two-region slurry. Also included
because of its similarity is a reactor fueled with a slurry or solution
that passes through tubes in the critical region and then to the heat exchanger.

Lane has listed some of the advantages of beoiling as a method of heat
removal.! The reactor responds more quickly to sudden increases in reactivity,
so that power excursions are minimized. Pumps for circulating fuel are not
needed. For the same reactor pressure, steam is delivered to a turbine at a
higher temperature. Corrosion and radioactive contamination of external
systems are reduced because the fuel solution or slurry is not circulated to
an external heat-exchange system. Early doubts as to the nuclear stability
of boiling solutions have been removed, and experiments indicate that boiling
reactors are comparable with non=boiling reactors in power densities obtained.
Much experimental work has been carried out on the reduction and consequent
precipitation of uranyl sulfate solutions in steel reactors. Titanium-lined
equipment and oxygen have been used to solve this problem.

One of the early boiling concepts was that of E. P. Wigner, who, in 1944,
proposed an unusual boiling-solution reactor.? It consisted of a series of
trays, filled with plutonium=-salt solution, that are placed above each other,
With enough trays, the solution becomes critical and boils. Steam is
condensed and returned to the trays. The heat can be recovered as useful
power. Simplicity, no outside holdup, and elimination of fission poisons are
some of the advantages discussed. Entrainment of plutonium salts, bubbling,

and solution instability are among the possible problems.

145

Fewer concepts have been developed for boiling aqueous homogeneous
reactors than for non-boiling ones, and only one has actually been operated
in the U.S.--SUPO, a water boiler, was operated under boiling conditions at
different times to test the feasibility of boiling reactors and to study
variables. A Russian reactor, however, using boiling slurry was constructed,
and a French experimental prototype, PHOEBUS--a reactor physics experiment--is

scheduled for construction.

Feasibility of Boiling Reactors

Because of the doubts that a boiling reactor would be stable, several

preliminary studies were made.

SUPO Experiments

In 1951, after the construction of HRE-1, the Homogeneous Reactor
Project group considered removing heat from a homogeneous reactor by boiling
the fuel solution rather than by circulating it. Experiments on bulk boiling
at atmospheric pressure in a cylindrical tank 1 ft in diameter indicated that
power densities up to 5 kw might be achieved.

To determine nuclear stability, a group from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge
operated SUPO under boiling conditions in October 1951, thereby indicating
that it could be operated safely as a boiling solution reactor at its
maximum power density of 4 kw per liter.3 Experiments were continued in 1952
and 1953 to confirm the stability of operation" and to study such problems
as power removal,® chemical stability,® bubble formation,’ and different
core arrangements,®

A small feasibility program started early in 1951 with the construction
of a simulator to study air bubbles to determine the rate of heat removal
and solve certain control problems.® Later in 1951 after the SUPO experiment,
there was postulated a reactor with boiling liquid flowing up the center of
the core, liberating part of the vapor at the top surface, and flowing down
in an annular region along the wall of the containing vessel, Design of a
small boiling homogeneous reactor was begun, with power output to 100 kw
(2 kw/liter), and pressures to 150 psi.1® It was designed for temporary use
only, to demonstrate higher power densities and void volume than the SUPO
and to give experience in design and operation of a boiling reactor. A
vertical thimble design was incorporated11 and the boiling reactor research

program was continued to investigate the controllability and operating levels,

146

as well as the mechanics of actually designing, building, and operating
such a reactor.l?

Stein and Kasten concluded on the basis of developed kinetic equations
that boiling reactors appear to be inherently stable, although the power
density available may limit their applications.!3 Welton also commented
that kinetic equations indicate boiling reactors would be stable,l"

Kasten reported that stability of boiling reactors should increase
with the power level, and it should also increase as average vapor bubble
size decreases., The reactor pressure should be as high as possible to
improve the power density and yet have sufficient bubble nuclei for good

stability.l®

Teant

Although the experiments with SUPO had demonstrated the stability of
boiling reactors, more work was needed. SUPO had unfavorable geometry for
steam release,!® and, since it had cooling tubes rather than coolant in
the moderator-fuel solution, water boiled out of the cooling tubes. This
boiling removed reactivity from the reactor and made uncertain the amount
of reactivity required to produce various power levels when boiling."
Also, high-pressure density measurements would be required.l’

The preliminary design of a boiling reactor experiment (BRE) was
initiated at ORNL, and it was nearing completion by March 1962. This
apparatus, the TEAPOT, consisted of an unreflected homogeneous reactor of
variable height with a solution of uranyl sulfate (93.4% U235) in water as
fuel and moderator. It was to be run under bulk boiling conditions, with
nuclear power supplying all the energy for vapor formation, at 150 psi and
a thermal power load of 250 kw (4 to 5 kw per liter of solution),ws19
TEAPOT should not be confused with various heterogeneous boiling reactor
experiments leading to BORAX.

In January 1953, the difficulty in preventing reduction and precipitation
of the uranium in a boiling uranyl sulfate solution became apparent, and
construction of the reactor was postponed until experiments in solution-
stability were completed. These experiments, completed in October 1953,
indicated that at oxygen concentrations likely to be encountered in a boiling
reactor (6 to 7 ppm), uranium would be reduced in solution in contact with
stainless steel. Because the metallurgy of titanium or zirconium was not

sufficiently advanced to build a reactor with them, it was decided to

147
abandon the boiling reactor experiment and continue experiments on such
problems as solution stability and steam separation.20 Also, work on

HRE-1 indicated that construction of a second homogeneous reactor experiment
would be preferable,?!

A study was also initiated for a large-scale homogeneous boiling reactor
to exist only on paper (Paper Bolling Reactor, PBR), initially a power and
plutonium producer whose study would uncover problems of constructing an
actual boiling reactor. A 6-ft reactor to operate at one atmosphere was
planned, in addition to TEAPOT.l2 Late in 1952, however, intermediate design
effort on the experiment was reduced and the immediate objective changed from
constructing an operating experiment to developing a mockup of the TEAPOT
for more complete testing of alternate components, Construction of the
building was also to be delayed until after additional studies of the

components and characteristics of the mockup could be made.?2?

Other Concepts

Although there has been comparatively little actual operation of boiling-

core reactors, several concepts have been developed.

One-Region Solution Reactors

In an ORNL concept, boiling uranyl sulfate solution in heavy water is
contained in a cylindrical reactor.!3 The heat of the fission reaction
vaporizes the liquid; the generated steam rises through the liquid and vapor
spaces and is condensed by heat exchangers. Slurry and other types could be
tried also,

The 10 Mw Homogeneous Boiling Reactor, was designed by ORSORT for use in
remote locations.?3 The fuel is 93.4%-enriched uranyl sulfate dissolved in
ordinary water . It is controlled by the level of fuel in the core. Power
removal is predominantly by natural bubble rise and growth.

Another ORSORT concept postulated production of power--1200 Mw(t)--and
plutonium.?* The core is a boiling solution of uranyl sulfate or slurry of
uranium trioxide with an enrichment of about 1% U235. The steam-liquid
mixture from the reactor flows to external vapor separators and the liquid
returns to the core by gravity through external downcomers. Control might
be by change in void fraction or by holdup of the solvent moderator or solute
fuel. It was concluded that: (a) to be economical, boiling homogeneous

reactors must be very large and operate at high pressure and high volumetric

steam fraction, suitable only for large power plants; (b) they appear to be

148

feasible except for unsteady-state behavior; (¢) the cost is equal to that
of non-boiling forced-circulation reactor.

Babcock and Wilcox in 1955 made a design study of a power plant using
a solution of uranyl sulfate in light water as fuel.?® The total thermal
output is 1300 kw, and power is removed from the core by boiling the fuel
solution, The heat is transferred to the secondary steam system by
condensing primary water on the external surface of a bayonet-type boiler
and boiling secondary water within the tubes. In addition, vertical
coolant tubes extend through the solution to the bottom of the pot, The
reactor is controlled automatically by power demand.

Another single-region reactor type that might use solution or slurry
fuel is described in a German patent.2® 1In the pear-shaped reactor vessel,
the solution or slurry boils, and the vapor is condensed on a horizontal
finned cooling tube in the upper portion of the reactor.

A Canadian patent describes a reactor with a core of boiling slurry
or solution.?’ The core acts as a heat generator and also as a vapor
separator. Thus there is a small external circuit so that less fuel and
moderator is needed. The chief feature is a method for separating steam
from liquid rapidly. The solution or slurry iIs injected tangentially to
the core periphery to produce a vortex movement in the liquid. Steam

bubbles are driven toward the center and the vapor escapes at high speeds.

One~Region Boiling-~Slurry-Core Reactors

An ORSORT group published a preliminary design and feasibility study
for a plutonium power producer, in which the fuel is boiling uranium
trioxide slurry, either natural or slightly enriched, in heavy water,28
Heat is removed by the saturated vapor leaving the reactor shell and
passing directly to the turbines or through chemically fired superheaters
upstream from the turbines. Control is by increasing or decreasing the
reactive volume or changing the moderator-to-uranium ratio.

Another ORSORT reactor yields 500 Mw(t) and produces uranium=233, The
fuel is uranium dioxide and thorium dioxide suspended in heavy water.
Natural circulation, with internal liquid-vapor cyclone separators and an
internal downcomer, is used for power removal. Control may be effected
by varying the volume of slurry or heavy water in the core,2?

In the Boiling Slurry Reactor Experiment (BSRE), or SLURREX, of the

Argonne National Laboratory, slurry is circulated, and power is removed by

149

boiling. The purpose was to determine feasibility and to gain information
on operating problems.

Slurry flows up through a 24 in. pipe that defines the core region and
returns through downcomers to the core inlet. The slurry boils in the core,
and steam is separated in a sausage-shaped section at the core outlet,. 39
This reactor can be a burner—=converter using the U-HZO—Th or U—HZO-Pu fuel
cycles, or a breeder using the U—DZO—Th cycle. It can be controlled by
either adjusting the slurry concentration or varying the recirculation
velocity.3! Between April and December 1960, an initial hazards analysis
had shown that SLURREX could be operated safely near EBR-II at the National
Reactor Testing Station in Idaho. Also, because the performance of boiling
reactors depends largely on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the reactor
system, an atmospheric-pressure mockup of the vessel had been built with
fabrication and erection essentially complete.32

A French 500 to 1000 kw experimental prototype, PHOEBUS (Pilot Homogeneous
Reactor with Ebullition and Suspension), is comparable to SLURREX in that
both use a suspension containing uranium dispersed in light or heavy water
with heat extracted by boiling in the reactor. In PHOEBUS a cyclone
device is proposed for accelerating this heat extraction, whereby the
bubbles of vapor move toward the vortex where they are collected. Liquid
fuel is injected tangentially at the periphery of the core and dispersed.

The fuel could be either a solution or a suspension, although at present

the use of a suspension in water having a pH of about 7 is being considered.
Many hydraulic problems are involved, such as stability of the vortex

shape and proportions, the mechanism for forming the bubbles, and the
fluctuations in spatial concentration of the final suspensions. A 500-kw
electrical model has answered some of these questions. PHOEBUS itself is
conceived as a reactor physics experiment. Light water will be used for
moderator, and the fuel will be suspensions of fine glass spheres of

uranium, or possibly particles of uranium dioxide fused at a high temperature°33

Two-Region Slurry-Core Reactors

A two-region reactor with boiling slurry in both the core and breeding
blanket has been briefly discussed in an ORSORT report.2L+ The fuel-moderator-
coolant is a slurry of uranium trioxide in heavy water, with thorium dioxide

slurry in the blanket. The reactor produces 66 Mw(e).

150

A Russian experimental power reactor located at Ulyanovsk, near the
Volga, uses uranium oxides suspended in heavy water as fuel-moderator-coolant,
and a thorium suspension as fertile material. The power level is 25-35
Mw(t)3"% and the coolant pressure 700 psia.3%»3% 1In related Russian concepts
for boiling homogeneous reactors, a boiling solution is given as an
alternative; and a reflector filled with a boiling suspension of thorium

in heavy water, with an external circulating system, was suggested,%s?’7

Miscellaneous

A British patent describes a reactor in which heat is removed from the
critical region by using the steam bubbles formed by beoiling in the
critical region, which has many upwardly extending tubes of small diameter,
to circulate the liquid fuel through a heat exchanger.38 Such fuels as
slurries or sclutions-~-enriched uranyl sulfate in ordinary water, for
example--might be used. The length and diameter of the tubes distinguish

this invention from previous circulating systems.
Status

As with the non-boiling homogeneous aqueous reactors, the future of
boiling reactors is uncertain. Few concepts have gone beyond the design
stage, and the early interest does not appear to have led to industrial
development, in the U.S. at least. Some investigations have been made of
comparative costs. In 1953, Briggs reported that differences in costs

between boiling and circulating reactors were small,3?

"unsteady-state behavior,'" authors suggest a reflector, operation at

higher pressure, and use of HZO instead of D20° Fuel flow: by natural
circulation; no pumps are necessary. In the primary power-removal systen,
the steam-liquid mixture from the reactor flows to multiple external
vapor separators, from which the liquid returns to the core by gravity
through external downcomers. Steam goes to heat exchangers and the
condensate circulates through the thermal shield as it returns to the

core by gravity. Control: by moderator holdup. The reactor is designed
as a power producer--1200 Mw(t), 346 Mw(e)--with plutonium as by-product.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel: enriched uranyl
nitrate, sulfate, or other salt in HZO or DZO’ or p%g;onium. Example

2O, 90% enriched in U

900 g; operating mass: 2 kg. Reflector: 60-in,

» Moderator: H,O,

uses 0,5 M uranyl sulfate in H 2

Critical mass U235:
graphite cube, Reactor housing: three regions: <critical, heat-exchanger,
and gas-recombination. All are inside larger cylinder. Critical region
is spherical shell of stainless steel, 1/4 in. thick. It is perforated
at bottom so that solution may enter, A bundle of small tubes welded
to top of reactor shell connects it to heat exchanger. Tubes are of
such a length that most steam bubbles form in tube rather than critical
region. The fuel level is just below the top of the tubes. The nuclear
reaction boils the solution, which forms steam bubbles. Multiple tubes
minimize bubble surges. At optimum circulation and at 100°C operating
temperature, tubes should be at least as long as the critical region. For
a critical-region diameter and a tube length of 25 cm each, the optimum
tube diameter is about 1 cm. Bubbles move upward into the tubes, forcing
out the fuel solution that fills them., This solution circulates through
heat exchangers, and back to the reaction vessel, where it is again
heated, Heat exchanger: series of flat spaced stalnless-steel coils
forming a cylindrical bundle. Water vapor and radiolytic gases pass
through gas-recombination systems and cooling channels. Condensed water
returns to the reactor. Control: negative temperature coefficient;
control of fuel concentration, B or Cd sleeve; vertical control rod.
