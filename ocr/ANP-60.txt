In th1s edltlon of the Quarterly Pragress‘Beporf of the Alrcraft Nuclear'

.:Propu131on PrOJect the research is divided into four phases in order to
_”-fa0111tate the presentatlon and the comprehen310n of the work Each of these
| phases — Reactor Design, Shleldlng Research. Materlals Research and Altef-
.natlve Systems - 18 separately 1ntroduced so that the reader may know the- ‘

spec1f1c areas covered in the subsequent detalled élscu331ons

. The d351gn of the Alrcraft Reactor Experlment (Sec 2) has been developed

'”_1nt1macy of the fuel elementa and the heat transfer medlum ensures complete

“continuity of heat flow from fuel to coolant = an essential feature of high-

.(about 900° F) An alternative fluorlde fuel UF -KF.NaF, possessing a higher
"uranlum concentratlon (about 120 lb/ft ) is available although its meltlng
f p01nt (about 1920 F} is h1gh (Sec 6). The radlatlon stab111ty of these fuels

tubes (as descrlbed in sectlon on. control of the alrcraft reactor) are ema;

ployed for alI fuel elements except control elementse The fuel headers to'o

whlch the fuel elements are welded are arranged S0 thattﬂualnd1v1dual ny- tubeme

_ legs are connected to separate headers, de51gnated as “1nlet"«and "outlet™ for

‘load1ng?-unload1ngg flushlng, etc, The fuel headers are partlally empty durlng

operation, serV1ng as accumulators to accommodate changes 1n.core fuel volume.

assoc1ated w1th fuel temperature changes.

One hundrediﬂdiiftyxune fuel element sectors are employed each of whlch:_ 

”contains a proportlonate share of fnel elements, one inlet header and one .

”outlet header‘_ Thls degree of compartmentallzatlon favors fabrlcat1on and

'1nspect10n and minimizes the conseguences of any one or more fallures, since"
 ¥any ‘one fallure will involve the loss of less than 1% of the 'tot ai fuelf
volume,- Several ‘such’ fa1lures can be compensated for by control’ aﬁjustment,r

Inlet and outlet f1111ng and flushlng tubes connected to the individual

headers, are grouped together into a spider=shaped harness and hrought to a

multitube conduit passing through the pressure shell. The conduit is routed

'through the shleld to an external filling and flushlng station,

The arrangement 1llustrated emhodles features that were selected after
rev1ew of many alternatives. It was found that thin fuel elements are required
to minimize peak fuel temperatures which tend to become critical, because the
thermal conductlvxty of the fuel is estlmated to be of the order of 1.0 to 1.5
.-Btu/(hr »ft-°F), It was decided to use cyllndrlcal fuel elements rather than

plate type elements for maximum r831stance to differential pressures. Tubes_-

of small dlameters and lengths not in excess of several feet minimize hoop
etresses assoc1ated with fuel egress acceleration forees- These facters, plus
conSIderatlons of eurface area and 1nc1uded volume requxrements, dzctated ‘the

-dzmen51onal constants listed in Table 1. 1

_Gore Materials. The material selections which have been mentioned are
" not necessarily final, but these materlals have been tentatlvely adopted on

the basis of current data.
Fuel. The fused fluorides have been specified to permit the negative
temperature coefficient and because of the relative ease of fuel drainage and

replenishment associated with liquid fuels., These factors are discussed in

more detail in Seecs. 3 and 6.

that the control difficulties are mitigated by the reactor design which is

"alrcraft usage from the standpolnts of we1ght  51ze; and eff1c1ency._ Wlahlne
.thls category a broad band of rotor types may be des1gned ranging from pure
centrifugal at the hzgh head—-iow flow end of the range, through mixed row
1mpellersg'to axial flow at the moderate head—high flow end of the‘range,.
The flow rates and heads required by the preposed system fall within the range
permlttlng the use of ax1al flow pumps, which are preferred for their com-

' Intermediate Heat Exchanger° The problem of heat transfer in the inter-

However, the relatlve 1nsen51t1v1ty of the airplane weight as a function of
heatuexchanger size permlts the use of somewhat larger and thlcker tubular
elements. Cyllndrical elements are preferred for max1mum re51stance to

fseal and bent- tube construction, The former may involve bellows stresses that3

 are unacceptable at the intended operatlng temperature unless the pressures

in the prlmary and secondary 01rcu1ts are’ substantlally balanced at all tlmes,

which may be undesirable as well as difficult to ensure. Accordingly, the
bentﬂtuhe or "hockey stick" design (Fig. 1.5) has been selected. Heat-exchanger

The general features of the 200 megawatt alrcraft reactor have beeng

postulated "and a prellmlnary de51gn ‘of the core, shleld and fluxd CIrcu1t 

has been achleved (Sec. 1). With thxs deslgn as a point of departure, the
desxgn of a low»powered test reactor,-the ARE 1ntended as a prototype of_
:',certaln features of the 200 megawatt reactor, was attempted The complexity: ”
-_of the overall alrcraft power plant system appears to be such as to warrant
'1fseparate development of the magor components prlor to any ettempt to operate
" the entlre systemg Accordlngly the Alrcraft Reactor Experlment is regarded-e'
'as a core and control system development program with shielding and fluldjo"'
_clrcult components de31gned for 31mpllc1ty and adequacy rather than for
fazthful ‘aircraft slmulatlon The current desxgn status o{ ARE components 13_'

CORE DESIGN

- The core design:is intended to'dupiicate, insofar as is practicable, the
‘materials, the temperature patterns-and'the kinetics of the 200-megawatt
reactora_ Studies have indicated that the temperature pattern and certain of
;the control klnetlcs constants would be almost dupllcated if the alrplane-31ze

~ fuel elements Were employed w1th the number of fuel elements reduced pro-
| portlonately to the power reductlonn Such an arrangement woeld have in-
. sufflczent fuel volume, however, and compromzses in the direction of more and
'__'larger fuel elements appear to be necessary - The more conservatism employed
in estimation of the critical mass, the greater will be the fuel volume pro-
vzded and the larger the departure from the 1ntended temperature ‘and klnetlc'

SImulatlon

It therefore seems best to defer flnal determznatlon of requ1red fuel
volume pend1ng criticality tests, although it is desired to initiate procure-
- ment of the pressure shell, the moderator and reflector ceramic blocks, and
the sheet metal and metal tubing as early as possible. A core has therefore
been designed (Fig. 2.1) that will permit freezing the components requiring

early procurement while retaining fuel volume flexibility. This flexibility

The flrst handllng of fuel for the ARE system, as such is expeeted to

The general requlrement ‘is for the experlmental determlnatlon of techniques of 
handllng a llquld coolant which, in the case of sodium, would be solid at roomn |
temperature and Would require preheatlng to at least 300°F before any transfer
| would take place If the coolant was sodium-potassium eutectic alloy, which
S is llquld at room temperatures it would not require preheating but would

requlre pressur1z1ng at a temperature of 1500 F,

1ngg (12) preheatlng,ln.the case of sod;um, and (13) waste-heat fluid systems.

Experlments will 1nvolve mock-ups of core sections including tubes and
’headers to determine hydrodynamzc propertles and thermal charecter1stzcs of
these sections. Also included will be development of valves and flowmeters
and other devices for controlling the locstion and transfer of coolant. A
pump will be required which will handle about 150 to 200 gpm; for the ARE
application it is anticipated that commercially available pumps can be modi fied
for this purpose. Studies of electromagnetic pumps will continue. The
techniques of cleaning the cooling system of the reactor and transferring
'coolant»to it in'a_pure state and of providing equipment for maintaining
‘purity of the coolant require considerable development in order to assure

satisfactory handling at a maximum coolant temperature of 1500°F,

comparlsons between the react1v1ty of reactors calculated by the two dlfferent:

methods.

IBM Calculatlons; (F C. Uffleman and Phyllls Johnson, Uranlum Control
-and Cbmputlng Department) Durzng the quarter ending Feb. 28, 1951 a machine
and procedural changeover from the linear approx1mat10n me thod tothe end - p01nt 
’llnear approx;matlon method was effected.  In order to make ‘this changeOVer
and to make aone add1t10na1 calculatlons, fourteen 604 boards were w1red or
'revzsed far permdnent use while about a dozen boards Were wired and used
temporarziv."Inicurrent usage are SIX 604 and two C.P.C. (Card Program
Computer) “éross.sect*ﬂn” boards, 31xteen 604 and two C. P C. reactbr"<boardé;'
two general Iist1ng boards, and one check"*llstzng board A brief summary -

3{'of the scope of operatlons is’ glven below.

The use of the cross- sectlon boards starts w1th the key«punched m1cro=.
or macro- crcss -sections, 'Decimal points are adjusted and Simpson we1ght1ng
factors are applied to.each individual cross-section, Average unwelghted.
end-point cross-sections are calculated for each element. Using these basic

cross sectlon cards for each element

as well as the end-point values l/fct,aré'calculéted'for.each group for each
core and reflector. Various combinations of the average cross-sections and
the end-point cross-sections as needed in the method are calculated. On
March 1 master basic cross-section files included basic cross-section and end-
point cross-section cards for 16 elements plus 12 "lumping effect™ variations
on basic uranium cross-sections.. Master core-reflector files included com-
plete average cross-sections, end-point cross-sections, and constants for 61

cores and three reflectors.

Calculation with the "resctor™ boards starts with the calculation of some

constants needed in meeting the coye-reflector boundary conditions. It

:-wholly or partlally made by the linear method or by a. Varzatlon of the 11near
'method : It was expected that durlng March product1on ef reactor calculatlons
wculd average at least one reactor per day and that in the future the caicu-

 lat1on time, 1nclud1ng all checkss'for one reactor w1il be about 16 hr. .

“ The7calculatidns reported in this section were initiaﬁedetzniearlydate;
1the reactors con51dered have solid fuel .rather than the liquid fuel of the
current desxgn. However, the -constituency of the small fuel velume does not
31gn1f1cantly alter the core nuclear properties and hence the static results
“(critical’ mass, Ppower distribution, etc.) are appllcable to liquid-fuel

reactors. The method of calculatlon is descrlbed in the preced1ng sectlon,

Effect of Reflector, Change of Reflecéor Thmckness. Two variationstéfﬁiﬂx

'-_reflector thlckness were made from the standard reactor. The f1rst was &z
change from 5 51 to 7.09 1n.,'an increase of 1. 58 in..The result was a drop 1n_
cr1t1ca1 mass from 98 to 63 1b. The medlan energy of the fission- produc1ng

neutrons dropped from 45 to about 14 ev.

Flgure 3. 9 shows the spatlal power dlstrlbutlon over the core w1th thls
'addxtxonal reflector. Compar1son with Flg. 3.3 (the equlvalent graph for the
~standard reactor) shows that power densxty has 1ncreased at the 1nterface,'

'The lnterface power den31ty 1s now greater than that at the core center by

:_a factor of 1. 03. Thls appears to be very close to the optlmum reflector

 th1ckness as far as good core power dlstrlbut1on is concerned. The peak to-
"average -power ratlo is 1.35 compared to 1. 39 ‘with the 5.51-in, reflector, 
: Fxgure 3.10 shows the energy dlstr1but10n of the. f1381onnproduc1ng neutrons,
i, e.g_the normallzed flsslonxng spectrum. There is now about 38% thermal

_ f15§;on at the interface as compared to 24% in the standard reactor.

‘The second investigation of the effect of reflector thickness was an
increase to 15.4 in. The critical mass decreased to approximately 53 1lb.
Figuie 3.11 shows the new spatial power distribution, The power density at
the interface is now. greater than that at the core center by a factor of 1.19
'_and'the peakvtd-averége-powar ratio is 1.52, indicating that the reflector

is tOO’thick'for good core power distribution;

From the p01nt of view of critical mass the increase of reflector thicke

"'ness from 5. 51 to 7.09 in. was very worth whlle a saving of 35 lb of fuel,

-Thc increase from 5.67 to 15.4 in. did not cause a significant increase in
the uranium sévingi'however.' If the three values of reflector thickness are
'platted vs. critical mass, the curve shows a def1alte "knee™ around 6 to 8 in.
rgflector.(see Fig. 3312, a plot of k eff VS reflector thickness). The con-
~clusion is that, from the point of v1ew<xfboth power distribution and critical
| ﬁass, the BeO reflector thlckness should be about 6 in. for a redctor of this

energy spectrums

Change to Nonmoderating Reflector. The third change in reflector condi-
"tionsiwascmmplete replacement of the BeO reflector of the standard reactor by
" a combination of 80% stainless steel and 20% sodium, by volume, of the same
“thickness. The critical‘mass increased from 98 to 151 1lb, thus demonstrating
‘the advisability of hav1ngzamoderat1ng reflector between the core and pressure
shell. o ‘

The denszty of xenon at 1ts max1mum transzent after shutdewn is a some-
what elu81ve quantlty to determ1ne because the time ‘after shutdown at which

the maximum occurs depends on. the neutron spectrum and hence varies over the

'_core. BY a process of xntegratlon It was found that the greatest Ak/k change

from the case of ne xenon would be 4. 9% and the crltlcal mass w1th thls xenon"

would be . 120 lba The maximum xenon effect 1s thus not much worse than the‘

equ111br1um xenon effect.

- Effect af ﬂranium Lumping,_ Uszng the method deveioped at KAPL(3) to

determ1ne new effect1ve cross- -sections for uranlum ‘when it exzsts in lumped

rather than homogeneous form, it was found that the critical mass increased
by only 5 lb. The fuel was assumed to exxst in 0.,08-in. 1solated p1ns hav1ng,

1s an lmportant crltetzen in selectlng an. ARE de31gn._ If 1n order to 31muu7
late the control kinetics of the ANP de51gn (1) the number of fuel ‘tubes in

the ANP reactor is scaled down by a factor equal to the ratio of the des1gn“:
power of the ANP (200 megawatts) to that of the ARE (3 megawatts?; (2) the

.7fuel tube dlameter 1is kept the same, (3) coolant volume in- the core 1is reducede'
accordlngly, and (4) the moderator yolume is increased accordlngly, then the
'resultant de81gn contains insufficient fuel volumeforcnﬁtlcalltyeveﬁthoughf
_the moderatcr volume is over 90% of the core volume. The result .is that the:'
- number of fuel tubes must be 1ncreased over this exact scale-&own, or the sive
' of the fuel tubes must be 1ncreased or both untll the reactor can be mad;

_cr1t1cal w1th a satlsfactorv fuel solutzon even though the control character=

"Ve'lstlcs of the ANP deszgn ma} not be 51muiated exactly,,

Table 3.4 llsts the composxtlon and crltlcal mass - results on the nlnee
.'?roposals._ A 5-in, reflector savzng was assumed for each reactor., The
cr1t1ca1 masses .are. glven for a BeO den31ty of both 2. 8 and 2.6 g/cc._ Iv
appears that expedzency in procurement may d1ctate acceptance of the lower

values-

_ Judglng from comparlson of the theory w1th experlment on the farst}
_cr1t10a1 assembly, these results are pe551m15t1c,and futgre correlated me thods
may predlct values as much as 33% less than those quoted. In any event the
proposed reactors 1, 2, lA and 1B could not ‘be made critical with any reason-
able fuel solutlon.\\Proposals 3 and 2A are marglnalu' Proposal 3B would
 not s1mulate the control characterlstlcs of ANP at all well, so 3A and 2B, or

: somethlng 1ntermed1ete between these two,seem to be the 1og1ca1 des1gn.

Table 3. 5 presents the results of calculatlons on react1v1ty effects in

reactor SA that will hdve to be offset by shlm contral.

/

It is planned ‘to build into the ABE two methods of contrel. ‘One method
| wxll ‘be the removal of fuel solution from a cyllndrlcal portion of the reactor
arennd the longltudznal axis, and the second method will be the insertion of
an'ebeorber control rod alohg the axis. To accomplish the 2.8% change in k
(Table 3.5) would require removing approx1mately 7%% of the fuel if it is
removed from the axial portion of the core, i.e., fuel tubes out to mbout
0.27 of the core radius will have to be devoted to shim control., These

results are rough and will be checked in the future by more elaborate methods.

Studles af molten m1xtures of uranium tetrafiucrlde with alkaii fluor1des_
and berylllum fluoride have continued during the past quarter using the
'methods of thermal analysis and of phase separation. The equilibrium diagrams
- for the binary systems KF- UR5 and NaF-UF, have been established.; A large.
'number of data on the ternary system NaF KF-UF, have been cbtalned and the »
equllibrlum diagram for this very compl;cated system is reasonably well
established." Additional data on the systemfNaF«BereUF4 haye been obtained,
but considerably more will be required to complete the equilibrium diagram for

past quarter, since it is not likely that the separated lithium isotopes will

soon be available in quantity. The general characteristics of these systems,

Previous fepbrte"(OHNL4858 and 919) have described ettempts'te prepare

dlseussed some of the " propertles of the materials so prepared Addltbonal
efforts have been made to ascertain the effects of a number of variables on
'the stabxllty of the suspenszons and to 1dent1fy the uranium cempouné present'
in the sodlum hydro%ige at - elevated temperatures.' Only a limited number of

data are presented since in-most lnstances a qualltatlve statement sufflces

to show the effect of dlfferent varlables on the system,

Stabxllty of Uraﬂlum Sespens;onsyr Vlrtualiy all the experiments have
been performed in a 51lver reactor in the prevallxng atmosphere. A few -
experlments which were run in a nickel reactor at 700°C in the prevailing
"atmosphere showed that'nickei is_corroded\?apidiy7under these conditions. The
pfesenee of nickel oxide appears to cause a decrease in the stability of
suspensions of the monocuranate, and, since this behavior of the oxide may mask
the effect of the variables under consideration, the uSe.of niekeliveesels in

an oxidizing atmosphere was abandoned,

| Effect of Temperature of Farmat;on, Most of the early experlments were
' performed by heatxng ‘the sodlum hydroxade to 700°C and adding sufficient

uranlum tr10x1de to glve a suspen31on containing ‘about 5% by welght Sub-

. sequent studzes showed that somewhat more stable suspenszons resuited when the

  tr1ox1de was added to the sodium hydroxlde at 450 to 500° c 1nstead of 700°C
- - and most of the ensuzng work utilized this lower temperature° The temperature”'
~ was ralsed to 700°C followzng the add1t1on of the trloxlde and heid there,

in most 1nstances, durlng the aglng perlod

| Effect of Agtng of SuspenSLGn Reference was made in ORNL 919 to the
fact that the suspen51ons became less stable after aglng at 700°C Additlonai
studzes have shown that thls behav1or, presumably due to a growth of the
partxciesm may be a very serious problem. The data given in Table 6.2 show
“the effect of aglng at various temperatures on the stabllzty° The values
reperted show the percentage of the orlg1nal uranium remaining in the upper
~one-fourth of the suspension after the deslgnated settllng time (100 corre-
sponds to no settllng} In all cases the uranium trioxide (heated-at 300°C,
”passed 150-mesh sieve) was added to the sodlum hydrox1de at 450 to 500°C and
the suspensxon was heated at the indicated temperature for the perlod given.

1The uranium trloXide content was approx1mately 4.5% by welght in all aases.,

The results in thls table aiso show that drastic aging of the suspensions
occurs at high temperatures.. The rate of growth durlng aglng increases with
increasing temperature and apparently becomes very pronounced at 800°C. The
suspensions appear to be more stable at 600°C than at the higher temperatures,
but it is difficult to say what fraction of the increaéed.stability is due to
particle size and what portion -arises from the increased density and viscosity
of the sodium hydroxide at the lower temperature. At the higher temperature

the decrease in density and viscosity must be responsible for a large portion

' eXtensivély'pﬂrSued and three techniques have been developed.: In addition,
the examination of electrolytzeaiiy etched single- crystal copper spheres may

lead to a better underotand1ng of the fundamental physzcal chemlstry of

thermal convectlon loops centaznlng sodium and a few lead- coﬂbaznlng loops
have been pperated by the ANP Experimental Engineering Gloupa_ Data on these
are giVen.in'Téble 11.5.. The decrease in operational troubles may'bé attrib-
uted to 1mproved operational technique and to the 1nstailat10n of adequate

p

control equipment.-

“uted to unsat1sfactory welds and should notbe interpreted as belng 1nd1cat1ve

3 mils shows promise and may be considered a "marginal™ reactor material.

'de51gned and built for use in the flgure eight loops (see Secs 11 for a
- discussion ef ‘the operat1en of these 1oops) has thus far been used exclus1vely
for . operatzon of the loop. Neither a calibrated flowmeter nor pressure taps
have been developed for accurate determination of operating characteristics.,
Initial Qperation‘showed that . the length of the electrode between the wall of
the cell and the joint with the copper secondary connector must be held to an
absolute minimum to prevent, excessive heating with resultant loosening of the
'uclamped Joxnt, The copper~-to~—stainless steel weld joint previously reported
was not entirely satisfactory owing to thermal cracking of the cell wall.
Substztutlon of the nickel electrode eliminated the weld problem but 1ntro- :

duced a hlgher resistance.,

'seals &epend mainly on caplllary action of the 11qu1d in the seal to maintain
a lnbrlcatlng fllm‘when‘nexther material in the seal possesses lubricating
qualitites, and they thus require a very fine finish and very flat sealing
surfaces, within a few microinches of true flatness. Gas seals, on the other
hand, rely on "hcundary” 1ubrication of the seal surfaces by oxide films or
'adsorbedlgaS‘films,,reqniring the use of graphite or other material having a
low boundary friction coefficient and high melting point as one of the sealing

surfaces.

C D. Hatfleld ANP D1V1s1on

Instrumentatlon for the llqu1d metals test systems described in the pre-
cedlng sectlons will requlre the routine instrumentation for genmeral control
‘purposes as well as the indication of basic physical conditions existing in
the systems. The following equ1pmen» has been developed for these liquid-
metal systems: | | S T 4 ‘ .

1. Differential pressure measurements. A mpék«up of a liquid-metals

- ecirculation loop has been designed and built for use in sodium

. manometer operation training. The mock-up is complete in every

detail, thus facilitating the manometer operatzon when used in
the forced czrculatlon sodlum loopsg-

2. Control panels. The flrst of a group of exght control panels

- has ‘been installed and is ready for operation of convection

loops.. Twe auxiliary portable power supplies have been designed

and built to supplement the control panels when these are used

to operate figure-eight circulation rigs. These power supplies

will be adaptable to other experimental testing equipment as
-_démands for such a power supply develop.

3. Automatlc 11qu1d level controls, The two-probe level-control
"~ system has operated with little trouble in both the figure-eight
and convection loops. A baffle design change is being considered
~ in the surge tank of the figure-eight to eliminate the-actuation
.- of the electrical relays in the level-control system., The—.
~agitation of sodium in. the surge tank is caused by electro- .
. magnetic pump operation at high output levels.

The standard error at a 99 5% confldence level for the average of faur '

B determlnatlons was found to be essentlally the same (approx1mately 20%) for
the four constltuents at the three concentratlon levels which were investi- =
'-;,gated ThlS means that 99 3% of. all averages of. four determlnatlons for one

For the analyses of the remalnlng uranlum bearlng fu31ons, conventlonal

Analysxs of Bery111um Fluoride (E C. Lynn and J H. Hackney) The-

':fusual Wlllard and Wlnters dlstlllatlon procedure for the removal of fluorldec

f;was found when applled to. berylllum fluorlde, to yleld low results unless anla'

.exceedlngly long distillation period was used, and even then the results were
"rather erratlc° A pyrohydrolytic procedure whereby berylllum fluoride 1sa
hydrolyzed at an elevated temperature by superheated steam and the resulting

_ferroes and nonferrous alloys were analyzed by chemlcal and by spectrographlc”
-methodsq' The results obtalned from. spectrographlc analy51s were sufficient 1n 
some cases to permzt class1f1eat10n of the samples as to alioy types;wh11e 
wzth other samples the information gained from a semlquantltatlve spectro-
graphlc analys1s ‘served as a vaiuable guide to chemical analy31se. Chemxcal*'
" methods were employed where greater accuracy in est1matlng the coneentratlen

: of the ma;or comgonents of the alloy was requlred

Aﬁalysis of é%sceilaneous Sampies (L H. Jenkins) A Qide variety of
ﬁnfelated'mLSCellan eous samples were analyzed durlng this quarter. The follow«
ing list is: typlcal of the diversity of these samples: determination of -
sodium peroxxde in sodium oxide; determlnatlon of hydrogen, nieregen, and
titanium in tltanlum hydride samples: the determination of hydrogen.iﬁ a fused
melt of lxthlum hydrlde and lithium and berylllum fluorides; the determination
of water ia barium hvdrﬂx1de determlnatlon of free 1od1ne in 11th1um 1od1de,
