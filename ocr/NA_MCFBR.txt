The characteristics of fast reactors having
molten fuels consisting of uranium and plutonium
trichlorides dissolved in alkali chlorides and
alkaline-earth chlorides were studied. The study
included considerations of the physical and
chemical properties of the fuel, the heat-removal
problems, and neutronic characteristics for three
types of chloride reactors: a homogeneous reactor
and two internally cooled reactors. Optimization of
the core size for 1000-MWe reactors resulted in a
core volume of 10,000 liters for each type. These
reactors have the favorable characteristics (even
for natural chlorine) of high breeding ratio, large
negative temperature coefficients of reactivity, and
low fuel-cycle costs. However, the unattractive
characteristics of large plutonium inventory, large
volume, complex design, and container material
problems indicate that a sizeable program to
develop  chloride-fueled reactors would be
required.

 

INTRODUCTION

Some recent studies of large solid-fueled fast
reactors have indicated the need for reactor con-
figurations such as flat cylindrical (small length/
diameter ratios) cores', annular cores’, or multiple
cores™" to avoid a positive sodium-void coefficient
of reactivity. These reactor configurations have the
disadvantage of requiring a larger fissile mass than
was once thought necessary for plutonium-fueled
fast reactors. The present study of mobile fuels for
fast plutonium breeder reactors was undertaken
because, relative to solid fuels, such fuels have the

potential advantage of a high coefficient of thermal
expansion which provides a large negative temp-
erature coefficient of reactivity.

The particular type of fuel chosen for more
detailed study was a solution of trichlorides of
uranium and plutonium dissolved 1in alkali
chlorides and alkaline-earth chlorides. The
attractive physical and chemical properties of this
type of fuel prompted a study of heat-removal
problems and the nuclear performance of chloride-
fueled reactors. Chloride-fueled fast reactors were
studied by Goodman et al.” as early as 1952. A
group of students at the Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology in 1956 concluded that a
solution of trichlorides of plutonium and uranium
dissolved in a solvent of magnesium chloride and
sodium chloride was the most promising salt fuel
for a fast reactor’. Taube in Poland also decided
that plutonium trichloride and uranium trichloride
fuels were promising’”. More recently, Alexander
concluded that chloride-fueled reactors that were
either gas-cooled or cooled by circulating the fuel
to external heat exchangers would have attractive
nuclear performance and low fuel-cycle costs'”.

The present study consisted of: 1) estimation of
fuel properties from examination of data on
chlorides and other salts; 2) calculations of reactor
design to establish approximate fast-reactor core
and blanket configurations and compositions; and
3) reactor physics calculations of critical mass and
breeding ratio for the various reactor designs. After
preliminary reactor physics calculations were
completed, it was necessary to adjust the reactor
core and blanket design and: repeat the reactor
physics calculations.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
OF CHLORIDE FUELS

The maximum acceptable liquidus temperature
of a molten reactor fuel is determined by the
maximum operating temperature for the fuel con-
tainer materials and the difference required in the
inlet and outlet temperature of the fuel for heat
transport. Consideration of these variables indi-

cated a maximum acceptable liquidus temperature
of about 550°C. Lower liquidus temperatures
would be desirable. To meet this requirement,
alkali chlorides and alkaline-earth chlorides could
be used as diluents to lower the melting point, and
the total concentration of UCIl; and PuCl; should
be limited""™" to 50 to 60 mol%. The estimated
liquidus temperatures of the various fuel compo-
sitions used in this study are given in Table I.
Obtaining molten-chloride solutions having low
liquidus temperatures over a range of compositions
that is broad enough for routine reactor operation
would be of prime importance for the success of a
chloride-fueled reactor. However, even without
knowledge of the exact composition of such low-
melting molten-salt solutions, reasonable estimates
of the physical properties can be made. Except for
the liquidus temperature, the physical properties of
chloride fuels containing PuCl;, UCI;, and
chlorides of alkali and alkaline-earth metals
depend chiefly on the total PuCl; and UCl; content.
The ratio of uranium-to-plutonium and the choice
of diluent salts are expected to have only minor
effects on the physical properties. Therefore, the
physical properties of the fuels given in Table |
were determined for PuCl; and UCIl; dissolved in a
representative solvent of NaCl-50 mol% MgCl,.

The densities of the fuel solutions were esti-
mated from empirical molar volumes at 650°C,
such as were employed by Cantor” for fluoride
salts, and the assumption of additivity. Empirical
molar volumes of LiCl, NaCl, KCI, and MgCl, at
650°C were estimated from the density data for the
LiCl-NaCl eutectic and the NaCIl-KCI-MgCl,
eutectic. By comparison with the behavior of other
chlorides and UF,, the empirical molar volumes of
UCl; and PuCl; at 650°C were estimated to be 1.15
times the molar volume of the solid salts at 20°C.

No data were available on the volumetric
expansion coefficient for the fuel mixtures of
interest in the temperature range 600 to 800°C. For
the composition range of interest [10 to 60 mol%
(UCl; + PuCly)], the value is probably 2-4 x 10™
deg C, based on data for molten-fluoride
mixtures” containing UF, and the eutectics of the
LiCl-KCl and NaCl-KCI-MgCl, systems'®. We
used a value of 3 x 10 deg C.

The thermal conductivity for the fuel mixtures
was estimated using a correlation developed by
Gambill”. While this correlation was developed
primarily for fluoride salts, application to the LiCl-
KCI eutectic produced satisfactory agreement with
experimental data'®. The low conductivity of
chloride fuels with high uranium concentrations
(only 15 to 30% that of MSRE-type fluoride fuels)
complicates the problem of heat removal from the
reactor.

Although estimation of the viscosities of the
fuels was difficult, the viscosity is not required to
great accuracy for heat-transfer calculations.

Viscosities for the molten-chloride fuels were
estimated assuming additivity for mixtures and that
viscosities were the same for similar salts at
corresponding fractions of the absolute melting
temperaturelg.

The empirical relation given by MacPherson'
was used to calculate the specific heat for the fuels.
According to these calculations, the specific heat
of fuel mixtures containing diluent salts such as
NaCl, KCI, and MgCl, decreases with increasing
UCl; concentration. The volumetric specific heat,
however, 1s not greatly changed by the UCI
concentration.

A development program would be required to
find satisfactory container material for chloride
fuels. However, nickel alloys such as Hastelloy-F
or Hastelloy-N (INOR-8) may be satisfactory
container materials for chloride fuels based on
thermodynamic calculations and performance with
containment of fluoride fuels”®* for the MSRE.
The Union Carbide Corporation” had data indi-
cating that Hastelloy-F has greater corrosion
resistance to chlorides than Hastelloy-N.

Thermal radiation decomposition of molten-
chloride reactor fuels should not produce a
sufficient concentration of elemental chlorine to
create a corrosion problem. Radiation damage in
the fuel should be unimportant®. However, the
valency and stability of the fission products will
differ from those of the uranium and plutonium in
the chloride salts. These effects of fission were
estimated” and the results indicated that noble-
metal fission products such as ruthenium and
palladium would be reduced and probably
deposited on the container walls. In addition, the
container could corrode as a result of replacement
of the easily reducible noble-metal ions in the salt
with less easily reduced species from the container.
The rate and extent of such corrosive attack would
depend on the manner of deposition of noble
metals on the container walls, and it is conceivable
that this deposition may actually limit corrosion.

REACTOR CHARACTERISTICS
Design Parameters

In developing reactor configurations necessary
to determine the nuclear characteristics for reactors
fueled with chloride fuels, 1t was first necessary to
make preliminary design calculations utilizing the
data generated for the properties of the fuel. Three
reactor types were considered: an externally cooled
homogeneous reactor type, and two types of
internally cooled reactors. The design calculations
(Table I) were based on the fuel compositions
obtained from the second round of reactor physics
calculations and the fuel properties.

The homogeneous reactor configuration, “Type
A’ (Figure 1) employs a 10,000-liter core. The
size of the core was determined by the amount of
core fuel required in the heat exchangers and
external piping and by the fraction of the total fuel
in the core that was thought necessary to provide
delayed neutrons for reactor control. The external
fuel holdup 1s 15,000 liters, 50 to 60% of which
would be contained in the heat exchangers which
would be located just outside the blanket in an
actual reactor. The remaining 50 to 40% external
fuel holdup would be 1n the piping and pumps. The

heat exchangers would contain 3- to Y2-in.-o.d.
tubing of a nickel alloy and provide about 35,000
ft* of heat-transfer area. Fuel would enter the heat
exchangers at 740°C and leave at 625°C. The
coolant could be either sodium or a molten-
fluoride salt solution. In either case, the coolant-
side heat-transfer resistance would be a small part
of the overall resistance. The core fuel would be
processed at a rate of about 55 liters/day of reactor
operation which would result in a burnup of about
3 at.%. In this scheme, the blanket fuel would not
be reprocessed, but would be simply mixed with
the proper PuCl; solution to yield core fuel. Under
these conditions, PuCl; would build up in the
blanket to 0.6 mol%; this buildup would result in
14% of the reactor power being developed in the
blanket as determined by the reactor physics
calculations.

In the “Type B” reactor configuration, the fuel
would be contained in tubes cooled by sodium in
the conventional manner. To improve heat transfer
through the fuel, and to allow use of fuel tubing of
- to ¥-in.-diam, circulation of the fuel 1s
provided at a rate that yields a Reynolds number of
about 10,000 to 25,000. Recirculation of the fuel
would require about 1000 liters of fuel external to
the reactor. The high (Pu,U)Cl; concentration in
the fuel for this reactor was required to obtain an
adequate uranium-plutonium ratio for breeding.
The sodium volume fraction in the core was
calculated for a cylindrical core with a length/
diameter ratio of one and a sodium flow velocity of
25 ft/sec. The blanket fuel for this configuration
could be chosen from any metallic or ceramic solid
blanket fuel with little effect on the overall
performance. The final reactor physics calculations
were made for a 45-cm-thick blanket completely
surrounding the core and composed of 60 vol%
uranium, 20 vol% sodium, and 20 vol% 1ron.

The “Type C” reactor configuration would be
similar to reactor Type B in that the chloride fuel
would be pumped through sodium-cooled tubes. In
Type C, however, all of the ***U would be con-
tained 1n separate solid fuel pins in the core while
the bulk of the plutonium would be in the chloride
fuel. Plutonium would be bred in the solid **U
pins. The average plutonium concentration in the
solid fuel pins would be 1% (the value assumed for
the calculations) if these pins are reprocessed when
the plutonium concentration reaches 2%. The heat-
transfer calculations to size the core and to
determine the core volume fractions were made for
a cylindrical configuration with a length/diameter
ratio of one and a sodium velocity of 25 ft/sec.

Because of the complexity of this reactor, it
would probably be necessary to have minimal axial
blankets to allow for fuel piping and removal of
the solid-uranium pin assemblies. However, the
solid pin assemblies would extend through the
spaces that would normally be the axial blanket
regions, providing 15 vol% uranium for capture of
neutrons. The remaining space would be occupied
by sodium-cooled reflectors to conserve neutrons.

The fact that the three cores have the same
volume of 10,000 liters 1s somewhat coincidental
since the core volume for each reactor was
approximately optimized, with consideration being
given to the factors of fuel composition, heat
transfer, and breeding ratio. In the case of the
homogeneous reactor, for instance, core sizes from
2500 to 10,000 liters were considered. The effect
of core size in this range had little effect on the
overall fissile inventory because of the interplay
between the wvariables of core size, fissile
concentration, and the large fixed volume (15,000
liters) of fuel held up in the heat exchangers.

REACTOR PHYSICS CALCULATIONS

Calculations were made on the three reactor
types to determine the effects of core size, core
composition, and blanket composition on the
breeding ratios and critical masses. These
calculations were made using the 16-group cross-
section set of Hansen and Roach®*?*® with modified
chlorine cross-sections. The systems studied have
no appreciable number of neutrons of energy
below the 11™ group of this set. Since the cross-
section set does not include the constituent
magnesium, the nuclear properties of magnesium
were assumed to be the same as those of sodium.
The chlorine cross-sections of the Hansen-Roach
set were modified according to the tabulations of
Kalos and Ray®’. Capture and inelastic scattering
cross sections from Kalos and Ray were used for
groups 1 through 10. In addition, the Hansen-
Roach elastic removal cross-sections for groups 2
through 11 were adjusted to correspond to intra-
group weighting by a flat spectrum. The flat
weighting spectrum 1s more appropriate for the
molten-salt system.

Spherical reactor configurations were assumed,
with no corrections being made for cylindrical
effects that would exist in an actual system. Fission
products in the salt and reactor vessels surrounding
the cores were included in the analysis. The reactor
vessels were assumed to be ¥-in. thick and
constructed of 60 wt% N1, 30 wt% Fe, and 10 wt%
Mo.

The neutronics calculations are summarized in
Table 1. A significant percentage of neutrons are
lost in the structure and vessels. Materials that can
contain the salts and have lower cross-sections
than the assumed container would be beneficial in
improving the breeding ratio and reducing the
critical mass.

Breeding ratios would probably increase also if
allowance were made for the higher plutonium
1sotopes that would build up in an actual fuel cycle.

To determine the breeding ratio and critical
mass for reactor Type C having non-fertile axial
reflectors, neutronics calculations were made both
for a completely blanketed reactor and a reactor
surrounded by a sodium-cooled steel reflector. The
breeding ratio for the Type C reactor was assumed
to be two-thirds that of the blanketed reactor and
one-third that of the reflected reactor. The critical
masses were essentially the same for the blanketed
and reflected reactors.

Additional calculations 1ndicated that the
substitution of 2*UQ, for »**U metal in the blanket
had little effect on the breeding ratio or critical
mass for reactor Types A and C. (Presumably, such
a change would have Iittle effect on the
performance of reactor Type B).

Since chlorine 1s a major constituent, the un-
certainty that exists in the chlorine cross-sections
in the neutron energy ranges applying to the
reactors under study may lead to significant
inaccuracies in the calculated neutronics. There-
fore, auxiliary calculations were made using a
value of 10 mb for the chlorine capture cross-
section in groups 5 through 8, which corresponds
to increases of 10 mb in groups 5 through 7, and 6
mb in group 8, over those used in the original
neutronics calculations. These higher values are
based on the cross sections given by Craven and
Alexander for *Cl, the most abundant isotope
(75%) of natural chlorine. (They estimate the cap-
ture cross section of >’Cl, which constitutes 25% of
natural chlorine, to be 4 mb at the intermediate
energies with considerable uncertainty in the basic
data.) Neutronics calculations with the higher
chlorine cross sections resulted in a reduction in
the breeding ratios from those given in Table I of
0.10, 0.04, and 0.02 for reactor types A, B, and C,
respectively. The percentage captures in chlorine
(Table I) increased by factors of 2.4, 1.6, and 1.8,
respectively.

It is possible that the use of separated *’Cl
instead of natural chlorine would result in less
neutron capture in chlorine and higher breeding
gains. The losses due to the (n,7), (np), and (n,«)
reactions at low and high energies are greater for
3C1 than for *’Cl. However, the effects of the 10-
mb capture cross-section used in the above
calculations for the intermediate energy range is as
large as the effect of those losses at the lower and
higher energies. Since the capture cross sections of
the two isotopes are not sufficiently well known in
the important intermediate-energy range, the gain
in neutronics performance through the use of
separated *'Cl cannot be clearly deduced. It is
expected, however, that such a gain would not be
large. Whether or not isotope separation is utilized,
the results indicate that it is feasible to design a
chloride-fueled reactor with acceptable breeding.

DISCUSSION
Reactor Performance

Chloride-fueled fast reactors have strikingly
different characteristics from solid-fueled fast
reactors. It is evident that chloride-fueled reactor
cores must have large volumes [about 10,000 liters
for 1000 MWe] because of the low fuel-density
and heat-transfer requirements. By providing a
length/diameter ratio of unity, however, the core
diameter would be comparable to those of solid-
fueled reactors of recent design'*'. The low
density of the fuel results in a core mass that is less
than that for solid-fueled fast reactors of the same
power. Despite the comparatively poor thermal
conductivity of chloride fuel, the fuel-containing
tubes in a heterogeneous reactor (Type B or Type
C) may be as large as ¥-in. in diameter. This can
be achieved by circulating the fuel at a high
enough velocity to obtain turbulent flow in the fuel
elements. Thus, an acceptable heat-transfer
coefficient and a low temperature (<1000°C) at the
fuel-element axis result. The use of a large fuel-
element diameter results in an unusually low

fraction of the core volume being filled with
structural material.

The results obtained for the particular reactor
configurations employed in this study indicate that
acceptably high breeding ratios can be obtained in
chloride-fueled reactors. The critical masses
calculated for the reactors of this study were not
greatly different than for solid-fueled reactors of
the same power. However, additional fuel is
required in the external fuel circuits associated
with the reactors. As discussed below, the reactor
designs were not optimized for minimum fuel
inventory.

There are important differences between the
control and safety problems for chloride-fueled
reactors and those for solid-fueled fast reactors.
The neutronics calculations indicated that thermal
expansion of the fuel in a chloride-fueled reactor
would cause a decrease in reactivity that would be
larger in magnitude than any other thermally
induced reactivity change. In the case of the
chloride-fueled heterogeneous reactors, a relatively
modest temperature rise in the fuel would
overcome the increase in reactivity caused by
removal of sodium from the core. Long-term
reactivity changes such as occur in solid-fueled
reactors due to buildup of fission products could be
avoided in chloride-fueled reactors by continuous
fuel processing. The control rods would require
only enough reactivity to shut down the reactor.

Reactor Design Concepts

In comparing the performance of the reactor
concepts studied, the fact that the designs were not
optimized should be considered. The volumes of
the cores for the three reactor types of this study
were  approximately  optimized, but other
conditions are somewhat arbitrary and could
probably be improved. For instance, the combined
uranium and  plutonium content of the
homogeneous reactor (Type A) was chosen to be
30 mol%. A higher value would have resulted in a
higher breeding ratio and a lower value would have
resulted in better heat-transfer characteristics and a
lower out-of-pile inventory.

Because of its high breeding ratio and simple
design, the homogeneous reactor, Type A, appears
to be the most attractive of the reactor concepts
studied. However, the 7500-kg plutonium
inventory for reactor Type A is about two or three
times the in-pile inventory usually calculated for
solid-fueled fast reactors of the same powers'™. At
a cost of $10/g for plutonium and an interest rate of
10%/year, the 7500-kg inventory would cost about
1 mill/kWh. At a plutonium cost of $5/g, the
penalty for the high plutonium inventory would be
only about 0.3 mill/kWh.

The large plutonium inventory for the homo-
geneous reactor 1s caused by the considerable
holdup of fuel in the external heat exchangers and
the large plutonium inventory in the blanket. The
core volume was found to have little effect on the
total inventory as noted above. It appears that the
large external fuel holdup for reactor Type A
cannot be reduced from the estimated value. In
fact, the estimated external fuel volume is about
the same as that calculated for a 1000-Mwe
molten-salt breeder reactor that has a fluoride fuel
of higher thermal conductivity than the chloride
fuel of this study. The plutonium content of the
blanket could be reduced considerably by reducing
the volume of the core and blanket and by
reprocessing the blanket fuel at a higher rate. A
more fruitful approach to reducing the plutonium
inventory might be to change the reactor concept to
one that would have the low plutonium inventory
of reactor Type B and the high breeding ratio of
Type A. This might be accomplished by using
chloride blanket fuel for coolant instead of sodium
in a Type B reactor.

It 1s apparent that variation in the reactor design
concepts and parameters might result in
considerable improvement in performance.

Fuel Cycles

Although a detailed cost analysis has not been
made, there appear to be inherent advantages for
fuel cycle for chloride-fueled fast reactors. One
advantage for these reactors that is shared with
other fluid-fueled reactors is that fuel could be

withdrawn continuously  without interrupting
power production.
Fuel processing should be comparatively

inexpensive. Pyrochemical reprocessing, which
appears to be the least expensive method for
metallic fuels and 1s competitive for all solid
fuels™ would probably be even less expensive for
chloride fuel. In a promising pyrochemical
process for solid fuels (oxide, carbide, or metal)
the fuels are first declad (mechanically or

chemically) and then dissolved in chloride salts by
chlorination to form salt solutions similar to the
chloride fuels of this study. These steps would not
be necessary for chloride fuel. The liquid-metal
molten-salt extraction steps for removing fission
products from chloride fuel would be identical to
those used for solid fuel. Instead of recovering
plutonium and uranium metals by retorting the
metallic precipitates formed in the process (a
difficult step in processing solid fuels), chloride
fuel would be readily reconstituted by chlorinating
the uranium and plutonium metallic precipitates,
e.g., with zinc chloride. If the blanket fuel is
molten chloride, it may be possible to eliminate
blanket reprocessing altogether for certain reactor
configurations and processing rates as indicated in
Figure 1 and discussed above. Overall, repro-
cessing of chloride fuels would appear to be less
expensive than for solid fuels. This conclusion
would probably not be correct, however, if
separated >’Cl were required in preparation of the
fuel rather than natural chlorine. Nevertheless, as
noted above, our neutronics calculations indicated
that natural chlorine was acceptable in contrast to
the evaluation of others®".

The most expensive part of fast-reactor fuel
cycles for solid fuels is that of refabrication'™**".
This results from the small diameter of the fuel
elements that are used in solid-fueled reactors. In
the case of a homogeneous chloride-fueled fast
reactor, there would be no cost for refabrication of
fuel and fuel assemblies. That expense would be
replaced by the cost of maintenance of the fuel
heat exchangers in the case of homogeneous
reactors or maintenance of molten fuel assemblies
for heterogeneous reactors. Such maintenance
would probably be less expensive than fuel
refabrication for a conventional solid-fueled
reactor.

A detailed evaluation of the fuel cycle for
fluoride-fueled molten-salt reactors®® has indicated
that the out-of-pile fissile material holdup for such
reactors would be only 35 days. A similar holdup
would be expected for chloride-fueled reactors if
on-site  pyrometallurgical  processing  were
employed. This low out-of-pile fuel holdup would
result in a saving of 80 to 90% of the fissile
inventory charge that applies for aqueous
reprocessing of solid fuels.

The savings in costs for the chloride fuel cycle
discussed above over that for solid fuels might
amount to several tenths of a mill per kilowatt-
hour. This was concluded from the cost breakdown
for the fuel cycles for 1000-MWe reactors'™*"*
and an approximate cost evaluation of the technical
advantages for a chloride fuel cycle.

CONCLUSIONS

As a class, chloride-fueled fast reactors of
commercial size have a unique combination of
favorable characteristics: high breeding ratio (even
if the fuel contains natural chlorine); large negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity; and low fuel-
cycle costs. However, they have the unattractive
characteristics of large volume, complex design,
container material problems, and, possibly, large
plutonium inventory. To solve these problems a
sizable program would be required. Chloride-
fueled reactors may become very attractive if some
of the heat-transfer, materials, and design problems
are solved in other development programs, and if
the cost of plutonium decreases.
